https://openalex.org/W1979765208,"Faithful segregation of replicated chromosomes is essential for maintenance of genetic stability and seems to be monitored by several mitotic checkpoints. Various components of these checkpoints have been identified in mammals, but their physiological relevance is largely unknown. Here we show that mutant mice with low levels of the spindle assembly checkpoint protein BubR1 develop progressive aneuploidy along with a variety of progeroid features, including short lifespan, cachectic dwarfism, lordokyphosis, cataracts, loss of subcutaneous fat and impaired wound healing. Graded reduction of BubR1 expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts causes increased aneuploidy and senescence. Male and female mutant mice have defects in meiotic chromosome segregation and are infertile. Natural aging of wild-type mice is marked by decreased expression of BubR1 in multiple tissues, including testis and ovary. These results suggest a role for BubR1 in regulating aging and infertility."

https://openalex.org/W2000175834,"Horizontal gene transfer is one of the main mechanisms contributing to microbial genome diversification. To clarify the overall picture of interspecific gene flow among prokaryotes, we developed a new method for detecting horizontally transferred genes and their possible donors by Bayesian inference with training models for nucleotide composition. Our method gives the average posterior probability (horizontal transfer index) for each gene sequence, with a low horizontal transfer index indicating recent horizontal transfer. We found that 14% of open reading frames in 116 prokaryotic complete genomes were subjected to recent horizontal transfer. Based on this data set, we quantitatively determined that the biological functions of horizontally transferred genes, except mobile element genes, are biased to three categories: cell surface, DNA binding and pathogenicity-related functions. Thus, the transferability of genes seems to depend heavily on their functions."
https://openalex.org/W1992623092,"During skeletal myogenesis, genomic reprogramming toward terminal differentiation is achieved by recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes to muscle-specific loci1,2. The relative contribution of extracellular signaling cascades in targeting these enzymes to individual genes is unknown. Here we show that the differentiation-activated p38 pathway3,4,5 targets the SWI-SNF chromatin-remodeling complex to myogenic loci. Upon differentiation, p38 kinases were recruited to the chromatin of muscle-regulatory elements. Blockade of p38α/β repressed the transcription of muscle genes by preventing recruitment of the SWI-SNF complex at these elements without affecting chromatin binding of muscle-regulatory factors and acetyltransferases. The SWI-SNF subunit BAF60 could be phosphorylated by p38α-β in vitro, and forced activation of p38α/β in myoblasts by expression of a constitutively active MKK6 (refs. 5,6,7) promoted unscheduled SWI-SNF recruitment to the myogenin promoter. Conversely, inactivation of SWI-SNF enzymatic subunits abrogated MKK6-dependent induction of muscle gene expression. These results identify an unexpected function of differentiation-activated p38 in converting external cues into chromatin modifications at discrete loci, by selectively targeting SWI-SNF to muscle-regulatory elements."
https://openalex.org/W1997522702,"Growth hormone is used to increase height in short children who are not deficient in growth hormone, but its efficacy varies largely across individuals. The genetic factors responsible for this variation are entirely unknown. In two cohorts of short children treated with growth hormone, we found that an isoform of the growth hormone receptor gene that lacks exon 3 (d3-GHR) was associated with 1.7 to 2 times more growth acceleration induced by growth hormone than the full-length isoform (P < 0.0001). In transfection experiments, the transduction of growth hormone signaling through d3-GHR homo- or heterodimers was approximately 30% higher than through full-length GHR homodimers (P < 0.0001). One-half of Europeans are hetero- or homozygous with respect to the allele encoding the d3-GHR isoform, which is dominant over the full-length isoform. These observations suggest that the polymorphism in exon 3 of GHR is important in growth hormone pharmacogenetics."
https://openalex.org/W2073947021,"We showed that the human respiratory chain is organized in supramolecular assemblies of respiratory chain complexes, the respirasomes. The mitochondrial complexes I (NADH dehydrogenase) and III (cytochrome c reductase) form a stable core respirasome to which complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) can also bind. An analysis of the state of respirasomes in patients with an isolated deficiency of single complexes provided evidence that the formation of respirasomes is essential for the assembly/stability of complex I, the major entry point of respiratory chain substrates. Genetic alterations leading to a loss of complex III prevented respirasome formation and led to the secondary loss of complex I. Therefore, primary complex III assembly deficiencies presented as combined complex III/I defects. This dependence of complex I assembly/stability on respirasome formation has important implications for the diagnosis of mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders. We showed that the human respiratory chain is organized in supramolecular assemblies of respiratory chain complexes, the respirasomes. The mitochondrial complexes I (NADH dehydrogenase) and III (cytochrome c reductase) form a stable core respirasome to which complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) can also bind.

Therefore, primary complex III assembly deficiencies presented as combined complex III/I defects. This dependence of complex I assembly/stability on respirasome formation has important implications for the diagnosis of mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders. The mammalian system of oxidative phosphorylation comprises four mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, NADH dehydrogenase (complex I), succinate dehydrogenase (complex II), cytochrome c reductase (complex III), and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV). These enzyme complexes couple the oxidation of NADH and FADH2 to vectorial proton transport across the mitochondrial membrane. F1F0-ATP synthase (complex V) then uses the resulting electrochemical potential to synthesize ATP from ADP and phosphate. Oxidative phosphorylation complexes from bovine mitochondria are functionally active when isolated as individual complexes. This had been one of the major reasons why a “liquid state” model of the respiratory chain allowing free complexes to diffuse laterally and independently of one another was generally favored (reviewed in Ref. 1Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 53-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Another major reason was the pioneering work of Hackenbrock and co-workers (2Chazotte B. Hackenbrock C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14359-14367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hackenbrock C.R. Chazotte B. Gupte S.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1986; 18: 331-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that the concentration of free-diffusing components in the inner mitochondrial membrane and the collision rate between them is enough to explain the observed respiratory rates in mitochondria. However, recent data favor a “solid state” model with permanently associated complexes. Cruciat et al. (4Cruciat C.-M. Brunner S. Baumann F. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18093-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and Schägger and Pfeiffer (5Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar) isolated a stoichiometrically assembled respiratory chain supercomplexes from yeast and mammalian mitochondria with high yield. In bovine mitochondria almost all complex I was found associated with dimeric complex III. Additional association of complex IV with this core structure seemed to be more detergent-sensitive, eventually leading to the isolation of different supercomplexes with a variable copy number of complex IV. The largest of these respirasomes containing four copies of complex IV has been proposed to constitute a complete respirasome (5Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). The assembly into respirasomes has been suggested to have a number of potential advantages compared with individual complexes, e.g. substrate channeling of quinones and/or cytochrome c, sequestration of reactive intermediates like ubisemiquinone, and stabilization of individual complexes by supramolecular assembly (5Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). However, experimental evidence confirming or dismissing specific functions is just beginning to emerge. Substrate channeling directs the mobile electron carriers ubiquinone and cytochrome c directly to the next enzyme rather than allowing competition with other enzymes or exchange with substrate pools and is required for electron flow at low substrate reduction levels. Recently, substrate channeling of ubiquinone between complexes I and III has been experimentally verified for bovine mitochondria by determining flux control ratios (6Genova M.L. Bianchi C. Lenaz G. Ital. J. Biochem. (Engl. Ed.). 2003; 52: 58-61PubMed Google Scholar). Sequestration of the reactive intermediate ubisemiquinone is essential, because ubisemiquinone can react with oxygen to generate superoxide anion radical, which is involved in the pathogenicity of mitochondrial disorders (7Smeitink J. van den Heuvel L. DiMauro S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), but a potential requirement of stable respirasomes for sequestration of ubisemiquinone has not been verified experimentally so far. Recently we have shown structural stabilization of a bacterial complex I by assembly in a complete respirasome in Paracoccus denitrificans (8Stroh A. Anderka O. Pfeiffer K. Yagi T. Finel M. Ludwig B. Schägger H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5000-5007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). A similar role of respirasomes for the stability of individual complexes in mammals would have considerable implications for human respiratory chain disorders, especially for the etiology of combined deficiencies of multiple complexes in mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. Toward a molecular understanding of the structural and functional roles of respirasome formation and the etiology of mitochondrial neuromuscular disorders, the focus of the present work was to analyze the structural integrity of human respirasomes in patients with defined defects of individual respiratory chain complexes. Here, we present evidence for an essential role of respirasome formation for the assembly/stability of complex I. Primary genetic assembly defects of complex III prevented respirasome formation and led to a secondary loss of complex I thereby presenting as a combined complex III/I deficiency. A brief summary of these conclusions has been presented before in a review article on respiratory chain supercomplexes (9Schägger H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Isolation of mitochondria from human skeletal muscle, solubilization of mitochondrial membranes by detergents, blue-native (BN) 1The abbreviation used is: BN, blue native. PAGE, two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, staining, and densitometric quantification of individual oxidative phosphorylation complexes in two-dimensional gels was performed essentially as described (10Schägger H. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 10 mg of skeletal muscle (wet weight, stored at –80 °C) was homogenized in 0.5 ml of sucrose buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm sodium-phosphate, pH 7.2) using a tightly fitting homogenizer. Following a 10-min centrifugation at 25,000 × g the mitochondria-containing sediment was suspended with 20 μl of low salt buffer (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.0) and solubilized with 7.5 μl of dodecylmaltoside (10%) for solubilization of individual respiratory chain complexes or with 7.5 μl of digitonin (20%) for solubilization of respiratory chain supercomplexes. Water-soluble digitonin from Fluka (catalog number 37006, >50% purity) was used directly without recrystallization. Following a 15-min centrifugation at 100,000 × g, Coomassie-G250 dye was added to the supernatant (7.5 μl from a 5% stock in 750 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid), and the total volume was applied to 0.5 × 0.15 cm sample wells for BN-PAGE. Low digitonin/protein ratios (∼0.1 g/g) have been used to prepare mitoplasts (11Schnaitman C. Greenawalt J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 38: 158-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar, 12Raza H. Robin M.-A. Fang J. Avadhani N.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 45-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the solubilization of oxidative phosphorylation complexes from bovine mitochondria starts with a 10-fold higher ratio (∼1 g/g). The solubilization and recovery of all complexes after BN-PAGE is optimal and near quantitative with 3–8-g digitonin/g of protein (5Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 13Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37861-37867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For convenience, solubilization of crude human mitochondrial sediments was optimized for the wet weight of the skeletal muscle specimens without using protein-determination methods. To make solubilization largely independent of experimental variation, we added digitonin in large excess. This standard digitonin addition, as described above, is far above the quantities required for near quantitative solubilization of oxidative phosphorylation complexes. Reducing the digitonin amounts to 50 or 25% of the standard addition led to a comparable recovery of all complexes after BN-PAGE except that the amount of dimeric complex V increased from hardly detectable to considerable quantities (∼15% of monomeric complex V; data not shown). Conventional BN-PAGE using dodecylmaltoside for solubilization of mitochondria resolves individual respiratory chain complexes (10Schägger H. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE in a second dimension then separates the subunits as shown for control skeletal muscle in Fig. 1A. To elucidate the structural organization of the human respiratory chain from skeletal muscle of control individuals and patients with defined defects of individual complexes we modified the protocol for BN-PAGE using the mild detergent digitonin for membrane protein solubilization, because this detergent has been shown to retain respiratory chain supercomplexes from yeast and bovine mitochondria (4Cruciat C.-M. Brunner S. Baumann F. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18093-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 5Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). In the skeletal muscle of control individuals two supercomplexes were present, a smaller complex (Fig. 1B, S) with an apparent mass of ∼1.5 MDa and a larger one (L) with estimated 1.7 MDa. These supercomplexes differ in their composition. Both contained monomeric complex I and dimeric complex III (immunological identification not shown). Complex L contained one copy of complex IV in addition. Respiratory chain complexes II, III, and IV, and the F1F0-ATP synthase (complex V) were also found as individual complexes under the conditions of BN-PAGE. All human complex I was exclusively assembled into supercomplexes. We first analyzed the structural and functional consequences of the loss of complex IV on the composition and integrity of the supercomplexes L and S. Patient P1 harbored a genetic alteration in the SURF1 gene (homozygous 758del2bp, patient 12 in Ref. 14Tiranti V. Hoertnagel K. Carrozzo R. Galimberti C. Munaro M. Granatiero M. Zelante L. Gasparini P. Marzella R. Rocchi M. Bayona-Bafaluy M.P. Enriquez J.A. Uziel G. Bertini E. Dionisi-Vici C. Franco B. Meitinger T. Zeviani M. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) associated with classical Leigh syndrome and severe complex IV deficiency. This patient showed normal amounts of individual complexes except for complex IV that was selectively reduced to 10% (Table I). A considerable fraction of this 10% residual complex IV was stably assembled into supercomplex L (Fig. 2A), but the ratio of complexes L and S was altered compared with the control (Fig. 1B). In the control, the staining intensity of complex S was less than that of complex L, whereas the intensities were inverted for the patient. This indicated that the loss of complex IV reduced the amounts of supercomplex L and correspondingly increased stable supercomplex S. However, it did not influence the steady-state levels of complexes I and III as quantified in two-dimensional gels using dodecylmaltoside for solubilization (Table I). Thus, complexes I and III form the stable core of respirasomes to which complex IV can bind also.Table IAmounts of respiratory chain complexes in the muscle of patients relative to controlsPatientGenetic defectComplex IComplex IIIComplex IV%%%P1SURF1887810P2Unknown<2012691P3Cytochrome b<20<1575P4Cytochrome b<20<1579Controls (n = 5)100 ± 23100 ± 8100 ± 10 Open table in a new tab Next, we investigated the fate of the individual respiratory chain complexes in patients with a primary defect located in complex I or complex III. It can be assumed that loss of either complex I or complex III leads to the absence of the stable core structure. In a patient (P2) carrying an isolated deficiency of complex I the supercomplexes S and L and individual complex I were absent. Complexes III, IV, and V were found in normal amounts as individual complexes (Fig. 2B and Table I). Thus, the presence of fully assembled complex I is not essential for the assembly and stability of complexes III, IV, and V. Isolated complex III deficiencies can be caused by mutations in cytochrome b, the only mitochondrially encoded subunit of complex III. A heteroplasmic G290D mutation in the cytochrome b gene of patient P3 (80% mutated mtDNA in muscle) was previously found to be associated with impaired assembly of complex III and progressive exercise intolerance (15Bouzidi M.F. Schagger H. Collombet J.M. Carrier H. Flocard F. Quard S. Mousson B. Godinot C. Neuromusc. Disord. 1993; 3: 599-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Bouzidi M.F. Carrier H.

Probes. 1996; 10: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In another patient, P4, a 4-base-pair deletion generating truncated cytochrome b (85% mutated mtDNA in muscle) was associated with Parkinsonism/MELAS overlap syndrome (18De Coo I.F. Renier W.O. Ruitenbeek W. Ter Laak H.J. Bakker M. Schagger H. Van Oost B.A. Smeets H.J. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 45: 130-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In both patients, complex III was severely reduced or even below the detection limit; complexes IV and V were found at normal levels (Fig. 2, C and D and Table I). Dimeric complex V was detected in Fig. 2C, although the dimeric form was not found for other patients. This is explained by the variation of the actual digitonin/protein ratio because of the preparation of mitochondrial sediments in different laboratories. It does not affect the recovery of oxidative phosphorylation complexes (see also “Experimental Procedures”). Notably, complex I was almost completely lacking, with only a minimal fraction assembled into supercomplex L that is somewhat larger than dimeric complex V (Fig. 2C). These data indicate a specific role of the I/III core complex in the assembly and stability of complex I. In particular, the presence of complex III is required for the assembly/stability of complex I. However, complex III can be stable in the absence of complex I, as described above, although combined deficiencies of complexes I and III associated with mutations in the nuclear NDUFS4 gene for a complex I subunit have also been observed (19Budde S.M. van den Heuvel L.P. Janssen A.J. Smeets R.J. Buskens C.A. DeMeirleir L. Van Coster R. Baethmann M. Voit T. Trijbels J.M. Smeitink J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2000; 275: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We asked whether complex I subunits were never assembled and thus degraded. A polyclonal antibody against bovine complex I was used for the detection of complex I subunits on Western blots (Fig. 3) for a control individual (comparable with Fig. 1A) and for patient 4 (duplicate gel of Fig. 2D). On the control blot (Fig. 3A) we found the largest 75-kDa subunit of complex I at four different locations. 1) Highest signal intensity was found at the location of complex I (Fig. 3A, 1). 2) A signal close to the size of complex III (Fig. 3A, 2) indicated the presence of a subcomplex of complex I with an apparent mass of ∼500 kDa. The presence of a subcomplex, and not an oligomeric form of the 75-kDa subunit, is evident from the additional detection of a weak signal for the 51-kDa subunit. At present it is not known if this subcomplex represents a stable assembly intermediate or is dissociated from complex I under the conditions of BN-PAGE. 3) A potential subcomplex (Fig. 3A, 3) showed an apparent mass of ∼400 kDa. 4) A spot close to the running front (Fig. 3A, 4) presumably represented the individual 75-kDa subunit. Overall reduced signal intensities on the blot for the patient (Fig. 3B) indicated reduced amounts of complex I, which is in accordance with the densitometric data given in Table I, and suggested that complex I has not been stably assembled and thus was rapidly degraded. These data implied that complex III defects that involve not just catalytic activity but also the assembly of the multiprotein complex will always present as combined deficiencies of complex III and I in humans and should not present as isolated enzyme deficiencies. To confirm this hypothesis, we screened skeletal muscle biopsies of more than 100 patients with neuromuscular disorders by two-dimensional gel analysis for the assembly of the respiratory chain complexes. More than 30 patients with multiple deficiencies of two or more complexes, 9 with isolated complex I deficiencies, 9 with isolated complex IV deficiencies, and 4 with isolated complex V deficiencies were identified. Thus, an individual loss of complex I, or complex IV, or complex V appears not to affect assembly/stability of the other complexes in general. We found two combined deficiencies of complex III/I (patients P3 and P4). However, we could not find any isolated complex III deficiency suggesting that defects in the correct assembly of complex III may always cause combined deficiencies of complexes III and I. Surprisingly, the parallel severe reduction of the steady-state levels of assembled complexes III and I in patients P3 and P4, as based on the two-dimensional gel analysis (Table I), is not stringently mirrored by enzymatic activities determined in the respective muscle tissues. The catalytic activities of complex III were significantly reduced in patients P3 and P4 (21 and 9% of the control average, respectively; Table II, No. 1 and 2). Thus, these enzymatic measurements are in good accordance with the data derived from two-dimensional gel analysis (Table I, P3 and P4). However, the parallel loss of complex I at the protein level did not lead to a significant reduction in the enzymatic activity of complex I. For both patients complex I activity was low but within the control range (Table II); therefore, both cases had been initially classified as isolated complex III deficiencies. We asked whether a similar observation has been made for other patients with assembly deficiency of complex III. From the large number of described complex III deficiencies we selected mutations in the BCS1L and cytochrome b genes. 2Wallace, D. C., and Lott, M. T.

Open table in a new tab From the large number of cytochrome b mutations we selected nonsense mutations, because missense mutations were rarely analyzed for complex III assembly, and a normally assembled non-functional complex III is not expected to influence assembly/stability of complex I. From nine cases with nonsense mutations in the cytochrome b gene (Table II, Nos. 3–11), two have been classified as combined deficiencies of complexes III and I as detected by enzymatic means (Nos. 3 and 4). With five cases (Table II, Nos. 5–9) that have been classified as isolated complex III deficiencies, a parallel reduction of complex III and complex I activities seems not to be convincingly excluded. A deficiency of complex III was documented using various analytic techniques, but complex I activity was not determined or described as normal without giving data, or complexes III and I were comparably reduced (Table II, No. 9). The data for two cases (Table II, Nos. 10 and 11) seemed not to be in accordance with our proposal that an assembly deficiency of complex III is always paralleled by a secondary deficiency of complex I, because complex III was considerably reduced, whereas complex I was just within or below the normal range. However, the enzymatic data for these patients very much resemble the data for patients P3 and P4 in this work (Table II, Nos. 1 and 2) that initially were classified as isolated complex III deficiencies as detected by enzymatic assays but here were identified as combined deficiencies of complexes III and I using two-dimensional gel analysis. This suggests that not all combined complex III/I defects as demonstrated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis will be clearly identified by enzymatic means. Several reasons may account for this difficulty. A major point is that even low steady-state levels of assembled complex I may be sufficient to achieve enzymatic activities within the broad normal range. Furthermore, using rotenone-sensitive NADH oxidation as a measure for complex I may be critical especially for the low activity range, because a superoxide generating NADH-dependent oxidase from skeletal muscle sarcoplasmatic reticulum, a common contaminant in mitochondrial preparations, was found recently to be highly sensitive to rotenone (23Xia R. Webb J.A. Gnall L.L. Cutler K. Abramson J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C215-C221Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In summary, in human skeletal muscle the entire portion of complex I is found to stably interact with complex III thereby forming functional respirasomes in the mitochondrial inner membrane. The loss of complex III prevented respirasome formation and led to a secondary significant reduction of complex I in the two cases available for two-dimensional electrophoresis. Thus, we propose that primary genetic defects of complex III, if characterized by an assembly deficiency of complex III, must present as combined complex III/I defects at the protein level. In a parallel and independent study Acin-Pérez et al. (24Acin-Perez R. Bayona-Bafaluy M.P. Fernandez-Silva P. Moreno-Loshuertos R. Perez-Martos A. Bruno C. Moraes C.T. Enriquez J.A. Molecular Cell. 2004; 13: 805-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) recently came to the same conclusion. Despite a severe reduction at the protein level, complex I activities might appear near normal. This specific aspect has to be considered when diagnosing complex III deficiencies. Isolated complex III deficiency does occur with functional deficiencies of complex III that do not affect assembly of complex III. Combined complex I/III defects associated with alterations in the NDUFS4 protein of complex I have been observed, and explanations for this combined deficiency have been presented (19Budde S.M. van den Heuvel L.P. Janssen A.J. Smeets R.J. Buskens C.A. DeMeirleir L. Van Coster R. Baethmann M. Voit T. Trijbels J.M. Smeitink J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2000; 275: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the truncated NDUFS4 protein may interfere with the formation of supercomplexes thereby leading to a combined deficiency of complexes I and III, or enhanced radical production caused by complex I deficiency may have a secondary influence on complex III activity. Further studies to obtain a definite explanation for these specific complex I/III defects will be required. We thank Kathy Pfeiffer and Christian Bach for excellent technical support."

NO is transient, small, and easily diffusible; its availability is solely regulated at the synthesis level by the nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes (EC 1.14.13.39). In mammals, two constitutively expressed NOS isozymes (cNOSs), endothelial (eNOS) and neuronal NOS (nNOS), are Ca2+-responsive and control basal NO levels, whereas the Ca2+-insensitive inducible NOS (iNOS) is expressed in response to specific cytokines or bacterial products (2Mayer B. Hemmens B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 477-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Deregulation of NO synthesis is associated with diverse human pathologies including immune-type diabetes, stroke, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and infection susceptibility (3Chiueh C.C.

Each chain of a NOS homodimer (Fig. 1a) contains an N-terminal catalytic oxygenase module (NOSox) and a C-terminal electron-supplying reductase module (NOSred) linked by a 32-residue Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) binding region (4Abu-Soud H.M.

NOSox accepts electrons from NOSred to catalyze the sequential monooxygenation of l-arginine into N-hydroxyarginine, then citrulline and NO. NOSred belongs to a large protein family that includes NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 reductase (CYPOR), sulfite reductase flavoprotein and novel reductase 1. These reductases share a conserved organization of flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-binding domains (13Wang M.

The FMN-binding domain is homologous to small electron-carrier flavodoxins (16Watenpaugh K.D. Sieker L.C. Jensen L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 3857-3860Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), whereas the FAD- and NADPH-binding domains associate into a “FNR-like unit,” related to ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (17Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriott J.R. Science. 1991; 251: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). An α-helical connecting domain (CD) orients the flanking FMN- and FAD-binding domains to align the two flavins (13Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In all isozymes, a 21-42-residue C-terminal tail (CT) represses electron transfer. In addition, the cNOSs contain a 42-45-residue autoinhibitory insert (AH) in the FMN-binding domain that interferes with CaM binding and inhibits both intra- and inter-module electron transfers. Phosphorylation of both of these regulatory elements further modulates cNOS activity. Last, the CD2A regulatory element present in the CD of the cNOSs is predicted to contribute to the observed Ca2+/CaM dependence by interaction with the CaM-binding peptide (22Knudsen G.M.

The recent structure of a proteolytic fragment of NOSred (23Zhang J. Martasek P. Paschke R. Shea T. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.J. J. Biol.

Here, we address these questions by determining and analyzing the x-ray structure of a fully assembled reductase dimer of nNOS. These results provide insights into the molecular interactions that enable a newly identified autoinhibitory helix motif, co-substrate NADPH, the C-terminal tail and its phosphorylation site, to regulate NOS activity. Biochemical data, when combined with these structural results, further suggest a possible model for holoenzyme assembly, in which the FMN domain undergoes large scale movements to shuttle electrons between the two NOS modules. nNOSred Expression, Purification, Activity Measurements, and Microspectral Characterization—Rat nNOSred Δ18 (construct 741-1429) was expressed in Pichia pastoris (24Gachhui R. Presta A. Bentley D.F. Abu-Soud H.M. McArthur R. Brudvig G. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20594-20602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). nNOSred wild-type and R1400E mutant were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified as described (18Adak S.

The redox state of the flavins in the crystal was determined by using a single-crystal microspectrophotometer before and after x-ray diffraction (Supplementary Methods). Dynamic Light Scattering and Crystallization—Dynamic light scattering was performed with a DynaPro-801 (Protein Solutions) instrument at 20 °C (Supplementary Methods). nNOSred was crystallized in the P1 space group at 20 °C in an anaerobic glove-box using the vapor diffusion method (Supplementary Methods). Diffraction Data Collection, Processing, and Refinement—X-ray diffraction data for nNOSred were collected at SSRL on beamline 11-1. The structure was solved by molecular replacement, followed by fitting and refinement to current R and free R factors of 24.4 and 27.2%, respectively (Table I and Supplementary Methods).

Open table in a new tab Neuronal NOSred Structure and Architecture—To characterize the molecular basis for NOSred function, we solved the crystallographic structure of a fully assembled nNOSred module at 2.3 Å resolution (Fig. 1b). We used the structure of CYPOR (13Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), without its FMN domain, as a starting model for molecular replacement and manually built the nNOS FMN domain into the electron density. After iterative cycles of fitting and refinement, the final model shows good statistics with R and free R factors of 24.4 and 27.2%, respectively, and good geometry with 99.5% of the residues in the most favored and additional allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (see Table I). The structure reveals 4 major domains: FMN binding domain (residues 750-942), connecting domain (943-989 and 1039-1170) with a flexible hinge (943-967) and a β-finger (1059-1078), FAD binding domain (990-1038 and 1171-1231) and NADPH binding (1232-1396) domain (Fig. 2). Unexpectedly, in both our crystallographic structure (Fig. 1c) and in solution, as measured by dynamic light scattering (see Supplementary Methods), nNOSred is a homodimer, suitable for assembly within dimeric holo-NOS (see “Discussion”). NADP(H) Binding Site and Site-directed Mutagenesis—In the NADPH-binding domain, co-substrate NADP(H) binds at one end of the five-stranded parallel β-sheet (Fig. 1b), as in related reductases (13Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 14Gruez A. Pignol D. Zeghouf M. Coves J.

Science. 1991; 251: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The ribityl-nicotinamide moiety is solvent-exposed (Fig. 3a, right), does not stack with the FAD alloxazine ring, and presents slightly different conformations in the two nNOSred molecules, highlighting its flexibility. In contrast, the adenosine moiety (Fig. 3a, left) binds similarly in both halves of the dimer through hydrophobic stacking interactions with Tyr1322, and hydrogen bonds to conserved Gln1324 and two well ordered water molecules. The negatively charged phosphate groups of NADP(H) are anchored by an extensive network of ionic interactions, including cNOS-specific Arg1400 from the regulatory C-terminal tail (Fig. 3a, top center). The salt bridges from the guanidinium group of nNOS Arg1400 to the 2′-phosphate group of NADP(H) are particularly intriguing, as this Arg is also conserved in eNOS, but not iNOS (Fig. 2), and this phosphate distinguishes NADPH from NADH. We therefore mutated cNOS-specific Arg1400 of the nNOS C-terminal tail to test its role in NADPH binding and NOS repression. The R1400E mutant protein displays markedly greater (5-fold) rates of electron transfer to cytochrome c in the absence of Ca2+/CaM, and decreased Ca2+/CaM dependence compared with the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3b). The observed NADP(H) binding mode and interactions with Arg1400 thus provide a structural basis for the role of both this co-substrate and cNOS-specific Arg1400 residue in repression and CaM activation of NOS (see “Discussion”). Flavin Binding Sites and X-ray-induced Reduction—FAD, which accepts electrons from NADPH and transfers them to FMN, binds in an elongated conformation (Fig. 3a, center) at one end of the flattened anti-parallel β-barrel fold of the FAD-binding domain (Fig. 1b), as in related FNR (17Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriott J.R. Science. 1991; 251: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The FMN is inserted into the flavodoxin-like FMN-binding domain (16Watenpaugh K.D. Sieker L.C. Jensen L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 3857-3860Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), consisting of a five-stranded parallel β-sheet flanked by five α-helices (Fig. 1b). Extensive networks of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic stacking interactions (Figs. 2 and 3a), as described for CYPOR (13Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8411-8416Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), stabilize both cofactors. In the nNOSred structure (Fig. 3a), extended hydrogen-bonding networks incorporating the flavins reveal that: (i) FMN N5 is a hydrogen bond donor to the main chain carbonyl of Gly810 (“O-up” conformation (25Smith W.W. Burnett R.M. Darling G.D. Ludwig M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 195-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar)), and is thus protonated; (ii) FMN N1 has no hydrogen-bonding partner; (iii) FAD N5 makes a long hydrogen bond (3.6 Å) to Ser1176 side chain hydroxyl; and (iv) FAD N1 hydrogen bonds to a conserved water molecule, proposed to be important for catalysis in CYPOR (26Hubbard P.A. Shen A.L. Paschke R. Kasper C.B. Kim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29163-29170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). These structural results reveal that the FMN is likely present as the semiquinone species, consistent with the spectral properties of the resting state of NOS in solution. To unambiguously determine the FAD redox state, we used single-crystal microspectrophotometry (Supplementary Methods). Reduction of the flavins occurs quickly in the intense synchrotron x-ray beam, and the disappearance of the absorption band at 457 nm unequivocally shows that no oxidized species is present after 2 h exposure (Fig. 3c). Our combined structural and microspectral studies thus show that the structure (determined from 17 h of data collection) represents the one-electron-reduced FMN semiquinone and either the FAD doubly reduced hydroquinone or a mixture of semiquinone/hydroquinone species, corresponding to one of the proposed (27Craig D.H. Chapman S.K. Daff S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33987-33994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) catalytic intermediates. The FMN/FAD Domain Interface and Rotational Flexibility of the FMN Domain—The FMN/FAD interface is created by plugging the flavin-containing face of the FMN-binding domain into the deep cup-shaped surface (Fig. 1b) formed by the FAD, NADPH, and connecting domains (referred to here as the FNR/CD unit). At the center of this interface (burying a total surface of 2500 Å2), the FMN- and FAD-binding domains interact through a double salt bridge between residues Glu816 and Arg1229, which are both conserved in cNOSs (Fig. 2). Other interactions include hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonds (Supplementary Materials Table S1). On one side of the FNR/CD “cup,” the autoinhibitory insert of the FMN domain contacts the FMN- and NADPH-binding domains (Supplementary Materials Table S2). On the other side, the CD braces the FMN- and FAD-binding domains, as seen in CYPOR, to help align the alloxazine rings of the two flavin cofactors (Fig. 1b). In fact, the xylene ring methyl groups of the cofactors are only 4.8 Å apart (Fig. 3a), suggesting direct electron transfer from FAD to FMN in this electron-accepting position. The FMN is completely buried in this FMN/FAD interface, inhibiting subsequent flow of electrons from FMN to the heme or other electron acceptors. The two FMN-binding domains of the two crystallographically independent NOSred modules exhibit 4° rotations relative to each other, mimicking an elbow joint within the concave interface of the FNR/CD unit (Fig. 4a). These rigid-body rotations are unexplained by crystal packing. Conformational diversity in NOSred is further evident from weakly defined electron density for parts of the CD, including the hinge (residues 943-967) linking the FMN domain to the CD, and the protruding β-finger (1059-1078) containing the CD2A regulatory element. The two FMN-binding domains have also higher (71 Å2) than average (57 Å2) overall crystallographic temperature factors. The observed rotational flexibility of the FMN domains has important functional implications (see “Discussion”). Unique NOSred Regulatory Elements—This fully assembled NOSred structure extends the structure of the NOSred proteolytic fragment (23Zhang J. Martasek P. Paschke R. Shea T. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37506-37513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) to include not only the missing FMN-binding domain and the dimer assembly but also key parts of three unique regulatory elements: the FMN domain autoinhibitory insert, the C-terminal tail, and its Ser1412 phosphorylation site. The FMN domain autoinhibitory insert unexpectedly contains an α-helix (residues 840-848), sequestered into a hydrophobic pocket formed between FMN-binding domain helices α4 and α6, and NADPH-binding domain helix α24 (Fig. 1b). Conserved residues from these α-helices make hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding contacts with the autoinhibitory insert (Supplementary Materials Table S2). Ser840 N-caps the helix by hydrogen bonding to the Lys842 backbone amide. Surprisingly, the ordered region (residues 836-849) of the autoinhibitory insert is flanked by 5 unstructured N-terminal residues and 23 unstructured C-terminal residues. To make the covalent connections to the FMN domain, these disordered N- and C-terminal regions must span 9 and 29 Å distances, respectively. The regulatory C-terminal tail similarly contains an α-helix (residues 1401-1412), which fits within a negatively charged groove across the FAD/FMN interface, shielding the flavins from solvent (Fig. 4, a-c). Ordered C-terminal tail residues (1397-1413) extend from the last β-strand of the NADPH-binding domain and form a right-angle turn at Arg1400 followed by an α-helix (1401-1412), which is terminated by the regulatory Ser1412 phosphorylation site (Figs. 1b and 4c). C-terminal tail residues 1397-1400 are stitched to the FMN- and NADPH-binding domains via hydrogen bonds with residues Tyr889 and Asp1351, respectively, and ionic interactions with NADP(H), all of which help to “lock” the FMN domain into its electron-accepting position (Fig. 4b). Extensive hydrophobic interactions with FMN-binding domain and CD residues (Supplementary Materials Table S3) further anchor the C-terminal tail. At the end of the C-terminal α-helix, the phosphorylatable O-γ atom of Ser1412 is directed toward negatively charged FMN-binding domain residues Glu916 (Gln in eNOS) and conserved Asp918 (Figs. 2 and 4c). This structure thus suggests a mechanism for phosphorylation-induced NOS activation by electrostatically induced conformational changes. Quaternary Structure of NOSred—Our structural and biochemical studies reveal that nNOSred is dimeric (Fig. 1c). This is in contrast with earlier studies suggesting that NOSox alone mediates dimerization (28Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Pitters E. Moloney M. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10609-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The extensive (3200 Å2 buried surface), nearly symmetric, dimer interface is consistent with yeast two-hybrid studies (29Venema R.C. Ju H. Zou R. Ryan J.W. Venema V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1276-1282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) that indicate significant dimer association in nNOSred and eNOSred, but not in iNOSred. The iNOSred sequence lacks the ability to make all salt bridges and 5 of 8 hydrogen bonds found across the nNOSred dimer interface (Fig. 2). Because dimerization is required for NOS activity (30Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this distinction among the NOS isoforms may be of considerable biochemical and therapeutic interest. A Swinging FMN Domain Mechanism for Electron Shuttling—The intact NOSred structure provides unique insights into the mechanism of inter-module electron transfer (FMN to heme), which is the rate-limiting step (19Miller R.T. Martasek P. Omura T. Siler Masters B.S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) in NO synthesis by CaM-bound full-length NOS. The observed buried “electron accepting” (from FAD) position for the FMN cofactor, which is sandwiched between the FMN-binding domain and the FNR/CD unit (Fig. 1b), raises an important question: how will the electrons get transferred from FMN to heme? No arrangement of NOSox and NOSred will overcome the problem of the buried FMN cofactor, but mobility of the FMN-binding domain provides a solution. Conformational diversity of the FMN-binding domain in reductase modules is observed not only between the two nNOSred monomers, but also by comparison with CYPOR (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, in several CYPOR mutants (26Hubbard P.A. Shen A.L. Paschke R. Kasper C.B. Kim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29163-29170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and sulfite reductase flavoprotein (14Gruez A. Pignol D. Zeghouf M. Coves J. Fontecave M. Ferrer J.-L. Fontecilla-Camps J.-C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) structures, the electron density for the FMN domain is completely missing. Fluorescence increases in nNOS upon CaM binding or addition of chaotropic agents also indicate that conformational changes are limited to the FMN-binding domain (18Adak S. Ghosh S. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22313-22320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31Narayanasami R. Nishimura J.S. McMillan K. Roman L.J. Shea T.M. Robida A.M. Horowitz P.M. Masters B.S.S. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These combined results all support a mechanism for electron transfer in which the conformational mobility of the FMN-binding domain is a key component of catalysis and a common feature among members of this family of reductases. We evaluated structurally allowed pathways for intermodule electron transfer from FMN to heme within holo-NOS. An experimentally determined structure of full-length NOS remains elusive because of difficulties in obtaining suitable crystals, consistent with our results indicating functionally important flexible components. To make a model for the homodimeric holoenzyme (without the PDZ domains), we used known biochemical data to assemble the structures of its components parts: the dimeric NOSox and NOSred modules, and a CaM: NOS-peptide complex (32Aoyagi M. Arvai A.S. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 766-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We rotated and translated the NOSox module and CaM: NOS-peptide complex with respect to the NOSred module to fit the constraints required by the short covalent connections from NOSox to NOSred through the CaM-binding region. Families of models with the C terminus of NOSox and the N terminus of NOSred at opposite sides of the molecule were ruled out because the large separation (distance ∼80 Å) between these termini (Fig. 5a, model 1, top to bottom; model 2, back to front) is incompatible with the short length (∼30 Å) of the intervening mostly α-helical CaM-binding linker. Only families of models in which the NOSox C terminus is oriented facing the NOSred N terminus (Fig. 5a, model 3) had an intervening distance (∼47 Å) that is easily compatible with the expected length of the intervening nNOS CaM-binding linker. The flexible nature of this linker is consistent with biochemical data indicating that this region is susceptible to proteolytic cleavage (33Lowe P.N. Smith D. Stammers D.K. Riveros-Moreno V. Moncada S. Charles I. Boyhan A. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this family of models, the polypeptide chains cross each other, and the short CaM-binding linker brings together opposing NOSox and NOSred modules (Fig. 5a, right). The known transfer of electrons in trans from NOSred to NOSox across the dimer (20Siddhanta U. Wu C. Abu-Soud H.M. Zhang J. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7309-7312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) imposes further constraints on possible rotations of the two modules along a vertical axis. In our proposed assembly, the shortest distance between the FMN and heme cofactors is ∼70 Å, which is substanti"

TRAIL is a promising candidate for cancer therapeutics due to its ability to induce apoptosis selectively in cancer cells. Here, we report that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) such as trichostatin A (TSA), sodium butyrate, and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) upregulated DR5 expression in various human malignant tumor cells. An RNase protection assay demonstrated that HDACIs induced DR5 mRNA markedly but not that of other death receptor family members in Jurkat cells. HDACIs increased DR5 mRNA and protein in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We also show TSA increased DR5 promoter activity using a luciferase promoter assay. Furthermore, we demonstrated that HDACIs strongly sensitized exogenous soluble recombinant human TRAIL-induced apoptosis synergistically in Jurkat and HL-60 cells that were tolerant to TRAIL alone. The combined use of HDACIs and TRAIL in suboptimal concentrations induced Bid cleavage and activation of caspase-8, -10, -3, and -9. Human recombinant DR5/Fc chimera protein, zVAD-fmk pancaspase inhibitor, and caspase-8 and -10 inhibitors efficiently reduced apoptosis induced by cotreatment with HDACIs and TRAIL. Furthermore, TSA did not significantly induce DR5 protein and HDACIs did not enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These results suggest that this combined treatment with HDACIs and TRAIL is a promising strategy for new cancer therapeutics."

We reasoned that spontaneous chromosome breaks may facilitate vector integration and investigated this in cells containing a specific chromosomal double-strand break created by the endonuclease I-SceI or multiple breaks created by treatment with etoposide or γ-irradiation. Vector proviruses were found at I-SceI cleavage sites, and sequencing of vector-chromosome junctions detected microhomologies, deletions and insertions that were similar when integration occurred spontaneously at random locations or at induced double-strand breaks. Infection with AAV vectors did not increase mutation rates in normal human cells. Our results establish a mechanism for integration and suggest that AAV vectors can integrate at existing chromosome breaks rather than causing breaks themselves, which has implications for their clinical use."

Here we have utilized the availability of UCP1-ablated mice to dissect UCP1-dependent and UCP1-independent effects of regulators. Using a complex-I-linked substrate (pyruvate), we found that UCP1 can mediate a 4-fold increase in thermogenesis when stimulated with the classical positive regulator fatty acids (oleate). After demonstrating that the fatty acids act in their free form, we found that UCP1 increased fatty acid sensitivity ∼30-fold (as compared with the 1.5-fold increase reported earlier based on nominal fatty acid values). By identifying the UCP1-mediated fraction of the response, we could conclude that the interaction between purine nucleotides (GDP) and fatty acids (oleate) unexpectedly displayed simple competitive kinetics. In GDP-inhibited mitochondria, oleate apparently acted as an activator. However, only a model in which UCP1 is inherently active (i.e.“activating” fatty acids cannot be included in the model), where GDP functions as an inhibitor with a Km of 0.05 mm, and where oleate functions as a competitive antagonist for the GDP effect (with a Ki of 5 nm) can fit all of the experimental data.

Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) 1The abbreviations used are: UCP1, uncoupling protein 1; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. is essential for the phenomenon of classical nonshivering thermogenesis (1Nedergaard J.

Rev. 2004; 84: 277-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (4568) Google Scholar). When chronically exposed to cold, animals that can recruit UCP1 in their brown-adipose tissue will initially shiver but will then successively increase their capacity for nonshivering thermogenesis and ultimately cease shivering. Mice that lack UCP1 (3Enerbäck S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.-E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) never cease shivering in the cold (4Golozoubova V. Hohtola E. Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2048-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Thus, no other process or protein can replace UCP1 in its physiological thermogenic function. Brown-fat cells from animals that can express UCP1 respond to stimulation with the physiological activator norepinephrine with at least a 5-fold increase in the rate of oxygen consumption (5Prusiner S.B. Cannon B. Lindberg O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 6: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 6Matthias A. Ohlson K.E.B. Fredriksson J.M. Jacobsson A. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. J. Biol.

Nature. 1977; 267: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In contrast, there is no detectable effect of norepinephrine on heat production in brown-fat cells that lack UCP1 (6Matthias A.

Thus, UCP1 is essential for the ability of brown-fat cells to produce heat. Exogenous fatty acids can also stimulate respiration to the same 5-fold extent as can norepinephrine in normal brown-fat cells (5Prusiner S.B. Cannon B. Lindberg O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 6: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 6Matthias A. Ohlson K.E.B. Fredriksson J.M. Jacobsson A. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. J. Biol.

In brown-fat cells that lack UCP1, fatty acids are without effect (6Matthias A. Ohlson K.E.B. Fredriksson J.M. Jacobsson A. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25073-25081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The responses to fatty acids are of particular interest, because fatty acids are classically considered as positive modulators of UCP1 activity (9Rafael J. Ludolph H.J. Hohorst H.J. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1969; 350: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 10Cannon B. Nicholls D.G. Lindberg O. Azzone G.F. Mechanisms in Bioenergetics.

Biochem. 1983; 173: 197-203Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and it is generally accepted that it is via an increase in endogenous fatty acids that norepinephrine stimulates thermogenesis (2Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 277-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (4568) Google Scholar). In brown-fat mitochondria, the situation is less clear. Undoubtedly, the high “uncoupled” rate of respiration that is found in isolated brown-fat mitochondria that contain UCP1 is not found in brown-fat mitochondria without UCP1 (12Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28150-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 13Monemdjou S. Kozak L.P. Harper M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E1073-E1082PubMed Google Scholar). Fatty acids can induce uncoupling in all mitochondria (14Wojtczak L. Wieckowski M.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and not just UCP1-containing brown-fat mitochondria, but the presence of UCP1 should nonetheless be expected to induce dramatic effects in the fatty acid sensitivity of brown-fat mitochondria. However, the reported effects of UCP1 on the fatty acid sensitivity of brown-fat mitochondria have been minor (12Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28150-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 15Hofmann W.E. Liu X. Bearden C.M. Harper M.E. Kozak L.P. J. Biol.

For example, when fatty acid-induced de-energization was investigated, the reported difference between brown-fat mitochondria with and without UCP1 was only ∼1.5-fold (but with a 50-fold difference between brown-fat mitochondria without UCP1 and liver mitochondria) (12Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28150-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 15Hofmann W.E. Liu X. Bearden C.M. Harper M.E.

Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 756-763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, when thermogenesis was assessed as the fatty acid-induced increase in the rate of oxygen consumption, the total increase caused by fatty acid corresponded only to an increase of 25–75% compared with the 5-fold increase seen in brown-fat cells, and the difference in sensitivity to added fatty acids was also small (approximately a factor 2) (12Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28150-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 15Hofmann W.E. Liu X. Bearden C.M. Harper M.E.

Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 756-763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the data so far published comparing brown-fat mitochondria with and without UCP1 are not adequate to explain the role of fatty acids as a regulator of UCP1. In this context, it is noteworthy that recently a series of alternative UCP1 activators have been proposed, including retinoic acid (17Rial E. Gonzalez-Barroso M. Fleury C. Iturrizaga S. Sanchis D. Jimenez-Jimenez J. Ricquier D. Goubern M. Bouillaud F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5827-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), ubiquinone (18Echtay K.S. Winkler E. Klingenberg M. Nature. 2000; 408: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), superoxide (19Echtay K.S. Roussel D. St-Pierre J. Jekabsons M.B. Cadenas S. Stuart J.A. Harper J.A. Roebuck S.J. Morrison A. Pickering S. Clapham J.C. Brand M.D. Nature. 2002; 415: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar), and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (20Echtay K.S. Esteves T.C. Pakay J.L. Jekabsons M.B. Lambert A.J. Portero-Otin M. Pamplona R. Vidal-Puig A.J. Wang S. Roebuck S.J. Brand M.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4103-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Considering the relatively small effects of fatty acids on UCP1 reported so far, the possibility could be raised that these substances would better fill the role as physiological activators of UCP1. However, in order to distinguish between regulatory and oxidative effects of fatty acids, all of the experiments published to date on effects of fatty acids on mitochondria from UCP1-ablated animals have been performed with glycerol 3-phosphate as substrate. Because thermogenesis is dependent on brown-fat mitochondria respiring on complex I-linked substrates present in the matrix (mainly fatty acid derivatives), we have here examined whether our understanding of UCP1 function could be enhanced if a complex I-linked substrate was used in the investigations. Animals—UCP1-ablated mice, originally on a mixed 129/SvPas and C57Bl/6 background (progeny of those described previously (3Enerbäck S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.-E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar)), were backcrossed to C57Bl/6 for 10 generations. These mice were then intercrossed to obtain two mouse strains: UCP1(–/–) and UCP1(+/+). Southern blot analysis of DNA with the short-arm probes (3Enerbäck S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.-E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) was used for genotyping of the mice. In the brown-adipose tissue of the UCP1(–/–) mouse strain finally obtained, no UCP1 was detected with polyclonal antibodies (data not shown). Because no effect of genetic background on parameters used for our analysis was evident, principally in agreement with results reported previously (15Hofmann W.E. Liu X. Bearden C.M. Harper M.E. Kozak L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12460-12465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), some of the initial data obtained with the standard (UCP1(+/+)) C57Bl/6 strain and with UCP1(–/–) on the originally mixed (C57Bl/6 and 129/SvPas) genetic background were included in the data presented here. The mice were fed ad libitum (R70 standard diet, Lactamin), had free access to water, and were kept on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. No differences in normal growth were detected between the UCP1(–/–) and UCP1(+/+) strains at normal (24 °C) animal house temperature. Adult (8–12-week-old) male mice were used for the experiments. The experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the North Stockholm region. Mitochondrial Preparation—Brown-fat mitochondria were prepared principally as described previously (21Cannon B. Lindberg O. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Routinely, on each experimental day, five wild type and/or 5 UCP1-ablated mice were anesthetized for 1–2 min by a mixture of 79% CO2 and 21% O2 and decapitated. The interscapular, periaortic, axillary, and cervical brown-adipose tissue depots were dissected out and cleaned from white adipose tissue, nerves, and connective tissue and pooled in ice-cold 250 mm sucrose solution. Throughout the isolation process, the tissue was kept at 0–4 °C. The tissue was minced with scissors, homogenized in 40 ml of 250 mm sucrose solution, filtered through gauze, and centrifuged at 8500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant with the floating fat layer was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 250 mm sucrose containing 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was then centrifuged at 8500 × g for 10 min, and the resulting mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 125 mm sucrose. Mitochondrial protein concentration was measured using the fluorescamine method, and the suspensions were diluted to stock concentrations of 25 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml of 125 mm sucrose with 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. The mitochondrial suspensions were kept on ice and used for no more than 4 h. Oxygen Consumption—Isolated mitochondria, at a final concentration of 0.5 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml, were added to 1.1 ml of a continuously stirred incubation medium consisting of 125 mm sucrose, 20 mm K+-TES (pH 7.2), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 4 mm KPi, 3 mm malate, and 1.3 μg of oligomycin/ml. Oxygen consumption rates were monitored with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Yellow Springs Instrument Co.) in a sealed chamber at 37 °C. The output signal from the oxygen electrode amplifier was electronically time-differentiated and collected every 0.5 s by a Power-Lab/ADInstrument (application program Chart, version 4.1.1.). The Chart data files were transferred to the KaleidaGraph MacIntosh application and converted to absolute values based on an oxygen content of 217 nmol of O2/1 ml of water on the calibrated electronic differentiation constants and on the amount of mitochondrial protein used. For calculation of stable oxygen consumption rates, the mean values of ∼1 min were obtained from these recordings. Swelling—Mitochondrial swelling was monitored as the change in absorbance at 540 nm in an Aminco DW-2 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The mitochondrial incubation medium and the experimental conditions were those described for oxygen consumption experiments. The substrate was 5 mm pyruvate. Data Analysis—The free concentration of oleate was calculated using the equation used by Richieri et al. (22Richieri G.V. Anel A. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7574-7580Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) for the binding of oleate to bovine serum albumin at 37 °C: [free fatty acid] (nm) = 6.5n–0.19 + 0.13 exp(1.54n), where n is the molar ratio of oleate to albumin. Routinely, the albumin concentration in the incubation medium was 0.1% (i.e. 16.7 μm). The nominal levels of the oleate added were 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, and 120 μm. Thus, these levels transferred to free levels of 4, 8, 14, 21, 32, 56, 109, 236, 549, 1330, 3284, and 8183 nm. Because only the free purine nucleotide (ATP, ADP, GDP, or GTP) (i.e. not the Mg2+-nucleotide complex) is relevant for nucleotide binding to UCP1 (23Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 62: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 24Rafael J. Pampel I. Wang X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 25Klingenberg M. Echtay K.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 128-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), the values for free GDP were used in graphs and for calculation of kinetic parameters. Free GDP and Mg2+ concentrations in the incubation medium at 37 °C and pH 7.2 were calculated by use of a computer program for making buffers of a defined ion concentration, BAD 4 (26Brooks S.P. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The nominal levels of GDP added were 0.7, 1.0, 2.2, 3.5, and 4.8 mm. These levels transferred to the free levels of 0.24, 0.37, 0.78, 1.25, and 1.72 mm. The nominal concentration of Mg2+ was 2 mm. This concentration transfers to a free concentration of 0.23 mm in the presence of all of the medium components and 1 mm GDP. The concentration of free Mg2+ was adjusted to 0.2–0.3 mm in all of the experimental traces with different GDP concentrations by adding a calculated amount of MgCl2 to the incubation medium. Concentration-response curve data were analyzed with the general fit option of the KaleidaGraph application for MacIntosh for adherence to simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics, V(x) = basal + Vmax × (x/(Km + x)). To analyze the effect of albumin, Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Hill coefficient of 2 were used for fitting, V(x) = basal – Vmax × (x2/(K2m + x2)), in accordance with two of fatty acid-binding sites on albumin having nearly similar and high affinity (22Richieri G.V. Anel A. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7574-7580Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Chemicals—Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, fraction V, was from Roche Applied Science. Oleic acid (sodium salt), FCCP (carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), oligomycin, GDP (sodium salt), CDP (sodium salt), l-(–)malic acid (disodium salt), pyruvic acid (sodium salt), and EDTA were all from Sigma. GDP was dissolved in 20 mm TES (pH 7.2), and the solution was readjusted in pH. Fluorescamine (4-phenyl-spiro-[furan-2(3H), 1-phthalan]-3,3′-dione) was from Fluka. Carboxyatractyloside was from Calbiochem. FCCP was dissolved in 50% ethanol. Oligomycin was dissolved in 95% ethanol. Oleate (sodium salt) was dissolved in 50% ethanol, divided into small aliquots, and stored under nitrogen at –20 °C. Ethanol in a final concentration of 0.1% did not in itself have any effects on the parameters measured. Statistics—All of the data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical analysis for the comparison of two groups was performed using Student's t test. Relative Significance of UCP1 Depends on Oxidative Substrate Investigated—In earlier investigations of the UCP1-dependent components of thermogenesis in isolated brown-fat mitochondria, glycerol 3-phosphate was used as substrate (12Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28150-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 13Monemdjou S. Kozak L.P. Harper M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E1073-E1082PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hofmann W.E. Liu X. Bearden C.M. Harper M.E. Kozak L.P. J. Biol.

Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 756-763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the evident effects of the presence of UCP1 were seen, they were quantitatively relatively small, especially when the effects of fatty acids were investigated. There were very significant UCP1-dependent effects when the complex I-linked substrate, pyruvate, was used instead (Fig. 1). 2We also performed experiments with palmitoyl-carnitine as substrate, yielding principally similar results, but the respiratory rate was less stable than with pyruvate (data not shown). In Fig. 1A, it is seen that in brown-fat mitochondria without UCP1 (thin trace), the basal respiration was low and the addition of GDP was without effect but respiration could be markedly increased by FCCP. In brown-fat mitochondria with UCP1 (heavy trace), the initial rate of respiration was high and it was reduced 3–4-fold by GDP. However, the sensitivity of the mitochondria to FCCP was unaffected by the presence or absence of UCP1 (Fig. 1, A and B). Significance of UCP1 for Oleate-induced Respiration—As seen in Fig. 1C, oleate could stimulate pyruvate respiration in brown-fat mitochondria without UCP1 (thin trace), but the effect of oleate occurred at lower oleate concentrations and was larger in brown-fat mitochondria with UCP1 (heavy trace). From the compilation in Fig. 1D, it is evident that the presence of UCP1 led to a higher sensitivity to added oleate: from an EC50 of 91 ± 5 μm to an EC50 of 56 ± 2 μm (p ≤ 0.05), i.e. a 2-fold increase. However, it was also clear that, in the mitochondria with UCP1, fatty acids (oleate) could induce an increase in the rate of oxygen consumption that was almost 4-fold, i.e. a relative increase close to the fatty acid-induced increase in respiration seen in UCP1-containing brown-fat cells (6Matthias A. Ohlson K.E.B. Fredriksson J.M. Jacobsson A. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25073-25081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In comparison, the fatty acid-induced increase in oxygen consumption when glycerol 3-phosphate was used as substrate was only ∼30% (Fig. 1E), in agreement with earlier observations (12Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28150-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 15Hofmann W.E. Liu X. Bearden C.M. Harper M.E.

Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 756-763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No Inhibitory UCP1-dependent Effect of Fatty Acids—The maximum respiratory capacity of the mitochondria was clearly independent of the presence of UCP1 (Fig. 1B). However, the ability of oleate to stimulate pyruvate respiration was greater in UCP1-containing mitochondria than in mitochondria without UCP1 (Fig. 1D), which may be due to an inhibitory effect of high oleate concentrations. Therefore, we examined whether high oleate concentrations would affect the maximal rate of oxygen consumption observed after the addition of FCCP (as exemplified in Fig. 2A). As seen in mitochondria without UCP1 (Fig. 2B), the oleate concentrations necessary to induce full stimulation (> 80 μm) had an inhibitory effect on pyruvate oxidation. However, in brown-fat mitochondria with UCP1, a full restimulation was observed before any detrimental effect of oleate on pyruvate oxidation was evident (Fig. 2C). Oleate-induced Restimulation/Stimulation of Respiration Is Not Caused by Mitochondrial Disintegration—It may be envisaged that the restimulating/stimulating (“uncoupling”) effect of oleate was due to damage to the mitochondrial membrane associated with swelling of the mitochondria. UCP1 could influence the sensitivity of the mitochondria in this respect. Therefore, oleate-induced swelling in brown-fat mitochondria was analyzed as shown on Fig. 3A. No effect on mitochondrial volume was observed by the addition of nominal oleate amounts of up to ≈100 μm, i.e. the concentration range used in the experiments. The minimal concentration of oleate capable of inducing mitochondrial swelling was 120 μm and was independent of UCP1 (Fig. 3B). Similar concentration-response curves were observed for liver mitochondria (data not shown). Thus, fatty acid-induced mitochondrial swelling occurred in brown-fat mitochondria independently of UCP1. Free Fatty Acids Are the Functional Species—Although a higher oleate sensitivity was observed in UCP1-containing brown-fat mitochondria than in brown-fat mitochondria without UCP1 (Fig. 1D), the increased sensitivity was small (∼2-fold) when expressed as the nominal addition of oleate. To examine whether it was the nominal (“added”) amount of oleate, the oleate/mitochondrial protein ratio, or the “free” oleate concentration that restimulated UCP1, we examined conditions that allowed the distinction among these possibilities, i.e. we altered the amount of albumin in the incubation medium. In brown-fat mitochondria without UCP1, the response to a given nominal oleate addition was markedly affected by the amount of albumin present (Fig. 4A). When recalculated to free oleate concentrations according to Richieri et al. (22Richieri G.V. Anel A. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7574-7580Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), the curves approached each other but they did not fully coincide (Fig. 4B). Also, in brown-fat mitochondria with UCP1 (Fig. 4C), albumin concentration affected the oleate-induced respiration, but when these oleate concentrations were recalculated to free oleate levels, a clear coincidence of the responses was observed. Thus, it is the free oleate concentration, rather than the amount added or the oleate/protein ratio, that affects UCP1 activity (a similar conclusion was recently reached by Rial et al. (27Rial E. Aguirregoitia E. Jimenez-Jimenez J. Ledesma A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1608: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) from investigations of wild-type mitochondria). Concentration-response curves for brown-fat mitochondria without or with UCP1 based on calculated free oleate concentrations are shown in Fig. 4E. When analyzed in this way, the EC50 of oleate for stimulation of respiration in brown-fat mitochondria without UCP1 was as high as 533 ± 35 nm (n = 6). However, in brown-fat mitochondria with UCP1, the EC50 for restimulation was as low as 39 ± 6 nm (n = 6). Thus, the presence of UCP1 increased the oleate sensitivity 13-fold. Even this value may be considered an underestimate. The EC50 in the UCP1-deficient mitochondria is influenced by the respiratory inhibition occurring at high oleate concentrations (Fig. 2B). If instead the shift in the amount of oleate that causes an equal amount of stimulation (e.g. 50 nmol of O2) is read from Fig. 4E, the increased sensitivity is found to be 30-fold. It is evident from Fig. 4E that, at a given concentration of oleate, the observed respiration will be a composite of contributions from oleate-stimulated UCP1-dependent and oleate-stimulated UCP1-independent processes. However, for each oleate concentration, it is possible by subtraction to estimate the fraction that is truly UCP1-dependent. This UCP1-dependent oleate-re-induced respiration is depicted in Fig. 4F. This possibility to quantitate the exact value of the UCP1-dependent oleate effect is essential for the analysis of the control of UCP1 activity. Is the Activating Fatty Acid Trapped by UCP1?—Some models of UCP1 function imply that activating fatty acids in some way associate with the protein (28Klingenberg M. Huang S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 271-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), implicitly in such a way that they are no longer in immediate equilibrium with the free fatty acids of the medium. To examine the nature of the fatty acid/UCP1 interaction, we performed experiments as those shown in Fig. 5, A and B. In brown-fat mitochondria without UCP1, an addition of 70 μm oleate led, as expected, to an increase in respiration (Fig. 5A); however, upon a further addition of albumin, the induced oxygen consumption reverted to the basal level, i.e. the fatty acid effect was fully reversible. A similar experiment performed with UCP1-containing brown-fat mitochondria appeared principally different (Fig. 5B). As expected from Fig. 1D, 70 μm oleate induced a much larger increase in the rate of oxygen consumption in these mitochondria. However, the same amount of albumin that fully reverted respiration in brown-fat mitochondria without UCP1 was now unable to suppress the oleate-induced respiration more than marginally (Fig. 5B). Even successive additions of albumin were not able to fully revert the respiration to basa"

The fluoroprobe Spd-C2-BODIPY faithfully reports polyamine transport and accumulates almost exclusively in polyamine-sequestering vesicles (PSVs). Polyamines might thus be imported first by a plasma membrane carrier and then sequestered into pre-existing PSVs (model A), or be directly captured by polyamine receptors undergoing endocytosis (model B). Spd-C2-BODIPY uptake was unaffected in receptor-mediated endocytosis-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants. PSVs strongly colocalized with acidic vesicles of the late endocytic compartment and the trans Golgi. Virtually perfect colocalization between PSVs and acidic vesicles was found in Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants that are blocked either in the late endosome/lysosome fusion process or in the maturation of multivesicular bodies. Prior inhibition of the V-ATPase dramatically decreased total Spd-C2-BODIPY accumulation while increasing cytosolic fluorescence. Conversely, cells pre-loaded with the probe slowly released it from PSVs upon V-ATPase inhibition. The present data thus support model A, and indicate that polyamine accumulation is primarily driven by the activity of a vesicular H+:polyamine carrier.

Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) are ubiquitous organic polycations that interact with anionic biomolecules (e.g. DNA, RNA, proteins, and phospholipids) and are required in several cellular processes (1Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774PubMed Google Scholar, 2Cohen S.S. A Guide to the Polyamines. Oxford University Press, New York1998Google Scholar). Perhaps because of their pleiotropic action and their intrinsic toxicity (3Poulin R. Pelletier G. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 4Thomas T. Thomas T.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 244-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar), the biosynthesis, degradation, and transport of these compounds are tightly regulated. Whereas the molecular biology of polyamine metabolism is known extensively (2Cohen S.S. A Guide to the Polyamines. Oxford University Press, New York1998Google Scholar), the identity of the mammalian polyamine transporter(s) is as yet unknown. The importance of polyamine uptake in mammalian tissues is illustrated by the dramatic actions exerted by exogenous polyamines on polyamine homeostasis. For instance, antizymes are critical regulators of polyamine pools because of their ability to inhibit both polyamine transport and ornithine decarboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for polyamine biosynthesis, and to target the latter for degradation (5Coffino P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Quite unusually, antizyme depends on a +1 translational frameshift that narrowly responds to changes in polyamine levels. It thus constitutes an elegant chemostat for polyamine homeostasis, especially in the face of large fluctuations of extracellular polyamines (5Coffino P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Furthermore, spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase is induced by exogenous polyamines under situations where the total polyamine pool needs to be rapidly decreased (6Casero R.A. Wang Y. Stewart T.M. Devereux W. Hacker A. Smith R. Woster P.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 361-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrations of internalized polyamines required for inducing antizyme or spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase are disproportionately small as compared with the size of the endogenous pool (1Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that internalized polyamines transit through a compartment from which the bulk of endogenous polyamines are excluded because of their retention in a form that has little access to cytosolic enzymes (1Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774PubMed Google Scholar, 7Davis R.H. Morris D.R. Coffino P. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 280-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fungi, polyamines might be physically sequestered, at least in part, in vacuoles (8Cramer C.L. Davis R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5152-5157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, ≥95% of spermidine and spermine has been postulated to exist as electrostatic complexes with nucleic acids, phospholipids, and ATP, based on in vitro determinations of the dissociation constants of polyamines in such complexes (9Watanabe S. Kusama-Eguchi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20803-20809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is currently no reliable methodology to directly assess the pool size of free versus bound (or sequestered) polyamines in intact cells. Attempts to determine the intracellular distribution of polyamines have relied on invasive techniques such as immunohistochemistry (10Rubinstein S. Breitbart H. Biol. Cell. 1994; 81: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 11Fujiwara K. Masuyama Y. Kitagawa T. Histochem.

Cell Biol. 1997; 107: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) or subcellular fractionation (13Mach M. Ebert P. Popp R. Ogilvie A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Whereas some have reported the presence of polyamines in both cytoplasm and nucleus (12Roch A.M. Nicolas M.T. Quash G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 107: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 13Mach M. Ebert P. Popp R. Ogilvie A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), others have found an almost exclusively cytoplasmic distribution (10Rubinstein S. Breitbart H. Biol. Cell. 1994; 81: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 11Fujiwara K. Masuyama Y. Kitagawa T. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 106: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). One problem inherent to such techniques is the redistribution of polyamines that can rapidly follow fixation or membrane disruption, because of their high positive charge (1Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774PubMed Google Scholar). Lack of molecular information about the mammalian polyamine carriers has hampered our understanding of the intracellular fate of internalized polyamines. The introduction of novel fluorescent probes such as N-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-propionyl), N′-(S-[spermidine-{N4-ethyl}]-thioacetyl)ethylenediamine (Spd-C2-BODIPY) 1The abbreviations used are: Spd-C2-BODIPY, N-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-propionyl), N′-(S-[spermidine-{N4-ethyl}]-thioacetyl)ethylenediamine; PSV, polyamine-sequestering vesicles; α-MEM, α-minimum essential medium; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; TGN, trans Golgi network; MVBs, multivesicular bodies; V-ATPase, vacuolar H+-ATPase; VMAT, vesicular monoamine transporter; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TR, Texas Red. (14Soulet D. Covassin L. Kaouass M. Charest-Gaudreault R. Audette M. Poulin R. Biochem.

Biol. 1999; 6: 717-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) that behave like natural substrates toward the polyamine transporter(s) has helped to explore the virtually unknown details of intracellular polyamine trafficking. Interestingly, both probes accumulate mostly into intracellular vesicles (polyamine-sequestering vesicles, PSVs) and are excluded from both the cytosol and the nucleus, at least in interphase cells (14Soulet D. Covassin L. Kaouass M. Charest-Gaudreault R. Audette M. Poulin R. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 347-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cullis P.M. Green R.E. Merson-Davies L. Travis N. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 717-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Spd-C2-BODIPY distribution partly overlaps with that of recycling endosomes (14Soulet D. Covassin L. Kaouass M. Charest-Gaudreault R. Audette M. Poulin R. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 347-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that one route of entry for polyamines is receptor-mediated endocytosis, as postulated for Fe3+ uptake (16Gruenheid S. Canonne-Hergaux F. Gauthier S. Hackam D.J. Grinstein S. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, model B). Belting and colleagues (17Belting M. Mani K. Jönsson M. Cheng F. Sandgren S. Jonsson S. Ding K. Delcros J.G. Fransson L-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47181-47189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) have proposed an analogous view whereby polyamines first bind glypican-1 at the exofacial side of the plasma membrane, and the complex is then internalized via caveolation and delivery of the polyamine to the cytosol via an unknown mechanism. However, the possibility that sequestration of polyamines into PSVs is a secondary event that follows their initial influx via a “classical” plasma membrane transporter (Fig. 1, model A) could not be ruled out. Using both genetic and biochemical approaches, we now provide strong evidence that polyamine transport is most likely initiated by a plasma membrane carrier and is rapidly followed by sequestration of the substrate into PSVs via an active mechanism that requires an outwardly directed H+ gradient, in accordance with model A. Vesicular sequestration is the rate-limiting step in the uptake of the polyamine probe. Our data further support the notion that polyamine uptake into PSVs can occur at various stages of the endocytosis pathway, but is especially active in the late endocytic compartment. Reagents—Spd-C2-BODIPY was synthesized as previously described (14Soulet D. Covassin L. Kaouass M. Charest-Gaudreault R. Audette M. Poulin R. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 347-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and stock solutions were prepared at 1 mm in Me2SO. The final Me2SO concentration used in all experiments was 0.1% (v/v). Bovine calf serum was from Wisent Laboratories (St. Bruno, Quebec, Canada). Minimum essential medium with α modification (α-MEM) was purchased from Invitrogen. BODIPY® FL iodoacetamide, BODIPY® FL-transferrin, Texas Red (TR)-transferrin, BODIPY® TR ceramide, fluorescein-labeled dextran (anionic, Mr = 10,000), and LysoTracker® Red were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Bafilomycin A1 was from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). Other biochemicals and cell culture reagents were obtained from Sigma. Cell Lines and Tissue Culture—End1 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutants (B3853) and their parental cell line WTB were generously provided by Dr. April Robbins (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). LEX1 and LEX2 CHO mutants and their cognate parental cells K1-WT were kindly provided by Dr. Masato Ohashi (Department of Molecular Physiology, National Institute for Physiological Sciences, Okazaki, Japan). Polyamine transport-deficient CHO mutants (CHO-MG) and their parental cell line (CHO-TOR) were a generous gift from Dr. Wayne Flintoff (University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada). All cell lines were routinely grown in α-MEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, 2 mm l-glutamine at pH 7.4 and 37 °C (except for the End1 mutants that were grown at the permissive temperature of 34 °C) in a H2O-saturated, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Determination of Spd-C2-BODIPY Transport in Endocytosis-defective CHO cells by Flow Cytometry—End1 cells and their parental cell line were plated in 24-well culture plates and grown for 3–4 days. Cells were transferred to 40 °C for 4 h to allow expression of the defective endocytosis phenotype. Cells were then incubated with 1 μm Spd-C2-BODIPY for 1 h at 34 °C in serum-free, supplemented α-MEM (i.e. α-MEM containing 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 2 mm l-glutamine), and then for an additional hour at 40 °C. Parallel cell cultures were incubated with BODIPY FL-transferrin (5 μg/ml). Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm spermidine, and then twice with ice-cold PBS. They were next collected after trypsinization, resuspended in ice-cold α-MEM, and immediately processed for fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis using an Epics Profile II cytofluorometer (Beckman Coulter Canada, Mississauga, ON, Canada) with an argon laser tuned at 488 nm, using the FL1 photomultiplier (band width pass: 525 ± 30 nm). Colocalization of Spd-C2-BODIPY with Acidic Vesicles—Cells were plated on coverslips coated with UV-sterilized collagen 3 to 4 days prior to the experiment and were grown to ∼80% confluence. Cells were then exposed for 1 h at 37 °C to 1 μm Spd-C2-BODIPY in serum-free, supplemented α-MEM. LysoTracker Red (50 nm) was subsequently added to the cells for a further 15-min period. The latter conditions are optimal for labeling and for minimizing interference with intravesicular pH (18Haugland R.P. Spence M.T.Z. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Products. 9th Ed. Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR2002Google Scholar). Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm spermidine and twice with ice-cold PBS. Coverslips were then mounted on microslides and cells were observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Staining the Golgi Complex in Living CHO-TOR Cells with BODIPY-labeled Sphingolipids—To stain the Golgi in intact cells, BODIPY TR ceramide was added as a complex with bovine serum albumin that was prepared as described (19Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Kang H.C. Haugland R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1267-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Cells grown on glass coverslips were rinsed three times with PBS. The cells were then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 5 μm of the BODIPY TR ceramide/bovine serum albumin solution. The samples were rinsed several times with ice-cold α-MEM and incubated in fresh medium containing 1 μm Spd-C2-BODIPY for a further 30-min period at 37 °C, before being prepared for confocal laser scanning microscopy as above. Effects of Bafilomycin A1 and Monensin on Spd-C2-BODIPY Distribution in CHO-TOR Cells—Cells grown on coverslips as above were preincubated with 0.1 μm bafilomycin A1, 7 μm monensin, or vehicle (Me2SO) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then exposed to 1 μm Spd-C2-BODIPY for 1 h in serum-free supplemented α-MEM. LysoTracker Red (50 nm) was added to the cells for an extra 15 min. In other experiments, cells were first labeled with Spd-C2-BODIPY and LysoTracker Red as described above, and unincorporated probe was then washed out before incubating cells with 0.1 μm bafilomycin A1 for the indicated time intervals before confocal laser scanning microscopy. The effect of bafilomycin A1 or monensin on fluid-phase endocytosis and on lysosomal integrity was monitored essentially as described (16Gruenheid S. Canonne-Hergaux F. Gauthier S. Hackam D.J. Grinstein S. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were labeled for 1 h with 1 mg/ml lysine fixable, fluorescein-labeled dextran, rinsed with serum-free supplemented α-MEM, and then incubated for 1 h with label-free medium, followed by a 2-h incubation ± 0.1 μm bafilomycin A1, and were then immediately processed for confocal laser scanning microscopy. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed with a BX-61 microscope equipped with the Fluoview SV500 imaging software (Olympus America Inc, Melville, NY), using a 100× Plan-Apo oil immersion objective (NA = 1.35) and a 2× numerical zoom. Spd-C2-BODIPY and LysoTracker Red (or BODIPY TR ceramide) were excited sequentially at 488 nm using an argon laser and at 543 nm using a krypton/argon laser (set at 30–50 and 55% of maximum power, respectively). Lasers were from the Melles Griot Laser Group (Carlsbad, CA). Fluorescence emission from Spd-C2-BODIPY and LysoTracker Red (or BODIPY-TR ceramide) were recorded by photomultipliers preset, respectively, for enhanced green fluorescent protein (green pseudocolor) and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (red pseudocolor) fluorescent dyes with the Fluoview SV500 imaging software. Thirteen 1-μm confocal z-series were acquired for each observation area and corrected by two Kalman low-speed scans. Acquired z-series images were exported in 24-bit TIFF format. For illustration purposes, the red, green, and blue channels were subsequently separated from the original picture with Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software (Adobe Systems Inc., Seattle, WA). Image Analysis—Colocalization analysis was performed using the Color Comparison Javascript plugin developed by William O'Connell (Dept. of Radiology, University of California, San Francisco) with Image J software, i.e. the Java version of NIH Image developed by Wayne Rasband (Research Services Branch, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD). Pearson's sample correlation factor (Rr) and the percentage of colocalization p were thereby determined using three sets of representative red-green pictures from confocal laser scanning microscopy observations (20O'Connell W. MD Comput. 1988; 5: 14-22PubMed Google Scholar). Rr takes into account the similarity of shapes between images, whereas the p value for a color channel reports the intensity pattern. For instance, the p value represented by red labeling was calculated as the following. p=100×(green intensity)(green intensity+red intensity) The mean and standard deviation of Rr and of p were subsequently determined. Spd-C2-BODIPY Uptake Does Not Require Receptor-mediated Endocytosis in CHO Cells—Previous observations had indicated that within 1 h, CHO cells accumulate Spd-C2-BODIPY mostly into discrete intracellular vesicles or PSVs (14Soulet D. Covassin L. Kaouass M. Charest-Gaudreault R. Audette M. Poulin R. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 347-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because a subpopulation of the PSVs could be labeled with Texas Red-transferrin, a marker of recycling endosomes, this suggested that receptor-mediated endocytosis was, at least in part, an integral part of the polyamine uptake mechanism. To address that hypothesis, we used End1 CHO mutants that are strongly defective in receptor-mediated endocytosis and exhibit pleiotropic defects at the non-permissive temperature (40 °C) (21Roff C.F. Fuchs R. Mellman I. Robbins A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2283-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The latter include defective ATP-dependent acidification that mainly affects early endosomes and the TGN, with late endosomes and lysosomes being largely spared (21Roff C.F. Fuchs R. Mellman I. Robbins A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2283-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22Yamashiro D.J. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2723-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The uptake of BODIPY FL-transferrin was higher in wild-type cells at 40 than 34 °C (Fig. 2A) as expected from the temperature dependence of endocytosis (23Tomoda H. Kishimoto Y. Lee Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15445-15450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the permissive temperature (34 °C), net uptake of BODIPY FL-transferrin in End1 cells and wild-type cells was similar, but was strongly reduced in End1 cells upon transfer to 40 °C, as expected from the known phenotype of these mutants (21Roff C.F. Fuchs R. Mellman I. Robbins A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2283-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On the other hand, no difference was observed in the uptake of Spd-C2-BODIPY between wild-type and End1 cells at either 34 or 40 °C (Fig. 2B). Thus, receptor-mediated endocytosis is clearly not the main pathway used for Spd-C2-BODIPY uptake, and strongly argues against model B (cf. Fig. 1) as the major mechanism of polyamine accumulation. PSVs Are Largely Represented by Strongly Acidic Vesicular Compartments—Because the perinuclear distribution and the heterogeneous size of PSVs are lysosomal characteristics, PSV localization was compared with that of lysosomes and other strongly acidic compartments (e.g. late endosomes) using the acidotropic fluoroprobe LysoTracker Red. As shown in Fig. 3, colocalization between LysoTracker Red-stained vesicles (in red) and PSVs (in green) was 73 ± 3% (Rr = 0.80 ± 0.01; n = 3), indicating substantial overlap (yellow coarse-grained pattern). By comparison, colocalization between Spd-C2-BODIPY and Texas Red-transferrin was 39 ± 16% (Rr = 0.45 ± 0.01; n = 3) (Fig. 3, lower left panel), indicating that Spd-C2-BODIPY accumulation is quantitatively more important within the late endocytic pathway than in the recycling compartment. Spd-C2-BODIPY Is Partially Sequestered in the Trans Region of the Golgi—The TGN typically maintains a slightly acidic internal pH (∼5.9) (24Grabe M. Oster G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Moreover, a number of organelle transporters, such as the P-type copper-transporting ATPases (25Lutsenko S. Petris M.J. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 191: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and the zinc carrier ZnT7 (26Kirschke C.P. Huang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4096-4102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) are expressed in the Golgi, including the TGN. Furthermore, amphipathic weak amines such as anthracyclines preferentially accumulate in the TGN and Golgi-derived vesicles (27Bour-Dill C. Gramain M.-P. Merlin J.-L. Marchal S. Guillemin F. Cytometry. 2000; 39: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Given the complex trafficking between the Golgi, the plasma membrane, and various endocytic vesicles (28Pelham H.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1099-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we assessed whether the Golgi might participate in the accumulation of Spd-C2-BODIPY. Cells were pre-loaded at 4 °C with BODIPY TR ceramide, and then incubated with the polyamine probe upon transfer to 37 °C. This temperature switch causes the selective accumulation of BODIPY-labeled ceramides into the Golgi (19Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Kang H.C. Haugland R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1267-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). BODIPY TR ceramide stained juxtanuclear vesicles of various sizes as well as sac-like structures surrounding one pole of the nucleus (Fig. 4, middle column), as previously reported (29Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although colocalization between BODIPY TR ceramide and Spd-C2-BODIPY staining was only partial, it was mainly found in the extended saccular elements of the Golgi (Fig. 4, right column, arrows). The latter results indicate a connection between the Golgi and the pathway of PSV biogenesis. However, the limited degree of overlap between Spd-C2-BODIPY and BODIPY TR ceramide staining indicates that the Golgi is a minor site for polyamine accumulation and might correspond to a point of convergence with the late endocytic pathway (cf. “Discussion”). Intravesicular Accumulation of Spd-C2-BODIPY Can Be Induced at an Early Step of the Late Endosome/Lysosome Degradative Pathway—It was unclear whether PSVs correspond to lysosomes only because LysoTracker Red is not specific for the latter organelles but also labels other acidic compartments such as late endosomes (18Haugland R.P. Spence M.T.Z. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Products. 9th Ed. Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR2002Google Scholar). Because attempts at fixing Spd-C2-BODIPY in situ for the immunocytochemical localization of specific organelle markers were unsuccessful, we used an indirect approach to determine which organelle subpopulation(s) of the late endocytic pathway is actually represented by PSVs. LEX1 and LEX2 CHO mutants are defective in two different steps along the late endocytic pathway, namely in the fusion process between late endosomes and lysosomes, and in the maturation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), respectively (30Ohashi M. Miwako I. Nakamura K. Yamamoto A. Murata M. Ohnishi S. Nagayama K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1125-1138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ohashi M. Miwako I. Yamamoto A. Nagayama K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2187-2205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LEX2 mutation thus lies at an earlier step in the late endocytic pathway than the LEX1 lesion. To better assess the site(s) of Spd-C2-BODIPY accumulation among the various acidic organelles, we thus compared the pattern of PSVs and LysoTracker Red staining observed in these two mutant cell lines and in wild-type CHO cells. In LEX1 cells, vesicles labeled by LysoTracker Red had a larger average size and were less numerous than in control cells, and were characteristically distributed in a fusiform, perinuclear fashion, with frequent major aggregation near one pole of the nucleus (Fig. 5, center panel). These features confirm previous reports, and may correspond to the aggregation of fusion intermediates between late endosomes and lysosomes accumulating in these mutants, with a characteristic arrangement around the microtubule organizing centers (30Ohashi M. Miwako I. Nakamura K. Yamamoto A. Murata M. Ohnishi S. Nagayama K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1125-1138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, the LEX1 mutation did not prevent Spd-C2-BODIPY accumulation, and there was in fact an almost perfect colocalization of PSVs with LysoTracker Redpositive organelles in LEX1 cells. Acidic organelles detected in LEX2 cells were typically spherical and even larger than those found in LEX1 cells, and exhibited a perinuclear distribution but without the fusiform alignment typically observed in LEX1 mutants (Fig. 5, right panel). The larger, round acidic compartments found to accumulate in LEX2 cells are likely maturing MVBs, which are much scarcer in wild-type cells, and are a diagnostic feature of these mutants (31Ohashi M. Miwako I. Yamamoto A. Nagayama K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2187-2205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Again, PSVs colocalized to a greater extent with acidic vesicular compartments in LEX2 cells than in control cells. The marked enrichment in PSVs caused by either the LEX1 or LEX2 mutation clearly suggests that accumulation of the polyamine probe can occur at an early step in the late endocytic pathway. Moreover, vesicular sequestering of Spd-C2-BODIPY represents a major activity of MVBs, late endosomes, and lysosomes. Both Accumulation and Sequestration of Spd-C2-BODIPY into PSVs Require an Outward Proton Gradient—We next assessed the model whereby polyamines are first transported via a classical plasma membrane carrier, and then rapidly sequestered into acidic PSVs (Fig. 1, model A). We tested the assumption that dissipating the H+ gradient across the PSV membrane using either bafilomycin A1, a specific and potent inhibitor of the V-ATPase, or monensin, a polyether ionophore catalyzing K+ (or Na+):H+ exchange, prior to loading cells with Spd-C2-BODIPY, would inhibit probe accumulation if its sequestration is tightly coupled to H+ efflux from the PSV. Indeed, pretreatment with bafilomycin A1 virtually abolished intravesicular acidification, while drastically decreasing intracellular accumulation of the spermidine probe (Fig. 6A, right panel). In fact, flow cytometry showed that total intracellular accumulation of Spd-C2-BODIPY was reduced by 97% by a 1-h preincubation with bafilomycin A1. Quite strikingly, the low intracellular staining with Spd-C2-BODIPY still present in bafilomycin-treated cells was clearly cytoplasmic and diffuse, in marked contrast with the vesicular distribution of the probe found in control cells (Fig. 6A, left panel). Similar results were obtained with monensin (Fig. 6B). A 2-h incubation of CHO cells with bafilomycin A1 did not disrupt endocytosis nor detectably affect the structural integrity of lysosomes, as shown by its lack of effect on fluorescein-conjugated dextran accumulation (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that V-ATPase activity and an outwardly directed H+ gradient are required for the intracellular sequestration of Spd-C2-BODIPY into PSVs. Importantly, although the initial uptake of Spd-C2-BODIPY into the cytoplasm does not absolutely require V-ATPase activity, total cellular capacity for accumulation of the probe is largely regulated at the level of its H+-dependent sequestration into PSVs. One well established mechanism that accounts for the preferential sequesteri"
https://openalex.org/W2059425147,"Majority of anaplastic large-cell lymphomas (ALCLs) are associated with the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation, fusing the NPM (nucleophosmin) and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) genes (NPM-ALK). Recent studies demonstrated that ALK may also be involved in variant translocations, namely, t(1;2)(q25;p23), t(2;3)(p23;q21), t(2;17)(p23;q23) and inv(2)(p23q35), which create the TPM3-ALK, TFG-ALK5, CLTC-ALK, and ATIC-ALK fusion genes, respectively. Although overexpression of NPM-ALK has previously been shown to transform fibroblasts, the transforming potential of variant X-ALK proteins has not been precisely investigated. We stably transfected the cDNAs coding for NPM-ALK, TPM3-ALK, TFG-ALK, CLTC-ALK or ATIC-ALK into nonmalignant NIH3T3 cells. All X-ALK variants are tyrosine phosphorylated and their subcellular distribution was in agreement with that observed in tumors. Moreover, our results show that the in vitro transforming capacity of NIH3T3-transfected cells are in relation to the level of X-ALK fusion proteins excepted for TPM3-ALK for which there is an inverse correlation. The differences between the five X-ALK variants with regard to proliferation rate, colony formation in soft agar, invasion, migration through the endothelial barrier and tumorigenicity seem to be due to differential activation of various signaling pathways such as PI3-kinase/AKT. These findings may have clinical implications in the pathogenesis and prognosis of ALK-positive ALCLs."

https://openalex.org/W2037493777,"We have recently reported that interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression was inversely correlated to estrogen receptor (ER) status and was overexpressed in invasive breast cancer cells. In the present study, we show that IL-8 overexpression in breast cancer cells involves a higher transcriptional activity of IL-8 gene promoter. Cloning of IL-8 promoter from MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells expressing high and low levels of IL-8, respectively, shows the integrity of the promoter in both cell lines. Deletion and site-directed mutagenesis of the promoter demonstrate that NF-κB and AP-1 and to a lesser extent C/EBP binding sites play a crucial role in the control of IL-8 promoter activity in MDA-MB-231 cells. Knockdown of NF-κB and AP-1 activities by adenovirus-mediated expression of an NF-κB super-repressor and RNA interference, respectively, decreased IL-8 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. On the contrary, restoration of Fra-1, Fra-2, c-Jun, p50, p65, C/EBPα and C/EBPβ expression levels in MCF-7 cells led to a promoter activity comparable to that observed in MDA-MB-231 cells. Our data constitute the first extensive study of IL-8 gene overexpression in breast cancer cells and suggest that the high expression of IL-8 in invasive cancer cells requires a complex cooperation between NF-κB, AP-1 and C/EBP transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2009450264,"There is accumulating evidence to suggest that palindromic AT-rich repeats (PATRRs) represent hot spots of double-strand breakage that lead to recurrent chromosomal translocations in humans. As a mechanism for such rearrangements, we proposed that the PATRR forms a cruciform structure that is the source of genomic instability. To test this hypothesis, we have investigated the tertiary structure of a cloned PATRR. We have observed that a plasmid containing this PATRR undergoes a conformational change, causing temperature-dependent mobility changes upon agarose gel electrophoresis. The mobility shift is observed in physiologic salt concentrations and is most prominent when the plasmid DNA is incubated at room temperature prior to electrophoresis. Analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis indicates that the mobility shift results from the formation of a cruciform structure. S1 nuclease and T7 endonuclease both cut the plasmid into a linear form, also suggesting cruciform formation. Furthermore, anti-cruciform DNA antibody reduces the electrophoretic mobility of the PATRR-containing fragment. Finally, we have directly visualized cruciform extrusions from the plasmid DNA with the size expected of hairpin arms using atomic force microscopy.

Most 11;22 translocations show breakpoints at the center of the PATRRs, suggesting that the center of the palindrome is susceptible to double-strand breaks, leading to the translocation (5Kurahashi H.

Extensive screening of YAC/BAC/PAC libraries has not been successful in cloning this breakpoint region. However, experimentally derived sequences from numerous t(11;22) junction fragments demonstrate that the 22q11 breakpoints reside within a larger PATRR.

More recently, molecular cloning of translocation breakpoints has demonstrated similar palindromic sequences on partner chromosomes, such as 17q11, 4q35.1, and 1p21.2 (14Kurahashi H. Shaikh T.

In appropriate conditions, these structures can be generated from palindromic DNA in vitro and visualized directly by electron microscopy (17Mizuuchi K. Mizuuchi M. Gellert M. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 229-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, cruciform extrusion is usually kinetically blocked; it appears to take place only in response to heating, suggesting that a considerable amount of energy is required for cruciform extrusion (18Courey A.J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1983; 33: 817-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, under appropriate conditions, palindromic DNA prefers to extrude cruciform arms even at physiological temperatures (19Panyutin I. Klishko V. Lyamichev V. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1984; 1: 1311-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In a previous report, we demonstrated that the PATRRs on 11q23, 17q11, and 22q11 are all comprised of a long AT-rich region with relatively GC-rich ends (5Kurahashi H. Emanuel B.S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2605-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 14Kurahashi H. Shaikh T. Takata M. Toda T. Emanuel B.S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 72: 733-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We have proposed that the AT richness of the PATRRs contributes to strand separation at physiological temperatures, whereas the relatively GC-rich ends contribute to the stable intrastrand complementary interaction of the PATRR. These characteristics are likely to induce or favor the formation of a cruciform structure.In this study, we have investigated the in vitro tertiary structure of the 11q23 PATRR and demonstrated that it forms a cruciform structure at physiological conditions. Our data suggest that PATRRs may form unstable structures that lead to chromosomal translocations in humans. These data also implicate a biological role for the temperature-sensitive conformational change characteristic of palindromic DNA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPATRR Plasmid—A plasmid containing the chromosome 11 PATRR (204 bp) was constructed by PCR and TA cloning as described previously (psPATRR11) (1Kurahashi H. Shaikh T.H. Hu P. Roe B.A. Emanuel B.S. Budarf M.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1665-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The control plasmid that deletes the PATRR region was constructed using BAC 442e11, which deletes almost the entire PATRR region (pΔPATRR11). Plasmid DNA was isolated by means of alkaline lysis (denaturing) or Triton lysis (non-denaturing) methods and purified using ion-exchange columns (Qiagen) without the use of phenol. Isopropanol-precipitated DNA was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline/1 mm EDTA. All of the procedures were performed at 4 °C in a cold room to avoid artifactual cruciform extrusion during the procedure. Isolated plasmid DNA was divided into small aliquots and immediately frozen until used in an experiment. The plasmid was quickly thawed, incubated at a given temperature, and then cooled on ice before electrophoresis.DNA topoisomers containing different linking numbers were prepared by relaxation of the DNA with topoisomerase I (Invitrogen) in the presence of varied concentrations of ethidium bromide as described (20Peck L.J. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6206-6210Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Several samples with different ranges of linking numbers were pooled to produce a mixture with a broader distribution of topoisomers.Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Standard agarose gel electrophoresis was performed in horizontal gel slabs immersed in 1× Tris/borate/EDTA (TBE) electrophoresis buffer. The 0.7% agarose gel was prepared in TBE in a square gel tray. Electrophoresis was performed at 45 V for 20 h at 4 °C. The gel was stained in water plus ethidium bromide at 1 μg/ml for 2 h followed by extensive destaining in several changes of water before photography. For two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the sample was applied at the left upper corner. Electrophoresis in the first dimension was performed using the same conditions as for standard electrophoresis. The gel was then soaked in TBE plus chloroquine (0.75 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 8 h with gentle agitation for equilibration. After soaking, the gel was rotated clockwise 90° from the original position. Electrophoresis in the second dimension was performed in TBE plus chloroquine at 45 V for 20 h. The gel was then soaked in several changes of deionized water to remove the chloroquine. The gel was stained in water plus ethidium bromide in similar conditions as for standard agarose gel electrophoresis. To stabilize the cruciform structure, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was also performed in Mg2+-containing buffer (0.5× TBE, 10 mm MgCl2) for the first dimension (21Dai X. Greizerstein M.B. Nadas-Chinni K. Rothman-Denes L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2174-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was carried out at 45 V for 30 h at 4 °C, replacing the electrophoresis buffer every 6 h (22Vologodskaia M.Y. Vologodskii A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 851-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Nuclease Sensitivity Assay—T7 endonuclease (New England BioLabs), S1 nuclease (Takara), and nuclease P1 (Roche Applied Science) digestions were performed at room temperature for 1 h in the appropriate buffers. 10 units of T7 endonuclease, 1 unit of S1 nuclease, and 0.1 units of nuclease P1 were used for digestion of 1 μg of plasmid. After digestion, the plasmid DNA was precipitated with ethanol and then subjected to 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis.For mapping of the cleavage sites, the nuclease-digested plasmids were purified, digested with EcoRI or BstXI, and then subjected to 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. The fragments were purified and sequenced using internal primers.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA was performed as described previously (23Kim E.L. Peng H. Esparza F.M. Maltchenko S.Z. Stachowiak M.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), using a monoclonal antibody against cruciform DNA, 2D3 (24Frappier L. Price G.B. Martin R.G. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To shorten the DNA fragment, psPATRR11 and pΔPATRR11 were digested with BamHI and HincII and subcloned into pT7Blue. 100 ng of supercoiled plasmid DNA was incubated at 4 °C for 1hin20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm MgCl2) with or without 2D3. A second circular plasmid was added simultaneously into the reaction for nonspecific competition. After the addition of 2 μl of 10× restriction digestion buffer, the plasmid was digested for 30 min at room temperature with 5 units of both BamHI and HindIII. Subsequently, 1 unit of Klenow fragment and 10 mCi of [α-32P]dCTP were added to the reaction mixture, and incubation continued for 10 min. The fragments were resolved on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels at 4 °C at 5 V/cm. Gels were dried and exposed for an appropriate time.Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Experiments—The plasmid DNA sample (10 μl) was dripped onto a mica substrate coated with spermine, rinsed with 1 ml of water, and blown with dry nitrogen gas. AFM analysis was carried out using a Nanoscope IIIa Multimode system (Digital Instruments Inc., Santa Barbara, CA) in the tapping mode at room temperature in air. Silicon cantilevers of 127 μm in length with a spring constant of 48 newtons/m were purchased from Nanosensors (Wetzlar-Blankenfeld). Typical resonant frequencies of these tips were 340 kHz. The 512 × 512 pixel images were collected at a rate of two scan lines/second. The contour lengths of the DNA were determined using NIH Image software.To lock the PATRR plasmid into the cruciform structure, DNA cross-linking was performed by a method similar to that described previously (25Bell L.R. Byers B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1983; 47: 829-840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, plasmid DNA was dissolved in a solution of 4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralen (100 μg/ml) and exposed to UV light at 365 nm for 5 min. The DNA was digested with EcoRI, purified, and then subjected to AFM.RESULTSPATRR Plasmid Prefers to Be in Its Relaxed State—We have hypothesized that the PATRR forms a cruciform structure even in physiological conditions, leading to genomic instability in humans. To test this hypothesis, we have examined the tertiary structure of a cloned 11q23 PATRR. This PATRR is too unstable to be cloned into a plasmid vector in its entirety. The 11q23 BAC including the t(11;22) breakpoint region inevitably deletes the PATRR during bacterial culture. YACs that span this region also delete the PATRR, suggesting that it is unstable even when yeast is used as the host. Previously, we identified a short polymorphic version of the PATRR (Fig. 1B) that can be stably expanded as a plasmid in Escherichia coli (5Kurahashi H. Emanuel B.S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2605-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We prepared the short PATRR-containing plasmid (psPATRR11), as well as a plasmid that deletes the PATRR (pΔPATRR11), in a buffer at physiological salt concentration (phosphate-buffered saline/EDTA) and used them for the following studies.First, we analyzed the plasmids prepared by the standard alkaline lysis method. Upon standard agarose gel electrophoresis, a plasmid usually yields three bands, which correspond to supercoiled, linear, and open circular DNA. In addition to the expected bands, the psPATRR11 showed a ladder migrating at the position for supercoiled DNA. The pΔPATRR11 did not yield such a ladder (Fig. 1C). Each band of the ladder corresponds to a topoisomer containing different linking numbers. Relaxed topoisomers move slowly in the gel. The observed ladder suggests that the PATRR-containing plasmid, unlike the plasmid without the PATRR, prefers to be in its relaxed state in solution.Cruciform formation involves unpairing of the complementary strands and thus reduces the interstrand twist number. For negatively supercoiled DNA, a reduction in twist number reduces the degree of supercoiling and thus would cause a reduction in electrophoretic mobility. The observed ladder is consistent with cruciform formation of the PATRR plasmid.Nuclease Sensitivity Assay—Cruciform DNA is known to be digested by S1 nuclease, nuclease P1, or T7 endonuclease (26Haniford D.B. Pulleyblank D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 4343-4363Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To confirm cruciform extrusion of the psPATRR11 and exclude the possibility of other conformational variants, we examined the nuclease sensitivity of the PATRR plasmid prepared by the alkaline lysis method. S1 nuclease, which is known to cut single-stranded DNA at the tip of the cruciform structure, cleaved most of the supercoiled psPATRR11 into a linear form (Fig. 2, lane 2) but cleaved only a small amount of the pΔPATRR11 or TA cloning vector (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 10). Since the pH for the S1 nuclease reaction buffer is so low, it may nick the plasmid and affect the results. Thus, we also incubated the plasmid with buffer, which resulted in no background linearization (data not shown). Nuclease P1, which can react at physiological pH, produced similar results (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that S1 nuclease cleaves single-stranded DNA of the psPATRR11 only because of the AT-rich nature of the palindrome, we used T7 endonuclease, which can cut the four-way junction of the cruciform structure. When incubated at room temperature, a considerable amount of the ps-PATRR11 was digested by T7 endonuclease into a linear form (Fig. 2, lane 3). In contrast, the endonuclease did not cut either pΔPATRR11 or the TA cloning vector (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 11).Fig. 2Nuclease sensitivity assay of the PATRR plasmid. The original plasmid, plasmid with S1 nuclease digestion, plasmid with T7 endonuclease digestion, and plasmid with restriction enzyme digestion that cuts the plasmid only once were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis in this order. Lanes 1–4, psPATRR11; lanes 5–8, pΔPATRR11; lanes 9–12, TA cloning vector. The arrows indicate the position of the linear form of psPATRR11 (a), pΔPATRR11 (b), and TA cloning vector (c).

The first dimension, run in the absence of intercalative ligands, resolves the topoisomers on the basis of torsion in the backbone. Since structural transitions due to unwinding torsion are reversed in the presence of chloroquine, a second dimension run in the presence of this ligand resolves the topoisomers on the basis of linking differences.Examination of psPATRR11 prepared by the standard alkaline lysis method reveals two non-continuous downward-sloping curves on the gel, suggestive of an abrupt structural transition (Fig. 3A). Next, we treated psPATRR11 with topoisomerase I in the presence of various amounts of ethidium bromide so as to prepare plasmids with broader topoisomer distribution. After topoisomerase I treatment, psPATRR11 yields an additional curve above the original two (Fig. 3B). This additional curve corresponds to more relaxed topoisomers generated by topoisomerase I treatment. In the first dimension, the electrophoretic mobilities of cruciform-containing topoisomers are retarded in comparison with the same topoisomers without the cruciform, whereas these two forms migrate identically in the second dimension. This is the result of the elimination of cruciform structures in the presence of chloroquine, which acts to reduce torsional stress. Since a greater degree of negative supercoiling is known to accelerate cruciform extrusion (17Mizuuchi K. Mizuuchi M. Gellert M. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 229-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 18Courey A.J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1983; 33: 817-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), the two minor curves on this gel are likely to originate from cruciform DNA.Fig. 3Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the PATRR plasmid.A, psPATRR11 prepared by the alkaline lysis method. B, psPATRR11 treated with topoisomerase I in the presence of various amounts of ethidium bromide. C, topoisomerase I-treated psPATRR11 digested with T7 endonuclease. D, topoisomerase I-treated psPATRR11 digested with S1 nuclease. Two downward-sloping curves originating from cruciform extrusion are observed at the lower right side on both the A and the B gels, but neither are observed in the C nor in the D gel. Spots at the upper left side on the gels originate from open circular nicked plasmids, whereas spots near the center of the gels are from nuclease-cleaved linear plasmids.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We digested topoisomerase I-treated psPATRR11 with S1 nuclease or T7 endonuclease prior to the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. As expected, the two minor curves virtually disappeared as a result of nuclease digestion, whereas the other curve remained unchanged (Fig. 3, C and D). Large spots indicative of open circles and linear DNA appeared instead. These results demonstrate that two minor arcs originate from cruciform DNA and that, combined with the data derived from undigested psPATRR11, the majority of psPATRR11, when isolated by the alkaline lysis method, forms a cruciform extrusion.Mg2+ is known to stabilize a cruciform structure (21Dai X. Greizerstein M.B. Nadas-Chinni K. Rothman-Denes L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2174-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Vologodskaia M.Y. Vologodskii A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 851-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We repeated the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis experiments in Mg2+-containing buffer for the first dimension. The results were similar to those seen for standard TBE buffer (data not shown).Mapping of Nuclease Cleavage Sites in the PATRR—The presence of two curves on the two-dimensional gel indicates that the psPATRR11 adopts two types of cruciform conformations. To localize the subregion of the PATRR responsible for cruciform extrusion, we mapped nuclease cleavage sites using restriction enzyme digestion (Fig. 4, A and B). Both T7 endonuclease and S1 nuclease yielded several fragments that were shorter than that of the PATRR-containing fragment, whereas the intensity of the original fragment was reduced by treatment with the nucleases. The pattern of cleavage provides additional support toward confirming cruciform extrusion of the PATRR region of the plasmid.Fig. 4Mapping of nuclease cleavage sites in the PATRR.A, mapping by digestion with restriction enzyme. S1, S1 nuclease; T7, T7 endonuclease; RE, restriction enzyme. B, restriction map of the PATRR-flanking region. C, mapping by sequencing. The entire PATRR is shown as a putative hairpin structure predicted by mfold software (mfold.burnet.edu.au/dna_form). The arrows indicate cleavage sites with T7 endonuclease, whereas the arrowheads indicate those with S1 nuclease. the relatively GC-rich region is indicated by a bracket.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further map the cleavage sites, we performed sequence analysis of each nuclease-cleaved fragment. Four EcoRI-T7 endonuclease fragments were sequenced, and we localized the cleavage sites at two positions (Fig. 4C). Thus, we conclude that psPATRR11 forms large and small cruciform extrusions as was predicted from the two-dimensional gel analysis. The small cruciform extrusion originates from the 36-bp region at the center of the PATRR. Further, the PATRR has a relatively GC-rich region at both ends (1Kurahashi H. Shaikh T.H. Hu P. Roe B.A. Emanuel B.S. Budarf M.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1665-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 5Kurahashi H. Emanuel B.S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2605-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, the large cruciform originates from the region that excludes this GC-rich region. The cleavage sites of S1 nuclease were rather complicated. One of the cleavage sites colocalized with the precise center of the PATRR, the putative tip of the cruciform structure (Fig. 4C). The rest of the cleavage sites of S1 nuclease were mapped at the mismatch regions between the proximal and distal arms of the PATRR. These results suggest intrastrand annealing within the PATRR, which is also consistent with cruciform formation.Temperature-sensitive Structural Transition of the PATRR—To determine whether the PATRR plasmid adopts cruciform conformation in E. coli, we have prepared the plasmid by a Triton lysis method (non-denaturing method) since denaturation of the PATRR can induce artifactual cruciform formation. Unlike plasmids isolated by the alkaline lysis method, psPATRR11 did not yield a characteristic ladder in standard agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5A, lane 1). This suggests that the psPATRR11 does not form a cruciform in E. coli.Fig. 5Temperature-sensitive structural transition of the PATRR.A, temperature-dependent gel mobility shift of the PATRR plasmid. psPATRR11 prepared by the Triton lysis method was incubated at various temperatures shown on the top. A, psPATRR11 prepared by the alkaline lysis method. M, molecular size markers. B, a time course of incubation at room temperature. psPATRR11 was incubated at room temperature for periods indicated on the top.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Next, we incubated the psPATRR11 at various temperatures for 1 h prior to agarose gel electrophoresis. Mobility retardation of the supercoiled plasmid was observed as a characteristic ladder in samples incubated at temperatures between 16 and 37 °C (Fig. 5A). This band shift must be the result of a transition from non-cruciform to a cruciform conformation. Unexpectedly, mobility retardation was most prominent in the plasmid incubated at room temperature. The ladder appeared as soon as 1 min after the start of incubation at room temperature, and the fraction of upward shifted bands expanded with increasing duration of incubation (Fig. 5B). Since the band pattern of the sample after 1 h of incubation was similar to that prepared by the alkaline lysis method, incubation at room temperature for 1 h appeared to be sufficient for a large fraction of the plasmid to form the cruciform extrusion. The sample incubated for 1 h at room temperature was subjected to two-dimensional gel analysis, producing similar results to that prepared by the alkaline lysis method (data not shown).EMSA—We performed EMSA using the anti-cruciform antibody 2D3, which recognizes cruciform DNA (24Frappier L. Price G.B. Martin R.G. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To reduce the size of the PATRR fragments, we subcloned BamHI/HincII fragments into a plasmid vector (Fig. 1B). The sizes of the subfragments from psPATRR11 and pΔPATRR11 are 375 and 162 bp, respectively. Plasmid DNA samples prepared by the Triton lysis method were used for EMSA. Without any preincubation of the plasmid, the addition of the 2D3 antibody did not result in a band shift for the subfragments from ps-PATRR11 (Fig. 6, lanes 9 and 10) or from pΔPATRR11 (data not shown). However, when the plasmids were incubated at room temperature for 7 days prior to the reaction to maximize the fraction adopting cruciform conformation, subfragments from psPATRR11 demonstrated a robust band shift in an antibody concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6, lanes 1–3). The subfragment from pΔPATRR11 did not show a band shift even after incubation at room temperature for 7 days (Fig. 6, lanes 4–6). Since retardation of psPATRR11 was not observed with control monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 6, lanes 7 and 8), this band shift indicates that the 2D3 antibody bound specifically to the PATRR plasmid incubated at room temperature.Fig. 6Gel electrophoresis mobility shift assay of the PATRR fragment. psPATRR11 (lanes 1–"

The purified PhoP protein has been shown to bind to a conserved hexanucleotide repeat separated by 5 nucleotides, termed PhoP box, present in the promoter region of many PhoP-activated genes in Salmonella (13Lejona S.

However, several PhoP-activated genes seem to lack a PhoP box (13Lejona S. Aguirre A. Cabeza M.L. Garcia Vescovi E. Soncini F.C. J.

Indeed, a subset of PhoP-activated genes is controlled via the PmrA/PmrB two-component system (16Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6796-6801Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), which is activated by the PhoP-dependent PmrD protein at a post-transcriptional level (17Kox L.F. Wosten M.M.

The Salmonella SlyA protein is a transcriptional regulator of the MarR family that was originally identified based on its ability to induce expression of a cryptic hemolysin in E. coli K-12 (18Libby S.J.

Mizunoe Y. Uhlin B.E. Haydon D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Salmonella slyA mutants exhibit some of the same phenotypes displayed by phoP and phoQ mutants, including virulence attenuation in mice and the inability to survive within macrophages (18Libby S.J.

The PhoP/PhoQ system is required for transcription from one of the promoters of the slyA gene (20Norte V.A. Stapleton M.R. Green J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3508-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting that some of the phenotypes displayed phoP and phoQ mutants could be caused by their inability to express the SlyA protein and implying that SlyA participates in transcription of a subset of PhoP-regulated genes. Although the mechanism by which the PhoP/PhoQ system controls slyA transcription remains unknown, it has been suggested that the PhoP protein regulates slyA expression indirectly because a PhoP box could not be identified in the slyA promoter region (20Norte V.A. Stapleton M.R. Green J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3508-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated recently that the PhoP-activated ugtL gene is required for a modification of the lipid A mediating resistance to the antimicrobial peptides magainin 2 and polymyxin B (21Shi Y. Cromie M.J. Hsu F.F. Turk J. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The ugtL gene is part of a Salmonella-specific gene cluster that includes the PhoP-activated pcgL gene (22Hilbert F. del Portillo F.G. Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2158-2165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the sifB gene, which is expressed in response to the low Mg2+ conditions that normally activate the PhoP/PhoQ system (23Garmendia J. Beuzon C.R. Ruiz-Albert J. Holden D.W. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 2385-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Here we report that transcription of the ugtL gene and resistance to the antimicrobial peptides magainin 2 and polymyxin B require both the phoP and slyA regulatory genes. We establish that the PhoP protein binds to the slyA promoter and that both the PhoP and SlyA proteins bind to the ugtL promoter, suggesting that these two proteins use a feed-forward loop to control ugtL expression. This is the first example of a gene that requires both PhoP and SlyA for transcription.

A PCR fragment containing the slyA coding region with its Shine-Dalgarno sequence that was generated by PCR with primers 2905 (5′-CGGGATCCTAATTATAAGGAGATGAAATTG-3′) and 2906 (5′-CCCAAGCTTCACGTATGCCCCTGCACCTCAATC-3′) and wild-type strain 14028s chromosomal DNA as template was digested with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into pUHE21–2lacIq that had been digested with the same enzymes. Plasmid pUHE21–2lacIq-slyA-FLAG (C terminus) was constructed as described for pUHE21–2lacIq-slyA except that primer 2906 was replaced by primer 2983 (5′-CCCAAGCTTCACGTATGCCCCTGCACCTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCATCGTGAGAGTGCAATTCCATAATATTG-3′). Sequence analysis using primer 2909 (5′-GACTTGTGAGCGGATAACAATG-3′) demonstrated the presence of wild-type slyA sequence in these plasmids. Construction of Strains with Chromosomal Mutations, Harboring lac Gene Fusions or Nucleotide Substitutions in Regulatory Sites—Strains harboring deletions were generated as described previously (26Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar). Deletion of the slyA gene was carried out using primers 2143 (5′-ACTGAAGCTACAGGTGCCAAGTGCGCAGCAAGCTAATTATGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC-3′) and 2144 (5′-TAAACCAGGCTTTACGTGTGGTCACATGGCCACACGTATGCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG-3′) to amplify the CmR cassette from plasmid pKD3 and integrate the resulting PCR product into the chromosome. Deletion of the slyA gene was confirmed by Southern blot analysis using as probe a PCR product generated with primers 2864 (5′-CTTCACAAGCAATGTTCCTTTGCGTC-3′) and 2865 (5′-ATGAATAAAACCCAGGGTGTGGAAC-3′). An analogous strategy was used to introduce a CmR resistance gene upstream of the ugtL promoter, which allowed for mutagenesis of the PhoP binding sites. A lac transcriptional fusion immediately downstream of the chromosomal copy of the slyA gene was constructed as described previously (27Ellermeier C.D. Janakiraman A. Slauch J.M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 290: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). First, the CmR cassette was amplified using pKD3 plasmid DNA as template and primers 2813 (5′-ACACAATATTATGGAATTGCACTCTCACGATTGAGGTGCAGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC-3′) and 2814 (5′-CCAGGCTTTACGTGTGGTCACATGGCCACACGTATGCCCCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAGT-3′), and the resulting PCR product was integrated 8 nucleotides behind the stop codon of the slyA gene. The insertion of the CmR cassette at the expected location was confirmed by Southern blot analysis using as probe a PCR product generated with primers 2864 (5′-CTTCACAAGCAATGTTCCTTTGCGTC-3′) and 2865 (5′-ATGAATAAAACCCAGGGTGTGGAAC-3′). The CmR cassette was removed using plasmid pCP20 (26Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar), and the lac transcriptional fusion plasmid pCE36 was integrated into the FLP recombination target sequence downstream of the slyA gene. Substitutions of the PhoP binding sites in the ugtL promoter were constructed as follows. First, we introduced a CmR resistance cassette behind the predicted start codon of the divergently transcribed sifB, which is the gene located immediately upstream of ugtL, using a PCR product generated with primers 4050 (5′-ACATCTCACTCTTTAAAAATCCTCTCCCGATAGTAATTGGGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC-3′) and 4051 (5′-GTAATGAAGTATCATATAATCACTTGTGGTCTACATTATGATATGAATATCCTCCTTAGT-3′) and plasmid pKD3 as template (26Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar). The resulting strain was termed sifB1 and displayed wild-type levels of ugtL transcription. Insertion of the CmR cassette at the expected location was confirmed by sequencing a PCR product generated with primers 4050 and 3874 (5′-TCTTCATTTTGAGCCTCCTCGCAGG-3′). Second, the chromosomal DNA sample from the resulting sifB1 strain was used as template to produce the PCR-generated DNA fragments for mutagenesis of the PhoP binding sites in the ugtL promoter. Primers 4050 and 4052 (5′-CCTAATAATACTTTTAGTTTAACTTCTTATAAGACAATTTCTACACGCTTCACCAACTTATATCTTTCTCTAAAAATAATATAGTGCG-3′) were used to mutagenize the PhoP1 site, and primers 4050 and 4107 (5′-TCTGCCCTACCGCTAAACATCTCATTGTTGTTAGCCTAATAATTGTTTTAGTAATTCTTCTTATAAGACAATTTCTAC-3′) were used to mutagenize the PhoP2 site. The PCR-generated DNA fragments were introduced into EG11250 competent cells carrying plasmid pKD46 as described previously (26Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar). The substitution of the DNA sequence at the expected location was confirmed by sequencing PCR products generated with primers 3692 (5′-GGAATTCAATGTAGACCACAAGTGATTATATG-3′) and 3699 (5′-GGAATTCTTTGAGCCTCCTCGCAGGTTTTTATAATTTTATCGC-3′). S1 Nuclease Assay—The S1 nuclease protection assay was performed as described previously (4Garcia Vescovi E. Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), with RNA harvested form mid exponential phase cultures (A600 nm of 0.4–0.6) grown in 50 ml of N-minimal medium, pH 7.7, containing 10 μm MgCl2. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. A PCR product generated with primers 3724 (5′-CACGCCTCCTGGCCATGAAATATGTC-3′) and 3725 (5′-CGCCCAACTGGAAACAAAGCCGTCAG-3′) and Salmonella chromosomal DNA as template was used as probe. The probe was labeled at the 5′-end by phosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) as described previously (28Kato A. Latifi T. Groisman E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4706-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Purification of the SlyA-FLAG and PhoP-His6 Proteins—Salmonella wild-type strain (14028s) harboring plasmid pUHE21–2lacIq-slyA-FLAG (C terminus) was grown at 37 °C shaking to A600 nm 0.2 in 500 ml of N minimal medium, pH 7.4, containing 10 μm MgCl2; then isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration, 0.5 mm) was added, and bacteria continued to be incubated for another 2 h. Cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline once, resuspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and opened by sonication. The whole cell lysate was used for SlyA-FLAG purification by mixing with EZview Red Anti-FLAG M2 affinity Gel (Sigma) following the instructions from the manufacturer. Purification of the PhoP-His6 protein was performed as described previously (28Kato A. Latifi T. Groisman E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4706-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). DNase I Footprinting—DNase I protection assays were carried out using DNA fragments amplified by PCR using Salmonella chromosomal DNA as template. Prior to the PCR, primers 3695 (5′-GAAATATGTCAGATAAAACGAATG-3′) and 3699 (see above) were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The ugtL promoter region was amplified with primers γ-32P-3695 and 3699 for the coding strand or with 3695 and γ-32P-3699 for the noncoding strand. Approximately 25 pmol of labeled DNA and 0, 15, 30, or 60 pmol of the PhoP-His6 protein or 0, 5, 15, or 30 pmol of the SlyA-FLAG protein in a 100-μl volume were incubated at room temperature for 15 min in a buffer of the following composition: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 50mm KCl, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 10% glycerol. DNase I (Invitrogen) (0.05 unit) was added, and the samples were incubated for 3 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 25 mm EDTA. DNA fragments were purified with the Wizard DNA cleanup system (Promega, Madison, WI) and dissolved in 30 μl of H2O. Samples (6 μl) were analyzed by denaturing 6% PAGE by comparison with a DNA sequence ladder generated with the appropriate primer by using a Maxam and Gilbert A+G reaction. Bacterial Killing Assays—Bacterial killing assays by antimicrobial peptides were carried out in duplicate, and the survival percentage was determined as described previously (21Shi Y. Cromie M.J. Hsu F.F. Turk J. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase Assays—β-Galactosidase assays were carried out in triplicate, and the activity was determined as described previously (29Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). The Regulatory Gene slyA Is Essential for Transcription of the PhoP-activated ugtL Gene—We analyzed the 536-bp region upstream of the ugtL coding region but did not find an obvious PhoP box sequence resembling the (T/G)GTTTA-N5-(T/G)GTTTA motif at an equivalent position as the PhoP box present in the promoter region of other PhoP-activated genes characterized in E. coli (14Minagawa S.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6287-6294Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility of other regulatory proteins being involved in ugtL transcription. Thus, we compared transcription of the ugtL gene in a strain harboring a chromosomal ugtL-lac fusion with that exhibited by a set of isogenic strains with mutations in the regulatory genes phoP, pmrA, or slyA. The rationale for choosing the pmrA and slyA mutants was that they exhibit increased susceptibility to polymyxin B (6Groisman E.A. Kayser J. Soncini F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7040-7045Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and virulence attenuation (18Libby S.J. Goebel W. Ludwig A. Buchmeier N. Bowe F. Fang F.C. Guiney D.G. Songer J.G. Heffron F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), respectively, like a phoP mutant (1Miller S.I. Kukral A.M. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5054-5058Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 2Fields P.I. Groisman E.A. Heffron F.

Chamnongpol S. Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. Cell. 2000; 103: 113-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Mutation of the slyA gene abolished ugtL transcription under all tested conditions (i.e. Luria-Bertani broth and N minimal medium with 10 μm or 10 mm Mg2+) (Fig. 1A and data not shown), whereas wild-type levels of ugtL transcription were detected in the pmrA mutant (data not shown). Consistent with our previous results (22Hilbert F. del Portillo F.G. Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2158-2165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the low Mg2+ activation of the ugtL gene was PhoP-dependent (Fig. 1A). The phenotype of the slyA mutant is solely the result of a lack of slyA gene function because ugtL transcription could be restored to wild-type levels by a plasmid containing a wild-type copy of the slyA gene (Fig. 1B). We determined that the transcription start site of the ugtL gene is located 176 bp upstream of the putative start codon of ugtL and requires functional phoP and slyA genes (Fig. 2A). These experiments demonstrate that the regulatory genes phoP and slyA are required for ugtL transcription.Fig. 2The PhoP and SlyA proteins bind to the ugtL promoter and are required for ugtL transcription. A, S1 nuclease protection assay of RNAs extracted from bacteria grown in N medium, pH 7.4, with 10 μm Mg2+. Lane AG corresponds to Maxam and Gilbert A+G reaction. An S1 product is observed in wild-type Salmonella (14028s) but not in the phoP (MS7953s) or slyA (EG14078) mutants. B, DNase I footprinting analysis of the ugtL promoter performed with probes for the coding and noncoding strands (see “Experimental Procedures”) and increasing amounts of PhoP (15, 30, and 60 pmol) or SlyA (5, 15, and 30 pmol) proteins. Solid vertical lines correspond to regions protected by the PhoP or SlyA proteins. C, DNA sequence of the sifB-ugtL intergenic region.

Numbering is from the putative start codon of ugtL.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Expression of the slyA Gene from a Heterologous Promoter Fails to Rescue ugtL Transcription in a phoP Mutant—Because PhoP has been implicated in transcription of one of the promoters of the slyA gene (20Norte V.A. Stapleton M.R. Green J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3508-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that slyA expression from a heterogeneous promoter would restore ugtL transcription in a phoP mutant. Unexpectedly, plasmid pslyA, harboring a wild-type copy of the slyA gene, could not recover ugtL expression in the phoP mutant despite restoring wild-type levels of ugtL transcription to the slyA mutant (Fig. 1B). These results argue that the role of the PhoP protein in ugtL expression is not limited to promoting transcription of the slyA gene. We explored the possibility that the PhoP protein may also control the levels of the SlyA protein at a post-transcriptional level by expressing a SlyA-FLAG protein from a heterologous promoter in wild-type and phoP strains. (The slyA-FLAG gene restored ugtL transcription to the slyA mutant but not to the phoP mutant, like the wild-type slyA gene (data not shown).) However, the phoP mutant harbored amounts of SlyA-FLAG protein similar to that of the wild-type strain (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the PhoP protein may modify the activity of the SlyA protein and/or act in conjunction with SlyA to promote ugtL transcription. The SlyA and PhoP Proteins Bind to the ugtL Promoter—We conducted gel shift assays using the purified SlyA-FLAG and PhoP-His6 proteins and a 536-bp DNA fragment corresponding to the intergenic region between the ugtL gene and the upstream sifB gene. We determined that these proteins could individually gel shift the DNA fragment (data not shown), indicating the presence of binding sites for SlyA and PhoP in the ugtL promoter region. Then, we conducted DNase I footprinting assays and found that the PhoP protein binds to two regions of the ugtL promoter: an upstream region harboring an imperfect hexanucleotide repeat resembling a PhoP box but located in the opposite strand, and a +1-proximal region with no resemblance to the PhoP box and overlapping the potential –10 of the ugtL promoter. The region protected by the SlyA protein extends beyond the transcription start site for the ugtL gene (Fig. 2C), which was unexpected given that slyA functions as an activator of ugtL transcription (Fig. 1A). The region protected by SlyA includes the imperfect palindrome TTTAG-N7-CTTAA, which is similar to the SlyA binding sequence TTAG-N4-CTAA described for the slyA promoter (32Stapleton M.R. Norte V.A. Read R.C. Green J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17630-17637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the only SlyA-regulated promoter investigated in molecular detail. These results demonstrate that the PhoP and SlyA proteins bind to the ugtL promoter. The PhoP Binding Sites in the ugtL Promoter Are Required for Binding of the PhoP Protein to the ugtL Promoter in Vitro and for Transcription of the ugtL Gene in Vivo—To examine the role of the PhoP binding sites in the ugtL promoter, we generated a set of isogenic strains harboring wild-type sequences or nucleotide substitutions at either the upstream or downstream PhoP binding sites in the ugtL promoter. (These three strains also harbored a CmR cassette within the sifB open reading frame, the presence of which did not alter ugtL transcription (data not shown).) First, we carried out DNase I footprinting assays using the ugtL promoter fragments bearing mutations in the PhoP1 or PhoP2 sites: we demonstrated that the PhoP protein bound to the PhoP1 site even when the PhoP2 site was mutated and vice versa (Fig. 3B). Then, we investigated ugtL transcription and determined that strains harboring mutations in either the PhoP1 site or the PhoP2 site exhibited very low levels of ugtL transcription (Fig. 3A), similar to those displayed by the phoP mutant. These results demonstrate that binding of the PhoP protein to both PhoP binding sites in the ugtL promoter is required for ugtL transcription. The PhoP Protein Binds to the Promoter of the slyA Gene— Investigation of PhoP-controlled slyA transcription has been carried out using plasmid-borne constructs harboring the slyA promoter region (20Norte V.A. Stapleton M.R. Green J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3508-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, we reevaluated slyA transcription using isogenic wild-type and phoP strains harboring a lac gene fusion immediately downstream of the chromosomal copy of the slyA gene. When the slyA+-lac bacteria were grown under PhoP-inducing conditions (i.e. 10 μm Mg2+), the β-galactosidase activity was dependent on a functional PhoP/PhoQ system (Fig. 4A). As expected for a PhoP-activated gene, there was no slyA transcription when bacteria were grown under PhoP-repressing conditions (i.e. 10 mm Mg2+), regardless of the presence of a functional phoP gene (Fig. 4A). It has been suggested that the PhoP protein regulates the slyA gene indirectly because a PhoP box could not be identified in the slyA promoter (20Norte V.A. Stapleton M.R. Green J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3508-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, DNase I footprinting analysis of a 345-bp fragment comprising the slyA promoter revealed that the PhoP protein protected two regions (Fig. 4B). One of these regions resembled one of the hexamers that make up a PhoP box, but it was located on the opposite strand (Fig. 4C), as found in the ugtL promoter (Fig. 2B). The two regions protected by the PhoP protein are located within a 101-bp fragment shown previously to be necessary and sufficient for PhoP-mediated transcription of a plasmid-borne slyA promoter (20Norte V.A. Stapleton M.R. Green J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3508-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the PhoP protein controls slyA transcription directly. SlyA Is Required for Resistance to Antimicrobial Peptides Magainin 2 and Polymyxin B—We hypothesized that the slyA mutant would be susceptible to the antimicrobial peptides magainin 2 and polymyxin B because the slyA gene is necessary for transcription of the ugtL gene (Fig. 1A) and because the ugtL gene is required for resistance to these antimicrobial peptides (21Shi Y. Cromie M.J. Hsu F.F. Turk J. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Indeed, the slyA mutant was as susceptible as the ugtL mutant to polymyxin B (Fig. 5A). The hypersusceptibility of the slyA mutant is due solely to the absence of ugtL expression because transcription of the ugtL gene from a heterologous promoter restored wild-type levels of polymyxin B resistance to the slyA mutant (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, the slyA mutant was more susceptible to magainin 2 than the ugtL mutant (Fig. 5C), and ugtL transcription from a heterologous promoter recovered magainin 2 resistance only partially in the slyA mutant (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that SlyA controls expression of magainin 2 resistance determinants in addition to the ugtL gene, which appears to be the sole SlyA-regulated gene mediating polymyxin B resistance. We have identified the first example of a regulatory circuit involving the virulence regulatory proteins PhoP and SlyA of S. enterica. We have established that transcription of the magainin 2 and polymyxin B resistance gene ugtL is controlled by the PhoP and SlyA proteins in what appears to be a feed-forward loop design (Fig. 6). This model is supported by the following data. (i) ugtL transcription was abolished in phoP and slyA mutants when bacteria were grown under PhoP-inducing conditions (Fig. 1A). (ii) The PhoP and SlyA proteins footprinted the ugtL promoter (Fig. 2C). (iii) Mutation of the PhoP binding sites in the ugtL promoter reduced ugtL transcription to the levels observed in a phoP mutant (Fig. 3A). (iv) slyA transcription was abolished in a phoP mutant in bacteria grown under PhoP-inducing conditions (Fig. 4A). (v) The PhoP protein footprinted the slyA promoter (Fig. 4B). And (vi) the slyA mutant was hypersensitive to the antimicrobial peptides polymyxin B (Fig. 5, A and B) and magainin 2 (Fig. 5, C and D), like a ugtL mutant. Transcriptional Activation of the ugtL Promoter—The majority of PhoP-activated promoters described to date harbor a conserved hexanucleotide repeat separated by 5 nucleotides, termed the PhoP box, located 12 bp upstream of the –10 region (14Minagawa S. Ogasawara H. Kato A. Yamamoto K. Eguchi Y. Oshima T. Mori H. Ishihama A. Utsumi R. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3696-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The ugtL promoter is atypical in that it contains a PhoP box further upstream of the –10 and located in the opposite strand (i.e. the PhoP1 site). There is a second PhoP binding site that overlaps the –10 region of the ugtL promoter and does not resemble a PhoP box (i.e. the PhoP2 site.). Mutation of the PhoP1 or PhoP2 sites abolished ugtL transcription (Fig. 3A), possibly because it prevented binding of the PhoP protein to the ugtL promoter as suggested by the DNase I footprinting results (Fig. 3B). These features of the ugtL promoter are atypical for PhoP-regulated promoters and could be the reason that ugtL transcription also requires the SlyA protein (Fig. 1A). The SlyA protein bound to a region located downstream from the ugtL transcription start site (Fig. 2B), which is unusual for a regulatory protein that is promoting gene transcription (Fig. 1A). However, this is not unprecedented because both the response regulator PhoP from Bacillus subtilis (which is not related to the Salmonella PhoP) (33Qi Y. Hulett F.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and the regulatory protein Rns from E. coli (34Munson G.P. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have been shown to have binding sites downstream of the +1 that are necessary for gene transcription. Feed-forward Control of ugtL Transcription—One of the most prevalent regulatory circuit configurations in E. coli is the coherent feed-forward loop in which a regulatory protein controls transcription of a second regulatory protein, and both regulatory proteins together regulate a third target gene (35Shen-Orr S.S. Milo R. Mangan S. Alon U. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2242) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that a coherent feed-forward loop can prevent activation in response to transient signals and respond only to persistent signals (35Shen-Orr S.S. Milo R. Mangan S. Alon U. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2242) Google Scholar). The PhoP and SlyA protein appear to be part of a feed-forward loop that controls transcription of the ugtL gene and possibly additional PhoP-regulated genes. The PhoP protein was required for slyA transcription (Ref. 20Norte V.A. Stapleton M.R. Green J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3508-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar and Fig. 4A) and footprinted two regions of the slyA promoter (Fig. 4B) that are part of a DNA fragment shown to be sufficient to mediate PhoP-mediated transcription of a plasmidborne slyA promoter (20Norte V.A. Stapleton M.R. Green J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3508-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The upstream binding site exhibits higher affinity for the PhoP protein than the second site and consists of sequences partially resembling half of a PhoP box and located in the opposite strand (Fig. 4C), as found in the ugtL promoter. The second PhoP binding site overlaps the putative –10 sequence of the slyA promoter (Fig. 4C), also like the ugtL promoter (Fig. 2B). Although others have proposed that the PhoP protein regulates slyA transcription indirectly (i.e. by modulating the expression of another regulatory protein), our results argue that PhoP controls slyA transcription directly (i.e. by binding to the slyA promoter.) We ruled out a classical transcriptional cascade model involving the PhoP protein controlling transcription of the slyA gene, which, in turn, would be solely responsible for ugtL transcription because expression of the slyA gene from a heterologous promoter failed to restore ugtL transcription in a phoP mutant although it fully complemented a slyA mutant (Fig. 1B). Moreover, similar levels of a SlyA-FLAG protein produced from a heterologous promoter were detected in wild-type and phoP strains (Fig. 1C), suggesting that PhoP does not affect SlyA stability. Taken together with the identification of binding sites for both the SlyA and PhoP proteins in the ugtL promoter (Fig. 2C), these results support the notion of a feed-forward design in the regulation of ugtL transcription. One of the best characterized feed-forward loops is the one governing expression of the araBAD genes mediating the utilization of l-arabinose where two signals that are detected by two different proteins must be present for araBAD expression to occur. The CRP protein directs the synthesis of the AraC protein in response to high levels of cAMP (i.e. the primary signal), and then CRP together with AraC, which is active only in the presence of l-arabinose (i.e. the secondary signal), bind to the araBAD promoter and stimulate transcription (36Mangan S. Zaslaver A. Alon U. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The primary signal in the PhoP-SlyA loop is low Mg2+, which controls the phosphorylated state of the PhoP protein (11Montagne M. Martel A. Le Moual H. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1787-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The identity and even the existence of a secondary signal controlling SlyA are presently unknown. Although binding of the SlyA protein to a small ligand has not been reported, the SlyA protein could respond to a signal present in the low Mg2+ medium used in our experiments and/or generated as a result of activating the PhoP/PhoQ system. Distinct Transcriptional Control of Different Lipid A-modifying Determinants by the PhoP Protein—PhoP-controlled resistance to antimicrobial peptides is mediated by a variety of gene products that typically produce distinct modifications in the lipid A moiety of the lipopolysaccharide. For example, the inner membrane UgtL protein is necessary for the formation of heptaacylmono-phosphorylated lipid A (21Shi Y. Cromie M.J. Hsu F.F. Turk J. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) whereas the PhoP-activated outer membrane protein PagP mediates the palmitoylation of lipid A (37Guo L. Lim K.B. Poduje C.M. Daniel M. Gunn J.S. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Cell. 1998; 95: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In addition, the PhoP-regulated PmrD protein activates the PmrA/PmrB two-component system (17Kox L.F. Wosten M.M. Groisman E.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), which promotes expression of proteins mediating the incorporation 4-aminoarabinose into lipid A (38Gunn J.S. Lim K.B. Krueger J. Kim K. Guo L. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Although full resistance to polymyxin B requires ugtL and pmrA, these genes appear to be differentially regulated by PhoP in that transcription of the former (Fig. 1A), but not the latter, 1Y. Shi and E. A. Groisman, unpublished results. is dependent on the SlyA protein. This indicates that, despite their role in polymyxin B resistance, these determinants are activated independently because the cell surface modifications they promote may help the bacterial cell adapt to the Mg2+-limiting environments that activate the PhoP/PhoQ system. The polymyxin B susceptibility of the slyA mutant was the same as that exhibited by the ugtL mutant (Fig. 5A) and could be complemented to wild-type levels by a plasmid that expressed the ugtL gene from a heterologous promoter (Fig. 5B), suggesting that ugtL is the only SlyA-regulated gene mediating polymyxin B resistance. In contrast, the slyA mutant was more sensitive to magainin 2 than the ugtL mutant (Fig. 5C), and the ugtL-expressing plasmid could not restore wild-type levels of magainin 2 resistance to the slyA mutant (Fig. 5D), which implies that SlyA controls additional genes involved in magainin 2 resistance. Candidate genes include the PhoP-activated pagP and yqjA genes because they have recently been shown to exhibit increase susceptibility to magainin 2 (21Shi Y. Cromie M.J. Hsu F.F. Turk J. Groisman E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Finally, it appears that some of the cell surface remodeling activities controlled by the PhoP/PhoQ system can be expressed in response to other signals. For example, the PmrA/PmrB system promotes expression of the 4-aminoarabinose biosynthesis products that modify lipid A in response to Fe3+ (31Wosten M.M. Kox L.F. Chamnongpol S. Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. Cell. 2000; 103: 113-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 38Gunn J.S. Lim K.B. Krueger J. Kim K. Guo L. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Likewise, the SlyA protein may promote ugtL expression independently of the PhoP protein because the phoP mutant exhibited a residual level of ugtL transcription (Fig. 1A), and slyA promoters have been identified which do not require the PhoP protein for expression (20Norte V.A. Stapleton M.R. Green J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3508-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This suggests that cell surface modifications originally identified as PhoP-regulated may help bacterial survival in environments in addition to those of low Mg2+. We thank F. Solomon for technical support, J. Bijlsma for the initial slyA construct, and A. Kato for discussions."

https://openalex.org/W1999119036,"The tumor suppressor p53 protein stimulates nuclear base excision repair (BER) in vitro. In response to certain cellular stresses, p53 translocates to mitochondria, where it can trigger an apoptotic response. However, a potential role for p53 in modulating mitochondrial DNA repair has not yet been examined. In this study, we show that p53 also modulates mitochondrial BER. Uracil-initiated BER incorporation, which measures flux through the entire BER pathway, was lower in mitochondrial extracts from nonstressed p53 knockout mice than in wild type. The addition of recombinant p53 complemented the BER incorporation in p53 knockout extracts and stimulated BER in wt extracts. The activities of three major mitochondrial DNA glycosylases were similar in extracts from wild-type and knockout animals. Likewise, AP endonuclease activity was unaffected by the absence of p53. Gel shift experiments with recombinant p53 demonstrated that p53 did not bind to the uracil-containing substrate used in the repair assay. Polymerase gamma gap-filing activity was less efficient in p53 knockout extracts, but it was complemented with the addition of recombinant p53. Thus, we conclude that p53 may participate in mtBER by stimulating the repair synthesis incorporation step."
https://openalex.org/W2161086898,"The major light-harvesting complex (LHC-II) of higher plants plays a crucial role in capturing light energy for photosynthesis and in regulating the flow of energy within the photosynthetic apparatus. Native LHC-II isolated from plant tissue consists of three isoforms, Lhcb1, Lhcb2, and Lhcb3, which form homo- and heterotrimers. All three isoforms are highly conserved among different species, suggesting distinct functional roles. We produced the three LHC-II isoforms by heterologous expression of the polypeptide in Escherichia coli and in vitro refolding with purified pigments. Although Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 are very similar in polypeptide sequence and pigment content, Lhcb3 is clearly different because it lacks an N-terminal phosphorylation site and has a higher chlorophyll a/b ratio, suggesting the absence of one chlorophyll b. Low temperature absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of the pure isoforms revealed small but significant differences in pigment organization. The oligomeric state of the pure isoforms and of their permutations was investigated by native gel electrophoresis, sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and SDS-PAGE. Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 formed trimeric complexes by themselves and with one another, but Lhcb3 was able to do so only in combination with one or both of the other isoforms. We conclude that the main role of Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 is in the adaptation of photosynthesis to different light regimes. The most likely role of Lhcb3 is as an intermediary in light energy transfer from the main Lhcb1/Lhcb2 antenna to the photosystem II core.

The light-harvesting pigment protein complexes (LHCs) 1The abbreviations used are: LHC, light-harvesting complex; Chl, chlorophyll; DDM, dodecyl maltoside; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PS, photosystem. in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts are efficient collectors of solar energy. Unlike the reaction center complexes in which chlorophyll (Chl) a is the only green pigment, the LHCs contain defined amounts of both Chl a and Chl b, and are therefore often referred to as Chl a/b binding complexes (1Paulsen H. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 367-382Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 2Peter G.F. Thornber J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16745-16754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LHC-II, the most abundant Chl a/b complex, alone accounts for roughly one-third of the total membrane protein in plant thylakoids (2Peter G.F. Thornber J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16745-16754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is mainly associated with photosystem II (PS II) forming the PS II·LHC-II supercomplex in which LHC-II surrounds the reaction center. The main role of LHC-II in this assembly is the absorption and transfer of solar energy to the reaction center through the so-called minor LHCs (Lhcb4, Lhcb5, and Lhcb6) (3Simpson D.J. Knoetzel J. Advances in Photosynthesis. Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 493-506Google Scholar), which are similar to LHC-II in pigment content and gene sequence. In addition, LHC-II plays an important role in balancing the transfer of excitation energy to PS I and II. Under conditions in which an excess of light energy is transmitted to PS II, a redox-controlled kinase phosphorylates LHC-II at a threonine near the N terminus. The outer LHC-II complexes then detach from the PS II·LHC-II supercomplex, thereby reducing the amount of excitation energy directed to PS II (4Bennett J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 281-311Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In this way, plant photosynthesis is able to adapt optimally to varying light conditions on a short timescale. The structure and function of LHC-II have been studied extensively. It is well known that LHC-II is a trimer in detergent solution (5Butler P.J.G. Kühlbrandt W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3797-3801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in two-dimensional crystals (6Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Nature. 1991; 350: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) and most likely also in the thylakoid membrane. Electron image processing of PS II·LHC-II supercomplexes revealed a large variety of assemblies (7Barber J. Kühlbrandt W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 8Boekema E.J. Hankamer B. Bald D. Kruip J. Nield J. Boonstra A.F. Barber J. Rogner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 1999; 266: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). At least three kinds of LHC-II binding sites were found, suggesting that LHC-II is playing an important role in the organization of these supercomplexes. The excitation energy transfer within the LHC-II complex occurs on a timescale of femtoseconds (10Ide J.P. Klug D.R. Kühlbrandt W. Porter G. Barber J. Ultrafast Phenomena. 1986; 5: 406-408Crossref Google Scholar, 11Fleming G.R. van Grondelle R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 12Peterman E.J.G.

High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed that each LHC-II monomer binds 7–9 Chl a, 5–7 Chl b, two luteins, and one neoxanthine, plus small, nonstoichiometric amounts of violaxanthine (5Butler P.J.G. Kühlbrandt W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3797-3801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Rogl H. Kühlbrandt W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16214-16222Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Yang C. Kosemund K. Cornet C. Paulsen H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16205-16213Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An atomic model based on cryoelectron microscopy of two-dimensional crystals (16Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar) showed the arrangement of 12 Chl a and b and two luteins in the protein scaffold. Recently, the positions of the two remaining Chl and of neoxanthine and violaxanthine were determined in an x-ray structure at 2.72 Å resolution (17Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X. Chang W. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). The structure also revealed the identities of the Chl as Chl a or Chl b, and the majority of LHC-II binds therefore eight Chl a, six Chl b, two luteins, one neoxanthine, and one violaxanthine. LHC-II isolated from thylakoid membranes is a mixture of several closely related gene products. The LHC-II genes are divided into three classes, referred to as Lhcb1, Lhcb2, and Lhcb3. Typically, all three are found in multiple copies in the genomes of higher plants (18Jansson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 19Jansson S. Pichersky E. Bassi R. Green B.R. Ikeuchi M. Melis A. Simpson D.J. Spangfort M.D. Staehelin L.A. Thornber J.P. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1992; 10: 242-253Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis thaliana, for example, there are five and four copies of Lhcb1 and Lhcb2, respectively, but only one copy of Lhcb3 (20Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 1360-1385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Each gene encodes an apoprotein of about 25 kDa. The protein products of these gene classes are referred to as LHC-II isoforms and can be correlated directly to the corresponding genes (21Morishige D.T. Thornber J.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The most abundant Lhcb1 isoform accounts for roughly 70% of the total LHC-II protein, whereas Lhcb2 and Lhcb3 account for ∼20 and ∼10%, respectively (18Jansson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 22Jackowski G. Kacprzak K. Jansson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The Lhcb1–3 isoforms are similar enough to form homo- and heterotrimers in various combinations. At least three combinations, namely Lhcb1 homotrimers, Lhcb1/Lhcb2 heterotrimers, and Lhcb1/Lhcb2/Lhcb3 heterotrimers, were identified by nondenaturing isoelectric focusing in A. thaliana (22Jackowski G. Kacprzak K. Jansson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The situation in other plants is almost certainly similar. LHC-II isoforms are highly conserved among different species. Their polypeptide sequences have undergone little change in several hundred million years of evolution (20Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 1360-1385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (517) Google Scholar). It can therefore be expected that they have distinct functional roles. Indeed, a spatial distribution of different isoforms around the PS II reaction center has been suggested by biochemical investigations of the PS II·LHC-II supercomplex. The LHC-II population on the PS II periphery was found to be enriched in Lhcb2 (23Larsson U.K. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 809: 396-402Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Larsson U.K. Sundby C. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 894: 59-68Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar), whereas Lhcb3 was more tightly attached and thus closer to the minor LHC next to the PS II core (25Bassi R. Rigoni F. Barbato R. Giacometti G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 936: 29-38Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 26Morrissey P.J. Glick R.E. Melis A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1989; 30: 335-344Google Scholar). Plants grown in low light contain higher levels of Lhcb2 (24Larsson U.K. Sundby C. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 894: 59-68Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27Walters R.G. Horton P. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 61: 77-90Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), indicating a role of this isoform in long term light acclimation. In vitro phosphorylation studies with a mixture of LHC-II isolated from plant thylakoids showed that one fraction was phosphorylated three times more rapidly than the bulk of the complex (28Islam K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 333-341Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similar studies indicated that the rapidly phosphorylated form is enriched in Lhcb2 (29Jansson S. Selstam E. Gustafsson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1019: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), consistent with an involvement of this isoform in the adaptation to different light regimes. So far, studies of LHC-II have been carried out either with inherently heterogeneous LHC-II preparations isolated from plants or with recombinant Lhcb1 produced in vitro from its components. A detailed understanding of the functional implications of LHC-II heterogeneity, however, depends on the availability of pure LHC-II isoforms in the amounts necessary for spectroscopic and biochemical investigations. We have produced all three isoforms by in vitro folding of functional complexes from bacterially expressed polypeptide, pigments, and lipids and characterized them biochemically and spectroscopically. Our results indicate a high degree of similarity between Lhcb1 and Lhcb2, whereas Lhcb3 is clearly different with respect to pigment organization, trimer formation, and spectroscopic properties. Genetic Material and Cloning—Apoproteins were expressed with a C-terminal His6 tag in Escherichia coli. Expression levels were similar for the three isoforms, and typically 1 liter of bacterial culture yielded about 100 mg of polypeptide. For expression of the Lhcb1 polypeptide we used the clone C3.2h, which carries the gene lhcb1*2 of pea (30Cashmore A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2960-2964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Rogl H. Kosemund K. Kühlbrandt W. Collinson I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) in a pDS 12 plasmid. cDNAs carrying the lhcb2*1 and Lhcb3 genes from Arabidopsis were provided by the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Ohio State University). For expression of Lhcb2, plasmids from the clone C.32h were amplified by PCR with the His6 tag but without the lhcb1 gene. The amplified lhcb2 gene was inserted into this vector by an introduced SphI cleavage site and transformed to XL1-blue E. coli competent cells. Clones were sequenced and tested for expression. The Lhcb2 apoprotein was expressed in XL1-blue E. coli cells. The lhcb3 gene did not express under the control of the T5 promoter and was produced using the pET expression system controlled by the stronger T7 promoter. NdeI and XhoI cleavage sites were used to insert the lhcb3 gene in a pET-20b(+) vector. To create the XhoI site the additional sequence CTCGAG was added to the 3′-end of lhcb3 resulting in additional Leu and Glu residues at the C terminus of the expressed polypeptide. After transformation the construct was checked by sequencing. The Lhcb3 apoprotein was expressed in BL21(DE3) pLys E. coli cells. Sequence Comparison—Sequence comparisons were performed with the program ClustalW (1.81) on the EMBL Web site (www-db.embl-heidelberg.de). Refolding and Protein Isolation—All three different LHC-II polypeptides formed inclusion bodies during expression and were purified as described previously (32Plumly F.G. Schmidt G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 146-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pigments were isolated from spinach by acetone extraction followed by dioxane precipitation of the carotenoids. LHC-II monomers were refolded by the detergent exchange method (33Paulsen H. Finkenzeller B. Kuhlein N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). 0.6 mg of apoprotein, 0.5 mg of Chl (a/b = 3.0), and 0.15 mg of carotenoids were used for each refolding experiment. Trimers of refolded LHC-II monomers formed on a nickel chelating column as described in Ref. 31Rogl H. Kosemund K. Kühlbrandt W. Collinson I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar. The eluted green fraction was loaded onto partly denaturing gels (see below) or sucrose density gradients (5–35% sucrose, 0.1% n-dodecyl β, d-maltoside (DDM), 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Gradients were centrifuged at 40,000 rpm and 4 °C. For further analysis, monomers and trimers were removed from the gradient and prepared as described below. Gel Electrophoresis—Monomeric and trimeric complexes were separated under partly denaturing conditions on 15% acrylamide gels without SDS at 4 °C in the dark. Samples were loaded in 10% glycerol without SDS. The SDS concentration in the running buffer was 0.1%. To investigate the isoform content of trimers, the complexes were run on SDS-PAGE (34Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). Trimers were first purified on sucrose density gradients and concentrated using Centricon ultrafiltration devices with a 50 kDa cutoff. Equal amounts of complexes were purified further on partly denaturing gels. Gel slices containing LHC-II trimers were excised and transferred to an Eppendorf tube. Protein was extracted by shaking overnight in 30 μl of SDS loading buffer. Complexes were denatured by heating to 95 °C for 5 min prior to loading on the gels. The same procedure was applied to monomeric Lhcb3 complexes. As a further control a fraction at the position of the trimer band was removed from the Lhcb3 gradient and treated the same way. HPLC—Pigments were extracted from sucrose gradient fractions by adding sec-butyl alcohol and NaCl up to a concentration of 33% and 1 m, respectively. Samples were centrifuged for 1 min in a tabletop centrifuge and the green supernatant diluted to a concentration of 80% acetone prior to injection onto the column (Chromolith SpeedROD; RP-18e; Merck). Pigments were separated by applying a gradient of acetone/water buffered with 0.2 mm Tris-HCl to pH 7.0. The pure pigments were quantified by comparing the integrated 440 nm peak with a calibration curve of purified standards. Spectroscopy—Chl concentrations were determined photometrically by the method of Porra et al. (35Porra R.J. Thompons W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4696) Google Scholar). For circular dichroism (CD) and 77 K absorption spectroscopy, sucrose density gradient purified monomers and trimers were concentrated for 3 h at 100,000 rpm in a tabletop ultracentrifuge. Clear supernatant was removed and the remaining sample adjusted with 20% sucrose, 0.1% DDM, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to an A437 of 1.5. Fluorescence emission measurements were performed on samples directly from sucrose density gradients diluted with 20% sucrose, 0.1% DDM, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. CD spectra were recorded with a path length of 1 cm and a slit width of 0.2 nm. The measuring cell was cooled with water to 4 °C. 77 K absorption spectra were recorded with a path length of 1 cm and a slit width of 0.2 mm. Prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen, glycerol and DDM were added to final concentrations of 60 and 0.05%, respectively. A base line recorded with 20% sucrose, 0.05% DDM, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60% glycerol was subtracted from the spectra. Spectra were normalized to A437. To minimize noise, five measurements of the spectral region between 600 and 750 nm were averaged prior to calculation of the fourth derivative. 77 K fluorescence emission spectra were recorded with an excitation of 469 nm (slit width 2 nm) where Chl a absorption is negligible. Emission spectra were recorded with a spectral resolution of 0.5 nm. Sequence Comparisons—A comparison of the polypeptide sequence of the three LHC-II isoforms from Arabidopsis with Lhcb1 from pea is shown in Fig. 1. The residues are numbered as in Lhcb1 from pea for ease of comparison with former studies. The sequences of Lhcb1 from Arabidopsis and pea are very similar, with 91.8% identity and only 2.6% of nonconservative substitutions, mostly within the first 12 residues near the N-terminal phosphorylation site. This is a much higher level of sequence identity than between two isoforms of the same species, as demonstrated by Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 from Arabidopsis, which shows only 66.8% identical residues and 14.2% nonconservative substitutions. When all three isoforms of Arabidopsis are compared, the homology is even lower, with 56.6% identical residues and 24.6% nonconservative substitutions. Major differences occur at the N and C termini and the loop connecting helices C and A. Even though there is considerable sequence variation between the isoforms, most residues with known functions are conserved. This includes most of the side chains involved in Chl binding. The only two exceptions are valine 119, which is changed to an isoleucine in Lhcb2, and the change of leucine 148 to valine in Lhcb3. Both substitutions are conservative, and because the respective Chl are bound via the main chain carbonyl, no effect on Chl content is expected. Another conserved motif is the presumed phosphatidylglycerol binding site at position 16 (WYGPDR) required for trimer formation (36Nussberger S. Dorr K. Wang D.N. Kühlbrandt W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 37Hobe S. Forster R. Klingler J. Paulsen H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10224-10228Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The only change of this motif was found in Arabidopsis Lhcb1 where proline 19 is changed to a serine. The other sequence motifs thought to have a role in trimer formation Ala53-Asp54 (38Standfuss J. Max-Planck-Institute of Biophysics. Johann Wolfang Goethe-Universität, Frankfurt am Main2000Google Scholar) and Ile124-Trp222 (38Standfuss J. Max-Planck-Institute of Biophysics. Johann Wolfang Goethe-Universität, Frankfurt am Main2000Google Scholar, 39Kuttkat A. Hartmann A. Hobe S. Paulsen H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) are similarly conserved, with the single exception of threonine 222 in Lhcb2. The main N-terminal phosphorylation site (threonine 5) is present in both Lhcb1 and Lhcb2. The N terminus of Lhcb3 is 10 residues shorter and lacks the phosphorylation site, implying that this isoform is unable to participate in the redox-controlled regulation of energy distribution. Refolding and Trimer Formation—All three isoforms were refolded into pigment-protein complexes by the addition of the photosynthetic pigments and exchanging the harsh detergent lauryl dodecyl sulfate against octyl glucoside, a mild, nonionic detergent (33Paulsen H. Finkenzeller B. Kuhlein N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The resulting Chl a/b ratio of the refolded complex depends to some extent on the Chl a/b ratio used for refolding (40Hobe S. Fey H. Rogl H. Paulsen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5912-5919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We chose an initial a/b ratio of 3, which results in complexes that are virtually identical to native LHC-II in pigment composition. Partly denaturing gel electrophoresis, which separates free pigment from the folded complex and monomers from trimers, showed single green monomer bands for the pure refolded isoforms. The absence of bands of higher molecular mass indicated that none of the isoforms produced trimers spontaneously under these conditions. Yields were estimated by the Chl content of monomer bands and were very similar for all three isoforms. An effective method to induce trimer formation of Lhcb1 in vitro is the slow elution of the monomers from a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column in the presence of the lipid phosphatidylglycerol (31Rogl H. Kosemund K. Kühlbrandt W. Collinson I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We used this method to determine whether Lhcb2 and Lhcb3 form trimers under the same conditions as Lhcb1. Eluted samples were again analyzed by partly denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). The relative amounts of monomers and trimers obtained were very similar for Lhcb1 and Lhcb2. In both cases, the trimer was the predominant form, whereas only a faint trimer band was found for Lhcb3 under the same conditions. The Lhcb3 trimer band was observed only when the protein was loaded onto the gel within 30 min after elution from the column, indicating that the Lhcb3 homotrimer is unstable. Unlike Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 in ∼ 50% of the experiments Lhcb3 also showed a faint dimer band, possibly because of nonspecific aggregation, but most of the protein remained in the monomeric state. Monomers and trimers of the isoforms were prepared by sucrose density gradient centrifugation for biochemical and biophysical studies. Typical sucrose density gradients are shown in Fig. 2. Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 produced reproducible monomer and trimer bands on the gradient. For Lhcb3 only a strong monomer band was found, indicating that the small amount of Lhcb3 homotrimer seen on the gels was unstable on the timescale of a sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Plants contain not only LHC-II homotrimers but heterotrimers as well. To investigate the in vitro formation of heterotrimers, all permutations of monomeric isoforms were applied in equal amounts to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The amounts of monomers and trimers obtained in each case were compared on partly denaturing gels and sucrose density gradients (Fig. 2). A mixture of Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 gave a trimer band of comparable intensity to trimers of pure Lhcb1 or Lhcb2. All permutations containing Lhcb3 (Lhcb1/Lhcb3, Lhcb2/Lhcb3, Lhcb1/Lhcb2/Lhcb3) also showed a dominant trimer band but a higher amount of monomers than those that did not contain this isoform. This demonstrates that Lhcb3 has a stronger tendency to remain monomeric even in the presence of the other isoforms. The polypeptide composition of the trimers was studied by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). Trimers derived from pure isoforms, 1:1 mixtures of two isoforms, and a 1:1:1 mixture of all three isoforms were purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Any residual monomers were removed by partly denaturing gel electrophoresis. Trimers or, in the case of Lhcb3, monomers, were investigated by SDS-PAGE. Because of their nearly identical molecular mass, the Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 polypeptides migrated as a single band. Lhcb3 migrated at lower molecular mass and was therefore easily distinguished from the other two isoforms. All trimers from mixtures containing Lhcb3 (Lhcb1/Lhcb3, Lhcb2/Lhcb3, Lhcb1/Lhcb2/Lhcb3) showed a clear band of the Lhcb3 polypeptide. Lhcb3, although unable to form stable trimers by itself, is therefore able to form oligomers with both Lhcb1 and Lhcb2. In all mixtures the intensity of the Lhcb3 band was significantly lower than that of Lhcb1 and Lhcb2, probably because Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 have strong tendencies to form homotrimers, so there is less material available for heterotrimers with Lhcb3. HPLC—LHC-II isolated from plant thylakoids contains Chl a, Chl b, and the three carotenoids lutein, neoxanthine, and violaxanthine. The pigment content of the three LHC-II isoforms was determined by HPLC of refolded monomers and trimers separated on sucrose density gradients. Because there are two copies of lutein/LHC-II monomer (2Peter G.F. Thornber J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16745-16754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) we used this carotenoid as an internal standard to quantify the number of pigment molecules bound/polypeptide. Results of the HPLC analysis of monomers and homotrimers from four independent folding experiments are presented in Table I.Table IPigment stoichiometry of LHC-II isoforms as determined by HPLC analysis of monomers and trimers derived from sucrose density gradient centrifugationNxVxLuChl bChl aChl a/bLhcb1 M0.86 ± 0.050.11 ± 0.0227.06 ± 0.367.82 ± 0.311.11Lhcb2 M0.80 ± 0.090.14 ± 0.0226.90 ± 0.368.01 ± 0.081.16Lhcb3 M0.72 ± 0.050.14 ± 0.0126.13 ± 0.288.32 ± 0.261.36Lhcb1 T0.86 ± 0.020.07 ± 0.0127.72 ± 0.158.49 ± 0.241.10Lhcb2 T0.80 ± 0.080.07 ± 0.0127.58 ± 0.288.48 ± 0.281.12 Open table in a new tab Overall, the pigment content of the three isoforms was close to that found by previous HPLC analyses of native LHC-II and refolded Lhcb1 (5Butler P.J.G.

Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X. Chang W. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). The Chl a/b ratio of refolded Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 trimers was 1.10 and 1.12, respectively. The observed number of Chl was 16, rather than 14–15 in the monomers, probably because of small amounts of nonspecifically attached Chl a and Chl b that were not removed on the sucrose gradient. Although the pigment content of Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 monomers was roughly the same, that of Lhcb3 was different. The neoxanthine content of that isoform was slightly lower but remained within the standard deviation of the experiments. Its Chl a/b ratio of 1.36 was significantly higher, mostly because of a lower Chl b content corresponding to about one Chl b less than in Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 monomers. CD Spectroscopy—The CD spectrum of LHC-II in the visible wavelength range is a sensitive monitor of intramolecular pigment-pigment interactions. In addition, it distinguishes between monomeric and trimeric LHC-II. The CD spectrum of trimeric LHC-II is characterized by a strong negative peak around 472 nm, which is absent in the monomer (41Hobe S. Prytulla S. Kühlbrandt W. Paulsen H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3423-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). CD spectra of the refolded monomeric and trimeric LHC-II isoforms are shown in Fig. 4. They"

Results provide an understanding for the catalytic role of conserved residues in dUTPases. Due to the chemical reactivity of DNA, numerous mutagenic and carcinogenic modifications to mammalian genome occur daily (1Friedberg E. Walker G. Siede W. DNA Mutagenesis and Repair. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 108-133Google Scholar). Preserving DNA integrity is of vital importance. The ubiquitous enzyme dUTPase performs a key role in preventing uracil incorporation into DNA by catalyzing the cleavage of dUTP into dUMP and pyrophosphate (2Shlomai J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3305-3312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This reaction contributes to thymidylate biosynthesis and strictly controls cellular dUTP/dTTP ratios (3Pearl L.H. Savva R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 485-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Targeting enzymes of de novo thymidylate biosynthesis by fluorouracil or methotrexate is a widely used approach in anticancer chemotherapy (4Aherne G.W. Browne S. Jackman A.L. Anticancer Development Guide: Antifolate Drugs in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 409-421Google Scholar). These drugs perturb the cellular dUTP/dTTP pool resulting in synthesis of highly uracil-substituted DNA. Uracil-DNA transforms base-excision repair into a hyperactive cycle inducing DNA double-strand breaks and thymine-less cell death. This pathway preferentially kills cells actively synthesizing DNA, such as tumor and virus-infected cells. Moreover, in human cancer cell lines, dUTPase overexpression leads to development of fluorouracil resistance (5Canman C.E. Radany E.H. Parsels L.A. Davis M.A. Lawrence T.S. Maybaum J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2296-2298PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the clinical benefits of an anticancer therapy based on inducing thymine-less cell death may ultimately depend on the critical interplay among several enzymes involved in thymidylate metabolism. The recent finding of activation of dUTPase gene expression in p53 mutant tumor cells has reinforced the notion that this enzyme plays a significant role in tumor development and survival (6Pugacheva E.N. Ivanov A.V. Kravchenko J.E. Kopnin B.P. Levine A.J. Chumakov P.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4595-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The potential initiative role of dUTPase antagonism in thymine-less cell death has prompted investigations into the enzymatic mechanism. Detailed description of the catalytic mechanism is central to enzymology (7Benkovic S.J. Hammes-Schiffer S. Science. 2003; 301: 1196-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 8Knowles J.R.

Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1100-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), mechanistic issues remain obscure. Using water labeled with 18O, it was established that the water oxygen gets bonded to dUMP and not to the pyrophosphate, arguing for initiation of the reaction by nucleophilic attack at the α-phosphorus (15Larsson G. Nyman P.O. Kvassman J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24010-24016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A strictly conserved aspartate residue (Asp90 in the Escherichia coli enzyme) in a conserved sequence motif of dUTPases was suggested to activate a water molecule for the nucleophile attack (12Larsson G. Svensson L.A. Nyman P.O. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13Mol C.D. Harris J.M. McIntosh E.M. Tainer J.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24010-24016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, since the presumed catalytic water molecule could not be identified in the structures available to date, there are no reliable structural data about protein side chains involved in the hydrolytic reaction. Moreover, the possibility of a protein atom executing the initial nucleophilic attack could not have been excluded. The binding site of the Mg2+ co-factor was also not localized in the previously reported structures preventing structural insights into its functional role. Recently, the presence of Mg2+ was shown to facilitate substrate binding to both E. coli (16Mustafi D. Bekesi A. Vertessy B.G. Makinen M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5670-5675Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and Drosophila dUTPases (17Kovari J. Barabas O. Takacs E. Bekesi A. Dubrovay Z. Pongracz V. Zagyva I. Imre T. Szabo P. Vertessy B.G.

In the present work, we addressed the unresolved mechanistic issues by three-dimensional structural investigations and kinetic/mutagenesis studies. We determined crystal structures of the wild type E. coli dUTPase:α,β-imino-dUTP:Mg2+, wild type dUTPase:dUMP, Asp90 → Asn mutant dUTPase:dUTP: Mg2+ and Asp90 → Asn mutant dUTPase:α,β-imino-dUTP: Mg2+ complexes (at 1.9-, 1.6-, 1.95-, and 1.7-Å resolution) complexes to identify conformational changes of protein side chains and their interactions with the ligand. A kinetic analysis was performed for the reaction of α,β-imino-dUTP hydrolysis by wild type dUTPase, as well as for the reaction of dUTP hydrolysis by Asp90 → Asn mutant dUTPase. Stepwise comparisons among these structures and the apoenzyme structure (11Gonzalez A. Larsson G. Persson R. Cedergren-Zeppezauer E. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 767-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) together with the kinetic results revealed essential interactions required for catalysis and allowed novel insights into the mechanism. Chemicals, Enzyme Preparation, and Purification—α,β-Imino-dUDP was obtained from Jena Bioscience. α,β-Imino-dUTP was prepared by enzymatic phosphorylation of α,β-imino-dUDP (18Persson T. Larsson G. Nyman P.O. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1996; 4: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and was shown to be over 98% pure by ion exchange chromatography (Fig. 1A). Other chemicals were of proanalysis quality from either Merck or Sigma. The Asp90 → Asn mutant E. coli enzyme was created by QuikChange (Strategene) with mutagenic primers 5′-cctggtaggattgatcAACtctgactatcagggccag-3′ and 5′-ctggccctgatagtcagaGTTgatcaatcctaccagg-3′ on plasmid pET3a-dut (19Persson R.

Wild type and Asp90 → Asn mutant E. coli dUTPase was expressed and purified as described previously (16Mustafi D. Bekesi A. Vertessy B.G. Makinen M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The decrease of α,β-imino-dUTP levels and production of dUMP was followed in aliquots taken at different time points to be analyzed either on a Mono Q anion exchange column or by thin layer chromatography (17Kovari J.

Protein Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals were obtained at 20 °C by hanging-drop vapor diffusion. The protein/ligand solution prepared for co-crystallization contained 3 mg/ml enzyme, 1.25 mm α,β-imino-dUTP, or 5 mm dUTP, or 1.25 mm dUMP, and 10 mm MgCl2 in 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.0, and 50 mm NaCl. dUTPase:ligand: Mg2+ solution was mixed with equal volume of reservoir solution (0.1 m Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 18–20% polyethylene glycol 3350 and 400 mm sodium acetate). For data collection, crystals were introduced into cryoprotectant containing 10% glycerol and appropriate amounts of ligand in reservoir solution, then flash-frozen in a 100 K nitrogen stream. Three data sets were collected at various synchrotron beamlines at European Molecular Biology Laboratory/German Electron Synchrotron Facility (DESY) (Hamburg, Germany): wild type E. coli dUTPase:α,β-imino-dUTP:Mg2+ at PX11, wild type E. coli dUTPase: dUMP:Mg2+ at PX13, and mutant E. coli dUTPase:dUTP:Mg2+ at BW7B; while the fourth data set of the mutant E. coli dUTPase:α,β-imino-dUTP:Mg2+ was collected at the ID14-4 European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). Data processing and scaling were carried out using MOSFLM (21Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 & ESF-EAMCB Newslett. Protein Crystallogr. 1992; 26Google Scholar) and SCALA (22Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol.

Catalytic competence of the enzyme in the crystal phase was checked by competition experiments with the native substrate dUTP. Crystals of wild type dUTPase containing α,β-imino-dUTP were washed with reservoire solution and dUTP was added at 10 mm concentration. Hydrolysis was followed by discontinuous thin layer chromatography activity test (24Barabas O. Rumlova M. Erdei A. Pongracz V. Pichova I. Vertessy B.G. J. Biol.

Structure Determination and Refinement—Structures of wild type and Asp90 → Asn mutant dUTPases, in complexes with α,β-imino-dUTP:Mg2+, dUTP:Mg2+, and dUMP, were solved by molecular replacement (MOLREP (25Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4098) Google Scholar)). The apo-dUTPase structure (11Gonzalez A. Larsson G. Persson R. Cedergren-Zeppezauer E. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 767-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was used as search model for all the four presently determined structures to exclude any model bias with respect to the ligand position. The asymmetric unit contained one monomer. In each case, the resultant initial maps were of exceptional quality, allowing residues 1–136 and entire ligands to be built with ease. Generation of monomer libraries for the ligands (α,β-imino-dUTP, dUTP) and refinement were carried out using CCP4i and Refmac5 (22Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). Positional and B-factor refinement rounds were altered with manual rebuilding steps using the graphics program O (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The Experimental Approach—Previous dUTPase complex structures identified the protein fold and the overall characteristics of active site architecture; however, they failed to provide an understanding of the catalytic mechanism (10Dauter Z.

Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1100-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This failure was probably due to the fact that these structures represented dead-end enzyme-inhibitor complexes. To produce the relevant enzyme-substrate complexes with lifetimes allowing crystallographic characterization, we considered the following potentials. First, the substrate dUTP was replaced by the substrate analogue α,β-imino-dUTP. Imino analogues of nucleotide phosphates are commonly used as isosteric mimics of the natural substrates (31Hirshberg M. Stockley R.W. Dodson G. Webb M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 32Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K.C. John J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) both with respect to bond distances (1.63 and 1.68 Å, for P–O–P and P–N–P moieties, respectively) and bond angles (128.7° and 127.2°, for P–O–P and P–N–P, respectively) (33Larsen M. Willett R. Yount R.G. Science. 1969; 166: 1510-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The lower electronegativity of the nitrogen atom results in less reactivity of the phosphate ester imino analogues. Nevertheless, several enzymes (e.g. small GTPase p21 (34Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar), sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase (35Taylor J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9793-9795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and alkaline phosphatase (36Yount R.G. Babcock D. Ballantyne W. Ojala D. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2484-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar)) were reported to catalyze imino-linkage cleavage, arguing for some reactivity associated with the P–N–P moiety. Fig. 1A demonstrates that dUTPase is also capable of hydrolyzing the imino-linkage of α,β-imino-dUTP, while no detectable hydrolysis of the β-γ bond occurs, i.e. the exclusive specificity of dUTPases for α-β bond cleavage is retained in the reaction with the imino analogue as well. Table I summarizes kinetic and ligand binding data for the dUTPase-catalyzed dUTP and α,β-imino-dUTP hydrolysis. The very low kcat value in the α,β-imino-dUTP hydrolysis reaction rendered Km determination unreliable; therefore the previously determined Kd value is presented for comparison (37Vertessy B.G. Larsson G. Persson T. Bergman A.C. Persson R. Nyman P.O. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Assuming rapid equilibrium reactions, as suggested by an earlier kinetic analysis (15Larsson G. Nyman P.O. Kvassman J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24010-24016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), Km and Kd values are expected to be the same. The very close agreement in the nucleotide interaction data (Km, Kd, cf. Table I) for dUTP and the analogue α,β-imino-dUTP strongly suggests highly similar accommodation patterns for these two hydrolysable nucleotides in the dUTPase active site, although the rate of hydrolysis differs by almost 6 orders of magnitude. Based on these kinetic and ligand binding data, both the enzyme-dUTP and the enzyme-α,β-imino-dUTP complex will be termed in the present work as enzyme-substrate complexes (Fig. 1B).Table IKinetic and ligand binding data for wild type and Asp90 → Asn mutant E. coli dUTPase Data represent the average of three to five independent measurements.

Mg2+ binding in the enzyme:α,β-imino-dUTP/dUTP complexes was promoted by novel crystallization conditions at neutral or slightly basic pH values, since deprotonation of side chains has a well known positive effect on metal ion coordination capability. Earlier crystallization solvents contained either acidic buffers (11Gonzalez A. Larsson G. Persson R. Cedergren-Zeppezauer E. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol.

Third, a site-directed mutation was designed to exchange the strictly conserved aspartate side chain (Asp90) within the active site into an asparagine residue. This mutation was expected to decrease the reaction rate and allow for a structural analysis of the enzyme-dUTP complex in the presence of the co-factor Mg2+ ion. Structure of Enzyme-Substrate Complex—dUTPases show exquisite substrate specificity with respect to base, sugar, and phosphate chain moieties of dUTP that is essential to prevent unintended hydrolysis of other high energy-containing nucleotides. Most dUTPases are homotrimers (Fig. 2A) with five conserved sequence motifs in each monomer (Fig. 2B) (10Dauter Z. Persson R. Rosengren A.M. Nyman P.O. Wilson K.S. Cedergren-Zeppezauer E.S. J. Mol.

To study the first step of the reaction, the structure of the dUTPase:α,β-imino-dUTP:Mg2+ complex (Figs. 1D, 2A, 3, A, B, D, E, and 4A and Table II) was determined at 1.9-Å resolution.

The three active sites of the homotrimer are located in clefts between neighboring monomers and recruit conserved motifs from different subunits in a 3-fold symmetric pattern (Fig. 2A). A β-hairpin formed by conserved Motif III from monomer A accommodates the uracil and sugar rings. A conserved tyrosine (Tyr93) stacks to the 2′-deoxyribose ring and sterically excludes ribonucleotides. Phosphate chain recognition is provided by conserved Motifs I, II, and IV of monomer B (Figs. 1, D and E, and 3). Therefore, active site architecture ultimately depends on correct oligomerization of the homotrimer. To our present knowledge, this organization of ligand binding sites is unique among proteins.Fig. 4Interaction mapping in enzyme-substrate (A), and enzyme-product complexes (B). Interactions are shown only for the phosphate chain moiety of the ligand. Due to the close similarity of the nucleotide interactions in the three enzyme-substrate complexes determined in the present study (cf. Fig. 3 and Table I), the map was selected to show the actual distances as found in the wild type dUTPase:α,β-imino-dUTP: Mg2+ (X = N) complex where Wcat is also present. In the Asp90 → Asn mutant dUTPase:α,β-imino-dUTP:Mg2+ (X = N) and Asp90 → Asn mutant dUTPase:dUTP: Mg2+ (X = O) complex, the only significant differences are that (i) Wcat is absent and Asp90Oδ2 becomes AsnNδ2 and (ii) in the Asp90 → Asn mutant dUTPase:dUTP: Mg2+ (X = O) complex, the X-Ser72Oγ interaction is absent.

https://openalex.org/W2065870221,"Defects in interferon (IFN) signaling that result in loss of expression of IFN-inducible proteins are associated with cellular immortalization, an important early event in the development of human cancer. Here we report that loss of IFN-inducible IFI 16 expression in human fibroblasts allows bypass of cellular senescence. We found that levels of IFI 16 mRNA and protein were higher in human old versus young fibroblasts and immortalization of fibroblasts with telomerase resulted in decreased expression of IFI 16. Moreover, overexpression of IFI 16 in immortalized fibroblasts strongly inhibited cell proliferation. Interestingly, knockdown of IFI 16 expression in fibroblasts inhibited p53-mediated transcription, downregulated p21(WAF1) expression, and extended the proliferation potential. Importantly, treatment of immortal cell lines with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, resulted in upregulation of IFI 16. Our observations support the idea that increased levels of IFI 16 in older populations of human fibroblasts contribute to cellular senescence."

The evolutionarily conserved protein Bcl-2 blocks apoptosis induced by a wide array of death signals. Despite extensive research, the molecular milieu that characterizes the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2 has not been fully clarified. In this work, we have investigated the role of bcl-2 in protecting against oxidative death induced by H2O2 in cultured rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. Transfection with the bcl-2 gene rescued PC12 cells from apoptotic death caused by H2O2. Addition of NF-κB inhibitors such as pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone to the medium aggravated oxidative cell death. PC12 cells overexpressing bcl-2 exhibited relatively high constitutive DNA binding and transcriptional activities of NF-κB compared with vector-transfected control cells. Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry revealed that bcl-2-transfected PC12 cells retained a higher level of p65 (the functionally active subunit of NF-κB) in the nucleus compared with vector-transfected controls. In addition, sustained activation of ERK1/2 (upstream of NF-κB) was observed in bcl-2-overexpressing cells. In contrast, the cytoplasmic inhibitor IκBα was present in lower amounts in cells overexpressing bcl-2. The ectopic expression of bcl-2 increased the cellular glutathione level and γ-glutamylcysteine ligase expression, which were attenuated by NF-κB inhibitors. These results suggest that NF-κB plays a role in bcl-2-mediated protection against H2O2-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells through augmentation of antioxidant capacity.

Oxidative stress thus occurs when the production of ROIs increases or when the elimination of ROIs or the repair of oxidatively damaged macromolecules decreases or both. There is a growing body of data indicating that ROIs are a major cause of cellular injuries in a variety of clinical abnormalities, including cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and neurodegenerative disorders (1Markesbery W.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 134-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1949) Google Scholar, 2Droge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7276) Google Scholar). Multiple lines of evidence support that ROIs can cause cell death via apoptosis (3Wood K.A. Youle R.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 17: 400-407Google Scholar, 4Jacobson M.D. Trends Biochem.

So Y.J. Jang J.-H. Lee J.-S. Oh Y.J. Surh Y.-J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 440-449PubMed Google Scholar). Cells undergoing apoptosis exhibit shrinkage of the nucleus, blebbing of membranes, condensation or fragmentation of chromatin, and internucleosomal DNA degradation by endonucleases into fragments in multiples of 180-200 bp. Apoptosis is a tightly regulated process that involves changes in the expression of a distinct set of genes (7Burlacu A. J. Cell. Mol.

One of the major genes responsible for regulating apoptotic cell death is the proto-oncogene bcl-2, which encodes a 26-kDa protein found in the nuclear envelope, parts of the endoplasmic reticulum, and the outer mitochondrial membrane.

Bcl-2 may prevent apoptosis through regulation of an antioxidant pathway and is considered to act as a free radical scavenger. For instance, the protein was found to inhibit lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA and/or protein damage induced by diverse pro-apoptotic stimuli capable of triggering apoptosis (9Zhong L.T.

The ubiquitous eukaryotic transcription factor NF-κB/Rel is known to regulate expression of numerous cellular genes that play important roles in mediating/regulating immune and stress responses, inflammation, apoptosis, and proliferation (15Baeuerle P.A.

Cells that become resistant to oxidative cell death exhibit constitutive activation of NF-κB as an adaptive defense mechanism (20Lezoualc'h F. Sagara Y. Holsboer F. Behl C. J.

In this work, we investigated whether Bcl-2 can protect against H2O2-induced apoptosis through activation of NF-κBin cultured rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. For this purpose, we compared the extent of NF-κB activation and levels of antioxidative defense capacity, especially glutathione metabolism, in bcl-2-transfected and vector-treated control cells to link Bcl-2 and the NF-κB signaling pathways in the context of their commitment to cellular protection against oxidative insults. Chemical and Biochemical Reagents—Poly-d-lysine, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), PDTC, and TPCK were purchased from Sigma. H2O2 was a product of Junsei Chemical Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Hanks' balanced salt solution, fetal bovine serum, horse serum, Geneticin (G418), nutrient mixture F-12, and N-2 supplement were provided by Invitrogen. Dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA), 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolocarbocyanine iodide (JC-1), and tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The in situ cell death detection kit was supplied by Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). The NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide and the luciferase assay kit with reporter lysis buffer were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). [γ-32P]ATP was the product of PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The NF-κB and γ-glutamylcysteine ligase (GCL) promoter-luciferase constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Young Mi Kim (University of Ulsan Medical School, Seoul, Korea) and Dr. Shelly C. Lu (University of Southern California School of Medicine), respectively. Cell Culture—PC12 cells transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector containing the human cytomegalovirus major immediate-early enhancer/promoter followed by a full-length human Bcl-2 cDNA sequence were kindly provided by Dr. Young J. Oh (Yonsei University, Seoul) and maintained in our laboratory. Briefly, DNA transfection was performed with 1 × 105 PC12 cells cultivated on poly-d-lysine-coated 100-mm Petri dishes by adding a transfection mixture of 2 μg of plasmid/10 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Subsequently, single neomycin-resistant colonies were selected and expanded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, and 500 μg/ml G418. Stable PC12 cell lines overexpressing bcl-2 were characterized by immunoblot analysis. PC12 cells transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector without a human bcl-2 cDNA sequence were utilized as a control cell line. The subsequent cultures were conducted as reported previously (6Kim H.-J. So Y.J. Jang J.-H. Lee J.-S. Oh Y.J. Surh Y.-J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 440-449PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of Cell Viability—PC12 cells were plated at a density of 4 × 104 cells/300 μl in 48-well plates, and cell viability was determined using the conventional MTT reduction assay. After incubation, cells were treated with MTT solution (1 mg/ml final concentration) for 2 h. The dark blue formazan crystals formed in intact cells were solubilized with lysis buffer (20% SDS in 50% aqueous N,N-dimethylformamide), and absorbance at 540-595 nm was measured with a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Results are expressed as percent MTT reduction. Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL)—The commercially available in situ death detection kit was utilized to assess DNA fragmentation. PC12 cells (5 × 105 cells/3 ml on a chamber slide) were fixed for 30 min in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution at room temperature. Endogenous peroxidase was inactivated by incubation with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 min at room temperature and further incubated in a permeabilizing solution (0.1% sodium citrate and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 2 min at 4 °C. The cells were incubated with the TUNEL reaction mixture for 60 min at 37 °C, followed by labeling with peroxidaseconjugated anti-goat antibody (Fab fragment) for an additional 30 min. The cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and examined under a confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems Heidelberg GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 525 nm. Western Blot Analysis—Treated cells (1 × 107 cells/7 ml in a 100-mm dish) were collected and washed with PBS. After centrifugation, cell lysis was carried out at 4 °C by vigorous shaking for 15 min in radio-immune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm glycerophosphate, 20 mm NaF, 20 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors). After centrifugation at 23,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was separated and stored at -70 °C until used. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). After addition of sample loading buffer, protein samples were electrophoresed on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride blots at 300 mA for 3 h. The blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in fresh blocking buffer (0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 5% nonfat dry milk). Dilutions (1:1000) of anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bax, anti-poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase, anti-IκBα, anti-p65, anti-phospho-ERK, anti-ERK, anti-phospho-JNK, anti-JNK, anti-phospho-p38, and anti-p38 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); anti-cleaved caspase-3 and anti-phospho-IκBα (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA); and anti-actin (Sigma) primary antibodies were made in PBS with 3% nonfat dry milk. The blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Following three washes with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (PBST), the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in PBS with 3% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were washed again three times with 0.1% PBST, and transferred proteins were incubated with ECL substrate solution (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 min according to the manufacturer's instructions and visualized with x-ray film. Measurement of the Mitochondrial Transmembrane Potential—To measure the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), the lipophilic cationic probes JC-1 and TMRE were used. The green fluorescent JC-1 probe exists as a monomer at low membrane potential. However, at higher potential, JC-1 forms red fluorescent J-aggregates that exhibit a broad excitation spectrum. Following treatment with H2O2 for 6 h, cells (5 × 105 cells/3 ml on a chamber slide) were rinsed with PBS, and JC-1 (10 μg/ml) was loaded. After a 20-min incubation at 37 °C, cells were examined under a confocal microscope with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 530/590 nm. Determination of Δψm was also carried out using TMRE, which rapidly equilibrates between cellular compartments due to potential differences. Thus, a decrease in fluorescence is indicative of reduced Δψm. Following the incubation, the cells were treated with TMRE (150 nm) for 30 min, rinsed, and examined by confocal microscopy in the same manner as done for JC-1, except that the TMRE fluorescence was measured at 590 nm. Measurement of Intracellular ROI Accumulation—To monitor net intracellular accumulation of ROIs, the fluorescent probe DCF-DA was used. After treatment with H2O2 for 30 min, cells (1 × 106 cells/3 ml in 6-well plates) were rinsed with Krebs-Ringer phosphate solution, and 10 μm DCF-DA was loaded. Following an additional incubation for 15 min at 37 °C, cells were examined under a confocal microscope equipped with an argon laser (488 nm, 200 milliwatts). Preparation of Nuclear Proteins—After treatment with H2O2, cells (1 × 107 cells/7 ml in a 100-mm dish) were washed with PBS, centrifuged, and resuspended in ice-cold isotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After incubation in an ice bath for 10 min, cells were centrifuged again and resuspended in ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, followed by incubation at 0 °C for 20 min. After Vortex mixing, the resulting suspension was centrifuged, and the supernatant was stored at -70 °C for the NF-κB DNA binding assay. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—A synthetic double-strand oligonucleotide harboring the NF-κB-binding domain was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and separated from unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP by gel filtration using a nick spin column (Amersham Biosciences). Prior to addition of the γ-32P-labeled oligonucleotide (100,000 cpm), 10 μg of the nuclear extract was kept on ice for 15 min in gel shift binding buffer (4% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 0.1 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA). DNA-protein complexes were resolved by 6% nondenaturing PAGE at 200 V for 2 h, followed by autoradiography. Immunocytochemical Staining for p65 and Phospho-ERK—To detect the activation of p65 and ERK, we have adopted the immunocytochemical method with a monoclonal antibody recognizing p65 or phospho-ERK. Cells (105 cells/1 ml on a chamber slide) were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution for 30 min at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS, cells were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in fresh blocking buffer (0.5% PBST, pH 7.4) containing 10% normal goat serum). Dilutions (1:100) of primary antibodies were made in 0.1% PBST with 1% bovine serum albumin, and cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Following two washes with 0.1% PBST, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody in 0.1% PBST with 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were rinsed with PBS, and stained cells were analyzed under a confocal microscope and photographed. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—One day before transfection, PC12 cells were subcultured at a density of 1 × 106 cells/60-mm dish to maintain ∼60-80% confluency. They were transiently transfected with the NF-κB or GCL promoter-luciferase construct using the transfection reagent N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium (Roche Diagnostics) according to the instructions supplied by the manufacturer. After overnight transfection, the treated cells were harvested and lysed with reporter lysis buffer (Promega luciferase assay system). The cell extract (20 μl) was mixed with 100 μl of the luciferase assay reagent and analyzed with a luminometer (AutoLumat LB 953, EG&G Berthold, Bad Widbad, Germany). The β-galactosidase assay (Promega β-galactosidase enzyme assay system) was done according to the supplier's instructions to normalize the luciferase activity. Assessment of Intracellular GSH Levels—The intracellular GSH levels were assessed using the commercially available colorimetric assay kit BIOXYTECH GSH-400 (OXIS Research, Portland, OR). Cells were harvested and homogenized in meta-phosphoric acid working solution. After centrifugation, 50 μl of R1 solution (solution of the chromogenic reagent in HCl) was added to the 700-μl supernatant, followed by gentle Vortex mixing. Following addition of 50 μl of R2 solution (30% NaOH), the mixtures were incubated at 25 ± 3 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation, the absorbance of the clear supernatant was read at 400 nm. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was lysed, extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen), and converted to cDNA by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed following standard procedures. Specific DNA sequences were amplified with a PCR mixture (HyMed, Seoul). Each PCR primer used in this study was as follows: GCL catalytic subunit (GCLC), 5′-GCC AAG GTC ATCCAT GAC AAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGT GTA GCC CAG GAT GCC CTT-3′ (antisense); GCL modulatory subunit (GCLM), 5′-AGA CCG GGA ACC TGC TCA AC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAT CAC CCT GAT GCC TAA GC-3′ (antisense); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-AGT GTA GCC CAG GAT GCC CTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCC AAG GTC ATC CAT GAC AAC-3′ (antisense). The reaction conditions were 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. After amplification, the products were resolved by electrophoresis on 1.0% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed under ultraviolet light. bcl-2-Overexpressing PC12 Cells Are Less Susceptible to the Cytotoxic Effects of H2O2—To address whether ectopic expression of Bcl-2 can protect against H2O2-induced cell death, PC12 cells were stably transfected with a plasmid harboring the bcl-2 gene. The effects of bcl-2 overexpression on cell survival following exposure to H2O2 were then examined by the MTT reduction assay. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, bcl-2 overexpression rescued PC12 cells from H2O2-induced cytotoxicity. Bcl-2 Overexpression Attenuates Apoptotic Cell Death Induced by H2O2—One of the distinctive biochemical hallmarks of apoptotic cell death is the unique occurrence of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Apoptotic cells were confirmed by TUNEL staining, which is widely used to detect DNA fragmentation in situ. Bcl-2 overexpression reduced H2O2-induced DNA fragmentation as revealed by the decreased proportion of TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 1B). H2O2 treatment also led to the increased expression of Bax, activation of caspase-3, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, which were attenuated in bcl-2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1C). bcl-2 Mitigates the Dissipation of the Mitochondrial Transmembrane Potential and Intracellular Accumulation of Hydroperoxide in H2O2-treated PC12 Cells—When PC12 cells were exposed to H2O2 (250 μm), the mitochondrial membrane became rapidly depolarized, as shown by an increase in green fluorescence and the concomitant disappearance of red fluorescence derived from the JC-1 dye (Fig. 2A, panels a and c). Bcl-2 overexpression reduced the changes in mitochondrial membrane transition (Δψm) as indicated by repression of green fluorescence and restoration of red fluorescence (Fig. 2A, panels b and d). These findings were further supported by use of another voltage-sensitive dye, TMRE. Again, H2O2-induced dissipation of Δψm (Fig. 2A, panel e) was found to be blocked by bcl-2 overexpression (panel f). Accumulation of intracellular hydroperoxide was detected by use of DCF-DA, which is freely permeable to cell membranes. Once inside cells, the compound is hydrolyzed by an esterase activity to DCF and trapped intracellularly. DCF is then able to interact with peroxides to form fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin, which is readily detectable by confocal microscopy. The activation of DCF is relatively specific for the detection of H2O2 and secondary or tertiary peroxides such as lipid peroxides. H2O2-derived intracellular peroxide accumulation decreased in PC12 cells overexpressing bcl-2 (Fig. 2B). NF-κB Inhibitors Render PC12 Cells More Vulnerable to H2O2-induced Cell Death—NF-κB activation in PC12 cells was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay with an oligonucleotide harboring a consensus NF-κB-binding element. Treatment of PC12 cells with H2O2 (100, 250, and 500 μm) caused a concentration-dependent increase in NF-κB DNA binding activity in these cells (Fig. 3A). PDTC, an antioxidant reported to effectively block the IκB degradation pathway (24Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar, 25Chung K.C. Park J.H. Kim C.H. Lee H.W. Sato N. Uchiyama Y. Ahn Y.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 59: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), reduced the DNA binding activity of NF-κB in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). To examine the possible role of NF-κB in protecting against H2O2-induced cytotoxicity, cells were exposed to H2O2 for 9 h in the absence and presence of PDTC (10 μm) or another NF-κB inhibitor, TPCK (5 μm), and cell viability was assessed by the MTT reduction assay. Both PDTC (Fig. 3C) and TPCK (Fig. 3D) exacerbated the H2O2-induced cytotoxicity. Neither of these NF-κB inhibitors exhibited apparent toxicity to PC12 cells at the concentrations used in this experiment. Ectopic Expression of Bcl-2 Leads to Constitutive Activation of NF-κB through Stimulating the Degradation of Cytoplasmic IκBα—In PC12 cells, the DNA binding activity of NF-κB was transiently enhanced by H2O2 treatment (Fig. 4A). PC12 cells overexpressing bcl-2 exhibited relatively high levels of constitutively activated NF-κB compared with vector-transfected control cells (Fig. 4A). Since the NF-κB DNA binding activity is largely regulated by IκBα, which sequesters NF-κB in the cytoplasm, we determined whether the observed increase in nuclear NF-κB binding activity in bcl-2-overexpressing PC12 cells is due to increased IκBα degradation. Protein extracts of both the nucleus and cytoplasm were subjected to Western blot analysis to measure p65, IκBα, or phospho-IκBα. Cytoplasmic IκBα levels were profoundly reduced, whereas phospho-IκB and nuclear p65 levels were constitutively increased in PC12 cells overexpressing bcl-2 compared with control cells (Fig. 4B). We also verified the nuclear accumulation of p65 by immunocytochemistry using anti-p65 antibody (Fig. 4C). The transcriptional activity of NF-κB was also constitutively increased in bcl-2-transfected cells as assessed using an NF-κB-reporter plasmid containing the consensus NF-κB-binding DNA site linked to a luciferase reporter gene (pELAM-Luc). As illustrated in Fig. 4D, the base-line transcriptional activity of NF-κB was found to be approximately six times higher in bcl-2-transfected cells than in vector-transfected control cells. To elucidate a molecular target for NF-κB-mediated potentiation of cellular defense against oxidative insult in bcl-2-overexpressing cells, we examined the effect of GSH on H2O2-induced cell death. GSH, a ubiquitous tripeptide thiol, is a vital intra- and extracellular antioxidant against oxidative stress. N-Acetyl-l-cysteine undergoes a rapid deacetylation in cells and provides a rate-limiting amino acid (cysteine) needed for the intracellular synthesis of GSH, thereby replenishing the depleted levels of GSH.

The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, including p27Kip1, play important roles in maintaining SMC quiescence. Levels of p27Kip1 are dependent on attachment to and the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Here we sought to elucidate mechanisms underlying the ECM-dependent regulation of p27Kip1 and hence, SMC proliferation. Serum stimulation decreased p27Kip1 levels in isolated SMC but not in rat aorta. The effect was post-translational and mediated by proteasomal degradation. We studied the S-phase-associated kinase protein-2 (Skp-2), an F-box protein involved in ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. Skp-2 protein is strongly induced by serum from undetectable levels in isolated SMCs but remains undetectable in aorta; Skp-2 mRNA is also lower in aorta. Overexpression of wild-type Skp-2 in SMCs decreased p27Kip1 levels, whereas dominant negative F-box deleted mutant (ΔF-Skp-2) Skp-2 increased p27Kip1 levels. Furthermore, hyperphosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein and SMC proliferation were also reciprocally affected by wild-type and dominant negative Skp-2. Skp-2 expression was absolutely dependent on cell attachment to the ECM and was inhibited by laminin and type-1 fibrillar collagen but increased by fibronectin. Expression of Skp-2 protein, but not mRNA, was associated with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity and inhibited by overexpression of FAK-related non-kinase and a dominant negative FAKY397F mutant. Furthermore, the inhibition of Skp-2 expression by dominant negative FAK was reversed by the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the vascular ECM controls SMC proliferation via FAK-dependent regulation of Skp-2 protein stability.

For example, healthy vessel SMCs exhibit extremely low rates of proliferation, even though endogenous growth factors are present (6Newby A. Zaltsman A. Cardiovas. Res. 1999; 41: 345-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Furthermore, exposure of arterial segments to exogenous growth factors in vitro (7Fingerle J. Kraft T. Int. Angiol. 1987; 6: 65-72PubMed Google Scholar) or in vivo does not lead to high rates of SMC proliferation (8Jawien A. Bowenpope D. Lindner V. Schwartz S. Clowes A.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 89: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 9Lindner V. Majack R. Reidy M. J. Clin. Investig. 1990; 85: 2004-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 10Soyombo A.

These observations imply that growth factors work in concert with additional factors to regulate SMC proliferation. The fact that SMCs are capable of rapidly proliferating in vitro when enzymatically digested free of their native extracellular matrix suggests that the nature of the local environment, and in particular the composition of the extracellular matrix, is an important factor determining SMC response to mitogens. Several vascular ECM components, including fibrillar type-1 collagen, fibronectin, and laminin, have been demonstrated to regulate SMC proliferation (5Kinsella M. Tran P. Weiser-Evans M.

Cytochem. 1997; 45: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying this regulation are unclear. The cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK2, CDK4) and their regulatory partners, the cyclins (cyclin E, cyclin D) control progression through the cell cycle (15Vermeulen K. Bockstaele D. Berneman Z. Cell Prolif. 2003; 2003: 131-149Crossref Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). The activity of the CDKs is further regulated by the CIP/Kip family and the INK family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) (16Sherr C. Roberts J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). A large body of research has documented the role played by the CDKIs, in particular p27Kip1, which can inhibit the activity of the CDK-cyclin E and CDK4-cyclin D complexes (17Sun J. Marx S.O.

Res. 1998; 82: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Typically, in response to mitogenic stimulation, the levels of p27Kip1 are reduced during G1, relieving inhibition of CDK activity and allowing retinoblastoma protein (Rb) hyperphosphorylation. The precise mechanisms that control CDKI levels during the SMC cell cycle remain unclear. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that the ECM regulates p27Kip1 levels in SMC and other cells (21Assoian R. Marcantonio E. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 2436-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Koyama H. Raines E.W. Bornfeldt K.E. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Cell. 1996; 87: 1069-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). First, fibroblasts forced into suspension fail to down-regulate p27Kip1 and arrest in G1 (2Carrano A. Pagano M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 24Fang F. Orend G. Watanabe N. Hunter T. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1996; 271: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Second, p27Kip1 levels are dependent on the type of ECM substratum (25Xaus J. Comalada M. Cardo M. Valledor A. Celada A. Blood. 2001; 98: 2124-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 26Danen E. Soneveld P. Sonnenberg A. Yamada K. J.

Last, SMCs in intact rat aorta and hence interacting with their native basement membrane ECM fail to degrade p27Kip1 in response to mitogen stimulation, whereas SMC digested free of their basement membranes and cultured are able to rapidly degrade p27Kip1 (28Izzard T. Taylor C. Birkett S. Jackson C. Newby A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 52: 242-252Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that the ECM controls SMC proliferation, at least in part by regulating the levels of p27Kip1. However, the mechanism underlying this regulation is unclear. This prompted us to investigate the mechanisms controlling the ECM-dependent degradation of p27Kip1 in vascular SMCs and in particular the role played by Skp-2. Here we have tested the hypothesis that the vascular ECM regulates the expression of Skp-2 and hence p27Kip1 degradation. Male Wistar rats were obtained from Charles River culture media, and additives were obtained from Invitrogen. Monoclonal antibody to Skp-2 was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Inc. (Cambridge, UK). Monoclonal antibody to p27Kip1 was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). pCDNA3.1 plasmids containing wild-type and dominant negative F-box-deleted Skp-2 were generously provided by Dr. M. Pagano (New York, NY). Recombinant adenovirus expressing FAK-related-non-kinase (FRNK) was provided by Prof. A. M Samarel (Loyola University, Chicago, IL) and cDNA encoding FAKY397F was kindly provided by Prof. J. T. Parsons (University of Virginia). SMC Culture and [3H]Thymidine Incorporation—Male Wistar rats (300–400 g) were anesthetized with sodium pentabarbitone followed by retrograde perfusion with phosphate-buffered saline via the abdominal aorta. The thoracic aorta was excised, cut into 4-mm sections, and cultured as described previously (28Izzard T. Taylor C. Birkett S. Jackson C. Newby A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 52: 242-252Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) in DMEM (100 units/ml streptomycin and 100 mg/ml penicillin) containing 10% FCS. Isolated SMCs were prepared using a modification of the explant technique described previously (29Southgate K.M. Newby A.C. Atherosclerosis. 1990; 82: 113-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Isolated SMCs were cultured in DMEM containing 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml streptomycin, 100 mg/ml penicillin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were passaged by trypsin/EDTA treatment and used between passages 2–6. Cells were rendered quiescent by serum deprivation for 72 h. Where indicated, tissue culture plates were coated with 20 μg/ml of Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm-derived laminin (Invitrogen) or 20 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature. Plates were blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min and washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline before cell seeding. Cells cultured on a laminin matrix were also cultured in the presence of 10 μm cyclic RGDFV peptide to block interaction with endogenously produced fibronectin as previously described (30Hedin U. Bottger B. Forsberg E. Johansson S. Thyberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Type-1 collagen gels were formed by neutralization of acidic monomeric collagen (Vitrogen) with 0.1 m NaOH. To quantify proliferation, cells were cultured in the presence of 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for 18 h. Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C for 30 min. Trichloroacetic acid precipitates were collected and analyzed for DNA [3H]thymidine incorporation and total DNA content as described previously (29Southgate K.M. Newby A.C. Atherosclerosis. 1990; 82: 113-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For suspension cultures, SMCs were cultured over 10% agarose at a density of 1 × 106cells/ml in DMEM (100 units/ml streptomycin and 100 mg/ml penicillin) containing 10% FCS. Adenovirus Infection of Rat Aorta—Sections of rat aorta (4 mm) were infected with 1 × 1010 plaque-forming units of recombinant adenovirus in DMEM containing 10% FCS for 4 h. Aortic sections were then cultured in DMEM/10% FCS containing 10 μm BrdUrd for 72 h. Immunohistochemical staining for Skp-2 expression and BrdUrd incorporation was performed on transverse sections (3 μm) of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections using specific antibodies for Skp-2 and BrdUrd. Specific staining was detected with ExtrAvidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and diaminobenzidine. Nuclear counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin. Western Blotting—Isolated rat SMCs were plated at a density of 4 × 104/cm2. Where indicated, cells were synchronized in G0 by serum deprivation for 72 h. Total cell lysates were prepared at the indicated times using SDS-lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 1% SDS). Lysates were analyzed for protein content (Micro BCA assay kit, Pierce), and equal amounts of reduced protein (50–100 μg) were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 0.25% Tween 20) containing 6% milk powder and incubated in primary antibody for 3 h at room temperature. Specific proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako, Ely, UK). Peroxidase activity was detected using enhanced chemoluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant Adenoviruses—Control adenovirus (Ad:control) was a gift from Dr. G. W. G. Wilkinson (University of Wales College of Medicine, Heath Park, Cardiff, UK). Coding sequences isolated from donated plasmids excised and ligated into the adenovirus shuttle vector pDC515 (Microbix Biosystems Inc.). Replication-deficient adenoviruses were generated by site-specific recombination of the co-transfected shuttle and genomic plasmids in HEK293 cells. Viral stocks were plaque-purified, amplified, CsCl-banded, and titrated as previously described (31Baker A. Wilkinson G.W.G. Hembry R. Murphy G. Newby A. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 383-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Rat SMCs were infected with adenovirus at 200 plaque-forming units/cell for 3 h. Total RNA was extracted from isolated SMCs and rat aortic segments using the Qiagen fibrous tissue RNA extract protocol. First-strand cDNA was synthesized by random priming using the ProStar first-strand synthesis kit (Stratagene). Semi-quantitative PCR was performed using primers for Skp-2 (forward, 5′-ACCAGCTTCACGTGGGGATGGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTCGACAGGTCCATGTGCTGTAC-3′); GAPDH, (forward 5′-GTATGACTCTACCCAGGCAAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTCTGAGTGGCAGTGATGGCAT-3′); p27Kip1 mRNA (forward primer, 5′-AAGCACTGCCGAGATATGGAAG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-ACTGTCCTGACGAGTCAGGCATT-3′); and p27Kip1 hnRNA (forward primer, 5′-AAGCACTGCCGAGATATGGAAG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-AGAGGAGCTACGGAGACAGACA-3′) for various numbers of cycles (typically 26, 28, 30 cycles) to ensure that reactions did not reach saturation. Products were separated on 1% agarose/Tris acetate EDTA gels and analyzed by densitometry using Bio-Rad Molecular Analyst software. Different Regulation of p27Kip1 in Intact Aorta and Isolated SMCs—The effect of mitogen stimulation (10% FCS) on p27Kip1 levels was analyzed in intact rat thoracic aortic segments in which SMC interact with their native basement membranes and vascular ECM and in cultured rat aortic SMCs that have been isolated from the native vascular ECM. In isolated SMCs, mitogen stimulation resulted in an early but partial reduction in p27Kip1 levels after 4 h (p = 0.0017, n = 6) (Fig. 1A) and a more dramatic reduction (to 17.1% ± 4.7% of control, p = 0.0001, n = 6) after 24 h (Fig. 1A). However, no reduction in p27Kip1 levels was observed in intact aortic segments in response to mitogen stimulation (Fig. 1A), in agreement with our previous observations (28Izzard T. Taylor C. Birkett S. Jackson C. Newby A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 52: 242-252Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The degradation of p27Kip1 in isolated SMCs after 24 h of stimulation was associated with hyperphosphorylation of Rb protein (Fig. 1A), a critical step in the transition through the G1 restriction. No Rb phosphorylation was detected in intact aorta (Fig. 1A). Although p27Kip1 levels remained higher in intact aorta compared with isolated SMCs, the expression of p27Kip1 mRNA was found to be equal in both unstimulated intact aorta and isolated cells (Fig. 1B). In addition, there was no difference in the rate of p27Kip1 transcription, measured by RT-PCR analysis of prespliced p27Kip1 hnRNA (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these data imply that the lower p27Kip1 protein levels in isolated SMCs late in G1 are mediated by post-transcriptional mechanisms. Previous work in other cells suggests that the late G1 decline in p27Kip1 may be mediated by enhanced 26 S proteasome-mediated degradation (32Carrano A. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 33Pagano M. Tam S. Theodoras A. Beerromero P. Delsal G. Chau V. Yew P. Draetta G. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). Indeed, treatment of isolated SMCs with the 26 S proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, prevented the mitogen-induced reduction in p27Kip1 (Fig. 1C). Relationship between p27Kip1 Expression and Skp-2 Expression—The above data demonstrating proteasome-mediated degradation of p27Kip1 prompted us to investigate the role of Skp-2, a component of the SCFSkp-2 ubiquitin-protein isopep-tide ligase that might mediate p27Kip1 degradation. Skp-2 protein was undetectable in un-stimulated isolated SMCs but was strongly induced after 16–24 h of stimulation with serum mitogens (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, the appearance of Skp-2 protein after 16–24 h of stimulation coincided with the late decrease in p27Kip1 levels (Fig. 2A) and the time when we previously demonstrated the cells are entering S-phase (28Izzard T. Taylor C. Birkett S. Jackson C. Newby A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 52: 242-252Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent staining revealed a predominantly nuclear localization of Skp-2 in serum-stimulated isolated SMC (Supplemental Fig. S1). Importantly, Skp-2 protein expression was undetected in either unstimulated or serum-stimulated intact aorta (Fig. 2B). Skp-2 mRNA expression was also found to be significantly lower in intact aorta (17.4 ± 4%, p = 0.0024, n = 3) compared with isolated SMCs (Fig. 2C). This implies, first, that the altered Skp-2 protein levels between isolated SMC and aortas result from differences in steady-state mRNA levels. Secondly, the failure to up-regulate Skp-2 in intact aorta could underlie the failure to down-regulate p27Kip1 protein levels. Modulation of Skp-2 Activity by Gene Transfer Affects p27Kip1 Degradation and Regulates SMC Proliferation—To investigate a causal role for Skp-2 in p27Kip1 degradation and SMC proliferation, we constructed adenovirus vectors capable of expressing wild-type Skp-2 (Ad:WT-Skp-2) and dominant negative F-box-deleted mutant (Ad: ΔF-Skp-2). Previous work showed that F-box-deleted Skp-2 retains the ability to interact with p27Kip1 but does not recruit it to the SKP1-CUL1 complex, thus preventing ubiquitination of the substrate protein (34Lisztwan J. Marti A. Sutterluty H. Gstaiger M. Wirbelauer C. Krek W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 368-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 35Sutterluty H. Chatelain E. Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Senften M. Muller U. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Infection with Ad:WT-Skp-2 or Ad: ΔF-Skp-2 resulted in elevated expression of 45-kDa wild-type Skp-2 or 35-kDa F-box-deleted Skp-2, respectively (Fig. 3A, a and b). These blots were underexposed so as to clearly visualize the exogenous proteins; hence, endogenous levels of Skp-2 were undetectable. Immunofluorescent staining revealed that exogenously expressed Skp-2 was localized both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Supplemental Fig. S1). Infection with Ad:WT-Skp-2 resulted in a significant decrease (to 30.8 ± 10% of control; p = 0.0204, n = 3) in p27Kip1 levels compared with Ad:control-infected cells, indicating that exogenous Skp-2 promotes p27Kip1 degradation in vascular SMC (Fig. 3A, c). These Western blots are overexposed to detect low levels of p27Kip1 in control cells. Importantly, infection with Ad:ΔF-Skp-2 resulted in a significant increase (to 156 ± 13.5% of control; p = 0.0253, n = 3) in p27Kip1 levels (Fig. 3A, d), further supporting a role for endogenous Skp-2 in p27Kip1 degradation. Elevated expression of Skp-2-mediated by Ad:WT-Skp-2 infection increased hyperphosphorylation of Rb, (Fig. 3A, e), and expression of ΔF-Skp-2 inhibited phosphorylation of Rb (Fig. 3A, f). Concurrent with these changes in Rb phosphorylation status, we found that forced expression of WT-Skp-2 significantly enhanced [3H]thymidine incorporation (240.7 ± 17% of controls, p = 0.0143, n = 3), indicative of increased S-phase entry. Expression of ΔF-Skp-2 resulted in a significant decrease (to 69.9 ± 6.2%, p = 0.0401, n = 3) in [3H]thymidine incorporation. Taken together, these results show that Skp-2 is a key factor regulating p27Kip1 levels in SMC and that this promotes Rb hyperphosphorylation and cell proliferation. To determine whether the lack of Skp-2 expression in rat aorta is an important factor in limiting SMC proliferation, segments were infected in in vitro organ culture with 1 × 1010 plaque-forming units of either Ad:WT-Skp-2 or Ad:control. Three days postinfection Ad:WT-Skp-2, but not Ad:control, strongly up-regulated Skp-2 by Western blotting (Fig. 3B, inset); immunohistochemistry showed detectable Skp-2 in medial SMCs compared with none after control infection (Supplemental Fig. S2). Infection with Ad:WT-Skp-2 significantly increased SMC proliferation (9.64 ± 1.96% BrdUrd-positive cells for Ad:WT-Skp-2 compared with 1.24 ± 0.46% for Ad:control, n = 6, p = <0.0162) (Fig. 3B). Hence, adenovirus-mediated expression of wild-type Skp-2 rescued the ability of SMCs in intact aorta to proliferate in response to serum. Skp-2 Expression Depends on the ECM—The difference in Skp-2 expression between SMCs in intact aorta and isolated SMC led us to investigate whether Skp-2 expression depends on the nature of the ECM. First, to determine whether the expression of Skp-2 depends on attachment to the ECM, isolated SMCs were synchronized in G0/G1 by serum deprivation for 72 h, trypsinized, and replated either in suspension (over 10% agarose at high density to maintain cell:cell contacts) or adherent (on plastic) in the presence of 10% FCS. After 18 h of stimulation with serum mitogens, expression of Skp-2 protein was induced in the adherent cells but not in cells cultured in suspension (Fig. 4A). Expression of Skp-2 protein in suspension cultures was reduced by 98.1 ± 1.91% (p = 0.0004, n = 3) compared with adherent cultures, whereas cell viability in suspension cultures, measured by trypan blue exclusion, was only reduced by 14 ± 3.7%. This relatively small reduction in viability is therefore unlikely to account for the large reduction in Skp-2 expression observed in suspension cultures, indicating a requirement for adhesion-dependent signaling for Skp-2 expression. To further test whether the nature of the ECM plays an important role in regulating Skp-2 expression, we cultured isolated SMCs on a fibrillar collagen matrix, which has previously been demonstrated to inhibit SMC proliferation by increasing p27Kip1 levels (22Koyama H. Raines E.W. Bornfeldt K.E. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Cell. 1996; 87: 1069-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). SMCs synchronized in G0/G1 were plated either onto plastic or type-1 fibrillar collagen-coated plates in the presence of 10% FCS. Expression of Skp-2 protein 24 h later was found to be significantly lower (43.9 ± 4.3%, p = 0.0002, n = 5) in cells cultured on a fibrillar type-1 collagen matrix compared with cells cultured on plastic, implying that the composition of the ECM is important in regulating Skp-2 expression (Fig. 4B). Similarly, Skp-2 steady-state mRNA expression was significantly lower (57.9 ± 14.5%, p = 0.0335, n = 6) when cells were cultured on a collagen matrix (Fig. 4B). To further investigate the importance of ECM composition we compared the relative effects of fibronectin and laminin on Skp-2 expression. Laminin, a component of SMC basement membranes, has been implicated in promoting SMC differentiation into a non-proliferative phenotype, whereas fibronectin promotes SMC differentiation and proliferation (30Hedin U. Bottger B. Forsberg E. Johansson S. Thyberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). SMCs plated on laminin in the presence of 10% FCS expressed significantly less Skp-2 protein (45.3 ± 15.2% compared with fibronectin, p = 0.0361, n = 4) and steady-state mRNA (17.4 ± 4.9% compared with fibronectin, p = 0.0001, n = 6) than cells cultured on fibronectin, again demonstrating that ECM composition regulates Skp-2 expression (Fig. 4C). Skp-2 Expression Is Dependent on Focal Adhesion Kinase— Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is an important mediator of ECM-dependent signals in numerous adhesion-dependent cell types, including vascular SMCs. To investigate the role played by FAK in the ECM-dependent regulation of Skp-2, we measured FAK activity (measured by phosphorylation of Tyr-397) in intact rat aorta and isolated rat SMC in culture. Phosphorylation of FAK Tyr-397 was found to be significantly lower in intact aorta compared with SMC cultured on plastic (Fig. 5, A and B). However, FAK Tyr-397 phosphorylation was not affected by serum stimulation in aorta or culture cells (Fig. 5, A and B), implying ECM-dependent but not mitogen-dependent regulation. Total levels of FAK protein were equal in both aorta and cells (Fig. 5B). We employed two approaches to test whether Skp-2 expression depends on FAK signaling. First, we used an adenovirus vector (Ad:FRNK) to overexpress FRNK, an endogenous protein homologous to the C-terminal domain of FAK that acts as an inhibitor of FAK activity (36Richardson A. Parsons J. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Infection with Ad:FRNK elevated levels of FRNK and inhibited global phosphorylation of FAK without affecting total FAK protein expression (Fig. 6A). Infection with Ad:FRNK but not Ad:control also resulted in a significant inhibition (to 53.1 ± 10.7%, p <0.05, n = 4) of Skp-2 expression (Fig. 6A). Second, we used a FAK mutant (Ad:FAKY397F) in which the tyrosine 397 autophosphorylation site that triggers FAK activation is mutated to a phenylala-nine. Infection of cultured SMC with Ad:FAKY397F, but not Ad:control, elevated FAKY397F expression levels and inhibited wild-type FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-397 (Fig. 6B). Infection with Ad:FAKY397F, but not Ad:control, also resulted in a significant inhibition (to 15.1 ± 2.1%, p <0.05, n = 3) of Skp-2 protein expression (compare with Ad:control-infected cells) (Fig. 6B). Neither Ad:FRNK nor Ad:FAK397 infection affected Skp-2 mRNA expression (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 for 6 h blocked the down-regulation of Skp-2 induced by Ad:FAK397 (Fig. 6D). In this study, we sought further information regarding the mechanisms by which the ECM controls SMC proliferation in response to mitogens and, hence, the basis of SMC quiescence in intact aortas. Our data confirmed that SMC in intact rat aortas fails to down-regulate p27Kip1 or proliferate in response to serum. More importantly, our data show for the first time that late G1 levels of p27Kip1 are down-regulated in isolated SMC, but not aortas, by proteasomal degradation mediated by the Skp-2 ubiquitin-protein ligase subunit. First, we show that Skp-2 protein is undetectable after serum stimulation of aortas but up-regulated in isolated cultured SMC. Second, adenovirus-mediated expression of wild-type Skp-2 or a dominant negative form decrease or increase, respectively, p27Kip1 levels. Third, wild-type Skp-2 promotes and dominant negative Skp-2 inhibits SMC proliferation. Finally, we present new data that Skp-2 expression is adhesion-dependent in SMC and negatively regulated by the ECM components collagen and laminin, which do not support proliferation, but up-regulated by fibronectin, which does. This ECM-dependent regulation of Skp-2 is mediated, at least in part, by signaling through focal adhesion kinase. Our results imply that Skp-2 plays a significant role in the regulation of SMC proliferation by the ECM and that this, at least in part, explains why SMC in intact aortas are maintained quiescent. It has been appreciated for many years that the rates of SMC proliferation in intact arteries are very low. Although this may partly reflect low free concentrations of mitogens, it is clear that uninjured SMCs, unlike fibroblasts, remain quiescent even when exposed to mitogens in organ culture or in vivo. Nevertheless, the potential of SMC to proliferate rapidly can be unlocked by digesting arterial tissue with collagenase, which frees SMC from contacts with their normal basement membranes and allows new contacts with existing and nascent interstitial matrix components. Fibroblasts by contrast do not express basement membranes. It has been postulated therefore that the ECM is an important regulator of SMC proliferation. Moreover, components of the native ECM (e.g. polymerized collagen, laminin) have negative growth regulatory properties, whereas those up-regulated in remodeling ECM (e.g. monomeric collagen, fibronectin) have positive effects (22Koyama H. Raines E.W. Bornfeldt K.E. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Cell. 1996; 87: 1069-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 30Hedin U. Bottger B. Forsberg E. Johansson S. Thyberg J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1977-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The data are consistent with the concept that vascular ECM in intact aortas either inhibits or is not permissive to proliferation. Koyama et al. (22Koyama H. Raines E.W. Bornfeldt K.E. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Cell. 1996; 87: 1069-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) observed that the suppression of SMC proliferation by a type-1 fibrillar collagen is mediated, at least in part, by an increase in the level of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. We also found previously that low rates of SMC proliferation in intact rat aorta are associated with constitutively elevated levels of p27Kip1 (28Izzard T. Taylor C. Birkett S. Jackson C. Newby A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 52: 242-252Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast, isolated cultured SMC acquired the ability to down-regulate p27Kip1 and proliferate in response to mitogen stimulation. The importance of p27Kip1 as a regulator of SMC proliferation in vivo is clear from studies of balloon injury to porcine femoral arteries, which induced SMC proliferation, coincident with an early reduction of p27/Kip levels (20Tanner F. Yang Z. Duckers E. Gordon D. Nabel G. Nabel E.G. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The later injury-induced overexpression of p27Kip1 occurred coordinately with a reduction in proliferation and a return to quiescence (20Tanner F. Yang Z. Duckers E. Gordon D. Nabel G. Nabel E.G. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Furthermore, gene transfer of p27Kip1 to porcine femoral arteries significantly reduced SMC proliferation and neo-intima size after balloon injury (19Tanner F. Boehm M. Levent Akyurek M. San H. Yang Z. Tashiro J. Nabel G. Nabel E.G. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2022-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data show that p27Kip1 is an important regulator of SMC proliferation and suggest that the vascular ECM regulates SMC proliferation at least in part by controlling the levels of p27Kip1. However, it is not clear how signals from the ECM control the levels of p27Kip1 in SMCs. Recent research on other cell types (32Carrano A. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 35Sutterluty H. Chatelain E. Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Senften M. Muller U. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) led us to consider a role for the F-box protein Skp-2 in the regulated ubiquitination of p27Kip1 and cellular proliferation. Skp-2, originally identified as a protein interacting with cyclin A and CDK2 is expressed at high levels in numerous tumors and is often associated with advanced clinical stages (38Troncone G. Iaccarino A. Caleo A. Bifano D. Pettinato G. Palombini L. J. Clin. Pathol. 2003; 56: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 39Seki R. Okamura T. Koga H. Yakushiji K. Hashiguchi M.

Levels of Skp-2 in these tumors are often inversely related to the levels of p27Kip1 (38Troncone G. Iaccarino A. Caleo A. Bifano D. Pettinato G. Palombini L. J. Clin. Pathol. 2003; 56: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 39Seki R. Okamura T. Koga H. Yakushiji K. Hashiguchi M. Yoshimoto K. Ogata H. Imamura R. Nakashima Y. Kage M. Ueno T. Sata M. Am.

Ciechanover A. J. Urol. 2003; 170: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Our results show a similar relationship in SMCs where expression of Skp-2 during the G1 phase of the cell cycle is inversely related to the level of p27Kip1 expression. Moreover up-regulation of Skp-2 parallels the ability of SMC in aortas or in isolated cell culture to degrade p27Kip1 in response to mitogen stimulation. Importantly, exogenous expression of Skp-2 in aortas rescues the ability of SMCs to proliferate in response to growth factors, implying that low levels of endogenous Skp-2 expression in intact arteries are an important factor limiting proliferation and maintaining SMC quiescence. SMC in intact aorta fail to up-regulate Skp-2 in response to mitogens despite, as we have previously demonstrated, equal mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and cyclin D and cyclin E up-regulation compared with isolated SMC (28Izzard T. Taylor C. Birkett S. Jackson C. Newby A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 52: 242-252Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One explanation could be that signals from the vascular ECM regulate Skp-2 expression coordinately with signals from growth factors. The requirement for ECM signals is clearly demonstrated by the complete loss of Skp-2 expression in SMC forced into suspension. Similar adhesion-dependent regulation of Skp-2 was recently demonstrated in lung fibroblasts (2Carrano A. Pagano M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), implying that at least this aspect of matrix regulation is common to both cell types. We went on to show up-regulation of Skp-2 expression by fibronectin, a component of the vascular inter-stitial matrix that is up-regulated during matrix remodeling after injury (14Thyberg J. Blomgren K. Roy J. Tran P.K. Hedin U. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), but not fibrillar type-1 collagen. SMC cultured on a laminin matrix, albeit a mixture of laminin-1 isoforms that may not completely mirror those present in SMC basement membrane, also show reduced Skp-2 expression. These data imply that regulation of Skp-2 expression by the ECM is likely to be an important mechanism maintaining SMC quiescence in healthy vessels and initiating SMC proliferation during vascular diseases, where extensive remodeling of the ECM is known to occur. Focal adhesion kinase plays an important role in regulating cellular proliferation by integrating signals from growth factor receptors and the ECM in numerous adhesion-dependent cell types. Concurrent with this, phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-397, an auto-phosphorylation event responsible for the activation of FAK, is significantly lower in rat aorta compared with isolated SMCs in culture and correlates with the ability of SMCs to express Skp-2 and proliferate. Phosphorylation at this residue creates binding sites for other SH2 domain-containing kinases that trigger further phosphorylation events within the FAK C-terminal domain. The potent inhibition of Skp-2 protein, but not mRNA expression in SMCs overexpressing FAK mutated at Tyr-397 or FRNK, clearly demonstrates the importance of FAK activity for Skp-2 protein expression and implies regulation at a post-transcriptional level. The ability of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 to block the down-regulation of Skp-2 protein induced by FAK397 demonstrates that FAK signals regulate Skp-2 at the level of Skp-2 protein stability. Taken together, our data demonstrate that FAK activity is essential for the stability of Skp-2 protein and, hence, progression through G1-S phases of the cell cycle. A number of studies have demonstrated that general proteasome inhibitors have potent antiproliferative effects, largely in the cancer field (42Adams J. Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents. 2003; 13: 45-57Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The proteasome inhibitor MG-132 has also been shown to effectively inhibit restenosis in the rat carotid balloon injury model (23Meiners S. Laule M. Rother W. Guenther C. Prauka I. Muschick P. Baumann G. Kloetzel P. Stangl K. Circulation. 2002; 104: 483-489Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As these general proteasome inhibitors block degradation of all ubiquitinated proteins, they often have multiple effects on the cell, including induction of apoptosis and inhibition of inflammatory pathways, such as NFκB activation. Our data demonstrating the important role of Skp-2 in controlling SMC proliferation suggest that agents targeting Skp-2 function could prove more selective antiproliferative therapies for the treatment of restenosis and late vein graft failure.

https://openalex.org/W2103874288,"We previously reported that a small peptide based on amino acids 143–153 of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-binding domain of JIP-1 functioned as an in vitro inhibitor of JNK activity. This peptide (TI-JIP: RP-KRPTTLNLF) resembles the kinase-interaction motif (KIM = (K/R)2–3X1–6(L/I)X(L/I)), which is common to upstream activators, downstream substrates, phosphatases, and scaffold proteins present in MAPK cascades. In this study, we characterized the mechanism of JNK inhibition by this peptide and further investigated the biochemical features of this peptide resulting in potent JNK inhibition. We also tested various KIM-based peptides for their ability to inhibit JNK activity. TI-JIP was found to be competitive with respect to the phosphoacceptor substrate c-Jun (KI = 0.39 ± 0.08 μm), and exhibit mixed (non-competitive) inhibition with respect to ATP. All seven substitutions of Pro-5 we tested significantly reduced the JNK inhibition, as did altering the Pro-5 to Leu-8 spacing. When we independently tested eight substitutions of either Thr-6 or Thr-7, only one substitution in each position was well tolerated. Furthermore, peptides based on the KIMs from other proteins were significantly less potent JNK inhibitors than TI-JIP, including a peptide from the JNK interactor Sab that contained all critical inhibitory residues present in TI-JIP. Therefore, despite having previously identified Arg-4, Pro-5, Leu-8, and Leu-10 in TI-JIP as independently critical for mediating JNK inhibition, we find their presence in other 11-mer peptides is not sufficient for JNK inhibition. TI-JIP is therefore a unique KIM-based inhibitor of JNK activity.

In mammals, these Ser/Thr protein kinases are activated by various stimuli including growth factors, cytokines, and cellular stresses (1Minden A. Lin A. Smeal T. Derijard B. Cobb M. Davis R. Karin M.

JNK activation requires the phosphorylation of Thr-183 and Tyr-185 in its activation loop by the upstream kinases MKK4/SEK1/JNKK1 and MKK7/SEK2/JNKK2 (6Lawler S. Fleming Y. Goedert M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1387-1390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following their activation, JNKs phosphorylate nuclear substrates including c-Jun, ATF-2, and Elk-1, and non-nuclear substrates such as Bcl-2 family members. This allows JNK to contribute to diverse biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and death (7Barr R.K. Bogoyevitch M.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 1047-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Selective JNK or JNK pathway inhibitors have been developed following the implication of JNK signaling in various disease states. CEP-1347 is an orally active inhibitor of the mixed lineage kinases (MLKs) that function upstream in the JNK pathway (8Saporito M.S. Hudkins R.L. Maroney A.C. Prog. Med. Chem. 2002; 40: 23-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It has been used to inhibit JNK activation both in vitro and in vivo (9Pirvola U. Xing-Qun L. Virkkala J. Saarma M. Murakata C.

SP600125 was reported to be a reversible ATP-competitive JNK inhibitor with greater than 20-fold selectivity for JNK versus a range of kinases and enzymes tested (13Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.H. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2243) Google Scholar). However, Bain et al. (14Bain J. McLauchlan H. Elliot M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar) recently reported that SP600125 was a relatively weak inhibitor of JNK isoforms, inhibiting JNK1α1 and JNK2α2 with IC50 values of 5.8 and 6.1 μm, respectively. Moreover, 13 other protein kinases in the panel were inhibited with similar or greater potency by SP600125 (14Bain J. McLauchlan H. Elliot M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). Given the limited availability of CEP-1347, and the relatively poor specificity of SP600125, there is a need for the development of potent, selective JNK inhibitors to investigate the intracellular actions of JNK. Numerous groups have identified a conserved kinase-interaction motif (KIM) in the primary sequences of MAPK-interacting molecules, whether they be from the JNK, p38, or ERK MAPK pathways (15Gavin A.C. Nebreda A.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 16Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The consensus KIM sequence is (K/R)2–3X1–6(L/I)X(L/I) and therefore consists of a cluster of basic amino acids followed by hydrophobic amino acids. Both the basic and hydrophobic residues are important for the MAPK docking interaction, and the KIM has been demonstrated to be both necessary and sufficient for binding to MAPKs (19Tanoue T. Nishida E. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the interaction between JNKs and the KIM of the JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP-1) scaffold protein. We demonstrated that an 11-mer peptide, TI-JIP, corresponding to residues 153–163 of murine JIP-1 potently inhibited JNK activity in vitro (20Barr R.K. Kendrick T.S. Bogoyevitch M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10987-10997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In addition, cell-permeable peptides based on the KIM of JIP-1 effectively inhibit JNK activity in vivo. For example, Bonny et al. (21Bonny C. Oberson A. Negri S. Sauser C. Schorderet D.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) engineered bioactive cell-permeable peptide inhibitors of JNK by linking 20-amino acid inhibitory domains of the JIP-1/IB1 proteins to the 10-amino acid HIV-TAT cell-permeable sequence. The peptides were found to protect pancreatic βTC-3 cells against apoptosis induced by IL-1β. In addition, equivalent D retro-inverso peptides penetrated cells as efficiently as the l-enantiomers, decreased c-Jun phosphorylation by JNK, and remained stable inside cells. These D retro-inverso peptides conferred full protection against apoptosis during 2 weeks of continual treatment with IL-1β (21Bonny C. Oberson A. Negri S. Sauser C. Schorderet D.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The success of these inhibitors is further highlighted by the use of the cell-permeable, protease-resistant, IB1/JIP-1-based peptide inhibitor to protect against excitotoxicity and cerebral ischemia in vivo (22Borsello T. Clarke P.G. Hirt L. Vercelli A. Repici M. Schorderet D.F. Bogousslavsky J. Bonny C. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1180-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) and the use of this peptide to protect against both aminoglycoside and acoustic trauma-induced auditory hair cell death and hearing loss (23Wang J. Van De Water T.R. Bonny C. de Ribaupierre F. Puel J.L. Zine A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8596-8607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This peptide has high specificity for inhibiting JNK because 10 μm peptide did not inhibit the activity of 40 different kinases tested, and when 500 μm peptide was tested, it reduced substrate phosphorylation by six different kinases by no more than 1% (22Borsello T. Clarke P.G. Hirt L. Vercelli A. Repici M. Schorderet D.F. Bogousslavsky J. Bonny C. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1180-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Although the IB1/JIP-1-based peptide inhibitors have proved successful in a number of instances, their mode of JNK inhibition remains undefined. Therefore, we used kinetic assays to characterize the mechanism of JNK inhibition by TI-JIP, and we used a series of substituted TI-JIP peptides to clarify the biochemical features mediating its potent JNK inhibition. We show that the TI-JIP peptide is competitive with respect to the protein substrate c-Jun, and non-competitive with respect to ATP. In addition, Pro-5 could not be replaced by 7 tested substitutions, and the Pro-5 to Leu-8 spacing was critical for potent JNK inhibition. Thr-6 and Thr-7 demonstrated a limited tolerance for change. In addition, the presence of all critical inhibitory residues in a peptide based on the KIM of Sab (24Wiltshire C. Matsushita M. Tsukada S. Gillespie D.A. May G.H. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was not sufficient for potent JNK inhibition. Taken together, these results suggest that TI-JIP is a KIM that is a unique and potent inhibitor of JNK activity. Cell Transfection and in Vitro JNK Activity Assays—Procedures for cell transfection and in vitro JNK activity assays have previously been described in detail (20Barr R.K. Kendrick T.S. Bogoyevitch M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10987-10997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS cells were transfected with pCMV-FLAG-JNK1 and then hyperosmotically shocked by incubation in 0.5 m sorbitol for 30 min. Following cell lysis, activated FLAG-JNK1 was immunoprecipitated and pretreated with inhibitor peptides for 10 min at 30 °C. JNK activity toward a GST-c-Jun-(1–135) substrate was then assayed in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. The phosphorylated substrate was separated by SDS-PAGE, visualized by autoradiography, and quantitated by Cerenkov counting. For all assays, incubations in the absence of inhibitor peptides and incubations with the TI-JIP peptide were routinely performed as controls. Data from each experiment were expressed relative to the uninhibited control. In some figures, images have been spliced to simplify viewing, but all lanes come from a single experiment. Kinetic Assays—Assays to determine the kinetics of JNK inhibition by TI-JIP were carried out in 30-μl volumes containing the final concentrations of the following: 20 mm HEPES pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 500 μm dithiothreitol, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 2.9 nm active JNK1α1 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), and 0.7–31.5 μm GST-c-Jun-(1–135). The reactions were pretreated with TI-JIP inhibitor (0–4 μm, as indicated) in the absence of ATP for 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were initiated with the addition of 2 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and 0.5–100 μm ATP (final concentration) and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. Where the concentration of GST-c-Jun-(1–135) was varied, the ATP concentration was held constant at 50 μm. Where the ATP concentration was varied, the GST-c-Jun-(1–135) concentration was held constant at 8 μm. Under these conditions, less than 10% of substrate was converted to product. Reactions were stopped with 15 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer, and then the phosphorylated product was separated by SDS-PAGE and quantitated by Cerenkov counting. Peptide Synthesis—All peptides were commercially synthesized by Mimotopes, with a free amine at the N terminus and an amide group at the C terminus. The TI-JIP peptide used for determination of kinetic parameters was synthesized individually, whereas other peptides were synthesized as a “PEPSET” using multipin technology, which allowed parallel synthesis of multiple peptides with replacement of amino acids within each peptide sequence to assess the JNK inhibition afforded by variant TI-JIP peptides and other KIM-based peptides. Peptides were prepared in Me2SO and solubilized by brief sonication, then incubation at 37 °C for 30–60 min. All peptides remained soluble under the assay conditions.

These bait sequences were expressed as fusions with the 202-residue LexA protein, which acts as a DNA-binding domain in the two-hybrid system. The pGILDA plasmid carries the HIS3 selectable marker gene. TI-JIP variants (P5A, L8A) were made by performing site-directed mutagenesis of the pGILDA-TI-JIP construct according to the Stratagene QuikChange protocol. Similarly, the TI-JIP sequence was altered to become the first KIM sequence from the Sab protein by performing three successive rounds of site-directed mutagenesis on the pGILDA-TI-JIP plasmid. A second yeast expression plasmid, pJG4–5/pB42AD (Clontech), was modified to contain the coding sequence of human JNK1 (25Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar). The JNK1 prey protein was expressed as a fusion with the B42 domain, which acts as a transcriptional activation domain in the two-hybrid system. The pJG4–5 plasmid carries the TRP1 selectable marker gene. All hybrid proteins were expressed in yeast cells under the control of the tightly regulated GAL1 promoter, and transcription was repressed in the presence of glucose, but induced in the presence of galactose. For two-hybrid screening, the yeast strain RFY 206 (MATa, trp1, ura3–52, his3–200, leu2–3, lys2-Δ201, trp1::hisG) was transformed with the pSH18–34 lacZ reporter plasmid, which contains the URA3 selectable marker gene. These yeast were then further transformed with pGILDA-TI-JIP or related bait constructs. These transformants were then mated overnight on YPD pH 6.0 agar to the yeast strain PRT 49 (PRT 49 is a derivative of the SKY 48 strain (MATa, trp1, ura3, his3, 6-lexAop-LEU2, 3-cIop-LYS2, ade2)), which had been transformed with pJG4–5-JNK. Diploids were selected using synthetic complete medium lacking uracil, histidine, and tryptophan (UHW–). β-Galactosidase Overlay Assays—For qualitative analysis of β-galactosidase activity, RFY 206/PRT 49 diploids transformed with pSH18–34, pGILDA-TI-JIP (or variants), and pJG4–5-JNK were replica plated onto UHW– agar (or where LEU2 reporter activity was monitored, this medium also lacked leucine (UHWL–)) containing either 2% glucose or 2% raffinose/0.05% galactose. Following incubation at 30 °C for 48 h, protein-protein interactions were assessed using the chloroform overlay assay technique (adopted from Ref. 26Duttweiler H.M. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 340-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Yeast grown on agar plates were overlaid with chloroform and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Plates were then rinsed with chloroform, dried upside down for 5 min, then overlaid with a solution of 1% low melting agarose in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing X-gal at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Once the agarose solidified, plates were incubated at 30 °C and monitored for 20 min to 3 h for color changes. Protein-protein interactions were monitored via lacZ reporter activity converting the colorless X-gal substrate to a colored product. Liquid β-Galactosidase Assays—The protocol for liquid β-galactosidase assays was modified from Ref. 27Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar. For quantitative analysis, RFY 206/PRT 49 diploids transformed with pSH18-34, pGILDA-TI-JIP (or variants), and pJG4–5-JNK were incubated at 30 °C at 300 rpm for 48 h in UHW– selective medium containing 2% raffinose/0.05% galactose. A control sample with repressed bait and prey expression was grown in UHW– medium containing 2% glucose, to use as a blank for OD420 nm measurements in the β-galactosidase assay. From each culture, 1.4 ml of suspension were centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 30 s to pellet the yeast. Yeast pellets were resuspended in 0.8 ml of Z-buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm Mg2SO4, pH 7.0) containing 0.27% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. Following addition of 50 μl of CHCl3 and 50 μl of 0.1% SDS, samples were vortexed for 30 s. o-Nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG, 160 μl of a 4 mg/ml solution in H2O, prepared fresh on the day) was added to each sample and following thorough mixing, samples were incubated at 30 °C for 35 min. At this time a yellow color was apparent, and reactions were quenched by addition of 0.4 ml of 1 m Na2CO3 with thorough vortexing. Samples were centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 10 min, then supernatants were removed, and their absorbance at 420 nm was measured. β-Galactosidase activity was calculated using Equation 1,Activity(Miller Units)=1000×((OD420nm)/(T×V×OD600nm)) (Eq. 1) where V = volume of yeast added, and T = time incubated at 30 °C. Data Analysis—StatView 3.0 was used to perform one way analysis of variance, and levels of inhibition that were found to be significantly different from the TI-JIP inhibition are denoted in the figures by asterisks (**, p < 0.01; *, p < 0.05). Analysis of kinetic data for the inhibition of GST-c-Jun-(1–135) phosphorylation was performed by fitting Equations 2 and 3 to the data, using the non-linear least squares regression analysis facility of the Scientist™ program,competitive inhibition: v=V[S]/([S]+Km(1+[TI-JIP]/KI)) (Eq. 2) mixed inhibition: v=V[S]/([S](1+[TI-JIP]/KIS)+Km(1+[TI-JIP]/KI))(Eq. 3) where V is the maximum velocity, [S] is the concentration of the varied substrate (either ATP or GST-c-Jun-(1–135)), Km is the apparent Km of the varied substrate, KI is the dissociation constant for the JNK-TI-JIP complex and KIS is the dissociation constant for the JNK-S-TI-JIP complex. From these fits, estimates of KI and KIS and standard deviations of these estimates were obtained. JNK Inhibition by TI-JIP Is Competitive with Respect to the Protein Substrate, and Non-competitive with Respect to ATP—We performed kinetic assays using activated JNK1α1 where either GST-c-Jun-(1–135) or ATP concentrations were varied at a fixed concentration of the other substrate in the presence or absence of TI-JIP. Data obtained from experiments performed at fixed ATP concentration, where GST-c-Jun-(1–135) concentrations were varied in the presence of increasing concentrations of TI-JIP, were indicative of competitive inhibition (Fig. 1A). A fit of Equation 2 to the data gave a value of KI of 0.39 ± 0.08 μm. When a fit of Equation 3 was attempted, the estimate of KIS obtained was many orders of magnitude greater than KI, which indicates that the affinity of TI-JIP for the JNK-GST-c-Jun-(1–135) complex is negligible. Similar experiments were performed with constant GST-c-Jun-(1–135) concentration and varied ATP concentrations, at several concentrations of TI-JIP (Fig. 1B). When Equation 3 was fitted to the data from these experiments, the estimates of KI and KIS obtained were 1.7 ± 0.7 and 1.8 ± 0.2 μm, respectively, which indicates that TI-JIP has similar affinity for both JNK and JNK-ATP. Therefore, it appears that TI-JIP competes with phosphoacceptor substrate for binding to JNK, and that the interaction between TI-JIP and JNK occurs independently of binding between ATP and JNK. Investigating the Importance of Pro-5 and the Pro-5 to Leu-8 Spacing within TI-JIP for JNK Inhibition—In our previous alanine-scanning replacement of the TI-JIP sequence, we identified Arg-4, Pro-5, Leu-8, and Leu-10 as independently critical for mediating JNK inhibition (20Barr R.K. Kendrick T.S. Bogoyevitch M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10987-10997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Arg-4, Leu-8, and Leu-10 reside within the highly conserved basic and hydrophobic regions of the KIM that are important for docking to MAPKs, so their replacement with alanine most likely disrupts the interaction between TI-JIP and JNK. However, we found that Pro-5 was also critical for mediating the inhibition by TI-JIP, although it is not a conserved feature of the reported KIMs. Therefore, we investigated the tolerance for change at this position within the 11-amino acid peptide, to assess the importance of Pro-5 for JNK inhibition by TI-JIP. Using JNK activity assays, we assessed the inhibition by a series of TI-JIP Pro-5 variants, with either hydrophobic (small/bulky) or basic substitutions at this position. We found that these seven substitutions at position 5 resulted in peptides that produced significantly less JNK inhibition than TI-JIP (Fig. 2A). Therefore, despite its lack of conservation within the KIM consensus sequence, Pro-5 appeared critical for the inhibition of JNK by TI-JIP. Within the KIM consensus sequence, there is also variability in the spacing between the conserved basic N-terminal residue and the first conserved hydrophobic C-terminal residue. This prompted an investigation into whether the spacing between these residues affected the ability of TI-JIP-based peptides to inhibit JNK activity. Given the critical nature of Pro-5 for JNK inhibition, we varied the Pro-5 to Leu-8 spacing, rather than the Arg-4 to Leu-8 spacing. Using JNK activity assays, we tested a series of TI-JIP-based peptides with 0–4 residues separating Pro-5 and Leu-8. Like the Pro-5 variant peptides, these peptides resulted in significantly less JNK inhibition than the TI-JIP peptide (Fig. 2B). Therefore, we concluded that in addition to the presence of Pro-5, the spacing between Pro-5 and Leu-8 was an essential feature allowing potent inhibition of JNK by TI-JIP. Investigating the Tolerance for Change at Thr-6 and Thr-7—We had previously shown that in contrast to alanine replacement of Pro-5, substitution of either Thr-6 or Thr-7 with alanine did not significantly reduce the potency of the TI-JIP peptide (20Barr R.K. Kendrick T.S. Bogoyevitch M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10987-10997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the tolerance for change in these residues in an attempt to better understand the requirements for JNK binding. Using JNK activity assays, we tested the inhibition produced by TI-JIP variant peptides where either Thr-6 or Thr-7 was replaced by acidic, basic or hydrophobic amino acids. We also investigated the effect of substituting Pro at this position, which would be expected to alter the conformation of the amino acid backbone, or phospho-Thr, because the basic amino acids situated N-terminal to these threonine residues suggests that they might represent a phosphorylation site (28Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For both Thr-6 and Thr-7 variants, a Thr to Pro substitution virtually abolished the JNK inhibition relative to wild-type TI-JIP (Fig. 3, A and B). Most of the other substitutions of Thr-6 resulted in significantly less JNK inhibition than TI-JIP, with the exception of a Thr-6 to Lys substitution (Fig. 3A). Most substitutions of Thr-7 also resulted in peptides with significantly less JNK inhibitory activity, and like the Thr-7 to Pro substitution, a Thr-7 to Tyr substitution abolished the JNK inhibition (Fig. 3B). The only substitution at position 7 that did not significantly decrease the JNK inhibition was Thr-7 to Phe (Fig. 3B). Therefore, changes to both Thr-6 and Thr-7 were sufficient to significantly reduce JNK inhibition by the peptides and hence these residues contribute to the potent inhibition of JNK by TI-JIP. Assessing JNK Inhibition by other KIM-based Peptides—As mentioned previously, the KIM consensus sequence is present in MAPK interactors including upstream activators, substrates, phosphatases, and scaffolds (as reviewed in Ref. 19Tanoue T. Nishida E. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Indeed, the TI-JIP sequence is directly derived from the KIM present in the JNK pathway scaffold protein, JIP-1. Given the homology between TI-JIP and other KIM sequences, we hypothesized that similar KIM-based peptides might function as inhibitors of JNK activity. This hypothesis is supported by recent work by Ho et al. (29Ho D.T. Bardwell A.J. Abdollahi M. Bardwell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32662-32672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), who reported that a docking site in MKK4 mediates high affinity binding to JNKs and competes with similar docking sites in JNK substrates. A peptide version of this docking site was found to inhibit MKK4/JNK binding, MKK4-mediated phosphorylation of JNK1, and JNK2-mediated phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF-2 when used"

https://openalex.org/W2031426696,"Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a transcription factor that plays an important role in the immune system and cell death. Many viral proteins modulate NF-κB to escape host immune surveillance, promote cell survival, and enhance viral replication. In the present study, we show that NF-κB activity is downmodulated by viral interferon regulatory factor 3 (vIRF3), which is encoded by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus open-reading frame K10.5. vIRF3 repressed NF-κB-dependent transcription in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited the activation of NF-κB induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. In vivo studies showed vIRF3 inhibited IκB kinase β (IKKβ) activity, but not IKKα activity, resulting in reduced IκB phosphorylation. Immunofluorescence assays showed that vIRF3 interfered with nuclear translocation of NF-κB. In addition, consistent with the inhibition of NF-κB activity, vIRF3 sensitized cells to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. While vIRF3 interacts with IKKβ in vitro and in 293T cells, we were unable to demonstrate vIRF3–IKKβ interaction in BCBL-1 cells. Our results indicate that vIRF3 can regulate the host immune system and apoptosis via inhibition of NF-κB activity."
https://openalex.org/W1995318982,"Cdk5 regulates myogenesis but the signaling cascade through which Cdk5 modulates this process remains to be characterized. Here, we investigated whether PI3K, Akt, p70S6K, p38 MAPK, p44/42 MAPK, and Egr-1 serve as upstream regulators of Cdk5 during L6 myoblast differentiation. Upon serum reduction, we found that besides elevated expression of Cdk5 and its activator, p35, and increased Cdk5/p35 activity, Egr-1, Akt, p70S6K, and p38 MAPK activity were upregulated in differentiating L6 cells. However, p44/42 MAPK was downregulated and SAPK/JNK was unaffected. LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, blocked the activation of Akt and p70S6K, indicating that Akt and p70S6K activation is linked to PI3K activation. The lack of LY294002 effect on p38 MAPK suggests that p38 MAPK activation is not associated with PI3K activation. Rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of FRAP/mTOR (the upstream kinase of p70S6K), also blocked p70S6K activation, indicating the involvement of FRAP/mTOR activation. LY294002 and rapamycin also blocked the enhancement of Egr-1 level, Cdk5 activity, and myogenin expression, suggesting that upregulation of these factors is coupled to PI3K-p70S6K activation. Overexpression of dominant-negative-Akt also reduced Cdk5/p35 activity and myogenin expression, indicating that the PI3K-p70S6K-Egr-1-Cdk5 signaling cascade is linked to Akt activation. SB2023580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, had no effect on p70S6K, Egr-1, or Cdk5 activity, suggesting that p38 MAPK activation lies in a pathway distinct from the PI3K-Akt-p70S6K-Egr-1 pathway that we identify as the upstream modulator of Cdk5 activity during L6 myoblast differentiation."

RIP3 is an important component of the tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1) signaling complex. Sequence analysis reveals that RIP3 contains an N-terminal RIP-like kinase domain (amino acids 21-287) that shares extensive homology with the corresponding N-terminal kinase domain in other RIP family members. Interestingly, in sharp contrast to RIP, which has a C-terminal death domain (DD), RIP2, which has a C-terminal caspase-recruiting domain, and RIP4, which has 11 C-terminal ankyrin repeats, RIP3 possesses a unique C-terminal domain (amino acids 288-518) that shares no significant homology to any known proteins. It has been shown that the N terminus of RIP3 is required for its kinase activity and autophosphorylation, whereas the C terminus of RIP3 is responsible for caspase activation and apoptosis induction (1Yu P.W.

Furthermore, RIP3 is recruited to the TNFR1 signaling complex through interaction with RIP via its C-terminal segment, and, once recruited to the complex, RIP3 could exert a pro-apoptotic activity that may be partially accomplished by activating caspases and/or by inhibiting RIP- and TNFR1-induced NF-κB activation (2Sun X.Q.

Although RIP3 is involved in TNF-α-mediated apoptosis, the mechanism by which RIP3 induces cell death remains largely unclear (7Newton K. Sun X.Q. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1464-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Because the C terminus of RIP3 is unique and involved in apoptosis induction, we are mainly focused on this unique C-terminal segment to investigate its functional significance in RIP3 signaling. Previous studies have demonstrated that both TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD) and Fas-associated death domain (FADD), two essential DD-containing adapter molecules, are recruited to the TNFR1 complex during TNF-α-induced death signaling, and their function and localization are widely assumed to be cytoplasmic. However, recent studies have shown that TRADD and FADD contain both a nuclear export signal (NES) and a nuclear localization signal (NLS), capable of nuclear export and import and causing proteins to transport between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (8Morgan M. Thorburn J. Pandolfi P.P. Thorburn A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 975-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 9Gómez-Angelats M. Cidlowski J.A.

The detailed mechanisms of nucleocytoplasmic transport and possible roles of these proteins in nuclear apoptotic signaling remain unclear. In this study, we have delineated a minimal domain of RIP3 sufficient for apoptosis induction to amino acids (aa) 442-472, a short region of 31 residues in length. This fragment (aa 442-472) also functions as an unconventional NLS and is found to be located predominantly in the nucleus. Furthermore, we present the evidence that RIP3 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein. This characterized single NLS is capable of conferring the import of full-length RIP3 protein to the nucleus. In addition, we identified two novel leucine-rich NESs that are responsible for the nuclear export of RIP3 via a CRM1-mediated mechanism and an additional leucine-rich NES in the N-terminal region of RIP3, which appears to regulate the cytoplasmic distribution of RIP3 in a CRM1-independent manner. Reagents—Hoechst 33342 and general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-Fmk were purchased from Sigma. MitoTracker Red CMXRos was obtained from Molecular Probes. NES inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) was a generous gift from Dr. Minoru Yoshida (RIKEN Institute, Japan). Plasmid Construction—The cDNA encoding full-length RIP3 was isolated by PCR from human brain cDNA library (Clontech). The amplified fragment was digested with BglII and XhoI and then cloned into BglII-XhoI sites of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) to generate pEGFP-C1/RIP3. The EcoRI- and XhoI-digested segment coding for the truncated mutant RIP3ΔN223 was inserted into EcoRI-SalI-digested pEGFP-C1 to yield pEGFP-C1/RIP3ΔN223. The fragment coding for RIP3 was digested with SalI and NotI and subcloned into the compatible sites of pCI-neo/Myc to create pCI-neo/Myc-RIP3. Various N-terminally GFP-tagged RIP3 mutants used for mapping the minimal region and attesting both NESs and NLSs were created by inserting EcoRI-XhoI-digested fragments into EcoRI-SalI sites of pEGFP-C1. The fragments coding for Bcl-ramboΔN204 or amino acid residues 1-56 from Smac/DIABLO were digested and inserted into EcoRI-SalI sites of pEGFP-C1 or BglII-XhoI sites of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), respectively. The BamHI-NotI-digested fragment encoding GFP-RIP3ΔN223 or GFP-RIP3 was subcloned into the same sites of pHis-TAT-PTD-GFP (11Yang Y.H. Ma J. Song Z.Y. Wu M.

HeLa cells in 24-well plates were cultured to subconfluence (5 × 105 cells) and transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids. At 24 h post-transfection, both floating and adherent cells were fixed and stained with 2 μg/ml Hoechst 33342. At least eight different fields were selected randomly, and the percentages of apoptotic cells among the total number of cells were counted based on the dead cells having DNA fragmentation and/or chromatin condensation under a fluorescence microscope and morphological changes under phase contrast. The data are the means of at least three independent experiments. Western Blotting—Western blot was carried out as described by Yang et al. (11Yang Y.H. Ma J. Song Z.Y. Wu M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested, washed, and then resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) on ice for 30 min. The lysates were centrifuged, and both supernatants and pellets were mixed with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer, respectively. The samples were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the resolved proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The blot was blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline plus Tween (TBST) and then incubated with mouse anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Clontech) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with TBST, the membrane was incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Promega). The membrane was washed three times with TBST followed by two brief washes with TBS. The proteins were visualized using Western Blue-stabilized substrate for alkaline phosphatase (Promega). Site-directed Mutagenesis—PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was performed mainly as described previously (13Song Z.Y. Yao X.B. Wu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23130-23140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). All the mutations induced by PCR were further verified by DNA sequencing. Indirect Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells were grown on glass coverslips and then transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids. At 24 h after transfection, cells were washed once with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS, and then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. The cells were incubated with mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (1:500, Clontech) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for another 1 h. After rinsing three times with PBS for 5 min, the cells were stained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 for 1 min, mounting medium containing an anti-fading agent (Vector Laboratories) was added, and the cells were visualized under a fluorescence microscope using standard filter for red fluorescence. Images were captured with an Olympus IX70 microscope controlled by Viewfinder Lite (version 1.0) armed with a ×40 objective lens. Computational Amino Acid Sequence Analysis—Multiple sequence alignments were performed using Multalin software (14Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4347) Google Scholar). Mapping the Minimal Region of RIP3 Sufficient for Apoptosis Induction—Previous studies have shown that expression of RIP3 induces apoptosis, but the minimal domain of RIP3 that promotes apoptosis remains uncharacterized. To pinpoint the minimal region of RIP3 that is sufficient to induce cell death, we prepared a series of constructs by linking GFP to the N terminus of RIP3 deletion mutants (Fig. 1A). The expression of all the GFP fusion constructs was verified by Western blot (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1 (A and C), unlike RIP3ΔN223, which was shown to promote cell death (2Sun X.Q. Lee J. Navas T. Baldwin D.T. Stewart T.A. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16871-16875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), RIP3-(224-460) lacking the C-terminal 58 residues failed to induce apoptosis, indicating that aa 461-518 were required for its pro-apoptotic activity. However, RIP3ΔN460 was found unable to mediate apoptosis, suggesting that the region spanning residue 460 appeared to be crucial for its apoptotic function. As shown in Fig. 1 (A and C), besides RIP3ΔN350 and RIP3ΔN428, a smaller fragment RIP3-(429-483) with only 55 residues in length was also able to induce apoptosis spontaneously. To more precisely map the minimal region, we started with amino acid 460 as a central residue and generated six additional RIP3 deletion mutants by gradually deleting about 10 residues each time from either the N or the C termini. As shown in Fig. 1 (A and C), although RIP3-(429-472) promoted apoptosis, RIP3-(429-460) failed to induce cell death, implying that the region from aa 461 to 472 must be included for its apoptosis induction. In addition, although RIP3-(442-483) was shown to induce apoptosis, RIP3-(451-483) failed to do so, suggesting aa 442-450 was indispensable. Finally, RIP3-(442-472) containing both aa 461-472 and aa 442-450 was found to induce significant apoptosis, whereas RIP3-(451-472) lacking aa 442-450 failed to elicit apoptosis. Based on these results, we have delineated the minimal region of RIP3 sufficient for apoptosis induction to aa 442-472, a fragment of 31 residues in length, that is sufficient to trigger apoptosis upon ectopic expression alone. RIP3 Is Localized to the Cytoplasm, but Not to Mitochondria—Cellular compartmentation is essential for proper function of a protein. RIP3 is recruited to the TNFR1 complex and is thus assumed to be primarily cytoplasmic. However, the precise subcellular localization of RIP3 from limited published data remains controversial (5Kasof G.M. Prosser J.C. Liu D. Lorenzi M.V. Gomes B.C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 6Sun X.Q. Yin J.P. Starovasnik M.A. Fairbrother W.J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9505-9511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). To ascertain the intracellular localization of RIP3 in living cells, GFP, GFP-tagged RIP3, or GFP-tagged RIP3ΔN223 was transfected into HeLa cells, respectively (Fig. 2A). The expression of constructs was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2C, GFP alone was distributed evenly throughout the cells (panel a). In contrast, the full-length RIP3 fused to the C terminus of GFP was located specifically in the cytoplasm in a diffused pattern (panel e). Similarly, fusion of RIP3ΔN223 with GFP also displayed a cytoplasmic localization, but predominantly in a punctuated pattern within the cytoplasm (panel i). To examine whether these two different cytoplasmic localization patterns resulted from both full-length RIP3 and the N-terminal-truncated RIP3ΔN223 could be attributed to the kinase activity in the N terminus of RIP3, we generated a point mutant RIP3 (K50A), in which Lys50 was replaced by alanine to abrogate the kinase activity of RIP3 (1Yu P.W. Huang B.C.B. Shen M. Quast J. Chan E. Xu X. Nolan G.P. Payan D.G. Luo Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 539-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 2Sun X.Q. Lee J. Navas T. Baldwin D.T. Stewart T.A. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16871-16875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, the K50A substitution significantly increased the number of cells with punctate structures within the cytoplasm (panel m), indicating that the loss of kinase activity may associate with the accumulation of punctate structures within the cytoplasm. It is worthwhile to point out that our conclusion regarding cytoplasmic localization of RIP3 differed from a previous report in which they claimed that RIP3 was solely localized to the mitochondrion (5Kasof G.M. Prosser J.C. Liu D. Lorenzi M.V. Gomes B.C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To have a sustainable support for our conclusion, we further utilized two bona fide mitochondrial proteins, namely Bcl-rambo and Smac/DIABLO (15Kataoka T. Holler N. Micheau O. Martinon F. Tinel A. Hofmann K. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19548-19554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 16Du C.Y. Fang M. Li Y.C. Li L. Wang X.D. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar), as references for mitochondrial location. As shown in Fig. 2 (A and C), GFP fusion protein, with truncated Bcl-rambo (Bcl-ramboΔN204) containing its C-terminal membrane anchor, was found exclusively in the mitochondrion (Fig. 2C, panel q). Likewise, when a segment consisting of the first 56 residues (mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS)) from Smac/DIABLO was fused to the N terminus of GFP (Fig. 2A), this GFP fusion protein was specifically distributed in mitochondria (Fig. 2C, panel u). As expected, the merged images for both GFP-Bcl-ramboΔN204 and sMTS/56-GFP showed a uniform yellow pattern (Fig. 2C, panels t and x). In contrast, merged images shown in Fig. 2C (panels h, l, and p) revealed that RIP3, RIP3ΔN223, and RIP3 (K50A) localizations were quite distinct from the mitochondrial localizations specified by MitoTracker Red. Taken together, we clearly demonstrated that both full-length RIP3 and RIP3ΔN223 were mainly localized to the cytoplasm, but not to mitochondria. RIP3 Is an LMB-sensitive Nucleocytoplasmic Shuttling Protein—Recently, it has been shown that TRADD can be transported to the nucleus from the cytoplasm, which is regulated by inhibiting the CRM1-mediated nuclear export with leptomycin B (LMB) (8Morgan M. Thorburn J. Pandolfi P.P. Thorburn A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 975-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Similar to TRADD, RIP3 is also recruited to the TNFR1 signaling complex and is primarily localized in the cytoplasm as described above; it is reasonable for us to inquire whether RIP3 undergoes a similar nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. In HeLa cells, GFP-RIP3 was localized mainly in the cytoplasm in the absence of LMB. However, LMB treatment at 37 °C markedly changed the subcellular distribution of GFP-RIP3, which was relocated to the nucleus and distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm with a slightly more nuclear accumulation (Fig. 3A, left panel), indicating that the effective export of RIP3 from the nucleus to cytosol is CRM1-dependent. This nuclear export is hindered upon LMB treatment, and as a result, imported RIP3 synthesized in the cytoplasm starts to accumulate in the nucleus. Furthermore, we also tested the response of GFP-RIP3 to LMB treatment at 4 °C. In this case, not only CRM1-mediated nuclear export was blocked due to the presence of LMB, but also active nuclear import was stagnant because of low temperature. As expected, GFP-RIP3 remained in a cytoplasmic localization pattern (Fig. 3A, middle panel). As a negative control, we examined the effect of the cellular distribution of YFP3, a triple yellow fluorescent protein, to LMB treatment. YFP3 was primarily localized within the cytoplasm. In distinct contrast to GFP-RIP3, the cellular localization of YFP3 remained unchanged upon treatment with LMB at 37 °C (Fig. 3A, right panel). Collectively, our results demonstrated that, on one hand, export from the nucleus is in a CRM1-dependent fashion and, on the other hand, transport of RIP3 into the nucleus is a temperature-sensitive process. To rule out the possibility that GFP had caused an interference with RIP3 shuttling, we fused RIP3 with Myc epitope to generate Myc-RIP3, and its subcellular distribution was further assessed by indirect immunofluorescence. As shown in Fig. 3B, Myc-RIP3 was excluded from the nucleus and localized exclusively to the cytoplasm in the absence of LMB (upper panel). Myc-RIP3 was evident in both nucleus and cytoplasm when Myc-RIP3-expressing cells were treated with LMB at 37 °C (Fig. 3B, lower panel), confirming that RIP3 itself was able to travel between the cytoplasm and the nucleus independent of its fusion partner. In addition, a construct coding for a chimeric fusion protein containing an exogenous NLS from HIV-1 TAT protein transduction domain (PTD) (11Yang Y.H. Ma J. Song Z.Y. Wu M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) at the N terminus of GFP-RIP3 was transiently transfected into HeLa cells (Fig. 3C). Unexpectedly, TAT-PTD-GFP-RIP3 was found to localize mainly in the cytoplasm instead of being targeted into the nucleus by TAT-PTD, indicating that the nuclear export activity of RIP3 may have overcome the nuclear targeting ability of TAT-PTD, resulting in a net export of TAT-PTD-GFP-RIP3 from the nucleus. Identification and Characterization of Two Functional Leucine-rich NESs in RIP3—We have shown that RIP3ΔN223 was located to the cytoplasm and promoted apoptosis. To investigate whether the cytoplasmic location of RIP3ΔN223 is necessary for its apoptotic activity, we once linked a TAT-PTD (NLS) to RIP3ΔN223 to change its subcellular location from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. To our surprise, TAT-PTD (NLS), when fused to the N terminus of GFP-RIP3ΔN223, failed to dislocate the TAT-PTD-GFP-RIP3ΔN223 into the nucleus (Fig. 4A), implying that a cytoplasmic retention sequence or NES may exist in this region. To address this point, we scrutinized the amino acid sequence in this region and found two distinctive leucine-rich NES-like sequences, one is 255LEGLKELMQL264 (NES-1) near the C terminus of the kinase domain, and the other is 344MVSEWLNKLNL354 (NES-2) present at the unique C terminus of RIP3 (Fig. 4B). These sequences resembled those previously identified leucine-rich NESs characterized by the presence of four closely spaced hydrophobic residues, most often leucine (17Cour T.I. Gupta R. Rapacki K. Skriver K. Poulsen F.M. Brunak S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments revealed that two NES-like motifs of RIP3 were closely similar to the NES consensus (Fig. 4C).Fig. 4RIP3 contains two putative leucine-rich NESs. A, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pHis-TAT-PTD-GFP or pHis-TATPTD-GFP-RIP3ΔN223 (in the presence of Z-VAD-Fmk). At 24 h, the subcellular localization was observed under fluorescence microscope (magnification, ×400). B, schematic representation of the primary structure of RIP3 showing the various protein domains as described by Yu et al. (1Yu P.W. Huang B.C.B. Shen M. Quast J. Chan E. Xu X. Nolan G.P. Payan D.G.

Two putative NESs and their positions are indicated. N, nuclear; C, cytoplasmic; N+C, both nuclear and cytoplasmic. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the indicated constructs, including deletion mutants and point mutants. 24 h after transfection, subcellular distribution was viewed in living cells by fluorescence microscopy (magnification, ×400), and expression was analyzed by Western blot with anti-GFP antibody. E, HeLa cells expressing GFP-tagged RIP3-(224-287) or RIP3-(288-358) were left untreated or treated with LMB (2 ng/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h, cells were stained with Hoechst, and cellular localization was visualized by fluorescence microscopy (magnification, ×400). F, 24 h after transient transfection, HeLa ells expressing GFP-RIP3-(288-358) were left untreated or treated with LMB (2 ng/ml) for the indicated periods of time. At specific time points, cells were stained with Hoechst and then visualized directly in living cells under a fluorescence microscope (magnification, ×400).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate whether these putative leucine-rich sequences can truly function as NESs, we examined the subcellular localizations of a series of GFP-tagged RIP3 deletion mutants by fluorescence microscopy. As seen in Fig. 4D, different GFP-RIP3 fusion proteins containing either NES-1 or NES-2 or both displayed predominantly cytoplasmic localizations, despite the fact that RIP3-(224-287) containing only NES-1 exhibited a relatively modest export activity compared with RIP3-(288-358) containing only NES-2. To further characterize a shorter NES-2-containing sequence, we generated a RIP3-(333-358) mutant that contains only 26 residues. This fusion protein was still found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4D), indicating that aa 333-358 were sufficient to export GFP protein to the cytoplasm. Thus, we have identified two novel leucine-rich NESs in RIP3, which were capable of directing GFP proteins to the cytoplasm. It has been shown that the leucine residues within the leucine-rich NES are critical for its nuclear export activity (18Ura S. Masuyama N. Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10148-10153Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To elucidate the functional significance of these hydrophobic residues, we generated two point mutants in which leucine was substituted to alanine (Fig. 4C). As shown in Fig. 4D, mutant RIP3-(224-287) L255A/L258A/L261A/L264A (NES-1m) dramatically disrupted the cytoplasmic localization and distributed throughout the cells. Likewise, mutant RIP3-(288-358) M344A/L349A/L352A/L354A (NES-2m) was found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. We therefore concluded that RIP3 owns two functional NES-1 and NES-2, and mutations at mostly conserved residues (Leu or Met) within NESs completely abolish their nuclear export activity and thus result in relocation to both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Protein export from the nucleus is often mediated by the leucine-rich NES that interacts with its export receptor CRM1, which is specifically inhibited by LMB (19Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 20Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). To test whether these two NESs are sensitive to LMB, we examined the effect of LMB treatment on NES-1 and NES-2. As shown in Fig. 4E, both RIP3-(224-287) and RIP3-(288-358) were sensitive to LMB treatment and resulted in nuclear accumulation by passive diffusion because of their small size, confirming that both NES-1 and NES-2 are capable of directing proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in an LMB-sensitive, CRM1-dependent nuclear export manner. In addition, the time course of LMB treatment on the nuclear export activity of NES-2 was also examined. Cells expressing RIP3-(288-358) were incubated with"

https://openalex.org/W1971804207,"Recent molecular genetic studies have revealed that two major types of genomic instabilities, chromosomal instability (CIN) and microsatellite instability (MSI), exist in colorectal carcinomas. In order to clarify the molecular signature related to the CIN and MSI in colorectal carcinomas, we performed transcriptomic expression analysis on eight microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colorectal carcinomas and compared the results obtained with that of nine microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal carcinomas using oligonucleotide microarrays containing 17 334 known genes and 1331 unknown genes or expression sequence tags (ESTs). Unsupervised two-way hierarchical clustering with 5724 genes successfully classified tumors from normal mucosa, and displayed a distinctive MSI-H carcinomas subgroup. Based on intensive filtering, 57 known genes and eight ESTs were found to be highly relevant to the differentiation of MSI-H and MSS colorectal carcinomas. These genes successfully distinguish the new test set of six MSI-H and five MSS colorectal carcinomas. Many up- and downregulated genes in MSI-H colorectal carcinomas were related to the previously reported phenotypic characteristics; increased mucin production and intense peritumoral immune response in MSI-H carcinomas. Some of these differences were confirmed by semiquantitative reverse transcription–PCR and immunohistochemical analysis. Our findings indicate that there are many different genetic and transcriptomic characteristics between MSI-H and MSS colorectal carcinomas, and some of these differently expressed genes can be used as diagnostic or prognostic markers."
https://openalex.org/W1991747421,"The multidrug resistance protein MRP1 is an ATP-dependent transporter of organic anions and chemotherapeutic agents. A significant number of ionizable amino acids are found in or proximal to the 17 transmembrane (TM) helices of MRP1, and we have investigated 6 of these at the cytoplasmic interface of TM13-17 for their role in MRP1 expression and transport activity. Opposite charge substitutions of TM13 Arg1046 and TM15 Arg1131 did not alter MRP1 expression nor did they substantially affect activity. In contrast, opposite charge substitutions of TM16 Arg1202 and Glu1204 reduced protein expression by >80%; however, MRP1 expression was not affected when Arg1202 and Glu1204 were replaced with neutral or same-charge residues. In addition, organic anion transport levels of the R1202L, R1202G, and R1202K mutants were comparable with wild-type MRP1. In contrast, organic anion transport by E1204L was substantially reduced, whereas transport by E1204D was comparable with wild-type MRP1, with the notable exception of GSH. Opposite charge substitutions of TM16 Arg1197 and TM17 Arg1249 did not affect MRP1 expression but substantially reduced transport. Mutants containing like-charge substitutions of Arg1197 or Arg1249 were also transport-inactive and no longer bound leukotriene C4. In contrast, substrate binding by the transport-compromised E1204L mutant remained intact. Furthermore, vanadate-induced trapping of azido-ADP by E1204L was dramatically increased, indicating that this mutation may cause a partial uncoupling of the catalytic and transport activities of MRP1. Thus, Glu1204 serves a dual role in membrane expression of MRP1 and a step in its catalytic cycle subsequent to initial substrate binding."
https://openalex.org/W1975108806,"The p53 protein is a central player in cellular response to DNA damage. Induction of p53 by DNA-damaging agents involves elevation of its steady-state level and activation of its potency as a transcription factor. In the cell population, these responses can occur either homogeneously (where every single cell responds simultaneously and similarly to its neighbor) or heterogeneously (where only some cells of a population respond and the number of these increases with increasing dose of inducer). We have studied here the p53 response to DNA-damaging agents (camptothecin, mitomycin C) in individual cells. We show that the level of p53 protein is increased in every single cell of the population homogeneously, while the p53-dependent transcription can be subject to an on/off-type response. Depending on the structure of the target promoter, p53-dependent transcription can be regulated according to the binary or graded model. The on/off-type transcriptional activation pattern of p53 defines two distinct subpopulations of cells after DNA damage."

D'Amore E.S. Sainati L. Panarello C. Morerio C. Mark J. Stenman G. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 16: 1107-1110PubMed Google Scholar) as well as lipoblastomas (1Astrom A. D'Amore E.S. Sainati L. Panarello C.

Genet. 1997; 15: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). PLAG1 encodes a zinc finger transcription factor, and the PLAGL1 (PLAG-like 1) and PLAGL2 (PLAG-like 2) genes (3Kas K. Voz M.L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 23026-23032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) constitute two structurally related family members (1Astrom A. D'Amore E.S. Sainati L. Panarello C. Morerio C. Mark J. Stenman G. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 16: 1107-1110PubMed Google Scholar). The main mechanism of oncogenic activation involves recurrent chromosome translocations leading to promoter substitution between PLAG1, a gene primarily expressed in various tissues during fetal development, and more broadly and constitutively expressed genes. Chromosome breakpoints invariably occur in the 5′-non-coding region of PLAG1, causing an exchange of regulatory control elements without structurally affecting the coding sequences of the PLAG1 gene. This process, also known as promoter swapping, leads to ectopic expression of PLAG1 in the tumor cells. It is assumed that such abnormal PLAG1 expression causes a deregulation of expression of PLAG1 target genes and leads to tumor development in these tissues (1Astrom A. D'Amore E.S. Sainati L. Panarello C. Morerio C. Mark J. Stenman G. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 16: 1107-1110PubMed Google Scholar, 4Voz M.L. Astrom A.K. Kas K. Mark J. Stenman G. Van de Ven W.J.

Furthermore, ectopic PLAG1 expression has also been found in tumors without 8q12 translocations, such as pleomorphic salivary gland adenomas with chromosome 12q15 translocations or with a normal karyotype, in leiomyomas of the uterus, and in leiomyosarcomas (5Astrom A.K. Voz M.L. Kas K. Roijer E. Wedell B. Mandahl N. Van de Ven W. Mark J. Stenman G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 918-923PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of the PLAG1 protooncogene in the development of various tumor types emphasizes its more general importance in tumorigenesis.The oncogenic potential of PLAG1 has been established by various experimental approaches (7Hensen K. Van Valckenborgh I.C. Kas K. Van de Ven W.J. Voz M.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1510-1517PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of PLAG1 in NIH-3T3 cells leads to cell proliferation in serum-deprived (1%) medium, suggesting that PLAG1 partially abrogates the serum requirement for the growth of these cells. These PLAG1-overexpressing NIH-3T3 cells also displayed the typical transformation hallmarks, i.e. the cells no longer possess cell-cell contact inhibition, show anchorage-independent growth and, upon injection into nude mice, develop into tumors. Structurally, the PLAG1 transcription factor contains seven canonical C2H2 zinc fingers and a serine-rich C terminus with transactivation capacity (3Kas K. Voz M.L. Hensen K. Meyen E. Van de Ven W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23026-23032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). PLAG1 specifically recognizes a bipartite DNA-binding consensus sequence consisting of a core sequence, GRGGC, and a G-cluster, GGG, which are separated by about 6–8 nucleotides (8Voz M.L. Agten N.S. Van de Ven W.J. Kas K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 106-113PubMed Google Scholar). In recent microarray analyses, genes were identified that are consistently induced or repressed by PLAG1, and these were classified into various functional categories. Among the classes of up-regulated PLAG1 targets, the one of growth factors was the largest and included insulin-like growth factor II, cytokine-like factor-1 (CLF-1), bone-derived growth factor (BPGF-1), choriogonadotropin β chain, vascular endothelial growth factor, and placental growth factor. From in silico evaluation of their promoter regions, it appeared that a large proportion of them harbor several copies of the specific bipartite DNA-binding consensus sequence, suggesting that they constitute direct PLAG1 targets. The in silico studies, furthermore, indicated that PLAG1-down-regulated genes are likely to be regulated indirectly by PLAG1 since the typical PLAG1 DNA-binding consensus sequences were not present in their promotor regions (9Voz M.L. Mathys J. Hensen K. Pendeville H. Van Valckenborgh I. Van Huffel C. Chavez M. Van Damme B. De Moor B. Moreau Y. Van de Ven W.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).At present, little information is available on the mechanism(s) by which the PLAG1 transcription factor regulates expression of its target genes. Most transcription factors act as part of a complex composed of several polypeptides, each with a distinct function. This, for instance, has already been described for PLAGL1, which can function as a transcriptional co-activator or repressor for hormone-dependent activity of nuclear receptors when acting together with other proteins (10Huang S.M. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1855-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Here, we report about experiments that were designed to identify and characterize PLAG1 interaction partners, with the objective to gain more insight in the protein environment that allows PLAG1 to modulate gene transcription and to reveal the mechanism of regulation of this transactivation capacity. Therefore, yeast two-hybrid screenings were performed, candidate interaction partners were validated by GST pull-down, and selected candidates were functionally evaluated with respect to the transactivating potential of PLAG1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis—Hemagglutinin-tagged pcDNA3-PLAG1 (8Voz M.L. Agten N.S. Van de Ven W.J. Kas K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 106-113PubMed Google Scholar) with single amino acid substitutions K244R, K263R, or K353R, as well as the double mutant K244R/K263R, were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutations were confirmed by nucleic acid sequencing, and such PLAG1-mutated DNA was subcloned into DraIII/XhoI-digested hemagglutinin-tagged pCAGGS-PLAG1 to achieve higher levels of expression (8Voz M.L. Agten N.S. Van de Ven W.J. Kas K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 106-113PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length PLAG1 from pcDNA3-PLAG1 was subcloned as an MscI/XhoI DNA fragment into the pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech), digested with ScaI and SalI, and subcloned as a BalI/XhoI DNA fragment into the pHIL vector (Invitrogen), digested with SalI/XhoI. The K244R, K363R, and K244R/K363R mutant forms of these constructs were also generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit.Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—The DNA fragment of mouse Plagl2, coding for amino acids 1–382, was cloned in the EcoRI/SalI sites of the pBD-Gal4 Cam vector to obtain expression of a fusion protein containing the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) as bait. No activation of HIS3 and LacZ reporter genes was detected in case the Plagl2/Gal4-DBD fusion protein was expressed in the presence of the control prey plasmid. An embryonic 12.5-days post-coitum cDNA mouse library cloned in pACT2 vector (Novagen) generated the prey fusion proteins containing the Gal4 transcription activating domain. This library was screened as follows: yeast strain CG-1945, containing a HIS3 and a lacZ reporter gene under the control of promoters containing the GAL4-binding sites, was transformed with 66 μg of bait-DNA and 33 μg of prey-library DNA using a LiAc high efficiency transformation protocol (11Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). Transformants were grown for 10 days at 30 °C on triple-selective (lacking Trp, Leu, and His) synthetic dropout (SD-) agar plates containing 5 mm 3-acyl-transferase (Sigma). Transformed His+ yeast colonies were transferred onto new SD- agar plates and grown for another 1–2 days. Colony-lift replica filters were made to qualitatively measure β-galactosidase activity. Briefly, a sterile nitrocellulose filter was placed onto the surface of the agar plates containing the colonies to be assayed. The filter was lifted off the agar plates, completely submerged in liquid nitrogen for 10 s, and placed onto Z-buffer-saturated 3MM Whatman paper (Z-buffer contains 60 mm Na2HPO4,40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.27% β-mercapto-ethanol, and 0.033% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) (pH 7)). Filters were then incubated at 30 °C and periodically checked for the appearance of blue colonies.GST Pull-down Assays—cDNAs comprising the coding part of human PLAG1-(1–500), PLAGL1-(3–463), and mouse Plagl2-(3–496), were prepared by PCR and cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI-digested pcDNA3 vector. These constructs were used to prepare in vitro synthesized [35S]-methionine labeled PLAG1, PLAGL1, and Plagl2, respectively. The in vitro translation reaction was carried out using the TnT T7 Quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bacterial expression constructs of rat PIASxα and rat PIASxβ in pGEX-4T-3 and pGEX-5x-1, respectively, and of hPIASy, mPIAS1, and mPIAS3 in pGEX-4T-1, directed the synthesis of GST fused to the corresponding protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) proteins. The PIAS fusion proteins and, as a negative control, GST alone were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads. Equal amounts of these proteins were incubated with 7 μl of in vitro synthesized [35S]-methionine labeled PLAG1, PLAGL1, or Plagl2 in 500 μl of NENT500 buffer (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). This mixture was incubated on a rotator overnight at 4 °C. Beads were then washed four times in 500 μl of NENT500 buffer, resuspended in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and incubated at 95 °C for 2 min. Proteins were size-separated on SDS-PAGE, and interacting PLAG1, PLAGL1, or Plagl2 proteins were detected by autoradiography.Western Blot Analysis—Cell extracts from COS7 cells (ATCC CRL1651) were prepared 48 h after transfection in SDS sample buffer (5% SDS, 0.15 m Tris HCl (pH 6.7), 30% glycerol), diluted 1:3 in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 8.2), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% azide), containing 10 mm iodoacetamide and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) (12Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Samples containing equal protein amounts were heated at 95 °C for 5 min, size-fractionated by electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (PROTRAN nitrocellulose transfer membrane, Schleicher & Schuell BioScience). PLAG1 was detected with a rabbit polyclonal anti-PLAG1 antibody (1:3000 diluted), directed against the N-terminal part of PLAG1 (13Debiec-Rychter M. Van Valckenborgh I. Van den Broeck C. Hagemeijer A. Van de Ven W.J. Kas K. Van Damme B. Voz M.L. Lab. Investig. 2001; 81: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), followed by an incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibody (PRO-SAN; DAKO; 1:1000 diluted). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the suppliers' protocols.Nuclear Protein Extraction—Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, collected, and spun down. The cell pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9). After a 15-min incubation at 4 °C, 12.5 μl of Nonidet P-40 10% was added, and the nuclei were spun down at 13,000 rpm. The nuclei were resuspended in a buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9). Resuspension by vortexing, followed by an incubation step of 10 min at 4 °C, was repeated four times (40 min in total). The samples were frozen quickly in liquid nitrogen and defrozen at 37 °C twice. The nuclear debris was separated from the nuclear lysate by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge.Mammalian Pull-down—COS7 cells, grown in 6-well plates, were collected in microcentrifuge tubes, 48 h after transfection, and a nuclear extraction was performed according to the protocol described above. An equivalent amount of GS beads was used per well. The beads were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and twice in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 1 m NaF (1:100), 0.5 m Na3VO4 (1:500), and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The beads were then added either to the nuclear extract or, as a control, to the cytoplasmic extract. After incubation overnight at 4 °Con a rotator, the beads were washed four times in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer. The samples were analyzed on SDS-PAGE according to the protocol also used for Western blot analysis. SUMO-1-Myc-modified PLAG1 was detected using a mouse anti-Myc antibody (1:3000 diluted), whereas SUMOylation of PLAG1 by SUMO-1-Myc or by endogenous SUMO-1 was detected using mouse monoclonal anti-SUMO-1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:1000 diluted). Blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG as secondary antibody (PROSAN; DAKO; 1:1000 diluted). To remove primary and secondary antibodies, membranes were submerged in stripping buffer (100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)). Blots were subsequently reprobed, first with rabbit polyclonal anti-PLAG1 antibody (1:3000 diluted), directed against the N-terminal part of PLAG1 (13Debiec-Rychter M. Van Valckenborgh I. Van den Broeck C. Hagemeijer A. Van de Ven W.J. Kas K. Van Damme B. Voz M.L. Lab. Investig. 2001; 81: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and secondly with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibody (PROSAN; DAKO; 1:1000 diluted).Fluorescence Microscopy—COS7 cells were used to examine the expression and subcellular localization of the PLAG1-GFP fusion proteins. Cells were grown to 70–80% confluence on coverslips in 24-well plates. 42 h after transfection, the cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature in 4% formaldehyde (diluted in phosphate-buffered saline). Three subsequent wash steps were performed in phosphate-buffered saline. The slides were then mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) supplemented with 1/1000 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for analysis under a fluorescence microscope.Transcription Reporter Assays—The human fetal kidney epithelial cell line HEK 293 (ATCC CRL 1573) was cultured according to the suppliers' protocols. Cells (grown in 24-well plates) were co-transfected in duplicate with 250 ng of the (WT2)3TKluc reporter plasmid DNA (8Voz M.L. Agten N.S. Van de Ven W.J. Kas K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 106-113PubMed Google Scholar) and 100 ng of the various hemagglutinin-tagged PLAG1-encoding DNA constructs, namely PLAG1 DNA (encoding residues 1–500 and subcloned in EcoRI/XhoI-digested pCAGGS) or DNA of the various PLAG1 mutants (i.e. K244R, K263R, or K244R/K263R in pCAGGS), in combination with 100 ng of DNA encoding small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-Myc, SUMO-Myc-mutant (SUMO-1 in pSG5; Myc-tagged, 2 C-terminal glycines deleted in the case of the mutant form), or SUMO-specific protease 3 (SSP3). The total DNA amount for transfection was kept the same in each sample (500 ng) by normalizing with empty vector. The transfections were each performed using 1.5 μl of FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested 42 h after transfection, and luciferase reporter enzyme activity was measured using a Wallac Victor2 1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).RESULTSSearch for Interaction Partners of PLAG Proteins—To address the question as to whether PLAG-modulated gene transcription involves interacting proteins, we started a search for these. Therefore, we performed a pilot yeast two-hybrid screening assay using an already available mouse Plagl2 bait construct, designated B1–382 mPlagl2. B1–382 mPlagl2 encodes amino acid residues 1–382 representing the zinc finger domain region and the N-terminal part of the serine-rich transactivation domain (Fig. 1A). The construct was generated by PCR starting from a double-stranded mPlagl2 cDNA cloned in the pCG-N vector, and its usefulness (the absence of intrinsic transactivation capacity) was first established. Interactions between B1–382 mPlagl2 and several members of the PIAS protein family as well as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (UBC9) were observed. By GST pull-down experiments (Fig. 1B), the interaction between full-length mPlagl2 and those PIAS proteins was confirmed and, subsequently, similar results were obtained with the human PLAG1 and PLAGL1 proteins (Fig. 1B). It should be noted that in the case of 35S-labeled PLAG1, the upper band corresponds to the full-length 35S-PLAG1, whereas the lower band corresponds to a smaller form, due to translation starting at an alternative initiation site (ATG). Collectively, these results clearly establish the interaction between the various PLAG and PIAS proteins. This observation as well as the observed interaction between Plagl2 and UBC9 indicate that the PLAG proteins could be subjected to post-translational modification via covalent SUMOylation since UBC9 and PIAS proteins act as E2 and E3 ligases, respectively, in the SUMO modification pathway. To address this question, SUMOylation studies were performed, and these all focused on the PLAG1 protein, the founding member of the family.PLAG1 Is SUMOylated, and This Occurs at Two Specific Lysine Residues (Lys-244 and Lys-263)—To test whether or not PLAG1 is SUMOylated, co-transfection experiments were performed. Therefore, COS7 cells were co-transfected with PLAG1 cDNA together with DNA encoding Myc-tagged SUMO-1 or a DNA encoding a Myc-tagged SUMO-1 mutant form, missing the 2 C-terminal glycine residues, as a negative control. Since these 2 glycine residues are necessary for the attachment of SUMO-1 to its target proteins, it should be noted that this mutant form of SUMO-1-Myc cannot bind to its targets anymore. Such transfections were also performed in the presence or absence of the different PIAS proteins encoded by corresponding PIAS DNA constructs. Using anti-PLAG1 antibodies, we observed slower migrating bands in SDS-PAGE, which presumably correspond to SUMO-modified PLAG1 proteins. Western blot analysis revealed two band shifts in the case of PLAG1, pointing toward a double SUMO modification of this protein, whereas band shifts remained absent in cells co-expressing PLAG1 with a mutant form of SUMO-1-Myc (Fig. 2). The consensus SUMOylation sequence is defined as Ψ-Lys-Xaa-Glu, in which Ψ is a large hydrophobic amino acid, most frequently isoleucine or valine, and Xaa can be any amino acid (14Verger A. Perdomo J. Crossley M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Screening (www.abgent.com/sumoplot.html) of the PLAG1 sequence revealed three potential SUMOylation sites with high probability, containing Lys-244, Lys-263, or Lys-353. To test the relevance of these sites, the following single mutants, namely PLAG1-K244R, -K263R, and -K353R, the various double mutants of these, and also the triple mutant were generated. By performing co-transfection experiments using PLAG1 DNA constructs encoding these mutant forms, we established that lysine residues Lys-244 and Lys-263 are genuine targets for SUMOylation of PLAG1 (Fig. 3). Moreover, the K244R mutation seems to have a more profound effect on PLAG1 SUMOylation than the K263R mutant since the first mutation led to the disappearance of both band shifts, pointing to a non-SUMOylated protein, whereas in the case of the K263R-mutated PLAG1, one strong band shift remained detectable (Fig. 3). Upon introduction of both of these two mutations in PLAG1, no detectable levels of SUMOylation could be observed using Western blot analysis. Finally, mutation of the lysine on position 353 did not seem to have any effect since double SUMOylation of PLAG1 remained detectable as two band shifts.Fig. 2PLAG1 is SUMOylated. Western blots, obtained by transferring proteins onto nitrocellulose membranes after size fractionation on 10% polyacrylamide gels, were treated first with rabbit polyclonal anti-PLAG1 antibody PEM 195 (1:3000), directed against the N-terminal part of PLAG1, and subsequently with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). As indicated (arrows), the upper band corresponds to the double SUMO-modified form of PLAG1, the band in the middle corresponds to the single-modified version, and the lower band corresponds to wild-type PLAG1. Molecular mass markers are given. The content of the various lanes is described above the lanes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3PLAG1 is SUMOylated at 2 specific lysine residues (Lys-244 and Lys-263). Western blots, obtained by transferring proteins onto nitrocellulose membranes after size fractionation on 10% polyacrylamide gels, were treated first with rabbit polyclonal anti-PLAG1 antibody PEM 195 (1:3000) directed against the N-terminal part of PLAG1 and subsequently with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Two band shifts (upper two arrows) are present in the case of PLAG1, pointing toward a double SUMO modification of this protein. Three possible SUMO consensus sites (Lys-244, Lys-263, and Lys-353), which were identified based on the presence of a recognizable Ψ-Lys-Xaa-Glu consensus motif, were mutated via site-directed mutagenesis to study these potential targets for SUMOylation of PLAG1. The K244R mutation almost led to a disappearance of both band shifts, whereas in the case of the K263R-mutated PLAG1, the first band shift remained detectable, and in the case of the K353R mutant of PLAG1, both band shifts were still present. In the case of the double mutant K244R/K263R, both shifts were not detectable. The content of the various lanes is described above the lanes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Direct reprobing of the Western blots with antibodies to SUMO to establish SUMOylation of PLAG1 revealed a big smear of the wide variety of SUMOylated proteins (data not shown), which could be anticipated on the basis of the wide-spread occurrence of SUMOylation in the cell. Therefore, and to independently confirm that PLAG1 physically interacts with SUMO-1-Myc in vivo, GST pull-down experiments were first performed with nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts of COS7 cells expressing GST-PLAG1 wild-type or one of its mutant forms (K244R, K263R, or K244R/K263R) together with SUMO-1-Myc as a purification step. Proteins interacting with GST-PLAG1 were subsequently size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and specific interaction with SUMO-1-Myc was revealed in Western blot analysis using anti-Myc antibodies. GS beads pulled down two polypeptides that were also recognized by the anti-Myc antibodies and only present in the nuclear extracts of cells in which GST-PLAG1 and SUMO-1-Myc were co-expressed (Fig. 4A). When the mutant form GST-PLAG1-K263R was expressed instead of the wild-type form, the fastest migrating of these two poly"

We have utilized the baculovirus-infected insect cell system to express Na,K-ATPase with α-subunits bearing either His6 or FLAG epitopes at the carboxyl terminus. Each of these constructs produced functional Na,K-ATPase αβ heterodimers that were delivered to the plasma membrane (PM). Cells were simultaneously co-infected with viruses encoding α-His/β and α-FLAG/β Na,K-ATPases. Co-immunoprecipitation of the His-tagged α-subunit in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and PM fractions of co-infected cells by the anti-FLAG antibody demonstrates that protein-protein associations exist between these heterodimers. This suggests the Na,K-ATPase is present in cell membranes in an oligomeric state of at least (αβ)2 composition. Deletion of 256 amino acid residues from the central cytoplasmic loop of the α-subunit results in the deletion α-4,5-loop-less (α-4,5LL), which associates with β but is confined to the ER. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrates that when this inactive α-4,5LL/β heterodimer is co-expressed with wild-type αβ, oligomers of wild-type αβ and α-4,5LL/β form in the ER, but the α-4,5LL mutant remains retained in the ER, and the wild-type protein is still delivered to the PM.

Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrates that when this inactive α-4,5LL/β heterodimer is co-expressed with wild-type αβ, oligomers of wild-type αβ and α-4,5LL/β form in the ER, but the α-4,5LL mutant remains retained in the ER, and the wild-type protein is still delivered to the PM. We conclude that the Na,K-ATPase is present as oligomers of the monomeric αβ heterodimer in native cell membranes. The Na,K-ATPase is the primary active transport system responsible for maintaining Na+ and K+ ion concentrations in almost all animal cells. It utilizes the energy of hydrolysis of the terminal phosphate bond of ATP to accomplish the coupled transport of Na+ and K+ ions against steep electrochemical gradients (1Kaplan J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 511-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). This enzyme along with its close mammalian homolog, the gastric H,K-ATPase, is unique among P2-type ATPases because it requires a β-subunit in addition to the catalytic α-subunit. The α-subunit is composed of about 1000 amino acids with 10 transmembrane segments and encodes all of the essential domains for ATP hydrolysis and ion transport. The β-subunit is a glycoprotein of around 300 amino acids with a single transmembrane segment and an intracellular amino terminus. Recent data from a number of systems has established that the β-subunit probably plays an influential role in the catalytic activity of the system (2Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 671: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 3Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H.

Biomembr. 2001; 33: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Although the heterodimeric state of the Na,K-ATPase is well established, the organization and possible higher order oligomerization of heterodimers in native membranes remains a controversial subject (1Kaplan J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 511-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 7Taniguchi K. Kaya S. Abe K. Mardh S. J. Biochem.

Elsevier Science, Amsterdam2000: 17-23Google Scholar). It has been claimed that the Na,K-ATPase αβ heterodimer in native membranes exists as an oligomer of multiple heterodimer units (7Taniguchi K.

The existence of these oligomers has been postulated to account for kinetic observations that are difficult to explain with a simple monomeric unit (11Taniguchi K. Kaya S. Yokoyama T. Abe K.

Other recently published work demonstrates that the major cytoplasmic loop between the M4 and M5 membrane segments associates in an ATP-dependent way when expressed in isolation (21Costa C.J. Gatto C. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9176-9184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Conversely, it has been claimed that the monomeric solubilized enzyme is capable of normal enzymatic activity (22Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Petersen J. Jorgensen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10511-10517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, cross-linking between α-subunits was not observed in cell membranes containing a low density of Na,K-ATPase molecules (23Martin D.W. Sachs J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23922-23929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or after detergent solubilization (24Ivanov A.V. Modyanov N.N. Askari A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), leading to the suggestion that higher order associations may only be a result of unusually high Na,K-ATPase densities in some enriched preparations. In the present work we have utilized the expression of recombinant Na,K-ATPase molecules in baculovirus-infected insect cells, where viruses contain the cDNA that encodes for α-subunits bearing either His6 or FLAG epitopes. Expressed in this system, the level of Na,K-ATPase has been estimated to reach up to 1–2% of the total membrane protein (5Gatto C. McLoud S.M. Kaplan J.H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: 982-992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We show that each of these epitope-tagged α-subunits expressed with wild-type β-subunits results in the synthesis and delivery of functional Na,K-ATPase αβ heterodimers to the PM of the insect cells. We show that co-infection of cells with both viruses and subsequent immunoprecipitation of either ER or PM fractions from infected insect cells by an anti-FLAG antibody results in co-immunoprecipitation of the α-subunit bearing the His6 epitope. We also show that co-expression of wild-type Na,K-ATPase heterodimers with non-functional heterodimers containing a deleted α-subunit, lacking most of the nucleotide binding and phosphorylation domains, produces oligomeric molecules. These data provide strong evidence for association of native αβ heterodimers in cell membranes. Plasmids and Construction of Mutants—The mutants were constructed by overlapping PCR extension mutagenesis using sheep α1 cDNA as a template. The His6 (HHHHHH) or FLAG (MDYKDDDD) epitope tag was inserted on the carboxyl terminus of the α1-subunit to create α-His and α-FLAG, respectively. The α-4,5-loop-less (α-4,5LL) mutant is a deletion (ΔAsp443-Val707) of the sheep α1 M4M5 loop. As a result of mutagenesis, a Glu residue was inserted at the junction of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions such that the M4M5 loop in the α-4,5LL sequence is M4-G442ET708-M5. Mutated α1 cDNA was sub-cloned in the pOCUS-2 vector (Novagen) and subsequently ligated into the pFBD (Invitrogen) vector in the multicloning site 2. The wild-type sheep β1-subunit cDNA was placed at multicloning site 1 in the same pFBD. The Bac to Bac system (Invitrogen) was used create recombinant baculovirus particles, each of which contain cDNA for α- and β-subunits under separate promoters (5Gatto C. McLoud S.M. Kaplan J.H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: 982-992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in the α1-subunits were confirmed by sequencing of DNA isolated from recombinant baculovirus using Easy-DNA kit (Invitrogen). Protein expression of the α-4,5LL mutant was also confirmed by its mobility in SDS-PAGE, visualized via Western blot analysis using the anti-KETYY antibody. Protein Expression and Isolation—Log-phase high viability (≥98% viability, determined by trypan blue exclusion) High Five cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus in the presence of 1% ethanol (v/v). The progress of each infection was monitored by recording the cell density and viability. Infections were harvested by centrifugation (500 × g, 10 min) between 3 and 5 days post-viral infection, when cells retained 60–75% viability. The harvested High Five cells were homogenized, whole cells were removed, and lysate was either ultracentrifuged to collect total membranes or separated on a five-step sucrose gradient into fractions enriched in ER, Golgi apparatus (G), or PM as previously described (5Gatto C. McLoud S.M. Kaplan J.H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: 982-992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane pellets were resuspended in HB (250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4) and stored on ice or at –20 °C for long term storage. Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard (25Hu Y.K. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19185-19191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). ATPase Activity—ATPase activity assay of isolated membranes was performed in triplicate for 30 min at 37 °C with 16 μg of membrane protein as previously described (25Hu Y.K. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19185-19191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Na,K-ATPase activity was determined as the difference in the amount of phosphate liberated in the presence and absence of 0.3 mm ouabain, expressed as μmol of Pi/mg of protein/h. Western Blot Analysis—Equal protein concentrations of ER-, G and PM-enriched fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 7.5 or 10% acrylamide/bisacrylamide gels in the presence of 0.75% β-mercaptoethanol, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blots were blocked and probed with anti-α1, anti-β1, anti-FLAG, anti-KETTY, anti-His6-HRP, or anti-hCTR1 antibody as previously described (4Laughery M.D. Todd M.L. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34794-34803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Goat anti-mouse HRP (Pierce #31430) or goat anti-rabbit HRP (Pierce #31460) secondary antibodies were used when appropriate. Chemiluminescent reagents (Pierce) were used for signal detection. Antibodies—The anti-KETYY antibody, which was raised in rabbit against the sheep α1 carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence 1111KETYY1116 (a gift from Dr. Jack Kyte, University of California, San Diego, CA), was used for both Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation. Likewise, the anti-α1 antibody (Affinity Bioreagents #MA3–929), which recognizes an epitope in the region of amino acid residues 496–506 in the M4M5 loop of the α1-subunit was used for both Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The anti-β1 antibody (Affinity Bioreagents #MA3–930) was used to detect the β1-subunit on Western blots. The anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma #F7425) was used for both Western and co-immunoprecipitation. The anti-His6 antibody (Affinity Bioreagents #PA1–983) was used for co-immunoprecipitation and anti-His6-HRP conjugate antibody (Qiagen #34460) was used for Western blot detection of the His6 tag. A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against an epitope in the carboxyl-terminal region of hCTR1 was used for Western blot detection of hCTR1. Protein Solubilization—Membrane preparations (500–1000 μg) were pelleted in a TLA 45 rotor at 45,000 rpm for 30 min. Pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (IPB) (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 mg/ml antipain, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 100 mg/ml l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, and 100 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with detergent. For subsequent immunoprecipitation of carboxyl-terminal-tagged α-subunits, 2% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) was used as the solubilizing detergent, as previously described (4Laughery M.D. Todd M.L. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34794-34803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Solubilization of the α-4,5LL construct required 1% Anagrade Fos-Choline-12 (Anatrace #F308). Initial suspensions were passed through a 28-gauge × 0.5-inch needle until homogenous and incubated at room temperature (∼25 °C) for 30 min. Suspensions were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min to remove insoluble material. In the absence of detergent, no α- or β-subunit was detected by Western blot in the supernatant after this centrifugation step. In the presence of detergent, a significant portion of each subunit was detectable in the supernatant. After solubilization, the supernatant was removed, and an aliquot (1 to 5%) used for Western blot analysis (S sample). The remaining soluble material (supernatant) was used for immunoprecipitation. The insoluble pellet was resuspended in 200 μlof IPB using a 28-gauge × 0.5-inch needle until homogenized, and an equal volume (1–5%) was subjected to Western blot analysis (IS sample). Co-immunoprecipitations—Supernatant from solubilization (∼200 μl: see above) was transferred to a fresh tube containing IPB and antibody (anti-FLAG, anti-His6, anti-α1, or anti-KETYY) for a total volume of 1 ml. Two sets of controls were done in parallel. Only soluble protein (no antibody) was added to one control, and only antibody (no protein) was included in the other control. The samples were incubated at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation overnight. Protein G-Sepharose beads (50–100 μl at 1:1 IPB) were added to all samples and incubated at 4 °C with rotation for 4 h. Beads were pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min, and supernatant was removed by aspiration. The beads were washed 3–5 times for 5 min with rotation at 4 °C in 1 ml of IPB followed by 500 × g for 5 min and the aspiration of supernatant. Precipitated protein was removed from the beads by incubation for 30 min to overnight at room temperature with 30 μlof4× SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 8% SDS, 0.75% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.0001% bromphenol blue). Beads were removed by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 5 min, then the supernatant was resolved on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and a Western blot analysis was performed. Trypsin Digestion—Membrane preparations in HB (see above) were supplemented with 20 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm ATP-Tris or no ligand. Volumes were adjusted such that the final protein concentration was 4 mg/ml after the addition of trypsin at 1 mg/ml. Digestion was stopped by the addition of denaturing sample buffer after 2 h at room temperature, and proteolyzed fragments were analyzed by Western blot analysis. In our initial experiment High Five cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus encoding the wild-type sheep β1-subunit and sheep α1-subunit bearing either the His6 or FLAG epitope tag at the carboxyl terminus (α-His/β or α-FLAG/β). Cells were harvested and Dounce-homogenized, and ER-, G-, and PM-enriched fractions were separated on a five-step sucrose gradient, as previously described (5Gatto C. McLoud S.M. Kaplan J.H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: 982-992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) Western blot analysis of the membrane fractions by the anti-α1 antibody confirms that, like the wild-type α-subunit, both tagged α-subunit constructs are delivered to the PM (Fig. 1A, top panel). Only the appropriately tagged constructs are detectable with the anti-FLAG and anti-His6-HRP antibodies, and there is no cross-reactivity (Fig. 1A, bottom panels). Fig. 1A also demonstrates the expression and trafficking of the β-subunit. Previous work in the baculovirus expression system has established that delivery of the α-subunit to the PM is dependent upon the heterodimeric assembly with the β-subunit (4Laughery M.D. Todd M.L. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34794-34803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 5Gatto C. McLoud S.M. Kaplan J.H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: 982-992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The appearance of the α-subunit in the PM fraction (Fig. 1A) demonstrates that αβ heterodimers containing these tagged α-subunits are sorted like wild-type protein and delivered to the PM of the cells. Fig. 1B shows the ouabain-sensitive ATPase activities in each of the membrane fractions of the tagged α-subunit construct expressions. These ATPase activities are comparable to the ATPase activities of wild-type protein with equivalent protein expression levels (data not shown). Likewise, the distribution of the Na,K-ATPase activity between the membrane fractions is the same as we have previously reported with the wild-type protein (4Laughery M.D. Todd M.L. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34794-34803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), in which the PM fraction contains the greater proportion of Na,K-ATPase activity. The data presented in Fig. 1 establish that attachment of the epitopes to the carboxyl terminus of the α-subunit has no detrimental effect on the normal αβ heterodimer synthesis, assembly, delivery to the PM, or activity of the Na,K-ATPase. Next, High Five cells were simultaneously infected with the α-FLAG/β and α-His/β baculoviruses. Each virus was at a concentration 1 order of magnitude higher than the cell density of the suspension. This level of each virus is sufficient to independently infect the entire population of cells. Co-infection for the purpose of simultaneously expressing Na,K-ATPase subunits in insect cells has been utilized previously (26DeTomaso A.W. Xie Z.J. Liu G. Mercer R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1470-1478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The top two panels of Fig. 2A show Western blot reactivity by both the anti-His6-HRP and anti-FLAG antibodies, confirming that both tagged α-subunits are present in the indicated membrane fractions. Likewise, the β-subunit is present in all fractions (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). Co-infection with the α-FLAG/β and α-His/β baculoviruses does not alter the level or cellular distribution of Na,K-ATPase activity (compare Fig. 1B and Fig. 2B). Fig. 2C demonstrates solubilization of the β-subunit in 2% DDM before co-immunoprecipitation. Note that a significant portion of the β-subunit is present in the supernatant. In the absence of detergent, the β-subunit is not observed in the supernatant fraction, indicating that the presence of detergent is necessary to separate the β-subunit from the membrane pellet (i.e. solubilized the β-subunit) under these conditions (data not shown). The lane in Fig. 2C marked S represents 5% of the solubilized fraction subsequently used as protein input for co-immunoprecipitation. Since the β-subunit expresses at a higher level than the α-subunit, a significant portion of the β-subunits are not assembled in heterodimers with α-subunits (4Laughery M.D. Todd M.L. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34794-34803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 5Gatto C. McLoud S.M. Kaplan J.H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: 982-992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, only a portion of this solubilized β-subunit is available for co-immunoprecipitation by antibodies against the α-subunit. Fig. 2D shows co-immunoprecipitation of the wild-type β-subunit by either the anti-His6 (fifth lane) or the anti-FLAG antibodies (fourth lane). It should be noted that in control immunoprecipitations lacking either precipitating antibody (first lane) or protein input (second and third lanes) we were unable to reproduce this immunoprecipitation, demonstrating the specificity of the co-immunoprecipitation. These results confirm that each of the tagged α-subunits assemble with the β-subunit as well as demonstrating that the anti-FLAG and anti-His6 antibodies are capable of immunoprecipitating the FLAG and His6-tagged α-subunits, respectively. Fig. 2D shows that the β-subunits which are co-immunoprecipitated the most efficiently with the α-subunit tend to be on the higher side of the molecular weight range for the β-subunit, indicating higher glycosylation and a more mature β-subunit. Since the immunoprecipitation efficiency of the anti-FLAG antibody appeared slightly higher than that of the anti-His6 antibody (compare Fig. 2D, fourth and fifth lanes), the ER and PM fractions of co-infected cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody. The immunoprecipitates were then probed with the anti-His6-HRP antibody to investigate the presence of oligomers containing both of the epitope tagged α-subunits. Before immunoprecipitation, membranes were solubilized in 2% DDM. Fig. 3A shows the Western blot analysis detecting the His6-tagged α-subunit from the ER and PM fractions before solubilization and in the soluble and insoluble fractions. Interestingly, Fig. 3A reveals that more of the Na,K-ATPase α-His6 subunit is solubilized from the PM fraction than from the ER fraction under these solubilization conditions. The soluble ER and PM fractions were used as input for the co-immunoprecipitation experiment in Fig. 3B. The anti-FLAG antibody was able to precipitate the α-His6 subunit from ER and PM membrane fractions, as indicated by Western blot detection of the immunoprecipitate with the anti-His6-HRP antibody (Fig. 3B, fourth and fifth lanes). Control precipitations lacking the anti-FLAG antibody confirm that the positive coimmunoprecipitation result is not due to nonspecific binding to beads (Fig. 3B, first and second lanes). Because there is no cross-reactivity between the epitope antibodies (Fig. 1A), this result indicates the α-FLAG subunits must be in stable association with α-His subunits in the DDM-solubilized ER and PM fractions. The results from Fig. 3, A and B, imply that higher order oligomerization of the Na,K-ATPase occurs. However, this is only true if the DDM solubilization liberates the α-tagged Na,K-ATPase from co-localization in membrane patches. If DDM solubilization does not separate the heterodimers from the membrane, the differently tagged subunits might be expected to co-immunoprecipitate whether or not protein-protein associations occurred due to their co-localization in membrane patches. To test the ability of DDM-solubilized membrane proteins to sufficiently disrupt non-associated membrane proteins, we performed an additional control experiment. Baculovirus-mediated co-expressions in High Five cells were carried out with the tagged α-subunits and the unrelated membrane protein, hCTR1. hCTR1 is the human copper transporter that has been functionally expressed recently in insect cells using the baculovirus system (27Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29162-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The hCTR1 protein does not specifically associate with the Na,K-ATPase, but it is delivered to the PM, like the Na,K-ATPase. Fig. 3C demonstrates the cellular localization by Western blot analysis of fractionated membranes co-expressing hCTR1 and either α-His/β or α-FLAG/β. Like wild-type Na,K-ATPase, hCTR1 is delivered to the PM. The complex pattern of bands seen with hCTR1 is due to glycosylation and the presence of some degradation products (18 kDa and below) of this protein (27Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29162-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Total membrane preparations of cells co-expressing hCTR1 with α-His/β or α-FLAG/β were subjected to the same 2% DDM solubilization protocol as used in Fig. 3, A and B. The first lane of each blot in Fig. 3D shows 2% of the soluble protein input for immunoprecipitation experiments. Due to preferential solubilization of higher glycosylated hCTR1, slightly altered gel conditions, and reduced levels of secondary antibody for Western blot detection, the hCTR1 signal in Fig. 3D appears tighter and of only the higher molecular species observed in Fig. 3C. Immunoprecipitation experiments in Fig. 3D (second lane of each blot) shows that neither the anti-FLAG nor the anti-His6 antibodies co-immunoprecipitated hCTR1 with the tagged Na,K-ATPase. Note that there is a protein G band present in all immunoprecipitation and control lanes that runs at a higher molecular mass (about 31 kDa) than hCTR1 (about 26 kDa). The control experiment presented in Fig. 3D demonstrates that solubilization in 2% DDM is sufficient to separate non-associated but co-localized membrane proteins. In summary, the data presented in Fig. 3 demonstrate the oligomeric association of the Na,K-ATPase αβ heterodimers after solubilization from membranes and the lack of association of the subunit with hCTR1. Recently published work has shown that the large cytoplasmic loop between the M4 and M5 transmembrane segments, when expressed in isolation, form oligomers in an ATP-dependent fashion (21Costa C.J. Gatto C. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9176-9184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This loop contains the phosphorylation and nucleotide binding domains (28Gatto C. Wang A.X. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2048323987,"Nuclear export of mRNA is mediated by interactions between soluble factors and nuclear pore complex (NPC) proteins. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Nab2 is an essential RNA-binding protein that shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. The mechanism for trafficking of Nab2-bound mRNA through the NPC has not been defined. Gle1 is also required for mRNA export, and Gle1 interactions with NPC proteins, the RNA helicase Dbp5, and Gfd1 have been reported. Here we report that Nab2, Gfd1, and Gle1 associate in a complex. By using immobilized recombinant Gfd1, Nab2 was isolated from total yeast lysate. A similar biochemical assay with immobilized recombinant Nab2 resulted in coisolation of Gfd1 and Gle1. A Nab2-Gfd1 complex was also identified by coimmunoprecipitation from yeast lysates. In vitro binding assays with recombinant proteins revealed a direct association between Nab2 and Gfd1, and two-hybrid assays delineated Gfd1 binding to the N-terminal Nab2 domain. This N-terminal Nab2 domain is distinct from its RNA binding domains suggesting Nab2 could bind Gfd1 and RNA simultaneously. As Nab2 export was blocked in a gle1 mutant at the restrictive temperature, we propose a model wherein Gfd1 serves as a bridging factor between Gle1 and Nab2-bound mRNA during export.

Trafficking of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm proceeds through portals known as nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). 1The abbreviations used are: NPC, nuclear pore complex; DTT, dithiothreitol; Gal4AD, Gal4 transcriptional activation domain; Gal4BD, Gal4 transcriptional binding domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; Kap, karyopherin; MBP, maltose-binding protein; Nup, nucleoporin; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; SC, synthetic complete; TAP-tagged, tandem affinity purification tagged; h, human. NPCs are embedded in a pore formed by the fusion of the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope. Yeast and vertebrate NPCs are highly conserved in architecture with a characteristic nuclear basket, 8-fold central spoke-ring structure that forms an aqueous channel, and cytoplasmic filaments (1Fahrenkrog B. Aebi U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Proteomic analysis has revealed that NPCs are composed of ∼30 distinct nucleoporins (Nups) (2Rout M.P.

Although diffusion accounts for the movement of small molecules, such as ions and metabolites, a facilitated, energy-dependent process mediates the rapid transport of larger molecules, such as proteins and mRNA (4Lei E.P. Silver P.A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 261-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Transport rates for macromolecules are estimated at ∼520–1000 molecules/s/NPC (5Ribbeck K. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 6Smith A.E. Slepchenko B.M. Schaff J.C. Loew L.M. Macara I.G. Science. 2002; 295: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Protein import and export pathways are mediated by karyopherins (Kaps), a family of shuttling transport factors (7Weis K. Cell. 2003; 112: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Kaps bind their cargo by recognition of a nuclear localization sequence for import or a nuclear export sequence for export (8Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Key steps in movement through the NPC include initial docking of the Kap-cargo complex, translocation through the aqueous channel, and release of the cargo (9Suntharalingam M. Wente S.R. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 775-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). These are presumably dictated by direct interactions between Kaps and Nups (10Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 11Bednenko J. Cingolani G. Gerace L. Traffic. 2003; 4: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The directionality of transport is regulated by the small GTPase Ran (10Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 12Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 89-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). High nuclear RanGTP levels are maintained by the compartmentalization of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor to the nucleus and the GTPase-activating protein to the cytoplasm. Thus, during import, high RanGTP levels facilitate release of cargo from the Kap in the nucleus. In contrast, during export, cargo binding to the Kap is enhanced in the nucleus, and release is triggered by RanGTP hydrolysis in the cytoplasm. Remarkable progress has also been made in the past decade toward identifying factors that play a role in mRNA export. Current models for mRNA export predict the existence of multiple steps at both the nuclear and cytoplasmic faces of the NPC. Recent studies also suggest that packaging the mRNA for export could start as early as transcription (reviewed in Refs. 4Lei E.P. Silver P.A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 261-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar and 13Reed R. Hurt E. Cell. 2002; 108: 523-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). During transcription and pre-mRNA processing, the RNA is bound by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). Some hnRNPs contain nuclear retention signals and are removed from the mRNA prior to export, whereas others shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (14Mili S. Shu H.J. Zhao Y. Pinol-Roma S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7307-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Nab2, Hrp1, and Npl3 are shuttling hnRNPs (15Anderson J.T. Wilson S.M. Datar K.V. Swanson M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2730-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 16Kessler M.M. Henry M.F. Shen E. Zhao J. Gross S. Silver P.A. Moore C.L.

Biol. 1994; 14: 8399-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Nab2 is imported into the nucleus by an interaction with Kap104 (18Lee D.C. Aitchison J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29031-29037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 19Aitchison J.D. Blobel G. Rout M.P. Science. 1996; 274: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Within the nucleus, Nab2 has roles linked to the Thp1 transcription complex, the regulation of pre-mRNA polyadenylation and mRNA processing, and mRNA export (20Hector R.E. Nykamp K.R. Dheur S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 6731-6740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The Nab2 export mechanism is dependent on the ubiquitin ligase Tom1 and the arginine methyltransferase Hmt1 (24Duncan K. Umen J.G. Guthrie C. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 687-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 25Green D.M. Marfatia K.A. Crafton E.B. Zhang X. Cheng X. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7752-7760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how ubiquitination and methylation affect the pathway. A recent report (26Green D.M. Johnson C.P. Hagan H. Corbett A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1010-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) shows that one export step involves Nab2 binding to Mlp1 on the nuclear face of the NPC. Movement through the NPC may require further interactions with Nups or NPC-associated factors. Because mRNA is tightly linked to hnRNPs, delineating the molecular pathways for mRNA export will require an understanding of the interplay between these mRNA-binding proteins and export factors. Many studies have focused on dissecting the role of budding yeast Mex67 (Tap/NXF1 in vertebrates) in mRNA export pathway. Mex67 forms a heterodimer with another export factor, Mtr2, binds the hnRNP-like factor Yra1, and interacts with FG (phenylalanine, glycine) repeats in several Nups (27Santos-Rosa H. Moreno H. Simos G. Segref A. Fahrenkrog B. Pante N. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6826-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 28Strasser K. Bassler J. Hurt E. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 6445-6452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Functional associations have also been established between Mex67 and the TREX complex through Yra1 and the splicing factor Sub2 (30Strasser K. Hurt E. Nature. 2001; 413: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 31Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Rondon A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E.

Biol. 2002; 22: 8241-8253Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Mex67, Yra1, and Sub2 have all been further linked to the SAGA histone acetylase complex (22Rodriguez-Navarro S. Fischer T.

Thus, Mex67 is a key player in connecting transcription and mRNA export. Other non-hnRNP factors with roles in mRNA export are Dbp5, Gle1, and Gle2/Rae1 (33Tseng S.S. Weaver P.L. Liu Y. Hitomi M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7411-7419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Dbp5 is a DEAD box RNA helicase that localizes to the cytoplasmic face of the NPC through an interaction with Nup159 (39Schmitt C. von Kobbe C. Bachi A. Pante N. Rodrigues J.P. Boscheron C. Rigaut G.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5778-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The unwindase activity could provide directionality and represent a terminal step in mRNA export. Recent work (41Estruch F. Cole C.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1664-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that Dbp5 also has a role in transcription. Gle2 is required for efficient mRNA export in yeast and has a docking site on Nup116 (37Murphy R. Watkins J.L. Wente S.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1921-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 42Ho A.K. Raczniak G.A. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Mol. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1107-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The role of Gle2/Rae1 in vertebrate cells is not clear because mouse embryo fibroblasts and blastocytes from knock out mice exhibit cell cycle defects but not mRNA export defects (44Babu J.R. Jeganathan K.B. Baker D.J. Wu X. Kang-Decker N. van Deursen J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 341-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). However, a complex of Gle2/Rae1, Nup98, and Mex67/Tap/NXF1 has been detected in vitro (45Blevins M.B. Smith A.M. Phillips E.M. Powers M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20979-20988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our objective has been to provide insight into Gle1-mediated mRNA export. In budding yeast, Gle1 localizes to NPCs at steady state, and gle1 mutants rapidly accumulate poly(A)+ RNA in the nucleus (36Murphy R. Wente S.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). GLE1 was initially identified in budding yeast by a synthetic lethal screen with a nup100Δ mutant (36Murphy R. Wente S.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and as a multicopy suppressor of a nup159/rat7 mutant (46Del Priore V. Snay C.A. Bahr A. Cole C.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1601-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Genetic and physical interactions have also been shown between Gle1 and Nup42/Rip1 (36Murphy R. Wente S.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 47Stutz F. Kantor J. Zhang D. McCarthy T. Neville M. Rosbash M.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5761-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Besides the interactions with Nups, Gle1 also binds Dbp5 and a novel factor Gfd1 (40Hodge C.A. Colot H.V. Stafford P. Cole C.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5778-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 48Strahm Y. Fahrenkrog B. Zenklusen D. Rychner E. Kantor J. Rosbach M. Stutz F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5761-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). GFD1 is a multicopy suppressor of gle1-8 and dbp5-2 mutants (40Hodge C.A. Colot H.V. Stafford P. Cole C.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5778-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 48Strahm Y. Fahrenkrog B. Zenklusen D. Rychner E. Kantor J. Rosbach M. Stutz F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5761-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Gfd1 localizes to the cytoplasm and nuclear rim and interacts with Gle1, Dbp5, and Nup42 by two-hybrid analysis (40Hodge C.A. Colot H.V. Stafford P. Cole C.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5778-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 48Strahm Y. Fahrenkrog B. Zenklusen D. Rychner E. Kantor J. Rosbach M. Stutz F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5761-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Precisely how Gfd1 plays a role in Gle1-mediated mRNA export has not been defined. Finally, the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the human (h) homolog hGle1 is required for mRNA export (49Kendirgi F. Barry D.M. Griffis E.R. Powers M.A. Wente S.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but it is unknown whether Gle1 shuttles in S. cerevisiae. Even though evidence exists for Gle1 having a role in mRNA export in S. cerevisiae and vertebrate cells, its connection to the cargo mRNA has not been delineated. To understand the Gle1-mRNA export pathway, we have focused here on the roles of Nab2 and Gfd1. Our studies demonstrate that Nab2 and Gfd1 associate in a complex both in vivo and in vitro. We find that the N-terminal domain of Nab2 interacts with Gfd1. Most interestingly, recent work (23Marfatia K.A. Crafton E.B. Green D.M. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6731-6740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) has shown that the N-terminal domain of Nab2 is required for poly(A)+ RNA export, and we observed a Nab2 export block in gle1-4 mutant cells. Overall, our results support a model wherein the recruitment of Gle1 to a Nab2 complex represents a step in the mRNA export pathway. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—All yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. The sequence encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused in-frame before the stop codon for the chromosomal GFD1 by using the gene integration method by Baudin et al. (50Baudin A.

PCR products were generated with oligonucleotides and a template containing sequences encoding GFP and the Schizosaccharomyces pombe HIS5 (pGFP-HIS5; kindly provided by J. Aitchison). The resulting DNA fragment was transformed into SWY518 by using the lithium acetate method, and colonies were selected on media lacking histidine. Correct integration was confirmed by immunoblotting with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies (kindly provided by M. Linder). The resulting strain was back-crossed twice, and the GFP-tagged progeny was used in this study.

Following centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and desalted in a Sephadex G-25 fine column. The lysate was supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20, 2 mm DTT, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). For recombinant protein, Escherichia coli cells with pGEX-5X (GST), pSW1296 (GST-Gfd1), or Nab2-pGEX2TK (Nab2-GST) were grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of 2× YT medium containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and 2% glucose to an A600 of 1.

Cells were resuspended in 30 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA containing PMSF and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and lysed in a French press. Following centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20. Aliquots of yeast and E. coli lysates were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –70 °C. For the binding assay, E. coli extracts were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 20 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 150 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm DTT, 0.1% Tween 20), two times with binding buffer containing 0.1 mm ATP, and two times with binding buffer containing 1 m NaCl. The beads were incubated with 1 ml of yeast lysate or binding buffer alone for2hat4 °C and then washed six times with binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with 100 μlof1 m NaCl followed by boiling in SDS sample buffer or eluted directly by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Proteins eluted with 1 m NaCl were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid/sodium deoxycholate. Blots were probed with monoclonal anti-Nab2 antibodies (kindly provided by J. Aitchison) diluted 1:4000, rabbit polyclonal anti-Gle1 antibodies diluted 1:200, or rabbit anti-Gfd1 peptide antibodies diluted 1:200 (overnight, 4 °C). Bound proteins were detected using peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG (1h, 23 °C) and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) for anti-Nab2 and anti-Gfd1 or SuperSignal West Femto chemiluminescence (Pierce) for anti-Gle1. Antibodies—MBP-Gle1 was expressed and purified as described previously (37Murphy R. Watkins J.L. Wente S.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1921-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The antigen was sent to Cocalico Biologicals for production of rabbit antiserum WU851. Antiserum to Gle1 was purified by affinity chromatography over a GST-Gle1 Affi-Gel 10 column (Bio-Rad) as described previously (37Murphy R. Watkins J.L. Wente S.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1921-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Anti-Gfd1 peptide antibodies (Gfd1D/1) were generated by Bethyl Laboratories. Bethyl Laboratories synthesized the peptides Gfd1D9R25 (CDAPDEEPIKKQKPSHKR) and Gfd1K85K101 (CKISPVSESLAINPFSQK) for production of rabbit antiserum and purified the antiserum against the Gfd1D9R25 peptide. Immunoprecipitation—Cultures of SWY518 (Gfd1) and SWY2535 (Gfd1-GFP) were grown to an A600 of ∼0.5 in rich medium (YPD; 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose). Whole cell lysates were prepared by glass bead lysis in 20 mm Tris, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2% Triton X-100 supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture and 1 mm PMSF. Immunoprecipitations were conducted as described previously (53Ho A.K. Shen T.X. Ryan K.J. Kiseleva E. Levy M.A. Allen T.D. Wente S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5736-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μl of anti-GFP antibody was mixed with 200 μl of cell extract and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 1.5hat4 °C. The beads were washed six times with 50 mm Tris, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 before elution. Blots were probed with anti-Nab2 monoclonal antibodies at a 1:3000 dilution (overnight, 4 °C) and peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1 h, 23 °C). The blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Purification of Protein and Soluble Binding Assay—E. coli strains containing pGEX-5X (GST) or pSW1296 (GST-Gfd1) were grown in 1 liter of LB media containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and 2% glucose at 37 °C. When the A600 was ∼1, cultures were induced for 3 h with 0.3 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cell pellets were frozen at –70 °C. Thawed pellets were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture and 0.1 mm PMSF and lysed in a French press. The suspension was centrifuged at 9000 × g for 30 min, and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%. The supernatant was diluted in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose resin for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing the resin with 10 ml of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 25 ml of lysis buffer, the beads were packed into a column. The column was washed with lysis buffer until the A280 of the flow-through was ∼0. The protein was eluted in 50 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 10 mm glutathione. MBP and MBP-Nab2 were purified as described above with the following modifications. The lysis buffer was 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 30 mm NaCl, 0.25% Tween 20, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol supplemented with PMSF and complete protease inhibitor mixture. Following lysis, NaCl was added to a final concentration of 0.5 m. The supernatant was incubated with amylose resin (New England Biolabs) overnight at 4 °C. After washing with 25 ml of column buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol containing 0.25% Tween 20), the resin was packed in a column and washed with column buffer until the A280 of the flow-through was ∼0. The bound protein was eluted with column buffer containing 10 mm maltose. MBP-Gle2 (kindly provided by L. Strawn) was purified as described previously (29Strawn L.A. Shen T. Wente S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6445-6452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were dialyzed into 20 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 150 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol. Binding assays were conducted as described previously with 5 μg of proteins in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 150 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% casamino acids). Bound and unbound fractions were separated on SDS polyacrylamide gels and detected by Coomassie staining. Fluorescence Microscopy—Plasmids expressing Nab2-GFP or Nab2ΔRGG-GFP were transformed into wild type (SWY518), gle1-4 (SWY1191) or gfd1Δ cells by standard techniques. Stationary cultures grown in SC media lacking uracil (–ura) were diluted and grown overnight at 23 °C to early log phase. Half the culture was maintained at 23 °C and the other half shifted to 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were then labeled with Hoechst 33258 at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml, washed once in SC–ura, and viewed by direct fluorescence microscopy. Images were collected with a 100× objective on an Olympus BX50 microscope using a Photometric CoolSNAP HQ camera (Roper Scientific) and MetaVue software.

https://openalex.org/W2074688575,"Recently, we identified Insulinoma–Glucagonoma clone 20 (IG20) that can render cells more susceptible to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced apoptosis. In addition, it can slow cell proliferation, and enhance drug- and radiation-induced cell death. TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) can selectively induce apoptosis in some cancer cells and render others susceptible to cotreatment with drugs and irradiation, with little or no effect on most normal cells. In this study, we investigated the potential of IG20 to enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis and found that it can render cells more susceptible to TRAIL treatment through enhanced activation of caspases. Further, we showed that this effect can be suppressed by caspase inhibitors, p35 and CrmA, and a dominant-negative Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (DN-FADD). Results from colocalization and immunoprecipitation studies showed that IG20 can interact with TRAIL death receptors (DR), DR4 and DR5 and increase recruitment of FADD and caspase-8 into the TRAIL death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). These results indicate that IG20 is a novel protein that can enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis by facilitating DISC formation."
https://openalex.org/W2035485568,"USF and c-Myc are basic helix–loop–helix transcription factors with similar DNA-binding specificities, but antagonistic effects on cellular transformation. In order to determine how these opposite functions correlate with the transcriptional activities of the two factors on particular downstream targets, we investigated the roles of USF and c-Myc in expression of CDK4, a known direct target of c-Myc. Overexpression of either c-Myc or USF2, but not USF1, stimulated the expression of CDK4 promoter-driven reporter genes in the non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells. Dominant-negative mutants specific to either Myc or USF family proteins inhibited reporter gene activity as well as endogenous CDK4 expression, demonstrating involvement of both USF and Myc in CDK4 transcriptional control. In contrast, in two different breast cancer cell lines where USF is transcriptionally inactive and c-Myc is overexpressed, CDK4 promoter activity was no longer responsive to either transcription factor. Accordingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed significantly lower levels of both USF and c-Myc bound to the endogenous CDK4 promoter in breast cancer cells than in MCF-10A cells, with a concomitant decrease in associated histone H3 acetylation. These results suggest that a major switch in the transcriptional control of CDK4 occurs during breast carcinogenesis, with likely alteration of cell cycle regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2052236466,"Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies indicate that genetic alterations of chromosome 9p occur in numerous tumor types, suggesting the presence of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) on chromosome 9p critical in carcinogenesis. Our previous LOH analyses in primary lung tumors led us to propose that chromosome 9p harbors other TSGs important in lung tumorigenesis. In this study, 30 non-small-cell lung cancer and 12 small-cell lung cancer cell lines were screened with 55 markers to identify new regions of homozygous deletion (HD) on chromosome 9p. Three novel noncontiguous homozygously deleted regions were detected and ranged in size from 840 kb to 7.4 Mb. One gene identified in the deletion at D9S126, TUSC1 (tumor suppressor candidate 1), is an intronless gene. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot confirmed the HD of TUSC1. Northern blot analysis of TUSC1 demonstrated two transcripts of approximately 2 and 1.5 kb that are likely generated by alternative polyadenylation signals. Both transcripts are expressed in several human tissues and share an open-reading frame encoding a peptide of 209 amino acids. Analysing cell line cDNAs by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR demonstrated downregulation of TUSC1 in cell lines with or without HDs, suggesting that TUSC1 may play a role in lung tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2156121164,"LAP2α is a LEM family protein associated with nucleoplasmic A-type lamins and chromatin in interphase. Like lamins and other lamina proteins LAP2α is cytoplasmic in metaphase, but it associates with chromosomes prior to nuclear envelope formation in late anaphase to telophase. In vitro phosphorylation analysis and mass spectrometry identified a cluster of at least three mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase 1 phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal chromatin-binding region of LAP2α as well as four additional potential sites in the cluster, some of which were targeted alternatively in LAP2α mutated at the major sites. LAP2α mutants containing serine → alanine mutations at all seven sites revealed a clear phenotype. Mutated LAP2α remained associated with chromosomes throughout mitosis, but the dissociation of lamins into the cytoplasm and nuclear envelope disassembly were not affected. These data demonstrate the in vivo significance of mitotic phosphorylation for the dynamic behavior of LAP2α in the cell cycle and show that, unlike the interaction with lamins, the chromatin association of LAP2α is regulated by multiple mitosis-specific phosphorylation at sites clustered within a defined region in the C terminus of the protein.

Thus, LAP2 isoforms interact with chromatin at the nuclear envelope and in the nucleoplasm and may regulate higher order chromatin structure.

McKeon F. Cell. 1990; 61: 579-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Lamin-binding proteins, such as LAP2β and LAP2α, are also phosphorylated in mitosis (18Foisner R.

However, unlike for lamins, the role of mitosis-specific phosphorylation of lamin-binding proteins for their cell cycle-dependent dynamics has never been demonstrated in vivo. LAP2α showed a particularly intriguing dynamic behavior in the cell cycle. Like lamins and LAP2β, LAP2α was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm in metaphase cells, but associated with chromosomes early during nuclear reassembly, prior to accumulation of LAP2β and assembly of membranes (18Foisner R.

While the LEM and LEM-like motifs in the LAP2α N terminus were dispensable for the LAP2α-chromosome interaction, a chromatin-binding region in the unique C-terminal domain was found to be essential and sufficient for interaction (36Vlcek S.

Foisner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18898-18907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting that LAP2α relocalization to chromosomes is essential for proper nuclear assembly. In this study we focused on identifying molecular regulatory mechanisms, controlling the association of LAP2α with chromosomes. We identify three major mitosis-specific phosphorylation sites clustered in the core of the chromatin-binding region as well as four potential sites in the cluster. We further show that eliminating LAP2α phosphorylation by mutating serines to alanines at major and potential target sites renders the protein incapable of dissociating from chromosomes in mitosis. These studies demonstrate for the first time the in vivo significance of phosphorylation of a lamin-binding protein for its redistribution during mitosis and show that chromosome association, unlike its interaction with lamins, is regulated by phosphorylation of LAP2α.

The following pairs of oligonucleotide primers were used: 5′-GGTCTCTACTGCAGCTGCTCCTTCACTGATTAAAG-3′and 5′-CTTTAATCAGTGAAGGAGCAGCTGCAGTAGAGACC-3′ to replace serine 309; 5′-GTCCTGAGAGGGCCCATATTTCAGATCAATCGCC-3′and 5′-GGCGATTGATCTGAAATATGGGCCCTCCTCAGGA-3′ to replace serine 344; 5′-CCATATTTCAGATCAAGCGCTTCTCTCCAGTAAAAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTTTTACTGGAGAGAGGCGCTTGATCTGAAATATGG-3′ to replace serine 350; 5′-GGAAAGCACTAGAAGAGGCTGAGAGCTCACAAC-3′ and 5′-GTTGTGAGCTCTCAGCCTCTTCTAGTGCTTTCC-3′ to replace serine 362; 5′-GAGCTCACAACTAATTGCTCCGCCACTTGCCCAG-3′and 5′-CTGGGCAAGTGGCGGAGCAATTAGTTGTGAGCT-3′ to replace serine 369; 5′-GTTTCAAGAAACTGAATTCCTGGCTCCTCCAAGAAAAGTCCC-3′ and 5′-GGGACTTTTCTTGGAGGAGCCAGGAATTCAGTTTCTTGAAAC-3′ to replace serine 423; 5′-GGAAAGGGATTCAGGTGCCTTTGTGGCATTTCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGAAATGCCACAAAGGCACCTGAATCCCTTTCC-3′ to replace serine 443. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. For bacterial expression of mutated proteins, the respective cDNAs were subcloned from pTD15 derivatives into the bacterial expression vector pET-23a(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI) via NheI-XhoI. Cell Culture and Transfections—HeLa, HeLa Tet-on (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA), and CHO cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 8.5% CO2. Culture media for HeLa Tet-on cells were supplemented with 100 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), for transfected stable HeLa Tet-on clones with additional 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Applied Science). For induction of protein expression, 2 μg/ml doxycyclin (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH) were added to the medium for at least 24 h. Transfections were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent, Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), and DNA prepared with a Jet Star plasmid kit (Genomed, Bad Oeynhausen, Germany). Transient transfections were done in Falcon 4 chamber tissue culture glass slides (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) for 4 h in transfection reagent containing 0.6 μg of DNA per chamber. For stable transfections, 5 × 105 HeLa Tet-on cells in 6-cm culture dishes were co-transfected with 0.4 μg of pTK-Hyg selection vector (Clontech Laboratories) and 6 μg of response plasmid. After 48 h of culture in complete medium, cells were split into ten 10-cm culture dishes and cultured in medium containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin B for 14 days. Single clones were transferred into 24-well plates and grown in the presence or absence of doxycyclin. Chromosome Spreads—Mitotic cells harvested from an unsynchronized cell culture were incubated in 0.075 mm KCl for 20 min at room temperature and lysed by addition of 0.1% Tween 20. Samples were spun onto coverslips at 2,000 rpm for 3 min in a Cytospin 2 (Thermo Shandon, Pittsburgh PA), fixed in 2% formaldehyde for 10 min, and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed in 2 or 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min at room temperature, incubated with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min each. After incubation in PBS/0.2% gelatin for 30 min, primary and secondary antibodies were applied in PBS for 1 h each. Primary antibodies used were monoclonal antibodies to LAP2α, and LAP2β (27Dechat T. Gotzmann J. Stockinger A. Harris C.A. Talle M.A. Siekierka J.J. Foisner R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4887-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), antiserum to LAP2α (37Vlcek S. Korbei B. Foisner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18898-18907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), monoclonal Myc 1–9E10.2 antibody (American Type Culture Collection CRL-1729), monoclonal lamin A antibody (133A2, abcam, Cambridge, UK). Secondary antibodies used were affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa 488 or Texas Red (Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories, West Grove, PA). DNA was stained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst dye 33258 applied together with the secondary antibody. Samples were mounted in Mowiol and viewed in a Zeiss Axiovert 100M equipped with either a LSM 510 confocal microscope or an Axiocam. Protein Expression in Bacteria and in Vitro Phosphorylation—For bacterial protein expression Escherichia coli strain BL21 was transformed with pET-23a(+) (Novagen)-derived plasmids. Bacteria were grown in 100 ml of LB medium plus 100 μg/ml ampicillin until an OD600 of 0.6–0.8, and protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. Bacteria were lysed in 5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm MgCl2) for 30 min at 37 °C, and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 30 min. Pellets were resuspended in urea buffer (7 m urea, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, and 1 mm DTT) and stored frozen at -20 °C. For in vitro phosphorylation, samples were dialyzed into buffer A (50 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl2, and 0.1 mm DTT). 80-μl samples were mixed with a 10-μl interphase or mitotic CHO cell extract or immunoprecipitated cdk1 (38Foisner R. Malecz N. Dressel N. Stadler C. Wiche G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 273-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and 10 μl of an ATP/[γ-32P]ATP mixture (1 μCi for 50 μl of a 1 mm ATP solution), incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, mixed with 3× SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The following inhibitors were used: olomoucine (84 μm, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA); staurosporine (0.2 μm, Sigma); H7 (0.3 mm, Calbiochem); EDTA (10 mm, Sigma). Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping was done according to Boyle et al. (39Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar) with slight modifications (38Foisner R. Malecz N. Dressel N. Stadler C. Wiche G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 273-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of LAP2α and Mass Spectrometry—Mitotic or interphase cells (38Foisner R. Malecz N. Dressel N. Stadler C. Wiche G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 273-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) were lysed in 500 μl of buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.4% SDS and pressed through a 27-gauge needle to shear DNA. Buffer A was added to reduce SDS concentration to 0.1%, and lysates were precleared by incubation with 20 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) and brief centrifugation. 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads, preincubated in 100 μl of hybridoma supernatant containing antibody to LAP2α or to the Myc tag, were added and harvested by centrifugation following a 2-h incubation. The beads were washed five times in buffer A and proteins separated by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie-stained LAP2α bands were cut out from gels and digested as described elsewhere (40Durauer A. Csaszar E. Mechtler K. Jungbauer A. Schmid E. J. Chromatogr. A. 2000; 890: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). High quality water for the in-gel digestion and the mass spectrometric experiments was prepared using an ELGA Maxima water purification system (Vivendy Water Systems, High Wycombe, Bucks, UK). Ammonium hydrogen carbonate was obtained from FLUKA (Sigma-Aldrich), DTT for the reduction of proteins before in-gel digestion was purchased from Roche Applied Science, iodoacetamide was supplied by Sigma, and trypsin was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Tryptic peptides were extracted by 5% formic acid, purified, and concentrated. The chromatographic media used was Poros 20 R2 (PerSeptive Biosystems, Foster City, CA) filled into the non-coated nanospray capillaries of Protana (Proxeon Biosystems A/S; Odense, Denmark). Hydrophilic peptides were captured by Poros Oligo material (PerSeptive Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Concentrated peptides were eluted with a mixture of 50% methanol, 5% formic acid directly into a metal-plated silica capillary (Proxeon Biosystems A/S; Odense, Denmark). The measurements were carried out on a QSTAR (Applied Biosystems; Foster City, CA) hybrid mass spectrometer. The instrument was externally calibrated with the MS/MS fragments of a synthetic peptide (ALILTLVS). First a peptide spectrum was obtained, and the charge state of the peptides was determined. Doubly or triply charged peptides were chosen for MS/MS experiments. Fragment ions were labeled according to the nomenclature proposed by Roepstorff and Fohlman (41Roepstorff P. Fohlman J. Biomed. Mass Spectrom. 1984; 11: 601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2389) Google Scholar). MS/MS spectra were interpreted with the aid of the Mascot (Matrix Science Ltd, London, UK) search engine. Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis, Transfer, and Detection—SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). For autoradiography gels were dried and exposed to an x-ray film. For immunoblotting, proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose (0.2 μm; Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel, Germany) in 48 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.4, 39 mm glycine using the Mini Transblot system (Bio-Rad). Primary antibodies used were: hybridoma supernatants of anti-LAP2 antibodies (27Dechat T. Gotzmann J. Stockinger A. Harris C.A. Talle M.A. Siekierka J.J. Foisner R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4887-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), monoclonal Myc 9E10 antibody (ATCC), polyclonal LAP2α antibody 245-2 (diluted 1:10,000; Ref. 37Vlcek S. Korbei B. Foisner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18898-18907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); secondary antibodies, alkaline phosphatase- or peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies against the primary antibodies (diluted 1:7,500). For detection of proteins, the Proto-blot immunoscreening system (Promega) or the Super Signal ECL (Pierce) were used. LAP2α Is Differentially Phosphorylated by Interphase and Mitotic Kinases in Vitro—We have previously shown that LAP2α isolated from metaphase cells had a slightly reduced mobility on SDS-PAGE as compared with LAP2α from interphase cells. Furthermore, isoelectric focusing revealed a more acidic pI of mitotic versus interphase LAP2α (27Dechat T. Gotzmann J. Stockinger A. Harris C.A. Talle M.A. Siekierka J.J. Foisner R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4887-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As these properties were consistent with a mitosis-specific phosphorylation of LAP2α, we set out to test this possibility by various means. First, we performed in vitro phosphorylation assays using bacterially expressed, recombinant LAP2α as substrate, or histone H1 as a control, and mitotic or interphase cell extracts as a source for kinases. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 1A) and specific protein phosphorylation (cpm per microgram of protein, Fig. 1B) was determined. Extracts of nocodazole-arrested metaphase cells phosphorylated both LAP2α and histone H1 to a 3–4-fold higher extent than interphase extracts. Endogenous LAP2α present in cell extracts was highly diluted and not detectable in these assays (data not shown). Three potent kinase inhibitors, olomoucine, staurosporine, and H7, which affect predominantly cdk-type kinases, protein kinase C, and a broad range of different kinases, respectively, reduced in vitro phosphorylation significantly, while the calcium chelator EDTA blocked kinase activity completely. Interestingly, unlike EDTA, none of the inhibitors significantly affected interphase kinase activity toward LAP2α. Thus, we concluded that LAP2α is primarily phosphorylated by mitotic kinases. cdk1 Phosphorylates LAP2α at Mitosis-specific Site(s) in Vitro—The sensitivity of mitotic LAP2α kinase activity to olomoucine suggested an involvement of mitosis-specific kinase cdk1. To test this hypothesis, we immunoprecipitated cdk1 from nocodazole-arrested metaphase cells using an antiserum generated against a synthetic peptide representing the C terminus of human cdk1 (43Malecz N. Foisner R. Stadler C. Wiche G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8203-8208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and performed in vitro phosphorylation assays. Recombinant LAP2α (Fig. 2, A and B) and histone H1 (not shown) were significantly phosphorylated by cdk1 in vitro.Fig. 2LAP2α C terminus is phosphorylated by cdk1. Recombinant LAP2α fragments shown in A were incubated with immunoprecipitated cdk1 as shown in B. C, cdk1, mitotic, or interphase extract as indicated. D, with mitotic extract. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/autoradiography (B) or by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping (C and D). Arrows in peptide maps show mitotic, cdk1-dependent spot; arrowheads, a spot present in interphase and mitotic samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To demonstrate that cdk1 also represented a major kinase activity for LAP2α in whole mitotic cell lysates, we performed two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of in vitro phosphorylated LAP2α. The phosphopeptide analysis of LAP2α phosphorylated by whole mitotic cell lysate yielded several strongly labeled spots (Fig. 2C), indicating targeting of various phosphorylation sites during mitosis. Most of the phosphopeptides generated from LAP2α phosphorylated by interphase extracts were only weakly labeled, and interphase and mitotic peptide patterns were clearly different. While only one spot was detected in both mitotic and interphase samples (Fig. 2C, arrowhead), two of three major mitotic peptides were exclusively detected in mitotic samples, indicating mitosis-specific phosphorylation. Interestingly, one of these mitosis-specific peptides was also detected in phosphopeptide maps of LAP2α phosphorylated by immunoprecipitated cdk1 (arrow). Thus, the major phosphorylation sites in LAP2α were predominantly or exclusively targeted in mitosis and involve cdk1 as well as other kinases. To narrow down the cdk1-dependent, mitosis-specific target site in LAP2α, we expressed LAP2α fragments covering different domains of the protein in bacteria and tested their in vitro phosphorylation by immunoprecipitated cdk1 (Fig. 2B) or mitotic extracts (Fig. 2D) using SDS-PAGE/autoradiography and two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping, respectively. While the LAP2α-specific C-terminal region (amino acids 188–693) was phosphorylated as efficiently as full-length protein (amino acids 1–693) and produced the mitotic, cdk1-dependent spot in phosphopeptide maps (Fig. 2D, arrow), the constant N terminus (amino acids 1–187) was not phosphorylated to a considerable extent. Similarly, LAP2α-(1–264) was not phosphorylated by cdk1 and LAP2-(1–414) only weakly, while LAP2α-(410–693) was strongly labeled. Correspondingly, the cdk1-dependent spot was not detected in peptide maps of LAP2α-(1–414), but was clearly present in C-terminal truncation mutants (1–615). Altogether, these data narrowed down the cdk1 target site to a region between amino acids 410 and 615. Strikingly this region overlapped with a domain in LAP2α that has previously been found to mediate the association with chromatin during nuclear reassembly (36Vlcek S. Just H. Dechat T. Foisner R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6370-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Serine 423 Is the Main cdk1-dependent Phosphorylation Site in Vitro—Searching for minimal cdk1-consensus phosphorylation sites in the LAP2α primary sequence, serine/threonine followed by proline (44Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), revealed two potential targets between LAP2α amino acids 410 and 615, serine 423 and threonine 547, the former being an optimal consensus site with a basic residue at position +2 ((S/T)PX(K/R)) (Fig. 3). Thus, we hypothesized that serine 423 may be the predominant cdk1-dependent invitro phosphorylation site in LAP2α. To confirm this hypothesis, we exchanged serine 423 with an alanine by site-directed mutagenesis and tested the in vitro phosphorylation of LAP2α S423A mutant by mitotic extract. The specific phosp"
https://openalex.org/W2074797887,"One common characteristic of breast cancers arising in carriers of the predisposition gene BRCA1 is a loss of expression of the CDK inhibitor p27(Kip1) (p27), suggesting that p27 interacts epistatically with BRCA1. To investigate this relationship, we examined expression of p27 in mice expressing a dominant negative allele of Brca1 (MMTV-trBr) in the mammary gland. While these mice rarely develop tumors, they showed a 50% increase in p27 protein and a delay in mammary gland development associated with reduced proliferation. In contrast, on a p27 heterozygote background, MMTV-trBrca1 mice showed an increase in S phase cells, and normal mammary development. p27 was the only protein in the cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase network to show altered expression, suggesting that it may be a central mediator of cell cycle arrest in response to loss of function of BRCA1. Furthermore, in human mammary epithelial MCF7 cells expressing BRCA1-specific RNAi and in the BRCA1-deficient human tumor cell line HCC1937, p27 is elevated at the mRNA level compared to cells expressing wild-type BRCA1. We hypothesize that disruption of BRCA1 induces an increase in p27 that inhibits proliferation. Accordingly, reduction in p27 expression leads to enhancement of cellular proliferation in the absence of BRCA1."
https://openalex.org/W2069881514,"Members of the Cbl family of ubiquitin ligases have emerged as crucial negative regulators of tyrosine kinase signaling. These proteins preferentially interact with and target activated tyrosine kinases for ubiquitinylation, thereby facilitating the lysosomal sorting of receptor tyrosine kinases or proteasomal degradation of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. Recent work has indicated a crucial role of the target kinase activity in Cbl-dependent ubiquitinylation and degradation, but the biochemical basis for this requirement is not understood. Here, we have used the Src-family kinase Fyn, a well characterized Cbl target, to address this issue. Using defined Fyn mutants, we demonstrate that the kinase activity of Fyn is crucial for its Cbl-dependent ubiquitinylation and degradation, but a low level of ubiquitinylation and degradation of kinase-inactive Fyn mutants was consistently observed. Mutational induction of an open conformation enhanced the susceptibility of kinase-active Fyn to Cbl but was insufficient to promote the ubiquitinylation and degradation of kinase-inactive Fyn. Notably, the Cbl-dependent degradation of Fyn did not require the Fyn-mediated phosphorylation of Cbl. Finally, we show that the major determinant of the susceptibility of Fyn protein to Cbl-dependent ubiquitinylation and degradation is the extent to which it physically associates with Cbl; kinase activity of Fyn serves as a critical determinant to promote its association with Cbl, which we demonstrate is mediated by multiple protein-protein interactions. Our results strongly suggest that promotion of association with Cbl is the primary mechanism by which the kinase activity of the targets of Cbl contributes to their susceptibility to Cbl.

Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar), and their deficiencies, either individually or in combination with additional family members, produce severe developmental and/or adult organ dysfunctions (3Stein P.L.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the mechanisms of their function and regulation is of great biological interest. As the first family of PTKs identified, SFKs have also served as an eminent model to understand the mechanisms of PTK regulation in general. SFKs exhibit a conserved domain structure: a membrane-anchoring N-terminal myristoylation signal, adjacent Src homology 3 (SH3) and SH2 domains, a kinase domain, and a tyrosine residue near the C-terminal tail whose phosphorylation by the C-terminal Src kinase is crucial to repress the enzymatic activity (1Chow L.M. Veillette A. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 207-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 2Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the kinase and regulatory domains of several SFKs, together with extensive mutational analyses, have defined the molecular basis of SFK repression and suggested plausible mechanisms of activation (6Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar, 7Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J.

Intramolecular SH3 domain binding to a type II polyproline-like helix within the SH2-kinase linker region and the SH2 domain binding to a C-terminal phosphotyrosine residue force the kinase-active cleft into an inactive conformation and concurrently shield the SH2 and SH3 domains from intermolecular interactions with signaling intermediates (6Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar, 7Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Activation signals are thought to release the SH2 and SH3 domains from their intramolecular ligands, promoting the open, active conformation of the kinase domain and allowing the SH2 and SH3 domain-mediated assembly of signaling complexes (6Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar, 7Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Indeed, inactivating point mutations in the SFK SH3 or SH2 domains, deletion or substitution of the negative regulatory tyrosine, deletion of the C-terminal Src kinase gene (which mediates the phosphorylation of the C-terminal tyrosine), mutations in the SH2-kinase linker that abolish its binding to SH3 domain, or overexpression of high affinity SH3 domain ligands leads to constitutive activation of SFKs (2Thomas S.M.

Conversely, mutational increase in the affinity of the C-terminal phosphotyrosine motif for the SH2 domain reduced the kinase activity of a SFK (14Porter M. Schindler T. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2721-2726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, it is evident that multiple mechanisms must exist inside a cell to precisely regulate the activity of SFKs. It is not clear at present how the activated SFKs are returned to their basal repressed conformation. A fundamental mechanism to reverse the PTK activation is through the activity of phosphotyrosine phopsphatases (15Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 16Su J. Muranjan M. Sap J. Curr.

Invest. 2002; 109: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, given the clear evidence that SFKs require cellular chaperones, such as the members of HSP90 family, for postsynthetic maturation (18Xu Y. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the case of RTKs, such as EGFR, a secondary mechanism of Cbl recruitment is provided by adaptor molecules, such as Grb2; Grb2 SH3 domain binds to the proline-rich region of Cbl, whereas its SH2 domain binds to the autophosphorylated EGFR (54Waterman H.

The nature of molecular interactions that mediate Cbl-dependent ubiquitinylation of SFKs is more complex, and the relative roles of the various intermolecular interactions are less well defined. A prominent mechanism of Cbl-SFK association involves the SFK SH3 domain binding to proline-rich sequences in Cbl (21Andoniou C.E. Lill N.L. Thien C.B. Lupher Jr., M.L. Ota S. Bowtell D.D. Scaife R.M. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 851-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 23Rao N. Ghosh A.K. Zhou P. Douillard P. Andoniou C.E. Band H. Signal Transduct. 2002; 1: 29-39Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the SH2 domains of SFKs can interact with phosphopeptide motifs in the C-terminal half of Cbl (63Tsygankov A.Y. Mahajan S. Fincke J.E. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27130-27137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 64Hunter S. Burton E.A. Wu S.C. Anderson S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2097-2106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Finally, the Cbl TKB domain can directly interact with activated SFKs, apparently by binding to the phosphorylated activation loop (21Andoniou C.E. Lill N.L. Thien C.B. Lupher Jr., M.L. Ota S. Bowtell D.D. Scaife R.M. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 851-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 65Sanjay A. Houghton A. Neff L. DiDomenico E. Bardelay C. Antoine E. Levy J. Gailit J. Bowtell D. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Consistent with these complex intermolecular interactions, a TKB domain mutant of Cbl was fully capable of inducing the degradation of the SFK Fyn, and abrogation of Fyn SH3 domain binding to the proline-rich region of Cbl, in addition to a Cbl TKB mutation, was required to effectively block the effect of Cbl on Fyn (21Andoniou C.E. Lill N.L. Thien C.B. Lupher Jr., M.L. Ota S. Bowtell D.D. Scaife R.M. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 851-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It is notable that the phosphorylation sites in Cbl that promote Cbl-SFK associations reside in its C-terminal region, which is dispensable for EGFR and Syk/ZAP-70 regulation (66Lill N.L. Douillard P. Awwad R.A. Ota S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Miyake S. Meissner-Lula N. Hsu V.W. Band H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 414-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a clear need to better define the relative importance of various mechanisms of Cbl-SFK association and their role in SFK-directed ubiquitin ligase activity of Cbl. Given that Cbl is selectively recruited to active PTKs and is invariably a substrate of these kinases, the potential role of the kinase activity in controlling the Cbl-mediated ubiquitinylation of PTKs has been of great interest. Indeed, the kinase-dead Src was markedly resistant to Cbl-dependent ubiquitinylation and degradation (35Harris K.F. Shoji I. Cooper E.M. Kumar S. Oda H. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13738-13743Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and inhibitors of the kinase activity reduced the Cbl-dependent ubiquitinylation of Src (22Yokouchi M. Kondo T. Sanjay A. Houghton A. Yoshimura A. Komiya S. Zhang H. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35185-35193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Similarly, the kinase-inactive EGFR (68Schmidt M.H. Furnari F.B. Cavenee W.K. Bogler O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6505-6510Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and SYK (39Paolini R. Molfetta R. Beitz L.O. Zhang J. Scharenberg A.M. Piccoli M. Frati L. Siraganian R. Santoni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36940-36947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) mutants were resistant to Cbl-induced degradation. However, it is unclear whether the kinase activity of a target PTK is required to promote its association with Cbl, to induce a conformation that exposes the target lysine residues, or to regulate the activity of Cbl as a ubiquitin ligase. SFKs offer an excellent model to assess the role of the kinase activity versus the induced open conformation as determinants of the susceptibility of PTKs to Cbl-dependent ubiquitinylation and degradation, since well defined mutations in specific motifs can be introduced to promote an open conformation in SFKs (69Erpel T. Superti-Furga G. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 963-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 70Gonfloni S. Williams J.C. Hattula K. Weijland A. Wierenga R.K. Superti-Furga G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7261-7271Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Here, we have used this approach in the context of the SFK Fyn. Fyn is a prototype SFK that plays important physiological roles in conjunction with other widely expressed family members, such as Src and Yes (2Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

We have shown that coexpression with Cbl promotes the ubiquitinylation and degradation of Fyn, resulting in the negative regulation of Fyn-dependent cellular activation, and that cells from Cbl-/- mice have elevated total and active Fyn protein levels (21Andoniou C.E. Lill N.L. Thien C.B. Lupher Jr., M.L. Ota S. Bowtell D.D. Scaife R.M. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 851-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 23Rao N. Ghosh A.K. Zhou P. Douillard P. Andoniou C.E. Band H. Signal Transduct. 2002; 1: 29-39Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, Cbl-dependent Fyn degradation requires the ubiquitin ligase activity of Cbl and an intact cellular ubiquitinylation machinery, as revealed by lack of Cbl-dependent Fyn degradation in Chinese hamster ovary cells with a temperature-sensitive defect in the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (23Rao N. Ghosh A.K. Zhou P. Douillard P. Andoniou C.E. Band H. Signal Transduct. 2002; 1: 29-39Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). By analyzing a series of defined mutants of Fyn, we show here that both the kinase activity and open conformation determine the susceptibility of a target PTK to Cbl, primarily by controlling the level of association with Cbl. Thus, the level of association with Cbl appears to be the major determinant of the selective ubiquitinylation and degradation of an active PTK by Cbl.

https://openalex.org/W2101347093,"Yeast mutants defective in sphingolipid mannosylation accumulate inositol phosphorylceramide C (IPC-C), which renders cells Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive. A screen for loss of function suppressors of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive phenotype previously led to the identification of numerous genes involved in IPC-C synthesis. To better understand the molecular basis of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced growth defect in IPC-C-overaccumulating cells, we searched for genes whose overexpression restored Ca<sup>2+</sup> tolerance in a mutant lacking the IPC mannosyltransferases Csg1p and Csh1p. Here we report the isolation of <i>HOR7</i> as a multicopy suppressor of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive phenotype of Δ<i>csg1</i>Δ<i>csh1</i> cells. <i>HOR7</i> belongs to a group of hyperosmolarity-responsive genes and encodes a small (59-residue) type I membrane protein that localizes at the plasma membrane. Hor7p is not required for high Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup> tolerance. Instead, we find that Hor7p-overproducing cells display an increased resistance to high salt, sensitivity to low pH, and a reduced uptake of methylammonium, an indicator of the plasma membrane potential. These phenotypes are induced through a mechanism independent of the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, Pma1p. Our findings suggest that induction of Hor7p causes a depolarization of the plasma membrane that may counteract a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced influx of toxic cations in IPC-C-overaccumulating cells."
