https://openalex.org/W1570388980,"Tangier disease, a condition characterized by low levels of high density lipoprotein and cholesterol accumulation in macrophages, is caused by mutations in the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABC1. In cultured macrophages, ABC1 mRNA was induced in an additive fashion by 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and 9-cis-retinoic acid (9CRA), suggesting induction by nuclear hormone receptors of the liver X receptor (LXR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) family. We cloned the 5′-end of the human ABC1 transcript from cholesterol-loaded THP1 macrophages. When transfected into RAW macrophages, the upstream promoter was induced 7-fold by 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, 8-fold by 9CRA, and 37-fold by 9CRA and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol. Furthermore, promoter activity was increased in a sterol-responsive fashion when cotransfected with LXRα/RXR or LXRβ/RXR. Further experiments identified a direct repeat spaced by four nucleotides (from −70 to −55 base pairs) as a binding site for LXRα/RXR or LXRβ/RXR. Mutations in this element abolished the sterol-mediated activation of the promoter. The results show sterol-dependent transactivation of the ABC1 promoter by LXR/RXR and suggest that small molecule agonists of LXR could be useful drugs to reverse foam cell formation and atherogenesis.

Two genetic diseases illustrate this phenomenon, the rare Tangier disease and the more common familial HDL deficiency. Tangier disease is characterized by an extremely low concentration of circulating HDL and the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in tonsils, liver, spleen, and intestinal mucosa, mostly in macrophage foam cells (2Serfaty-Lacrosniere C. Civeira F. Lanzberg A. Isaia P. Berg J. Janus E.D. Smith Jr., M.P. Pritchard P.H. Frohlich J. Lees R.S. Barnard G.F. Ordovas J.M. Schaefer E.J.

Patients with familial HDL deficiency exhibit a low concentration of HDL particles and an increased risk of coronary artery disease (3Marcil M. Brooks-Wilson A. Clee S.M. Roomp K. Zhang L.H., Yu, L.

A common explanation for the cardioprotective effect of HDL is the major role it plays in reverse cholesterol transport (4Bruce C. Chouinard Jr., R.A. Tall A.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 297-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). It is commonly accepted that the efflux of cholesterol from cells is caused by two different pathways: the first is passive and promotes efflux from the cell membrane to HDL and the second is energy-dependent and apolipoprotein-mediated (5Rothblat G.H. de la Llera-Moya M. Atger V. Kellner-Weibel G. Williams D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 781-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter was characterized in fibroblasts and macrophages and involves lipid-poor or -free apolipoproteins such as apoA-I, apoA-II, and apo-E (5Rothblat G.H. de la Llera-Moya M. Atger V.

This active pathway has been reported to be defective in both Tangier disease and familial HDL deficiency (8Remaley A.T. Schumacher U.K. Stonik J.A. Farsi B.D. Nazih H. Brewer Jr., H.B. Arterioscler.

Whereas its expression is ubiquitous, the highest levels of human or murine mRNAs were found in placenta, fetal tissues, liver, lung, and adrenal glands (21Langmann T. Klucken J. Reil M. Liebisch G.

The predicted human protein contains 2201 amino acids (220-kDa protein) (21Langmann T. Klucken J. Reil M. Liebisch G. Luciani M.F. Chimini G. Kaminski W.E. Schmitz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The expression of hABC1 is induced by cholesterol loading of human macrophages. Both the protein and the mRNA are up-regulated in the presence of acetylated LDL, and down-regulated by cholesterol unloading via HDL3 (21Langmann T. Klucken J. Reil M. Liebisch G. Luciani M.F.

Whereas the cholesterol-mediated regulation of genes involved in cholesterol uptake or biosynthesis via sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) pathways is well understood (23Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar), much less is known about direct mechanisms of sterol-mediated up-regulation of gene expression. Two families of nuclear receptors are known to be activated by oxysterols and to mediate a positive response by binding to specific DNA elements, the liver X receptor (LXR) and steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) (24Peet D.J.

SF1 acts as a monomer and has been implicated in the regulation of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein gene expression (StAR) activity (26Christenson L.K. McAllister J.M. Martin K.O. Javitt N.B.

Recently, two different genes involved in the reverse cholesterol transport pathways, cholesterol 7α-hydoxylase (24Peet D.J. Turley S.D. Ma W. Janowski B.A. Lobaccaro J.M. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar) and cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) (25Luo Y. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), have been shown to be up-regulated by the heterodimer LXR·RXR. This suggests the hypothesis that LXRs might coordinate different steps of reverse cholesterol transport (25Luo Y. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). LXRα (NR1H3) and LXRβ (NR1H2) heterodimerize with their partner RXR. The resulting complex up-regulates genes through binding sites typically composed of direct repeats (DR) of the motif AGGTCA, spaced by 4 nucleotides (LXRα and LXRβ) or 1 nucleotide (LXRβ) (28Willy P.J.

The dimer can be activated by both the ligands of RXR (retinoids) and LXR (oxysterols) separately or together (29Teboul M. Enmark E. Li Q. Wikstrom A.C. Pelto-Huikko M. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl.

Here we report the sequence of the hABC1 promoter and show that this promoter is active in macrophages and that its sterol-mediated activation depends on the binding of LXR/RXRα to a DR4 element. 5′-RACE PCR was performed with the SMART RACE cDNA kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using 1 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA from HepG2 and THP-1 cells that were differentiated into macrophage with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and exposed to acetylated LDL (25 μg/ml) for 48 h. After reverse transcription (M-MLV reverse transcriptase, Life Technologies Inc.), a first PCR (hot start, 94 °C 30 s, 65 °C 30 s, 72 °C 3 min, 25 cycles, and then 72 °C 10 min) was performed using the reverse primer 5′-CCCCCTCCCTCGGGATGCCCGCAGACAA-3′. A second PCR (hot start, 94 °C 30 s, 55 °C 30 s, 72 °C 3 min, 25 cycles, and then 72 °C 10 min) was done on 2.5 μl of the 50×-diluted first PCR sample with the nested primer, 5′-GCCTCCGAGCATCTGAGAACAGGC-3′. The forward primers were provided by CLONTECH. The screening of the human RPC.11 BAC clone library was performed (Research Genetics, Inc., Huntsville, AL) with a 68-mer oligonucleotide probe corresponding to nucleotides 11–79 of the publishedhABC1 sequence. Two BAC clones were recovered that were positive by PCR for exon 1 (BAC553F19) and exon 3 (BAC 522C12). After digestion by PstI, a Southern blot was performed using the32P-radiolabeled probes generated by PCR with the previously cited exons. Positive bands were cloned in pBluescript KS(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, California). A colony hybridization (probes used for Southern blot) (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) allowed us to isolate positive clones for thehABC1 promoter (5 kilobases) and intron 2. Sequencing performed on both strands showed that we also cloned intron 2 from BAC 522C12. The sequences of these introns are contained in the sequence of human genomic clone RP11–1M10, which also contains exons 1, 2, and 3 (see Fig. 2 a). The cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The murine RAW 264.7, African green monkey CV-1, and human 293 or HepG2 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. THP-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing l-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin supplemented with 0.5 μmβ-mercaptoethanol. Confluent cells were differentiated with 0.2 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma) in ethanol over 72 h. Thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were isolated from C57 Bl/6 mice as described previously (34Shipley J.M. Wesselschmidt R.L. Kobayashi D.K. Ley T.J. Shapiro S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3942-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed in 24-well plates with LipofectAMINE reagent (transactivation experiments in CV-1 and 293 cells, see Figs. 4and 5) or LipofectAMINE-Plus reagent (basal activation experiments in RAW 264.7, see Figs. 4, 6, and 8) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies Inc.). For basal activation experiments, a total of 0.15 μg of reporter DNA and 0.05 μg of PRL-CMV (Renilla, Promega) per well were used. For transactivation studies, we used 0.025 μg/well PRL-CMV, 0.2 μg of reporter DNA, and 0.1 μg of each receptor (CMX-hRXRα, CMX-hLXRα, CMV-mLXRβ). pcDNA3.1 plasmid was included to obtain a final quantity of 0.45 μg of total DNA per well. The transfected cells were cultured in lipoprotein-deficient serum medium in the presence of 4 μg/ml (see Figs. 4, 6, and 8) or 2 μg/ml (transactivation experiments, see Fig. 5) of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22(R)-Hch), 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-Hch), or 7-ketocholesterol (7-Kch), 10 μm9-cis-retinoic acid (9CRA, Sigma) or ethanol alone for 24 h. The luciferase activities were measured using the Promega dual luciferase assay system. A reporter plasmid used to analyze the activity of the hABC1 promoter was constructed by subcloning a 1029-bp PCR fragment of the hABC1 promoter (from −928 to +101 bp) into the pGL3-Luc basic vector (Promega). A shorter promoter (from −469 to +101 bp) was generated by digestion of this plasmid withSacI. Deletions (see Fig. 7) were performed by enzymatic digestion (ApaI, from −156 to +101 bp) or PCR. The sequence of the PCR fragments were verified. Where shown, error barsrepresent S.D. Non-parametric Mann Whitney tests were performed to obtain p values.Figure 5Expression of LXR α and LXR β in various cell lines.Sterol transactivation by LXR/RXR of the hABC1 promoter is shown. a, cells were isolated and cultured as described under “Material and Methods.” A Northern blot was performed with 35 μg of total RNA for each cell line.

Northern blots were performed as described previously (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A human ABC1 probe corresponding to exons 2–8 of the published sequence was synthesized by reverse transcriptase-PCR using the forward primer, 5′-AGGTGGCCTGGCCTCTATTTATCTTC-3′ and the reverse primer, 5′-GCCTCCGAGCATCTGAGAACAGGC-3′. LXR probes were synthesized from humanLXRα and mouse LXRβ sequences (28Willy P.J. Umesono K. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J.

A mouse glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe was used as an internal standard (reverse transcriptase-PCR synthesized fragment: forward primer, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′). Signals were quantitated with phosphor imaging. Non-parametric Mann Whitney tests were performed to obtainp values. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (25Luo Y. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from 293 cells cotransfected with LXRα and hRXRα or LXRβ and hRXR. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the DR4 element or its mutated version (see Fig. 7) were synthesized with overhangs and used at a final concentration of 0.1 pm (hABC1DR4) or 0.5 μm (competitors). An oligonucleotide corresponding to a canonical half-site sequence (AGGTCA) was added to each sample to reduce the background (1 μm). Polyclonal antibodies against peptides from LXRα (P20, sc-1202X), LXRα/β (C19, sc-2101X), RXRα (D20, sc-553X), and RORα (K-20, sc-6063X) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). To investigate whether the endogenousABC1 gene can be activated by oxysterols and/or retinoic acid in macrophages, we performed Northern blot analysis of total RNA from human THP-1 macrophages. Fig. 1shows a significant increase of ABC1 mRNA in cells treated with 22(R)-Hch (2-fold induction, p < 0.05) or 9CRA (2-fold, p < 0.05). An additive effect was obtained with combined treatment (4-fold, p < 0.05 when compared with separate treatments). These responses suggest possible activation of transcription by LXR/RXR (32Janowski B.A. Willy P.J. Devi T.R. Falck J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). To identify the promoter of the human ABC1 gene, we performed 5′-RACE PCR using poly(A)+ mRNA from cholesterol-loaded THP-1 macrophages and HepG2 cells (Fig.2 b). In macrophages this revealed a single major transcript (transcript A) consisting of a first exon of 217 bp followed by a second exon of 160 bp, 73% identical to mouse exon 1 (GenBank™/EBI accession number X75926). This exon is then followed by the published human exons 2, 3, and 4 (21Langmann T. Klucken J. Reil M. Liebisch G. Luciani M.F. Chimini G. Kaminski W.E. Schmitz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In HepG2 cells, 5′-RACE PCR revealed three different transcripts (Fig.2 b). Transcript B represents a truncated version of exon 2 found in THP-1 cells (only the last 29 bp) followed by the published exons 2, 3, and 4 (21Langmann T. Klucken J. Reil M. Liebisch G. Luciani M.F. Chimini G. Kaminski W.E. Schmitz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Transcript C contains one exon of 372 bp upstream of the published exon 2, which is different from the exons found in THP1 cells. Transcript D has the same 5′ structure as transcript C but lacks the published exon 3. A BLAST search of the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank (htgs) revealed 100% homology of these exons (Fig. 2 a, exons 1–3) with fragments of the human genomic clone RP11–1M10 (working draft sequence, GenBank™/EBI accession numberAC012230). A comparison of the sequences from the published exon 2, the 5′-RACE PCR product, and RP11–1M10 revealed a C instead of a T at position +15 and a G instead of an A at position +17. Conceptual translation of the transcripts revealed two new start codons in frame with the previously published ATG located in exon 5 (14Remaley A.T. Rust S. Rosier M. Knapper C. Naudin L. Broccardo C. Peterson K.M. Koch C. Arnould I. Prades C. Duverger N. Funke H. Assman G. Dinger M. Dean M. Chimini G. Santamarina-Fojo S. Fredrickson D.S. Denefle P. Brewer Jr., H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12685-12690Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) (Fig.2, a and c). In the case of the transcript characteristic of THP1 cells, a new ATG located in exon 2 resulted in an extra 60 amino acids at the amino terminus. In the case of HepG2 cells, a new start codon at the 3′-end of exon 3 may be functional in transcript C and also transcript D, which lacks the previously published start codon. This results in an extra 39-amino acid fragment for transcript C. A comparison of the putative amino-terminal amino acid sequences of ABC1 (transcripts A, B) with nucleotide data bases revealed strong homology to the amino-terminal sequences of two members of the ABC1 family (57% identity with ABCR and 45% identity with ABC3 (Fig. 1c). This strongly suggests that the amino-terminal sequence of hABC1 is authentic. The promoter region upstream of exon 1 was responsive to sterols when transfected into cells (see below), whereas the 2.3-kilobase region upstream of transcript B was not responsive (data not shown). Thus, we focused our attention on the former region. Fig. 3 presents a partial sequence of genomic DNA with a fragment of exon 1 cloned from the human RPCI.11 BAC library. A potential TATA box is present at −32 bp and an Sp1 site at −101 bp. An analysis of this sequence revealed several potential transcription factor binding sites. To investigate the function of the potentialhABC1 promoter, we transfected the macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cell line with a promoter-luciferase construct (Fig.4 a). To test for activation by sterols we used 22(R)-Hch, a potent activator of LXR·RXR (36Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Oliver B.B. Su J.L. Sundseth S.S. Winegar D.A.

Compared with basal conditions, transfected cells treated with 22(R)-Hch or 9CRA exhibited 7- and 8-fold higher promoter activity, respectively (p < 0.001) (Fig.4 a). When both compounds were added together, there was a synergistic 37-fold induction (p < 0.001). A similar response was obtained with promoter fragments containing 928 bp (Fig.4 a) or 469 bp (data not shown) of upstream sequence. Next we compared the response of the ABC1 promoter to different sterols (Fig. 4 b). We treated the transfected cells with 25-Hch, which"

The intracellular domain of RANK contains two distinct TRAF-binding domains, each of which recognizes different TRAF proteins specifically (18Hsu H. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Solovyev I. Colombero A.

While the C-terminal region of RANK interacts with TRAF2 and TRAF5, the TRAF6-binding domain resides in the middle of the RANK intracellular region. Overexpression of RANK C-terminal deletion mutants has revealed that activation of the RANK-mediated signaling pathway results in the activation of NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) which correlate with the TRAF6 interaction activity of mutants (18Hsu H.

Therefore it is speculated that JNK might play an important role in osteoclast differentiation.Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are proline-directed serine/threonine kinases that are important in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (24Nishida E.

Three major subfamilies of MAP kinase have been identified in mammalian cells: 1) extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs), 2) JNKs, and 3) p38 MAP kinases. It is widely accepted that peptide growth factors and phorbol esters preferentially activate ERKs, while cellular stresses, such as hyperosmolarity or reactive oxygen species, potently activate JNKs and p38 MAP kinases (28Iwasaki S.

Here we demonstrate that a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB203580, inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation. In addition, we show that the expression of a dominant negative form of either p38 MAP kinase or MAP kinase kinase (MKK) 6 partially inhibits differentiation. Our results indicate for the first time that activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway plays a role in RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation.DISCUSSIONOsteoclasts differentiate from hematopoietic precursors through interaction with stromal and osteoblast cells, which provide the microenvironment essential for osteoclastogenesis (1Ash P.

It was reported that the differentiation inducing activity of these reagents was mediated by RANKL, since the addition of OPG/OCIF, a decoy receptor for RANK, completely inhibited the generation of osteoclasts (39Simonet W.S.

These results suggest that in combination with M-CSF, RANKL plays an essential role in the induction of osteoclast differentiation.In this paper, we have confirmed that both M-CSF and sRANKL are required to induce terminal differentiation of bone marrow cells into multinucleated osteoclasts. Our results suggest that M-CSF and RANKL act on bone marrow cells sequentially to induce the terminal differentiation to osteoclasts and that RANKL is the differentiation inducing factor in our assay system since sRANKL alone could induce the TRAP-positive mononulear cells in the absence of the increase in cell number. Several reports indicate that M-CSF plays an essential role in osteoclastogenesis through RANK induction, the stimulation of cell survival and proliferation, and by acting as a competence factor for differentiation (34Arai F.

Since an increase in the number of adherent cells, albeit no appearance of TRAP-positive cells, was observed even in the presence of SB203580, we can speculate that SB203580 inhibits the differentiation of bone marrow cells by interfering with the RANKL-induced p38 MAP kinase activity.To elucidate the causal link between the activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway and RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, we employed RAW264 cells which expressed RANK and differentiated into TRAP-positive multinucleated cells through sRANKL treatment. As was the case with bone marrow cells, SB203580 but not PD98059 inhibited differentiation induced by sRANKL. In RAW264 cells, RANKL-induced activations of ERKs, JNKs, and p38 MAP kinase were clearly detected and SB203580 inhibited only the p38 MAP kinase activity. These results strongly suggest that at least in part p38 MAP kinase plays a critical role in RANKL-induced differentiation. However, we cannot rule out the possible involvement of ERK and JNK in osteoclastogenesis at present.Expression of the dominant negative form of p38α MAP kinase resulted in a significant decrease in the number of TRAP-positive cells induced by RANKL. Significant decrease in the RANKL-induced p38 MAP kinase activation was also observed. These results further support the notion that the activation of the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway is necessary for sRANKL-induced differentiation of bone marrow cells and RAW264 cells into osteoclasts. However, complete inhibition was not observed in CX38DN cells expressing the dominant negative form of p38α MAP kinase. It is conceivable that other isoforms of p38 MAP kinase could compensate for a possible defect in the signaling pathway through p38α MAP kinase. In addition to the α-type, at least three isoforms (β-, γ-, and δ-types) of p38 MAP kinase are reported (50Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol.

We detected the expression of the mRNA for β-type in RAW264 cells by RT-PCR (data not shown). Therefore it is possible that p38β MAP kinase functions in CX38DN cells. Because SB203580 inhibited osteoclastogenesis completely, it is likely that only p38α and p38β MAP kinases are involved in differentiation since these are the only isoforms inhibited by SB203580 at the low doses (38Kumar S. Jiang M.S. Adams J.L. Lee J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Expression of the dominant negative form of MKK6 inhibited both sRANKL-induced differentiation of RAW264 cells and p38 MAP kinase activation. It is likely that the dominant negative form of MKK6 inhibits both α- and β-types of p38 MAP kinase, thus conferring a greater range of differentiation inhibition than the inhibition performed by the dominant negative form of p38α MAP kinase. The quantitative differences between the suppression of differentiation seen with dominant negative forms of p38α MAP kinase and MKK6 could be completely explained by the extent to which the transfected forms are able to suppress p38 activity in cells. Presumably if they were more efficient, they could both achieve complete suppression.In conclusion, we have demonstrated in this paper that the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway plays a crucial role in RANKL-mediated differentiation of bone marrow cells into osteoclasts. However, experiments of the overexpression of wild type kinases revealed no correlation between p38 MAP kinase activity and RANKL-induced differentiation, suggesting the role of other factors in the RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis. Since the activation of other MAP kinase families (i.e. ERKs and JNKs) during differentiation was clearly observed, the contribution of these kinases to osteoclast differentiation should be elucidated in the near future. Bone morphogenesis, remodeling, and resorption are controlled in part by osteoclasts. These cells differentiate from hematopoietic myeloid precursors of monocyte/macrophage lineage under control of osteotropic hormones and local factors produced by supporting cells such as osteoblasts and stromal cells (1Ash P.

Apoptosis is a morphologically recognizable form of cell death that is implemented by a mechanism conserved through evolution from nematode to man. Homologues of the genes that implement cell death in nematodes do likewise in mammals, although in mammals the process is considerably more complex (1Ellis R.E. Yuan J.Y. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev.

In plants, programmed cell death is involved in the terminal differentiation of xylem vessels and perhaps in developmental processes (5Mittler R. Lam E. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 6Dietrich R.A. Richberg M.H. Schmidt R. Dean C. Dangl J.L.

Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibition of pathogen growth in plants also involves a rapid process of programmed cell death localized at the site of invasion. The death of plant cells during this “hypersensitive response” creates a zone of dead cells, called the “hypersensitive response lesion,” which limits the spread of the pathogen, playing an important role in the plant's defense mechanism (8Godiard L. Grant M.R. Dietrich R.A. Kiedrowski S. Dangl J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 9Dangl J.L. Dietrich R.A. Richberg M.H.

The process of apoptosis can be divided into three distinct components. The first component consists of the apoptotic stimulus and the signal it triggers. This signal may be delivered through surface receptors or may originate inside the cell from a secondary action of a drug, toxin, or radiation. The second component consists of the detection and the transduction of the signal, whereas the third component includes the activation and regulation of the effectors of apoptosis (11Vaux D.L. Strasser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2239-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). A highly conserved group of genes that are involved in this third component, i.e. the regulation of the apoptotic process, is the bcl-2 family of genes. The proteins encoded by these genes interact with each other and either promote (e.g. Bax, Bcl-xS, Bak, Bid, Bik, and Hrk) or inhibit (e.g.Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Bfl-1, Brag-1, Mcl-1, and A1) apoptosis (12Kroemer G. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). A common feature of the bcl-2 family of proteins is that most localize to the outer mitochondrial, outer nuclear, and endoplasmic reticular membranes via their hydrophobic C-terminal transmembrane domain (13Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria appear to play a central role in the induction of apoptosis, which can be controlled by a number of interrelated events. These include, (a) the disruption of electron transport, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP production, (b) the release of proteins that trigger the activation of the caspase family of proteases, and (c) the alteration of the cellular reduction-oxidation potential, which results in the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS)1 into the cytosol (14Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Marchetti P. Hirsch T. Gomez-Monterrey I. Castedo M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1533-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). As in mammals, plant mitochondria were also shown to be the major site of ROS production (15Maxwell D.P. Wang Y. McIntosh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8271-8276Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). When produced at low levels, ROS play a double role; they act as signals that protect the plant by inducing an array of cellular protective and defense genes and they promote the oxidative cross-linking of the cell wall. The oxidative burst at the site of the invading pathogen also induces systemic cellular responses in which ROS mediate a reiterative signal network required for the establishment of systemic acquired resistance to virulent pathogens (16Alvarez M.E. Pennell R.I. Meijer P.J. Ishikawa A. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. Cell. 1998; 92: 773-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). The mammalian protein Bax is a proapoptotic 21-kDa protein with 21% identity to Bcl-2. The protein is thought to alter organelle function by localizing to the outer mitochondrial membrane and forming an ion channel (17Zha H. Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. Mahajan N. Herman B. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6494-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Bax can exhibit its lethal phenotype even when expressed in yeast. Despite the fact that no Bcl-2 family members exist inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, the cell death caused by Bax or its close relative Bak appears relevant to its function in a physiological setting. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein can rescue yeast from Bax/Bak lethality. Mutants of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xLthat fail to protect mammalian cells from Bax-induced cell death are also inactive in yeast. Moreover, mutations of Bax and Bak, which abolish their function in mammalian cells, do so also in yeast (18Greenhalf W. Stephan C. Chaudhuri B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar,19Xu Q. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 337-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Bax induces the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria in both mammals and yeast, suggesting that its toxicity may be related to oxidative control processes and the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore (20Manon S. Chaudhuri B. Guerin M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Bax expression is also lethal in plants. Infection of Nicotiniana benthamiana plants with a tobacco mosaic virus-based vector carrying the murine Bax gene caused localized tissue collapse, in a manner resembling the hypersensitive response (21Lacomme C. Santa Cruz S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7956-7961Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). This action of Bax was dependent on the presence of the C-terminal transmembrane domain, which targets Bax to the mitochondria, and was reversible on phosphorylation. It is likely that Bax-inhibiting plant proteins may prevent apoptosis in plant cells. To test this possibility, we utilized the lethal phenotype of Bax in yeast in an attempt to characterize plant molecules linked to the apoptotic process. We devised a yeast genetic screen that would enable us to isolate plant genes that inhibit its lethality either by interacting directly with it or by indirectly alleviating its toxic effects. Here we present the characterization of the most potent among the Bax inhibiting proteins we isolated, a novel glutathioneS-transferase (GST)/glutathione peroxidase (GPX). Our aim is to understand the function of this protein with respect to the lethal Bax phenotype and to reveal components of the plant machinery that may be relevant to the process of apoptosis. A LexA-Bax construct was generated by PCR amplification of mouse Bax using the primers 5′-GGT G(↓EcoRI)AA TTC ATG GAC GGG TCC GGG GAG CAG-3′ (which introduces an EcoRI restriction site before the N terminus of Bax, MDGSGEQ) and 5′-CTT C(↓XhoI)TC GAG TCA GCC CAT CTT CTT CCA GAT-3′ (which incorporates a XhoI restriction site after the stop codon at the C terminus of Bax, IWKKMG). The amplified product was subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pGILDA vector (CLONTECH), giving rise to a construct (pGILDA/Bax) that expresses a LexA fusion with Bax under the control of a GAL1 promoter. A hemagglutinin (HA) fusion construct of Bcl-2 (pJG4–6/Bcl-2) was generated by subcloning the open reading frame of this gene from the pJG4–5/Bcl-2 construct into theEcoRI and XhoI sites of the pJG4–6 yeast expression vector, which expresses proteins as fusions to a single hemagglutinin tag under the control of GAL1 promoter. HA fusion to the library clone 2.37 (pJG4–6/2.37) was generated by subcloning the library clone 2.37 into the pJG4–6 vector (22Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R.

A tomato cDNA library cloned into the pJG4–5 vector expresses library clones as fusion to a nuclear localization sequence, a portable transcriptional activation domain (the acid blob B42AD), and a hemagglutinin epitope (25Zhou J. Loh Y.T. Bressan R.A. Martin G.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 925-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Bait and library plasmids were transformed into the yeast strain EGY48 (ura3 trp1 his3 6LexA-operator-LEU2), in which the upstream regulatory elements of the chromosomal LEU2 gene have been replaced by six copies of the LexA operator. Approximately 0.5 million transformed cells were plated in gal-raff/CM-his, trp and gal-raff/CM-his, trp, leu medium. Growing colonies were further evaluated for their ability to inhibit Bax by replating on selection plates. The isolated library plasmids were reintroduced into LexA-Bax-carrying cells and examined for their ability to grow in the presence of Bax. The full-length GST clone was isolated from a ripening UC82-B tomato cDNA library (Stratagene) that was screened using the 2.37 clone as a probe. Three independent clones containing the full-length sequence were isolated and sequenced. EGY48 cells containing the plasmids coding for LexA-Bax, or LexA-Bax and the GST/GPX protein were grown in glu/CM-his, and EGY48 cells containing the plasmids coding for LexA-Bax and Bcl-2 were grown in glu/CM-his, trp, until the optical density (A600) reached 0.5. At this point, the cells were pelleted and resuspended to A600 = 0.05 in a medium containing 2% galactose and 1% raffinose (gal-raff) as the carbon source, instead of glucose, to induce expression of the fusion proteins from the GAL1 promoter (cells containing the plasmids coding for LexA-Bax or LexA-Bax and the GST/GPX protein were grown in gal-raff/CM-his, and EGY48 cells containing the plasmids coding for LexA-Bax and Bcl-2 were grown in gal-raff/CM-his, trp). Aliquots of cells were removed at regular intervals up to 48 h and theA600 was measured. Fresh overnight cultures of EGY48 yeast cells expressing the 2.37 cDNA in gal-raff/CM-trp medium, as well as the other isolated library clones, were washed with sterile H2O and diluted to A600 = 0.5. 100-μl aliquots were used to inoculate 5 ml of gal-raff/CM-trp liquid medium containing 5 mm H2O2. The cultures were incubated at 30 °C with shaking. 25-μl aliquots (∼5 × 104 cells) were removed and plated on gal/CM-trp, and the surviving colonies were counted. The full-length open reading frame of the newly isolated 2.37 cDNA clone was PCR-amplified using the primers 5′-ATG GCT AAC GAT GAA GTG ATT CTG-3′ and 5′-TTC AAT TCC AAA CTT TTG CCT TAG-3′. The PCR product was cloned into the pBad TOPO TA vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, CA). Expression of protein was induced by supplementing logarithmically growing bacterial cells with 0.2% l-arabinose. 50 ml of L-broth medium supplemented with 80 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with 1 ml of fresh overnight culture of bacterial cells harboring the pBad/BI-GST/GPX construct. Cells were grown at 37 °C with vigorous shaking to A600 ∼0.7. l-arabinose was added, and the culture was grown as described above for 5 h. The induced culture was centrifuged to remove the medium, and the cells were resuspended in 5 ml of lysis solution (10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 4 mm dithiothreitol). The cells were broken by sonication and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and incubated with Ni+2-agarose resin. Imidazole was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the mixture was further incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. At the end of the incubation the beads were washed several times with wash solution (20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 1 m KCl, 20% glycerol, 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mmimidazole) by repeated centrifugations at low speed. The His tag-fused GST protein was eluted by incubating in 200 μl of elution solution (20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 0.3 m KCl, 20% glycerol, 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mmimidazole) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were grown, and expression of the protein was induced as described above. The induced culture was centrifuged, and the cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 2.7 mm KCl, 120 mm NaCl). The cells were broken by sonication and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and incubated with 200 μl of a suspension of GSH-agarose in phosphate-buffered saline. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, and the beads were subsequently washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The bound protein was eluted by adding 300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 15 mm GSH. The bound protein was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The full-length open reading frame of 2.37 cDNA was PCR-amplified using the primers 5′-CAG GAA TTC ATG GCT AAC GAT GAA GTG ATT-3′ and 5′-TCC CTC GAG TTA TTC AAT TCC AAA CTT TTG-3′. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI andXhoI, purified, and cloned into the pEG202 and pJG4–5 interaction trap vectors. The constructs pEG202/BI-GST/GPX and pJG4–5/BI-GST/GPX were introduced into the yeast reporter strain EGY48 by lithium acetate transformation (24Golemis E.A. Khazak V. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 63: 197-218PubMed Google Scholar). EGY48 cells expressing the LexA-(BI-GST/GPX) fusion with the B42AD-(BI-GST/GPX) or the LexA-(BI-GST/GPX) fusion with the B42AD alone were replica-plated on glu/CM-his, trp, leu and gal-raff/CM-his, trp, leu and incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. EGY48 cells containing LexA-Bax, LexA-Bax and HA-(BI-GST/GPX), HA-(BI-GST/GPX), HA-Bcl-2, or no plasmids were grown to A600 ≅ 0.5 using glucose as the carbon source. Cells were subsequently washed and resuspended in galactose-containing medium in which they were cultured with shaking for an additional 8-h period. Total glutathione and glutathione disulfide were measured in equal amounts of cellular material according to the method described by Griffith (26Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4034) Google Scholar). The cells were pelleted, resuspended in 5 ml of 1% oxalic acid, and broken by sonication. After the samples were centrifuged, 200 μl of the supernatant was removed. To the samples analyzed for glutathione disulfide (GSSG), 4 μl of 2-vinyl pyridine was added. 45 μm final concentration of triethanolamine was then added to all the samples. 1-ml samples containing 125 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 6.3 mm EDTA, 0.21 mm NADPH, 0.1 mm5,5-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (Sigma) and 200 μl of the samples were equilibrated at 30 °C for 5 min. 0.5 units of glutathione reductase was added, and the absorbance at 412 nm was monitored. The concentration of glutathione was calculated by comparing the rate of the reaction to a glutathione standard curve. Lipid extraction was performed using the method described by Komagata and Suzuki (27Komagata K. Suzuki K. Methods Microbiol. 1987; 19: 161-207Crossref Scopus (2768) Google Scholar). 0.5 g of lyophilized cells were incubated with 5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v) overnight at room temperature in a screw-capped glass tube. The mixture was subsequently filtered through Whatman paper no. 1, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. The pellet was rinsed with 2 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v), and the supernatants were pooled. To partition the two solvents, one fourth volume of 1% KCl solution was added. The lipophilic layer was removed and filtered through Na2SO4 powder to absorb the remaining water in the extract. The solvent was removed by a stream of N2. Subsequently, 0.4 ml of a 1.5% solution of sodium methylate was added, and the samples were incubated at 80 °C for 90 min. 0.4 ml of heptane was added, the samples were vortexed, and the phases were allowed to separate. To concentrate the samples, the upper phase was transferred to high recovery vials (Hewlett Packard), the solvent was evaporated, and the residual was resuspended in 50 μl of heptane. Quantitative lipid analysis was performed using a gas chromatograph (Hewlett Packard 5890 series II) equipped with a flame ionization detector. A cross-linked fused silica capillary column HP-FFAP, 50 m long, 0.2 mm inner diameter, 0.33 μm film thickness, was used under the following conditions: injector temperature, 250 °C; oven temperature, 220 °C; detector temperature, 280 °C; attenuation, −2; column head pressure, 30 p.s.i.; column flow, 0.4 m/min. Split vent flow was 15 ml/mm. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed with a coupled system HPGC 5890II-VG TRIO 2000 mass spectrometer equipped with the MAS LYNX software. Chromatographic conditions were similar to those described above. Mass spectra were taken at 70 eV, and the scanning speed was 1 s−1 from 40 to 230 m/z. Identification of peaks was carried out by comparison with authentic samples and spectra from the Wiley electronic library. For the determination of GST and GPX activity, induced and uninduced bacterial cells containing the vector pGILDA/BI-GST were broken by sonication. GST activity of the cell extract was measured by monitoring the absorbance at 340 nm of a 1-ml reaction containing a range of sample volumes in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm GSH, and 5 mm 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene at 25 °C. 1 unit of GST activity is defined as the amount that transforms 1 μmol of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene/min at 25 °C. The total protein concentration of the bacterial extracts was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, and the activity of the sample was expressed as units of GST/mg of total protein. Bovine liver GST (Sigma) was used as a positive control. GPX activity was measured by monitoring the absorbance at 340 nm of a 1-ml reaction containing a range of sample volumes in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm GSH, 0.2 mm NADPH, 50 μg/ml cumene hydroperoxide, and 1 unit of glutathione reductase at 25 °C. 1 unit of GPX is defined as the amount of enzyme that transforms 1 μmol of NADPH to NADP/min at 25 °C. As above the GPX activity was measured as units of GPX/mg of total protein. Bovine erythrocyte GPX (Sigma) was used as a positive control. The full-length open reading frame of the putative GST/GPX was cloned into the pJG4–6 yeast vector, which directs the expression of proteins fused with to a hemagglutinin epitope tag from a GAL1 promoter. EGY48 yeast cells harboring the constructs pGILDA/Bax, pGILDA/Bax and pJG4–6/Bcl-2, pGILDA/Bax and pJG4–6/GST, and pJG4–6/GST were grown overnight in glu/CM media lacking the amino acids necessary for plasmid maintenance. The following day cells were washed and resuspended to final A600 ≅ 0.1 in galactose-based selective medium to induce protein expression. The cultures were induced for 6 h at 30 °C with vigorous shaking. Following this, the cells were resuspended in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and sonicated briefly to disrupt any aggregates. After sonication the cells were treated with 50 μl of RNaseA (10 mg/ml) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After the addition of 5 μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml), the sample were incubated for 1 h at 50 °C. The pelleted cells were washed in 300 μl of distilled H2O, centrifuged, and subsequently resuspended in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Intracellular ROS production was measured by staining with the dye 2′,7′-dichlorohydrofluoroscein diacetate (DCFH-DA; D-399, Molecular Probes), at a final concentration of 50 μm for 15 min. Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by staining cells with 3,3′dihexylocarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6(3); D-273, Molecular Probes) at a final concentration of 40 nm for 15 min. To measure the DNA content, cells subsequent to proteinase K treatment were resuspended on 300 μl of H2O, and they were fixed by the addition of 700 μl of 100% ethanol and incubation for 1 h at room temperature. Fixed cells were stained with 5 μl of propidium iodide (2.5 mg/ml) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Data were collected with a FACScan fluorescence activated cell scanner using the data acquisition program CELLQuest (Becton Dickinson, CA). 20,000 cells were measured for the DCF and DiOC6(3) staining, and 10,000 cells were measured for the propidium iodide staining. Bax is a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins and has been shown to induce cell death in mammalian, plant, and yeast cells. To screen for plant proteins that inhibit Bax-induced apoptosis, we utilized the yeast two hybrid system. The system was set up to detect (a) proteins that inhibit directly the lethal phenotype of Bax via dimerization with the Bax protein and (b) proteins that indirectly alleviate the toxic effects of Bax. A tomato library cloned into the yeast interaction trap vector pJG4–5 (25Zhou J. Loh Y.T. Bressan R.A. Martin G.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 925-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) was introduced into the EGY48 yeast two-hybrid reporter strain harboring the pGILDA/Bax construct. EGY48 cells are unable to grow in the absence of leucine in the medium, unless there is physical interaction of the LexA-DNA binding domain-bait fusion protein with the transcription activation domain-library fusion protein, which directs the complex to the LexA operator sites upstream of the LEU2 gene and activates transcription. Approximately 5 × 105independent transformed colonies, grown in glucose containing medium, were collected. To identify plant proteins that dimerize with Bax and block its activity, the LexA-Bax and the library B42AD fusion proteins were induced by switching the cells into galactose-containing medium for 1 h and by subsequently plating them on gal-raff/CM-his, trp, leu semisolid medium. This would select for proteins that not only inhibit Bax lethality but also physically interact with the LexA-Bax protein in the two hybrid system, thus enabling them to survive in the absence of leucine. To identify plant proteins that only indirectly (without physical interaction) inhibit Bax toxicity, following their exposure to galactose-containing medium, the cells were plated on gal-raff/CM-his, trp medium. No colonies grew in the medium lacking leucine, which indicated the absence of direct Bax interactors in this pool of transformants. However, screening for indirect inhibitors of Bax toxicity (in leucine-containing medium) yielded six independent colonies. Transfer of these cDNA clones into fresh pGILDA/Bax cells reproduced the phenotype, indicating that this was specifically induced by the proteins encoded by the transfected library clones. The library plasmids were isolated, and the cDNAs were sequenced. Of the six isolated clones four could be involved in oxidative metabolism. Clone 2.37 exhibits 88% identity at the amino acid level with a GST from Nicotiana tabacum(28Roxas V.P. Smith Jr., R.K. Allen E.R. Allen R.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 988-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). GSTs catalyze the nucleophilic attack of the sulfur atom of glutathione (GSH, γ-glutamylcystinilglycine) to the electronic center of a wide variety of substrates (29Marrs K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 127-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Glutathione is the chief intracellular nonprotein thiol compound that mediates redox cycling between ascorbate and NADPH and functions as a cellular storage pool of reduced thiol. During oxidative stress, rapid changes are observed in the cellular glutathione content (30Tan S. Sagara Y. Liu Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Library clone 7.40 exhibits 68% amino acid identity to a cytochrome P450 protein from Helianthus tuberosus, whereas library clone 8.44 is 75% identical with the gene encoding a tobacco cytochrome P450-like protein (31Cabello-Hurtado F. Batard Y. Salaun J.P. Durst F. Pinot F. Werck-Reichhart D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7260-7267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Both these heme-containing enzymes are involved in the oxidative metabolism of diverse endogenous and exogenous lipophilic substrates. Finally, library clone 7.52 exhibits 67% amino acid identity to the senescence-induced protein SRG1, a member of the Fe(II)-ascorbate oxidase superfamily (32Callard D. Axelos M. Mazzolini L. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The two remaining clones include: clone 2.46, which exhibits 68% amino acid identity with the endochitinase cytoplasmic precursor ofArabidopsis thaliana (GenBankTM accession numberZ25683) and 40% identity with a second characterized chitinase from A. thaliana; and library clone 6.19, which has 96% amino acid identity to the mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyl transferase protein of Solanum tuberosum (33Kopriva S.A.B., H. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 271-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), a folate requiring enzyme that channels the amino acid serine into the pathway of nucleotide biosynthesis. These findings suggest that Bax toxicity may be because of, at least in part, the generation of oxidative stress. Results from other studies also suggest that ROS are important regulators of apoptosis (30Tan S. S"

An in vivofootprinting analysis of the mtDNA segment within the tRNALeu(UUR) gene that binds the transcription termination factor failed to reveal any difference in occupancy of sites or qualitative interaction with the protein between mutant and wild-type mtDNAs. Cell lines nearly homoplasmic for the mutation exhibited a strong (70–75%) reduction in the level of aminoacylated tRNALeu(UUR) and a decrease in mitochondrial protein synthesis rate. The latter, however, did not show any significant correlation between synthesis defect of the individual polypeptides and number or proportion of UUR codons in their mRNAs, suggesting that another step, other than elongation, may be affected. Sedimentation analysis in sucrose gradient showed a reduction in size of the mitochondrial polysomes, while the distribution of the two rRNA components and of the mRNAs revealed decreased association of mRNA with ribosomes and, in the most affected cell line, pronounced degradation of the mRNA associated with slowly sedimenting structures. Therefore, several lines of evidence indicate that the protein synthesis defect in A3243G MELAS mutation-carrying cells is mainly due to a reduced association of mRNA with ribosomes, possibly as a consequence of the tRNALeu(UUR)aminoacylation defect.

Bonilla E. DiMauro S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 131-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), of the disease-causing mutations identified so far in human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).1Investigations of their pathogenetic mechanisms can provide important information on mitochondrial protein synthesis and other aspects of mitochondrial biogenesis. Among such studies are those on the A8344G mutation in tRNALys, which causes myoclonic epilepsy and ragged red fiber syndrome (MERRF) (2.Shoffner J.M. Lott M.T. Lezza A.M.S. Seibel P. Ballinger S.W. Wallace D.C. Cell. 1990; 61: 931-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar), and those on the T7445C mutation in the nucleotide immediately adjacent to the 3′-end of the tRNASer(UCN) gene, which is associated with deafness (3.Reid F.M.

Otolaryngol. 1995; 16: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The former tRNA mutation causes premature termination of translation, most likely due to a tRNALys aminoacylation deficiency (5.Enriquez J.A. Chomyn A. Attardi G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), while the latter mutation produces a reduction in the level of tRNASer(UCN), due to a defect of precursor processing, that also reduces the level of the co-transcribed ND6 mRNA (6.Guan M.-X.

Protein synthesis in mitochondria with the latter mutation is presumably also affected at the level of elongation, but, rather than premature termination, there appears to be a pause in elongation, followed by a resumption of synthesis. The pathogenetic mechanism of the most extensively investigated tRNA gene mutation, the A3243G transition in the tRNALeu(UUR)gene, which causes the MELAS encephalomyopathy (7.Goto Y. Nonaka I. Horai S. Nature. 1990; 348: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar), maternally inherited diabetes (8.van den Ouweland J.M.W. Lemkes H.H.P.J. Ruitenbeek W. Sandkuijl L.A. de Vijlder M.F.

Lancet. 1991; 337: 927-928Abstract PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), is still unresolved, despite the numerous investigations on this topic. The mutation occurs in the middle of the binding site for the mitochondrial transcription termination factor, mTERF (10.Kruse B. Narasimhan N. Attardi G. Cell. 1989; 58: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 a). In vitro experiments have shown that the mutation does indeed reduce the affinity of mTERF for the DNA (11.Chomyn A. Martinuzzi A. Yoneda M. Daga A. Hurko O. Johns D. Lai S.T. Nonaka I. Angelini C. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4221-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and cause a decrease in the rate of termination of the rDNA transcription unit (12.Hess J.F. Parisi M.A. Bennett J.L. Clayton D.A. Nature. 1991; 351: 236-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, an analysis of mtDNA-less human cells repopulated with mitochondria from MELAS patients (11.Chomyn A. Martinuzzi A. Yoneda M. Daga A. Hurko O. Johns D. Lai S.T. Nonaka I. Angelini C.

Biol. 1992; 12: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) did not reveal any significant difference from the controls in the relative steady-state levels of the two rRNA species, encoded upstream of the termination site, and of the mRNAs encoded downstream. On the other hand, the mitochondrial protein synthesis rate has been found to be decreased, as was the respiration rate, in cell lines carrying the mutation (11.Chomyn A. Martinuzzi A. Yoneda M. Daga A. Hurko O. Johns D. Lai S.T. Nonaka I. Angelini C. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4221-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar,13.King M.P. Koga Y. Davidson M. Schon E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The protein synthesis defect has been proposed to be due to stalling of translation by pseudoribosomes that have incorporated RNA 19, an incompletely processed transcript reported to accumulate in A3243 mutant cells, in place of 16 S rRNA (14.Schon E.A. Koga Y. Davidson M. Moraes C.T. King M.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 206-209PubMed Google Scholar), or possibly to defective posttranscriptional modification of the tRNALeu(UUR) (15.Helm M. Florentz C. Chomyn A. Attardi G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar,16.Yasukawa T. Suzuki T. Suzuki T. Uedo T. Ohta S. Watanabe K. J. Biol.

Yet others suggest that the mutant tRNA may cause mistranslation, leading to accelerated turnover of mitochondrial translation products (17.Flierl A. Reichmann H. Seibel P. J. Biol.

The results described in the present work do not fit a model in which, in MELAS mutation-carrying cells, mitochondrial translation is affected mainly at the level of elongation, either prematurely terminating at or near UUR codons or pausing at UUR codons and then resuming elongation. On the contrary, they give strong support to a model in which the A3243G mutation affects both the steady state level and the aminoacylation efficiency of the tRNALeu(UUR) and, possibly as a consequence of these changes, reduces the rate of assembly of mRNA with ribosomes, with a resulting decrease in mitochondrial translation rate. The cell lines used for these studies have been described previously (11.Chomyn A. Martinuzzi A. Yoneda M. Daga A. Hurko O. Johns D. Lai S.T. Nonaka I. Angelini C. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). The cell line pT1 is a ρ0206 transformant that carries the A8344G MERRF mutation in the mitochondrial tRNALys gene in nearly 100% of its mtDNA (19.Chomyn A. Meola G. Bresolin N. Lai S.T. Scarlato G.

For sequencing the tRNALeu(UUR)gene, the mtDNA fragment between positions 3206 and 3728 was amplified, using 20-nucleotide-long primers, by the polymerase chain reaction. The product was then purified from an agarose gel and sequenced with a primer corresponding to heavy (H)-strand nucleotides 3511–3491. Similarly, the fragment of mtDNA between positions 11836 and 12553 that contains the tRNALeu(CUN) gene was amplified and then sequenced with light (L)-strand primer L12080–12099 or H-strand primerH12500–12479. Total cellular DNA on slot blots was hybridized with a 498-nucleotide probe for nuclear ribosomal DNA, stripped, and then rehybridized with a 2537-nucleotide probe for mitochondrial ribosomal DNA as described (20.Yoneda M. Chomyn A. Martinuzzi A. Hurko O. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11164-11168Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This was done as described previously (22.Micol V. Fernandez-Silva P. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18896-18904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23.Micol V. Fernandez-Silva P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 3-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, intact cells were treated with dimethyl sulfate (DMS), which methylates unprotected guanines and adenines (24.Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar). Total nucleic acids were then extracted and incubated with piperidine, which cleaves the DNA preferentially at the methylated guanine residues (24.Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar). The DNA was subjected to multiple rounds of primer extension from a 32P-5′-end-labeled H strand primer, as described previously (23.Micol V. Fernandez-Silva P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 3-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the final products were resolved on a sequencing gel. Highly purified total mitochondrial tRNA was isolated as described (25.Enriquez J.A. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 183-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification of the steady state levels of individual mitochondrial tRNA species was done by RNA gel blot analysis as described (5.Enriquez J.A. Chomyn A. Attardi G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), using 32P-5′-end-labeled oligonucleotides specific for tRNALeu(UUR), tRNALys, tRNASer(UCN), tRNAGlu, and 12 S rRNA, as detailed previously (6.Guan M.-X. Enriquez J.A. Fischel-Ghodsian N. Puranam R.S. Lin C.P. Maw M.A. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5868-5879Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). For quantification of the extent of aminoacylation of the tRNAs, a rapid procedure for isolation of the mitochondrial fraction was used. The tRNAs were extracted under acid conditions and then run on an acid-urea 6.5% polyacrylamide gel to separate the charged and uncharged tRNAs (5.Enriquez J.A. Chomyn A. Attardi G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 26.Varshney U. Lee C.-P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification of band intensities was done by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) analysis. mtDNA-encoded proteins were labeled in 143B.TK− and 43B cells in vivo for 30 min with [35S]methionine in methionine-free medium in the presence of emetine, as described previously, and the labeled protein gel patterns have been published (11.Chomyn A. Martinuzzi A. Yoneda M. Daga A. Hurko O. Johns D. Lai S.T. Nonaka I. Angelini C. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4221-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). For the present work, the mtDNA-encoded proteins in 2SA and 2SC cells were labeled for 20 or 40 min in the same manner, using [35S]methionine (1175 Ci/mmol; Expre35S35S, NEN Life Science Products) at 150 μCi/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium minus methionine, supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Lysates of the labeled cells were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described (27.Chomyn A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 197-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The quantification of band intensities was done by NIH Image analysis of optical gel scans of appropriately exposed films. To examine the stability of proteins synthesized in mitochondria, a “pulse-chase” labeling protocol was used. 94I and 43B were exposed for 2 h to 0.2 mCi/ml of [35S]methionine in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium minus methionine, supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. The labeling medium was then replaced with complete, nonradioactive medium, and the cells were grown for 16 h at 37 °C before harvesting. For reference, other samples were labeled for 2 h with [35S]methionine in the presence of cycloheximide and then immediately harvested. For the analysis of mitochondrial polysomes, cells were labeled with [35S]methionine as described (5.Enriquez J.A. Chomyn A. Attardi G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and mixed with 143B.TK− cells that had been labeled for 1 day with [5-3H]uridine in the absence of inhibitors (to provide size markers for the sucrose gradients, as described below). The mitochondrial fraction was then isolated and lysed with 2% Triton X-100 as described (28.Ojala D. Attardi G. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 65: 273-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) but in the presence of 5 mmdithiothreitol and 50 units/ml RNasin (Promega). The mitochondrial lysate was run on a 15–30% sucrose gradient (28.Ojala D. Attardi G. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 65: 273-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7 (25 °C), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 (TKM buffer) in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 32,600 rpm for 190 min at 2 °C. Approximately 0.3-ml fractions from the gradients were collected into tubes containing 10 μl of 2 mm dithiothreitol and 1 unit of RNasin (Promega), and a portion precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid in the presence of 50 μg of bovine serum albumin. The precipitates were collected on Millipore HAWP filters, and the radioactivity was counted. In a control experiment using puromycin, the cells were incubated with 150 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) for 10 min immediately following the 5-min [35S]methionine labeling pulse. For the analysis of ribosomes and ribosomal subunits (28.Ojala D. Attardi G. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 65: 273-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), cells were treated for 20 min with 0.1 μg/ml actinomycin D to inhibit nuclear RNA synthesis and then labeled for 1 h (unless otherwise stated) with 0.05 mCi/ml [5-3H]uridine (22 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) in the continued presence of actinomycin D and pooled with ∼10 times as many unlabeled cells and with cells labeled with [2-14C]uridine in the absence of inhibitors (see below). The mitochondrial fraction was then isolated, lysed with 2% Triton X-100, and analyzed in the sucrose gradient described above by running it in the SW41 rotor at 28,000 rpm for 13.8 h at 2 °C. As mentioned above, size markers for the sucrose gradients were provided by the addition of [5-3H]uridine- or [2-14C]uridine-labeled 143B.TK− cells to the cells that had been labeled for polysome or ribosome analysis, respectively. In particular, 2.5 × 105 cells were labeled for 1 day with 0.25 μCi/ml of [5-3H]uridine or of [2-14C]uridine (60 mCi/mmol; ICN) in the absence of inhibitors. Under such labeling conditions, the stable nucleus-encoded large and small subunit rRNAs incorporate most of the radioactivity. Because the cytosolic ribosomes and ribosomal subunits, with sedimentation constants 74, 60, and 40 S, always contaminate the mitochondrial fraction, they are detectable in the sucrose gradient profiles of the mitochondrial lysates by virtue of their containing the long term 3H- or 14C-labeled nucleus-encoded rRNAs. For analysis of the RNAs in the various fractions of a sucrose gradient, pairs or triplets of fractions were pooled, and then 2 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3 m NaCl, 8 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 150 μg/ml proteinase K, and 10 μg/ml tRNA were added. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then extracted twice with a 25:24:1 mixture of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol equilibrated with 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, precipitated with ethanol, and finally dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA. The RNAs from the desired fractions were pooled and divided into five equal parts. An excess of unlabeled DNA probe or mixture of probes was hybridized to each aliquot of labeled RNA in 0.4 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA for 15 h at 60 °C. After digestion with RNases T1 (50 units/ml) and A (40 μg/ml), the RNase-resistant radioactivity was determined as described (29.King M.P. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10228-10237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The probes were as follows: for the detection of 16 S rRNA, 12 S rRNA, and ND1 RNA, plasmid clones containing 805 nucleotide pairs of the 16 S rRNA gene, 800 nucleotide pairs of the 12 S rRNA gene, and 809 nucleotide pairs of the ND1 gene, respectively, were used. To probe the RNAs downstream of theND1 gene, an equimolar mixture of clones containing sequences of the COI, COII, ATPase 8/ATPase 6,COIII, ND3, ND4L/ND4, ND5, and cytochrome b genes, spanning 7424 nucleotide pairs of mRNA coding region was used. The latter set of plasmid clones contained also the sequences of tRNAs specific for Ser (both tRNAs), Asp, Lys, Glu, Arg, His, and Leu(CUN). This was done substantially as described previously (11.Chomyn A. Martinuzzi A. Yoneda M. Daga A. Hurko O. Johns D. Lai S.T. Nonaka I. Angelini C. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4221-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The probes for ND1 mRNA, 16 S rRNA, and 12 S rRNA were plasmids carrying the human mtDNA sequences from position 2953 to 3311, from 1768 to 2573, and from 764 to 1466, respectively. The probes for ND2 and COI mRNAs were plasmid inserts that corresponded to the human mtDNA sequence from position 4431 to 5274, and from 6203 to 6910, respectively. All were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP or [α-32P]dATP by the random primer method (30.Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar). Nonlinear curve fitting was done using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (KaleidaGraph software, Synergy). The cell lines 43B and 2SC, which carried the A3243G mutation in nearly homoplasmic form (99 and 97%, respectively) had been previously shown to have decreased mitochondrial protein synthesis rates (∼20 and ∼50%, respectively, of the wild-type rates, after a 30-min labeling pulse with [35S]methionine) and markedly reduced respiration rates (<10 and ∼18%, respectively, of the wild-type rates) (11.Chomyn A. Martinuzzi A. Yoneda M. Daga A. Hurko O. Johns D. Lai S.T. Nonaka I. Angelini C. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4221-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Another mutant cell line, 4H1, that carried 98% mutant mtDNA (20.Yoneda M. Chomyn A. Martinuzzi A. Hurko O. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11164-11168Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), was used in some of the analyses presented here. The 143B.TK− cell line, and transmitochondrial cell lines 94I and 2SA all exhibited 100% wild-type DNA at position 3243 (11.Chomyn A. Martinuzzi A. Yoneda M. Daga A. Hurko O. Johns D. Lai S.T. Nonaka I. Angelini C. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4221-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Cell lines 94I and 43B are isogenic except at position 3243, as are the pair 2SA and 2SC. The sequences of the tRNALeu(UUR) genes in 94I and 43B had been previously shown (15.Helm M. Florentz C. Chomyn A. Attardi G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) to be identical to the Cambridge sequence (31.Anderson S. Bankier A.T. Barrell B.G. de-Bruijn M.H.L. Coulson A.R. Drouin J. Eperon I.C. Nierlich D.P. Roe B.A. Sanger F. Schreier H.P. Smith A.J.H. Stader R. Young I.G. Nature. 1981; 290: 427-465PubMed Google Scholar) outside of position 3243. Polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing of the tRNALeu(UUR) gene from the 2SC and 4H1 cell lines (this work) also failed to reveal any difference from the standard sequence. Furthermore, in order to investigate the possible presence in the mutant cells of a suppressor mutation in the other mitochondrial tRNALeu gene, like the one at position 12,300 that has been recently reported (32.El Meziane A. Lehtinen S.K. Hance N. Nijtmans L.G.J. Dunbar D. Holt I.J. Jacobs H.T. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the mitochondrial tRNALeu(CUN) gene of the 43B, 4H1, 2SA, and 2SC cell lines was polymerase chain reaction-amplified and sequenced. No mutation at position 12,300 or at any other position was found in this gene in any of the cell lines. The amount of mtDNA relative to nuclear DNA in the cell lines 94I, 43B, 2SA, 2SC, and 4H1 was 129, 103, 130, 100, and 83%, respectively, of that in 143B.TK− cells. Previous evidence from in vitro experiments had shown that the A3243G mutation decreased the binding of mTERF to mtDNA and the efficiency of transcription termination (11.Chomyn A. Martinuzzi A. Yoneda M. Daga A. Hurko O. Johns D. Lai S.T. Nonaka I. Angelini C. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4221-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 12.Hess J.F. Parisi M.A. Bennett J.L. Clayton D.A. Nature. 1991; 351: 236-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In view of the discrepancy of these results with the observed lack of any effect of the mutation on the ratio of transcripts downstream to those upstream of the termination site (11.Chomyn A. Martinuzzi A. Yoneda M. Daga A. Hurko O. Johns D. Lai S.T. Nonaka I. Angelini C. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4221-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 13.King M.P. Koga Y. Davidson M. Schon E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), in the present work in vivo footprinting experiments were carried out to determine whether the A3243G mutation reduces the occupancy of the mTERF binding sites or causes changes in the methylation interference pattern in living cells. Fig. 1 b shows the in vivo footprint of the mtDNA L strand of the rDNA transcription termination region for several cell lines that are wild-type at position 3243, namely HeLa, 143B.TK−, 94I, and 2SA, and two cell lines that carry the A3243G transition (in ≥97% of their mitochondrial genomes), 43B and 2SC. The footprints of the protein can be seen in the lanes marked E between positions 3232 and 3256, in agreement with data from in vitro DNase I protection experiments (10.Kruse B. Narasimhan N. Attardi G. Cell. 1989; 58: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and from previously reported in vivofootprinting experiments (22.Micol V. Fernandez-Silva P. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18896-18904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The region protected from modification by DMS is the same in wild-type and mutant cells. An analysis of the patterns from mutant cells, after normalization to reference bands outside the mTERF binding site, reveals protection of the new G residue at position 3243. As the adjacent G at position 3242 is protected in both wild-type and mutant cells, it is likely that protein protects position 3243 in control cells as well as in mutant cells, but this effect is not detected because methylated A is not efficiently cleaved by piperidine (24.Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar). The G at position 3244 is affected in its in vivo methylation pattern, but inconsistently; it is hypermethylated in 143B.TK− and HeLa cells, in agreement with published data (22.Micol V. Fernandez-Silva P. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18896-18904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and also in 94I cells. By contrast, this G is protected in 43B mutant cells. However, the modification of methylation of this G is marginal in 2SA and 2SC cells. It is not clear whether any significance is to be attributed to this variable base modification. Apart from the differences at 3243 and, possibly, at 3244, there are no significant qualitative differences in the methylation interference pattern of the mitochondrial rDNA termination region between the mutants 43B and 2SC, on one hand, and their isogenic controls, 94I and 2SA, respectively, or the parental cell line 143B.TK−, on the other. Furthermore, a densitometric analysis showed that, after correction for loading differences, there is no significant consistent quantitative change between mutant and control patterns in the nucleotide protection or hypermethylation within the mTERF binding segment in the tRNALeu(UUR) gene. The transfer hybridization analysis of mitochondrial tRNAs in Fig.2 a shows that there is no obvious difference in electrophoretic mobility between the mutant tRNA and the wild-type species (compare, for example, 2SA and 2SC). Correct processing of the mutant tRNALeu(UUR) from its precursor had previously been shown by a structural analysis of the 5′- and 3′-ends of mutant and wild-type tRNALeu(UUR) (33.Koga Y. Davidson M. Schon E.A. King M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and confirmed recently by direct analysis of the nucleotide composition (including modified nucleotides) of the radioactively pure tRNA (15.Helm M. Florentz C. Chomyn A. Attardi G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the steady state amount of tRNALeu(UUR), when normalized to the values for tRNALys, tRNASer, tRNAGlu, and 12 S rRNA, appears to be reduced in 43B to 47, 35, 42, and 60%, respectively (mean 46%), of the isogenic control, 94I; in 2SC to 41, 32, 42, and 69% (mean 46%) of the isogenic control, 2SA; and in 4H1 to 63, 55, 46, and 86% o"

Incubation of brain microsomes with Cu(II) generated ∼30-kDa proteinase K-resistant PrP. Cu(II) had little effect on fresh recombinant PrP23-231, but aged protein characterized by conversion of Asn-107 to Asp decreased α-helical content by ∼30%, increased β-sheet content 100%, formed aggregates, and acquired proteinase K resistance in the presence of Cu(II). These transitions took place without need for acid pH, organic solvents, denaturants, or reducing agents. Since conversion of Asn to Asp proceeds by a spontaneous pathway involving deamidation, our data suggest that covalent variants of PrPC arising in this manner may, in concert with Cu(II), generate PrPSc-like species capable of initiating sporadic prion disease.

Prion propagation is not thought to involve the replication of a nucleic acid genome but is attributed to PrPScmolecules templating the refolding of PrPC to create further PrPSc molecules, emphasizing the distinction between prions and viruses. Although the notion of prion diseases as disorders of protein folding is becoming increasingly accepted, many questions remain unanswered. If PrPSc is the causative infectious agent, why are 10,000–100,000 molecules present per infectious unit? Does this number imply the existence of sub-varieties of PrPSc? What is the origin of sporadic CJD (sCJD), occurring at a rate of 0.5–1 case per million? This transmissible disease is not attributable to iatrogenic spread or germ line mutation in the human PrP gene (PRNP) and is hypothesized to arise by very rare errors in PrPCbiochemistry that generate PrPSc-like molecules (8.Westaway D. Carlson G.A. Prusiner S.B. Trends Neurosci. 1989; 12: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The nature of these events is obscure, however. Another question raised by sCJD concerns the molecular basis of prion strains. These are distinct isolates of agent with apparently true-breeding attributes that can be propagated in the same inbred host. They are inferred to exist from analyses of the variable neuropathology of sCJD (9.Gibbs Jr., C.J. Gajdusek D.C. Amyx H. Prusiner S.B. Hadlow W.J.

The existence of strains of scrapie prions was widely interpreted to indicate the presence of a nucleic acid genome (12.Kimberlin R.H. Walker C.A. Fraser H. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 2017-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar); however, biochemical analyses have failed to provide strong evidence for such an entity (13.Kellings K. Prusiner S.B.

More recent studies indicate that strains are associated with PrPSc variants that can be distinguished by protease cleavage sites in the vicinity of codon 90 (14, 15) or the accessibility of residues 104–113 to the 3F4 antibody (16.Safar J.

This fits well with the view from molecular genetics, since the gene that controls susceptibility to prion strains, previously referred to as Prn-i or Sinc, has been found to correspond to a variant allele of the PrP gene (Prnp) distinguished by missense changes at codons 108 and 189 (18.Westaway D.

PrPC itself is expressed on the cell surface by virtue of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. It is composed of an N-terminal domain, which includes reiterated octapeptide motifs of the general form P(H/G)GGGWGQ, and a pathogenesis-associated C-terminal domain that can fold into proteinase-resistant, amyloidogenic aggregates (7.Oesch B.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 129-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Binding of Cu(II) to the octapeptide motifs is specific and cooperative (24.Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Biochem.

As patterns of protease-resistant PrP fragments characteristic for certain sCJD subtypes can be interconverted via the prior use of metal chelators, it is inferred that PrPSc is engaged with transition metals in brain homogenates (32.Wadsworth J.D.F. Hill A.F. Joiner S. Jackson G.S. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and perhaps in vivo. In this paper we examined structural consequences of metal binding to PrP. The substrates comprised full-length recombinant mouse PrP (“rPrP,” MoPrP23-231), which is highly soluble at neutral pH (33.Hornemann S. Korth C. Oesch B. Riek R. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Glockshuber R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and PrPC isolated from brain homogenates. Our findings reveal a divergence in the behavior of fresh and aged rPrP that is correlated with conversion of Asn-107 to Asp, a modification first described by Sandmeier et al. (34.Sandmeier E. Hunziker P. Kunz B. Sack R. Christen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), although not previously associated with alterations in structural properties. This covalent change most likely occurs by a well known chemical pathway involving deamidation and hydrolysis. Although studies of a rapid-onset prion disease model found only 0.5 mol % d-aspartyl andl-isoaspartyl residues in PrPSc, arguing against an obligatory relationship between deamidation and PrPSc formation (35.Weber D.J. McFadden P.N. Caughey B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 606-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), our biochemical studies suggest a novel pathway for the formation of PrPSc-like molecules perhaps germane to the origins of sporadic prion disease. Cells of Escherichia coli BL2l(DE3) including pRBI-PDI-T7-MoPrP23-231 (pMoPrP23-231) (33.Hornemann S. Korth C. Oesch B. Riek R. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Glockshuber R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) were grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of LB containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). At A 600 nm = 0.8–1.0, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was shaken at 37 °C for 16 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min, resuspended in 20 ml of suspension buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mg/ml DNase I, 0.4 mg/ml RNase A, 1 mg/ml lysozme, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and shaken at 37 °C for 2 h and at room temperature for 1 h. The cleared lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C at 39,000 × g for 1 h. The insoluble inclusion bodies were washed twice with wash buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 23% sucrose (w/v), 0.5% Triton X-l00 (v/v), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine) and solubilized in 10 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm EDTA, 8 m urea. After centrifugation at 39,000 × g at 22 °C for 1 h, the pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 7.0 with 0.1 mm HCl and applied to an SP-Sepharose column (20 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with l0 mmMOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 8m urea, using BioLogic HR chromatography system (Bio-Rad). MoPrP23-231 was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.6m). Fractions containing MoPrP23-231 were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0, 5 mmDTT, 1 mm EDTA, 8 m urea, then re-applied to an SP-Sepharose column (20 ml). MoPrP23-231 was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.6 m). Pooled fractions containing MoPrP23-231 were diluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.7, 8m urea to a protein concentration of 0.05 mg/ml. CuSO4 was added to a final concentration of 1 μm, and the solution was stirred for 2 h at room temperature. Oxidation was quenched by addition of 1 mmEDTA, and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 6.5 with 0.1m HCl. The solution was dialyzed against water, concentrated to 1 mg/ml, and stored at −20 °C. Alternatively, recombinant mouse PrP23-231 (a gift from R. Glockshuber and co-workers) was purified as described previously (33.Hornemann S. Korth C. Oesch B. Riek R. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Glockshuber R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Amino acid analysis was performed on a Waters PICO-TAG System calibrated in triplicate using a collection of derivatized amino acid standards. Dried MoPrP23-231 was hydrolyzed by a vapor phase using 6 m HCl with 1% phenol at 110 °C for 24 h. After hydrolysis, excess HCl was removed from the hydrolysis tube under vacuum, and the sample was derivatized, dissolved in sample diluent pH (7.4), and an aliquot injected into a Water PICO-TAG column running on a Waters PICO-TAG gradient with a column temperature of 33 °C. For tabulation of individual amino acids, yields are expressed as percentage weight or percentage content with a molecular weight correction for loss of one water molecule per residue. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric (MALDI-TOF-MS) analyses were carried out using a Perspective Biosystem Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (Perspective Biosystems Inc., Farmingham, MA) equipped with a pulsed UV nitrogen laser (337 nm, 3-ns pulse) and a dual microchannel plate detector. For molecular weight determination of full-length MoPrP23-231 protein, spectra were acquired at linear DE mode, acceleration voltage set to 25 kV, grid voltage at 95% of the acceleration voltage, guide wire voltage at 0.150%, delay time at 320 ns, and low mass gate set at 1000 Da; the mass to charge ratio was calibrated with the molecular weight of a mixture of proteins (5734.58 to 16952.56 Da). For analysis of tryptic peptides, the spectra were acquired at reflectron DE mode, acceleration voltage set to 20 kV, grid voltage at 72% of the acceleration voltage, guide wire voltage at 0.050%, delay time at 200 ns, low mass gate set at 250 Da, and the mass to charge ratio was calibrated with the mass of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid ([M + H]+ 379.09 Da) and the molecular weight of a mixture of standard peptides (904.46 to 5734.58 Da). Saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 70% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was used as the matrix for analysis of tryptic peptides, and saturated sinapinic acid in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was used as the matrix for protein analysis. One microliter of solution of MoPrP23-231 or tryptic peptide mixture was applied on the MALDI plate followed by 1 μl of saturated matrix solution. Spectra were recorded after evaporation of the solvent and processed using GRAMS software for data collection and analysis. MoPrP23-231 (1 mg/ml) in 50 μl of S-carbamidomethylation buffer including 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mguanidine hydrochloride was incubated with or without 10 mmDTT at room temperature for 1 h. The reduced or non-reduced MoPrP23-231 was incubated with 50 mm iodoacetamide (IAM) at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. Iodoacetamide reacts with free SH group of cysteine to yield carbamidomethylcysteine. One microliter of MoPrP23-231, reduced or non-reduced MoPrP23-231, treated with IAM was used for MALDI-MS analysis without further purification. Predicted masses were calculated by the Peptide Mass program in ExPASy Home Page. Trypsin digestion was carried out with 1 mg/ml MoPrP23-231 (fresh, stored in water at −20 °C for 6 or 24 months) in 10 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, 1 mmCaCl2. 0.5 μl of modified trypsin solution (Sequencing grade, Promega, 2 mg/ml in 50 mm acetic acid) was added to yield a final pH of 7.5 (enzyme:protein = 1:10). After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, an aliquot (1 μl) of the tryptic peptide mixture was used for MALDI-MS analysis without further purification. Solution tapping mode atomic force microscopy imaging was performed using a combination contact-tapping mode liquid cell fitted to a Digital Instruments Nanoscope IIIA MultiMode scanning probe microscope (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA). All images were acquired using 120-μm silicon nitride V-shaped cantilevers with integral oxide-sharpened pyramidal tips (type DNP-S, Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA). Prior to use, the AFM tips were exposed to UV irradiation to remove adventitious organic contaminants from the tip surface. The AFM images were acquired using the E scanning head, which has a maximum lateral scan area of 14.6 × 14.6 μm. Optimal tapping mode imaging was achieved at a cantilever drive frequency of ∼8.9 kHz with lateral scan rates between 1 and 2 Hz. Under these conditions, the free amplitude of the tip is <3 nm.In situ AFM imaging of the mouse PrP protein was achieved by transferring 5 μl of the MoPrP23-231 sample solution onto freshly cleaved mica previously affixed to an AFM sample puck. The sample was immediately sealed in the AFM liquid cell, and the cell was filled with the sample buffer solution. Image analyses were performed using the Nanoscope software version 4.31 (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA), and NIH Image. MoPrP23-231 was incubated with 7-fold excess (112 μm) CuCl2, NiSO4, ZnCl2 (or without any divalent ion) at room temperature for 4 days. One-half of each sample was digested with PK (MoPrP:PK = 15:1) at 37 °C for 16 h. For negative staining electron microscopy, 5 μl of each sample was applied to 300-mesh pioloform- and carbon-coated copper grids, blotted dry, and stained with 0.1% phosphotungstic acid, pH 7.0. Samples were then examined under a Hitachi 7000 electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 75 kV. Far-UV CD measurements were performed by a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter. By using a cell path length of 1 mm, scans were conducted between 190 or 195 and 250 nm at a scan speed of 20 nm/min with a sensitivity of 50 millidegrees. All CD spectrum measurements were performed at room temperature in 25 mm N-ethylmorpholine, 30 mm KCl (NEMO-KCl) buffer, pH 7.4, as indicated in the figure legends. To assess the solubility of the protein under these conditions, aliquots were removed subsequent to each addition of Cu(II) and centrifuged in a Beckman TL100.3 rotor at 45,000 rpm (100,000 × g) for 30 min. Supernatants were carefully removed, electrophoresed, and stained with Coomassie Blue. Spectra were subject to curve-smoothing and converted into to [θ] mean residue ellipticities, in degree cm2/dmol, based on the protein concentration determined by amino acid analysis using the PICO-TAG system. MoPrP23-231 was incubated with 7-fold molar excess of CuCl2 for 48 h, digested with PK as above, electrophoresed on a 10–20% Tricine-SDS gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained by Coomassie Blue. The membrane was sliced, and individual bands (see text) were sequenced using a Porton Gas-phase Microsequencer model 2090 and on-line phenylthiohydantoin analysis. Subsequent to sacrifice by carbon dioxide inhalation and in accord with the Canadian Council for Animal Care guidelines, brains from Tg(SHaPrP)7+/− heterozygous mice, genotyped by standard methods (36.Prusiner S.B. Scott M. Foster D. Pan K.-M. Groth D. Mirenda C. Torchia M. Yang S.-L. Serban D. Carlson G.A. Hoppe P.C. Westaway D. DeArmond S.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 673-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), were removed and immediately frozen on dry ice. Mouse or normal human brain samples were weighed, suspended in 0.32m sucrose (10% w/v), and homogenized with 6–8 bursts of 10 s each using a Polytron homogenizer set at medium speed. Brain homogenates were then processed to yield microsomes following the method of Meyer et al. (37.Meyer R.K. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Braunfeld M.B. Barry R.A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2310-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). To aid removal of extraneous proteins, microsomal pellets were suspended in distilled water, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C (37.Meyer R.K. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Braunfeld M.B. Barry R.A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2310-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended again in distilled water and stored at −20 °C for further experiments. 40 μl of microsome preparation (at a protein concentration of 0.8 mg/ml) was incubated with or without 140 μm CuCl2, ZnCl2, or NiSO4 at room temperature for 48 h. One-half of each sample was digested with proteinase K (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 60 min. The samples were boiled in Tris glycine-SDS gel loading buffer without β-mercaptoethanol and electrophoresed and blotted as indicated. In initial studies we examined the properties of an N-terminal PrP23-98 fragment of PrPC used previously for equilibrium dialysis binding studies (25.Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J. Madlung A. von Bohlen A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H.A. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This peptide yielded a random coil CD signature (as anticipated (38.Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Lakey J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 39.Miura T. Hori-i A. Takeuchi H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 40.Riek R.

However, Cu(II) exerted a profound influence on the intact GST/PrP23-98 fusion protein, decreasing the α-helical signature ∼3-fold and increasing β-sheet content ∼1.5-fold (as determined by standard algorithms (42.Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 43.Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3310) Google Scholar)). This effect was specific for Cu(II), was not due to aggregation, and was absent from wild-type GST and GST/presenilin 1 fusion protein controls (data not presented). This unexpected finding prompted a study of full-length PrP. For this purpose, recombinant MoPrP23-231 expressed in E. coli was purified to homogeneity, by minor modifications to a previously described protocol (33.Hornemann S. Korth C. Oesch B. Riek R. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Glockshuber R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Of note, oxidation of purified MoPrP23-231 was performed for 2 h at room temperature at a protein concentration of 0.05 mg/ml in 8 m urea at pH 8.7 with 1 μmCuSO4 as a catalyst. After terminating the reaction by addition of 1 mm EDTA, the sample was dialyzed against water to remove urea and thereby promote refolding. MALDI-MS molecular weight analysis of MoPrP23-231 showed a single charged protein signal at m/z 23,108 ± 1.04 Da (Fig.1, A1 and B1), in excellent agreement with the calculated molecular mass of 23,107 Da as [M + H]+. Mouse PrP contains two Cys residues at positions 178 and 213 (44.Locht C. Chesebro B. Race R. Keith J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6372-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To verify that the disulfide bond was present in our recombinant MoPrP23-231, we used theS-carbamidomethylation method. After incubation with or without DTT at pH 8.0 in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, MoPrP23-231 was incubated with iodoacetamide (IAM) and analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. Fig. 1 A1 shows that the mass of MoPrP23-231 is 23,109 Da (predicted mass of [M + H]+ is 23,107 Da). Non-reduced MoPrP23-231 did not react with IAM in that its mass did not change (22,099 Da, within the error limits 0.05% for this method of analysis) (Fig. 1 A2). After reduction with DTT, carbamidomethylated MoPrP23-231 increased in mass by 110–23,209 Da (the predicted gain in mass from two modifications is 114.0 Da and the mass of the di-modified PrP species in the form [M + H]+is 23,223 Da) (Fig. 1 A3). These results indicate one disulfide bridge per molecule of the purified MoPrP23-231; they were also verified by detection of a disulfide-bridged peptide fragment subsequent to trypsin digestion of native rPrP (not shown). Purified MoPrP23-231 migrated as a single band with a molecular mass of 23 kDa upon gel electrophoresis, irrespective of whether it was loaded with or without reducing agent (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). Negro et al. (45.Negro A. De Filippis V. Skaper S.D. James P. Sorgato M.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) reported that the monomers of reduced and non-reduced recombinant PrP migrated with the same mobility on SDS gels but that the non-reduced protein could form multimers, most probably the result of intermolecular disulfide bond formation. Since a low protein concentration was used here for oxidative refolding (to avoid formation of interchain S–S bonds), the absence of multimers in fresh protein preparations was not unexpected (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). However, aged preparations of MoPrP23-231 examined subsequent to storage (lanes 3 and 4) and/or lyophilization (lanes 5 and6) behaved differently and in a manner reminiscent of recombinant chicken PrP (46.Marcotte E.M. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For example, fresh MoPrP23-231 (1 mg/ml) in distilled water was lyophilized, stored at −20 °C for 3 months, and then analyzed. After resuspension in the same volume of distilled water, a band corresponding to a putative dimer was detected (Fig. 2,lanes 5 and 6). With longer periods of storage, the effect was more pronounced. After lyophilization and storage at −20 °C for 8 months, putative dimers, trimers (∼70 kDa), tetramers (∼96 kDa), and yet larger oligomers were observed (Fig. 2,lanes 7 and 8). This phenomenon was apparent in independent preparations of MoPrP23-231. To extend this finding, protein preparations were imaged by in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM), a technique whereby a sharp tip is raster-scanned over a surface, providing a true three-dimensional image of features at molecular scale resolution. In contrast to traditional imaging techniques, AFM enables examination of biomolecular structures and processes under near-native conditions without the need for exhaustive and possibly damaging sample treatments. By using this approach, freshly prepared MoPrP23-231 revealed well formed, discrete, and comparatively uniform ellipsoid pa"
https://openalex.org/W2051870109,"The role of macrophage lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression in atherosclerotic lesion formation was examined in low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR−/−) mice using dietary conditions designed to induce either fatty streak lesions or complex atherosclerotic lesions. First, LDLR−/− mice chimeric for macrophage LPL expression were created by transplantation of lethally irradiated female LDLR−/− mice with LPL−/−(n = 12) or LPL+/+ (n = 14) fetal liver cells as a source of hematopoietic cells. To induce fatty streak lesions, these mice were fed a Western diet for 8 weeks, resulting in severe hypercholesterolemia. There were no differences in plasma post-heparin LPL activity, serum lipid levels, or lipoprotein distribution between these two groups. The mean lesion area in the proximal aorta in LPL−/− → LDLR−/−mice was significantly reduced by 33% compared with LPL+/+→ LDLR−/− mice, and a similar reduction (38%) in lesion area was found by en face analysis of the aortae. To induce complex atherosclerotic lesions, female LDLR−/−mice were lethally irradiated, transplanted with LPL−/−(n = 14), LPL+/− (n = 13), or LPL+/+ (n = 14) fetal liver cells, and fed the Western diet for 19 weeks. Serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels did not differ between the three groups. After 19 weeks of diet, the lesions in the proximal aorta were complex with relatively few macrophages expressing LPL protein and mRNA in LPL+/+ → LDLR−/− mice. Analysis of cross-sections of the proximal aorta demonstrated no differences in the extent of lesion area between the groups, whereas en faceanalysis of the aortae revealed a dose-dependent effect of macrophage LPL on mean aortic lesion area in LPL−/− → LDLR−/−, LPL−/+ → LDLR−/−, and LPL+/+ → LDLR−/− mice (1.8 ± 0.2%, 3.5 ± 0.5% and 5.9 ± 0.8%, respectively). Taken together, these data indicate that macrophage LPL expression in the artery wall promotes atherogenesis during foam cell lesion formation, but this impact may be limited to macrophage-rich lesions. The role of macrophage lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression in atherosclerotic lesion formation was examined in low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR−/−) mice using dietary conditions designed to induce either fatty streak lesions or complex atherosclerotic lesions. First, LDLR−/− mice chimeric for macrophage LPL expression were created by transplantation of lethally irradiated female LDLR−/− mice with LPL−/−(n = 12) or LPL+/+ (n = 14) fetal liver cells as a source of hematopoietic cells. To induce fatty streak lesions, these mice were fed a Western diet for 8 weeks, resulting in severe hypercholesterolemia. There were no differences in plasma post-heparin LPL activity, serum lipid levels, or lipoprotein distribution between these two groups. The mean lesion area in the proximal aorta in LPL−/− → LDLR−/−mice was significantly reduced by 33% compared with LPL+/+→ LDLR−/− mice, and a similar reduction (38%) in lesion area was found by en face analysis of the aortae. To induce complex atherosclerotic lesions, female LDLR−/−mice were lethally irradiated, transplanted with LPL−/−(n = 14), LPL+/− (n = 13), or LPL+/+ (n = 14) fetal liver cells, and fed the Western diet for 19 weeks. Serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels did not differ between the three groups. After 19 weeks of diet, the lesions in the proximal aorta were complex with relatively few macrophages expressing LPL protein and mRNA in LPL+/+ → LDLR−/− mice. Analysis of cross-sections of the proximal aorta demonstrated no differences in the extent of lesion area between the groups, whereas en faceanalysis of the aortae revealed a dose-dependent effect of macrophage LPL on mean aortic lesion area in LPL−/− → LDLR−/−, LPL−/+ → LDLR−/−, and LPL+/+ → LDLR−/− mice (1.8 ± 0.2%, 3.5 ± 0.5% and 5.9 ± 0.8%, respectively). Taken together, these data indicate that macrophage LPL expression in the artery wall promotes atherogenesis during foam cell lesion formation, but this impact may be limited to macrophage-rich lesions. lipoprotein lipase high density lipoprotein very low density lipoprotein low density lipoprotein fetal liver cell polymerase chain reaction Intermediate density lipoprotein, PPAR, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor Lipoprotein lipase (LPL)1 is the rate-limiting enzyme for hydrolysis of lipoprotein triglycerides (1Brunzell J.D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. II. McGraw Hill, Inc, New York1995: 1913-1932Google Scholar). The majority of LPL synthesis occurs in adipose and muscle tissues, and LPL is then transported to the luminal surface of the vascular endothelium where it is bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (2Saxena U. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17516-17521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LPL is also synthesized by macrophages and macrophage-derived foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions (3Yla-Herttuala S. Lipton B.A. Rosenfeld M.E. Goldberg I.J. Steinberg D. Witztum J.L. Proc. Natl.

Invest. 1992; 89: 1544-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). LPL has been proposed to play a dual role in atherogenesis. The efficient lipolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, the promotion of rapid clearance of post-prandial lipoproteins, and the generation of material for HDL formation are viewed as antiatherogenic effects of LPL (5Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In contrast, local LPL activity in the artery wall has been proposed to promote atherosclerosis (6Zilversmit D.B. Circulation. 1979; 60: 473-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar). Recently, LPL has been proposed to influence atherogenesis by mechanisms that are independent from its catalytic actions on the plasma lipoproteins. An increasing amount of evidence indicates that LPL also functions as a ligand, associating with lipoproteins and promoting their binding to the LDLR-related protein (7Beisiegel U. Weber W.

LPL may promote atherogenesis by increasing the binding and retention of LDL cholesterol by proteoglycans of the subendothelial matrix (14Saxena U. Klein M.G. Vanni T.M. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin.

Macrophage-derived foam cells are present in all stages of atherosclerosis and are believed to play an important role in both the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic lesions (17Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19278) Google Scholar). In addition, lesions rich in macrophage-derived foam cells may be more prone to plaque rupture (18Libby P. Geng Y.J. Aikawa M. Schoenbeck U. Mach F. Clinton S.K. Sukhova G.K. Lee R.T. Curr. Opin. Lipid. 1996; 7: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). A number of in vitroexperiments have suggested that macrophage LPL expression may promote foam cell formation (19Saxena U. Kulkarni N.M. Ferguson E. Newton R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1653-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Lindqvist P.L. Ostlund-Lindqvist A.M. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Little J.A. J. Biol.

Recently, we have reported that C57BL/6 mice reconstituted with LPL−/− macrophages develop significantly less atherosclerosis than control mice wild type for macrophage LPL expression (22Babaev V.R. Fazio S. Gleaves L.A. Carter K.J. Semenkovich C.F. Linton M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1697-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated for the first time that macrophage LPL expression promotes foam cell formation and atherosclerotic lesion formation in vivo (22Babaev V.R. Fazio S. Gleaves L.A. Carter K.J. Semenkovich C.F. Linton M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1697-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, C57BL/6 mice clearly have limitations as a model for human atherosclerosis. In response to an atherogenic diet, C57BL/6 mice develop mild hypercholesterolemia with β-VLDL accumulation and modest fatty streak lesions located exclusively in the proximal aorta (23Paigen B. Morrow A. Brandon C. Mitchell D. Holmes P. Atherosclerosis. 1985; 57: 65-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In contrast, LDL receptor-deficient (LDLR−/−) mice have enhanced susceptibility to diet-induced atherosclerosis (24Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar, 25Ishibashi S. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Herz J. Burns D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). On a high fat diet, LDLR−/− mice develop severe hypercholesterolemia with VLDL, IDL, and LDL accumulation and extensive atherosclerotic lesions throughout the aorta (24Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar, 25Ishibashi S. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Herz J. Burns D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the extent of atherosclerosis in LDLR−/−mice can be modulated by varying the duration of the high fat diet, providing the opportunity to study the impact of macrophage LPL expression at different stages of atherosclerotic lesion formation. The effect of LPL-induced lipid changes on atherogenesis has been investigated previously by overexpressing human LPL in LDLR−/− mice. LDL receptor-deficient mice overexpressing human LPL were protected from hypercholesterolemia (26Zsigmond E. Scheffler E. Forte T.M. Potenz R. Wu W. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18757-18766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and on a high fat diet, they had reduced (18-fold compared with the control) atherosclerotic lesions (27Shimada M. Ishibashi S. Inaba T. Yagyu H. Harada K. Osuga J.-I. Ohashi K. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7242-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The results are consistent with a beneficial effect of human LPL overexpression on the plasma lipoprotein profile. The goal of our current study is to examine the role of macrophage LPL in atherogenesis in LDLR−/− mice using dietary conditions designed to induce either fatty streak lesions or complex atherosclerotic lesions. In the current study, the contribution of macrophage LPL expression to atherosclerotic lesion formation was examined in LDLR−/−mice. LDLR−/− mice chimeric for macrophage expression of LPL were generated by transplantation of lethally irradiated LDLR−/− mice with LPL−/−, LPL+/−, and LPL+/+ fetal liver cells (FLC) as a source of hematopoietic cells. The mice were fed the Western diet for 8 or 19 weeks to induce fatty streak lesions or complex atherosclerotic lesions, respectively. Our results demonstrate that macrophage LPL expression promotes atherogenesis during the stage of fatty streak formation. However, the impact of macrophage LPL on the extent of lesion area in the proximal aorta is lost in the setting of complex atherosclerotic lesions. A colony of mice with LPL gene inactivation by homologous recombination (28Coleman T. Seip R.L. Gimble J.M. Lee D. Maeda N. Semenkovich C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12518-12525Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) is established in our facility. Mice heterozygous for inactivation of the LPL gene were at the 7th or higher backcross into the C57BL/6 background. Recipient LDLR−/− mice were originally purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and were at the 10th backcross into the C57BL/6 background. All mice were maintained in microisolator cages on a rodent chow diet containing 4.5% fat (PMI no. 5010, St. Louis, MO) and autoclaved acidified (pH 2.8) water. The Western type diet contains 21% milk fat and 0.15% cholesterol (Teklad, Madison, WI). Animal care and experimental procedures were carried out according to the regulations and under the approval of Vanderbilt University's Animal Care Committee. FLC were obtained and identified as described previously (22Babaev V.R. Fazio S. Gleaves L.A. Carter K.J. Semenkovich C.F. Linton M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1697-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Briefly, female and male LPL+/−mice were mated, the pregnant mice were sacrificed, and embryos were isolated on day 14 of gestation. A single cell suspension of FLC in RPMI medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 2% fetal calf serum (fetal calf serum) was prepared. FLC were counted in a hemocytometer and cryopreserved in RPMI containing 10% Me2SO and 25% fetal calf serum. To identify the LPL genotype and the sex of the fetuses, a PCR reaction with primer sets specific for mouse LPL gene,Neo insert, and Zfy gene of the Y chromosome was performed as described (22Babaev V.R. Fazio S. Gleaves L.A. Carter K.J. Semenkovich C.F. Linton M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1697-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A Rapidcycler (Idaho Technology, Idaho Falls, OH) was used with the following parameters: 40 s at 94 °C for the first cycle, and then 30 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 35 s at 55 °C, and 59 s at 72 °C. Shortly before and for 2 weeks following transplantation, all recipient mice were given 100 mg/liter neomycin and 10 mg/liter polymyxin B sulfate (both from Sigma) in acidified water. FLCs were thawed rapidly, washed in RPMI 1640 containing 2% fetal bovine serum, and counted. Recipient LDLR−/− mice were lethally irradiated (9 Gy) from a cesium gamma source, and 4 h later, 5 × 106cells in 300 μl of RPMI 1640 medium were injected into the tail vein. To verify genotype changes in LDLR−/− mice transplanted with FLC, total RNA was extracted from bone marrow of the mice using an Atlas Pure Total RNA Isolation kit (CLONTECH). RNA was reverse-transcribed by the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase in the presence of RNase inhibitor and random hexamers (all from Promega, Madison, WI) at 37 °C for 60 min. Primers specific for mouse LPL (GTG GCC GAG AGC GAG AAC AT and GCT TTC ACT CGC ATC CTC TC) and β-actin (TCA GAA GGA CTC CTA TGT GG and TCT CTT TGA TGT CAC GCA CG) were used to amplify products of 197 and 500 base pairs, respectively. The LPL primers were designed to span an intron of the gene to distinguish genomic DNA contamination resulting in an 1138-base pair PCR product. Amplification was performed in the Rapidcycler using the following parameters: 40 s at 94 °C for the first cycle, and then 30 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 55 °C, and 1 min 20 s at 72 °C. Mice were fasted for 4 h, and blood samples were collected by retro-orbital venous plexus puncture under metofane anesthesia. Serum was separated by centrifugation, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added (Sigma). The serum total cholesterol and triglycerides were determined using Sigma kit no. 352 and 339 adapted for microtiter plate assay. HDL cholesterol concentration was measured on an automated ACE analyzer using the Direct HDL Test (no. 10981) from Schiapparelli Biosystems, Inc. (Fairfield, NJ). Serum from mice was subjected to fast performance liquid chromatography analysis using a Superose 6 column from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech on a Waters high pressure liquid chromatography system, model 600 (Milford, MA). A 100-μl aliquot of serum was injected onto the column and separated with a buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 mNa2HPO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Forty 0.5-ml fractions were collected and tubes 11–40 were analyzed for cholesterol. After a 4-h fast, mice were injected with 200 units heparin (Sigma), 30 min later blood was drawn from retro-orbital plexus, and the plasma was separated and frozen. LPL enzyme activity was determined as the salt inhibitable ability of triplicate samples to hydrolyze a radiolabeled triolein emulsion as noted (28Coleman T. Seip R.L. Gimble J.M. Lee D. Maeda N. Semenkovich C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12518-12525Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). After 8 or 19 weeks on the Western diet, mice were sacrificed and flushed with saline by injection through the left ventricle. The aorta was dissected from the proximal aorta to the iliac bifurcation, and the aortae were pinned out in anen face preparation as described previously (29Purcell-Huynh D.A. Farese Jr., R.V. Johnson D.F. Flynn L.M. Pierotti V. Newland D.L. Linton M.F. Sanan D.A. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2246-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The heart with the proximal aorta was embedded in OCT and snap-frozen in liquid N2. Cryosections of 10-micron thickness were cut from the region of the proximal aorta starting from the end of the aortic sinus and for 300 μm distally, according to the method of Paigen et al. (30Paigen B. Morrow A. Holmes P.A. Mitchell D. Williams R.A. Atherosclerosis. 1987; 68: 231-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), adapted for computer analysis (31Fazio S. Babaev V.R. Murray A.B. Hasty A.H. Carter K.J. Gleaves L.A. Atkinson J.B. Linton M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4647-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To detect LPL protein and macrophages in the arterial lesions, 5-micron serial cryosections of the proximal aorta were fixed in cold acetone and incubated overnight at 4 °C with either a chicken antibody to recombinant human LPL (a gift of Dr. Lawrence Chan, Baylor College, Houston, TX) reacting with mouse LPL or with monoclonal rat antibody to mouse macrophages, MOMA-2 (Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp., Westbury, NY) (32Kraal G. Rep M. Janse M. Scand. J. Immunol. 1987; 26: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) as described previously (22Babaev V.R. Fazio S. Gleaves L.A. Carter K.J. Semenkovich C.F. Linton M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1697-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A 141-baseHindIII-PstI fragment of the mouse LPL cDNA (a gift of Dr. R. Zechner, University of Graz, Austria) (23Paigen B. Morrow A. Brandon C. Mitchell D. Holmes P. Atherosclerosis. 1985; 57: 65-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the pBlueScript SK (Promega Corp). Antisense and sense riboprobes for LPL were prepared using 35S-uridine (RNA Transcription kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde-phosphate-buffered saline and processed as described previously (22Babaev V.R. Fazio S. Gleaves L.A. Carter K.J. Semenkovich C.F. Linton M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1697-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To examine the relationship between serum cholesterol and the extent of atherosclerosis, linear regression analysis was performed and the correlation coefficient was calculated using the SigmaStat 2.0 program (Jandel Scientific Inc.). Mean serum cholesterol levels representing an average serum cholesterol level for individual mice while on the Western diet were used for analysis of the correlation between serum cholesterol levels and the extent of atherosclerosis in the proximal aorta. The statistical significance of differences in mean aortic lesion areas between the groups were determined using the Student's t test. The role of macrophage LPL expression in atherosclerotic lesion formation was examined in LDLR−/− mice using dietary conditions to induce either fatty streak lesions or advanced atherosclerotic lesions. First, six-week-old female LDLR−/− mice were lethally irradiated (9 Gy) and reconstituted with 5 × 106 FLC from female LPL−/− (n = 9, experimental group) or LPL+/+ (n = 13, control group) embryos. Eight weeks post-transplantation, the mice were challenged with the Western type diet containing 21% fat and 0.15% cholesterol for 8 weeks. Next, 8-week-old female LDLR−/− mice were lethally irradiated and transplanted with 5 × 106 FLC from female LPL−/− (n = 14), LPL+/− (n = 12), or LPL+/+(n = 13, control group) donor mice, and 8 weeks post-transplantation, these mice were fed the Western diet for 19 weeks. A change in macrophage genotype of transplanted mice was verified by reverse transcriptase PCR using total RNA extracted from bone marrow at sacrifice. LPL mRNA expression was detected in bone marrow from cells in LPL+/+ → LDLR−/− but not in LPL−/− → LDLR−/− mice (Fig.1). Eight weeks after transplantation, the mean total serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels did not differ between the groups on a chow diet containing 4.5% fat in either experiment (Tables I and II). When the mice were fed the Western diet, levels of serum cholesterol or triglyceride did not differ between the groups in either experiment (Tables I and II), except for an elevation in serum triglycerides in the LPL+/+ → LDLR−/− mice after 12 weeks of Western diet that did not persist (TableII).Table ITotal serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels in female LDLR −/− mice transplanted with LPL +/+ or LPL −/− fetal liver cellsGroup of animalsSerum lipidBaseline chow diet4 weeks of Western diet8 weeks of Western dietLPL+/+ → LDLR−/−Cholesterol208 ± 6700 ± 24669 ± 24n = 14Triglycerides75 ± 6214 ± 24246 ± 23LPL−/− → LDLR−/−Cholesterol222 ± 5718 ± 41689 ± 40n = 12Triglycerides65 ± 3275 ± 24207 ± 16Values are in mg/dl (mean ± S.E.).

After 8 weeks on the atherogenic diet, size exclusion chromatography revealed similar lipoprotein profiles in both groups, with accumulation of cholesterol in VLDL, LDL, and IDL ranges and the presence of a small HDL peak (Fig. 2 A). The HDL cholesterol levels in LPL−/− → LDLR−/−mice (116 ± 20 mg/dl) did not differ compared with LPL+/+ → LDLR−/− mice (124 ± 14 mg/dl; p = 0.73). A similar cholesterol distribution, with no differences between the main groups, was noted after 19 weeks of Western diet (Fig. 2 B). The mean HDL cholesterol levels decreased in all three groups, and the levels of HDL cholesterol in the LPL+/− → LDLR−/− (66 ± 5 mg/dl) and LPL−/− → LDLR−/− mice (69 ± 4 mg/dl) were not significantly different from the LPL+/+ → LDLR−/− mice (77 ± 4 mg/dl). To analyze the impact of macrophage LPL expression on plasma LPL activity, plasma post-heparin LPL activity was compared in LPL+/+ → LDLR−/− mice (n = 6) and LPL−/− → LDLR−/− mice (n = 3) after 8 weeks on the Western diet. No significant differences in plasma post-heparin LPL activity were detected between LPL+/+ → LDLR−/− and LPL−/− → LDLR−/− mice (221 ± 24 and 241 ± 45 μm free fatty acid /h, respectively). Analysis of aortic sections of the proximal aorta after 8 weeks of the Western diet revealed prominent lesions consisting mainly of foam cells of macrophage origin. Immunocytochemistry studies of the distribution of LPL in the aortic lesions demonstrated that the macrophage-derived foam cells expressed LPL in the lesion area of LPL+/+ → LDLR−/− mice but not in LPL−/− → LDLR−/− mice (data not shown). In contrast, the proximal aorta of mice after 19 weeks of the Western diet contained complicated lesions with relatively few macrophages, which were located predominantly on the luminal side of the lesion (Fig.3 A). Immunocytochemistry revealed that lesion cells staining with the anti-mouse macrophage antibody, MOMA-2 (Fig. 3 A) also reacted with a chicken anti-human antibody to LPL (Fig. 3 C) in LPL+/+→ LDLR−/− and LPL+/− → LDLR−/− mice but not in LPL−/− → LDLR−/− mice (Fig. 3, B and D). These studies demonstrated that the arterial macrophages in the atherosclerotic lesions were donor-derived. Examination of the advanced lesions for LPL mRNA using in situ hybridization demonstrated that macrophages, but not endothelial and smooth muscle cells, expressed LPL in lesions of LPL+/+ → LDLR−/− mice (Fig.4 A). No specific LPL message was detected with the sense control (Fig. 4 B). In the lesion area of LPL−/− → LDLR−/− mice mRNA LPL expression was detected only in myocardial cells (data not shown). Quantitative analysis of the extent of atherosclerosis was performed both by analysis of Oil-Red-O-stained sections of the proximal aorta (22Babaev V.R. Fazio S. Gleaves L.A. Carter K.J.

After 8 weeks on the Western diet, the mean lesion area of cross-sections of the proximal aorta (μm2 ± S.E.) in LPL−/− → LDLR−/− mice (94,026 ± 4864) was reduced by 32.6% compared with LPL+/+ → LDLR−/− mice (139,569 ± 13,244; p< 0.013) (Fig. 5 A). A 38% reduction in lesion area was noted by en face analysis of aortas of LPL−/− → LDLR−/− mice (0.73 ± 0.06%) compared with LPL+/+ → LDLR−/− mice (1.18 ± 0.09%; p < 0.001; Fig. 5 B). The ratio of macrophage area/Oil Red O staining area was 0.71–0.81. There was a significant correlation between the extent of lesion area in the proximal aorta and the aortaen face (n = 16; r = 0.65;p < 0.006; Fig. 5 C). After 19 weeks of the Western diet, visual inspection of the en face aortae revealed a dramatic difference in the extent of atherosclerotic lesions between the groups, with less atherosclerosis in the LPL−/− → LDLR−/− mice (Fig.6). Surprisingly, quantitative analysis of the extent of atherosclerosis in the proximal aorta revealed no differences in the extent of lesion area between LPL+/+ → LDLR−/−, LPL+/− → LDLR−/−, and LPL−/−→LDLR−/− mice with mean lesion areas (μm2 ± S.E.) of 421,303 ± 25,701, 461,243 ± 47,554, and 372,897 ± 46,663, respectively (Fig.7 A). The ratio of macrophage area/Oil Red O-staining area was 0.16–0.22, indicating that the lesions were complex and contained few macrophages. In contrast, quantitative analysis of the of the aortic lesion area by the en face approach revealed a dose-dependent effect of LPL expression by macrophages with a stepwise decrease in the mean aortic lesion area of LPL+/+ → LDLR−/−, LPL+/− → LDLR−/−, and LPL−/−→LDLR−/− mice (5.9 ± 0.8%, 3.5 ± 0.5% and 1.8 ± 0.2%, respectively; Fig.7 B). The extent of atherosclerosis is significantly reduced in LPL+/− → LDLR−/− mice and LPL−/− → LDLR−/− mice compared with LPL+/+→LDLR−/− mice by the Student'st test (p = 0.014 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Furthermore, the extent of atherosclerosis in the LPL−/− → LDLR−/− mice is also significantly reduced compared with LPL+/− → LDLR−/− mice (p = 0.004). There was no correlation between the extent of lesion area in the proximal aorta and the aorta en face (n = 26; r= 0.14; p < 0.50; Fig. 7 C). In both the short and long term experiments, there was no correlation between the mean lesion area in the proximal aorta and serum total cholesterol levels (n = 26; r = 0.36;p = 0.11, and n"

Upon binding to antigen presenting cells, the T cells rapidly undergo cytoskeletal re-organization thus forming a cap at the cell-cell contact site leading to receptor clustering, protein segregation, and cellular polarization. Previously, we reported cloning of the human lymphocyte homologue of theDrosophila Discs Large tumor suppressor protein (hDlg). Here we show that a novel protein termed GAKIN binds to the guanylate kinase-like domain of hDlg. Affinity protein purification, peptide sequencing, and cloning of GAKIN cDNA from Jurkat J77 lymphocytes identified GAKIN as a novel member of the kinesin superfamily of motor proteins. GAKIN mRNA is ubiquitously expressed, and the predicted amino acid sequence shares significant sequence similarity with theDrosophila kinesin-73 motor protein. GAKIN sequence contains a motor domain at the NH2 terminus, a central stalk domain, and a putative microtubule-interacting sequence called the CAP-Gly domain at the COOH terminus. Among the MAGUK superfamily of proteins examined, GAKIN binds to the guanylate kinase-like domain of PSD-95 but not of p55. The hDlg and GAKIN are localized mainly in the cytoplasm of resting T lymphocytes, however, upon CD2 receptor cross-linking the hDlg can translocate to the lymphocyte cap. We propose that the GAKIN-hDlg interaction lays the foundation for a general paradigm of coupling MAGUKs to the microtubule-based cytoskeleton, and that this interaction may be functionally important for the intracellular trafficking of MAGUKs and associated protein complexes in vivo.

Cell. 1991; 66: 451-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Dlg is also present at the synaptic junctions of neurons and is required for the development of synaptic structure at neuromuscular junctions (2Budnik V. Koh Y.H. Guan B. Hartmann B. Hough C. Woods D. Gorczyca M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 627-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Dlg is a prototypical member of a growing family of proteins termed membrane-associatedguanylate kinase homologues (MAGUKs).1 MAGUKs are peripheral membrane proteins composed of either one or three PDZ domains, a single SH3 domain, and a carboxyl-terminal domain that is homologous to guanylate kinases (3Anderson J.M.

Growing evidence indicates that MAGUKs function as scaffolding proteins necessary for the assembly and organization of protein complexes at specialized membrane sites (3Anderson J.M. Curr.

For example, the p55 MAGUK links actin-spectrin-protein 4.1 complexes to the cytoplasmic face of the erythrocyte plasma membrane (6Chishti A.H. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1998; 5: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The adaptor function of p55 is mediated via the interaction of its single PDZ domain and HOOK domain to the cytoplasmic terminus of glycophorin C and the FERM domain of protein 4.1, respectively (7Chishti A.H.

MAGUKs can be broadly classified into several subgroups based on their domain organization: Dlg-like, p55-like, Lin-2 like, and ZO-1-like. Mammalian members of the Dlg subgroup include the PSD-95 (SAP90), Chapsyn-110 (PSD-93), NE-Dlg (SAP102), and hDlg (SAP97) (12Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B.

Neuron. 1996; 17: 255-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). A hallmark of MAGUKs is the presence of a guanylate kinase-like domain of ∼190 residues (16Koonin E.V. Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Nature Genet. 1992; 2: 256-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic guanylate kinases catalyze phosphorylation of GMP to GDP by transferring a phosphate from ATP (16Koonin E.V. Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Nature Genet. 1992; 2: 256-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Initial recognition of the guanylate kinase-like (GUK) domain in MAGUKs raised an interesting possibility that this domain may couple the guanine nucleotide metabolism to the Ras signal transduction pathway (1Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 451-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). However, subsequent studies revealed that the GUK domain of hDlg is enzymatically inactive consistent with the three-amino acid deletion found within its ATP binding A-motif (17Kistner U. Garner C.C. Linial M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Kuhlendahl S. Spangenberg O. Konrad M. Kim E. Garner C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The catalytically inactive GUK domain of SAP97, a rat homologue of hDlg, binds GMP/GDP in vitro but cannot rescue mutations in the yeast guanylate kinase (18Kuhlendahl S. Spangenberg O. Konrad M. Kim E. Garner C.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the GUK domain of the Dlg subfamily of MAGUKs may have evolved to perform a specialized non-enzymatic function in vivo. The first evidence showing GUK domains as specialized protein recognition modules came from the observation that the GUK domains of PSD-95/SAP90 and hDlg/SAP97 associate with a family of proteins termed SAPAPs/GKAP/DAP-1 (19Takeuchi M.

Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Genes to Cells. 1997; 2: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Transfection studies indicate that the GKAPs may be involved in the membrane targeting of MAGUKs in COS epithelial cells (20Kim E. Naisbitt S. Hsueh Y.P. Rao A. Rothschild A. Craig A.M. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the GKAP itself binds to the NH2-terminal guanylate kinase-like domain of a novel protein termed S-SCAM (22Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N. Takeuchi M. Irie M. Yao I. Deguchi M. Toyoda A. Sudhof T.C. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21105-21110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and both PSD-95 and S-SCAM in turn bind to yet another novel protein named MAGUIN (23Yao I. Hata Y. Ide N. Hirao K. Deguchi M. Nishioka H. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11889-11896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because the GKAPs, S-SCAM, and MAGUINs are expressed predominantly in the brain, the proteins that bind to the GUK domain of hDlg/SAP97 in non-neuronal cells remain to be identified. It is noteworthy that the GUK domain of PSD-93/Chapsyn-110 binds to the microtubule-associated protein 1A, and the PSD-93/Chapsyn-110 localizes to the dendritic microtubules of cerebeller Purkinje neurons (24Brenman J.E. Topinka J.R. Cooper E.C. McGee A.W. Rosen J. Milroy T. Ralston H.J. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8805-8813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the binding affinity of full-length PSD-93 to microtubule-associated protein 1A is relatively weak, it was suggested that the accessibility of the GUK domain might be blocked by its intramolecular interactions within PSD-93 (24Brenman J.E. Topinka J.R. Cooper E.C. McGee A.W. Rosen J. Milroy T. Ralston H.J. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8805-8813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the GUK domain may also participate in intermolecular interactions among MAGUKs as indicated by the interaction of SAP102/NE-dlg with the GUK domain of PSD-95 (25Masuko N. Makino K. Kuwahara H. Fukunaga K. Sudo T. Araki N. Yamamoto H. Yamada Y. Miyamoto E. Saya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5782-5790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel protein named BEGAIN (brain-enriched guanylate kinase domain-associated protein) was identified that binds to the GUK domain of PSD-95/SAP90 (26Deguchi M. Hata Y. Takeuchi M. Ide N. Hirao K. Yao I. Irie M. Toyoda A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26269-26272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The physiological function of BEGAIN is not yet known. Together, these studies suggest that the GUK domains of MAGUKs function as specific protein-binding modules. To define the physiological function of the GUK domain in non-neuronal cells, it is necessary to identify and characterize molecules that specifically associate with the GUK domain of MAGUKs. This information is likely to be critical for understanding the role of MAGUKs in subcellular targeting, assembly of signaling complexes, and the regulation of proliferation pathways. In this paper, we demonstrate that a novel kinesin-like motor protein termed GAKIN (guanylate kinase associatedkinesin) binds to the GUK domain of hDlg in T lymphocytes. The direct association of hDlg with a ubiquitously expressed kinesin-like motor may reveal new aspects of hDlg function in neuronal as well as non-neuronal cells. Jurkat J77 cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2.0 mm glutamine (Sigma), 50 units/ml penicillin (Sigma), and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). The monoclonal anti-hDlg antibody was produced using NH2-terminal domain of hDlg as an immunogen. 2A. H. Chishti, unpublished data. The following GST constructs were generated: hDlgΔCT (aa 1–624), ΔNT (aa 201–926 containing the I2 insertion) (13Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The corresponding cDNAs encoding these constructs were cloned into pGEX2T plasmid and expressed as GST fusion proteins in DH5α cells. The GUK domain of human p55 (aa 266–466) was cloned into pGEX2T as described previously (8Marfatia S.M. Leu R.A. Branton D. Chishti A.H. J. Biol.

Fusion proteins were affinity-purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads as described previously (8Marfatia S.M. Leu R.A. Branton D. Chishti A.H. J. Biol.

J77 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 2.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) and the cell lysate was precleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. The GST fusion proteins encoding defined segments of hDlg were immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose beads, and incubated with the cell lysate for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were centrifuged, washed six times with the lysis buffer, and two times with the kinase buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 3.0 mm MnCl2). The in vitro kinase assay was performed at 25 °C by incubating the beads in 100 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min. Radiolabeled proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. Cells were harvested from a 1-liter subconfluent culture of J77 cells and lysed in lysis buffer (see above). The cell lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads bearing the GST-GUK domain of hDlg for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were recovered by centrifugation, washed six times with the lysis buffer, and two times with the PBS. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie Blue-stained bands corresponding to pp250 were cut out from eight lanes, washed three times with 50% acetonitrile/water mixture, and processed for peptide sequencing. Coomassie Blue-stained pp250 bands were subjected to in-gel reduction, carboxyamidomethylation, and tryptic digestion (Promega). Multiple peptide sequences were determined in a single run by Microcapillary Reverse-phase Chromatography directly coupled to a Finnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. The ion trap was programmed to acquire successive sets of three scan modes consisting of full scan MS over alternating ranges of 395–800 or 800–1300m/z, followed by two data-dependent scans on the most abundant ion in those full scans. These data-dependent scans allowed the automatic acquisition of a high resolution (zoom) scan to determine charge state and exact mass, and MS/MS spectra for peptide sequence information. MS/MS spectra were acquired with relative collision energy of 30% and an isolation width of 2.5 daltons. Interpretation of the resulting MS/MS spectra of the peptides was facilitated by programs developed in the Harvard Microchemistry Facility and by data base correction with the algorithm Sequest (27Griffin P.R.

Two peptide sequences (VTLQIPASSLDANR and VILNPVNTNLSK) were obtained by microsequencing of pp250 and were found to match with two ends of one human EST clone (EST52797 and EST52798). Based on the EST sequence, primers (Sense 5′-TCAACGTTGCTTCTCTCTCCT and antisense 5′-AGCCGAAGTGTTTTGCTTATG) were designed to amplify the cDNA fragment from Human Fetal Brain Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH Inc.). A single PCR product of 1.8 kb was cloned using the TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Upstream (5′) and downstream (3′) RACE experiments were performed using the same cDNA pool according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 5′-RACE was performed using primers 5′-GGGATTAATCCAGGTTGGTCAGCTGTG and AP1 for the first PCR and 5′-CTGCAGGATATTCTCTCCAAGGCA and AP2 for the second PCR. The 3′-RACE was performed with primers 5′-CGCTTAAGACAGTGGGCTGAGGAGAGAG and AP1 for the first PCR and 5′-ACAGATTCCAGCCTCCAGCCTGGATGCC and AP2 for the second PCR. The 3′-RACE cDNA probe (1.6 kb) was used to screen a λ ZAP II Jurkat T cell cDNA library (Stratagene Inc.). Combined efforts of successive RACE protocols and cDNA library screening identified overlapping pieces of the full-length cDNA sequence of pp250. The COOH-terminal portion of the coding sequence was found to be identical to the KIAA0639 (29Ishikawa K. Nagase T. Suyama M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The overlapping segments of the full-length cDNA of pp250 were amplified from the cDNA pool by PCR, cloned into a plasmid vector, and sequenced. Several lines of evidence indicate that the reported cDNA encodes an authentic full-length pp250. First, the amino acid sequence of more than 30 peptides derived from the tryptic digest of pp250 matched with the predicted primary structure of the pp250 cDNA sequence. Second, the translation initiation codon of the pp250 cDNA predicts a highly conserved NH2 terminus among the KIF1 subfamily of kinesin superfamily of protein including the Drosophila kinesin-73. Third, the molecular weight of in vitro translated products of defined segments of full-length cDNA predicts a protein of ∼250 kDa in agreement with the estimated mass of pp250 from gel electrophoresis. Finally, the pp250 cDNA was amplified as three overlapping fragments by PCR using human fetal brain cDNA pool (CLONTECH Inc.), and these three cDNA segments predicted the amino acid sequence of full-length GAKIN as shown in Fig.3. Human Multiple Tissue Northern blot I (CLONTECH Inc.) was used for Northern blot analysis according to the manufacturer's protocol. A cDNA fragment of 628 base pairs (nucleotides 3813–4441) of pp250 (GAKIN) cDNA sequence was radiolabeled using DECAprime II kit (Ambion), and used as a probe. Jurkat cell mRNA was isolated using FastTrack 2.0 Kit (Invitrogen Inc.) and a total of 5.0 μg of mRNA was analyzed per lane. For Human Multiple Tissue Northern blot II (CLONTECH Inc.) and Jurkat mRNA, a different cDNA probe (nucleotides 1674–3920 of GAKIN cDNA) was used. The probe was also radiolabeled using DECAprime II kit (Ambion) and purified using Sephacryl S-200HR column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization reaction was performed at 65 °C using ExpressHyb Hybridization Solution (CLONTECH Inc.). Two polyclonal antibodies were raised against the NH2 and COOH termini of GAKIN. For the NH2-terminal antibody, a GST fusion protein encoding 53–487 amino acids of GAKIN was expressed in bacteria. Inclusion bodies containing GST fusion protein were recovered from bacterial lysate and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The corresponding protein band was visualized by staining with 4.0 m sodium acetate and excised from the gel, and used to immunize rabbits. For affinity purification of antibodies, the GST fusion protein was solubilized in 6.0 m urea and renatured by dialyzing in decreasing concentrations of urea. The renatured fusion protein was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To generate polyclonal antibodies against the COOH terminus of GAKIN, the GST fusion protein encoding 1414–1826 amino acids of GAKIN was expressed in bacteria and affinity purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads. The GST portion of the fusion protein was cleaved by digestion with thrombin. Purified protein without GST was used to immunize rabbits. The GST fusion protein was coupled to CNBr-activated beads, and used to affinity purify antibodies from whole serum. J77 cells were lysed in lysis buffer and the cell lysate was precleared as described before. Anti-GAKIN (COOH terminus) serum (10 μl) or an equivalent amount of preimmune serum was incubated with the J77 lysate for 4 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were recovered by centrifugation after incubation with Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) beads for 1.0 h. Beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer and solubilized by boiling in SDS buffer. The GST fusion protein pull-down assay was performed by incubating the cell lysate with 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads that were saturated with GST fusion proteins for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were recovered by centrifugation, washed extensively, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was carried out using an affinity purified polyclonal antibody against the NH2 terminus of GAKIN and a monoclonal antibody against hDlg. Blots were developed using LumiGLO kit (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc.). Defined segments of GAKIN cDNA were cloned into pCITE-2a vector and in vitro transcription and translation reactions were performed using Single Tube Protein System 3 (Novagen). This system utilizes rabbit reticulocyte lysate forin vitro protein synthesis. Protein products were radiolabeled by the addition of [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products Inc.) in the translation reaction. After the completion of protein synthesis, 1.0 μg of RNase A was added to each sample and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The mixture containing translated polypeptides was diluted 10-fold with PBS, 1.0% Triton X-100, divided into two tubes, and incubated with either GST or GST-GUK fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2.0 h at 4 °C. Beads were recovered by centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, incubated in Amplify solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 15 min, and radiolabeld proteins were detected by fluorography. To examine the distribution pattern of CD2 molecules, 4 × 106 J77 cells were incubated with PE-conjugated anti-T11-1 mAb (5–10 μl of T11-RD1, Coulter Immunology) in FACS buffer (PBS + 2% FCS) at 4 °C for 30 min followed by two washes in the same buffer. For CD2 cross-linking, 4 × 106 J77 cells were preincubated with a pair of anti-CD2 mAbs (10 μg/ml anti-T11-2 and 10 μg/ml anti-T11-3) for 30 min at 37 °C, washed two times with FACS buffer, and then stained for CD2 as described above. The cells were then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C for 1.0 h and permeabilized with permeabilization buffer (0.1% saponin (Sigma) in FACS buffer) at 4 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-hDlg mAb (0.6 μg/μl) in permeabilization buffer at 4 °C for 30 min. After three washes in permeabilization buffer and one wash in PBS, the cells were mounted on microscope slides and analyzed under × 40 magnification on a Nikon Diaphot 300 fluoromicroscope equipped with a photometric PXL cooled CCD camera linked to an Oncor imaging analysis system. To analyze the distribution of GAKIN, 4 × 106 J77 cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1.0 h at 4 °C, washed two times with PBS, and permeabilized in 0.1% saponin in PBS + 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 1.0 h. The cells were subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with affinity purified anti-COOH terminus GAKIN polyclonal antibody diluted in permeabilization buffer. The cells were then washed twice in permeabilization buffer and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit mAb (Pierce, 1:700 dilution in permeabilization buffer) for 30 min at 4 °C. After three washes with the permeabilization buffer and one wash in PBS, the cells were analyzed by microscopy as described above. A control for the specificity of the antibody binding was performed using anti-COOH terminus GAKIN antibody previously absorbed with GST fusion protein encoding 1414–1826 amino acids of GAKIN. While investigating the phosphorylation status of hDlg in T lymphocytes by GST pull-down and in vitro kinase assays, we detected a prominent phosphorylated protein of 250 kDa associated with the hDlg protein complex. GST fusion proteins of hDlg lacking either its COOH terminus (GST-ΔCT) or the NH2 terminus (GST-ΔNT) were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with J77 cell lysate (Fig. 1). Protein complexes bound to the beads were collected, washed extensively, and incubated with [γ-32P]ATP to examine for the presence of protein kinase activity associated with the protein complex. Previously we have shown that the NH2 terminus domain of hDlg binds to p56 lck tyrosine kinase in T cells (30Hanada T. Lin L. Chandy K.G. Oh S.S. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26899-26904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, the GST-ΔCT fusion protein of hDlg was phosphorylated by the associated protein kinase (Fig.2 A). In contrast, the GST-ΔNT fusion protein that has similar mobility on SDS gels to that of GST-ΔCT protein but lacks the NH2-terminal p56 lck -binding domain was not phosphorylated under these conditions (Fig. 2 A). Instead, a prominent phosphorylated band of 250 kDa (pp250) was detected in the lane containing the GST-ΔNT protein complex (Fig. 2 A). Based on these results, we concluded that a phosphorylated protein of ∼250 kDa specifically associated with the COOH terminus of hDlg in T lymphocytes. To determine the pp250-binding domain within hDlg, a series of fusion protein constructs of hDlg were made (Fig. 1). Only those fusion proteins that included the GUK domain of hDlg bound to pp250 as tested by the GST pull-down and in vitro kinase assays (Fig.2 B). These results indicate that the pp250 interacts with the GUK domain of hDlg and may be a substrate of the protein kinase activity associated with the protein complex. Since the mobility of pp250 was similar to spectrin, filamin, CBP, P300, mTOR, and ankyrin, proteins that are likely to be involved in hDlg cytoskeletal and signal transduction pathways, we attempted to establish the identity of pp250 by Western blotting. Specific antibodies against the proteins mentioned above failed to identify pp250 suggesting that the pp250 might be a novel protein (data not shown). To purify sufficient quantity of pp250 for biochemical analysis, we used an affinity column of GST-GUK fusion protein of hDlg to isolate pp250 from J77 cells. In vitroprotein kinase assays confirmed the presence of pp250 in the GST-GUK protein complex (data not shown). The Coomassie Blue-stained band of pp250 was excised and processed for peptide sequences as described under “Materials and Methods.” Two peptide sequences that were derived from pp250 matched with a cDNA clone in the human EST data base. A combination of polymerase chain reaction, conventional cDNA library screening, and 5′-, 3′-RACE protocols identified an open reading frame of a novel protein of 1826 amino acids (Fig.3B)"

SETA encodes a variety of adapter proteins containing either one or two SH3 domains, as suggested by the sequence heterogeneity of isolated cDNAs. Using both SH3 domains in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a glial progenitor cell cDNA library, we isolated the rat homolog of the ALG-2-interacting protein 1 or ALG-2-interacting protein X (AIP1/Alix). In vitro confrontation experiments showed that the SH3-N domain of SETA interacted with the proline-rich C terminus of AIP1. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, SETA and AIP1 interacted and could form a complex with apoptosis-linked gene 2 protein. Endogenous SETA and AIP1 proteins showed similar patterns of staining in primary rat astrocytes. Misexpression of a variety of SETA protein isoforms in these astrocytes revealed that they localized to the actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, SETA proteins containing the SH3-N domain were able to sensitize astrocytes to apoptosis induced by UV irradiation. Expression of the isolated SH3-N domain had the greatest effect in these experiments, indicating that interference in the interaction between endogenous SETA and AIP1 sensitizes astrocytes to apoptosis in response to DNA damage.

Furnari F.B. Kindler-Roehrborn A. Sykes V.W. Yung R. Huang H.-J.S. Cavenee W.K. Neuro-Oncology. 2000; 2: 6-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While SETA mRNA is expressed in the developing rodent brain at high levels, it is barely detectable in the adult rat or mouse cortex or in normal human brain. However, approximately half of all experimentally induced rat gliomas as well as human astrocytomas of grade II, III, and IV express the gene, and it is also found in oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas (1.Bogler O. Furnari F.B. Kindler-Roehrborn A. Sykes V.W. Yung R. Huang H.-J.S. Cavenee W.K. Neuro-Oncology. 2000; 2: 6-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of SETA in a culture model of astrocytoma progression based on astrocytes from p53 knockout mice (2.Bogler O. Huang H.J. Cavenee W.K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2746-2751PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Bogler O. Nagane M. Gillis J. Huang S.H.-J. Cavenee W.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 73-86PubMed Google Scholar) was closely associated with the ability of these cells to form tumors when reintroduced into animals (1.Bogler O. Furnari F.B. Kindler-Roehrborn A. Sykes V.W. Yung R. Huang H.-J.S. Cavenee W.K. Neuro-Oncology. 2000; 2: 6-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this model system, SETA shared expression patterns with established glioma-associated genes including epidermal growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptors α and β, vascular endothelial cell growth factor, and protein kinase C-δ (3.Bogler O. Nagane M. Gillis J. Huang S.H.-J. Cavenee W.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 73-86PubMed Google Scholar). These expression data suggest that the re-expression of the SETA protein in astrocytes in the mature central nervous system contributes to their malignant transformation and progression, prompting an investigation of its mode of action at the molecular level. The SETA gene encodes proteins that contain SH3 domains, which are involved in high affinity, specific protein-protein interactions. While these domains are found in proteins with enzymatic function, such as Src kinase, they are also common in adapter molecules whose function is to promote the interaction of members of signal transduction pathways. SETA appears to belong in this group and to be a member of a new subfamily of adapter molecules that includes the CD2AP and CMS proteins (4.Dustin M.L. Olszowy M.W. Holdorf A.D. Li J. Bromley S.

Ishimura S. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6211-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In addition to SH3 domains, these proteins appear to have coiled-coil motifs at their C termini and two PXXP motifs, which are themselves the cognates of SH3 domains. Therefore, they appear to have at least three modalities of binding to other proteins, suggesting involvement in a complex series of protein-protein interactions. While CD2AP has been shown to interact with the CD2 molecule in T-cells (4.Dustin M.L. Olszowy M.W. Holdorf A.D. Li J. Bromley S. Desai N. Widder P. Rosenberger F. van der Merwe P.A. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1998; 94: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), CMS has been shown to interact with actin, p130 cas, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase,src family kinases, and Grb2 (5.Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.-M. Ishimura S. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6211-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), suggesting that this family of proteins may play a role in cell architecture and mitogenic signaling. As a first step toward understanding the function of SETA, we have taken the direct approach of isolating a binding partner with a yeast two-hybrid library screen. The protein we isolated is the rat homolog of the mouse gene, apoptosis-linked gene 2 (ALG-2)-interacting protein 1 or ALG-2-interacting protein X (AIP1/Alix), which was recently isolated by two groups performing yeast two-hybrid screens with the ALG-2 (6.Missotten M. Nichols A. Rieger K. Sadoul R. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 7.Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In vitro confrontation and co-immunoprecipitation from transiently transfected cells demonstrated that the SH3-N domain of SETA interacts with the proline-rich C terminus of AIP1 and that SETA, AIP1, and ALG-2 can form a complex. ALG-2 was originally isolated in a “death trap” screen in T-cells, and an antisense ALG-2 cDNA promoted survival after apoptosis had been induced by a variety of stimuli (8.Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Conversely, when ALG-2 was overexpressed in fibroblasts it sensitized them to cell death. Therefore, it has been suggested that the 22-kDa calcium-binding protein ALG-2 is a necessary component of the apoptotic machinery (8.Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). AIP1 is a 105-kDa protein with a proline-rich C terminus that has 10 PXXP sequence motifs of the kind that bind to SH3 domains (7.Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). While the mechanism of action of AIP1 alone or in conjunction with ALG-2 is not understood, it is clear that perturbing the levels of these proteins in a variety of cells alters their response to apoptotic stimuli without affecting the background level of apoptosis (7.Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 8.Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that these genes are expressed in astrocytes and glioma cells, which also express endogenous SETA proteins. Furthermore, introducing SETA proteins capable of binding to AIP1 sensitized astrocytes to UV light-induced cell death, while control cells or those expressing a part of the SETA protein that does not bind AIP1 had no effect. These data suggest that SETA, AIP1, and ALG-2 represent a new set of proteins with a role in modulating apoptosis in astrocytes and with a potential role in the formation of gliomas. The SETA SH3-NC bait construct insert was generated by polymerase chain reaction from a cDNA template using proofreading DeepVent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), and the absence of mutations was confirmed by sequencing. It included amino acids 24–258 (ERQRR … LPSDF; see Fig.2 A) according to the numbering of the longer SETA isoform described in Ref. 1.Bogler O. Furnari F.B. Kindler-Roehrborn A. Sykes V.W. Yung R. Huang H.-J.S. Cavenee W.K. Neuro-Oncology. 2000; 2: 6-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and GenBankTMAF131867. This insert was introduced into the pBD-GAL4 phagemid vector (Stratagene) and was used to screen a CG4 rat glial progenitor cell library (1.Bogler O. Furnari F.B. Kindler-Roehrborn A. Sykes V.W. Yung R. Huang H.-J.S. Cavenee W.K. Neuro-Oncology. 2000; 2: 6-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) previously constructed in HybriZAP and rescued into the pAD-GAL4 plasmid form (Stratagene). Two rounds of yeast colony screening for the ability to grow in the absence of histidine and for a positive β-galactosidase reaction were performed. Isolated plasmids were sequenced, and the sequences were compared with gene data bases. SETA SH3 cDNAs (see legend to Fig. 2 A for details) were cloned in frame into pGEX-KG, and glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were generated and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The plasmid encoding the ALG-2 GST fusion protein (pGEX-ALG-2) as well as mouse AIP1 (pCDNA3-AIP1) were obtained from Luciano D'Adamio and have been described previously (7.Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). [3H]Leucine-labeled AIP1 and β-galactosidase were generated by coupled in vitrotranscription and translation (TNT; Promega) and confronted with an excess of SETA or ALG-2 GST fusion proteins in 20 mm Tris, pH 7, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.96 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, which contains 5 μm free calcium. Complexes were collected using glutathione-Sepharose 4B, washed in several changes of buffer, and separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which was prepared for fluorography and exposed to film. SETA cDNAs (see legend to Fig. 2 A for details) were cloned in frame into pcDNA4-Xpress/His (SH3-N, SH3-C, and coiled coil (SETA NCcc)) or pcDNA6-V5/His (SETA SH3-NC, -N, and -NC), which provide the X-press or V5 epitope tag, respectively (Invitrogen). These plasmids were then co-transfected into 293 cells with murine AIP1-FLAG, obtained from Luciano D'Adamio, by the calcium phosphate method. Two days after transfection, cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and immunoprecipitates were generated using monoclonal antibodies directed against the V5, Xpress (Invitrogen), or FLAG (Sigma) epitopes and collected on protein A-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Precipitates were also generated using bacterially made ALG-2 GST fusion protein, as described above. Precipitates were Western blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane; exposed to V5, Xpress, FLAG, or anti-SETA antibodies; and detected by chemiluminescence (Bio-Rad). Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated using poly(dT) beads (Oligotex, Qiagen), and known amounts were subjected to Northern blotting. Membranes were hybridized with random primed 32P-labeled (Prime-It; Stratagene) probes derived from murine AIP1 and ALG-2 cDNAs provided by Luciano D'Adamio. Initial attempts at obtaining astrocytes expressing SETA proteins encoded by pCDNA vectors resulted in the isolation of clones that showed low levels and percentages of expression. Therefore, pcDNA4-Xpress/His (SETA NCcc)- and pcDNA6-V5/His (SETA SH3-NC, -N, and -C)-derived inserts including the vector-derived epitope tags were recloned into a retroviral vector, 1726/zeo. This retrovirus is a modification of 1726, itself a modification of LNL6 encoding theneo gene, an encephalomyocarditis virus-derived internal ribosome entry site (9.Sugimoto Y. Aksentijevich I. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the lacZ gene. TheSpeI (870)–XbaI (7093) fragment of 1726 was isolated using a partial XbaI cut and inserted intoSpeI XbaI double-digested LNCX (another LNL6 derivative modified by, and a kind gift from, Dr. Bob Navaiaux), which lacked the EcoRI site at position 1 of LNL6. After removal of the neo gene by EcoRI digestion and religation, this left a single EcoRI site immediately downstream of the packaging signal for the insertion of genes of interest. The lacZ gene was removed and replaced by a polymerase chain reaction-generated zeo gene, derived from pSV40/Zeo (Invitrogen), inserted in frame with the internal ribosome entry site using NcoI and XhoI restriction enzymes to generate 1726/zeo. SETA cDNAs derived from pCDNA plasmids were inserted blunt into EcoRI-digested and blunted 1726/zeo, and their orientation was determined by sequencing. Pseudotyped retrovirus was generated by transient co-transfection of 293GP cells with an expression plasmid encoding vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (10.Bartz S.R. Vodicka M.A. Methods. 1997; 12: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and 1726/zeo constructs. Primary rat astrocytes were plated at a density of 50,000 cells in a 25-cm2 tissue culture flask and infected the following day with SETA-encoding retrovirus for 4 h in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene. Two days later, cells were passaged and replated in a 75-cm2 tissue culture flask and exposed to 300 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). Cultures were maintained until uninfected control cultures contained no viable cells, typically 7–10 days, at which point they were harvested and replated at nominal passage 1. Cells were maintained in 300 μg/ml zeocin at all times and analyzed for expression by Western blot by chemiluminescence detection (Bio-Rad) and immunohistochemistry using standard protocols. Polyclonal anti-SETA antibodies are as described (1.Bogler O. Furnari F.B. Kindler-Roehrborn A. Sykes V.W. Yung R. Huang H.-J.S. Cavenee W.K. Neuro-Oncology. 2000; 2: 6-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-AIP1 antibodies were obtained from Pasquale Vito, and are as described previously (7.Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry was performed on fixed cells grown on coverslips and with ALEXA (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated (Southern Biotechnology Associates) secondary antibodies. Cells were counterstained with phalloidin-rhodamine or anti-paxillin antibodies (Sigma). For analysis of apoptosis, cultures of astrocytes growing on coverslips in 6-cm tissue culture dishes with 5 ml of medium were exposed to 5 mJ/cm2 of UV irradiation in a GS Genelinker UV chamber (Bio-Rad). Coverslips were removed 24 h later and prepared for analysis with annexin V (Pharmingen Becton-Dickinson) or TUNEL (Roche Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The SETA gene encodes an adapter molecule with SH3 domains, suggesting that it functions by binding with high affinity and specificity to other proteins. Therefore, a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library screen was performed to isolate potential binding partners of SETA. A bait construct encoding the two SH3 domains of SETA and the intervening sequence (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”), fused in frame to the DNA binding domain of the GAL4, was used to screen a CG4 glial progenitor cell line cDNA library. SETA was originally isolated from these cells (1.Bogler O. Furnari F.B. Kindler-Roehrborn A. Sykes V.W. Yung R. Huang H.-J.S. Cavenee W.K. Neuro-Oncology. 2000; 2: 6-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), making it likely that physiologically relevant binding partners would be represented. Analysis of only 250,000 co-transfectants led to the isolation of eight positive clones after two rounds of screening. Sequence analysis revealed that they represented two overlapping cDNAs for the rat homolog of the mouse AIP1/Alix gene (Fig.1), which had been previously isolated as a binding partner of ALG-2 (6.Missotten M. Nichols A. Rieger K. Sadoul R. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 7.Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the partial rat cDNA clone isolated by us (Fig. 1) was only one amino acid shorter than the mouse cDNA isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening with ALG-2 (7.Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), suggesting that the same region of AIP1 interacts with both ALG-2 and SETA. Examination of the predicted protein sequence of the partial rat AIP1 cDNA revealed extensive sequence homology to the mouse AIP1 molecule (Fig. 1). Both predicted proteins encoded a proline-rich region, from amino acid 719 to the C terminus, in which close to 30% of the residues are proline, as compared with an overall frequency of 8% proline in the long form of AIP1 (6.Missotten M. Nichols A. Rieger K. Sadoul R. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 7.Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Ten PXXP motifs, such as are found at the core of SH3 binding peptides (11.Mayer B.J. Eck M.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), can be found in this sequence, suggesting that it represents the region that interacts with SETA. Interestingly, although the rodent AIP1 proteins are highly homologous to the Xenopus geneXp95 (12.Che S. El-Hodiri H.M. Wu C.F. Nelman-Gonzalez M. Weil M.M. Etkin L.D. Clark R.B. Kuang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5522-5531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the similarity is dramatically reduced in this proline-rich region (Fig. 1). To establish whether SETA and AIP1 can interact outside of the yeast two-hybrid system, in vitro confrontation experiments were performed. Bacterially generated GST fusion proteins, encoding either one or both of the SETA SH3 domains (Fig.2 A) or the ALG-2 molecule, were confronted with radiolabeled AIP1 made by coupled in vitro transcription and translation (Fig. 2 B) and then collected on glutathione-Sepharose. The SETA SH3-NC encoding GST fusion protein (Fig. 2 A), which contains the same region of SETA as was used in the bait construct employed in the yeast two-hybrid screen, interacted with AIP1 in vitro (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, the isolated N-terminal SETA SH3 domain, fused to GST, was able to bind to mouse AIP1 in these experiments (Fig. 2 B). However, the C-terminal SH3 domain did not bind to AIP1 (Fig.2 A), which was not due to a general lack of function of this fusion protein, since it has been shown to bind to another novel SETA binding protein recently isolated in our laboratory (data not shown). As expected from previous studies, the ALG-2 protein was able to bind full-length AIP1 in this assay (6.Missotten M. Nichols A. Rieger K. Sadoul R. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 7.Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In contrast to the interaction between ALG-2 and AIP1, the SETA SH3-N protein was able to bind AIP1 in the absence of calcium, as would be expected from an SH3 domain-mediated interaction. Last, none of the GST fusion proteins interacted with radiolabeled β-galactosidase protein (Fig.2 B). The use of isolated SETA SH3 domains in these experiments provides the most precise definition of which regions of this protein are capable of interacting with AIP1, as functionality depends on correct folding of the SH3 domain, requiring the presence of their entire sequence. However, we were able to further define the region of AIP1 that bound to SETA by determining that neither the SH3-NC nor SH3-N proteins were able to interact with a truncated AIP1 protein, terminating at the internal EcoRI site at position 636 (Fig. 1), which lacks the proline-rich region of AIP1 (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that the interaction between SETA and AIP1 can occur outside of yeast and is mediated by SETA's N-terminal SH3 domain and AIP1's proline-rich C terminus. To test whether SETA and AIP1 also interact in cells, epitope-tagged proteins were transiently introduced into 293 cells, which can be transfected at high efficiency, and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (Fig. 2 C). A FLAG-tagged AIP1 cDNA was co-transfected with a C-terminally V5-tagged SETA SH3-NC expression construct, an N-terminally Xpress-tagged SETA NCcc construct or control lacZ constructs tagged with either epitope tag. Although in our hands the V5 epitope tag performed better in all experiments than the Xpress tag, the latter was chosen to tag SETA NCcc N-terminally in order to minimize the possibility of interfering with the structural integrity of the predicted C-terminal coiled-coil. Precipitates from the resultant lysates were collected with anti-V5, anti-Xpress, or anti-FLAG antibodies or with bacterially made ALG-2-GST. The resultant precipitates were then analyzed in Western blots probed with anti-V5, anti-Xpress, anti-SETA, or anti-FLAG antibodies. Antibodies against epitope tags were used in these experiments to specifically study transfected isoforms of SETA. In order to establish that immunoprecipitation with these antibodies recovered the transfected SETA proteins, lysates of 293 cells transfected with SETA SH3-NC and SETA NCcc were precipitated by anti-V5 or anti-Xpress antibodies, respectively, and immunoblotted with polyclonal anti-SETA antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2 C, lanes 1 and 2, bands of the expected size were obtained, demonstrating that these reagents were specifically recovering SETA proteins. Analysis of anti-Xpress-generated immunoprecipitates of cells transfected with AIP1-FLAG and SETA NCcc revealed a band of the size expected for the AIP1 protein (Fig. 2 C, lane 3), which was not present in lysates of cells transfected with the lacZ control construct (Fig. 2 C,lane 4). Bands common to both lanes 3 and 4 are anti-FLAG antibody cross-reacting proteins. To further support the suggestion that SETA and AIP1 interact in cells, lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies recognizing AIP1. SETA SH3-NC or SETA NCcc was detected in these lysates with anti-V5 or anti-Xpress antibody, respectively (Fig.2 C, lanes 5 and 6). Therefore, complexes of AIP1 and SETA proteins could be recovered by immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed at either protein. To test whether SETA and AIP1 could bind to ALG-2 in one complex, we precipitated lysates with bacterially made GST-ALG-2 protein. In line with previous studies, GST-ALG-2 could precipitate AIP1-FLAG from cell lysates (Fig. 2 C, lane 7) (7.Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these lysates also contained SETA SH3-NC or SETA NCcc protein (Fig. 2 C, lanes 8 and9). Taken together, these data suggest that SETA and AIP1 can interact in cells. Furthermore, the detection of SETA proteins in precipitates made with GST-ALG-2, which does not interact directly with SETA, suggests that these two proteins can interact with AIP1 simultaneously. The observation that SETA, AIP1, and ALG-2 can interact raises the question of whether they are co-expressed in cells. SETA was originally identified as a gene associated with malignancy in astrocytes and is expressed in p53−/−astrocytes derived from p53 knockout mice capable of forming tumors as well as glioma-derived cell lines. Therefore, we analyzed these cells, as well as normal rat astrocytes expressing various SETA protein isoforms (see below), for AIP1 and ALG-2 mRNA expression. As shown in Fig. 3, all of the cells tested expressed AIP1 and ALG-2 mRNA. Two AIP1 mRNA species were observed, with one just below the 28 S at about 4 kb and one above the 28 S at approximately 7 kb, as described previously (7.Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). ALG-2 mRNA ran as a single band below the 18 S at approximately 1 kb (8.Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). AIP1 and ALG-2 expression did not correlate with the ability of p53−/− astrocytes to form tumors, since similar levels of expression were found in cells grown in DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum or in DMEM plus 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, which are capable of forming tumors, and DMEM plus 10% basic fibroblast growth factor, which are not (3.Bogler O. Nagane M. Gillis J. Huang S.H.-J. Cavenee W.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 73-86PubMed Google Scholar). Rat astrocytes with a normal p53 genotype also expressed both AIP1 and ALG-2 mRNA, regardless of whether they had been engineered to express SETA constructs or vector alone (see below). Last, both genes were also expressed in a rat glioma cell line, GV2C8, and two human glioma cell lines, LNZ308 and A172, all known to express SETA mRNA (1.Bogler O. Furnari F.B. Kindler-Roehrborn A. Sykes V.W. Yung R. Huang H.-J.S. Cavenee W.K. Neuro-Oncology. 2000; 2: 6-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that SETA, AIP1, and ALG-2 are co-expressed in a variety of cells relevant to the study of glial cell transformation and so have the opportunity to interact. To directly examine the question of whether the association of SETA with the known regulators of apoptosis ALG-2 and AIP1 allows it to modulate this process, primary rat astrocyte cell lines that expressed various SETA protein forms (shown in Fig.2 A) were established. Initial experiments in astrocytes demonstrated that the the plasmid expression vectors used in 293 cells (Fig. 2 C) did not achieve high enough efficiencies of transient transfection or maintain stable expression of SETA or control proteins in this cell type. Therefore, the epitope-tagged SETA cDNAs were engineered into a retroviral expression construct immediately downstream of the packaging signal and upstream of an internal ribosome entry site and the gene for zeocin resistance (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). Infection of primary rat astrocytes with retroviruses generated from these constructs and selection with zeocin for 10 days resulted in populations of cells that showed greater than 98% expression of SETA proteins, which was stable over time, as determined by immunohistochemistry (data not shown). All further experiments were performed with these selected cell populations, thereby eliminating issues relating to clonal variation. Populations of astrocytes engineered with SETA SH3-NC in the antisense orientation or with vector alone were also isolated as controls. All of these populations expressed endogenous AIP1 and ALG-2 mRNA (Fig.3). Western blotting of zeocin-selected rat astrocyte populations with a polyclonal anti-SETA antibody revealed expression of endogenous SETA that increased with time in culture (Fig.4). Astrocytes cultured for fewer than five passages after the completion of selection showed variable, low levels of endogenous SETA, with bands near 60, 95, and 180 kDa (Fig. 4,lanes 1–6). At higher than 10 passages, the level of endogenous SETA was increased, as demonstrated by the inclusion of cell extract of high passage SETA NCcc-expressing astrocytes on the same Western blot as the low passage cells (Fig. 4,lane 7). This higher level of SETA expression was found in all cel"

The dynamic composition of the signaling complexes and the role of the scaffold protein AKAP250 (gravin) in agonist-induced attenuation and recovery of β-adrenergic receptors were explored by co-immunoprecipitation of target elements, antisense suppression, and confocal microscopy. Gravin associated with unstimulated receptor, and the association was increased significantly after agonist stimulation for up to 60 min.

G-protein-linked receptors G-protein-linked receptor kinase A kinase-anchoring protein green fluorescent protein 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid G-protein-linked receptors (GPLRs)1 display attenuation of the receptor-mediated signal or “desensitization” and then “resensitization” after removal of agonist (1.Hausdorff W.P.

Protein phosphorylation is a critical element of agonist-induced desensitization involving at least three prominent kinase activities: cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A), calcium- and phospholipid-sensitive protein kinase (protein kinase C), and members of the G-protein-linked receptor kinase family (GRK) such as the β-adrenergic receptor kinases (2.Shih M.

Recent studies have revealed that protein kinase-anchoring and scaffold proteins are essential elements in many aspects of cell signaling (11.Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V.

Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). Anchoring proteins bind to subcellular structures and localize their complement of enzymes/adaptor proteins close to their site of action. For example, protein kinase A is targeted to its substrate by association with A kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) (13.Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C is tethered to the cytoskeleton or at submembranous sites through association with a family of substrate binding proteins called receptors for activated protein kinase C (12.Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Scaffold proteins (e.g. Ste5p and AKAP79) simultaneously associate with several kinases/phosphatases or other components of a signaling pathway, forming an ordered module that permits sequential activation of each enzyme and the recruitment of other components (13.Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). AKAP250 (gravin) is a unique AKAP protein that displays protein kinase/phosphatase-binding motifs, associates with protein kinases A and C and phosphatase 2B (15.Nauert J.B. Klauck T.M. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 52-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and serves as a scaffold protein in signal transduction. Gravin is expressed in endothelial cells and several other adherent cell types in vitro (16.Grove B.D. Bowditch R. Gordon T. del Zoppo G. Ginsberg M.H. Anat. Rec. 1994; 239: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and the expression of gravin can be induced in human erythroleukemia cells by phorbol ester (15.Nauert J.B. Klauck T.M. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 52-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Immunolocalization experiments show that gravin is concentrated at the cell periphery and is enriched in filopodia of erythroleukemia cells (16.Grove B.D. Bowditch R. Gordon T. del Zoppo G. Ginsberg M.H. Anat. Rec. 1994; 239: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that gravin is expressed in human epidermoid carcinoma (as well as hamster smooth muscle cells) and is found in association with β2-adrenergic receptors (17.Shih M. Lin F. Scott J.D. Wang H.-y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1588-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Inhibition of gravin expression by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides disrupts receptor resensitization (17.Shih M. Lin F. Scott J.D. Wang H.-y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1588-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In the current work, we studied the role of gravin in the formation of signaling complexes involved in agonist-induced GPLR desensitization and resensitization. Gravin was found to be essential to the organization of the signaling complexes composed of protein kinases/phosphatases, β-arrestin, and clathrin. Blocking the expression of gravin by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides inhibited the association of the β2-adrenergic receptor with GRK2, β-arrestin, and clathrin. Gravin deficiency blocked the sequestration and resensitization of β2-adrenergic receptors. Human epidermoid carcinoma cells (A431) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 60 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. The number of β2-adrenergic receptors was determined by radioligand binding. Intact A431 cells were incubated with 0.5 nm[125I]iodocyanopindolol (NEN Life Science Products) in the presence or absence of 10 μm propranolol at 23 °C for 90 min. The incubation buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 150 mmNaCl (2.Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The cells were collected on GF/C membranes at reduced pressure and washed rapidly. The radioligand bound to the washed cell mass retained by the filter was quantified by use of a γ-counter. Receptor sequestration was assayed using the hydrophilic, membrane-impermeable β-adrenergic antagonist [3H]CGP-12177 (NEN Life Science Products) (17.Shih M. Lin F. Scott J.D. Wang H.-y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1588-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). A431 cells were preincubated with isoproterenol (10 μm) for periods up to 60 min or preincubated with isoproterenol for 30 min, followed by washing and a second, post-wash incubation for 60 min. The cells were then resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 70 nm[3H]CGP-12177 at 4 °C for 6 h. The cells were diluted, collected on GF/C membranes, and washed rapidly. The radioligand bound to the washed cell mass retained on the filter was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Nonspecific binding is defined as the radioligand binding insensitive to competition by the unlabeled β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (10 μm). Two days prior to the analysis, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 20,000 cells/well. Cells were washed and challenged with or without 10 μm isoproterenol for periods up to 60 min at 37 °C. At the end of the first challenge, cells were washed three times and incubated in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing Ro 20-1724 (0.1 mm; Calbiochem) and adenosine deaminase (0.5 unit/ml) for 5 min prior to (and included in) the second challenge with 1 μm agonist. For resensitization, isoproterenol-treated cells were washed free of agonist and maintained in buffer without phosphodiesterase inhibitor for 60 min after the first challenge. Five minutes before the second challenge of the agonist, cells were incubated again in the presence of Ro 20-1724 and adenosine deaminase. The agonist-induced cyclic AMP production within 5 min of incubation in the second challenge was determined as described (2.Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18.Pippig S. Andexinger S. Daniel K. Puzicha M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3201-3208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data are calculated as percent desensitization, where “100% desensitization” reflects no cyclic AMP accumulation in response to a second challenge with the agonist. “0% desensitization” indicates that a cyclic AMP response to a second challenge is equivalent to that obtained in response to the first challenge. Antisense and control missense oligodeoxynucleotides with the same base composition, but in scrambled order, were synthesized and purified to cell culture-grade (Operon Technologies, Inc., Alameda, CA) as described (2.Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Before addition to cells, oligodeoxynucleotides were mixed at a ratio of 1:3 (w/w) withN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl sulfate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), a cationic diacylglycerol in liposomal form that serves as a delivery vehicle. A431 cells were treated with oligodeoxynucleotides (5 μg/ml) for at least 48–72 h prior to the analysis of the expression of the target molecule. Cells in which gravin or protein kinase C was specifically suppressed by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were then analyzed for the association of the β2-adrenergic receptor with arrestin, GRK2, and clathrin as well as for receptor sequestration as determined by binding of the hydrophilic, cell-impermeable ligand CGP-12177 as described (2.Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and by confocal microscopy of the autofluorescent emission of the green fluorescence protein (GFP)-tagged form of the β2-adrenergic receptor. For studies of β-arrestin, A431 cells were scanned first for expression of β-arrestin isoforms, and only β-arrestin isoform-2 was detected (data not shown). Suppression of β-arrestin required the use of S-modified oligodeoxynucleotides antisense to β-arrestin-2 (5′-CCCATAGGTGCGGCGCCC-3′), using a sequence in the 5′-untranslated region of the gene as a target. The missense oligodeoxynucleotides of the same base composition wereS-modified (5′-ACTCCGATGCGGGGCCCC-3′) and employed as indicated above. Antibodies used in studies of β-arrestin were a generous gift of Dr. J. L. Benovic (Kimmel Cancer Institute, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). Cells were harvested and homogenized in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Nuclei were removed by low speed centrifugation. Twenty or fifty micrograms of post-nuclear fraction protein/lane was subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Separated proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 10% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and incubated with primary antibodies specific for a signal element. After washing, the blots were incubated with a second anti-mouse/rabbit IgG antibody labeled with peroxidase, and the blots were developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (NEN Life Science Products). Polyclonal anti-GRK2 and anti-clathrin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal anti-β-arrestin antibody was a generous gift from Dr. J. L. Benovic, and polyclonal anti-gravin antibody was a generous gift from Dr. J. D. Scott (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Vollum Institute, Portland, OR). Quantification of immunoblotting data was performed using a Bio-Rad imaging densitometer fitted with Discovery imaging software (Bio-Rad). The association of the β2-adrenergic receptor with other target signaling proteins was probed by analysis of immunoprecipitations. Cells were harvested and subjected to lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet-40, 10 μm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml bacitracin, 100 μg/ml benzamidine, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm sodium molybdate, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Immunoprecipitation reactions were performed with antibodies in lysis buffer. The lysates were precleared with protein A/G-agarose for 90 min and then subjected to immunoprecipitation for 2 h with antibodies specific either for the β2-adrenergic receptor (CM-4) or for AKAP250 (gravin). The primary antibodies were linked covalently to a protein A/G-agarose matrix. The variance of immunoprecipitation, sample loading, and/or immunoblotting in these experiments in the aggregate was established within 10%. Protein kinase A and C activities were assessed using commercially available assays (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. Protein kinase A activity is defined as the amount of phosphate incorporated into a substrate peptide (Kemptide) in the presence of 10 μm cyclic AMP minus any activity incorporated in the presence of the protein kinase A inhibitor peptide (1 μm). The specific activity of protein kinase C is defined as the difference between the amount of phosphorylation of an acetylated peptide derived from myelin basic protein in the presence of 10 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and the amount of phosphorylation occurring in the presence of 20 μmprotein kinase C inhibitory peptide (protein kinase Cα peptide-(19–36)). For protein phosphatase 2B, two complementary techniques were employed for assay: immunostaining with antibodies to the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2B (C26920, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) and identification by the calmodulin overlay assay. Calmodulin binding to the renatured SDS-polyacrylamide gel (overlay) is detected using antibodies to calmodulin. The immunocomplexes were then made visible as described above. Both assays provide comparable results. A431 cells transfected with the GFP-tagged β2-adrenergic receptor or GFP-tagged gravin were treated with or without gravin or protein kinase C antisense oligodeoxynucleotides for 48 h. The cells were incubated with 10 μm isoproterenol for 30 min, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, and washed three times with MSM/PIPES buffer (18 mm MgSO4, 5 mm CaCl2, 40 mm KCl, 24 mm NaCl, and 5 mmPIPES, pH 6.8).

Human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells were employed, as this cell line has been widely used to study agonist-induced desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors (2.Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl.

Stimulation of A431 cells with β-adrenergic agonist resulted in desensitization of β-adrenergic receptors in response to a second stimulation (Fig.1 A). Desensitization was characterized by a reduction in the cyclic AMP response of these cells, which were challenged previously with agonist (10 μmisoproterenol) for periods up to 60 min. The β-adrenergic receptors gradually desensitized following agonist stimulation, displaying a >50% decline in their cyclic AMP response when pre-challenged with agonist for 60 min. After washout of agonist for 60 min (w60), the functional activity of the receptors recovered to nearly control levels (Fig. 1 A). In agreement with earlier observations (17.Shih M. Lin F. Scott J.D. Wang H.-y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1588-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), agonist stimulation catalyzed the increased association of the receptor with protein kinase A (∼2-fold) and protein kinase C (∼5-fold) (Fig. 1 B), as determined in immunoprecipitates using an antibody specific for the β2-adrenergic receptor combined with enzyme activity assays. The association of protein phosphatase 2B activity with the receptor displayed a transient decrease at 5 min, followed by a 2-fold increase in receptor association by 60 min after challenge with agonist (Fig. 1 C). GPLRs typically undergo sequestration following receptor activation and phosphorylation (5.von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Ghinea N. Vu Hai M.T. Groyer-Picard M.T. Houllier A. Schoevaert D. Milgrom E. J.

We tested this in binding assays using the hydrophilic, cell-impermeable β-adrenergic antagonist ligand CGP-12177. Our data show that the number of receptors accessible to the cell-impermeable β-antagonist ligand CGP-12177 decreased gradually, displaying a >30% decline within 60 min of stimulation. Because CGP-12177 is hydrophilic, it can bind to these receptors only on the cell surface. The CGP-12177 binding data demonstrate that agonist stimulation catalyzes sequestration of this prototypic GPLR. After agonist stimulation, GPLRs undergo sequestration involving the interaction of the receptor with protein kinases/phosphatases, β-arrestin, and clathrin. Complex formation of the receptor with β-arrestin, GRK2, clathrin, and gravin in A431 cells was studied by immunoprecipitation via an antibody against the β2-adrenergic receptor, followed by immunoblot analysis designed to identify target interacting proteins. The β2-adrenergic receptor is a substrate for phosphorylation by GRK2 (22.Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of the receptor catalyzed by GRK2 is important for receptor desensitization and sequestration in A431 cells (2.Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and other cells (23.Lefkowitz R.J. Pitcher J. Krueger K. Daaka Y. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Our results show that GRK2 displayed a robust, agonist-induced association with the β2-adrenergic receptor, reaching a maximal level (∼3-fold) 30 min post-stimulation (Fig.2 A), whereas its association with the receptor was nearly undetectable in unstimulated cells. After phosphorylation by protein kinases, the β2-adrenergic receptor binds to β-arrestin and undergoes clathrin-dependent endocytosis (9.Goodman O.B.J. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V.

Consistent with other observations, β-arrestin was found to be associated with β-adrenergic receptors in unstimulated cells. Agonist stimulation gradually provoked an increase in the association of β-arrestin with the receptor by 4-fold after 60 min of stimulation (Fig.2 A). In the case of clathrin, isoproterenol stimulation induced a relatively rapid increase in the level of association with the receptor (∼3-fold), although the association of clathrin with β-adrenergic receptors was not observed in the unstimulated cells. This agonist-induced complex formation of the β2-adrenergic receptor with GRK2, β-arrestin, and clathrin deduced from several immunoblot analyses is displayed as a time course (Fig. 2 B). The order of associations of target proteins with the β2-adrenergic receptor following agonist challenge is GRK2, followed by clathrin and β-arrestin, suggesting that relatively small changes in β-arrestin binding may catalyze enhanced clathrin-mediated endocytosis (9.Goodman O.B.J.

Our previous studies have shown that the scaffold protein AKAP250 (gravin) associates with the β2-adrenergic receptor in unstimulated cells (17.Shih M. Lin F. Scott J.D. Wang H.-y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1588-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To study the role of agonist stimulation in the association of gravin with the β2-adrenergic receptor, cells were stimulated with isoproterenol for periods up to 60 min. The association of gravin with the receptor was determined first by immunoprecipitation with an antibody against the β2-adrenergic receptor (or anti-gravin), followed then by immunoblot analysis of the immunoprecipitate to detect the relevant associated partner, i.e. gravin (or the β2-adrenergic receptor). Agonist stimulation increased the association of gravin with the β2-adrenergic receptor, measured using immunoprecipitation with antibodies to either partner (Fig. 3 A). The association of the receptor and AKAP250 displayed a somewhat greater signal when immunoprecipitation was carried out with an antibody against gravin, followed by immunoblotting with antibodies to detect β2-adrenergic receptors. Following challenge of the cells with agonist for 60 min, receptor-gravin association increased ∼"
https://openalex.org/W2017073399,"Abstract Overexpression and activation of HER-2/neu, a proto-oncogene, play a pivotal role in cancer formation. Strong expression of HER-2/neu in cancers has been associated with poor prognosis. Reduced expression of p27Kip1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, correlates with poor clinical outcome in many types of carcinomas. Because many cancers with the overexpression of HER-2/neuoverlap with those affected by reduced p27 expression, we studied the link between HER-2/neu oncogenic signals and p27 regulation. We found that down-regulation of p27 correlates with HER-2/neu overexpression. To address the molecular mechanism of this inverse correlation, we found that reduction of p27 is caused by enhanced ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and the HER-2/Grb2/MAPK pathway is involved in the decrease of p27 stability. Also, HER-2/neu activity causes mislocation of p27 andJun activation domain-binding protein 1 (JAB1), an exporter of p27, into the cytoplasm, thereby facilitating p27 degradation. These results reveal that HER-2/neu signals reduce p27 stability and thus present potential points for therapeutic intervention in HER-2/neu-associated cancers."

In transfected cells SR-BI recognizes HDL, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and modified LDL, protein-free lipid vesicles containing anionic phospholipids, and recombinant lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, apoA-II, apoE, or apoCIII. The molecular basis for the recognition of such diverse ligands by SR-BI is unknown. We have used direct binding analysis and chemical cross-linking to examine the interaction of murine (m) SR-BI with apoA-I, the major protein of HDL. The results show that apoA-I in apoA-I/palmitoyl-oleoylphosphatidylcholine discs, HDL3, or in a lipid-free state binds to mSR-BI with high affinity (K d ≅ 5–8 μg/ml). ApoA-I in each of these forms was efficiently cross-linked to cell surface mSR-BI, indicating that direct protein-protein contacts are the predominant feature that drives the interaction between HDL and mSR-BI. When complexed with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, the N-terminal and C-terminal CNBr fragments of apoA-I each bound to SR-BI in a saturable, high affinity manner, and each cross-linked efficiently to mSR-BI. Thus, mSR-BI recognizes multiple sites in apoA-I. A model class A amphipathic α-helix, 37pA, also showed high affinity binding and cross-linking to mSR-BI. These studies identify the amphipathic α-helix as a recognition motif for SR-BI and lead to the hypothesis that mSR-BI interacts with HDL via the amphipathic α-helical repeat units of apoA-I. This hypothesis explains the interaction of SR-BI with a wide variety of apolipoproteins via a specific secondary structure, the class A amphipathic α-helix, that is a common structural motif in the apolipoproteins of HDL, as well as LDL.

In rodents, the HDL-CE selective uptake pathway plays a major role in plasma cholesterol metabolism by delivering HDL-CE to the liver in the final steps of reverse cholesterol transport (2.Goldberg D.I.

Despite extensive studies of this widespread process, little is known about the biochemical mechanism by which CE molecules are transferred from the HDL particle to the cell. Recent studies identified a cell surface receptor, scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), that binds HDL particles and facilitates the selective uptake of HDL-CE in transfected cells (11.Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). Murine (m) and rat SR-BI are strongly expressed in those tissues that exhibit the selective uptake pathway in vivo, namely the liver, adrenal gland, ovary, and testis (11.Acton S. Rigotti A.

Res. 1998; 39: 1616-1628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunolocalization at the electron microscopic level in rat ovarian luteal and testicular Leydig cells show that SR-BI is present on microvillar membrane domains that form channels in which HDL particles are sequestered (16.Reaven E.

These microvillar channels are believed to be the site at which the selective uptake of HDL-CE occurs (19.Reaven E. Spicher M. Azhar S. J. Lipid. Res. 1989; 30: 1551-1560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data provide strong circumstantial evidence that SR-BI is the cell surface receptor responsible for HDL-CE selective uptake. Direct evidence for SR-BI function is provided by studies in which antibody to the extracellular domain of mSR-BI blocked HDL-CE selective uptake and the delivery of HDL cholesterol to the steroidogenic pathway in cultured murine adrenocortical and ovarian cells (20.Temel R.E.

In addition, inactivation of the SR-BI gene in mice increased plasma HDL cholesterol levels and reduced neutral lipid stores in the adrenal glands (22.Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Similarly, mice carrying an induced SR-BI mutation that reduced hepatic SR-BI expression levels by 50% showed a similar reduction in hepatic HDL-CE selective uptake (23.Varban M.L. Rinninger F. Wang N. Fairchild-Huntress V. Dunmore J.H. Fang Q. Gosselin M.L. Dixon K.L. Deeds J.D. Acton S.L. Tall A.R. Huszar D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4619-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations indicate that SR-BI plays a key role in mediating HDL-CE selective uptake in the liver and in steroidogenic cells. The molecular basis for the recognition of HDL particles by SR-BI is unknown. In transfected cells mSR-BI binds HDL (11.Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar), LDL and modified LDL (24.Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and protein-free lipid vesicles containing anionic phospholipids (25.Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). In earlier studies with the murine Y1-BS1 adrenocortical cell line, it was shown that recombinant HDL particles containing apoA-I, apoC proteins, or apoE were all active in HDL-CE selective uptake (26.Pittman R.C. Glass C.K. Atkinson D. Small D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2435-2442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, recombinant bilayer phospholipid discs containing apoA-I, apoA-II, or apoCIII were shown to bind to Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing transfected mSR-BI (27.Xu S. Laccotripe M. Huang X. Rigotti A. Zannis V.I. Krieger M. J. Lipid. Res. 1997; 38: 1289-1298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results do not provide a clear picture of the HDL-SR-BI interaction and are compatible with models in which HDL recognition by SR-BI is due to interaction with HDL lipids, or with common motifs shared among HDL (and LDL) apolipoproteins, or to a combination of such interactions. In the present study we have explored this issue by using chemical cross-linking to study the interaction between mSR-BI and apoA-I as it occurs in recombinant phospholipid discs, in spherical HDL3particles, and in lipid-free apoA-I. The results show that each of these species binds and cross-links efficiently to mSR-BI. The N- and C-terminal cyanogen bromide fragments of apoA-I each bind with high affinity and cross-link to SR-BI, indicating that apoA-I:SR-BI interaction is not due to a unique binding site in apoA-I. In addition, a model class A amphiphathic helix binds and cross-links to mSR-BI. These results indicate that mSR-BI makes direct protein-protein contacts with apoA-I and point to the amphipathic helix as the primary recognition motif for the HDL-mSR-BI interaction. Human serum was obtained from healthy, normolipemic volunteers, and HDL3 (1.125<ρ<1.21 g/ml) was isolated from serum by sequential centrifugation (28.Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin.

CNBr digestion of apoA-I produces four fragments with molecular weights of 9880 (N-terminal), 3190, 4250, and 10,700 (C-terminal). In brief, apoA-I (30 mg) was digested with 3 ml of (300 mg/ml) CNBr in 70% trifluoroacetic acid for 24 h at room temperature in the dark. The reaction mixture was diluted with water, lyophylized, and the residue subjected to reversed-phase HPLC (Vydac, 22 mm (inner diameter) × 25 cm, 10-μm resin) using acetonitrile, water, and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as solvent with a gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile for 90 min at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Fractions at retention times 55.3 min (fragment 1), 57 min (fragment 2), 62 min (fragment 3), 65 min (fragment 4), and 68 min (fragment 5) were subjected to analytical HPLC and mass spectral analysis using a PE-Sciox APT-III triple-quadrupole ion spray mass spectrometer (at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Mass Spectroscopy Core Facility analysis core facility). Fragments 1, 2, and 3 had respective masses of 3190, 4250, and 7427, corresponding, respectively, to the two middle CNBr fragments and the middle fragments covalently bound. Fragments 4 and 5 corresponded to the N-terminal and C-terminal fragments, with masses of 9880 and 10,700, respectively. The analytical HPLC profiles of these fragments correlated well with the published fragmentation pattern (31.Morrison J.R. Fidge N.H. Grego B. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 186: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). N-terminal and C-terminal fragments were dialyzed extensively in 0.1 m guanidine HCl. DMPC·CNBr fragment complexes were made at a DMPC:protein ratio of 2:1 (w/w). In most cases 4 mg of DMPC dissolved in CHCl3 was dried onto a borosilicate tube and subsequently vacuum-dried for 30 min. It was then suspended in 150 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, by vortexing. After equilibrating the DMPC multilamellar vesicles at 24 °C, 2 mg of the peptide, also equilibrated at 24 °C, was added to the DMPC preparation, and incubated for 30 min at 24 °C. A subsequent water bath sonication of 10 min followed this incubation. The complexes were then dialyzed extensively against 150 mmNaCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Formation of complexes was assessed by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and negative stain electron microscopy. Discoidal complexes containing DMPC and the model class A amphipathic helix, 37pA (32.Anantharamaiah G.M. Jones J.L. Brouillette C.G. Schmidt C.F. Chung B.H. Hughes T.A. Bhown A.S. Segrest J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10248-10255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared by incubation of the peptide with DMPC multilamellar vesicles at the transition temperature as described (33.Lund-Katz S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Segrest J.P. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12217-12223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide (0.5 mg) was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3, 0.01% NaN3 overnight at 4 °C followed by bath sonication for 3 h. DMPC (20 mg) was dissolved in CHCl3/methanol (2/1), dried to a film on glass tube, and held under vacuum overnight. The DMPC was then suspended in 2 ml of the above saline solution by vortexing, bath sonicated for 30 min, and equilibrated at 24 °C. DMPC (1.25 mg) was added to the 37pA peptide also equilibrated at 24 °C, and incubated for 48 h at 24 °C to allow formation of the discoidal complexes. Proteins and peptides were labeled using the iodine monochloride method as described (34.Goldstein J. Basu S.K. Brown M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar) using a ratio of 1 mCi of carrier-free Na125I/3 mg of protein. The mixture was then passed through a 10-ml Sephadex G-25 column (Pharmacia PD-10) equilibrated with 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and fractions were sampled for γ counting. Pooled fractions were extensively dialyzed against 0.15m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and samples were assayed for protein and radioactivity to determine specific activities. Specific activities (cpm/ng) for the various samples were approximately: apoA-I·POPC discs, 660–730; lipid-free apoA-I, 530–880; HDL3, 450–800; N-terminal apoA-I fragment, 900–1000; C-terminal apoA-I fragment, 420–460; 37pA, 670–1000. COS-7 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics in T-75 flasks and were subcultured once a week using a 1:20 split ratio. Cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector for mSR-BI (35.Connelly M.A. Klein S.M. Azhar S. Abumrad N.A. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 41-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) or with vector alone. Cells (1.5 × 106) were seeded in 100-mm plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator. A mixture of 10 μg of the desired plasmid, diluted in serum-free DMEM, and 30 μl of Fugene-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) prepared in a sterile polystyrene tube (Falcon 2058) was added dropwise to the plated cells. After incubation (18–24 h, 37 °C), transfected cells were trypsinized, pooled, suspended in growth medium, and replated in multi-well plates as needed for experiments. Experiments were carried out 24 h after replating. Except as noted in figure legends, the following protocol was used for cross-linking. mSR-BI- or vector-transfected COS-7 cells in six-well plates were placed on ice and washed three times with 3 ml of MEM/HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% BSA. Ligand was added in 1 ml of MEM, 1% BSA, and the cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Cells were cooled on ice, washed two times with 2 ml of MEM/HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% BSA, and three times with 3 ml of PBS. Cross-linker was dissolved immediately before use at 10 mg/ml in dimethyl sulfoxide, diluted to 2.5 × 10-4m with PBS, and 1 ml was added per well. Cells were incubated for 45 min at room temperature after which cells were cooled on ice, and the incubation medium was removed. Cells were lysed in 400 μl of 0.02 msodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.2 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm glycine, and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 ×g at 4 °C. An aliquot of the supernatant was removed for γ counting, and the remainder was used for immunoprecipitation or frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C for later analysis. Antiserum (7.5 μl) raised against the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of mSR-BI (17.Azhar S. Nomoto A. Leers-Sucheta S. Reaven E. J. Lipid. Res. 1998; 39: 1616-1628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or control antiserum and lysis buffer to bring the volume to 150 μl were added to cell supernatant (100–150 μl). To this was added 150 μl of 2× immunoprecipitation buffer (200 mm NaCl, 100 mmLiCl, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, containing protease inhibitors as noted above). The sample was incubated at 4 °C for 3–18 h, after which protein A-agarose was added, and the incubation was continued for 1 h. The tube was rotated during the final hour to keep the protein A beads in suspension. The tube was centrifuged for 2 min at 10,000 ×g, and a measured aliquot of the supernatant was removed for γ counting. The pellet was washed twice with 1 ml of 1× immunoprecipitation buffer, and the beads were transferred to a tube for γ counting. In some experiments, the beads were eluted with 150 μl of 60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 6% glycerol, 2.4% SDS by boiling for 5 min. After centrifugation, a measured aliquot was removed for γ counting and another for analysis by non-reducing 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with the buffer system of Laemmli (36.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using Kaleidoscope (Bio-Rad) prestained molecular weight standards. Gels were dried, and radioactivity was imaged with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Transfected cells, plated in 12-well plates, were placed on ice and washed two times with 1 ml of MEM/HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% BSA. Ligand in 0.25 ml of chilled MEM/HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% BSA was incubated with the cells for 2 h at 4 °C. An aliquot of medium was removed, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min to pellet cell debris, and subjected to γ counting to determine the free ligand concentration. Cells were washed three times with 2 ml of MEM/HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% BSA and three times with 2 ml of PBS. Cells were solubilized in 1 ml of 0.1 n NaOH, and samples were removed for γ counting and for protein determination (37.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, washed cells were solubilized in 0.5 ml of 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in PBS, and transferred to a tube for γ counting and protein measurement. SR-BI-specific binding of apoA-I was determined by subtracting values from vector-transfected cells from the SR-BI-expressing cells to generate an SR-BI-vector curve. Binding parameters for B max and K dwere obtained by nonlinear regression (GraphPad Prism) using a one- or two-site binding isotherm as indicated (20.Temel R.E. Trigatti B. DeMattos R.B. Azhar S.

In order to examine the interaction between apoA-I·POPC discoidal complexes and mSR-BI, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with vector alone or with an mSR-BI expression vector. Fig.1 shows that mSR-BI-expressing cells bound apoA-I·POPC complexes with a concentration dependence indicative of both high and low affinity components, whereas vector-transfected cells showed only a low affinity binding component. Resolution of the mSR-BI binding isotherm by nonlinear regression analysis showed a saturable high affinity component with an apparentK d = 6 μg/ml (apoA-I protein), a value similar to that reported for the binding of HDL3 to mSR-BI on Y1-BS1 adrenocortical cells (20.Temel R.E.

Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 41-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the slope of the low affinity component for the mSR-BI-expressing cells (1.18 ± 0.14 ng bound/mg of cell protein per μg/ml apoA-I) at high ligand concentrations (50–200 μg/ml) was much greater than the slope of the low affinity component in vector-transfected cells (0.23 ± 0.07 ng bound/mg of cell protein per μg/ml apoA-I). This result suggests that the low affinity binding component seen at high ligand concentrations (>100 μg/ml) in the mSR-BI-expressing cells is due to mSR-BI expression and is different from the low affinity binding seen with the vector-expressing cells. The basis for this low affinity binding component is unknown but might reflect SR-BI-dependent changes in plasma membrane lipid domains (39.de la Llera-Moya M. Rothblat G.H.

To test for direct interactions between mSR-BI and apoA-I, mSR-BI-expressing or vector-transfected cells were incubated with125I-apoA-I·POPC discs for 90 min at 37 °C, washed to remove unbound ligand, and subsequently treated with one of two homobifunctional N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, both of which have a 12-Å spacer arm. DSP or Lomant's reagent (41.Lomant A.J. Fairbanks G. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) is very lipid-soluble, whereas DTSSP is its water-soluble analog. To test for cross-linking between apoA-I and mSR-BI, cell extract was immunoprecipitated with antibody raised against the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of mSR-BI, and the immunoprecipitate was assayed for the presence of 125I-apoA-I. The data in TableI (part A) show results from a typical experiment. The columns labeled “cpm/well” show the125I-apoA-I remaining on the cells after incubation with apoA-I·POPC discs, washing, and reaction with or without a cross-linker. As expected from the previous binding analysis (Fig. 1), mSR-BI-expressing cells bound 10–20-fold more apoA-I as compared with vector-expressing cells. When cell extracts from mSR-BI-expressing cells that had not been treated with cross-linker were immunoprecipitated with either anti-mSR-BI or control antibody, little or no 125I-apoA-I was recovered in the pellet. In contrast, when mSR-BI-expressing cells were treated with either DSP or DTSSP,125I-apoA-I was recovered in the immunoprecipitate with anti-mSR-BI but not with control antibody. The percentage of the bound125I-apoA-I recovered in the immunoprecipitate (Table I, part A, column designated “Percentage cross-linked”) was 27% for DTSSP and 37% for DSP, indicating that cross-linking of bound apoA-I to mSR-BI is quite efficient. The specificity of the cross-linking reaction for monitoring apoA-I-mSR-BI interaction is evident from the result that recovery of 125I-apoA-I in the immunoprecipitate required both reaction with cross-linker and antibody to mSR-BI.Table ICross-linking of apoA-I to mSR-BICross-linkercpm/wellcpm immunoprecipitatedPercentage cross-linkedvectormSR-BIanti-mSR-BIcontrol antibodyA.

These EBP50 binding interactions have been implicated in sequestering interactive sets of proteins into common microdomains, regulating the activity of interacting proteins, and modulating membrane protein trafficking. With only two PDZ domains, it is unclear how EBP50 forms multiprotein complexes. Other PDZ proteins increase their breadth and diversity of protein interactions through oligomerization. Hypothesizing that EBP50 self-associates to amplify its functional capacity, far-Western blotting of cholangiocyte epithelial cell proteins with EBP50 fusion protein revealed that EBP50 binds to a 50-kDa protein. Far-Western blotting of EBP50 isolated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis or immunoprecipitation demonstrates that the 50-kDa binding partner is itself EBP50. Further, co-transfection/co-precipitation studies show the self-association can occur in an intracellular environment. In vitro analysis of the EBP50-EBP50 binding interaction indicates it is both saturable and of relatively high affinity. Analysis of truncated EBP50 proteins indicates EBP50 self-association is mediated through its PDZ domains. The ability to self-associate provides a mechanism for EBP50 to expand its capacity to form multiprotein complexes and regulate membrane transport events.

The 80–90-amino acid PDZ domains are most noted for their capacity to bind the COOH-tail of specific integral membrane proteins (1Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 275: 73-77Google Scholar). Through a distinct interface, some PDZ domains also have the capacity to participate in separate PDZ-PDZ interactions. Interestingly, these properties allow a single PDZ domain to bind concurrently with both the COOH-tail of an integral membrane protein and another protein through a PDZ-PDZ interaction (2Xu X-Z.S. Choudhury A. Li X. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). PDZ proteins amplify their capacity and diversity of protein-protein interactions through co-expression of additional protein binding motifs (e.g. SH2 domains, SH3 domains, ankyrin repeats, ERM1 binding domains), expression of multiple PDZ domains within the same PDZ protein, and oligomerization with other PDZ proteins (2Xu X-Z.S.

ERM-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50; also known as NHE regulatory factor) is a PDZ domain protein found in several epithelial cell types. EBP50 has been shown to bind a growing number of integral membrane proteins including cAMP-regulated Na+/H+exchanger 3 (NHE3), β2-adrenergic receptor, G protein-coupled receptor kinase-6A (GRK6A), Yes-associated protein 65 (YAP65), and the cAMP-dependent cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl− channel (cftr) (8Weinman E.J.

Theoretically, EBP50 oligomerization could amplify the capacity of the existing PDZ domains to sequester interactive proteins within membrane microdomains. The present study demonstrates the capacity of EBP50, both in vivo and in vitro, to self-associate with high affinity through PDZ-PDZ interactions. GST-EBP50 fusion proteins were created by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the full-length or segmented rat EBP50 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AF154336), ligation into PGEX-2T or PGEX-4T-3 vectors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and transformation into Escherichia coli strain DH5α.

HA- and FLAG-tagged full-length EBP50 was generated similarly in pCGN-2 (David Gordon, University of Colorado Health Science Center) and p3XFLAG-CMV-7 (Sigma) vectors, respectively. These primer sets include (a) ggtaagcttagatgagcgcggacgcagcg/ggtggatcctgctcagaggttgctgaagag (HA-EBP50) and (b) ggtaagcttaagatgagcgcggacgcagcg/ggtggatcctgctcagaggttgctgaagag (FLAG-EBP50). Transformed colonies were selected by ampicillin resistance (100 μg/ml ampicillin), and protein expression was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mmfor 3 h). GST fusion proteins were enriched from the bacteria by diluting cultures 1:40 in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin, 1% Nonidet P-40), sonicating, incubating (2 mm ATP, 10 mm MgSO4, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 min, 37 °C), clarifying by centrifugation (14,000 × g; 10 min), and incubating the lysate with glutathione-Sepharose beads. In some cases, GST-EBP50 was subsequently eluted from the beads with glutathione elution buffer (10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 min, 4 °C). In other experiments, EBP50 was cleaved from GST with 12.5 units of thrombin for 1 h at 22 °C. EBP50 itself does not contain thrombin-sensitive sites. Thrombin was then inactivated by the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μm leupeptin. In initial studies, 40 μg of total protein from normal rat cholangiocytes was solubilized in 5× PAGE buffer (5% SDS, 25% sucrose, 50 mm Tris, 5 mmEDTA, pH 8.0), electrophoresed on a 3.5–17.5% SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Subsequent overlay studies blotted 10 μg of recombinant EBP50 proteins. Immobilized proteins were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in blot buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100) at 4 °C overnight. Unless otherwise stated, the immobilized proteins were then incubated in blot buffer with 500 nm recombinant EBP50 protein and protease inhibitors for 2 h at room temperature. In some experiments, EBP50 was biotinylated (0.5 mg/ml N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (Pierce), 45 min, 4 °C) prior to overlaying the blots. EBP50 protein was detected by Western blotting with HRP-tagged secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Biotinylated EBP50 was detected with HRP-tabbed neutravidin and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). NRC cells were solubilized in half-strength 5× PAGE buffer as above without reducing agent and diluted 1:1 with overlay buffer (650 mg/ml urea, 50 μl/ml pI 5–7 ampholyte (Bio-Rad), 50 μl/ml pI 6–8 ampholyte (Bio-Rad). This solution was loaded on top of a 14 × 0.15-cm tube gel (4% polyacrylamide, 9 m urea, 3% (v/v) pI 5–7 ampholyte, 3% (v/v) pI 6–8 ampholyte). Isoelectric focusing occurred under 600 V for 13 h and 900 V for 4 h. The proteins in the tube gels were further solubilized and reduced by incubation in equilibration buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, 11% sucrose, 3% SDS, 10 mmdithiothreitol, pH 6.8) for 10 min. The tube gels were run in the second dimension on either a 4–14% gradient gel or 10% Tris-glycine separating gel. Paired blots were used for Western and far-Western blotting for EBP50 localization and binding interaction, respectively. Following Western and far-Western blotting, the membranes were washed in dH2O and developed for total protein using colloidal gold (Bio-Rad). For clarity of presentation, the complexity of neighboring proteins was reduced by using 0.5% Triton X-100 insoluble proteins from NRC monolayers for the two-dimensional gel overlay experiments in Fig. 3. EBP50 antibody was incubated with Protein A/G beads (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature and then covalently cross-linked with 1 mmdithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) for 1 h at room temperature. Cross-linking was stopped, and unbound antibody was removed by washing and dilute storage in 1 m glycine buffer (pH 7.5). Prior to immunoprecipitation, NRC cells were solubilized in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate; protease mixture, pH 7.4), and the pellet was isolated, solubilized in RIPA buffer plus 1% SDS, diluted to 0.1% SDS with RIPA buffer, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 2 min. The resultant supernatant was precleared with washed Protein A/G beads (2 h at room temperature) and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with EBP50 antibody-linked Protein A/G beads (2 h at room temperature). The beads were then washed three times in RIPA buffer with 0.1% SDS, and the bound protein was eluted with 5× PAGE buffer and centrifuged. The pre-clear beads were treated identically and served as a precipitation control. HEK-293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Full-length EBP50 was inserted into HA (pCGN-2; David Gordon, University of Colorado Health Science Center) and FLAG (p3XFLAG-CMV-7; Sigma) vectors, verified in-frame by sequencing, and independently transfected into HEK-293 cells to verify the synthesis of the tagged EBP50. To assess FLAG-EBP50 co-precipitation with immunoprecipitated HA-EBP50, four concurrent co-transfections were performed. HEK-293 cells (100-mm dishes, ∼80% confluence) were transfected with 2–4 μg of 1) HA vector and FLAG vector cDNA, 2) HA vector and FLAG-EBP50 cDNA, 3) HA-EBP50 and FLAG vector cDNA, or 4) HA-EBP50 and FLAG-EBP50 cDNA (Effectene transfection reagent kit according to the manufacturer's instructions; Qiagen, Inc.). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer and then scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and phosphatase inhibitors (5 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm sodium vanadate)). The lysate was rocked for 30 min at 4 °C, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g, 30 min at 4 °C. The lysate (400 μl) was immunoprecipitated with 100 μl of anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at 4 °C, the matrix was washed four times with 1 ml of cold lysis buffer, and the bound proteins eluted with 5× PAGE buffer (200 μl, 95 °C, 5 min). Proteins were separated on a 3.5–17.5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred on nitrocellulose membrane. Self-association of EBP50 was revealed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). The binding characteristics of EBP50 self-association were performed in a similar fashion. Following the transfer of paired sets of EBP50 (10 μg) or albumin (10 μg; negative control), the blots were incubated in blot buffer containing 0–10 μm biotinylated EBP50. Following paired colorimetric development of all blots using Opti-CN, the relative levels of bound EBP50 were quantified by densitometry (IP Laboratory, National Institutes of Health). Thrombin-liberated recombinant EBP50 (0.1 mg·ml−1) was brought to room temperature, incubated for 1 h, and divided into two aliquots. The first aliquot was cross-linked in 3.3 mmbis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature; the second aliquot received an equivalent volume of phosphate-buffered saline. These two solutions received 0.1 volume of 10% SDS, 50% sucrose and were assayed for EBP50 cross-linking by Western blotting. To determine the domain responsible for EBP50 self-association, domain-specific EBP50 fusion proteins were generated, biotinylated, cleaved from the immobile phase with thrombin, and overlaid onto blotted full-length EBP50. These recombinant EBP50 domains included the PDZ1,2 domain (amino acids 1–260), the post-PDZ domain COOH segment (amino acids 228–356), and COOH-tail (amino acids 1–348). Next, domain-specific EBP50 proteins (COOH-tail, PDZ1,2, post-PDZ COOH segment) were blotted and overlaid with biotinylated forms of the same domain-specific form of EBP50. Subsequently, the PDZ1domain (amino acids 1–133) and PDZ2 domain (amino acids 133–260) were generated, biotinylated, and overlaid onto wild-type, PDZ1,2, PDZ1, and PDZ2 domains of EBP50. GST-EBP50 fusion proteins were generated for use in far-Western detection of binding partners (Fig. 1 A). Following isolation of GST proteins, total protein staining (left panel) detected no protein from control bacteria (lane 1), a single protein consistent with 26-kDa GST protein (lane 2), and two prominent proteins of ∼80 kDa consistent with GST-EBP50 (lane 3). Western blotting with anti-GST antibody (middle panel) confirmed the single protein inlane 2, and the doublet in lane 3 contained GST protein. Western blotting with anti-EBP50 antibody (right panel) confirmed that the protein doublet in lane 3contained EBP50. The lower band of the doublet is a likely partial proteolytic product of the intact protein. Thrombin treatment of the intact GST-EBP50 resulted in site-specific cleavage (Fig. 1 B). Total protein staining (left panel) showed that thrombin treatment cleaved the parent protein (lane 1) and liberated a 50-kDa protein (lane 2). GST was not eluted from the immobile phase following thrombin digestion and would not be predicted to be present in lane 2. Western blotting with EBP50 antibody (right panel) confirmed that the thrombin-liberated protein was indeed EBP50. Similar approaches were utilized to generate truncated forms of EBP50 (see below). Thrombin-cleaved recombinant EBP50 was used in two different far-Western blotting protocols to demonstrate EBP50 is capable of binding an endogenous 50-kDa protein from NRC cells. First, Western-blotted proteins from NRC cells, which express endogenous EBP50, were overlaid with recombinant EBP50. Paired blots without overlaid recombinant protein served as the control. Immunodetection of EBP50, which detects both endogenous and recombinant EBP50, was then performed (Fig. 2; A-1 andA-2). In all paired samples tested (n = 5), the 50-kDa band on the blot that was overlaid with recombinant EBP50 (A-1) was more intense than the 50-kDa band that was not overlaid with recombinant EBP50 (A-2). This increased EBP50 signal intensity in the overlaid sample suggests that EBP50 binds either to itself or another protein of similar mass. To specifically detect only the overlaid EBP50, recombinant EBP50 was biotinylated before being overlaid onto the blotted NRC proteins and detected with horseradish peroxidase-labeled neutravidin. The overlaid biotinylated EBP50 again detected a protein at 50 kDa. Its relative intensity is lower when compared with other EBP50-bound proteins (Fig.2; B-1). This lower relative intensity would be predicted because endogenous EBP50 is not detected by this assay. Paired blots of NRC proteins that were not overlaid with biotinylated EBP50 (negative control; B-2) showed no signal when detected with neutravidin-HRP. These two observations indicate that recombinant EBP50 specifically interacts with either native EBP50 or a protein(s) that co-migrates at 50 kDa. To directly determine if the endogenous 50-kDa binding partner is indeed EBP50, three distinct approaches were employed. First, in a similar overlay approach, paired NRC protein samples (Triton-insoluble fraction) were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. The first two-dimensional blot was developed by standard Western blotting to identify the migration pattern of EBP50. EBP50 (Fig.3 A, panel 1,arrow) was detected in a region consistent with its demonstrated migration at 50 kDa and predicted pI value of 6.2. Protein staining with colloidal gold shows the relative position of EBP50 to neighboring proteins (panel 2). In the paired blot, these proteins were used to confirm the location of EBP50 (panel 4). When paired blots were overlaid with biotinylated recombinant EBP50, there was specific binding between recombinant EBP50 and endogenous EBP50 (arrow; panel 3). These observations were mirrored in overlays of immunoprecipitated EBP50 (Fig. 3 B). Western blotting (left panel) shows that EBP50 was specifically immunoprecipitated from NRC cell lysates. In contrast to either precipitates obtained in the absence of EBP50 antibody or albumin controls, paired blots show that biotinylated EBP50 readily binds to immunoprecipitated EBP50 protein, again consistent with EBP50 self-association. To determine if the observed in vitro EBP50-EBP50 binding interaction can occur in an intracellular environment, a co-transfection/co-precipitation approach was employed (Fig.3 C). HA- and FLAG-tagged EBP50 were co-transfected into HEK-296 cells, and the co-precipitation of FLAG-EBP50 with immunoprecipitated HA-EBP50 was assayed. In contrast to cells co-transfected/co-precipitated with FLAG-EBP50 and HA-vector only, cells co-transfected with FLAG-EBP50 and HA-EBP50 showed FLAG-EBP50 present in the washed HA-immunoprecipitate fraction (Fig.3 C). Other control co-transfections/co-precipitations (FLAG-vector only/HA-vector only; FLAG-vector only/HA-EBP50) were also negative. Using isolated recombinant EBP50 protein, the binding characteristics of the EBP50-EBP50 interaction were evaluated. First, EBP50 self-association was confirmed by binding of biotinylated recombinant EBP50 to immobilized GST-EBP50 (Fig.4 A). Albumin and GST-only served as negative controls. Coomassie Blue staining of albumin, GST-only, and GST-EBP50 in paired gels demonstrate that equivalent amounts of protein were added (left panel). Biotinylated EBP50, after being overlaid on a paired blot, bound only to the GST-EBP50 protein (right panel). Using albumin as a negative control, the EBP50-EBP50 interaction was evaluated further by overlaying immobilized EBP50 with varying concentrations of biotinylated EBP50 (Fig. 4 B). Quantitation of the resultant binding showed that the EBP50-EBP50 interaction was both saturable and of relatively high affinity. EBP50 self-association could generate simple dimerization or lead to the formation of more complex oligomers. To determine if oligomerization can occur, recombinant EBP50 was incubated in suspension, covalently cross-linked, and assayed for the presence of multimers by Western blotting (Fig. 5). Whereas denatured EBP50 in non-cross-linked samples ran almost exclusively at 50 kDa, a significant fraction of EBP50 in paired cross-linked samples appeared at higher molecular masses. The apparent mass of these proteins (∼100 kDa and ∼150 kDa) is consistent with oligomer formation. Although the predominant oligomer was the dimer, a trimer was also readily observed, and a tetramer was seen at longer exposures (data not shown). To evaluate which regions of EBP50 participate in the self-association interaction, specific domains of EBP50 were synthesized (Fig.6), biotinylated, and overlaid onto immobilized full-length EBP50 (Fig.7 A). These EBP50 domains include 1) full-length EBP50, 2) COOH-tailless EBP50, 3) PDZ1,2 domains, 4) post-PDZ1,2 COOH segment, 5) PDZ1 domain, and 6) PDZ2 domain. The COOH-tailless EBP50 proteins bound with an avidity that was indistinguishable from the full-length EBP50 protein. This observation was reiterated by comparing the self-association of COOH-tailless to immobilized COOH-tailless and full-length EBP50 (Fig. 7 B). Again, the degree of association was not notably different between the two groups, indicating that the COOH-tail was not involved in EBP50 self-association.Figure 7PDZ domains show specific binding of EBP50. A, compared with full-length EBP50, removal of the COOH-tail had no significant effect on binding and the COOH segment only showed greatly diminished binding. The PDZ1,2 domain protein, however, showed a heightened avidity for binding EBP50.B, binding of COOH-tailless EBP50 with COOH-tailless EBP50 is not substantially different from the binding of full-length EBP50. Using full-length EBP50 as a control, overlaid PDZ1,2readily bound immobilized PDZ1,2 domain, demonstrating the capacity for the PDZ domains to dictate the self-association interaction. Each binding study was repeated three to four times with separate preparations. C, interestingly, both of the individual PDZ domains (PDZ1 and PDZ2) alone were capable of binding EBP50. When the specific interactions of the two PDZ domains were assessed, both homodimerization and heterodimerization of the individual domains were observed but homodimer formation was consistently greater than heterodimer formation (i.e.PDZ1:PDZ1 > PDZ1:PDZ2; PDZ2:PDZ2 > PDZ2:PDZ1). Alb, albumin; w.t., wild typeView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The COOH segment EBP50 protein showed little or no detectable binding (Fig. 7 A). This indicates the post-PDZ COOH segment is not capable itself of binding EBP50. Likewise, no detectable binding was observed when the COOH segment was overlaid onto itself (data not shown). In contrast, the PDZ1,2 domain showed a greater degree of binding to EBP50 than the full-length EBP50 (Fig.7 A). This occurred consistently across three separate preparations of recombinant EBP50 proteins. The avid binding indicates that the PDZ1,2 domain is involved in the EBP50-EBP50 self-association reaction. To verify that the PDZ1,2 domain binding interaction occurred with the PDZ1,2 domain of the immobilized EBP50, the binding of biotinylated PDZ1,2 to blotted PDZ1,2 was examined (Fig. 7 B). PDZ1,2 showed avid binding to PDZ1,2, demonstrating that the EBP50-EBP50 binding interactions occurred through a PDZ1,2 domain. Finally, to determine if one or both of the two PDZ domains of EBP50 are involved in the self-association reaction, the binding of biotinylated PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains to immobilized full-length EBP50 as well as the individual PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains was assessed (Fig.7 C). Interestingly, both PDZ1 and PDZ2 bound EBP50. When the specific PDZ domain interactions were evaluated, both PDZ1 and PDZ2 could bind to either PDZ domain. Their apparent interactions, however, were not equivalent. For both PDZ domains, the homologous binding interactions predominated such that PDZ1 binding was greater with PDZ1 than with PDZ2 and PDZ2binding was greater with PDZ2 than with PDZ1. EBP50 contains two PDZ domains followed by an ERM protein binding domain. Further, sequence analysis of the carboxyl terminus (FSNL) suggests that the COOH-tail of EBP50 itself could be bound by a PDZ protein and provides a potential mechanism for EBP50 self-association. If EBP50 self-associated by binding the tail of another EBP50 protein the resultant complex would be a head-to-tail configuration more likely to extend rather than cluster EBP50 and its associated proteins. This possibility was largely ruled out by removing the terminal eight amino acids from the carboxyl tail and assaying its ability to bind EBP50. No difference was observed in the abundance of protein binding in this assay (Fig. 7 A). Further, because the tailless EBP50 could bind the tail of the immobilized full-length EBP50, the binding interaction between tailless EBP50 to immobilized tailless EBP50 was also analyzed. It also failed to show any difference in either its apparent affinity or binding capacity (Fig. 7 B). Consequently, the EBP50-EBP50 interaction is unlikely to occur in a head-to-tail fashion. PSD95, one of the originally described PDZ proteins, oligomerizes through a non-PDZ segment of its protein (4Hsueh Y-P. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The post-PDZ1,2 COOH segment has not been fully characterized but, as a minimum, has the capacity to bind members of the ezrin-radixin-moesin family (7Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Given its known protein binding capacity, its potential involvement in EBP50 self-association was examined. Run in parallel with full-length EBP50, no oligomerization of EBP50-COOH segment was observed (Fig. 7 A). Taken together, these findings indicate that the COOH segment is unlikely to account for the EBP50-EBP50 binding. The capacity of proteins to oligomerize through PDZ-PDZ interactions is demonstrated by the association of nNOS with syntrophin and PSD95 and the dimerization of InaD (2Xu X-Z.S. Choudhury A. Li X. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 5Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). To determine if EBP50 self-association occurs through its PDZ domains, the binding of the PDZ1,2construct to immobilized EBP50 was compared with that of wild type EBP50. In three separate preparations, there was greater binding of PDZ1,2 than full-length EBP50 (Fig. 7). This strongly supports the hypothesis that EBP50 self-association occurs through PDZ-PDZ interactions and suggests that the COOH segment could modify the binding characteristics. Unlike the dimerization of InaD, which occurs between two distinct PDZ domains within InaD, the most prominent PDZ:PDZ domain interactions of EBP50 occurred between homologous PDZ domains (i.e. PDZ1 to PDZ1 and PDZ2 to PDZ2; Fig. 7 C). Thus, EBP50 self-association is apparently mediated through a novel interaction involving homologous PDZ domains. The functional significance of EBP50 self-association remains speculative at this point. In other systems, PDZ domain-dependent protein-protein interactions have been described (2Xu X-Z.S. Choudhury A. Li X. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 5Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F.

PDZ-PDZ interactions can occur between disparate proteins (5Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In the case of nNOS-syntrophin binding, both proteins contain only a single PDZ domain, and the PDZ-PDZ binding interaction is considered a mechanism to allow nNOS to affiliate with the dystrophin complex (5Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S.

In contrast, InaD has five distinct PDZ domains which enable InaD to sequester and regulate receptor, signaling, and effector proteins of the rhodopsin phototransduction system of Drosophila. InaD is central to the spatiotemporal orchestration of events that culminate in photoreceptor activity and subsequent desensitization. Oligomerization of InaD through the third and fourth PDZ domains of separate InaD proteins is considered to amplify the capacity and complexity of InaD sequestered proteins. EBP50 by itself, with only two PDZ domains, has a limited capacity to sequester arrays of proteins into membrane microdomains. In the renal proximal tubule, where EBP50 has been studied in greatest detail, EBP50 can bind at least three discrete proteins to its PDZ domains (8Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 10Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Premont R.T. Rahman N. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

This includes the concurrent binding and activity modulation of β2-adrenergic receptor or GRK6A with NHE3 (10Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Premont R.T. Rahman N. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J.

As evidence for multiple protein interactions between EBP50, regulatory proteins, and effector proteins continues to emerge, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that could coordinate these interactions is required. Accordingly, the capacity of EBP50 to oligomerize into trimers and tetramers, rather than simple dimers (Fig.5), further extends the potential of EBP50 to sequester interactive proteins within membrane microdomains. In this regard, EBP50 self-association seems more likely to resemble the InaD paradigm, serving as a mechanism to congregate and integrate interactive signaling, regulatory, and effector proteins.

One critical phosphoprotein substrate inChlamydomonas is the 138-kDa intermediate chain (IC138) of the inner arm dyneins (Habermacher, G., and Sale, W. S. (1997)J. Cell Biol. 136, 167–176). In this study, several approaches were used to determine that casein kinase I (CKI) is physically anchored in the flagellar axoneme and regulates IC138 phosphorylation and dynein activity. First, using a videomicroscopic motility assay, selective CKI inhibitors rescued dynein-driven microtubule sliding in axonemes isolated from paralyzed flagellar mutants lacking radial spokes. Rescue of dynein activity failed in axonemes isolated from these mutant cells lacking IC138. Second, CKI was unequivocally identified in salt extracts from isolated axonemes, whereas casein kinase II was excluded from the flagellar compartment. Third, Western blots indicate that within flagella, CKI is anchored exclusively to the axoneme. Analysis of multipleChlamydomonas motility mutants suggests that the axonemal CKI is located on the outer doublet microtubules. Finally, CKI inhibitors that rescued dynein activity blocked phosphorylation of IC138. We propose that CKI is anchored on the outer doublet microtubules in position to regulate flagellar dynein.

One of the primary questions is how dynein activity is regulated. The focus of this report is based on a series of studies revealing that the flagellar central pair apparatus and radial spokes play a primary role in regulation of flagellar dynein activity (3.Smith E.F.

The regulatory mechanism involves a structural network of axonemal kinases and phosphatases that control phosphorylation of key subunits within the inner arm dyneins (5.Howard D. Habermacher G.

These conclusions are based on genetic analysis and in vitrofunctional studies of flagella from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. For example, mutations that disrupt either the central pair or the radial spokes result in flagellar paralysis (2.Porter M.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 3.Smith E.F. Lefebvre P.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 38: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,18.Dutcher S.K. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 398-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These paralyzed axonemes undergo dynein-driven microtubule slidingin vitro (19.Witman G.B. Plummer J. Sander G. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 76: 729-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) but at greatly reduced rates of sliding when compared with wild-type axonemes (20.Smith E.F. Sale W.S. Science. 1992; 257: 1557-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Reconstitution and functional assays demonstrate that the radial spokes are required for wild-type dynein activity, and the velocity of dynein-driven microtubule sliding is mediated by posttranslational modification of the inner dynein arms (20.Smith E.F. Sale W.S. Science. 1992; 257: 1557-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with other evidence indicating that the central pair/radial spoke apparatus along with the dynein regulatory complex controls dynein activity (14.Porter M.E. Power J.

The challenge has been to define the biochemical signaling pathway and to determine how this biochemistry can be altered by mechanical interaction between the central pair structures, radial spoke structures, and outer doublet microtubule components to control dynein activity. Diverse experimental systems have revealed that ciliary and flagellar motility is controlled by phosphorylation and that the protein kinases and phosphatases responsible for regulation are anchored in the axoneme (27.Brokaw C.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1987; 35: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 28.Hasagawa E. Hayashi H. Asukura S. Kamiya R. Cell Motil.

Cytoskeleton. 1995; 32: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, we postulate that phosphorylation regulates dynein activity, and key kinases and phosphatases are anchored in the axoneme near the dynein arms or in the central pair/radial spoke structures. Consistent with this hypothesis, exogenously added protein kinase inhibitors including PKI and the type II regulatory subunit of PKA rescue wild-type microtubule sliding in isolated axonemes lacking radial spokes (5.Howard D. Habermacher G. Glass D. Smith E.F. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vitro reconstitution experiments using double mutants lacking the radial spokes and selected subsets of dynein arm structures reveal that one of the dyneins, inner arm dynein I1, is required for rescue of dynein activity (7.Habermacher G. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The simplest model is that PKA is anchored in the axoneme and controls dynein activity and that the control mechanism requires changes in phosphorylation of inner arm dynein I1. I1 is important for control of flagellar waveform (12.Brokaw C.J. Kamiya R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1987; 8: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 15.King S.J. Dutcher S.K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), is functionally linked to the central pair apparatus/radial spoke system (14.Porter M.E. Power J. Dutcher S.K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1163-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 26.Myster S. Knott J. Wysoki K.M. O'Toole E. Porter M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 801-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and contains the Tctex light chain postulated to play a role in meiotic drive in t-haplotype mice (34.Harrison A. Olds-Clarke P. King S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We predict I1 contains the critical phosphoprotein subunit required for control of dynein activity, and the 138-kDa intermediate chain (IC138) of I1 is the only phosphoprotein in this complex (7.Habermacher G. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Importantly, phosphorylation of IC138 correlates with inhibition of dynein, and dephosphorylation of IC138 correlates with rescue of dynein activity. It is now apparent that control of dynein is more complex than we initially thought. PKA inhibitors such as PKI fail to block phosphorylation of IC138 at concentrations that rescue activity. Therefore, we conclude that additional axonemal kinases are involved in the phosphorylation of IC138. Based on other studies (33.Chaudhry P. Creagh S., Yu, N. Brokaw C.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 32: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 35.Walczak C.E. Anderson R.A. Nelson D.L. Biochem.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5452-5457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and preliminary pharmacological analysis, we postulate one of the casein kinases (38.Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 123-164PubMed Google Scholar) is anchored on doublet microtubules and directly phosphorylates IC138. In this study, we show that CKI is located in the axoneme, and inhibitors of CKI block phosphorylation of IC138 and rescue dynein activity in paralyzed axonemes. We postulate that axonemal CKI operates in concert with the axonemal PKA in a network to control flagellar waveform through regulation of inner arm dynein phosphorylation. The results provide an additional connection in the physical circuitry of axonemal enzymes that control motility and offer a new opportunity to define the mechanism for anchoring CKI to the cytoskeleton (39.Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell. Signalling. 1998; 10: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The double mutantspf28pf30 and pf14pf30 were described previously (7.Habermacher G. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 40.Piperno G. Ramanis Z. Smith E.F. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 41.Smith E.F. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Dr. E. H. Harris (Duke University andChlamydomonas Genetics Center) provided wild-type CC-124 and other mutant cell strains. With the exception of pf14pf30, all cells were grown in liquid-modified medium I (42.Witman G.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) with aeration over a 14:10 light/dark cycle. pf14pf30 cells were grown on agar plates for 4 days prior to harvesting and suspension in liquid medium (7.Habermacher G. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). PKI, a peptide based on residues 6–22 of the α-isoform of the heat-stable inhibitor of PKA, was synthesized and stored as described previously (5.Howard D. Habermacher G. Glass D. Smith E.F. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). 5,6-Dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB, Calbiochem) was stored as a 10 mm stock solution in ethanol and N-(2-aminoethyl)-5-chloroisoquinoline-8-sulfonamide (CKI-7, Toronto Research Chemicals, North York, Canada) was stored as a 50 mm stock solution in Me2SO. [γ-32P]ATP, 3000 Ci/mmol, was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Peptide substrates for CKI, CKII, and PKA (Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly, Kemptide) were purchased from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies include anti-ChlamydomonasIC140 (43.Yang P. Sale W.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3335-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), anti-Chlamydomonas flagellar type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1) (8.Yang P. Fox L. Colbran R.J. Sale W.S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 91-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), anti-chicken CKI (44.Fu Z. Green C.L. Bennett G.S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 830-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and anti-Drosophila CKII catalytic and regulatory subunits (45.Dahmus G.K. Glover C.V. Brutlag D.L. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9001-9006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Except as noted, all other chemicals were from Sigma, and deionized water was used throughout. Measurement of microtubule sliding velocity was performed as described previously (5.Howard D. Habermacher G. Glass D. Smith E.F. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6.Habermacher G. Sale W.S. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1899-1907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46.Okagaki T. Kamiya R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1895-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Flagella were isolated as described previously (41.Smith E.F. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and demembranated with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Calbiochem) in motility buffer (10 mm Hepes, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 50 mm potassium acetate) except that all protease inhibitors were left out of the motility buffer. The axoneme sample was then added to a glass perfusion chamber and rinsed with motility buffer containing 1 mm ATP (and appropriate inhibitor or solvent control) to remove nonadhering axonemes. Motility was initiated by perfusion of 1 mm ATP in motility buffer containing 1.5 μg/ml Nagarse. Microtubule sliding was recorded by dark-field video and measured as described previously (5.Howard D. Habermacher G. Glass D. Smith E.F. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6.Habermacher G. Sale W.S. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1899-1907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Flagella and axonemes were isolated as described using the dibucaine procedure (41.Smith E.F. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and suspended in Buffer A (30 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 trypsin inhibitory unit of aprotinin, pH 7.4) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Axonemes were sedimented by centrifugation and resuspended in Buffer A at ∼2 mg/ml. Protein concentration was determined by the Coomassie Blue binding assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For gel electrophoresis, protein samples were fixed in 5× sample buffer, unless stated otherwise, for SDS-PAGE or in-gel kinase assay. For isolation of flagellar dyneins, axonemes were extracted at 8–10 mg/ml with 0.57 m NaCl in Buffer A. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was dialyzed into Buffer A, and 0.6 ml of the dialyzed extract was layered onto a 5–20% sucrose gradient in the same buffer and sedimented for 16 h at 36,000 rpm in a SW 41 rotor (Beckman) at 4 °C; 20 fractions were collected. For isolation of axonemal CKI, axonemes were extracted at 5 mg/ml in Buffer A containing 0.27 m NaCl. Following dialysis in the appropriate buffer, the extract was fractionated either by velocity sedimentation on sucrose gradients as described above or by DEAE ion exchange chromatography. DEAE chromatography was carried out as previously described (47.Hathaway G.M. Traugh J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 308-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with modification. The 0.3 m NaCl extract was dialyzed into DEAE buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol), loaded onto a DEAE column (3–5 ml) (Sigma), and washed with 30 ml of DEAE buffer, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min from 15 ml of a linear 0.0–0.7 m NaCl gradient in DEAE buffer. In some experiments, the peak CKI fractions from sucrose gradients (made in Buffer A containing 30 mm NaCl) were fractionated by P-11 phosphocellulose chromatography as described previously (47.Hathaway G.M. Traugh J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 308-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, cellulose phosphate (Whatman, Kent, United Kingdom) was precycled following the manufacturer's instruction and equilibrated in P-11 buffer (25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA) containing 25 mm NaCl. The peak kinase activity fractions from sucrose gradient sedimentation were pooled, dialyzed in 25 mm NaCl in P-11 buffer, and loaded onto a 5-ml P-11 column. The column was washed in the same buffer, and fractions were eluted with a 15-ml linear 0.025–1.25 mNaCl gradient in P-11 buffer. The gradient was applied at 0.5 ml/min, and about 0.8-ml fractions were collected. Affinity purification of CKI was performed using α-casein conjugated to an agarose matrix (Sigma). α-Casein-conjugated agarose beads (40 μl) were added to 200 μl of the DEAE CKI-containing fraction that was diluted with an equal volume of 2× CK reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol, 7 mm magnesium acetate, 0.02% Brij 35, 20 mm NaCl, and 100 μm sodium orthovanadate). The mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight, and after washing with CK buffer, the proteins sedimenting with the agarose beads were fixed by suspension in 30 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For phosphorylation, purified axonemes at 5 mg/ml were suspended in CK reaction buffer in either the presence or absence of 50 μm CKI-7 or 200 nm PKI. 20-μl samples were preincubated for 20–30 min at 30 °C, and [γ-32P]ATP was added to a final concentration of 40 μm (5000 cpm/pmol). The reaction was terminated at 2 min by adding electrophoresis sample buffer. For sucrose gradient fractionation of phosphorylated axonemal proteins, the reaction was scaled up to 500 μl of 10 mg/ml axoneme. Following phosphorylation, axonemes were sedimented at 14,000 × g in a microcentrifuge and resuspended in Buffer A containing 0.57 m NaCl and 10 μmmicrocystin-LR to block phosphatase activity. Salt-extracted axonemes were separated from the extract by sedimentation, and the extract was dialyzed in Buffer A and subjected to velocity sedimentation on sucrose gradients. For analysis of CKI autophosphorylation, each reaction contained 1× CK reaction buffer, 14 μl of the DEAE fraction, and 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP (2000 cpm/pmol) in a total final volume of 20 μl. Before addition of ATP, DEAE fractions were preincubated in CK buffer either in the presence or absence of 50 μm DRB for 20 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylation was initiated by the addition of 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and terminated after 10 min by the addition of 5× sample buffer. In some cases, 1 μg of α-casein was included as a substrate. Fractions were assessed for kinase activity using specific peptide substrates. For casein kinase activity, 2-μl samples from gradient fractions or chromatography fractions were added to a reaction mixture to a final volume of 20 μl containing CK reaction buffer, 0.5 mg/ml CKI or CKII specific substrate, and 40 μm [γ-32P]ATP (2000 cpm/pmol). For PKA activity, 2-μl samples from fractions were added to the reaction mixture to a final volume of 20 μl containing 25 mm MES, pH 6, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 0.025% β-mercaptoethanol, 2 μl of the fraction, 2.5 mg/ml Kemptide, and 150 μm [γ-32P]ATP. After 45 min at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by adding 1 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid. 10-μl samples from each reaction were applied in duplicate to discs of P-81 filter paper (Whatman), washed extensively with 75 mm phosphoric acid, and rinsed with acetone. The radioactivity of the dried p-81 paper discs was measured by scintillation counting. In-gel kinase assays were carried out as described previously (48.Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) with modification. A stock solution of 10 mg/ml dephosphorylated casein (Sigma) in 1× resolving buffer was added to a 9% acrylamide gel mixture to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml casein. Following electrophoresis, the gel was washed twice with ∼250 ml of 20% isopropyl alcohol in Buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min each, and then washed with Buffer B alone for 30 min. For renaturation of proteins, the gel was immersed in ∼250 ml of 0.04% Tween 20 in Buffer B at 4 °C overnight. The buffer was changed at least six times during the overnight incubation period. The gel was then incubated in 10 ml of Buffer C (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmMnCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at 30 °C for 30 min. Phosphorylation was carried out by incubating the gel in Buffer C with 7 μl of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 3 h. To control for ATP binding, [α-32P]ATP was used, and in some cases myelin basic protein was used in place of casein. The reaction was terminated, and free nucleotides were rinsed away by gentle shaking of the gel in ∼250 ml of fixative solution (10 mm sodium pyrophosphate and 5% trichloroacetic acid) for 20 min with 5–7 solution changes. The gel was dried for phosphor imaging following Coomassie Blue staining. For Western blots, samples separated with SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) and incubated with the first antibody (affinity-purified anti-CKI-(183–249) at a 1:200 dilution, anti-PP1 at a 1:5000 dilution, or anti-IC140 at a 1:5000 dilution). This was followed by addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL detection (8.Yang P. Fox L. Colbran R.J. Sale W.S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 91-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Yang P. Sale W.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3335-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Radial spokes operate in part to control axonemal kinases that otherwise would inhibit dynein activity (5.Howard D. Habermacher G. Glass D. Smith E.F. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6.Habermacher G. Sale W.S. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1899-1907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Habermacher G. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 8.Yang P. Fox L. Colbran R.J. Sale W.S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 91-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We postulated that an axonemal casein kinase inhibits dynein-driven microtubule sliding in paralyzed axonemes lacking the radial spokes. The paralyzed, radial spoke mutant pf14 was selected for our experiments because dynein activity is greatly reduced in pf14 axonemes, and dynein activity can be rescued inpf14 with kinase inhibitors (5.Howard D. Habermacher G. Glass D. Smith E.F. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The prediction was that using a videomicroscopic motility assay, inhibitors of casein kinases would rescue wild-type dynein-driven microtubule sliding inpf14 axonemes. We have shown that the key phosphatases required to rescue dynein activity are also built into the structure (5.Howard D. Habermacher G. Glass D. Smith E.F. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6.Habermacher G. Sale W.S. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1899-1907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Habermacher G. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 8.Yang P. Fox L. Colbran R.J. Sale W.S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 91-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As described previously, the velocity of microtubule sliding (∼7 μm/s) is greatly reduced in axonemes from pf14mutants compared with microtubule sliding (∼14–16 μm/s) in axonemes from wild-type cells (Fig. 1). Treatment of isolated pf14 axonemes with the casein kinase inhibitors, DRB (100 μm) or CKI-7 (50 μm) increased the velocity of microtubule sliding to ∼13 μm/s (Fig. 1,A and B), rescuing dynein-driven microtubule sliding. The effects of both DRB and CKI-7 were dose-dependent, with half-maximal activity achieved with ∼50 μm DRB and ∼25 μm CKI-7. Supplementing CKI-7 with PKI had no additional effect on microtubule sliding compared with addition of CKI-7 alone. CKI-7 failed to rescue wild-type sliding in axonemes from the double mutantpf14pf30 (Fig. 1 C), which lacks both the radial spokes and inner arm dynein I1 (when compared with Ref. 7.Habermacher G. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that the isolated axoneme contains a casein kinase that inhibits dynein activity in paralyzed mutants lacking radial spokes and that the inner arm dynein I1 is required for rescue. Based on the selectivity and K i of CKI-7 for CKI, when compared with CKII, PKA, or Ca2+/calmodulin kinase (49.Chijiwa T. Hagiwara M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4924-4927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50.Shugar D. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 411-419PubMed Google Scholar), the results indicate that CKI is responsible for inhibition of dynein. We tested this hypothesis with direct biochemical approaches. Axonemes were isolated from wild-type cells and extracted in a 0.3 m NaCl-containing buffer. The dialyzed extract was then fractionated by one of three methods, and fractions were analyzed for CKI, CKII, and PKA activity using specific peptide substrates and an in-gel kinase assay (Fig.2). Based on substrate specificity, CKI activity (Fig. 2, top panels, open squares) was most prominent in axonemal extracts. CKI was the first kinase to elute from a DEAE ion exchange column (Fig. 2 A, top panel, fractions 9–11), and α-casein was an equally effective substrate for this kinase (data not shown). PKA and CKII activities were also detectable but at much lower levels and in later fractions. Using an in-gel kinase assay with casein embedded in the gel, a prominent 39-kDa axonemal kinase was detected with peak activity in fractions 9–11 (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). This same kinase activity was greatly reduced when myelin basic protein was used as a substrate. The 39-kDa axonemal kinase co-fractionated with CKI activity as an 8 S peak in sucrose gradients (Fig. 2 B), and P-11 phosphocellulose chromatography of the pooled sucrose gradient fractions 15–19 also resulted in a peak of CKI activity that precisely co-fractionated with the 39-kDa axonemal kinase (Fig. 2 C). In every case, either DRB or CKI-7 inhibited the phosphorylation of CKI-peptide subst"
https://openalex.org/W2005595613,"We postulated that the syntaxins, because of their key role in SNARE complex formation and exocytosis, could be important targets for signaling by intracellular kinases involved in secretion. We found that syntaxin 4 was phosphorylated in human platelets treated with a physiologic agent that induces secretion (thrombin) but not when they were treated with an agent that prevents secretion (prostacyclin). Syntaxin 4 phosphorylation was blocked by inhibitors of activated protein kinase C (PKC), and, in parallel assays, PKC inhibitors also blocked secretion from thrombin-activated platelets. In platelets, cellular activation by thrombin or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate decreased the binding of syntaxin 4 with SNAP-23, another platelet t-SNARE. Phosphatase inhibitors increased syntaxin 4 phosphorylation and further decreased syntaxin 4-SNAP-23 binding induced by cell activation. Conversely, a PKC inhibitor blocked syntaxin 4 phosphorylation and returned binding of syntaxin 4-SNAP-23 to that seen in nonstimulated platelets. In vitro, PKC directly phosphorylated platelet syntaxin 4 and recombinant syntaxin 4. PKC phosphorylation in vitro inhibited (71 ± 8%) the binding of syntaxin 4 to SNAP-23. These results provide evidence that extracellular activation can be coupled through intracellular PKC signaling so as to modulate SNARE protein interactions involved in platelet exocytosis.

The fusion of secretory vesicle membranes with the plasmalemma is mediated by the core SNARE1 complex (1Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar). This complex is a closely packed helical bundle formed by three membrane proteins derived from different gene families: the syntaxins, the VAMPs (or synaptobrevins), and the SNAP-25 family (2Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 3Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). The SNARE proteins interact with each other through conserved sequences of about 60 amino acids, known as a SNARE motif (4Weimbs T. Low S.H. Chapin S.J. Mostov K.E. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3046-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The syntaxins play a key role in SNARE complex formation and exocytosis, because they interact with several other proteins that are believed to modulate exocytosis such as the Sec1/Munc-18 proteins, Munc13, synaptotagmin, Ca2+channels, and others (reviewed in Refs. 5Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 6Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 7Gerst J.E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 707-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Regulated exocytosis occurs after cell activation or membrane depolarization through intracellular signaling by Ca2+ and, potentially, by kinases, phospholipids, etc. In neurons, synaptotagmin I appears to be one of the molecules that transduces the Ca2+ signal to the exocytotic process through its interactions with syntaxin 1 (8Geppert M. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 75-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). There is also a growing realization that phosphorylation could play a key role in regulating SNARE complex interactions. Recent in vitro studies suggest that the syntaxins also serve as direct substrates for intracellular kinases such as casein kinase II (CKII), protein kinase A (PKA), and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) (9Hirling H. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11945-11949Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 10Foster L.J. Yeung B. Mohtashami M. Ross K. Trimble W.S. Klip A.

However, the physiologic significance of these observations is unclear because syntaxin phosphorylation has not been demonstratedin vivo. Platelets are highly specialized secretory cells that have a well characterized pattern of cell activation and intracellular signaling. Platelet activation by specific extracellular agonists such as thrombin, collagen, or ADP triggers exocytosis of molecules from vesicles known as the alpha and dense granules (12Holmsen H. Colman R.W. Hirsh J. Marder V.J. Salzman E.W. Hemostasis and Thrombosis. J. P. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia, PA1994: 524-545Google Scholar). Platelet activation causes increased intracellular Ca2+, the production of inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate, diacylglycerol (DAG), and the activation of PKC, as well as other kinases. Although increases in intracellular Ca2+ are sufficient to induce platelet exocytosis, there is evidence that PKC activity may interact with Ca2+ synergistically to amplify platelet secretion (13Blockmans D. Deckmyn H. Vermylen J. Blood Rev. 1995; 9: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar,14Walker T.R. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others have shown that platelets contain non-neuronal isoforms of v- and t-SNAREs, including syntaxin 4, SNAP-23, and platelet VAMP (15Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Fitzgerald M.L. Blood. 1999; 93: 2617-2626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lemons P.P. Chen D. Bernstein A.M. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 1490-1500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Flaumenhaft R. Croce K. Chen E. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2492-2501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Platelets also contain an Sec1 homologue that is likely to modulate platelet secretion through its binding to syntaxin 4 (15Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Fitzgerald M.L. Blood. 1999; 93: 2617-2626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regulated exocytosis of alpha and dense granules requires N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor activity (18Polgar J. Reed G.L. Blood. 1999; 94: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and granule release is mediated in part by syntaxin 4, VAMP (17Flaumenhaft R. Croce K. Chen E. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2492-2501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and SNAP-23 (19Chen D. Bernstein A.M. Lemons P.P. Whiteheart S.W. Blood. 2000; 95: 921-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). How regulated exocytosis is linked to cell activation through intracellular signaling by kinases remains an unanswered question. We hypothesized that the syntaxins, by virtue of their critical role in vesicle fusion, could be targets of intracellular kinases whose signaling activity is coupled to cell activation. We found that syntaxin 4 was phosphorylated when cells are activated by thrombin to induce secretion. PKC inhibitors significantly reduced both syntaxin 4 phosphorylation and platelet secretion. In contrast to previousin vitro studies (10Foster L.J. Yeung B. Mohtashami M. Ross K. Trimble W.S. Klip A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11089-11096Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 11Risinger C. Bennett M.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 614-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) we found that PKC directly phosphorylated syntaxin 4 with a stoichiometry of 0.8 mol of phosphate/mol of syntaxin 4. Stimulation of PKC in thrombin-activated platelets decreased the interaction of syntaxin 4 with SNAP-23 as detected by coimmunoprecipitation studies. In vitrophosphorylation of syntaxin 4 by PKC also decreased syntaxin 4 binding to SNAP-23. These studies provide the first demonstration of syntaxin 4 phosphorylation in vivo and indicate that intracellular signaling by kinases may play a modulatory role in linking the processes of cell activation to regulated exocytosis. Recombinant (r-) syntaxin 4 was produced in bacteria and purified on glutathione-Sepharose as described previously (15Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Fitzgerald M.L. Blood. 1999; 93: 2617-2626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human r-SNAP-23 (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) was expressed as an N-terminal 6-His fusion protein via the pProEX HTA vector (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) in bacteria and purified on Ni-agarose as described previously (18Polgar J. Reed G.L. Blood. 1999; 94: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Freshly isolated platelets (18Polgar J. Reed G.L. Blood. 1999; 94: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were centrifuged and resuspended in buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgSO4, 10 mm glucose, 0.5 mm EDTA). Platelets (1 × 109 cells/ml) were metabolically loaded with 500 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (NEN Life Science Products) at 30 °C for 1 h. Metabolically labeled platelets were incubated with and without inhibitors (see Table I for details, all inhibitors were from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) for 15 min at 30 °C. Then thrombin (1 unit/ml), PGI2 (10 μm), or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (1 μm) was added to the cells. The platelets were promptly solubilized in lysis buffer (0.5% SDS, 50 mmNaH2PO4, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). After boiling for 5 min, the samples were diluted with 1.25× radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (1.25% Nonidet P-40, 1.25% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium vanadate, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 100 units/ml aprotinin, pH 7.2), incubated overnight at 4 °C and spun at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, and the resulting supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Phosphoproteins were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Storm 840, Molecular Dynamics). The same membranes were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-syntaxin 4 antibodies.Table IThe effects of PKC inhibitors on thrombin-induced syntaxin 4 phosphorylation and platelet secretionPKC inhibitorsRelative secretion in intact cellsRelative syntaxin 4 phosphorylationIn intact cellsIn permeabilized cellsRo-31-8220 (1 μm)0.24 ± 0.09 (3)0.52 ± 0.15 (3)0.47 ± 0.06 (3)Gö-6983 (1 μm)0.59 (2)0.43 (1)0.48 (2)Gö-6976 (1 μm)1.02 (2)0.70 (2)0.81 (2)In secretion experiments, platelets with [14C]serotonin-loaded dense granules were incubated with and without PKC inhibitors for 15 min before activation with 1 unit/ml thrombin for 30 s or 1 min at 30 °C.

Phosphorylation in permeabilized cells, antibody production, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and binding assays were performed as described previously (15Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Fitzgerald M.L. Blood. 1999; 93: 2617-2626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An anti-syntaxin 4 antisera, a monoclonal anti-syntaxin 4 antibody (Transduction laboratories, Lexington, KY), or an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) was used. The binding of syntaxin 4 to SNAP-23 was studied in a solid-phase assay (15Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Fitzgerald M.L. Blood. 1999; 93: 2617-2626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wells of a microtiter plate were coated with r-SNAP-23 (25 μl of 10 μg/ml) for 1–2 h and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. PKC-phosphorylated or mock-phosphorylated (incubated with phosphorylation reagents but not PKC) syntaxin 4 (25 μl of 4 μg/ml) was added for 16–36 h at 4 °C. Then, anti-syntaxin 4 antibody was added for 1 h. After washing, the bound anti-syntaxin 4 antibody was detected by 125I-protein A (50,000 cpm/25 μl). Freshly isolated platelets (18Polgar J. Reed G.L. Blood. 1999; 94: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were centrifuged and resuspended in buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 0.35% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 mm EDTA). Platelets (1 × 109 cells/ml) were pretreated with and without 1 μm Ro-31-8220 for 30 min at 30 °C or phosphatase inhibitors (5 mm sodium fluoride and 5 mm sodium vanadate) for 5–10 min at 30 °C. Then platelets were subsequently incubated with thrombin (1 unit/ml) for 1.5 min at 30 °C, PGI2 (10 μm) for 1 h at 30 °C, or PMA (1 μm) for 5 min at 30 °C. The platelets were promptly solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 2% Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 50 mm sodium vanadate, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), left on ice for 30 min, and spun at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation. The platelet lysates were precleared by incubating with protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifugation. The supernatants were further incubated with a monoclonal anti-syntaxin 4 antibody for 2 h at 4 °C and with rat anti-mouse kappa chain Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing with 1× radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, the immunoprecipitates were detected with antibodies against SNAP-23 (Synaptic Systems, Gottingen, Germany) and syntaxin 4. Bound antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence and quantitated by phosphorimaging under conditions where there was a linear relationship between intensity and pixel number. As described previously (19Chen D. Bernstein A.M. Lemons P.P. Whiteheart S.W. Blood. 2000; 95: 921-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Richards-Smith B. Novak E.K. Jang E.K. He P. Haslam R.J.

Metab. 1999; 68: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), SNAP-23 migrated as a pair of bands at 28–29 kDa; both bands were quantitated in our analysis. Recombinant syntaxin 4 was cleaved from GST by thrombin, and cleavage was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Various amounts of syntaxin 4 were incubated at 30 °C in the presence or absence of purified PKC (Upstate Biotechnology) or 0.1 unit of recombinant PKC isozymes (Panvera, Madison, WI). Assays were carried out in 20 mmMOPS buffer, pH 7.2, containing 25 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, 0.1 mg/ml diacylglycerol, 15 mmMgCl2, and 100 μm of ATP and [γ32P]ATP (final specific activity 2000 μCi/μmol). Phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and a PhosphorImager. For stoichiometry experiments, the phospho-syntaxin 4 band was excised, and 32P incorporation was assessed by scintillation counting. [14C]Serotonin-labeled platelets (18Polgar J. Reed G.L. Blood. 1999; 94: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were incubated with and without inhibitors (Table I) for 15 min at 30 °C. Secretion was induced by thrombin (1 unit/ml) for 30 s or 1 min at 30 °C. One volume of ice-cold 5% formaldehyde, 50 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, was added to stop the reaction, the sample was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 2.5 min, and the supernatants were analyzed by scintillation counting. Samples containing 0.2% Triton X-100 were used for the measurement of total cellular [14C]serotonin. Basal release, in the absence of stimulant, was typically less than 5% of total [14C]serotonin content. Data are generally expressed as mean ± S.E. The statistical significance of differences between paired samples was assessed by a paired Student's t test. Platelet exocytosis is triggered by intracellular signals initiated by physiologic cell activators such as thrombin. To determine whether syntaxin 4 was a substrate for platelet kinases activated by thrombin, we examined phosphoproteins in cells metabolically loaded with 32PO4. First we established that syntaxin 4 was specifically immunoprecipitated from platelet lysates by our anti-syntaxin 4 antibodies but not by control IgG antibodies nor by anti-syntaxin 4 antibodies preadsorbed with syntaxin 4 proteins (Fig. 1, Aand B, immunoblot). Platelets loaded with32PO4 were incubated with PGI2 (an agent that activates PKA and blocks cell activation and secretion), thrombin, or no agent (resting). Treatment of platelets with PGI2 did not induce syntaxin 4 phosphorylation (Fig.1 A). Minimal if any syntaxin 4 phosphorylation was seen in unstimulated (resting) platelets. However, as shown in Fig.1 A, thrombin activation of platelets strongly induced syntaxin 4 phosphorylation. A similar pattern of syntaxin 4 phosphorylation was seen in permeabilized platelets loaded with [γ32P]ATP and treated with the same agents (Fig.1 B and data not shown). Thrombin activation of platelets can induce protein phosphorylation by several different kinases. We examined the simultaneous effects of cell-permeable kinase inhibitors on both syntaxin 4 phosphorylation and secretion. Because our initial studies of thrombin-activated platelets with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody did not detect tyrosine phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 (not shown), we focused our studies on inhibitors of serine/threonine kinases. Inhibitors of several different kinases (PKA, CaMKII, CKII, and others) had minimal if any effects on syntaxin 4 phosphorylation and secretion (data not shown). However, PKC inhibitors significantly decreased both syntaxin 4 phosphorylation and platelet secretion. Ro-31-8220, a general inhibitor of all PKC isoforms, reduced syntaxin 4 phosphorylation by 48 ± 15% to the same extent that it inhibited the phosphorylation of pleckstrin (49 ± 2.7%), a direct PKC substrate (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, the general PKC inhibitor Gö-6983 also reduced syntaxin 4 phosphorylation by 52–57% in both intact and permeabilized cells. The selective inhibitor of Ca2+-dependent PKC enzyme Gö-6976 (21Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had less inhibitory effects (19–30%). Finally, phorbol ester (PMA), a PKC activator, induced the phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 (Fig.2 B), whereas PGI2, a stimulator of PKA, had no effect (Fig. 1 A). Under the same conditions used to examine syntaxin 4 phosphorylation, the PKC inhibitor (Ro-31-8220) blocked platelet granule secretion as did Gö-6983 (Table I). However, Gö-6976 had no effect, suggesting that the Ca2+-independent PKC enzymes have a role in platelet secretion. The relationship between syntaxin 4 phosphorylation and platelet secretion is summarized in Table I. General inhibitors of PKC activity such as Ro-31-8220 and Gö-6893 significantly reduced both syntaxin 4 phosphorylation and secretion. The selective inhibitor of Ca2+-dependent PKC isozymes Gö-6976 had minimal effects on syntaxin 4 phosphorylation and no effect on secretion. In these studies general PKC inhibitors coordinately blocked syntaxin 4 phosphorylation and secretion, suggesting that there is a physiologic linkage between these processes. Previous in vitro reports have suggested that recombinant syntaxin 4 is not a direct substrate for PKC (10Foster L.J. Yeung B. Mohtashami M. Ross K. Trimble W.S. Klip A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11089-11096Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 11Risinger C. Bennett M.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 614-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Because these results may have been due to abnormal protein folding of bacterially expressed r-syntaxin 4, we first examined whether native syntaxin 4 from platelets could be directly phosphorylated by PKC. Fig. 2 C shows that human platelet syntaxin 4 was phosphorylated by purified PKC (Fig.2 C). This prompted a critical re-examination of the phosphorylation of r-syntaxin 4 using different reaction conditions, times, and enzyme:substrate ratios. Using purified proteins in vitro we found that syntaxin 4 phosphorylation was time-dependent and maximal at a molar ratio of ∼1:8 (purified PKC:r-syntaxin 4) yielding a stoichiometry of 0.8 mol of phosphate/mol of syntaxin 4 (Fig. 2 D). The fact that syntaxin 4 phosphorylation was differentially inhibited by selective inhibitors of different PKC isozymes, Gö-6976 and Gö-6983 (Fig. 2 B and Table I) prompted us to examine the phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 by various PKC isozymes. Fig.2 D shows that PKC isozymes α, βI, γ, δ, ε, and ζ phosphorylated syntaxin 4 in vitro. Syntaxin 4 contains several potential PKC sites. One site is within the H3 domain (residue 216), a predicted coiled-coil structure required for protein-protein interactions, including the assembly of binary and ternary SNARE complexes. To determine whether phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 regulates its interaction with other proteins in the exocytotic pathway, we examined the effect of PKC-dependent syntaxin 4 phosphorylation on its binding with SNAP-23, another key component of SNARE complex in platelets (17Flaumenhaft R. Croce K. Chen E. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2492-2501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Under these experimental conditions, PKC phosphorylated syntaxin 4 to a stoichiometry of 0.8 mol of phosphate/mol of protein. When compared with the mock-phosphorylated syntaxin 4 (incubated with phosphorylation reagents but not PKC), the ability of PKC-phosphorylated syntaxin 4 to bind to SNAP-23 was reduced by 71 ± 8% (four independent experiments) (Fig. 3). The binding of syntaxin 4 to SNAP-23 in resting and stimulated platelets was assessed by coimmunoprecipitation of syntaxin 4-containing complexes with a monoclonal anti-syntaxin 4 antibody and quantitative immunoblotting with an anti-SNAP-23 antibody. To standardize the comparison between individual experiments, the pixel values for each SNAP-23 band were normalized to the corresponding pixel density of the syntaxin band in the same sample. Because the treatment of platelets with PGI2 did not induce syntaxin 4 phosphorylation (Fig.1 A) we compared the binding of syntaxin 4 to SNAP-23 in PGI2-treated and thrombin-activated platelets. In thrombin-activated platelets syntaxin 4-SNAP-23 binding was reduced by 12 ± 2% (four independent experiments, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4 A). A similar reduction (14 ± 1.5%) in syntaxin 4 and SNAP-23 binding was observed in thrombin-activated platelets when compared with resting platelets (Fig. 4 B). Initial studies indicated that a phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, enhanced the syntaxin 4 phosphorylation in thrombin-activated platelets by more than 2-fold, suggesting that phosphosyntaxin 4 may be subject to dephosphorylation. To maximize the effect of phosphorylation on the syntaxin 4-SNAP-23 interaction, the platelets were treated with phosphatase inhibitors (sodium fluoride and sodium vanadate) before cell activation. The phosphatase inhibitors further decreased syntaxin 4-SNAP-23 binding in thrombin-activated platelets by 25 ± 5.2% compared with resting platelets (without phosphatase inhibitors) (three independent experiments, p < 0.05). These phosphatase inhibitors also decreased the binding of syntaxin 4 to SNAP-23 by 16 ± 3.7% in thrombin-stimulated platelets compared with thrombin-stimulated platelets not treated with phosphatase inhibitors (three independent experiments, p < 0.05). These results indicate that thrombin activation of platelets, which endogenously phosphorylates syntaxin 4 through a PKC-dependent mechanism (Fig. 2), decreased the interaction of syntaxin 4 with SNAP-23. To further examine whether PKC was responsible for the reduced interaction of syntaxin 4 with SNAP-23 in thrombin-stimulated platelets, a PKC inhibitor (Ro-31-8220) was used to block thrombin-induced phosphorylation. Thrombin activation of platelets decreased the binding of syntaxin 4 with SNAP- 23 by 14% (see above) but Ro-31-8220 restored syntaxin 4-SNAP-23 binding to 95 ± 5.8% of that seen with resting platelets (Fig.5 A, three independent experiments). When PMA was used to stimulate PKC activity in platelets, syntaxin 4 binding to SNAP-23 was inhibited by 18 ± 1.5% (Fig.5 B, two independent experiments). Phosphatase inhibitors further decreased syntaxin 4-SNAP-23 binding in PMA-activated platelets by 31 ± 7.8% compared with resting platelets (from three independent experiments, p < 0.05). Phosphatase inhibitors also decreased the binding of syntaxin 4 to SNAP-23 in PMA-activated platelets by 21 ± 6.7% compared with PMA-activated platelets not treated with phosphatase inhibitors (three independent experiments, p < 0.05). Ro-31-8220 blocked the inhibitory effect of PMA on syntaxin 4-SNAP-23 interactions and restored binding to 96 ± 7.5% of the level seen in resting platelets (three independent experiments). These results provide consistent evidence that PKC activity contributes to the reduced interaction of syntaxin 4 with SNAP-23 in thrombin- or PMA-stimulated platelets. These studies establish that syntaxin 4, a key SNARE protein, is phosphorylated when platelets are activated by a physiologic agent that triggers platelet secretion. We found that PKC inhibitors blocked both syntaxin 4 phosphorylation and exocytosis. Studies with platelet syntaxin 4 confirmed that it was a direct substrate for purified PKC. Moreover, in contrast to other reports, we found that a mixture of purified PKC isoforms directly phosphorylated r-syntaxin 4 with a stoichiometry of 0.8 mol of phosphate/mol of protein. Studies with individual PKC isozymes confirmed that r-syntaxin 4 was a substrate for PKC α, βI, γ, δ, ε, and ζ. PKC phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 was functionally important, because it decreased binary interactions of syntaxin 4 with SNAP-23, both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these results provide a novel link between platelet activation and exocytosis through intracellular signaling by PKC to a component of the SNARE complex. There is a growing appreciation that intracellular signaling by kinases and second messengers plays an important role in exocytosis. Studies in synaptosomes, neuroendocrine cells, and pancreatic cells have shown that activated PKC stimulates secretion (22Coffey E.T. Sihra T.S. Nicholls D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21060-21065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chen Y.A. Duvvuri V. Schulman H. Scheller R.H. J. Biol.

Faltt P.R. Gabel J. Gromada J. Larsson O. Linstrom P. Rhodes C.J. Rorsman P. Science. 1996; 271: 813-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Previous studies in platelets have also indicated that PKC has an amplifying or synergistic interaction with Ca2+ to stimulate secretion (14Walker T.R. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 25Sloan D.C. Haslam R.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Platelets contain conventional PKCs (α, βI, βII), which are activated by Ca2+ and DAG, the novel PKCs (δ, ε, η, and θ), which require only DAG for activation, and an atypical PKC (ζ), which is not activated by either Ca2+ or DAG (26Ware J.A. Chang J.D. von Bruchhausen F. Walter U. Platelets and Their Factors. 126. Springer, New York1997: 247-296Google Scholar). Although recombinant syntaxin 4 was a substrate for PKC α, βI, γ, δ, ε, and ζ (Fig. 2 D), the limited specificities of PKC inhibitors make it difficult to determine which PKC isoforms are involved in secretion in vivo. The fact that a selective inhibitor of Ca2+-dependent PKC isozymes (21Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had no effect on platelet granule secretion and minimal effects on syntaxin phosphorylation (Table I) suggests that the Ca2+-independent PKC isozymes play a significant role in platelet secretion. It is also possible that different Ca2+-dependent or Ca2+-independent PKC isoforms act at specific steps in the secretory pathway. Despite the growing evidence that PKC modulates the level of secretion induced by intracellular Ca2+ signaling, the mechanism of this effect remains poorly understood. We focused on syntaxin 4 phosphorylation, because the syntaxins play a central role in mediating molecular interactions that may affect exocytosis. The notion that PKC promotes exocytosis through syntaxin phosphorylation is consistent with a recent report (23Chen Y.A. Duvvuri V. Schulman H. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26469-26476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) that the PKC-mediated effects on norepinephrine release in PC 12 cells could be completely blocked by the addition of exogenous syntaxin H3 domain, a region that mediates SNARE protein interactions (27Poirier M.A. Hao J.C.

Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 991-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Among potential phosphorylation sites in syntaxin 4, the site at residue 216 in the H3 domain is conserved among syntaxins (6Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 29Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arraras J.E. Elferink L.A. Peterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D. Scheller R.H.

Mutations within the H3 domain affect the ability of syntaxin 1 to interact with SNAP-25 (31Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Although the PKC phosphorylation site of syntaxin 4 remains to be determined, if syntaxin 4 is phosphorylated in this critical H3 domain, it should have effects on syntaxin 4-SNAP-23 interactions. Indeed, we found that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 blocks its binding with SNAP-23 by 71 ± 8% (Fig. 3), which represents almost complete inhibition of this t-SNARE interaction when we consider that PKC maximally incorporated 0.8 mol of phosphate per mol of syntaxin 4. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments in thrombin- or PMA-activated cells provided consistent evidence that PKC-dependent phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 reduced its binding to SNAP-23. Phosphatase inhibitors enhanced syntaxin 4 phosphorylation and further decreased syntaxin 4-SNAP-23 binding induced by cell activation. Conversely, the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 blocked syntaxin 4 phosphorylation in thrombin- or PMA-activated platelets and restored syntaxin 4-SNAP-23 binding to levels seen in resting platelets. In cells the maximal inhibitory effects on syntaxin 4-SNAP-23 binding induced by thrombin or PMA activation in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors (31%) was less than that induced by direct phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 by PKC in vitro. This may be due to the fact that a proportion of platelet syntaxin 4 is engaged in interactions with other molecules such as platelet Sec1 protein that interfere with its phosphorylation. Also, phosphatase inhibitors may not completely block dephosphorylation of phospho-syntaxin 4 in vivo. Ternary SNARE complex formation has been identified in platelets, and the functional role of the component SNARE proteins in exocytosis has been demonstrated (17Flaumenhaft R. Croce K. Chen E. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2492-2501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 19Chen D. Bernstein A.M. Lemons P.P. Whiteheart S.W. Blood. 2000; 95: 921-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that anti-syntaxin 4 antibodies coimmunoprecipitate SNAP-23 (Figs. 4 and 5) and VAMP (data not shown). However, we were unable to comment on the stoichiometry of these complexes (i.e. binary versus ternary), because the molecular identity of the VAMP in platelets is still not known. Binary t-SNARE complexes (e.g. syntaxin 4 and SNAP-23 or syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25) have not been detected in platelets or other cells. Perhaps this is because in vitro t-SNARE binary interactions occur slowly, are less stable, and promote the fast formation of the ternary complex (32Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 33Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although formation of the ternary complex is required for exocytosis, it has not been established at which stage in secretion that the SNARE complex acts (e.g. formation of a fusion stalk between membranes, enlargement of the fusion pore, full membrane fusion, and discharge of contents, etc.) (6Jahn R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33667-33673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that SNARE complexes form early and by themselves cannot drive a fusion reaction to completion (reviewed in Ref. 6Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Our experiments are consistent with the findings of Flaumenhaft et al. (17Flaumenhaft R. Croce K. Chen E. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2492-2501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) that SNARE complexes are dissociated after resting platelets are stimulated to secrete. A similar pattern of SNARE complex dissociation is seen after maximal secretion of the cortical vesicles in sea urchin eggs, a cell that resembles platelets because it has a single round of exocytosis that is not complicated by other vesicle-trafficking events (36Tahara M. Coorssen J.R. Timmers K. Blank P.S. Whalley T. Scheller R. Zimmerberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33667-33673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Similarly, SNARE complexes both assemble and can completely disassemble before vacuolar fusion in yeast (35Ungermann C. Sato K. Wickner W. Nature. 1998; 396: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to SNARE complex formation, SNARE complex dissociation may be an important step in exocytosis. PKC phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 may contribute to exocytosis by promoting disassembly of the SNARE complex. The finding that PKC phosphorylates syntaxin 4 in thrombin-activated platelets, promotes exocytosis, and blocks syntaxin 4-SNAP-23 interactions confirms and extends observations in other cells that PKC plays a critical role in modulating exocytosis. Recent studies have shown that PKC phosphorylation of other proteins alters their interactions with syntaxins: SNAP-25 (37Shimazaki Y. Nishiki T. Omori A. Sekiguchi M. Kamata Y. Kozaki S.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6929-6938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, synaptotagmin I, a putative Ca2+ sensor, which interacts with syntaxin and SNAP-25, is a substrate for PKC bothin vitro and in vivo (40Hilfiker S. Augustine G.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 515: 1Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 41Hilfiker S. Pieribone V.A. Nordstedt C. Greengard P. Czernik A.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 921-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This suggests that PKC signaling provides a link between changes in the external milieu, sensed by ligand-membrane receptor interactions, and the secretory machinery, which allows the cell to dynamically modulate secretion in response to changes in its environment.

Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1525-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 36Schaper, F., Gendo, C., Eck, M., Schmitz, J., Grimm, C., Anhuf, D., Kerr, I. M., and Heinrich, P. C.

Interestingly, Shp-2 may function as an adaptor associating with Grb2 and thereby activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) following IL-6 stimulation (20Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y.

Recently, we reported that transcripts of a cytosolic isoform of PTPε (PTPεC) are induced in M1 cells following IL-6 stimulation, suggesting the importance of PTPεC in IL-6 signaling (39Tanuma N. Nakamura K. Kikuchi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). PTPε, a member of the PTP family, was originally identified as a transmembrane protein (40Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3241-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In addition to this form, we identified a novel cytosolic isoform of rat PTPε in a screen for novel PTPs expressed in the immune system (41Nakamura K. Mizuno Y. Kikuchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 726-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). At that time, these isoforms were designated as PTPεM (PTPε transmembrane form) and PTPεC (PTPε cytosolic form). Following analysis of the PTPε gene, we reported that PTPεM and PTPεC are transcribed from a single gene by alternative promoter usage (39Tanuma N. Nakamura K. Kikuchi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). PTPεC was identified independently by Elson et al. and referred to as PTPε-cytoplasmic (42Elson A. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12235-12239Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, both human and murine counterparts of the two PTPε isoforms were identified (42Elson A. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12235-12239Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The physiological function of these isoforms has not yet been clarified. PTPεC/PTPε-cytoplasmic mRNA is constitutively expressed in lung, spleen, thymus, and peritoneal macrophages, whereas PTPεM mRNA is expressed primarily in the brain, heart, lung, and testis (39Tanuma N. Nakamura K. Kikuchi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 42Elson A. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12235-12239Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that expression of PTPεC, but not PTPεM, is up-regulated during monocytic differentiation of several cell lines (39Tanuma N. Nakamura K. Kikuchi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,42Elson A. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12235-12239Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To elucidate roles of PTPεC in IL-6 signaling, we engineered and overexpressed wild-type and a dominant negative form of PTPεC in M1 cells and analyzed the biological consequences of ectopic expression. Our findings identified an isoform-specific role for PTPεC in inhibition of Jak-STAT signaling elicited by cytokines belonging to the IL-6 family. Human recombinant IL-6 was kindly provided by Ajinomoto Co. (Yokohama, Japan). Murine LIF was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal calf serum was purchased from Intergen. All cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamate, and streptomycin plus penicillin. Cell viability was determined by propidium iodide staining and a FACScan flow cytometer (Beckton Dickinson) essentially as described previously (43Yeh J.H. Hsu S.C. Han S.H. Lai M.Z. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1795-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For analysis of CD16 expression, cells were cultured with 25 ng/ml IL-6 or 10 ng/ml LIF for 2 days. Cells were then suspended and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse CD16/32 monoclonal antibody 2.4G2 (Pharmingen) diluted at 1:200 for 30 min at 4 °C and analyzed by a FACScan with the Cell Quest program. At day 0, M1 cells and stable transfectants were seeded in 96-well plates at 5 × 103 cells/well in at least quadruplicate. At the indicated times after IL-6 or LIF treatment, cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]thymidine for 4 h, and incorporation was measured. Fifteen μg of total RNA from each cell line was prepared by the single-step acid guanidinium thiocyanate method, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes fixed and then probed with 32P-labeled cDNAs as described previously (44Urushibara N. Karasaki H. Nakamura K. Mizuno Y. Ogawa K. Kikuchi K. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 12: 603-607PubMed Google Scholar). The probes used were human c-myc cDNA (0.9-kilobase pair EcoRI–ClaI fragment),egr-1 cDNA (1.2-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment (5Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar)), and mouse IRF-1 cDNA (0.6-kilobase pair fragment of nucleotides 1466–2068). Transiently transfected human 293T cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholate, and 1 mm EDTA) with protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) were washed once in radioimmune precipitation buffer, twice in WG buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40), once in assay buffer (100 mm NaOAc, pH 5.0, and 1.6 mm DTT), and resuspended in 100 μl of assay buffer containing 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate.p-Nitrophenylphosphatase assays were performed at 30 °C for 15 min before termination by the addition of 10 μl of 5n NaOH. p-Nitrophenylphosphatase activity was positively correlated with an increase in theA 410. 50% of each immunoprecipitate was immunoblotted with anti-FLAG M2 antibody to detect the expressed protein. A series of expression plasmids was constructed by subcloning cDNAs encoding PTPεM wild type, PTPεC wild type, or a point mutant of PTPεC into pCSFneo. The pCSFneo vector is derived from plasmid pCXN2 and allows expression from the chicken β-actin promoter of subcloned cDNA with a FLAG tag at the C terminus. The PTPεC-DA contained a single amino acid substitution of an invariant aspartic acid within the D1 PTP domain to an alanine at residue 245 of PTPεC (41Nakamura K. Mizuno Y. Kikuchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 726-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (scheme in Fig. 1). The mutation was introduced by standard polymerase chain reaction-based techniques. Thirty μg of each expression plasmid was introduced into M1 cells by electroporation, and drug-resistant clones were selected in 750 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Several independently cloned cell lines were obtained for each construct. The expression of transfected proteins were assessed by immunoprecipitation-Western blot analysis with the anti-FLAG antibody. Cells treated with IL-6 or LIF for 0–15 min were collected and immediately lysed in SDS-PAGE loading buffer by sonication. Protein immunoblots were done with specific antibodies to phosphotyrosine 705 of Stat3 (New England Biolabs), Stat3 (New England Biolabs), phosphorylated Erk (anti-p-Erk), Erk2, IL-6Rα, Tyk2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), Jak1, Jak2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), and Shp-2 (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan). For immunoprecipitations, cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing Nonidet P-40 as detergent (10 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 2 mmNaF). Lysates were incubated with anti-gp130 (M-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Jak1, anti-Tyk2, or anti-FLAG antibody. Immunocomplexes were collected with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine (PY-99 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or 4G10 from Upstate Biotechnology), anti-gp130, anti-Jak1 anti-Tyk2, or anti-FLAG antibodies. Membranes were incubated in an ST buffer (62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 60 °C before reblotting. We constructed expression vectors for wild type PTPεM and PTPεC and a point mutant of PTPεC (Fig.1 A). The PTPεC mutant, PTPεC-DA, was designed to carry an alanine substitution at an invariant aspartic acid residue 245 of PTPεC. The Asp to Ala mutation within the PTP domain has been shown to impair the catalytic activity of some PTPs (45Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 46Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 47Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined catalytic activities of wild-type and mutant PTPεC using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate. In vitro p-nitrophenylphosphatase assays showed that PTPεC-DA has little or no activity with thep-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that the DA mutant of PTPε is catalytically inactive. These expression vectors were then introduced into M1 cells. Several G418-resistant clones, each transfected with either vector alone (M1-Neo), PTPεM (M1-εM), PTPεC (M1-εC), or PTPεC-DA (M1-εC-DA) were established with similar frequency, suggesting that none of these constructs had differentiation-inducing activity during the drug selection. The expression of transfected proteins was assessed by immunoprecipitation-Western blot analysis. Three independent clones for each construct expressing similar levels of exogenous proteins were selected and analyzed for further experiments (Fig. 1 C). At the mRNA level, the expression of exogenous PTPε was 3–4 times higher than that of endogenous PTPε, which mainly corresponds to PTPεM in the absence of IL-6, in these clones as shown in Fig.1 D. All transfectants had approximately the same growth rate and were morphologically indistinguishable from each other under standard culture conditions (data not shown). These clones expressed similar levels of IL-6Rα, gp130, Jak1, Jak2, Tyk2, and Shp-2 (data not shown). The mock-transfected M1-Neo clone underwent cell death after treatment with IL-6 for 3 days, similar to the parent M1 cells. The dead cells showed features typical of apoptosis such as chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation (Fig.2 A and data not shown). M1-εM and M1-εC-DA clones also died after treatment with IL-6. In M1-εC cells, however, IL-6-induced apoptosis was almost undetectable by microscopic examination. Fig. 2 B shows the time course of the IL-6-induced cell death of M1-stable clones. Again, IL-6-induced death was strongly inhibited in M1-εC cells. In contrast, M1-εM and M1-εC-DA clones were more sensitive to IL-6. Similar results were obtained when stable clones were treated with LIF, although LIF was less potent in apoptosis and CD16 induction in the M1 cells used in these studies (data not shown; see below). To examine whether overexpression of PTPεC affects not only survival but also growth arrest, DNA synthesis was measured by thymidine incorporation in stable clones treated with IL-6 at various concentrations. In M1-εC cells, IL-6-induced repression of DNA synthesis was inhibited, whereas M1-εM and M1-εC-DA cells were more sensitive to IL-6-induced repression of DNA synthesis compared with M1-Neo cells (Fig. 2 C). Next, we examined expression of CD16 by flow cytometry. As in the parent cells, a 2-day treatment of M1-Neo clones with IL-6 or LIF resulted in an increase in expression of CD16 on the cell surface (Fig.3 and data not shown). In unstimulated conditions, the level of CD16 expression in the parent cells and all transfected clones was similar. In M1-εC cells, however, induction of CD16 expression by IL-6 or LIF was suppressed. Repression of IL-6-induction of CD16 in M1-εC cells was apparently not complete, whereas LIF treatment of M1-εC cells almost failed to up-regulate CD16. This difference is presumably due to less ability of M1 cells to respond to LIF, since the level of CD16 induction by LIF was lower compared with that by IL-6 even in M1-Neo cells. The level of CD16 induction by IL-6 or LIF in M1-εM and M1-εC-DA cells was comparable with that seen in M1-Neo cells. We focused on the mechanism whereby PTPεC inhibits M1 differentiation and examined the effects of ectopic expression of PTPεC or PTPεC-DA on IL-6-induced repression of c-myc. It has been reported that the repression of c-myc is critical for IL-6-induced terminal differentiation of M1 cells (20Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi T.M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). As previously reported, c-myc mRNA is transiently increased 4 h after IL-6 treatment of M1-Neo cells, followed by repression at 24 h (Fig. 4). However, IL-6-induced repression of c-myc after 24-h treatment did not occur in M1-εC cells. Moreover, IL-6-induced activation of theIRF-1 gene, which reached a maximum level at 24 h in M1-Neo cells, was reduced in M1-εC cells. Because the repression ofc-myc and induction of IRF-1 in M1 cells are reported to be Stat3-dependent (5Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), our results suggest that IL-6-induced activation of Stat3 is impaired in M1-εC cells. In contrast, the levels of β-actin mRNA were comparable among these clones. We then examined activation states of components of the Stat3 signaling pathway. At concentrations of 2 or 25 ng/ml IL-6, tyrosine phosphorylation levels of Stat3 in M1-εC clones were decreased compared with M1-Neo cells (Fig.5 A). In M1-εC-DA cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 was slightly enhanced compared with that observed in M1-Neo cells at 25 ng/ml IL-6. The enhanced phosphorylation of Stat3 in M1-εC-DA cells was more robust at 2 ng/ml IL-6. Similar results were obtained when cells were treated with LIF (Fig. 5 B). Next, IL-6-induced activation of Jaks and gp130 in M1-stable clones was examined (Fig.6). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1, Tyk2, and gp130 was strongly inhibited in M1-εC cells, whereas it was enhanced in M1-εC-DA cells. These results suggest that PTPεC down-regulates activation of Jaks and thereby inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130 in response to IL-6 or LIF. IL-6 activation of Jak2 was not observed in our cell lines (data not shown). In M1-εM cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1, gp130, and Stat3 was comparable with that observed in M1-Neo cells (data not shown). It is known that IL-6 induces transient egr-1 expression, which requires phosphorylation of the second tyrosine residue (Tyr759) of the gp130 cytoplasmic domain (8Yamanaka Y. Nakajima K. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The Tyr759-initiated signal is thought to be mediated, in part, through the Shp-2-Ras-MAPK pathway. As noted previously, PTPεC antagonized IL-6-induced repression of c-myc and induction of IRF-1, but in contrast it did not affect transientegr-1 expression (Fig. 4). Induction ofegr-1 by IL-6 in M1-εC cells suggests that PTPεC dose not affect the Tyr759-initiated signal. To support this finding, IL-6-induced activation of Erk2 in M1-stable clones was examined. As expected, phosphorylation of Erk2 by IL-6 was similarly induced in all stable clones (Fig. 7). At this moment, it remains unsolved why Erk activation is unaffected by PTPεC expression despite suppression of Jak activation. In this study, we engineered and overexpressed wild type and mutant forms of PTPεC in M1 cells and analyzed the phenotypes induced by these constructs. Forced expression of PTPεC in M1 cells strongly inhibited growth arrest, apoptosis, and CD16 induction stimulated by IL-6 and LIF treatment. However, PTPεC-DA, a catalytically inactive form of PTPεC, did not inhibit the above responses. These results indicate that inhibition of M1 differentiation by PTPεC requires PTPase activity. Furthermore, PTPεC-DA enhanced IL-6- or LIF-induced growth arrest and apoptosis, suggesting that mutant PTPεC functions as a dominant negative and suppresses endogenous PTPs, including PTPεC itself. It has been shown that Stat3 plays a central role in IL-6-induced differentiation of M1 cells (5Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 8Yamanaka Y. Nakajima K. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To determine how PTPεC inhibits M1 differentiation, we analyzed effects of PTPεC on activation of Jak1, Tyk2, gp130, and Stat3 and found that PTPεC strongly inhibits IL-6- and LIF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of all four proteins. Analysis of genetic markers revealed that PTPεC inhibited repression of c-myc induced by IL-6. These results are consistent with the previous report that dominant negative forms of Stat3 block repression of c-myc and differentiation of M1 cells induced by IL-6 (5Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). We conclude that PTPεC inhibits IL-6- and LIF-induced differentiation of M1 cells, in part by suppressing IL-6- and LIF-induced activation of Jaks and thereby inhibiting the gp130-Stat3 pathway. Enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1, Tyk2, gp130, and Stat3 induced by the mutant PTPεC-DA construct strongly supports this hypothesis. The precise mechanism by which PTPεC suppresses tyrosine phosphorylation of Jaks is unknown. An important question is whether PTPεC directly dephosphorylates and inactivates Jaks. The mechanism of PTPεC-mediated inhibition of Jak activation is currently under investigation. Among the six tyrosine residues in the gp130 cytoplasmic region, five (Tyr759, Tyr767, Tyr814, Tyr905, and Tyr915) are phosphorylated upon ligand stimulation (12Hirano T. Nakajima K. Hibi M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Although PTPεC caused a decrease in overall level of gp130 tyrosine phosphorylation following IL-6 treatment (Fig.6 B), the phosphorylation state of individual tyrosine residues in gp130 has not been determined. Phosphorylation of Tyr759 is thought to be necessary for both induction ofegr-1 expression in M1 cells and activation of MAPK in BaF3 pro-B cells, whereas phosphorylation of Tyr767, Tyr814, Tyr905, or Tyr915 activates Stat3 (8Yamanaka Y. Nakajima K. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 20Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi T.M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Tyr759-initiated signaling is thought to be mediated in part by the Shp-2-Ras-MAPK pathway. In our experiments, PTPεC had no effect on IL-6-induced gene expression ofegr-1 or MAPK activation. These observations raise the possibility that Tyr759 phosphorylation is not affected by PTPεC. It was recently reported that Shp-2 down-regulates gp130-mediated activation of Stat3 by inactivating Jaks (35Kim H. Hawley T.S. Hawley R.G. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1525-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 36Schaper, F., Gendo, C., Eck, M., Schmitz, J., Grimm, C., Anhuf, D., Kerr, I. M., and Heinrich, P. C. (1998) Biochem.

As these authors have mentioned, loss of Shp-2 function produced a prolonged activation of Jaks, gp130, and Stat3, although the precise mechanism is unknown (35Kim H. Hawley T.S. Hawley R.G. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1525-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 38Kim H. Baumann H. Mol. Cell.

Hirano T. Immunity. 2000; 12: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In our preliminary experiments, in contrast, a dominant negative type of PTPεC, PTPεC-DA, is likely to induce an earlier onset of Stat3 phosphorylation, suggesting different modes of action for PTPεC and Shp-2. In addition, PTPεC is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, while Shp-2 is expressed ubiquitously. Thus, these two PTPs might play different roles in negative regulation of Jak-STAT signaling in response to IL-6. In contrast to PTPεC, overexpression of PTPεM did not inhibit but rather potentiated the terminal differentiation and subsequent apoptosis of M1 cells induced by IL-6 or LIF. Another important finding is that PTPε isoforms play differential roles in IL-6- or LIF-induced differentiation of M1 cells. Some PTPs, such as TC-PTP, PTPφ, and PTP-SL, have been shown to exist in multiple forms targeted to different cellular compartments, although the biological significance of their different subcellular localization has not been elucidated (47Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Pixley F.J. Lee P.S. Dominguez M.G. Einstein D.B. Stanley E.R. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Our results provide evidence that the subcellular localization of PTPεM and PTPεC can reveal their biological function. The mechanism by which PTPεM potentiates M1-differentiation remains unknown. In summary, PTPεC down-regulates IL-6- and LIF-induced Stat3 signaling by inhibiting Jak activation of M1 cells. Further investigation to elucidate the mechanism of the PTPεC-mediated inhibition of Jak activation and the identification of PTPεC-interacting protein(s), including substrate(s), will be required to fully understand how cytokine signaling is regulated.

https://openalex.org/W2079899459,"Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the major membrane-forming phospholipid in eukaryotes and can be synthesized by either of two pathways, the CDP-choline pathway or the methylation pathway. In prokaryotes only the methylation pathway was thought to occur. Recently, however, we could demonstrate (de Rudder, K. E. E., Sohlenkamp, C., and Geiger, O. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 20011–20016) that a second pathway for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis exists in Sinorhizobium (Rhizobium) meliloti involving a novel enzymatic activity, phosphatidylcholine synthase, that condenses choline and CDP-diacylglyceride in one step to form PC and CMP. Using a colony autoradiography method we have isolated mutants of S. meliloti deficient in phosphatidylcholine synthase and which are no longer able to incorporate radiolabeled choline into PC. Complementation of such mutants with a sinorhizobial cosmid gene bank, subcloning of the complementing fragment, and sequencing of the subclone led to the identification of a gene coding for a presumptive CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferase. Amplification of this gene and its expression in Escherichia coli demonstrates that it codes for phosphatidylcholine synthase. Genomes of some pathogens (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Borrelia burgdorferi) contain genes similar to the sinorhizobial gene (pcs) for phosphatidylcholine synthase. Althoughpcs-deficient S. meliloti knock-out mutants show wild type-like growth and lipid composition, they are unable to perform rapid PC biosynthesis that normally is achieved via the phosphatidylcholine synthase pathway in S. meliloti wild type. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the major membrane-forming phospholipid in eukaryotes and can be synthesized by either of two pathways, the CDP-choline pathway or the methylation pathway.

Genomes of some pathogens (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Borrelia burgdorferi) contain genes similar to the sinorhizobial gene (pcs) for phosphatidylcholine synthase. Althoughpcs-deficient S. meliloti knock-out mutants show wild type-like growth and lipid composition, they are unable to perform rapid PC biosynthesis that normally is achieved via the phosphatidylcholine synthase pathway in S. meliloti wild type. phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylcholine synthase phosphatidylserine synthase 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid kilobase(s) open reading frame polymerase chain reaction phosphatidylethanolamine monomethylphosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylglycerol cardiolipin In eukaryotic organisms the membrane lipid phosphatidylcholine (PC)1 can be synthesized by two alternative biosynthetic pathways (1.Kennedy E.P. Vance D.E. Phosphatidylcholine Metabolism. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 1-8Google Scholar). In the CDP-choline pathway, choline is activated to choline phosphate and subsequently to CDP-choline which condenses with diacylglycerol to obtain PC. In the methylation pathway, however, phosphatidylethanolamine isN-methylated three times withS-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor in order to yield PC. Only the methylation pathway of PC biosynthesis was thought to occur in prokaryotes (2.Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Cronan Jr., J.E. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1996: 35-74Google Scholar). However, in addition to the methylation pathway we could recently show a novel pathway for PC biosynthesis in the soil bacterium Sinorhizobium (Rhizobium) meliloti (3.de Rudder K.E.E. Thomas-Oates J.E. Geiger O. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6921-6928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,4.de Rudder K.E.E. Sohlenkamp C. Geiger O. J. Biol.

Sohlenkamp C. Geiger O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20011-20016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Here we describe the isolation of mutants deficient in phosphatidylcholine synthase. Complementation of such mutants, subcloning of the complementing fragment, and sequencing of the complementing DNA led to the identification of the gene for phosphatidylcholine synthase. We also demonstrate that after amplification and expression of the gene inEscherichia coli, phosphatidylcholine synthase activity can be detected in E. coli cell-free extracts.

E. coli strains were grown at 37 °C in LB medium (9.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Antibiotics were added when required to obtain the following final concentrations in milligrams/liter medium: 400 spectinomycin, 20 piperacillin, and 2 tetracycline for S. meliloti, and 200 spectinomycin, 100 carbenicillin, 50 kanamycin, and 20 tetracycline for E. coli.

Thomas-Oates J.E. Geiger O. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6921-6928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutagenized cells were then spread on MOPS minimal agar medium with sucrose (15 mm) instead of succinate as carbon source and grown at 29 °C for 4 days. The colonies were transferred to sterile filter paper discs (Whatman No. 42; 8 cm diameter) and used directly in a modified autoradiography method. The mother plates, which had retained the original colony pattern, were incubated overnight at 29 °C in order to regrow the colonies and they were subsequently stored for up to 2 weeks at 4 °C. In order to search for colonies unable to incorporate labeled choline into lipid material the filters were incubated in Petri dishes floating in a 29 °C water bath. The Petri dishes each contained 1.2 ml of MOPS minimal medium with 15 mm sucrose and 540 nCi of [methyl-14C]choline (55 mCi/mmol). After 1 h of incubation, the reaction was stopped by transfer of the filters to a Büchner funnel and addition of 20 ml of an ice-cold 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid solution. After 5 min, non-incorporated radioactivity was washed away under gentle suction on the funnel. The filters were washed once more with 50 ml of ice-cold 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, respectively. The washed replica print filters were dried in an oven at 120 °C for 20 min. The dried filters were subjected to autoradiography by a 3 days exposure to Kodak Biomax MR-1 film. Subsequently they were stained with Coomassie Blue G-250 in order to visualize the colony patterns. Recombinant DNA techniques were performed according to standard protocols (9.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A genomic DNA bank of S. meliloti 1021 was constructed in the cosmid vector pLAFR3 as described previously (10.Staskawicz B. Dahlbeck D. Keen N. Napoli C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5789-5794Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Total genomic DNA of S. melilotiwas isolated as described (6.Meade H.M. Long S.R. Ruvkun G.B. Brown S.E. Ausubel F.M. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 114-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the DNA was partially digested withSau3AI and size fractionated on a 5–20% sucrose gradient. Fragments were ligated to linearized pLAFR3 vector DNA and the ligated DNA was packaged in vitro with the DNA packaging kit of Roche Molecular Biochemicals and transduced in E. coliHB101. About 50% of the cosmid derivatives obtained comprised DNA inserts ranging in size between 22 and 40 kb. DNA was sequenced by the chain termination method (18.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52250) Google Scholar) using a SQ3 sequencer (Hoefer) and pUC19 derivatives. The DNA region sequenced and the deduced proteins were analyzed using the Omiga program (Oxford Molecular Ltd., Oxford, United Kingdom) or the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) BLAST network server (19.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58760) Google Scholar). Preliminary sequence data was obtained from The Institute for Genomic Research website and from theRhodobacter capsulatus sequencing project. Homologies of sequences were quantified by percentage of identical residues. Searches for motifs in deduced amino acid sequences were performed using the server of Kyoto Center (Japan). In order to analyze DNA restriction fragments for functional complementation they were cloned into the broad host range plasmid pRK404 (Table I). Cosmid, pRK404, or pMP92 derivatives were mobilized into S. meliloti strains by triparental mating using the mobilizing plasmid pRK2013 as described previously (20.Ruvkun G.B. Ausubel F.M. Nature. 1981; 289: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Cosmids of the sinorhizobial gene bank or pRK404 derivatives were mobilized into mutant CS07 as described above and transconjugants were selected on TY medium containing piperacillin and tetracycline. Complementation of CS07 by phosphatidylcholine synthase was investigated by the colony autoradiography method described above and from colonies able to incorporate labeled choline into lipid, cosmids were isolated, transformed in E. coli DH5α, and the respective DNA inserts were analyzed. Using PCR and specific oligonucleotides (GAATAAAGCTTTCGCATATGAAGTTCTTCAATTACAGACGC and AAAGGATCCTCAGGCACGCCCGAGTTTCGGG) the gene suspected to code for phosphatidylcholine synthase (pcs) of S. meliloti was amplified from the cosmid pCOS1 with Pfupolymerase. Suitable restriction sites (underlined) for cloning the suspected pcs gene were introduced by PCR with the oligonucleotides. After restriction with NdeI andBamHI the PCR-amplified DNA fragment was cloned into a pET9a vector (16.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar) to obtain the expression plasmid pTB2559 in which the potential pcs gene can be overexpressed under control of the T7 promoter. The correct in-frame cloning and the correct sequence was demonstrated by DNA sequencing (data not shown). E. colistrain BL21(DE3) (16.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar) which expresses the T7 polymerase under the control of the lac promoter was transformed with pTB2559. At a cell density of 5 × 108 cells/ml, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After 4 h of induction cells were harvested and stored in a freezer at −20 °C. The spectinomycin resistance conferring 2.0-kbSmaI-SmaI fragment of pHY109 was cloned into the unique MluI site of the sinorhizobial pcs gene on plasmid pTB2536 to yield pTB2160. The plasmid pTB2160 was mobilized into a wild type S. meliloti 1021. The spectinomycin cassette-inactivated pcs was recombined into the wild type genome by the plasmid-incompatibility technique as described (15.Østerås M. Boncompagni E. Vincent N. Poggi M.C. Le Rudulier D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11394-11399Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Potential double recombinants were further analyzed by Southern hybridization (data not shown) and the pcs-deficient phenotype of tetracycline-sensitive double recombinants was confirmed by the absence of phosphatidylcholine synthase activity in cell-free extracts. Frozen cells were resuspended in 10 volumes of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and cell-free extracts were prepared as described previously (3.de Rudder K.E.E. Thomas-Oates J.E. Geiger O. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6921-6928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The optimized standard assay to determine phosphatidylcholine synthase activity (4.de Rudder K.E.E. Sohlenkamp C. Geiger O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20011-20016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) contained, in a total volume of 50 μl in Eppendorf tubes, (50 μg of protein, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MnCl2, 20 μmCDP-diacylglycerol, 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 50 μm[methyl-14C]choline (55 mCi/mmol). The mixtures were incubated for 15 min in a 30 °C water bath and stopped by mixing with 188 μl of methanol/chloroform (2:1; v/v). Addition of 63 μl of chloroform and 63 μl of water led to phase separation and after washing the chloroform phase once with another 100 μl of water it was dried and quantified in a scintillation counter. Under such conditions the only radioactive compound detectable in the chloroform phase was PC. In S. meliloti, under some conditions of growth (phosphate limitation), membrane phospholipids are largely replaced by lipids that do not contain any phosphorus (21.Geiger O. Röhrs V. Weissenmayer B. Finan T.M. Thomas-Oates J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Specifically, it is thought that diacylglyceryl-N,N,N-trimethylhomoserine can functionally replace PC in membranes (22.Hofmann M. Eichenberger W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6140-6144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to be able to detect the potential formation of phosphorus-free membrane lipids inpcs-deficient mutants as well, the membrane lipid composition or synthesis of different S. meliloti strains was determined after labeling with [1-14C]acetate. Cultures (1 ml) in TY medium were inoculated from precultures grown in the same medium. After the addition of 2 μCi of [1-14C]acetate (60 mCi/mmol) at initial cell densities of 9 × 107 cells/ml to each culture, the cultures were incubated for 24 h in experiments when lipid composition was to be determined. In order to determine lipid synthesis rates, cultures were labeled with 2 μCi of [1-14C]acetate (60 mCi/mmol) or with 0.56 μCi of [methyl-14C]choline (55 mCi/mmol) at initial cell densities of 4.5 × 108cells/ml for 30 min. During this 30-min pulse, incorporation of labeled acetate or labeled choline into chloroform-soluble total lipid material occurred at linear rates, respectively. After the labeling periods, cells were harvested by centrifugation and lipids were extracted, separated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography, and quantified as described previously (3.de Rudder K.E.E. Thomas-Oates J.E. Geiger O. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6921-6928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A mutant strain of S. meliloti (IML101), unable to metabolize choline as sole carbon and nitrogen source but able to incorporate choline directly into PC, was used for the search of phosphatidylcholine synthase (Pcs)-deficient mutants. Cells ofS. meliloti IML101 were heavily mutagenized withN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine resulting in 1% survival. Mutagenized colonies were screened for the inability to incorporate labeled choline into lipid material. In the selection procedure for a potential mutant, Coomassie Blue-stained replica print filters were compared with the corresponding autoradiograms (data not shown), in an analogous way as described earlier (3.de Rudder K.E.E. Thomas-Oates J.E. Geiger O. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6921-6928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of 26,000 colonies screened, 15 candidates showed reduced incorporation of radiolabeled choline when the autoradiogram was compared with the respective Coomassie Blue-stained filter. The 15 candidates were further analyzed by directly determining the in vivo incorporation of [14C]choline into PC as described (4.de Rudder K.E.E. Sohlenkamp C. Geiger O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20011-20016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) using TLC analysis. Of the candidates, 7 were unable to incorporate radiolabeled choline into PC (data not shown) and cell-free extracts of these 7 S. meliloti mutants (CS01, CS02, CS03, CS06, CS07, CS09, and CS10) showed much reduced or no phosphatidylcholine synthase activity (TableII).Table IIIn vitro phosphatidylcholine synthase activity in cell-free extracts of S. meliloti strains and of E. coli BL21(DE3) strains expressing the potential gene for phosphatidylcholine synthase (pcs)StrainSpecific activityResidual activitypmol/mg protein/min%S. meliloti IML101181100 CS013.42 CS023.52 CS037.74 CS063.62 CS0714.18 CS095.63 CS1012.77 CS07 × pCOS1301166 CS07 × pTB2532401222 KDR5684.52 KDR568 × pTB2532391216E. coli BL21(DE3) × pET9a (+IPTG)3.82E. coli BL21(DE3) × pTB2559 (−IPTG)498275E. coli BL21(DE3) × pTB2559 (+IPTG)47802641 Open table in a new tab The Pcs-deficient mutant CS07 of S. meliloti was conjugated with E. coli strains carrying a genomic library of S. meliloti that had been constructed in the cosmid vector pLAFR3 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Screening for complemented mutants with intact Pcs activity was performed using the colony autoradiography method described above based on their regained ability to incorporate radiolabel from [14C]choline into lipid material. Of about 5500 colonies screened, 13 showed strongly increased radiolabel incorporation when autoradiograms were compared with the corresponding Coomassie Blue-stained replica print filters (data not shown). From complemented mutants forming choline-derived lipid material, the cosmids were isolated and transformed in E. coli DH5α for further analysis. Four types of overlapping cosmids were able to complement the Pcs-deficient phenotype of mutant CS07. Representatives of those types are cosmids pCOS1, pCOS14, pCOS20, and pCOS35, all containing between 30 and 37 kb of sinorhizobial DNA, two of which are indicated in Fig.1. Subcloning of restriction fragments, comprising regions of the overlapping DNA, in the broad host-range vector pRK404 and subsequent analysis for complementation of the Pcs-deficient mutant CS07 shows that a plasmid (pTB2532), containing a 4.6-kb HindIII-HindIII DNA fragment derived from pCOS1 (Fig. 1), is able to restore formation of choline-derived PC (Table II). Plasmid pTB2532 was able to restore Pcs activity in the other Pcs-deficient sinorhizobial mutants (CS01, CS02, CS03, CS06, CS09, and CS10) as well (data not shown), demonstrating that all 7 Pcs-deficient chemical mutants isolated belong to the same complementation group. The DNA sequence of the internal 4.6-kbHindIII-HindIII fragment of the Pcs-complementing plasmid pTB2532 was determined and the sinorhizobial DNA ranging from aHindIII site to a BamHI/Sau3AI site was submitted (accession number AF155772). Analysis of the sinorhizobial sequence (4599 base pairs) revealed four complete open reading frames (ORFs) (Fig. 1). Genebank searches with the NCBI BLAST program showed that the first ORF (positions 199 to 1095) encoded a protein of 299 amino acids that showed homology to the cytochromec-type biogenesis proteins of Aquifex aeolicus(accession number AE000657) (43% amino acid identity),Mycobacterium tuberculosis (ccsA gene, accession number Z95558) (40% amino acid identity), and Bacillus subtilis (ccdA gene, accession number Z99113) (35% amino acid identity). It is interesting to note that in addition to the well known Ccm system of cytochrome c maturation (23.Thöny-Meyer L. Fabianek R.A. Schulz H. Enggist E. Hennecke H. Biospektrum. 1999; 5: 185-191Google Scholar),Rhizobia seem to possess an additional CcdA-like and therefore quite different system for the maturation of cytochromec. The second complete ORF (positions 1238 to 2197) encoded a protein of 320 amino acids that showed homology to an ORF (31% amino acid identity) from the unfinished Bordetella pertussisgenome project and to the putative malonate transporter MdcF (accession number U95087) of Klebsiella pneumoniae (23% amino acid identity). The third complete ORF (positions 3445 to 2171) is oriented in the opposite direction and its end overlaps with the end of ORF2. The potential gene product of 425 amino acids showed homology to an ORF (34% amino acid identity) from the unfinished Caulobacter crescentus genome project and to the ubiH (accession number AE000374) gene product 2-octaprenyl-6-methoxyphenol hydroxylase of E. coli (31% amino acid identity). The fourth complete ORF (positions 3723 to 4445) is oriented divergently from ORF3 and encoded a very hydrophobic protein of 241 amino acids that showed homology to CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferases (Fig.2) (24.Williams J.G.

The typical motif (DG(X)2AR(X)8G(X)3D(X)3D) described to be specific for CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferases (24.Williams J.G. McMaster C.R. J. Biol.

Secondary structure predictions propose 6, 7, or 8 transmembrane helices for the encoded protein, depending on the program used (data not shown). Therefore this fourth ORF could be the gene (pcs) that codes for the sinorhizobial phosphatidylcholine synthase. In order to perform a functional analysis of the putativepcs gene of S. meliloti, the fourth ORF was amplified by PCR, cloned in a pET9a expression vector to obtain plasmid pTB2559, and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) by induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cell-free extracts were analyzed for Pcs activity (Table II). No Pcs activity can be demonstrated in extracts ofE. coli BL21(DE3) containing the empty pET9a vector. InE. coli BL21(DE3) containing plasmid pTB2559 Pcs activity was detected without induction, and high Pcs activity was found after induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. These results demonstrate that the fourth ORF, suspected to be thepcs gene, indeed codes for a functional phosphatidylcholine synthase (Pcs). In order to precisely define the phenotype of a pcs-deficient S. meliloti, a mutant (KDR568) was constructed by insertion of a spectinomycin resistance-conferring Ω interposon into the pcs gene (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1). No Pcs activity was detected in cell-free extracts of KDR568 whereas a KD"

The polysaccharide was found to be a unique, relatively low molecular weight glycan having a fairly discrete size, with surprisingly little variation in the number of repeating units (degree of polymerization = 5). The polysaccharide isO-acetylated and contains a variety ofO-methylated glycosyl residues, rendering the native glycan somewhat hydrophobic.

Relatively little is known about the molecular events occurring during the later stages of infection, including the subsequent development of the infection threads and bacteroids. Morphological studies have shown that the rhizobial cell surface is in contact with the plant cell surface throughout these stages, suggesting a prominent role for cell surface macromolecules in these events. Rhizobium cells cultured as free-living bacteria express a variety of glycoconjugates on the cell surface, including the lipopolysaccharides (LPS),1capsular polysaccharides (K-antigens), and the extracellular polysaccharides (5.Reuhs B.L.

The majority of these antigenic changes appear to occur in the O-chain portion of the LPS and are associated with the different stages of symbiotic infection (11.Kannenberg E.L. Perotto S.

In addition, recent studies have shown that certain LPS structural changes can be induced by plant flavonoids, indicating that LPS expression can be modulated bynod/nol gene products (19.Reuhs B.L.

These studies have led to the general hypothesis that complete LPS molecules, containing a polymeric O-chain and intact core-lipid A, are required for normal symbiosis to occur (24.Noel K.D.

The lipid A moieties of these rhizobial LPS also differ significantly from the enterobacterial lipid As (33.Bhat U.R. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14402-14410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The R. etli and R. leguminosarum lipid As are devoid of phosphate, have trisaccharide backbones containing uronic acid, glucosamine, and 2-aminogluconic acid, and contain the long chain fatty acid, 27-hydroxyoctacosanoic acid, not found in the enteric lipid As. Like the enterobacterial LPS, the core-lipid A regions of the rhizobial LPS tend to be conserved within eachRhizobium genus, whereas structural diversity is typically found in the O-specific polysaccharide moiety (6.Kannenberg E.L.

CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton1992: 33-44Google Scholar). In the case of R. etli and R. leguminosarum, the structurally variable O-chains are strain-specific and are the dominant antigenic determinants (8.Carrion M. Bhat U.R. Reuhs B. Carlson R.W. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1725-1731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Carlson R.W. Shatters R. Duh J.-L. Turnbull E. Hanley B. Rolfe B.G.

In the majority of cases the structures of these epitopes have not been defined, and it is difficult to draw precise conclusions about their alterations or the significance of these alterations with regard to nodulation. In this report we describe the structure of the O-antigenic polysaccharide portion of the R. etli CE3 LPS. With the structure of this O-chain, the complete glycosyl sequence of the R. etli LPS, including the core region (30.Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2747-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and lipid A (33.Bhat U.R. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14402-14410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is now known. R. etli CE3, the streptomycin-resistant derivative of wild-type strain CFN42, was grown in tryptone/yeast extract supplemented with Ca2+ as described previously (10.Carlson R.W. Kalembasa S. Turowski D. Pachori P. Noel K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4923-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at late log/early stationary phase. Lipopolysaccharides were extracted using the hot phenol/water procedure (10.Carlson R.W. Kalembasa S. Turowski D. Pachori P. Noel K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4923-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in the presence of deoxycholate (34.Krauss J.H. Weckesser J. Mayer H. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1988; 38: 157-163Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 35.Tsai C. Frisch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar). Water layers containing LPS were dialyzed and treated sequentially with ribonuclease, deoxyribonuclease, and proteinase K and then redialyzed and subjected to size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in triethylamine/acetic acid buffer (10.Carlson R.W. Kalembasa S. Turowski D. Pachori P. Noel K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4923-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The O-polysaccharide was isolated from the SEC-purified total LPS (both smooth and rough forms) by mild acid hydrolysis in 1.0% acetic acid at 105 °C for 2 h. The hydrolysates were subjected to freeze/thaw (three repetitions), and the precipitated lipid A was removed by ultracentrifugation at 160,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatants, containing the solubilized O-polysaccharide and the core region oligosaccharides, were passed through a column of polymyxin-agarose to remove remaining traces of free lipid A and intact LPS (30.Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2747-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The flow-through eluants were then chromatographed on Bio-Gel P-2 (45–90-μm fine, 1.5 × 90 cm) equilibrated in 50 mm ammonium formate, pH 6.5, to separate the O-chain from the core oligosaccharides. Carbohydrate compositions of the O-polysaccharide and derived fractions were determined by preparation of the TMS methyl glycosides with GLC-MS (electron impact) analysis (36.York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1060) Google Scholar) using a 30-m DB-5 fused silica capillary column (J & W Scientific). Carbohydrate identities and the location of endogenousO-methyl groups were also determined by analysis of the alditol acetate derivatives, using a 30-m SP-2330 capillary column (Supelco). Alditol acetates were prepared by hydrolysis in 2m trifluoroacetic acid (121 °C, 2 h), followed by reduction (NaBD4) and acetylation (acetic anhydride/trifluoroacetic acid) (37.Stevenson T.T. Furneaux R.H. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 210: 277-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Acidic glycosyl residues were analyzed as the alditol acetates by converting the carboxyl groups to methyl esters (1 m methanolic HCl, 80 °C for 2 h), followed by carboxyl reduction with NaBD4 in water, trifluoroacetic acid hydrolysis, and conversion to the alditol acetates (33.Bhat U.R. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14402-14410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Authentic N-acetylquinovosamine (QuiNAc) was prepared by chemical synthesis by Dr. R. Hollingsworth and provided as a gift. An authentic standard of 6-deoxy-l-talose was obtained from a streptococcal cell wall glycan (38.Pazur J.H. Forsberg L.S. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1980; 8: 107-116Google Scholar). Linkage analysis of neutral sugars was performed by permethylation (Hakomori method), conversion to the partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAAs) (36.York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1060) Google Scholar), and GLC-MS analysis. The Kdo and uronic acid linkages were identified by sequential permethylation, reduction of the carboxymethyl groups with lithium triethylborodeuteride (Aldrich), mild hydrolysis (0.1 m trifluoroacetic acid, 100 °C, 30 min) to cleave ketosidic linkages, reduction (NaBD4), normal hydrolysis (2 m trifluoroacetic acid, 121 °C, 2 h), and conversion to the PMAAs (30.Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2747-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Methylations using trideuteriomethyl iodide were also performed to confirm sugar identities and the locations of endogenous O-Me ether groups. β-Elimination in conjunction with linkage analysis was performed by treating permethylated samples with 2 m dimethyl sulfoxide anion (potassium salt) in Me2SO for 8 h; the elimination products were then ethylated using ethyl iodide, and the products were converted to the corresponding partially methylated, ethylated alditol acetates and analyzed by GLC-MS (33.Bhat U.R. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14402-14410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Where necessary, the identities of TMS methyl glycoside and PMAA derivatives were confirmed by chemical ionization-MS, using a 30-m DB-1 column and ammonia as the reactant gas. De-O-acetylation of the O-specific polysaccharide was performed in 10 mm NaOH at 4 °C for 10 h. The progress of the reaction was followed by 1H NMR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Total β-elimination (depolymerization) was performed on portions of the native or de-O-acetylated polysaccharide using the following procedure. The polysaccharide (23 mg) was reduced with NaBD4 (10 mg/3 ml 0.3 m NH4OH) overnight to stabilize the reducing end Kdo residue. The polysaccharide was then methyl-esterified by treating 3 times with methanol containing 1 to 2 drops of aqueous 1 m HCl and evaporating to dryness. The fully esterified polysaccharide was then treated with aqueous NaOH (0.25 m, 38 °C, 18 h), and the products were chromatographed by (SEC) using Bio-Gel P-10 (1.5 × 92 cm) in water. Further fractionation was performed on Bio-Gel P-4 (<45 mm, 1 × 120 cm) or P-2 (<40 mm, 1 × 120 cm). Column eluants were monitored for neutral carbohydrate using the phenol sulfuric acid assay (36.York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1060) Google Scholar) and for the unsaturated Δ4,5-hexuronosyl residues by measuring absorbance at 232 nm. Appropriate fractions containing oligosaccharides were combined and analyzed by ESI-MS, MALDI-TOF MS, and NMR as described below. The Smith degradation (39.Goldstein I.J. Hay G.W. Lewis B.A. Smith F. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 361-370Google Scholar) was performed by dissolving a sample of the de-O-acetylated O-chain polysaccharide in 50 mmsodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, mixing with an equal volume of 0.2m NaIO4, and maintaining at 4 °C for 72 h in the dark. Excess periodate was destroyed (ethylene glycol), and the sample was reduced with NaBH4 with the solution adjusted to pH 7.5. The resulting oxidized-reduced glycan (“polyol”) was purified by chromatography on Bio-Gel P-10 and lyophilized. The polyol was subjected to mild hydrolysis (0.5m trifluoroacetic acid, 23 °C, 48 h); the acid was removed by evaporation at room temperature, and the products were separated on Bio-Gel P-2. The resulting oligosaccharides were analyzed for structural information. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was performed on a SCIEX API-III triple-quadrupole mass analyzer (PE/SCIEX Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) operated in the positive ion mode with an orifice potential of 35–50 V (15.Olsen P. Wright S. Collins M. Rice W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 654-661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Spectra are the accumulation of 10–60 scans collected over the m/z range 200–2400 with a mass step of 0.2–1.0 atomic mass units at 1 ms/step. All water-soluble samples were desodiated by dialysis, followed by treatment with a strong cation exchange resin (H+ form), and then filtered using 0.45-μm nylon spin filters and stored in polypropylene tubes. Underivatized samples were analyzed at a concentration of 2 μg/μl with a flow rate of 3–5 μl/min using a solution of 15% v/v methanol in deionized water containing 0.5% v/v acetic acid. Permethylated polysaccharide samples were analyzed in 100% methanol containing 1% ammonium formate. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was performed on the SCIEX instrument by selecting a parent ion for collision-induced dissociation using argon as collision gas. The predicted molecular weights of the various de-O-acylated LPS were calculated using the following average incremental mass values, based on the atomic weights of the elements: hexose, 162.1424; hexuronic acid, 176.1259; 4-deoxyhex-4-enopyranosiduronic acid, 158.1106; 3-deoxy-2-octulosonic acid (Kdo), 220.1791; anhydro Kdo, 202.1638; 6-deoxyhexose, 146.1430; mono-O-methyl-6-deoxyhexose, 160.1699; di-O-methyl-6-deoxyhexose 174.1968; tri-O-methyl-6-deoxyhexose, 188.2236; 2-N-acetamido-2,6-dideoxyhexose, 187.1955; free reducing end, 18.0153. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-mass spectrometry was performed on an LDI 1700XP time-of-flight (TOF) spectrometer (Linear Scientific, Reno, NV) in the positive and negative modes, using a matrix of 100 mm 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 90% methanol. The instrument was operated at an accelerating voltage of 30 kV and an extractor voltage of 9 kV. The sample was ionized with a nitrogen laser (λ = 337 nm) with a pulse width of 3 ns and 4–7.5-μJ pulse. The following settings were used: detector sensitivity, 1275 mV full scale; voltage, 4.75 kV. Mass spectra were recorded over a m/z range of 1–50,000; spectra are the summation of 50–250 acquisitions. Polygalacturonic acid or malto-oligosaccharides were used as calibration standards. Oligosaccharides derived from the O-chain by β-elimination were separated by SEC as described above and then fractionated using a Vydac 238TP510 5-μm monomeric C18 semi-preparative reverse phase column (10 × 250 mm) using a linear gradient (0–30%) of methanol in water, containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid with a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Elution was monitored using an evaporative light scattering detector (Richard Scientific), using a 9:1 split in which 90% of the eluant was diverted from the detector and collected into fractions for structural analysis. 1H spectra were recorded with a Varian 300 or 600 spectrometer in D2O at 35 °C using acetone as internal standard, δ 2.22. Two-dimensional NMR spectra (COSY and TOCSY) were performed using the Varian software. The enantiomeric configuration of the glycosyl residues was determined by GLC-MS analysis of the TMS (−)-2-butyl glycosides of the polysaccharide in comparison with the authentic sugars (40.Gerwig G.J. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1979; 77: 1-7Crossref Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The Kdo was assumed to be in thed-configuration. Phenol/water extraction of R. etli strain CE3 typically allows recovery of both the smooth and rough LPSs in the water layer (∼800 mg of LPS/50 g of lyophilized cells), as shown in the deoxycholate-PAGE profile in Fig. 1,inset. MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of these LPSs is also shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the major MALDI component, corresponding to the LPS-I band, has an apparent molecular mass centered at around 6600 atomic mass units, using neutral maltooligosaccharides as the TOF calibrant. The molecular mass of this smooth LPS is consistent with the previously characterized masses for the R. etli lipid A moiety (major species 2L. S. Forsberg, R. W. Carlson, and M. Caroff, unpublished plasma desorption mass spectrometry data. 1987 atomic mass units (33.Bhat U.R. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14402-14410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), and the core region oligosaccharide (major species 3For this calculation the core region is defined as Gal ManGalA3 Kdo3. 1531 atomic mass units) (30.Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2747-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These results suggested an approximate size for the O-chain of around 3100 atomic mass units. The LPS was purified and subjected to mild acid hydrolysis, which selectively cleaves the Kdo ketosidic linkages yielding the O-chain polysaccharide, the core oligosaccharides, and the free lipid A. The released O-chain and core region oligosaccharides each carry a Kdo residue at the reducing end that can undergo a variety of degradative reactions as discussed below. Following hydrolysis and lipid A removal, the soluble products were separated on Bio-Gel P-2, yielding the O-specific polysaccharide fraction (PS) at the void volume, and the lower molecular weight core region oligosaccharide fraction (OS) (data not shown). As shown in Fig.2 A, rechromatography of the PS fraction on Bio-Gel P-10 yielded a single symmetrical peak having aK av = 0.18. MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of this PS revealed three major components, with an approximate molecular mass around 3000 atomic mass units (Fig. 2 B). Inspection of these components showed each to be broad, with small incremental differences of 42 ± 14 mass units, suggesting the presence ofO-acetyl and O-methyl groups (Fig. 2 B, inset). The 1H NMR spectrum of PS confirmed this, showing signals for both O-acetyl and N-acetyl methyl group protons at δ 2.12 and δ 2.03, respectively (Fig.3 A). The ratio ofO-acetyl to N-acetyl protons was approximately 5:1. Other signals in the proton spectrum indicated the presence ofR-CH3 protons, ∼δ 1.2, typical of 6-deoxyhexoses, and intense signals from δ 3.4 to δ 3.5, typical ofO-CH3 protons. The anomeric resonances were broad, presumably a result of the O-acetyl andO-methyl substitution. A set of doublets at δ 2.60 are consistent with H-3 methylene protons of an anhydro Kdofresidue (41.Carlson R.W. Krishnaiah B.S. Carbohydr. Res. 1"
https://openalex.org/W1508602543,"Multiple forms of the transcriptional regulator CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) with molecular masses of approximately 38, 34, 20, and 14 kDa have been observed in cell extracts. It has been proposed that these proteins arise by alternative initiation at in-frame AUG codons. The truncated C/EBPβ isoforms (p14 and p20/LIP) lack transactivation domains but retain DNA-binding and dimerization sequences and are therefore assumed to function as competitive inhibitors of C/EBP-mediated transcriptionin vivo. By comparing various extraction procedures to analyze endogenous and overexpressed C/EBPβ proteins, we determined that p20-C/EBPβ is generated predominantly by in vitroproteolytic cleavage during isolation from cells and that p14-C/EBPβ is produced exclusively by this mechanism. In transfected cells, the full-length (p34 and p38) isoforms but not the truncated proteins were detectable in the cytoplasm, indicating that the latter are not primary translation products. In addition, the C/EBPβ leucine zipper dimerization domain was essential for the appearance of the truncated species, demonstrating that protein folding or dimerization are critical determinants of proteolytic sensitivity.

Biol. 1999; 19: 7181-7190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C/EBPβ and other members of the C/EBP family are also involved in controlling cell growth. For example, forced expression of C/EBPα was found to cause growth arrest of preadipocytes (11Umek R.M. Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 12Freytag S.O. Geddes T.J. Science. 1992; 256: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and other cell types (13Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Darlington G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4726-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of C/EBPβ blocked cell cycle progression of HepG2 hepatoma cells (14Buck M. Turler H. Chojkier M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and suppressed colony formation in keratinocytes (10Zhu S. Oh H.-S. Shim M. Sterneck E. Johnson P.F. Smart R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7181-7190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, members of the C/EBP family are important regulators of cell growth and differentiation.C/EBP proteins are composed of DNA-binding and dimerization domains (the bZIP motif) at their C termini and one or more transactivation domains (TDs) located in their N-terminal regions (1Takiguchi M. Int. J. Exp. Path. 1998; 79: 369-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Interestingly, N-terminally truncated forms of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ have been observed that lack TDs but contain the bZIP domain and thus are able to dimerize and bind DNA. One of these is a 30-kDa isoform of C/EBPα (15Lin F.T. MacDougald O.A. Diehl A.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9606-9610Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 16Ossipow V. Descombes P. Schibler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8219-8223Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), which lacks an N-terminal TD that is present in the 42-kDa full-length protein. Although p30-C/EBPα retains a TD, it is a weaker activator than full-length C/EBPα (16Ossipow V. Descombes P. Schibler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8219-8223Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and cannot induce growth arrest when overexpressed in preadipocytes (15Lin F.T. MacDougald O.A. Diehl A.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9606-9610Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Two truncated C/EBPβ isoforms have also been described. These proteins, approximately 20 and 14 kDa in molecular mass, lack the N-terminal TD that is present in the 34-kDa full-length polypeptide (17Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 18An M.R. Hsieh C.-C. Reisner P.D. Rabek J.P. Scott S.G. Kuninger D.T. Papaconstantinou J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2295-2306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 38-kDa C/EBPβ isoform initiating at an upstream in-frame AUG codon is also expressed from the C/EBPβ transcript, albeit at much lower levels than the 34-kDa protein (17Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). p20-C/EBPβ, also known as liver inhibitory protein (LIP; see Ref. 17Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar), was shown to inhibit C/EBP-dependent transcription of reporter genes. Furthermore, LIP was unable to promote growth arrest when expressed in HepG2 hepatoma cells and blocked growth inhibition caused by overexpression of p34-C/EBPβ (14Buck M. Turler H. Chojkier M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Increased expression of LIP was observed in fetal liver and in mammary tumor cells and was proposed to inhibit the activity of C/EBPβ and other C/EBP proteins, thereby suppressing the transcription of genes associated with terminal differentiation and facilitating cell proliferation (17Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 19Raught B. Gingras A.C. James A. Medina D. Sonenberg N. Rosen J.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4382-4386PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas p20-C/EBPβ/LIP, p14-C/EBPβ, and p30-C/EBPα could theoretically function as antagonists of C/EBP-regulated gene expression and cell growth arrest, the physiological relevance of these truncated C/EBP isoforms has not been definitively established.It has been proposed that the truncated forms of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ are produced by a translational mechanism involving alternative utilization of internal AUG codons (15Lin F.T. MacDougald O.A. Diehl A.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9606-9610Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 16Ossipow V. Descombes P. Schibler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The C/EBPα transcript contains an internal in-frame AUG that would encode a protein of ∼30 kDa, similar in size to the observed protein, whereas C/EBPβ contains methionine codons that could produce polypeptides of ∼20 kDa (LIP) and ∼9 kDa. Both of the transcripts also contain short upstream open reading frames (uORFs) located in the 5′ leader, immediately upstream of the major open reading frames (20Calkhoven C.F., AB, G. Wijnholds J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21Calkhoven C.F. Bouwman P.R. Snippe L. AB G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5540-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 22Lincoln A.J. Monczak Y. Williams S.C. Johnson P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9552-9560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Since uORFs can inhibit translation from downstream AUG codons, it was suggested that the uORF elements are involved in regulating expression of the truncated isoforms (21Calkhoven C.F. Bouwman P.R. Snippe L. AB G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5540-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In support of this notion, the presence of the C/EBPα and C/EBPβ 5′ leader regions was reported to increase expression of the p30-C/EBPα (15Lin F.T. MacDougald O.A. Diehl A.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9606-9610Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 16Ossipow V. Descombes P. Schibler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8219-8223Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and p20-C/EBPβ/LIP (17Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar) polypeptides in transiently transfected cells.In contrast to the above findings, observations from our laboratory have indicated that the p20 and p14-C/EBPβ isoforms can be generated by artifactual proteolysis of full-length C/EBPβ during preparation of nuclear extracts from a macrophage cell line, P388D1(IL1) (23Baer M. Williams S.C. Dillner A. Schwartz R.C. Johnson P.F. Blood. 1998; 92: 4353-4365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, proteolysis appeared to be dependent on the method of nuclear extract preparation. However, the appearance of p20 and p14 using any extraction method could be prevented when the cells were first treated with macrophage cell-conditioned medium. The resistance to proteolysis correlated with diffuse nuclear distribution of C/EBPβ, whereas susceptibility corresponded to a punctate nuclear staining pattern. These and other data suggested that C/EBPβ localization and activity in macrophages are regulated by an autocrine factor and that susceptibility or resistance to proteolysis during nuclear extraction corresponds to the inactive or active state of C/EBPβ in the cell.In experiments to examine the role of uORF elements in regulating C/EBP expression, we found that the 5′ leader regions of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ repressed translation of the full-length proteins but did not promote expression of the truncated species (22Lincoln A.J. Monczak Y. Williams S.C. Johnson P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9552-9560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Analysis of site-directed mutants showed that the repressive effects of the 5′ leader on translation of p42-C/EBPα and p34-C/EBPβ required the uORF element in each transcript. Thus, our findings that the 5′ leader did not promote translation at internal start sites and that p20 and p14 can result from artifactual proteolysis provide an alternative to the view that the truncated C/EBPβ isoforms are produced in vivo by a translational mechanism and function as dominant negative regulators of C/EBP-mediated transcription. In view of the conflicting interpretations about the origin of truncated C/EBPβ isoforms and the widely held assumption that these proteins regulate gene expression in vivo, we have conducted further experiments to examine the possibility that truncated C/EBPβ species are the result of in vitro proteolysis. Our studies demonstrate that proteolytic cleavage during extract preparation is a major source of these isoforms in cell lysates and that the native leucine zipper domain is essential for the susceptibility of C/EBPβ to proteolysis.DISCUSSIONMembers of the C/EBP family of transcription factors play important roles in regulating the growth and differentiation of many cell types. Since the C/EBPα andC/EBPβ genes are assumed to encode both activating (full-length) and inhibitory (truncated) proteins that possess distinct regulatory properties, it is important to establish whether truncated C/EBP species are actually expressed in vivo and how their expression is regulated, or whether these polypeptides represent proteolytic artifacts. In the present study we have investigated the mechanism by which truncated C/EBPβ proteins are produced by examining protein extracts prepared by several methods of extraction from different cells and tissues.The p14 and p20 (LIP) Isoforms of C/EBPβ Are Generated Primarily by in Vitro ProteolysisMultiple lines of evidence support the conclusion that p20-C/EBPβ is produced mainly by a proteolytic mechanism. 1) The p20:p34 ratio varied dramatically depending on the procedure used to prepare cell extracts. If p20-C/EBPβ were a translational product, the relative levels of p20 and p34 should not be influenced by the method of extraction. In support of our results, DeWille and colleagues 2L. Dearth, J. Hutt, A. Sattler, A. Giglioti, and J. DeWille, unpublished results. have observed that the amount of LIP in extracts from mammary tumor tissue is significantly affected by the cell lysis procedure. 2) The presence of p20-C/EBPβ in the nuclear pellet fraction after salt extraction was strongly reduced by increasing the salt concentration, indicating that proteolytic degradation is inhibited by high concentrations of NaCl. 3) p20-C/EBPβ was not detected in cytoplasmic extracts, whereas p38 and p34, which are unambiguous translational products, were present in the cytoplasm of transfected cells. 4) The appearance of p20-C/EBPβ did not require the presence of the 5′ leader region, which has been hypothesized to control internal translation initiation for C/EBPβ. 5) The p20 isoform was detected even in the M131I mutant, whose mRNA cannot encode p20/LIP as a translational product. 6) The production of p20-C/EBPβ was strongly dependent on the presence of the native leucine zipper domain. The truncated protein was not detected in cells expressing chimeric proteins in which the zipper was replaced by the FLAG epitope or by a functional heterologous zipper. It is difficult to imagine a model whereby the leucine zipper coding region affects translational initiation at Met-131, which is located upstream in the mRNA transcript.Another truncated protein that was first reported in liver extracts, p14-C/EBPβ, was proposed to originate from internal translation initiation (18An M.R. Hsieh C.-C. Reisner P.D. Rabek J.P. Scott S.G. Kuninger D.T. Papaconstantinou J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2295-2306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, our studies conclusively demonstrate that this protein is a proteolytic species, since it is approximately 3 kDa larger than the polypeptide expressed from Met-207. Moreover, the p14-C/EBPβ product in liver extracts is indistinguishable from the 14-kDa protein in macrophage nuclear extracts that was shown to be a proteolytic artifact (23Baer M. Williams S.C. Dillner A. Schwartz R.C. Johnson P.F. Blood. 1998; 92: 4353-4365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Thus, p14-C/EBPβ is generated exclusively by proteolysis. Our results indicate that C/EBPβ contains two sites that are exceedingly sensitive to proteolytic cleavage (see Fig.7). A third cleavage site produces p20*, which is slightly larger than p20-C/EBPβ and appears to be a proteolytic product of p38-C/EBPβ. It is possible that differences in the folded structures or protein-protein interactions of p34 and p38-C/EBPβ account for the distinct sites of proteolytic cleavage near Met-131. In this regard, it is notable that the p34 and p38 forms of C/EBPβ were found to interact differentially with NF-κB and a nucleolar phosphoprotein, Nopp140 (32Lee Y.M. Miau L.H. Chang C.J. Lee S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4257-4263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Miau L.H. Chang C.J. Tsai W.H. Lee S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Are Truncated C/EBPβ Isoforms Produced in Vivo?Our studies raise questions about whether p14 and p20-C/EBPβ ever occur in cells or whether these proteins are merely in vitro proteolytic artifacts. A small amount of p20-C/EBPβ can usually be detected in Nonidet P-40 detergent extracts, which could indicate that there is some translational LIP expressed or that p20 is generated by in vivo proteolytic cleavage. Alternatively, it may be difficult to inhibit completely degradation when making nuclear extracts, and the p20-C/EBPβ observed may invariably be due to in vitroproteolysis. This possibility must be considered when interpreting the appearance of truncated C/EBPβ isoforms. The small amount of p11-C/EBPβ observed with the M131I mutant indicates that some internal scanning of ribosomes occurs on the C/EBPβ transcript. However, we have been unable to detect expression of endogenous p11-C/EBPβ, and this protein has only been observed in transfected cells. These results may indicate that internal translation initiation is more prevalent under nonphysiological conditions, i.e.when C/EBPβ is overexpressed in transiently transfected cells.During the course of our studies, Welm et al. (30Welm A.L. Timchenko N.A. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1695-1704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that p14 and p20-C/EBPβ in neonatal mouse liver can be generated by specific proteolytic cleavage, probably by a calpain protease, and that C/EBPα is involved in this process. These authors suggested that C/EBPα may regulate expression of the protease that cleaves C/EBPβ. Furthermore, it was proposed that truncated C/EBPβ proteins are produced in vivo by both translational and proteolytic mechanisms and that, based on comparisons of wild-type and C/EBPα null mice, both mechanisms require C/EBPα (30Welm A.L.

In contrast, our finding that p14 and p20-C/EBPβ can be completely eliminated in adult liver nuclear extracts using specific extraction protocols (Fig. 2) indicates that these proteins result from artifactual proteolytic cleavage. Furthermore, we have examined neonatal liver extracts from wild-type and C/EBPα null mice and did not detect p14 or p20-C/EBPβ in these samples, which were prepared by the Nonidet P-40 lysis method (data not shown).Since we found that the leucine zipper is essential for proteolysis of C/EBPβ, it is tempting to speculate that the requirement for C/EBPα in generating truncated C/EBPβ isoforms in mouse liver involves the formation of heterodimers between C/EBPα and C/EBPβ or that the presence of C/EBPα affects the availability of other C/EBPβ dimerization partners in the cell. Clearly, further studies will be necessary to establish whether truncated C/EBPβ isoforms are actually produced in hepatic cells and play a role in modulating liver gene expression.Requirements for Proteolytic Cleavage of C/EBPβWe have shown that production of p20-C/EBPβ is inhibited in many cell types when nuclear extracts are prepared from cells lysed with Nonidet P-40 detergent. In contrast, p20 is observed when hypotonic lysis is used for preparing nuclear extracts or when whole cell extracts are made using strong detergents. Based on these findings, we suggest that mixing of cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments is an important condition for promoting artifactual cleavage of C/EBPβ. Such mixing would occur upon swelling of the cells in hypotonic buffers and also during preparation of whole cell lysates using strong detergents. It is possible that mixing of compartments renders the nuclear pool of C/EBPβ accessible to cytoplasmic proteases. Alternatively, release of sequestered Ca2+ from cytoplasmic vesicles could activate nuclear Ca2+-dependent proteases, resulting in the cleavage of C/EBPβ. It was surprising that the proteolytic reaction occurred even in SDS lysis buffer. However, certain proteases (e.g. proteinase K) are very stable enzymes and remain active even in the presence of SDS. It is also possible that proteolysis of C/EBPβ occurs very rapidly during cell lysis, after which the protease becomes inactivated.The amount of p20-C/EBPβ was reduced, but not eliminated, in extracts from cells expressing the M131I mutant. In addition, the p20* product was not detected in these extracts. We propose that proteolytic cleavage of C/EBPβ is impaired by this amino acid substitution. Since proteolytic p20-C/EBPβ is indistinguishable from translational LIP, the site of cleavage that generates p20 must be very close to Met-131, and therefore mutation of this residue could easily affect recognition or cleavage by the protease. In previous studies, a reduction in LIP expression that resulted from mutating Met-131 to Ala was interpreted as proof that LIP is a translational product (17Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 28Hsieh C.C. Xiong W. Xie Q. Rabek J.P. Scott S.G. An M.R. Reisner P.D. Kuninger D.T. Papaconstantinou J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1479-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, in light of our results the possibility that this amino acid substitution affected proteolytic cleavage must be given equal consideration.We previously found that C/EBPβ susceptibility to proteolysis in macrophage cells correlated with its localization to punctate nuclear structures (23Baer M. Williams S.C. Dillner A. Schwartz R.C. Johnson P.F. Blood. 1998; 92: 4353-4365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In response to a secreted autocrine factor, C/EBPβ adopted a diffuse nuclear distribution and became resistant to proteolysis. The diffuse state also correlated with increased transcriptional activity of C/EBPβ and the activation of putative target genes such as interleukin-1β and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Thus, resistance to proteolysis may signify activation of C/EBPβ, and it is possible that C/EBPβ must be in a repressed state to be fully susceptible to proteolytic cleavage. In contrast, a recent report suggests that increased C/EBPβ DNA binding activity during the mitotic clonal expansion phase of adipocyte differentiation correlates with a punctate nuclear localization pattern and binding to centromeric DNA repeats (35Tang Q.Q. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2231-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). However, the sensitivity of C/EBPβ to proteolysis was not examined in this study. Papaconstantinou and colleagues (18An M.R. Hsieh C.-C. Reisner P.D. Rabek J.P. Scott S.G. Kuninger D.T. Papaconstantinou J. Mol. Cell.

Although it was concluded that the truncated proteins were generated by alternative translational initiation, the C/EBPβ products observed are very similar to those generated by proteolysis in our experiments. Thus, the acute phase liver model may represent another example in which changes in C/EBP protein activity are associated with altered susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage. Further studies will be necessary to establish the relationship between C/EBPβ activity, subnuclear localization, and sensitivity to proteolysis and whether similar relationships between these properties are observed in macrophages, hepatocytes, and adipocytes.A potential link between proteolytic sensitivity and C/EBPβ function is suggested by the finding that the native leucine zipper domain is required for proteolytic cleavage to occur. The C/EBPβ leucine zipper has two known functional roles. One is to mediate dimerization via the hydrophobic face of the α-helix, thus determining the specificity of dimerization partners (36Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2521) Google Scholar). Another function involves serving as a site for interactions with other proteins, including the p50 subunit of NF-κB (37LeClair K.P. Blanar M.A. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8145-8149Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and the glucocorticoid receptor (38Nishio Y. Isshiki H. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1854-1862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In principle, both of the above functions could influence the proteolytic sensitivity of C/EBPβ, since either heterodimerization or interactions between C/EBPβ dimers and heterologous proteins could alter the folded structure of C/EBPβ. Our data indicate that C/EBPβ must be localized to the nucleus in order to undergo proteolytic cleavage (Fig.4 B). This observation could be explained if protein-protein interactions enhance susceptibility to proteolysis and if these intermolecular associations are restricted to the nuclear compartment. We have also shown that a subpopulation of nuclear C/EBPβ is resistant to high salt extraction and that this fraction is most susceptible to proteolytic cleavage (Fig. 1 B). Future experiments should reveal whether this C/EBPβ population is differentially modified and whether it displays punctate localization. C/EBPβ1 is a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family of transcription factors that has been implicated in both positive and negative regulation of gene expression (1Takiguchi M. Int. J. Exp. Path. 1998; 79: 369-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).

The different factors assemble in a large 20 S complex (18.Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell.

In mouse pre-rRNA, an evolutionary conserved 11-nt motif (+655 to +666) located just 5–6 nt downstream from the cleavage site is absolutely required for the processing (21.Craig N. Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and for formation of the complex observed at the 5′ end of nascent pre-rRNA (20.Mougey E.B., M, O.R.

Biol. 1991; 11: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This RNA sequence can be the targets of several RNA-binding proteins or small nucleolar RNAs for the recognition of the cleavage site.Nucleolin, one of the major nucleolar proteins in exponentially growing cells, is involved in several steps of ribosome biogenesis (24.Ginisty H. Sicard H. Roger B. Bouvet P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 761-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Srivastava M. Pollard H.B. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1911-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Nucleolin binds nascent pre-rRNA close to the transcription initiation site (26.Herrera A.H. Olson M.O. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6258-6264Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 27.Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), suggesting that nucleolin plays a role at an early step of pre-rRNA synthesis. We have previously shown that nucleolin is able to stimulate the primary processing in vitro (17.Ginisty H. Amalric F. Bouvet P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Specific interactions of nucleolin with the pre-RNA substrate and with other cellular components like the U3snoRNP are required for the processing.In this study, we show that an 11-nt evolutionary conserved sequence located just 5–6 nt downstream from the cleavage site is required for the interaction of nucleolin with the pre-rRNA substrate. This interaction is required for the assembly of the processing complex.DISCUSSIONIn these experiments we show that the interaction of nucleolin with an evolutionary conserved RNA sequence (ECM) in the pre-rRNA 5′-ETS is required for processing and formation of a specific complex. Nucleolin is well conserved from human to Xenopus (24.Ginisty H. Sicard H. Roger B. Bouvet P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 761-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Srivastava M. Pollard H.B. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1911-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), and we show that nucleolin from X. laevis and hamster interact with the same pre-rRNA sequence and activate processing activity of a mouse cell extract (Fig. 1). The N-terminal domain of nucleolin that is not required for RNA binding (31.Serin G. Joseph G. Ghisolfi L. Bauzan M. Erard M. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13109-13116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 32.Ghisolfi L. Kharrat A. Joseph G. Amalric F. Erard M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) is needed for complex formation (Fig. 5 A) and processing activation (17.Ginisty H. Amalric F. Bouvet P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The interaction of the N-terminal domain of nucleolin with other factors involved in the processing, like the U3snoRNP (17.Ginisty H. Amalric F. Bouvet P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), seems therefore well conserved between mouse and Xenopus. A SELEX experiment with hamster nucleolin characterized more precisely the RNA sequence required for nucleolin interaction with the pre-rRNA and highlighted the UCGA motif contained in ECM (Fig. 4). The SELEX selected sequences efficiently compete the interaction of nucleolin with the pre-rRNA and the formation of specific complexes. This suggests that nucleolin interacts with the UCGA motif present in the ECM and that this interaction is required for the formation of a processing complex. However, this small motif cannot explain by itself the RNA binding specificity of nucleolin toward the pre-rRNA primary processing binding site. Phylogenetic and mutagenesis studies suggest that this sequence is needed in a single-stranded conformation for processing and specific complex (21.Craig N. Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29.Michot B. Bachellerie J.P. Eur J Biochem. 1991; 195: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). No strong secondary structure could be found in the SELEX sequences, indicating that the UCGA motif is also probably in a single-stranded conformation. Future work should determine the importance of the surrounding sequence for the specific interaction of nucleolin. The ECM is highly conserved, and its deletion or point mutation completely inhibits processing (21.Craig N. Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22.Craig N. Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this sequence is required for the presence of the terminal balls at the 5′ end of nascent pre-rRNA (20.Mougey E.B., M, O.R. Osheim Y. Miller Jr., O.L. Beyer A. Sollner-Webb B. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1609-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Therefore, the interaction of nucleolin with this highly conserved sequence implies that nucleolin plays an important role in the processing and formation of an active processing complex.The minimal pre-rRNA sequence requirement (+645 to +672) for processing and specific complex formation (21.Craig N. Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) includes the ECM. The formation of a ribonucleoprotein complex on this RNA motif was reported to be necessary but not sufficient for processing (21.Craig N. Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The U3snoRNP, which is absolutely required for processing (16.Kass S. Tyc K. Steitz J.A. Sollner-Webb B. Cell. 1990; 60: 897-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) is only present in complex formed on larger RNA (9.Mougey E.B. Pape L.K. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell.

Sequences downstream of the ECM together with the interaction between the U3snoRNP and the N-terminal domain of nucleolin (17.Ginisty H. Amalric F. Bouvet P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) might cooperate for the activation of the processing reaction. The complex formed on the minimal RNA sequence is very stable and cannot be displaced (18.Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4920-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). If nucleolin is added after complex formation on the pre-rRNA substrate, it is not able to stimulate the processing (Fig. 5 B). However, when nucleolin competitors (Fig. 5 A; p50, N25–358) are added at the beginning of the reaction, the formation of the complex is prevented. This suggests that the early interaction of nucleolin with the ECM is required for the formation of an active processing complex.The ECM is required for the formation of the terminal balls at the 5′ ends of nascent pre-rRNA transcript in Xenopus oocyte (20.Mougey E.B., M, O.R. Osheim Y. Miller Jr., O.L. Beyer A. Sollner-Webb B. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1609-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).

Because the formation of these structures is conserved in all tissues and organisms examined, the formation of this complex rather than the primary processing may serve an important function.

The specific interaction of nucleolin with the ECM on nascent pre-rRNA might represent the first step in the assembly of a large ribonucleoparticle involved in this processing. Nucleolin could then recruit, by protein-protein interaction, other factors involved in the cleavage, like the U3snoRNP. Nucleolin interaction with the pre-rRNA could also play a role of a chaperone for the formation of the correct RNA tertiary structure of the nascent transcript. The evolutionary conservation of (i) nucleolin, (ii) the interaction of nucleolin with pre-rRNA sequences involved in the cleavage, and (iii) the formation of a specific complex at the 5′ end of nascent pre-rRNA indicates that this primary processing event plays an important and still unknown function for ribosome biogenesis. Ribosome biogenesis is a complex process that involves the transcription of a large pre-rRNA1 precursor, its maturation, and assembly with ribosomal proteins (1.Eichler D.C. Craig N. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 49: 197-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 2.Hadjiolov A.A. The Nucleolus and Ribosome Biogenesis: Cell Biology Monographs. 12.

Biol. 1990; 39: 241-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) and nucleolytic processing steps to yield the mature 18, 5.8, and 28 S rRNA species. The two first endonucleolytic cleavages occur in external transcribed spacers (ETS) and therefore do not lead to the formation of mature rRNA ends. The first cleavage also called early or primary processing occurs within the 5′-ETS (4.Bach R. Grummt I. Allet B.

Biochem. 1988; 172: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Despite its conservation, the role of this cleavage in ribosome biogenesis is still unknown, and only few factors involved in this process have been characterized. In yeast, the role of Rnt1p, an RNase III homologue remains unclear (12.Elela S.A. Igel H. Ares Jr., M. Cell. 1996; 85: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 13.Kufel J. Dichtl B. Tollervey D. RNA. 1999; 5: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, the major nucleolar protein nucleolin (15.Enright C.A. Maxwell E.S. Eliceiri G.L. Sollner-Webb B. RNA. 1996; 2: 1094-1099PubMed Google Scholar), an endonuclease (14.Shumard C.M. Eichler D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19346-19352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and several small nucleolar RNA are also involved (15.Enright C.A. Maxwell E.S. Eliceiri G.L.

Cell. 1990; 60: 897-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), but their exact function remains to be elucidated. In vitro UV cross-linking has identified a small number of proteins, including nucleolin, that interact with the RNA substrate (17.Ginisty H. Amalric F. Bouvet P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 18.Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4920-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The different factors assemble in a large 20 S complex (18.Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4920-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that could be visualized at the terminal ends of nascent pre-rRNA (terminal balls) observed on Miller's Christmas tree by electron microscopy (19.Miller Jr., O.L. Bakken A.H. Acta Endocrinol. Suppl. 1972; 168: 155-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Mougey E.B., M, O.R. Osheim Y. Miller Jr., O.L. Beyer A. Sollner-Webb B. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1609-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The formation of this complex seems necessary but not sufficient for processing (20.Mougey E.B., M, O.R. Osheim Y. Miller Jr., O.L. Beyer A. Sollner-Webb B. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1609-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 21.Craig N. Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The sequence and RNA structural motif required for the processing have been extensively studied in vitro (21.Craig N. Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22.Craig N. Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In mouse pre-rRNA, an evolutionary conserved 11-nt motif (+655 to +666) located just 5–6 nt downstream from the cleavage site is absolutely required for the processing (21.Craig N. Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and for formation of the complex observed at the 5′ end of nascent pre-rRNA (20.Mougey E.B., M, O.R. Osheim Y. Miller Jr., O.L. Beyer A. Sollner-Webb B. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1609-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A 27-nt RNA (+645 to +672) is processed very inefficiently in vitro, but it seems to contain the minimal cis-acting sequence required for processing (21.Craig N. Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The 200 nt that follow this motif are 80% conserved between mice and humans (5.Miller K.G. Sollner-Webb B. Cell. 1981; 27: 165-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 8.Kass S. Craig N. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2891-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23.Miesfeld R. Arnheim N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 3933-3949Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and stimulate the processing (21.Craig N. Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This RNA sequence can be the targets of several RNA-binding proteins or small nucleolar RNAs for the recognition of the cleavage site. Nucleolin, one of the major nucleolar proteins in exponentially growing cells, is involved in several steps of ribosome biogenesis (24.Ginisty H. Sicard H. Roger B. Bouvet P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 761-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Srivastava M. Pollard H.B. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1911-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Nucleolin binds nascent pre-rRNA close to the transcription initiation site (26.Herrera A.H. Olson M.O. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6258-6264Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 27.Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), suggesting that nucleolin plays a role at an early step of pre-rRNA synthesis. We have previously shown that nucleolin is able to stimulate the primary processing in vitro (17.Ginisty H. Amalric F. Bouvet P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Specific interactions of nucleolin with the pre-RNA substrate and with other cellular components like the U3snoRNP are required for the processing. In this study, we show that an 11-nt evolutionary conserved sequence located just 5–6 nt downstream from the cleavage site is required for the interaction of nucleolin with the pre-rRNA substrate. This interaction is required for the assembly of the processing complex. DISCUSSIONIn these experiments we show that the interaction of nucleolin with an evolutionary conserved RNA sequence (ECM) in the pre-rRNA 5′-ETS is required for processing and formation of a specific complex. Nucleolin is well conserved from human to Xenopus (24.Ginisty H. Sicard H. Roger B. Bouvet P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 761-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Srivastava M. Pollard H.B. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1911-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), and we show that nucleolin from X. laevis and hamster interact with the same pre-rRNA sequence and activate processing activity of a mouse cell extract (Fig. 1). The N-terminal domain of nucleolin that is not required for RNA binding (31.Serin G. Joseph G. Ghisolfi L. Bauzan M. Erard M. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13109-13116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 32.Ghisolfi L. Kharrat A. Joseph G. Amalric F. Erard M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) is needed for complex formation (Fig. 5 A) and processing activation (17.Ginisty H. Amalric F. Bouvet P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The interaction of the N-terminal domain of nucleolin with other factors involved in the processing, like the U3snoRNP (17.Ginisty H. Amalric F. Bouvet P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), seems therefore well conserved between mouse and Xenopus. A SELEX experiment with hamster nucleolin characterized more precisely the RNA sequence required for nucleolin interaction with the pre-rRNA and highlighted the UCGA motif contained in ECM (Fig. 4). The SELEX selected sequences efficiently compete the interaction of nucleolin with the pre-rRNA and the formation of specific complexes. This suggests that nucleolin interacts with the UCGA motif present in the ECM and that this interaction is required for the formation of a processing complex. However, this small motif cannot explain by itself the RNA binding specificity of nucleolin toward the pre-rRNA primary processing binding site. Phylogenetic and mutagenesis studies suggest that this sequence is needed in a single-stranded conformation for processing and specific complex (21.Craig N. Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29.Michot B. Bachellerie J.P. Eur J Biochem. 1991; 195: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). No strong secondary structure could be found in the SELEX sequences, indicating that the UCGA motif is also probably in a single-stranded conformation. Future work should determine the importance of the surrounding sequence for the specific interaction of nucleolin. The ECM is highly conserved, and its deletion or point mutation completely inhibits processing (21.Craig N. Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22.Craig N. Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this sequence is required for the presence of the terminal balls at the 5′ end of nascent pre-rRNA (20.Mougey E.B., M, O.R. Osheim Y. Miller Jr., O.L. Beyer A. Sollner-Webb B. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1609-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Therefore, the interaction of nucleolin with this highly conserved sequence implies that nucleolin plays an important role in the processing and formation of an active processing complex.The minimal pre-rRNA sequence requirement (+645 to +672) for processing and specific complex formation (21.Craig N. Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) includes the ECM. The formation of a ribonucleoprotein complex on this RNA motif was reported to be necessary but not sufficient for processing (21.Craig N. Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The U3snoRNP, which is absolutely required for processing (16.Kass S. Tyc K. Steitz J.A. Sollner-Webb B. Cell. 1990; 60: 897-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) is only present in complex formed on larger RNA (9.Mougey E.B. Pape L.K. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5990-5998Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 16.Kass S. Tyc K. Steitz J.A. Sollner-Webb B. Cell. 1990; 60: 897-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 18.Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4920-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Sequences downstream of the ECM together with the interaction between the U3snoRNP and the N-terminal domain of nucleolin (17.Ginisty H. Amalric F. Bouvet P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) might cooperate for the activation of the processing reaction. The complex formed on the minimal RNA sequence is very stable and cannot be displaced (18.Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4920-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). If nucleolin is added after complex formation on the pre-rRNA substrate, it is not able to stimulate the processing (Fig. 5 B). However, when nucleolin competitors (Fig. 5 A; p50, N25–358) are added at the beginning of the reaction, the formation of the complex is prevented. This suggests that the early interaction of nucleolin with the ECM is required for the formation of an active processing complex.The ECM is required for the formation of the terminal balls at the 5′ ends of nascent pre-rRNA transcript in Xenopus oocyte (20.Mougey E.B., M, O.R. Osheim Y. Miller Jr., O.L. Beyer A. Sollner-Webb B. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1609-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, in Xenopus oocytes, the primary processing is not detected (9.Mougey E.B. Pape L.K. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1991; 11: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22.Craig N. Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this sequence is required for the presence of the terminal balls at the 5′ end of nascent pre-rRNA (20.Mougey E.B., M, O.R. Osheim Y. Miller Jr., O.L. Beyer A. Sollner-Webb B. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1609-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Therefore, the interaction of nucleolin with this highly conserved sequence implies that nucleolin plays an important role in the processing and formation of an active processing complex. The minimal pre-rRNA sequence requirement (+645 to +672) for processing and specific complex formation (21.Craig N. Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) includes the ECM. The formation of a ribonucleoprotein complex on this RNA motif was reported to be necessary but not sufficient for processing (21.Craig N. Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The U3snoRNP, which is absolutely required for processing (16.Kass S. Tyc K. Steitz J.A. Sollner-Webb B. Cell. 1990; 60: 897-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) is only present in complex formed on larger RNA (9.Mougey E.B. Pape L.K. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5990-5998Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 16.Kass S. Tyc K. Steitz J.A. Sollner-Webb B. Cell. 1990; 60: 897-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 18.Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4920-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Sequences downstream of the ECM together with the interaction between the U3snoRNP and the N-terminal domain of nucleolin (17.Ginisty H. Amalric F. Bouvet P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) might cooperate for the activation of the processing reaction. The complex formed on the minimal RNA sequence is very stable and cannot be displaced (18.Kass S. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4920-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). If nucleolin is added after complex formation on the pre-rRNA substrate, it is not able to stimulate the processing (Fig. 5 B). However, when nucleolin competitors (Fig. 5 A; p50, N25–358) are added at the beginning of the reaction, the formation of the complex is prevented. This suggests that the early interaction of nucleolin with the ECM is required for the formation of an active processing complex. The ECM is required for the formation of the terminal balls at the 5′ ends of nascent pre-rRNA transcript in Xenopus oocyte (20.Mougey E.B., M, O.R. Osheim Y. Miller Jr., O.L. Beyer A. Sollner-Webb B. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1609-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, in Xenopus oocytes, the primary processing is not detected (9.Mougey E.B. Pape L.K. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5990-5998Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20.Mougey E.B., M, O.R. Osheim Y. Miller Jr., O.L. Beyer A. Sollner-Webb B.

Because the formation of these structures is conserved in all tissues and organisms examined, the formation of this complex rather than the primary processing may serve an important function. Our results indicate that nucleolin does not activate the processing when a stable complex is preformed on the pre-rRNA substrate, indicating that the ordered formation of a stable complex that could include nucleolin is necessary for the formation of an active complex. The regulation of nucleolin, like the phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain of nucleolin during the cell cycle (34.Caizergues-Ferrer M. Belenguer P. Lapeyre B. Amalric F. Wallace M.O. Olson M.O.

Cell. 1990; 60: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), could modulate the formation of this complex and therefore of the processing. The N- and C-terminal domains of nucleolin are involved in protein-protein interactions (17.Ginisty H. Amalric F. Bouvet P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 38.Bouvet P. Diaz J.J. Kindbeiter K. Madjar J.J. Amalric F. J. Biol.

Bouvet P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 27.Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Mol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19025-19029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The function of nucleolin in this processing is likely the result of these different properties. The specific interaction of nucleolin with the ECM on nascent pre-rRNA might represent the first step in the assembly of a large ribonucleoparticle involved in this processing. Nucleolin could then recruit, by protein-protein interaction, other factors involved in the cleavage, like the U3snoRNP. Nucleolin interaction with the pre-rRNA could also play a role of a chaperone for the formation of the correct RNA tertiary structure of the nascent transcript. The evolutionary conservation of (i) nucleolin, (ii) the interaction of nucleolin with pre-rRNA sequences involved in the cleavage, and (iii) the formation of a specific complex at the 5′ end of nascent pre-rRNA indicates that this primary processing event plays an important and still unknown function for ribosome biogenesis."

In a previous study, the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) was identified as a transcriptional activator of the mouse amelogenin gene in a cell type-specific manner. Here, Msx2 is shown to repress the promoter activity of amelogenin-promoter reporter constructs independent of its intrinsic DNA binding activity. In transient cotransfection assays, Msx2 and C/EBPα antagonize each other in regulating the expression of the mouse amelogenin gene. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays demonstrate that Msx2 interferes with the binding of C/EBPα to its cognate site in the mouse amelogenin minimal promoter, although Msx2 itself does not bind to the same promoter fragment. Protein-protein interaction between Msx2 and C/EBPα is identified with co-immunoprecipitation analyses. Functional antagonism between Msx2 and C/EBPα is also observed on the stably transfected 2.2-kilobase mouse amelogenin promoter in ameloblast-like LS8 cells. Furthermore, the carboxyl-terminal residues 183–267 of Msx2 are required for protein-protein interaction, whereas the amino-terminal residues 2–97 of Msx2 play a less critical role. Among three family members tested (C/EBPα, -β, and -γ), Msx2 preferentially interacts with C/EBPα. Taken together, these data indicate that protein-protein interaction rather than competition for overlapping binding sites results in the functional antagonism between Msx2 and C/EBPα in regulating the mouse amelogenin gene expression.

A 2263-nucleotide proximal promoter element from the mouse X-chromosomal amelogenin gene has been demonstrated by transgenic mouse analysis to recapitulate the spatiotemporal expression pattern of the endogenous amelogenin gene (10Snead M.L.

Extensive homologies (70% identity) in the 300-nucleotide region upstream of the transcription initiation site exist between the murine, bovine, and human X-chromosomal amelogenin gene, suggesting that this region is likely involved in the transcriptional regulation of tissue-specific amelogenin gene expression. In a previous study, the minimal promoter of the mouse amelogenin gene (−70/+52) was identified, which contains a CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)1 consensus binding site, and C/EBPα activated amelogenin transcription in a cell-type specific manner through binding to its cognate site (14Zhou Y.L.

The C/EBPs consist of a family of related basic region leucine zipper transcription factors that are critical regulators of cellular differentiation and function in multiple tissues. Six different members of the family (C/EBPα, -β, -γ, -δ, -ε, and -ζ) have been isolated and characterized. The expression of C/EBPs is tissue- and stage-specific during development.

Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) is the mammalian counterpart of theDrosophila msh (muscle segmenthomeobox) gene. Three unlinked members, Msx1 (21Hill R.E. Jones P.F. Rees A.R. Sime C.M. Justice M.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Graham E. Davidson D.R.

Development. 1991; 112: 1053-1061PubMed Google Scholar), and Msx3 (24Holland P.W. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 98: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), have homeobox sequences very similar to each other and to the Drosophila msh gene. The murine Msx3 is expressed only in the dorsal neural tube (25D'Alessio M. Frasch M. Mech. Dev. 1996; 58: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 26Shimeld S.M. McKay I.J. Sharpe P.T.

Dev. 1996; 58: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which appears to exclude the possibility of functional redundancy of Msx3 on the role of Msx1 and Msx2 in tooth development. During odontogenesis, Msx1 is expressed at all stages in dental mesenchymal cells but not in epithelial cells (28Mackenzie A. Leeming G.L. Jowett A.K. Ferguson M.W. Sharpe P.T. Development. 1991; 111: 269-285PubMed Google Scholar,29MacKenzie A. Ferguson M.W. Sharpe P.T. Development. 1991; 113: 601-611PubMed Google Scholar). The expression pattern of Msx2 changes with the differentiation of different germ layers. Msx2 is strongly expressed in undifferentiated inner enamel epithelia in which amelogenin expression is barely detectable; but Msx2 is absent in differentiated ameloblasts in which robust expression of amelogenin is detected. On the other hand, Msx2 is weakly expressed/absent in undifferentiated dental papilla mesenchyme, whereas it is strongly expressed in odontoblasts and differentiated dental papilla cells (30MacKenzie A. Ferguson M.W. Sharpe P.T. Development. 1992; 115: 403-420PubMed Google Scholar). Msx2 has been shown to function as a transcriptional repressor independent of its intrinsic DNA binding activity through the homeodomain. Instead, the repression is mediated by protein-protein interaction with either components of basal transcription machinery or other transcription factors (31Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Battaile J.T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10451-10462Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 32Newberry E.P. Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol.

To investigate the role of Msx2 in the regulation of amelogenin gene expression, various amelogenin-promoter reporter constructs were transiently transfected into ameloblast-like LS8 cells with a Msx2 expression plasmid. The functional relationship between Msx2 and C/EBPα, a transcriptional activator of amelogenin, was examined with cotransfection assays. The potential of Msx2 to interfere with the binding of C/EBPα to its cognate site on the amelogenin minimal promoter as well as the ability of Msx2 itself to bind to the promoter was assessed with electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSA). Whether Msx2 is able to interact with C/EBPα in LS8 cells was further determined with co-immunoprecipitation analyses. The functional antagonism between Msx2 and C/EBPα was tested on a stably transfected amelogenin-promoter reporter construct. Finally, the ability of Msx2 to interact with two other C/EBP family members, C/EBPβ and C/EBPγ, was examined with cotransfection assays. A mouse ameloblast cell line (LS8) established by immortalizing primary cultures of enamel organ epithelium with SV40 large T antigen was maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (Sigma) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (36Dhamija S. Liu Y. Yamada Y. Snead M.L. Krebsbach P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20738-20743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The mouse amelogenin-promoter reporter constructs were described in a previous study (14Zhou Y.L. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12273-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids of Msx2FL, MsxΔN, and Msx2ΔC (31Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Battaile J.T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10451-10462Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) were generously provided by Dr. Dwight Towler (Washington University). Transient transfection and luciferase assays were performed as described previously (14Zhou Y.L. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12273-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Stable cell line LS8/p2207 was established by transfecting LS8 cells with amelogenin-promoter reporter construct p2207. After selection with hygromycin (750 ng/ml), the resistant colonies were isolated, expanded, and screened with luciferase assays for reporter gene activity. Seven clones with luciferase activity 1,000–10,000-fold of that in parental LS8 cells were selected for further studies. One of the selected clones with the highest basal luciferase activity was designated LS8/p2207 and maintained in the presence of hygromycin (750 ng/ml). The plasmid pCMV-lacZ (0.2 μg) was cotransfected into LS8/p2207 cells with an empty vector pcDNA3 (4 μg), a Msx2 expression plasmid pcMsxFL (2 μg) plus pcDNA3 (2 μg), a C/EBPα expression plasmid pcC/EBPα (2 μg) plus pcDNA3 (2 μg), and pcMsx2FL (2 μg) plus pcC/EBPα (2 μg) in 60-mm plates. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), resuspended in 50 μl of staining medium (phosphate-buffered saline, 4% fetal bovine serum, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and warmed at 37 °C for 5 min. An equal volume (50 μl) of prewarmed (37 °C) 2 mmdi-β-d-galactopyranoside (Molecular Probes) was added, mixed, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 min. The mixture was then placed on ice, and 1 ml of ice-cold isotonic Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added. The β-galactosidase positive cells were sorted by flow cytometry (Moflo, Cytomation, Inc.). An expression plasmid pQE-Msx2 was used to produce recombinant 6xHis-Msx2 protein. Bacterial culture, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, cell lysis, and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (QIAGEN) loading were performed according to the manual (77Qiagen Inc. The QIAexpressionist. Valencia, CA1997: 38-73Google Scholar). The recombinant 6xHis-Msx2 protein was eluted with 20 ml of buffer D (8 murea, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 5.9) followed by 20 ml of buffer E (8 m urea, 0.1m sodium phosphate, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 4.5). Fractions (3 ml) from each elution were collected and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fractions containing 6xHis-Msx2 protein were pooled and dialyzed sequentially against 8, 6, 4, 2, and 1m urea and distilled H2O at 4 °C for 3 h each. After lyophilization, the sample was stored at 4 °C. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were generated by annealing antisense strand to a 10-fold excess of sense strand and filling in with [α-32P]dATP (NEN Life Science Products) and Klenow (exo−). The GelShift buffer kit (Stratagene) was used for the binding reaction, which was performed as recommended by the manufacturer. The reaction mixtures were resolved in a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel provided in the kit. The gel was dried, and the bands were visualized by autoradiography. The sequences of the oligonucleotides were:amel antisense strand 5′-GAACAGCCAATCAGGTTTCTGAATGAA-3′,amel sense strand 5′-TTTTTCATTCAGAAACCTGA TTGGCTGTTC-3′ (nucleotide 1510–1539, GenBankTM accession numberAF083091); msx2 antisense strand 5′-ACTTTGAACAGCCAATTAGT TTCTGAATGAA-3′, msx2 sense strand 5′-TTCATTCAGAAACTAATTGGCTGTTCA-3′. Nuclear extracts were prepared from LS8 cells transfected with a C/EBPα expression plasmid, as described previously (14Zhou Y.L. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12273-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). LS8 cells, 80–90% confluent in a 100-mm cell culture plate, were collected in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μl/ml aprotinin (Sigma), and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and lysed by passing through a 22-gauge needle six times at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin standards. A primary antibody (2 μg) was added to 1 ml of cell lysate (500 μg of total cellular protein) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Twenty-five microliters of protein G PLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added and incubated for 6 h at 4 °C with rotation. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Pellets were washed three times with 1.0 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer and once with 1.0 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) at 4 °C. After final wash, pellets were resuspended in an equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer, boiled for 3 min, and stored at −80 °C. Samples (10 μl) were analyzed by Western blot as described previously (14Zhou Y.L. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12273-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thein vitro transcription-coupled translation reactions were performed using a TnT T7-coupled wheat germ extract system, according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Promega). Briefly, 25 μl of TnT wheat germ extract, 2 μl of TnT reaction buffer, 1 μl of TnT RNA polymerase, 0.5 μl of amino acid mixture (minus leucine, 1 mm), 0.5 μl of amino acid mixture (minus methionine, 1 mm), 1 μl of RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor (40u/μl), 2 μl of template DNA (0.5 mg/ml), and 18 μl of nuclease-free H2O were added into a 0.6-ml centrifuge tube. The translation mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 90 min and then stored at −80 °C. The [35S]methionine was included in the reactions in a parallel experiment to determine the translation efficiency of individual protein. To determine whether Msx2 could regulate the promoter activity of the mouse amelogenin gene, a Msx2 expression plasmid was cotransfected into ameloblast-like LS8 cells with a series of 5′-deletion amelogenin-promoter reporter constructs. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the −70/+51 region of the mouse amelogenin promoter functions as a minimal promoter in LS8 cells (14Zhou Y.L. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12273-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Exogenous Msx2 was able to down-regulate the promoter activity of each reporter construct so long as that construct contained the mouse amelogenin minimal promoter (p2207, p454, p349, p194, and p70 all contained the region −70/+51), whereas no inhibitory effect was observed on either the reporter construct p51 or the promoter-less construct pGL3-Basic (Fig. 1 A). The reporter construct p51 by itself exhibited very little promoter activity in LS8 cells (Fig. 1 A (14Zhou Y.L. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12273-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)). The effect of Msx2 on the full-length promoter (p2207) and the minimal promoter (p70) was further tested in LS8 cells with transient cotransfection assays. Transfection of different amounts of a Msx2 expression plasmid resulted in a roughly linear increase in the expression level of the exogenous Msx2 protein (Fig. 1 B, middle panel, Msx2FL). Compared with that of the exogenous Msx2 protein (Msx2FL), the expression level of endogenous Msx2 protein (Msx2) in LS8 cells was very low (Fig. 1 B, lower panel). In response to an increasing amount of exogenous Msx2 protein, the reporter gene activity was decreased up to 15-fold for p2207 and up to 7-fold for p70 (Fig.1 B), respectively. Furthermore, overexpression of Msx2 in LS8 cells had no effect on both the simian virus 40 (SV40) and the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene (CMV) promoter (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicated that Msx2 repressed the mouse amelogenin promoter in a dose-dependent manner in ameloblast-like LS8 cells. C/EBPα has been demonstrated to function as a transcriptional activator of the mouse amelogenin gene through its cognate binding site in the −70/−52 region of the mouse amelogenin promoter (14Zhou Y.L. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12273-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To investigate the functional relationship between C/EBPα and Msx2 in regulating the mouse amelogenin promoter activity, C/EBPα and Msx2 expression plasmids were cotransfected into LS8 cells with either amelogenin-promoter reporter construct p2207 or p70. Three different Msx2 expression plasmids were used in the study to generate amino-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged Msx2 proteins. Msx2FL was a full-length protein, including murine Msx2 residues 2–267. Msx2ΔN was an amino-terminal deletion containing residues 98–267, whereas Msx2ΔC was a carboxyl-terminal deletion containing residues 2–183. Increasing amounts of Msx2FL were able to attenuate the C/EBPα-mediated transactivation of amelogenin-promoter reporter construct p2207 (Fig. 2 A,lanes 1–5) or p70 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–5), whereas Msx2FL by itself was a potent transcriptional repressor. On the other hand, C/EBPα was capable of overcoming the repressive effect of Msx2FL on the reporter construct p2207 (Fig.3 A, lanes 1–5) or p70 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–5) in a dose-dependent manner. As a first step to identify the functional domain within Msx2, two deleted forms of Msx2 were tested. A less potent repression by Msx2ΔN and little repression by Msx2ΔC on the basal promoter activity of p2207 (Fig. 2 A, lanes 10 and 15) or p70 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 10 and 15) were observed. Msx2ΔC had little effect on the C/EBPα-mediated transactivation of the mouse amelogenin-promoter reporter construct p2207 (Fig. 2 A, lanes 11–14) and p70 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 11–14), respectively. The antagonistic capacity of Msx2ΔN fell in between Msx2FL and Msx2ΔC on both reporter construct p2207 (Fig. 2 A,lanes 6–9) and p70 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6–9). Similar amounts of C/EBPα transactivated p2207 (Fig.3 A, lanes 6–10 and 11–15) or p70 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 6–10 and 11–15) to a greater extent in the presence of Msx2ΔN or Msx2ΔC than in the presence of Msx2FL. These transfection analyses indicated that there was a functional antagonism between Msx2 and C/EBPα in the transcriptional regulation of the mouse amelogenin gene. Furthermore, these data suggested that there was a difference in the activities of the two Msx2 deletion mutants.Figure 3Functional antagonism of Msx2-mediated repression of the mouse amelogenin promoter by C/EBP α. In the presence of 250 ng of p2207 (A) or p70 (B) reporter construct, 500 ng of empty vector (pcDNA3), 250 ng of Msx2FL expression plasmid (pcMsx2FL) with 250 ng of pcDNA3, 250 ng of pcMsx2FL with 125 ng of pcDNA3 plus 125 ng of C/EBPα expression plasmid (pcC/EBPα), 250 ng of pcMsx2FL with 250 ng of pcC/EBPα, and 250 ng of pcC/EBPα with 250 ng of pcDNA3 were cotransfected into LS8 cells, respectively. Similar parameters for transfection experiments were used for Msx2ΔN and Msx2ΔC, respectively. pCMV-lacZ was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The relative luciferase activity is the normalization of luciferase activity with β-galactosidase activity. The mean ± S.D. from at least three independent experiments is represented, and the basal level of p2207 (A) and p70 (B) was set as 1, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As a first step to understand the mechanism underlying the functional antagonism between Msx2 and C/EBPα, the effect of Msx2 on the binding of C/EBPα to the mouse amelogenin promoter was assessed with an EMSA. Various forms of Msx2 protein were generated using an in vitrotranscription-coupled translation system (TnT-coupled wheat germ extract system, Promega). A functional C/EBP cognate site has been identified in the −70/−52 region of the mouse amelogenin promoter (14Zhou Y.L. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12273-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the C/EBP cognate site (Fig.4 C, amel probe) was able to form a C/EBPα-containing protein-DNA complex using nuclear extracts prepared from LS8 cells overexpressing C/EBPα protein (Fig.4 A, lane 12). Only modest changes in the intensity of the C/EBPα-probe complex were observed when different amounts of either sham-treated TnT extracts (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2 and 3) or TnT-expressed luciferase protein (Fig. 4 A, lanes 10 and 11) were included in the EMSA reactions. On the contrary, TnT-expressed Msx2FL diminished the intensity of the EMSA complex to 20% (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4 and5). Reduction in the intensity of the EMSA complex was also observed for the two deleted forms of Msx2, down to 25% for Msx2ΔN (Fig. 4 A, lanes 6 and 7) and 37% for Msx2ΔC (Fig. 4 A, lanes 8 and 9). Furthermore, increasing amounts of purified full-length Msx2 protein was capable of reducing the intensity of the C/EBPα-probe complex to 27% (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4–8), whereas the highest concentration of bovine serum albumin had little effect (Fig.4 B, lane 9). Neither purified Msx2 protein nor bovine serum albumin alone bound to the probe (Fig. 4 B,lanes 2 and 3). To ascertain that both TnT-expressed and -purified Msx2 proteins were capable of binding to DNA, a 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a Msx2 cognate site (Fig.4 C, msx2 probe) was used in gel shift analyses. The TnT-expressed full-length (Msx2FL) and amino-terminal deleted (Msx2ΔN) Msx2 protein efficiently bound to the msx2 probe (Fig. 4 C, lanes 7, 8, and 12), whereas the TnT-expressed carboxyl-terminal deleted Msx2 protein (Msx2ΔC) and luciferase protein failed to form an EMSA complex, respectively (Fig.4 C, lanes 9 and 10). An EMSA complex with the msx2 probe was also observed for the purified Msx2 protein (Fig. 4 C, lane 12). Neither of the various Msx2 proteins nor the luciferase control protein could bind to the amel probe that contained a C/EBP binding site instead of a Msx2 cognate site (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2–5 and11). The EMSA analyses indicated that Msx2 protein was able to interfere with the binding of C/EBPα to the mouse amelogenin promoter in a dose-dependent manner. Given the fact that Msx2 protein itself did not bind to the mouse amelogenin promoter, the observed interference appeared to result from protein-protein interaction instead of competition for binding to overlapping cognate sites on the promoter. Deletion of either amino- or carboxyl-terminal domain of Msx2 only had a modest effect on the ability of Msx2 to interfere with the binding of C/EBPα to the amelogenin promoter in the EMSA analyses (Fig. 4 A). However, the same deletions resulted in a dramatic decrease in the antagonistic potency of Msx2 on C/EBPα in the transfection studies (Fig. 2). To investigate whether Msx2 could interact with C/EBPα, a co-immunoprecipitation analysis was performed in LS8 cells. A C/EBPα expression plasmid was cotransfected into LS8 cells with an empty vector, Msx2FL, Msx2ΔN, and Msx2ΔC expression plasmid, respectively. Comparable amounts of C/EBPα protein were expressed in all four transfected cell populations (Fig. 5, lanes 1–4, panels III and IV). The C/EBPα protein was co-immunoprecipitated efficiently with Msx2FL (Fig. 5,lane 2, panel I) but to a lesser extent with Msx2ΔN (Fig. 5, lane 3, panel I). However, C/EBPα protein was barely detected in the Msx2ΔC-containing immunocomplex (Fig. 5, lane 4, panel I). A similar amount of FLAG-tagged Msx2 protein was present in each immunoprecipitated complex (Fig. 5, lanes 2–4, panel II), whereas no protein was detected in empty vector-transfected cells (Fig. 5, lane 1, panel II) using the same monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2Ab) as that in the immunoprecipitation process. The reciprocal experiment was also performed, in which immunoprecipitation with a C/EBPα-specific antibody was followed by Western blot analysis using the anti-FLAG M2Ab (data not shown). The Msx2FL protein was readily detected in the C/EBPα-containing immunocomplex and so was Msx2ΔN to a less extent. However, the migration rate of the C/EBPα-specific antibody light chain was very close to that of Msx2ΔC in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, thereby compromising the detection of Msx2ΔC band in Western blot analyses. These data indicated that Msx2 interacted with C/EBPα at the protein level in LS8 cells. Moreover, the carboxyl-terminal domain (residues 183–267) of Msx2 was required, whereas the amino-terminal domain (residues 2–97) of Msx2 contributed somehow to the interaction between Msx2 and C/EBPα protein.

This study demonstrates that in different cell types, the level of LIFRα decreases during treatment with LIF or the closely related cytokine oncostatin M (OSM). Moreover, insulin and epidermal growth factor induce a similar LIFRα down-regulation. The regulated loss of LIFRα is specific since neither gp130 nor OSM receptor β shows a comparable change in turnover. LIFRα down-regulation correlates with reduced cell responsiveness to LIF. Using protein kinase inhibitors and point mutations in LIFRα, we demonstrate that LIFRα down-regulation depends on activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of LIFRα at serine 185. This modification appears to promote the endosomal/lysosomal pathway of the LIFRα. These results suggest that extracellular signal-regulated kinase-activating factors like OSM and growth factors have the potential to lower specifically LIF responsiveness in vivo by regulating LIFRα half-life.

LIF is a pleiotropic cytokine that, among other functions, induces differentiation of mouse monocytic leukemia M1 cells, conversion of sympathetic neurons from the adrenergic to cholinergic phenotype, suppresses the differentiation of embryonic stem cells, enhances proliferation of myoblasts, and facilitates endometrial implantation of embryos (reviewed in Refs. 1Gadient R.A. Patterson P.H. Stem Cells. 1999; 17: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholarand 2Taupin J.L. Pitard V. Dechanet J. Miossec V. Gualde N. Moreau J.F. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 397-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). LIF also plays a role in the systemic inflammatory response, activating the hypothalamic-adrenal axis, and inducing the acute phase reaction of the liver (3Gabay C. Kushner I. New Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 448-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5108) Google Scholar). In hepatocytes, LIF, similar to other IL-6 cytokines, stimulates the enhanced expression of a set of plasma proteins, termed acute phase proteins (APP) (4Baumann H. Gauldie J. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 74-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The precise pattern of APP expression is determined by the action of IL-6 cytokines in combination with various other inflammatory mediators, endocrine hormones, and growth factors (5Clowes, GHA (ed) (1988) Trauma, Sepsis and Shock: The Physiologic Basis of Therapy, pp. 1-53, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). For instance, during the acute phase reaction, insulin is increased 3-fold (6Frayn K.N. Br. J. Exp. Pathol. 1976; 57: 316-320PubMed Google Scholar) and then modulates the cytokine regulation of APP genes (7Campos S.P. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1789-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 8Campos S.P. Wang Y. Baumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24418-24424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In myoblasts, IGF-1 also reduces LIF action, apparently by down-regulating LIF receptor number (9Bower J. Vakakis N. Nicola N.A. Austin L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). LIFRα is a 190-kDa transmembrane protein with low affinity for LIF. In combination with gp130 subunit, it forms the high affinity LIF receptor complex (10Gearing D.P. Thut C.J. VandenBos T. Gimpel S.D. Delaney P.B. King J. Price V. Cosman D. Beckmann M.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 11Gearing D.P. Comeau M.R. Friend D.J. Gimpel S.D. Thut C.J. McGourty J. Brasher K.K. King J.A. Gillis S. Mosley B. Ziegler S.F. Cosman D. Science. 1992; 255: 1434-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). As described in the human system, OSM also uses LIFRα and gp130 subunits to form a high affinity OSM receptor complex (then termed OSMR complex type I). CNTF, CT-1, and neurotrophin-1 also utilize LIFRα and gp130 subunits (reviewed in Refs. 12Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar and 13Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). In addition to the shared LIFRα/gp130 complex used by either LIF or OSM, a specific OSM receptor complex (type II) has been identified that is composed of gp130 and OSMRβ (14Mosley B. de Imus C. Friend D. Boiani N. Thoma B. Park L.S. Cosman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32635-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In rodents, OSM seems to act exclusively through the type II receptor complex of gp130/OSMRβ (15Lindberg R.A. Juan T.S. Welcher A.A. Sun Y. Cupples R. Guthrie B. Fletcher F.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3357-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 16Tanaka M. Hara T. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Miyajima A. Blood. 1999; 93: 804-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LIF binding to LIFRα induces heterodimerization with gp130. Janus protein-tyrosine kinases (JAK), constitutively associated with the cytoplasmic domain of these receptors, are then activated by trans- and autophosphorylation, and in turn phosphorylate tyrosine residues in both LIFRα and gp130 intracellular domains. Those phosphorylated tyrosines, within the Box3 sequence context YXXQ, create docking sites primarily for STAT3 but also STAT1. Other sites are recognized by linker proteins which, upon phosphorylation, propagate the signal to other pathways (MAPK, PI3K) (reviewed in Refs. 12Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 13Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar, and 17Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3383) Google Scholar). The Src homology 2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 functions as such a linker toward Grb2 and MAPK. SHP2 also acts, through its catalytic activity, as a negative regulator of the JAK/STAT signaling by down-regulating JAK activity, and consequently lowering the induction of STAT3-dependent genes (18Kim H. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5326-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 19Kim H. Hawley T.S. Hawley R.G. Baumann H. Mol. Cell.

Hirano T. Immunity. 2000; 12: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Other inhibitors of LIF activity are members of the SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling) family, especially SOCS3, and the phosphatase SHP1, which, in pituitary cells, is found constitutively associated with JAK. SHP1 decreases JAK and STAT3 phosphorylation, and SOCS3 has been shown to deactivate JAK within 1 h of LIF treatment (21Bousquet C. Susini C. Melmed S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Ligand-induced LIFRα/gp130 heterodimerization increases serine phosphorylation of the LIFRα cytoplasmic domain. ERK1 and ERK2 are implicated in phosphorylating Ser1044 (or Ser185 of the cytoplasmic domain) of LIFRα (22Schiemann W.P. Graves L.M. Baumann H. Morella K.K. Gearing D.P. Nielsen M.D. Krebs E.G. Nathanson N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5361-5365Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of ERK by insulin also increases LIFRα Ser185 phosphorylation. It has been suggested that this modification may contribute to the modulation by insulin of cell responsiveness to LIF (22Schiemann W.P. Graves L.M. Baumann H. Morella K.K. Gearing D.P. Nielsen M.D. Krebs E.G. Nathanson N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5361-5365Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of this LIFRα regulation is unknown. A similar serine phosphorylation of gp130 or OSMRβ by MAPK has not yet been demonstrated, and in contrast to LIFRα, both gp130 and OSMRβ do not contain an overt substrate site for MAPK kinases. Constitutive, ligand-independent endocytosis of gp130 and LIFRα has been observed that depends in part on dileucine motifs within the cytoplasmic domain of these receptors (23Thiel S. Behrmann I.

Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5487-5494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In the case of gp130, an interaction with the adaptor protein AP2 has been described, which presumably results in a transfer of the receptor into clathrin-coated pits, followed by efficient endocytosis, trafficking from endosomes to lysosomes, and finally lysosomal degradation (24Thiel S. Dahmen H. Martens A. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 18: 231-234Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Dittrich E. Haft C.R. Muys L. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5487-5494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Most of the current evidence indicates that gp130 half-life is not appreciably modified by ligand binding (i.e. IL-6 binding), suggesting that gp130 signal transduction does not modify internalization/degradation of this receptor subunit. In this study we show that, in various cell types, LIFRα is specifically down-regulated by treatments with LIF and other effectors that activate ERK 1/2. We suggest that Ser185phosphorylation of LIFRα promotes lysosomal degradation of this receptor subunit. In contrast, co-activated gp130 or OSMRβ proved to be significantly more stable under the same conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that, in hepatic cells, specific LIFRα down-regulation correlates with a lower LIF induction of signaling and gene expression. Rat H-35 (clone T-7–18; Ref. 26Baumann H.

The LIFRα-Myc or G-CSFR-LIFRα-Myc constructs were transferred as EcoRI-NotI fragments into the retroviral vector MINV. The vector-derived viruses were used to transduce H-35 cells, which were selected in medium containing 2 mg/ml G418 (18Kim H. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5326-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 27Wang, Y., Robledo, O., Kinzie, E., Blanchard, F., Richards, C., Miyajima, A., and Baumann, H. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, in pressGoogle Scholar). Clonal lines were identified for comparable levels of LIFRα-Myc expression by Myc immunoblotting and low endogenous LIFRα expression (LIFRα immunoblotting). LIFRα with deleted extracellular domain (ΔN-LIFRα, residues 821–1097) was generated by replacing the extracellular G-CSFR, in chimeric G-CSFR-LIFRα, by gp130-leader peptide (generated by polymerase chain reaction). Leu-Ile to Ala-Ala (L210A/I211A) LIFRα has been generated by polymerase chain reaction with the same oligonucleotides described by Thiel et al.(23Thiel S. Behrmann I. Timmermann A. Dahmen H. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Tavernier J. Pitard V. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. Biochemistry. 1999; 339: 15-19Crossref Google Scholar), using the plasmid pDC302-LIFRα as a template. All the LIFRα constructs have also been modified by the addition of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the C terminus in EGFP.N1 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). HepG2 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (28O'Mahoney J.V. Adams T.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1227-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) with a total of 20 μg/ml DNA. Expression of LIFRα-GFP was visualized under a Nikon inverted fluorescence microscope, and digitized images (magnification, ×40) were taken by a SPOT camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). Cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 μl/cm2 monolayers). Lysates, containing 1 mg of protein, were diluted to 1 ml with RIPA buffer and incubated with specific antibodies to LIFRα or gp130 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were recovered by incubation with 50 μl (50% slurry in RIPA buffer) of protein G-conjugated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 18 h at 4 °C with agitation. Beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer and boiled in SDS sample loading buffer. The immunoprecipitates or aliquots of whole cell lysates were separated on 6–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and proteins transferred to protean membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were reacted with primary specific antibodies to LIFRα, gp130, STAT3, ERK 1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PY-STAT3, P-ERK (New England Biolabs, Inc.), Myc (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), FLAG (Eastman Kodak Co.), phosphotyrosine (PY20, Transduction Laboratories, combined with 4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and secondary antibodies (horseradish peroxide-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Aurora, OH)) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, 5% milk, or 3% albumin. Results were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (ECL) according to the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To perform additional immunoreactions, membranes were treated for 30 min with 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol. Chinese hamster ovary cells-derived LIF was iodinated at a specific radioactivity of around 15,000 μCi/nmol according to the chloramine T method as described (29Godard A. Heymann D. Raher S. Anegon I. Peyrat M.A. Le Mauff B. Mouray E. Gregoire M. Virdee K. Soulillou J.P. Moreau J.F. Jacques Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3214-3222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For binding studies, H-35 monolayers were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline, containing 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA. 0.5 × 106 cells in suspension were incubated for 90 min with an increasing concentration of labeled LIF in phosphate-buffered saline, containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 5 mm Man-6-P, to avoid binding to the Man-6-P/IGFII-R (30Blanchard F.

Cell bound and unbound fractions were separated by centrifugation through a layer of dibutylphthalate (90%) and paraffin oil (10%). Regression analysis of the binding data was accomplished using a one or two-site equilibrium binding equation (Grafit; Erithacus Software, Staines, United Kingdom). Parental or hLIFRα-expressing H-35 cells in serum-free medium were treated 4 h with LIF or insulin. Supernatants were collected, dialyzed against 25 mm NH4HCO3, lyophilized, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. The amount of shed human LIFRα was measured by a specific ELISA as reported previously (43Pitard V. Lorgeot V. Taupin J.L. Aubard Y. Praloran V. Moreau J.F. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1998; 9: 599-605PubMed Google Scholar). Synthesis and secretion of APP into the culture medium of cytokine-treated H-35 cells were quantified by immunoelectrophoresis (32Baumann H. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 163: 566-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The area under the precipitation peaks (proportional to the amount of antigen) was integrated and expressed in arbitrary units. In hepatic cells, the LIF-induced signal transduction, as determined by STAT activation and induction of APP genes, is transient, implying the presence of intracellular negative regulatory mechanisms. In pituitary cells, protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2, and SOCS3, are proposed to down-regulate LIF signaling within 30 min to 1 h by inactivation of JAK2 and/or STAT3 (18Kim H. Baumann H.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In myoblasts, it is also suggested that a separate mechanism operates via down-regulation of the LIFRα protein (9Bower J. Vakakis N. Nicola N.A. Austin L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To test the latter possibility, we measured the level of immunodetectable LIFRα after LIF treatment in the rat hepatoma cell line H-35. LIFRα proteins appeared as doublets with 190 and 170 kDa (Fig.1 A). Treatment with monensin, which prevents the transfer of glycoproteins from the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane (34Siewert E. Muller-Esterl W. Starr R. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), caused an accumulation of the lower form of the LIFRα, suggesting a precursor-product relationship between the two forms (Fig.1 D). Presumably, the larger protein represents fully processed receptor protein as detectable at the plasma membrane that also undergoes ligand-induced phosphorylation (see Fig. 3 B). The smaller size protein likely represents immature, intracellular LIFRα, analogous to the findings with gp130 (34Siewert E. Muller-Esterl W. Starr R. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A (left panel) (see also Fig.5 C), the large size LIFRα form displays a transient size increase after 5–15 min of LIF treatment, attributed to increased receptor protein phosphorylation (see below). This is followed by a decrease of immunodetectable protein that reaches a 30–40% level by 2 h (Fig. 1 C). The reduced level of LIFRα protein was maintained for more than 7 days (data not shown) and was not restricted to H-35 cells but also observed in mouse Hepa1 cells, rat HTC cells, human HepG2 cells (all hepatoma cells, data not shown), NIH3T3 fibroblasts, HeLa epithelial cells (see Fig. 8), primary lung fibroblasts, and different breast carcinoma cells (data not shown).Figure 3Insulin down-regulates prominently LIF activity.

B, parental H-35 cells (LIF and IL-6 treatments) or mOSMRβ-H-35 cells (mOSM treatments) were pretreated with insulin for the indicated time and then treated 10 min with the indicated cytokine.

Since antibodies against the C-terminal part of LIFRα were used, the degradation products presumably represent LIFRα with truncated extracellular domains. This possibility was assayed first by ectopic expression of full-length LIFRα in a HepG2 cell clone (clone 86.6, Ref. 41Knowles B.B. Howe C.C. Aden D.P. Science. 1980; 209: 497-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar) with an endogenous LIF production. Degradation products were clearly detectable, together with full-length and precursor forms of LIFRα (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). Moreover, the identity of the short forms was verified by transfection of an expression vector for LIFRα retaining only 12 amino acids of the extracellular domain (ΔN-LIFRα, residues 821–1097). This truncated LIFRα co-migrated with LIFRα degradation products (Fig.1 B, lane 3). These first experiments indicated that LIFRα level is regulated in part through LIF binding (autologous regulation). To test the possibility of a regulation of LIFRα level in trans (heterologous regulation), we treated H-35 cells with OSM, IL-6, and insulin. As shown in Fig. 1 C, H-35 cells, which do not express endogenous OSMRβ subunit and thus are devoid of an OSMR complex type II (27Wang, Y., Robledo, O., Kinzie, E., Blanchard, F., Richards, C., Miyajima, A., and Baumann, H. (2000) J. Biol.

To prove that signaling by OSMR complex type II has also the ability to act intrans, we used the recently isolated H-35 cell line stably expressing the transduced murine OSMRβ (27Wang, Y., Robledo, O., Kinzie, E., Blanchard, F., Richards, C., Miyajima, A., and Baumann, H. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, in pressGoogle Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1(A and C), mOSM that unlike hOSM does not function through LIFRα (15Lindberg R.A. Juan T.S. Welcher A.A. Sun Y. Cupples R. Guthrie B. Fletcher F.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3357-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 16Tanaka M. Hara T. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Miyajima A. Blood. 1999; 93: 804-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), induced a down-regulation of LIFRα in mOSMRβ H-35 cells (30% level) but not in parental H-35 cells. Furthermore, treatment of H-35 cells with insulin similarly reduced the level of LIFRα (30% level; Fig. 1, A and C), indicating that LIFRα can also be down-regulated intrans. Interestingly, insulin in parental H-35 cells or mOSM in mOSMRβ H-35 cells induced the mobility shift of the functional LIFRα (at early time points of treatment). Moreover, both factors induced the appearance of degradation products (after 1 h of treatment), similar to that observed with LIF treatment (Figs. 1 A and5 C). The finding of factor-induced reduction of LIFRα suggested that all these factors might affect the tu"

In contrast, Hes1, which is specifically expressed by neural precursor cells, not only inhibits the DNA binding activity of the Mash1-E47 heterodimer but also repressesMash1 expression (14.Sasai Y.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3136-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Thus,Hes1 regulates neural development by preventing premature neuronal differentiation or maintaining neural precursor cells, and the balance between the positive and negative bHLH factors is important for the correct timing of neuronal differentiation (1.Kageyama R. Nakanishi S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 22.Kageyama R. Ishibashi M. Takebayashi K. Tomita K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1389-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Another bHLH factor, Hes5, is also expressed by neural precursor cells and prevents premature neuronal differentiation (23.Akazawa C. Sasai Y. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21879-21885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Takebayashi K. Akazawa C. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Hes1-Hes5double-deficient embryos, even more neurons differentiate prematurely than in Hes1- or Hes5-deficient embryos, indicating that Hes1 and Hes5 cooperatively regulate the maintenance of neural precursor cells (25.Ohtsuka T. Ishibashi M. Gradwohl G. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, still many neural precursor cells are present in the brain ofHes1-Hes5 double-deficient embryos, suggesting that there may be an additional gene that is involved in maintenance of neural precursor cells. Hes3, another member of the Hes family, is initially identified as a cerebellar Purkinje cell-specific transcription factor (14.Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Purkinje cells, the only output neurons in the cerebellar cortex, originate from the ventricular zone of the neural tube, migrate radially into the cerebellar cortex, and form a monolayer called the Purkinje cell layer (26.Ito M. The Cerebellum and Neural Control. Raven Press, New York1984Google Scholar). This layer is formed within several days after birth and then Purkinje cells start extension and arborization of their dendrites. Hes3 expression starts in these differentiating Purkinje cells soon after birth and continues until adulthood (14.Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Thus, it is suggested that Hes3 may be involved in maturation and maintenance of Purkinje cells in contrast to Hes1, which inhibits neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, Hes3 lacks the amino-terminal half of the basic region and is therefore suggested to be unable to bind to the DNA unlike Hes1, which binds to the N box (CACNAG), further supporting the idea that Hes1 and Hes3 have distinct functions. However, recent studies revealed that Hes3 is also expressed by neural precursor cells in the ventricular zone of the developing nervous system like Hes1 (27.Lobe C.G. Mech. Dev. 1997; 62: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28.Allen T. Lobe C.G. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1999; 45: 687-708PubMed Google Scholar). Hes3 is initially expressed in the midbrain-hindbrain boundary and rhombomeres 2, 4, 6, and 7 at the early stage of neural development and subsequently in the ventricular zone of the most of the nervous system (27.Lobe C.G. Mech. Dev. 1997; 62: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28.Allen T. Lobe C.G. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1999; 45: 687-708PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, from the expression patterns it is speculated that Hes3 could have a similar function to Hes1 in embryos. To characterize the Hes3 functions in neural development, we cloned Hes3 cDNAs from mouse embryos and postnatal cerebellum and compared their structures and activities. Here, we found that embryonal Hes3, designated Hes3b, is encoded by a different first exon and has a complete basic region unlike cerebellar Hes3, now designated Hes3a. Furthermore, embryonal Hes3 represses transcription by directly binding to the N box and inhibits neuronal differentiation like Hes1. In contrast, cerebellar Hes3 does not have such functions. Therefore, alternative promoters and first exons that are differentially utilized during neural development generate structurally and functionally distinct proteins from a singleHes3 gene locus. The cDNA libraries were constructed, as described previously (14.Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized by oligo(dT) priming of poly(A)+ RNA of mouse whole embryos of day 9.5 and cerebellum (three weeks old). Double-stranded cDNAs were then constructed, ligated to the EcoRI adapter (Stratagene), and cloned into the EcoRI site of the λZAP II vector (Stratagene). The rat Hes3 cDNA was used as a probe (14.Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Eight and five positive clones were obtained by screening 8 × 105 plaques of cDNA library of the mouse cerebellum and 1 × 106 plaques of cDNA library of the mouse embryo, respectively. Oligonucleotide primers 5′-CTGATAAAGATGCTGAGGCAAGGATGCTGG-3′ (primer 5) and 5′-GTTGATGCGTGCACGGCGCTTCTTC-3′ (primer 6) labeled at the 5′-end were hybridized to the mouse cerebellum poly(A)+ RNA (20 μg) and mouse embryonal poly(A)+ RNA (20 μg) at 50 °C, as described previously (29.Takebayashi K. Sasai Y. Sakai Y. Watanabe T. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5150-5156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RT-PCR was carried out, as described previously (30.Tsuda H. Takebayashi K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6327-6333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA prepared from mouse cerebellum, and embryos were subjected to reverse transcription using oligo(dT) as a primer. Primers used for PCR were as follows: primer 1 (25-mer), 5′-TCGCTCAACAGTCTAGTCGTGCGGG-3′; primer 2 (25-mer), 5′-GTCCTTAGAAGGAGGAGGAGGCCTGTTG-3′; primer 3 (25-mer), 5′-GCAATGCAGCCCACTGCCTGTGTGA-3′; and primer 4 (30-mer), 5′-ACATCACAGCATGGGCACCGAGCCCACATC-3′. After 25 cycles of the reaction (94 °C 30 s, 58 °C 30 s, 72 °C 1 min), the products were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gel. Primers 2 and 6 generated a 418-base pair (bp) band, whereas primers 4 and 6 generated a 115-bp band. The proteins were prepared as follows. The cDNA fragments of Hes3a (from the amino acid residue 2 to the carboxyl-terminal end), Hes3b (residue 2 to the end), Hes1 (residue 3 to the end), Mash1 (residue 77 to the end), and E47 (residue 473 to the end) were subcloned into pMNT T7 expression plasmid. JM109(DE3) cells transformed by expression plasmids were grown and treated with 1.6 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. The cells were collected and suspended in 0.02 volume of 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 20% sucrose. The proteins were purified from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel, incubated in 6 m guanidine-HCl for 20 min, and dialyzed against 0.1 m KCl/HM (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 17% glycerol) at 4 °C for 12 h. The probe DNAs were prepared as follows. For the N box and E box probes, the oligonucleotide (the top strand) containing either a putative N box (5′-CAGGCACCACGAGCTGG-3′) or a putative E box (5′-CAGGCAGCAGGTGTTGG-3′) was labeled at the 5′-end and annealed with five molar excess of the bottom strand (N box: 5′-CCAGCTCGTGGTGCCTG-3′; E box: 5′-CCAACACCTGCTGCCTG-3′), respectively. The probe DNAs were purified with MicroSpin G-25 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mutated N box probe (top strand, 5′-CAGGCACCCCTAGCTGG-3′; bottom strand, 5′-CCAGCTAGGGGTGCCTG-3′) and E box probe (top strand, 5′-CAGGCAGTGGGCATTGG-3′; bottom strand, CCAATGCCC ACTGCCTG-3′) were used for DNA competitors. The electrophoresis mobility shift analysis (EMSA) with the N box or the E box probe was carried out as described previously (14.Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). For the luciferase reporter plasmid, the double-stranded oligonucleotide fragment containing either six repeats of the N boxes (three repeats of CCACGAGCCACAAGG) or seven repeats of the E boxes (AGGCAGGTGGC) was cloned into the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid under the control of the β-actin promoter. For eukaryotic expression plasmids, full-length cDNA fragments of Hes1, Hes3a, and Hes3b were subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector containing the cytomegalovirus promoter, pCI Vector (Promega). Expression plasmids for Mash1 and E47 were described previously (14.Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The luciferase reporter (0.1 μg) and the eukaryotic expression plasmids (0.3–0.5 μg each) were transfected with the FuGENE6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) into C3H10T1/2 cells, which were plated in 6-multiwell plates at the density of 1 × 105 cells/well. The plasmid containingRenilla luciferase gene under the control of the SV40 promoter (2 ng) was also transfected as an internal standard to normalize the transfection efficiency. After 48 h, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured. The CLIG retrovirus vector contains the cytomegalovirus enhancer in the 5′-long terminal repeat, internal ribosomal entry site of the encephalomyocarditis, enhanced GFP gene (CLONTECH), and 3′-long terminal repeat (31.Hojo, M., Ohtsuka, T., Hashimoto, N., Gradwohl, G., Guillemot, F., and Kageyama, R. (2000) Development, in pressGoogle Scholar). For retrovirus expression plasmids, full-coding cDNA fragments of Hes1, Hes3a, and Hes3b were subcloned into the upstream of the internal ribosomal entry site of CLIG. Retrovirus was produced by transfecting the retroviral DNA constructs into the packaging cell line ψ2mp34 (30.Tsuda H. Takebayashi K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6327-6333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Retrovirus solution was passed through a 0.45-μm filter and concentrated, as described previously (30.Tsuda H. Takebayashi K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6327-6333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The primary culture of neural precursor cells was performed as described previously (16.Ishibashi M. Moriyoshi K. Sasai Y. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1799-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The uterus containing mouse whole embryos of day 11.5 was excised and incubated in minimal essential medium-α for 45 min. Then the embryos were isolated, and their heads were excised. With fine forceps, the epidermis, mesenchyme, and meninges were removed. The neuroepithelium of the forebrain was transferred into fresh phosphate-buffered saline and partially dissociated by pipetting. The cells were resuspended in the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 2% fetal bovine serum, 25 μg/ml of transferrin, 15 μg/ml of insulin, 20 nm progesterone, 30 nm sodium selenite, 1.7 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, 3.3 ng/ml of epidermal growth factor, 10 ng/ml nerve growth factor, and 10 ng/ml of cholera toxin. This cell suspension was plated onto a tissue culture dish, and on the next day nonadhesive cells were collected and replated onto polyethylenimine and fibronectin-coated chamber slides (Lab-Tek) at the density of 3 × 104. After the cells were attached to the slides, virus solution with 8 μg/ml of polybrene was added to the culture. 3 h later, the solution was aspirated, and fresh medium was added. After 2 weeks of culture, the cells were fixed and examined by immunohistochemistry as follows. Fixed samples were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and blocked with 5% normal goat serum. Primary antibodies used were as follows: rabbit anti-GFP antibody (1:500; Medical & Biological Laboratories), mouse anti-MAP2 antibody (1:500; Sigma), and mouse anti-nestin antibody (1:500; PharMingen). The reaction was visualized by biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Vector Laboratories), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated avidinD (1:1000; Vector Laboratories), and Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:400; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To determine the structure of embryonal and postnatal cerebellar Hes3, we screened mouse cDNA libraries made from mouse whole embryos of day 9.5 and postnatal cerebellum. This screening yielded five embryonal (out of 1 × 106 independent plaques) and eight cerebellar cDNA clones (out of 8 × 105). Sequencing analysis revealed that all the cDNA clones isolated from the cerebellar cDNA library (Hes3a) had essentially the same structure as the previously published rat Hes3 (14.Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Hes3a had the first methionine codon in the middle of the basic region, thus lacking its amino-terminal half (Fig.1 C). This methionine codon was located in exon 2, and therefore the first exon only had a noncoding sequence (Fig. 1 B) (32.Sakagami T. Sakurada K. Sakai Y. Watanabe T. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast, the embryonal type cDNA clones (Hes3b) had a different structure in the 5′ region, suggesting that the 5′ region is derived from a different exon. The other regions corresponding to the second, third, and fourth (last) exons were identical between the two types of Hes3 cDNAs. Sequence comparison between the 5′ region of Hes3b and the Hes3 gene (32.Sakagami T. Sakurada K. Sakai Y. Watanabe T. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a new first exon, designated exon 1b, was located in the first intron (Fig. 1, A and B). The previously identified first exon of Hes3a is now designated exon 1a. Interestingly, Hes3b transcript had the first methionine codon at a further upstream position in exon 1b and encoded a complete basic region (Fig. 1, B and C). Hes3a and Hes3b consisted of 175 and 200 amino acid residues, respectively. In the basic region of Hes3b, there was a proline residue that is conserved by all Hes factors except for Hes3a (Fig. 1 C), and the bHLH domain of Hes3b had 60% identity to that of mouse Hes1. Both Hes3a and Hes3b contained the carboxyl-terminal Trp-Arg-Pro-Trp sequence (the WRPW domain), which recruits the corepressor Groucho (33.Paroush Z. Finley Jr., R.L. Kidd T. Wainwright S.M. Ingham P.W. Brent R. Ish-Horowicz D. Cell. 1994; 79: 805-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 34.Fisher A.L. Ohsako S. Caudy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2670-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 35.Grbavec D. Stifani S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To determine the transcription initiation sites of Hes3 gene, primer extension analysis was performed. The labeled antisense primer corresponding to the region from nucleotide residues 211 to 240 in exon 1a (primer 5, Fig. 2 A) was hybridized to embryonal and postnatal cerebellar RNA and subjected to reverse transcription. This experiment generated one specific band with the size of 240 nucleotides when the primer was hybridized to cerebellar RNA (Fig. 2 B, lane 3) but not when the same primer was hybridized to embryonal RNA (lane 4). This confirmed that exon 1a is transcribed only in postnatal cerebellum and that transcription initiates at the nucleotide position 1 (Fig.1 B). When the antisense primer corresponding to the region from 831 to 855 in the second exon (primer 6, Fig. 2 A) was hybridized to postnatal cerebellar RNA, a 418-nucleotide band was detected (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). This product was likely to be derived from the transcript of exon 1a. In contrast, when the same primer (primer 6) was hybridized to embryonal RNA, a band with the size of 115 nucleotides was detected (lane 2). This product was likely to be derived from the transcript of exon 1b, and the size of the band suggested that the transcription initiation site of exon 1b was located at 621 (Fig. 1 B). To confirm the positions of the two transcriptional initiation sites, we next carried out RT-PCR experiments with different sets of primers (the positions of the primers are shown in Fig. 2 A). Whereas primers 1 (corresponding to the region from −25 to −1) and 6 yielded no band (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1 and 5), primers 2 (1–25) and 6 yielded a 418-bp band only when postnatal cerebellar RNA was used as a template (lane 2), agreeing with the above result that transcription starts at 1 in postnatal cerebellum. In contrast, whereas primers 3 (596–620) and 6 yielded no band (lanes 3 and 7), primers 4 (621–650) and 6 yielded a 115-bp band only when embryonal RNA was used as a template (lane 8), agreeing with the result that transcription starts at 621 in embryos. These data indicated that exon 1a is transcribed only in postnatal cerebellum, whereas exon 1b is only in embryos. In the upstream region of each transcription initiation site, there is a TATA-like sequence, TATATA (35 nucleotides upstream of exon 1a) and TATAAA (27 nucleotides upstream of exon 1b) (Fig. 1 B,underlined). Hes3a has a helix-loop-helix domain but lacks the amino-terminal half of the basic region, whereas Hes3b has a complete bHLH domain, raising the possibility that these two proteins have distinct DNA binding properties. To determine the DNA binding activity, each protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and applied to the EMSA. Whereas Hes3a did not bind to the N box (Fig.3 A, lane 2), Hes3b bound to the N box very efficiently (lane 5). These results suggested that the complete basic region is essential for DNA binding. The binding intensity of Hes3b was comparable with that of Hes1 (lane 8), which binds to the N box with a high affinity (14.Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The binding was abrogated when the excess amount of the N box-specific competitor was mixed (lanes 6 and 9) but not when a mutated competitor was mixed (lanes 7 and10), indicating that the N box binding was specific. These results demonstrated that Hes3b is functionally different from Hes3a but more similar to Hes1. Because Hes1 is known to inhibit the Mash1-E47 heterodimer from binding to the E box (14.Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), we next examined whether Hes3a and Hes3b have the similar activity. Mash1 and E47 bound to the E box with a high affinity (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). This binding was abrogated by the E box-specific (lane 4) but not by a mutated competitor (lane 5). Coexpression of Hes3a or Hes3b with the Mash1-E47 complex completely inhibited the E box binding, like Hes1 (lanes 6–8), indicating that both Hes3a and Hes3b had a similar inhibitory activity on Mash1 and E47. Thus, the basic region is not required for the inhibition of the DNA binding of Mash1 and E47. To determine the transcriptional activity, we next performed a transient transfection assay with the luciferase reporter genes. The reporter gene under the control of the N box-containing promoter was coexpressed with Hes3a or Hes3b. We previously showed that Hes1 represses transcription by binding to the N box (14.Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A, row 4). Similarly, Hes3b efficiently repressed transcription (row 3), whereas Hes3a did not (row 2), agreeing well with the EMSA data that Hes3b and Hes1 bound to the N box with a high affinity, whereas Hes3a did not. These results again indicated that Hes3b is functionally different from Hes3a but more similar to Hes1. When the reporter gene under the control of the E box-containing promoter was used, coexpression of Mash1 and E47 significantly induced the expression (Fig. 4 B, row 4), as described previously (5.Johnson J.E. Birren S.J. Saito T. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3596-3600Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Both Hes3a and Hes3b efficiently inhibited Mash1 and E47-dependent transcription like Hes1 (rows 5–7). These data agreed with the above EMSA results, which showed that Hes3a and Hes3b inhibited the DNA binding of Mash1 and E47. The DNA binding and transcriptional analyses indicated that Hes3a and Hes3b have different activities. To define their functions in neural development, each factor was misexpressed with retrovirus in neural precursor cells. For misexpression, we used the replication-incompetent retrovirus CLIG (31.Hojo, M., Ohtsuka, T., Hashimoto, N., Gradwohl, G., Guillemot, F., and Kageyama, R. (2000) Development, in pressGoogle Scholar), which directs expression of a test gene and GFP as a marker (Fig. 5 A). Neural precursor cells were prepared from mouse embryos at day 11.5, and virus was applied on the next day. After 2 weeks, by which time many cells differentiated into neurons, the fate of the virus-infected cells was determined by monitoring GFP+ cells. When the control CLIG virus was infected, approximately 40% of the virus-infected cells differentiated into neurons, which extended multiple neurites and expressed the neuron-specific microtubule associated protein MAP2 (Figs. 5, B–D, and6 A). Approximately 20% of the CLIG-infected cells remained as neural precursor cells, which expressed the progenitor-specific intermediate filament nestin (Figs. 5, E–G, and6 B). When CLIG-Hes1 was infected, about 90% of the virus-infected cells remained as nestin-positive precursor cells (Figs.5, W–Y, and 6 B). These virus-infected cells were clearly demarcated from the surrounding MAP2-positive neurons (Fig. 5,T–V), and only 4% of them differentiated as neurons (Fig.6 A), agreeing with the previous results that Hes1 inhibits neuronal differentiation (16.Ishibashi M. Moriyoshi K. Sasai Y. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1799-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 17.Tomita K. Ishibashi M. Nakahara K. Ang S.-L. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Similarly, when CLIG-Hes3b was infected, about 85% of the virus-infected cells remained as nestin-positive precursor cells (Figs. 5, Q–S, and6 B), and they were segregated from MAP2-positive neurons (Fig. 5, N–P). Only 5% of the virus-infected cells differentiated into MAP2-positive neurons (Fig. 6 A). These results indicated that Hes3b inhibited neuronal differentiation and maintained neural precursor cells like Hes1. In contrast, when CLIG-Hes3a was infected, about 35% of the virus-infected cells differentiated into MAP2-positive neurons (Figs. 5, H–J, and 6 A), and only 30% of the cells remained as nestin-positive neural precursor cells (Figs. 5, K–M, and6 B). These ratios were very similar to those of the control CLIG virus infection, suggesting that Hes3a has no inhibitory or promoting activity to neuronal differentiation. These results demonstrated that Hes3a and Hes3b have different functions in neural development.Figure 6The cell fate of virus-infected cells.Neural precursor cells were infected with retrovirus, and after 2 weeks of culture, the cell types of virus-infected cells were immunocytochemically determined. Ratios of MAP2+ to GFP+ cells (A) and nestin+ to GFP+ cells (B) were determined by seven independent experiments and are shown with a standard deviation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Hes3 is expressed by neural precursor cells in the embryonal nervous system and by differentiating and mature Purkinje cells in the postnatal cerebellum. From these expression patterns, it has been suggested that Hes3 has different functions in embryos and postnatal cerebellum, but the molecular nature for the possible functional difference was not known. We here showed that embryonal and cerebellar Hes3 transcripts are structurally different and generated from alternative first exons. The cerebellar type Hes3a transcript has the first methionine codon in the middle of the basic region, and therefore Hes3a lacks the amino-terminal half of the basic region. In contrast, the embryonal type Hes3b transcript has the first methionine codon at the further upstream position, and thus Hes3b has a complete basic region. Interestingly, these two types of Hes3 proteins are different in function as well. Hes3a does not bind to the DNA, whereas Hes3b binds to the N box and represses transcription from the N box-containing promoter like Hes1 and Hes5. Furthermore, Hes3b inhibits neuronal differentiation and maintains neural precursor cells, whereas Hes3a does not. Thus, Hes3b is functionally different from Hes3a but very similar to Hes1 and Hes5, which are expressed by neural precursor cells and play an important role in maintenance of neural precursor cells. In Hes1-Hes5 mutant brains, neural precursor cells are not properly maintained and differentiate prematurely (17.Tomita K. Ishibashi M. Nakahara K. Ang S.-L. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 18.Ishibashi M. Ang S.-L. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Guillemot F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3136-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 25.Ohtsuka T. Ishibashi M. Gradwohl G. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, these embryos exhibit severe defects of brain and eye morphogenesis (17.Tomita K. Ishibashi M. Nakahara K. Ang S.-L. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 18.Ishibashi M. Ang S.-L. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Guillemot F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3136-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these mutant embryos still have many neural precursor cells, suggesting that an additional factor may be involved in maintenance of neural precursor cells. Our present study suggests that Hes3b may be responsible for this activity. The functional difference in regulation of neuronal differentiation between Hes3a and Hes3b is likely to reside in the basic region. Whereas Hes3b represses transcription by directly binding to the N box like Hes1 and Hes5, Hes3a cannot because of its incomplete basic region. It seems that transcriptional repression by directly binding to the promoter, which is exhibited by Hes1, Hes5, and Hes3b but not by Hes3a, is important to block neuronal differentiation. For this transcriptional repression, the carboxyl-terminal WRPW domain is essential (33.Paroush Z. Finley Jr., R.L. Kidd T. Wainwright S.M. Ingham P.W. Brent R. Ish-Horowicz D. Cell. 1994; 79: 805-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 34.Fisher A.L. Ohsako S. Caudy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2670-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 35.Grbavec D. Stifani S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This domain interacts with the corepressor Groucho, which recruits a histone deacetylase protein and actively represses transcription (36.Chen G. Fernandez J. Mische S. Courey A.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2218-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The target genes of Hes3b are not known, but Hes1 is known to repress Mash1 expression by directly binding to its promoter (15.Chen H. Thiagalingam A. Chopra H. Borges M.W. Feder J.N. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Ball D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5355-5360Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In the absence of Hes1, Mash1expression is up-regulated, and neurons differentiate prematurely (17.Tomita K. Ishibashi M. Nakahara K. Ang S.-L. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar,18.Ishibashi M. Ang S.-L. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Guillemot F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3136-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), suggesting that transcriptional repression of neuronal genes such as Mash1 may be important to block neuronal differentiation. Because Hes3b and Hes1 have very similar functions and expression patterns, it is possible that Hes3b may also repressMash1 expression by directly binding to its promoter. Another possible target gene is Krox20, a zinc finger gene expressed in rhombomeres 3 and 5 (37.Wilkinson D. Bhatt S. Chavrier P. Bravo R. Charnay P. Nature. 1989; 337: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Because Hes3b is expressed in rhombomeres 2, 4, 6, and 7, where Krox20 is not expressed, it is possible that Hes3b may be involved in repression ofKrox20 expression in such rhombomeres. Although Hes3a can inhibit Mash1-dependent transcription in a dominant-negative manner, it does not inhibit neuronal differentiation. The apparent requirement for the DNA binding activity to inhibit neuronal differentiation is intriguing because theDrosophila counterparts, E(spl) proteins, can suppress neuronal differentiation even if the bHLH domain is deleted (38.Giebel B. Campos-Ortega J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6250-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggesting that the DNA binding activity is not essential. In this case, the carboxyl-terminal region including the WRPW domain is essential (38.Giebel B. Campos-Ortega J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6250-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggesting that E(spl) proteins may inhibit differentiation by direct interaction with other proteins but not by DNA binding. Thus, although we do not have any evidence, it is still possible that Hes3a might repress differentiation of some types of neurons, particularly ones that depend on Mash1 for differentiation. Nevertheless, because Hes3a is expressed only by differentiating and mature Purkinje cells, it is more likely that Hes3a may be involved in their maturation, although the precise mechanism remains to be determined. One possible function of Hes3a is sequestration of Groucho because Hes3a has a WRPW domain and therefore interacts with Groucho but cannot bind to the DNA. Thus, Hes3a may inhibit the activity of negative bHLH factors such as Hes1 by sequestration of the corepressor and thereby promote maturation of neurons. However, misexpression of Hes3a in neural precursor cells did not promote neuronal differentiation (Figs. 5 and 6), and therefore the exact functions of Hes3a in Purkinje cells remain to be determined. Exon 1a is transcribed only by postnatal Purkinje cells, whereas exon 1b is transcribed only in embryos. The mechanism of how these two promoters and exons are differentially selected remains to be analyzed. There are only 248 nucleotide residues between the 3′-end of exon 1a and the 5′-end of exon 1b, and it is possible that embryo-specific enhancer sequences are present within this region.

Upon activation by its ligands, Notch is cleaved and its intracellular domain (ICD) is released from the membrane region. Because ICD has a nuclear localization signal, it moves into the nucleus, where it forms a complex with the DNA-binding protein RBP-J. The ICD and RBP-J complex binds to the promoter and induces gene expression. The consensus sequence of the RBP-J-binding sites is (C/T)GTG(G/A)GAA(A/C), and it has been shown that Hes1 andHes5 are the target genes of ICD-RBP-J complex (39.Jarriault S. Le Bail O. Hirsinger E.

In Hes3 gene, a sequence similar to the RBP-J-binding site,TGTGTGAAC (614–622), is present upstream of exon 1b. In addition, there is another possible RBP-J-binding site, AGTGGGAAC (731–739) downstream of exon 1b. They matched eight and seven nucleotides, respectively, out of nine (underlined). However, the active form of Notch failed to up-regulate the Hes3b promoter activity in transient transfection assay. 2H. Hirata and R. Kageyama, unpublished data. Similarly, Hes3a promoter activity is not induced either by the Notch pathway (40.Nishimura M. Isaka F. Ishibashi M. Tomita K. Tsuda H. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Genomics. 1998; 49: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), suggesting that Hes3 expression is not regulated by Notch signaling. It is known that basic fibroblast growth factor and epidermal growth factor play an important role in the maintenance of neural precursor cells (46.McKay R. Science. 1997; 276: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar), and thus it is possible that expression of Hes3b as well as of Hes1 and Hes5 could be regulated by these growth factors. However, comparison of the upstream region of exon 1b with Hes1 and Hes5 promoters failed to reveal specific elements conserved among the three genes. Thus, it remains to be determined whether or not the three genes are controlled by common regulatory factors in neural precursor cells."

J. 1997; 323: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The significant difference between the molecular weight of the type IIa protein (see above) and radiation inactivation size (RIS) was taken as evidence for an oligomeric functional unit of Na+/Pi cotransport. However, since Pi uptake in BBMVs most likely includes contributions from other Pi transport systems, e.g. type I, or other as yet unidentified proteins, estimation of the number of cotransporter subunits of a particular type that contribute to the functional transport unit is not possible. Moreover, the membrane target of radiation may include other proteins and/or membrane domains associated with the cotransporter itself, which could result in an overestimation of the functional mass contributed by type IIa proteins alone.Alternative approaches have been recently used to determine the functional composition of membrane transport proteins. These take advantage of the X. laevis oocyte expression system to overexpress only the protein of interest and thereby avoid contamination of the functional assay. A means of functional identification is then used to assay the contribution made by the constitutive subunits such as non-conductive mutations for the potassium channel (MinK) (19Wang K.W.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). To express functional proteins with a predefined subunit composition, an extension of this approach involves the construction of concatameric cDNAs that encode for linked subunits as used, for example to determine the stoichiometry of KV1.1(24) and epithelial Na+channel (25Firsov D. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Schild L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar).Here, we determined the functional unit of the type IIa Na+/Pi cotransporter (NaP-IIa) by overexpression of the wild type (WT) NaPi-IIa protein and a functionally distinguishable mutant protein (S460C) in X. laevis oocytes. The electrogenic response of oocytes was quantified by means of the two-electrode voltage clamp. We took advantage of the differential sensitivity of the WT NaPi-IIa and mutant cotransporter (S460C) to nominally membrane-impermeant methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents; the WT is insensitive to externally applied MTSEA, whereas Pi uptake and the electrogenic cotransport mode are fully inhibited for S460C (12Lambert G. Forster I.C. Stange G. Biber J. Murer H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 637-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We injected oocytes either with different proportions of cRNAs coding for the WT and S460C protein or for novel fusion proteins (concatamers) that comprised two fused WT or S460C proteins alone, or a mixed protein that comprised the WT and S460C. In both cases we assayed the Pi-induced cotransport activity before and after MTS incubation. The results of each approach were consistent with the NaPi-IIa protein being a functional monomer.DISCUSSIONThis study documents the identification of the functional molecular unit of the type IIa NaPi cotransporter (rat NaPIIa) expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We took advantage of the marked difference in sensitivity of the WT transporter and the S460C mutant to the cysteine-modifying reagent, MTSEA. Whereas the cotransport function of the WT is unchanged after external application of this reagent, that of the S460C mutant is fully inhibited (12Lambert G. Forster I.C. Stange G. Biber J. Murer H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 637-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).The underlying assumption in our use of externally applied MTSEA was that this reagent modified only the substituted cysteine residue at site 460. It has been previously reported that MTSEA can permeate membranes and modify exogenously expressed membrane proteins from the cytosolic side of the membrane (30Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 31Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Brauer D. Kotaria R. Walters D.E. Dean A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12009-12016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, part of the observed inhibition of transport function might be attributable to modification of other functionally important cysteine residues present in both the WT and S460C proteins. For example, the membrane-permeant MTS reagent methyl methanethiosulfonate can inhibit the WT transport activity (12Lambert G. Forster I.C. Stange G. Biber J. Murer H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 637-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, we have shown that for externally applied MTSEA, even at 10-fold higher concentrations than those required to fully suppress S460C function, no alteration in WT transport activity occurs. Moreover, external application of the impermeant reagent 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide (30Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) leads to the same full inhibition of transport function for mutant S460C as MTSEA under the same conditions. These findings established the following: 1) external application of either reagent is able to access the Cys residue at site 460 from the extracellular side, and 2) if MTSEA does permeate the membrane, it is unable to access functionally important cysteine residues associated with NaPi-II protein via this pathway. Therefore, under our experimental conditions MTSEA can be considered impermeant, and any loss of transport function can be attributed only to the chemical modification of Cys-460.To interpret our data, we tacitly assumed that if the transport function of one subunit of an oligomeric functional unit is inhibited through chemical modification of Cys-460, the transport of the entire functional complex is blocked. Given the validity of this assumption, we could make predictions concerning the functional composition of NaPi-II protein and interpret our results accordingly. The results of both approaches matched well with the prediction that NaPi-II protein exists as a functional monomer. For example, for the coinjection experiments if 50% WT and 50% S460C cRNA is injected, we would expect, on average, for random protein association as dimers 25% S460C + S460C, 25% WT + WT, and 50% WT + S460C transporters. Thus, the transport rate should be inhibited by 75%, whereas for a functional monomer, an inhibition of 50% is predicted (Equation 3) that is close to the observed value. Similarly, for the mixed concatamer (WT-S460C), the observed 50% loss of function is consistent with there being two functionally independent transport pathways per concatamer and a total inhibition of the transport pathway established by the S460C protein component. Our interpretation of the data therefore also implies the existence of one transport pathway or, rather unlikely, multiple and identical transport pathways for each functional unit. Although we cannot fully exclude this latter possibility, the simplest interpretation, consistent with our findings, is that there is only one transport pathway per unit of protein.The Coinjection MethodFrom the coinjection experiments, in which the proportion of S460C cRNA varied from 15 to 88%, the best agreement between the measured % inhibition and that predicted from Equation 3 was for N = 1 (i.e. a monomeric functional unit). For all intermediate proportions of cRNA, the measured mean % inhibition always remained slightly below that predicted for N = 1, and the deviation increased at the upper limit (88% S460C). This suggested the influence of a systematic error, which may arise from intrinsic uncertainties in the coinjection method. In the first place, coinjection of equal quantities of two different cRNAs into oocytes does not guarantee that a given percentage of cRNA leads to the corresponding amount of protein either expressed or actually inserted into the membrane as functional cotransporters. For example, membrane expression of one protein could be favored over another, depending on the state of the oocyte expression machinery. Second, expression levels can vary significantly between different isoforms of the same cotransporter. We have observed that the human (5Busch A.E. Wagner C.A. Schuster A. Waldegger S. Biber J. Murer H. Lang F. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1995; 6: 1547-1551PubMed Google Scholar) and mouse (7Hartmann C.M. Wagner C.A. Busch A.E. Markovich D. Biber J. Lang F. Murer H. Pfluegers Arch. 1995; 430: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) NaPi-IIa isoforms, which show very high molecular identity with the rat isoform, give significantly lower functional expression (up to 5-fold) for the same quantity of cRNA injected and same batch of oocytes. 2K. Köhler, I. C. Forster, G. Lambert, J. Biber, and H. Murer, unpublished observations. In the present study, although we found that the amount of cRNA injected correlated well with the electrogenic activity of both WT and the mutant S460C alone, nevertheless coexpression of both cRNAs might still lead to disproportionate functional expression. This could therefore account for the deviation from monomeric prediction at higher proportions of S460C cRNA. Third, time-dependent expression rates of the two proteins could differ depending on the individual oocyte or between donor frogs. In practice, we observed no qualitative differences between WT and S460C with respect to their functional expression in oocytes measured from day 4 to day 6 post-injection, and therefore we think that this would most likely not lead to significant errors in the final membrane expression levels.For the particular case that inhibition of transport would be directly proportional to the number of S460C subunits present in a putative functional oligomer of stoichiometry N, we would be unable to distinguish between a functional unit comprising Nindependent transport pathways and a single composite transport pathway formed by the N subunits, i.e. a 1:1 relation between % inhibition and fraction of mutant cRNA would also be predicted, as for the functional monomer. These two possibilities could be best resolved by morphological means (21Eskandari S. Snyder P.M. Kreman M. Zampighi G.A. Welsh M.J. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27281-27286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Concatameric ConstructsThe kinetic behavior of both the mixed (WT-S460C) and control concatamers (WT-WT, S460C-S460C) confirmed that the transport characteristics of the protein were unaltered compared with the original WT and S460C alone. Moreover, for the WT-WT concatamer, MTSEA application neither altered the transport rate nor the steady-state voltage dependence, which provided further validation of our assumption regarding its use in the present study.The Western blots for oocytes that displayed transport function confirmed the integrity of the fusion proteins by the presence of a single band that had twice the molecular weight of the individual proteins. Based on the Western blot data, the protein levels of the concatamers appeared comparable to those of the WT; however, these data alone do not provide any information concerning the amount of functional protein in the membrane, since the Western blots were obtained from whole cell lysate. Taking together the Western blot and electrophysiological data would therefore suggest that the concatameric protein may not be as efficiently inserted in the membrane as the WT.The concatamer that comprised one WT and one mutant (S460C) transporter as a fusion protein (WT-S460C) provided further evidence of a monomeric functional unit for the NaPi-IIa protein. An alternative proposition is that the dimers themselves associate to form functional tetramers. If this were the case, given random association of dimers and full block of transport for any tetramer that comprised at least one S460C as a subunit, we would then predict a 25% inhibition of function after MTSEA treatment. Our data clearly exclude this possibility. As for the coinjection approach, with the exception of the case in which the S460C half of the concatamer contributes 50% to a common transport pathway that is only 50% inhibited after Cys modification, the behavior of the mixed concatamer is fully consistent with that expected for a functional monomer.Comparison with Other StudiesThe radiation-inactivation method has been used extensively to estimate the molecular size of the functional unit of membrane enzymes (32Kempner E.S.

Although uncertainties concerning the contribution of Pi uptake by proteins other than NaPi-IIa have been recently addressed by combining Western blot analysis with radiation inactivation (18Xiao Y. Boyer C.J. Vincent E. Dugre A. Vachon V. Potier M. Beliveau R. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), a study by Tatsumi et al. (33Tatsumi S. Miyamoto K. Kouda T.

Since these share the same NH2 or COOH-terminal regions, they would also be detected by Western blot together with the full NaPi-IIa protein. This lack of discrimination of the Western blot analysis could therefore oversimplify the identification of the protein constituents of a functional unit.A discrepancy in estimating the functional size of a transport protein has also been reported for the sodium glucose cotransport system.

Wright E.M. Kempner E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the reported RIS of ≈290 kDa, taken together with the molecular masses from Western blots of 70–75 kDa, suggests a tetrameric functional unit in situ. Since the conditions of the transport activity assay during irradiation also alter the predicted RIS as in the case of Pi uptake in BBMVs (16Jette M. Vachon V. Potier M. Beliveau R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15209-15214Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), this could indicate that the target size changes according to which transporter species are active. The assay conditions used in the present study are similar to those encountered in vivo(high inwardly directed Na+ gradient and membrane potentials in the physiological range), and therefore our findings are relevant to the function of NaPi-IIa protein in the intact renal proximal tubule.ConclusionsThis study presents evidence that NaPi-IIa protein is a functional monomer when expressed in Xenopusoocytes. Although we cannot exclude that NaPi-IIa molecules may aggregate either with themselves, to give rise to multiple, independent transport pathways within the same complex, or with other associated proteins in situ, oligomeric assembly of NaPi-IIa proteins is not a necessary condition for type II Na+-dependent Pi transport. The reabsorption of inorganic phosphate (Pi) at the luminal brush border membrane of the renal proximal tubule is mediated chiefly by a Na+-coupled cotransport process. Three unique types of Na+/Pi cotransporters have been identified in proximal tubular epithelia as follows: type I, type IIa, and type III (1Murer H. Forster I. Hernando N. Lambert G. Traebert M. Biber J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F676-F684PubMed Google Scholar, 2Murer, H., Hernando, N., Forster, I., and Biber, J. (2000)Physiol. Rev., in pressGoogle Scholar). The type IIa Na+/Picotransporter (NaPi-IIa)1contributes the major component of luminal Pi transport (1Murer H. Forster I. Hernando N. Lambert G. Traebert M. Biber J. Am. J.

On Western blots made from brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) the rat type IIa isoform (NaPi-IIa) protein is detected as an 80–90-kDa glycoprotein (8Custer M. Lotscher M. Biber J. Murer H.

When expressed in Xenopus laevisoocytes, a similar band, specific to NaPi-IIa, at 70–110 kDa is observed (11Hayes G. Busch A. Lotscher M. Waldegger S. Lang F. Verrey F. Biber J. Murer H. J. Biol.

From a number of studies using the radiation inactivation technique applied to Pi uptake in BBMVs, estimates of the functional size of the Na+/Pi system have ranged from 124 to 242 kDa depending on the species and assay conditions (13Beliveau R.

The significant difference between the molecular weight of the type IIa protein (see above) and radiation inactivation size (RIS) was taken as evidence for an oligomeric functional unit of Na+/Pi cotransport. However, since Pi uptake in BBMVs most likely includes contributions from other Pi transport systems, e.g. type I, or other as yet unidentified proteins, estimation of the number of cotransporter subunits of a particular type that contribute to the functional transport unit is not possible. Moreover, the membrane target of radiation may include other proteins and/or membrane domains associated with the cotransporter itself, which could result in an overestimation of the functional mass contributed by type IIa proteins alone. Alternative approaches have been recently used to determine the functional composition of membrane transport p"

Rubisco activase facilitates this spontaneous carbamylation/metal-binding process by removing phosphorylated inhibitors from the Rubisco active site. Activase from Solanaceae plants (e.g. tobacco) fails to activate Rubisco from non-Solanaceae plants (e.g. spinach andChlamydomonas reinhardtii), and non-Solanaceae activase fails to activate Solanaceae Rubisco. Directed mutagenesis and chloroplast transformation previously showed that a proline 89 to arginine substitution on the surface of the large subunit ofChlamydomonas Rubisco switched its specificity from non-Solanaceae to Solanaceae activase activation. To define the size and function of this putative activase binding region, substitutions were created at positions flanking residue 89. As in the past, these substitutions changed the identities of Chlamydomonasresidues to those of tobacco. Whereas an aspartate 86 to arginine substitution had little effect, aspartate 94 to lysine Rubisco was only partially activated by spinach activase but now fully activated by tobacco activase. In an attempt to eliminate the activase/Rubisco interaction, proline 89 was changed to alanine, which is not present in either non-Solanaceae or Solanaceae Rubisco. This substitution also caused reversal of activase specificity, indicating that amino acid identity alone does not determine the specificity of the interaction.

Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 1-28Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar and 2Spreitzer R.J. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 29-42Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To be active, Lys-201 on the Rubisco large subunit must be carbamylated and coordinated with Mg2+ prior to binding RuBP (reviewed in Refs. 2Spreitzer R.J. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 29-42Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar and 3Portis Jr., A.R. J. Exp. Bot. 1995; 46: 1285-1291Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, Rubisco is similar to urease, which also uses a carbamate as a ligand for metal binding (5Jabri E. Carr M.B. Hausinger R.P. Karplus P.A. Science. 1995; 268: 998-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). However, whereas urease requires a set of proteins for the addition of Ni2+ to its active site (6Soriano A. Hausinger R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11140-11144Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), Rubisco appears to require only one. This protein, Rubisco activase, removes inhibitory sugar phosphates, including RuBP, from the nonactivated active site, thereby facilitating subsequent, spontaneous carbamylation and Mg2+ binding (reviewed in Refs. 3Portis Jr., A.R. J. Exp. Bot. 1995; 46: 1285-1291Crossref Google Scholar and 4Salvucci M.E. Ogren W.L. Photosynth. Res. 1996; 47: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In some cases, fully activated (metal-bound) Rubisco may bind inhibitory sugar phosphates that mimic the carboxylation transition state (7Berry J.A. Lorimer G.H. Pierce J. Seemann J.R. Meek J.

These molecules are also removed by Rubisco activase to restore a functional active site (8Robinson S.P. Portis Jr., A.R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 233: 413-416Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 9Mate C.J. Hudson G.S. von Caemmerer S. Evans J.R. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1119-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Like one of the urease activation proteins, UreG (5Jabri E. Carr M.B. Hausinger R.P. Karplus P.A. Science. 1995; 268: 998-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar), Rubisco activase hydrolyzes nucleoside triphosphate during the activation process (10Wang Z.Y. Portis Jr., A.R. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 1348-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 11van de Loo F.J. Salvucci M.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4621-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, except for a P-loop motif, there is little homology between these two proteins. Rubisco activase from plants in the family Solanaceae (e.g.tobacco) fails to activate Rubisco from plants outside the family (e.g. spinach and the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), and activase from non-Solanaceae plants fails to activate Solanaceae Rubisco (12Wang Z.Y. Snyder G.W. Esau B.D. Portis Jr., A.R. Ogren W.L. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Comparison of sequences and x-ray crystal structures revealed that there are seven residues clustered on the surface of the Rubisco large subunit that differ in charge between the Solanaceae and non-Solanaceae enzymes (residues 86, 89, 94, 95, 356, 466, and 468) (3Portis Jr., A.R. J. Exp. Bot. 1995; 46: 1285-1291Crossref Google Scholar, 13Larson E.M. O'Brien C.M. Spreitzer R.J. Portis Jr., A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 17033-17037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because the large subunit is coded by a chloroplast gene (rbcL) in plants and green algae, and because chloroplast transformation has been difficult to achieve in land plants with respect to this gene (14Kanevski I. Maliga P. Rhoades D.F. Gutteridge S. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Whitney S.M. von Caemmerer S. Hudson G.S. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), directed mutagenesis and chloroplast transformation were used to investigate the significance of this region in Chlamydomonas Rubisco (13Larson E.M.

Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 515-527Google Scholar). Two of the most conserved residues of non-Solanaceae Rubisco were switched to those characteristic of Solanaceae Rubisco. A K356Q substitution had no detectable effect on Rubisco function or activation properties. However, a P89R mutant enzyme could no longer be activated by non-Solanaceae Rubisco activase but, instead, could be activated by Solanaceae activase (13Larson E.M. O'Brien C.M. Spreitzer R.J. Portis Jr., A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 17033-17037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that this surface region plays a role in the interaction between Rubisco and Rubisco activase. Because of its important role in plant productivity, a deeper understanding of the interaction between Rubisco and its activation protein may present new ideas for engineering an increase in enzyme activity (reviewed in Refs. 3Portis Jr., A.R. J. Exp. Bot. 1995; 46: 1285-1291Crossref Google Scholar and 4Salvucci M.E. Ogren W.L. Photosynth. Res. 1996; 47: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Furthermore, species specificity between Rubisco and Rubisco activase may prove to be a stumbling block for the transfer of a catalytically improved enzyme from one species into the chloroplast of a different, agronomically important species (reviewed in Ref. 2Spreitzer R.J. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 29-42Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the present study, additional substitutions were made to define the nature of the large-subunit region that interacts with activase. One substitution changes the specificity of the interaction by introducing a residue at position 89 that differs from either of the residues characteristic of Solanaceae and non-Solanaceae Rubisco. C. reinhardtii2137 mt + is the wild-type strain (17Spreitzer R.J. Mets L. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 565-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant 18-7G mt + was used as the host for transformation (18Spreitzer R.J. Ogren W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6293-6297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It lacks photosynthesis and requires acetate for growth because of an rbcL nonsense mutation that terminates large-subunit translation after residue 65 (18Spreitzer R.J. Ogren W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6293-6297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Spreitzer R.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rahire M. Rochaix J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5460-5464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Photosynthesis-competent mutant P89R was created by directed mutagenesis and chloroplast transformation in a previous study (13Larson E.M. O'Brien C.M. Spreitzer R.J. Portis Jr., A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 17033-17037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All strains are maintained in darkness at 25 °C with 10 mm acetate medium containing 1.5% Bacto agar (17Spreitzer R.J. Mets L. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 565-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For biochemical analysis, cells were grown in 50–250 ml of liquid acetate medium on a rotary shaker in darkness. A 2670-base pair HpaI DNA fragment (bases −742 to 1928), containing the entire rbcL gene (bases 1–1428) (20Dron M. Rahire M. Rochaix J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 162: 775-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), was cloned into SmaI-digested pUC19 (21Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene. 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar) and propagated inEscherichia coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with a kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (22Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). To produce the D86R substitution, therbcL gene sequence GAT (bases 256–258) was changed to CGT, which eliminated an EcoRV restriction site. To create the P89A substitution, CCA (bases 265–267) was changed to GCT, which eliminated a BsrI restriction site. To create the D94K substitution, GAC (bases 280–282) was changed to AAA, which eliminated a BbsI restriction site. The mutations were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. The resultingrbcL mutant plasmids, named pLS-D86R, pLS-P89A, and pLS-D94K, were transformed into the chloroplast by microprojectile bombardment (23Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol.

Following previous methods (13Larson E.M. O'Brien C.M. Spreitzer R.J. Portis Jr., A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 17033-17037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Zhu G.

The rbcL mutant strains created by directed mutagenesis and chloroplast transformation were named D86R, P89A, and D94K. Total soluble cell proteins were extracted from dark-grown cells by sonication (26Spreitzer R.J. Chastain C.J. Curr. Genet. 1987; 11: 611-616Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and quantified (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Cell extract was fractionated on sucrose gradients (26Spreitzer R.J. Chastain C.J. Curr. Genet. 1987; 11: 611-616Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a 7.5–15% polyacrylamide gradient in the running gel (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose, probed with rabbit anti-tobacco Rubisco immunoglobulin G (0.5 μg/ml), and detected via enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (13Larson E.M. O'Brien C.M. Spreitzer R.J. Portis Jr., A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 17033-17037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Rubisco was purified from wild-type and mutant cells in a carbamylation buffer (50 mm Tricine, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA) as described previously (13Larson E.M. O'Brien C.M. Spreitzer R.J. Portis Jr., A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 17033-17037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The non-carbamylated, RuBP-inhibited enzyme was prepared in 50 mm Tricine, pH 8.0, 2 mm RuBP, and 0.1 mm EDTA (13Larson E.M. O'Brien C.M. Spreitzer R.J. Portis Jr., A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 17033-17037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The amount of protein was determined by assuming an extinction coefficient of 1.64 absorbance units for 1 mg/ml at 280 nm. Enzyme was stored in liquid N2. Leaves from spinach and tobacco plants were powdered in liquid N2, and Rubisco activase was purified as described previously (12Wang Z.Y. Snyder G.W. Esau B.D. Portis Jr., A.R. Ogren W.L. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme was stored in bis-Tris, pH 7.0, and 0.2 mm ATP under liquid N2. Rubisco activase activity was measured by following the increase in carboxylase activity of the RuBP-inhibited Rubisco enzymes with time in spectrophotometric assays that couple the production of phosphoglycerate to the oxidation of NADH (13Larson E.M. O'Brien C.M. Spreitzer R.J. Portis Jr., A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 17033-17037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Lan Y. Mott K.A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It was previously shown that a P89R substitution in theChlamydomonas large subunit reversed the specificities of the interactions with non-Solanaceae (spinach) and Solanaceae (tobacco) Rubisco activases (13Larson E.M. O'Brien C.M. Spreitzer R.J. Portis Jr., A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 17033-17037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Of those residues that differ between non-Solanaceae and Solanaceae Rubisco in the region surrounding large-subunit residue 89 (13Larson E.M. O'Brien C.M. Spreitzer R.J. Portis Jr., A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 17033-17037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar), residues 86 and 94 flank residue 89 and may cause substantial differences in conformation (Fig.1). His-86 interacts with Glu-88 in spinach (30Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), but Arg-86 interacts with Glu-88 in tobacco (31Schreuder H.A. Knight S. Curmi P.M.G. Andersson I. Cascio D. Sweet R.M. Branden C.I. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1136-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Glu-94 interacts with Asn-95 in spinach, but Lys-94 interacts with Glu-93 in tobacco (Fig. 1). Like many of the other non-Solanaceae enzymes,Chlamydomonas Rubisco contains Asp at positions 86 and 94. Therefore, to gain further insight into the interaction between Rubisco and Rubisco activase, we decided to create D86R and D94K large-subunit substitutions that would change the identities of theChlamydomonas residues to those of tobacco. In addition, because most Rubisco enzymes contain either Pro (non-Solanaceae) or Arg (Solanaceae) at residue 89, we reasoned that it might be possible to eliminate the interaction between Rubisco and Rubisco activase (without substantially altering Rubisco structural stability) by creating a P89A substitution. D86R, D94K, and P89A mutant strains were recovered by transforming the chloroplast of the 18-7G rbcL nonsense mutant with directed mutant rbcL genes and selecting for photosynthetic competence on minimal medium in the light. Because transformant colonies were recovered at frequencies comparable with the transformation frequency with wild-type rbcL (13Larson E.M. O'Brien C.M. Spreitzer R.J. Portis Jr., A.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26789-26793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), it was apparent that none of the amino acid substitutions substantially affected Rubisco holoenzyme structure, activation, or function in vivo. When compared with wild type in spot tests (17Spreitzer R.J. Mets L. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 565-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), only the D94K mutant exhibited slightly reduced growth on minimal medium in the light (80 μmol of photons/m2/s). Growth at 18 or 35 °C or under 15-min light (80 μmol of photons/m2/s), 15-min dark cycles failed to exacerbate the phenotype of D94K or reduce the growth of the D86R, P89A, or P89R mutant strains relative to that of wild type. Sucrose-gradient fractionation and Western analysis (Fig.2) revealed that the D86R, D94K, and P89A mutants contain about half as much Rubisco as wild-type and mutant P89R, presumably because of increased holoenzyme instability/proteolysis in vivo (24Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18494-18498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Moreno J. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26789-26793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, when fully carbamylated, all of the purified mutant enzymes had near normal RuBP carboxylase specific activities. As found previously for P89R (13Larson E.M. O'Brien C.M. Spreitzer R.J. Portis Jr., A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 17033-17037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the large subunits of the D86R and D94K enzymes displayed increased mobility during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.2). Because this is not the case for the P89A large subunit (Fig. 2,lane 5), it is likely that the introduction of positive charge, rather than an alteration in conformation (32Mattice W.L. Riser J.M. Clark D.S. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4264-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), is responsible for the altered migration. Non-carbamylated, RuBP-inhibited Rubisco was prepared from the mutant strains. The rates at which these enzymes became carbamylated were then determined in the presence of either spinach or tobacco Rubisco activase (Fig.3). Mutant D86R Rubisco was indistinguishable from the wild-type enzyme with regard to activation properties. Both enzymes were activated by spinach activase, but activation by tobacco activase was not much greater than the spontaneous rate in the absence of activase (Fig. 3, comparepanels A and B). In contrast, mutant D94K Rubisco was activated only slightly above the spontaneous rate by spinach activase, but at a near normal rate by tobacco activase (Fig.3 C). This reversal of specificity is similar to that observed for P89R Rubisco in a previous study (13Larson E.M. O'Brien C.M. Spreitzer R.J. Portis Jr., A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 17033-17037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, when mutant P89A Rubisco was analyzed, it was also found to be activated by tobacco activase but not at all by spinach activase (Fig.3 D). This was an unexpected result because tobacco Rubisco contains Arg at this position. A large-subunit P89R substitution, shown previously (13Larson E.M. O'Brien C.M. Spreitzer R.J. Portis Jr., A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 17033-17037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar), or a D94K substitution, in the present study (Fig. 3), alters the specificity of the interaction between Chlamydomonas Rubisco and land-plant Rubisco activase. Whereas the wild-typeChlamydomonas enzyme can be activated by spinach (non-Solanaceae) activase but not tobacco (Solanaceae) activase, both of the mutant enzymes can be activated by tobacco activase but not spinach activase (Ref. 13Larson E.M. O'Brien C.M. Spreitzer R.J. Portis Jr., A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 17033-17037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar; Fig. 3). These results would seem to indicate that either of at least two residues (Arg-89 or Lys-94) on the surface of the Rubisco large subunit is sufficient for recognition by tobacco activase, but both of at least two residues (Pro-89 and Asp-94) are necessary for recognition by spinach activase. However, a large-subunit P89A substitution also blocks Rubisco activation by spinach activase and permits activation by tobacco activase (Fig. 3). Perhaps it is the absence of Pro rather than the presence of Arg at residue 89 that is required for activation by tobacco activase. Inspection of the spinach and tobacco Rubisco crystal structures (30Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,31Schreuder H.A. Knight S. Curmi P.M.G. Andersson I. Cascio D. Sweet R.M. Branden C.I. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1136-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1) reveals that Lys-94 in tobacco forms an ionic bond with Glu-93, but the side chain of Glu-94 in spinach is either exposed to solvent or may form a hydrogen bond with Asn-95. By replacing Asp-94 inChlamydomonas Rubisco with Lys, an ionic interaction may be formed with the otherwise solvent-exposed Glu-93, mimicking the structure of tobacco Rubisco. Arg-89 in tobacco might be able to form an ionic interaction with Asp-95 in vivo, preventing an ionic interaction between Asp-95 and Lys-94. Replacing Pro-89 inChlamydomonas Rubisco with Arg would not mimic this potential interaction because Chlamydomonas contains Asn-95 and Asp-94 (Fig. 1). Instead, by introducing a solvent-exposed Arg or small, aliphatic Ala, the conformational constraints imposed by Pro-89 would be eliminated. Thus, we propose that it is the conformation of the loop between β-strands C and D (Fig. 1), not specific ionic interactions, that is responsible for the specificity of activase for Rubisco. It may be necessary to compare mutant enzyme crystal structures to address this possibility (33Yen A. Haas E.J. Selbo K.M. Ross II C.R. Spreitzer R.J. Stezowski J.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). However, now that it has recently become possible to engineer tobacco Rubisco in vivo(14Kanevski I. Maliga P. Rhoades D.F. Gutteridge S. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Whitney S.M. von Caemmerer S. Hudson G.S. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), it would be interesting to see whether an R89A substitution would reverse activase specificity, presumably by promoting the formation of an ionic bond between Lys-94 and Asp-95 and mimicking the loop structure of spinach Rubisco. It is of interest to note that β-strands C and D pack against α-helix B in the N-terminal domain of the Rubisco large subunit (30Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Whereas the loop between β-strands C and D interacts with Rubisco activase, as evidenced by the effect of P89R, P89A, and D94K substitutions on Rubisco activase specificity (13, Fig. 3), the last residue of α-helix B, Glu-60, forms an ionic bond with Lys-334 in the C-terminal domain of a neighboring large subunit (30Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 31Schreuder H.A. Knight S. Curmi P.M.G. Andersson I. Cascio D. Sweet R.M. Branden C.I. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1136-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Lys-334 resides at the apex of α/β-barrel loop 6, which determines the specificity of Rubisco for carboxylation and oxygenation (34Chen Z. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3051-3053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Chen Z., Yu, W. Lee J.H. Diao R. Spreitzer R.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8846-8850Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 36Lorimer G.H. Chen Y.R. Hartman F.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9018-9024Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because loop 6 traps substrate and intermediates in the active site (30Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 31Schreuder H.A. Knight S. Curmi P.M.G. Andersson I. Cascio D. Sweet R.M. Branden C.I. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1136-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), it is tempting to consider whether an interaction with Rubisco activase might produce subtle changes in the structure of the N-terminal domain that are responsible for the removal of phosphorylated inhibitors from the active site. Although a site of recognition between Rubisco and Rubisco activase is not necessarily the site at which activase facilitates activation, it may be interesting to examine the activation properties of N-terminal domain mutant enzymes that have alterations in CO2/O2 specificity (23Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3952-3956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Spreitzer R.J. Thow G. Zhu G. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The D94K, P89R, and P89A mutant strains grow under photoautotrophic conditions even though their mutant Rubisco enzymes cannot be activated by spinach Rubisco activase in vitro (13, Fig. 3). Considering that Chlamydomonas can survive photoautotrophically with as little as 15% of the wild-type level of RuBP carboxylase activity (reviewed in Ref. 16Spreitzer R.J. Rochaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 515-527Google Scholar), and the presence of a CO2 concentrating mechanism may provide a high level of spontaneous carbamylation (reviewed in Ref. 38Spalding M.H. Rochaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 529-547Google Scholar), it would not be surprising to find that Rubisco activase is not essential for the growth of Chlamydomonas. However, this does not mean that activase would provide no benefit for the function of Rubisco and the growth of Chlamydomonas. Alternatively,Chlamydomonas activase may be able to activate the D94K, P89R, and P89A mutant enzymes in vivo because it lacks the specificity of spinach and tobacco activases or because it recognizes a large-subunit conformation that is not affected by the D94K, P89R, and P89A substitutions. It has not yet been possible to purify sufficient quantities of Chlamydomonas activase to resolve these questions. Nonetheless, now that we have a better understanding of the large-subunit region that interacts with activase (Figs. 1 and 3), it may be possible to engineer single or multiple substitutions that would eliminate the interaction between Rubisco and Rubisco activase. Such mutants may be useful for identifying amino acid substitutions in activase that restore the interaction with Rubisco (16Spreitzer R.J. Rochaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 515-527Google Scholar), thereby defining a complementing binding site on Rubisco activase."

The apyrase protein family comprises enzymes capable of cleaving nucleotide tri- and diphosphates in a calcium- or magnesium-dependent manner, not being altered by P-type, F-type, or V-type NTPase inhibitors. In this study we have cloned and sequenced the human LALP70 gene to determine the genomic structure. The gene is organized in 11 introns and 12 exons covering a genomic region of approximately 16 kilobase pairs. By fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, thehLALP70 gene was mapped to the human chromosome 8p21.1-p21.3. We further show that there is at least one alternatively spliced variant, hLALP70v, which can be generated via an alternative splice side at the 3′-end of exon 7, leading to a protein variant differing in 8 amino acids (VSFASSQQ). This is the first splice variant that has been described in the apyrase protein family. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis showed an ubiquitous expression of both variants, with different relative mRNA expression levels in different tissues. Comparison of the enzymatic properties of the splice variants revealed a broader substrate specificity for hLALP70v with CTP, UDP, CDP, GTP, and GDP as preferred substrates, while hLALP70 utilized UTP and TTP preferentially. Furthermore, enzyme activity of hLALP70v was equally dependent on Ca2+ and Mg2+, being saturated already at 1 mm concentration. In contrast, hLALP70 enzymatic activity were unsaturated up to 10 mm Ca2+, while Mg2+ showed a saturation at already 1 mmconcentration with 2–3-fold lower enzymatic activity as observed with Ca2+.

Members of the apyrase family contain up to four homolog conserved sequence stretches, which have been described as apyrase conserved regions (ACRs1; Ref. 2.Handa M. Guidotti G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity differs between different apyrases and seems to be sensitive to small changes in the amino acid sequence outside the ACRs. This was shown for the 97% identical apyrase isoforms (NTP1 and NTP3) of Toxoplasma gondii (3.Bermudes D. Peck K.R. Afifi M.A. Beckers C.J.M. Joiner K.A. J. Biol.

Apyrases with a substrate specificity restricted to nucleotide triphosphates are classified as E-type ATPases (1.Plesner L. Int. Rev.

Originally, apyrases have been described as ectoenzymes, like CD 39 (7), or other ecto NTPases (1.Plesner L. Int. Rev.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2473-2484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human lysomal apyrase-like protein (hLALP70) belongs to the apyrase gene family, based on four ACRs in the N-terminal half of the sequence (11.Biederbick A. Rose S. Elsässer H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2473-2484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hLALP70 cDNA has an open reading frame of 1848 bp, encoding a protein with a molecular mass of 71 kDa (11.Biederbick A. Rose S. Elsässer H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2473-2484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on sequence analysis, hydrophobicity plot and in vitrotranscription/translation studies, hLALP70 is thought to be inserted in the membrane as a type III membrane protein (11.Biederbick A. Rose S. Elsässer H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2473-2484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Singer J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 247-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), with one transmembrane domain at the C terminus and two transmembrane domains at the N terminus of the protein. The amino acid sequence of hLALP70 is nearly identical with the sequence of the human UDPase (hUDPase; Ref.10.Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), except for an additional stretch of 8 amino acids, located 7 amino acids downstream from the ACR4 in the hLALP70 protein. We have isolated and analyzed the hLALP70 gene and provide evidence that the hUDPase is a splice variant of hLALP70. This is the first splice variant described so far for the apyrase family. RT-PCR analysis revealed a differential expression of hLALP70 and its splice variant. Finally we show that the two proteins differing in the 8 amino acids exhibit differences in their enzymatic properties. For isolation of genomic clones containing the human LALP70gene, high density PAC hybridization filters (RLDB2, Berlin, Germany) were used. As probe a 321-bp fragment of the hLALP70 gene, representing the 3′-portion of the cDNA sequence (GenBankTMaccession number AJ131358), was amplified by PCR using primers (LALP1f, 5′-CGG GGC GTT TCC TTT GTCTAC-3′ and LALP1r, 5′-CTC GGC CTG CAT TTT GTT TTT-3′, annealing temperature: 58 °C). After hybridization a strong signal for PAC131C11, and weaker signals for several additional clones, were observed. PAC131C11 was used for the determination of the genomic structure by sequencing. Sequencing templates were generated by means of PCR using cDNA-derived primers. PCR products were separated by gel electrophoresis and purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). Approximately 75 ng of purified DNA was used for cycle sequencing. The cycle sequencing was performed according to manufacture's recommendations using ABI Prism BigDye terminator kit (PE Biosystems). Products from cycle sequencing were concentrated using standard ethanol precipitation procedure and analyzed on a ABI 373 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The resulting sequences were aligned by the software package Sequencher (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI). To confirm that LALP70 and LALP70v (see below) are transcripts from the same gene, we performed a PCR analysis using primers LALP2f/r and LALP3f/r (Fig. 3 A; LALP2f, 5′-ATGGGCGGCGTGTCGACT-3′; LALP2r, 5′-TTAGAGGGAAGTCTGGGTCTC-3′; LALP3f, 5′-TGATGTTCACCAAACTGAGC-3′; LALP3r, 5′-AGGTCAAAGTCTCCAGTCCC-3′; annealing temperature 55 °C). As template we used either genomic DNA obtained from six unrelated individuals or the PAC131C11 DNA, respectively. Southern blot analysis was performed according to standard protocols. As hybridization probe we used a 400-bp PCR product generated with the LALP2f/r primers from the LALP70 cDNA as template. LALP2f/r primers are identical to those used by Wang and Guidotti (10.Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The chromosomal localization of human LALP70 gene by fluorescence in situhybridization (FISH) analysis was carried out on spreads of human lymphocyte metaphase chromosomes, with biotinylated PAC131C11 DNA as probe as described previously (13.Kunz J. Scherer S.W. Klawitz I. Soder S. Du Y.Z. Speich N. Kalff-Suske M. Heng H.H. Tsui L.C. Grzeschik K.H. Genomics. 1994; 22: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In brief, 30 ng of total PAC DNA was labeled with biotin-7-dATP by nick translation (Nick Translation Kit, Life Technologies, Inc.) and detected after hybridization procedure with FITC streptavidin, biotinylated goat anti-streptavidin, and FITC streptavidin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Chromosome counterstaining was performed using DAPI, and slides were embedded in Vectashield (Vector). The preparations were analyzed with a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope, equipped with a CCD camera (Photometrics, München, Germany) controlled by the software package Smartcapture (Vysis, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany). Additional to FISH localization, hLALP70 was mapped with the Genebridge 4 radiation hybrid panel consisting 93 radiation hybrid clones of the human genome (Research Genetics). Screen were performed in duplicate, and the results of the PCR analysis were submitted to the server at the Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research's radiation hybrid map of the human genome. For the isolation of total RNA samples from different organs indicated in Fig. 3 were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Tissue samples were extracted with RNAclean (AGS) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 6 μg were used for the RT reaction in a total volume of 20 μl. As primer the lower primer indicated in Fig. 4 A was used (20 pmol). Reverse transcription was performed for 2 h at 42 °C with 10 units of a reverse transcriptase from avian myeloblastosis virus (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). 5 μl from the RT reaction mix was used for a subsequent PCR in a total volume of 50 μl using 20 pmol of each primer indicated in Fig. 3 and 10 units of Taq polymerase (Promega). The annealing temperature was set to 56 °C and the PCR was run for 35 cycles. 20 μl of the PCR reaction mix were analyzed on a 3% Metaphor-agarose gel (FMC Bioproducts) in TBE buffer (90 mm Tris base, 10 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA). The full-length hLALP70 cDNA plus 105 bp 5′- and approximately 350 bp 3′-untranslated regions was subcloned into the pMCS-5 vector (MoBiTec, Göttingen, Germany) using FseI and XhoI restriction sites after a complete digest with FseI and a partial digest withXhoI. The hLALP70v cDNA was generated from the hLALP70-pMCS plasmid by deletion of the 24 bp between nucleotides 1028–1051 by PCR amplification using the Quick Change Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The sense deletion primer 5′-GCG TAC GAA GTC CCC AAA ACT GAA GAA GTA GCT-3′ was complementary to the antisense deletion primer 5′-AGC TAC TTC TTC AGT TTT GGG GAC TTC GTA CGC-3′. The deletion mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction. The amplified cDNA was provided inEscherichia coli XL1-blue supercompetent cells (Stratagene). The correctness of the 24-bp deletion was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Both hLALP70 and hLALP70v were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCL-Neo (Promega) using MluI and XbaI restriction sites. COS-7 cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 g/liter Hepes, 5% fetal calf serum, 5% adult calf serum, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified chamber equilibrated with 5% CO2. COS-7 cells were transfected with the mammalian pCL-Neo expression vector alone or with this vector containing either the cDNA for hLALP70 or for hLALP70v, respectively, using a 25-kDa polyethyleneimine (Aldrich) as transfection reagent. Transfection procedure was performed as described elsewhere (Biederbick et al. (11.Biederbick A. Rose S. Elsässer H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2473-2484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Transfected cells were harvested for the apyrase enzymatic assay 24 h after transfection. Transfected COS-7 cells were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer, and nuclei were separated as described elsewhere (14.Biederbick A. Kern H.F. Elsässer H.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar). To separate the crude membrane fraction from the cytosol the postnuclear supernatant were centrifuged with 105,000 × g. The pellets were resuspended in 400 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The protein concentration in each sample was determined with bicinchoninic acid (Sigma) according to the manufacture's instructions. To measure apyrase activity COS-7 membrane suspension containing 6 μg total protein were adjusted to 45 μl with reaction buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, and 0.5 mm Na3VO4, with or without 5 mm CaCl2. After preincubation of 5 min at 37 °C nucleotide phosphatase reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 μl of the same buffer containing 10 mmnucleotide phosphate substrates to give a final concentration of 1 mm. Samples were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. NTP/NDP hydrolysis under these conditions were linear up to 30 min. Apyrase activity was determined by measuring the inorganic phosphate released as described previously (15.Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-117Crossref Scopus (3023) Google Scholar, 16.Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar). Values obtained from samples without CaCl2 or MgCl2 were subtracted from those obtained with CaCl2 or MgCl2. All measurements were done in triplicate. Primers specific for the human LALP70 gene identified a PAC clone (131C11) with a 80-kb insert (data not shown). This PAC clone was subsequently used for primer-directed sequence walk to analyze the genomic structure of the human LALP70 gene. Our sequence analysis of thehLALP70 gene revealed that it contains 12 exons and 11 introns, covering a genomic region of approximately 16 kb (Fig.1 A; TableI). The sizes of the exons range from 8 nucleotides (exon 1) to 325 bp (exon 9). Sequence analysis of the intron-exon junctions revealed that all splice sites obeyed the GT-AG paradigm (Table I). The hLALP70 gene containing PAC131C11 clone was found to hybridize specifically at a single locus on the short arm of chromosome 8 (Fig.2 A), and no specific signals were observed on any other chromosome. DAPI banding analysis indicated the localization of hLALP70 to the chromosomal region 8p21.1-p21.3 (Fig. 2 B). To map the gene more precisely, we used for radiation hybrid mapping the Genbridge G4 panel (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) and PCR. Primers for mapping were described above. We determined that the gene is located 0.4 centiRay distal to WI-961 (LOD >3.1), which is located in the Genethon map between the markers D8S1734 and D8S1820 (44.9 and 54.2 centimorgans from the top of chromosome 8, respectively). In this area the EST sequence KIAA0392, which represents the 3′-end of the hLALP70v cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AF016032), has been located previously (17.Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Nakajima D.

Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) except for an additional 24-base pair insert in the hLALP70 sequence. We located these 24 bp at the end of exon 7. The 5′-end of the 24-bp stretch provided an alternative splice site (Fig. 1 B). Based on this we concluded that the human Golgi apyrase might be a splice variant of hLALP70, further designated as hLALP70v. In the paper published by Wang and Guidotti (10.Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) the authors used a genomic Southern blot approach with EcoRI- or NdeI-digested genomic DNA and a 400-bp fragment from the hUDPase cDNA as hybridization probe, which did not contain a EcoRI or NdeI restriction site. Since they obtained two bands they speculated that there might be two similar genes. Correlation of the 400-bp fragment to theLALP70 gene structure showed that the sequence contained the entire exon 8, as well as parts of exon 7 and exon 9 (Fig.3 A). To confirm that hLALP70 and hLALP70v are transcripts from the same coding sequence, we used PCR primers located in the 400-bp fragment used by Wang and Guidotti (Ref.10.Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar; Fig. 3 A, LALP3f/r). As template we used genomic DNA from six unrelated individuals, all of which gave a single band of approximately 2.9 kb (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4–9, and3 C, lane 4), as expected from the LALPgene structure (Table I and Fig. 3 A). When the LALP cDNA was used as template, a 320-bp fragment occurred (Fig. 3 B,lane 3). We performed the PCR also with the PAC131C11 DNA as template and obtained the same 2.9-kb fragment (Fig. 3 B,lane 2, and 3 C, lane 1). Digestion of this fragment, or a fragment generated from genomic DNA (Fig.3 C, lanes 1 and 4) with eitherEcoRI (Fig. 3 C, lanes 2 and5) or NdeI (Fig. 3 C, lanes 3 and 6), resulted in two bands indicating one restriction site for each enzyme within the 2.9-kb fragment. This was confirmed by sequence analysis of the intron between exons 8 and 9, which contains one EcoRI and one NdeI restriction site. Finally, we digested the PAC131C11 DNA with EcoRI orNdeI, respectively, and performed a Southern blot analysis using the 400-bp fragment as hybridization probe as described in Fig.3. As shown in Fig. 3 D we obtained the two expected bands for each enzyme with an identical hybridization pattern as shown by Wang and Guidotti (10.Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). From these results we have to conclude that hLALP70 and hLALP70v are transcripts from the same gene, generated by alternative splicing. In subsequent experiments we analyzed the expression of mLALP and mLALPv in 14 different mouse tissues by a RT-PCR approach (Fig.4 A). Primers were designed according to a mouse EST (GenBankTM accession numberAA497420) representing the hLALP70 mouse homolog (mLALP) containing the 24 bp (Fig. 4 A). PCR primer were flanking the 24 bp. The 5′-sequence of the upper primer was complemented with a sequence from the human LALP70, since only 11 bp of the 5′-upstream mLALP sequence were available from the data base (Fig. 4 A). Results from the RT-PCR approach revealed that both mLALP and mLALPv were expressed in all tissues (Fig. 4 B). However, the relative level of mLALPv was always much lower than that of mLALP. The highest expression of mLALPv were found in liver and kidney (Fig. 4 B). We conclude that mLALP and mLALPv are both ubiquitously expressed, but that the levels of expression might be tissue-specific. In our next experiment we analyzed the enzyme substrate specificity of the human LALP70 and its splice variant hLALP70v to determine the influence of the 8 amino acids VSFASSQQ on the enzyme activity. Data from other apyrases have shown that only slight differences in the sequence can have a marked influence on the substrate specificity (4.Nakaar V. Beckers C.J. Polotsky V. Joiner K.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 5.Smith T.M. Lewis C.S.A. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5849-5857Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18.Smith T.M. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Moreover, our own experiments revealed that a green fluorescence protein tag also changed the substrate specificity (data not shown). For this reason we cloned hLALP70 and hLALP70v into an expression vector without any tag. Using lysates from cells that had been transfected with these constructs we measured the apyrase activity for a variety of NTPs and NDPs as indicated in Fig. 5. While hLALP70 exhibited the highest enzyme activity on UTP and TTP, hLALP70v cleaved CTP most efficiently followed by CDP, UDP, and GTP. Thus, hLALP70v has a broad substrate specificity indicative for a typical apyrase based on a definition by enzymatic properties (1.Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). According to these results, hLALP70v does not represent a typical UDPase as has been published on the basis of enzyme data obtained with a LALP70v/myc fusion protein (10.Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Since apyrase activity usually depends on the presence of divalent cations, we compared hLALP70 and hLALP70v activity under a concentration range of Ca2+ and Mg2+, respectively. As substrate we used UTP for hLALP70 and CTP for hLALP70v. hLALP70 enzymatic activity showed a linear increase up to 10 mm concentrations of Ca2+ (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, hLALP70 apyrase activity was already saturated at 1 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 6 A). At 5 mm concentrations the enzyme activity was three to four times higher with Ca2+ than with Mg2+. With hLALP70v, a rapid increase of enzyme activity was observed up to 1 mm Ca2+ and Mg2+, comparable with the kinetic observed for hLALP70v (Fig. 6 B). However, total enzyme activity of hLALP70v was 2–3-fold higher than of hLALP70 for both Ca2+ and Mg2+. Enzyme activity was saturated for Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations higher than 1 mm (Fig. 6 B). Thus, hLALP70v can use either Ca2+ or Mg2+ equally, while LALP70 shows a preference for Ca2+. We conclude, that hLALP70 and hLALP70v have a different dependence on divalent cations based on structural changes induced by the presence or absence of the 8 amino acids VSFASSQQ. The human apyrase LALP70 is identical to the human Golgi UDPase (10.Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), with the exception of additional 24 bp, which are located in the central region of the LALP70 cDNA sequence (11.Biederbick A. Rose S. Elsässer H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2473-2484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison with other apyrases showed that these 24 bp encoding the amino acids VSFASSQQ are unique in the apyrase protein family (Fig.7). A mouse EST (GenBankTMaccession number AA497420) highly homologous to the human LALP70 also contained these 24 bp (Figs. 4 A and 7) with only 2 conservative nucleotide exchanges. This indicates that the 8-amino acid stretch has been conserved at least between mouse and man. Analysis of the hLALP70 gene revealed that the 24 bp are located at the end of exon 7. The 5′-junction of the 24 bp contains an alternative splice site. However, Wang and Guidotti (10.Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) performed a Southern blot analysis from which they concluded that there might be another similar gene copy in the genome in addition to their hUDPase gene. They used EcoRI or NdeI for the digestion of genomic DNA and a 400-bp fragment as a hybridization probe. They assumed that this fragment, which did not contain a EcoRI orNdeI site, was entirely located in one exon. Correlation of this 400-bp fragment to our estimated gene structure revealed that the fragment covers the entire exon 8 and parts of exon 7 and exon 9. Our results further show that there is a EcoRI and aNdeI site in the intron between exon 8 and exon 9 (Fig.3 C and sequence data from the intron), suggesting that there should be two bands Southern blot analysis after digestion of genomic DNA with one of these enzymes and subsequent hybridization with the 400-bp fragment. This is the case in the paper of Wang and Guidotti (10.Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and also in the experiment shown in Fig. 3 D where the PAC clone DNA was used. The band size and pattern seen in Fig.3 D are identical with those described by Wang and Guidotti (10.Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), where the small EcoRI band results from the twoEcoRI sites indicated in Fig. 3 A. Finally, PCR analysis of six genomic human DNAs from unrelated individuals (Fig.3 B) further confirmed that there is only one gene copy in the human genome for LALP70 and the hUDPase described by Wang and Guidotti (10.Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Taken together, with the lack of any indication for more than one gene for hLALP70 and the hUDPase, we conclude that the human Golgi UDPase is a splice variant of hLALP70 (hLALP70v). hLALP70 and hLALP70v are the first splice variants that have been described so far in the apyrase protein family. In preliminary RT-PCR experiments using primer flanking the 24-bp sequence we observed a differential expression of hLALP70 and hLALP70v in different human cell lines (data not shown). To investigate the expression pattern of mLALP and mLALPv in different tissues, we designed PCR primer flanking the 24 bp stretch in the mouse EST (Fig.4 A). Since only a few bases 5′-upstream of the 24-bp sequence were given by the EST, we completed the upper primer sequence from the adequate human sequence (Fig. 4 A). The RT-PCR results show that in all tissues analyzed, mLALP expression was superior to the expression of mLALPv, but with variations in their ratio (Fig. 4 B). However, RNAs used for RT-PCR were from whole tissue samples containing a variety of different cell types. Thus, it cannot be excluded that in some cell types, which contribute only to a small percentage to a given tissue, the mLALP/mLALPv ratio is inverted. Moreover, the turnover rates of the two proteins might be different adjusting the protein amount of mLALP and mLALPv in the cell to other levels as reflected by their relative amount of RNA. While our data clearly show that both mLALP and mLALPv are expressed ubiquitously, the detailed and cell-specific expression levels of these two proteins have to be elucidated in further experiments on RNA and protein level. In initial experiments to measure the hLALP70 enzyme activity we used hLALP70 and a hLALP70/green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein. We observed that the GFP had an influence on the substrate specificity (data not shown). Thus, in the present study we used hLALP70 and hLALP70v without any tag for the measurement of the enzyme activity. Our results indicate that hLALP70v has a broad substrate specificity with the ability of cleaving all nucleotide di- and triphosphates with the exception of adenosine di- and triphosphate. In contrast to the data published by Wang and Guidotti (10.Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), hLALP70v did not prefer UDP as optimal substrate. Rather, CTP was the preferred substrate, followed by UDP and CDP. This difference might be due to a myc tag, which was present in the construct used by Wang and Guidotti (10.Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This might have implications in the substrate specificity, comparable with what we observed for the GFP tag. Actually, Wang and Guidotti (10.Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) did not include CTP in their substrate list, and it is not evident whether they used CTP as a substrate at all. Our results depending on hLALP70v without any tag does not confirm that this enzyme is a UDPase. hLALP70 exhibited a different substrate specificity compared with hLALP70v. The preferred substrates were UTP and TTP, and all other nucleotide di- and triphosphates were not or only to a much lesser extent cleaved. This indicates that the 8 extra amino acids in LALP70 have a strong influence on the substrate specificity of this enzyme. The investigation of other apyrases also revealed a strong dependence of enzyme properties on minor sequence differences. Apyrase isoforms (NTP1 and NTP3) encoded from two different genes in Toxoplasma gondii had an amino acid sequence identity of 97% but differed markedly in their substrate binding and specificity (4.Nakaar V. Beckers C.J. Polotsky V. Joiner K.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This was attributed to two 12-amino acid-long sequences, FITGREMLASID and IVTGGGMLAAIN, which are located at the C terminus of these proteins, where they constitute the region of highest dissimilarity between the two isoforms. However, no similarity between our 8-amino acid sequence and the two 12-amino acid sequences are obvious. Furthermore, a human brain ectoapyrase was used for site-directed mutagenesis of two conserved tryptophan residues (W187A, W459A; Ref. 5.Smith T.M. Lewis C.S.A. Kirley T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5849-5857Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which are also conserved in hLALP70 (Trp227, Trp526; Ref. 11.Biederbick A. Rose S. Elsässer H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2473-2484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While the W187A mutation abrogated the enzymatic activity, a stimulation of the NTPase activity was observed in case of the W459A mutation. Other single amino acid mutations revealed similar results (6.Smith T.M. Kirley T.L. Biochim. Biophy. Acta. 1998; 1386: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Finally, in addition to the changes in substrate specificity, the hLALP70-specific motif VSFASSQQ has also an influence on the enzymatic dependence on divalent ions like Ca2+ and Mg2+. hLALP70v, which has been described as a Golgi-resident protein (10.Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), is a homolog to the yeast intracellular apyrase GDA1, also located in the Golgi apparatus. GDA1 functions as a GDPase, converting GDP to GMP, which is then transported from the Golgi lumen into the cytosol in exchange with a GDP activated sugar (9.Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Häusler A. Moremen K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Since GDP-activated sugars are essential for protein glycosylation in the Golgi compartment, GDA1 mutants exhibit less glycosylated proteins and an increased level of GDP in the Golgi cisternae (9.Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Häusler A. Moremen K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Recently, a mouse UDPase has been cloned and characterized, which is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER-UDPase; Ref. 19.Trombetta E.S. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3282-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It is thought that the ER-UDPase can unfold a similar function in the ER as GDA1 in the Golgi complex, being critical in the reutilization of UDP during reglycosylation of misfolded glycoproteins (20.Perez M. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6822-6830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Vanstapel F. Blanckaert N. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1113-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22.Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Hebert D. Simons J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). ER-UDPase, which sequence is unrelated to that of the hLALP proteins, is a soluble protein. In contrast to hLALP70v and to the ER-UDPase, hLALP70 has been located in autophagic/lysosomal vacuoles (11.Biederbick A. Rose S. Elsässer H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2473-2484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has to be elucidated by further experiments, whether hLALP70 is also active in the reutilization of NTPs/NDPs from the lysosomal/autophagic compartment, as has been proposed earlier (11.Biederbick A. Rose S. Elsässer H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2473-2484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In lysosomes only nucleoside transport systems have been described so far (23.Pisoni R.L. Thoene J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 351-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and one can assume that NTPs and NDPs trapped in a lysosomal vacuoles have to be degraded at least to NMPs, in analogy to the Golgi compartment and the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), to be transported into the cytosol. However, since the lysosomal compartment does not provide a protein glycosylation machinery, it is unlikely that the outward transport of monophosphate nucleotides or nucleosides is linked to an inward transport of NDP-activated sugars, as it has been described for the Golgi compartment (9.Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Häusler A. Moremen K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and the RER (21.Vanstapel F. Blanckaert N. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1113-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar,22.Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Hebert D. Simons J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Although most of a transiently expressed hLALP70/GFP fusion protein was colocalized with lamp1-positive vacuoles, a further association with the Golgi apparatus and the ER could not be ruled out (11.Biederbick A. Rose S. Elsässer H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2473-2484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Golgi localization of hLALP70v has been shown only indirectly (10.Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and it remains to be shown that this splice variant is exclusively located in this compartment or might also occur in lysosomes. Thus, the question remains open whether the amino acid motif VSFASSQQ also contains sorting information.

However, the occurrence of hyperacute rejection whereby vascular endothelial cells are destroyed by an antibody- and complement-dependent mechanism, remains an obstacle to xenotransplantation (1.Auchincloss H.J.

Removal of the α-1,3-galactosyltransferase gene by gene targeting is a straightforward method but has so far been successful only in mice (7.Thall A.D. Maly P. Lowe J.B. J. Biol.

Furthermore, transgenic pigs with α-1,2-fucosyltransferase have been produced and have been reported to be reduced in the α-galactosyl antigen expression (9.Sandrin M.S. Fodor W.L. Mouhtouris E.

Expression of the dominant negative form of α-1,3-galactosyltransferase has also been tried (2.Kobayashi T. Cooper D.K.C. Subcell. Biochem. 1999; 32: 229-257PubMed Google Scholar). However, by none of the methods has production of pig organs virtually devoid of the α-galactosyl antigen been achieved so far (2.Kobayashi T. Cooper D.K.C. Subcell. Biochem. 1999; 32: 229-257PubMed Google Scholar). As an alternative approach, α-galactosidase from the coffee bean was used to remove the α-galactosyl antigen from cultured pig endothelial cells. The enzyme-treated cells became resistant to complement-dependent lysis by human sera (15.LaVecchio J.A. Dunne A.D. Edge A.S.B. Transplantation. 1995; 60: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 16.Watier H. Guillaumin J.M. Piller F. Lacord M. Thibault G. Lebranchu Y. Monsigny M. Bardos P. Transplantation. 1996; 62: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although very recently the α-galactosidase has been applied to remove the α-galactosyl antigen from isolated femoral veins from the pig (17.Luo Y. Wen J. Luo C. Cummings R.D. Cooper D.K.C. Xenotransplantation. 1999; 6: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), this enzyme has not been applied to treat pig organs, probably because the acidic optimum pH of the enzyme makes it necessary to use enormous amounts of the enzyme. Endo-β-galactosidase C, an endo-β-galactosidase found in the culture fluid of Clostridium perfringens, cleaves the Galβ1–4GlcNAc linkage in the Galα1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc structure, releasing Galα1–3Gal disaccharide (18.Fushuku N. Muramatsu H. Uezono M.M. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10086-10092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Due to its neutral optimum pH (18.Fushuku N. Muramatsu H. Uezono M.M. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10086-10092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the enzyme is expected to be valuable as an aid for xenotransplantation. As reported here, we cloned the gene for this enzyme, produced the recombinant enzyme, and applied it to digest out the α-galactosyl antigen from pig blood vessels in the kidney. Endo-β-galactosidase C was purified from culture fluid ofC. perfringens as described previously (18.Fushuku N. Muramatsu H. Uezono M.M. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10086-10092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme preparation obtained from 18 liters of culture medium was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using an 8% gel according to Laemmli (19.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). After light staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, bands were excised, and proteins in the gel were digested with trypsin as described by Rosenfeld et al. (20.Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). The resulting peptides were separated on a reverse phase column (Monitor C 18, 1 × 150 mm) with a linear gradient of acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 50 μl/min using a MAGIC 2002 (Michrom Bio Resources, Inc.). Amino acid sequences of the resulting peptides were determined with a PE Applied Biosystems protein sequencer model 494A. PCR1 was performed using the sense primer 5′-GAYGARAAYGARTAYGT-3′ (based on the amino acid sequence of peptide I) and antisense primer 5′-TCYTCRTTNARRTCNCCRTC-3′ (based on the amino acid sequence of peptide IV) and genomic DNA of the bacteria as the template, after denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, with 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. The PCR product, which corresponded to a partial genomic sequence of the enzyme gene, was subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega). The 5′- and 3′-ends of the DNA were extended byHindIII cassette (Takara), using 5′-TGATACTTGTGGTACAGTAGAATGCCCACT-3′, 5′-ATGTTTACTATTAGTAGTAGGTATTAAGCC-3′, 5′-AGATGGTATGCATACTAGACCTATGTTCCC-3′, and 5′-AAGTTGGAGATGGTTGGGTTGGTGATGTTG-3′ as primers. Cassette PCR was performed with 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Full-length DNA was obtained by PCR using two primers, 5′-GCAGCCGAATTCATGAAATTTTTCTCGAAATTCAAAAAGGTA-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGCTCGAGTTATTTATTTTGTAAAAAAGTTACTTTAGC-3′, which were designed according to the information of the 5′- and 3′- DNA sequences obtained by cassette PCR with genomic DNA as a template. PCR was performed after denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min and 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method (21.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar), using an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer. The sequence of the 5′-side was confirmed by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends using terminal transferase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals); NotI-(dT)18 primer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); primers 5′-TGACTTGGTACTTCAGACTT-3′, 5′-TGATACTTGTGGTACAGTAGAATGCCCACT-3′, and 5′-ATGTTTACTATTAGTAGTAGGTATTAAGCC-3′); and total RNA from C. perfringens as a template. The enzymatic reaction was performed in 10 μl of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 20 μg of Galα1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc (Calbiochem). After 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of ethanol, and after desalting with Dowex 50W × 2 H+ form and 1 × 2 acetate form, one-tenth of the hydrolysate was spotted to a Silica Gel 60 TLC plate (Merck). The plate was developed in n-propyl alcohol/ethyl acetate/H2O (7:2:1), and sugar spots were revealed by spraying with orcinol-H2SO4 reagent and heating (22.Svennerholm L. J. Neurochem. 1956; 1: 42-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The amounts of released products were determined using a densitometer, Gel Doc 1000 (Bio-Rad). Under these assay conditions, enzymatic activity was proportional to the amount of the enzyme and reaction time until 40% of the substrate was hydrolyzed. One unit of the enzymatic activity was defined as the amount of the enzyme required to hydrolyze 1 μmol of the substrate per min. Mass spectrometry was performed using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, API 300 (Perkin-Elmer) equipped with an electrospray ion source. The sample was directly infused into the electrospray ion source at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/h. The spray was obtained by a potential difference of 4.8 kV. The amount of protein in the purified enzyme was determined using a Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce), with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Possible contamination of other glycosidases was determined by incubating respective p-nitrophenyl glycosides in 0.2 ml of reaction mixture with 29.4 μg of the purified enzyme at 37 °C for 1 h at pH 7.0 (50 mm phosphate buffer) and also at pH 6.0 (50 mm citrate phosphate buffer). Possible contamination of proteases was determined as described previously (23.Arakawa M. Ogata S. Muramatsu T. Kobata A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1974; 75: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) also at pH 7.0 and 6.0 under the assay conditions described above. The coding sequence of the enzyme was ligated into the expression vector pFLAG-Shift12 (Sigma), which produces a gene product that can be secreted into the periplasm. The recombinant gene was transformed into Escherichia coli BL-21 cells, which were cultured at 37 °C in 2 liters of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml of ampicillin and 0.4% of glucose and were induced to express the enzyme by adding 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the culture medium. After 30 min, the bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min and washed with 300 ml of Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, twice and then 300 ml of 0.5 m sucrose, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA at room temperature. The cells collected by centrifugation were immediately suspended in 250 ml of ice-cold distilled water to release the enzyme from the periplasm. The supernatant containing the released enzyme was collected by centrifugation at 3500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and purified by chromatography on columns of Sephadex G-200 (2.7 × 100 cm) and DEAE-Sephadex A-25 (1.0 × 10 cm) as described previously (18.Fushuku N. Muramatsu H. Uezono M.M. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10086-10092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified fraction contained about 700 μg of protein. When large amounts of the enzyme were required, this purification procedure was repeated. Pig erythrocytes were collected by centrifugation (1000 ×g) from citric acid-treated blood and washed twice with PBS(−) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (PBS/BSA). Then they were incubated with 3 mg/ml dimethyl suberimidate dihydrochloride in 0.1m Na2CO3 containing 0.15m NaCl and 0.1 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 20 min to prevent agglutination. Erythrocytes were washed with PBS/BSA twice and suspended in PBS/BSA to make a 1% suspension. Aliquots of 50 μl of the erythrocyte suspension thus prepared were centrifuged at 1000 × g, and the precipitated erythrocytes were suspended in 50 μl of PBS/BSA to which 20 milliunits of recombinant endo-β-galactosidase C in 4 μl of PBS was added, and the reaction was continued at 37 °C for 30 min. Pig aortic endothelial cells were isolated from a pig as described previously (16.Watier H. Guillaumin J.M. Piller F. Lacord M. Thibault G. Lebranchu Y. Monsigny M. Bardos P. Transplantation. 1996; 62: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested with trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.) and washed twice with PBS/BSA and resuspended in PBS/BSA. Recombinant endo-β-galactosidase C (70 milliunits in 7 μl of PBS) was added to the aortic endothelial cells (2×105cells/50 μl), and the reaction was continued at 37 °C for 1 h. After the enzymatic reaction, erythrocytes or endothelial cells were washed twice with PBS/BSA and reacted with either FITC-labeledGriffonia simplicifolia isolectin-IB4(GS-IB4) or human sera. In the former case, cells were suspended in 50 μl of PBS/BSA containing 1 μg of FITC-GS-IB4 (Sigma) and kept on ice for 30 min. In the latter case, the washed cells were incubated with 100 μl of normal human sera (1:1 diluted by PBS/BSA) pooled from 50 healthy volunteers. After a 30-min incubation on ice, the cells were washed twice with PBS/BSA and then incubated with 100 μl of FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgG, IgM, or IgA (Dako), each diluted 1:20 with PBS/BSA, on ice for 30 min. FITC-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-human IgG1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4 (Sigma) was also used. Then the stained erythrocytes or endothelial cells were washed twice with PBS/BSA, suspended in 0.5 ml of PBS/BSA, and analyzed using a FACS (FACS Calibur, Becton Dickinson). Pig aortic endothelial cells were plated at 1 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well culture plate 1 day prior to the assay. After washing with PBS(−), the cells were incubated with 50 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 70 milliunits of recombinant endo-β-galactosidase C at 37 °C for 2 h. The control cells were incubated without the enzyme. The cells were washed twice and incubated with 50 μl of 25 or 50% normal human sera diluted with PBS(−) at 37 °C for 1 h. The human sera were pooled from 10 healthy volunteers. After incubation, the viability of the cells was determined by an assay using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma) as described by Nagasaka et al. (24.Nagasaka T. Kobayashi T. Muramatsu H. Fujimoto H. Matsuo I. Ajisaka K. Kadomatsu K. Hayashi S. Yokoyama I. Hayakawa A. Muramatsu T. Takagi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The absorbance of each well was measured by an automatic plate reader (EAR340; SLT-Labinstruments, Austria) at 540 nm, and the values were referred to as “cell viability in the presence of complement.” In each assay, “cell viability in the absence of complement” was determined using the sera treated at 56 °C for 30 min to inactivate complement. Complement-mediated cytotoxicity was calculated from the following formula: percentage cytotoxicity = ((cell viability in the absence of complement − cell viability in the presence of complement)/cell viability in the absence of complement) × 100. Experiments were performed in triplicates. The kidneys were isolated from Landrace/Yorkshire cross-bred female pigs (Oguri Chikusan, Japan), weighing 10–12 kg, by standard surgical methods after perfusion with cold saline and University of Wisconsin solution (25.Belzer F.O. Southard J.H. Transplantation. 1988; 45: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). The right kidney was perfused ex vivo by gravity flow (1 ×g) with 100 ml of cold University of Wisconsin solution containing 45.1 units of endo-β-galactosidase C, and the solution was recirculated twice. The left kidney was perfused without the enzyme. Both kidneys were preserved in the perfusate at 4 °C for 4 h. Biopsies were performed immediately before and 1 and 4 h after perfusion with or without endo-β-galactosidase C. Then the kidneys were perfused twice with 100 ml of freshly frozen human plasma obtained from three healthy volunteers. For histological studies, biopsied samples were fixed with formalin and stained with hematoxylin-eosin and periodic acid-Schiff. The samples were also immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stained with FITC-GS-IB4. The perfused human plasma was collected, and remaining immunoglobulin levels were analyzed by FACS using pig erythrocytes as described above. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of an endo-β-galactosidase C preparation revealed several protein bands, among which a 50-kDa major band and a 95-kDa band (Fig.1 A) co-migrated with the enzyme activity on DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column chromatography. Sequence analysis of tryptic peptides indicated that the 50-kDa band wasC. perfringolysin O protein (26.Shimizu T. Okabe A. Minami J. Hayashi H. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 137-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while the 95-kDa band was a novel protein. Based on the sequences of four tryptic peptides derived from the 95-kDa band (Fig. 2), PCR primers were designed, and PCR using genomic DNA of C. perfringens as a template yielded a DNA of 1946 base pairs. Cassette PCR was performed to obtain the 5′ and 3′ sequences. The composite DNA encoded an open reading frame of 2535 bp corresponding to a protein of 845 amino acids (Fig.2). Upstream from the putative translational initiation site, there was a typical Shine-Dalgarno sequence, AGGAGG (nucleotides 231–236) (27.Shine J. Dalgarno L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (2581) Google Scholar). The deduced protein sequence contained all of the peptide sequence identified in the 95-kDa protein (Fig. 2). In all but one case, amino acids next to the N terminus of the identified peptides were either arginine or lysine, which was consistent with the fact that the peptides were derived by trypsin digestion. In one case (peptide I, Fig. 2), the proximal amino acid was alanine. We confirmed the correctness of the sequence by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Therefore, we inferred that peptide I of the 95-kDa protein was derived from the N-terminal portion of the 95-kDa protein, which was expected to be generated by proteolytic processing of the nascent protein. This was confirmed by N-terminal sequence analysis; the purified recombinant enzyme described in the following section had the N-terminal sequence DENEYVL, which is the N-terminal sequence of peptide I. Furthermore, the upstream peptide (amino acids 1–34, Fig. 2) had a cluster of hydrophobic amino acids typically found in a signal sequence (28.Von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2315-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This putative signal sequence might be involved in secretion of the enzyme. Endo-β-galactosidase from Flavobacterium keratolyticus is known to have a signal sequence (29.Leng L. Zhu A. Zhang Z. Hurst R. Goldstein J. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 222: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the protein devoid of the putative signal sequence was 93 kDa and was in good agreement with the observed molecular mass of the protein, 95 kDa. A distinct region in the C-terminal half of the enzyme showed protein sequence homology to endo-β-galactosidase purified from F. keratolyticus (29.Leng L. Zhu A. Zhang Z. Hurst R. Goldstein J. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 222: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and β-1,3-glucanases purified from various sources (30.Spilliaert R. Hreggvidsson G.O. Kristjansson J.K. Eggertsson G. Palsdottir A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31.Yahata N. Watanabe T. Nakamura Y. Yamamoto Y. Kamimiya S. Tanaka H. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 86: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The enzyme was expressed in E. coli as a periplasmic enzyme under the control of the ompA gene. The recombinant enzyme was purified by Sephadex G-200 and DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column chromatography. A major band with apparent molecular mass of 95 kDa and a closely related minor band of 97 kDa were found in the purified preparation (Fig. 1 B). As mentioned above, the major band corresponded to the protein devoid of the putative signal sequence. From the molecular mass difference, the minor band appeared to correspond to a nascent protein with a signal sequence. The recombinant enzyme hydrolyzed a pentasaccharide, Galα1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc, releasing two oligosaccharides, which could be separated by TLC (Fig.4). The nature of the oligosaccharides was identified by electrospray mass spectrometry. The pentasaccharide before digestion gave m/z 892.2, which corresponded to the calculated mass of the oligosaccharide plus 23, presumably due to the addition of a Na+ ion (Fig.5 A). After enzymatic digestion, two prominent peaks appeared at m/z568.1 and m/z 365.0 (Fig. 5 B). The former corresponded to the mass of GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc plus Na+, and the latter to that of Galα1–3Gal plus Na+. These observations established that the cloned enzyme was endo-β-galactosidase C, which hydrolyzes Galβ1–4GlcNAc linkage and releases Galα1–3Gal disaccharide. The specific activity of the enzyme was 10.5 units/mg protein, indicating the potent activity of the enzyme. The recombinant enzyme was free from proteases, α-galactosidase, β-galactosidase, and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. The recombinant enzyme had a pH optimum of 7.0–8.0 as reported for the enzyme from culture fluid ofC. perfringens (18.Fushuku N. Muramatsu H. Uezono M.M. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10086-10092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, at 4 °C the enzyme exhibited 40% of the activity observed at 37 °C.Figure 5Identification of the products of endo-β-galactosidase C digestion by electrospray mass spectrometry.Galα1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc (20 μg) was hydrolyzed with 4 milliunits of the enzyme at 37 °C for 30 min in 10 μl of 30 mm NaCl. After stopping the reaction with 20 μl of ethanol, the reaction mixture was mixed with 1.5 volumes of 83% acetonitrile containing 17 mm ammonium acetate. Mass spectrometry was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, before enzymatic digestion. Ethanol was added before mixing the enzyme and the substrate. B, after enzymatic digestion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After treatment with recombinant endo-β-galactosidase C, more than 99% of the α-galactosyl epitope, which was recognized by FITC-GS-IB4, was removed from pig erythrocytes (Fig. 6 A). Similarly, 98% of the α-galactosyl epitope could be enzymatically removed from pig aortic endothelial cells (Fig. 6 B). Binding of IgM to the treated erythrocytes was reduced to 25% of that in untreated cells (Fig. 6 A); in endothelial cells, the reduction was to less than 23% (Fig. 6 B). Binding of IgA and IgG in human sera was also reduced to 21 and 33%, respectively, in the case of enzymatically treated endothelial cells (Fig.6 B), while less reduction was observed in treated erythrocytes for IgG (Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, using antibodies against human IgG subclasses, we found that binding to IgG1, IgG2, or IgG3 was markedly reduced in the treated cells (Fig. 6, C and D), while no changes in binding to IgG4 were detected. The cells treated with endo-β-galactosidase C became much less susceptible to complement-mediated cytotoxicity caused by human sera (Fig. 7).Figure 7Effects of endo-β-galactosidase C treatment on susceptibility to complement-mediated cytotoxicity by human sera.Pig aortic endothelial cells with or without endo-β-galactosidase C treatment were incubated with 25 or 50% human sera in the presence or absence of complement. Cell viability was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, and complement-mediated cytotoxicity was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Gray bars, without enzymatic treatment; black bars, with enzymatic treatment.

The pig kidney was perfused with the enzyme solution, and the reaction was performed at 4 °C, since lower temperature is preferable for preservation of the tissue, and endo-β-galactosidase C effectively worked even at low temperature. Staining with FITC-GS-IB4 verified that the α-galactosyl epitope facing the lumen of the blood vessels was virtually removed by the enzymatic treatment at 4 °C for 4 h (Fig. 8). No histological change was observed in the enzymatically treated kidneys. With this powerful method of removing α-galactosyl epitopes in situ, we investigated whether binding of immunoglobulins in human plasma was decreased in enzymatically treated blood vessels as in the case of aortic endothelial cells or erythrocytes. Although quantitative analysis is possible for dissociated cells using FACS, direct measurement of bound immunoglobulins is not easy in intact blood vessels. Therefore, we measured the decrease in binding activity of immunoglobulins to pig erythrocytes after perfusion into the kidney. To avoid the effects of variation between pigs, we used two kidneys from the same animal; one kidney was treated with endo-β-galactosidase C, and the other was treated with the medium without the enzyme. In three independent experiments, enzymatically treated kidneys bound significantly lower amounts of IgM than the kidney treated only with the medium. On the average, 31% of binding activity of IgM remained in human plasma after perfusion into the pig kidney without the enzyme treatment (Fig. 9). However, 64% of the binding remained after perfusion into the kidney with the enzyme treatment (Fig. 9). This difference was statistically significant. The result demonstrated that large amounts of IgM-binding antigenic epitope were eliminated after endo-β-galactosidase C digestion. However, the ability to absorb IgG and IgA antibodies was less reduced by enzymatic treatment, and the differences were not statistically significant (Fig.9). Although the principal aim of the present investigation was to reduce α-galactosyl xenoantigenic determinants in blood vesselsin situ using an enzyme, the results presented here raised other interesting points. First, the protein sequence of endo-β-galactosidase C shares some amino acids in the more C-terminally located region with endo-β-galactosidase from F. keratolyticus (29.Leng L. Zhu A. Zhang Z. Hurst R. Goldstein J. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 222: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and β-1,3-glucanases (30.Spilliaert R. Hreggvidsson G.O. Kristjansson J.K. Eggertsson G. Palsdottir A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31.Yahata N. Watanabe T. Nakamura Y. Yamamoto Y. Kamimiya S. Tanaka H. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 86: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although theFlavobacterium endo-β-galactosidase and β-1,3-glucanases act on polysaccharides to release oligosaccharides of various sizes, endo-β-galactosidase C acts on carbohydrate moieties of glycoproteins and glycolipids and releases only a disaccharide (18.Fushuku N. Muramatsu H. Uezono M.M. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10086-10092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the similarity in structure of these enzymes suggested that there are similarities in the mechanisms of action between endo-β-galactosidase C and the other endoglycosidases mentioned above. Second, endo-β-galactosidase C, at the partially purified stage, has been proved useful for the structural analysis of glycoconjugates such as poly-N-acetyllactosamine in Ehrlich carcinoma cells (32.Kamada Y. Muramatsu H. Kawata M. Takamizawa H. Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. 1988; 104: 738-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and teratocarcinoma glycopeptides (33.Kamada Y. Muramatsu H. Muramatsu T. Kawata M. Sekiya S. Takamizawa H. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 176: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The newly available recombinant enzyme is of a high order of purity and lacks proteases and is expected to be broadly applicable in studies of various glycoconjugates because of the widespread occurrence of the Galα1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc structure. The most interesting finding of this study was that after perfusion with recombinant endo-β-galactosidase C, the pig vascular endothelial cells in the kidney became virtually devoid of the α-galactosyl antigen with concomitant loss of a significant portion of the IgM-binding xenoantigen, which is known to be primarily responsible for hyperacute rejection in pig to primate transplantation (34.Dalmasso A.P. Vercellotti G.M. Fischel R.J. Bolman R.M. Bach F.H. Platt J.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 140: 1157-1166PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant enzyme could act at physiological pH and even at a low temperature. Thus, the enzyme is expected to be a valuable aid in xenotransplantation. It will be especially helpful in removing residual α-galactosyl antigen in transgenic pigs, which express transgenes of appropriate glycosyltransferases and have reduced α-galactosyl antigen levels. The reappearance of the antigenic activity after the endoglycosidase digestion may be prevented if the enzyme is present in the bloodstream. Production of transgenic pigs with the endo-β-galactosidase C gene should also be considered. Transfection of the enzyme gene mediated by liposome or virus vector might be also helpful. In these gene manipulation experiments, endo-β-galactosidase C is more suitable than α-galactosidase, because levels of protein expression required will be less in case of the endoglycosidase than α-galactosidase. For nearly complete removal of the α-galactosyl antigen from isolated pig blood vessels, 20 units/ml (2 mg/ml) of α-galactosidase is required (17.Luo Y. Wen J. Luo C. Cummings R.D. Cooper D.K.C. Xenotransplantation. 1999; 6: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), while 0.45 units/ml (0.043 mg/ml) of endo-β-galactosidase C was sufficient for the removal from blood vessels in the kidney. Finally, it might be appropriate to remind that xenografts initially protected from hyperacute rejection for a certain period might become resistant to rejection even in the presence of xenoantibodies, by a mechanism called accommodation (35.Bach F.H. Turman M.A. Vercellotti G.M. Platt J.L. Dalmasso A.P. Transplant. Proc. 1991; 23: 205-207PubMed Google Scholar). We thank Drs. T. Tokoro and D.

We have examined the constituents of latex from Lactuca sativa (lettuce) cv. Diana. The major components were shown to be novel 15-oxalyl and 8-sulfate conjugates of the guaianolide sesquiterpene lactones, lactucin, deoxylactucin, and lactucopicrin. The oxalates were unstable, reverting to the parent sesquiterpene lactone on hydrolysis. Oxalyl derivatives have been reported rarely from natural sources. The sulfates were stable and are the first reported sesquiterpene sulfates from plants. Unusual tannins based on 4-hydroxyphenylacetyl conjugates of glucose were also identified. Significant qualitative and quantitative variation was found in sesquiterpene lactone profiles in different lettuce varieties and in other Lactuca spp. The proportions of each conjugate in latex also changed depending on the stage of plant development. A similar profile was found in chicory, in which oxalyl conjugates were identified, but the 8-sulfate conjugates were notably absent. The presence of the constitutive sesquiterpene lactones was not correlated with resistance to pathogens but may have a significant bearing on the molecular basis of the bitter taste of lettuce and related species. The induced sesquiterpene lactone phytoalexin, lettucenin A, was found in the Lactuca spp. but not in chicory."
https://openalex.org/W1993659282,"The carboxyl-terminal domains of secretin family peptides have been shown to contain key determinants for high affinity binding to their receptors. In this work, we have examined the interaction between carboxyl-terminal residues within secretin and the prototypic secretin receptor.

Here, we further refined the site of labeling with the p-benzoyl-phenylalanine (Bpa22) probe to receptor residue Leu17 using progressive cleavage of wild type and mutant secretin receptors (V13M and V16M) and sequence analysis. We also developed a new probe incorporating a photolabile Bpa at position 26 of secretin, closer to its carboxyl terminus. This analogue was also a potent agonist (EC50 = 72 ± 6 pm) and bound to the secretin receptor specifically and with high affinity (K i = 10.3 ± 2.4 nm).

Guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors represent the largest group of plasma membrane receptors and include many potentially important targets for therapeutic agents, making this superfamily an ideal focus for these efforts. This superfamily includes receptor families that share sequence homologies and structural similarities of their natural ligands. Among these is the recently described class II family that includes receptors for secretin, calcitonin, parathyroid hormone, glucagon, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (3Segre G.V. Goldring S.R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 4: 309-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 4Ulrich C.D. Holtmann M.H. Miller L.J. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 382-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The natural agonist ligands of these receptors have helical domains in both carboxyl-terminal and amino-terminal regions (5Bodanszky M. Bodanszky A. Peptides ( Elmsford ). 1986; 7 Suppl. 1: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 6Blankenfeldt W. Nokihara K. Naruse S. Lessel U. Schomburg D. Wray V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5955-5962Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and have binding determinants that are spread throughout their entire length (3Segre G.V. Goldring S.R. Trends Endocrinol.

The theme is emerging that amino-terminal regions of these peptides contain key determinants for receptor selectivity, whereas carboxyl-terminal regions contain determinants for high affinity binding (8Wulff B. Knudsen S.M. Adelhorst K. Fahrenkrug J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 9Holtmann M.H. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14394-14398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Of note, the carboxyl-terminal regions of some of the members of this family may even be interchanged while maintaining high affinity binding (9Holtmann M.H. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14394-14398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This feature supports the likely general relevance of the observations in the current work to the entire class II family. We recently used affinity labeling to demonstrate spatial approximation between a photolabile residue within the carboxyl-terminal half of secretin (position 22) and a 30-residue segment at the distal amino terminus of its prototypic secretin receptor (1Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Of interest, the amino-terminal tail of the class II G protein-coupled receptor family has remarkable structural features and major functional importance (3Segre G.V. Goldring S.R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 4: 309-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar,4Ulrich C.D. Holtmann M.H. Miller L.J. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 382-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This receptor domain is moderately large, containing greater than 110 residues, with six conserved Cys residues and key disulfide bonds (10Vilardaga J.P. Di Paolo E. Bialek C. De Neef P. Waelbroeck M. Bollen A. Robberecht P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Chemical reduction and treatment with sulfhydryl-reactive compounds have had substantial negative impact on these receptors (10Vilardaga J.P. Di Paolo E. Bialek C. De Neef P. Waelbroeck M. Bollen A. Robberecht P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11Robberecht P. Waelbroeck M. Camus J.C. De Neef P. Christophe J. Biochim. Biophys.

Truncation, site-directed mutagenesis, and chimeric receptor studies have also supported the critical role of this domain in the function of this receptor family (9Holtmann M.H. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14394-14398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 13Holtmann M.H. Ganguli S. Hadac E.M. Dolu V. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14944-14949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have extended our understanding of the siting of secretin residue 22 when bound to its receptor by defining a receptor residue adjacent to it. We have also established spatial approximation between another residue closer to the carboxyl terminus of secretin (in position 26 of this 27-residue peptide) and a residue within this receptor. Both of these efforts relied on photolabile ligand probes that bound to the secretin receptor specifically with high affinity and represented full agonists. These efforts were also dependent on a series of receptor site mutants that bound ligand and signaled like wild type receptors but that could be chemically cleaved close to the sites of covalent attachment of the radiolabeled probe for the application of Edman degradation sequencing to identify the labeled residue. These two new pairs of residue-residue approximation should contribute substantially to our understanding of the natural ligand-binding site of the secretin receptor and will likely have relevance for other members of this family. We postulate the existence of a common platform for natural ligand binding that is present within the amino-terminal tail of these receptors. With our recent insight of approximation between an amino-terminal residue (position 6) of secretin and the same domain of the secretin receptor (2Dong M. Wang Y. Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Holicky E.L. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19161-19167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), it is possible that such a platform could provide most of the molecular determinants for natural agonist ligand binding. Cyanogen bromide (CNBr) and the solid phase oxidant, N-chloro-benzenesulfonamide (IODO-BEADS), were from Pierce. Wheat germ agglutinin-agarose was from EY Laboratories, Inc. (San Mateo, CA).

The photolabile affinity labeling probes, [Tyr10,Bpa22]rat secretin-27 (Bpa22 probe) and [Tyr10,Bpa26]rat secretin-27 (Bpa26 probe), were synthesized by manual solid phase techniques and purified to homogeneity by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using methods analogous to those that we previously reported (15Powers S.P.

Development of new secretin receptor mutants that incorporated additional sites for CNBr cleavage in key positions was necessary for the current work. These represented Ala41 to Met (A41M) and Val13 to Met (V13M) receptor mutants that were prepared by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (17Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R.

A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52605) Google Scholar). A clonal cell line stably expressing the A41M receptor mutant was established by lipofection of CHO-K1 cells, with sequential G418 selection, fluorescent cell sorting, and limiting dilution, as we previously reported (1Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment on Costar tissue culture plasticware in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal clone-2 (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT). Cells were passaged twice a week and lifted mechanically before use. The V13M mutant receptor construct was expressed transiently on COS-7 cells (American Type Cell Collection, Manassas, VA) after transfection using a modification of the DEAE-dextran method (13Holtmann M.H. Ganguli S. Hadac E.M. Dolu V. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14944-14949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These cells were harvested mechanically 72 h after transfection. The agonist activity of [Tyr10,Bpa26]rat secretin-27 was studied using an assay for stimulation of cAMP in CHO-SecR cells that utilized a competition-binding assay with reagents from Diagnostic Products Corp. (Los Angeles, CA). Cells were stimulated with this secretin analogue for 30 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by adding ice-cold perchloric acid. After adjusting the pH to 6 with KHCO3, cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min, and supernatants were introduced into the assay as described previously (19Ganguli S.C. Park C.G. Holtmann M.H. Hadac E.M. Kenakin T.P. Miller L.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 593-598PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting. This assay was also used to functionally characterize the new receptor mutants. Cell membranes were prepared from secretin receptor-bearing cells using methods we previously reported (20Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For binding characterization, membranes (5–10 μg) were incubated with a constant amount of radioligand,125I-[Tyr10]rat secretin-27 (3–5 pm), in the presence of increasing concentrations of non-radiolabeled secretin analogue (0–1 μm) for 1 h at room temperature in Krebs-Ringers/HEPES medium (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 104 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm KH2PO4, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Bound and free radioligands were separated using a Skatron cell harvester (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with glass fiber filter mats that had been soaked in 0.3% Polybrene for 1 h, and bound radioactivity was quantified in a gamma-spectrometer. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm secretin and represented less than 20% of total bound radioactivity. For covalent labeling studies, membranes from receptor-bearing cells or control non-receptor-bearing parental CHO-K1 cells were incubated with125I-[Tyr10,Bpa26]rat secretin-27 or 125I-[Tyr10,Bpa22]rat secretin-27 in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of non-radioactive secretin (0–1 μm) prior to photolysis. This was performed for 30 min at 4 °C in a Rayonet photochemical reactor (Southern New England Ultraviolet, Hamden, CT) equipped with 3500-Å lamps. Membranes were solubilized in SDS sample buffer, and proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels by electrophoresis under the conditions of Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206999) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled bands were detected by autoradiography. CNBr and endoproteinase Lys-C were used separately and in sequence to cleave the labeled secretin receptor and its fragments following procedures previously described (1Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Affinity labeled secretin receptor was typically resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and radiolabeled products of digestion were resolved on 10% NuPAGE gels using MES running buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After electrophoresis, labeled bands were identified by exposure to x-ray film with intensifying screens at −80 °C. Aliquots of affinity labeled secretin receptor and relevant receptor fragments were deglycosylated by treatment for 18 h at 37 °C with 2 units of endoglycosidase F in buffer containing 0.1m NaH2PO4, pH 6.1, 50 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1% (v/v) 2-mecaptoethanol. Products were resolved by electrophoresis, as described above. In some cases, products of endoglycosidase F treatment were acetone-precipitated for further enzymatic cleavage (2Dong M. Wang Y.

Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Identifications of the labeled receptor fragments were further confirmed by modifications of electrophoretic migration of bands after additional mutagenesis to incorporate new specific sites of cleavage or by use of multiple independent cleavage methods. After achieving definitive identification of the receptor fragment that was labeled with a distinct probe, its site of attachment was determined using radiochemical Edman degradation sequencing, as we previously reported (2Dong M. Wang Y. Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Holicky E.L. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19161-19167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Ji Z.

For this, purified radiolabeled receptor fragments were covalently coupled through their Cys residues toN-(2-aminoethyl-1)-3-aminopropyl glass beads (Sigma) using maleimidobenzoyl succinimide. This was followed by repetitive cycles of manual Edman degradation with quantitation of radioactivity released in each cycle (22Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Ji Z. Holicky E.L. Henne R. Lybrand T. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12988-12993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Biosynthetic labeling of the secretin receptor was achieved by culturing the cell line expressing the epitope-tagged receptor construct (SecR-HA37) in 90% leucine-free RPMI medium containing 5% Fetal Clone-2 in the presence or absence of 0.5 mCi of [3,4,5-3H]l-leucine (150 Ci/mmol) for 8 h, followed by an additional 15 h in complete medium. Membranes were prepared from the cells, as described above. The non-radioactive membranes were photoaffinity labeled with [125I-Tyr10,Bpa26]secretin-27, as described above. The radioactive biosynthetically labeled membranes were photoaffinity labeled in an analogous manner using non-radioactive [Tyr10,Bpa26]secretin-27. The relevant segment of the secretin receptor from each set of membranes was purified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, deglycosylation with endoglycosidase F, cleavage with endoproteinase Lys-C, and immunoaffinity purification using anti-HA affinity matrix (3F10). Excess HA peptide (1 mg/ml) was used to elute the immunoadsorbed peptides that were then attached to glass beads through Cys residues and were sequenced by manual Edman degradation, as described above. The radioactivity eluted in each cycle was quantified by counting the relevant reaction in a gamma-spectrometer for 125I or in a liquid scintillation counter for 3H. Observations were repeated at least three times in independent experiments and are expressed as the means ± S.E. Binding curves were analyzed and plotted using the nonlinear regression analysis in Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Binding kinetics were determined by analysis with the LIGAND program of Munson and Rodbard (23Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar). The Bpa26 analogue of secretin contains a Tyr residue at position 10 for radioiodination and a photolabile Bpa residue at position 26 for covalent labeling of its receptor. This analogue was synthesized by manual solid phase techniques, purified by reversed phase HPLC, and had its identity established by mass spectrometry. It was shown to represent a full agonist acting at the secretin receptor (Fig. 1). It stimulated a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular cAMP accumulation in secretin receptor-bearing CHO-SecR cells (cAMP: basal, 3.2 ± 0.6 pmol/million cells; maximal, 190 ± 17 pmol/million cells). The potency (EC50 = 72 ± 6 pm) and efficacy of this peptide analogue were similar to these characteristics of natural secretin (EC50 = 47 ± 7 pm). This analogue also bound to the secretin receptor on these cells saturably (B max = 100 pmol/mg protein) and with high affinity (K i = 10.3 ± 2.4 nm), similar to natural secretin (K i = 4.9 ± 0.9 nm). As expected for a secretin receptor, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide had lower affinity and was less effective in competing for this binding (IC50 >1 μm). The Bpa26 analogue covalently labeled the secretin receptor saturably, specifically, and with high affinity (IC50 = 4.1 ± 1.8 nm) (Fig.2). Consistent with our previous work, the labeled receptor band migrated at M r = 70,000 and shifted to M r = 42,000 after deglycosylation with endoglycosidase F (2Dong M. Wang Y. Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Holicky E.L. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19161-19167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This band was not present in samples prepared from non-receptor-bearing parental CHO-K1 cell membranes. The labeled band from CHO-SecR cells has been purified to homogeneity and partially sequenced to document its identity as the secretin receptor (data not shown). CNBr cleavage was used to gain initial insight into the domain of labeling the secretin receptor (Fig.3). Digestion of the intact receptor yielded a labeled M r = 19,000 band that shifted to M r = 10,000 after deglycosylation. This pattern of migration is identical to that we reported for labeling this receptor with both the Bpa22 and Bpa6 probes (1Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 2Dong M. Wang Y. Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Holicky E.L. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19161-19167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Considering the mass of the Bpa26 probe (3, 341 Da) and this evidence of glycosylation of the labeled peptide, the first and third CNBr fragments of the secretin receptor are the best candidates to fit these data. We have previously established the sites of glycosylation of the secretin receptor that are utilized (24Pang R.T.K. Ng S.S.M. Cheng C.H.K. Holtmann M.H. Miller L.J. Chow B.K.C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5102-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We definitively identified the domain of this receptor that was labeled by using specific immunoprecipitation of fragments of two distinct secretin receptor constructs incorporating HA epitope tags that were incorporated within each of the candidate domains. These receptor constructs have previously been fully characterized to establish their expression on the cell surface and their binding and signaling like wild type secretin receptor (1Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Fig. 4demonstrates that both of these constructs were affinity labeled with this probe and that both intact receptors were recognized by this antibody. However, after CNBr cleavage only the immunoprecipitated fragment from the HA37 construct (epitope tag within fragment one) was radioactive. The site of secretin receptor labeling was further localized by cleavage with endoproteinase Lys-C. This protease would theoretically separate CNBr fragment one into an amino-terminal non-glycosylated 3,425-dalton fragment, a glycosylated fragment with 1,808-dalton core, and two tiny fragments inbetween (Fig.5). Lys-C cleavage of CNBr fragment one yielded a labeled M r = 14,000 band that shifted to M r = 6,000 after deglycosylation, consistent with representing the glycosylated region between Gly34 and Met51. A buffer incubation control did not shift the migration of the labeled CNBr fragment (data not shown). Also consistent with this identification was the larger labeled band (M r = 8,000, representing the region between Gly34 and Lys69) observed after Lys-C cleavage of the deglycosylated intact receptor (eliminating the CNBr cleavage at Met51). Further localization of the site of labeling was achieved using a cell line expressing a receptor mutant with Ala41 changed to Met (A41M) to introduce an additional site for CNBr cleavage. This construct was characterized to demonstrate its normal binding (K i = 7.0 ± 0.5 nm) and cAMP responses to secretin (EC50 = 200 ± 30 pm) (Fig. 6). It was also specifically and saturably affinity labeled with the Bpa26probe, with the labeled band migrating at M r = 70,000 and shifting to M r = 42,000 after deglycosylation (Fig. 7). Cleavage with CNBr yielded a fragment migrating at M r = 7,500 that did not shift after deglycosylation, thus representing the first 41 residues of the secretin receptor. Combined with the previous data, this allowed the further localization of the site of covalent attachment of this probe to the region between Gly34 and Ala41.Figure 7Further refinement of the domain of labeling. The A41M receptor construct was affinity labeled with the Bpa26 probe, with the labeled band migrating atM r = 70,000 and shifting toM r = 42,000 after deglycosylation with endoglycosidase F (EF). CNBr cleavage of this labeled receptor yielded a band migrating at M r = 7,500 that did not shift after deglycosylation, representing the first 41 residues of the receptor. In the absence of Met41, wild type (WT) receptor treated similarly resulted in the labeling of a larger glycosylated fragment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Identification of the specific residue that was labeled with the Bpa26 probe was achieved by manual Edman degradation sequencing of the purified deglycosylated Lys-C fragment of the wild type receptor (Fig. 8). In three independent experiments, the peak in eluted radioactivity appeared consistently in cycle 3, corresponding to the covalent labeling of receptor residue Leu36. Identical results were observed when sequencing the labeled fragment purified after CNBr cleavage and subsequent Lys-C cleavage (data not shown). Further confirmation of the identity of the covalently labeled residue as Leu36 came from biosynthetic labeling studies. In these, [3H]Leu was incorporated into newly synthesized proteins in the SecR-HA37-ex"

When a choline-requiring strain (chol-1) is depleted of choline, the period of the conidiation rhythm lengthens. We have found that the levels ofsn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) increase in proportion to the increase in period. Other clock mutations that change the period do not affect the levels of DAG. Membrane-permeant DAGs and inhibitors of DAG kinase were found to further lengthen the period of choline-depleted cultures. The level of DAG oscillates with a period comparable to the rhythm of conidiation in wild-type strains, choline-depleted cultures, and frq mutants, including a null frq strain. The DAG rhythm is present at the growing margin and also persists in older areas that have completed development. The phase of the DAG rhythm can be set by the light-to-dark transition, but the level of DAG is not immediately affected by light. Our results indicate that rhythms in DAG levels in Neurospora are driven by a light-sensitive circadian oscillator that does not require the frq gene product. High levels of DAG may feed back on that oscillator to lengthen its period.

Biological clocks track changes in the internal and external environment in such a fashion that key events in an organism's life can be appropriately orchestrated. Clocks that monitor events in a 24-h time frame are termed circadian (circa, about; dies, day). True circadian clocks exhibit a number of characteristic features, namely, a period approximating to 24 h in constant conditions, daily resetting by environmental cues such as light and temperature cycles, and a period length that is relatively constant at different temperatures (temperature compensation). The fungus Neurospora crassa has proven to be a valuable model for extending our understanding of the biochemical and genetic basis of circadian rhythmicity (reviewed in Refs. 4Feldman J.F. Dunlap J.C. Photochem. Photobiol. Rev. 1983; 7: 319-368Crossref Google Scholar, 5Lakin-Thomas P.L. Coté G.G. Brody S. Crit. Rev.

Rhythmic conidiation (spore formation) is the most obvious manifestation of rhythmicity, and is assayed in cultures growing over the surface of solid agar medium (Fig. 1). In constant environmental conditions, this rhythm has a free running period of about 21 h. In Neurospora, circadian rhythms have also been described in a variety of macromolecules and enzyme activities, and in energy metabolism, ions, and small molecules (reviewed in Ref.5Lakin-Thomas P.L. Coté G.G. Brody S. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 17: 365-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A number of rhythmically expressed genes have now been identified (7Bell-Pedersen D. Shinohara M.L. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13096-13101Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), some that are dependent on the output of the clock, including a glycolytic enzyme (8Shinohara M.L. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 446-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and some that may be components of the clock itself. Recently, much attention has focused on a molecular model for circadian rhythmicity based on an autoregulatory negative feedback loop involving the products of the frq (frequency) locus and thewc-1/wc-2 signaling pathway (reviewed in Ref. 9Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2364) Google Scholar). Mutations at the frq locus alter period, temperature compensation, and expression of rhythmicity (reviewed in Ref. 10Dunlap J.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 579-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The frqlocus also affects sensitivity to light-induced phase resetting (11Lakin-Thomas P.L. Brody S. Coté G.G. J. Biol. Rhythms. 1991; 6: 281-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). RNA and differentially phosphorylated protein products of thefrq locus accumulate rhythmically (12Aronson B.D. Johnson K.A.

Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2364) Google Scholar), although this has not yet been demonstrated. Null mutants at the frq locus, which produce no functional gene product, are often arrhythmic under standard growth conditions, but rhythmic conidiation can be seen in some circumstances (14Loros J.J. Feldman J.F. J. Biol. Rhythms. 1986; 1: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 15Aronson B.D. Johnson K.A. Dunlap J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Brody S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that the frq gene product may be a component of an input pathway transducing light signals to a core oscillator (16Merrow M. Brunner M. Roenneberg T.

A number of other mutants exhibiting defects in their time-keeping have been described (reviewed in Refs. 5Lakin-Thomas P.L. Coté G.G. Brody S. Crit. Rev.

Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 135-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which include several amino acid auxotrophs, some mitochondrial mutants, and mutations that affect glycerol metabolism. There are also several mutations affecting circadian period for which no other defect has yet been described. We have been working with two mutants defective in lipid synthesis,cel (chain-elongation) and chol-1(choline-requirer), which also affect circadian rhythmicity (reviewed in Refs. 5Lakin-Thomas P.L. Coté G.G. Brody S. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 17: 365-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19Coté G.G. Lakin-Thomas P.L. Brody S. Vanden Dreissche Th. Membranes and Circadian Rhythms. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 13-46Google Scholar). The cel mutant is defective in fatty acid synthesis and requires saturated fatty acids for normal growth and rhythmicity. This mutant displays a long period, poor temperature compensation, and slow growth when supplemented with unsaturated fatty acids or short-chain fatty acids (reviewed in Ref. 5Lakin-Thomas P.L. Coté G.G. Brody S. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 17: 365-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The chol-1 mutation partially blocks synthesis of the lipid phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho)1 (20Scarborough G.A. Nyc J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 238-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is associated with a decrease in growth rate, a lengthening of the period of the conidiation rhythm to about 60 h, and a loss of effective temperature compensation on choline-depleted media (21Lakin-Thomas P.L. Biol. Rhythm Res. 1996; 27: 12-30Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Lakin-Thomas P.L. J. Biol.

Biol. Rhythm Res. 1996; 27: 12-30Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Addition of exogenous supplies of choline restores normal clock functions in a more or less dose-dependent manner. Studies of the interaction between frq alleles and the cel orchol-1 mutants indicate that membrane lipids may be involved with the temperature compensation of the circadian rhythm (17Lakin-Thomas P.L. Brody S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Lakin-Thomas P.L. J. Biol.

Blocks in the synthesis of PtdCho in choline-requiring mutants affect the levels of a number of important lipid metabolites, including membrane phospholipids and neutral lipids (24Juretic D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 469: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 25Hubbard S.C. Brody S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7173-7181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The work described in this paper began as a search for the biochemical basis of the lengthened period in chol-1. An observation that the levels of sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) increase in direct proportion to the increase in period led to an exploration of the relationship between DAG and the circadian clock in wild-type and mutantfrq strains. We report that the level of DAG is rhythmically modulated as an output of the circadian clock and that increased levels of DAG may feed back on the clock mechanism to lengthen its period. All experiments were performed with strains with a csp-1; bd genotype as described previously (26Lakin-Thomas P.L. J. Biol. Rhythms. 1992; 7: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The csp-1 (conidial separation) mutation reduces contamination by preventing the release of conidiospores, and the bd (band) mutation allows the expression of conidiation at high CO2 concentrations in closed culture vessels. Construction of the csp-1; chol-1 bd strain and thecsp-1; chol-1 bd; frq series strains has previously been described (21Lakin-Thomas P.L. Biol. Rhythm Res. 1996; 27: 12-30Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Lakin-Thomas P.L. J. Biol. Rhythms. 1998; 13: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For simplicity, the csp-1 andbd mutations are not included in the strain names in the text: the csp-1; bd strain is referred to aschol + or wild-type (with respect to thechol-1 locus), and the csp-1; chol-1 bd strain is referred to as chol-1. The csp-1; chol-1 bd; frqstrains are referred to as chol-1 frq double mutants, again ignoring the csp-1 and bd mutations carried by all strains. Standard methods (27Davis R.H. deSerres F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17A: 79-143Crossref Scopus (938) Google Scholar) were used for stock keeping and crosses. For all experiments, cultures were incubated at 22 ± 1 °C. All cultures were grown on solid agar medium (Vogel's N, with 0.5% maltose and 0.01% arginine; 2% agar) in 9-cm diameter Petri dishes (as starter cultures) and/or on NUNC (245 × 245 mm) BioAssay dishes (in assay cultures). Cultures requiring choline supplementation were supplied with choline chloride at concentrations varying from 0 to 200 μm choline as appropriate. Under routine conditions, the starter cultures were initiated with conidial inoculations from frozen stocks followed by 48-h incubation in constant light. Plugs of 6-mm diameter were cut from the margins of actively growing colonies and were then used to inoculate the center of bioassay plates overlaid with uncoated cellophane membranes (generously donated by UCB Films plc, Bridgewater, Somerset, UK). After a further 24 h under white light, the cultures were either maintained in constant light (LL), allowed to free-run in constant darkness (DD), or entrained to a 12:12 h or 24:24 h light/dark (LD) cycle. Manipulations of the cultures in darkness were performed under a red light, which has been previously shown to have no measurable effect upon the clock inNeurospora. Light phases were achieved by illuminating cultures with a single cool-white fluorescent strip source suspended above the plates to give a maximum photon flux density at the culture surface of 25 μmol/m2/s. Light intensity was measured with a PAR quantum sensor (Skye-SKP 200, Llandridod Wells, Powys, Wales, UK). Periods and growth rates were determined on solid agar medium, either directly on sampled culture plates or on parallel control cultures, using daily growth front positions marked on the reverse of colonies as timing marks. Daily growth rates were then used to calculate the timing of the peaks of conidiation in each band, the difference in sidereal hours between band peaks giving the period. Typically, three to four periods were determined per plate. Circadian time (CT) calculations were based upon a normalization of the individual periods to a standardized 24-h day with CT 12 defined as the time of the light-to-dark transition. For analysis ofsn-1,2-diacylglycerols (DAG), sectors of mycelium 1 cm wide by 0.5–1 cm long (approximately 0.1–2.0 mg of residual dry weight, RDW) were scraped from the surface of the cellophane (either at the margin or within a differentiated region as required), frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −70 °C. Triplicate samples were removed from locations on the mycelium of the same age and phase and were spatially well separated from one another. This strategy was adopted to reduce the possibility that DAG levels in a particular region of the colony could be affected by the localized cellular damage or stress that accompanies the sampling procedure. Following a number of different trial protocols, lipid extractions were performed on the frozen samples using a method adapted from Bligh and Dyer (28Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42799) Google Scholar). Sample mycelium was extracted with 1.5 ml of ice-cold chloroform/methanol (1:2), vortexed, and kept on ice for 10–15 min. The samples were then mixed with 1 ml of 2.4 n KCl/1 mm EDTA (1:1) and 0.5 ml of chloroform. After 1 min of vortexing, incubation on ice for 10–15 min and centrifugation at 822 × g for 5 min, the lower phase was transferred to a fresh tube containing 2 ml of ice-cold methanol/1 n KCl (1:1). The original tube and contents were then extracted twice more with chloroform at room temperature, and the lower phase at each step was added to the methanol solution. The combined organic extracts were centrifuged for 5 min at 822 × g, and then the lower phase was transferred to a fresh glass tube. Following a final wash with methanol/1 n KCl, the lower phase was transferred to a screw-capped glass vial and stored under N2 gas at −20 °C. Mycelial debris remaining in the original sample tube were washed once in 15 ml of water and twice in 15 ml of methanol. During the second methanol wash, the samples were sonicated for 5 min. The residual mycelium was then transferred, in a minimum volume of methanol, to a preweighed aluminum foil boat and dried overnight at 110 °C. The residual dry weight (RDW) of the mycelium was determined on a Cahn electrobalance calibrated in the range 1 μg to 200 mg. We have chosen to calculate DAG levels relative to RDW, with the knowledge that RDW may itself be varying rhythmically as the cultures differentiate. Our observations that DAG levels continue to display rhythmicity in old areas of the culture that have completed differentiation, and that the DAG rhythms are not always in phase with the conidiation bands, give us confidence that the rhythms in DAG we observe are not artifacts of rhythmic differentiation. Before assessing DAG levels, lipid samples were dried under a constant stream of N2 at 60 °C and then redissolved in 500 μl of chloroform. Typically a 100-μl subsample was removed for an absolute mass determination of DAG using the DAG assay reagents system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This assay is based on the method of Preiss et al.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 141: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and relies on the quantitative conversion of sn-1,2-diacylglycerols to [33P]phosphatidic acids by DAG kinase in the presence of [γ-33P]ATP. Radiolabeled phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) can then be separated from other products by thin layer chromatography (20- × 20-cm Whatman Silica Gel 60 plates; 75-min separation at room temperature in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid, 65:15:5). Consistent lipid markers were visualized with iodine vapor, and the location corresponding to PtdOH was removed and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. In preliminary experiments, the location of PtdOH on the TLC plates was determined by cochromatography, iodine staining, and autoradiography of samples with radiolabeled PtdOH, lyso-PtdCho, PtdCho, and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycerol standards. Levels of DAG in samples were calculated by comparison to a series of standard assay reactions performed using known amounts of 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycerol. DAG levels are expressed as picomoles of DAG per milligram of RDW (mean ± 1 S.E., n ≥ 3 per sample time). In some cases, one of a set of replicate samples gave a DAG value several times higher or lower than that of the other replicates. This could usually be attributed to very small or very large residual mass values, due to errors in recovery or drying of extracted mycelial residue, and that value was removed from the calculations. Unless otherwise indicated, cultures were grown on NUNC BioAssay plates overlaid with cellophane. Each time series combines data from several different colonies, each providing a short series of samples. Inoculation times and light-to-dark transitions were staggered by 11 or 12 h so that two colonies could be harvested simultaneously to provide data for different phases. Sampling times were arranged so that some overlap of time series occurred between colonies. Individual time points represent the mean ± 1 S.E. of triplicate samples from a single colony. Cultures ofchol-1 were grown in Petri dishes overlaid with sterile dialysis tubing on solid agar medium supplemented with [3H]palmitic acid at 5 μCi/ml and various levels of choline to manipulate the period. Samples were harvested from the combined band and interband regions after 1.5 cycles in DD. Lipids were extracted with acidic chloroform/methanol as described previously (30Lakin-Thomas P.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Lipids were separated by HPLC using a silica column (Waters μPorasil, 10 μm) and a gradient of hexane:propane-2-ol:H2O from 6:8:0.75 to 6:8:1.5 (v/v). Phospholipid peaks were quantitated by on-line radiometric detection of 3H and were identified by cochromatography with known standards detected by UV absorption. Cultures ofchol-1 were grown in liquid medium with 2% glucose and 200 μm choline in 1-ml microtiter wells, as described previously (30Lakin-Thomas P.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cultures were labeled during growth with [3H]palmitic acid at 10 μCi/ml. After an initial 24 h in constant light, cultures were transferred to constant dark and harvested after 30 h in darkness. Mycelial disks were exposed to cool-white fluorescent light at approximately 20–25 μmol/m2/s for 0, 2, 5, and 60 s before freezing rapidly in liquid N2. Lipid extracts were performed as described above. Samples of lipid extracts were separated on HPLC using the method of Bocckino et al. (31Bocckino S.B. Blackmore P.F. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14201-14207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for DAG purification. The DAG peak was identified by UV absorption of a standard DAG sample. DAG peaks from labeled cultures were quantitated by on-line radiometric detection of 3H. Cultures were inoculated onto solid agar medium in “race tubes” made from sterile disposable plastic pipettes (32White B. Woodward D. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1995; 42: 79-80Google Scholar). Tubes were capped with plastic culture caps at one end, and the cotton plugs were left in the pipette tops at the other end. Growth medium was supplemented with one or more of the following: DOG, 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol; OAG, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol; DDG, 1,2-didecanoyl-rac-glycerol; DAGKI-I, diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor I, R59022; DAGKI-II, diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor II,R59949. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma. DAG analogs were diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and added to autoclaved growth medium immediately before filling race tubes, to give a final Me2SO concentration of 0.1% (v/v). DAGKIs were dissolved in ethanol and added to growth medium to give a final ethanol concentration of 0.4% (v/v). Control tubes contained the solvents (Me2SO and/or ethanol) at the same concentrations. Cultures were incubated at 22 °C in constant light for 24 h before transfer to constant darkness. Periods were calculated as described previously (26Lakin-Thomas P.L. J. Biol. Rhythms. 1992; 7: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Choline deprivation of the choline-requiring chol-1 mutant ofNeurospora lengthens the period of the conidiation rhythm and alters the lipid composition. In an attempt to find the cause of the lengthened period, we looked for correlations between the period of the conidiation rhythm and the levels of lipids in a chol-1strain grown on various levels of choline. Phospholipid levels were assayed by labeling cultures to equilibrium during growth with [3H]palmitic acid and separating a lipid extract on HPLC. Fig. 2 A shows results for the two most abundant phospholipids in Neurospora, phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) and PtdCho, reported as % total phospholipids. Note that the two data points at approximately 20.5 h represent two different choline concentrations, 20 and 100 μm choline: Although the growth rate is slower at 20 μm, there is no change in the period as compared with 100 μm, demonstrating that period is independent of growth rate. As expected, PtdCho levels determined by HPLC were lower in cultures with below optimal levels of choline supplementation, but PtdCho levels did not correlate with period. Neither did levels of PtdEtn (Fig. 2 A), nor did any of the other phospholipids assayed (phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and cardiolipin, data not shown). Similar results were obtained if phospholipid levels were calculated as dpm per milligram of RDW instead of percentage of total phospholipids (data not shown). In contrast to the phospholipids, the level of the neutral lipid DAG was found to correlate with period (Fig. 2 B). The data for DAG in Fig. 2 B were obtained by assaying DAG levels in lipid extracts as described under “Experimental Procedures” and are reported as mass of DAG per milligram of RDW. Similar results were obtained by labeling cultures with [3H]palmitic acid and separating neutral lipids by HPLC. Triacylglycerol (TAG) levels are also known to increase with choline deprivation inNeurospora (24Juretic D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 469: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), although the levels of TAG were not assayed in these experiments. The samples assayed in Fig. 2 were taken from large areas of mycelium, encompassing both older and newer regions of the fungal colony and both band and interband regions. To determine whether DAG levels differ between different regions of a colony, samples were harvested from defined regions. In Fig. 3, DAG levels are reported for six regions: three bands and three interbands, of increasing age. (Band 1 is the youngest region of the colony, and Interband 3 is the oldest.) In all regions, levels of DAG were higher on the lower level of choline supplementation, and there were no significant trends in DAG level with age or band/interband identity. DAG levels were observed to fluctuate when samples were harvested at various times after the transition to DD. In Figs. 2 and 3, samples were harvested at a single time after cultures were transferred into constant darkness (Fig. 3) or at a single phase of the circadian rhythm for cultures with different periods (Fig. 2). In Fig. 4, samples were taken at the growing margin of the colonies, following the margin as the colony diameter expanded. DAG levels were found to fluctuate in the wild-type chol + strain on both minimal medium (0 choline, Fig. 4 A) and 200 μm choline (Fig.4 B), and in the chol-1 strain growing at wild-type rates on 200 μm choline (Fig.4 C). Changes in the level of DAG are not a product of active differentiationper se, because fluctuations in DAG levels were also detected in older areas of the colony after the growth front had moved on. Fig. 5 presents the results of analyses of DAG in the chol-1 strain on 200 μmcholine, comparing the growing margin (Fig. 5 A) with an aging band (Fig. 5 B) and an aging interband region (Fig.5 C). These results indicate that the DAG rhythm is not confined to actively growing areas and is therefore not caused by developmental changes occurring in the harvested regions. The time between later peaks (after 40 h in DD) is approximately 20 h, similar to the 21-h free running period of the conidiation rhythm, indicating that this rhythm in DAG may be related to the circadian rhythm of conidiation. DAG levels are elevated in a chol-1 strain displaying a long period. In Fig. 6, DAG levels were assayed at the margin of the chol-1 strain growing on minimal medium (zero choline). Under these conditions, the colonies show a conidiation period of about 60 h, but replicate colonies are often not in synchrony with one another (21Lakin-Thomas P.L. Biol. Rhythm Res. 1996; 27: 12-30Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The colonies harvested for Fig. 6 were subjected to 2.5 cycles (5 days) of a 48-h light/dark cycle, 24 h of light and 24 h of dark, before transfer to constant darkness and harvesting. We have found that this procedure improves synchrony of colonies for the first few days in DD. Control plates that were not harvested typically produced an interband region shortly after the light-to-dark transition in this experiment. The data in Fig. 6 show a single major peak of DAG after the transition to DD; however, because samples were collected for little more than one cycle, we cannot say whether this major peak would be repeated in a second cycle. The smoothed curve from Fig. 5 A (200 μm choline) has been replotted in Fig. 6 for comparison. Note that the level of DAG is higher at all time points in the cultures on minimal medium as compared with 200 μm choline. The data presented above demonstrate that the levels of DAG are higher under conditions that lengthen the conidiation period in the chol-1 strain. If the high level of DAG is a consequence of the lengthened period, then we would predict that other mutations that alter the period should also alter DAG levels. To test this prediction, we have assayed the levels of DAG in the series of frq mutants. Mutations at thefrq locus of Neurospora change the period of the circadian conidiation rhythm but have no effects on growth rate or viability (4Feldman J.F. Dunlap J.C. Photochem. Photobiol. Rev. 1983; 7: 319-368Crossref Google Scholar). We have assayed DAG levels in two short periodfrq mutants (frq 1 andfrq 2 ), two long period frq mutants (frq 3 and frq 7 ) and a null mutant at the frq locus, frq 10 , a deletion mutant that makes no functional frq gene product and is arrhythmic under some conditions. Samples were harvested at two different times in DD. The frq mutations were assayed both in chol + strains on zero choline and inchol-1 strains on 200 μm choline.

Although the intracellular signaling pathways stimulated by cytokine receptors are well described, little is known about the mechanisms through which these pathways modulate hematopoietic cell adhesion events in the microenvironment. Here we show that cytokine-activated Stat3 stimulates the expression and function of cell surface adhesion molecules in the myeloid progenitor cell line 32D. We generated an erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) isoform (ER343/401-S3) that activates Stat3 rather than Stat5 by substituting the Stat3 binding/activation sequence motif from gp130 for the sequences surrounding tyrosines 343 and 401 in the receptor cytoplasmic region. Activation of Stat3 leads to homotypic cell aggregation, increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), CD18, and CD11b, and activation of signaling through CD18-containing integrins. Unlike the wild type EpoR, ER343/401-S3 is unable to support long term Epo-dependent proliferation in 32D cells. Instead, Epo-treated ER343/401-S3 cells undergo G1 arrest and express elevated levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. Sustained activation of Stat3 in these cells is required for their altered morphology and growth properties since constitutive SOCS3 expression abrogates homotypic cell aggregation, signaling through CD18-containing integrins, G1 arrest, and accumulation of p27Kip1. Collectively, our results demonstrate that cytokine-activated Stat3 stimulates the expression and function of cell surface adhesion molecules, indicating that a role for Stat3 is to regulate intercellular contacts in myeloid cells.

They are localized in the cytoplasm, where they can be rapidly recruited to activated receptor complexes following cytokine stimulation. Stats are then phosphorylated on critical tyrosine residues, enabling homo- or heterodimerization through reciprocal SH2-domain-phosphotyrosine interactions. Activated Stats translocate to the nucleus to stimulate transcription of cytokine-dependent genes (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar). Many cytokine-specific signals are mediated by Stat proteins (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar, 2Ihle J.N.

Identification of gene targets for activated Stats is elucidating the mechanisms through which they elicit specified in vivofunctions. For example, Stat1 regulates the interferon-α-inducible transcription of several immunomodulatory proteins, including major histocompatibility complex class I and II proteins (5Meraz M.A. White J.M.

Overall, however, the nuclear targets of activated Stats are not well defined, and it is unclear how Stat-regulated genes contribute to the development and function of hematopoietic cells. In vivo, the growth, development, and function of hematopoietic cells is also profoundly influenced by intercellular contacts in the microenvironment mediated by cell surface adhesion molecules (for review, see Ref. 31Verfaille C.M. Blood. 1998; 92: 2609-2612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, during development in the bone marrow or thymus, immature hematopoietic and lymphoid cells require contacts with resident stromal cells to fully complete their developmental program. In addition, several mature hematopoietic cell types require specific cell-cell contacts to perform their specialized functions. The adhesion events that control the development, trafficking, and function of hematopoietic cells are regulated by integrins, selectins, and mucins (31Verfaille C.M. Blood. 1998; 92: 2609-2612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 506-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Cytokine signaling can modify the activity of hematopoietic cell adhesion molecules and cellular responses to adhesion events (31Verfaille C.M. Blood. 1998; 92: 2609-2612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate these processes and, in particular, the role of cytokine-activated Stat proteins. The goal of this study was to investigate the function of Stat3 in myeloid cells. Since cytokine receptors that naturally activate Stat3 also stimulate other Stat proteins, such as Stat1 or Stat5, we generated a chimeric EpoR that selectively activated Stat3. This system enabled us to define specific, cytokine-dependent, functions of Stat3. Results from our studies demonstrate a new role for Stat3. We show that sustained activation of Stat3 in 32D cells stimulates the expression and function of hematopoietic cell adhesion molecules. These results suggest that Stat3 regulates cytokine-dependent cell adhesion events in myeloid progenitor cells. The murine EpoR (33D'Andrea A.D. Lodish H.F. Wong G.G.

To introduce the substitution at residue 343, two PCR fragments (A and B) were generated from the EpoR cDNA by amplification with primer pairs 1 and 2 or 3 and 4 (Table I). Fragments A and B were mixed and amplified by PCR using primers 1 and 4 to generate a PCR fragment (C) containing EpoR nucleotides 990–1235, with the Stat3 binding site substituted for nucleotides 1183–1197. Fragment C was digested with BamHI and HindIII and subcloned into the BamHI/HindIII sites of the EpoR 3′ region. The substitution at residue 401 was generated by a similar strategy using primers 5, 6, 7, and 8 (Table I). This yielded a PCR fragment containing EpoR nucleotides 1209–1561 with the Stat3 binding site substituted for nucleotides 1357–1371. This fragment was subcloned into the HindIII/AvrII sites of the EpoR cDNA containing the substitution at position 343 to generate a receptor containing both substitutions (ER343/401-S3). A similar strategy employing primers 9, 10, 11, 12 (Table I) was used to generate the mutant ER-Y343/401F. Regions of PCR amplification were verified by dideoxy sequence analysis. ER343/401-S3 and ER-Y343/401F were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pMEX.Table ISequence of oligonucleotide primersPrimer nameSequence1 (990–1006)5′-CTTCCCTGAGGATCCAC-3′2 (1235–1216)5′-GATGTTTCTGAAGCTTCATC-3′3 (α343-S3)5′-CTGAGGCATGTACCCGTCCTGGGCATGCTCACTGCC-3′4 (343-S3)5′-GGGTACATGCCTCAGGATAAGTGGTTGCTGCCCCGG-3′5 (1209–1228)5′-GACTATGGATGAAGCTTCAG-3′6 (1561–1541)5′-CCGACCTCAGGATCCTCGTCC-3′7 (α401-S3)5′-CTGAGGCATGTACCCAAAGCTGGAAGGTGAGGTGCC-3′8 (401-S3)5′-GGGTACATGCCTCAGGACCCCAGCTCTCAGCTCCTG-3′9 (αY343F)5′-CAATACCAAGAAGGTGTCCTG-3′10 (Y343F)5′-CAGGACACCTTCTTGGTATTG-3′11 (αY401F)5′-CAGGATGGTGAACTCAAAGCTG-3′12 (Y401F)5′-CAGCTTTGAGTTCACCATCCTG-3′The sequence of oligonucleotide primers used to generate mutant EpoRs are shown, with regions encoding the mutations underlined.

EpoR and G-CSFR expression was verified by immunoprecipitations from metabolically labeled cells or by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (not shown). SOCS3 expression was verified by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates (not shown). Cells growing in RPMI/FCS/WEHI were washed three times with RPMI containing 10% FCS (RPMI/FCS), then plated in RPMI/FCS supplemented with Epo (concentrations indicated in the text) and cultured for up to 2 weeks. Cell density was maintained under 106 cells/ml by dilution in fresh medium. Viable cells, as judged by trypan blue dye exclusion, were counted every 2–3 days, and total cell numbers were graphed to determine doubling times. All cell lines were strictly growth factor-dependent and died after 24 h in RPMI/FCS (data not shown). For cell cycle analysis, 106 cells were collected after 3 d of growth in medium containing Epo or IL-3. The media was removed by aspiration, and cells were resuspended in 75% ethanol and stored at −20 °C for up to 1 week. To stain with propidium iodide, the cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) and 25 μg/ml RNase A and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C. The cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on a Coulter Epics Profile (Miami, FL) machine. Cell cycle profiles were generated by MultiCycle (Phoenix Flow System, San Diego, CA) software. For flow cytometry analysis, cells (∼106) were incubated in 1% goat serum in PBS for 60 min at 4 °C. Antibodies specific for murine ICAM-1 (YN1, ATCC, Manassas, VA) or CD18 (M18/2, PharMingen, San Diego, CA) were added at a concentration of 1 μg/ml, and cells were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed three times with goat serum/PBS and incubated in goat serum/PBS containing anti-rat fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution) (Sigma) for 60 min at 4 °C. Controls were incubated with secondary antibody alone. The cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde/PBS and washed twice with PBS. The stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on a Coulter Epics Profile machine. For aggregation assays, cells were cultured in RPMI/FCS/WEHI or RPMI/FCS containing 0.5 units/ml Epo as indicated, then dispersed by pipetting and plated in the indicated conditions (see Fig.6 B for details). Cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 and photographed as described below. For cell spreading assays, antibodies were diluted to 10 μg/ml in 0.1m NaHCO3, pH 9.0, added to the wells of a 96-well EIA./RIA plate (Costar, Cambridge, MA) (50 μl/well) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Wells were then blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA for 2 h at room temperature. For BSA controls, some wells were incubated only with 1% BSA in PBS. The wells were then washed 3× with PBS at room temperature and used in spreading assays. Cells were treated as indicated (see figure legends for details), then dispersed by pipetting and plated in antibody- or BSA-containing wells. Cells were incubated for 60–90 min at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. The cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde/PBS for 15 min at room temperature, and plates were stored at 4 °C. Cells were photographed at 200× magnification (Olympus IX70 microscope) using a SPOT digital camera. The resulting digital images were manipulated with Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA). EpoR antisera has been described previously (41Yoshimura A. D'Andrea A.D. Lodish H.F. Proc.

Antiserum specific for Stat5, Stat3, Stat1, or p27Kip1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and antiserum specific for Jak2 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Cells were treated with Epo as indicated in the text, and detergent cell extracts were made as described previously (39Watowich S.S. Hilton D.J. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3535-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) using Buffer A (1% w/v Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μl/ml aprotinin). Lysates were cleared by incubation with protein A-agarose beads (30–120 min at 4 °C) and used for immunoprecipitations as described (39Watowich S.S. Hilton D.J. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3535-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Whole cell lysates were made by sonicating cells in protein gel sample buffer, as described previously (39Watowich S.S. Hilton D.J. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell.

Cells (5 × 106/sample) were radioiodinated as described (42Keski-Oja J. Mosher D.F. Vaheri A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 74: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The iodinated cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 1 h on ice before being clarified by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. One-fifth of the total lysate, or 1 × 106 cell equivalents, was used for each immunoprecipitation, as described above. Cells were treated as described in the figure legends. To prepare nuclear extracts, cells were resuspended in ice-cold Buffer B (150 mm NaCl, 100 mm sucrose, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 3% glycerol) and lysed by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold Buffer C (Buffer B containing 10 μl/ml Nonidet P-40). The lysate was layered on a cushion of Buffer D (25% glycerol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.5 mmMgCl2), and the nuclei were pelleted in a room temperature microcentrifuge at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The nuclei were washed with cold PBS, then lysed in high salt lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 20 min at 4 °C while shaking. The nuclear extract was clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge, and the protein concentration in the extract was determined as described (43Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using commercially available reagents (Pierce). DNA binding activity was assayed with 8 μg of nuclear protein (per sample), and a radiolabeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the Stat5 or SIE (Sis-inducible element) consensus binding sequence (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Binding reactions were performed for 20 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of antibodies specific for Stat3 or Stat1, as indicated in the figure legends. The reaction mixtures were separated on 5% polyacrylamide gels, and migration of the nucleoprotein complexes were determined by autoradiography. A schematic diagram of EpoRs containing modified Stat binding sites is shown in Fig. 1. 32D cell lines expressing the WT EpoR or chimeric EpoRs isoforms were established. Metabolic pulse-chase labeling experiments showed that the introduced mutations did not detectably alter the synthesis or processing of the EpoR (data not shown). Cells expressing WT or mutant EpoRs expressed similar levels of cell surface receptors (4000–5300 receptors/cell) and displayed similar ligand binding properties (K d ∼1.2 nm; data not shown), indicating that the Stat binding site substitutions did not alter the affinity of the receptor for Epo. To examine the pattern of Epo-dependent Stat protein activation in transfected 32D cell lines, Stat tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity were assayed. Stat5 was activated by the WT EpoR during short term stimulation of growth factor-deprived cells with 0.5 units/ml Epo or saturating (5.0 or 50.0 units/ml) concentrations of Epo (Fig.2 A; upper panel,lanes 1–4). The majority of Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation was abrogated in Epo-stimulated ER343/401-S3 or ER-Y343/401F cells (Fig. 2 A; upper panel, lanes 5–8 and9–12, respectively), particularly in response to 0.5 units/ml Epo (Fig. 2 A, upper panel, lanes 6 and 10). Equivalent levels of Stat5 were present in the immunoprecipitation samples, as determined by immunoblotting with Stat5 antibody (data not shown). EMSAs showed that the pattern of Stat5 DNA binding activity was similar to that of Stat5 protein tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). During long term culture in 0.5 units/ml Epo, Stat5 activation was sustained in cells expressing WT EpoR and markedly decreased in ER343/401-S3 cells (Fig. 2 B, upper andlower panels, lanes 2, 3,5, and 6). Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation was correspondingly decreased in ER-Y343/401F cells during long term culture in Epo (Fig. 2 B, upper panel, lanes 8 and 9), although some active Stat5 was detected after 48 h in Epo by EMSA (Fig. 2 B, lower panel,lanes 8 and 9). In all cell lines, Stat5 was activated when cells were grown in IL-3, as expected (44Azam M. Erdument-Bormage H. Krieder B.L. Xia M. Quelle F. Basu R. Saris C. Tempst P. Ihle J.N. Schindler C.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 B, upper and lower panels,lanes 1, 4, and 7). The levels of Stat5 in the immunoprecipitation samples were similar, as judged by anti-Stat5 immunoblots (Fig. 2 B, middle panel,lanes 1–9). Stat3 was not tyrosine-phosphorylated in mock-stimulated cells, in IL-3-treated cells, or in cells expressing WT EpoR or ER-Y343/401F, even in saturating concentrations of Epo (Fig.3 A, upper panel,lanes 1–4; Fig. 3 B, upper panel,lanes 1–3 and 7–9). However, Stat3 was activated in ER343/401-S3 cells following short term stimulation of growth factor-deprived cells with 0.5 units/ml Epo or saturating concentrations of Epo (Fig. 3 A; upper panel,lanes 6–8). Furthermore, activated Stat3 was readily detected during long term culture (24–48 h) of these cells in 0.5 units/ml Epo (Fig. 3 B, upper panel, lanes 5 and 6). The levels of immunoprecipitated Stat3 were similar in all samples (Fig. 3 B, middle panel). EMSAs with the SIE oligonucleotide, which contains the binding site for Stat3 and Stat1, showed the presence of activated SIE-binding proteins in Epo-stimulated ER343/401-S3 cells but not in WT or Y343/401F cells (Figs. 3, A and B, lower panels). To determine if both Stat1 and Stat3 were activated by the EpoR substitutions or if only Stat3 was activated, supershift EMSA assays were performed using Stat1- or Stat3-specific antibodies. These experiments showed that the SIE binding activity in Epo-treated ER343/401-S3 cells was due to Stat3 only (Fig. 3 C). Collectively, these results demonstrate that EpoR isoforms with modified Stat binding sites have altered Stat signaling specificity. Epo stimulation of ER343/401-S3 cells results in sustained activation"

Here we took advantage of two rat pheochromocytoma-derived cell lines (PC12/MEN2A and PC12/MEN2B) to investigate whether Ret-induced nerve growth factor (NGF) unresponsiveness might involve impairment of ERK signaling. In fact, these cells, stably transfected with distinct forms of the active ret oncogene, fail to block proliferation, even upon NGF stimulation. In these cells we show the presence of both chronic ERKs activity and high expression levels of MKP-3, an ERK-specific phosphatase. Despite the presence of MKP-3, ERK activity can be further stimulated by NGF, but it fails to translocate into the nucleus and consequently to induce immediate-early gene transcription. Because of the presence of MKP-3, our results suggest the existence of a negative regulatory feedback acting on ERKs as a mechanism responsible for the abrogation of NGF-induced terminal differentiation. Indeed, MKP-3 seems to be implicated in the persistence of ERKs in cell cytoplasm. This interpretation is further supported by the observation that in ret-transfected cells, forced expression of an active form of MEK-1 may overcome this block; it restores transcription from the c-fos promoter, induces translocation of ERKs into the nucleus, and inhibits cell proliferation.

Missense mutations at one of five cysteine residues (Cys-609, -611, -618, -620, and -634) clustered in the extra cytoplasmic domain of ret are the most frequent causative genetic events of familial medullary thyroid carcinoma and the MEN-2A syndrome (8.Ponder B.A.J. Pierotti M.A. Nelkin B.D. Genetic Mechanisms in Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996: 21-35Crossref Google Scholar). A single point mutation, which results in a Thr for Met substitution at codon 918 within the Ret catalytic domain, is responsible for the MEN-2B syndrome (8.Ponder B.A.J. Pierotti M.A. Nelkin B.D. Genetic Mechanisms in Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996: 21-35Crossref Google Scholar). These mutations convertret into a dominant transforming gene and cause constitutive activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, although their mechanism of activation differs (8.Ponder B.A.J.

Indeed, the inheritance of mutated retalleles implicates them in the pathogenesis of a generalized hyperplasia of the entire population of thyroid C-cells and of the adrenal medulla chromaffin cells (11.Smith D.P.

In this study we investigate whether a biological mechanism by which Ret mutants participate in neoplastic progression in MEN-2 syndromes might involve the unresponsiveness of neuroendocrine cells to extracellular growth inhibitory signals.Many polypeptide growth factors activate sequentially the components of the signal transduction cascade, which includes activation of Ras, Raf, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK), and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases, ERK-1 and ERK-2 (also called p42/p44MAPK) (13.Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). MAP kinase activation is a crucial step of several cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and long term potentiation (14.Brunet A. Pagès G. Pouyssègur J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3379-3387PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar, 16.Marshall C.J.

In turn, the activity of MAP kinases is modulated by several dual specificity MAP kinase phosphatases (DSP). Among them, the MKP-3, which is mainly found in cell cytoplasm, is involved in modulating nuclear translocation of the kinase (18.Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells terminal differentiation is mediated by the tyrosine phosphorylation of the NGF receptor and leads to the persistent activation and subsequent nuclear translocation of ERKs (Refs. 19.Chen R.H.

Although many aspects of theret signaling pathway have been elucidated, there is no direct evidence that ERK activation is involved in the transforming mechanism of Ret. Moreover, acute stimulation of ret in neuroblastoma cell lines and primary cultures from neuroendocrine tumors, but not in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, results in ERK phosphorylation (22.van Weering D.H.J.

We used two recently established stable isolates of the PC12 cells that express the active Ret variants, RetC634Y (PC12/MEN2A) and RetM918T (PC12/MEN2B). Expression of theret-active mutants induces the PC12 cells to become partially differentiated but incapable of undergoing terminal differentiation, even upon NGF stimulation (27.Califano D. D'Alessio A. Colucci-D'Amato G.L. De Vita G. Monaco C. Santelli G. Di Fiore P.P. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Santoro M. de Franciscis V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, because a major consequence of NGF-induced differentiation is inhibition of cell proliferation, we investigated whether abrogation of NGF responsiveness in ret-transfected PC12 cell lines might involve an impairment in the nuclear signal transmission through ERK kinases.DISCUSSIONThe fact that Ret active mutants cause uncontrolled cell proliferation in neuroendocrine tumors, associated with MEN-2 syndromes, is difficult to reconcile with the differentiating effects observed when the same mutants are overexpressed either in PC12 or in human neuroblastoma cells (25.Santoro M.

In this study, we report data that implicate chronic activation of the ERK cascade as a mechanism for Ret-induced uncontrolled proliferation of neuroendocrine cells. We took advantage of stable cell lines that reproduce in vitro some of the biological events caused by Ret in human tumors, including unlimited growth. In these cell lines, obtained by expressing the ret oncogene in the PC12 cells, the resulting phenotype is dependent on the ret oncogene and is associated with active proliferation (27, and Califano et al. (47.Califano D. D'Alessio A. Colucci-D'Amato G.L. Calı̀ G. Rizzo C. Cannada-Bartoli P. Santelli G. Vecchio G. de franciscis V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19297-19305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)). Indeed, expression of the ret-active variants, driven by a strong promoter, may cause terminal differentiation of PC12 cells (as assessed by long neurite outgrowth and growth arrest). On the other hand, expressing ret mutants at physiological levels by less efficient promoters cause PC12 cells to change morphology and to express neuronal genes. However, differentiation is not terminal (because of absence of long neurites and of sustained cell proliferation) (27.Califano D. D'Alessio A. Colucci-D'Amato G.L. De Vita G. Monaco C. Santelli G. Di Fiore P.P. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Santoro M. de Franciscis V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7933-7937Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Proliferation enables us to establish stable cell lines at high frequency. The present results indicate that in these cell lines the presence of high expression levels of the ERK-specific phosphatase, MKP-3, might be implicated in the lack of terminal differentiation. Moreover, even though NGF caused additional stimulation of ERK activity, it elicited neither further ERK translocation into the nucleus nor the expression of immediate-early genes.In PC12 cells, neuronal terminal differentiation is preceded by the coordinate expression of a complex pattern of genes, includingKrox-24 and vgf transcripts, whose expression is dependent on the Ras pathway (21.Segal R.A.

Moreover, we show that a portion of ERKs is phosphorylated in tyrosine residues, and even though mainly located in the cytosol, is also present in the nuclear compartment. This is well supported by the presence of both Krox-24 and vgf transcripts as indicative of chronically active Ras-MAPK cascade (Ref. 27.Califano D. D'Alessio A. Colucci-D'Amato G.L. De Vita G.

However, although inret-transfected cells the activation of this pathway elicits neuronal gene expression, it is not sufficient for further progression toward terminal differentiation, as assessed by active cell proliferation and absence of long neuritic processes (27.Califano D. D'Alessio A. Colucci-D'Amato G.L. De Vita G. Monaco C. Santelli G. Di Fiore P.P. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Santoro M. de Franciscis V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7933-7937Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Recently, a number of findings implicate NGF as an antiproliferative factor for tumor or cell lines of neuroendocrine origin (41.Missale C. Codignola A. Sigala S. Finardi A. Paez Pereda M. Sher E. Spano P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5366-5371Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Indeed, loss of NGF production is associated with neoplastic progression and poor prognosis (42.Missale C. Losa M. Sigala S. Balsari A. Giovanelli M. Spano P.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 272-285PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that in ret-transfected cells, NGF stimulation induced a rapid increase of ERK activity, which reached a peak value after 5 min and rapidly declined. However, while NGF stimulation of the PC12 parental cells resulted in induction of immediate-early gene transcription (c-fos andKrox-24) and in nuclear translocation of the enzyme, high levels of ERK activity, induced by NGF, in the rettransfectants induced neither expression of c-fos nor further nuclear translocation of the enzyme.Expression of the immediate-early gene c-fos is rapidly induced in PC12 cells by a variety of extracellular stimuli, including NGF (21.Segal R.A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 43.Greenberg M.E. Greene L. Ziff E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14101-14110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NGF signal is, in fact, transmitted into the nucleus and stimulates c-fos transcription by means of at least two Ras-dependent protein kinases as follows: ERK, which regulates the activity of transcription factor TCF/Elk-1, and a CREB kinase, which regulates the activity of CREB (29.Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Indeed, the fact that, in the ret transfectants, NGF induced neither CREB phosphorylation nor c-fos expression indicates that in these cells the NGF-induced activation of ERK may be not sufficient to transmit fully NGF signaling into the nucleus. Whether other ERK-independent mechanisms contribute to the lack of immediate-early gene expression remains to be determined. Moreover, the failure of NGF to induce further ERKs translocation indicates that the lack of its nuclear relocalization might be implicated in NGF unresponsiveness.ERK1/2 are activated by phosphorylation on both threonine and tyrosine residues by dual-specific kinases (MEK-1 and -2) (44.Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). Conversely, inactivation of ERKs is achieved by a number of DSPs that also appear to be critical regulators of ERKs activity. Unlike other DSPs, MKP-3 (also called Pyst1 and rVH6) is exclusively localized in the cell cytoplasm, where it physically associates with and selectively inactivates ERKs. Expression of MKP-3 has been implicated in controlling the cytoplasmic retention of ERK (18.Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J.

Forced expression of a mutant of MKP-3, inactive in its catalytic domain, in NIH 3T3 cells, is able to prevent ERK translocation from the cytosol into the nucleus, showing that the binding of MKP-3 to ERK is sufficient to prevent ERK translocation (18.Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Here we show that, in contrast to parental PC12 cells, in PC12/MEN2A and PC12/MEN2B cells, MKP-3 is steadily expressed at levels that are even higher than those found in the NGF-stimulated parental cells. Consistently treating cells with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, orthovanadate, results in further enhancement of the ERK activity, thus suggesting that the ERK levels of activation observed in these cells likely result from the balance between chronic activation induced by the active Ret oncogenes and inactivation of ERK phosphatases. Even though the presence of high levels of MKP-3 implicates this ERK-specific phosphatase in balancing Ret-induced activation, this phosphatase will be not the only candidate. Indeed, down-regulation of ERK activity is a still poorly understood mechanism that likely implicates the convergent action of distinct enzymatic activities, including the dual specificity phosphatases.Taken together, the data presented are consistent with the existence inret-transfected cells of a negative regulatory feedback caused by Ret-induced chronic stimulation of the Ras-MAPK cascade. For instance, we propose that either oncogenic variant of ret(either MEN-2A or MEN-2B) might induce high levels of ERKs which in turn cause a number of events, including high steady-state levels of MKP-3 transcripts, whose final consequences would be lack of terminal differentiation and unresponsiveness to NGF (see Fig. 8,A–C).Moreover, since expression of active mutant variants of MEK-1 is sufficient for terminal differentiation in the PC12 (15.Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar), as a necessary corollary to this scenario we expect that a strong stimulation of ERKs by a similar MEK-1 mutant should overcome such a block and induce terminal differentiation.Thus, the fact that stimulating ERK phosphorylation with a constitutive active mutant of MEK-1 (N3-S218E-S222D) is sufficient to rescue both c-fos transcription and inhibition of cell proliferation well supports the hypothesis that Ret-induced unresponsiveness to NGF cells may be the consequence of down-regulatory signals acting on either MAPK or MEK-1. Indeed, it is conceivable that the constitutive active MEK-1 might be insensitive to such signals, thus causing a strong stimulation of ERKs and overcoming the negative regulation acting on ERKs in ret-transfected cells (Fig.8 D).Even though the only known substrates for MEK-1 are ERK-1 and ERK-2, we cannot rule out that induction, by the active ret oncogene, of other enzymatic activities also participate in the abrogation of terminal differentiation.The presence of a negative feedback acting on ERKs as a mechanism involved in the resistance to the antiproliferative effects induced by NGF seems to be a mechanism triggered by Ret mutants (either RetC634Y or RetM918T), which is substantially indifferent to the kind of activating mutations of these oncogenes. The more pronounced difference between PC12/MEN2A and PC12/MEN2B cells concerns the ability to induce the fosCAT promoter. In fact, MEK-1 expression induces transcription from the exogenous c-fospromoter in both cell lines, but the levels of induction were distinctly higher in the PC12/MEN2B as compared with the PC12/MEN2A cells. A likely explanation for such differences might be that the M918T mutation causes a shift in Ret substrate specificity (46.Songyang Z. Carraway III, K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Indeed, even though we currently have no further experimental data supporting this possibility, a possible interpretation is that involvement of distinct enzymatic activities (triggered by the Ret-2A mutant) converging on ERK signaling may partially interfere with expression driven by the c-fos promoter. On the other hand, despite the fact that in PC12/MEN2A cells MEK-1 induces at low efficiency the exogenous c-fos promoter, its signaling was nonetheless sufficient to block proliferation, as assessed by BrdUrd incorporation. Taken together, these data support the idea that a similar mechanism is responsible for the lack of terminal differentiation in ret-2A- as inret-2B-transfected PC12 cells, although the use of differentret mutants reveals possible signaling differences triggered by each of these mutants.In conclusion, we propose the chronic activation of ERK by Ret mutants to be implicated in the unresponsiveness of ret-transfected cells to antiproliferative extracellular signals stimulated by NGF. Moreover, since the utilization of the MAPK pathway is a branch point common to many extracellular signals, this is probably a general biochemical mechanism by which Ret mutants contribute to the hyperplasia of the chromaffin cells in MEN-2 syndromes. Ret is a receptor tyrosine kinase whose expression is restricted to neuronal cells of the central and peripheral nervous system. Recently four ligands have been described for this receptor as follows: glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, neurturin, artemin, and persephin (1.Rosenthal A.

Missense mutations at one of five cysteine residues (Cys-609, -611, -618, -620, and -634) clustered in the extra cytoplasmic domain of ret are the most frequent causative genetic events of familial medullary thyroid carcinoma and the MEN-2A syndrome (8.Ponder B.A.J.

The 3′-TE exhibited the unique feature of modulating the use of FGF-2 alternative initiation codons, which favored the relative expression of CUG-initiated isoforms. Interestingly, the use of an alternative polydenylation site removing the 3′-TE was detected in skin fibroblasts in response to heat shock and cell density variations.

The five FGF-2 isoforms only differ by their N-terminal region, as their synthesis results from a process of alternative initiation of translation at five in-frame codons. A canonical AUG codon gives rise to the smallest 18-kDa isoform, whereas three upstream CUG start codons (CUG1, CUG2, and CUG3) give rise to FGF-2 isoforms of 22, 22.5, and 24 kDa (16.Florkiewicz R.Z.

A fourth CUG codon (CUG0) located close to the mRNA 5′ end has very recently been shown to initiate the synthesis of a bigger isoform of 34 kDa (3.Arnaud E. Touriol C. Boutonnet C. Gensac M.C.

The use of these different start codons is controlled by cis-acting elements present in the mRNA leader sequence (18.Prats A.C. Vagner S. Prats H. Amalric F. Mol. Cell.

One of these elements, identified as an internal ribosome entry site, enables the FGF-2 mRNA to be translated independently of the classical cap-dependent scanning mechanism (19.Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar, 20.Vagner S. Gensac M.C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). However the internal ribosome entry site allows expression of the 18–24-kDa isoforms, whereas that of the 34-kDa isoform is exclusively cap-dependent (3.Arnaud E. Touriol C. Boutonnet C. Gensac M.C. Vagner S. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Regulation of the alternative initiation of translation of FGF-2 mRNA is tightly related to cell physiology: the isoforms initiated at CUG1, CUG2, and CUG3 are constitutively expressed in transformed cells, whereas their expression in normal cells is inducible by stress and low cell density (21.Vagner S. Touriol C. Galy B. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Amalric F. Bayard F. Prats H. Prats A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22.Galy B. Maret A. Prats A.C. Prats H. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 165-171PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in nontransformed cells, this translational mechanism allows FGF-2 expression to be regulated very quickly in response to exogenous stimuli. Several species of FGF-2 mRNA from 1 to 7 kilobases in size and resulting from alternative polyadenylations are expressed (23.Bensaid M. Malecaze F. Prats H. Bayard F. Tauber J.P. Exp. Eye Res. 1989; 45: 801-813Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24.Knee R.S. Pitcher S.E. Murphy P.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). 90% of the longest mRNA (6775 nt) is composed of untranslated regions (UTRs) or alternatively translated regions with a GC-rich leader of 484 nucleotides (upstream from the AUG codon) and a huge AU-rich 3′-UTR of 5823 nucleotides (3.Arnaud E.

Numerous reports have demonstrated the involvement of the eukaryotic mRNA 3′-UTR in post-transcriptional regulations. Such regulations can occur at the level of mRNA subcellular localization, stability, or translation initiation (25.Wickens M. Anderson P. Jackson R.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In particular, translation regulation by cis-acting signals in the mRNA 3′-UTR plays an essential role during the development of a wide variety of organisms (26.Curtis D. Lehmann R. Zamore P.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 171-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Several somatic cell messengers are translationally regulated by cis-acting elements present in their 3′-UTR, which are mostly translational repressors. However, a translation activatory effect of 3′-UTRs has been described for a small number of mRNAs, mostly of viral origin but including two human messengers, the amyloid precursor protein and the lipoprotein lipase (27.de Sauvage F. Kruys V. Marinx O. Huez G. Octave J.N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3099-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28.Ranganathan G. Ong J.M. Yukht A. Saghizadeh M. Simsolo R.B. Pauer A. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7149-7155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The unusual length of the FGF-2 mRNA 3′-UTR, together with its eight alternative length-modifying polyadenylation sites, prompted us to determine its regulatory role in FGF-2 isoform expression. Because previous studies had shown that FGF-2 expression was regulated in primary cells but not in transformed cells, we used primary human skin fibroblasts to carry out this study. We identify here a unique translational enhancer (3′-TE) just upstream from the eighth poly(A) site. This translational enhancer, composed of two distinct domains, was able to modulate the alternative initiation of translation. Interestingly, the use of an alternative poly(A) site removing the 3′-TE was generated by heat shock and cell density increase in human skin fibroblasts. The pCAT and p5′ CAT series of plasmids (see Fig. 1) have been described previously (3.Arnaud E. Touriol C. Boutonnet C. Gensac M.C. Vagner S. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell.

PCAT-A8ΔTE2 was obtained by subcloning the SwaI-BspEI fragment of pCAT-A8 into pCAT-A0 digested by BstEI plus SmaI (see Fig. 2). For pCAT-A8ΔTE1, theNsiI-Klenow-AvrII fragment of pCAT-A8 was subcloned into pCAT-A8 digested by AvrII plus SwaI. TheNsiI-Klenow-BspEI fragment of pCAT-A8 was introduced into pCAT-A0 digested by BspEI plusSmaI to obtain pCAT-TE. PCAT-TE1 was obtained by introducing the NsiI-SwaI-Klenow fragment of pCAT-A8 into aSmaI-digested pCAT-A0. PCAT-TE2 was obtained by subcloning the SwaI-BspEI fragment of pCAT-A8 into pCAT-A0 digested by BspEI plus SmaI. TheEcl136II-HindII fragment of pCAT-TE was inserted into SmaI-digested pCAT-A0 to obtain pCAT-TEc. Plasmid pCAT-TE was treated by SphI-HindII-Klenow and religated to obtain pCAT-TEΔc. PKS-TE and -TE1 plasmids (see Fig. 4) were obtained by subcloning fragments NsiI-XbaI and NsiI-SwaI from plasmid pSCT-DOG into pKS digested byPstI plus XbaI or PstI plusEcl136II, respectively.Figure 2Characterization of the FGF-2 3′-TE. A, chimeric CAT mRNAs with different deletions or fragments of the FGF-2 3′-UTR were used to transfect human skin fibroblasts as in Fig. 1. CAT-A8ΔTE1 and ΔTE2 mRNAs were derived from CAT-A8 by removal of nt 5403–6082 (TE1) and nt 6082–6775 (TE2) counting from FGF-2 mRNA 5′, respectively. CAT-TE, -TE1, and -TE2 mRNAs bear the 1370-nt fragment located between A4 and A8 (nt 5403–6775), the TE1 or the TE2 fragments, respectively, downstream from the CAT sequence. CAT-TEC mRNA bears nt 5599–6260 of FGF-2 mRNA, whereas mRNA CAT-TEΔC bears the TE element with a central deletion of nt 5901–6356. The presence or absence of the FGF-2 5′-UTR is indicated on the top of the panels. B andC correspond to transfection of human skin fibroblasts by the CAT mRNA series (without FGF-2 5′-UTR) and the 5′-CAT mRNA series (with FGF-2 5′ leader called here UTR), respectively, as in Fig.1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Targeting the FGF-2 mRNA translational enhancer with antisense RNAs.

B, AS RNAs targeting the TE, TE1, or TE2 elements (AS4, AS5 and AS6, respectively) were synthesized in vitro and used in a 3- or 10-fold excess in skin fibroblast co-transfection with CAT or 5′ CAT-A8, -A0, -TE, -TE1, or -TE2 mRNAs. RNA-RNA hybridization was obtained by denaturing the mix of CAT mRNA with AS RNA for 2 min at 95 °C in H2O and adding culture medium before returning slowly to 20 °C. The RNA hybrids were used for skin fibroblast RNA transfection as in Fig. 1. 2 pmol of luciferase mRNA were used as internal standard in each co-transfection experiment to calibrate transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested 8 h after transfection for measurements of CAT and LUC activities. Histograms correspond to CAT/LUC activities obtained with the different transfected RNA hybrids.

Total cellular RNA was extracted using RNAble (Eurobio), as described previously (29.Touriol C. Morillon A. Gensac M.-C. Prats H. Prats A.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21402-21408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared with the Dynabeads® mRNA direct kit (Dynal France). Cell monolayers were lysed with the binding buffer and incubated with Dynabeads oligo(dT)25 for 5 min. The mRNAs were isolated by magnetic separation, then washed, and treated with the Dynal magnetic concentrator. Northern blotting was performed using the NorthernMaxTM kit provided by Ambion. DNA probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP using a random priming Multiprime kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Poly(A)+ cellular RNA (5 μg/lane) was subjected to electrophoresis through 1.2% formaldehyde/agarose gels, electrotransferred to HybondN nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized in the conditions described by the manufacturer. The potential role of the FGF-2 mRNA 3′-UTR in translation regulation was studied by introducing five of the different FGF-2 mRNA 3′-UTRs (measuring 83, 2390, 3073, 4446, and 5823 nt, respectively) downstream from the CAT reporter gene (Fig.1, A and B). The CAT sequence followed by the various 3′-UTRs was also fused downstream from the FGF-2 mRNA leader sequence to evaluate the possibility of interactions between the 5′ and the 3′ regions of FGF-2 mRNA. These constructs were made in a Bluescript KS derived vector with a 70-nt-long poly(A), downstream from the T3 promoter. Capped and polyadenylated CAT mRNAs were transcribed in vitro and used for cell transfection. In this way we were able to avoid interference from the alternative polyadenylation process and analyze the expression of one mRNA species at a time. Human skin fibroblast cells were transfected with the CAT mRNAs bearing the different FGF-2 3′-UTRs, with or without the FGF-2 mRNA 5′-region. CAT mRNA expression was first analyzed by CAT activity measurement (Fig. 1, C and D); CAT-A1 mRNA with the shortest 3′-UTR was efficiently expressed, in comparison to the CAT-A0 control, whereas CAT-A2, -A3, and -A4 mRNA expressions were very inefficient (Fig. 1 C). The same profiles were obtained in the presence of the FGF-2 mRNA leader (Fig.1 D). The measurement of mRNA half-life indicated that these different CAT activities resulted from the presence of a destabilizing element located between the first and second poly(A) sites, as already shown in a recent report (Fig. 1, C andD, on the right; Ref. 29.Touriol C. Morillon A. Gensac M.-C. Prats H. Prats A.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21402-21408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the expression of CAT-A8 mRNA was two times greater than that of CAT-A4 despite the slightly shorter half-life time (Fig.1 C). In the presence of the FGF-2 mRNA 5′ leader, this phenomenon was even more significant, 5′ CAT-A8 expression being about 5-fold higher than that of 5′ CAT-A4 (Fig. 1 D). These observations suggested that a translation activatory element, active in human skin fibroblasts and more efficient in the presence of the FGF-2 mRNA 5′ leader, was present in the 1370-nt fragment located between the fourth and the eighth poly(A) sites of FGF-2 mRNA (called 3′-TE hereafter and corresponding to nt 5403–6775 of the FGF-2 cDNA). Two series of constructs were produced and used for RNA transfection in human skin fibroblasts to map this element (Fig. 2 A). First the 5′ and the 3′ halves of the 1370-nt fragment (called TE1 and TE2 and corresponding to nt 5403–6082 and to nt 6082–6775, respectively) were deleted. The 2-fold increase observed with CAT-A8 compared with CAT-A4 was lost upon deletion of either TE1 or TE2 (Fig. 2 B, CAT-A8-ΔTE2 and -ΔTE1). In the presence of the FGF-2 mRNA leader, deletion of the TE1 or TE2 element resulted in loss of about 50% of the 5-fold enhancing effect (Fig. 2 C). The 1370-nt-long TE fragment or one of its subfragments, TE1 or TE2, was therefore added just downstream from the CAT sequence. The results showed that the TE fragment was able to promote a 9-fold activation of CAT translation, whereas this enhancing effect increased to 12-fold in the presence of the FGF-2 mRNA 5′ (Fig. 2, B andC, CAT-TE). The TE1 and TE2 fragments were each responsible for about 50% of the enhancing effect, both in the absence and in the presence of the FGF-2 mRNA 5′ leader (CAT-TE1 and -TE2). The central part of the TE element (nt 5599–6260) did not have any enhancing effect on its own, and deletion of a TE internal fragment (between nt 5901 and 6356) did not affect TE activity (Fig.4 B, CAT-TEC and -TEΔC). The mRNA half-life was also measured for the different mRNAs transfected in Fig. 2. This experiment clearly showed that addition or deletion of part or all of the 3′-TE element had no significant effect on mRNA stability (Fig. 3) and allowed us to affirm that the effect of the FGF-2 3′-TE element occurs at the translational level. The alternative approach was to co-transfect the CAT mRNA with antisense RNAs (Fig. 4). Three AS RNAs, complementary either to the complete 1370-nt TE element (Fig. 4 A, AS 4) or to one of its subfragments TE1 and TE2 (AS 5 and AS 6, respectively) were synthesized in vitro. These AS RNAs were prehybridized in a 3- or 10-fold excess to CAT mRNAs bearing either the complete 3′-UTR or the TE, TE1 or TE2 3′ fragment before skin fibroblast transfection. A control luciferase mRNA was also co-transfected to calibrate the transfection experiments. As shown in Fig. 4 B, AS RNAs were able to block the translation activation of CAT mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore the blockade was specific; none of the AS RNAs had any effect on expression of the control CAT mRNA (Fig. 4 B, CAT-A0). Expression of CAT mRNA with either the complete 3′-UTR or the TE element was inhibited by all three AS RNAs (CAT-A8 and CAT-TE). In contrast CAT-TE1 mRNA was down-regulated only by AS RNA4 and 5, whereas CAT-TE2 was down-regulated only by AS RNA4 and 6 (CAT-TE1 and CAT-TE2). Similar results were obtained with CAT mRNAs bearing the FGF-2 5′mRNA leader (Fig. 4 B, right panels). The stability of the co-transfected mRNAs was measured to rule out the possibility that the AS RNAs might affect RNA stability rather than translation. Fig. 4 C shows that the presence of one or other competitor had no influence on mRNA stability. In conclusion, both deletion and antisense approaches demonstrate the presence of a translational enhancer within the distal 1370 nt of the FGF-2 mRNA 3′-UTR, between the fourth and eighth poly(A) sites. This TE is specifically active in human primary skin fibroblasts and seems to be composed of two separate elements (TE1 and TE2) with a cumulative effect. The FGF-2 3′-TE was especially active in the presence of the FGF-2 mRNA leader (Fig. 1). Because this leader contains five alternative start codons (3.Arnaud E. Touriol C. Boutonnet C. Gensac M.C. Vagner S. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 17.Prats H. Kaghad M. Prats A.C. Klagsbrun M. Lélias J.M. Liauzun P. Chalon P.

A. 1989; 86: 1836-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), we looked for selective activation of one or more initiation codons by the 3′-TE, which would result in a modulation of the protein isoforms ratio. Human skin fibroblasts were transfected by 5′ CAT mRNAs either devoid of 3′-UTR or containing the 3′-TE element (see Fig. 6, 5′ CAT-A0 and 5′ CAT-TE, respectively). To evaluate the ratio of the FGF-CAT isoforms rather than the global activation, equivalent amounts of global CAT activity (measured in cpm) from each transfection assay were analyzed by Western immunoblotting with anti-CAT antibodies (Fig.5). The results showed that the TE element favored the expression of the CUG-initiated isoforms. Thus the TE element, in addition to its enhancing effect on global translation, was able to modulate the balance of the different FGF-2 isoforms.Figure 5Analysis of FGF-2 3′-TE influence on FGF-CAT isoform expression. 5′ CAT-A0 and 5′ CAT-TE mRNAs were used for skin fibroblast transfection as in Fig. 3. In addition to CAT activity measurement, cell extracts were analyzed by Western immunoblotting using anti-CAT antibody (see “Experimental Procedures.”). The same CAT activity equivalent of each sample was run on the 12.5% polyacrylamide gel to evaluate variations in the isoform ratio rather than the global activation already shown in Fig.3. The percentage of CUG- and AUG-initiated forms in relation to the total FGF-CAT expression is shown by histograms under each lane. The migration of the different isoforms (CUG1, CUG2/3, and AUG) is indicated. The CUG0-initiated isoform was not detectable in these experiments. This experiment was repeated at least five times, and the picture corresponds to a representative experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have shown in previous reports that expression of the FGF-2 CUG-initiated forms, although constitutive in transformed cells, was modulated in human skin fibroblasts in response to stress and to cell density (21.Vagner S. Touriol C. Galy B. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Amalric F. Bayard F. Prats H. Prats A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22.Galy B. Maret A. Prats A.C. Prats H. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 165-171PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of the FGF-2 3′-TE on alternative initiation of translation observed in Fig. 5 prompted us to look for a putative change in the FGF-2 mRNA 3′-UTR length in response to heat shock. We therefore analyzed the length of the endogenous FGF-2 mRNA 3′-UTR in skin fibroblasts in response to heat shock treatment (Fig.6). This was performed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or Northern blots using poly(A)+ mRNAs in the latter case (Fig. 6, Band C). Whereas both approaches clearly showed a decrease in the A8-cleaved mRNA as a function of heat shock duration, Northern blot showed that the A8 mRNA decrease was compensated by an increase in a 3.6-kb mRNA, probably corresponding to the A2-cleaved mRNA (Fig. 6 C, lanes 1–5). Thus, heat shock did not affect the total FGF-2 mRNA amount (as had been shown in a previous report (21.Vagner S. Touriol C. Galy B. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Amalric F. Bayard F. Prats H. Prats A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar)) but resulted in switch of the poly(A) site use from A8 to A2. We also looked at the polyadenylation profile in response to cell density variations. Human skin fibroblasts were seeded at increasing densities, and the corresponding poly(A)+mRNAs were analyzed by Northern blot. As shown in Fig.7 A (lanes 1–3) and consistently with a previous analysis made in RPE cells (30.Bost L.M. Hjelmeland L.M. Growth Factors. 1993; 9: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the large 7-kb FGF-2 mRNA disappeared at high cell density, whereas the 3.6-kb mRNA became apparent. Cell density increase was accompanied by a decrease of total mRNA accumulation, as described previously (22.Galy B. Maret A. Prats A.C. Prats H. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 165-171PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of endogenous FGF-2 proteins was analyzed in skin fibroblasts at different densities by Western immunoblotting. The CUG-initiated isoforms were detected at low but not at intermediary and high cell densities (Fig. 7 B), in concordance with previous observations (22.Galy B. Maret A. Prats A.C. Prats H. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 165-171PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, skin fibroblasts were transfected with FGF-CAT mRNAs having or lacking the 3′-TE (5′ CAT-TEΔC and 5′ CAT-A0, respectively). In both cases we observed a regulation of the CUG-initiated FGF-CAT expression that decreased when cell density increased (Fig. 7, C and D). However, at intermediary density, these isoforms were not expressed in the absence of 3′-TE (Fig. 7 C), where they were clearly detected in its presence (Fig. 7 D). In this report, we demonstrate the presence of 3′-TE in the distal part of the FGF-2 mRNA 3′-UTR, just upstream from the eighth poly(A) site. The 3′-TE, composed of two distinct structural domains (called TE1 and TE2), is able to modulate the alternative initiation of FGF-2 mRNA translation. Interestingly, the use of poly(A) site switches in response to heat shock and cell density (21.Vagner S. Touriol C. Galy B. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Amalric F. Bayard F. Prats H. Prats A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22.Galy B. Maret A. Prats A.C. Prats H. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 165-171PubMed Google Scholar). The correlation of 3′-TE removal with the disappearance of the CUG-initiated isoforms at increasing cell densities suggests a physiological role of the 3′-TE in the control of FGF-2 isoforms expression related to cell proliferation. The RNA transfection approach used in this study was crucial to study the translational control of an mRNA subjected to a process of alternative polyadenylation. This procedure enables us not only to get rid of interferences with the transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation processes but also to easily carry out mRNA half-life measurements to demonstrate that the observed effect occurred at the translational level. The presence of a translational enhancer in a cellular polyadenylated mRNA, which, in addition, regulates the alternative initiation of translation, is novel. An enhancing effect by the 3′-UTR has been observed for nonpolyadenylated histone mRNAs, the 3′ stem-loop of which mimics a poly(A) tail (31.Gallie D. Lewis N. Marzluff W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1954-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and for amyloid precursor protein and lipoprotein lipase mRNAs, which interestingly contain two alternative poly(A) sites (27.de Sauvage F. Kruys V. Marinx O. Huez G. Octave J.N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3099-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28.Ranganathan G. Ong J.M. Yukht A. Saghizadeh M. Simsolo R.B. Pauer A. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7149-7155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A few 3′ translational enhancers have also been characterized in uncapped and/or unpolyadenylated viruses. A pseudoknot-rich domain in tobacco mosaic virus mRNA 3′ plays a poly(A) tail role, and a translational enhancer that mimics a 5′ cap has been found in the barley yellow dwarf virus (32.Leathers V. Tanguay R. Kobayashi M. Gallie D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5331-5347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Wang S. Miller W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13446-13452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34.Wang S. Browning K.S. Miller W.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4107-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Two additional enhancers have recently been characterized in the 3′-UTRs of rotavirus and hepatitis C virus nonpolyadenylated mRNAs (35.Piron M. Vende P. Cohen J. Poncet D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5811-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 36.Ito T. Tahara S.M. Lai M.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8789-8796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rotavirus mRNA 3′-UTR binds the viral protein NSP3A and interacts with the eIF-4G factor, whereas the HCV 3′-TE binds the polypyrimidine tract binding protein, a cellular protein that also binds to the internal ribosome entry site located in 5′ of the messenger. Both 3′ enhancers appear to replace the poly(A) function, because they are involved in the generation of a physical link between the 3′ and 5′ mRNA ends (37.Wells S.E. Hillner P.E. Vale R.D. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 135-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of the FGF-2 3′-TE and viral 3′-TEs did not provide any interesting sequence similarity (not shown). However, the 18-nt sequence conserved among luteovirus (including barley yellow dwarf virus) was found in part at two positions of the FGF-2 3′-TE, one in the TE1 element and the other one in the TE2 element (not shown). The middle portion of this consensus has been proposed to base pair to a region of the 3′ end of 18 S rRNA (34.Wang S. Browning K.S. Miller W.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4107-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The viral 3′ translational enhancers concern mRNAs devoid of cap and/or of poly(A) tail. This makes it easy to understand that the function of such translational enhancers is to mimic either the cap or the poly(A). However, the FGF-2 mRNA is both capped and polyadenylated. Consequently the function of its translational enhancer must be more subtle. We show that the FGF-2 3′-TE not only activates global translation initiation but also modulates the relative use of the alternative initiation codons. Thus it modifies the balance between the different FGF-2 isoforms (Fig. 5). Given the different localizations and functions of these isoforms, such a function of the translational enhancer is of great importance. Interestingly, the FGF-2 3′-TE is active in primary skin fibroblasts but poorly efficient in COS-7, HeLa, and SK-Hep-1 cells (Ref. 29.Touriol C. Morillon A. Gensac M.-C. Prats H. Prats A.-C. J. Biol.

Furthermore the endogenous FGF-2 mRNA in these transformed cells mostly exhibits 3′-UTRs devoid of 3′-TE and thus cannot be subjected to the poly(A) site switch observed in skin fibroblasts (Ref. 29.Touriol C. Morillon A. Gensac M.-C. Prats H. Prats A.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21402-21408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar and Fig. 6). These observations point to a regulatory process working in normal cells but not in transformed cells. FGF-2 expression seems to be post-transcriptionally controlled at the three levels of polyadenylation, RNA stability and translation (Refs.18.Prats A.C. Vagner S. Prats H. Amalric F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4796-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Vagner S. Touriol C. Galy B. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Amalric F. Bayard F. Prats H. Prats A.C. J.

The existence of such concomitant post-transcriptional regulations concerns a growing number of messengers coding for regulatory proteins. Amyloid precursor protein mRNA, the translation of which is regulated by alternative polyadenylation, is also controlled at the stability level by one element of its 3′-UTR (27.de Sauvage F. Kruys V. Marinx O. Huez G. Octave J.N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3099-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 38.Zaidi S.H. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24007-24013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several other mRNAs are regulated at the translation and stability levels, whereas others are regulated by a coupled process of polyadenylation and stability. Furthermore VEGF mRNA expression, regulated at the levels of translation, stability, and possibly polyadenylation, is also controlled by a process of alternative splicing (39.Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This leads us to hypothesize that the genes coding for regulatory proteins, which are often regulated transcriptionally, are also controlled by several post-transcriptional mechanisms. These multiple control levels permit a subtle regulation of gene expression, which is very important for genes like FGF-2 whose abnormal expression has drastic consequences on cell proliferation and differentiation .

https://openalex.org/W2165905838,"The small GTP-binding protein ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) is an essential component of the molecular machinery that catalyzes the formation of membrane-bound transport intermediates. By using an in vitro assay that reproduces recruitment of cytosolic proteins onto purified, high salt-washed Golgi membranes, we have analyzed the role of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) on ARF1 incorporation. Addition to this assay of either pure catalytic subunits of PKA (C-PKA) or cAMP increased ARF1 binding. By contrast, ARF1 association was inhibited following C-PKA inactivation with either PKA inhibitory peptide or RIIα as well as after cytosol depletion of C-PKA. C-PKA also stimulated recruitment and activation of a recombinant form of human ARF1 in the absence of additional cytosolic components. The binding step could be dissociated from the activation reaction and found to be independent of guanine nucleotides and saturable. This step was stimulated by C-PKA in an ATP-dependent manner. Dephosphorylated Golgi membranes exhibited a decreased ability to recruit ARF1, and this effect was reverted by addition of C-PKA. Following an increase in the intracellular level of cAMP, ARF proteins redistributed from cytosol to the perinuclear Golgi region of intact cells. Collectively, the results show that PKA exerts a key regulatory role in the recruitment of ARF1 onto Golgi membranes. In contrast, PKA modulators did not affect recruitment of β-COP onto Golgi membranes containing prebound ARF1.

Like other Ras-related GTPases, ARF1 cycles between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound conformations. PosttranslationalN-myristoylation allows ARF1 to become inserted into membranes in a way that is coupled to the GDP-GTP conformational switch (4.Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Thus, inactive ARF-GDP is found in cytosol, whereas active ARF-GTP binds to intracellular membranes in a myristate-dependent manner. Activation depends on guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) that promote the exchange of GDP for GTP. Several GEFs specific for ARF have been identified (5.Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21431-21434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 6.Roth M.G. Cell. 1999; 97: 149-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). They all share a 200-amino acid region, referred to as the Sec7 domain, that is responsible for the exchange activity. However, the different ARF-specific GEFs differ in structural organization and sensitivity to brefeldin A, a drug that inhibits ARF1 activation and association to Golgi membranes (7.Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 8.Helms J.B. Rothman J.E.

It is well established that once bound to a membrane ARF1-GTP promotes the recruitment of cytosolic coat components, but the exact mechanism is controversial at present. According to one view, activated ARF1 interacts directly with coat proteins serving as a membrane anchor for them (10.Spang A. Matsuoka K. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11199-11204Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 11.Stamnes M. Schiavo G. Stenbeck G. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Brunner J. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4418-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), a component of the coatomer complex which along with ARF1 itself form the COPI coat (13.Serafini T. Orci L. Amherdt M. Brunner M.

Alternatively, the role of ARF1 in coat assembly has been proposed to be indirect. ARF1-GTP has been shown to activate phospholipase D, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic acid (16.Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Ktistakis et al. (17.Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) reported conditions in which, in the absence of ARF1, coatomer could still bind to Golgi membranes containing a high level of phosphatidic acid. Additionally to its role on coat recruitment and phospholipase D activation, ARF1 has been described very recently to control both sorting of cargo molecules into transport vesicles (18.Lanoix J. Ouwendijk J. Lin C. Stark A. Love H.D. Ostermann J. Nilsson T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4935-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and the phospholipid composition of the Golgi membranes (19.Godi A. Pertile P. Meyers R. Marra P. Di Tullio G. Lurisci C. Luini A. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Golgi membranes contain sites where ARF1-GTP insertion preferentially occurs with high affinity. Although how these docking sites are recognized is unknown at present it possibly involves ARF1 interaction with membrane molecules (20.Helms J.B. Palmer D.J. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 21.Traub L.M. Ostrom J.A. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 22.Zhu Y. Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1323-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Aluminum fluoride, an activator of heterotrimeric G proteins, promotes stable association of both ARF1 and coatomer to a subset of binding sites in the Golgi membranes (23.Finazzi D. Cassel D. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13325-13330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The opposite effect applies to G protein βγ subunits that inhibit ARF1 binding (24.Donaldson J.G. Kahn R.A. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R.D. Science. 1991; 254: 1197-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Direct interaction of ARF1 with Gβγ and Gαs has also been reported (25.Randazzo P.A. Terui T. Sturch S. Kahn R.A. J. Biol.

Kahn R.A. Di Tullio G. Luini A. Nature. 1993; 364: 818-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). ARF1 has also been described to interact with phosphoinositides (28.Randazzo P.A. J. Biol.

Collectively, these studies suggest that ARF1 recruitment and/or activation could be regulated by signal transduction molecules. We show in this report that cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) influences the interaction of ARF1 with the Golgi membranes. Addition of exogenous PKA catalytic subunits (C-PKA) increased binding of both cytosolic and recombinant ARF1 to purified Golgi membranes, whereas either depletion or inactivation of endogenous C-PKA decreased ARF1 binding. In addition, PKA activation caused ARF redistribution in intact cells. These data indicate that PKA exerts a key regulatory role in ARF1 recruitment from cytosol to intracellular membranes. Such effect explains the influence of PKA activity on protein transport processes along the exocytic (34.Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J.

In particular, we propose the existence of protein targets in the Golgi membranes that when phosphorylated by PKA act as high affinity sites for ARF1 binding. Mouse monoclonal antibody 1D9 recognizing ARF1, -3, -5, and -6 was a generous gift of Dr. R. A. Kahn (Emory University). M2 anti-FLAG and M3A5 anti-β-COP mouse monoclonal antibodies were from Sigma. A polyclonal antibody against bacterially expressed His-tagged Cα subunit of murine PKA (anti-C-PKA) was raised in rabbits. Antisera were subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation and affinity-purified on recombinant protein coupled to activated Sepharose 4 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against Golgi mannosidase II has been previously described (43.Velasco A. Hendricks L. Moremen K.W. Tulsiani D.R.P. Touster O. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein or rhodamine were from Tago (Burlingame, CA), and secondary antibodies conjugated to peroxidase were fromBIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). C-PKA and calphostin C were purchased from Calbiochem; PKI, forskolin, nucleotides, okadaic acid, and apyrase were from Sigma, and proteinase K and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Purified, recombinant RIIα was prepared as described previously (44.Martı́n M.E. Hidalgo J. Vega F.M. Velasco A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3869-3878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine brain cytosol was prepared according to Taylor et al. (45.Taylor T.C. Kahn R.A. Melançon P. Cell. 1992; 70: 69-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, brains were homogenized at 4 °C in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Supernatant was dialyzed extensively against 25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2), 25 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min to remove precipitates. To immunodeplete C-PKA, 6 ml of crude cytosol (9 mg/ml) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 3.5 mg of anti-C-PKA IgG and passed twice over a 4-ml protein A-Sepharose CL-4B column (Sigma). C-PKA-depleted cytosol was then concentrated to the original volume using an Ultrafree-10K (Millipore, Bedford, MA). For ARF depletion, 2 ml of concentrated cytosol (60 mg/ml) was fractionated at 24 ml/h on a Sephacryl S-200 column (60 × 2.6 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in cytosol buffer. Fractions that were shown by Western blotting to be depleted of ARF1 were pooled and concentrated at 7.5 mg/ml. A comparative immunoblotting analysis of the different cytosol preparations used is shown in Fig. 1. Intact Golgi stacks were prepared from rat liver as described (46.Slusarewicz P. Nilsson T. Hui N. Watson R. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated on ice with 3 m KCl for 10 min, recovered by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 20 min) on a 2 m sucrose cushion, resuspended in 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 25 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, at 1 mg/ml, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Recombinant baculovirus encoding human ARF1 tagged at the carboxyl terminus with the FLAG epitope was generated as described previously (47.Rosa J.L. Casaroli-Marano R.P. Buckler A.J. Vilaró S. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4262-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Sf9 insect cells (2 × 108) were infected with 0.1 plaque-forming unit/cell for 1 h. They were harvested 48 h after infection and lysed in 4 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 400 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 100 μm GDP, and protease inhibitors (5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml of each leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A). Cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 20 min), and the supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 ml of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma). Beads were rinsed three times with lysis buffer, and bound ARF1-FLAG was eluted with acid. Protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, concentrated at 0.2 mg/ml, and stored at −80 °C. Similar results to those reported in the present study with ARF1-FLAG were obtained with a myristoylated, untagged form of ARF1 expressed in bacteria and purified according to Liang and Kornfeld (48.Liang J.O. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4141-4148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Binding of either ARF1 or β-COP to Golgi membranes was assayed in 1.5-ml siliconized microcentrifuge tubes at 37 °C for 15 min according to a previously described method (48.Liang J.O. Kornfeld S. J.

The final volume of the assay was 50 μl. The reaction was stopped by transferring the tubes to ice and adding 1 ml of ice-cold assay buffer to each tube. Samples were transferred to new siliconized microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 20 min. Membranes were recovered on a 35-μl 2m sucrose cushion and transferred to new tubes. They were washed twice with assay buffer followed by solubilization in electrophoresis sample buffer. Proteins were reduced with 10 mm DTT and analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Immunoblots were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal Ultra Chemiluminescent Substrate, Pierce). 10-μl beads containing immunoabsorbed ARF1-FLAG were added to a reaction mixture consisting of 5 μg of Golgi membranes, 1 mm ATP, 1 mg/ml BSA, 250 pmol of [35S]GTPγS (1000 Ci/mmol) in a final volume of 50 μl of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 50 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 15 min in 1.5-ml siliconized microcentrifuge tubes. Samples were cooled on ice, and then 1 ml of ice-cold assay buffer was added to each tube, and the complete mixture was transferred to a new presiliconized microcentrifuge tube. Beads were washed twice with assay buffer before 35S quantitation by liquid scintillation counting. Samples lacking either Golgi membranes or ARF1-FLAG were similarly processed and used to determine background binding of [35S]GTPγS. COS-7 and NRK cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. In experiments involving treatment with forskolin, they were first preincubated in serum-free medium for 2 h at 37 °C. For subcellular fractionation, cells were pelleted, rinsed with cold PBS, and resuspended in 3 ml of PBS containing protease inhibitors. They were homogenized in a ball-bearing homogenizer. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at high speed (100,000 ×g, 1 h at 4 °C) to obtain a total microsomal pellet. Membranes were rinsed, lysed in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and the amount of protein determined before processing for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Cells grown on round glass coverslips were used for immunofluorescence. Microinjection was performed in complete culture medium containing 25 mm Hepes using an Eppendorf microinjection system (Hamburg, Germany). Cascade blue-conjugated bovine serum albumin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used as a coinjection marker. Cells to be processed for immunofluorescence were fixed in 3% (w/v) formaldehyde, prepared from paraformaldehyde, in PBS, rinsed with plain PBS first, and then with 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.05% (w/v) saponin in PBS (PBS/BSA/saponin). Incubation with antibodies, diluted in PBS/BSA/saponin, was performed in a moist chamber at 37 °C for 30 min. Coverslips were rinsed with PBS and mounted in 10% PBS, 90% glycerol. An in vitro binding assay was used to study recruitment of endogenous ARF1 from cytosol to the Golgi (48.Liang J.O. Kornfeld S. J. Biol.

Golgi membranes, deprived of peripheral proteins by high salt wash, were incubated at 37 °C with cytosol in the presence of ATP-generating system and GTPγS, which makes ARF binding relatively irreversible. Membranes were then reisolated, rinsed with buffer, and bound ARF1 detected by immunoblotting with 1D9 monoclonal antibody. While efficient recruitment of cytosolic ARF1 occurred during incubation of Golgi membranes with the other components, no apparent signal was detected when either membranes or cytosol were omitted from the incubation medium (Fig. 2). ARF1 binding was drastically reduced although not completely abolished (see below) in the absence of either ATP or GTPγS. The role of ATP was further investigated. ARF1 incorporation was increased 3–4-fold following preincubation for 30 min at 37 °C of crude cytosol with 10–20 μm okadaic acid, a specific serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor (Fig. 2). This suggested the involvement of protein kinase activities in ARF1 recruitment from cytosol. Accordingly, addition to this assay of exogenous, pure C-PKA slightly increased ARF1 binding. Thus, 8 units of C-PKA with a specific activity of 750 units/μg gave rise to a 1.5–2-fold increase (Fig.3 A). By contrast, addition of PKA regulatory (RIIα) subunits instead of catalytic subunits decreased ARF1 incorporation (Fig.4 B). C-PKA also increased 1.2–1.6-fold ARF1 binding to native, untreated Golgi membranes (not shown), but in order to evaluate the PKA effect high salt-washed membranes with little if any of prebound ARF1 were routinely used. Additionally, to assess further this effect cytosol was immunodepleted of C-PKA. As judged by immunoblotting, this cytosol preparation still contained ∼30% of the original C-PKA content with no apparent decrease in the presence of both ARF1 and β-COP (Fig. 1,lanes 1 and 2). In comparison with crude cytosol ARF1 incorporation was reduced to less than 10% of the original value when C-PKA depleted cytosol was used as a source of ARF1 in the binding assay (Fig. 3 A). Addition of exogenous C-PKA to this cytosol preparation, however, reestablished ARF1 recruitment. Thus, the level of ARF1 binding was comparable with both crude cytosol and C-PKA-depleted cytosol supplemented with 8 units of C-PKA. This implied a 33-fold increase in the case of C-PKA-depleted cytosol (Fig.3 B). To exclude the possibility that the stimulatory effect observed with C-PKA was due to a different serine/threonine protein kinase such as PKC the experiment was carried out in the presence of light-activated calphostin C which at the dose used, 2 μm, inhibits most PKC isoforms. As shown in Fig. 3 C-PKA stimulated ARF1 incorporation regardless of the presence or not of calphostin C in the incubation medium.Figure 4Effect of C-PKA inactivation on ARF1 recruitment from cytosol. The assay that reproduces ARF1 binding from crude cytosol was carried out.

Data represent average of three different experiments. They are expressed as percentage of the amount of ARF1 bound in the absence of any inhibitor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To reveal further the PKA effect, we used a peptide, PKI, containing the inhibitory sequence of the thermostable PKA inhibitor, a protein that functions as a natural, highly specific inhibitor of PKA activity (51.Walsh D.A. Angelos K.L. vanPatten S.M. Glass D.B. Garetto L.P. Kemp B.E. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 43-84Google Scholar). When added to the crude assay this 20-amino acid sequence caused significant inhibition of ARF1 binding (Fig. 4 A). Complete inhibition required a high (10–20 μm) concentration of PKI although a 56 ± 3% decrease was already observed at 1 nm (Fig. 4 B). Although it is possible that at high concentrations PKI has some nonspecific effects, the fact that considerable inhibition still occurred in the nanomolar range supported the involvement of PKA activity in ARF1 recruitment. In addition, PKI inhibition was comparable to that obtained with RIIα (Fig.4 C) consistent with the competitive interaction of both agents with the substrate-binding site of the kinase (52.Taylor S.S. Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Eyck L.F.T. Sowadski J.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 429-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The above data suggested that ARF1 recruitment could be regulated by PKA activity, and in that case, modulators of this kinase should modify its intracellular distribution. As a first indication we studied the effect of cAMP on the recruitment of endogenous ARF1 from crude cytosol. Addition of 5–10 μm cAMP increased ARF1 binding by 1.5-fold. By contrast, addition of AMP either had no effect or even slightly decreased ARF1 incorporation (Fig. 5). We next analyzed the in vivo relevance of this observation. COS-7 cells were microinjected with either cAMP to activate PKA or, alternatively, with AMP as a negative control. Cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence to determine the intracellular distribution of ARF proteins (Fig.6 A). Both noninjected and AMP-injected cells showed a typical diffuse, cytoplasmic staining pattern. In cAMP-injected cells, however, a significant amount of ARF was concentrated in the perinuclear region and showed extensive colocalization with the Golgi marker galactosyltransferase (not shown). Similarly, noninjected NRK cells treated with forskolin which activates adenylate cyclase showed ARF redistribution from cytosol to the Golgi where it showed colocalization with mannosidase II (Fig.6 B). ARF1 redistribution induced by forskolin was quantitated by immunoblotting analysis of total microsomal membranes. The amount of ARF1 associated to intracellular membranes in cells treated with 250 μm forskolin for 30 min doubled that in control cells (Fig. 6 C). Taken together these data support a regulatory role of PKA activity in ARF recruitment.Figure 6Effect of PKA activation in vivoon ARF intracellular distribution. A, COS-7 cells were microinjected with 10 μm of either cAMP or AMP mixed with 2 mg/ml cascade blue-conjugated BSA (BSA) used as co-injection marker.

Asterisks indicate noninjected cells. Bar, 25 μm. B and C, NRK cells were preincubated at 37 °C for 2 h in serum-free medium and then incubated or not (control) with 250 μm forskolin for 30 min.

More recently, a single Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-based plasmid vector containing both the latent origin of replication (oriP) of EBV and EBNA-1 has been shown to prolong the duration of luciferase and β-galactosidase gene expression following a single intrahepatic injection in mice (11Saeki Y. Wataya-Kaneda M. Tanaka K. Kaneda Y. Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, to do so, each of these vectors requires prolonged expression of either large T antigen or EBNA-1, which can potentially produce oncogenic (10Cooper M.J. Lippa M. Payne J.M.

Furthermore, replication-based episomal vectors appear to depend on the presence of actively dividing cells (10Cooper M.J. Lippa M. Payne J.M. Hatzivassiliou G. Reifenberg E. Fayazi B. Perales J.C.

A. 1997; 94: 6450-6455Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which comprise only a small fraction of cells present in post-natal hosts. We have shown that an EBV-based two-plasmid system can both significantly prolong the duration of gene expression produced by plasmid vectors and facilitate efficient repeated transfection in fully immunocompetent mice. One plasmid bears the FR (EBV family of repeats) sequence within the expression cassette, but lacks the region of dyad symmetry (referred to as DS) of oriP of EBV. The other contains the EBNA-1 gene, but lacks FR. EBNA-1 is a DNA-binding protein that binds in a site-specific fashion to sequences within EBV oriP. EBV oriPconsists of two non-continuous regions: FR, which contains ∼20 tandem imperfect copies of a 30-base pair sequence, and DS, which contains a 65-base pair element and is separated by ∼1000 base pairs from FR (15Reisman D. Yates J. Sugden B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1822-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The presence of both DS and FR are required in cis for stable replication (15Reisman D. Yates J.

Thus, FR may contribute to the association of FR-containing DNA with the nuclear matrix. We have determined both the duration and level of gene expression produced in mice by intravenous injection of CLDCs (22Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P.

Nature Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Paraffin-embedded lung sections were rehydrated in graded alcohols and rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (0.01 mol/liter, pH 7.4). For EBNA-1, microwave antigen retrieval was used with 0.01 mol/liter citrate acid buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 min. Rat monoclonal antibody against EBNA-1, clone 1H4-1 (rat IgG), was generously provided by Dr. Bill Sugden and incubated at a dilution of 1:40 overnight at 4 °C. Mouse anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) was diluted to 1:100 and also incubated overnight at 4 °C. Binding was labeled using biotinylated anti-rat (for EBNA-1) and anti-rabbit (for p53) antibodies (Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA), followed by streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) at 1:200. Peroxidase activity was visualized with diaminobenzidine (Sigma). Sections were counterstained with 1% methyl green. Double labeling for EBNA-1 and factor VIII was performed using a modified immunoperoxidase assay. In brief, after hydration, antigen retrieval was performed in a citrate buffer with microwaves. Rat anti-EBNA-1 antibody was applied first at a 1:4500 dilution at 4 °C overnight. Secondary biotinylated rabbit anti-rat antibody at a dilution of 1:50, an ABC Elite kit, and diaminobenzidine (all provided by Vector Labs, Inc.) were used for signal visualization. Slides were then pretreated with 0.025% trypsin (Life Technologies, Inc.), rinsed, blocked with normal goat serum, and incubated with anti-factor VIII/von Willebrand factor antibody (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA). Slides were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody, incubated with ABC, and visualized with aminoethylcarbazole (Biomeda, Foster City, CA). Slides were rinsed, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and coverslipped for microscopic analysis. Double labeling for EBNA-1 and cytokeratin was performed as described above, except that after the diaminobenzidine step, Histomouse blockers A and B (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were applied, followed by a mouse anti-cytokeratin monoclonal antibody, AE1/AE3 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). This was followed by biotinylated anti-mouse antibody (Vector Labs, Inc.), streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase, and AEC chromagen. We first assessed whether our EBV-based vector system could prolong gene expression relative to the CMV-luc expression plasmid containing two AAV inverted terminal repeat (ITR) sequences (35McCown T.J. Xiao X. Li J. Breese G.R. Samulski R.J. Brain Res. 1996; 713: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Specifically, we compared the amount of luciferase activity produced both 24 h and 7 days following a single intravenous injection of CLDCs containing (a) CMV-luc-FR-1 plus CMV-EBNA-1; (b) CMV-luc-FR-1 plus CMV-CAT (30Liu Y. Liggitt D. Zhong W. Tu G. Gaensler K. Debs R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24864-24870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar); or CMV-luc-AAV-ITR (35McCown T.J. Xiao X. Li J. Breese G.R. Samulski R.J. Brain Res. 1996; 713: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) plus CMV-CAT (obtained from Dr. J. Samulski), which contained flanking AAV ITR sequences. The CMV-luc-FR-1 plasmid, whether co-injected with either CMV-EBNA-1 or CMV-CAT, produced similar levels of luciferase activity in lungs and heart 24 h after administration (see Fig.2 A). (The lungs and heart are the organs most efficiently transfected following intravenous injection of CLDCs (9Thierry A.R. Lunardi-Iskandar Y. Bryant J.L. Rabinovich P. Gallo R.C. Mahan L.C. Proc.

At 24 h following injection, CMV-luc-AAV-ITR plus CMV-CAT produced somewhat higher peak levels of luciferase activity in lungs and heart than CMV-luc-FR-1 plus CMV-EBNA-1. However, 1 week after injection, mice co-injected with CMV-luc-FR-1 plus CMV-EBNA-1 expressed significantly more luciferase activity (p < 0.0005) than mice co-injected either with CMV-luc-FR-1 plus CMV-CAT or with CMV-luc-AAV-ITR plus CMV-CAT (see Fig. 2 A). Thus, CLDC-based intravenous co-injection of a CMV-EBNA-1 plasmid plus an FR-containing CMV-luc plasmid significantly prolonged luciferase gene expression compared either with the CMV-EBNA-1 plasmid plus a CMV-luc plasmid lacking FR or with a CMV-luc plasmid containing flanking AAV ITR sequences. Although the EBV-based plasmid vector system produced significantly more luciferase activity at day 7 than did the AAV-based vector, it is possible that differences in the vector backbones could have contributed to these observed differences in expression. Therefore, a modified EBV-based vector was generated to improve the level of gene expression it produced. We noted that p4329, our CMV-luc-FR-1 expression plasmid in which the FR sequences were inserted between the heterologous intron and the luciferase cDNA and which also contained the thymidine kinase promoter downstream of the HCMV promoter, produced peak tissue levels of luciferase activity ∼5-fold lower than comparable HCMV-based vectors (see Fig. 2 A). Since the presence of the thymidine kinase promoter as well as the position of FR within the vector could each potentially interfere with gene expression, we assessed luciferase activity produced by p4379 (CMV-luc-FR-2), an HCMV-IE1-based luciferase expression plasmid containing a 5′-heterologous intron in which we inserted FR downstream of the luciferase cDNA in a plasmid containing only the HCMV promoter (Fig. 1). We observed that placement of FR downstream of the coding sequence yielded a vector that produced peak levels of luciferase gene expression comparable to those of the parent HCMV-based vector lacking FR (data not shown). We then assessed the effects of intravenously co-injecting this more efficient CMV-luc-FR-2 plasmid (p4379) plus p4395, CMV-EBNA-1 (which lacks FR) (Fig. 1), on the duration of luciferase gene expression in mice. A single CLDC-based intravenous co-injection of CMV-luc-FR-2 plus CMV-EBNA-1 produced 1.9 ± 0.50 ng of luciferase/mg of tissue protein in the lungs and 0.4 ± 0.11 ng of luciferase/mg of tissue protein in the hearts of ICR mice killed 11 weeks later (Fig.2 B). These levels were significantly higher than the luciferase activity produced in the lungs (0.3 ± 0.11 ng of luciferase/mg of tissue protein;p < 0.005) and hearts (0.2 ± 0.01 ng of luciferase/mg of tissue protein; p < 0.05) of ICR mice killed 8 days after intravenous co-injection of CLDCs containing CMV-luc-FR-2 plus CMV-CAT. We showed that the luciferase activity produced 7 days after CLDC-based intravenous co-injection of CMV-luc-FR-1 plus CMV-CAT was similar to background levels present in uninjected mice (Fig. 2 A). Thus, a single CLDC-based intravenous co-injection of a CMV-EBNA-1 plasmid plus an FR-containing luciferase plasmid significantly increased luciferase activity in heart and lungs for at least the next 11 weeks, whereas luciferase activity had returned to very low levels in these organs within 1 week following injection of the FR-containing luciferase plasmid without EBNA-1. In these experiments, we used a derivative of the HCMV-IE1-driven expression plasmid (28Hartikka J. Sawdey M. Cornefert-Jensen F. Margalith M. Barnhart K. Nolasco M. Vahlsing H.L. Meek J. Marquet M.

Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1205-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) that produced therapeutic levels of erythropoietin for at least 90 days following a single intramuscular injection of the HCMV-IE1-erythropoietin plasmid alone (37Tripathy S.K.

However, we found that this same HCMV-IE1-based plasmid, in the absence of EBV FR plus the EBNA-1 gene, produced very low levels of luciferase activity even 7 days after a single CLDC-based intravenous injection. Only transient gene expression from similar HCMV-IE1-based expression plasmids following CLDC-based intravenous injection has been reported previously (9Thierry A.R. Lunardi-Iskandar Y. Bryant J.L.

We assessed whether repeated re-injection of the EBNA-1 gene would limit re-expression of a co-injected reporter gene. To maximize the host's exposure to the EBNA-1 gene product, we constructed p4458, CMV-luc-FR-CMV-EBNA-1, a single expression plasmid containing both the entire HCMV-EBNA-1 expression cassette from CMV-EBNA-1 and the full-length HCMV-luc-FR expression cassette from CMV-luc-FR-2 (Fig. 1). We used this single combined expression plasmid to determine whether EBNA-1 could mediate prolonged expression of luciferase following repeated systemic injection of the CMV-EBNA-1 plasmid into fully immunocompetent mice. The first group of mice were pre-injected with CMV-EBNA-1 plus CMV-CAT rather than with CMV-luc-FR-CMV-EBNA-1 to assess the effect of repeatedly injecting CMV-EBNA-1 on the subsequent re-expression of luciferase while avoiding potential anti-luciferase immune responses (39Mittal S.K.

https://openalex.org/W2036668049,"Examination of the structure of [Arg(8)]-vasopressin receptors (AVPRs) and oxytocin receptors (OTRs) suggests that G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and protein kinase C (PKC) are involved in their signal transduction. To explore the physical association of AVPRs and OTRs with GRKs and PKC, wild types and mutated forms of these receptor subtypes were stably expressed as green fluorescent protein fusion proteins and analyzed by fluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting. Addition of a C-terminal GFP tag did not interfere with ligand binding, internalization, and signal transduction. After agonist stimulation, PKC dissociated from the V(1)R, did not associate with the V(2)R, but associated with the V(3)R and the OTR. After AVP stimulation, only GRK5 briefly associated with AVPRs following a time course that varied with the receptor subtype. No GRK associated with the OTR. Exchanging the V(1)R and V(2)R C termini altered the time course of PKC and GRK5 association. Deletion of the V(1)R C terminus resulted in no PKC association and a ligand-independent sustained association of GRK5 with the receptor. Deletion of the GRK motif prevented association and reduced receptor phosphorylation. Thus, agonist stimulation of AVP/OT receptors leads to receptor subtype-specific interactions with GRK and PKC through specific motifs present in the C termini of the receptors."

Here, we identified a multi-copy suppressor gene of this phenotype, termed SSM1 (suppressor of 6-azauracil sensitivity of the S-II null mutant 1), that encodes a novel protein consisting of 280 amino acid residues. Although both theSSM1 null mutant and the S-II/SSM1 double null mutant were viable under normal growth conditions, they resembled theS-II null mutant in being sensitive to 6-azauracil. Expression of the SSM1 gene was found to be repressed in theS-II null mutant but was restored by overexpression of chimeric S-II molecules that were able to stimulate transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II in vitro. Furthermore, we identified two transcription arrest sites within the transcription unit of the SSM1 gene in vitro that could be relieved by S-II.

To investigate the cellular functions of S-II in eukaryotic transcription, we have been studying S-II from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (33Nakanishi T. Nakano A. Nomura K. Sekimizu K. Natori S.

By creating various deletion mutants of S-II, we found that the C-terminal 147 amino acid residues are sufficient for the stimulation of RNA polymerase II and suppression of 6-AU sensitivity (34Nakanishi T. Shimoaraiso M. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8991-8995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, by creating chimeric molecules of mouse and yeast S-II, we found that the region between Pro-131 and Phe-270 is responsible for the species-specific interaction of S-II and RNA polymerase II (35Shimoaraiso M. Nakanishi T. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26550-26554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the 6-AU sensitivity of theS-II null mutant is caused by loss of function of S-II as a transcription elongation factor. However, the target gene(s) for S-II that confers yeast resistance to 6-AU has not yet been identified. To gain more insight into the role of S-II in the sensitivity of yeast to 6-AU, we have identified a gene, SSM1, that suppresses sensitivity to 6-AU. We found that S-II enhances transcription of the SSM1 gene, resulting in suppression of the sensitivity of theS-II null mutant to 6-AU. The yeast S-II null mutant (TNY14) (34Nakanishi T. Shimoaraiso M. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8991-8995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was transfected with multi-copy type genomic clones of S. cerevisiae with an average insert size of 10 kilobase pairs constructed in YEp13 by the method of Gietz et al. (37Gietz D. Jean A.S. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). Clones that formed colonies on EMD (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% casamino acids technical and 2% glucose) plates containing 100 μg/ml of 6-AU were selected. To determine the gene responsible for the suppression of 6-AU sensitivity, various deletion mutants of the multi-copy clone that suppressed 6-AU sensitivity were created by PCR, subcloned into YEp13, and transfected to TNY14 to examine suppression of 6-AU sensitivity. Plasmids were recovered from the transformants by the method of Strathern and Higgins (38Strathern J.N. Higgins D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and sequenced. Transformed cells were cultured in EMD medium at 30 °C until the optical density at 600 nm reached about 2.0. Then 2.5 × 106 cells were transferred to 0.5 ml of fresh medium, incubated at 30 °C for 2 h, and then diluted 1000-fold with the medium. The cell suspension was spread on YNBD (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and 2% glucose) or YNBGS (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% casamino acids technical, 5% galactose, and 0.2% sucrose) plates with or without 100 μg/ml 6-azauracil. Colonies were examined after incubation at 30 °C for 5 days. NcoI and SalI sites were introduced to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the coding sequence of the SSM1 gene, respectively. The resulting DNA was ligated to aNcoI-SalI-digested pMYY4–3 containing theGAL1 promoter. The resulting plasmid was cloned and digested with BamHI and PstI, and the insert was ligated to a BamHI-PstI-digested pYO324 (39Ohya Y. Goebl M. Goodman L.E. Peterson-Bjorn S. Friesen J.D. Tamanoi F. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12356-12360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid was cloned again and transfected to TNY14, and the SSM1 gene was overexpressed under the control of the GAL1 promoter. The procedure was essentially the same as that used for the construction of the S-II null mutant (34Nakanishi T. Shimoaraiso M. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8991-8995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The SSM1 gene was replaced by a selectable marker URA3 by a PCR knockout strategy (40Baudin A.

Total cellular RNA was extracted from yeast (42Piper P.W. Curran B.P.G. Curr. Genet. 1990; 17: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and samples of 10 μg of RNA were subjected to 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis. Then the RNA was transferred to a nitrocellulose filter (Schleicher & Schuell). The filter was baked at 80 °C and hybridized with a 32P-labeled probe (the PCR product of the +1- to +843-bp fragment of the SSM1 gene) for 15 h at 42 °C. It was then washed twice with 2× SSC (1× SSC = 150 mm sodium chloride, 15 mmsodium citrate) containing 0.1% SDS for 15 min and once with 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 10 min at 45 °C. This was done essentially as described by Christie et al. (43Christie K.R. Awrey D.E. Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 936-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using 3′- deoxycytidine-extended templates (44Kadesch T.R. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5286-5295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) derived from the fragments of the SSM1 gene. The fragments of the SSM1 gene used were −163 to +227 (fragment 1), +1 to +408 (fragment 2), +300 to +746 (fragment 3), and +514 to +917 (fragment 4), where +1 indicates the first letter of the first Met codon in the SSM1 cDNA. These fragments were amplified, subcloned into theBamHI-XbaI sites of pGEM-3Z, and used as templates for detection of transcription arrest sites. Previously, we found that when the yeast S-II gene was disrupted, the resulting S-IInull mutants became sensitive to 6-AU (34Nakanishi T. Shimoaraiso M. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8991-8995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 36Hubert J.-C. Guyonvarch A. Kammerer B. Exinger F. Liljelund P. Lacroute F. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 2071-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, we looked for genes that suppress the 6-AU sensitivity of S-II null mutants. For this, we transfected multi-copy type genomic clones ofS. cerevisiae with an average insert size of 10 kilobase pairs constructed in YEp13 into TNY14 (an S-II null mutant) and isolated the colonies formed on a plate containing 100 μg/ml 6-AU. Of 91,000 transformants examined, 11 clones were resistant to 6-AU. Southern blot analysis of plasmids recovered from these clones using S-II cDNA as a probe revealed that 8 of the 11 clones were transfected with S-II DNA. Restriction maps of the plasmids recovered from the remaining three clones were identical, indicating that these clones were the same (data not shown). We further analyzed this plasmid (pR1), which contained a 12-kilobase pair insert. To restrict the region of pR1 needed to suppress the 6-AU sensitivity of TNY14, we created various deletion mutants of pR1 and examined whether they were able to suppress 6-AU sensitivity. As shown in Fig.1, we first examined four clones (pR3, pR5, pR14, and pR15) and found that pR5 and pR14 suppressed 6-AU sensitivity. As pR14 was a part of pR5, we further prepared four deletion mutants of pR14 (pR17, pR22, pR23, and pR27) and found that pR17 was sufficient for the suppression of 6-AU sensitivity. We determined the nucleotide sequence of pR17 and found that it contained an ORF encoding 280 amino acid residues. We named this protein SSM1 (Fig. 2). A putative TATA box and a poly(A) addition signal were found to be located at the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of the ORF, respectively. A computer search revealed that the amino acid sequence of SSM1 was 100% identical with that encoded by YGL224C, whose function has not yet been determined. Thus, YGL224C is the original gene name for SSM1. It also showed 67% similarity with that encoded byYER037W.Figure 2Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the SSM1 gene. The deduced amino acid sequences of SSM1 is shown below the nucleotide sequence. Numbers of nucleotides are shown to the left of each row, starting from the first nucleotide of pR17. TATA box-like sequences and putative poly(A) addition sequences are indicated by white letters.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether in fact SSM1 has the ability to suppress 6-AU sensitivity, we overexpressed the SSM1 gene in TNY14 under the control of the GAL1 promoter. As shown in Fig.3, TNY14 expressing SSM1 formed colonies on a plate containing 6-AU, indicating that SSM1 is responsible for conferring 6-AU resistance to TNY14. We examined whether SSM1 is essential for the growth of yeast. For this, we replaced the SSM1 gene of uracil− TNY04 by the URA 3 gene (Fig.4 A). Colonies formed on synthetic complete medium lacking uracil were examined for disruption of the SSM1 ORF by PCR using two primers corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of the SSM1 gene. As shown in Fig. 4 B, a single 1556-bp band was detected with the deletion mutant, and a single 1100-bp band was detected with TNY04, confirming that the deletion mutant is an SSM1 null mutant. As shown in Fig.4 C, this SSM1 null mutant formed colonies under standard growth conditions, indicating that the SSM1 gene is not essential for growth. However, like the S-II null mutant (TNY14), the SSM1 null mutant was sensitive to 6-AU and formed no colonies on the plate containing 6-AU. Similarly, theS-II/SSM1 double null mutant also formed colonies under normal growth conditions but formed no colonies in the presence of 6-AU (data not shown). Furthermore, the 6-AU sensitivity of theSSM1 null mutant was suppressed by overexpression of SSM1 but not by overexpression of S-II (Fig.5). These results suggest that SSM1 functions downstream of S-II in the suppression of 6-AU sensitivity and that S-II participates in the transcription of the SSM1 gene.Figure 56-AU sensitivity of the transformants over expressing the SSM1 or S-II genes in the SSM1 null mutant. TNY04/ssm1 ::URA3 (SSM1null mutant) and transformants of TNY14 in which the SSM1 gene or the S-II gene was overexpressed were examined for formation of colonies on YNBGS plates with 100 μg/ml 6-AU.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the relationship between S-II and transcription of the SSM1 gene, we performed Northern blot analysis of SSM1 mRNA in both wild type and S-II null mutant strains using SSM1 cDNA as a probe. As shown in Fig. 6, the intensity of the band of SSM1 mRNA was significantly less in theS-II null mutant than in the wild type strain irrespective of culture time, indicating that S-II enhances expression of the SSM1 gene. Previously, we demonstrated by using chimeric S-II molecules that residues 132–270 of yeast S-II are indispensable for its specific interaction with homologous RNA polymerase II (35Shimoaraiso M. Nakanishi T. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26550-26554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, to examine whether a specific interaction of S-II and RNA polymerase II is indispensable for S-II to enhance the expression of the SSM1 gene, we separately expressed four chimeric S-II molecules in theS-II null mutant. These chimeric S-II molecules are the same as those we used previously to demonstrate a species-specific interaction between S-II and RNA polymerase II (Fig.7 A). We have shown that almost equivalent amounts of chimeric S-II molecules are generated when cDNAs for these molecules are expressed in an Escherichia coli expression system, as determined by immunoblotting (35Shimoaraiso M. Nakanishi T. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26550-26554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7 B, expression of the SSM1 gene in TNY14 was enhanced only when wild type S-II or EYE was introduced. Introduction of mouse S-II or YEY did not seem to cause appreciable enhancement of SSM1 gene transcription. To quantify the transcription of the SSM1 gene in these transformants, intensity of the signals in Fig. 7 B was scanned, and the amounts relative to that in the wild type strain were calculated (TableI). Level of SSM1 mRNA in TNY14 was less than 13 of that in the wild type strain. This level was increased to the wild type strain level when Y or EYE was introduced, but introduction of E or YEY did not change this level. These results clearly indicate that the function of yeast S-II as a transcription elongation factor is indispensable for enhanced expression of the SSM1 gene in TNY14.Table IRelative contents of SSM1 mRNA in chimeric S-II transformantsWild typeS-II null mutantYEEYEYEY1.000.291.130.260.960.36Intensity of the bands for SSM1 mRNA in Fig. 7 B was scanned with IMAGE QUANT™ (Molecular Dynamics). Open table in a new tab Intensity of the bands for SSM1 mRNA in Fig. 7 B was scanned with IMAGE QUANT™ (Molecular Dynamics). We examined whether possible transcription arrest sites are present in the transcription unit of the SSM1 gene in vitro. The transcription unit of the SSM1 gene was divided into four fragments. Each fragment was amplified by PCR, a poly(dC) tail was added at its 3′-end, and it was used as a template for transcription by RNA polymerase II. As shown in Fig.8, two bands of 105 and 115 bases, respectively, were detected as well as the run off transcript of 390 bases when fragment 1 was used as a template. These bands represent RNA molecules arrested at specific blocks to elongation in fragment 1. No such premature transcripts were detected when the other three fragments were employed. Because only fragment 1 contains the 5′-upstream region of SSM1 cDNA, the arrest sites were assumed to be located in this region. We identified these arrest sites by nucleotide substitution experiments (45Hutchinson C.A. Phillips S. Edgell M.H. Gillam S. Jahnke P. Smith K. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6551-6560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 9 A, we created three fragment 1 mutants. In mutants 1 and 2, 10 bases corresponding to positions 101–110 and 111–120 of fragment 1 were replaced by GACTTCAATA, respectively. This sequence corresponded to positions 61–70 of fragment 1, where no transcription arrest was found to occur. In mutant 3, positions 101–120 were replaced by GACTTCAATAGACTTCAATA, which is a tandem repeat of GACTTCAATA. When mutant 1 and mutant 2 were used as templates, the bands of 105 and 115 bases, respectively, became fainter than those obtained when wild type fragment 1 was used as template, as shown in Fig. 9 B. On the other hand, both bands became fainter when mutant 3 was used as a template. These results suggest that the two arrest sites are located in positions 101–110 and 111–120. These arrest sites seemed to be read through by RNA polymerase II when S-II was present. As shown in Fig. 10, the intensity of both bands decreased on addition of recombinant S-II to the reaction mixture.Figure 10Transcription arrest relief by yeast S-II. The transcription reaction was performed using 3′-deoxycytidine-extended fragment 1 as a template in the presence (+) or absence (−) of recombinant yeast S-II. The positions of the arrested transcripts of 105 and 115 bases are indicated byarrowheads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is clear that the SSM1 gene is responsible for the sensitivity of TNY14 (a S-II null mutant) to 6-AU. Expression of the SSM1 gene in TNY14 was significantly enhanced by the introduction of S-II, resulting in suppression of 6-AU sensitivity. The mode of action of S-II is probably to make RNA polymerase II read through the two transcription arrest sites present in the 5′-upstream region of the SSM1 ORF. This is the first demonstration of a yeast gene whose expression is controlled by transcription elongation factor S-II. It should be noted that a basal level of expression of the SSM1 gene (less than 13 of wild type strain) was always detected in TNY14. Two transcription arrest sites were identified only in the 5′-upstream region of the ORF and not in other regions of the SSM1 gene. These arrest sites were not T-rich, as reported with other arrest sites in other genes (22Reines D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10799-10809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These arrest sites may be partly suppressed even in the absence of S-II, resulting in a basal level of production of SSM1 mRNA in TNY14. This assumption was supported by an in vitro transcription experiment. A significant run-off product (read-through product) was detected when fragment 1 was transcribedin vitro in the absence of S-II. Thus, TNY14 should have a basal level of SSM1 protein, although it is sensitive to 6-AU. Possibly, the amount of SSM1 protein translated from the basal level of mRNA may not be sufficient to suppress the 6-AU sensitivity of TNY14. Nothing is known about the function of SSM1. It was difficult to predict the function of SSM1 from its amino acid sequence, because no appreciable functional domains were identified. SSM1 could be an enzyme that inactivates 6-AU by modifying it. It could also be a protein that represses the uptake of 6-AU. Extensive biochemical studies are needed to elucidate the function of SSM1 in suppressing the toxicity of 6-AU at 100 μg/ml to TNY14. Nevertheless, our finding that SSM1 suppresses the sensitivity of TNY14 to 6-AU is important, because for the first time it gave a clue to the function of S-II in vivo. Sensitivity to 100 μg/ml 6-AU is the only phenotype so far identified for the S-II null mutant (33Nakanishi T. Nakano A. Nomura K. Sekimizu K. Natori S. J. Biol.

Except for the S-II gene, the SSM1 gene was the only gene that reversed this phenotype, and we found that expression of the SSM1 gene was controlled by S-II. It may be important to identify other phenotypes, and the genes responsible for them, in S-II null mutants. If these genes have transcription arrest sites similar to those in the SSM1 gene, it may be possible to extend the function of S-II to all these genes."

For human biliverdin-IXα reductase, as previously discussed for the rat and ox enzymes, it appears that at least one “bridging propionate” is necessary for optimal binding and catalytic activity, whereas two are preferred. All other configurations studied were substrates for human biliverdin-IXα reductase, albeit poor ones. In the case of mesobiliverdin-XIIIα, extending the propionate side chains to hexanoate resulted in a significant loss of activity, whereas the butyrate derivative retained high activity. For human biliverdin-IXα reductase, we suggest that a pair of positively charged side chains play a key role in optimally binding the IXα isomers. In the case of human biliverdin-IXβ reductase, the enzyme cannot tolerate even one propionate in the bridging position, suggesting that two negatively charged residues on the enzyme surface may preclude productive binding in this case. The flavin reductase activity of biliverdin-IXβ reductase is potently inhibited by mesobiliverdin-XIIIα and protohemin, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the tetrapyrrole and flavin substrate bind at a common site.

Bonkovsky H.L. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1999; 111: 438-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, 87% of the bilirubin in human fetal bile has been reported to be the IXβ isomer (3.Yamaguchi T. Nakajima H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Yamaguchi et al. (4.Yamaguchi T. Komoda Y. Nakajima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24343-24348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) purified a novel enzyme from human liver that catalyzes the reduction of the IXβ, IXγ, and IXδ isomers of biliverdin to the corresponding rubin (4.Yamaguchi T. Komoda Y. Nakajima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24343-24348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that this enzyme, biliverdin-IXβ reductase (BVR-B), is identical to NAD(P)H-linked flavin reductase (5.Shalloe F. Elliott G. Ennis O. Mantle T.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The source of fetal biliverdin-IXβ has not yet been determined; however, this appears to be a pathway that is only operative at any significant level in the fetus. The physiological relevance of the apparent switch in heme degradation from a IXβ pathway in utero to a IXα pathway at birth is unclear, although it may be coupled to the switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin. O'Carra and Colleran (6.O'Carra P. Colleran E. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 42-43Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) have shown that nonenzymic ascorbate-mediated coupled oxidation of “free” heme (pyridine-heme complexes) produces all four isomers of biliverdin-IX (SchemeFS1), in approximately equimolar amounts, whereas coupled oxidation of adult hemoglobin produces a mixture of IXα (65%) and IXβ (35%) isomers of biliverdin. The nature of the protein binding the heme is important because ascorbate-mediated coupled oxidation of myoglobin produces 95% biliverdin-IXα (6.O'Carra P. Colleran E. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 42-43Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). It is not known which isomers of biliverdin-IX are produced by ascorbate-mediated coupled oxidation of fetal hemoglobin, although, in preliminary experiments, we cannot support BVR-B-dependent NADPH oxidation using the products of this reaction. 2O. Cunningham and T. J. Mantle, unpublished observations. 2O. Cunningham and T. J. Mantle, unpublished observations. Whereas nonenzymic coupled oxidation is demonstrable invitro, it is clear that at least two forms of heme oxygenase (HO-1 and HO-2) function in vivo. Both of these enzymes produce the IXα isomer of biliverdin exclusively; however, the nature of the isomer produced by the recently described HO-3 (7.McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Huang T.J. Maines M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) is not known. Quantitative flux through these three HO pathways in mammals has not been studied, although there is considerable interest that there is a requirement for a functioning HO-1 for effective reutilisation of iron in mammals (8.Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10919-10924Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar).

Tsuchiya T. Satoh T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 109: 3-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and allows us to suggest that a function for the IXβ isomer (which appears to be a uniquely fetal metabolite) may be related to fetal suppression of the maternal immune system. The Ah receptor is known to be involved in immunosuppression, and, during pregnancy, there is an increased susceptibility to certain types of infection (12.Sulentic C.E. Holsapple M.P. Kaminski N.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 13.Krishnan L. Guilbert L.J. Wegmann T.G. Belosevic M. Mosmann T.R. J.

Both biliverdin-IXα and bilirubin-IXα have been implicated as modulators of the immune system (15.Nakagami T. Toyomura K. Kinoshita T. Morisawa S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1158: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 16.Mori H. Otake T. Morimoto M. Ueba N. Kunita N. Nakagami T. Yamasaki N. Tagi S. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1991; 82: 755-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the recent suggestion that indoleamine dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.42) may be involved in fetal suppression of the maternal immune response (17.Munn D.H. Zhou M. Attwood J.T. Bondarev I. Conway S.J. Marshall B. Brown C. Mellor A.L. Science. 1998; 281: 1191-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (2162) Google Scholar) could also support Ah receptor involvement as tryptophan metabolites are also known to bind to and activate this transcription factor (18.Health-Paglinso S. Rogers W.J. Tullis K. Seidel S.D. Cenijn P.H. Brouwer A. Denison M.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11508-11515Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). High levels of the IXα isomer of bilirubin are generally seen at birth (so-called physiological jaundice of the newborn) and are potentially cytotoxic if the protective binding capacity of serum albumin (19.Walker P.C. Clin. Pharmakinet. 1987; 13: 26-50Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 20.Chuniaud L. Dessante M. Chantaux F. Blondeau J.P. Francon J. Trivin F. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1996; 256: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) is exceeded. However, this is a period when the infant lung experiences a massive increase in the partial pressure of oxygen (21.Pitkanen O.P. O' Brodovich H.M. Ann. Med. 1998; 30: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the transient increase in serum bilirubin levels seen at this time may represent a temporary boost in the levels of a physiologically significant antioxidant. Indeed, several workers have presented evidence that bilirubin-IXα functions as an antioxidant, both in its free form (22.Stoker R. Yamamoto Y. McDonagh A.F. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Science. 1987; 235: 1043-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar) and bound to albumin (23.Stoker R. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5918-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), and low serum bilirubin-IXα has been shown to correlate with increased risk of coronary artery disease in two independent studies (24.Schwertner H.A. Jackson W.G. Tolan G. Clin. Chem. 1994; 40: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 25.Hunt S.C. Wu L.L. Hopkins P.N. Williams R.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 912-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that linear tetrapyrroles may play significant biological roles in mammals, both as antioxidants and as anti-inflammatory agents, and it is therefore important to extend our knowledge of the substrate specificity of the two human enzymes currently known to catalyze the formation of bilirubin isomers. Further study will need to identify the origin of biliverdin-IXβ in utero and also to define any other linear tetrapyrroles that may occur in the adult and/or the fetus. The chemical synthesis of the four isomers of biliverdin, cleaved at the α, β, γ, and δ positions using ascorbate-mediated coupled oxidation of pyridine-heme is not amenable to large scale production.

Department of Health, Education and Welfare Publication 77–1100, National Institutes of Health, Washington, D.C.1977Google Scholar) demonstrated that replacement of the vinyl side chains by ethyl side chains (defined as mesobiliverdins) had little effect on substrate affinity. We have therefore developed a method of producing symmetrical synthetic mesobiliverdins with propionic acid groups at varying sites along the pigment backbone (Group I verdins, Refs. 27.Trull F.R.

Oligonucleotide primers used to amplify the cDNA encoding human BVR-A were designed based on the cDNA sequence reported by Maines et al. (35.Maines M.D. Polevoda B.V. Huang T.J. McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The forward (5′-GCAGGATCCAAGATGAATGCAGAG-3′) and reverse (5′-AACCAAATGCTGGTGCCATGGTGGAA-3′) primers containedBamHI and NcoI restriction sites, respectively (underlined). A cDNA library derived from the U937 monocyte cell line was used as target in subsequent amplification reactions. The resulting 960-base pair fragment was digested and ligated into the pGEX-KG expression vector to produce the pGEX-BVR-A plasmid.Escherichia coli strain TG1 was transformed according to procedures described in Sambrook et al. (36.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.82-1.84Google Scholar). E. coli cells for large scale purification of the recombinant GST fusion protein were cultured as follows. 10-ml cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani medium overnight at 30 °C in the presence of 2% glucose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Two-liter cultures were inoculated with the overnight cultures, grown at 30 °C to anA 600 of 0.4–0.5, and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.2 mm. After 18 h the cells were harvested by centrifugation (7,700 × g for 10 min) and lysed by sonication in the presence of lysozyme (200 μg/ml). Following centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 45 min, the cell supernatant was passed through a glutathione-Sepharose affinity column, and the fusion protein was eluted with 10 mmglutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Excess glutathione was removed by gel filtration, and the fusion protein was cleaved overnight at 4 °C with 20 units of thrombin (1 unit/μl). The liberated BVR-A was separated from the GST tag by passage through the glutathione affinity column. The approximate yield of purified BVR-A from a 2-liter culture is 30 mg. Recombinant human biliverdin-IXβ reductase was prepared as described previously by thrombin cleavage of a GST-BVR-B fusion protein (37.Cunningham O. Mantle T.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 613Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). On SDS-PAGE, recombinant human BVR-A migrates with a mobility corresponding to a molecular mass of 40 kDa. Similar behavior has been reported for the native human enzyme (38.Rigney E.M. Phillips O. Mantle T.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 39.Maines M.D. Trakshel G.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the behavior of the rat, mouse and ox enzymes which exhibit a molecular mass of 34 kDa on electrophoresis (38.Rigney E.M. Phillips O. Mantle T.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Given that the rat enzyme contains 295 amino acids and the human enzyme contains 296 amino acids, mass spectroscopy was carried out to determine the relative molecular mass of human BVR-A. Similar analysis was conducted for BVR-B. Stock solutions of both proteins were diluted in 200 μl of distilled water to give a final concentration of 0.6 mg/ml, and buffer was exchanged into 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, through a pre-equilibrated PD-10 column. Samples containing BVR-A and BVR-B were pooled and adjusted to 0.4 and 0.6 mg/ml, respectively. The buffer composition was finally adjusted to 50% (v/v) acetonitrile and 1% (v/v) formic acid. Mass analysis was carried out using a Micromass triple quadrupole electrospray mass spectrometer. A 10-μl sample was introduced into the electrospray mass spectrometer via a Rheodyne injector valve fitted with a 10-μl injection loop. Analysis was carried out in positive ion mode. Raw data were collected between a mass-to-charge ratio of 600–1700 m/z, at a cone voltage of 30 V, HV lens of 0.22 kV, and a capillary voltage of 3.60 kV. The raw data were subjected to maximum entropy analysis according to the Micromass schedule. Human erythrocytes were centrifuged at 4,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed. The erythrocytes were gently resuspended in three volumes of ice-cold 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride. Centrifugation was carried out as described above. This washing step was repeated twice. The packed erythrocytes were lysed by the addition of three volumes of ice-cold distilled water. The pH was adjusted to 6.4 using 5 m HCl. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pH was finally adjusted to 7.2 with 5m KOH. The lysate was dialyzed against 20 liters of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, overnight and then loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column (5 × 30 cm) equilibrated in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2. The column was washed until the A 280 was below 0.1, and the two forms of biliverdin reductase were then eluted with a 10–350 mmgradient (2 × 250 ml) of sodium phosphate, pH 7.2. The fractions were assayed for biliverdin-IXα reductase and flavin reductase activity as described below, and the peak fractions were subjected to immunoblotting with antisera raised against the recombinant BVR-A and BVR-B enzymes. The biliverdin isomers used in this study were synthesized from mono- and dipyrrole components as described previously (27.Trull F.R. Franklin R.W. Lightner D.A. J.

The final concentration of Me2SO in the assay was shown to have no effect on enzyme activity. Preliminary plate assays were conducted at 30 °C in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 μm NADPH and the respective biliverdin isomers at a concentration of 20 μm. Initial rate measurements with biliverdin as the variable substrate were made by monitoring biliverdin consumption at 660 nm in the presence and absence of BSA (1 mg/ml) using the extinction coefficients given in TableI. No co-solvents or detergents were added to the assay mixture (Beer Lambert's law was obeyed over the concentration range used). All assays were conducted in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and contained NADPH at a saturating concentration of 50 μm (theK mNADPH for BVR-A and BVR-B is 1 μm with biliverdin-IXα and FMN, respectively).Table ICalculated extinction coefficients for synthetic biliverdin isomers at maximum absorbanceBiliverdin isomerExtinction coefficientliters mol −1 cm −1Mesobiliverdin IXα1.2 × 104Mesobiliverdin-XIIIα1 × 104Mesobiliverdin-IVα2.2 × 10312-Ethyl mesobiliverdin-XIIIα9.9 × 10312-Ethyl-13-methyl mesobiliverdin-IVα1.4 × 104Mesobiliverdin XIIIγ1.54 × 104Mesobiliverdin-XIIγ1.16 × 1048,12-Dimethyl mesobiliverdin-XIIγ1.31 × 104α,α,α′,α′-Tetramethyl-mesobiliverdin-XIIIα7.78 × 103α,α′-Dimethoxy-mesobiliverdin-XIIα1.48 × 104Mesobiliverdin-XIIIα (n = 3)1.36 × 104Mesobiliverdin-XIIIα (n = 4)1.78 × 104 Open table in a new tab The flavin reductase activity of BVR-B was measured using the method described by Yubisui et al. (40.Yubisui T. Matsuki T. Takeshita M. Yoneyama Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 85: 719-728PubMed Google Scholar). Initial rate studies were carried out under saturating concentrations of FMN (150 μm) and NADPH (50 μm) in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. Activity was monitored by following the decrease in absorbance of NADPH at 340 nm. Inhibition of flavin reductase (FR) activity was determined under the same conditions using mesobiliverdin-XIIIα (1 nm to 1 μm), lumichrome (5 to 75 μm), and protohemin (1 nm to 10 μm). The initial rate data were fitted to equations for simple hyperbolic kinetics and total and partial substrate inhibiton (41.Phillips O. Mantle T.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1981; 9: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Most data sets showed potent substrate inhibition, where few data points were on the upward limb, and fitting (to either total or partial substrate inhibition) produced negative coefficients or large errors. For this reason estimates of the kinetic parameters (TableII) were obtained by manually generating saturation curves for total substrate inhibition (using, where possible, initial estimates from the curve fitting routines) and visually checking the theoretical line against the data set. For several of the substrates with BVR-B, the substrate inhibition is so potent that the only kinetic parameter obtainable was the substrate inhibitory K i value, obtained by plotting the reciprocal of the initial rate against the concentration of the tetrapyrrole. For those substrates exhibiting partial substrate inhibition only the linear part of thev o−1 versus[biliverdin] curve were used to obtain the substrate inhibitoryK i value. All experiments conducted in this study used 50 μm NADPH. More extensive kinetic studies, for example varying NADPH concentration, require the development of an assay that will allow initial rates to be determined at low concentrations of the tetrapyrrole substrate to allow curve fitting routines to be used with confidence.Table IIKinetic parameters for human BVR-A and human BVR-BVerdin isomerBVR-ABVR-BK mappk catappK iappK iappμms −1μmμmBiliverdin-IXα7440.7Mesobiliverdin-XIIIα111140.4Mesobiliverdin-IVα763416912-Ethyl mesobiliverdin-XIIIα200451012-Ethyl-13-methyl mesobiliverdin-IVα310.60.3Mesobiliverdin-XIIIγ790.92130.58,12-Dimethyl mesobiliverdin-XIIγ260.5300.8α,α,α′,α′-Tetramethyl mesobiliverdin-XIIIα371Mesobiliverdin-XIIγ3 Open table in a new tab The cloning of human biliverdin-IXβ reductase into the pGEX-KG expression vector to produce a GST-BVR-B fusion protein has been reported previously (37.Cunningham O.

We have constructed a similar vector for human biliverdin-IXα reductase that allows the production of 40 mg of GST-BVR-A fusion protein/liter of culture. The recombinant protein has been affinity purified on glutathione-Sepharose, and the GST moiety was removed following cleavage with thrombin, yielding a homogenous preparation of BVR-A of the predicted mobility on SDS-PAGE, as shown in Fig. 1. The partial purification of native BVR-A and BVR-B from human erythrocytes was achieved using DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The elution profile is shown in Fig.2 a and reveals complete separation of the two activities that was subsequently confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 b).Figure 2Separation of native human biliverdin-IXα reductase and biliverdin-IXβ reductase on DEAE-cellulose. a, human BVR-A and BVR-B isolated from erythroyctes were separated using ion exchange chromatography.

Mass spectroscopic analysis of recombinant human BVR-A gave a molecular mass of 34,330 Da (data not shown), suggesting that the protein runs anomalously on SDS-PAGE. The molecular mass estimated for BVR-B by SDS-PAGE was confirmed using mass spectroscopy as 22,531 Da. The structures of the verdins used to assess the substrate specificity of BVR-A and BVR-B are shown in Fig. 3. The natural IXα isomer (1) has vinyl side chains at positions 3 and 18. Fig. 4 shows the result of an overnight incubation of all of the verdin isomers with recombinant human BVR-A (row C) and BVR-B (row E) and the native forms of human BVR-A (row B) and BVR-B (row D) isolated from human red blood cells. The incubations were carried out in the presence of NADPH (50 μm), BSA (1 mg/ml), and 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5.Rows A and F are control incubations containing no enzyme. It is clear the recombinant enzymes exhibit identical behavior to the native enzymes and that all of the Group I and Group II structures are substrates for BVR-A. In these two groups, those isomers that contained bridging propionates (1, 2, and4), modified bridging propionates (9 and10), and extended bridging carboxylate side chains (butyrate, 11; hexanoate, 12) were not reduced by BVR-B (either native or recombinant). In our discussion, “bridging propionates” refers to propionate side chains at positions C8 and C12, effectively bridging the central methene bridge.Figure 3Structures of biliverdin isomers 1–16.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4A comparison of the substrate specificity of native and recombinant human BVR-A and human BVR-B.

Numbers 1–16 represent the various verdin structures illustrated in Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The verdins substituted at C10 (13–16) showed no change in the visible spectrum, which is not surprising because they are not reducible at C10. Unfortunately, none of these compounds are particularly effective inhibitors of BVR-A or BVR-B (which might have been a starting point for anti-hyperbilirubinaemia therapy). The methyl derivative (16) was the most potent, exhibiting modest inhibition at 25 μm. Although the overnight plate incubations allow a crude definition of whether or not the various compounds behave as substrates for the two enzyme forms, it yields little information about the relative rates of reaction. The initial rate kinetics for compounds 1–6,8, and 9 in the presence and absence of BSA (1 mg/ml) with recombinant BVR-A are shown in Fig.5. It is clear that the addition of BSA has a pronounced effect on the activity with mesobiliverdin-IVα (3); however, for biliverdin-IXα (1) and 12-ethyl mesobiliverdin-XIIIα (4) the effect is mainly on sequestration of substrate. In previous work with ox kidney BVR-A (42.Rigney E.M. Mantle T.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 957: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and rat kidney BVR-A (43.Ennis O. Maytum R. Mantle T.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we have attempted to define the effect of BSA as simple sequestration of the verdin substrate; however, detailed work in our laboratory suggests that this is not the only function (41.Phillips O.

https://openalex.org/W2124353400,"Most lipases of Gram-negative bacteria require a lipase-specific foldase (Lif) in order to fold in the periplasm into their active, protease-resistant conformation prior to their secretion. The periplasmic domain of the Lif (amino acids 44-353) of Burkholderia glumae was purified as a His-tagged protein, and its function in the folding of lipase was studied in vitro. Refolding of the denatured lipase into its active conformation was dependent on the presence of the Lif. Circular dichroism revealed that the lipase refolded in the absence of Lif into a form with a native-like conformation, which was more stable against heat-induced denaturation than the native form, but was enzymatically inactive. This form of the protein could be activated by adding Lif after several hours, which demonstrates that the function of this chaperone is to help lipase to overcome an energetic barrier in the productive folding pathway rather than to prevent it from entering a non-productive pathway. The Lif was shown to interact with the native lipase in protease-protection experiments as well as by affinity chromatography, consistent with a role of the Lif late in the folding process. These results demonstrate that the Lif functions in a way analogous to the propeptides of many bacterial proteases and indicate that the amino acid sequence of the lipase does not contain all the information required for the protein to adopt its three-dimensional structure."

In a few cases, multichaperone systems are capable of dissociating aggregated state(s) of substrate proteins, although little is known of the mechanism of the process. SecB is a cytosolic chaperone, which forms part of the precursor protein translocation machinery in Escherichia coli. We have investigated the interaction of the B-chain of insulin with chaperone SecB by light scattering, pyrene excimer fluorescence, and electron spin resonance spectroscopy. We show that SecB prevents aggregation of the B-chain of insulin. We show that SecB is capable of dissociating soluble B-chain aggregates as monitored by pyrene fluorescence spectroscopy. The kinetics of dissociation of the B-chain aggregate by SecB has been investigated to understand the mechanism of dissociation. The data suggests that SecB does not act as a catalyst in dissociation of the aggregate to individual B-chains, rather it binds the small population of free B-chains with high affinity, thereby shifting the equilibrium from the ensemble of the aggregate toward the individual B-chains. Thus SecB can rescue aggregated, partially folded/misfolded states of target proteins by a thermodynamic coupling mechanism when the free energy of binding to SecB is greater than the stability of the aggregate. Pyrene excimer fluorescence and ESR methods have been used to gain insights on the bound state conformation of the B-chain to chaperone SecB.

(1.Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar). They do not bind the native state of proteins and they are capable of interacting with many different polypeptide chains without apparent sequence preference (2.Gething M. Sambrook J.

The common property shared by molecular chaperones is the ability to recognize structural elements exposed in unfolded or partially denatured states, such as hydrophobic surfaces. SecB is a tetrameric chaperone in Escherichia coli that is involved in the translocation of polypeptide chains into the periplasmic space of the cell (5.Weiss J.B. Bassford P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3023-3029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, SecB binds to a subset of precursor proteins and maintains them in an unfolded, translocation competent state, while in vitro it interacts with a variety of proteins in the non-native state (6.Lecker S.H.

Studies on a model protein substrate of SecB, barstar, revealed that SecB did not bind the folded or unfolded state, but trapped a near native-like molten globule state (8.Panse V.G. Udgaonkar J.B. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14477-14483Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). SecB has also been shown to bind partially folded states of α-LA (10.Panse V.G. Swaminathan C.P. Surolia A. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2420-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). ITC studies with model protein substrates, which were either partially folded or unfolded, suggested that between 7 and 29 residues are buried upon substrate binding to SecB (10.Panse V.G. Swaminathan C.P. Surolia A. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2420-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The exact nature of the translocation competent state of SecB's natural substrates is unknown, although it is believed to be a flexible molten globule state (6.Lecker S.H. Driessen J.M. Wickner W.

Partially folded species such as molten globules have exposed hydrophobic surfaces and hence non-productive interactions leading to aggregation could compete with translocation events. Growing evidence suggests that protein aggregation occurs in most cases by mechanisms involving folding intermediates (12.Schuler J. Frank J. Saenger W. Georgalis Y. Biophys.

SecB was shown both to reduce the extent of aggregation and promote disaggregation during the refolding reaction. 1C. Ganesh and R. Varadarajan, unpublished results. The mechanism and the physical basis of interaction of chaperones with pre-formed aggregated state of proteins have not been quantitatively investigated in detail. Such studies are complicated by the fact that it is difficult to separate chaperone binding, folding, and aggregation kinetics. In the present work, we have investigated the ability of chaperone SecB to prevent aggregation and also promote dissociation of pre-formed soluble aggregates. We have used insulin as a model peptide substrate labeled with pyrene to gain insight into the mechanism of dissociation of a soluble aggregate of B-chain by chaperone SecB. Furthermore, we have also investigated the conformational state of the B-chain bound to SecB using pyrene excimer fluorescence and ESR spectroscopy. The insulin B-chain is a small 30-residue peptide. Isolated B-chains have a strong tendency to aggregate in aqueous solution. In the presence of chaperone, there is competition between binding and aggregation. In contrast to larger protein systems, these kinetics are uncomplicated by irreversible folding of the peptide to a native state. In addition, the B-chain has two Cys residues at positions 7 and 19 that can be used to attach spectroscopic probes. Pyrene maleimide, DTT,2 and 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) were from Sigma. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. The SecB expression plasmid pJW25 in strain BL21 (DE3) was obtained from Prof. B. de Kruijff. SecB purification was done as reported previously (8.Panse V.G. Udgaonkar J.B. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14477-14483Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The purified protein was estimated to be 99% pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as detected by silver staining (16.Laemmli U.

The extinction coefficient at 280 nm was taken to be 11,900 m−1 cm−1for monomeric SecB (17.Fasman G.D. Park K. Randall L.L. J. Prot.

The light scattering assay for insulin aggregation was performed as described previously (18.Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To a 50 μm solution of insulin containing varying amounts of SecB contained in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 20 mm EDTA, and 4 mm DTT, thioredoxin was added to a final concentration of 2 μm. The aggregation of the B-chain was monitored by the increase in scatter at 360 nm. 5 mg of insulin was dissolved in 1 ml (1.4 mm) of 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA and 10 mm DTT. This was kept at room temperature for 2 h. The B-chain precipitates in solution, while the A chain is still soluble. The reaction mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant discarded. The B-chain precipitate was washed thoroughly with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, to remove A chain and excess DTT. For spin labeling the precipitate was solubilized in 500 μl of 1% SDS, pH 8, and 50 μl of a 20 mm solution of 4-(3-iodo-2-oxypropylidene-1)-2,2,3,5,5-pentamethylimidazolidine-1-oxyl in N,N-dimethylformamide was added. For labeling with pyrene the precipitate was solubilized in 500 μl of 100 mmsodium carbonate buffer, pH 9, and 50 μl of a 20 mmsolution of pyrene maleimide in N,N-dimethylformamide was added. The reaction mixtures were again incubated for 2 h in the dark at room temperature. In the case of the spin-labeled B-chain, the reaction mixture was desalted on a PD-10 column equilibrated with 1% SDS to remove excess reagents, while in the case of the pyrene-labeled B-chain the PD-10 column used was equilibrated with 10 mmNaOH. Thiol estimation was performed using the 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) assay as described previously (19.Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford University, Oxford1990: 155-166Google Scholar). The B-chain is soluble in the presence of 1% SDS or at high pH. At neutral pH in the absence of SDS the B-chain forms a soluble aggregate at micromolar concentrations. All fluorescence experiments were carried out using a Jasco FP 777 fluorimeter in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, held in a 1-cm quartz cuvette at 25 °C. For kinetic measurements, the B-chain was first added to the cuvette and allowed to stand for 10 min (final concentration 1 μm). Increasing concentrations of SecB were then added and the increase in fluorescence at 377 nm was measured as a function of time. Steady-state fluorescence measurements were carried out using 344 nm as excitation wavelength and the emission was monitored between 360 and 500 nm. To obtain the excitation spectra, the excitation wavelength was varied from 320 to 360 nm and the fluorescence was monitored at 377 and 470 nm for monomer and excimer fluorescence, respectively. A slit-width of 1.5 nm was used for measuring both excitation and emission. A Superose 6 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column was equilibrated in 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 200 mm KCl. A complex of B-chain with SecB was prepared by diluting 20 μl of a 100 μm stock solution of B-chain in 20 mmNaOH, into 180 μl of 10 μm SecB in 100 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. This mixture was incubated for 1 h before injecting it into the gel filtration column, which was run at 0.3 ml min−1. The soluble aggregate of B-chain was prepared by diluting 20 μl of 100 μm stock solution of B-chain contained in 20 mm NaOH, into 180 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. All the solutions were centrifuged prior to injection. A dual channel detection mode at 280 and 340 nm was used to monitor the co-elution of SecB with the pyrene-labeled B-chain. The ESR measurements were carried out using a Brucker ESP 300 E spectrometer operating in the X-band mode. A dielectric cavity TE011 (ER 4118) was used for all experiments. 20-μl aliquots of the spin-labeled B-chain in 1% SDS or in complex with SecB in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, were measured in sealed quartz capillaries. The complex of SecB with the spin-labeled B-chain was prepared by diluting 20 μl of a 1 mm stock solution of B-chain into 990 μl of 300 μm SecB in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The sample was then concentrated to 100 μl. 200 μl of potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, was added and the sample was concentrated again to 100 μl. This was done 3 times to remove SDS. Spectra of the samples at room temperature (298 K) were obtained by averaging 3–5 scans at a scan width of 120 gauss. The microwave power was set to be 2 mW and the modulation amplitude was optimized to the line width of the individual spectra. ESR spectra in the frozen state (183 K) were recorded at a microwave power of 0.05 mW. Reduction of the insulin interchain disulfides leads to aggregation and precipitation of the B-chain while the A-chain remains soluble in solution (20.Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.L. Ding L.L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.J. Horwitz J. Hubbell Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This reduction of disulfides is catalyzed by thioredoxin, a 10-kDa redox protein. The aggregation was monitored by an increase in scatter at 360 nm as shown in Fig. 1. The ability of SecB to prevent aggregation was tested at various ratios of insulin/SecB. As shown in Fig. 1, the presence of SecB significantly delays the onset of aggregation and the final amplitude of scattering. At 1:1 stoichiometry of SecB:B-chain, complete protection of B-chain from aggregation is seen. Thus, SecB monomer binds a single B-chain. The B-chain of insulin is a 30-residue peptide, which has two cysteine residues in the 7th and 19th positions, 12 residues apart. The two free thiols were labeled by pyrene maleimide and the interaction of the labeled B-chain with SecB was investigated by size exclusion chromatography. At low concentrations (1 μm) the B-chain forms a soluble aggregate in the absence of the chaperone. This soluble aggregate of B-chain elutes at 17 ml in 100 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. This corresponds to a molecular mass of 40 kDa, suggesting that the aggregate contains approximately 14 B-chains. The elution volume of SecB alone on a Superose 6 column is 13.5 ml. As seen in Fig. 2, in the presence of SecB, the B-chain co-elutes at 13.5 ml, as shown by the absorbance of the pyrene chromophore. This demonstrates that the B-chain forms a stable complex with SecB. The fluorescence emission spectrum of pyrene (excited at 345 nm) is composed of two bands, a structured band with peaks near 377 and 390 nm, referred to as the monomer peak and an unstructured broad excimer peak near 475 nm. An excimer band is seen when an excited pyrene monomer interacts in a specific manner with a neighboring pyrene in the ground state. If two pyrenyl groups are close to each other (3.5 Å) they form an excimer upon excitation. It has been previously demonstrated that the B-chain alone aggregates in solution (20.Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.L. Ding L.L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.J. Horwitz J. Hubbell Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 A, a strong excimer peak centered at 470 nm indicates that the pyrene probes are in close proximity and that at low concentrations (1 μm) the B-chain is in a soluble aggregated state in 100 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The spectrum also shows a small amount of monomer peaks in the region of 377 nm. Addition of SecB to the soluble aggregate results in changes in fluorescence intensities of both monomer and excimer peaks. These changes are due in part to decreased quenching of pyrene fluorescence by solvent in the SecB bound state. Hence in order to analyze intensities of the excimer peak in the presence of SecB, the spectra in Fig. 3 A were normalized so as to have identical intensities at 377 nm (Fig. 3 B). As seen in Fig. 3 B there is a decrease in the excimer fluorescence at 470 nm with an increase in SecB concentration. The kinetics of dissociation of the aggregate to individual B-chains was studied by monitoring the increase in fluorescence in the pyrene-monomer region of the spectra in Fig. 3 A at 377 nm. This increase in pyrene monomer B-chain fluorescence on interaction with SecB indicates that the aggregate has been disrupted by chaperone SecB. The kinetics of disaggregation was monitored by increase in monomer fluorescence at 377 nm as a function of time. Fig.3 C shows the effect of increasing SecB concentrations on the dissociation kinetics of the B-chain aggregate. As the SecB concentration increases there is an increase in the final fluorescence amplitude, which is saturable as shown in Fig.4 A. The kinetic traces were fitted to single exponential and the data are shown in Fig.4 B. Identical values of the rate constant were obtained if disaggregation was monitored using the excimer peak at 470 nm instead (data not shown). At the end of each kinetic trace fluorescence emission spectra were recorded. There is a decrease in excimer fluorescence on addition of increasing concentrations of SecB. However, a weak excimer is still present even at high concentrations of SecB as seen in Fig. 3 B. This indicates that the pyrenes do come in close proximity even in the bound state. In order to characterize the insulin B-chain and its environment in the complex with SecB, the thiols at residues 7 and 19 of the B-chain were labeled with IOPI. Fig.5 A shows the spectrum of B-chain in 1% SDS. The line shape is characteristic of mobile spin labels in 1% SDS solutions. The peaks are broader than expected for a mobile spin label in aqueous solutions because the B-chain is incorporated into micelles at these SDS concentrations (22.Stopar D. Spruijt R.B. Wolfs C.J. Hemminga M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 3: 15467-15473Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Fig.5 B shows an ESR spectrum of B-chain in complex with SecB. SDS was removed from the sample as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Since a large excess of SecB is present, all B-chain is in the bound state. Furthermore, any free B-chain would be insoluble under these conditions. The absence of such a precipitate also shows that all the B-chain is bound to SecB. The ESR line shape is a characteristic of relatively immobilized labels. The bound signal in the low field region of the spectrum has 2 spectral components (marked in arrows). The 2 spin labels are in different environments with one being in a more rigid environment than the other. The high field signal is broad, no fine features could be observed due to low signal to noise ratio. The SecB·B-chain complex can be denatured by 1% SDS and the resulting spectrum is then identical to that of Fig.5 A. In order to measure the distance between spin labels the solution was frozen and the spectra were recorded at 183 K. As described previously (23.Rabenstein M.D. Shin Y.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8239-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), the extent of magnetic dipolar interaction between two spin-labeled cysteine side chains can be used to estimate the distance between the bound radicals. To evaluate the line broadening due to static dipolar interactions, quantitative analysis of the interspin distance can be carried out in the absence of motion by acquiring the spectra in the frozen state (183 K). An estimation of the extent of broadening due to dipolar interaction is obtained from the line height ratio d 1/d and is in direct correlation to the average distance of the radicals from each other. In the absence of interaction (when a distance greater than 20 Å separates the radicals) a value ofd 1/d of less than 0.4 is expected (23.Rabenstein M.D. Shin Y.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8239-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 24.Hubbell W.L. Mchaourab H.S. Altenbach C.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15970-15977Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The d 1/d ratio is an indicator of dipolar interactions. Ad 1/d of less than 0.4 indicates absence of dipolar interactions, whereas ratios higher than 0.4 shows that the spin labels are closer than 20 Å in proximity. Fig.5 C shows a frozen spectrum at 183 K of SecB·B-chain complex. A d 1/d of 0.36 is obtained which indicates that the 2 spin labels are greater than 20 Å apart. During the course of folding, many proteins reach a compact state within milliseconds (1.Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar). The transition from the compact state to the final folded structure is a slow process. During this slow process, the non-native state of the protein can undergo non-productive interactions leading to formation of aggregates or off pathway products. The mechanism of interaction of chaperone SecB with such off pathway dead end products has been investigated in this work, using the B-chain as a model aggregate. Two kinds of models for the dissociation of B-chain aggregate can be envisaged. In one model the chaperone actively dissociates individual B-chains from the aggregate as shown, An+S ↔koffkon An−1+A:SEquation 1 where A n, S, andA:S represent the peptide aggregate, SecB, and complex of SecB with peptide. Such a model would predict an increase in the apparent rate constant of dissociation of the aggregate, with an increase in concentration of SecB. As shown in Fig. 4 B the apparent rate constant is independent of SecB concentration. Thus, SecB does not bind to or catalyze dissociation of B-chain aggregate. In the other model we assume that the aggregate is in equilibrium with the monomeric B-chains as shown, An ↔k−1k1 An−1+AEquation 2 A+S ↔k−2k2 A:SEquation 3 Here, k 1 and k −1are the microscopic rate constants for the dissociation and aggregation events, respectively. Furthermore, k 2 andk −2 represent the on-rate and off-rate of binding to monomeric B-chain to SecB. It is important to note that the B-chain aggregate is an ensemble of multimeric species, which are at equilibrium with monomeric B-chains. The slow step in the entire scheme is assumed to be the reaction that converts the aggregate to monomeric B-chain. The on-rate for SecB substrate binding is known to be close to diffusion controlled (7.Fekkes P. Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10078-10085Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The free concentration of the unbound monomer is small and hence both the forward and reverse reactions in Equation 2are likely to be slow in comparison with the forward reaction in Equation 3. Such a model would then predict that the observed rate of disaggregation would be independent of SecB concentration. We indeed observe that the apparent rate constant for the dissociation of the aggregate is independent of SecB concentration. Hence, SecB uses the intrinsic free energy of binding to the B-chain to shift the equilibrium to the monomeric form. ESR spectroscopy has been used previously to understand proximity relationships between spin labels (24.Hubbell W.L. Mchaourab H.S. Altenbach C. Lietzow M.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 779-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 25.Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15970-15977Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The bound state conformations of B-chain and mellitin peptides to chaperone α-crystallins have been investigated using this technique (20.Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.L. Ding L.L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.J. Horwitz J. Hubbell Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In addition to ESR, pyrene excimer fluorescence has been used extensively to give insight into the dynamics of labeled proteins and proximity relationships of the attached pyrene probes (21.Lehrer S.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A large body of work suggests that proteins that bind a variety of unfolded and partially folded peptide and protein substrates typically bind to an extended conformation of the substrate. These systems include MHC molecules, Src homology domains 2 and 3, and the periplasmic oligopeptide-binding protein (28.Stanfield R.L. Wilson I.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies on chaperone peptide complexes have so far shown the only mode of peptide binding to be in an extended state (29.Joachimiak A. Nature Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Chaperones have the ability to bind proteins with no apparent homology. The spectroscopic data in the present studies indicate that the bound peptide is in a state in which one part of the peptide is held more rigidly than the other as reflected from the ESR data which shows 2 spectral components in the low field region. However, both components show a substantial degree of immobilization. This suggests that the binding site on each SecB monomer accommodates on the order of 10–12 residues. In case more than 12 residues were bound, a greater degree of immobilization would have been expected for both labels. If substantially fewer residues were bound, then the ESR spectra should show peaks corresponding to one immobilized and one free label. Such spectra were indeed observed in ESR studies of unfolded BPTI mutants in which the spin labels were located greater than 20 residues apart. 3V. G. Panse, W. Trommer, P. Vogel, and R. Varadarajan, unpublished results. The present results are also in agreement with a very recent study which suggests that the binding frame of the substrate is of the order of 9 residues (30.Knoblauch N.T. Rudiger S. Schonfeld H.J. Driessen A.J. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34219-34225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), but not with earlier estimates of as high as 40 residues (31.Topping T.B. Randall L.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,32.Khisty V.J. Munske G.R. Randall L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25920-25927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The low temperature ESR measurements show that in the bound state the 2 Cys on the B-chain are greater than 20 Å apart. However, we do observe the presence of a weak excimer for the pyrene-labeled B-chain. This shows that the more flexible region of the peptide does encounter the rigidly held pyrene within its excited state lifetime. Thus, the data is consistent with a model that the B-chain is bound on the surface of the chaperone SecB in a flexible extended state. In certain cases it has been shown that SecB binds to partially folded conformations of proteins such as α-lactalbumin and barstar (8.Panse V.G. Udgaonkar J.B. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14477-14483Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 10.Panse V.G. Swaminathan C.P. Surolia A. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2420-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the present work we suggest that the bound conformation is an extended conformation. The two results are not necessarily contradictory because of the very short length of the binding frame. Since SecB binds only small 10-residue regions of the substrate and the binding site on SecB is solvent accessible (10.Panse V.G. Swaminathan C.P. Surolia A. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2420-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) it is possible for the bound fragment to be extended even though the remainder of the protein adopts a relatively compact conformation. Recent NMR studies of the α-lactalbumin molten globule have also shown that some regions of the molten globule adopt an unfolded conformation (33.Redfield C. Schulman B.A. Milhollen M.A. Kim P.S. Dobson C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 948-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Protein foldingin vivo occurs at total protein concentrations much higher than concentrations used for in vitro experiments. Thein vivo concentration of nascent polypeptide chains is typically 50 μm in the cell (34.Morimoto R.I. Tisseres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 1-30Google Scholar). Non-productive interaction among the partially folded proteins leads to aggregation. The cell has evolved ways to stabilize the aggregation prone state from engaging in non-productive interactions. Several molecular chaperones are known to prevent aggregation. However, in only very few cases has it been possible to show that chaperones can also dissociate pre-formed aggregates and almost nothing is known about the mechanism of the process. The Hsp104/Hsp70/Hsp40 and the ClpB/DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE are the only chaperone systems reported in the literature that are capable of rescuing dead end products of folding pathways (14.Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar, 15.Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Zvi A.P. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13732-13737Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) and function by active dissociation and remodeling of the aggregated species. The primary function of SecB is believed to be funneling of its protein substrates to the sec pathway. Since folded proteins are no longer competent for export, SecB binds to its substrates before complete folding has occurred and maintains them in an unfolded, translocation competent state (9.Hardy S.J. Randall L.L. Science. 1991; 251: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 35.Khisty V.J. Randall L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3277-3282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SecB has also been shown to prevent irreversible aggregation of two of its natural protein substrates OmpA and PhoE (6.Lecker S.H. Driessen J.M. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2309-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 36.Breukink E. Kusters R. De Kruijff B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). SecB also prevents aggregation and promotes disaggregation of another natural substrate, maltose-binding protein. 4C. Ganesh, F. Zaidi, J. B. Udgaonkar, and R. Varadarajan, unpublished results. However, little is known at the molecular level about how this occurs with any of the natural substrates. The present data implicates SecB as a molecular chaperone whose function on the sec pathway is not only to maintain substrates in a translocation competent state and prevent aggregation but also to rescue the aggregated states and direct them to a productive folding pathway. SecB can promote disaggregation by a thermodynamic coupling mechanism by binding to free monomer that is in equilibrium with the aggregated state. This simple and relatively passive mechanism may be applicable to other instances of chaperone-mediated protein disaggregation and is in contrast to the more active role of chaperones such as Hsp104 and ClpB.

Ganesh, and Suvobrata Chakravarty for helpful discussions."

In this study, we sought to define the DNA sequences required for the intestine-specific regulation of the human apolipoprotein B (apoB)1 gene. This gene is transcribed almost exclusively in the liver and intestine and thus provides a good model system for studying tissue-specific transcriptional control. In the liver, the product of the apoB gene is apoB100 (12Knott T.J. Rall Jr., S.C. Innerarity T.L. Jacobson S.F. Urdea M.S. Levy-Wilson B. Powell L.M. Pease R.J. Eddy R. Nakai H. Byers M.

Nature. 1986; 323: 734-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), a 4536-amino acid protein that is important for the assembly of very low density lipoproteins. In the intestine, a single codon in the apoB transcript undergoes editing to produce a premature stop codon, resulting in the synthesis of a truncated protein, apoB48, which is 2152 amino acids in length (48% as large as apoB100) (14Powell L.M.

Chem. 1990; 265: 6811-6816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoB48 plays a critical role in the packaging of alimentary lipids into chylomicrons (16Young S.G. Circulation. 1990; 82: 1574-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 17Young S.G. Cham C.M. Pitas R.E. Burri B.J. Connoly A. Flynn L. Pappu A.S. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2932-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Within the intestine, the highest levels of apoB48 expression are found in the villus enterocytes with very low levels of expression detected in the crypts. There is also a gradient of expression along the length of the intestine, with high levels of expression in the duodenum and lower amounts in the jejunum and ileum (18Nielsen L.B. McCormick S.P.A.

Even though the function of apoB in the assembly of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins is identical in liver and intestine and even though both tissues arise from endoderm, it is clear that the chromatin domain of the apoB gene, as well as the regulatory elements themselves and their mechanism of action, differ in these two tissues. Earlier studies by our laboratory focused on the identification and characterization of the DNA sequences and nuclear proteins involved in liver-specific regulation of the human apoB gene (for review see Ref. 19Levy-Wilson B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1995; 50: 161-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Both in hepatoma cells (HepG2) and transgenic mice, we have demonstrated that the hepatic regulatory elements are located relatively close to the structural gene (20Paulweber B. Brooks A.R. Nagy B.P. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21956-21961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Brooks A.R. Blackhart B.D. Haubold K. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol.

High level expression of the apoB gene in the liver requires the proximal promoter region (−898 to +1), an enhancer from the second intron (+346 to +1048), as well as a segment from −899 to −5262 5′ of the gene. The latter segment contains two nuclear matrix association regions (24Brooks A.R. Nagy B.P. Taylor S. Simonet W.S. Taylor J.M. Levy-Wilson B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2243-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); one of these matrix association regions (the 5′-distal matrix association region) was proposed to represent the 5′-boundary of the chromatin domain of the apoB gene in HepG2 cells (25Levy-Wilson B. Fortier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21196-21204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of apoB gene expression in the intestine is very different. In transgenic mouse expression studies, we discovered that the control of human apoB gene expression in the intestine depends on very distant DNA sequence elements. The most recent of these studies suggested that the intestinal control region (ICR) of apoB is located between −54 and −62 kb 5′ to the structural gene (26Nielsen L.B. Kahn D. Duell T. Weier H.U.G. Taylor S. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21800-21807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). An earlier study revealed that the distant intestinal control sequences directed a spatially appropriate pattern of apoB gene expression in the intestine, with high expression levels in the duodenum and lower levels in the jejunum and ileum. Furthermore, in situ hybridization studies revealed that the human apoB transgene (as well as the endogenous mouse apoB gene) were expressed appropriately in the enterocytes of the intestinal villi but not in the crypts (26Nielsen L.B. Kahn D. Duell T. Weier H.U.G. Taylor S. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21800-21807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to perform a thorough analysis of the ICR of the human apoB gene. In transgenic mouse experiments, we localized the ICR to −54 to −57 kb 5′ to the structural gene. DNaseI hypersensitivity (DH) studies of that segment revealed an intestine-specific DH site within a 315-bpEcoRI-HindIII fragment. This fragment harbors a potent intestine-specific enhancer that is sufficient to activate transcription of human apoB in the intestines of transgenic mice. The DNA sequence and distant spatial localization of this ICR has been conserved in humans and mice. Gel retardation studies and transactivation experiments allowed us to identify the most important transcription factors involved in the activity of the intestinal enhancer. DNA from a P1 clone spanning the human apoB gene, p158, was prepared as described previously (26Nielsen L.B. Kahn D. Duell T. Weier H.U.G. Taylor S. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21800-21807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A 6-kb EcoRI subclone (E27), spanning from −51 to −57 kb and a 3-kb EcoRI subclone (E7), spanning from −59 to −62 kb 5′ to the structural gene were subcloned from a bacterial artificial chromosome clone, BAC(70,22), which contained 70 kb of 5′-flanking sequences (26Nielsen L.B. Kahn D. Duell T. Weier H.U.G. Taylor S. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21800-21807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Another clone, p4.8IE, spanning sequences from −54 to −58.8 kb, was prepared from BAC(70,22) by long range PCR with the oligonucleotide primers: clone 7-T7 and clone 12-T3. A 3-kb clone, E3, spanning from −54 to −57 kb, represented an EcoRI fragment of p4.8IE. The 315-bp IE fragment is anEcoRI-HindIII segment of the p4.8IE. Fragments E3, E27, E7, or the 315-bp IE were co-microinjected with p158 into FVB/N fertilized mouse eggs to generate transgenic mice. The DNA fragments were microinjected in equimolar concentrations according to standard protocols. Transgenic mouse founders were first identified by PCR using oligonucleotides B1 and B2 as primers to detect the human apoB gene. Cointegrant founder mice were then identified through parallel Southern blots of EcoRI-digested genomic DNA and hybridized with an exon 26 probe for the apoB structural gene and with probes representing the various co-injected fragments from the ICR. All mice were weaned at 21 days, housed in a barrier facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle, and fed a chow diet containing 4.5% fat (Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO). Total hepatic and duodenal RNA were isolated from transgenic mice using the totally RNA kit from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). Expression of transgenes was evaluated with RNase protection assays using the Ambion RPA III kit. Antisense RNA riboprobes were transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]UTP using the Riboscribe kit (Epicentre Technologies, Inc., Madison, WI) and XbaI-linearized plasmids spanning either exon 1 of the mouse apoB gene or exon 1 of the human apoB gene (24Brooks A.R. Nagy B.P. Taylor S. Simonet W.S. Taylor J.M. Levy-Wilson B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2243-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The β-actin riboprobe spanned the mouse β-actin cDNA from nucleotides +480 to +559. The riboprobes were purified on 5% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels. Typically, 2–4 × 105 cpm of eluted probe was used/hybridization reaction with 10–25 μg of sample RNA overnight at 50 °C, and then samples were digested using RNase A and RNase T1. RNase protection products were separated on 6% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels and visualized with autoradiography. The 5′-IE and 3′-IE-85CAT plasmids were made by digesting p4.8IE with HindIII, followed by purification of the 2.1-kb 5′-IE and the 2.7-kb 3′-IE fragments. These two fragments were then ligated separately into the HindIII site of −85CAT. Orientations of these two IE fragments were determined by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. To generate the 315/−85CAT forward and reverse plasmids (315 IE-F and 315 IE-R), p4.8IE was digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and the 315-bp EcoRI-HindIII fragment was gel-purified. The −85CAT plasmid was digested with HindIII and purified in a similar manner. Both fragments of DNA were then incubated with 50 μm dNTPs and Klenow DNA polymerase for 20 min at 25 °C to fill in the single-stranded ends. The blunt-ended 315 fragment was then ligated into blunt-ended −85CAT. Transformants were screened for the 315-bp insert, and orientation was determined by restriction digests and DNA sequencing. The 315 TATA chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) plasmid was constructed by excising the 315-bp fragment from 315F/−85CAT with ClaI and XbaI and ligating it into the ClaI and XbaI sites of TATA CAT (27Paulweber B. Sandhofer F. Levy-Wilson B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1534-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), to create the 315F TATA CAT reporter plasmid. Construction of the deletion mutants of the 315-bp IE was as follows: The 1–2 CAT and 1–2–3 CAT constructs were derived from a 203-bp fragment generated by PCR, extending from the 5′-end of the 315-bp IE (ClaI site) (PCR1-Cla primer) to the 3′-end of site 3 (site 3H primer). After gel purification of the 203-bp fragment harboring sites 1, 2, and 3, a portion of it was digested with ClaI and TaqI, followed by purification and cloning of this fragment into the ClaI site of −85CAT to generate plasmid 1–2 CAT. To make clone 1–2–3 CAT, the 203-bp fragment was digested with ClaI and HindIII and ligated to plasmid −85 CAT that had been cut with ClaI and HindIII. Constructs 2–3–4 CAT and 3–4 CAT were derived from a 235-bp PCR fragment made with primer site 2H and 3′Xba. This fragment was digested with HindIII and XbaI and cloned into theHindIII and XbaI sites of plasmid −85CAT. For the 3–4 CAT deletion mutant, the 235-bp fragment was digested withTaqI and XbaI, gel-purified, and cloned into theClaI and XbaI sites of −85CAT. The 2–3 CAT deletion construct was made using PCR to generate a 110-bp fragment using as primers site 2H and site 3H oligonucleotides. This fragment was then digested with HindIII and ligated into theHindIII site of −85CAT. Orientation of all fragments was determined by restriction digestion and PCR screening. DNA from a P1 clone spanning −31 to −110 kb 5′ to the mouse apoB gene was digested with various restriction enzymes. The resulting DNA fragments were separated on 1% agarose gels and transferred to a nylon membrane. The Southern blot was then hybridized with the human 315-bp IE. A 690-bp HindIII/PstI fragment was detected, gel-purified, and cloned into pBluescript K/S+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Clones containing the 690-bp mouse apoB ICR were identified by Southern blot analysis. Reporter plasmid m690F was constructed by digesting the mouse 690-bp ICR clone with HindIII andXbaI and ligating the fragment intoHindIII/XbaI-cleaved −85CAT. Plasmid m690R was made by excising the m690 fragment from pBluescript withXbaI and ligation into the XbaI site of −85CAT. The integrity of the m690F and m690R plasmids were confirmed by restriction digests and DNA sequencing. Alignment of the human 315-bp ICR and mouse 690-bp ICR sequences was performed with GeneWorks software with minor manual adjustments. To localize this segment within the mouse P1 clone, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis ofNotI-, PmeI-, SalI-, andSfiI-digested DNA was performed according to established conditions (26Nielsen L.B. Kahn D. Duell T. Weier H.U.G. Taylor S. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21800-21807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The pulsed-field gel was then transferred to a nylon membrane and Southern blot analysis was performed using the mouse 690-bp ICR fragment as a probe. A partial restriction map of the P1 clone was generated, and the 690-bp mouse ICR was localized to a 43-kbPmeI/SfiI fragment, which spans from −40 to −83 kb 5′ to exon 1 of the mouse apoB gene. HepG2, CaCo-2, COS, and HeLa cells were cultured as described previously (28Lee S.-Y. Nagy B.P. Brooks A.R. Wang D.-M. Paulweber B. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 707-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at ∼20% confluency in 100-mm tissue culture plates and grown for 48 h prior to transfection. Plasmid DNA was transfected using the calcium-phosphate transfection kit according to manufacturer's instructions (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). Typically, 10 μg of the plasmid DNA along with 5 μg of an internal reference plasmid (pRSVβ-GAL), and varying amounts of expression plasmids for HNF-3β (29Lai E. Clark K.L. Burley S.K.

Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar) were co-transfected into cells in duplicate plates. Cell lysates were prepared after 48 h with three cycles of freeze-thaw and lysate clarification by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 5 °C. The levels of β-galactosidase activities, as well as levels of CAT activity, were assessed as described previously (23Brooks A.R. Levy-Wilson B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1134-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The levels were quantitated with PhosphorImage analysis and Image Quant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). All CAT activity values represent averages of at least three independent transfection experiments and are corrected for transfection efficiencies between plates by dividing the CAT activity levels by the β-galactosidase levels. DNaseI hypersensitivity studies with nuclei from CaCo-2 and HeLa cells were performed as described previously (32Levy-Wilson B. Fortier C. Blackhart B.D. McCarthy B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Following digestions with DNaseI, DNA samples were digested with BglII. The digestion products were separated by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels, followed by Southern blot analysis, using a 215-bp 5′-fragment as a probe. The probe, corresponding to nucleotides +469 to +684 within the p4.8IE, was amplified from p4.8IE template DNA using oligonucleotides DHF and DHR as primers. COS cells were transfected (as above) with 10 μg of expression plasmids for HNF-3β, HNF-3α, C/EBPβ, or C/EBPα; cellular lysates enriched for these proteins were prepared as described previously (28Lee S.-Y.

Nuclear extracts from CaCo-2 cells were prepared as described by Dignam et al.(33Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9167) Google Scholar). Putative binding sites for the transcription factors HNF-3β, C/EBPβ, and for HNF-4 were identified within the human 315-bp ICR utilizing the TRANSFAC 3.5 data base sequence analysis algorithm (34Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). Sense and antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to consensus binding sequences for HNF-3β (27Paulweber B. Sandhofer F. Levy-Wilson B. Mol. Cell.

The single-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed, purified, and end-labeled according to procedures previously described (21Brooks A.R. Blackhart B.D. Haubold K. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7848-7859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies specific for C/EBPβ and HNF-3β were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc.; antibodies for HNF-4 were a generous gift from F. Sladek. Binding reactions and electrophoretic analyses of DNA-protein complexes were performed as described by Brooks et al. (21Brooks A.R. Blackhart B.D. Haubold K. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7848-7859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ng of labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe was incubated with extracts (5–10 ng of protein) for 20 min at 25 °C. Competition assays were performed utilizing 200 ng of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides. For supershift reactions, the binding reaction was preincubated at 25 °C for 15 min prior to the addition of 5–10 μg of antibody, and antibody binding was allowed to proceed for an additional 15 min at 25 °C. The various oligonucleotides used are listed below: DHF, GGA ATA CTA ATT CAG CAG AC; DHR, CAG AGC ACA GTT GAC ATA GC; clone 7-T7, TGC TGT GTG AGC ACT GAC AGT TCA GAA TTC CTT GAA GTA TAC AGA AGG TAG GGA AGG GAA; clone 12-T3, TCC TCT AGA GTC GAC CTG CAG GCA TGC AAG CTT CAT CCC CTA ACC CCA AAA AAC AAT TTA; C/EBP consensus, TGCAGATTGCGCAATCTGCA; HNF-3 consensus, GTTGACTAAGTCAATAATCAGAATCAG; HNF-4 consensus, CTACACAAATATGAACCTTGCC; site 1, GCACTGTTCTTTATTTCTGG; site 2, CTTCGGATTGAAGAAATCTGTATTTG; site 3, ATAAAGAACAAAGAGCATTTTC; site 4, GTCACGCTGAGGAAAACACTGAAG; B1, GAA GAA CTT CCG GAG AGT TGC AAT; B2, CTC TTA GCC CCA TTC AGC TCT GAC; PCR1-Cla, CCATCGATGAAGTCCTTTTGGGAATTC; site 2H, CCCAAGCTTCGGATTGAAGAAATCTG; site 3H, CCCAAGCTTCGAAAATGCTCTTTGTTCTTTATTCC; 3′-Xba, GCAGCAACCGAGAAGGGCACTCAGC. Recently, we examined human apoB gene expression in a collection of transgenic mice produced from RecA-assisted restriction endonuclease cleavage-modified BAC clones (26Nielsen L.B. Kahn D. Duell T. Weier H.U.G. Taylor S. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21800-21807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Each of these BAC clones spanned the human apoB gene but contained different lengths of 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences. These studies revealed that DNA sequences between −54 and −62 kb 5′ to the human apoB gene are essential for apoB gene expression in the intestine. In this study, to further localize the intestinal control region, we co-microinjected fertilized mouse eggs with three smaller segments from this region (E7, E27, and E3; see Fig. 1 A) and the human apoB P1 clone, p158. p158 spans the entire human apoB gene, along with 19 kb of the 5′-flanking sequences and 17.5 kb of the 3′-flanking sequences. Because p158 lacks the distant intestinal control region, it does not confer intestinal expression in transgenic mice. As illustrated in Fig. 1 B, transgenic mice produced with clone p158 exhibit human apoB expression in the liver but not in the small intestine. Co-microinjection of p158 with either E27 or E3 produced transgenic mice that expressed human apoB in the intestine as well as in the liver. E27 is a 6-kb fragment extending from −51 to −57 kb of the human apoB gene, whereas E3 extends from −54 to −57 kb. Transgenic mice produced with co-microinjections of p158 and with E7 (extending from −59 to −62 kb) did not express the transgene in the intestine. Representative examples of RNase protection assays used with these mice are shown in Fig. 1 C. To localize the intestinal control region of the human apoB gene, DH assays were performed. DH sites reflect an open chromatin structure, which could facilitate binding of transcriptional activators. We first focused on a 2.6-kb BglII fragment from the intestinal control region (−58.6 to −56 kb). Progressive digestion of the parental BglII fragment with DNaseI revealed a broad hypersensitive region (designated DH1) in transcriptionally active CaCo-2 cells but not in transcriptionally inactive HeLa cells (Fig. 2, top panel). DH1 mapped almost entirely within a 315-bpEcoRI-HindIII fragment (Fig. 2). Further DH analysis of the BglII-HindIII segment located immediately 3′ of the 2.6-kb BglII fragment revealed no additional strong hypersensitive areas. Next, the potential for transcriptional activation or repression of the apoB promoter by DNA sequences in the vicinity of DH1 was tested (see map,top panel of Fig. 3). For these experiments, we employed an apoB promoter-CAT gene construct, −85CAT, that contains the proximal apoB promoter sequences (from −85 to +121) (Fig. 3). This construct exhibits a transcriptional activity about 6 times weaker than that of the full apoB promoter (−898 to +121) (36Paulweber B. Levy-Wilson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24161-24168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore is well suited for assays of potential activator elements. Various segments from the intestinal control region were inserted in both the forward (F) and the reverse (R) orientations upstream of −85CAT, and transfections were performed in intestine-derived CaCo-2 cells and in liver-derived HepG2 cells. CAT activities of the various constructs were expressed relative to that of the promoter alone, which was assigned an activity level of 1.0 (Fig. 3, bottom panel). The 5′-IE fragment when in the forward orientation enhanced transcription from the apoB promoter by 5-fold in CaCo-2 cells but not in HepG2 cells. This enhancer activity was not observed when the 5′-IE was placed upstream of the promoter in the reverse orientation (Fig. 3); instead, a 75% reduction in CAT activity was observed in CaCo-2 cells but not in HepG2 cells. The 3′-IE segment exhibited a weak repressor activity in both orientations in CaCo-2 cells (less than 50%) but a slight enhancer effect in the forward orientation in HepG2 cells. We then tested the 315 IE segment. It fragment enhanced transcription from the apoB promoter by 5–6-fold in both orientations in CaCo-2 cells and in the reverse orientation in HepG2 cells. Similar results were obtained when fragments from the IE region were cloned upstream of the heterologous SV40 promoter (data not shown). These results establish the presence of a strong transcriptional enhancer in the 315-bp EcoRI-HindIII fragment. Analysis of the DNA sequenc"
https://openalex.org/W2077531594,"Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31) is a 130-kDa glycoprotein receptor present on the surface of platelets, neutrophils, monocytes, certain T-lymphocytes, and vascular endothelial cells. CD31 is involved in adhesion and signal transduction and is implicated in the regulation of a number of cellular processes. These include transendothelial migration of leukocytes, integrin regulation, and T-cell function, although its function in platelets remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate the ability of the platelet agonists collagen, convulxin, and thrombin to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of CD31. Furthermore, we show that this event is independent of platelet aggregation and secretion and is accompanied by an increase in surface expression of CD31. A kinase capable of phosphorylating CD31 was detected in CD31 immunoprecipitates, and its activity was increased following activation of platelets. CD31 tyrosine phosphorylation was reduced or abolished by the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2, suggesting a role for these enzymes. In accordance with this, each of the Src family members expressed in platelets, namely Fyn, Lyn, Src, Yes, and Hck, was shown to co-immunoprecipitate with CD31. The involvement of Src family kinases in this process was confirmed through the study of mouse platelets deficient in Fyn."
https://openalex.org/W2129929276,"Ca2+-sensitive tyrosine kinase Pyk2 was shown to be involved in angiotensin (Ang) II-mediated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) via transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R). In this study, we tested the involvement of Pyk2 and EGF-R in Ang II-induced activation of JNK and c-Jun in cardiac fibroblasts. Ang II markedly stimulated JNK activities, which were abolished by genistein and intracellular Ca2+ chelators but partially by protein kinase C depletion. Inhibition of EGF-R did not affect Pyk2 and JNK activation by Ang II. Stable transfection with a dominant negative (DN) mutant for Pyk2 (PKM) completely blocked JNK activation by Ang II. DN mutants of Rac1 (DN-Rac1) and MEK kinase (DN-MEKK1) also abolished it, whereas those of Cdc42, RhoA, and Ha-Ras had no effect. Induction of c-Jun gene transcription by Ang II was abolished in PKM, DN-Rac1, and DN-MEKK1, in which Ang II-induced binding of ATF2/c-Jun heterodimer to the activator protein-1 sequence at −190 played a key role. These results suggest that 1) in cardiac fibroblasts activation of JNK and c-Jun by Ang II is initiated by Pyk2-dependent signalings but not by downstream signals of EGF-R or Ras, 2) Rac1 but not Cdc42 is required for JNK activation by Ang II upstream of MEKK1, and 3) ATF-2/c-Jun binding to the activator protein-1 sequence at −190 plays a key role for induction of c-Jun gene by Ang II."
https://openalex.org/W1487560622,"We cloned a gene encoding Scutellaria beta-glucuronidase (sGUS) that is involved in the initiation of H(2)O(2) metabolism in skullcap (Scutellaria baicalensis). This gene consists of a 1581-nucleotide open reading frame, the deduced amino acid sequence of which contains an ATP/GTP binding site and a leucine zipper motif. sGUS has apparent similarity to the heparan sulfate-metabolizing beta-glucuronidase heparanase but no homology to family 2 beta-glucuronidases. In addition, neither the family 2 glycosylhydrolase signature nor family 2 acid-base catalyst was found in this enzyme. These results suggested that sGUS does not belong to the family 2 beta-glucuronidases. We modified several residues predicted to act as the acid-base or nucleophilic residue of sGUS by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutations at Glu(212) or Glu(329) resulted in much lower k(cat)/K(m) values in the mutants as compared with the wild-type enzyme, indicating that these are the acid-base and nucleophilic residues of the active site, respectively. Moreover, similar site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that Tyr(281) is also involved in the beta-glucuronidase activity. The amino acid sequences of small regions containing these active site residues were conserved in heparanases. As sGUS has various structural characteristics in common with heparanase, we concluded that sGUS and heparanase belong to the same new family."
https://openalex.org/W1576236928,"The recently identified natural peptide ligand, tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues (TIP39) for the parathyroid hormone-2 (PTH2) receptor has been structurally characterized by high resolution NMR, circular dichroism, and computer simulations. The structural features of TIP39, determined in the presence of a zwitterionic lipid to mimic the membrane environment of the G-protein-coupled PTH2 receptor, consist of two α-helices, Ala5–Arg21 and Leu26–Val35. Although TIP39 shares limited sequence homology with parathyroid hormone (PTH), a comparison of the structural features of TIP39 and PTH illustrates a similar topological display of residues of the N-terminal helix important for PTH2 receptor activation. The C-terminal helix of TIP39 differs from that of PTH with respect to size and amphipathicity, suggesting an altered mode of binding for TIP39, consistent with the receptor chimera and ligand truncation studies presented in the accompanying paper (Hoare, S. R. J., Clark, J. A., and Usdin, T. B. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 27274–27283). The structural characterization of TIP39 also provides some insight into the lack of affinity of this novel ligand for the PTH1 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1971389767,"The signal recognition particle (SRP) receptor (SR) is a heterodimer of two polypeptides (SRα and SRβ) that each contain a GTP-binding domain. The GTP-binding domain in the peripheral membrane SRα subunit has a well defined role in regulating targeting of SRP-ribosome-nascent chain complexes to the translocon. The only well established function for the transmembrane SRβ subunit is anchoring SRα on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Deletion of the amino-terminal transmembrane domain of SRβ did not affect receptor dimerization, but revealed a cryptic translocation signal that overlaps the GTPase domain. We demonstrate that the domain of SRα that binds SRβ does so by binding directly to the nucleotide-bound form of the GTPase domain of SRβ. An SRβ mutant containing an amino acid substitution that allows the GTPase domain to bind XTP dimerized with SRα most efficiently in the presence of XTP or XDP, but not ATP. Our results suggest an additional level of regulation of SRP receptor function based on regulated dissociation of the receptor subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2002910379,"The proteasome plays a crucial role in the proteolytic processing of antigens presented to T cells in the context of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. However, the rules governing the specificity of cleavage sites are still largely unknown. We have previously shown that a cytolytic T lymphocyte-defined antigenic peptide derived from the MAGE-3 tumor-associated antigen (MAGE-3271–279, FLWGPRALV in one-letter code) is not presented at the surface of melanoma cell lines expressing the MAGE-3 protein. By using purified proteasome and MAGE-3271–279 peptides extended at the C terminus by 6 amino acids, we identified predominant cleavages after residues 278 and 280 but no detectable cleavage after residue Val279, the C terminus of the antigenic peptide. In the present study, we have investigated the influence of Pro275, Leu278, and Glu280 on the proteasomal digestion of MAGE-3271–285 substituted at these positions. We show that positions 278 and 280 are major proteasomal cleavage sites because they tolerate most amino acid substitutions. In contrast, the peptide bond after Val279 is a minor cleavage site, influenced by both distal and proximal amino acid residues."
https://openalex.org/W2028083131,"Abstract Domain movement is sometimes essential for substrate recognition by an enzyme. X-ray crystallography of aminotransferase with a series of aliphatic substrates showed that the domain movement of aspartate aminotransferase was changed dramatically from an open to a closed form by the addition of only one CH2 to the side chain of the C4 substrate CH3(CH2)C(α)H(NH3 +) COO−. These crystallographic results and reaction kinetics (Kawaguchi, S., Nobe, Y., Yasuoka, J., Wakamiya, T., Kusumoto, S., and Kuramitsu, S. (1997) J. Biochem.

BioEssays. 1994; 16: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The physiological oxidant for TMADH is the electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF) of the organism, which becomes reduced only to the level of the semiquinone under physiological conditions (2Steenkamp D.J. Mallinson J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 429: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), giving the following overall reaction stoichiometry:N(CH3) 3+H2O+2ETFox→NH(CH3) 2+H2C=O+2ETFsqEquation 1 The reaction is thought to proceed via an initial imine product, which is then nonenzymatically hydrolyzed to the secondary amine and formaldehyde. TMADH is a member of a small but important group of amine-oxidizing flavoproteins that includes the monoamine oxidases A and B, sarcosine oxidase, and methyltryptophan oxidase. In each of these enzymes the flavin cofactor is covalently linked to the polypeptide in the active sites. In the case of TMADH this covalent linkage is to Cys-30 of the polypeptide at position 6 of the isoalloxazine ring of the FMN cofactor (4Steenkamp D.J. McIntire W.S. Kenney W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2818-2824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Steenkamp D.J. Kenney W.C. Singer T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2812-2817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Loss of this linkage by mutation of Cys-30 to alanine results in a 6-fold decrease in the initial reduction of the enzyme-bound flavin, although this step remains at least an order of magnitude faster than catalysis, which is principally rate limited by product dissociation. More significantly, loss of the covalent linkage predisposes the flavin to nucleophilic attack by hydroxide to yield 6-hydroxyl-FMN, which is catalytically inert. It is thus evident that at least in the case of TMADH the covalent linkage to cysteine prevents inactivation of the active site flavin. The covalent linkage also perturbs the spectral characteristics of the flavin, the major effect being a significant decrease in the extinction coefficient associated with the near-UV absorbance band of the native cofactor; this is essentially absent in 6-cysteinyl-FMN (5Steenkamp D.J. Kenney W.C. Singer T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2812-2817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the 6-cysteinyl-FMN, which constitutes the site of amine oxidation in the enzyme, TMADH possesses a 4Fe/4S center of the bacterial ferredoxin variety (6Hill C.L. Steenkamp D.J. Holm R.H. Singer T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This second redox-active center is located in relatively close proximity (within 4.5 Å edge-to-edge) of the C-8 methyl of the covalently linked flavin (7Lim L.W. Shamala N. Mathews F.S.

Chem. 1988; 263: 3075-3078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under certain conditions, e.g. upon reduction with high concentrations of substrate or upon reduction with dithionite in the presence of the inhibitor tetramethylammonium chloride, the enzyme can be obtained in a two-electron reduced form in which one electron is on the flavin (as the anionic semiquinone) and the other on the iron-sulfur center with the two S = 1/2 spin systems interacting strongly to give what is effectively a triplet state (9Steenkamp D.J.

This spin-interacting state exhibits an unusually strong half-field EPR signal, and its magnetic properties have been the object of considerable interest over the years (11Steenkamp D.J. Singer T.P.

The spectral contributions of the 6-cysteinyl-FMN and iron-sulfur center to the UV-visible spectral change observed upon full reduction of TMADH by reagents such as sodium dithionite have been successfully deconvoluted (21Huang L. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23958-23965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The two centers have very closely overlapping absorbance changes, with broad maxima in the oxidized-minus-reduced difference spectra centered at approximately 450 nm. The extinction change attributable to the two-electron reduction of 6-cysteinyl-FMN is 14.0 mm−1 cm−1, however, and that for the one-electron reduction of the iron-sulfur center 5.5 mm−1 cm−1. The spectral changes associated with formation of the neutral and anionic forms of the 6-cysteinyl-FMN have not been characterized previously. It has been demonstrated that in the course of turnover, reducing equivalents obtained by the flavin upon oxidation of substrate are passed first to the iron-sulfur center and then onto ETF (9Steenkamp D.J.

Kinetic studies of wild type and various site-directed mutants of TMADH identified a region on the surface of the enzyme nearest the buried iron-sulfur center in the vicinity of Tyr-442 as being important in this interprotein electron transfer process. Mutation of this tyrosine to a glycine, for example, reduces the limiting rate of ETF reduction (i.e. reduction within the pre-formed TMADH·ETF complex) from 186 s−1 to 6.1 s−1, while increasing the K d for the reduced enzyme-ETF complex from 16 μm to 180 μm (16Huang L. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13401-13406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Electron transfer between the 6-cysteinyl-FMN and iron-sulfur center in two-electron reduced TMADH has been examined using a pH-jump technique to perturb the distribution of reducing equivalents between the flavin and iron-sulfur center (14Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15244-15252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Rohlfs R.J. Huang L. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22196-22207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The investigators find that electron transfer between the two centers is intrinsically fast, with a lower limit of approximately 1000 s−1. Significantly, coupling of prototropic equilibria to the electron transfer process, because of ionization of the flavin semiquinone and hydroquinone oxidation states, is thermodynamically linked to electron transfer to the extent that rates of electron equilibration between the two exhibit a significant pH-dependence, with apparent rate constants varying from 300 s−1 to 1000 s−1 or more over the pH range of 6–10 (18Rohlfs R.J. Huang L. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22196-22207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast to the two-electron reduced enzyme, electron transfer within one-electron reduced TMADH has been examined previously in only one case using flash photolysis (19Hazzard J.T. McIntire W.S. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4559-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Complications arising from the disproportionation of the photolytically generated 5-deazariboflavin radical used in the study to give the hydroquinone (followed by the slow reduction of the enzyme by the hydroquinone thus generated) have seriously complicated the interpretation of the results, however (14Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15244-15252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pulse radiolysis is an alternate method by which reducing equivalents can be rapidly (μs time scale) introduced into redox-active proteins and subsequent intramolecular electron transfer can be followed. This method involves the generation of quantified concentrations of strongly reducing or oxidizing species by a rapid pulse of high-energy electrons applied to an aqueous sample (20Land E.J. Swallow A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 162: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Under appropriate conditions, the primary radiolytic radicals ( eaq−, H⋅, HO⋅) can be rapidly scavenged by added reagents to form strongly reducing species having desirable chemical properties for reaction with biological molecules. In the present work, pulse radiolytic methods (22Hille R. Anderson R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5608-5615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Anderson R.F. Hille R. Stevenson K.J. Massey V. Williams Jr., C.H. Flavins and Flavoproteins. University of Calgary Press, Calgary1997: 865-868Google Scholar) were used to rapidly generate and characterize the one-electron reduced flavin semiquinone of TMADH at low and high pH, thereby establishing the UV-visible spectral changes associated with formation of these two mechanistically important species and completing the spectral characterization of the enzyme. In addition, electron transfer within the one-electron reduced enzyme was examined subsequent to the rapid initial reduction of the enzyme by radiolytically generated radicals. A comparison of the present results with those obtained previously for electron transfer within two-electron reduced enzyme indicates significant differences in behavior that relate directly to the catalytic behavior of the enzyme. Specifically, the neutral flavin semiquinone was stabilized to a greater extent in the two-electron reduced as compared with the one-electron reduced enzyme. Whereas the range of rate constants for electron transfer was comparable in the two partially reduced enzyme forms, the pH dependence of the observed rate constants was different in the one- as opposed to two-electron reduced enzyme. Trimethylamine dehydrogenase was purified from M. methylotrophus W3A1 as described initially by Steenkamp and Mallinson (2Steenkamp D.J. Mallinson J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 429: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), except that gel filtration was performed using Sephacryl S-200 rather than Sephadex G-200. An extinction coefficient of 27.3 mm−1cm−1 at 442 nm was used to determine the enzyme concentration. Phenylhydrazine-modified enzyme was prepared by incubating the enzyme with reagent (Sigma) for 4 h at room temperature in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, as described by Kasprzak et al. (25Kasprzak A.A. Papas E.J. Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Ferricenium hexafluorophosphate was prepared according to the method of Thorpe and co-workers (26Lehman T.C. Hale D.E. Bhala A. Thorpe C. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 186: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 27Lehman T.C. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10594-10602Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); the iron-sulfur center of the enzyme was rendered redox-inert by reaction with this reagent for 4 h at room temperature in 0.1 mborate buffer, pH 10, as described previously by Huang et al. (21Huang L. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23958-23965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). N-methylnicotinamide (NMN) was purchased from Sigma, and 5-deazalumiflavin (dFl) was the generous gift of Dr. Vincent Massey (Dept. of Biological Chemistry, University of Michigan). All other reagents were of the highest purity commercially available and were used without further purification. Pulse radiolysis was performed using the University of Auckland computer-controlled 4 MeV Dynaray linear accelerator facility using a custom-built detection system fitted with Supracil optics. Pulses of electrons to give doses on the order of 4–6 Gy (J/kg) in 200 ns were used to initiate radical reactions under controlled conditions, with dosimetry carried out before each experimental run to quantify the yield of radicals generated with each pulse. A potassium thiocyanate dosimeter was used for this calibration using a radiation chemical yield for SCN⨪2 of 0.29 μmol/J and an extinction coefficient of 7.58 mm−1 cm−1 for the radical intermediate (28Schuler R.H. Patterson L.K. Janata E. J. Phys. Chem. 1980; 84: 2088-2089Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Under the present experimental conditions, the primary radiolytically generated radicals are the aquated electron, eaq−, HO⋅, and H⋅. By saturating the solutions with N2O, the aquated electron was rapidly converted to HO⋅ and with formate present at a concentration of 0.1 m, both H⋅ and HO⋅were converted to CO⨪2 within the electron pulse (typically 200 ns). In the presence of (0.1–2.5 mm)N-methylnicotinamide or 5-deazalumiflavin, CO⨪2 was quantitatively converted to NMN⋅ or dFl⋅ radicals within a few microseconds of the electron pulse. It is these strongly reducing radical species generated under the present experimental conditions within the first 5 μs after the pulse that represent the proximal reductants of TMADH. In separate control experiments, reduction of enzyme by NMN⋅ or dFl⋅ radicals were found to take place with second-order rate constants of 2.0 ± 0.2 × 108m−1 s−1 and 4.6 ± 0.2 × 107m−1s−1, respectively. That is, under the typical experimental conditions of ∼80 μm TMADH, enzyme was reduced with pseudo first-order rate constants of 1.6 × 104 and 3.7 × 103 s−1, respectively. Difference spectra of one-electron reduced enzyme thus generated were determined relative to pre-pulsed oxidized enzyme and are presented here as extinction change, Δε (mm−1 cm−1) taking into account the observed change in absorbance and the experimental radiolytic dose and using a value of 0.6 μm reductants produced per Gy of pulse dose. Only a limited range of wavelengths (>420 nm) could be investigated using dFl⋅ radicals as reductant because a 400-nm optical filter had to be employed so as to avoid rapid deazaflavin-sensitized photoreduction of the enzyme by the analyzing beam subsequent to the radiolytic pulse. The temperature of the pulse experiments reported here was 21 ± 1 °C. Under the conditions of the present pulse experiments, involving the generation of strongly reducing (rather than oxidizing) species, the enzyme was found to be minimally damaged during the course of the radiolytic experiment. The absorption spectrum of enzyme reoxidized after radiolysis was indistinguishable from that of the starting material and losses in activity were negligible (less than 5%). The contributions of the flavin and iron-sulfur centers of TMADH to the spectral change observed upon reduction of the enzyme with reagents such as sodium dithionite have previously been deconvoluted (13Fournel A. Gambarelli S. Guigliarelli B. More C. Asso M. Chouteau G. Hille R. Bertrand P. J. Chem. Phys. 1998; 109: 10905-10913Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The 6-thioether linkage of the FMN of TMADH significantly perturbs the absorption spectrum of the flavin chromophore. The absorption band of the oxidized cofactor centered at 440 nm is somewhat enhanced in extinction coefficient (∼16 mm−1cm−1 as opposed to ∼12 mm−1cm−1 for normal flavins), whereas the near-UV absorption band of the native cofactor at 365 nm is essentially lost. As a result, the well characterized absorption spectra for the neutral and anionic semiquinone forms of natural flavins cannot be used with TMADH. Given the fact that reduction of enzyme by substrate yields a two-electron reduced form of the enzyme in which the iron-sulfur center is reduced and the flavin is present as the anionic semiquinone, it was of interest to establish the UV-visible spectral properties of the semiquinone oxidation state of the 6-cysteinyl-FMN of TMADH. Previously, Pace and Stankovich (29Pace N. Stankovich M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 287: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) reported the spectral change associated with the one-electron reduction of the 6-cysteinyl-FMN of TMADH to the anionic semiquinone, as observed in the course of spectroelectrochemical titrations. These experiments were carried out in the presence of the inhibitor tetramethylammonium chloride (TMAC), which proved necessary to sufficiently resolve the several electrochemical processes taking place. Just as TMAC perturbs the reduction potentials of the flavin, it likely perturbs the absorption spectrum of the anionic semiquinone, and in any case no extinction changes were reported in this earlier work. To determine the spectral change associated with formation of both the neutral and anionic forms of the flavin center of TMADH, enzyme in which the iron-sulfur center had been rendered redox-inert by prior reaction with the reagent ferricenium hexafluorophosphate at high pH (21Huang L. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23958-23965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was reduced with radiolytically generated NMN⋅ radical by one equivalent, generating spectral changes of the type shown in Fig.1. The spectral changes shown are relative to the spectrum of oxidized enzyme prior to the pulse. In these experiments, it was possible to quantitate the radiolytic yield of NMN⋅ from its absorbance at 410 nm (ε = 3200m−1 cm−1, Ref. 20Land E.J. Swallow A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 162: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and under our experimental conditions of high protein concentration (typically 80 μm or more) and low radiolytic dose (generating no more than 5 μm NMN⋅ immediately after pulse), the NMN⋅ was found to react essentially quantitatively with the protein with no significant formation of the (NMN)2 dimer (k dimerization = 2.0 × 109m−1 s−1, Ref. 22Hille R.

As shown in Fig. 1, the spectral changes observed when the experiment was performed at pH 10, generating the anionic flavin semiquinone (triangles), and at pH 7.0, generating the neutral semiquinone (squares), yield distinct difference spectra. In the case of the high pH experiment, a pronounced absorption increase at 365 nm (Δε = 3,700 m−1cm−1) was observed that has been previously ascribed to the anionic flavin semiquinone, although the spectral change associated with formation of this form of the cofactor had not otherwise been described. As seen in Fig. 1 (triangles), formation of the anionic 6-cysteinyl-FMN⨪ from the oxidized cofactor has an associated extinction change that consists of an absorbance decrease at ∼440 nm (Δε = 1, 400m−1 cm−1) and a small absorbance increase above 500 nm (Δε = 900m−1 cm−1). The changes seen at 365 and 520 nm were roughly comparable with those reported for the anionic semiquinone of normal flavins (30Massey V. Hemmerich P Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1980; 8: 246-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) although the extinction decrease was significantly reduced. The implication is that the anionic semiquinone of 6-cysteinyl-FMN retains a considerably greater portion of the absorbance of the oxidized cofactor in this region of the absorption spectrum than is the case with normal flavins. As with the anionic semiquinone, the spectral change observed on formation of the neutral semiquinone of 6-cysteinyl-FMN at pH 7 was qualitatively similar to that seen with normal flavins (Fig. 1,squares). The 6-cysteinyl-FMNH⋅ was characterized by a long-wavelength absorbance (although the extinction change associated with formation of this species is 2200m−1 cm−1, somewhat lower than was seen with normal flavins) and a significant decrease in the 440-nm absorbance of the oxidized cofactor (Δε = −2000 m−1 cm−1, again somewhat less than the comparable spectral change seen on formation of the neutral semiquinone of normal flavins). As expected, the extinction change at 365 nm was greatly reduced for the neutral 6-cysteinyl semiquinone compared with the anionic form. Comparable spectral changes were observed for both the anionic and neutral 6-cysteinyl flavin semiquinones using dFl⋅ rather than NMN⋅ as the proximal reductant of enzyme. However, in this case it was not possible to determine spectral changes below 400 nm because of the intrinsic absorbance of the deazaflavin itself and the need to use optical filters to avoid dFl-sensitized photoreduction of the enzyme in the analyzing beam of the pulse radiolysis apparatus. In addition to the above protocol using ferricenium hexafluorophosphate to render the iron-sulfur center of TMADH redox-inert, it was also possible to react the flavin of the enzyme with phenylhydrazine to render this center redox-inert (25Kasprzak A.A. Papas E.J. Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this case, one-electron reduction of the enzyme by radiolytically generated NMN⋅ yielded the pH-independent spectral change associated with reduction of the iron-sulfur center. This spectral change, as shown in Fig. 2, was characterized by a broad rather featureless absorption decrease centered at ∼430 nm with an associated extinction change of −5.8 mm−1 cm−1. This extinction change is in very good agreement with that previously determined from electrochemical reduction (29Pace N. Stankovich M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 287: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and reductive titration (19Hazzard J.T. McIntire W.S. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4559-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) of phenylhydrazine-inactivated enzyme and also in line with extinction changes for 4Fe/4S centers in other proteins (typically ∼6 mm−1cm−1, Ref. 31Stephens P.J.

With the spectral changes associated with reduction of the iron-sulfur center and formation of both the anionic and neutral forms of the flavin semiquinone established, it was now possible to interpret the spectral changes associated with the reaction of native trimethylamine dehydrogenase with radiolytically generated NMN⋅ in which electron transfer from one site to another can occur subsequent to the initial one-electron reduction of the enzyme. Electron transfer in two-electron reduced TMADH has been examined previously using a pH-jump protocol in which rate constants associated with the oxidation-reduction equilibrium FMNH2:Fe/Sox ⇆ FMN⨪:Fe/Sred have been determined. The observed rate constants for approach to the new equilibrium position subsequent to a rapid change in the solution pH are in the range 300–1000 s−1 at 25 °C with a pronounced U-shaped pH dependence (15Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13147-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although the thermodynamics of the FMN⨪:Fe/Sox⇆ FMN:Fe/Sred equilibration in one-electron reduced enzyme was expected to be comparable with that for the above equilibration in two-electron reduced enzyme (because the reduction potentials for the quinone/semiquinone and semiquinone/hydroquinone redox couples are comparable, +44 and +36 mV, respectively, at pH 7.0, Ref. 29Pace N. Stankovich M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 287: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the two processes need not exhibit the same kinetics because there is no reason to expect that the reorganization energies for formation of the flavin semiquinone and hydroquinone are the same. Furthermore, the second half-potential involves reduction to the level of the (anionic) flavin hydroquinone and thus necessarily involves the uptake of a proton; it may thus exhibit a different pH dependence than does the first half-potential. For these reasons, we investigated electron transfer within the one-electron reduced enzyme so that a comparison with the values obtained with the two-electron reduced enzyme could be made explicitly. The spectral change associated with the initial reduction of native oxidized TMADH by NMN⋅ radicals over the pH range 6–10 shows only a very small absorbance increase at 365 nm (Δε ∼500m−1 cm−1) and a decrease in absorbance in the region 380–500 nm with the maximum change in the 420 nm region (Δε ∼5,800 m−1cm−1), as shown in Fig. 4and in Fig. 5. These spectral features are consistent with the spectral change known to be associated with reduction of the 4Fe/4S center in TMADH (see Fig. 2 and Ref. 21Huang L. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23958-23965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), indicating that the initial rapid reduction takes place principally at the Fe/S center rather than the flavin (compare with Fig. 2). Subsequent to this initial kinetic phase, a subsequent kinetic process was observed whose rate constant was independent of enzyme concentration and had an associated spectral change reflecting formation of the red anionic flavin semiquinone with a characteristic increase in absorbance at 365 nm (see Figs. 1 and4). 2In the experiments shown in Figs. 4 and 5, reoxidation of the iron-sulfur center of TMADH is necessarily concomitant with reduction of the flavin to give the semiquinone in the course of intramolecular electron transfer. The spectral change associated with iron-sulfur reoxidation is known to be centered on the absorption maximum of the 6-cysteinyl-FMN of the enzyme although with only about one-third the extinction of that attributed to the flavin (13Fournel A. Gambarelli S. Guigliarelli B. More C. Asso M. Chouteau G. Hille R. Bertrand P. J. Chem. Phys. 1998; 109: 10905-10913Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is thus very difficult to deconvolute the specific spectral change associated with reoxidation of the iron-sulfur center in the present experiments. Both these observations were consistent with the observed process involving intramolecular electron transfer from the Fe/S center to the flavin within the one-electron reduced enzyme. We note that the apparent differences in the 400–550 nm region between the spectra for the red anionic flavin semiquinone shown in Figs. 1 and 3 are because of differences in absorption spectra for the ferricenium hexafluorophosphate-treated and native enzyme, respectively, and not because of changes in the absorbance of the semiquinone. The magnitude of the spectral change associated with intramolecular electron transfer within native one-electron reduced enzyme was small, indicating that electron transfer from the iron-sulfur center to the 6-cysteinyl-FMN occurred to only a relatively small extent. This is consistent with electron transfer from the Fe/S center to the flavin being thermodynamically uphill (see below). Similar results were obtained when dFl⋅ was used as the proximal reductant of the enzyme,i.e. initial reduction occurred at the Fe/S center followed by intramolecular electron transfer; a similar spectrum to that seen upon reduction of the enzyme by NMN⋅ was observed (Fig. 3).Figure 5Overall spectral change following the one-electron reduction of native TMADH by NMN⋅ and dFl ⋅ radicals. Comparison of the absorption spectrum of native TMADH at pH 6–7 (circles) with one-electron reduced enzyme produced on reaction with (i) NMN⋅ radicals measured after 2 ms (squares), and (ii) dFl⋅ radicals measured after 1 ms (triangles).

Spectral changes observed following pulse radiolysis of a N2O-saturated solution containing sodium formate (0.1m) and TMADH (126 μm), NMN+ (2.5 mm), and phosphate (10 mm, pH 6), where (i) the initially formed NMN⋅ radical (circles, measured immediately after the pulse of 10 Gy in 0.2 μs producing a radical yield of 6.8 μm) decays rapidly within 50 μs to the second spectrum (inverted triangles, ▿), which in turn decays within 2 ms to a third spectrum (squares); and (ii) TMADH (83 μm), deazaflavin (0.1 mm) and phosphate (10 mm, pH 7) where a partial spectrum (triangles, ▵) resulting from the reaction of dFl⋅radicals is measured 1 ms after the pulse (4 Gy in 0.2 μs producing a radical yield of 2.7 μm). Reduction of enzyme by NMN⋅ or dFl⋅ radicals was found to take place with second-order rate constants of 2.0 ± 0.2 × 108m−1 s−1 and 4.6 ± 0.2 × 107m−1 s−1, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The rate constant for intramolecular electron equilibration from the reduced Fe/S center to 6-cysteinyl-FMN was found to be pH-dependent, increasing by a factor of almost 10 from 210 ± 22 s−1 at pH 10.0 to 1860 ± 260 s−1 at pH 6.0. This result contrasts to that seen with two-electron reduced enzyme where the fastest apparent rates of electron transfer were seen at high rather than low pH. The rate of electron transfer was also studied in D2O at pD 6.0, where a considerable decrease in the rate constant for electron transfer compared with that in water was observed to a value of 139 ± 37 s−1. The effective solvent kinetic isotope effect of 13.4 ± 1.9 was surprisingly large given that the unprotonated anionic flavin semiquinone was formed in the reaction. The effect possibly arises from the sequential electron transfer from reduced Fe/S center and protonation of a small proportion of the red flavin semiquinone at pH 6. Both the kinetic and spectral data imply that for a blue flavin semiquinone to exist in one-electron reduced native protein, then its pK a would have to be lower that 5.5. Unfortunately, this could not be confirmed in the present study because the enzyme is unstable below pH 6.0. The present work has permitted the spectral characterization of the anionic and neutral semiquinone forms of the unusual 6-cysteinyl-FMN center of TMADH. In both cases the spectra were generally reminiscent of the spectra observed for the corresponding species seen with the native flavin cofactor although in each case there were important differences. The spectrum of the anionic semiquinone in particular is of particular interest as it relates to the absorption spectrum manifested by two-electron reduced enzyme upon formation of the unique spin-interacting state manifested by TMADH. Previous work demonstrated that the anionic form of the semiquinone is required for the interaction (15Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13147-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, the UV-visible absorption spectrum of the enzyme in the spin-interacting state exhibited the characteristic maximum at 365 nm as well as a shoulder at 510 nm, reflecting the participation of the anionic form of the semiquinone specifically. Formation of the spin-interacting state per sedoes not give rise to a distinctive absorption spectrum but the observed spectrum of the enzyme in this state is the simple sum of the contributions of the flavin anionic semiquinone and reduced iron-sulfur center (18Rohlfs R.J. Huang L. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22196-22207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The present work demonstrates that these spectral features are attributable to the anionic form of the semiquinone and at the same time permits a determination of the extinction coefficient for the semiquinone. The spectral change reported here for formation of the anionic semiquinone was generally similar to that described previously by Pace and Stankovich (29Pace N. Stankovich M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 287: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) in the presence of TMAC. The ratio of the extinction changes at 365 and 440 nm was larger in the present work (it was approximately 1:1 in the work of Pace and Stankovich (29Pace N. Stankovich M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 287: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and more than 3:1 here, see Fig. 1), and the absorbance change above 500 nm seen here was not observed in the earlier work. These observations indicate that binding of TMAC that was used in the previous study does indeed perturb the absorption spectrum of the flavin semiquinone. Intramolecular electron transfer observed subsequent to the initial radiolytic reduction of TMADH by one equivalent is found to be quite fast, as expected given the close proximity of the two redox-active centers in the enzyme. The rate constant for electron transfer increases from 210 s−1 at pH 10 to 1860 s−1at pH 6. Although the range of values observed was comparable with that seen for electron transfer within two electron-reduced enzyme (in which the flavin semiquinone/hydroquinone rather than quinone/semiquinone couple is func- tioning), the trend is the opposite. In two-electron reduced enzyme, the observed rate constant for electron transfer triples from ∼300 s−1 at pH 7 to approximately 1000 s−1 at pH 10 (14, 18). The basis for this difference in pH dependence necessarily has to do with the involvement of the additional prototropic equilibria associated with formation of the flavin hydroquinone in the case of electron transfer in two-electron reduced enzyme (involving discrete ionizations associated with the flavin semiquinone as well as the hydroquinone, Ref. 18Rohlfs R.J. Huang L. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22196-22207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Electron transfer occurring from the iron-sulfur center to the 6-cysteinyl flavin is thermodynamically uphill, in that the reduction potential for the flavin quinone/semiquinone couple is some 60 mV lower than that for the iron-sulfur center (+44 mV for the quinone/semiquinone half-potential as compared with +102 mV for the Fe/S potential, Ref. 29Pace N. Stankovich M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 287: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Given that the initial reduction event occurred entirely (within experimental error) at the iron-sulfur center, the spectral change observed was associated with the small re-equilibration between the centers to give the 10:1 ratio of reduced iron-sulfur to flavin semiquinone expected on the basis of the difference in potentials. In light of the known pK aof ∼8.0 for the semiquinone in two-electron reduced enzyme (18Rohlfs R.J. Huang L. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22196-22207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), it is surprising that for the one-electron reduced enzyme the anionic form of the semiquinone was observed even at low pH. The implication is that the oxidation state of the iron-sulfur center (oxidized when the flavin semiquinone forms in one-electron reduced enzyme but reduced when the semiquinone forms in two-electron reduced enzyme) influences the pK a of the flavin semiquinone. The direction of the effect on pK a can be rationalized on electrostatic grounds: the additional negative electric charge on the reduced iron-sulfur cluster upon reduction makes it more likely for the flavin to become protonated. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the effect, amounting to a pK a shift of at least two, was surprisingly large. Even more surprising is the fact that whereas only the red anionic from of the flavin semiquinone was observed in the course of radiolytic reduction of the native enzyme, the neutral form of the semiquinone could be readily generated upon radiolytic reduction of the ferricenium-inactivated enzyme. It is possible that chemical modification in addition to oxidation of the iron-sulfur center has occurred in the course of the reaction. Ferricenium is known to be a quite powerful oxidant capable of oxidizing tyrosine residues under the present reaction conditions of high pH (32Conrads T. Hille R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7787-7791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), although we noted that no such radical species was observed in the reaction of this reagent with TMADH (21Huang L. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23958-23965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These points concerning the ionization of the flavin notwithstanding, the present results indicate that electron transfer within one-electron TMADH is from one to two orders of magnitude faster than turnover throughout the pH range 6–10, as is the case within two-electron reduced enzyme. This is important as the behavior of the one-electron reduced state has been implicated in accounting for the otherwise counterintuitive steady-state inhibition of TMADH by high concentrations of substrate (21Huang L. Rohlfs R.J. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23958-23965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 33Roberts P. Basran J. Wilson E.K. Hille R. Scrutton N.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12546-12552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The one-electron reduced form of the enzyme does accumulate in the steady-state after reaction of oxidized enzyme with an equivalent of trimethylamine, followed by reaction with one equivalent of ETF, with the electron distribution between reduced iron-sulfur on the one hand and flavin semiquinone on the other being perturbed by substrate. (Substrate and substrate-analog binding is known to stabilize the semiquinone formation at the expense of iron-sulfur reduction in the one-electron reduced enzyme (29Pace N. Stankovich M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 287: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).) To the extent that this occurs, the enzyme will be unable to react with trimethylamine because this is an obligatory two-electron process, and inhibition is expected. The behavior of the enzyme in the steady-state is accounted for in the context of this argument, which in turn is based on the assumption that electron transfer between the two centers is intrinsically rapid compared with catalysis. The present work demonstrates that this is indeed the case."

Kugi, M., Koga, T., Yamaguchi, K., and Arakawa, K. (1998) Arterioscler. Throm. Vasc. Biol. 18, 389-396), was produced in an Escherichia coli expression system. The purified recombinant proapoA-I V156E mutant was examined in its structural and functional properties, both, in the lipid-free and lipid-bound states. In the lipid-free form the mutant protein exhibited small changes in conformation, but was more stable, and quite resistant to self-association, compared with control apoA-I. The V156E mutant was able to interact with phospholipid (PL) at high PL:protein ratios (95:1, mol/mol), but was inefficient in forming reconstituted HDL (rHDL) complexes at lower PL:protein ratios (40:1). In the lipid-bound, rHDL state, the mutant protein was somewhat more alpha-helical and formed a larger complex (110 A) than control apoA-I (97 A). Furthermore, the rHDL particles containing the V156E mutant did not rearrange to smaller particles in the presence of low density lipoproteins, and had minimal reactivity with lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), compared with rHDL particles made with control apoA-I. These results suggest a key role for Val-156, or the adjacent central region of apoA-I in the modulation of apoA-I conformation, stability, and self-association in solution, and in the formation of small HDL, the conformational adaptability of apoA-I leading to structural rearrangements of HDL, and the activation of LCAT."
