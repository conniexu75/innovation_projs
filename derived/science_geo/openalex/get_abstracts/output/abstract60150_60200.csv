https://openalex.org/W1526385127,"Physical properties of the hydrocarbon region in lipid bilayers were studied in a series of liposomes of lecithin and sphingomyelin containing different concentrations of dicetylphosphate. The technique used was described previously and is based on fluorescence polarization analysis of a specific probe embedded in the analyzed region. The two probes employed in this study were perylene and 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, which simulate a rotating disc and a rotating rod, respectively. The determined dynamic properties of the hydrocarbon region in the lecithin liposomes differ markedly from those of the sphingomyelin liposomes. The hydrocarbon region of the lecithin liposomes is of an invariant phase between 0° and 60° characterized by a microviscosity at 25°, η (25°), of 0.8 ± 0.1 poise and a fusion activation energy, ΔE, of 8 ± 2 Cal per mole. In contradistinction to lecithin, the hydrocarbon region of the sphingomyelin liposomes displays a distinct phase transition at 32° ± 2°. The phase at temperatures above the transition point, presumably a liquid crystalline phase, is characterized by ΔE = 16 ± 4 Cal per mole, whereas the phase below it, presumably a gel state, possesses a ΔE value lower than 3 Cal per mole. In addition to that, the·hydrocarbon layer in sphingomyelin liposomes is much more viscous than in lecithin liposomes as shown by η (25°) = 6 ± 1 poise. All of the above characteristics are only slightly and irregularly affected by the presence of dicetylphosphate, despite the strong effects it exerts on the surface charge potential of the liposomes. This indicates that the forces which dictate the dynamic properties of the hydrocarbon region in lipid bilayers predominantly originate from hydrophobic interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1510278412,"Abstract Experiments using an inhibitor-stop assay and a rapid sampling technique were carried out to analyze and determine the kinetic parameters and energy requirements of the p-chloromercuribenzoate-sensitive phosphate transport process in rat liver mitochondria. Initial rates of phosphate transport were measured, under conditions where transport was the rate-limiting process. The Km and Vmax of transport were determined to be 1.84 ± 0.18 mm and 229 ± 19 nmoles x min-1 x mg-1, respectively, at 0°. Using the selective inhibitors N-ethylmaleimide and n-butyl malonate, the over-all phosphate transport activity can be resolved into two components. The kinetic parameters of these two activities at 0° are: for N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive transport, Km = 1.60 ± 0.19 mm and Vmax = 205 ± 19 nmoles x min-1 x mg-1; and for n-butyl malonate-sensitive transport, Km = 1.76 ± 0.29 mm and Vmax = 14.9 ± 2.2 nmoles x min-1 x mg-1. The rate of over-all transport can be accounted for by the sum of the two activities in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide or n-butyl malonate, but the apparent affinities of these two activities cannot be distinguished, within experimental error. Measurements of phosphate uptake, along with determinations of intramitochondrial volumes, show that the phosphate transport system catalyzes transport of phosphate against a concentration gradient at 0°. Inhibitors of respiration and ATP hydrolysis have no effect on this process; but the uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol causes a sharp decrease in phosphate uptake. Addition of inonophores which are postulated to allow uptake of H+ in exchange for intramitochondrial K+ (nigericin or 2,4-dinitrophenol plus valinomycin) further inhibit the uptake of phosphate seen in the presence of uncoupler, and phosphate is excluded from the intramitochondrial volume. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that concentrative uptake of phosphate can be driven by the pH gradient of the mitochondrial membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1569351449,"Abstract A glutamine transaminase has been purified from the soluble portion of rat kidney homogenate; this enzyme, designated as kidney glutamine transaminase K, has different catalytic and physical properties from those previously found for the purified soluble glutamine transaminase of rat liver (liver glutamine transaminase L). Liver glutamine transaminase L is highly active toward methionine, glyoxylate, pyruvate, and several other substrates; kidney glutamine transaminase K is very active toward methionine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and the α-keto acid analogs of these amino acids and exhibits relatively little activity toward glyoxylate and pyruvate. Evidence was obtained that the K and L forms of glutamine transaminase are both present in liver and kidney. In addition, both forms of these enzymes are present in these tissues as mitochondrial as well as soluble isozymes. There are therefore at least four separate glutamine-α-keto acid transaminases in liver as well as kidney. Rat liver ω-amidase also occurs in both soluble and mitochondrial isozymic forms."
https://openalex.org/W1599371050,"Abstract Pargyline (N-benzyl-N-methyl-2-propynylamine), known to react stoichiometrically and irreversibly with the mitochondrial monoamine oxidase of bovine kidney, involving simultaneously the enzyme's flavin component, (Hellerman, L., and Erwin, V. G. (1968) J. Biol. Chem. 243, 5234–5243), has been shown to inactivate by forming a stable adduct with the flavin residue. Thus, the reaction of pargyline with an equivalent quantity of oxidase produced bleaching of the flavin at 455 nm and the appearance of a strongly absorbing species at 410 nm. Use of excess [7-14C]pargyline gave a stable 14C-protein product (1.1 residues of inhibitor bound per enzyme equivalent.) Proteolysis of the 14C-labeled protein and chromatographic fractionation of the peptides resulting revealed that most of the 14C label was associated with the fraction containing the altered coenzyme now absorbing maximally at 398 nm with a molar absorptivity of approximately 29,000 cm-1 m-1. Given here also is a procedure for the preparation of monoamine oxidase with twice the activity of the enzyme obtained previously (Erwin, V. G., and Hellerman, L. (1967) J. Biol. Chem. 242, 4230–4238). Based on estimates of enzyme concentration obtained by discontinuous titrations of the enzyme with pargyline, the respective values for the equivalent weight and the catalytic center activity (turnover) were calculated to be 109,000 and 525 for oxidation of benzylamine in air at pH 7.6 and 37°."
https://openalex.org/W1549578674,"Abstract Bacterial luciferase catalyzes the bioluminescent oxidation of FMNH2 and a long chain aliphatic aldehyde by O2, producing FMN and the corresponding carboxylic acid. The enzyme from bacterial strain MAV has been found to be inactivated by modification of a single cysteinyl residue per enzyme molecule by alkylating reagents such as iodoacetamide, iodoacetate, and N-ethylmaleimide. The apparent second order rate constants for inactivation at pH 7.0 (25°) are 1.67 x 103 m-1 min-1 for N-ethylmaleimide and 7.0 m-1 min-1 for iodoacetamide. Inactivation by iodoacetate at pH 7.0 is much less rapid, and the rate constant was not determined below pH 8. With all three reagents, the rate of inactivation increases with increasing pH in a manner suggesting a pKa of about 9.4 for the reactive sulfhydryl group. The rate of inactivation by N-[1-14C]ethylmaleimide correlates with the rate of modification of one sulfhydryl group on the α subunit, the β subunit being modified much less rapidly. Long chain aliphatic aldehydes protect the enzyme against inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide, the degree of protection increasing with increasing aldehyde chain length. The reactive sulfhydryl is also protected by FMN against alkylation. No binding of FMNH2 could be measured for iodoacetamide- or N-ethylmaleimide-modified enzyme. These results suggest that the reactive sulfhydryl is in or near the active center of the enzyme. The pH profiles of FMNH2 binding affinity and several catalytic parameters of the native enzyme do not implicate a group with a pKa near that of the sulfhydryl. The catalytic function (if any) for the reactive cysteine remains unknown."

https://openalex.org/W1575311161,"Abstract The amino acid sequence of a lysine-rich histone from rabbit thymus has been extended from residue 72 to residue 107. This region is rich in hydrophobic residues, poor in basic residues, and lacks proline. There is a region of at least 67 consecutive residues in the histone that contains no proline. The data establish that a previously reported phosphorylation site in calf thymus lysine-rich histone corresponds to residue 105 in the rabbit thymus histone sequenced. Two of the phosphorylation sites of lysine-rich histone have thus been shown to lie at the extremities of the region rich in hydrophobic residues and devoid of prolines. Additional tryptic peptides were isolated which together seem to account for the remaining half of the molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1546296744,"Abstract As an approach to the investigation of inhibiting effects of substituted hydrazines with monoamine oxidases, highly active bovine kidney mitochondrial oxidase was used to study the mechanism of phenylhydrazine-induced inactivation. Treatment of the enzyme under N2 with a 3-fold excess of inhibitor produced almost complete reduction of the enzyme flavin. Introduction of oxygen then caused 80% reoxidation of flavin with equivalent restoration of enzyme activity. With oxygen present initially phenylhydrazine effected almost complete irreversible inhibition. It appears that the enzyme catalyzed the oxidation of phenylhydrazine producing a highly unstable product, phenyldiazene (phenyldiimide), which inactivated the enzyme irreversibly. Such an inactivation was observed with phenyldiazene itself, prepared in situ via the decarboxylation of phenylazoformate. Our evidence, including a Hammett study correlating the effects of nuclear substitution in phenylhydrazines with rates of hydrazine-induced inhibition (ρ = -1.9) suggests that initial phenylhydrazine reduction of the flavoenzyme is rate-determining in the over-all (aerobic) inhibition process. Inactivation of the enzyme in air by treatment with either phenylhydrazine or phenyldiazene generated a damaged reduced type flavin, stable to autoxidation. Use of [1-14C]phenylhydrazine with the oxidase gave a stable 14C-protein product (1.4 residues of inhibitor bound per enzyme subunit). It is concluded that enzyme inactivation involves the formation of a stable flavin-inhibitor adduct, apparently without involvement of enzyme sulfhydryl groups. Similar effects were observed on treatment of the enzyme with 2-phenylethylhydrazine and dl-1-methyl-2-phenylethylhydrazine, suggesting that inhibition of the oxidase with aralkylhydrazines also involves diazene intermediates. Phenylethylhydrazine, however, was extensively converted to phenylacetaldehyde hydrazone (phenylethylidene hydrazine) either through rearrangement of the derived diazene or less probably through oxidation by an alternate route. The hydrazone was inactive as an enzyme inhibitor. Thus, the parent hydrazine had produced only 5% of the inhibition effected by an equimolar quantity of phenylhydrazine or alternatively by 1-methyl-2-phenylethylhydrazine, where the 1-methyl group presumably blocked hydrazone formation. Benzylhydrazine, as inhibitor only slightly less effective than phenylhydrazine, was minimally oxidized to hydrazone."

https://openalex.org/W1489355415,"Abstract The ultraviolet spectra of purified benzoyl-CoA, o-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA, m-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA, and p-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA were studied and the esterolytic reactions of these compounds were investigated at alkaline pH in the absence and presence of certain amino acids. Besides a major absorption band at 261 to 262 nm, the spectrum of each hydroxybenzoyl thioester near neutral pH contains a longer wavelength absorption band (corresponding to the phenolic moiety) which undergoes a progressive red shift of 40 to 45 nm as the pH is raised. Approximate pKa values determined for the phenolic groups at room temperature are 9.5 for o- and m-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA and 8.6 for p-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA. At high pH, difference spectra (i.e. before esterolysis minus after) of all thioesters except p-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA reveal thioester absorbance at 269 to 273 nm with emm ranging from 6.4 to 6.9. Rates of esterolysis of benzoyl-CoA, m-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA, and p-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA are directly proportional to hydroxide ion concentration and approximate apparent second order rate constants at 38° are 10, 1.8, and 0.11 m-1 min-1, respectively. In contrast, the rate of esterolysis of o-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA is essentially constant, i.e. the apparent pseudo-first order rate constant is ∼0.02 min-1, over a pH range of 9.6 to 12.1. The postulated mechanisms are that with all the benzoyl-CoAs except o-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA, hydroxide ions participate in a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the benzoate moiety; with o-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA, the neighboring oxy anion repels close approach of hydroxide ion and instead acts as a general base to form the hydroxyl nucleophile in situ by removing a proton from water. This conclusion is supported by the additional finding that at pH 9.54 and 38°, o-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA reacts rapidly with several amino acids (glycine, d- and l-alanine, l-valine, l-asparagine, and l-glutamine) to form salicylpeptides. Under these conditions glycine reacts more rapidly with o-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA than with benzoyl-CoA or p-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA. Glycine is also a more effective nucleophile than hydroxide ion for o-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA, whereas the opposite is true for benzoyl-CoA or p-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA."

https://openalex.org/W1494954000,"Abstract Benzoyl-CoA and o-, m-, and p-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA were synthesized by reacting the benzoyl chloride (formed from the respective benzoic acid and oxalyl chloride) with reduced CoA. The products were purified by chromatography (Sephadex LH 20, ethanol-water, 40:60 (v/v) and treatment with Chelex. Purity was confirmed in several ways: (a) a single ultraviolet-absorbing spot with a unique Rf value was observed for each of the CoA esters in each of several thin layer chromatographic solvent systems; (b) elemental stoichiometry (C, N, P, S, Li, H) agreed with prediction; (c) the values of ultraviolet extinction coefficients (emm) obtained by dry weight, enzymic release of thiol, and comparison of additive spectra of CoA and the respective benzoate with esterolysis spectra of the benzoylCoA all agreed (see accompanying article (18)); (d) the proton magnetic resonance (PMR) spectra were consistent with the structures of the benzoyl-CoAs and contained no extraneous signals. All of the signals in the PMR spectra of CoA, of acetyl-CoA and of the benzoyl-CoAs were assigned to specific moieties of the respective molecules. A downfield displacement of the CH2-S signal relative to its position in the spectrum of reduced CoA is characteristic of substitution on the sulfur atom, e.g. oxidized CoA, acetyl-CoA, benzoyl-CoA. All other signals of the CoA moiety in spectra of reduced CoA and acetyl-CoA under various conditions have identical chemical shifts. In contrast, in spectra of each of the benzoyl-CoAs in D2O, the (C-1')-H, (C-2)-H and (C-8)-H signals of the adenosyl moiety and the signals of the respective benzoyl protons are displaced upfield with respect to their positions in spectra of equimolar admixtures of reduced CoA with the respective benzoate (all other signals (except CH2-S) are essentially unchanged). These differences in chemical shift (Δδ) are independent of benzoyl-CoA concentration. The Δδ values are decreased by increased temperature and there is no difference between the spectrum of benzoyl-CoA in 70 % methanol-d4 (30 % D2O) and that of the CoA-benzoate admixture in D2O. These PMR data, and concentration, temperature, and solvent data suggested a specific intramolecular complex involving a ring stacking interaction between the adenosyl and benzoyl moieties with the charged and polar groups of the phosphopantetheine moiety facing the exterior, and the methyl and methylene groups forming a hydrophobic interior of the folded molecule. A Corey-Pauling-Koltun molecular model of the folded benzoyl-CoA molecule was constructed which allowed direct measurement of the distances of the three adenosyl protons from the center of the benzene ring. The values of Δδ predicted from these distances (due to the benzene ring current effect) correlated well with those observed. The values of ΔG = -0.7 Cal per mole, ΔH = -8.9 Cal per mole, and ΔS = -27 e.u. calculated from the temperature-dependence data are consistent with the proposed model of the intramolecular complex, involving more than one type of weak interaction. It is noted that approximately 65 % of the molecules of benzoyl-CoA exist in the folded conformation near physiological temperature."

https://openalex.org/W1573980774,"Abstract Bacterial luciferase is inactivated by modification of a single reactive sulfhydryl group on the α subunit by alkylating reagents. The apparent second order rate constants for inactivation by N-alkylmaleimides increase markedly with increasing chain length of the alkyl substituent, from 2 to 8 carbon atoms, suggesting noncovalent binding of the alkyl side chains mediated by hydrophobic interactions with the enzyme. The change in free energy of binding is about -0.5 Cal per mole per additional methylene group. The reactive sulfhydryl group thus must be in or near a hydrophobic region of the enzyme. At high maleimide concentrations, the rate of inactivation approaches a concentration-independent maximum (60 min-1, 0.02 m phosphate, pH 7.0, 25°) which is independent of alkyl chain length. The proposed candidates for the emitting species in the bioluminescence reaction all require highly nonpolar environments to blue-shift their fluorescence maxima to match that of the bioluminescence. These results indicate that such an environment is indeed available in the active center of bacterial luciferase."

The preparation catalyzed extensive cross-linking of the enzymatically synthesized peptidoglycan. In addition in the presence of ATP and ammonia or l-glutamine amidation of the peptidoglycan also occurred. The nature of the amidated products obtained on lysozyme digestion of the enzymatically synthesized peptidoglycan was elucidated by a comparison with similar materials obtained after lysozyme digestion of isolated vegetative cell walls of this organism.

https://openalex.org/W1528871835,"Abstract Cell suspensions of Micrococcus sodonensis (ATCC 11880) secrete 7 to 10 individual proteins including an alkaline phosphatase, a nuclease, and a protease. The appearance of enzyme activities in the extracellular medium is dependent on the co-secretion of at least one of several polysaccharides also elaborated by these cells. This conclusion is based on the following observations: (a) bacitracin, an inhibitor of polysaccharide biosynthesis, proportionately inhibits polysaccharide and protein secretion at concentrations which have no effect on intracellular protein synthesis; (b) a mutant, impaired in its ability to secrete proteins, is also impaired in its ability to secrete a glucosamine-rich polysaccharide; (c) alkaline phosphatase secretion by mutant protoplasts is enhanced in the presence of exogenously supplied polysaccharide; (d) inclusion of 10 mm glucosamine or 2-deoxyglucose (a variety of other monosaccharides were ineffective) in the medium suppresses the secretion of all three enzymes as well as the glucosamine-containing polysaccharide; and (e) restoration of alkaline phosphatase secretion in glucosamine-inhibited protoplasts is achieved by the addition of purified preparations of the glucosamine-containing polysaccharide. The inhibition of enzyme secretion by either glucosamine or 2-deoxyglucose can be completely prevented or reversed by addition of equimolar concentrations of glucose. The addition of albumin or casein to glucosamine-inhibited cells markedly enhances the rate of alkaline phosphatase secretion. These results suggest that during secretion polypeptide chains are vulnerable to proteolytic degradation and that co-secretion of polysaccharide protects the protein from proteolysis."

Animals which have been captured previously may be recognised by some method of marking. If the population is very large relative to the size of the samples, no marked individuals might be recaptured, because the probability of capturing any of the few marked animals is very small.
