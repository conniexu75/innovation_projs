https://openalex.org/W1916777863,"We have cloned a novel apoptotic gene from human Jurkat T-lymphocytes. The new gene encodes a 32-kDa putative cysteine protease (CPP32) with significant homology to Caenorhabditis elegans cell death protein Ced-3, mammalian interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme (ICE), and the product of the mouse nedd2 gene. The CPP32 transcript is highly expressed and most abundant in cell lines of lymphocytic origin. Overexpression of CPP32 or ICE in Sf9 insect cells resulted in apoptosis. In addition, coexpression of recombinant p20 and p11 derived from the parental full-length CPP32 sequence resulted in apoptosis in Sf9 cells. Our data suggest that similar to ICE, CPP32 is made of two subunits, p20 and p11, which form the active CPP32 complex. The apoptotic activity of CPP32 and its high expression in lymphocytes suggest that CPP32 is an important mediator of apoptosis in the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W1517168785,"Antibody binding to glycolipids and glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins of lymphocytes can trigger activation of specific signal transduction pathways. The finding that GPI-anchored proteins are present in detergent-insoluble complexes with several tyrosine kinases of the Src family suggested that these complexes may represent membrane microdomains involved in the transduction of signals to the cell interior. Recent work has suggested a link between detergent-insoluble microdomains and plasma membrane invaginations termed caveolae. Here we show that lymphocytes lack plasma membrane domains with the characteristic features of caveolae. Furthermore, VIP21-caveolin was not detectable in four different lymphocyte cell lines at the protein or mRNA level. In addition to the lack of caveolar domains, capping experiments suggested that the bulk of the GPI-anchored protein Thy1 and the glycosphingolipid GM1 were not stably associated in the lymphocyte plasma membrane. Despite this, Thy1 and GM1 were present in detergent-insoluble complexes. We conclude that detergent insolubility does not correlate with the presence of caveolae or of VIP21-caveolin and that caveolae, as defined by a number of different markers, are not involved in signal transduction in lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1832181040,"The U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle is essential for splicing of precursor mRNA, an activity that depends upon both the RNA and protein components of the U1 particle. One of the U1-specific proteins that is functionally important in this splicing reaction is the 70-kDa protein (U1-70kDa). We report here that U1-70kDa is specifically cleaved in apoptotic cells, resulting in the generation of a 40-kDa fragment. The kinetics of this cleavage coincided with the appearance of cells with apoptotic morphology in the population, and the proportion of 40-kDa fragment observed was markedly increased in apoptotic cells that had become detached from the substratum. Although the inhibitor characteristics of the activity cleaving U1-70kDa suggest that interleukin 1 beta-converting enzyme (ICE) might be responsible, the specific ICE inhibitor N-(N-acetyl-tyrosinyl-valinyl-alaninyl)-3-amino-4-oxob utanoic acid (YVAD-CHO) did not prevent cleavage, and U1-70kDa was not cleaved by purified ICE in vitro. Further study of this novel cleavage and the enzyme responsible will yield information about proteolytic events that might be central in the mechanism and control of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1571251056,"Increasing concentrations (1-100 microM) of the redox cycling quinone, 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (DMNQ), stimulated growth, triggered apoptosis, or caused necrosis of pancreatic RINm5F cells, depending on the dose and duration of the exposure. Following the exposure of RINm5F cells to 10 microM DMNQ, ornithine decarboxylase activity and polyamine biosynthesis increased. This was accompanied by enhanced cell proliferation. Conversely, exposure to 30 microM DMNQ for 3 h resulted in the inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase, intracellular polyamine depletion, and apoptotic cell killing. Pretreatment of the cultures with the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, restored polyamine levels and prevented apoptosis. Exposure to the same DMNQ concentration for only 1 h, with subsequent re-incubation in growth medium, neither caused polyamine depletion nor resulted in apoptosis. Finally, exposure to an even higher DMNQ concentration (100 microM) for either 1 or 3 h caused rapid intracellular Ca2+ overload, ATP, NAD+, and glutathione depletion, and extensive DNA single strand breakage, which resulted in necrotic cell death. Our results show that a disturbance of polyamine biosynthesis occurred prior to cell growth or apoptosis elicited by oxidative stress. In addition, we show that effects as opposite as cell proliferation and deletion, by either apoptosis or necrosis, can be induced, in the same system, by varying the exposure to a prooxidant."
https://openalex.org/W1579721654,"When the neutrophil NADPH oxidase is activated to generate superoxide, the cytosolic components, p47phox, p67phox, and the GTP-binding protein Rac, become stably associated with the plasma membrane. The translocation of p47phox and p67phox is dependent on the presence in the membrane of the flavocytochrome b558, itself composed of two subunits, gp91phox and p22phox. In this study we have quantitated Rac1 and Rac2 in human neutrophils and show that > 96% of the Rac protein is Rac2 and that chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) neutrophils contain normal levels of the protein. We used a cell-free translocation system as well as intact normal and CGD neutrophils to determine whether the translocation of Rac2 is dependent upon the presence of the other oxidase components. When cell-free reactions contained any combination of normal, p47phox-deficient or p67phox-deficient cytosol and normal or flavocytochrome b558-deficient membranes, the GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate)-dependent association of Rac2 with the re-isolated membranes was not significantly different from the control mixture of normal membranes and cytosol. In intact CGD neutrophils lacking p47phox or p67phox and stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate the translocation of Rac2 was also normal, and we conclude that Rac translocation can occur independently of the cytosolic NADPH oxidase components. In contrast, in the absence of flavocytochrome b558 from intact X-chromosome linked CGD neutrophils, Rac2 translocation was reduced to only 25% of the control value. On the basis of these observations we propose that while Rac2 can bind to a site distinct from either gp91phox or p22phox, it depends upon an interaction with the flavocytochrome b558 for maximal stability in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1553821945,"The liver represents one of the few organs in the intact animal that has the capacity to regenerate following injury or partial hepatectomy. One of the earliest responses that has been detected in the remnant liver is the activation of post-hepatectomy factor(s) (PHF), a kappa B site DNA binding activity. We reasoned that understanding the molecular nature of PHF might provide insight into what triggers liver regeneration. We found that PHF is rapidly activated and turned over in the regenerating liver, demonstrating peak activity at 30 min post-hepatectomy and virtual disappearance by 1 h. As determined by supershift, cross-linking, and cross-linking/immunoprecipitation analyses, PHF contains intact p50/p65nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) subunits. To explore the basis for activation of PHF/NF-kappa B in the regenerating liver, we determined the level of individual Rel family subunits in the nuclei of normal and regenerating liver cells. We found evidence for nuclear translocation of p65/RelA, but other Rel family proteins including p50/NF-kappa B1 and p52/NF-kappa B2 are present at a low level in the nuclei of cells at a constitutive level pre- and post-hepatectomy and appear not to form DNA binding homodimers. The level of I kappa B-alpha falls slightly then increases at 3 h post-hepatectomy in concert with the induction of its mRNA. As demonstrated by the induction of I kappa B-alpha mRNA in hepatocytes in situ and identification of PHF/NF-kappa B in cultured hepatocytes, PHF/NF-kappa B is localized primarily in hepatocytes in the regenerating liver. This represents one of the few examples of NF-kappa B activation in the intact animal in a non-hematopoietic cell type. The activation of PHF/NF-kappa B suggests a mechanism by which hepatocytes regulate their mitogenic program during liver regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1577645380,"One important role of the junctional communication in the ovarian follicle is to mediate transmission of cAMP, the regulatory signal that maintains the oocyte in meiotic arrest. Luteinizing hormone (LH) interrupts cell-to-cell communication within the ovarian follicle, leading to a decrease in intraoocyte concentrations of cAMP followed by resumption of meiosis. Our experiments were directed at exploration of mechanisms involved in the LH-induced communication breakdown in the preovulatory ovarian follicle. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis, using highly specific antibodies, showed that connexin-43 (Cx43), the ovarian gap junction protein, is present in the cytoplasmic membranes of the follicular cells in multiple phosphorylated forms. The relative amounts of the different forms of Cx43 vary in response to LH: short time exposure (10 min) stimulated phosphorylation of Cx43 followed by immediate dephosphorylation, while longer incubations (8 and 24 h) with this hormone resulted in elimination of the protein. Forskolin mimicked the LH-induced phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, as well as the decrease of Cx43 protein level. A gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) also induced an immediate phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Cx43 and a later reduction of the amount of Cx43. The direct PKC activator, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), induced phosphorylation of Cx43 that was completely blocked by the protein kinase C inhibitor, staurosporine. This kinase inhibitor partially interfered with LH, but not forskolin-induced phosphorylation of Cx43. Analysis of the effect of LH on Cx43 gene expression revealed a significant decrease (45%) in Cx43 mRNA level at 24 h of incubation. A drop of Cx43 mRNA was also induced by GnRHa. Our results suggest that the LH-induced gating mechanism of the gap junctions in rat ovarian follicles is comprised of two steps: the immediate response is represented by a change in the phosphorylation state of the Cx43 protein, and the later response is manifested by a reduction of Cx43 protein level, due to attenuation of its gene expression. Phosphorylation of Cx43 may occur through PKA-, as well as PKC-dependent pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1584114579,"The tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) gene is an immediate early gene in activated T cells, in that it is rapidly induced without a requirement for protein synthesis. Maximal induction of TNF alpha mRNA can be induced by treatment of T cells with calcium ionophores alone, via a calcineurin-dependent process that is blocked by cyclosporin A. We have previously identified a promoter element, kappa 3, that is required for calcium-stimulated, cyclosporin A-sensitive induction of the TNF alpha gene in activated T cells. Here, we demonstrate that the kappa 3 binding factor contains NFATp, a cyclosporin-sensitive DNA-binding protein required for interleukin-2 gene transcription. NFATp binds to two sites within the kappa 3 element, and occupancy of both sites is required for TNF alpha gene induction. Thus, although the kappa 3 element has little sequence similarity to other NFATp-binding sites, it appears to function as a cyclosporin-sensitive promoter element in T cells by virtue of its ability to bind NFATp. The involvement of NFATp in transcriptional activation of both the interleukin-2 and TNF alpha genes suggests that this factor plays an important role in the coordinate induction of multiple cytokine genes, starting at the earliest stages of T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W1552800926,"Stimulation of guinea pig neutrophils with platelet-activating factor (PAF) caused a rapid and transient activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, partially (approximately 50%) inhibited PAF-induced MAPK activation. Half-maximal inhibition was observed with 200-300 nM wortmannin, while it did not inhibit phorbol ester-induced MAPK activation. Neutrophils preloaded with 1,2-bis-(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA/AM) failed to raise cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations toward PAF, while they still responded to PAF with a 40-50% activation of MAPK. However, when cells were treated with BAPTA/AM and wortmannin in combination, the MAPK activation was completely inhibited. These results suggest that PAF activates MAPK through two distinct pathways in guinea pig neutrophils, one Ca(2+)-dependent, and the other Ca(2+)-independent but wortmannin-sensitive."
https://openalex.org/W1565223221,"The alkA gene of Escherichia coli encodes a DNA glycosylase involved in base excision repair of DNA alkylation damage. In an attempt to define the reactions of the AlkA enzyme with methylated DNA, we discovered that the enzyme released substantial amounts of radioactivity from [methyl-3H]thymidine-labeled DNA even without any exposure of the DNA to methylating agents. The excised material was identified by chromatography as two different oxidized derivatives of thymine, 5-hydroxymethyluracil and 5-formyluracil. These products are formed in such DNA by one and two consecutive decays, respectively, of the tritiums of the labeled methyl group. Kinetic analysis showed that both the apparent Km and Vmax values for 5-formyluracil removal are within the same range as found for 3-methyladenine removal, suggesting that this catalytic property of AlkA is also significant under in vivo conditions. Removal of 5-hydroxymethyluracil proceeds at a rate that is 1-3 orders of magnitude slower. Since both 5-formyluracil and 5-hydroxymethyluracil are major products formed in DNA by exposure to ionizing radiation, these results implicate the alkA gene function also in the repair of oxidative DNA damage. Neither of the two other enzymes involved in the repair of oxidative DNA damage in E. coli, i.e. endonuclease III and formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase, has any affinity for oxidized unsaturated pyrimidines in DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1553416531,"Molecular cloning using a degenerate oligonucleotide-based polymerase chain reaction was undertaken to test the possibility that novel, developmentally regulated protein kinases are expressed in the embryonic mouse kidney. Several receptor tyrosine kinase and serine/threonine kinase cDNA clones were identified. One of these, designated DLK, represented a novel gene product whose 3.6-kilobase transcript was expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated fashion. Several clones encoding the entire open reading frame were isolated and sequenced. The identified open reading frame encodes an 888-amino acid polypeptide that defines a new subfamily within the mixed lineage protein kinase family. Sequence analysis revealed: 1) a kinase catalytic domain most characteristic of serine/threonine kinases but hybrid between members of the family of microtubule-associated protein kinase kinase kinases and the fibroblast growth factor receptor family; 2) two putative alpha-helical leucine zipper motifs separated by a 25-amino acid charged intermediate segment but lacking an NH2-terminal basic domain; and 3) COOH-terminal and NH2-terminal proline-rich domains suggestive of src homology 3 (SH3) domain binding regions. Rabbit polyclonal immune sera generated against a carboxyl-terminal bacterial fusion protein recognized a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 130 kDa in COS 7 cells that were transiently transfected with a full-length DLK cDNA expression vector. Moreover, COS 7 cells transiently transfected with an epitope-tagged DLK expression vector expressed protein with an apparent molecular mass of 130 kDa that became autophosphorylated on serine and threonine in an in vitro kinase assay."
https://openalex.org/W1585326224,"A glycoprotein of M(r) 160,000 (gp160) represents the major protein component of GLUT4-containing vesicles other than GLUT4 itself. These vesicles are the tissue-specific secretory-like microsomal structures that are responsible for insulin-dependent translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface in fat and muscle cells. Our previous studies demonstrated that the expression of gp160 is also limited to fat and muscle tissues, where it is localized exclusively in GLUT4-containing vesicles, and thus, it represents a marker protein for insulin-activated glucose transport. We demonstrate here that gp160 has structural homology to aminopeptidase N and possesses aminopeptidase activity in vitro. Since aminopeptidase activity has also been found in a variety of secretory type vesicles from other tissues, it may be essential for the organization and functioning of secretory machinery in different cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1482239855,"We have examined whether the two cysteine residues (621 and 622) of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the rat luteinizing hormone (LH/hCG) receptor are potential sites for palmitoylation. The full-length LH/hCG receptor cDNA was cloned into an expression vector (hCGR-pCMV4). A human embryonic kidney cell line expressing large T antigen (293T cells) was transiently transfected with hCGR-pCMV4 by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique. The functional expression of the receptor was confirmed by 35S-labeled cysteine incorporation into the receptor as well as by 125I-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) binding. The transfected cells were then labeled with [3H]palmitic acid, and the labeled receptors purified on hCG-Affi-Gel matrix and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The hCGR-pCMV4-transfected cells incorporated [3H]palmitic acid into a 92-kDa band corresponding to the mature form of the LH/hCG receptor; this band was absent in cells transfected with vector alone. Site-directed mutagenesis of either cysteine 621 or 622 to serine residue was partially inhibitory, whereas mutation of both cysteine residues (621 and 622) completely abolished palmitoylation. Scatchard analyses revealed that the mutant and wild type receptors have similar affinities for 125I-hCG. The biological function of palmitoylation was then examined in the transfected cells. The results showed that although the intracellular trafficking of the receptor and the ability to stimulate cyclic AMP production were unaffected, the rate of ligand-induced internalization of the receptor was higher in palmitoylation-deficient mutants compared to the wild type receptors. The first order rate constants of internalization of the mutant receptors were over 2-fold higher than the wild type. Intracellular degradation of the receptor-bound ligand was also higher in the mutants. These studies suggest that the native LH/hCG receptor is palmitoylated at cysteine residues 621 and 622, creating a membrane-anchoring site at the putative cytoplasmic domain. This palmitic acid-mediated anchoring decreases the ligand-induced receptor internalization thereby prolonging the retention of the ligand-bound receptor on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1504187225,"We evaluated the effects of thiol-reducing agents on the heat shock response in human and rodent cells in culture. Using HeLa cells as an example, we demonstrated that dithiothreitol (DTT,2mM) inhibited the heat (42 degrees C) induced increase in the synthesis of heat shock proteins (HSPs), abundance of mRNA of hsp 70, hsp 70 gene promoter activity, and the heat shock factor (HSF) DNA binding activity. This effect of DTT was specific and attributable to its reducing activity; oxidized DTT was ineffective, and other thiol reducing compounds had the same effect as DTT. Time course and dose-response studies showed that DTT significantly inhibited the heat shock induction of heat shock element binding activity with no preincubation and that 0.6 and 1-2 mM DTT gave half-maximal and maximal inhibition, respectively. The effect of DTT was reversible; removal of the DTT-containing medium prior to heat shock rendered the cells fully responsive. Analysis of the effects of DTT on the regulation and function of HSF suggests that DTT blocked an early and important step in the activation process without having a direct effect on the HSF protein. Thus, DTT inhibited the heat-induced trimerization, phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation of HSF and was also effective against a number of other reagents that are known to activate HSF. On the other hand, DTT did not block the response induced by heat shock at 45 degrees C, and in vitro addition of DTT failed to modulate the DNA binding activity of activated HSF present in cell extracts, suggesting that the HSF protein itself is unlikely to be a direct target of action of DTT. These results, together with the observation that activation of HSF DNA binding activity was attenuated under an anoxic condition and that hydrogen peroxide mimicked the effects of heat shock, suggest the involvement of a redox mechanism as an early and important step in the heat shock signal transduction pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1533239574,"Oncoprotein 18 (Op18) is a cytosolic protein that is expressed in all proliferating cells. This phosphoprotein is up-regulated in a variety of human neoplasm, and phosphorylation of its two kinase target sites, Ser-25 and Ser-38, fluctuates dramatically during the cell cycle. We have investigated the potential role of the kinase-mediated phosphorylation of these two sites by expressing a Cdc2 kinase target site-deficient mutant of Op18 (Op18-S25,38A), and analyzed the phenotype on the level of cell cycle regulation. The result shows that induced expression of Op18-S25,38A results in rapid accumulation of cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. The block in G2 seems transient, since prolonged incubation was found to result in a large fraction of the transfected cells entering S phase in the absence of mitosis, i.e. endoreduplication. In addition, a fraction (30%) of the transfected cells was blocked in mitosis. Whereas the morphology of the G2 arrested cells appeared normal, expression of Op18-S25,38A caused a serious defect during mitotic chromosome segregation. Analyses of the mechanism behind the phenotype of Op18-S25,38A suggest an essential role for Op18 during cell division and that the mutant interferes with the function of the endogenous gene product."
https://openalex.org/W1489521232,"An intriguing property of the polypeptide constituents of amyloid is that they apparently can escape the proteolytic mechanisms that normally catalyze turnover and prevent abnormal tissue accumulation of polypeptides. Here, we demonstrate that the A beta peptide, the principal component of cerebrovascular amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease, becomes resistant to an array of proteases as a result of structural changes associated with its polymerization into amyloid fibrils. It is further demonstrated that fibril formation per se does not lead to protease resistance but probably structural changes associated with polymerization. The results suggest that higher order structural changes, regulated by the primary structure, enable amyloidogenic polypeptides to escape proteolytic degradation and accumulate in tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1562899443,"The expression of a single glycosyltransferase, GD3 synthase, caused cholinergic differentiation with neurite sprouting. The cells that expressed GD3 were established from Neuro2a cells by transfection of a mammalian expression vector into which were carried a cDNA encoding GD3 synthase and the blasticidin-S-deaminase gene with a SV40 promoter, followed by selection with blasticidin-S-hydrochloride. The blasticidin-S-hydrochloride-resistant colonies derived from the cells transfected with the cDNA encoding GD3 synthase and the clonal cells (N2a-GD3) were spontaneously sprouting neurites but not those derived from cells transfected with only the vector without the cDNA encoding GD3 synthase (N2a-bsr). GD3 expression by N2a-GD3 was confirmed by immunostaining of the cells using the anti-GD3 monoclonal antibody, KM643. N2a-GD3 expressed not only GD3 but also GQ1b, one of the b-series gangliosides, whereas N2a-bsr did not express these gangliosides. Cell proliferation of N2a-GD3 was greatly reduced, as compared with that of N2a-bsr, and, after several passages, it completely stopped. In addition, N2a-GD3 expressed acetylcholine esterase, indicating that the differentiation of Neuro2a cells was induced by expression of GD3 synthase and subsequent modification of the biosynthesis and expression of gangliosides. These results strongly suggest that the de novo synthesis and expression of GD3 and/or b-series gangliosides induce neurite outgrowth and differentiation of Neuro2a cells. Exogenous GM1 stimulated the neuritogenesis of N2a-bsr but not differentiated N2a-GD3, indicating that the mechanism of neurite sprouting in this system may be overlapped en route with that of exogenous GM1."
https://openalex.org/W1513296940,"Glucocorticoids stimulate, while insulin inhibits, the hepatic transcription of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1). In the present studies, human HEP G2 hepatoma cells were transiently transfected with human (h)IGFBP-1 promoter constructs. Activity of a construct containing the first 1205 base pairs (bp) of the hIGFBP-1 promoter was stimulated 6-9.5-fold by dexamethasone, and this increase was inhibited approximately 76% by insulin. Deletion and site-directed mutations of the hIGFBP-1 promoter (a) identified two glucocorticoid response elements, located within the first 200 bp of the promoter, which are essential for dexamethasone-stimulated promoter activity and which specifically bind human glucocorticoid receptor; (b) showed that a recently characterized insulin-responsive element, located approximately 110 bp 5' to the transcription start site (Suwanichkul, A., Morris, S.L., and Powell, D. R. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 17063-17068), confers the entire inhibitory effect of insulin not only on basal but also on glucocorticoid-stimulated promoter activity; and (c) showed that this insulin-responsive element is essential for maximal glucocorticoid-stimulated activity. These studies suggest that the interaction of proteins that bind to a cluster of cis elements located in the first 200 bp of the hIGFBP-1 promoter are of major importance in modulating the opposing effects of glucocorticoids and insulin on hepatic hIGFBP-1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W1560207700,"The nuclear factor kappa B, NF-kappa B, is activated by numerous inflammatory mediators, regulating biological responses that in part are dependent on the extracellular matrix. Analyses of the influence of cell-matrix interaction on NF-kappa B activation revealed that attachment to fibronectin caused an increase in NF-kappa B activity corresponding to 3-fold the level in cells plated on bare plastic. This effect was dependent on the degree of attachment and appeared to involve both the RGD motif of the cell-binding domain, and the heparin-binding domain of fibronectin. Fibronectin attachment specifically caused activation of the p50/p65 heterodimeric form of NF-kappa B, resulting in an increase of this complex to a level similar to that induced by cytokine stimulation. These data show that cell attachment has a pronounced influence on the level of NF-kappa B activity, affecting specific dimeric complexes, and suggest this to be a pathway through which effects depending on cell-matrix interaction can regulate cell behavior and cytokine responses."
https://openalex.org/W1556627846,"The induction of beta-interferon is markedly enhanced in some cell types by a pretreatment with type I interferon itself (priming). We show that induction in response to double-stranded RNA is completely dependent upon priming in HeLa cells. However, unprimed cells can be partially induced by Sendai virus. This indicates that Sendai virus can provide a signal that is different from, or additional to, that provided by double-stranded RNA. The requirement for priming cannot be localized to a specific sequence element in the beta-interferon promoter, suggesting that priming may induce an essential component for signal transduction in response to double-stranded RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1517043082,"Dynamin is a GTP-binding protein thought to be involved in the early stages of endocytosis. Presently, it is not known how dynamin GTP binding and hydrolysis are related to its role in this process. We previously characterized the ability of acidic phospholipid vesicles and microtubules to strongly stimulate the GTPase activity of purified brain dynamin. In a further analysis of dynamin enzymatic properties, we have found that the increase of dynamin GTP hydrolysis in the presence of activating agent depends on enzyme concentration. At low enzyme concentration, little or no activation is observed. Plots of dynamin GTPase activity with increasing enzyme concentration in the presence of either activating agent are strongly sigmoidal, indicating that positive cooperativity is responsible for the increased activity observed. A Hill coefficient of 2.3 was determined, implying that at least two dynamin molecules associate for maximal GTPase activity. No cooperative effects in GTP binding were observed. Linear transformation of reaction velocity versus enzyme concentration data indicate an apparent Km for dynamin-dynamin interactions of 37 nM, which is significantly lower than the physiological concentration of dynamin in brain. These results suggest that cooperative interactions between dynamin molecules are responsible for the apparent activation of GTPase observed and are likely involved in dynamin function in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1561212018,"The movement of a ribosome along the mRNA was assessed by the following experimental strategy. mRNAs were synthesized which contained a short coding sequence with at least four codons and a 32P label at one end and an oligo(C) sequence at the other end. When these mRNAs were fixed on the ribosome with tRNAs specific for the defined codons, the oligo(C) stretches were partially outside of the ribosome, whereas the labeled ends were inside the ribosome and thus protected. The overhanging oligo(C) regions were trimmed with the cytidyl-specific RNase CL3 identifying the nucleotides of the mRNAs, which emerged from the ribosome. An mRNA enters the ribosome at nucleotide 18 +/- 1, when counting starts at the first nucleotide of the P-site codon, and leaves the ribosome at nucleotide -21 +/- 2. The ribosome does not move at either side upon A-site occupation but does so at both sides simultaneously upon translocation. The results further indicate that most of the mRNA stretches downstream and upstream of the coding region are not required for the translocation reaction. It is therefore likely that the tRNAs are pulling the mRNA through the ribosome via codon-anticodon interactions in the course of translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1563700418,"Adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) stimulates phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene transcription, whereas insulin has the opposite effect. In H4IIE cells, the effect of insulin is dominant since it represses cAMP-stimulated transcription. Discrete cis-acting elements in the PEPCK promoter that serve as an insulin response sequence (IRS) and cAMP response element (CRE) have been identified. Here we show that common proteins can bind both elements, since: (i) an almost identical pattern of protein binding is seen when oligonucleotides representing either the IRS or the CRE are used as the labeled probe in a gel retardation assay and (ii) the unlabeled wild-type, but not mutated, CRE oligonucleotide competes for protein binding to the labeled IRS probe, and vice versa. Six homo- and heterodimer complexes interact with these DNA elements; the complexes are composed of three individual protein species: (a) 42-kDa C/EBP alpha, (b) 30-kDa C/EBP alpha, and (c) an unidentified 20-kDa factor termed p20- CRE/IRS Binding Protein (p20-C/IBP). These proteins have a 30-fold greater affinity for the CRE at room temperature, a difference explained by the rapid dissociation rate of protein bound to the IRS, since the association rate of protein binding to both the IRS and CRE is the same. Protease digestion experiments suggest that the proteins bind to the CRE and IRS in different conformations. The IRS and CRE both function in the context of a heterologous promoter to mediate effects of insulin and cAMP, respectively, but, although the PEPCK IRS and CRE bind common proteins, the PEPCK CRE is not a functional IRS and the PEPCK IRS is not a functional CRE."
https://openalex.org/W1599979091,"mik1+ and wee1+ function to regulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of p34cdc2 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Lundgren, K., Walworth, N., Booher, R., Dembski, M., Kirschner, M., and Beach, D. (1991) Cell 64, 1111-1122). wee1+ encodes a tyrosine kinase that directly phosphorylates p34cdc2 on tyrosine 15, resulting in the inactivation of the cyclin B/p34cdc2 complex. We have overproduced the mik1+ gene product in insect cells and in S. pombe in order to characterize it biochemically. Immunoprecipitates of Mik1 from both sources catalyzed the phosphorylation of p34cdc2 on tyrosine 15 whereas immunoprecipitates of a kinase-deficient mutant of Mik1 were negative in this assay. Mik1 overproduced in insect cells was partially purified by column chromatography, and column fractions were assayed for their ability to phosphorylate p34cdc2 on tyrosine 15. Two major peaks of Mik1 protein were detected by gel filtration chromatography. One peak eluted in the void volume, and a second peak eluted with an apparent molecular mass expected for monomeric Mik1 (approximately 68 kDa). The tyrosine 15 kinase activity co-eluted with the 68 kDa form of Mik1. These results indicate that mik1+ encodes a tyrosine kinase that directly phosphorylates p34cdc2 on tyrosine 15."
https://openalex.org/W1555697162,"We have isolated and characterized the 5'-flanking region of the gene for human ferrochelatase (HFC), the last enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway. The proximal promoter of the gene is contained within a region that structurally resembles a CpG island and is devoid of general cis elements such as TATA and CAAT boxes. Recognition sites for the ubiquitous Sp1 family of transcription factors, as well as for the erythroid-specific trans-acting factors NF-E2 and GATA-1 were found, and binding of regulatory proteins to these elements was analyzed by in vitro DNase I protection assays. The contribution of the various cis elements to both ubiquitous and erythroid preferential expression of the HFC gene was assessed by using transient transfection assays. These showed that a minimal Sp1-driven promoter devoid of the upstream erythroid-specific elements was sufficient for erythroid preferential expression of the HFC gene. However, elimination of a repressor sequence lying between the minimal promoter and the erythroid-specific elements resulted in high levels of expression in human erythroleukemic K562 cells only when the cis elements recognized by GATA-1 and NF-E2 were present, suggesting that the activity of these factors is regulated by a downstream repressor in erythroid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1546503260,"cDNA for the C-terminal Ca(2+)-binding domain of rat calpain small subunit was cloned by means of the polymerase chain reaction. The encoded protein (21 kDa), which corresponds closely to the natural autolysis product of the small subunit, was produced in soluble form in Escherichia coli at a level of 20 mg/liter of cell culture. Rat calpain II large subunit (80 kDa) was produced from a cDNA clone in E. coli in soluble form at a level of approximately 1 mg/liter. The 80-kDa subunit alone had no proteinase activity, with or without Ca2+, but Ca(2+)-dependent proteinase activity was obtained following association of the two subunits, which was achieved either by co-expression of the two subunit cDNAs in E. coli, or by mixing the two partially purified subunits in the presence of 1 M NaSCN followed by dialysis. The heterodimeric (80 + 21 kDa) proteinase had a Ca2+ requirement for 50% activity of 0.35 mM and a specific activity at 2 mM Ca2+ of approximately 1 unit/microgram, values essentially identical to those of natural (80 + 30 kDa) calpain II. The results establish association and biological activity of the bacterially produced subunits and provide a system for studying structure-function relationships in calpain by means of mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1606477282,"Despite the importance of smooth muscle cell proliferation in vascular pathophysiological states, the mechanisms regulating smooth muscle cell growth and differentiation are poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that adult rabbit smooth muscles express two types of myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms, SM1 and SM2, which are generated through alternative RNA splicing from a single smooth muscle MHC (SMHC) gene. In the present study, we isolated and characterized the rabbit SMHC gene promoter. DNA sequence analysis of the upstream region of the SMHC gene revealed several putative cis-DNA regulatory elements proximal to the transcription start site. Most notably, cis-acting regulatory elements that closely resemble CC(A/T)6GG (CArG box) and myocyte enhancer binding factor 2 (MEF-2)-type sequence motifs were found in the SMHC 5‘-flanking region. In addition, six E-box motifs were found in the 5‘-flanking region of the SMHC gene between -374 and -2109 base pairs from the transcription start site. A series of transient transfection assays using SMHC promoter deletion constructs indicated that a promoter fragment extending to 2266 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site has the highest reporter activity in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells. Gel mobility shift analyses using the MEF-2-like sequence located at -1540 revealed a specific DNA protein complex, whereas the CArG-like element located at -1275 did not show protein binding. The SMHC promoter construct, p509-CAT, which included neither the CArG- nor MEF-2-type motifs, conferred 32% of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in the same cells, whereas the construct p188-CAT, which contained the minimal promoter elements (TATA box), was significantly less active (7% 2.0-fold over background). This is the first report describing the promoter elements of a gene whose expression is restricted to smooth muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1558783117,"We studied the structure of the lipooligosaccharide (LOS) that is produced by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, strain 15253. This strain, recovered from a patient with disseminated infection, produces predominantly a single LOS component, and its oligosaccharide (OS) structure is different from those of previously studied LOSs. Definition of this OS structure provides additional information on the LOS biosynthesis. We determined that the 15253 OS has an unusual structure: 2 lactosyl residues at its nonreducing ends shown below, [formula: see text] where KDO is 2-keto-3-deoxy-mannooctulosonic acid and Hep is heptose. Comparison of this OS structure with those determined previously indicates the presence of a new glycosylation pathway for gonococcal OS biosynthesis: elongation of a GlcNAc-linked heptose, in contrast to elongation of the other heptose by sequential addition of glycoses which results in the antigenic similarity with human glycolipids. The current study provides not only additional structural information on LOS expressed during different clinical states of infection but also evidence for the diversity of gonococcal LOS biosynthesis. This evidence may be helpful in understanding the pathogenesis involving gonococcal LOS."
https://openalex.org/W1632626877,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) transduces signals through binding to type I (T beta R-I) and type II (T beta R-II) serine/threonine kinase receptors. T beta R-I requires T beta R-II for ligand binding, whereas T beta R-II requires T beta R-I for signaling. We generated two different chimeric TGF-beta receptors, i.e. T beta R-1.2 containing the extracellular domain of T beta R-I and the intracellular domain of T beta R-II, and T beta R-2.1 containing the extracellular domain of T beta R-II and the intracellular domain of T beta R-I. T beta R-2.1 bound 125I-TGF-beta 1 alone, whereas T beta R-1.2 bound the ligand only in the presence of T beta R-II or T beta R-2.1. When transfected into a mutant mink lung epithelial cell line that lacks functional T beta R-II, T beta R-II cDNA, but not T beta R-2.1 cDNA, restored the responsiveness to TGF-beta 1 with regard to transcriptional activation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 gene promoter and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive elements. In a mutant mink lung epithelial cell line lacking T beta R-I, T beta R-I cDNA stimulated promoter activity, but the T beta R-1.2 cDNA did not. T beta R-2.1 formed an oligomer with T beta R-II when transfected into COS cells, but the complex did not transduce the signal after ligand stimulation. On the other hand, co-transfection of T beta R-1.2 and T beta R-2.1 cDNAs restored the responsiveness to TGF-beta 1. These results indicate that an interaction between the intracellular regions of T beta R-I and T beta R-II, triggered by ligand binding to the extracellular domains of these receptors, leads to efficient signal transduction by TGF-beta."
https://openalex.org/W1551938923,"The low affinity neurotrophin receptor, termed p75LNTR, plays a role in increasing the amount of nerve growth factor that becomes bound to the tyrosine kinase receptor, trkA (Barker, P. A., and Shooter, E. M. (1994) Neuron 13: 203-215), possibly by increasing the nerve growth factor concentration in the microenvironment surrounding the trkA receptor. Because protein acylation may be a means by which cell surface receptor distribution may be regulated, we have determined the acylation status of p75LNTR. We find that p75LNTR expressed in PC12, PCNA, or transfected COS cells is metabolically labeled with [3H]palmitic acid. This modification occurs post-translationally, and the incorporated fatty acid is removed by hydroxylamine treatment at pH 7 or 11 and by sulfhydryl reducing agents, suggesting a thioester linkage to palmitic acid. Consistent with this, p75LNTR in which the juxtamembrane cysteine present at position 279 is substituted with alanine is expressed but cannot be metabolically labeled with [3H]palmitic acid. Substitution of other cysteine residues present in the transmembrane or intracellular domain of the receptor has no effect on protein acylation, suggesting that only Cys279 is esterified to palmitate."
https://openalex.org/W1511498323,"The gamma-subunits of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G-proteins) are isoprenylated and alpha-carboxyl methylated at their COOH-terminal cysteine residues. These modifications are necessary for membrane attachment of the beta gamma complex, but a requirement of an additional factor has been proposed for the stable binding. We explored a possible contribution of the blocked amino terminus of beta-subunits of bovine photoreceptor G-protein, transducin (T alpha/T beta gamma = Gt alpha/beta 1 gamma 1), and of three beta gamma complexes (beta 1 gamma 2, beta 1 gamma 3, and beta 1 gamma 7) purified from bovine brains. Structural analyses revealed that every beta 1-subunit has an N-acetylated serine, which is unlikely to contribute to the membrane association. Since neither protease nor heat treatment of photoreceptor membranes affected the membrane binding of T beta gamma, it seems unlikely that rhodopsin (or other membrane proteins) serves as an anchor protein for accepting T beta gamma. In fact, T beta gamma bound to phospholipid large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), of which the polar head groups strongly influenced the binding: T beta gamma alone showed 2-fold higher binding for negatively charged phosphatidylserine-LUVs than for neutral phosphatidylcholine (PC)-LUVs, while the affinity of T alpha/T beta gamma complex for the phosphatidylserine-LUVs was lower than that for the PC-LUVs. These results indicate that 1) an ionic interaction between T beta gamma and membrane surface plays an important role in the stable membrane association, and 2) the domain(s) of T beta gamma responsible for the association would be different between trimeric and dissociated states. We also found that synthetic peptides corresponding to the COOH-terminal region of T gamma inhibited T alpha-T beta gamma interaction only when the peptides were isoprenylated. This suggests that the isoprenyl moiety is located at the contact site between the subunits, not at the membrane-binding domain, when T beta gamma is complexed with T alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1565685840,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) interacts with the TrkB receptor tyrosine kinase, the tyrosine kinase domain of which has homology with the insulin receptor subfamily of protein kinases. This includes the conservation of three regulatory tyrosines (residues 670, 674, and 675) known to play a crucial role in signal transmission by the insulin receptor (tyrosines 1158, 1162, and 1163). Wild-type TrkB and TrkB mutants with Y670F, Y674F/Y675F, Y751F (the tyrosine reported to be important in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase binding (Obermeier, A., Lammers, R., Wiesmuller, K. H., June, G., Schlessinger, J., and Ullrich, A. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 22963-22966)), and K540R (consensus ATP binding lysine) substitutions were transiently expressed in COS cells for analysis of phosphorylation sites by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. TrkB phosphorylation sites were also studied in MG86 cells stably expressing wild-type TrkB. In addition, the mutants were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells for analysis of the ability of the receptor to mediate BDNF-stimulated transcription from a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element (TRE). BDNF stimulated the phosphorylation of wild-type TrkB on multiple tyrosine and serine residues. This phosphorylation occurred on tyrosines 670, 674, and 675 plus two other tyrosines and at least two serines that were not unequivocally identified. Wild-type TrkB mediated a pronounced stimulation of TRE-dependent transcription. A Y674F/Y675F, but not Y670F, substitution dramatically inhibited this response. Surprisingly, in COS cells, a Y751F substitution induced dramatically lower tyrosine and serine phosphorylation at all sites but mediated a normal BDNF-stimulated activation of a TRE. Our results demonstrate a critical role for the phosphorylation of tyrosines 674 and 675 in BDNF-dependent signaling by wild-type TrkB."
https://openalex.org/W1482260124,"Abstract Alternative splicing of insulin receptor pre-mRNA has been shown to be regulated in a tissue-specific and developmental manner. We investigated whether the receptor ligand might regulate the relative distribution of alternatively spliced mRNA in insulin-sensitive cells and found that changes in the relative expression of the two alternatively spliced insulin receptor RNA isotypes expressed in hepatocytes are regulated by insulin. In addition, we observed significant differences (p < or = 0.001) in insulin receptor isotype expression in subjects who were hyperinsulinemic and insulin-resistant versus subjects who were insulin-sensitive. These results support a role for insulin in the regulation of the relative expression of alternatively spliced mRNA expressed in insulin-responsive cells and tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1608936317,"A critical event in a signal transduction pathway downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases is the physical association of GTP-liganded Ras with the serine/threonine kinase, Raf-1. The binding of Raf-1 to Ras results in translocation of the kinase to the plasma membrane and facilitates its activation by an unknown mechanism. A deletion mutagenesis approach was employed to elucidate critical sequences in Raf-1 necessary for binding to Ras and to resolve seemingly contradictory data in the literature. While an N-terminal fragment consisting of residues 2-130 of Raf-1 was able to bind Ras, residues 131-147 were found to be critically important for conferring high affinity binding to Ras. Surprisingly, a second domain between residues 52-64 was an essential element for Raf-Ras interaction, although it did not appear to form an independent binding site for Ras. These findings may prove useful for the design of peptides or peptidomimetic drugs for the modulation of Raf-Ras interaction in neoplastic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1493623384,"Urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA) receptor (u-PAR) is a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein that promotes pericellular proteolysis and cellular migration. This investigation demonstrates that u-PAR is a substrate for the proteolytically active form of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SPE B), a potent virulence factor secreted by Streptococcus pyogenes. Treatment of U937 monocyte-like cells with SPE B decreased specific 125I-labeled single-chain u-PA binding by up to 85%. Cysteine proteinase inhibitors neutralized SPE B without affecting the activity of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Due to decreased u-PA binding, SPE B-treated U937 cells expressed decreased activity against a u-PA-specific fluorogenic substrate and plasminogen. SPE B released single-chain u-PA that was noncovalently bound to U937 cells or cross-linked to cellular receptors with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate. The mass of the released u-PA-receptor complex was 100 kDa. Western blot analysis confirmed that the u-PA receptor that was cleaved by SPE B is u-PAR. After deglycosylation, the mass of SPE B-released u-PAR was 35 kDa, slightly smaller than the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-derived form of this receptor. SPE B-released u-PAR retained the ability to bind u-PA, as determined by u-PA affinity chromatography. We conclude that SPE B may inhibit u-PA binding to monocytic cells by at least two mechanisms: (i) by decreasing the level of functional cell surface u-PAR and (ii) by releasing a soluble form of u-PAR that competes with the cellular receptor for ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1570263442,"Lysyl hydroxylase (LH), an enzyme required early during collagen biosynthesis, appears to be exceptional among proteins that are thought to be residents of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is a homodimer and does not contain either of the two previously characterized ER-specific retention motifs (KDEL or the double lysine motif) in its primary structure. We now show that LH, nevertheless, resides in the lumen of the ER. In immunofluorescence experiments, LH co-localizes with a KDEL-containing protein, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), and also co-sediments with it after fractionation of subcellular organelles by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. In addition, LH seems to be stress-inducible. In one respect, however, LH differs from PDI and other known luminal proteins in the organelle. It is found in situ only in association with the ER membranes. Our cell fractionation and Triton X-114 phase separation experiments suggest that it binds to the membranes via weak electrostatic interactions. LH can thus be regarded as a first luminally-oriented peripheral membrane protein which has been characterized in the ER. The results suggest a novel possibility by which ER lumen can acquire its specific protein components from the bulk flow."
https://openalex.org/W1573533160,"We have created a series of deletion mutants of a human cardiac cAMP phosphodiesterase in order to define sequences necessary for function and to identify residues required for inhibition by cGMP and by the drugs milrinone and trequinsin. These truncated constructs were expressed in yeast cells, and their biochemical properties were analyzed. The mutations define an amino acid sequence that is essential for function. Among the active constructs, there was considerable variability in the level of expression and in the stability of the proteins, with the full-length and near full-length constructs being the least stable. There were, however, no significant changes in Km values among the active enzymes. Cation studies confirmed that Mn2+ is a more efficient cofactor than Mg2+ or Co2+. Interestingly, Mn2+ acts as a more efficient cofactor for cGMP inhibition as well. Although IC50 values for the drugs trequinsin and milrinone were not significantly altered by deletions, there was a decrease in cGMP IC50 values for the smaller constructs, indicating a role for amino acid residues outside the catalytic region in cGMP inhibition. We also demonstrate in vivo inhibition of this enzyme in yeast cells grown in the presence of pharmacological inhibitors, allowing for the selection of drug-resistant mutants. Finally, we have constructed and analyzed chimeric genes in which portions of this phosphodiesterase are replaced with homologous sequences from a closely related phosphodiesterase isozyme that is expressed in brain. Our results demonstrate that sequence variations between related isozymes account for more than just pharmacological distinctions and may reflect significant structural differences."
https://openalex.org/W1559146329,"Ferritins are 24-mer proteins which store and detoxify intracellular iron. Mammalian ferritins are made of two subunit types, the H- and L-chains, with different functional specificity. The H-chain has a metal-binding site (the ferroxidase center) which confers ferroxidase activity to the protein and accelerates iron incorporation. In the L-chain the center is substituted by a salt bridge. We performed several site-directed mutageneses in the L-chain with the aim to construct the center and confer ferroxidase activity to the protein. Most variants were insoluble and did not refold into homopolymers, probably due to electrostatic repulsion introduced by the substitutions. However, they formed hybrids when they were renatured together with the L- or H-chains. The heteropolymers made of 90% L-chain and 10% of an L-variant with all the ligand residues of the H-chain center had 25-30% of the ferroxidase activity of the H-chain homopolymer. This corresponds to the activity of an H/L heteropolymer with 7% H-chain. It is concluded that: (i) it is possible to construct a ferroxidase center in the L-chain with an activity equivalent to that of the H-chain, (ii) the residues of the center interfere with the folding/assembly of the L-, but not of the H-chain, (iii) heteropolymers can be made even between ferritin subunits with large differences of refolding rates."
https://openalex.org/W1523426760,"Abstract The macrophage-like cell line, J774, was found to respond to immobilized mouse monoclonal IgG2a proteins, but not to soluble forms of IgG2a or IgG2b or to immobilized F(ab')2 of IgG2a, by the increase in the nuclear proteins of two different types of NF-kappa B proteins which differed in their electrophoretic mobilities. Fc gamma 2a receptor-mediated activation of NF-kappa B was blocked by the presence of pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate, neutralizing anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antibodies, various protein kinase inhibitors (H-89, genistein, or heparin) or intracellular calcium chelator (1,2-bis(O-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetra-(acetoxymethyl)-ester, BAPTA/AM) during stimulation. J774 cells were also found to respond to immobilized IgG2a, but not IgG2b, by the increased production of superoxide, H2O2, and TNF-alpha. Fc gamma 2aR-induced production of H2O2 was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate, H-89, genistein, heparin, or BAPTA/AM, but not with anti-TNF-alpha antibody. Fc gamma 2aR-induced production of TNF-alpha was, on the other hand, not inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with BAPTA/AM. Although J774 cells responded to exogenously added rTNF-alpha, but not to H2O2, by activation of NF-kappa B, the recombinant TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kappa B activation was enhanced by simultaneous presence of H2O2. These results thus suggest that macrophages respond to the stimulation of Fc gamma 2aR by the production of both reactive oxygen intermediates and TNF-alpha and that endogenous TNF-alpha activates NF-kappa B via the pathway involving reactive oxygen intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W1495721989,"Laminin, a large multidomain glycoprotein specific to basement membranes, is a heterotrimer with alpha, beta, and gamma chains held together in an alpha-helical coiled-coil structure. Synthetic peptides comprising two 51-mers (B1 and B2) from the beta 1 and gamma 1 subunits and a 55-mer (M) from alpha 2 were used to study the molecular mechanisms in laminin chain assembly. Using the synthetic peptides in various mixing experiments, the heterotrimer (B1-B2-M) was preferentially produced. The thermal stability of the heterotrimer increased dramatically (by approximately 20 degrees C) over that of the B1-B2 heterodimer as measured by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The B1-B1 homodimer (Tm = 60 degrees C) showed higher thermal stability when compared to B1-B2 and B2-B2 dimers. However, the B1 + B2 mixture produced principally the B1-B2 heterodimer. These results suggested that the preferential formations of heterodimer was regulated by kinetic interactions between each chain. The B2 and M peptides have many hydrophobic isoleucine residues which were replaced by leucines. These substitutions were predicted to favor an alpha-helical conformation and a higher propensity for zipper formation. B2L and ML, in which all isoleucine residues were replaced by leucine, showed significantly increased alpha-helicities. While B2L was able to form heterodimers and heterotrimers similar to B2, ML was not able to participate in heterotrimer formation as efficiently as the M peptide. The thermal stability of B1-B2L was comparable to that of B1-B2, but B2L and/or ML containing trimers showed lower thermal stability than B1-B2-M. These results suggest that the isoleucine residues in the alpha 2 and gamma 1 chains are critical for stabilizing the heteromeric triple-stranded coiled-coil structure."
https://openalex.org/W1590524478,"It has been shown previously that growth and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) translocation defects occur in response to depletion of the 54-kDa subunit of signal recognition particle (SRP54) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Hann, B. B., and Walter, P. (1991) Cell 67, 131-144). We report here that cells depleted of SRP54p undergo a general stress response, the onset of which is observed almost two-cell doublings after SRP54 protein levels fall below the limits of detection. The stress response to SRP54p depletion occurs in two distinct phases, unlike the response to other stressors such as heat shock. In the initial phase, the cytoplasmic Hsp70 levels are drastically increased coincident with an abrupt slowing of growth and accumulation of untranslocated species of the ER-resident chaperone BiP. During this first response, levels of the yeast DnaJ homolog Ydj1p are also increased. In the second phase, which is detected 5 h later, levels of the cytoplasmic heat shock proteins Hsp82 and Hsp104 are increased. BiP is also induced during this second phase, while the ER levels of the resident foldase protein disulfide isomerase are significantly reduced. Since only those cytoplasmic stress proteins which have been shown to participate in membrane translocation are induced in the first phase, these findings indicate the presence of a stress response specific to accumulation of secretory protein precursors in the cytoplasm."

(1993) J. Bacteriol. 175, 3876-3886). The heterologous expression of the tcmG gene in Streptomyces lividans and the purification and characterization of TcmG protein, which we have named Tcm A2 oxygenase, are described here. NH2-terminal amino acid analysis of the purified enzyme led to the revision of the translational start site of tcmG to a TTG, 33 base pairs downstream of the GTG site assigned initially on the basis of nucleotide sequence analysis. Tcm A2 oxygenase is a monomeric protein in solution and contains 1 mol of non-covalently bound FAD; the apoenzyme can be partially reconstituted in vitro by addition of FAD. Tcm A2 oxygenase exhibits an optimal pH of 9.0-9.5 and prefers NADPH over NADH as an electron donor. The apparent K'm of the enzyme for Tcm A2, NADH, and NADPH are 1.81 +/- 0.38, 260 +/- 19, and 82.1 +/- 17 microM, respectively, and the apparent V'max for the reaction is 14.7 +/- 1.1 nmol Tcm C/min.mg. Purification and characterization of Tcm A2 oxygenase provide direct evidence to support the notion that the angular hydroxy groups of naphthacenequinones like Tcm C are introduced from 18O2 via a mono- or dioxygenase process."
https://openalex.org/W7769473,"ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP) catalyzes a key regulatory step in starch synthesis. To elucidate the molecular basis for the expression of the potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) AGP during tuber development, the structure of the small subunit AGP (sAGP) gene and its patterns of expression were examined. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the sAGP gene is over 5.5 kilobases long and has a complex structure including eight introns. Unlike the situation in other plants where tissue-specific sAGP are found, our Southern and Northern blot analysis indicated that the same sAGP gene is expressed both in tubers (non-photosynthetic tissue) and leaves (photosynthetic tissue). These data were supported by comparing sequences of isolated sAGP leaf cDNAs to the tuber cDNA sequence, by primer extension analysis of leaf and tuber poly(A)+ RNAs, and by the spatial expression patterns of a gusA (beta-glucuronidase) reporter gene driven by the potato sAGP promoter in transgenic potato plants. Although the sAGP gene appeared to be transcriptionally controlled in both developing tubers and in leaves, the relative level of leaf antigen was significantly lower than its level of transcript, indicating that sAGP expression in leaves is primarily regulated post-transcriptionally. The observed tissue type-dependent regulation of sAGP expression appears to control the extent of starch biosynthesis by regulating the levels of this enzyme and, thus, alleviate the need for tissue-specific forms of the sAGP in potato."
https://openalex.org/W1530866319,"In familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 (FDB), glutamine is substituted for arginine at position 3500 of the amino acid sequence. This mutation alters the structure of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and reduces their binding to LDL receptors. We studied the assembly in vitro of FDB-LDL with two recombinant apo(a) (r-apo(a)) isoforms containing 17 or 18 kringle IV-type repeats, respectively. R-apo(a) complexed to LDL in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. When we mixed normal LDL at protein concentrations from 1 to 10 mg/liter with 200 micrograms/liter r-apo(a) and incubated for 20 h, 15-44% of r-apo(a) were bound to LDL, forming an artificial Lp(a)-like particle. With LDL from a homozygous FDB patient, only 2-16% of r-apo(a) were complexed; heterozygous FDB-LDL bound 2-30% of r-apo(a). We also studied the effect of r-apo(a) on the interaction of the monoclonal antibody MB47 with normal and mutant apoB-100. FDB-LDL displayed enhanced binding of MB47. Adducts generated from normal LDL and r-apo(a) had an increased affinity for MB47, when compared to LDL alone. In contrast, r-apo(a) did not change MB47 reactivity when incubated with FDB-LDL. Altogether, our findings suggest that domains in apolipoprotein B which are important for the interaction with the LDL receptor play a role in the assembly of Lp(a) as well. They provide, in addition, an explanation for the observation that in Lp(a) of heterozygous FDB patients, the ratio of defective to normal apoB-100 is significantly smaller than in LDL from the same patients."

We confirmed that G beta e interacts with a GTP-binding protein by demonstrating that immunoprecipitation of G beta e is sensitive to GTP gamma S. These results suggest that G beta e functions as the beta subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein that couples photoactivation of rhodopsin to downstream components in the Drosophila phototransduction cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1613577755,"Abstract Growth of chick atrial cells in medium supplemented with lipoprotein-depleted serum has been shown to result in an increase in total cell cholesterol, and an increase in the negative chronotropic response to muscarinic stimulation in parallel with an increase in levels of muscarinic receptors and the G-protein alpha-subunits alpha i and alpha o (Haigh, L. S., Leatherman, G. F., O'Hara, D. S., Smith, T. W., and Galper, J. B. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 15608-15618). In this study we determined whether growth of chick ventricular cells in medium supplemented with lipoprotein depleted serum could alter levels of muscarinic receptors and G-protein alpha-subunits and induce a negative chronotropic response to muscarinic stimulation. We further determined whether levels of mRNA coding for muscarinic receptors, G-proteins, and the acetylcholine-sensitive K+ channel were coordinately regulated. Growth of embryonic chick ventricular cells from hearts 14 days in ovo in medium supplemented with lipoprotein depleted serum resulted in a 21 +/- 5% (n = 3, +/- S.E.) increase in muscarinic receptor number as demonstrated by [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding and a 4.7 +/- 1.0 (+/- S.E., n = 4)-fold increase in G alpha i2 as demonstrated by Western blot analysis. These changes in receptor and G-protein were associated with a coordinate increase in levels of mRNA coding for the M2 muscarinic receptor, G alpha i2 and the acetylcholine sensitive K+ channel as determined by RNase protection. These increases were reversed by addition of 30 microM mevinolin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase activity. Carbamylcholine (0.1 mM) had no effect on beat rate in ventricular cells grown in medium supplemented with fetal calf serum. Cells grown in medium supplemented with lipoprotein depleted serum demonstrated a 40 +/- 8% (+/- S.E., n = 10, p < 0.0001) decrease in beat rate in response to 0.1 mM carbamylcholine which was reversed by the addition of 30 microM mevinolin. These data suggest that, during growth in medium supplemented with lipoprotein depleted serum, a component of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway plays a role in the coordinate induction of mRNAs coding for receptors, G-proteins, and an effector (ion channel) that results in the induction of a parasympathetic response in the ventricular cell characteristic of the atrial phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1549642766,"cAMP receptor protein (CRP), when interacting with cAMP, controls the expression of a network of catabolite-sensitive genes in Escherichia coli. To understand the molecular events that lead to the activation of CRP, a combined approach of site-directed mutagenesis and thermodynamic analysis was employed to study a member of a specific class of CRP mutant, CRP, which activates the in vivo expression of CRP-dependent operons in cya- strains in the absence of exogenous cAMP. Results from in vitro studies show that the CRP mutant G141Q absolutely requires cAMP for interacting with specific DNA. A quantitative comparison of the thermodynamic parameters governing ligand binding and DNA-protein complex formation in the presence of different cyclic nucleotides leads to the conclusion that this CRP mutant is activated only in the presence of cyclic nucleotides. The specificity toward cyclic nucleotides exhibited by wild-type CRP is lost in this mutant. Furthermore, the binding affinity of the ligand for the first binding site of the mutant is essentially the same as that of wild-type CRP regardless of the identity of the cyclic nucleotide. Hence, the observed in vivo activation of CRP-dependent operons by G141Q in the absence of exogenous cAMP is most likely the consequence of the replacement of cAMP by other cyclic nucleotides to activate the mutant. It is also possible that trace levels of cAMP present in the cya- strain could account for the in vivo activation of the mutant. Furthermore, these results indicate that this CRP mutant does not assume the activated conformation in the absence of cyclic nucleotides, in contrast to the current model derived from results of in vivo studies."
https://openalex.org/W1534353867,"The first part of this study reported the existence of two different conformations of chemically equivalent Ca(2+)-ATPase molecules from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which were in pH-dependent equilibrium between E1 (high affinity state for calcium) and E2 (low affinity state for calcium) and predominantly in E2 independent of pH, respectively, before calcium binding (Nakamura, J., and Furokohri, T. (1994) J. Biol. Chem, 269, 30818-30821). Here, calcium bindings at the ATPase molecules were further studied by varying [Ca2+] and pH at 0 degree C. The molecule, which pre-existed in equilibrium between E1 and E2, noncooperatively (the Hill value (nH) approximately 1) bound calcium with an apparent calcium affinity (K0.5) of 2-6 microM independent of pH. nH of the pH profile of the pre-existing equilibrium was about 2, suggesting participation of two protons in the equilibrium. On the other hand, the molecule, which predominantly pre-existed in E2, cooperatively (nH approximately 2) bound calcium with K0.5, which was increased from about 7 microM to about 0.2 microM by increasing pH from 6.23 to 7.40. Analysis of pH dependency of the K0.5 showed participation of 1 proton/calcium in competition for the binding sites. Calcium bindings at the two ATPase molecules seem to be differently modulated by the proton(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1501469823,"Abstract Preprosomatostatin (preproSRIF) is a peptide hormone precursor that undergoes tissue-specific processing at either a single set of paired basic residues to yield SRIF-14 or, alternatively, at a monobasic site to produce SRIF-28, an NH2 terminally extended form of SRIF-14. Mammalian preproSRIFs are a family of precursors that are remarkably conserved from rat to humans. In five species, the signal peptide and propeptides are approximately 96% identical; this high degree of sequence identity may be indicative of functional conservation. Since the is approximately five times larger than SRIF-14, we hypothesized that it would be secreted as a separate polypeptide following proSRIF proteolytic processing. To test this idea, we raised polyclonal antibodies to the entire to follow its biosynthesis and secretion. Here we demonstrate that in transfected rat anterior pituitary GH3 cells both SRIF-14 and the intact 9.5-kDa were processed coordinately from proSRIF with identical kinetics. Treatment of the cells with chloroquine, a weak base which inhibits processing to mature SRIF-14, also inhibited the appearance of the 9.5-kDa propeptide. Approximately 40% of the was targeted to the regulated secretory pathway as determined by its quantitative secretion in response to secretagogues. We also examined the secretion of the SRIF independently of SRIF-14 by expressing a truncated propeptide in which SRIF-14 was deleted. Significantly, the SRIF was itself efficiently transported through the secretory pathway and secreted into the culture medium. This suggests that the possesses all the topogenic information necessary for intracellular transport. The coordinate secretion of the intact with mature SRIF-14 suggests that it might function as a novel bioactive peptide."
https://openalex.org/W986474878,"Abstract Two pools of calcium binding sites of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase have been found at 0 degrees C: Half of the calcium sites are in a slow (t1/2 > or = 2 s)/rapid (t1/2 < 2 s) binding site dependent on pH, and the other half are in a slow binding state independent of pH (Nakamura, J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 17029-17031). Herein, to clarify the molecular basis of the two calcium sites, the relation between calcium binding to the enzyme and phosphorylation of the enzyme was examined at pH 7.40, where the calcium sites are split into rapid and slow binding states. The enzyme was slowly or rapidly phosphorylated with ATP, accompanied by slow or rapid calcium binding with a stoichiometry of about 1:2. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of lysyl endopeptidase peptides of the ATPase preparation confirmed the homogeneity of the preparation, which was of fast twitch muscle type. These results suggest that each of the two pools of calcium sites belongs to one of the two different conformations of chemically equivalent ATPase molecules, which are in pH-dependent equilibrium between E1 (high affinity state for calcium) and E2 (low affinity state for calcium) and predominantly in E2 independent of pH, respectively, before calcium binding."
