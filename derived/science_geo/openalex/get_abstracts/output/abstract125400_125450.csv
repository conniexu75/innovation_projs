https://openalex.org/W2000647744,"A novel secreted glycoprotein that regulates bone resorption has been identified. The protein, termed Osteoprotegerin (OPG), is a novel member of the TNF receptor superfamily. In vivo, hepatic expression of OPG in transgenic mice results in a profound yet nonlethal osteopetrosis, coincident with a decrease in later stages of osteoclast differentiation. These same effects are observed upon administration of recombinant OPG into normal mice. In vitro, osteoclast differentiation from precursor cells is blocked in a dose-dependent manner by recombinant OPG. Furthermore, OPG blocks ovariectomy-associated bone loss in rats. These data show that OPG can act as a soluble factor in the regulation of bone mass and imply a utility for OPG in the treatment of osteoporosis associated with increased osteoclast activity."
https://openalex.org/W2004561527,"Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme essential for the replication of chromosome termini in most eukaryotes. Telomerase RNA components have been identified from many organisms, but no protein component has been demonstrated to catalyze telomeric DNA extension. Telomerase was purified from Euplotes aediculatus , a ciliated protozoan, and one of its proteins was partially sequenced by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Cloning and sequence analysis of the corresponding gene revealed that this 123-kilodalton protein (p123) contains reverse transcriptase motifs. A yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) homolog was found and subsequently identified as EST2 (ever shorter telomeres), deletion of which had independently been shown to produce telomere defects. Introduction of single amino acid substitutions within the reverse transcriptase motifs of Est2 protein led to telomere shortening and senescence in yeast, indicating that these motifs are important for catalysis of telomere elongation in vivo. In vitro telomeric DNA extension occurred with extracts from wild-type yeast but not from est2 mutants or mutants deficient in telomerase RNA. Thus, the reverse transcriptase protein fold, previously known to be involved in retroviral replication and retrotransposition, is essential for normal chromosome telomere replication in diverse eukaryotes."

Mice with a disrupted BCL-6 gene developed myocarditis and pulmonary vasculitis, had no germinal centers, and had increased expression of T helper cell type 2 cytokines. The BCL-6 DNA recognition motif resembled sites bound by the STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) transcription factors, which mediate cytokine signaling. BCL-6 could repress interleukin-4 (IL-4)-induced transcription when bound to a site recognized by the IL-4-responsive transcription factor Stat6. Thus, dysregulation of STAT-responsive genes may underlie the inflammatory disease in BCL-6-deficient mice and participate in lymphoid malignancies."

Uranium, but not thorium, is readily mobilized in the fluid. A negative array between thorium/cerium and neodymium-143/neodymium-144 indicates that significant amounts of the thorium in arc rocks are derived from subducted sediments, although perhaps only about 30 percent of the thorium in subducted sediments is returned to the crust in this way. The transfer times for fluid through the mantle wedge are about 30,000 to 120,000 years, whereas those for sediment melts may be several million years. The low average uranium/thorium ratios of bulk crust primarily reflect different crustal generation processes in the Archaean."

We describe the molecular cloning, distribution, activation mechanism, and overexpression of two MARK proteins from rat that arise from distinct genes. They encode Ser/Thr kinases of 88 and 81 kDa, respectively, and show similarity to the yeast kin1+ and C. elegans par-1 genes that are involved in the establishment of cell polarity. Expression of both isoforms is ubiquitous, and homologous genes are present in humans. Catalytic activity depends on phosphorylation of two residues in subdomain VIII. Overexpression of MARK in cells leads to hyperphosphorylation of MAPs on KXGS motifs and to disruption of the microtubule array, resulting in morphological changes and cell death."

https://openalex.org/W2053598517,"Crystal engineering of molecular materials is commonly frustrated by the absence of reliable structural paradigms that are needed for systematic design of crystal lattices with predictable structure and desirable function. This problem can be attributed, at least partially, to the absence of robust supramolecular motifs that serve as synthons for the assembly of crystal lattices. A novel class of molecular crystals based on two-dimensional hydrogen (H)-bonded networks comprising guanidinium ions and the sulfonate groups of alkane- or arenedisulfonate ions is described. The disulfonate ions act as pillars that connect opposing H-bonded sheets and form nanoporous galleries with one-dimensional channels. The flexibility of the H-bonded network allows the galleries to adapt to changes in the steric requirements of guest molecules that occupy the channels. This robustness reduces crystal engineering to the last remaining dimension, enabling rational adjustment of the gallery heights by choice of the disulfonate pillar."
https://openalex.org/W1964918262,"Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a heterodimeric DNA binding complex composed of two basic-helix-loop-helix Per-AHR-ARNT-Sim proteins (HIF-1α and −1β), is a key component of a widely operative transcriptional response activated by hypoxia, cobaltous ions, and iron chelation. To identify regions of HIF-1 subunits responsible for oxygen-regulated activity, we constructed chimeric genes in which portions of coding sequence from HIF-1 genes were either linked to a heterologous DNA binding domain or encoded between such a DNA binding domain and a constitutive activation domain. Sequences from HIF-1α but not HIF-1β conferred oxygen-regulated activity. Two minimal domains within HIF-1α (amino acids 549-582 and amino acids 775-826) were defined by deletional analysis, each of which could act independently to convey inducible responses. Both these regions confer transcriptional activation, and in both cases adjacent sequences appeared functionally repressive in transactivation assays. The inducible operation of the first domain, but not the second, involved major changes in the level of the activator fusion protein in transfected cells, inclusion of this sequence being associated with a marked reduction of expressed protein level in normoxic cells, which was relieved by stimulation with hypoxia, cobaltous ions, or iron chelation. These results lead us to propose a dual mechanism of activation in which the operation of an inducible activation domain is amplified by regulation of transcription factor abundance, most likely occurring through changes in protein stability.

The importance of HIF-1 in the regulation of such genes has been confirmed by the reduction or abrogation of hypoxia-inducible expression in mutant cells (13Hankinson O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Together these studies have provided strong evidence for a critical role for HIF-1 in the regulation of genes involved in a variety of important biological processes that include glucose transport and metabolism, vascular growth, vasomotor regulation, erythropoiesis, iron metabolism, and catecholamine synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 5Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Google Scholar).As is observed for HIF-1-responsive genes (20Goldberg M.A. Dunning S.P. Bunn H.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1412-1415Google Scholar, 21Goldberg M.A. Schneider T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4355-4359Google Scholar, 22Gleadle J.M. Ebert B.L. Firth J.D. Ratcliffe P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1362-C1368Google Scholar), the HIF-1 complex is inducible by particular transition elements such as cobaltous ions and by iron chelating agents such as desferrioxamine (DFO) but not by inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration such as cyanide or azide (3Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4304-4308Google Scholar, 8Ebert B.L. Firth J.D. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29083-29089Google Scholar, 23Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Blood. 1993; 82: 3610-3615Google Scholar). These distinctive features have led to the proposal of a specific oxygen sensing mechanism underlying these responses, most probably involving the operation of a ferroprotein sensor (20Goldberg M.A. Dunning S.P. Bunn H.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1412-1415Google Scholar). Recent affinity purification and molecular cloning of HIF-1 (24Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Google Scholar) has revealed that the DNA binding complex consists of a heterodimer of two basic-helix-loop-helix Per-AHR-ARNT-Sim proteins HIF-1α and HIF-1β, a molecule that is identical to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) (25Reyes H. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O. Science. 1992; 256: 1193-1195Google Scholar). An important goal is now to define the regions of the HIF-1 molecules that are responsible for their regulated activity and to understand the mechanism by which the complex is induced and activated in hypoxic cells.Since in the majority of studies, HIF-1 activation does not appear to be mediated through regulation of its mRNAs (15Wood S.M. Gleadle J.M. Pugh C.W. Hankinson O. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15117-15123Google Scholar, 17Gradin K. McGuire J. Wenger R.H. Kvietikova I. Whitelaw M.L. Toftgard R. Tora L. Gassmann M. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5221-5231Google Scholar, 26Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Google Scholar), we focused our analysis on other possible mechanisms of regulation. As with other transcription factors, studies of the regulatory mechanisms are potentially complicated by the ultimate dependence of transcriptional activation on a series of interrelated events which may include nuclear accumulation, dimerization, DNA binding, co-factor recruitment, and transactivation. For HIF-1, a further difficulty in this analysis lies in the operation of the native system in all cells so far tested (2Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2423-2427Google Scholar, 3Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4304-4308Google Scholar, 27Beck I. Weinmann R. Caro J. Blood. 1993; 82: 704-711Google Scholar, 28Pugh C.W. Ebert B.L. Ebrahim O. Ratcliffe P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 297-306Google Scholar). For these reasons we used the construction of chimeric genes to define regions of the HIF-1 genes that could confer oxygen-regulated behavior on heterologous transcription factors. Two types of chimeric gene were produced, those in which the heterologous transcription factor encoded nuclear localization and DNA binding, but lacked intrinsic transactivation potential, and others in which an activation domain was either intrinsic to the heterologous gene or added to the chimeric gene from a second heterologous gene. This allowed for both the definition of activation domains of HIF-1 genes and analysis of regulatory domains that did not necessarily contain intrinsic transactivation potential.Sequences from HIF-1α but not HIF-1β/ARNT conveyed inducible activity on heterologous transcription factors, and two regions within the C-terminal portion of the HIF-1α molecule were defined, each of which possessed transactivation potential and each of which could act independently to convey inducible properties. Both domains were responsive to cobaltous ions and iron chelation as well as hypoxia. The inducible activity of one regulatory domain, but not the other, appeared to be closely connected with modulation of the level of the encoded fusion protein, most probably arising from an effect on protein stability. These studies therefore define the existence of more than one regulatory domain in the HIF-1α subunit and strongly suggest the operation of more than one mechanism of regulation.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated that sequences from the α subunit of HIF-1 convey hypoxia-inducible activity when fused to the DNA binding domain of heterologous transcription factors. As has been established for the activation of HIF-1, the chimeric transcription factors also responded to cobaltous ions and desferrioxamine but not to mitochondrial inhibitors. Such responses were not observed for the HIF-1β/ARNT subunit, defining a regulatory function for HIF-1α.In our initial analysis of HIF-1α, we fused sequences from this gene to the N-terminal 500 amino acids of the glucocorticoid receptor, a sequence which itself possesses transactivation activity localized to the N terminus. This strategy was designed to enable sequences from HIF-1α to be assayed for regulatory properties independently of their own transactivation capability. When the activity of such fusion proteins was tested, an inducible response was observed for fusions containing C-terminal sequences lying distal to the portions of the molecule known to be involved in DNA binding and dimerization (37Jiang B.-H. Rue E. Wang G.L. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17771-17778Google Scholar). When fused to the truncated glucocorticoid receptor, HIF-1α sequences 530-826 and 28-826 conferred similar inducible behavior. Since, despite the intrinsic transcriptional activity of the truncated glucocorticoid receptor, several fusions containing N-terminal sequences had very low activities which made induction difficult to assess (Fig. 2, and data not shown), this result does not necessarily exclude inducible properties within HIF-1α sequences lying N-terminal to amino acid 530. However, the findings did indicate that sequences lying distal to amino acid 530 were sufficient to convey highly inducible activity and focused our detailed analysis on this portion of the molecule.This analysis defined two regions within these sequences which could independently confer inducible characteristics on heterologous transcription factors. One region was defined within HIF-1α amino acids 530-652. That this region was responsive to the inducing stimuli was first suggested by comparison of the activity of different glucocorticoid receptor/HIF-1α fusion proteins in HeLa cells (Fig. 2) and confirmed by its action on constitutively active chimeric transcription factors constructed from the DNA binding domain of Gal4 and activation domains from HIF-1β/ARNT or the herpes simplex virus protein VP16 (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6). The second region was defined within amino acids 652-826. Although inducible activity was clearly observed when this sequence was tested as a Gal4 fusion in Hep3B cells, the sequence had only constitutive activity when tested as a glucocorticoid receptor fusion in HeLa cells. This difference could not be assigned to reporter system or cell type specificity, since the relevant glucocorticoid receptor/HIF-1α fusion showed inducible activity in Hep3B cells, and the relevant Gal4/HIF-1α fusion showed activity in HeLa cells albeit of lower amplitude. Whatever the reason for the differences, these experiments did define two regulatory domains of HIF-1α that were capable of independent action. Deletional analysis demonstrated that in each case the property was located within a relatively short amino acid sequence (amino acids 549-582 for the first domain and amino acids 775-826 for the second), and functional analysis demonstrated that in each case the inducible characteristic included stimulation by cobaltous ions and DFO as well as hypoxia. Somewhat surprisingly, in Hep3B cells, stimulation by cobaltous ions and DFO was more effective than hypoxia, a difference that is not generally observed in the regulation of endogenous HIF-1-dependent genes (20Goldberg M.A. Dunning S.P. Bunn H.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1412-1415Google Scholar, 22Gleadle J.M. Ebert B.L. Firth J.D. Ratcliffe P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1362-C1368Google Scholar, 23Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Blood. 1993; 82: 3610-3615Google Scholar) and that was not observed in the transactivation assays performed in HeLa cells.Amino acids in both the critical regions are 100% conserved between human and mouse genes although, overall, amino acids 530-826 of the human sequence are only 83% conserved in the mouse (16Li H. Ko H.P. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21262-21267Google Scholar, 24Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Google Scholar, 38Wenger R.H. Rolfs A. Marti H.H. Guénet J.-L. Gassmann M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 54-59Google Scholar). In keeping with the functional significance of this conservation, the C-terminal 52-amino acid domain that we have defined in the human HIF-1α lies within the region homologous to an 83-amino acid-inducible activation domain defined in studies of mouse HIF-1α published during the course of this work (16Li H. Ko H.P. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21262-21267Google Scholar). Our finding of a second regulatory domain lying N-terminal to this region does not imply a species difference in the mode of regulation since in the analysis of the mouse gene that domain was not analyzed independently or in the context of a heterologous activation domain.An important aspect of our analysis of these regulatory domains was the finding that sequences within amino acids 530-652 of HIF-1α had a striking effect on the levels of fusion protein in the transfected cells. In normoxic cells, the level of the Gal/ARNT fusion was dramatically reduced by this sequence, the reduction being relieved by exposure of cells to hypoxia, cobalt, and DFO in a manner that correlated with the functional results. Studies of the regulation of endogenous HIF-1 have demonstrated large increases in HIF-1α protein level in hypoxic cells (24Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Google Scholar, 26Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Google Scholar) despite relative stability of HIF-1α mRNA levels (15Wood S.M. Gleadle J.M. Pugh C.W. Hankinson O. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15117-15123Google Scholar, 17Gradin K. McGuire J. Wenger R.H. Kvietikova I. Whitelaw M.L. Toftgard R. Tora L. Gassmann M. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5221-5231Google Scholar, 26Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Google Scholar). Based on the apparent stability of HIF-1α protein in hypoxic cells and its rapid degradation when cells are re-oxygenated, it has been proposed that the regulation of HIF-1 involves changes in stability of the α subunit (26Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Google Scholar). Although similar measurements are difficult in transiently transfected cells, and we have not formally addressed the mechanism by which the fusion protein levels are regulated, our results are most consistent with this proposal and with the regulatory domain we have defined containing a regulated determinant of protein stability. First, the effect of the HIF-1α sequences was always to reduce protein levels, reduction being profound in normoxic cells and relieved to a greater or lesser extent in stimulated cells. Second, these effects were observed on gene products expressed using the powerful constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter and optimized translational initiation sequences from different heterologous genes. Third, this region of HIF-1α is rich in proline, glutamic acid/aspartic acid, serine, and threonine residues that have been implicated as signals directing protein degradation (39Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biol. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Google Scholar).Further analysis indicated that sequences 549-572 were critically important for the effect on protein level. Deletion of sequences surrounding this region also had effects; for instance, deletion of amino acids 582-634 increased fusion protein levels in normoxic cells, suggesting that these sequences might also contribute to the mechanism of regulation. In the functional analysis, successive deletions of amino acids 582-634 led to a progressive increase in the activity of the chimeric transcription factor in normoxic cells and a progressive reduction in the amplitude of the inducible response. Although in the overall analysis of HIF-1α sequences 530-652 correlation was clearly present between the functional effects and protein levels, we cannot be sure whether regulation of protein level could fully account for the effects on activity. Substantial quantitative discrepancies were apparent between the two measurements, but given the likelihood of a nonlinear relationship in the process of transcriptional activation, and the fact that we used a plasmid amplification system in these experiments, it is difficult to know whether such differences are evidence for additional mechanisms of transcriptional regulation at this site.In the analysis of the C-terminal domain of HIF-1α much more convincing support for this possibility was obtained. Gal4/HIF-1α fusion proteins containing C-terminal sequences were expressed at a much higher level than fusion proteins containing amino acids 530-652, and irrespective of whether the plasmid amplification system was used, their levels were not regulated by the inducing stimuli. Moreover, when Gal4 DNA binding activity was assayed by EMSA, activity in cells transfected with the Gal/HIF-1α C-terminal fusion was similar to that obtained in cells transfected with the plasmid encoding the Gal4 DNA binding domain alone. Thus the inducible activation associated with this domain did not appear to result from changes in protein level or DNA binding activity. Together with the analysis of amino acids 530-652 our results strongly suggest the operation of at least two different mechanisms of transcriptional regulation for HIF-1α, one based on post-translational enhancement of activation and the other involving regulation of transcription factor levels, most probably through changes in protein stability.One further point in relation to the analysis of amino acid sequences 530-652 is the co-localization of a potential stability determinant and activation domain, which raises an issue as to the relation between the two processes. Both processes may be separately and actively regulated or one may occur as a default consequence of lack of activation of the other. These possibilities are difficult to distinguish, although the increased protein level and loss of functional activity observed when the critical amino acids 549-572 were deleted shows that increases in protein level can be independent of the process of transactivation. Interestingly, transcriptional activation was only modest when amino acids 530-652 were considered in isolation (Fig. 3), even when the highly active core sequence 549-582 was assessed as a simple Gal4 fusion (data not shown), nor was a positive interaction observed when the sequences were placed adjacent to the VP16 activation domain (Fig. 5). In contrast, in stimulated cells, a strongly positive interaction was observed with both the constitutive C-terminal activation domain of HIF-1β/ARNT and the inducible C-terminal activation domain of HIF-1α, allowing the possibility that such interactions in cis or in trans could be important in the function of the native HIF-1 heterodimer. In considering the functional data alone, the power of this interaction is disguised. Thus, in stimulated cells the activity of chimeric genes expressing HIF-1α sequences 530-826 was only a little greater than those expressing sequences 652-826, but when the differences in protein level and DNA binding activity are considered (Fig. 8, Fig. 9), it can be seen that the specific activation potential of the product containing the additional amino acids 530-652 must be very much greater.Overall, our results suggest a model in which the function of an inducible activation domain is amplified by modulation of protein level, most probably occurring through changes in protein stability. There are many precedents for post-translational modifications that enhance transactivation through phosphorylation, ligand-dependent conformational change, or co-factor recruitment (40Calkhoven C.F. Geert A.B. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 329-342Google Scholar). Less well recognized is the regulation of transcription through changes in the stability of transcription factors, although several examples have recently been described, dependent either on the action of a specific protease or on the inducible targeting of the protein to the ubiquitin-dependent proteosomal system of degradation (39Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biol. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Google Scholar, 41Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 340-347Google Scholar). Aside from the preponderance of proline, glutamic acid/aspartic acid, serine, and threonine residues, examination of the critical sequences defined in the deletional analysis did not reveal any known recognition motifs for such systems nor did mutation of phosphoacceptor sites at residues 551, 552, 555, 565, 576, and 581 affect the operation of this regulatory domain. Nevertheless detailed analysis of these sequences should now permit important new insights to be gained into this mechanism of transcriptional regulation and the underlying processes of oxygen sensing.

Together these studies have provided strong evidence for a critical role for HIF-1 in the regulation of genes involved in a variety of important biological processes that include glucose transport and metabolism, vascular growth, vasomotor regulation, erythropoiesis, iron metabolism, and catecholamine synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 5Bunn H.F.

These distinctive features have led to the proposal of a specific oxygen sensing mechanism underlying these responses, most probably involving the operation of a ferroprotein sensor (20Goldberg M.A. Dunning S.P. Bunn H.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1412-1415Google Scholar). Recent affinity purification and molecular cloning of HIF-1 (24Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have disrupted the gene encoding KAHRP and show that it is essential for knob formation. Knob-transfectants adhere to CD36 in static assays; when tested under flow conditions that mimic those of postcapillary venules, however, the binding to CD36 was dramatically reduced.

INTRODUCTIONDevelopment of chronic hepatitis and the potential for disease progression to hepatocellular carcinoma (1Saito I. Miyamura T. Ohbayashi A. Harada H. Katayama T. Kikuchi S. Watanabe Y.

Successful purification of HCV from either infected tissues or cultured cells has not been reported. It is possible that HCV is stringently hepatotropic being restricted to replicate and release only in differentiated hepatocytes, which may have HCV receptors on the cell surface and specific functions that support viral growth (2Ito T. Mukaigawa J. Zuo J. Hirabayashi Y. Mitamura K. Yasui K. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 1043-1054Google Scholar). Thus it is difficult to study the biological properties and pathogenicity of the virus in the absence of unequivocal evidence for common ancestry of HCV (3Zanotto P.M. deA. Gibbs M. Gould E.A. Holmes E.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6083-6096Google Scholar). The mechanism of HCV replication at the molecular level so far has depended upon comparative analysis and expression of its partial or entire genome with those of distantly related flaviviruses or pestiviruses (4Suzuki R. Matsuura Y. Suzuki T. Ando T.A. Chiba J. Harada S. Saito I. Miyamura T. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 53-61Google Scholar). The virus genome encodes a single polyprotein precursor of ∼3,000 amino acids (5Choo Q.-L. Richman K.H. Han J.H. Berger K. Lee C. Dong C. Gallegos C. Coit D. Medina-Selby A. Barr P.J. Weiner A.J. Bradley D.W. Kuo G. Houghton M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2451-2455Google Scholar) that is cleaved by both host and viral proteases (6Hijikata M. Kato N. Ootsuyama Y. Nakagawa M. Shimotohno K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5547-5551Google Scholar, 7Grakoui A. Wychowski C. Lin C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1385-1395Google Scholar) to generate three putative structural proteins (core, E1, and E2) and at least six nonstructural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B). The structural proteins are located in the amino-terminal one-fourth of the polyprotein. The genomic region encoding the putative core protein is relatively conserved (8Bukh J. Purcell R.H. Miller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8239-8243Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of the core protein has been established at amino acid position 191. The HCV core protein demonstrates diverse biological functions including the regulation of cellular and unrelated viral genes at the transcriptional level (9Ray R.B. Lagging L.M. Meyer K. Steele R. Ray R. Virus Res. 1995; 37: 209-220Google Scholar), suppression of cisplatin and c-myc-induced apoptosis (10Ray R.B. Meyer K. Ray R. Virology. 1996; 226: 176-182Google Scholar), and transformation of REF cells in cooperation with the H-ras oncogene (11Ray R.B. Lagging L.M. Meyer K. Ray R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4438-4443Google Scholar).Hepatocellular carcinoma accounts for over 90% of primary liver cancers and may progress through the inactivation of the p53 gene via mutations (12Hsu I.C. Metcalf R.A. Sun T. Welsh J.A. Wang N.J. Harris C.C. Nature. 1991; 350: 427-428Google Scholar, 13Aguilar F. Harris C.C. Sun T. Hollstein M. Cerutti P. Science. 1994; 264: 1317-1319Google Scholar). Because HCV appears to cause hepatocellular carcinoma, in this study we evaluated the ability of the HCV core protein to regulate the expression of p53 in a cotransfection system. Our results suggested that the HCV core protein caused down-regulation of p53, and this appeared to be consistent with the controversial observations about HCV core moving into the nucleus.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA cotransfection assay was used to investigate the role of the HCV core gene product on the transcription of the human p53 gene. COS7 cells were cotransfected with the plasmid encompassing the human p53 promoter linked to a reporter CAT gene (p53-CAT) and increasing amounts of CMV Core1-191 plasmid DNA. The vector alone was also used as a negative control in the cotransfection assay. A representation of the CAT assay result is shown in Fig. 1A. Results from this experiment suggested that the core protein inhibits p53 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. The CAT activity decreased (20-85%) as the quantity of CMV Core1-191 plasmid DNA was increased in the transfection of cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 1-5). A similar effect was observed utilizing the MuLV LTR-driven HCV core gene in a transfection with the human p53 promoter reporter construct in the transient transfection assay (Fig. 1B). An in vitro transient assay using a mouse p53-CAT construct and the CMV Core1-191 plasmid DNAs was also performed. HCV core protein displayed repressor activity on the mouse p53 promoter (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggested that repression of p53 promoter activity may be attributed to the exogenous expression of the HCV core protein.To determine whether HCV core protein-mediated p53 transcriptional regulation is cell type-specific or may be influenced by the endogenous expression of integrated E6 from human papilloma virus 18, we chose to use human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells. A CAT assay was performed by transfection of p53-CAT and different doses of the HCV core gene. The mean results from at least three independent experiments are shown in Table I. The results indicated that the inhibition of p53 promoter activity by the HCV core protein was not limited to a specific function in COS7 cells. The inhibition of p53 promoter activity by the core protein might be due to a phenomenon called squelching (18Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Google Scholar), where high levels of cotransfected activator proteins have been shown to repress expression of certain genes through sequestration of coactivators away from the promoter. To exclude the possibility of squelching in the inhibition of p53 promoter activity by HCV core protein, the core-mediated activation of the c-myc promoter was tested. Under the same conditions, the core protein stimulated the human c-myc promoter (>400% as the index) and inhibited p53 promoter (68% as the index) activity in COS7 cells (data not shown). Additionally, the dose-dependent regulation of p53 promoter activity (Fig. 1A) suggested that the suppression is not due to squelching.Table I.Effect of HCV core protein on p53 promoterAmount of CMV Core (μg)Cell type usedp53 statusCAT expressionaPercentages of CAT activity presented as the means ± S.D. indicate the extent of conversion with respect to the basal level (100%) of p53 promoter-CAT gene construct.Number of experiments% of conversion2COS7Wild type32.8 ± 2.154COS7Wild type3.0 ± 0.652HeLaBound by HPVE6b37.2 ± 1.834HeLaBound by HPVE63.4 ± 0.93a Percentages of CAT activity presented as the means ± S.D. indicate the extent of conversion with respect to the basal level (100%) of p53 promoter-CAT gene construct. Open table in a new tab To identify the domain responsible for suppression of p53 promoter activity, a full-length clone and deletion mutants of the core gene encompassing different lengths of amino acids (amino acids 1-55, 1-80, 1-122, and 80-191) were used in a CAT assay. The core gene deletion mutants were tested for protein expression by an in vitro transient expression. The CAT assay results of transcriptional regulation of the p53 promoter by the full-length and HCV core gene deletion mutants and vector DNA are shown in Fig. 2. The results indicated that the core protein domain required for the majority of p53 repression is located between amino acid positions 80 and 122.Fig. 2Localization of the HCV core protein domain responsible for p53 promoter suppression. Schematic diagram of the deletion mutants of HCV core protein used is shown (A). COS7 cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of p53CAT reporter plasmid and 2 μg of the HCV core expression plasmid, and CAT assay was performed 48 h after transfection (B). Deletion mutant Core1-55 and the vector DNA negative control showed a similar level of activity on the p53 promoter. On the other hand, repression of p53 promoter activity was observed by the full-length Core1-191 or deletion mutants Core1-122 and Core1-80.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine whether the endogenous p53 gene is repressed by the HCV core gene in HCVcore/H-ras transformed REF cells, the p53 mRNA level was measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR. The level of p53 mRNA present in the primary REF cells and HCV core transformed REF cells appeared to be similar. This observation is inconsistent with the CAT assay results presented here. However, it is possible that the level of the HCV core protein expression is different in HCV core/ras transformed REF cells than in an in vitro transient assay. HCV core protein-mediated repression of p53 may be an early event that precedes cellular transformation. Therefore p53 expression is no longer relevant in the transformed REF cells. Because p53 maintains the genetic integrity of cells by controlling progression through the cell cycle, the loss of p53 function appears therefore to be associated with increased genetic instability and the accumulation of mutations, which likely precede oncogenic transformation (19Levine A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 623-651Google Scholar). Together, our observations suggest that the HCV core protein may exert a biological role for the promotion of cell growth by repression of p53 transcription during persistent infection. However, we did not observe a clear relationship between p53 and HCV core protein expression at this time, and the in vivo function of the core protein remains unclear.Viral proteins may influence cellular genes, which in turn may be involved in the negative regulation of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Inactivation of cellular genes may be a mechanism for the disruption of normal cell growth (20Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Google Scholar). Additionally, host factor has been identified as an important component for modulation of RNA virus replication (21Brazas R. Ganem D. Science. 1996; 274: 90-94Google Scholar). The HCV core protein is highly basic (isoelectric point 12.05) and could in principle show affinity toward nucleic acids and translocate to the nucleus during the mitotic phase, when the nuclear membrane is absent (22Ravaggi A. Natoli G. Primi D. Albertini A. Levrero M. Cariani E. J. Hepatol. 1994; 20: 833-836Google Scholar). Regions responsible for RNA and ribosome binding activities are probably located in the amino-terminal portion of the putative core protein (23Santolini E. Migliaccio G. La Monica N. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3631-3641Google Scholar). However, the presence of a putative DNA-binding motif, nuclear localization signals, phosphorylation sites, and the appearance of the core protein in the nucleus suggest its possible function as a gene regulatory protein (9Ray R.B. Lagging L.M. Meyer K. Steele R. Ray R. Virus Res. 1995; 37: 209-220Google Scholar, 24Shih C.M. Lo S.J. Miyamura T. Chen S.Y. Lee Y.W. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5823-5832Google Scholar, 25Shih C.M.

Ray R. Virus Res. 1996; 45: 87-92Google Scholar). Three different core protein products of ∼21 (p21), 19 (p19), and 16 kDa (p16) have been reported (26Lo S. Masiarz F. Hwang S.B. Lai M.C. Ou J. Virology. 1995; 213: 455-461Google Scholar). Both p21 and p19 displayed a cytoplasmic localization, whereas p16 shows localization to the nucleus. In regard to HCV genotype 1a, the production of the truncated p16 was associated with an amino acid substitution at codon 9 to a lysine residue. In contrast, the core protein of genotype 1b has been shown to lack nuclear localization (4Suzuki R. Matsuura Y. Suzuki T. Ando T.A. Chiba J. Harada S. Saito I. Miyamura T. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 53-61Google Scholar, 26Lo S. Masiarz F. Hwang S.B. Lai M.C. Ou J. Virology. 1995; 213: 455-461Google Scholar). Whether the difference in nuclear localization of the core protein is genotype-specific or cell type/cell cycle-specific or whether p16 is synthesized during virus replication in the infected cells remains to be examined. It is also not clear at this time if translocation of the putative core protein into the nucleus is affected by the expression of other HCV-associated proteins. HCV core protein exhibits promoter-specific differences in its mode of action. However, the mechanism by which the core protein regulates transcription remains to be elucidated.Repression of the endogenous human p53 gene may have a biological implication in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The p53 gene encodes a tumor suppressor protein involved in maintaining the genetic integrity of the cell. Consistent with this, somatic mutations that are strongly implicated in the etiology of sporadic human malignancies, and germ line mutations in p53 are associated with a number of inherited cancers (19Levine A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 623-651Google Scholar). A large number of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma are exposed to hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus, and a p53 mutation is found in a significant number of these patients (28Yumoto Y. Hanafusa T. Hada H. Morita T. Ooguchi S. Shinji N. Mitani T. Hamaya K. Koide N. Tsuji T. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 1995; 10: 179-185Google Scholar). Reduced or inactivated p53 in HCV-infected cells would thus lead to the suppression of cell cycle arrest, leading to rapid progression through the requisite DNA damage repair cycle prior to genomic replication. Several DNA tumor viruses have been shown to interact with the p53 protein, functionally disabling p53 in the infected cells and possibly contributing to virus-dependent transformation (29Werness B.A. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Science. 1990; 248: 76-79Google Scholar, 30Wang X.W. Forrester K. Yeh H. Feitelson M.A. Gu J.-R. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recent studies suggest that retroviruses may differ from DNA tumor virus by influencing p53 transcription rather than directly interacting with p53 protein. Human immunodeficieny virus transactivator protein Tat transcriptionally represses p53 expression in T-cells, suggesting that Tat-mediated repression may contribute to human immunodeficieny virus-associated pathologies (32Li C.J. Wang C. Friedman D.J. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5461-5464Google Scholar). Similarly, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax protein may promote malignant transformation through the repression of p53 transcription (33Uittenbogaard M.N. Giebler H.A. Reisman D. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28503-28506Google Scholar).Cancer is a multi-step process that requires a cumulative effect altering both positive and negative regulators of cell proliferation and cell survival (34Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 138-141Google Scholar, 35Nowell P.C. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 408-413Google Scholar). Inactivation of p53 is an important event in human cancer (19Levine A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 623-651Google Scholar, 36Fults D. Brockmeyer D. Tullous M.W. Pedone C.A. Cawthon R.M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 674-679Google Scholar). However, with the exception of functional inactivation of the p53 protein by viral proteins (33Uittenbogaard M.N. Giebler H.A. Reisman D. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol.

Oren M. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5638-5645Google Scholar) and all previously reported examples of p53 inactivation in human tumors have been due to mutations within the p53 gene or gross chromosomal rearrangement within the p53 locus. Inhibition of p53 transcription by the core protein of HCV may serve as an important factor in this multi-step process. In addition, it is conceivable that the inappropriate expression of core protein (in the absence of viral morphogenesis) may contribute to malignancy by activating specific target genes, as well as by inactivating other inhibitory genes in addition to p53. Indeed, further study is necessary to correlate the expression level of p53 and core protein in HCV-mediated hepatocellular carcinoma. INTRODUCTIONDevelopment of chronic hepatitis and the potential for disease progression to hepatocellular carcinoma (1Saito I. Miyamura T. Ohbayashi A. Harada H. Katayama T. Kikuchi S. Watanabe Y.

Successful purification of HCV from either infected tissues or cultured cells has not been reported. It is possible that HCV is stringently hepatotropic being restricted to replicate and release only in differentiated hepatocytes, which may have HCV receptors on the cell surface and specific functions that support viral growth (2Ito T. Mukaigawa J. Zuo J. Hirabayashi Y. Mitamura K. Yasui K. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 1043-1054Google Scholar). Thus it is difficult to study the biological properties and pathogenicity of the virus in the absence of unequivocal evidence for common ancestry of HCV (3Zanotto P.M. deA. Gibbs M. Gould E.A. Holmes E.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6083-6096Google Scholar). The mechanism of HCV replication at the molecular level so far has depended upon comparative analysis and expression of its partial or entire genome with those of distantly related flaviviruses or pestiviruses (4Suzuki R. Matsuura Y. Suzuki T. Ando T.A. Chiba J. Harada S. Saito I. Miyamura T. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 53-61Google Scholar). The virus genome encodes a single polyprotein precursor of ∼3,000 amino acids (5Choo Q.-L. Richman K.H. Han J.H. Berger K. Lee C. Dong C. Gallegos C. Coit D. Medina-Selby A. Barr P.J. Weiner A.J. Bradley D.W. Kuo G. Houghton M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2451-2455Google Scholar) that is cleaved by both host and viral proteases (6Hijikata M. Kato N. Ootsuyama Y. Nakagawa M.

Virol. 1993; 67: 1385-1395Google Scholar) to generate three putative structural proteins (core, E1, and E2) and at least six nonstructural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B). The structural proteins are located in the amino-terminal one-fourth of the polyprotein. The genomic region encoding the putative core protein is relatively conserved (8Bukh J. Purcell R.H. Miller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8239-8243Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of the core protein has been established at amino acid position 191. The HCV core protein demonstrates diverse biological functions including the regulation of cellular and unrelated viral genes at the transcriptional level (9Ray R.B. Lagging L.M. Meyer K. Steele R. Ray R. Virus Res. 1995; 37: 209-220Google Scholar), suppression of cisplatin and c-myc-induced apoptosis (10Ray R.B. Meyer K. Ray R. Virology. 1996; 226: 176-182Google Scholar), and transformation of REF cells in cooperation with the H-ras oncogene (11Ray R.B. Lagging L.M. Meyer K. Ray R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4438-4443Google Scholar).Hepatocellular carcinoma accounts for over 90% of primary liver cancers and may progress through the inactivation of the p53 gene via mutations (12Hsu I.C. Metcalf R.A. Sun T. Welsh J.A. Wang N.J. Harris C.C. Nature. 1991; 350: 427-428Google Scholar, 13Aguilar F. Harris C.C. Sun T. Hollstein M. Cerutti P. Science. 1994; 264: 1317-1319Google Scholar). Because HCV appears to cause hepatocellular carcinoma, in this study we evaluated the ability of the HCV core protein to regulate the expression of p53 in a cotransfection system. Our results suggested that the HCV core protein caused down-regulation of p53, and this appeared to be consistent with the controversial observations about HCV core moving into the nucleus."

This suggests an important role for neuregulins in mediating the nerve-dependent accumulation of AChRs in the postsynaptic membrane. Nerve-muscle synapses have now been analyzed in neuregulin-deficient animals. Mice that are heterozygous for the deletion of neuregulin isoforms containing an immunoglobulin-like domain are myasthenic. Postsynaptic AChR density is significantly reduced, as judged by the decrease in the mean amplitude of spontaneous miniature endplate potentials and bungarotoxin binding. On the other hand, the mean amplitude of evoked endplate potentials was not decreased, due to an increase in the number of quanta released per impulse, a compensation that has been observed in other myasthenic states. Thus, the density of AChRs in the postsynaptic membrane depends on immunoglobulin-containing neuregulin isoforms throughout the life of the animal."

The argon-36 is probably surface-adsorbed atmospheric argon; any mantle argon-36 trapped in the vesicles cannot be distinguished from an atmospheric contaminant. Consequently the 40Ar/36Ar ratios and 3He/36Ar ratios (1.45) determined are minimum estimates of the upper mantle composition.

https://openalex.org/W1964275193,"A paleosol in the Middle Devonian Aztec Siltstone of Victoria Land, Antarctica, is the most ancient known soil of well-drained forest ecosystems. Clay enrichment and chemical weathering of subsurface horizons in this and other Devonian forested paleosols culminate a long-term increase initiated during the Silurian. From Silurian into Devonian time, red clayey calcareous paleosols show a greater volume of roots and a concomitant decline in the density of animal burrows. These trends parallel the decline in atmospheric carbon dioxide determined from isotopic records of pedogenic carbonate in these same paleosols. The drawdown of carbon dioxide began well before the Devonian appearance of coals, large logs, and diverse terrestrial plants and animals, and it did not correlate with temporal variation in volcanic or metamorphic activity. The early Paleozoic greenhouse may have been curbed by the evolution of rhizospheres with an increased ratio of primary to secondary production and by more effective silicate weathering during Silurian time."

This interaction has been suggested to be pivotal in cytotoxic mechanisms involving the modulation of oxidative stress by NO. Thiols are critical sites of interaction for NO and O2·¯ in biological systems, perhaps explaining why proteins and peptides containing thiols that undergo nitrosation as well as oxidation reactions might modulate cellular function. Reactions of chemical species derived from NO can result in the nitrosation of thiols to form S-nitrosothiol complexes (1Pryor W.A. Church D.F. Govindan C.K. Crank G. J. Org.

Recently, we have shown that oxidative and nitrosative chemistry resulting from a continuous chemical generator of NO, SPER/NO (a NONOate complex that spontaneously releases NO at physiological pH), in the presence of a source of O2·¯, xanthine oxidase (XO), is modulated by the relative rate of formation of NO and superoxide (8Miles A.M.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 40-47Google Scholar). On one hand, the nitrosative chemistry of amines is quenched by the presence of O2·¯(8Miles A.M. Gibson M. Krishna M. Cook J.C. Pacelli R. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. Free Radical Res. 1995; 233: 379-390Google Scholar), while increasing the flux of O2·¯ increases oxidation mediated by peroxynitrite (9Miles A.M. Bohle D.S. Glassbrenner P.A. Hansert B. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 40-47Google Scholar). On the other hand, oxidation mediated by peroxynitrite is quenched by excess formation of either NO or O2·¯ (9Miles A.M. Bohle D.S. Glassbrenner P.A. Hansert B. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 40-47Google Scholar). We have explored the oxidative and nitrosative chemistry resulting from the interaction of NO and O2·¯with thiols and demonstrate that there is a balance between fluxes of NO and O2·¯ with respect to oxidative and nitrosative products of glutathione. Glutathione (GSH), hypoxanthine (HX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DETAPAC) were purchased from Sigma. Stock solutions were prepared as follows: 50 mM HX was made in 0.08 mM NaOH, 10 mM DETAPAC in milliQ water, and 10 mM GSH in milliQ water. These stock solutions were diluted in PBS (pH 7.4) to the reported final concentration. XO was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. DEA/NO was a generous gift from Dr. Joseph Saavedra. Stock solution of DEA/NO were prepared as described previously (10Maragos C.M. Morley D. Wink D.A. Dunams T.M. Saavedra J.E. Hoffman A. Bove A.A. Isaac L. Hrabie J.A. Keefer L.K. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 3242-3247Google Scholar), and stock concentrations were determined by UV absorption at 250 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 8000 M−1 cm−1. A solution containing 0.5 mM HX and 50 μM DETAPAC in PBS was prepared and referred to as the HX solution. Typically, GSH or DAN was added to the solutions, followed by catalase and/or SOD, and when appropriate, XO was followed by DEA/NO. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. At the end of this time DEA/NO was completely decomposed and 50 μM allopurinol was added to inhibit the activity of XO. The solutions were then analyzed as described below. Under these assay conditions, 1 milliunit/ml XO produced a flux of O2·¯ and H2O2 of approximately 1 nmol/min each as described previously (9Miles A.M. Bohle D.S. Glassbrenner P.A. Hansert B. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 40-47Google Scholar). The rate of the decomposition of DEA/NO is typically determined by the loss of its characteristic absorbance at 250 nm. However, the HX solution strongly absorbs in this region and does not allow an accurate determination of the kinetics of decomposition. We have recently described a method used to determine the amount of NO released from an NO donor, which involves monitoring at 500 nm where HX solution does not absorb (11Nims R.W. Darbyshire J.F. Saavedra J.E. Christodoulou D. Hanbauer I. Cox G.W. Grisham M.B. Laval J. Cook J.A. Krishna M.C. Wink D.A. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1995; 7: 48-54Google Scholar). In a solution containing 0.5 mM HX and 50 μM DETAPAC, 0.5 g/100 ml of sulfanilamide and 0.03 g of N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NEDD)/100 ml of PBS was dissolved as reported previously (11Nims R.W. Darbyshire J.F. Saavedra J.E. Christodoulou D. Hanbauer I. Cox G.W. Grisham M.B. Laval J. Cook J.A. Krishna M.C. Wink D.A. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1995; 7: 48-54Google Scholar). Monitoring the appearance of the characteristic azo dye band at 500 nm, the rate constant for decay of DEA/NO was determined by a plot of ln(Abs − Absinf) versus time. Since the absorbance requires 2 molecules of NO for every one of azo dye formed, this rate was multiplied by two to get the rate of NO release under these conditions. GSNO was detected using the fluorescence method described by Cook et al. (12Cook J.A. Kim S.-M. Teaug D. Krishna M.C. Pacelli R. Mitchell J.B. Nims R.W. Christodoulou D. Miles A.M. Grisham M.B. Wink D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 238: 150-158Google Scholar). 200 μl of the sample solution was placed in a 2-ml solution containing 500 μM DAN and 100 μM mercuric chloride in PBS. The samples were allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min and then read on a Perkin-Elmer fluorometer LS50B with excitation at 375 nm and emission at 450 nm. To standardize the fluorescence reading from naphthaltriazole (NAT) with S-nitrosothiol, known amounts of GSNO (0-10 μM) were treated in the identical manner described above. A standard curve was generated correlating [GSNO] with fluorescence. GSNO concentrations from the experiments were extrapolated from standard curve. 1 μl of the sample of the incubation mixture was taken and 145 μl of 0.6% sulfosalicylic acid and 10 mM N-butylmaleimide. To this, 34 μl of borate (200 mM) was added to adjust the pH to 8.5. The solution was allowed to stand for 5 min, at which time 20 μl of 1 mM 7-methoxycoumarin-3-carboxylic acid, succimidyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene; OR) was added, and the solution was incubated for 15 min. 25 μl of the sample was injected onto a Millipore HPLC system with a NOvapac™ C-18 (3.9 × 150 mm) column (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). A gradient was run with buffer A containing 5% acetonitrile, 34 mM sodium perchlorate, 0.25% glacial acetic acid, and buffer B containing 80% acetonitrile, 34 mM sodium perchlorate, 0.25% glacial acetic acid. Fluorescence was determined by excitation at 345 and emission at 410 nm. The production of NO via the spontaneous decomposition of DEA/NO at 37°C in the presence or absence of different fluxes of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide was determined electrochemically using an electrode specific for NO (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). DEA/NO was introduced into a thermostatted cell containing a 2.5-ml reaction volume to a final concentration of 20 and 50 μM in a solution containing 50 μM DETAPAC, 500 μM HX, and when appropriate, 10 milliunits/ml XO in PBS (pH 7.4) ± SOD (0.1 mg/ml). The current obtained was monitored as a function of time, and the electrode was standardized using acidified NaNO2. In the presence of 0.2 mM GSH in PBS, 20 and 50 μM DEA/NO yielded GSNO (Fig. 1, A and B). When HX/XO was added with increasing activity, a marked decrease in the formation of GSNO was observed: less than 0.2 μM GSNO was formed at 5 and 10 nmol/min XO activity when the concentrations of DEA/NO were 20 and 50 μM, respectively (Fig. 1). However, nitrosation of GSH surprisingly increased as XO activity was increased to 100 milliunits/ml (Fig. 1, A and B), a process unaffected by 20 μM catalase. The lack of effect of catalase suggests that O2·¯ and not hydrogen peroxide attenuates nitrosation. Such results lessen the concerns of oxygen depletion by xanthine oxidase, since catalase will adequately reoxygenate the solution by converting hydrogen peroxide to oxygen. Next, N-nitrosation was examined as a function of increasing XO activity. A solution of 0.5 mM DAN and 20-50 μM DEA/NO in PBS results in the formation of NAT. Unlike the formation of GSNO, increasing XO activity had little effect on nitrosation until XO activity was 5-10 milliunits, at which point the yield of NAT was dramatically reduced (Fig. 2, A and B). Analogously to the formation of GSNO, nitrosation of DAN increased as the flux of O2·¯ and H2O2 was increased to 100 nmol/min each, though not to the same extent as that observed prior to addition of XO (Fig. 2, A and B). Increasing amounts of SOD, and not catalase, increased the nitrosation of GSH resulting from 50 μM DEA/NO in the presence of 20 milliunits of XO (Fig. 3A)., suggesting that O2·¯ and not hydrogen peroxide may attenuate nitrosation. Nitrosation of DAN was inversely proportional to the flux of O2·¯ in this case as well (Fig. 3B). Since SOD would not affect the rate of oxygen consumption by XO but the availability of O2·¯, reduction of GSNO and NAT formation by XO does not result from oxygen depletion but rather implicates O2·¯ as being the responsible species for reducing nitrosation. Peroxynitrite can oxidize GSH to GSSG. The nearly diffusion controlled reaction between NO and O2·¯ to form peroxynitrite (13Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Google Scholar) suggests this reaction could affect the redox status of intracellular and extracellular thiols. GSH can be oxidized in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (3Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Google Scholar); therefore, catalase was present in these experiments to prevent this side reaction, since the nitrosation of GSH was not effected by the presence of catalase. When 20 or 50 μM DEA/NO was exposed to a solution of HX containing 0.2 mM GSH, variation of XO activity increased formation of GSSG (Fig. 4). The levels of GSH decreased in both cases. An electrode sensitive for NO was used to determine the role of this diatomic molecule in the reactions described above. 50 μM DEA/NO was introduced to an aqueous solution as described under “Materials and Methods.” The concentration of NO initially rose to ∼6 μM and then fell to near zero (Fig. 5). This result is consistent with NO being released by DEA/NO, followed by consumption via the auto-oxidation reaction. When 10 milliunits of XO were present, NO was undetectable by this method. When 0.1 mg/ml SOD was present with 50 μM DEA/NO and 10 milliunits of XO, NO was detected, suggesting that O2·¯ was responsible for the decrease in NO released from DEA/NO. The formation of reactive intermediates derived from oxygen and NO has been invoked in mechanisms for the degradation of biomacromolecules, with attendant pathophysiological consequences. The near diffusion-controlled reaction between NO and O2·¯to form peroxynitrite (13Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Google Scholar) has suggested that this RNOS may be central in the toxic and regulatory mechanisms of NO and oxygen radicals (14Pryor W.A. Squadrito G.L. Am. J.

One class of reaction products of NO is the S-nitrosothiols, which are formed in vivo and which have been suggested to regulate a variety of physiological functions (7Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Google Scholar, 16Ignarro L.J. Edwards J.C. Gruetter D.Y. Barry B.K. Gruetter C.A. FEBS Lett. 1980; 110: 275-278Google Scholar).

Conversely, S-nitrosation of some proteins inhibits key enzymes (19Laval F. Wink D.A. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 443-447Google Scholar, 20Mohr S. Stamler J.S. Brune B.

Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 2125-2129Google Scholar). Furthermore, NO via RNOS reacts with metallothionein to form an S-nitrosothiol (21Kroncke K.-D. Fechsel K. Schmidt T. Zenke F.T. Dasting I. Wesener J.R. Bettermann H. Breunig K.D. Kolb-Bachofen V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1105-1110Google Scholar), which either represents a detoxification pathway (23Schwarz M.A. Lazo J.S.

Toxicol. 1996; 10: 326-332Google Scholar). In an attempt to examine the mechanisms by which such diverse actions are mediated, we have begun to examine the chemistry resulting from the interaction of NO and O2·¯ with respect to nitrosation and oxidation (8Miles A.M. Gibson M. Krishna M. Cook J.C. Pacelli R. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. Free Radical Res. 1995; 233: 379-390Google Scholar, 9Miles A.M. Bohle D.S. Glassbrenner P.A. Hansert B. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 40-47Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that the nitrosation of DAN was suppressed by the presence of O2·¯(8Miles A.M. Gibson M. Krishna M. Cook J.C. Pacelli R. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. Free Radical Res. 1995; 233: 379-390Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, increasing concentrations of O2·¯ dramatically reduced the nitrosation of both GSH and DAN. As seen in Fig. 3, SOD reversed this inhibition, suggesting that the reduction in nitrosation is due to the presence of O2·¯. Since NO or resultant intermediates from NO donor complexes do not inhibit the activity of XO (25Wink D.A. Cook J. Pacelli R. DeGraff W. Gamson J. Liebmann J. Krishna M. Mitchell J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 241-248Google Scholar), this inhibition of nitrosation by O2·¯ can be explained by the following mechanism. In the absence of XO, nitrosation is mediated by intermediates formed in the NO/O2 reaction (i.e. N2O3) (Equations 1–3). 4NO + O2 → 2N2O3(Eq. 1) N2O3+GSH →GSNO + HNO2(Eq. 2) N2O3+DAN→NAT+ HNO2(Eq. 3) As superoxide concentration increases, NO reacts with it at nearly diffusion control to form ONOO− (Equation 4), which in turn can isomerize to nitrate upon protonation (Equation 5). NO + O2·¯→ONOO−(Eq. 4) H+ +ONOO− ⇔ HOONO(Eq. 5) HONOO → HNO3(Eq. 6) This diversion of NO from the RNOS in the auto-oxidation reaction (Equation 1) may explain the inhibition of nitrosation, since ONOO− itself is not a nitrosating agent (8Miles A.M. Gibson M. Krishna M. Cook J.C. Pacelli R. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. Free Radical Res. 1995; 233: 379-390Google Scholar, 26Wink D.A. Darbyshire J.F. Nims R.W. Saveedra J.E. Ford P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 23-27Google Scholar). The relative fluxes of NO and O2·¯ are an important aspect of the foregoing chemical reactions. As described above, maximal oxidation and minimal nitrosation occurred when the activity of XO was 5-20 milliunits. Since the rate of formation of NO from DEA/NO was 5 × 10−3 s−1, the flux of NO generated by 20 and 50 μM DEA/NO would be predicted to be initially approximately 10 and 25 μM per min. This suggests that the maximal oxidation and minimal nitrosation occurs when the flux of NO and O2·¯ were nearly equivalent. These results are consistent with our previous finding that maximal oxidation of dihydrorhodamine occurred when the rate of formation of O2·¯ was nearly equivalent to that of NO (9Miles A.M. Bohle D.S. Glassbrenner P.A. Hansert B. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 40-47Google Scholar). The effects of XO on nitrosation of GSH and DAN in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3 were distinctly different, suggesting a difference in the effects on these two substrates of increasing the flux of O2·¯. As XO increased from 1 to 10 milliunits, the formation of GSNO decreased, yet nitrosation of DAN did not decrease with increasing XO until XO activity was 5-10 milliunits. One reason for this discrepancy is the formation of ONOO−, which reacts sequentially with another 2 mol of NO to form N2O3, via the intermediate formation of NO2 (Equations 7 and 8) (27Koppenol W.H. Moreno J.J. Pryor W.A. Ischiropoulus H. Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 834-842Google Scholar, 28Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Google Scholar), nitrosating DAN or GSH (Equations 1 and 2). HOONO + NO → NO2 + NO2−(Eq. 7) NO2+ NO → N2O3(Eq. 8) Radi et al. showed that GSH reacts with OONO−, the chemical species thought to be responsible for oxidation and nitration chemistry (3Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Google Scholar). ONOO− + GSH → 1/2 GSSG(Eq. 9) The rate constant for ONOO− ion reacting with cysteine at pH 7.4 is 5900 M−1 s−1. Since cysteine reacts with ONOO−, the most likely explanation for the difference between N-nitrosation and S-nitrosation is that GSH intercepts ONOO− prior to protonation (Equation 9), thereby preventing the formation of NO2 and N2O3 via Equations 7 and 8. However, in the case of DAN, the nitrosation reaction switches from the intermediate formed from the NO/O2 reaction (Equation 1) to those formed through the reaction with ONOO− (7Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Google Scholar, 8Miles A.M. Gibson M. Krishna M. Cook J.C. Pacelli R. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. Free Radical Res. 1995; 233: 379-390Google Scholar) under lower activity of XO (1-5 milliunits). Therefore, no net change in nitrosation should occur until the flux of NO and O2·¯is one to one, at which point not enough NO is available to react with ONOO− to form a nitrosating agent before ONOO− reacts with thiols. These data suggest that nitrosative and oxidative stresses are in a delicate balance, which depends on the relative fluxes of NO and O2·¯. At a 1:1 ratio of formation of these radicals, the formation of OONO− is favored, which then results in maximal metal free oxidation and hydroxylation (9Miles A.M. Bohle D.S. Glassbrenner P.A. Hansert B. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 40-47Google Scholar). Nitrosation occurs when the fluxes of NO and O2·¯ are not balanced. These competing processes suggest a mechanism whereby nitrosative and oxidative stresses may be created, with effects in vivo. The formation of nitrosylated thiols versus disulfide adducts could be important in the regulation of gene transcription as well as the modulation of ion channels (7Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Google Scholar). Furthermore, GSH may be critical in attenuating oxidative and nitrosative stresses mediated by RNOS. Formation of O2·¯ and subsequent conversion of NO to ONOO− in the presence of GSH may in fact be a detoxification reaction, since GSH scavenges ONOO− anion prior to the formation of the potent oxidant HOONO. Such a mechanism would prevent the formation of both N2O3 and oxidation mediated by ONOO−. Finally, SOD may attenuate nitrosation and oxidation reactions, since this enzyme reversed the inhibition of nitrosation observed at activities of XO (Fig. 3). One of the intriguing aspects of this work is that the fluxes of NO in these experiments are as low as 1-5 μM, yet can bring about either nitrosative or oxidative chemistry. In Fig. 5, the 50 μM DEA/NO generated less than 6 μM NO for about 30 min. The presence of O2·¯ vitally eliminated the detection of NO (Fig. 5). This result suggests that concentrations of NO could be in the nanomolar range, at which point nitrosation and oxidation by RNOS can occur. Although the production of RNOS is well controlled in vivo, their production could be dysregulated at sites near a cellular or organellar source of O2·¯ in vivo. Superoxide would not be expected to migrate far from its source, while NO can migrate over many cell lengths (29Lancaster J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8137-8141Google Scholar). When NO enters such a site of superoxide formation, we hypothesize that a gradient of concentrations would be established, with attendant high fluxes of nitrosation. At similar fluxes, ONOO− could be formed and react chemically. Unlike O2·¯, ONOO− can migrate and then either be consumed by intracellular thiols such as GSH or react with NO or superoxide to form NO2 (Scheme 1). Additionally, extracellular SOD bound to the endothelium may be critical in attenuating O2·¯ in the extracellular space. Our data suggest that SOD may also modulate nitrosation, thereby attenuating oxidative and nitrosative stresses."

The pH-dependent component was relatively insensitive to inhibition by 4, 4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid and highly saturable (Km or Ki = 2 to 4 microM) in the case of folic acid, folate coenzymes, and 4-aminofolate analogues as permeants or inhibitors. The non-pH-dependent component was highly sensitive to 4, 4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid and poorly and variably saturable (Km or Ki = 20 to >2000 microM) with respect to these folate compounds. Only the pH-dependent transport component was developmentally regulated, showing much higher maximum capacity for l,L-5-CH3-H4folate influx in mature absorptive rather than proliferative crypt cells. The increase in pH-dependent influx during maturation was associated with an increase in RFC-1 gene expression in the form of a 2.5-kilobase RNA transcript and 58-kDa brush-border membrane protein detected by folate-based affinity labeling and with anti-mouse RFC-1 peptide antibodies. The size of this protein was the same as that encoded by RFC-1 mRNA. The treatment of mature absorptive cells with either the affinity label or the anti-RFC-1 peptide antibodies inhibited influx of l, L-[3H]-5-CH3-H4folate in a concentration-dependent manner. These results strongly suggest that pH-dependent folate absorption in this tissue is regulated by RFC-1 gene expression."

Using these templates, we examined the effects of yeast CTD kinase I or CTD kinase inhibitors on transcription and CTD phosphorylation in HeLa nuclear extracts. Our results showed that polymerase II elongation efficiency and CTD phosphorylation are greatly reduced by CTD kinase inhibitors, whereas both are greatly increased by CTD kinase I; in contrast, transcription initiation is much less affected. These results demonstrate that CTD kinase I modulates the elongation efficiency of RNA polymerase II and are consistent with the idea that one function of CTD phosphorylation is to promote effective production of long transcripts by stimulating the elongation efficiency of RNA polymerase II."

https://openalex.org/W1998449586,"The role of ATP hydrolysis in RecA protein-mediated DNA strand exchange reactions remains controversial.

Here, we test key predictions of the RecA redistribution idea. When ATP is hydrolyzed, DNA strand exchange is accompanied by a RecA exchange reaction, between free and bound RecA protomers in the interior of RecA filaments, that meets a central prediction of the model. The RecA protomer exchange is not required for, and does not occur during, the “search for homology” in which the single-stranded DNA within a RecA-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament is homologously aligned with the duplex DNA. Instead, the RecA exchange is triggered by the completion of strand exchange (a strand switch to generate a hybrid DNA product) in any given segment of the filament. In effect, formation of hybrid DNA leads to a change in filament conformation to one with properties approximating those of RecA filaments bound to double-stranded DNA. Addition of the RecA K72R mutant protein to a reaction with the wild type protein leads to the formation of mixed filaments and a poisoning of the DNA strand exchange reaction. Under some conditions, a facile RecA protomer exchange is observed, and significant ATP is hydrolyzed, even though DNA strand exchange is entirely blocked by the mutant protein. A redistribution of RecA protomers coupled to ATP hydrolysis is not sufficient in itself to explain how ATP hydrolysis facilitates DNA strand exchange. A RecA protomer exchange may nevertheless play an important role in the DNA strand exchange process. The role of ATP hydrolysis in RecA protein-mediated DNA strand exchange reactions remains controversial. Competing models suggest that ATP hydrolysis is coupled either to a simple redistribution of RecA monomers within a filament to repair filament discontinuities, or more directly to rotation of the DNA substrates to drive branch movement unidirectionally.

INTRODUCTIONRecA protein from Escherichia coli (352 amino acid residues; Mr 37,842) plays a central role in the processes of recombinational DNA repair, homologous recombination, induction of the SOS response to DNA damage, and the partitioning of chromosomes at cell division (1Clark A.J.

Biery M.C. Smith D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2525-2537Google Scholar). RecA is an ancient protein present in all bacteria, with structural and functional homologues in eukaryotes ranging from yeast to humans (4Kowalczykowski S.C. Eggleston A.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 991-1043Google Scholar, 9Ogawa T. Yu X. Shinohara A. Egelman E.H. Science. 1993; 259: 1896-1899Google Scholar, 10Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Google Scholar).In vitro, RecA protein promotes a set of DNA strand exchange reactions that mimic its presumed roles in vivo. In a typical DNA strand exchange reaction (Fig. 1), RecA protein first forms a nucleoprotein filament on circular ssDNA 1The abbreviations used are: sssingle-strandeddsdouble-strandedRecAthe wild type RecA proteinOAcacetate ionbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s)ATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphateSSBthe single-stranded DNA binding protein of E. coliwtwild type. with a stoichiometry of one RecA monomer per three nucleotides. The ssDNA within the filament is then paired with a linear duplex DNA and aligns homologous sequences between these two DNAs. A strand switch then occurs within the filament, producing a nascent region of hybrid DNA. Subsequently, the hybrid DNA is extended unidirectionally, 5′ to 3′ relative to the ssDNA in the original filament, until strand exchange is completed. At the end of the reaction, RecA protein remains bound to the hybrid duplex product DNA (11Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1337-1343Google Scholar, 12Ullsperger C.J. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10859-10866Google Scholar). The fact that RecA protein is bound to ssDNA at the onset of DNA strand exchange and dsDNA at the end is of central importance in the present study.RecA protein is a DNA-dependent ATPase, with a monomer kcat of 30 min−1 when bound to ssDNA (dATP is hydrolyzed at rates about 20% higher). ATP is hydrolyzed uniformly throughout the nucleoprotein filament (13Brenner S.L. Mitchell R.S. Morrical S.W. Neuendorf S.K. Schutte B.C. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4011-4016Google Scholar). When a homologous duplex DNA is added to the reaction, the kcat drops abruptly to about 20 min−1 and remains at that level throughout the ensuing DNA strand exchange reaction (14Schutte B.C. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5616-5625Google Scholar). A significant DNA strand exchange reaction, often producing a thousand base pairs or more of hybrid DNA, can occur within RecA filaments that are not hydrolyzing ATP (15Menetski J.P. Bear D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 21-25Google Scholar, 16Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1292-1297Google Scholar, 17Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3478-3482Google Scholar, 18Shan Q. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Google Scholar). This demonstrates that the filament itself is set up to incorporate up to three DNA strands and promote a DNA strand switch using nothing more than the binding energy available inside the filament groove. However, when ATP is not hydrolyzed, DNA strand exchange typically halts well before the reaction reaches completion. ATP hydrolysis is coupled in some manner to the final stage of DNA strand exchange (19Bedale W.A. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5725-5732Google Scholar), conferring on the reaction unidirectionality and the capacity to bypass barriers and accommodate 4 DNA strands (18Shan Q. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Google Scholar, 19Bedale W.A. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5725-5732Google Scholar, 20Kim J.-I. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol.

The rate of ATP hydrolysis during DNA strand exchange is similar to that observed in RecA filaments bound directly to dsDNA (5Roca A.I. Cox M.M. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 415-456Google Scholar, 6Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Google Scholar). The actual molecular function of this ATP hydrolysis has been controversial, with many proposals focusing on RecA filament assembly and disassembly processes.RecA nucleoprotein filaments rapidly assemble on ssDNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction (24Register III, J.C. Griffith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12308-12312Google Scholar) at a rate in excess of 1000 RecA monomers min−1 filament−1. RecA protein does not readily bind to dsDNA at neutral pH due to a very slow nucleation step (25Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1326-1336Google Scholar, 26Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 479-493Google Scholar). RecA filaments also disassemble in an end-dependent manner from the filament end opposite to that at which assembly occurs (27Lindsley J.E. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 695-711Google Scholar, 28Lindsley J.E. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9043-9054Google Scholar, 29Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Google Scholar). On double-stranded DNA, this process is highly pH-dependent, being absent at pH 6.0 and occurring at the maximal rate (about 3 monomers s−1) above pH 8.0 (27Lindsley J.E. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 695-711Google Scholar). A similar end-dependent disassembly of RecA filaments has recently been observed and characterized on ssDNA, occurring from the filament end nearest the 5′ end of a linear ssDNA molecule (29Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Google Scholar). The RecA filaments are replaced by SSB protein as disassembly proceeds. This disassembly process is suppressed when pH is lowered to about 6, when dATP replaces ATP, or when RecO and RecR proteins are included (29Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Google Scholar).In the filament interior, RecA protein undergoes little exchange with RecA protein in the free pool when the filament is formed on ssDNA, with no protomer exchange at all observed in the presence of dATP (30Neuendorf S.K. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8276-8282Google Scholar, 31Shan Q. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 756-774Google Scholar). However, on dsDNA, an exchange between RecA monomers in the free and bound forms in the filament interior has been documented. This exchange process is independent of the number of dsDNA ends, the length of dsDNA, and reaction pH (31Shan Q. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 756-774Google Scholar). In effect, a change occurs when a second complementary DNA strand is present within the RecA filament, producing a filament that is more dynamic with respect to exchange between free and bound forms.The characterization of the RecA protomer exchange reactions has made extensive use of a RecA mutant protein, RecA K72R, in which the lysine to arginine substitution occurs within a highly conserved ATP binding motif (16Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1292-1297Google Scholar, 18Shan Q. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Google Scholar). This mutant protein binds but does not hydrolyze ATP or dATP. In the presence of dATP, RecA K72R promotes a limited degree of DNA strand exchange. This mutant protein also forms mixed filaments with wild type RecA on either ssDNA or dsDNA (31Shan Q. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 756-774Google Scholar) and has been proven to be a very useful tool for exploring the properties of RecA nucleoprotein filaments (16Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1292-1297Google Scholar, 18Shan Q. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Google Scholar, 31Shan Q. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 756-774Google Scholar).The stability of RecA protein filaments is a crucial parameter in evaluating models for the roles of ATP hydrolysis in the final stages of DNA strand exchange. Two models are broadly consistent with observations published to date. Both explain the limited extent of DNA strand exchange observed under most conditions when ATP is not hydrolyzed. The RecA monomer redistribution model proposed by Kowalczykowski and co-workers (15Menetski J.P. Bear D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 21-25Google Scholar, 16Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1292-1297Google Scholar, 17Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3478-3482Google Scholar) suggests that DNA strand exchange without ATP hydrolysis is limited by discontinuities in the RecA filaments, with ATP hydrolysis coupled only to a redistribution of RecA monomers to repair the discontinuities. The alternative facilitated DNA rotation models suggest that any discontinuities involve the DNA pairing intermediate rather than the RecA filaments. ATP hydrolysis is instead directly coupled to coordinated rotation of the two DNA substrates (2Cox M.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 217-222Google Scholar, 18Shan Q. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Google Scholar, 19Bedale W.A. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5725-5732Google Scholar, 32Burnett B. Rao B.J. Jwang B. Reddy G. Radding C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 540-554Google Scholar). Efficient DNA strand exchange takes place under conditions in which RecA protein remains quantitatively bound to the hybrid DNA product (12Ullsperger C.J. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10859-10866Google Scholar), showing that a net disassembly of the RecA filament is not a mechanistic requirement. However, a redistribution of RecA monomers within the filament remains a formal possibility. In the continuing discussion, we define filament dynamics in terms of the association and/or dissociation of RecA protomers, acknowledging that the actual species that bind or dissociate (monomers, dimers, other?) have not been defined (5Roca A.I. Cox M.M. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 415-456Google Scholar, 33Brenner S.L. Zlotnick A. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 959-972Google Scholar, 34Brenner S.L. Zlotnick A. Stafford W.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 949-964Google Scholar).The various models make a number of predictions with respect to RecA filament dynamics. If the effects of ATP on DNA strand exchange reactions are to be explained solely by redistribution of RecA monomers within the filaments, then an exchange of RecA monomers between free and bound forms must occur during DNA strand exchange. Further, the RecA monomer exchange must be sufficient in itself to overcome all limitations observed in the absence of ATP hydrolysis and permit a complete DNA strand exchange to occur. These fundamental requirements of the RecA redistribution model have never been addressed experimentally.As already noted, RecA filaments begin DNA strand exchange bound to ssDNA and end the reaction bound to dsDNA. Since there is a documented RecA protomer exchange in filaments formed on dsDNA but not those formed on ssDNA (31Shan Q. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 756-774Google Scholar), one might expect that the RecA protomer exchange required by the RecA redistribution model might be activated as DNA strand exchange took place. The present experiments were carried out to test this prediction and also to determine whether a protomer exchange, if observed, might adequately explain the effects of ATP hydrolysis on DNA strand exchange.DISCUSSIONThere are three major conclusions to this study. First, an exchange between free and bound forms of RecA protein occurs during DNA strand exchange. Second, the RecA exchange does not occur during or in any way facilitate the “search for homology” that proceeds during the earliest stages of DNA strand exchange. Instead, the RecA exchange depends upon the presence of homologous sequences in the duplex DNA substrate and is triggered slowly over the time course of strand exchange, suggesting it is somehow connected to the progressive formation of the hybrid DNA product. Third, the RecA exchange reaction, in and of itself, is insufficient to overcome the limited extent of DNA strand exchange observed when ATP is not hydrolyzed.The second conclusion should not be surprising, even though a RecA protomer exchange is sometimes postulated to play a role in the search for homology (e.g. Ref. 42Kuzminov A. Recombinational Repair of DNA Damage. R. G. Landes Co., Georgetown, TX1996: 210Google Scholar). DNA pairing to form joint molecules clearly occurs efficiently in the absence of any ATP hydrolysis (15Menetski J.P. Bear D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 21-25Google Scholar, 16Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1292-1297Google Scholar, 17Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3478-3482Google Scholar, 18Shan Q. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Google Scholar). These published results demonstrate that the RecA filament can align a ssDNA with a homologous dsDNA using only the binding energy available within the filament groove.The first and third conclusions are most relevant to an improved understanding of the role of ATP hydrolysis in the later stages of DNA strand exchange. The RecA redistribution hypothesis (15Menetski J.P. Bear D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 21-25Google Scholar–17Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3478-3482Google Scholar) is predicated on the fact that RecA protein filaments, even those formed with the mutant RecA K72R, can promote DNA strand exchange without ATP hydrolysis. Strand exchange in these filaments would be limited only by discontinuities in the filaments. The only postulated role of ATP hydrolysis is to redistribute RecA monomers to eliminate filament discontinuities (15Menetski J.P. Bear D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 21-25Google Scholar, 16Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1292-1297Google Scholar, 17Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3478-3482Google Scholar). The key testable predictions of this hypothesis are that the postulated filament discontinuities exist, that ATP hydrolysis facilitates a RecA protomer exchange between free and bound forms as necessary to redistribute the RecA, and that this exchange is sufficient to explain all of the observed effects of ATP hydrolysis on DNA strand exchange (e.g. unidirectionality and the bypass of heterologous DNA insertions).The results of the present study provide the first demonstration that the necessary RecA protomer exchange actually occurs. The time course of the exchange reactions, especially when examined in the light of results of an earlier study (31Shan Q. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 756-774Google Scholar), strongly suggest that RecA protomer exchange is triggered by the formation of hybrid dsDNA within the filaments as strand exchange proceeds. The simplest interpretation of the results is that a change in filament state is achieved over the course of DNA strand exchange to one with RecA protomer exchange properties previously assigned to RecA complexes bound to dsDNA (31Shan Q. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 756-774Google Scholar), even though the initial complex bound to ssDNA is refractory to exchange.However, the RecA protomer exchange we observe is not sufficient to explain the effects of ATP hydrolysis on DNA strand exchange. The RecA exchange occurs under almost all conditions, and can produce both increases and decreases in the content of the mutant K72R RecA protein in mixed filaments. The generation of completely exchanged hybrid DNA products of strand exchange can be decreased or eliminated when the mixed filaments contain relatively modest amounts of the mutant protein, even though a RecA exchange continues. The decline in the completion of the DNA strand exchange reaction is especially evident when the dsDNA substrate contains a 52 bp heterologous insertion that must be bypassed. Here, the reaction is halted when the mutant content of the filaments reaches 15% (Fig. 2), even though filaments with this mutant content exhibit a facile RecA exchange process (Fig. 8).The postulated effects of RecA filament discontinuities and the bypass of heterologous DNA insertions during DNA strand exchange have been addressed in other studies. We have shown elsewhere that the addition of excess RecA K72R mutant protein to a strand exchange reaction, sufficient to fill in any filament discontinuities that might exist, does not relieve the barrier to completion of DNA strand exchange by the mutant protein once the initial joint molecules have been formed (18Shan Q. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Google Scholar). This observation tends to call into question the idea that the reactions carried out in the absence of ATP hydrolysis are limited only by filament discontinuities. There is, in fact, no evidence that the postulated discontinuities in either the RecA K72R filaments or wild type RecA filaments formed in the presence of ATPγS (15Menetski J.P. Bear D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 21-25Google Scholar, 16Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1292-1297Google Scholar, 17Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3478-3482Google Scholar) actually exist, much less play a role in the observed limitations to strand exchange. In another recent study, 3K. J. MacFarland and M. M. Cox, manuscript submitted for publication. we also demonstrate that a RecA protomer exchange process coupled to ATP hydrolysis cannot explain the bypass of heterologous DNA insertions.The results of these and other studies are better accommodated by the formation of a discontinuous DNA pairing intermediate (as opposed to the formation of discontinuous filaments), which must be resolved by a DNA rotation process coupled to ATP hydrolysis (2Cox M.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 217-222Google Scholar, 18Shan Q. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Google Scholar–22Jain S.K. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20653-20661Google Scholar). To introduce this alternative, we must point out another apparent experimental paradox evident in this and earlier studies. Strand exchange slowly converts a filament on ssDNA, which does not undergo a RecA protomer exchange process, to a filament on dsDNA which does undergo protomer exchange. The extent of the change is consistent with an altered state spanning the entire length of the filament or most of it, even when there is enough mutant protein in the filament to block the completion of strand exchange. In earlier work, rapid changes in rates of ATP hydrolysis (<2 min) were noted upon the addition of homologous dsDNA, the extent of which depended on the length of homology in the duplex DNA substrate (14Schutte B.C. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5616-5625Google Scholar). This indicated that homologous interactions between the DNA substrates occurred over their entire length at early times, even though DNA strand exchange was not completed until many minutes later. How can homology be sensed all along the duplex DNA substrate by the RecA filament, even when DNA strand exchange is not complete?To explain these and all of the other results in the present and earlier studies, we suggest that a discontinuous DNA pairing intermediate is formed as proposed based on an earlier study (18Shan Q. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Google Scholar) and outlined in Fig. 9. DNA pairing would be facilitated by binding energy in the RecA filament, drawing homologous duplex DNA into the filament even in the absence of ATP hydrolysis as proposed by Kowalczykowski and colleagues (15Menetski J.P. Bear D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 21-25Google Scholar–17Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3478-3482Google Scholar). As the pairing proceeded, drawing additional DNA into the filament would require rotation of the filament and the DNA as shown in Fig. 9 (I). As this process extends the segment of paired DNA drawn into the filament, pairing at other points along the RecA filament becomes intramolecular and more probable. If pairing occurs in any other location, a loop of DNA is trapped topologically on the exterior of the filament between the paired regions. As pairing continues, a number of such loops might be generated. Although pairing is illustrated as though it were initiated at an end, it could in principle be initiated anywhere and generate the same intermediate. The discontinuous intermediate would allow the formation of hybrid DNA at many sites all along the paired DNAs at an early stage of DNA strand exchange. However, in the absence of ATP hydrolysis, the loops would be static, and the extent of stable strand exchange that persists after removal of RecA protein would be defined by the distance between the end of the paired linear duplex and the first loop. The pairing would also occur at either end of the linear dsDNA substrate with equal probability. This would explain the limited extent of DNA strand exchange observed when ATP is not hydrolyzed (15Menetski J.P. Bear D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 21-25Google Scholar–18Shan Q. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Google Scholar, 22Jain S.K. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20653-20661Google Scholar) as well as the lack of unidirectionality (22Jain S.K. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20653-20661Google Scholar).Fig. 9Proposed formation of discontinuous DNA pairing intermediates during RecA protein-mediated DNA strand exchange. I, duplex DNA is drawn into the helical groove of a RecA protein filament formed on ssDNA. The paired region is defined as that between points A and B. Further incorporation of the dsDNA into the filament requires filament and DNA rotation as indicated. As the paired region is extended, additional pairing interactions at any point along the filament are intramolecular. If pairing occurs at the point indicated by the heavy arrow, a loop of DNA outside the filament between point B and the heavy arrow is created as shown in II. Additional pairing interactions (heavy black arrow) may occur to create any number of external loops. Resolution of the loops requires the rotation of the loop DNA about the outside of the filament as shown in III. This will spool DNA into the filament groove at one end of the loop, and out of the groove at the other end. The direction of rotation determines the direction of loop movement along the helix axis. A model for how such DNA rotation might be coupled to ATP hydrolysis has been proposed elsewhere (2Cox M.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 217-222Google Scholar, 18Shan Q. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Google Scholar, 19Bedale W.A. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5725-5732Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)When ATP is hydrolyzed, we propose that the hydrolysis is coupled to rotation of the DNA in the loop, such that it migrates in one direction and is ultimately resolved (2Cox M.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 217-222Google Scholar, 6Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Google Scholar, 19Bedale W.A. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5725-5732Google Scholar). In this process, the loop DNA would be bound to every sixth RecA monomer along the filament in the loop region. The loop DNA would be passed around the outside of the filament, from one set of monomers to the next, coupled to ATP hydrolysis. The rates of DNA branch movement and ATP hydrolysis during DNA strand exchange are related quantitatively in a manner predicted by this facilitated DNA rotation process (19Bedale W.A. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5725-5732Google Scholar).The present results are also readily explained by the model in Fig. 9. The RecA filament is designed to stabilize the hybrid DNA product of strand exchange. As the discontinuous pairing intermediate was formed, a strand switch might occur in all of the paired regions to form regions of hybrid DNA throughout the length of the filament, and triggering a more or less general change in RecA filament state to the form where RecA protomer exchange occurs. If the formation of the discontinuously paired regions occurred slowly over a period of many minutes, the RecA filament transition would follow suit, potentially explaining the slow kinetics of the transition evident in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. In addition, the presence of mutant protein in the filaments could readily poison a facilitated DNA rotation that relied on ATP hydrolysis in all RecA monom"

These findings are reconciled by direct assays using 5,5′-dithiobis-(2nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (Ellman's reagent) that show protein disulfides to be electron acceptors for auxin-stimulated NADH oxidation. In the presence of an external reducing agent such as NADH, cysteine, or dithiothreitol, protein disulfides of the membrane are reduced with a concomitant stoichiometric increase in free thiols. In the absence of an external reducing agent, or in the presence of oxidized glutathione, DTNB-reactive thiols of the plasma membrane are decreased in the presence of auxins. Several auxin-reductant combinations were effective, but the same reductants plus chemically related and growth-inactive auxin analogs were not. A cell surface location of the affected thiols demonstrated with detergents and impermeant thiol reagents suggests that the protein may have a different physiological role than oxidation of NADH. For example, it may carry out some other role more closely related to the function of the auxin hormones in cell enlargement such as protein disulfide-thiol interchange.

An enzyme recently implicated in the degradation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 is inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase (4-phosphatase). The 4-phosphatase was originally characterized as a Mg2+-independent enzyme that catalyzed the hydrolysis of the 4-position phosphate of Ins(3,4)P2 and inositol 1,3,4-triphosphate (11Bansal V.S. Caldwell K.K. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1806-1811Google Scholar). Recently, 4-phosphatase has been shown to preferentially hydrolyze the analogous lipid, PtdIns(3,4)P2, with a first order rate constant 2 orders of magnitude greater than that obtained using the soluble substrates (12Norris F.A. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8716-8720Google Scholar). Antiserum raised against a C-terminal peptide of 4-phosphatase immunoprecipitates >95% of the PtdIns(3,4)P2 phosphatase activity from rat brain supernatant (13Norris F.A. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W.

Sequence analysis of 4-phosphatase indicated the presence of PEST sequences; proline, glutamate/aspartate, serine/threonine rich motifs, that are common features of proteins that are substrates for the calcium-dependent thiol protease, calpain (14Rogers S.

Several proteins important for signal transduction have been shown to be regulated by calpain-mediated proteolysis, including protein phosphotyrosine phosphatase 1B (16Frangioni J.V. Oda A. Smith M.

In this study, we demonstrate that 4-phosphatase is a substrate for calpain and is inactivated by calpain-mediated proteolysis in vitro and in stimulated human platelets. In addition, we show that calpain inhibition suppresses the accumulation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 in thrombin-stimulated human platelets. These results suggest a role for 4-phosphatase in the regulation of intracellular PtdIns(3,4)P2 levels.

Porcine erythrocyte calpain type I and human recombinant calpastatin were purchased from Calbiochem. Calpeptin was purchased from LC Laboratories. [32P]H3PO4 was purchased from ICN Biomedicals. Ins(3,4)P2 and [3H]Ins(3,4)P2 were prepared as described previously (11Bansal V.S. Caldwell K.K. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1806-1811Google Scholar). Six histidine-tagged recombinant human 4-phosphatase was expressed in Escherichia coli using the 6HisTrc vector (Clontech), and recombinant protein was purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). Recombinant six-histidine-tagged 4-phosphatase (100 ng/ml) was incubated with various amounts of type I porcine calpain in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 3 mM CaCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol for 10 min at 37°C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 mM EDTA and 1 μg of calpastatin/ml. Washed platelets were prepared from plasma obtained from healthy donors as described previously (19Baenziger N.L. Majerus P.W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 149-155Google Scholar) with the modifications that the platelet-rich plasma was incubated at 37°C for 20 min with 1 mM acetylsalicylic acid and 10 μM prostaglandin E1 prior to centrifugation. Platelets (109/ml) were stimulated by 1 μM A23187 or 1 unit of thrombin/ml in 15 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 140 mM NaCl, 5.5 mM glucose, and 2.5 mM CaCl2 (platelet aggregation buffer) unless otherwise indicated. Platelets were stirred at 37°C using a aggregometer (Payton). Platelets lysates were prepared by the addition of 0.5 ml of 2% Triton X-100, 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mM EDTA, 10 μg of leupeptin/ml, and 1 mM Pefabloc® to a 0.5-ml suspension of platelets (109/ml). Platelet lysates were assayed for 4-phosphatase activity using [3H]Ins(3,4)P2 as substrate as described previously (11Bansal V.S. Caldwell K.K. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1806-1811Google Scholar). Platelet suspensions were boiled for 4 min in SDS loading buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10%β-mercaptoethanol 0.05% bromphenol blue, 10 mM EDTA, and 10 μg of leupeptin/ml. Samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% powdered milk, 0.05% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with 1:2000 dilution of rabbit antiserum directed against the 4-phosphatase C-terminal peptide in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed with TBS-T and then incubated with 1:4000 diluted anti-rabbit IgG-Horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Corp.) in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then washed with TBS-T and 4-phosphatase was detected by Supersignal™ chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce) and Biomax™ Film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Platelets were labeled by incubating 109 platelets/ml suspended in platelet aggregation buffer without CaCl2 containing 1 mCi 32P04/ml for 1.5 h at 37°C. Platelets were then centrifuged at 4000 × g for 1 min and resuspended at 109 platelets/ml in platelet aggregation buffer. Platelets were stimulated as indicated, and the phospholipids were extracted and deacylated as described previously (19Baenziger N.L. Majerus P.W.

Glycerophosphorylinositols were separated on a Partisil SAX column using flow rate of 1 ml/min and a gradient of 0-1 M ammonium phosphate (pH 3.8) consisting of linear gradient from O to 25% solvent B over 60 min followed by a linear gradient to 100% over 50 min (pump A: water, pump B: 1 M ammonium phosphate). 32P04-labeled glycerophosphorylinositols derivatives were detected using an A-100 radioactive flow detector (Radiomatic). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Lipid phosphate was determined using the method of Ames and Dubin (21Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Google Scholar). The presence of PEST sequences in the predicted amino acid sequence of 4-phosphatase suggested that this enzyme might be a substrate for the calcium-dependent protease, calpain (13Norris F.A. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16128-16133Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, immunoblot analysis of recombinant 4-phosphatase treated with calpain in vitro using anti-4-phosphatase C-terminal peptide antiserum indicates that the enzyme is a substrate for calpain. A proteolytic fragment of 104 kDa is detected using this antiserum, indicating that a calpain cleavage site exists near the 4-phosphatase N terminus. However, this 104-kDa fragment is proteolyzed further to fragments that are not detected by this antiserum, indicating the presence of at least one additional cleavage site near the C-terminal epitope. This proteolysis results in a 75% decrease in the activity of recombinant 4-phosphatase (Fig. 1B). The 25% residual 4-phosphatase activity is resistant to calpain treatment with 500 ng/ml (data not shown). To determine whether 4-phosphatase is a substrate for calpain in vivo, human platelets were stimulated with calcium ionophore A23187, an agonist known to activate platelet calpain in the presence of extracellular calcium (16Frangioni J.V. Oda A. Smith M. Salzman E.W. Neel B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4843-4856Google Scholar, 17Banno Y. Nakashima S. Hachiya T. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4318-4324Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, immunoblot analysis of lysates prepared from unstirred platelets stimulated with 1 μM A23187 using anti-4-phosphatase C-terminal peptide antiserum indicates that the full-length 105-kDa 4-phosphatase is rapidly (half-life of 2 min) and completely proteolyzed in the presence extracellular calcium with the generation of a 39-kDa immunoblotting proteolytic fragment (lanes 1-5). In addition, the presence of EDTA (lane 6) or preincubation of platelets with the cell-permeant calpain inhibitor, calpeptin (lane 7), blocks A23187-stimulated proteolysis of 4-phosphatase (Fig. 2A). This proteolysis of 4-phosphatase correlates with a 75% decrease in the observed enzyme activity in platelet lysates which was prevented by the presence of EDTA or preincubation with calpeptin (Fig. 2B). The remaining 25% of platelet 4-phosphatase activity was not inactivated by 30-min ionophore stimulation (data not shown). The amount of enzyme activity that is resistant to calpain-mediated proteolysis in platelets is similar to that observed when 4-phosphatase is treated with calpain in vitro. Stimulation of platelets with the physiological agonist, thrombin, is also known to activate platelet calpain via a mechanism that requires both extracellular calcium (17Banno Y. Nakashima S. Hachiya T. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4318-4324Google Scholar) and platelet aggregation (22Fox J.E.B. Taylor R.G. Taffarel M. Boyles J.K. Goll D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1501-1507Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, immunoblot analysis of lysates prepared from stirred platelets stimulated for 5 min with 1 unit/ml thrombin indicates that the 4-phosphatase is partially proteolyzed in the presence of extracellular calcium resulting in a 39-kDa immunoblotting proteolytic fragment similar to that observed in ionophore-stimulated platelets (lane 2). This proteolysis was blocked by preincubation with calpeptin (lane 3), the presence of RGDS, a tetrapeptide that prevents platelet aggregation (lane 4), or the presence of EDTA (lane 5). Thrombin stimulation resulted in an average decrease of 41% (n = 8, range of 36-51%) in 4-phosphatase activity observed in platelet lysates, and this activity decrease was blocked by the agents that prevent calpain-mediated proteolysis (Fig. 3B). To evaluate the possible role of calpain-mediated inactivation of 4-phosphatase on the levels of PtdIns(3,4)P2 in thrombin-stimulated platelets, the effect of calpain inhibition on the accumulation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 was measured. As shown in Fig. 4, preincubation of platelets with calpeptin prior to thrombin stimulation suppressed the accumulation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 by an average of 36% (n = 2, range of 35-37%). A similar suppression of PtdIns(3,4)P2 levels of approximately 40% has been reported previously for platelets stimulated with thrombin in the absence of extracellular calcium (23Sorisky A. King W.G. Rittenhouse S.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 581-584Google Scholar) or in the presence of RGDS (24Sultan C. Plantavid M. Bachelot C. Grondin P. Breton M. Mauco G. Lévy-Toledano S. Caen J.P. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23554-23557Google Scholar, 25Rittenhouse S.E. Blood. 1996; 88: 4401-4414Google Scholar), two factors known to prevent calpain activation. PtdIns(3,4)P2 accumulation in thrombin-stimulated platelets is biphasic with a rapid (within 20 s) calcium-independent phase and a slow (after 90 s) calcium-dependent phase (23Sorisky A. King W.G.

It has been proposed that the biphasic rise in PtdIns(3,4)P2 levels is a result of a rapid activation of PtdIns 3-kinase followed by a slower calcium/aggregation-dependent inactivation of a PtdIns(3,4)P2 phosphatase that produces the further sustained rise in PtdIns(3,4)P2 (23Sorisky A. King W.G. Rittenhouse S.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 581-584Google Scholar, 25Rittenhouse S.E. Blood. 1996; 88: 4401-4414Google Scholar). The data reported here are consistent with this model and suggest a mechanism involving the inactivation of 4-phosphatase by calpain-mediated proteolysis to produce the calcium/aggregation-dependent accumulation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 in thrombin-stimulated platelets.

Other post-translational modifications essential for the correct subcellular targeting of eNOS have not been described previously. We demonstrate, using [35S]methionine pulse-chase experiments, that native eNOS in adult rat ventricular myocytes is initially translated as a nonpalmitoylated 150-kDa isoform, which is associated with cytosolic and intracellular membrane-enriched fractions. This is subsequently processed to a palmitoylated 135-kDa isoform, which is found only in a sarcolemma-enriched membrane fraction. Forskolin, an agent that elevates intracellular cAMP, rapidly inhibited processing of the 150-kDa isoform to the 135-kDa isoform and transport of eNOS to the sarcolemma, effects paralleled by protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of the larger eNOS isoform. Forskolin also decreased palmitoylation of the 135-kDa isoform, although it did not accelerate depalmitoylation of sarcolemmal eNOS, as determined by pulse-chase experiments with [3H]palmitate. Thus, post-translational processing of a 150-kDa isoform of myocyte eNOS appears to be necessary for intracellular trafficking of the enzyme to sarcolemmal caveolae.

McGraw Hill Inc., New York1995: 1887-1912Google Scholar). Based on this homology, the apo(a) kringles have been classified into two major classes, IV and V. Ten subclasses of kringle IV exhibiting some differences in amino acid composition have been recognized and numbered from 1 to 10 (3Guevara J. Jan A.Y. Knapp R. Tulinsky A. Morrisett J.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 758-770Google Scholar). Of note, except for the domains linking the identical kringle IV-2 repeats, all of the other linkers differ significantly in amino acid sequence and length (4McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W.-J.

Only one copy of kringle V has been reported thus far.Human leukocyte elastase is a neutral serine protease that is stored in the cytoplasmic azurophilic granules of blood neutrophils (5Schmidt W. Havemann K. Hoppe-Seylers Z. Physiol. Chem. 1974; 355: 1077-1082Google Scholar, 6Travis J.R. Baugh R. Giles P.J.D.J. Bowen J. Reilley C.F. Havemann K. Jonoff A.

Upon release from these cells, the enzyme causes the cleavage not only of elastin but also of a broad range of substrates including kringle-containing proteins like plasminogen, where it generates miniplasminogen by cleaving in the interkringle region (8Moroz L.A. Blood. 1981; 58: 97-104Google Scholar). In previous in vitro studies (9Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Google Scholar), we observed that the limited proteolysis of Lp(a) or apo(a) by purified preparations of either human leukocyte or porcine pancreatic elastase caused the cleavage of apo(a) at the Ile3520-Leu3521 bond located in the linker region between kringles IV-4 and IV-5. This cleavage resulted in the generation of two main fragments, F1 and F2, with distinct structural, functional, and metabolic properties. Moreover, pancreatic and leukocyte elastase cleaved the apoB100 component of Lp(a) without apparently compromising the overall structural organization of this lipoprotein particle.Prompted by these findings and to gain a further insight into their potential biological relevance, we explored the effects attending the in vitro incubation of Lp(a) and free apo(a) with polymorphonuclear cells (PMN), freshly isolated from human peripheral blood. The results of these studies, which are the subject of this report, demonstrate that apo(a), whether free or a member of Lp(a), undergoes a time-dependent proteolytic fragmentation that is caused by the action of a PMN-released elastase, which has a specificity for peptide bonds located in the interkringle domains of apo(a), resulting in the formation of fragments of various length. The results also show that following incubation with PMN, Lp(a) particles become smaller as a consequence of the reduction in apo(a) size.DISCUSSIONThe results of the current studies have shown that apo(a), either free or a constitutive component of the parent Lp(a), undergoes cleavage at multiple interkringle sites upon incubation with PMN freshly isolated from human peripheral blood. The involvement of an elastase enzyme in this fragmentation is supported by several lines of evidence: 1) similarity in results between PMN-dependent proteolysis and that caused by a purified human leukocyte elastase preparation; 2) capacity to hydrolyze the synthetic substrate MeO-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-AMC; 3) inhibition of the proteolysis by MeO-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-CH2Cl, a specific elastase inhibitor; 3) no effect on the proteolysis by benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Leu-Phe-CH2Cl, a specific inhibitor of cathepsin G, which is a serine protease abundant in PMN; 4) the nature of the cut sites, which were between two nonpolar amino acids. In a previous paper (9Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Google Scholar), we reported that the limited proteolysis of Lp(a) and apo(a) by a purified preparation of leukocyte elastase resulted in the cleavage of the Ile3520-Leu3521 bond in the linker region between kringle IV-4 and IV-5. This cleavage generated two main fragments, which we previously called F1, representing the NH2-terminal domain, and F2, the COOH-terminal domain. In this study, we now show that under our current experimental conditions, purified leukocyte elastase can also cause peptide bond cleavages at additional interkringle regions of apo(a) and the formation of at least seven fragments, F1 (KIV-1 to KIV-4); F2 (KIV-5 to the protease region); F3 (KIV-5 to KIV-10); F4 (KIV-8 to the protease region); F5 (KIV-8 to KIV-10); F6 (KIV-5 to KIV-7) and F7 (KV to the protease region). Moreover, as in the case of leukocyte elastase, the proteolytic fragmentation of apo(a), whether free or as a component of Lp(a), was identical, indicating that the linkage between apo(a) and apoB100 in Lp(a) did not hinder the accessibility of apo(a) to PMN elastase. Of interest was the observation that the cleavage pattern by elastase was unaffected by apo(a) size polymorphism, i.e. independent of the number of kringle IV-2 repeats composing the NH2-terminal region of apo(a) that is targeted for excretion in the urine where it is found as fragments of different size (9Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Google Scholar, 20Oida K. Takai H. Maeda H. Takahashi S. Shimada A. Suzuki J. Tamai T. Nakai T. Miyabo S. Clin.

White A.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2414-2424Google Scholar). Moreover, in keeping with our previous study (9Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Google Scholar), we observed that Lp(a), upon elastase cleavage, generates mini-Lp(a) particles in which apoB100 is linked via a disulfide bond to truncated apo(a)s, the size of which depends on the site of elastase cleavage. The notion that PMN elastase can effect a reduction in the size of apo(a) is of interest, particularly because according to our previous studies in mice (9Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Google Scholar) truncation has an effect on the metabolic fate of Lp(a). The presence of small amounts of apo(a) fragments in normal human plasma has been reported by our laboratory (9Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Google Scholar) and others (20Oida K. Takai H. Maeda H. Takahashi S. Shimada A. Suzuki J. Tamai T. Nakai T. Miyabo S. Clin. Chem. 1992; 38: 2244-2248Google Scholar, 22Mooser V. Marcovina S.M. White A.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2414-2424Google Scholar). Our current studies support our previous suggestion (9Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Google Scholar) that these fragments may derive from the action of leukocyte elastase. There have been no reports on the presence of mini-Lp(a) particles in human plasma in vivo. This may be due to the fact that in the past no systematic search for these particles was carried out and also that under physiological conditions, the plasma levels of these particles would be low because PMN elastase activity is totally or largely inhibited by specific inhibitors like α1-antitrypsin and α2-macroglobulin (5Schmidt W. Havemann K. Hoppe-Seylers Z. Physiol. Chem. 1974; 355: 1077-1082Google Scholar). On this premise, we can anticipate that in acute phase situations, such as inflammatory states, there would be an increased generation of PMN elastase and, thus, a potential for the formation of apo(a) fragments and mini-Lp(a) particles. In this regard, it is interesting to note that coagulation defects in patients with acute leukemia and septicemia have been attributed to the action of a granulocytic elastase-like enzyme able to cause the proteolytic fragmentation of factors involved in coagulation (23Egbring R. Schmidt W. Fuchs G. Havemann K. Blood. 1977; 49: 219-231Google Scholar). Plasma Lp(a) levels have been reported to increase in relation to an acute phase reaction (24Maeda S. Abe A. Seishima M. Makino K. Noma A. Kawade M. Atherosclerosis. 1989; 78: 145-150Google Scholar, 25Kario K. Matsuo T. Kobayashi H. Matsuo M. Asada R. Koide M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 1020-1024Google Scholar). Based on the results of our current studies, it would be important to establish whether such an increase is real or due to changes in epitope expression and, thus, antibody reactivity of the apo(a) fragments as compared with intact apo(a). Apo(a) fragments and mini-Lp(a) particles may also be generated topically at inflammatory sites favored by a microenvironment, where activated PMNs would release the elastase enzyme in amounts unopposed by physiological inhibitors. Apo(a) fragments have been reported in the atherosclerotic plaque (26Hoff H.F. O'Neil J. Smejkal G.B. Yashiro A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 67: 271-280Google Scholar), and it is tempting to speculate that they might be derived from an elastase action. Should this be the case, two possibilities may be considered, although they are not mutually exclusive; the fragments are formed in the plasma and then transferred to the arterial wall and/or they are formed at a tissue site by an elastase action unopposed by physiological inhibitors of the enzyme. In the latter instance, apo(a) fragmentation may be contributed by the action of an elastase released from activated resident macrophages, an assumption based on the finding that macrophage elastase has structural and enzymatic properties similar to those of PMN elastase (27Senior R.M. Cambell E.J. Landis J.I. Cox F.R. Kuhn C. Koren H.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 69: 384-393Google Scholar).Another interesting aspect of our studies was the observation that an active PMN elastase can associate with Lp(a). The interaction appears to occur predominantly through the LDL component of Lp(a) and may be hydrophobic in nature, since the enzyme remains associated in the presence of high salt concentrations. In our studies, the Lp(a) isolated from the PMN conditioned medium had an elastase activity that was able to cleave the apo(a). Ultracentrifugation is an important procedure used to separate Lp(a) from the other lipoproteins and proteins of the plasma. It is now apparent that this procedure does not assure elastase-free Lp(a) products. This would also apply to lysine-Sepharose column chromatography, a complementary technique commonly used in Lp(a) purification. An elastase “contamination” must be considered in reports (28Pursiainen M. Jauhiainen M. Kovanen P.T. Ehnholm C. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 67: 25-33Google Scholar) associating proteolytic events in either Lp(a) or derivatives. In this vein, of significance are our past studies (29Polacek D. Byrne R.E. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2057-2063Google Scholar) showing that the in vitro incubation of LDL with PMN results in the release into the medium of a proteolytic activity that co-elutes with LDL by column chromatography at a physiological ionic strength. The similarity of the LDL results with those obtained with Lp(a) is further corroborated by the observation that for both lipoprotein particles, the proteolytic activity was due to an elastase based on its inhibition by MeO-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-CH2Cl. Moreover, in the case of the LDL, there was no evidence for a participation of oxidative events as assessed by lipid peroxidation in the thiobarbituric assay (29Polacek D. Byrne R.E. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2057-2063Google Scholar). The potential for oxidative events contributing to Lp(a) proteolysis was not examined in the current studies. However, we believe that, if present, they were of a relatively minor nature, since the proteolysis was inhibited by a specific elastase inhibitor and was equally observed in Lp(a)/apo(a) incubated with either PMN or a purified preparation of leukocyte elastase. Of interest, LDL modified by PMN elastase was shown to enhance the uptake of the lipoprotein particle by human monocyte-derived macrophages (30Polacek D. Byrne R.E. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 797-808Google Scholar) in the absence of reactive oxygen species. It would be of interest to conduct similar studies with elastase-derived fragments of apo(a) as well as mini-Lp(a) in an attempt to better define the site(s) on apo(a) responsible for the cellular uptake and degradation of Lp(a) and also their relative pathogenicity.Finally, the availability of products derived from the proteolytic fragmentation of Lp(a)/apo(a) should pave the way for in depth structural and functional studies directed at establishing potential differences among the various apo(a) domains. In this context, it would be important to carry out systematic studies on the content and composition of carbohydrates of the interkringle linkers to assess a potential heterogeneity among apo(a) domains. These studies are in progress in this laboratory.

Human leukocyte elastase is a neutral serine protease that is stored in the cytoplasmic azurophilic granules of blood neutrophils (5Schmidt W. Havemann K. Hoppe-Seylers Z. Physiol. Chem. 1974; 355: 1077-1082Google Scholar, 6Travis J.R. Baugh R. Giles P.J.D.J. Bowen J. Reilley C.F. Havemann K. Jonoff A. Neutral Proteases of Human Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes. Urban & Schwarzenberg, Baltimore1978: 118Google Scholar, 7Ohlsson K. Olsson I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 42: 519-527Google Scholar). Upon release from these cells, the enzyme causes the cleavage not only of elastin but also of a broad range of substrates including kringle-containing proteins like plasminogen, where it generates miniplasminogen by cleaving in the interkringle region (8Moroz L.A. Blood. 1981; 58: 97-104Google Scholar). In previous in vitro studies (9Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Google Scholar), we observed that the limited proteolysis of Lp(a) or apo(a) by purified preparations of either human leukocyte or porcine pancreatic elastase caused the cleavage of apo(a) at the Ile3520-Leu3521 bond located in the linker region between kringles IV-4 and IV-5. This cleavage resulted in the generation of two main fragments, F1 and F2, with distinct structural, functional, and metabolic properties. Moreover, pancreatic and leukocyte elastase cleaved the apoB100 component of Lp(a) without apparently compromising the overall structural organization of this lipoprotein particle. Prompted by these findings and to gain a further insight into their potential biological relevance, we explored the effects attending the in vitro incubation of Lp(a) and free apo(a) with polymorphonuclear cells (PMN), freshly isolated from human peripheral blood. The results of these studies, which are the subject of this report, demonstrate that apo(a), whether free or a member of Lp(a), undergoes a time-dependent proteolytic fragmentation that is caused by the action of a PMN-released elastase, which has a specificity for peptide bonds located in the interkringle domains of apo(a), resulting in the formation of fragments of various length. The results also show that following incubation with PMN, Lp(a) particles become smaller as a consequence of the reduction in apo(a) size. DISCUSSIONThe results of the current studies have shown that apo(a), either free or a constitutive component of the parent Lp(a), undergoes cleavage at multiple interkringle sites upon incubation with PMN freshly isolated from human peripheral blood. The involvement of an elastase enzyme in this fragmentation is supported by several lines of evidence: 1) similarity in results between PMN-dependent proteolysis and that caused by a purified human leukocyte elastase preparation; 2) capacity to hydrolyze the synthetic substrate MeO-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-AMC; 3) inhibition of the proteolysis by MeO-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-CH2Cl, a specific elastase inhibitor; 3) no effect on the proteolysis by benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Leu-Phe-CH2Cl, a specific inhibitor of cathepsin G, which is a serine protease abundant in PMN; 4) the nature of the cut sites, which were between two nonpolar amino acids. In a previous paper (9Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Google Scholar), we reported that the limited proteolysis of Lp(a) and apo(a) by a purified preparation of leukocyte elastase resulted in the cleavage of the Ile3520-Leu3521 bond in the linker region between kringle IV-4 and IV-5. This cleavage generated two main fragments, which we previously called F1, representing the NH2-terminal domain, and F2, the COOH-terminal domain. In this study, we now show that under our current experimental conditions, purified leukocyte elastase can also cause peptide bond cleavages at additional interkringle regions of apo(a) and the formation of at least seven fragments, F1 (KIV-1 to KIV-4); F2 (KIV-5 to the protease region); F3 (KIV-5 to KIV-10); F4 (KIV-8 to the protease region); F5 (KIV-8 to KIV-10); F6 (KIV-5 to KIV-7) and F7 (KV to the protease region). Moreover, as in the case of leukocyte elastase, the proteolytic fragmentation of apo(a), whether free or as a component of Lp(a), was identical, indicating that the linkage between apo(a) and apoB100 in Lp(a) did not hinder the accessibility of apo(a) to PMN elastase. Of interest was the observation that the cleavage pattern by elastase was unaffected by apo(a) size polymorphism, i.e. independent of the number of kringle IV-2 repeats composing the NH2-terminal region of apo(a) that is targeted for excretion in the urine where it is found as fragments of different size (9Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Google Scholar, 20Oida K. Takai H. Maeda H. Takahashi S. Shimada A. Suzuki J. Tamai T. Nakai T. Miyabo S. Clin.

White A.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2414-2424Google Scholar). Moreover, in keeping with our previous study (9Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Google Scholar), we observed that Lp(a), upon elastase cleavage, generates mini-Lp(a) particles in which apoB100 is linked via a disulfide bond to truncated apo(a)s, the size of which depends on the site of elastase cleavage. The notion that PMN elastase can effect a reduction in the size of apo(a) is of interest, particularly because according to our previous studies in mice (9Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Google Scholar) truncation has an effect on the metabolic fate of Lp(a). The presence of small amounts of apo(a) fragments in normal human plasma has been reported by our laboratory (9Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Google Scholar) and others (20Oida K. Takai H. Maeda H. Takahashi S. Shimada A. Suzuki J. Tamai T. Nakai T. Miyabo S. Clin. Chem. 1992; 38: 2244-2248Google Scholar, 22Mooser V. Marcovina S.M. White A.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2414-2424Google Scholar). Our current studies support our previous suggestion (9Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Google Scholar) that these fragments may derive from the action of leukocyte elastase. There have been no reports on the presence of mini-Lp(a) particles in human plasma in vivo. This may be due to the fact that in the past no systematic search for these particles was carried out and also that under physiological conditions, the plasma levels of these particles would be low because PMN elastase activity is totally or largely inhibited by specific inhibitors like α1-antitrypsin and α2-macroglobulin (5Schmidt W. Havemann K. Hoppe-Seylers Z. Physiol. Chem. 1974; 355: 1077-1082Google Scholar). On this premise, we can anticipate that in acute phase situations, such as inflammatory states, there would be an increased generation of PMN elastase and, thus, a potential for the formation of apo(a) fragments and mini-Lp(a) particles. In this regard, it is interesting to note that coagulation defects in patients with acute leukemia and septicemia have been attributed to the action of a granulocytic elastase-like enzyme able to cause the proteolytic fragmentation of factors involved in coagulation (23Egbring R. Schmidt W. Fuchs G. Havemann K. Blood. 1977; 49: 219-231Google Scholar). Plasma Lp(a) levels have been reported to increase in relation to an acute phase reaction (24Maeda S. Abe A. Seishima M. Makino K. Noma A. Kawade M. Atherosclerosis. 1989; 78: 145-150Google Scholar, 25Kario K. Matsuo T. Kobayashi H. Matsuo M. Asada R. Koide M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 1020-1024Google Scholar). Based on the results of our current studies, it would be important to establish whether such an increase is real or due to changes in epitope expression and, thus, antibody reactivity of the apo(a) fragments as compared with intact apo(a). Apo(a) fragments and mini-Lp(a) particles may also be generated topically at inflammatory sites favored by a microenvironment, where activated PMNs would release the elastase enzyme in amounts unopposed by physiological inhibitors. Apo(a) fragments have been reported in the atherosclerotic plaque (26Hoff H.F. O'Neil J. Smejkal G.B. Yashiro A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 67: 271-280Google Scholar), and it is tempting to speculate that they might be derived from an elastase action. Should this be the case, two possibilities may be considered, although they are not mutually exclusive; the fragments are formed in the plasma and then transferred to the arterial wall and/or they are formed at a tissue site by an elastase action unopposed by physiological inhibitors of the enzyme. In the latter instance, apo(a) fragmentation may be contributed by the action of an elastase released from activated resident macrophages, an assumption based on the finding that macrophage elastase has structural and enzymatic properties similar to those of PMN elastase (27Senior R.M. Cambell E.J. Landis J.I. Cox F.R. Kuhn C. Koren H.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 69: 384-393Google Scholar).Another interesting aspect of our studies was the observation that an active PMN elastase can associate with Lp(a). The interaction appears to occur predominantly through the LDL component of Lp(a) and may be hydrophobic in nature, since the enzyme remains associated in the presence of high salt concentrations. In our studies, the Lp(a) isolated from the PMN conditioned medium had an elastase activity that was able to cleave the apo(a). Ultracentrifugation is an important procedure used to separate Lp(a) from the other lipoproteins and proteins of the plasma. It is now apparent that this procedure does not assure elastase-free Lp(a) products. This would also apply to lysine-Sepharose column chromatography, a complementary technique commonly used in Lp(a) purification. An elastase “contamination” must be considered in reports (28Pursiainen M. Jauhiainen M. Kovanen P.T. Ehnholm C. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 67: 25-33Google Scholar) associating proteolytic events in either Lp(a) or derivatives. In this vein, of significance are our past studies (29Polacek D. Byrne R.E. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2057-2063Google Scholar) showing that the in vitro incubation of LDL with PMN results in the release into the medium of a proteolytic activity that co-elutes with LDL by column chromatography at a physiological ionic strength. The similarity of the LDL results with those obtained with Lp(a) is further corroborated by the observation that for both lipoprotein particles, the proteolytic activity was due to an elastase based on its inhibition by MeO-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-CH2Cl. Moreover, in the case of the LDL, there was no evidence for a participation of oxidative events as assessed by lipid peroxidation in the thiobarbituric assay (29Polacek D. Byrne R.E. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2057-2063Google Scholar). The potential for oxidative events contributing to Lp(a) proteolysis was not examined in the current studies. However, we believe that, if present, they were of a relatively minor nature, since the proteolysis was inhibited by a specific elastase inhibitor and was equally observed in Lp(a)/apo(a) incubated with either PMN or a purified preparation of leukocyte elastase. Of interest, LDL modified by PMN elastase was shown to enhance the uptake of the lipoprotein particle by human monocyte-derived macrophages (30Polacek D. Byrne R.E. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 797-808Google Scholar) in the absence of reactive oxygen species. It would be of interest to conduct similar studies with elastase-derived fragments of apo(a) as well as mini-Lp(a) in an attempt to better define the site(s) on apo(a) responsible for the cellular uptake and degradation of Lp(a) and also their relative pathogenicity.Finally, the availability of products derived from the proteolytic fragmentation of Lp(a)/apo(a) should pave the way for in depth structural and functional studies directed at establishing potential differences among the various apo(a) domains. In this context, it would be important to carry out systematic studies on the content and composition of carbohydrates of the interkringle linkers to assess a potential heterogeneity among apo(a) domains. These studies are in progress in this laboratory. The results of the current studies have shown that apo(a), either free or a constitutive component of the parent Lp(a), undergoes cleavage at multiple interkringle sites upon incubation with PMN freshly isolated from human peripheral blood.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1411-1418Google Scholar); choline and ethanolamine are precursors in the DAG-dependent pathway leading to phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis (1Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 635-669Google Scholar, 2Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R.

Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 1-20Google Scholar). The regulation of INO1 and CHO1/PSS gene expression by inositol and choline has been shown to occur at the level of mRNA abundance (11Bailis A.M. Poole M.A. Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 167-176Google Scholar, 12Hirsch J.P. Henry S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3320-3328Google Scholar) and is mediated by the 5′ cis-acting UASINO (upstream activation sequence) and the trans-acting INO2-INO4-OPI1 regulatory gene products (10Bailis A.M. Lopes J.M. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1411-1418Google Scholar,12Hirsch J.P. Henry S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3320-3328Google Scholar). The INO2 and INO4 genes encode positive regulators of transcription that are required for derepression in response to inositol and choline deprivation. Ino2p is the transcriptional activator that is dependent on dimerization with Ino4p for its binding to the UASINO sequence. Strains carrying ino2 or ino4 mutant alleles fail to express the INO1 gene product and thus need inositol supplement for growth (13Donahue T.F. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1981; 98: 491-503Google Scholar). INO2 expression is also coordinately regulated by inositol (14Ashburner B.P. Lopes J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1709-1715Google Scholar). The OPI1 gene product is required for repression of gene expression in response to inositol and choline supplementation. The opi1 mutant strains constitutively overexpress the INO1 and CHO1 genes (15Klig L.S. Homann M.J. Carman G.M. Henry S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1135-1141Google Scholar). Studies using the CAT reporter gene fused to the endogenous promoter of the OPI1 gene or the INO2 gene suggest that OPI1 is required for the initial response to inositol but that regulation of INO2 expression establishes the magnitude and cooperativity of the response (14Ashburner B.P. Lopes J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1709-1715Google Scholar,16Ashburner B.P. Lopes J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9722-9726Google Scholar). Expression of the PIS1 gene, as with the INO4 or OPI1 genes, does not respond to inositol regulation, although a UASINO sequence is also found 5′ to the PIS1 open reading frame (17Fischl A.S. Homann M.J. Poole M.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3178-3183Google Scholar). Instead, PIS1 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by carbon sources in growth medium (18Anderson M.S. Lopes J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26596-26601Google Scholar). Relative to cells grown in a glucose medium, expression of the PIS1 gene is reduced when cells were grown in a medium containing glycerol and elevated when cells were grown in a medium containing galactose. Carbon source regulation involves the binding of Mcm1 protein to the cis-MCEs sequences and the involvement of the two-component regulatory gene SLN1 (18Anderson M.S. Lopes J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26596-26601Google Scholar). We previously reported the isolation of the CDS1 gene encoding CDP-DAG synthase activity in yeast (19Shen H. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 789-795Google Scholar). By gene interruption, we showed that this gene is essential for spore germination and vegetative cell growth. Overexpression of CDP-DAG synthase activity results in an elevation in the apparent initial rate of synthesis of PI relative to PS. A reduction of CDP-DAG synthase activity to 10% of the wild type level has an opposite effect on the above phospholipid biosynthetic steps. Reduced synthase levels also resulted in inositol excretion. By characterizing the cdg1 mutant (20Klig L.S. Homann M.J. Kohlwein S.D. Kelley M.J. Henry S.A. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1878-1886Google Scholar), we found a point mutation within the CDS1 gene that results in the cdg1 phenotype of pleiotropic deficiencies in phospholipid biosynthesis, including a reduced level of CDP-DAG synthase activity, an elevated phosphatidic acid content, a constitutive elevated level of inositol 1-phosphate synthase activity, and an elevated PS synthase activity (21Shen H. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29043-29048Google Scholar). All of these results are suggestive of alteration of expression of the INO1 and CHO1/PSS genes at reduced cellular CDP-DAG synthase levels. Cloning of the CDS1 gene affords the opportunity to study the role of CDP-DAG synthase and its product in the regulation of phospholipid metabolism. In this study, we examined the regulation of phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes by CDP-DAG synthase activity. We found that the increased PS synthase activity and the inositol excretion in response to reduced CDP-DAG synthase activity was due to an increased steady-state level of CHO1/PSS and INO1 mRNA transcripts, respectively, whereas the parallel decrease in PI synthase activity was not a result of a change in the PIS1 mRNA transcript level. However, regulation of expression of the CHO1/PSS and INO1 genes in response to CDP-DAG synthase activity levels did not correlate with factors that regulate the expression of these genes in response to inositol and choline. Simple salts, buffers, and amino acids were purchased from Sigma and Fisher. YEP broth and synthetic media for yeast growth and selection were from Bio 101, Inc. Yeast nitrogen base without amino acids was from Difco Laboratories. Trizol reagent was a product of Life Technologies, Inc. Positively charged nylon membranes, Genius 1 kit, and reagents for nonradioactive detection of nucleic acid were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Radiochemicals were obtained from Amersham Corp. Oligonucleotides were prepared commercially by Genosys Biotechnologies. The Gene Amp polymerase chain reaction reagent kit was from Perkin-Elmer Cetus. Qiaex II gel extraction kit was from Qiagen Inc. CDP-DAG was synthesized by reaction of phosphatidic acid and CMP-morpholidate and purified by phase separation and silica gel chromatography (22Carman G.M. Fischl A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 305-312Google Scholar). The yeast strains used in this study were YPH102 (MATa ura3-52 lys2-801 ade2-101 leu2-D1 his-D200) (23Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar), YSD90A (MATa ura3-52 lys2-801 ade2-101 leu2-D1 his-D200 cds1::TRP1) (19Shen H. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 789-795Google Scholar), and MC13 (MATa ino1-13 lys2 can1) (24Culbertson M.R. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1975; 80: 23-40Google Scholar). YSD90A depends on a plasmid-borne copy of the CDS1 gene for viability. MC13 is an inositol auxotroph. Plasmid pSDG2 (19Shen H. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 789-795Google Scholar) was derived from YCpGAL (25Bonner J.J. Gene. 1991; 104: 113-118Google Scholar), a single copy number plasmid provided by J. Bonner. This plasmid contained the CDS1 gene under GAL1 promoter control. Plasmid phCDS (also known as pYES.CDS (26Weeks R. Dowhan W. Shen H. Balantac N. Meengs B. Nudelman E. Leung D.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 281-289Google Scholar)) carries a human CDS gene on vector pYES2 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA); expression of this gene is under GAL1 promoter control. Plasmid pBluescript KS was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and used for subcloning and DNA sequencing purposes. All yeast cultures were grown at 30°C in complete synthetic medium (CSM) with the indicated nutrient drop-outs for selection purposes as described previously (19Shen H. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 789-795Google Scholar); all complete synthetic media were supplemented with the indicated carbon source and yeast nitrogen base containing 2 mg/ml (11 μM) inositol based on the Difco manual (27Difco Dehydrated Culture Media and Reagents for Microbiology: Difco Manual. 10th Ed. Difco, Detroit, MI1984Google Scholar) except where indicated. For the study of inositol regulation, cells were maintained in a synthetic medium containing 60 μM inositol and 1 mM choline before they were shifted to an inositol- and choline-free medium (28Janitor M. Subik J. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 307-312Google Scholar). Activities of CDP-DAG synthase, PI synthase, and PS synthase were determined as described previously (21Shen H. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29043-29048Google Scholar). Briefly, the total cell membrane fraction was resuspended in 20 mM Tris-maleate, pH 7.0. CDP-DAG synthase activity was measured by the incorporation of radiolabel into CDP-DAG in 50 mM Tris-maleate buffer, pH 6.5, 20 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1.0 mM [5-3H]CTP (9,000 cpm/nmol), 0.5 mM phosphatidic acid, and 50 μg of membrane protein in a total volume of 0.1 ml (29Carman G.M. Kelley M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 242-247Google Scholar). PS synthase activity was measured by the incorporation of radiolabel into PS in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 0.6 mM MnCl2, 0.2 mM CDP-DAG, 0.25% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM L-[3-3H]serine (10,000 cpm/nmol), and 75 μg of membrane protein in a total volume of 0.1 ml (30Carman G.M. Bae-Lee M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 298-305Google Scholar). PI synthase activity was measured by the incorporation of 0.5 mM myo-[2-3H]inositol (10,000 cpm/nmol) into PI in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 2 mM MnCl2, 0.2 mM CDP-DAG, 0.15% Triton X-100, and 75 μg of membrane protein in a total volume of 0.1 ml (22Carman G.M. Fischl A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 305-312Google Scholar). All assays were carried out at 30°C for either 5 min (CDP-DAG synthase) or 20 min (PS and PI synthases). Double-stranded DNA probes were used for Northern blot analysis. The probe for CDS1 detection was a BstEII-BglII fragment from plasmid pSDG1 (19Shen H. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 789-795Google Scholar). The remaining probes used in this study were polymerase chain reaction products generated using YPH102 genomic DNA as a template and the polymerase chain reaction primers listed in Table I designed according to the DNA sequences of CHO1/PSS (5Kiyono K. Miura K. Kushima Y. Hikiji T. Fukushima J. Shibuya I. Ohta A. J. Biochem. 1987; 102: 1089-1100Google Scholar), INO1 (4Klig L.S. Henry S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3816-3820Google Scholar), INO2 (31Nikoloff D.M. McGraw P. Henry S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3253Google Scholar), OPI1 (32White M.J. Hirsch J.P. Henry S.A. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 8-14Google Scholar). Each probe was subcloned into plasmid pBluescript KS and verified to be correct by DNA sequencing before being labeled by random priming and incorporation of digoxigenin-dUTP using the Genius 1 kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Concentrations of labeled probes for individual detections were 5 ng/ml TCM1, 20 ng/ml CHO1, INO1, PIS1, and 50 ng/ml INO2, OPI1.Table IPCR primers used in this studyNameSequenceCHO1F5′-ATGGATCCCACACACGGACACAGA-3′CHO1R5′-CGGAATTCATTCCACACCCATGGA-3′INO1F5′-TTGGATCCGGTGGCTTCAACAATGG-3′INO1R5′-CGAATTCTGAGTCCCCGACGGGCT-3′INO2F5′-TGGGGATCCTAGATCTGGATAACG-3′INO2R5′-TCAGAATTCATCCAGTATGTGCTG-3′OPI1F5′-GTGGATCCGGCTGAAGTACTTGGG-3′OPI1R5′-TGTCTCGAGTTAGTCCTTGCTATCC-3′PIS1F5′-AAGGATCCTGCAGAACACGTTCTG-3′PIS1R5′-TGGAATTCTCGTTGGCATTCTTGG-3′TCM1F5′-GAGGATCCGAAGCACCACGTCACG-3′TCM1R5′-TGAATTCGATTTCAGCCAAATGAG-3′ Open table in a new tab Yeast cells were harvested at different time points and were frozen at −80°C before RNA preparation. Total RNA was isolated from these samples by a glass-bead disruption/Trizol extraction procedure. Yeast pellets from 10 ml of mid-log phase cell culture were mixed with 0.2 ml of prechilled silicon beads (diameter, 0.3 mm) and 1 ml of Trizol and disrupted in a Mini-Beadbeater (Biospec Products) by a 2-min burst at 2800 rpm. The aqueous phase was then separated, and RNA was precipitated according to the instructions for RNA isolation (Life Technologies, Inc.). Typically, 30 mg of RNA was run on a 1.5% agarose gel overnight, transferred to a nylon membrane, and UV cross-linked to the nylon membrane using a Stratalinker device (Stratagene). Denatured probe was hybridized to the membrane-bound RNA, detected with anti-digoxigenin antibody, visualized by autoradiography according to the Genius System User's Guide (Boehringer Mannheim), and quantitated by densitometry. As previously reported (19Shen H. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 789-795Google Scholar), the cds1::TRP1 strain (cds1 mutant) depends on the expression of a plasmid-borne copy of CDS1 for viability. Introduction of a single copy plasmid, pSDG2 (PGAL1-CDS1), into a cds1 mutant supported cell growth in galactose-containing induction medium, but not in a glucose-containing noninduction medium where CDP-DAG synthase activity was undetectable in cell extracts at the point of cell arrest. To study the cellular response at low CDP-DAG synthase levels, we further characterized the growth phenotype of this mutant. Mutant cds1 cells grew normally in galactose medium compared with the wild type strain YPH102 because the growth of the former strain was fully supported by overexpression of the plasmid-borne CDS1 gene. Cell growth rate gradually decreased as indicated by the increase in the doubling time over the first 16 h after the cells were shifted to a glucose medium followed by arrest of growth by 24 h (Fig. 1A). There was a significant difference in cell viability between 16 and 24 h of growth. About 80% of the cells were viable after 16 h versus less than 20% after 24 h as evidenced by colony formation on galactose-containing plates (Fig. 1B), indicating that arrest of cell growth was irreversible after prolonged periods below a threshold level of CDP-DAG synthase activity. CDP-DAG synthase activity in strain YSD90A/pSDG2 grown in galactose induction medium was 10-fold as high as the wild type level (strain YPH102). This activity was reduced after cells were shifted to the glucose noninduction medium, reaching the wild type level within 8 h (approximately 3 generations), and only about 10-15% of that level after 16 h of cell growth (Fig. 2A). PI synthase activity also followed the CDP-DAG synthase activity trend starting at 40% above wild type level and dropping first to 100% and then to 30% of the wild type level (Fig. 2C). PI synthase activity in wild type yeast YPH102 was higher when cells were grown in galactose medium than in glucose medium, but there was only a 1.4-fold change in the wild type strain as compared with about a 4-5-fold change in the mutant strain. PS synthase activity, however, showed the opposite trend, beginning at 40% of the wild type level, increasing first to the wild type level and then to almost 3-fold as high as the wild type level in the cds1 mutant (Fig. 2B). Carbon source did not affect PS synthase or CDP-DAG synthase activities in the wild type strain. We next asked whether these biochemical changes were a result of regulation of existing enzyme activity or an alteration in steady-state mRNA levels. Expression of the CHO1/PSS, INO1, and PIS1 genes was quantitated by Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA from both the cds1 mutant (carrying pSDG2) and the wild type strain YPH102. The results were normalized using a TCM1 probe specific for ribosomal protein L3 (33Schultz L.D. Friesen J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 8-14Google Scholar) previously shown to be unaffected by factors affecting the expression of phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes (12Hirsch J.P. Henry S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3320-3328Google Scholar). Transcripts of both the target genes and the TCM1 gene in the cds1 mutant were significantly lower at the 16-h time point than at the earlier time points, which indicated that the cells were very sick by this time; therefore, we chose time points from 0 to 12 h, where there was no change in the TCM1 mRNA levels. As shown in Fig. 3 the amount of CHO1/PSS transcript increased gradually from below the wild type level in the induction medium to almost 3 times as high as the wild type level, paralleling the reduction of cellular CDP-DAG synthase activity. This increase was in agreement with the change of PS synthase activity over the course of the experiment. The INO1 mRNA level was higher in cells grown in galactose medium than in glucose medium in both strains, YPH102 and YSD90A (0 h versus 4 h). However, there was no increase in the mutant strain relative to the wild type strain until CDP-DAG synthase activity was well below the wild type level (Fig. 3), correlating with our previous observation that the cds1 mutant excreted inositol into the growth medium only when cellular CDP-DAG synthase activity was low (19Shen H. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 789-795Google Scholar,21Shen H. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29043-29048Google Scholar). The PIS1 mRNA level remained the same (Fig. 3) despite the significant reduction in PI synthase activity over the course of the experiment. We were unable to measure CDS1 transcript levels in the cds1 mutant extracts due to interference by pSDG2 plasmid DNA. Because both CDP-DAG synthase protein and activity were overexpressed in the induction medium, the above regulation could be due to either the amount of activity, which determines the cellular CDP-DAG level, or the amount of CDS1 gene product. To address this point, we tested the effect of a human CDP-DAG synthase, isolated from a leukocyte cDNA library, on the transcription of the above genes. GAL1 promoter-controlled overexpression of this gene complements the growth phenotype of the yeast cds1 mutant (26Weeks R. Dowhan W. Shen H. Balantac N. Meengs B. Nudelman E. Leung D.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 281-289Google Scholar). However, CDP-DAG synthase activity is only 20-30% of the wild type yeast level, resulting in inositol excretion even in the induction medium. This transformant stopped growing in noninduction medium after 1-2 generations of growth (data not shown), consistent with synthase activity being near the threshold level for growth. Cells were grown in galactose medium to mid-log phase, shifted to a glucose medium, and grown for an additional 3 h. Total RNA was isolated from these cells and was used for quantitation of CHO1/PSS and INO1 transcripts by Northern blot analysis and normalized to the TCM1 transcript. Both transcripts were higher in the cds1 mutant than in the wild type control (Fig. 4). A shift from galactose to glucose medium did not significantly affect levels of these transcripts, suggesting that both CHO1/PSS and INO1 were fully overexpressed at 20-30% of the wild type CDP-DAG synthase level. This result argues that it is CDP-DAG synthase activity, and not synthase protein level, that regulates CHO1/PSS and INO1 expression. CDP-DAG synthase regulation of CHO1/PSS and INO1 expression showed surprising similarity to the response of these two genes to inositol and choline, which is mediated by the INO2-INO4-OPI1 gene products (9Culbertson M.R. Donahue T.F. Henry S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 243-250Google Scholar,10Bailis A.M. Lopes J.M. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1411-1418Google Scholar). To determine the potential involvement of these regulatory factors in the alteration in gene expression brought about by changes in CDP-DAG synthase activity, we examined the levels of INO2 and OPI1 transcripts in the cds1 mutant by quantitative Northern blot analysis. The data in Fig. 5 show that transcripts of INO2 and OPI1 were the same in both wild type yeast and the cds1 mutant regardless of the change of CDP-DAG synthase activity in the latter strain. Therefore, regulation of gene expression by CDP-DAG synthase activity is not correlated with changes in expression of regulatory genes that respond to inositol. Expression of CDP-DAG synthase activity, like that of the other enzymes in the phosphatidylcholine biosynthetic pathway, is coordinately regulated by inositol and choline in the growth medium (34Homann M.J. Henry S.A. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1265-1266Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism for the regulation of this enzymatic activity has not been established. Because a cis-acting UASINO sequence has also been found 5′ to the CDS1 gene (19Shen H. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 789-795Google Scholar), we examined whether CDS1 expression also changes in concert with the expression of the INO2 regulatory gene. Wild type strain YPH102 and the ino1 mutant MC13 were first grown in a synthetic medium containing 60 μM inositol and 1 mM choline (+ino). Cells were shifted to inositol- and choline-free media (−ino), and growth was continued for 4 h before harvesting. Transcripts of CDS1 and INO2 were assayed by quantitative Northern blot analysis and normalized to the TCM1 transcript. In both wild type yeast and ino1 mutant strains, INO2 transcript levels were low in cells growing in +ino medium as compared with −ino medium, and the levels of the CDS1 transcript followed those of INO2 (Fig. 6). These results indicate that regulation of CDS1 expression by inositol and choline is correlated with the transcript level of the cognate activator gene INO2, which is also regulated by precursors of phospholipid biosynthesis. The results reported here demonstrate that phospholipid biosynthetic activity can be regulated by variations in CDP-DAG synthase activity. A shift of the cds1 mutant from induction to noninduction medium abolished the expression of the plasmid-borne CDS1 gene and caused changes over a 100-fold range in CDP-DAG synthase specific activity from 10-fold above to about 10% that of the wild type level. Although CDP-DAG synthase specific activity was reduced, total activity in the culture remained the same, which argues that the decreasing specific activity was due to dilution, not inactivation, of this enzyme. Such a change in enzymatic activity would dramatically affect the potential synthetic capability for CDP-DAG, a substrate for both PS and PI biosynthesis. In our previous studies (19Shen H. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 789-795Google Scholar), we found that down-regulation of plasmid-borne CDS1 expression in a cds1 mutant resulted in a reduction in both the initial rate of biosynthesis and the steady-state level of PI and an opposite increase with respect to PS; we also observed significant excretion of inositol. In this study we showed that the molecular basis for such alterations in phospholipid composition is a result of changes in the effective enzymatic activities of the two branch enzymes, PS synthase and PI synthase, and an apparent increase in inositol 1-phosphate synthesis. The most novel finding in this study was that PS synthase and inositol 1-phosphate synthase activities are regulated at the transcriptional level, whereas PI synthase is regulated posttranscriptionally in response to changes in CDP-DAG synthetic capability. This is the first indication that these important phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes are regulated in response to an upstream enzymatic activity in the phospholipid biosynthetic cascade. Although regulation of expression of both CHO1/PSS and INO1 by CDP-DAG synthase activity is qualitatively similar, there are significant differences in the response of these two genes. The increase in the steady-state level of the CHO1/PSS gene transcript followed the dilution of CDP-DAG synthase activity during cell growth and division (Fig. 3). On the other hand, INO1 expression was not further repressed over wild type levels by overproduction of CDP-DAG synthase activity and was only derepressed when synthase levels were reduced below wild type levels. Previous results suggested that the PI synthase level is not subject to coordinate regulation by inositol and choline (17Fischl A.S. Homann M.J. Poole M.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3178-3183Google Scholar) but is primarily regulated by the available concentration of its substrates, inositol and CDP-DAG (8Kelley M.J. Bailis A.M. Henry S.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18078-18085Google Scholar). The results reported here demonstrate that PI synthase activity also responds to the cellular CDP-DAG synthase activity. Overall, PI synthase activity was higher in cells grown in galactose medium than in glucose medium, consistent with the recent report (18Anderson M.S. Lopes J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26596-26601Google Scholar) on the effects of carbon source on the PIS1 transcript levels. However, Northern blot analysis did not explain the decrease in PI synthase activity that followed the trend in CDP-DAG synthase activity. Therefore, regulation of this activity could be at the translational level or could be due to protein modification or degradation. There are examples of modification of phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes by posttranslational events. PS synthase has been shown to be phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (35Kinney A.J. Carman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7962-7966Google Scholar). The inositol transporter is degraded in the vacuole by the vacuole proteases following incubation of yeast cells in an inositol-containing medium, and degradation is blocked in the vacuolar protease mutant pep4 strain (36Lai K. Bolognese C.P. Swift S. McGraw P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2525-2534Google Scholar). Our preliminary studies showed that interruption of the PEP4 gene in the cds1 mutant did not affect the decrease in PI synthase activity (data not shown). We are currently pursuing further studies aimed at understanding the molecular basis for the regulation of PI synthase activity in response to CDP-DAG synthase activity. Despite the similar effect of CDP-DAG synthase activity and inositol upon coordinate regulation of gene expression, the mechanisms appear to be different. Our results clearly show that there was no detectable change in the amount of INO2 and OPI1 transcripts as a function of CDP-DAG synthase activity levels (Fig. 5), whereas the response of INO2 and CDS1 expression to inositol was dramatic (Fig. 6). The latter result is in agreement with studies from other groups demonstrating that inositol regulates gene expression via the INO2-INO4-OPI1 regulatory genes (1Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Annu. Rev.

Inositol regulation of CDS1 expression parallels the amount of INO2 transcript, as does the expression of CHO1/PSS and INO1 (14Ashburner B.P. Lopes J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1709-1715Google Scholar). Our results are the first report of coordinate and unique regulation by CDP-DAG synthase activity levels of several genes related to phospholipid metabolism. Clearly, INO2-INO4-OPI1 regulatory genes are not the only ones that control expression of phospholipid biosynthetic genes. INO1 transcription is also sensitive to mutations that affect the more general transcriptional apparatus, such as SWI1, SWI2, and SWI3, and these mutant strains are inositol auxotrophs (37Peterson C.L. Kruger W. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1991; 64: 1135-1143Google Scholar). Mutation of the SIN3 gene (also known as CPE1/UME4/RPD1/GAM2/SDI1) also affects a variety of genes and causes constitutive derepression of INO1 transcription (38Nasmyth K. Stillman D. Kipling D. Cell. 1987; 48: 579-587Google Scholar, 39Hudak K.A. Lopes J.M. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1994; 136: 475-483Google Scholar, 40Vidal M. Strich R. Esposito R.E. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell.

Expression of INO1 is also regulated by SIN1 gene product (37Peterson C.L. Kruger W. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1991; 64: 1135-1143Google Scholar). It is not clear what senses a change in CDP-DAG synthase activity and how this signal is transmitted downstream to regulate the phospholipid biosynthetic pathway. However, CDP-DAG itself has been shown to inhibit a 45-kDa PI 4-kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner (42Nickels Jr., J.T. Buxeda R.J. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11018-11024Google Scholar). The latter catalyzes the committed step in the synthesis of the phosphoinositides PIP and PIP2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (43Lester R.L. Steiner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 4889-4893Google Scholar). PIP2 or its hydrolysis products play an essential role in yeast proliferation (44Uno I. Fukami K. Kato H. Takenawa T. Ishikawa T. Nature. 1988; 333: 188-190Google Scholar). It is thus possible that CDP-DAG levels could play an important role in the regulation of phospholipid metabolism and cell growth via effects on the phosphoinositide pools (42Nickels Jr., J.T. Buxeda R.J. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11018-11024Google Scholar). The observation that CDP-DAG synthase activity perturbs phospholipid metabolism by affecting the expression and the level of phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes is nevertheless significant. These results demonstrate the complexity in the control of phospholipid metabolism necessary to ensure the efficient response of the cell to changes in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2003479580,"Abstract The catalytic turnover of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to oxidize SCN− is a hundredfold lower than that of lactoperoxidase (LPO) at optimum pH. While studying the mechanism, HRP was found to be reversibly inactivated following pseudo-first order kinetics with a second order rate constant of 400 M−1 min−1 when incubated with SCN− and H2O2. The slow rate of SCN− oxidation is increased severalfold in the presence of free radical traps, 5-5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide or α-phenyl-tert-butylnitrone, suggesting the plausible role of free radical or radical-derived product in the inactivation. Spectral studies indicate that SCN− at a lower concentrations slowly reduces compound II to native state by one-electron transfer as evidenced by a time-dependent spectral shift from 418 to 402 nm through an isosbestic point at 408 nm. In the presence of higher concentrations of SCN−, a new stable Soret peak appears at 421 nm with a visible peak at 540 nm, which are the characteristics of the inactivated enzyme. The one-electron oxidation product of SCN− was identified by electron spin resonance spectroscopy as 5-5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide adduct of the sulfur-centered thiocyanate radical (aN = 15.0 G and aβH = 16.5 G). The inactivation of the enzyme in the presence of SCN− and H2O2 is prevented by electron donors such as iodide or guaiacol. Binding studies indicate that both iodide and guaiacol compete with SCN− for binding at or near the SCN− binding site and thus prevent inactivation. The spectral characteristics of the inactivated enzyme are exactly similar to those of the native HRP-CN− complex. Quantitative measurements indicate that HRP produces a 10-fold higher amount of CN− than LPO when incubated with SCN− and H2O2. As HRP has higher affinity for CN− than LPO, it is concurrently inactivated by CN− formed during SCN− oxidation, which is not observed in case of LPO. This study further reveals that HRP catalyzes SCN− oxidation by two one-electron transfers with the intermediate formation of thiocyanate radicals. The radicals dimerize to form thiocyanogen, (SCN)2, which is hydrolyzed to form CN−. As LPO forms OSCN− as the major stable oxidation product through a two-electron transfer mechanism, it is not significantly inactivated by CN− formed in a small quantity."

Although this substitution occurs relatively far from the active site, the mutant enzyme has a reduced ratio of carboxylation to oxygenation in addition to reduced thermal stability in vivo and in vitro. In an attempt to understand the role of this region in catalysis, photosynthesis-competent revertants were selected. Two revertants, named R96-4C and R96-8E, were found to arise from second-site mutations that cause V262L and A222T substitutions, respectively. These intragenic suppressor mutations increase the CO2/O2 specificity and carboxylation Vmax back to wild-type values. Based on the crystal structure of the spinach holoenzyme, Leu-290 is not in van der Waals contact with either Val-262 or Ala-222.

The enzyme generates either two molecules of phosphoglycerate by carboxylation of RuBP or one molecule each of phosphoglycerate and phosphoglycolate by oxygenation of RuBP. Because phosphoglycolate enters the fruitless photorespiratory pathway and leads to the loss of CO2 (see Ref. 3Ogren W.L. Annu. Rev. Plant. Physiol. 1984; 35: 415-442Google Scholar for review), an increase in carboxylation or a decrease in oxygenation would likely improve plant productivity (see Ref. 1Spreitzer R.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 411-434Google Scholar for review). The ratio of carboxylation to oxygenation at any given concentrations of CO2 and O2 is defined by the CO2/O2 specificity factor, Ω = VcKo/VoKc, where Vc and Vo are the Vmax values for carboxylation and oxygenation, and Kc and Ko are the Michaelis constants for CO2 and O2, respectively (4Laing W.A. Ogren W.L. Hageman R.H. Plant Physiol. 1974; 54: 678-685Google Scholar). Because CO2 and O2 are mutually competitive at the same active site, the differential stabilization of the carboxylation and oxygenation transition states ultimately determines Ω (5Chen Z. Spreitzer R.J. Planta. 1991; 183: 597-603Google Scholar, 6Chen Z. Spreitzer R.J. Photosynth.

A family of nuclear rbcS genes encodes the 15-kDa small subunits, whereas the chloroplast rbcL gene encodes the 55-kDa large subunits. The small subunit is synthesized as a 21-kDa precursor in the cytosol and processed to mature form upon entry into chloroplasts (see Refs. 7Schmidt G.W. Mishkind M.L. Annu. Rev.

Holoenzyme assembly is then facilitated by the action of chloroplast chaperonin 60 (see Ref. 9Gatenby A.A. Viitanen P.V. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 45: 469-491Google Scholar for review). The active site of Rubisco is formed at the interface between the carboxyl-terminal α/β-barrel domain of one large subunit and the amino-terminal domain of a second large subunit (10Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Google Scholar, 11Schreuder H.A. Knight S. Curmi P.M.G. Andersson I. Cascio D. Brändén C.I. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rubisco also requires an additional nuclear encoded protein, named Rubisco activase, for its activation in vivo (see Ref. 13Salvucci M.E. Ogren W.L. Photosynth. Res. 1996; 47: 1-11Google Scholar for review). In contrast to directed mutagenesis (2Hartman F.C. Harpel M.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 197-234Google Scholar, 14Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18494-18498Google Scholar), random screening for chloroplast rbcL mutations in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, followed by genetic selection, has identified a number of complementing large subunit substitutions that influence Ω (16Chen Z. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3051-3053Google Scholar, 17Chen Z. Yu W. Lee J.H. Diao R. Spreitzer R.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8846-8850Google Scholar, 18Thow G. Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J.

Because these substitutions are most often found in the secondary structure elements that comprise the cores of the α/β-barrel or amino-terminal domains their influence on Ω is not readily deduced from the existing x-ray crystal structures (11Schreuder H.A.

In particular, one temperature-conditional mutant strain, named 68-4PP, results from an L290F substitution at the end of β-strand 5 at the bottom of the α/β barrel (21Spreitzer R.J. Al-Abed S.R. Huether M.J. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1988; 86: 773-777Google Scholar, 22Chen Z. Chastain C.J. Al-Abed S.R. Chollet R. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4696-4699Google Scholar). This substitution reduces Ω by 13%, and the mutant enzyme has decreased thermal stability at 35°C in vivo and in vitro (22Chen Z. Chastain C.J. Al-Abed S.R. Chollet R. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4696-4699Google Scholar, 23Chen Z. Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1993; 101: 1189-1194Google Scholar). Genetic selection previously identified a nuclear suppressor mutation, named S52-2B, that restores the thermal stability and Ω value of the 68-4PP enzyme back to wild-type levels (23Chen Z. Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1993; 101: 1189-1194Google Scholar, 24Chen Z. Green D. Westhoff C. Spreitzer R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 60-67Google Scholar). The S52-2B mutation does not reside in either of the two rbcS genes (24Chen Z. Green D. Westhoff C. Spreitzer R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 60-67Google Scholar), and its gene product affects Rubisco at a posttranslational step (23Chen Z. Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1993; 101: 1189-1194Google Scholar, 25Gotor C. Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. Planta. 1994; 193: 313-319Google Scholar). Otherwise, the molecular basis for the S52-2B mutation is not yet known. We reasoned that if suppressor mutations could arise in other nuclear genes or elsewhere in the 68-4PP rbcL gene, analysis of such suppressors might help to understand the mode of action of the 68-4PP L290F substitution and, perhaps, the means by which S52-2B acts as a suppressor. Therefore, additional photosynthesis-competent revertants were selected from mutant 68-4PP and analyzed. Two of these new revertants arose from rbcL second-site mutations that change residues at the interface between large and small subunits at the bottom of the α/β barrel.

A. 1988; 85: 4696-4699Google Scholar), and revertant strains are maintained at 25°C in darkness with 10 mM acetate medium containing 1.5% Bacto-agar (Difco) (26Spreitzer R.J. Mets L. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1981; 67: 565-569Google Scholar). The temperature-conditional 68-4PP mutant dies on minimal medium in the light at 35°C but survives on minimal medium at 25°C in the light or on acetate medium at either 25 or 35°C in the dark (21Spreitzer R.J. Al-Abed S.R. Huether M.J. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1988; 86: 773-777Google Scholar). This temperature-conditional photosynthesis deficiency results from an L290F substitution in the Rubisco large subunit (22Chen Z. Chastain C.J. Al-Abed S.R. Chollet R. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4696-4699Google Scholar, 23Chen Z. Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1993; 101: 1189-1194Google Scholar). For biochemical analysis, cells were grown on a rotary shaker with 500 ml of liquid acetate medium in darkness. Independent clones of mutant 68-4PP were used for reversion experiments to ensure the genetic independence of the revertants (27Spreitzer R.J. Jordan D.B. Ogren W.L. FEBS Lett. 1982; 148: 117-121Google Scholar). Dark-grown mutant cells were plated on solid minimal medium at a density of 2 × 106 cells/100-mm Petri plate at 35°C with a light intensity of 68 microeinsteins m−2 s−1 (21Spreitzer R.J. Al-Abed S.R. Huether M.J. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1988; 86: 773-777Google Scholar, 27Spreitzer R.J. Jordan D.B. Ogren W.L. FEBS Lett. 1982; 148: 117-121Google Scholar). In several reversion experiments, cells were treated with 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine and/or methyl methanesulfonate prior to selection to increase the recovery of chloroplast mutations (26Spreitzer R.J. Mets L. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1981; 67: 565-569Google Scholar, 27Spreitzer R.J. Jordan D.B. Ogren W.L. FEBS Lett. 1982; 148: 117-121Google Scholar). Crosses were performed as described previously (21Spreitzer R.J. Al-Abed S.R. Huether M.J. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1988; 86: 773-777Google Scholar, 26Spreitzer R.J. Mets L. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1981; 67: 565-569Google Scholar), and temperature-conditional, acetate-requiring progeny were scored by replica-plating dark-grown (25°C) tetrads to minimal medium in the light at 35°C. Isolation of total DNA, amplification of rbcL by the polymerase chain reaction, subsequent gene cloning of the amplified products, and DNA sequencing were performed as described previously (18Thow G. Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5109-5114Google Scholar). Several independently cloned rbcL genes were partially sequenced to confirm the assignment of mutations, and at least one complete rbcL gene from each revertant was sequenced to ensure that only the expected mutations were present. About 2 × 109 cells were harvested by centrifugation and sonicated in 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaHCO3, and 50 mM N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine, pH 8.0, at 0°C for 3 min. Protein was quantified by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). The cell extracts were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), and Western analysis was performed as described previously (25Gotor C. Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. Planta. 1994; 193: 313-319Google Scholar). Rubisco holoenzyme was purified from cell extracts by sucrose gradient centrifugation (30Spreitzer R.J. Chastain C.J. Curr. Genet. 1987; 11: 611-616Google Scholar). RuBP carboxylase activity was measured as the incorporation of acid-stable 14C from NaH14CO3. Ω was determined by the simultaneous measurement of the carboxylase and oxygenase activities of purified Rubisco (20 μg/reaction) with 200 μM [1-3H]RuBP (7.2 Ci/mol) and 2 mM NaH14CO3 (5.0 Ci/mol) in 30-min reactions at 25°C (27Spreitzer R.J. Jordan D.B. Ogren W.L. FEBS Lett. 1982; 148: 117-121Google Scholar, 31Jordan D.B. Ogren W.L. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1981; 67: 237-245Google Scholar). Synthesis and purification of [1-3H]RuBP were performed according to the methods of Kuehn and Hsu (32Kuehn G.D. Hsu T.C. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 909-912Google Scholar). Other kinetic constants of the purified enzymes were determined as described previously (22Chen Z. Chastain C.J. Al-Abed S.R. Chollet R. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4696-4699Google Scholar). In a previous study (24Chen Z. Green D. Westhoff C. Spreitzer R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 60-67Google Scholar), photosynthesis-competent revertants were recovered at a frequency of 7 × 10−9 cells by directly plating rbcL mutant 68-4PP mt+ on minimal medium in the light at 35°C. In the present study, revertants of 68-4PP mt+ were recovered spontaneously (at a frequency of 5 × 10−9) or they were recovered after methyl methanesulfonate or 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine/methyl methanesulfonate treatment (at a frequency of 1 × 10−8) as a means for increasing the number of potential suppressor mutations (17Chen Z. Yu W. Lee J.H. Diao R. Spreitzer R.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8846-8850Google Scholar, 26Spreitzer R.J. Mets L. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1981; 67: 565-569Google Scholar, 30Spreitzer R.J. Chastain C.J. Curr. Genet. 1987; 11: 611-616Google Scholar). Genetic analysis of 11 revertants revealed that two of them, named R96-4C and R96-8E, were inherited in a uniparental pattern indicative of mutations in chloroplast DNA. Both of these strains were recovered following methyl methanesulfonate treatment. When the rbcL genes from wild type, R96-4C, and R96-8E were cloned, sequenced, and compared, both of the revertants were found to arise from intragenic suppression. In addition to the original 68-4PP (L290F) mutation, the revertant R96-4C rbcL gene also contained a G to T transversion mutation that would change Val (GTA) to Leu (TTA) at large subunit residue 262. Because this mutation eliminated an RsaI restriction site, the assignment of the mutation was further verified by restriction analysis of revertant R96-4C DNA. DNA sequencing of the R96-8E rbcL gene revealed a G to A transition mutation that would change Ala (GCT) to Thr (ACT) at large subunit residue 222. Thus, the L290F substitution caused by the original mutation can be complemented by either a V262L or A222T substitution. Because either substitution could restore photosynthetic growth of the 68-4PP mutant at the 35°C restrictive temperature, we assumed that both substitutions must affect Rubisco catalysis or stability. When extracts of 35°C-grown wild-type, mutant, and revertant cells were fractionated on sucrose gradients, the revertants were found to have a modest increase in the amount of Rubisco holoenzyme relative to that of the 68-4PP mutant (Table I). However, the revertants had only about 30% of the wild-type level of holoenzyme when grown at 35°C, and when grown at 25°C they had less holoenzyme than the 68-4PP mutant (Table I). To confirm that the levels of extractable holoenzyme represented the levels of holoenzyme in vivo, extracts were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by immunoblotting (data not shown). The V262L and A222T substitutions may complement the L290F mutant substitution by partially restoring Rubisco thermal stability in vivo at 35°C, but this “improvement” is associated with a decrease in holoenzyme stability at the 25°C permissive temperature (Table I). The ratio between Rubisco carboxylase activities measured at limiting CO2 (0.53 mM NaHCO3) under 100% N2 and 100% O2 is a function of the Kc and Ko kinetic constants (22Chen Z. Chastain C.J. Al-Abed S.R. Chollet R. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4696-4699Google Scholar, 24Chen Z. Green D. Westhoff C. Spreitzer R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 60-67Google Scholar). When these ratios were determined for purified Rubisco, wild-type and 68-4PP (L290F) mutant enzymes had values of 3.0 and 2.4, respectively. The R96-4C (L290F/V262L) and R96-8E (L290F/A222T) revertant enzymes had N2/O2 ratio values of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively, indicating that these enzymes had kinetic properties different from either the wild-type or 68-4PP mutant enzyme. The 68-4PP (L290F) mutant enzyme is known to have an Ω value lower than that of the wild-type enzyme (22Chen Z. Chastain C.J. Al-Abed S.R. Chollet R. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4696-4699Google Scholar, 24Chen Z. Green D. Westhoff C. Spreitzer R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 60-67Google Scholar). Detailed biochemical analysis of purified Rubisco confirmed that the 68-4PP enzyme has a 17% decrease in Ω and revealed that the revertant enzymes have Ω values restored to the wild-type value (Table II). The improved Ω values of both revertant enzymes arise from increases in Vc, Vc/Kc, and Ko/Kc relative to the original 68-4PP mutant enzyme (Table II). However, neither enzyme has a Vc or Vc/Kc value as good as that of the wild-type enzyme. With regard to the revertant R96-4C (L290F/V262L) enzyme, the improved Ω occurs despite an increase in Kc and decrease in Vc/Vo relative to the values of the 68-4PP (L290F) mutant enzyme. Mutant 68-4PP Rubisco has a decreased Ω (22Chen Z. Chastain C.J. Al-Abed S.R. Chollet R. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4696-4699Google Scholar) and reduced thermal stability in vivo and in vitro (22Chen Z. Chastain C.J. Al-Abed S.R. Chollet R. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4696-4699Google Scholar, 23Chen Z. Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1993; 101: 1189-1194Google Scholar). These enzyme defects arise from an L290F substitution in the chloroplast-encoded Rubisco large subunit (22Chen Z. Chastain C.J. Al-Abed S.R. Chollet R. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4696-4699Google Scholar, 24Chen Z. Green D. Westhoff C. Spreitzer R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 60-67Google Scholar). According to the crystal structure of spinach Rubisco (10Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Google Scholar, 12Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Google Scholar), Leu-290 is the first residue of β-strand 5 at the bottom of the α/β barrel. As such, it is relatively far from the active site residues that coordinate with the transition-state analog carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate (10Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Google Scholar, 12Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Google Scholar). It was previously suggested (1Spreitzer R.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 411-434Google Scholar) that the L290F substitution may disrupt the hydrophobic core of the α/β barrel by affecting a hydrogen bond network that extends from Glu-168 (at the bottom of the α/β barrel) to active-site His-327 (at the base of flexible loop 6) (10Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Google Scholar). Because the 68-4PP (L290F) mutation gives rise to a temperature-conditional, acetate-requiring phenotype in vivo (21Spreitzer R.J. Al-Abed S.R. Huether M.J. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1988; 86: 773-777Google Scholar, 22Chen Z. Chastain C.J. Al-Abed S.R. Chollet R. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4696-4699Google Scholar), it was possible to select for complementing mutations at the 35°C restrictive temperature. Past genetic studies with Chlamydomonas Rubisco have identified compensatory substitutions at residues that are often in van der Waals contact with the original mutant residues (16Chen Z. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3051-3053Google Scholar, 17Chen Z. Yu W. Lee J.H. Diao R. Spreitzer R.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8846-8850Google Scholar, 18Thow G. Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5109-5114Google Scholar). However, second-site substitutions that complement L290F were found to be relatively distant. Either a V262L or A222T substitution produces a moderate increase in the amount of L290F mutant Rubisco at 35°C (Table I) and, more significantly, restores Ω to the wild-type value (Table II). Because the V262L and A222T substitutions both increase the volume of the affected residues, it seems unlikely that they compensate for the increase in size caused by the original L290F mutant substitution. Furthermore, based on the x-ray crystal structure of spinach Rubisco (10Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Google Scholar, 12Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Google Scholar), neither of these phylogenetically conserved residues resides in the Rubisco active site. Ala-222 (in the middle of α-helix 2) is more than 10 Å away from the atoms of Leu-290. Whereas Val-262 (below β-strand 4) appears to be close to Leu-290 (bottom of β-strand 5), the side chains of these two residues are oriented away from each other. Instead, Val-262 is in van der Waals contact with Ala-222 (10Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Google Scholar, 12Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Google Scholar). These “long-distance” interactions relative to residue 290 are interesting, especially considering that residues 222, 262, and 290 are close to residues of the Rubisco small subunit (10Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Google Scholar, 12Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Google Scholar). In spinach Rubisco, a small subunit hairpin loop (residues 46-67 flanked by β-strands A and B) is in close contact with large subunit residues at the bottom of the α/β barrel (10Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Google Scholar). Cyanobacterial Rubisco lacks 12 residues of this loop (residues 52-63), whereas Chlamydomonas Rubisco contains 6 additional residues (see Ref. 1Spreitzer R.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 411-434Google Scholar for review). Because Ω values also diverge among these species, it is interesting to consider whether the small subunit hairpin loop might contribute to the enhanced catalytic efficiency of eukaryotic Rubisco (10Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Google Scholar, 20Newman J. Gutteridge S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25876-25886Google Scholar). With regard to the crystal structure of spinach Rubisco (10Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Google Scholar, 12Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Google Scholar) and as shown in Fig. 1, the L290F substitution could place residue 290 in van der Waals contact with small subunit residues Gly-60 and Tyr-62 (Leu-66 and Tyr-68 in Chlamydomonas Rubisco, respectively). Furthermore, the backbone atoms of large subunit Val-262 are likely to be in van der Waals contact with the Cα, Cβ, and Cγ atoms of the spinach small subunit Pro-59 (Cys-65 in the Chlamydomonas enzyme), which is located at the tip of the small subunit hairpin loop (10Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The Cβ atom of large subunit Ala-222 is also in van der Waals contact with one of the Cϵ atoms of spinach small subunit Tyr-61 (Tyr-67 in the Chlamydomonas enzyme). However, this tyrosyl residue resides in a second neighboring small subunit (10Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In conclusion, it seems possible that the V262L and A222T large subunit substitutions could complement the L290F substitution via interactions transmitted through the Rubisco small subunit (Fig. 1). Perhaps these interactions at the interface between large and small subunits contribute to both the structural stability (Table I) and catalytic efficiency (Table II) of Rubisco. Directed mutagenesis of pea rbcS followed by in vitro synthesis and transport into isolated chloroplasts indicated that Arg-53 in the small subunit hairpin loop is required for holoenzyme assembly (33Flachmann R. Bohnert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10576-10582Google Scholar). In spinach Rubisco (10Knight S. Andersson I. Brändén C.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 113-160Google Scholar, 12Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Google Scholar) this arginyl residue (Arg-59 in the Chlamydomonas enzyme) hydrogen bonds with large subunit Tyr-226, which is also in van der Waals contact with the side chain atoms of Ala-222 and Val-262. Such observations further support the idea that substitutions at Ala-222 and Val-262 may also influence the interactions between large and small subunits. When a hybrid Rubisco enzyme comprised of cyanobacterial large subunits and diatom small subunits was expressed in Escherichia coli, it was found to have an Ω value intermediate to the Ω values of the native cyanobacterial and diatom holoenzymes (34Read B.A. Tabita F.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5553-5559Google Scholar). Thus, even though the hybrid enzyme had substantial decreases in Vc and Vc/Kc (34Read B.A. Tabita F.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5553-5559Google Scholar), these results indicate that small subunits can contribute to the catalytic efficiency of Rubisco. Considering that substitutions at large subunit residues 290, 222, and 262 can influence Ω (Table II), perhaps the nearby small subunit residues (Fig. 1) could also play a role in determining the catalytic efficiency of Rubisco. Most of the revertants recovered from mutant 68-4PP in this and a previous study (24Chen Z. Green D. Westhoff C. Spreitzer R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 60-67Google Scholar) arose from nuclear suppressor mutations. One of these revertants has been analyzed in detail (23Chen Z. Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. Plant Physiol. (Rockv.). 1993; 101: 1189-1194Google Scholar, 24Chen Z. Green D. Westhoff C. Spreitzer R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 60-67Google Scholar), but the nuclear suppressor mutation does not reside in either of the two rbcS genes (24Chen Z. Green D. Westhoff C. Spreitzer R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 60-67Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the idea that small subunits can act as a bridge between L290F and the complementing V262L and A222T substitutions would imply that substitutions in the small subunit may also complement the original 68-4PP (L290F) mutation. Further study of the existing nuclear suppressors will test this hypothesis. Because the L290F, A222T, and V262L substitutions can influence Rubisco Ω (Table II) and may do so by influencing the structure of the large subunit/small subunit interface (Fig. 1), it would be interesting to examine the effect of nearby small subunit substitutions on Rubisco catalysis. However, it has not been possible to create such substitutions via directed mutagenesis because prokaryotic Rubisco enzymes lack either the small subunit or the small subunit hairpin loop (see Ref. 1Spreitzer R.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 411-434Google Scholar for review), and eukaryotes contain a family of rbcS genes that precludes transformation of mutant genes (see Refs. 1Spreitzer R.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 411-434Google Scholar and 8Dean C. Pichersky E. Dunsmuir P. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 40: 415-439Google Scholar for review). Only recently has a mutant strain of Chlamydomonas been recovered that lacks the rbcS gene family (35Khrebtukova I. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13689-13693Google Scholar). Because the rbcS deletion mutant can be transformed with a single rbcS gene (35Khrebtukova I. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13689-13693Google Scholar), it may soon be possible to directly investigate the potential role of small subunit residues 65, 66, 67, and 68 in Rubisco catalysis. We thank Carolyn M. O'Brien for performing Western analysis. Rubisco antibody was generously supplied by Dr. Raymond Chollet."
https://openalex.org/W2061001987,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) treatment causes a profound down-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptors during the differentiation of PC12 cells. This process is characterized by a progressive decrease in epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor level measured by <sup>125</sup>I-EGF binding, tyrosine phosphorylation, and Western blotting. Treatment of the cells with NGF for 5 days produces a 95% reduction in the amount of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine-labeled EGF receptors.

NGF-induced heterologous down-regulation, but not EGF-induced homologous down-regulation of EGF receptors, is blocked in Ras- and Src-dominant-negative PC12 cells. Treatment with either pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) or staurosporine stimulates neurite outgrowth in PC12 cell variants, but neither induces down-regulation of EGF receptors. NGF treatment of PC12 cells in suspension induces down-regulation of EGF receptors in the absence of neurite outgrowth. These results strongly suggest a p140<sup>trk</sup>-, Ras- and Src-dependent mechanism of NGF-induced down-regulation of EGF receptors and separate this process from NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells."
