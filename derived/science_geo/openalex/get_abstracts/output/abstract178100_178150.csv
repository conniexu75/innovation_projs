https://openalex.org/W2037541952,"Eukaryotic heterochromatin is characterized by a high density of repeats and transposons, as well as by modified histones, and influences both gene expression and chromosome segregation. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe , we deleted the argonaute, dicer, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene homologs, which encode part of the machinery responsible for RNA interference (RNAi). Deletion results in the aberrant accumulation of complementary transcripts from centromeric heterochromatic repeats. This is accompanied by transcriptional de-repression of transgenes integrated at the centromere, loss of histone H3 lysine-9 methylation, and impairment of centromere function. We propose that double-stranded RNA arising from centromeric repeats targets formation and maintenance of heterochromatin through RNAi."

https://openalex.org/W1997879915,"A current view is that cytotoxic stress, such as DNA damage, induces apoptosis by regulating the permeability of mitochondria. Mitochondria sequester several proteins that, if released, kill by activating caspases, the proteases that disassemble the cell. Cytokines activate caspases in a different way, by assembling receptor complexes that activate caspases directly; in this case, the subsequent mitochondrial permeabilization accelerates cell disassembly by amplifying caspase activity. We found that cytotoxic stress causes activation of caspase-2, and that this caspase is required for the permeabilization of mitochondria. Therefore, we argue that cytokine-induced and stress-induced apoptosis act through conceptually similar pathways in which mitochondria are amplifiers of caspase activity rather than initiators of caspase activation."

The reactivity of each sugar was dependent on the extent to which it exists in the open (carbonyl) structure rather than in the ring (hemiacetal or hemiketal) structure. Among the 15 monosaccharides tested, aldoses showed higher reactivities than ketoses. Glucose was the least reactive of the aldohexoses. The emergence of glucose as the primary metabolic fuel may be due in part to the high stability of its ring structure which limits potentially deleterious nonenzymatic glycosylation of proteins."

We identified a variant of the cardiac sodium channel gene SCN5A that is associated with arrhythmia in African Americans (P = 0.000028) and linked with arrhythmia risk in an African-American family (P = 0.005). In transfected cells, the variant allele (Y1102) accelerated channel activation, increasing the likelihood of abnormal cardiac repolarization and arrhythmia. About 13.2% of African Americans carry the Y1102 allele. Because Y1102 has a subtle effect on risk, most carriers will never have an arrhythmia. However, Y1102 may be a useful molecular marker for the prediction of arrhythmia susceptibility in the context of additional acquired risk factors such as the use of certain medications."

Jaws are principally derived from the branchial arches, embryonic structures that exhibit proximodistal polarity. To investigate the mechanisms that specify the identity of skeletal elements within the arches, we examined mice lacking expression of Dlx5 and Dlx6, linked homeobox genes expressed distally but not proximally within the arches. Dlx5/6-/- mutants exhibit a homeotic transformation of lower jaws to upper jaws. We suggest that nested Dlx expression in the arches patterns their proximodistal axes. Evolutionary acquisition and subsequent refinement of jaws may have been dependent on modification of Dlx expression."

https://openalex.org/W2016364188,"Most Ras proteins are posttranslationally modified by a palmitoyl lipid moiety through a thioester linkage. However, the mechanism by which this occurs is not known. Here, evidence is presented that the Ras2 protein of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> is palmitoylated by a Ras protein acyltransferase (Ras PAT) encoded by the <i>ERF2</i> and <i>ERF4</i> genes. Erf2p is a 41-kDa protein localized to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and contains a conserved DHHC cysteine-rich domain (DHHC-CRD). Erf2p co-purifies with Erf4p (26 kDa) when it is expressed in yeast or in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. The Erf2p/Erf4p complex is required for Ras PAT activity, and mutations within conserved residues (Cys<sup>189</sup>, His<sup>201</sup>, and Cys<sup>203</sup>) of the Erf2p DHHC-CRD domain abolish Ras PAT activity. Furthermore, a palmitoyl-Erf2p intermediate is detected suggesting that Erf2p is directly involved in palmitate transfer.<i>ERF2</i> and <i>ERF4</i> are the first genes identified that encode a palmitoyltransferase for a Ras GTPase."

We examined the consequences of this variation in a long-term study of lions in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. Mane darkness indicates nutrition and testosterone and influences both female choice and male-male competition. Mane length signals fighting success and only appears to influence male-male assessment. Dark-maned males enjoy longer reproductive life-spans and higher offspring survival, but they suffer higher surface temperatures, abnormal sperm, and lower food intake during hot months of the year. Maned males are hotter than females, and males have lighter and/or shorter manes in hotter seasons, years, and habitats. This phenotypic plasticity suggests that the mane will respond to forecasted increases in ambient temperature."

Insulin granule exocytosis occurred mainly toward the interstitial space, away from blood vessels. The fusion pore was unusually stable with a lifetime of 1.8 seconds. Opening of the 1.4-nanometer-diameter pore was preceded by unrestricted lateral diffusion of lipids along the inner wall of the pore, supporting the idea that this structure is composed of membrane lipids. When the pore dilated to 12 nanometers, the granules rapidly flattened and discharged their contents. Thus, our methodology reveals fusion pore dynamics in intact tissues at nanometer resolution."

Ligand binding induces conformational changes that coordinately dissociates corepressors and recruits coactivators to enhance transcriptional activity (1Chawla A. Repa J.J. Evans R.M.

Physiologically relevant ligands, which are known for less than half of the 48 nuclear receptors encoded by the human genome, include the steroid hormones, retinoids, thyroid hormone, vitamin D3, and fatty acids. HNF4α is considered to be an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily because its endogenous ligand is not known (3Sladek F.M. Seidel S.D. Burris T.P. McCabe E.R.B. Nuclear Receptors in Genetic Disease. Academic Press, London2001: 309-361Google Scholar). Originally identified in liver, HNF4α is also present in kidney, gut, and pancreatic islets. It functions in transcriptional cascades, downstream of TGF-β-activated SMAD signaling and GATA and HNF3/forkhead family transcription factors and upstream of the HNF1α/POU homeodomain transcription factor. In addition to HNF1α, the many target genes for HNF4α in liver include coagulation factors and proteins involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and transport. Selective targets present in kidney and intestine include erythropoietin and intestinal fatty acid binding protein, respectively. Targeted disruption of Hnf4α in mice leads to defective gastrulation, underscoring an important role for HNF4α in the developing gut (4Chen W.S. Manova K. Weinstein D.C. Duncan S.A. Plump A.S.

In humans, the clinically apparent phenotype associated with Hnf4α mutations is a Mendelian form of diabetes mellitus associated with abnormalities in lipoprotein and lipid concentrations (5Yamagata K.

Fleisher M. Assmann G. Fajans S.S. Stoffel M. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 832-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Positional cloning methods revealed the relationship between HNF4α and an atypical form of diabetes referred to as maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY1) (5Yamagata K. Furuta H. Oda N. Kaisaki P.J. Menzel S. Cox N.J. Fajans S.S. Signorini S. Stoffel M. Bell G.I. Nature. 1996; 384: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Mutations in at least six distinct genes have been linked to MODY (7Fajans S.S. Bell G.I. Polonsky K.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Although MODY1 is rare (<20 families have been identified) (5Yamagata K. Furuta H. Oda N. Kaisaki P.J. Menzel S. Cox N.J. Fajans S.S. Signorini S. Stoffel M. Bell G.I.

Like other forms of MODY, MODY1 is characterized by autosomal-dominant inheritance, early onset (<25 years of age), and abnormal pancreatic β cell function. Because reduced β cell function leads to insulin deficiency, it is reasonable to conclude that HNF4α activity is tightly coupled with insulin synthesis and secretion. Since nuclear receptors are an established and valuable class of drug targets, it follows that selective agonists for HNF4α might be useful as new therapeutic strategies for improving insulin secretion in MODY patients and potentially others with more prevalent forms of type 2 diabetes. To learn more about how HNF4α functions in health and disease, and as an important step in drug discovery, we have crystallized the ligand binding domain (LBD)1 of HNF4α and solved its three-dimensional structure. HNF4α forms an antiparallel, three-layered α helical sandwich akin to other nuclear receptor LBDs. The serendipitous presence of a tightly associated fatty acid in the binding pocket reveals potential mechanisms for ligand binding. DNA encoding the LBD of rat HNF4α (residues 133–382) was subcloned into the pET 28a vector (Novagen) by PCR. Protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Invitrogen), grown either in LB or synthetic medium containing l-selenomethionine (SeMet), and isolated from bacterial lysates using Talon cobalt affinity resin (Clontech). The His6 affinity tag was removed with bovine thrombin (10 units/ml), and the protein was further purified by ion exchange chromatography (Mono Q fast protein liquid chromatography). Crystals were obtained at room temperature by the vapor diffusion method in 10 μl of sitting drops containing equal volumes of protein (25 mg/ml) and crystallization buffer (0.1m sodium citrate (pH 8.0), 0.7 m ammonium acetate, 16% MPD (2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol), and 10 mm dithiothreitol). Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the National Synchotron Light Source, Brookhaven, NY (beamline X12C). Oscillation images were collected every 1°, and the data were integrated and scaled using the DENZO HKL software package (10Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The structure was determined using MAD phasing of SeMet-substituted protein. The expected bijvoet and dispersive differences (11Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar) based on six bound seleniums in a monomer (250 residues) were 5.90 and 3.64%, respectively. The program SOLVE (12Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) found 20 of 24 possible selenium sites. The phases were improved by 4-fold averaging and solvent flattening utilizing the programs MLPHARE and DM in the CCP4 suite (13Collaborative Computational Project 4 Acta Crystallography Sect. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab HNF4α samples (200 mg) were combined with a 10-fold excess (v:v) of 15% NaOH in 50% methanol and heated for 30 min at 100 °C. Esterification was accomplished by combining the cooled solutions with 20 volumes of 46% methanol in 6n HCl and heating for 10 min at 80 °C. The fatty acid methyl esters were extracted into 50% methyl t-butyl ether in hexane and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) (Sherlock MIS; 170–270 °C) at the Bacterial Identification and Fatty Acid Laboratory, University of Florida (plantpath.ifas.ufl. edu/fame). The amino- and carboxyl-terminal boundaries of the LBD of HNF4α were delineated from sequence comparisons with other members of the nuclear receptor family. Although we attempted to express longer versions, including the entire LBD plus F-domain (133–455), these degraded to shorter fragments. Since susceptibility to proteolysis suggested that the F-domain is at least partially disordered, we expressed and crystallized the LBD domain (133–382) by itself. Crystals belonging to the tetragonal space group P41212 (unit cell: a =b = 102.3, c = 227.7 Å) reached maximal dimensions of 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm in sitting drops within 5 days. The structure was solved using MAD phasing of selenomethionine-substituted protein (TableI). Four protein molecules are assembled in the asymmetric unit as a pair of identical homodimers. Each LBD of HNF4α contains 9–10 α helices and two β strands that adopt the helical sandwich motif common to the LBDs of nuclear receptors (Fig. 1). 194 core α carbons of the ligand binding domains from HNF4α and RXRα (Protein Data Bank number 1FBY) (16Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Ruff M. Chambon P. Moras D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a close structural relative, superimpose with a root mean square deviation of 1.26 Å. Following conventional nomenclature, α helix 2 (α2), which is variably present in nuclear receptor LBDs, is absent in HNF4α, α6 consists of a single α helical turn, and α10 and α11 are contiguous. Pro333 forces a break in α10. Acidic residues Glu261 and Asp262 create a bulge in α5 that may be important for dimerization (17Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Miller A.B. Bledsoe R.K. Milburn M.V. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Xu H.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Electron density is apparent for all residues except those at the amino (133–140) and carboxyl (368–382) termini of the domain and within the loop between α helices 1 and 3 (the 1/3 loop, residues 157–165). Although we did not add potential ligands to our crystallization trials, the initial electron density maps showed density in the ligand binding pocket of the domain that was not accounted for by the protein. The excess electron density, present in all molecules of the asymmetric unit, resembled a small molecule associated with the guanidinium group of Arg226. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization and time of flight mass spectrometric analyses of HNF4α revealed, in addition to the expected parent ion for the expressed protein, the presence of non-covalently associated saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (data not shown). To confirm the identities of the lipids and quantify relative amounts, purified HNF4α solutions were submitted for fatty acid analysis by GC. Recombinant rat HNF4α-(133–382) contained a mixture of fatty acids, including 16:0, 17:0 cyclo, 18:1ω7c, and 14:0 (Fig. 2). Similar sets of fatty acids bound a longer form of rat HNF4α containing the entire carboxyl-terminal F domain (residues 133–455, data not shown) and the LBD of human HNF4α (residues 140–382), which differs from the rat domain at seven positions (Fig. 2). These findings demonstrate that both human and rat proteins associate spontaneously with endogenous fatty acids and that the F domain does not influence binding. To determine whether the LBDs select specific fatty acids from the larger pool, we subjected E. coli BL21 cells to similar GC analyses (Fig. 2). The bacterial fatty acids present in greatest abundance also bound HNF4α, although there appears to be a degree of selectivity. For example, the fatty acids 16:0, 18:1ω7c, 16:1 iso/14:0 3OH, and 19:0 cyclo ω8c are present in greater relative abundance in the bacteria than associated with human or rat HNF4α (Fig. 2) (16:1 iso and 14:0 3OH are not distinguished by GC). In contrast, fatty acids 17:0 cyclo, 16:1 ω7c/15 iso 2OH, 15 iso 3OH, and 10:0 were bound to the protein in higher relative abundance than their presence in E. coli. Other fatty acids such as 18:1ω7c and 14:0 were neither selected for nor against (Fig. 2). Therefore, although a wide range of fatty acids were found within its ligand binding pocket, HNF4α appears to exhibit selectivity toward a subset of those found in bacteria. Future experiments with mammalian tissues are required to determine which fatty acids bind under relevant conditions and whether the capacity of HNF4α to serve as a fatty acid sensor has physiological or pathological ramifications. The fact that the fatty acids were persistently bound even after a multistep purification indicated that they were tightly associated. This was borne out by additional attempts to strip the lipids from the protein, as the fatty acids remained associated after dialysis and gel-filtration chromatography (data not shown). The serendipitous presence of fatty acids provided an opportunity to analyze how ligands bind to HNF4α. The lipid carboxyl group was readily identified next to the side chain of Arg226 and the methylene chain could be built to C12. Density beyond that point was weak, indicating that the remainder of the chain is either flexible or occupies multiple conformations. The cavity has an internal volume of 370 Å3, calculated by the program Voidoo (18Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallgor. 1994; 50: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar), which is almost entirely occupied by fatty acid. While this volume is within the normal range for nuclear receptor LBDs, the elongated, relatively linear shape of the pocket is atypical. Both oxygens of the fatty acid head group are ion-paired with the guanidinium group of Arg226, and one oxygen forms additional hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH of Gly237 and side chain OH of Ser181 (Fig. 3, Aand B). Residues that line the internal surface of the ligand binding pocket are largely hydrophobic, including those arising from α3 (Ile175, Val178, Cys179, Met182), α5 (Leu219, Leu220, Ala223), β1 (Leu234, Leu236), β2 (Val242), loop 2/7 (Leu249), α7 (Met252, Val255, Ser256, Ile259), and α10 (Met342, Gln345, Ile346, Ile349) (Fig. 3 B). In the “closed” conformation α12 of HNF4α does not contact the ligand, in contrast with other nuclear receptors where α12 in the canonical agonist-bound conformation often does contact the agonist. Although HNF4α and RXRα are similar in terms of amino acid sequence, their ligand binding specificities are distinct. This is due in part to Phe313 in RXRα, which points inward and directs bound 9-cis-retinoic acid upward toward α5 (19Bourguet W. Vivat V. Wurtz J.M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 289-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The corresponding residue in HNF4α is Ala223, which, presumably because of the decreased bulk of the side chain, allows the fatty acid ligand to curl downwards toward α7. It is thus particularly interesting to note that F313A substitution in RXRα leads to constitutive activation, due to the spontaneous binding of an endogenous fatty acid as we have seen for wild-type HNF4α (19Bourguet W. Vivat V. Wurtz J.M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 289-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The fatty acid in the binding pocket of RXRα F313A adopts a U shape, and density is interpretable out to the C18 position. In contrast, the side chains from residues Met182 and Met342 fill the upper portion of the HNF4α ligand binding pocket to prevent the fatty acid from looping around to form a U, and we don't see density past the C12 position. These two methionine residues of HNF4α are unique among nuclear receptors. The two molecules within each dimer adopt distinct conformations. In the first, referred to as the open state, α12 is fully extended and contiguous and collinear with α10 (Fig. 1). The second molecule of each homodimer adopts a closed conformation, with α12 situated against the body of the LBD. The conformation of the “open” state is fixed by crystal packing between two open forms at an axis of symmetry. In the closed state, residues Leu360, Leu361, Met364, and Leu365 form a hydrophobic face on α12 that interacts with a corresponding hydrophobic surface on the body of the domain created by residues from α3 (Met182, Lys183, Leu186, Leu187, Leu189, and Val190) and α4 (Leu211, Ala215, Gly216, and Leu219). Residues Gln362 and Glu363help to anchor α12 through hydrogen bonds with Lys350 in α10 and Arg212 in α4, respectively. Since fatty acid ligands similarly occupy the ligand binding pockets of molecules in open and closed conformations, the structural rearrangement does not appear to be required for ligand-mediated activation as has been proposed for other nuclear receptors (17Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Miller A.B. Bledsoe R.K. Milburn M.V. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Xu H.E. Mol.

It is possible that to lock the domain in its closed and active state, both ligand and coactivator must be bound, but since our structure lacks coactivator, it does not test this hypothesis. As opposed to many nuclear receptors that form heterodimers, HNF4α functions primarily as a homodimer (22Bogan A.A. Dallas-Yang Q. Ruse Jr., M.D. Maeda Y. Jiang G. Nepomuceno L. Scanlan T.S. Cohen F.E. Sladek F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 831-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the LBD of HNF4α crystallizes as a canonical homodimer with near-perfect 2-fold symmetry about the interface (Fig.3 C). A 1156-Å2 surface of each monomer is buried at the dimer interface. A coiled coil interaction between α10 from each molecule dominates the interface, with hydrophobic side chain-side chain interactions (Phe325:Phe325, Leu329:Leu329, Leu330:Ile283, Leu332:Leu330, Pro333:Pro333 and Trp340:Trp340) along its length (Fig.3 C). Intermolecular salt bridges (Glu269:Lys300, Arg303:Glu327, and Arg322:Asp312) and hydrogen bonds (Gln307:Glu327, Glu311:Gly323, and Gln336:Gln336) appear to contribute to the stability of the interface. Of 14 mutations in HNF4α that have been found in patients with the MODY1 form of diabetes (5Yamagata K. Furuta H. Oda N. Kaisaki P.J. Menzel S. Cox N.J. Fajans S.S. Signorini S. Stoffel M. Bell G.I.

Endocrinol. 2001; 27: 11-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), three encode substitutions within the LBD (V255M, E276Q, R324H). The side chain of Val255 (in α7) points into the ligand binding cavity where it participates in ligand recognition. While questions have been raised about functional consequences of the V255M substitution (24Navas M.A. Munoz-Elias E.J. Kim J. Shih D. Stoffel M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1459-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the structure suggests that a methionine side chain at this position would partially occlude the ligand binding cavity and potentially alter binding affinity or specificity. Contact between Val255 and backbone atoms of α10 in the vicinity of Met342 is also predicted to stabilize the protein fold. Therefore, the V255M substitution might also decrease protein stability and reduce its concentration in cells or ability to homodimerize. Side chains from the other two MODY1-associated residues, Glu276(amino terminus of α8) and Arg324 (9/10 loop), form an ionic interaction, and Glu276 forms a second ionic interaction with Arg317 (also in the 9/10 loop). Neither of these residues is involved directly in ligand binding, but mutations in them may influence dimerization. While the residues themselves are not at the dimer interface, the 9/10 loops of two molecules interact with each other. Since the residues help tether the 9/10 loops, it is likely that loss of interactions between Glu276 and Arg324 would destabilize dimerization. The LBD of HNF4α is structurally similar to the LBDs of other nuclear receptors. The presence of a fatty acid in its ligand binding pocket is especially noteworthy and should help resolve the controversy surrounding putative ligands for HNF4α. From a structural point of view, the fatty acid appears to be an ideally suited ligand for HNF4α. The carboxylic acid headgroup of the fatty acid ion pairs with the guanidinium group of Arg226 of the protein to fix the orientation, while the aliphatic portion of the fatty acid occupies a long narrow pocket that is lined with hydrophobic side chains. Considering this mode of binding, it is not obvious how more complex ligands might bind HNF4α. It is thus reasonable to presume that fatty acids or related molecules might be the endogenous ligands for HNF4α. The high apparent affinity of recombinant HNF4α for fatty acids suggests a similar situation for the native protein in mammalian cells, providing a mechanism for HNF4α to function as a biosensor for fatty acids within the cell. The structural features of fatty acid binding to HNF4α provide a useful starting point for identifying potential pharmacophores, but the search may prove all the more challenging due to the kinetics of ligand binding."

The first diffraction peak was followed from the high- to the low-density amorphous form. Changes were observed to occur through a series of intermediate forms that appear to be metastable at each anneal temperature. Five distinct amorphous forms were studied with neutron scattering, and many more forms may be possible. Radial distribution functions indicate that the structure evolves systematically between 4 and 8 angstroms.

A signal from the follicle cells keeps the oocyte cell cycle arrested at prophase of meiosis I until luteinizing hormone from the pituitary acts on the follicle cells to release the arrest, causing meiosis to continue. Here we show that meiotic arrest can be released in mice by microinjecting the oocyte within the follicle with an antibody that inhibits the stimulatory heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein Gs. This indicates that Gs activity in the oocyte is required to maintain meiotic arrest within the ovarian follicle and suggests that the follicle may keep the cell cycle arrested by activating Gs."

Transfection of McArdle hepatoma cells (that lack PEMT) with PEMT cDNA enhanced secretion of TG in the VLDLs.

Huntsman M.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1932; 75: 405-412Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A major phenotype of choline deficiency was the accumulation of lipid in the liver. Subsequently, a defect in the secretion of lipid from the livers of choline-deficient animals was reported (reviewed in Ref. 2Kuksis A. Mookerjea S. Nutr. Rev. 1978; 36: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This apparent defect in lipoprotein secretion would be expected to account for at least some of the accumulating hepatic triacylglycerol (TG)1 in choline-deficient animals and was proposed to be due to impaired phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis via the CDP-choline pathway. Advances in hepatocyte culture and lipoprotein isolation permitted a more rigorous evaluation of the role of PC biosynthesis in lipoprotein secretion in the 1980s. Experiments have demonstrated that indeed PC biosynthesis was required for secretion of very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs), but not high density lipoproteins, from primary cultures of rat hepatocytes (3Yao Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2998-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of choline, there was a decrease in secretion of lipids, apolipoprotein (apo) B48, and apoB100 associated with VLDL. A striking decrease in apoB100 and apoB48 in VLDL was also observed in the plasma of choline-deficient rats (4Yao Z. Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrated that the requirement for choline was specific, and neither monomethylethanolamine nor dimethylethanolamine would substitute (5Yao Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11373-11380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, lyso-PC was able to substitute for choline for the secretion of apoB48, TG, and PC (6Robinson B.S. Yao Z. Baisted D.J. Vance D.E. J. Biochem. 1989; 260: 207-214Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The requirement for PC biosynthesis was observed only when the apoB-containing particles contained a neutral lipid core because PC biosynthesis was not required for secretion of truncated apoBs, such as apoB18 or apoB23, that are secreted from hepatoma cells without significant neutral lipid (7Vermeulen P.S. Lingrell S. Yao Z. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 447-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mechanistic studies indicated that choline deficiency reduced the number of nascent VLDL particles in the Golgi, but not in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (8Verkade H.J. Fast D.G. Rusiñol A.E. Scraba D.G. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24990-24996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These nascent VLDL particles were subsequently shown to be deficient in PC in the Golgi and to a lesser extent in the ER (9Fast D.G. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1258: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The data suggested that many of the nascent particles were degraded in a post-ER compartment (9Fast D.G. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1258: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition to the CDP-choline pathway, the liver has a secondary pathway for PC biosynthesis in which phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is converted to PC by three successive transmethylation reactions catalyzed by phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) (10Vance D.E. Ridgway N.D. Prog. Lipid Res. 1988; 27: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Several approaches have indicated that ∼30% of the PC in liver is made via the PEMT pathway, whereas the remainder is synthesized via the CDP-choline pathway (11Sundler R. Åkesson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3359-3367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Delong C.J. Shen Y.-J. Thomas M.J. Cui Z. J. Biol.

Acta. 2002; 1580: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The PEMT pathway may substitute for the CDP-choline pathway in lipoprotein secretion because supplementation of choline-deficient hepatocytes with methionine (required for the methylation reactions) restored the secretion of TG, apoB48, and apoB100 (3Yao Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2998-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reciprocal question (can the CDP-choline pathway substitute for the PEMT pathway in VLDL secretion?) has been addressed by the use of inhibitors of PE methylation. An inhibitor of transmethylation reactions involving S-adenosylmethionine is 3-deazaadenosine (DZA) (14Chiang P.K. Cantoni G.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1979; 28: 1897-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). DZA effectively inhibits the PEMT reaction in hepatocytes (15Prichard P.H. Chiang P.K. Cantoni G.L. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6362-6367PubMed Google Scholar) without altering the secretion of labeled apoB48 or apoB100 (16Vance J.E. Nguyen T.M. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 875: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, it seemed that the methylation pathway for PC biosynthesis was not required for VLDL secretion and that the CDP-choline pathway was sufficient. However, the interpretation of these results is complex. DZA potently inhibited the labeling of PC from PE derived from the CDP-ethanolamine pathway in both cells and secreted lipoproteins (16Vance J.E. Nguyen T.M. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 875: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, although DZA effectively inhibited the labeling of PC from PE derived from the mitochondrial decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine in hepatocytes, the amount of labeled PC secreted into the medium was not significantly decreased by DZA treatment of hepatocytes (17Vance J.E. Vance D.E. FEBS Lett. 1986; 204: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Consequently, we were unable to conclude that the PEMT pathway could be completely compensated by the CDP-choline pathway in providing PC for lipoprotein secretion. Other inhibitors of PEMT, the peroxisomal proliferators bezafibrate and clofibric acid, did not inhibit the secretion of apoB48 or B100 but did reduce the lipidation and increase the density of apoB48-containing lipoproteins (18Nishimaki-Mogami T. Suzuki K. Okochi E. Takahashi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1304: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 19Nishimaki-Mogami T. Suzuki K. Takahashi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1304: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Use of an inhibitor for metabolic studies is always subject to the reservation that the compound may not be completely specific. More recently, we have been able to take advantage of targeted gene disruption in mice to specifically block the PEMT pathway of PC synthesis (20Walkey C.J. Donohue L.R. Bronson R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12880-12885Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These mice displayed no obviously abnormal phenotype. Hepatocyte morphology was normal, as were plasma lipid levels and bile composition (20Walkey C.J. Donohue L.R. Bronson R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12880-12885Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, when male Pemt −/− mice were fed a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet, plasma TG was 50% less than that in Pemt +/+ mice indicating a possible defect in lipoprotein secretion. 2A. A. Noga and D. E. Vance, unpublished results. We therefore investigated lipoprotein secretion from hepatocytes derived from Pemt −/− mice. The results show that in the absence of PEMT, the secretion of apoB100, but not apoB48, particles from cultured hepatocytes is decreased by ∼70%. Furthermore, reconstitution of PEMT activity in McArdle RH-7777 hepatoma cells stimulated TG and apoB100 secretion, validating the results observed in the Pemt −/− hepatocytes. Because the CDP-choline pathway is enhanced in Pemt −/− mice (20Walkey C.J. Donohue L.R. Bronson R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12880-12885Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and normally expressed in the McArdle cells, we suggest that the PEMT pathway for PC biosynthesis has an unexpected role in apoB100 secretion from hepatocytes. Hank's balanced salt solutions, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), methionine-deficient DMEM, and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen. Collagen, collagenase, insulin, bovine serum albumin, oleate, phospholipase C fromClostridium welchii, and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B were purchased from Sigma. Silica Gel G60 plates for thin-layer chromatography were from Merck, whereas PC and triolein standards were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). [3H]Oleate, [35S]methionine, and [methyl-3H]methionine were obtained fromAmersham Biosciences. The sheep anti-human apoB antibody used in immunoprecipitations was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. McArdle RH-7777 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Other chemicals and reagents were purchased from standard commercial sources. The Pemt −/−mice had a mixed genetic background of 129/J and C57BL/6 (20Walkey C.J. Donohue L.R. Bronson R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12880-12885Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and were maintained via homozygous breeding in a reversed 12-h light/12-h dark cycle on a regular rodent chow from LabDiet (PICO Lab Rodent Diet 20). For all experiments, 12- to 20-week-old malePemt −/− and Pemt +/+ mice were utilized. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from the livers using the collagenase perfusion technique as described previously (21Klaunig J.E. Goldblatt P.J. Hinton D.E. Lipsky M.M. Trump B.F. In Vitro. 1981; 17: 913-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 22Klaunig J.E. Goldblatt P.J. Hinton D.E. Lipsky M.M. Trump B.F. In Vitro. 1981; 17: 926-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The cells were isolated and plated in DMEM containing 17% fetal bovine serum and 0.01 mg/ml insulin. Primary cultures were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells on collagen-coated 60-mm dishes. The cells were allowed to adhere for 2 h, and then the medium was replaced to remove dead cells. In all cases, hepatocytes were isolated in the late afternoon and allowed to settle overnight in the above-mentioned medium. For all experiments, the cells were washed twice over a minimum 1-h period in serum- and hormone-free DMEM followed by the experimental procedure. The McArdle cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 10% (v/v) horse serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2incubator. The construction of the PEMT expression plasmid pCI-hPEMT and the creation of stable cell lines has been described previously (23Walkey C.J. Shields D.J. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method with either pCI-hPEMT or pCI vector and pSV2Neo vector encoding neomycin resistance. Stable colonies were selected in culture medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 and maintained in medium containing 200 μg/ml G418. Protein determination was performed using the Pierce BCA kit or the Coomassie Blue system (Bio-Rad), with bovine serum albumin as a standard. PEMT assays were performed as described previously using phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine as a substrate (24Ridgway N.D. Vance D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were isolated from two mice of each genotype, pooled, and plated together. The cells were incubated in 2 ml of serum- and hormone-free DMEM in either the presence of 0.75 mm oleate + 1% (w/v) albumin or 1% albumin alone. Cells and media were harvested at 0, 6, and 12 h. For each sample, four dishes were pooled. Lipids were extracted from the media using a modified Bligh and Dyer protocol (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the samples were loaded onto thin-layer plates and resolved using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (25:15:4:2) until the solvent reached halfway up the plate. The solvent was evaporated, and the neutral lipids were separated using heptane/diisopropyl ether/acetic acid (60:40:4) that migrated to the top of the plate. PC was determined via a lipid phosphorus assay (26Zhou X. Arthur G. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1233-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and TG was measured using the hydroxylamine procedure (27Snyder F. Stephens N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 34: 244-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The cells were scraped into 8 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and centrifuged, and the cellular pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and sonicated. Lipids were extracted from cells containing 1 mg of protein and resolved by thin-layer chromatography. McArdle cells at a density of 3 × 106 cells/100-mm dish were incubated in serum-free DMEM containing 0.1 mmethanolamine and 0.4 mm oleate-bovine serum albumin for 20 h. The lipids were extracted and digested with phospholipase C, and the resulting triacylglycerol was analyzed by gas liquid chromatography. Hepatocytes from one mouse of each genotype were isolated. After an overnight incubation, the cells were rinsed twice over a 2-h period with serum-free DMEM. Cells were radiolabeled with 10 μCi [3H]oleate/dish in the presence of 0.75 mmoleate and 1% albumin for 12 h. Media and cells were harvested, and lipoproteins were isolated by ultracentrifugation (28Chung B.H. Segrest J.P. Ray M.J. Brunzell J.D. Hokanson J.E. Krauss R.M. Beaudrie K. Cone J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 181-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.4 ml of media was mixed with 0.7 g of KBr and then loaded at the bottom of a Quick-seal tube and overlaid to the top with ∼3.5 ml of 0.9% NaCl (29Lehner R. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The samples were centrifuged at 416,000 ×g for 1 h in a VTi 65.2 Beckman rotor (29Lehner R. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Afterward, 0.5-ml volumes were collected from the bottom, and lipids were extracted and fractionated by thin-layer chromatography. Bands corresponding to TG and PC were scraped, and radioactivity was determined. Cells were scraped and sonicated in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) followed by protein determination. Lipids were extracted from cells containing 1 mg of protein utilizing the Bligh-Dyer method (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar), and the lipids were resolved by thin-layer chromatography, as described above. Bands corresponding to TG and PC were scraped, and radioactivity was determined. For McArdle cells, duplicate or triplicate 60-mm dishes of cells (1 × 106 cells/dish) were seeded 20 h before the start of the experiment. The cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM containing 0.1 mm ethanolamine and 0.4 mmoleate-bovine serum albumin for 30 min. The medium was replaced with DMEM that contained either 10 μCi of [3H]glycerol or 10 Ci of [methyl-3H]methionine in the presence of 0.1 mm ethanolamine and 0.4 mmoleate-bovine serum albumin for 2 h. The lipids were extracted and fractionated by thin-layer chromatography, and radioactivity was determined. For fractionation of secreted lipoproteins from McArdle cells, the procedure was as described above for hepatocytes, except that a Beckman Ti 90 rotor was used, and the samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Hepatocytes from one mouse for each genotype were incubated overnight and rinsed twice over a 2-h period with serum- and methionine-free DMEM. Cells were then incubated with 200 μCi [35S]methionine/dish for 4 h in the presence of either 0.75 mm oleate + 1% albumin or 1% albumin alone in methionine-free DMEM. Media and cells were harvested, and lipoproteins were isolated by ultracentrifugation as described above, except that 1.3 ml medium was used and mixed with 100 μl of fresh murine or rat plasma as carrier to prevent loss of radiolabeled VLDLs. ApoB48 and apoB100 were isolated by immunoprecipitation using anti-human apoB antibody. To each 500-μl fraction, 55 μl of 10× immunoprecipitation buffer (1.5 m NaCl, 0.5 mTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm EDTA, 5% Triton X-100 (v/v), and 15% SDS (w/v)) (29Lehner R. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and 5 μl of anti-human apoB were added, and the samples were mixed overnight at 4 °C. Samples (50 μl) were mixed with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. The Sepharose was pelleted for 5 min at maximum speed in a microfuge and washed twice with 1× immunoprecipitation buffer. The pellets were boiled in sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS (w/v), 20% glycerol (v/v), 10% β-mercaptoethanol (v/v), and 0.02% bromphenol blue) (30Wu X. Shang A. Hongshi J. Ginsberg H.N. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1198-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and resolved by SDS-5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, soaked in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed to film. Quantitative densitometry of the bands was performed using Image Gauge v3.0 software by Fuji. For experiments on apoB secretion from McArdle cells, the cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/60-mm dish for 20 h. The cells were incubated in serum-free and methionine-deficient DMEM containing 0.1 mm ethanolamine and 0.4 mmoleate-bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with serum-free, methionine-deficient DMEM containing 200 μCi [35S]methionine/dish in the presence of 0.1 mm ethanolamine and 0.4 mm oleate-albumin for 2 h. The medium was harvested, concentrated 5-fold by ultrafiltration, and fractionated by density gradient ultracentrifugation as described above. ApoB from each fraction was immunoprecipitated, and radioactivity was determined as described for the protocol with primary hepatocytes. Previous studies indicated that PEMT activity is not stable in primary hepatocytes derived from rat liver. 3D. E. Vance, unpublished results. Therefore, as a prelude to studies on the role of PEMT in VLDL secretion, we determined the stability of PEMT activity in murine primary hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were isolated from Pemt +/+ mice. The next morning, the cells were rinsed, incubated for 0–18 h with serum-free DMEM, harvested, and assayed for PEMT activity. PEMT activity was 1.6 nmol/min/mg cell protein at 0 h and decreased by 50% after 12 h. By 18 h, PEMT activity had decreased to 0.7 nmol/min/mg cell protein. Therefore, none of the following experiments extended beyond 12 h. Hepatocytes derived fromPemt −/− mice contain no PEMT activity (data not shown; Ref. 20Walkey C.J. Donohue L.R. Bronson R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12880-12885Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes isolated from Pemt +/+and Pemt −/− mice were incubated in the presence or absence of 0.75 mm oleate for 0, 6, or 12 h. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the absence of PEMT activity resulted in an ∼50% decrease in TG secretion compared with hepatocytes isolated from Pemt +/+ animals. PC secretion from hepatocytes from Pemt −/− mice was not impaired (Fig. 1 B). Although TG secretion was decreased by ∼50% in thePemt −/− hepatocytes compared with thePemt +/+ hepatocytes, there was no observable accumulation of TG in the Pemt −/− cells at any time point (range, 200–275 μg TG/mg cell protein). Also, no significant changes were observed in total cellular PC (range, 100–115 μg PC/mg cell protein), suggesting that the CDP-choline pathway is sufficient to maintain normal PC levels in Pemt −/−hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were isolated from Pemt −/− andPemt +/+ mice and incubated for 12 h in serum-free DMEM with 0.75 mm oleate, 1% albumin, and 10 μCi [3H]oleate/dish. The media were collected and separated into lipoprotein fractions by ultracentrifugation. Labeled TG secreted in the VLDL fraction from cells isolated fromPemt −/− animals was significantly decreased compared with that from Pemt +/+ mice (Fig.2 A). We did not observe a shift in the distribution of radiolabeled TG to more dense particles secreted by the Pemt −/− hepatocytes. Although we observed no change in secreted PC, separation of lipoprotein fractions revealed a significant decrease in [3H]oleate-labeled PC in the VLDL fraction secreted by Pemt −/−hepatocytes (Fig. 2 B). The majority of radiolabeled PC was present in the fractions with density > 1.15 g/ml, in which there were no significant differences between the two genotypes of mice. The incorporation of [3H]oleate into hepatocyte lipids derived from both genotypes of mice was the same, indicating no alteration in [3H]oleate uptake or TG or PC synthesis (Fig. 2 C). We next determined whether the secretion of apoB100 and/or apoB48 from Pemt −/−hepatocytes was also impaired. Hepatocytes were incubated with 0.75 mm oleate for 4 h in the presence of 200 μCi [35S]methionine/dish. Afterward, the medium was centrifuged to separate the lipoproteins into different density fractions, and the apoB proteins were immunoprecipitated and separated by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Fluorograms were quantitated after exposure to x-ray film. ApoB100 secretion fromPemt −/− hepatocytes was decreased, whereas apoB48 secretion was unchanged, compared with that inPemt +/+ hepatocytes (Fig.3). Quantitation of the results from four experiments demonstrates that apoB100 secretion from hepatocytes incubated with oleate was 70% less than that fromPemt +/+ hepatocytes (Fig. 3 B). In the absence of oleate, we observed a decrease in apoB100 secretion fromPemt −/− hepatocytes that approached statistical significance (p = 0.054) (Fig.4, A and B). No differences in apoB48 secretion were observed betweenPemt +/+ and Pemt−/− hepatocytes, regardless of the presence of oleate in the medium (Figs. 3 Cand 4 C).Figure 4ApoB secretion from hepatocytes in the absence of oleate. Hepatocytes from Pemt −/−and Pemt +/+ mice were isolated and treated exactly as described in Fig. 3. However, the cells were radiolabeled for 4 h with 200 μCi [35S]methionine/dish in methionine-free DMEM containing 1% albumin without oleate. A, an example of a fluorograph of apoB100 and apoB48 secreted fromPemt +/+ and Pemt −/−heptatocytes. B and C, quantitative analysis of the apoB bands was performed using Image Gauge v3.0 software, and units were normalized to cellular protein. The difference in secretion of apoB100 in the VLDL fraction between Pemt +/+ andPemt −/− hepatocytes approached significance (p = 0.054) based on a Student's t test. The data are the averages ± S.E. of four separate experiments with duplicates in each experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because it appears that the absence of PEMT caused the defect in VLDL secretion, we reasoned that expression of PEMT in cells that lacked PEMT activity might stimulate VLDL secretion. Because McArdle rat hepatoma cells have only trace levels of PEMT activity (31Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16655-16663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we transfected these cells with a cDNA encoding PEMT behind the cytomegalovirus promoter. Stable cell lines of McArdle cells were constructed that expressed PEMT (Fig. 5,A and B). The parent McArdle cells or vector-transfected cells contained negligible PEMT activity (Fig.5 A), and no immunoreactivity was detected for PEMT (Fig.5 B). In contrast, cell lines that were transfected with PEMT showed high levels of PEMT activity (Fig. 5 A) comparable with that seen in primary murine hepatocytes (1.6 nmol/min/mg protein). Moreover, strong PEMT immunoreactivity was seen for each of the cell lines that expressed PEMT (Fig. 5 B). In addition, we confirmed that the cultured cells expressed PEMT activity in culture. The transfected McArdle cells were incubated with [methyl-3H]methionine for 2 h, and then the cells were harvested, and the radioactivity incorporated into PC was measured. As evident from Fig. 5 C, radiolabel was incorporated into PC in the cells that expressed PEMT, whereas in the vector-transfected control cells, minimal radioactivity was incorporated into PC. Thus, we established McArdle cell lines that stably expressed PEMT. We next evaluated the ability of these cells to secrete TG. The cells were incubated for 20 h in the presence of 0.4 mmoleate, and the amounts of TG in the cells and medium were measured. Whereas the amount of intracellular TG was the same in cell lines that contained or lacked PEMT (Fig.6 A), cells expressing PEMT secreted approximately twice as much TG as cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 6 B). The secretion of apoB100 from PEMT-expressing McArdle cells was evaluated by incubating cells with [35S]methionine for 2 h in the presence of oleate. The medium was collected and fractionated into four different densities. ApoB was immunoprecipitated, and autoradiography was performed after SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 6 C, 1.6 times (estimated by densitometric scanning) more apoB100 was secreted in the VLDL (lowest density) fraction from cells expressing PEMT than from control cells not expressing PEMT. This result is consistent with the observation that the TG secreted by the cells expressing PEMT was greater than that from the vector-transfected control cells. We also incubated the transfected McArdle cells with [3H]glycerol for 2 h in the presence of 0.4 mm oleate, harvested the cells, and measured the amount of labeled TG in the cells, and the medium was fractionated on a density gradient. The incorporation of label into TG was similar (∼600,000 dpm/mg cell protein) in both PEMT- and vector-transfected cells. In contrast, the amount of labeled TG in the medium was ∼3-fold higher in the PEMT-transfected cells than in the control cells (Fig. 7 A). Analysis of the radioactivity in TG in fractions of different densities showed that most of this increase in [3H]TG was in the VLDL fraction (Fig. 7 B). These studies demonstrate that expression of PEMT in a cell line that has negligible PEMT activity stimulates the secretion of VLDL. The major finding in this study is that cultured hepatocytes fromPemt −/− mice incubated with oleate secrete ∼50% less TG and ∼70% less apoB100 than hepatocytes fromPemt +/+ mice. In contrast, there was no impairment in the secretion of apoB48 from Pemt −/−hepatocytes. The total amount of PC secreted was not altered inPemt −/− hepatocytes, but PC recovered in the VLDL fraction was decreased, consistent with the reduction in secreted apoB100. The theory that the defect in VLDL secretion was due to a lack of PEMT was substantiated by stable expression of PEMT in McArdle cells in which TG secretion in VLDL was enhanced. Thus, PEMT has a special function that is required for normal secretion of TG and apoB100 particles from hepatocytes. There are several potential explanations why thePemt −/− hepatocytes were defective in VLDL secretion, yet VLDL secretion from rat hepatocytes was not inhibited by DZA, a potent inhibitor of transmethylation reactions (16Vance J.E. Nguyen T.M. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 875: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). First, in the present studies, a more pronounced decrease in apoB100 and TG secretion was observed in Pemt −/− hepatocytes when oleate was added to the medium. However, oleate was not present in the medium of the experiments using DZA (16Vance J.E. Nguyen T.M. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 875: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Nishimaki-Mogami T. Suzuki K. Takahashi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1304: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Second, in the present studies, we used male mice, whereas the DZA studies were performed with hepatocytes derived from female rats. Third, a PE methylation reaction that was insensitive to DZA produced some of the PC that was used for VLDL secretion (17Vance J.E. Vance D.E. FEBS Lett. 1986; 204: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), whereas in the current experiments, all PE methylation activity was completely abolished. Finally, the fact that DZA is a nonspecific inhibitor affecting many pathways may also have influenced the results. Our data also contrast with studies using fibrates as inhibitors of PEMT in which apoB48 in the VLDL fraction was decreased. However, in these studies (18Nishimaki-Mogami T. Suzuki K. Okochi E. Takahashi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1304: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 19Nishimaki-Mogami T. Suzuki K. Takahashi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1304: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), oleate was not added to the medium, and the hepatocytes were derived from female rats. It is also possible that the fibrates elicited other nonspecific effects unrelated to inhibition of PEMT. Although total cellular PC was unchanged in the Pemt −/− hepatocytes (data not shown), it is possible that phospholipid ratios have been disrupted within specific organelles important for apoB secretion such as the ER and the Golgi. Previous studies performed on choline-deficient rats demonstrated that in the absence of sufficient levels of PC, the VLDL particles were degraded in a post-ER compartment (8Verkade H.J. Fast D.G. Rusiñol A.E. Scraba D.G. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24990-24996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In-depth analysis of phospholipid levels in the livers after subcellular fractionation showed that PC/PE ratios had been significantly disrupted in the ER and the Golgi of these choline-deficient animals, resulting in the formation of abnormal VLDL particles (9Fast D.G. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1258: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, there are several reasons to think that the reduction in apoB100 secretion from Pemt −/− hepatocytes is not simply a result of decreased PC biosynthesis or amount of PC. First, in the livers of Pemt −/− mice, the CDP-choline pathway is up-regulated, and PC levels are normal (20Walkey C.J. Donohue L.R. Bronson R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12880-12885Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Also, the total amount of PC secreted by hepatocytes derived from these livers is not decreased (Fig. 1 B). Finally, if insufficient PC were made by the CDP-choline pathway, then the secretion of both apoB100 and apoB48 would be expected to be decreased, as was observed in choline/methionine-deficient hepatocytes (3Yao Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2998-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of recent studies suggest that not only the quantity of PC but also the targeting, turnover, and fatty acid composition of PC are important for optimum VLDL assembly. Hepatocytes isolated from apoB transgenic/phospholipid transfer protein-deficient mice also exhibited reduced VLDL secretion (32Jiang X.-C. Qin S. Qiao C. Kawano K. Lin M. Skold A. Xiao X. Tall A.R. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). From these studies, it was hypothesized that transfer of phospholipid to apoB in the Golgi was a necessary remodeling step prior to VLDL secretion. In another study, the prevention of PC hydrolysis in hepatoma cells with an inhibitor of Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 also resulted in an impaired secretion of VLDL particles (33Tran K. Wang Y. Delong C.J. Cui Z. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25023-25030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of these cells with oleate, but not with n-3 fatty acids, restored normal VLDL secretion, suggesting that remodeling of the acyl chains of the PC molecule itself is important for VLDL assembly (33Tran K. Wang Y. Delong C.J. Cui Z. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25023-25030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Other experiments in hepatoma cells indicated that PC turnover via the actions of phospholipase D was necessary for the addition of TG to apoB (34Asp L. Claesson C. Boren J. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26285-26292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is important to note, however, that in all these studies, secretion of both apoB100 and apoB48 was impaired (32Jiang X.-C. Qin S. Qiao C. Kawano K. Lin M. Skold A. Xiao X. Tall A.R. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 33Tran K. Wang Y. Delong C.J. Cui Z. Yao Z. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26285-26292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), whereas in our studies on PEMT-deficient hepatocytes, we observed an inhibition of apoB100 secretion, but not apoB48 secretion. One model system that has a defect in apoB100 secretion similar to that observed inPemt −/− mice is mice in which the microsomal TG transfer protein (MTP) gene was ablated in murine liver (35Raabe M. Véniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H. Björkegren J. Nielsen L. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 36Chang B.H. Liao W., Li, L. Nakamuta M. Mack D. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6051-6055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). MTP has been shown to transfer TG and PC between membranes in vitro (37Jamil H. Dickson J.K. Chu C.-H. Lago M.W. Rinehart J.K. Biller S.A. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6549-6554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the absence of hepatic MTP activity, the major defect was in the secretion of apoB100-containing lipoproteins, with only a small decrement in the amount of apoB48 secreted. Thus, perhaps a common defect in the livers of Pemt −/− mice and MTP-deficient mice is the inability to transfer a specific pool of PC to nascent apoB100 for VLDL assembly. Alternatively, the lipoprotein secretion defect in MTP−/− andPemt −/− hepatocytes might result from a reduction in the availability of TG. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the secretion defect in Pemt −/−hepatocytes is more pronounced when the culture medium is supplemented with oleate. Furthermore, it is well established that MTP plays a role in the maintenance of TG pools accessible for VLDL secretion (35Raabe M. Véniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H. Björkegren J. Nielsen L. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 38Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27793-27800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). PEMT has been localized to lipid droplets in rat liver (39Lehner R. Cui Z. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), thus PEMT and MTP might act cooperatively in maintaining these pools of TG. Nevertheless, Pemt −/− and MTP−/−hepatocytes do not exhibit exactly the same defect in lipoprotein secretion. In the absence of MTP, the secretion of apoB100 is virtually completely abolished, whereas apoB100 secretion from hepatocytes fromPemt −/− mice is decreased ∼70%. Moreover, the density (i.e. the extent of lipidation) of apoB48 particles secreted from Pemt −/− hepatocytes is the same as that in Pemt +/+ hepatocytes, whereas in MTP−/− hepatocytes, the apoB48-containing particles are less lipidated than those in MTP+/+ hepatocytes. Therefore, the observations outlined in this study are novel and may provide information concerning differences in the mechanism of apoB100 and apoB48 VLDL assembly and secretion. We have demonstrated that PEMT can specifically limit the secretion of apoB100-containing VLDL from primary murine hepatocytes and McArdle rat hepatoma cells. PC is the most abundant lipid in the surface monolayer of VLDL particles. Thus, we speculate that PC derived from PEMT plays an important role in providing the surface of VLDL that is required for stabilizing the hydrophobic lipid core of the particles. As discussed, many potential mechanisms might explain these observations. Moreover, the observation that VLDL secretion is inhibited in PEMT-deficient mice provides strong evidence that the PEMT requirement is not simply a cell culture phenomenon.2 The unanticipated wrinkle in these studies is that the requirement for PEMT for optimal VLDL secretion is observed only in the male Pemt −/− mice.2"

Using protein cross-linking, we detected distinct modes in the binding of SRP to the ribosome. During signal peptide recognition, SRP54 is positioned at the exit site close to ribosomal proteins L23a and L35. When SRP54 contacts SR, SRP54 is rearranged such that it is no longer close to L23a.

Epidermal growth factor increased phosphorylation of Smad2 in COS7 cells, and Smad2-dependent transcription in a mink lung epithelial cell line, L17, was enhanced by co-transfection of a constitutively active MEK1.

A site of ERK-dependent phosphorylation on Smad2 was located to Thr8, a site that overlaps with the calmodulin binding region. We show that calmodulin inhibits Smad2 phosphorylation by ERK1, and overexpressing calmodulin, or stimulating calmodulin activity with ionomycin, reduces Smad2 levels.

These peptides are not only among the most potent known cellular growth inhibitors but also regulate other diverse biological processes including early embryonic patterning and cell fate determination (1Zimmerman C.M. Mathews L.S. Muttukrishna S. Ledger W. Inhibins, Activins, Follistatin in Human Reproductive Physiology. Imperial College Press, London2001: 239-278Google Scholar). Signaling by these proteins is initiated by ligand-induced hetero-oligomerization of type I and type II receptor serine kinases. Transphosphorylation of a type I receptor serine kinase, ALK4 for activin and ALK5 for TGF-β, by the type II receptor serine kinase activates the type I receptor, which then phosphorylates the C-terminal Ser residues of Smad2 and -3. At present, no difference has been established between the intracellular signaling pathways of activin and TGF-β. Once phosphorylated, Smad2 and -3 form heteromeric complexes with Smad4, followed by translocation of the complexes into the nucleus. There they modulate target gene transcription either by associating with various DNA binding partners or by inducing ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (2Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3315) Google Scholar, 3Zhang Y. Derynck R.

Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), other interactions are also likely to regulate Smad signaling. We have revealed previously that calmodulin binds with Smad2 and acts as a Smad modulator (7Zimmerman C.M. Kariapper M.S. Mathews L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 677-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Scherer and Graff (8Scherer A. Graff J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41430-41438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have also suggested that calmodulin and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) may interact in their effects on modulating Smad signaling duringXenopus embryogenesis. Furthermore, cross-talk between the activin/TGF-β pathway and the MAP kinase pathway is well known in various biological processes; a dominant negative ras mutant blocked mesoderm induction by activin, whereas a constitutively activeras mutant mimicked the inducing activity (9Whitman M. Melton D.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In addition, TGF-β accelerated epithelial-fibroblastoid conversion of mammary epithelial cells in a Ras-dependent manner (10Oft M. Peli J. Rudaz C. Schwarz H. Beug H. Reichmann E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2462-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), and signaling by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was necessary for TGF-β-induced fibronectin synthesis in fibrosarcoma cells (11Hocevar B.A. Brown T.L. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oncogenic Ras has also been shown to block the growth inhibitory effect of TGF-β (12Schwarz L.C. Gingras M.C. Goldberg G. Greenberg A.H. Wright J.A. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6999-7003PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Dok-1, a rasGAP-binding protein that inhibits the Ras pathway (13Yamanashi Y. Tamura T. Kanamori T. Yamane H. Nariuchi H. Yamamoto T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 11-16PubMed Google Scholar), was required for activin-induced apoptosis in B-lineage cells (14Yamakawa N. Tsuchida K. Sugino H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1684-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).The present study was performed to establish a mechanistic basis for the regulation of Smad signaling by these other major intracellular signaling pathways. Here we report that activated ERK phosphorylates Smad2 and that this in turn leads to enhanced transcription of a promoter containing an activin/TGF-β-responsive element. In addition, we have located one of the ERK phosphorylation sites on Smad2. That site lies within the primary calmodulin binding sequence, and we have therefore been led to examine the role of calmodulin in ERK-induced modulation of Smad2 function.DISCUSSIONOur findings have revealed that Smad2 is phosphorylated by ERK1 and that this results in enhanced transcription of an activin/TGF-β-responsive DNA element. They have also shown that the enhanced Smad2-mediated signaling is because of increased levels of Smad2 protein, as a result of stabilization of the protein, and that this in turn leads to increased formation of active signaling complexes with Smad4. These observations suggest that there is cross-talk between the activin/TGF-β and ERK signaling pathways at the level of Smad2 activation and imply that phosphorylation of Smad2 by both activated ERK1 and activin/TGF-β receptor complexes is essential for maximal transcriptional activity.Previous studies have addressed potential cross-talk between the activin/TGF-β and MAP kinase signaling pathways, but no clear consensus has emerged with respect to the functional consequences of these interactions. For example, activation of MAP kinase negatively regulated activin/TGF-β-induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis (14Yamakawa N. Tsuchida K. Sugino H.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, oncogenic Ras and TGF-β collaborated in epithelial-fibroblastoid conversion and invasion of epithelial tumor cells (10Oft M. Peli J. Rudaz C. Schwarz H. Beug H. Reichmann E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2462-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the functional relationship between activin/TGF-β signaling and MAP kinase pathway depends on specific cellular context. In fact, the ability of TGF-β to cause invasive growth was not inhibited by activation of ERK signaling, but the apoptotic effects of TGF-β was blocked in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (44Lehmann K.

A molecular explanation for the synergistic effects of ERK on Smad2 signaling revealed in this study may explain the relationship between activin/TGF-β signaling and the MAP kinase pathway during earlyXenopus embryogenesis and during metastasis of epithelial tumor cells. This is also consistent with the recent results of Oftet al. (45Oft M. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) showing that both Ras and Smad2 signaling are essential for epithelial to mesenchymal transition and that metastasis is driven by sequential elevation of Ras and Smad2 expression.In agreement with previous studies (31de Caestecker M.P.

Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), we found that Smad2 was phosphorylated in response to EGF stimulation. An in vitrokinase assay revealed that activated ERK1 could phosphorylate Smad2 but not Smad4, and tryptic peptide mapping yielded a different pattern from that induced by TGF-β receptor complexes (26Funaba M.

Although it remains uncertain whether Smad2 phosphorylation by ERK1 and JNK occurs at the same sites, these results suggest that Smad2 phosphorylation is regulated not only by receptors for activin and TGF-β but also by the MAP kinase family.Our data on the effects of ERK phosphorylation on Smad2-dependent transcription are consistent with findings by others. de Caestecker et al. (31de Caestecker M.P. Parks W.T. Frank C.J. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Roberts A.B. Lechleider R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1587-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) showed that activation of receptor tyrosine kinases by EGF or hepatocyte growth factor activated Smad2-dependent gene expression. In addition, activated MEK kinase 1 enhanced Smad2-dependent gene transcription (46Brown J.D. DiChiara M.R. Anderson K.R. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Topper J.N. J. Biol.

Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). Furthermore activin and MAP kinase-coupled signals synergized during early embryogenesis in Xenopus (48LaBonne C. Whitman M. Development. 1994; 120: 463-472PubMed Google Scholar, 49LaBonne C. Burke B. Whitman M. Development. 1995; 121: 1475-1486PubMed Google Scholar). Because the MAP kinase family is large, with a complex and incompletely understood set of regulators and targets (50Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar), we cannot state unequivocally which members of the MAP kinase family phosphorylate Smad2 in vivo. Nevertheless our data suggest that phosphorylation of Smad2 by activated ERK1 is necessary for maximum transcription of Smad2-dependent genes.Ser residues (Ser465 and Ser467) at the C terminus of Smad2 are phosphorylated in response to TGF-β stimulation (34Abdollah S.

This finding was taken as indicating that the mutant protein acted in a dominant negative manner (33Macı́as-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). However, in our hands Smad2(2A) and wild-type Smad2 had comparable transcriptional activity with AR3-lux as reporter gene, suggesting that the Smad2(2A) mutant does not have a dominant negative effect at least when AR3-lux is the reporter.Kretzschmar et al. (32Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) have reported that Smad3 mutants with Ser → Ala or Thr → Val substitutions at four potential ERK sites in the linker region (corresponding to the residues changed in Smad2; see Fig. 4 A) increased basal expression of AR3-lux in Ras transformed cells. This result was taken to suggest that phosphorylation of Smad3 by the Ras pathway inhibits Smad3-mediated signaling, a view that contrasts with our findings, as well as those of others (31de Caestecker M.P. Parks W.T. Frank C.J. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Roberts A.B. Lechleider R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1587-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 44Lehmann K. Janda E. Pierreux C.E. Rytomaa M.

Parks W.T. Frank C.J. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Roberts A.B. Lechleider R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1587-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) as pointing to a general stimulation of transcription by the Ras pathway. However, the present study has shown that amino acid substitutions in Smad2 that either mimic or inhibit ERK1 phosphorylation increase and decrease transcription, respectively. Differences between Smad2 and Smad3 may be responsible for the different result obtained. Thus, although the two proteins are closely related structurally, and both are thought to be activin/TGF-β signal mediators, Smad3 has been observed to inhibit Smad2·Smad4-mediated transcription of a reporter gene from thegoosecoid promoter (52Labbé E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). It is also possible that differences between the cell types used in the experiments may account for the divergent observations.Our data suggest that Smad2 that has been phosphorylated by ERK1 has higher transcriptional activity primarily because it has greater stability and forms a greater number of complexes with Smad4. The increase in complex formation is presumably a simple mass action effect, because a Smad2 substitution mimicking phosphorylation by activated ERK1 did not alter the affinity of the resulting protein for Smad4. Brown et al. (46Brown J.D. DiChiara M.R. Anderson K.R. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Topper J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8797-8805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) have shown similarly that stimulation of the JNK pathway enhances the Smad2-Smad4 interaction in endothelial cells. It is known that activation of the MAP kinase pathway affects protein stability; the half-life of c-Myc protein markedly increased in response to stimulation of the Ras pathway (53Sears R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of Ser62 by ERK (54Seth A. Gonzalez F.A. Gupta S. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24796-24804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was required for the Ras-induced stabilization of c-Myc (55Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar).In previous work we showed that calmodulin interacts with Smad2 in a calcium-dependent manner and that the N-terminal helix of Smad2 is the primary calmodulin binding region (7Zimmerman C.M. Kariapper M.S. Mathews L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 677-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The present results show that phosphorylation of Smad2 by ERK1 is blocked by interaction with calmodulin. Scherer and Graff (8Scherer A. Graff J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41430-41438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have also shown that binding of calmodulin to Smad2 inhibits subsequent ERK2-dependent phosphorylation of Smad2. It is possible that binding of calmodulin changes the conformation of Smad2 such that it is less efficiently phosphorylated. Alternatively, it may sterically block the relevant phosphorylation sites.Earlier we demonstrated that overexpression of calmodulin inhibited activin/TGF-β-responsive gene transcription and that inhibition of calmodulin activity stimulated transcription (7Zimmerman C.M. Kariapper M.S. Mathews L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 677-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Calmodulin overexpression also blocked Smad2-dependent morphogenesis in Xenopus (8Scherer A. Graff J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41430-41438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Wicks et al. (56Wicks S.J. Lui S. Abdel-Wahab N. Mason R.M. Chantry A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8103-8111Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) have shown that inhibition of TGF-β-mediated transcriptional activation can result from phosphorylation of Smad2 by calmodulin-dependent kinase II and consequent inhibition of its nuclear translocation. In the present study, overexpression of calmodulin, or ionomycin treatment, decreased the level of Smad2 protein in L17 cells. Hence the inhibition of activin/TGF-β signaling by increased calmodulin activity may be at least partly because of reduced phosphorylation of Smad2 via the ERK pathway and its resulting instability. This, therefore, could be an additional mechanism by which calmodulin regulates Smad2-mediated signaling.The present study examined the mechanistic basis for regulation of Smad2 signaling by the ERK pathway and by calmodulin binding. Our findings suggest that the ERK pathway positively regulates Smad2 signaling by phosphorylating Smad2 and that calmodulin negatively regulates Smad2 activation by inhibiting this phosphorylation. The rigorous control of Smad2 activity, a signal mediator for activin and TGF-β, by these other major intracellular signaling pathways may explain some of the diverse biological activities of activin and TGF-β in development, normal physiology, and pathology. Activin and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)1 are structurally related, multipotent growth and differentiation factors. These peptides are not only among the most potent known cellular growth inhibitors but also regulate other diverse biological processes including early embryonic patterning and cell fate determination (1Zimmerman C.M. Mathews L.S. Muttukrishna S. Ledger W. Inhibins, Activins, Follistatin in Human Reproductive Physiology. Imperial College Press, London2001: 239-278Google Scholar). Signaling by these proteins is initiated by ligand-induced hetero-oligomerization of type I and type II receptor serine kinases. Transphosphorylation of a type I receptor serine kinase, ALK4 for activin and ALK5 for TGF-β, by the type II receptor serine kinase activates the type I receptor, which then phosphorylates the C-terminal Ser residues of Smad2 and -3. At present, no difference has been established between the intracellular signaling pathways of activin and TGF-β. Once phosphorylated, Smad2 and -3 form heteromeric complexes with Smad4, followed by translocation of the complexes into the nucleus. There they modulate target gene transcription either by associating with various DNA binding partners or by inducing ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (2Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3315) Google Scholar, 3Zhang Y. Derynck R.

In addition to Smad activation by activin/TGF-β-dependent phosphorylation (6Funaba M. Mathews L.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), other interactions are also likely to regulate Smad signaling. We have revealed previously that calmodulin binds with Smad2 and acts as a Smad modulator (7Zimmerman C.M. Kariapper M.S. Mathews L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 677-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Scherer and Graff (8Scherer A. Graff J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41430-41438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have also suggested that calmodulin and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) may interact in their effects on modulating Smad signaling duringXenopus embryogenesis. Furthermore, cross-talk between the activin/TGF-β pathway and the MAP kinase pathway is well known in various biological processes; a dominant negative ras mutant blocked mesoderm induction by activin, whereas a constitutively activeras mutant mimicked the inducing activity (9Whitman M. Melton D.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In addition, TGF-β accelerated epithelial-fibroblastoid conversion of mammary epithelial cells in a Ras-dependent manner (10Oft M. Peli J. Rudaz C. Schwarz H. Beug H. Reichmann E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2462-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), and signaling by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was necessary for TGF-β-induced fibronectin synthesis in fibrosarcoma cells (11Hocevar B.A. Brown T.L. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oncogenic Ras has also been shown to block the growth inhibitory effect of TGF-β (12Schwarz L.C. Gingras M.C. Goldberg G. Greenberg A.H. Wright J.A. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6999-7003PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Dok-1, a rasGAP-binding protein that inhibits the Ras pathway (13Yamanashi Y. Tamura T. Kanamori T. Yamane H. Nariuchi H. Yamamoto T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 11-16PubMed Google Scholar), was required for activin-induced apoptosis in B-lineage cells (14Yamakawa N. Tsuchida K. Sugino H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1684-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The present study was performed to establish a mechanistic basis for the regulation of Smad signaling by these other major intracellular signaling pathways. Here we report that activated ERK phosphorylates Smad2 and that this in turn leads to enhanced transcription of a promoter containing an activin/TGF-β-responsive element. In addition, we have located one of the ERK phosphorylation sites on Smad2. That site lies within the primary calmodulin binding sequence, and we have therefore been led to examine the role of calmodulin in ERK-induced modulation of Smad2 function. DISCUSSIONOur findings have revealed that Smad2 is phosphorylated by ERK1 and that this results in enhanced transcription of an activin/TGF-β-responsive DNA element. They have also shown that the enhanced Smad2-mediated signaling is because of increased levels of Smad2 protein, as a result of stabilization of the protein, and that this in turn leads to increased formation of active signaling complexes with Smad4. These observations suggest that there is cross-talk between the activin/TGF-β and ERK signaling pathways at the level of Smad2 activation and imply that phosphorylation of Smad2 by both activated ERK1 and activin/TGF-β receptor complexes is essential for maximal transcriptional activity.Previous studies have addressed potential cross-talk between the activin/TGF-β and MAP kinase signaling pathways, but no clear consensus has emerged with respect to the functional consequences of these interactions. For example, activation of MAP kinase negatively regulated activin/TGF-β-induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis (14Yamakawa N. Tsuchida K. Sugino H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1684-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J.

Its intracellular effects include free radical formation, inhibition of DNA topoisomerase II, and also nucleotide intercalation, resulting in inhibition of DNA replication. As with many other chemotherapeutic antitumor drugs, the ensuing induction of apoptosis is likely an important reason for its therapeutic effect. DXR-induced apoptosis typically involves cytochrome c (cyt c) release from mitochondria and subsequent caspase activation (1Gamen S. Anel A. Perez-Galan P. Lasierra P. Johnson D. Pineiro A. Naval J. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Accordingly, overexpression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein blocks DXR-induced apoptosis (2Decaudin D. Geley S. Hirsch T. Castedo M. Marchetti P. Macho A. Kofler R. Kroemer G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 62-67PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite its wide-spread use in the clinic and the many types of cellular damage DXR has been shown to cause, its apoptosis-inducing signaling is far from well characterized (3Gewirtz D.A. Biochem. Parmacol. 1999; 57: 727-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar). The DXR molecule is amphoteric and binds to cell membranes as well as plasma proteins. Under physiological conditions, redox processing of DXR leads to free radical formation, which in turn may relate to the toxic and apoptotic properties of the drug (3Gewirtz D.A. Biochem. Parmacol. 1999; 57: 727-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar). It has thus been shown that different types of antioxidant treatment, including antisense nitric-oxide synthase, can block DXR-induced toxic and apoptotic effects (3Gewirtz D.A. Biochem.

Chem. 2001; 276: 47266-47276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Other examples of DXR-induced pro-apoptotic signaling include generation of sphingosine and its metabolite ceramide (5Cuvillier O. Nava V.E. Murthy S.K. Edsall L.C. Levade T. Milstein S. Spiegel S. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how these and/or other upstream signaling events lead to the mitochondrial events of DXR-induced apoptosis. Release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intramembrane space to the cytoplasm is commonly mediated by the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bak and Bax, which in apoptotic cells are suggested to either oligomerize and form pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane (6Desagher S. Martinou J.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 369-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar, 7Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or to interact with the proteins of the mitochondrial megapore (VDAC and ANT) (8Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jurgensmeier J.M. Susin S.A. Viera H.L. Prevost M.C. Xie Z. Matsuyama S. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. Science. 1998; 281: 2027-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 9Loeffler M. Kroemer G. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Bak and Bax are likely able to partially substitute for each other since deficiency for both genes is required to render cells completely resistant to a number of apoptotic agents, while single knockouts for either gene have far less effect on sensitivity (10Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H.Y. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). The roles of Bak and Bax in DXR-induced apoptosis have, however, not been investigated. Oligomerization and/or activation of Bak and Bax can be induced by Bid, another pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member (7Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar), but also via other mechanisms since Bid−/− MEF cells do not show increased resistance to a number of apoptotic agents (10Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H.Y. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). During apoptosis, Bid (21 kDa) is proteolytically cleaved to its active truncated form, tBid (15 kDa) by caspase-8 (12Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 4814-4890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (3085) Google Scholar) or by calpain (13Mandic A. Viktorsson K. Strandberg L. Heiden T. Hansson J. Linder S. Shoshan M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3003-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Candidate proteins that might have a similar function as Bid are for instance the related Bik and Bim proteins (14Lutz R.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 51-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of Bik has been shown to be sufficient for apoptosis induction in two leukemic cell lines (15Marshansky V. Wang X. Bertrand R. Luo H. Duguid W. Chinnadurai G. Kanaan N., Vu, M.D. Wu J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3130-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The activated and oligomerized or otherwise complex-bound Bak and Bax proteins are conformationally modulated, leading to exposure of an occluded N-terminal sequence (16Griffiths G.J. Dubrez L. Morgan C.P. Jones N.A. Whitehouse J. Corfe B.M. Dive C. Hickman J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 17Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Using antibodies specific for this epitope, modulation of Bak or Bax to its apoptotic conformations can be quantitated using flow cytometry (16Griffiths G.J. Dubrez L. Morgan C.P. Jones N.A. Whitehouse J. Corfe B.M. Dive C. Hickman J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). With this method, cisplatin was found to modulate Bak in all cell lines tested, whereas Bax modulation was not seen or occurred only when nuclear fragmentation was already under way (18Mandic A. Viktorsson K. Molin M. Akusjärvi G. Hansson J. Linder S. Shoshan M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3684-3691Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Despite the overlapping functions of Bak and Bax as evidenced by knockout experiments, Bak-deficient Jurkat cells proficient for Bax were highly resistant to cisplatin and other agents, and sensitivity was restored by reintroduction of Bak (19Wang G.Q. Gastman B.H. Wieckowski E. Goldstein L.A. Gambotto A. Kim T.H. Fang B. Rabinovitz A. Yin X.M. Rabinowich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34307-34317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These reports support the idea that Bak and Bax are differently regulated. Moreover, the literature suggests different requirements for Bak or Bax functions; thus, staurosporine-induced apoptosis appears to depend on a Bax-specific function since Bax−/− MEF cells were 50% resistant compared with Bak−/− and wild-type MEF cells (10Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H.Y. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway plays a critical role in mediating survival signals in a wide range of cell types. The recent identification of a number of substrates for the serine/threonine kinase Akt suggests that it blocks cell death both by impinging on the cytoplasmic cell death machinery and by regulating the expression of genes involved in cell death and survival. In more detail, Akt has been shown to phosphorylate the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bad, leading to its sequestration and subsequent inactivation by 14–3-3 proteins. Furthermore, it was recently shown that Akt phosphorylates and inactivates a number of forkhead transcription factors and thereby inhibits transcriptional activation of another proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bim (21Stahl M. Dijkers P.F. Kops G.J. Lens S.M. Coffer P.J. Burgering B.M. Medema R.H. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5024-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Specific PI3K inhibitors (i.e.LY294002 and wortmannin) were shown recently to significantly increase apoptosis induced by cytotoxic drugs, e.g. DXR in HL60 cells (22O'Gorman D.M. McKenna S.L. McGahon A.J. Knox K.A. Cotter T.G. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 602-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism by which PI3-kinase-regulated survival pathways suppress apoptosis is not clear. We have here studied DXR-induced apoptotic signaling in U266 myeloma and Daudi Burkitt′s lymphoma cells with regard to the kinetics of apoptosis and modulation of Bak and Bax. The involvement of these proteins has been further established by the resistance ofbak−/− and bax−/− MEFs to DXR-induced apoptosis. DXR-induced Bak and Bax activation and apoptosis was enhanced in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 along with enhanced apoptosis. Bak and Bax activation induced by DXR in the presence or absence of LY294002 was blocked by overexpressed Bcl-2. A multiple myeloma cell line, U266 (kindly provided by Prof. Kenneth Nilsson, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden), a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, Daudi (ATCC, Manassas, VA), and MEF were used. U266 and Daudi cells were cultured in RPMI (GIBCO, Berlin, Germany), supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (GIBCO), 2 mml-glutamine, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μg/ml penicillin, and maintained in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. MEF cells were cultured in similarly supplemented Dulbecco's minimal essential medium in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were treated with different concentrations of DXR (adriamycin from Amersham Biosciences and Upjohn, Stockholm, Sweden) for 24, 48, and 72 h. The concentrations of DXR were carefully chosen in order to be clinically relevant (3Gewirtz D.A. Biochem. Parmacol. 1999; 57: 727-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar). The pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK (z-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-FMK (50 μm) and caspase-8 inhibitor z-IETD-FMK (Z-Ile-Glu(OMe)-Thr-Asp(OMe)-FMK) (10 μm) were obtained from Enzyme System Products (Livermore). The p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 (Calbiochem) was used at 10 μm. The PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 (Sigma) was used at 10 μm. The calpain inhibitor calpeptin (Alexis Biochemicals) was used at 10 μm. All inhibitors were added 1 h prior to DXR treatment of the U266 cells and thereafter present in the culture throughout the experiment. The antibody against Bak is a mouse monoclonal antibody against amino acids 1–52 of Bak (AM03, clone TC100; Oncogene Research Products). The antibody against Bax is a mouse monoclonal antibody against amino acids 12–24 of Bax (clone 6A7; Pharmingen-Becton Dickinson). The antibodies against Bid and Bik are from Cell Signaling Technology and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. The antibody against cytochromec was purchased from Pharmingen-Becton Dickinson and was biotinylated by using an EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS biotinylation kit from Pierce. Redistribution of plasma membrane phosphatidyl serine is a marker of apoptosis and was assessed using annexin V FLUOS (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 106 cells per sample were collected, washed in PBS, pelleted, and resuspended in incubation buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2) containing 1% annexin V. The samples were kept in the dark and incubated for 15 min prior to addition of another 400 μl of incubation buffer and subsequent analysis on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter Calibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) using Cell Quest software. Reduction in mitochondrial inner membrane potential, ΔΨm, is a typical feature of apoptotic cells. To detect DXR-induced changes in ΔΨm, cells were stained with tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester perchlorate (TMRE; Molecular Probes Inc.). Briefly, 106cells/sample were collected, whereafter TMRE was added to a final concentration of 25 nm, a concentration that remained throughout the experiment. After 30 min of incubation, cells were pelleted, washed once in PBS and TMRE once, and then incubated for 10 min in the dark in 100 μl of incubation buffer (10 mmHEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaC12, 25 nm TMRE) containing 1% annexin V FLUOS. Prior to flow cytometric analysis, another 400 μl of incubation buffer was added. For assessment of caspase-3 activation, see below. Upon induction of apoptosis, the proapoptotic Bax and Bak proteins undergo conformational changes, which expose otherwise inaccessible N-terminal epitopes. In the present study, we have used two antibodies shown to specifically recognize these epitopes (16Griffiths G.J. Dubrez L. Morgan C.P. Jones N.A. Whitehouse J. Corfe B.M. Dive C. Hickman J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 17Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Using a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibody, the increases in accessibility of these epitopes can be monitored by flow cytometry. At specific time points after DXR treatment, cells were harvested and fixed in paraformaldehyde (0.25%, 5 min), washed three times in PBS, and incubated for 30 min with primary antibody diluted 1:50 in PBS containing digitonin (100 μg/ml). After three washes in PBS, cells were incubated with FITC-labeled anti-mouse antibody for 30 min, washed twice, and resuspended in PBS. Negative controls using an irrelevant primary antibody (rabbit anti-MEKK1) were also prepared. Cells (10,000/sample) were analyzed on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter Calibur flow cytometer. For quantitation and comparison, median fluorescence intensity values were calculated using Cell Quest software. Detection of active caspase-3 by flow cytometry was used to assess apoptosis induced by DXR. Briefly, 106 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of DXR and harvested after 48 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (Becton Dickinson) for 20 min on ice. After two washes with Perm/Wash Buffer (Becton Dickinson) at room temperature, the pellets were resuspended in Perm/Wash buffer containing the FITC-conjugated monoclonal active caspase-3 antibody (Becton Dickinson) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Each sample was then washed with Perm/Wash buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry. Results are shown both as frequency histograms and, after quantitation based on median fluorescence intensity values, also as fold induction in bar charts. For Western blot analysis 5 × 106 cells were lysed by sonication in LSLD buffer (50 mm HEPES at pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.3 mm sodium-orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 80 μm glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium-pyrophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and antipain, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μg/ml each of benzamidine hydrochloride and soybean trypsin inhibitor). Forty μg of protein were loaded in each well for resolution on 12% SDS-PAGE and electroblotting to polyvinylidene difluoride-membranes by semi-dry transfer. The membranes were incubated for 1 h each with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. Bands were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). U266 cells were transfected by electroporation using a construct encoding a full-length BCL-2 cDNA in a pSFFV-neo vector. The pCDNA vector was used to produce a neomycin-resistant pool for control experiments. 5 × 106 cells were resuspended in 300 μl of complete RPMI medium and electroporated in a 0.4-cm cuvette at 250 V, 960 μF using Gene Pulser from Bio-Rad. 10 μg of each plasmid DNA was used. Right after the pulse, the cells were diluted with complete RPMI medium to a concentration of 4 × 105 cells/ml. Two days later, the medium was replaced with RPMI containing 500 μg/ml of G418. The neomycin-resistant pool of living cells was separated on Ficoll gradient 1 week later, and cells were cloned in a 96-well plate by limiting dilution. Bcl-2 expression was confirmed by immunostaining and Western blotting. For Bax/or Bak/cytochromec-double staining, cells were cytospun onto glass slides, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, washed once with PBS, and permeabilized using digitonin diluted in PBS for 10 min. After one wash in PBS, the staining proceeded as follows: anti-Bax or anti-Bak monoclonal antibodies, three washes in PBS, rabbit anti-mouse FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies, three washes in PBS, normal mouse serum (Chemi-Con, Int.), biotinylated anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (clone 6H2.B4, Pharmingen), three washes in PBS followed by Texas Red streptavidin (Vector Laboratory, Inc.). Slides were mounted using Vectashield with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Lab., Inc.). The images were recorded on DAS Leitz DM RB microscope with a Hamamatsu C4880 dual mode cooled charge-coupled devices camera and further processed using PhotoShop software (Adobe). To determine the dose and time dependence of DXR-induced apoptosis, U266 and Daudi cells were treated with DXR at 10 and 60 ng/ml. Apoptosis, seen as annexin V positivity and mitochondrial depolarization (loss of ΔΨm), was assessed after 24, 48, and 72 h (Fig.1, a and b). By 24 h, apoptosis was initiated in both cell lines. At 48 h there was a dose-dependent further increase in apoptosis, and by 72 h both concentrations had induced apoptosis in nearly all remaining cells in both cell lines. Similar data were recorded with annexin V/propidium iodide double stainings to ensure that necrosis was not induced (data not shown). Bak and Bax antibodies that recognize their active conformations were used in order to investigate Bak and Bax involvement in the DXR-induced apoptosis. Treatment of U266 cells with 10 ng/ml DXR for 24 h induced no or little activation/modulation of Bak and Bax (Fig. 2, a and b). A higher dose of DXR (60 ng/ml) for 24 h induced an increased activation of both Bak and Bax (Fig. 2, a and b). After 48 h of DXR at both concentrations, Bak (Fig. 2 a) and Bax (Fig. 2 b) activation was even higher. Bak and Bax activation was seen also in similarly treated Daudi cells in that no or little Bak and Bax activation was seen at 24 h with both doses, while there is a dose-dependent induction in both Bak (Fig. 2 c) and Bax (Fig. 2 d) activation after 48 h of DXR treatment. The activation of Bak and Bax in relation to cyt c release from mitochondria was investigated by immunocytochemistry. Treatment of U266 cells for 24 h with 60 ng/ml of DXR induced an activation of Bak prior to the release of cyt c from the mitochondria (Fig.3 a). Importantly, active Bak co-localized with cyt c in DXR-treated U266 cells. However, Bax was found to be active only in cells that had already released cyt c and with the fragmented nuclear morphology typical of late apoptosis (Fig.3 b). These data indicate that Bak activation occurs earlier than both Bax activation and cytochrome c release and that DXR differentially regulates these two proteins. It has previously been shown that BH3-only proteins (BOPs) have a key regulatory role in activating the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (14Lutz R.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 51-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Involvement of Bid and Bik, two major BH3-only proteins, in DXR-induced apoptosis in U266 cells was examined by assessing drug-induced cleavage of Bid to its active, truncated form tBid, and by analyzing expression levels of Bik. Following treatment with 60 ng/ml, only a little Bid cleavage was seen after 24 h, whereas significant cleavage was seen at 48 h (Fig.4 a). The faint band corresponding to tBid in the control cells (Fig. 4 a), probably reflects the low but detectable spontaneous apoptosis observed under standard culture conditions. Bid cleavage induced by DXR after 48 h was blocked by pretreatment with a caspase-8 inhibitor. However, caspase-8 inhibition had no effect on annexin V positivity of DXR-treated U266 cells after 24 or 48 h (data not shown). DXR at 60 ng/ml also induced increased levels of Bik protein already at 24 h, which remained elevated at 48 h (Fig. 4, band c). The roles of Bid, Bak, and Bax in DXR-induced apoptosis were further investigated by DXR treatment of wild-type MEF and MEFs deficient for either Bax, Bak, or Bid. Apoptosis induced by increasing concentrations of DXR was assessed as caspase-3 activation after 48 h of treatment (Fig.5). The results show thatbid-deficient cells were at least as sensitive to DXR as WT MEFs (Fig. 5 a), indicating that Bid does not have a regulatory role in DXR-induced apoptosis. Similarly treatedbax-deficient cells were found to be partially resistant to DXR compared with WT cells (Fig. 5 b). In contrast,bak-deficient cells were significantly more resistant to DXR (Fig. 5 c). The results are in accordance with involvement of both Bax and Bak (Fig. 2, a and b), whereas they indicate lack of involvement of Bid cleavage (Fig. 4 a). This latter observation is also supported by the finding that inhibition of caspase-8 blocks Bid cleavage in this system without affecting Bak and Bax activation (see below). A limited number of stress-activating signaling cascades have been implicated as apical activators of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. One prominent example are the p38 SAP kinases that have been shown to initiate the apoptotic pathway in response to stress stimuli (e.g. DNA damage, endoplasmic reticulum stress) (23Pillaire M.J. Nebreda A.R. Darbon J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 724-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To investigate the involvement of p38 SAPK in DXR-induced apoptosis, U266 cells were treated with DXR in the presence or absence of SB203580, a p38 SAPK inhibitor. SB203580 was added to U266 cells 1 h prior to DXR (60 ng/ml) and continuously present in the culture throughout the experiment. The resulting Bak and Bax activations were then assessed and related to annexin V positivity. SB203580 was found to have a small blocking effect on annexin V positivity (data not shown), whereas it caused a more pronounced decrease in the activation of both Bak and Bax (Fig.6, i and ii). These data imply that the p38 SAPK is partially involved in DXR-induced activation of Bak, Bax, and the apoptotic pathway initiated by DXR in U266 cells. Another example of an enzyme that has been shown also to be an apical activator of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is calpain. This is a protease that has been demonstrated to induce the activation of Bid and other pro-apoptotic proteins through cleavage (13Mandic A. Viktorsson K. Strandberg L. Heiden T. Hansson J. Linder S. Shoshan M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3003-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 24Gao G. Dou Q.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 80: 53-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 25Kubbutat, M. H., and Vousden, K. H. (1997) 17,460–468.Google Scholar). To examine the role of calpain in DXR-induced apoptosis, calpeptin, a specific inhibitor of calpain, was added to U266 cells 1 h prior to addition of DXR and continuously present in the culture throughout the experiment. Calpeptin had no influence on Bax activation (Fig. 6,iv), whereas it decreased DXR-induced Bak activation, indicating a link between calpain and Bak activation (Fig. 6,iii). We also examined the involvement of caspases in DXR-induced Bak and Bax activation by pretreating U266 cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor. zVAD induced a small decrease in annexin V positivity as well as Bak and Bax activation suggesting that caspases are marginally involved (Fig. 6, v, vi, viii). Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 has been shown to protect against a number of apoptotic stimuli in various experimental systems. We have here compared the effects of DXR on U266 cells stably transfected with either vector alone or vector encoding human Bcl-2. The levels of Bcl-2 protein in three overexpressing clones are shown in Fig.7 a. The Bcl-2 transfected U266 clones 7, 8, and 13 demonstrated an increased resistance to DXR compared with the neomycin-transfected U266, seen as decreased annexin V positivity following DXR treatment (Fig. 7 b). DXR-induced Bak activation was completely abrogated in the Bcl-2-overexpressing U266 clones 7 (Fig. 7 c, i) and 13 (Fig. 7 c, ii). However, the activation of Bax was only partially blocked in both clone 7 (Fig. 7 c,iii) and clone 13 (Fig. 7 c, iv). Although Bax remained partially activated, Bcl-2 overexpression blocked apoptosis as shown in Fig. 7 b. The levels of active Bak and Bax in Bcl-2-transfected U266 cells were unchanged in relation to neomycin-transfected cells (data not shown). These patterns of inhibition suggest that Bak and Bax activation is differentially regulated by Bcl-2. Tumor cells show variable sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. One potential mechanism is the deregulation of survival pathways such as the PI3K cascade. LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, was used to examine whether the PI3K pathway counteracts the apoptotic response induced by DXR. Neomycin- and bcl-2-stably transfected U266 cells were pretreated with LY294002 1 h prior to addition of 60 ng/ml of DXR and continuously present in the culture throughout the exp"
https://openalex.org/W2110326265,"Recent studies have identified the liver X receptors (LXRα and LXRβ) as important regulators of cholesterol and lipid metabolism. Although originally identified as liver-enriched transcription factors, LXRs are also expressed in skeletal muscle, a tissue that accounts for ∼40% of human total body weight and is the major site of glucose utilization and fatty acid oxidation. Nevertheless, no studies have yet addressed the functional role of LXRs in muscle. In this work we utilize a combination of in vivoand in vitro analysis to demonstrate that LXRs can functionally regulate genes involved in cholesterol metabolism in skeletal muscle. Furthermore we show that treatment of muscle cellsin vitro with synthetic agonists of LXR increases the efflux of intracellular cholesterol to extracellular acceptors such as high density lipoprotein, thus identifying this tissue as a potential important regulator of reverse cholesterol transport and high density lipoprotein levels. Additionally we demonstrate that LXRα and a subset of LXR target genes are induced during myogenesis, suggesting a role for LXR-dependent signaling in the differentiation process.

Disorders of cholesterol and lipid metabolism are associated with cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Not surprisingly organisms have developed exquisite regulatory networks that ensure lipid homeostasis is maintained by controlling dietary intake, de novo synthesis, transport, and catabolism. For instance, numerous studies over the past five years have identified members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors as important regulators of the genes involved cholesterol and lipid metabolism (3Chawla A. Repa J.J. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Google Scholar). In particular, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARα, 1The abbreviations used are: PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; LXR, liver X receptor; HDL, high density lipoprotein; SREBP1c, sterol response element-binding protein 1c; FAS, fatty acid synthase; SCD-1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; DOTAP, N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium salts; DOSPER, 1-3-di-oleoyloxy- 2-(6-carboxy-spermyl)-propylamid. 1The abbreviations used are: PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; LXR, liver X receptor; HDL, high density lipoprotein; SREBP1c, sterol response element-binding protein 1c; FAS, fatty acid synthase; SCD-1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; DOTAP, N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium salts; DOSPER, 1-3-di-oleoyloxy- 2-(6-carboxy-spermyl)-propylamid. β/δ, and γ), the farnesoid X receptor, and the liver X receptors (LXRα, and LXRβ) are transcription factors whose activity can be controlled by the direct binding of fatty acids (PPARs and LXRs) and cholesterol derivatives (LXRs and farnesoid X receptor). Thus, these transcription factors are poised to sense changes in the intracellular concentrations of lipids and cholesterol and to regulate cellular metabolism accordingly (3Chawla A. Repa J.J.

Recently several studies have demonstrated that the LXRs play a dynamic role in the regulation of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. LXRs bind to DNA as obligate heterodimers with retinoid X receptors and directly bind cholesterol metabolites and fatty acids (5Ou J., Tu, H. Shan B. Luk A. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6027-6032Google Scholar,6Janowski B.A. Willy P.J. Devi T.R. Falck J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 728-731Google Scholar). Interestingly cholesterol derivatives and fatty acids have opposing effects on LXR transcriptional activity. Oxysterols including 24(S), 25-epoxycholesterol, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, and 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol are activators of LXR and increase transcription of genes involved in sterol transport including the ATP binding cassette transporters ABCA1, ABCG1, ABCG5, and ABCG8 and the apolipoprotein apoE (7Costet P.

The importance of these LXR target genes to sterol metabolism has recently been highlighted by linkage of ABCA1 to Tangier disease and ABCG5 together with ABCG8 to sitosterolemia, both human genetic syndromes characterized by perturbed cholesterol transport (12Lee M.H., Lu, K.

Genet. 1999; 22: 352-355Google Scholar). Strikingly, mutations in ABCA1 that give rise to Tangier disease result in an almost complete absence of HDL cholesterol and promote accumulation of cholesterol within peripheral tissues. Biochemical analysis of ABCA1 indicates that it mediates the transport of intracellular cholesterol and phospholipids to extracellular acceptors such as HDL, a process termed reverse cholesterol transport (17Hayden M.R. Clee S.M. Brooks-Wilson A. Genest Jr., J. Attie A. Kastelein J.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 117-122Google Scholar, 18Hobbs H.H. Rader D.J. J. Clin.

LXR agonists also increase expression ofCYP7a, the gene encoding cholesterol 7α hydroxylase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the metabolic conversion of cholesterol to bile acids (20Peet D.J. Turley S.D., Ma, W. Janowski B.A. Lobaccaro J.-M.A. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 693-704Google Scholar). Thus, under conditions of elevated cholesterol, LXRs promote the transfer of cholesterol from the periphery to the liver for catabolism and excretion. Furthermore, up-regulation of ABCA1, ABCG5, and ABCG8 in the intestine by LXRs limits the absorption of sterols by promoting efflux from enterocytes to the lumen, resulting in an overall decrease in cholesterol loads (8Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J., Li, L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Google Scholar). Along with the effects on cholesterol metabolism, LXR agonists also increase expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, including the master transcriptional regulator of fatty acid synthesis, the sterol response element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) (1Schultz J.R., Tu, H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C., Li, L. Schwendner S. Wang S. Thoolen M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Lustig K.D. Shan B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2831-2838Google Scholar, 21Repa J.J. Liang G., Ou, J. Bashmakov Y.

Additionally, several of the genes encoding the enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism, including fatty acid synthase (FAS) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1), are regulated directly or indirectly by LXR (1Schultz J.R., Tu, H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C., Li, L. Schwendner S. Wang S. Thoolen M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Lustig K.D. Shan B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2831-2838Google Scholar, 20Peet D.J. Turley S.D., Ma, W.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11019-11025Google Scholar). The coordinate up-regulation of fatty acid synthesis with reverse cholesterol transport is most likely to provide lipids for the transport and storage of cholesterol. In contrast, however, to the agonist activity of cholesterol metabolites, fatty acids act as antagonists of LXR transcriptional activity, suggesting the possibility of a negative feedback loop whereby the metabolic end product inhibits the inducer (5Ou J., Tu, H. Shan B. Luk A. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6027-6032Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle accounts for ∼40% of adult total body weight and is a major site of glucose and fatty acid oxidation. Importantly, insulin regulates the balance between glucose and fatty acid utilization in this tissue, and increased fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle is a hallmark of type II diabetes. Although LXRs have been shown to be important regulators of hepatic fatty acid metabolism, the function of these transcription factors in muscle has not been well addressed. Nevertheless, given the recent interest in LXR ligands as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of disorders of cholesterol and lipid metabolism, the contribution of this major mass tissue to LXR action must be defined. In this study we used in vivoanalysis in wild type and LXR knockout mice along with the well defined C2C12 skeletal muscle cell culture model to characterize LXR activity in muscle. The results of this work identify skeletal muscle as an important site of LXR activity. Homozygous LXRαβ-double knockout mice (LXRαβ−/−) were from a breeding colony established and maintained at X-Ceptor Therapeutics Inc. Mice were fed ad libitum. The LXR agonist T0901317 (1Schultz J.R., Tu, H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C., Li, L. Schwendner S. Wang S. Thoolen M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Lustig K.D. Shan B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2831-2838Google Scholar) was administered by daily oral gavage in a sesame oil/ethanol vehicle via a 1-cc syringe fitted with a 20-gauge disposable feeding needle for 7 days. Compound was solvated in ethanol (5% final volume) and brought up to final volume with sesame oil (Sigma). Plasma triglyceride levels were measured using an enzymatic assay and the supplier's protocols (Sigma). Luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed by PCR amplification of the human ABCA1 promoter (−621–+45) and the mouse SREBP1c promoter (−543–+39) and cloning into pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison, WI). Mouse myogenic C2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2. Cells were induced to biochemically and morphologically differentiate into multinucleated myotubes by mitogen withdrawal (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum) as previously described (2Bains W. Ponte P. Blau H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1449-1453Google Scholar). Differentiation was essentially complete within 96 h with respect to the cytoskeletal and contractile isoform transition. For transient transfections, cells were grown in 24-well dishes to 60–70% confluence and transfected with 0.5–0.8 μg/well of the pGL3b-LUC, SREBP1c-LUC, or ABC1c-LUC reporter constructs using a DOTAP/DOSPER (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) liposome mixture in 1× HEBS (42 mm HEPES, 275 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 0.4 mm Na2HPO4, 11 mm dextrose, pH 7.1). A β-galactosidase expression plasmid was included as an internal control. The DNA/DOTAP/DOSPER mixture of 16–20 μg of DNA supplemented with 60 μl of DOTAP and 40 μl of DOSPER in 200 μl of 1× HEBS buffer was incubated for 10 min at room temperature and mixed with 14.4 ml of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum or 2% horse serum. Subsequently, 0.6 ml/well of the DNA/DOTAP/DOSPER mixture was added to the cells and incubated for 16–24 h. Post-transfection, the medium was replaced, and the cells were grown a further 48 h. Cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity. The luciferase activity in sample was normalized by determining β-galactosidase activity. Each experiment represented at least two sets of independent triplicates to overcome the variability inherent in transfection experiments. Total RNA from mouse tissues and C2C12 cells was isolated using RNeasy kits (Qiagen Inc.) according to the supplier's total RNA isolation procedure. Real time PCR was performed using a PerkinElmer/ABI 7700 prism. RNA samples were incubated with 1 unit RNase-free DNase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per 1.6 μg of total RNA for 40 min at 37 °C followed by a 10-min incubation at 75 °C. For each target quadruplicate reactions, each containing 100 ng of total RNA (including one minus reverse transcriptase control), were utilized. RNA was reverse-transcribed using 10 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 400 nm target-specific reverse primer, 500 μmdNTPs, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× Superscript II buffer. Quantitative PCR of reverse transcriptase reactions was carried out with 1.25 units of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), 1×Taq buffer, 3 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 400 nm target-specific forward and reverse primers, and 100 nm target-specific fluorogenic probe. All assays were run for 40 cycles (95 °C for 12 s followed by 60 °C for 60 s). Probes and primers were designed using Primer Express (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Levels of cyclophilin were measured in all in vivo samples, and the results are presented as the number of target transcripts per cyclophilin transcript. GAPDH was used to normalize transcript levels in the experiments using C2C12 cells. C2C12 cells were differentiated as described above for 48 h and then labeled with [14C]cholesterol for an additional 48 h. Labeled cells were washed, and efflux was initiated in medium with or without 10 μg/ml apoAI in the absence or presence of receptor-specific ligands. After 24 h, media were removed, cell debris was pelleted, and radioactivity in the media was determined by scintillation counting. To determine the cell-associated radioactivity, cells were lysed in 0.2 m sodium hydroxide, and radioactivity was determine by scintillation counting. Percent efflux was calculated by dividing the radioactivity in the media by the sum of the radioactivity in the media and cell lysate. ApoAI-dependent efflux was determined by subtracting the efflux observed in the absence of added apoAI. Statistical analysis was carried out using a two-tailed unpaired t test. Treatment of rodents with synthetic LXR agonists has been shown to increase expression of genes involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism in liver, intestine, and adipose tissue (1Schultz J.R., Tu, H.

To examine the activity of LXR in skeletal muscle, we first quantitated the mRNA levels of LXRα and LXRβ in the quadriceps of mice and determined that LXRα and LXRβ are expressed in skeletal muscle at similar levels (Fig.1 A). To further define the functional activity of skeletal muscle LXR, wild type and LXRαβ−/− mice were treated with the synthetic LXR agonist T0901317 (1Schultz J.R., Tu, H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C., Li, L. Schwendner S. Wang S. Thoolen M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Lustig K.D. Shan B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2831-2838Google Scholar) for 7 days. After treatment, total RNA was isolated from quadriceps, and LXR-dependent gene expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 1,B–F, treatment with LXR agonist increases the mRNAs encoding known LXR target genes including ABCA1 (4.5-fold), SREBP1c (8.3-fold), and apoE (2.3-fold). In contrast to what has been observed in livers of treated mice (1Schultz J.R., Tu, H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C., Li, L. Schwendner S. Wang S. Thoolen M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Lustig K.D. Shan B.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2819-2830Google Scholar), the mRNAs encoding SCD-1 and FAS are not induced by LXR agonist treatment in muscle. Nevertheless, SCD-1 and FAS are significantly induced by LXR agonist treatment in the livers of these same animals (Fig. 2). LXR agonist-dependent induction of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis in the liver most likely account for the increase plasma triglyceride levels observed in agonist-treated mice (Fig.2 D). As expected, all agonist-dependent effects on gene expression are completely eliminated in LXRαβ−/− mice.Figure 2LXR agonist-dependent induction of SCD-1 and FAS in the liver. LXRαβ+/+ and LXRαβ−/− mice (n = 4, the same mice used in Fig. 1) were treated for 7 days in the absence (white bars) or presence (black bars) of the LXR agonist T0901317 (10 mg/kg), and total RNA was isolated from the liver. Expression of the mRNAs encoding SREBP1c (A), SCD-1 (B), and FAS (C) was determined by real-time quantitative PCR. Levels of cyclophilin were measured in all samples, and the results are presented as the number of target transcripts per cyclophilin transcript. RNA from each individual animal was assayed in quadruplicate. Plasma triglyceride levels (D) were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”p values indicate statistically significant differences between vehicle- and T0901317-treated animals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The results of Fig. 1 indicate that skeletal muscle is responsive to LXR ligands. Studies in vivo, however, do not rule out the possibility that effects on skeletal muscle gene expression are indirect, arising from the ability of LXR agonists to influence cholesterol and lipid metabolism in other tissues. To confirm that LXR is active in skeletal muscle we turned to the well established mouse C2C12 myoblast cell line as a model. Proliferating C2C12 myoblasts can be induced to biochemically and morphologically differentiate into post-mitotic multinucleated myotubes by serum withdrawal in culture over a 96-h period. This transition from a non-muscle phenotype to contractile phenotype is associated with the repression of non-muscle proteins and the activation of the contractile apparatus and metabolic enzymes. Treatment of differentiated myotubes (72 h after serum withdrawal) with T0901317-induced expression of LXR target genes involved in reverse cholesterol transport including ABCA1, ABCG1, a second ABC transporter implicated in cholesterol transport, and apoE (Fig. 3, A–C). In macrophages several studies have shown that ligands for PPARγ can also induce expression of ABCA1 indirectly via up-regulation of the gene encoding LXRα. Thus, at least in macrophages, LXRs are thought to act downstream of PPARγ in a signaling cascade that leads to induction of ABCA1 and increases in reverse cholesterol transport. In C2C12 cells, however, the PPARγ ligand BRL49653 has little or no effect on the expression of ABCA1 (Fig. 3 A) or any other LXR target gene examined (data not shown). Thus PPARγ ligands do not act directly on skeletal muscle to influence expression of genes that regulate reverse cholesterol transport. Similarly, activators of PPARδ do not induce ABCA1 in C2C12 cells (data not shown). LXR target genes that contribute to lipogenesis such as SREBP1c, FAS, and SCD-1 were also induced by LXR agonist in C2C12 cells (Fig. 2, D–F). As observed in vivo, however, the induction of SREBP1c (8-fold) was much greater than the induction observed for SCD-1 (1.5-fold) and FAS (3-fold). Binding sites for LXR-retinoid X receptor heterodimers have been identified in the promoters of the ABCA1 and SREBP1c, and these genes have been shown to be direct targets of LXR in the liver, intestine, and macrophages (1Schultz J.R., Tu, H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C., Li, L. Schwendner S. Wang S. Thoolen M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Lustig K.D. Shan B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2831-2838Google Scholar, 8Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A.

To evaluate the ability of endogenous LXRs to directly activate SREBP1c and ABCA1 in muscle, promoter-reporter constructs were transfected into proliferating C2C12 myoblasts, and the cells were allowed to differentiate in the absence or presence of LXR agonist. As shown in Fig.4, there is a dramatic ligand-dependent induction of both promoters, indicating a direct action of endogenous LXRs on SREBP1c and ABCA1 in muscle cells. ABCA1 has been shown to be essential for the transfer of intracellular cholesterol to extracellular acceptors such as HDL, a process termed reverse cholesterol transport (17Hayden M.R. Clee S.M. Brooks-Wilson A. Genest Jr., J. Attie A. Kastelein J.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 117-122Google Scholar, 24Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Garvin M.R. Wang X. Schwartz K. Porter J.G. Seilhamer J.J.

The importance of ABCA1 to reverse cholesterol transport is illustrated by the finding that inactivation of ABCA1 in humans results in HDL deficiencies (17–19,25). Similarly, overexpression of ABCA1 has been shown to elevate HDL by increasing reverse cholesterol transport (26Attie A.D. Kastelein J.P. Hayden M.R. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1717-1726Google Scholar, 27Joyce C.W. Amar M.J. Lambert G. Vaisman B.L. Paigen B. Najib-Fruchart J. Hoyt Jr., R.F. Neufeld E.D. Remaley A.T. Fredrickson D.S. Brewer Jr., H.B.

Remaley A.T. Brewer Jr., H.B. Santamarina-Fojo S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 303-309Google Scholar). To date, most studies of reverse cholesterol transport have been carried out in fibroblasts and macrophages. Nevertheless, given the ability of LXRs to regulate ABCA1 expression in muscle in vitro andin vivo, we decided to measure reverse cholesterol transport in C2C12 cells. Treatment of [3H]cholesterol-labeled differentiated myotubes with T0901317 resulted in a 2.9-fold increase in the ability of these cells to efflux cholesterol to apoA1, and this effect was further enhanced by an agonist for LXR's heterodimeric partner retinoid X receptor (Fig. 5). Thus, skeletal muscle is a potential site for reverse cholesterol transport and may contribute to the control of HDL cholesterol levels. Once again, the PPARγ agonist BRL49653 had no effect. Several studies have shown that the gene encoding LXRα is induced during the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages, indicating an important role for this receptor in macrophage biology (29Kohro T. Nakajima T. Wada Y. Sugiyama A. Ishii M. Tsutsumi S. Aburatani H. Imoto I. Inazawa J. Hamakubo T. Kodama T. Emi M. J. Atheroscler. Thromb. 2000; 7: 145-151Google Scholar, 30Laffitte B.A. Joseph S.B.

Collins J.L. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43509-43515Google Scholar). To examine LXR activity during skeletal myogenesis, expression levels of LXRα and LXRβ were measured in differentiating C2C12 cells (Fig.6). LXRα is induced beginning when cells reach confluence (Fig. 6 A, CMB) and peaking as myoblasts exit the cell cycle and form differentiated multinucleated cells (Fig. 6 A, MT1), suggesting a role for this isotype in the myogenic process. In contrast, LXRβ mRNA is constitutively expressed during myogenic differentiation in culture and is 200-fold more abundant than LXRα in proliferating myoblasts (Fig.6 B). Northern analysis demonstrates the induction of myogenin mRNA (encoding the basic HLH protein), repression of the cytoskeletal non-muscle β/γ-actin mRNAs, and the activation of the sarcomeric α-actins relative to equivalent levels of GAPDH mRNA, confirming that these cells had terminally differentiated (Fig. 6 C). Analysis of LXR targets during myogenesis indicates that genes involved in reverse cholesterol transport (ABCA1, ABCG1, and apoE) are also induced from 4.7- to 29-fold (Fig. 7,A–C) during the differentiation process in the absence of added exogenous LXR ligands. The kinetics of the ABCA1, ABCG1, and apoE lag slightly behind the induction of LXRα and, thus, are consistent with the hypothesis that LXRα plays a role in inducing these genes. The LXR targets involved in lipogenesis (SREBP1c, SCD-1, and FAS), however, are poorly, if at all, induced during differentiation (Fig. 7,D–F). This observation is particularly interesting for SREBP1c and FAS, which have recently been shown to be directly regulated by LXRα (1Schultz J.R., Tu, H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C., Li, L. Schwendner S. Wang S. Thoolen M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Lustig K.D. Shan B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2831-2838Google Scholar, 21Repa J.J. Liang G., Ou, J. Bashmakov Y. Lobaccaro J.M. Shimomura I. Shan B.

Tontonoz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11019-11025Google Scholar). Nevertheless, treatment of differentiating C2C12 cells with LXR ligands increases the mRNAs for all LXR target genes examined including SREBP1c, SCD-1, and FAS (Fig. 2 and data not shown), indicating that endogenous LXRs are competent to activate these targets during myogenesis if a potent agonist is available. These observations suggest, at least during myogenesis, that the regulation of these two functional classes of LXR targets (cholesterol transport and fatty acid synthesis) can be temporally and mechanistically separated. In this study we demonstrate that both LXRα and LXRβ are expressed in skeletal muscle and can be functionally regulated by LXR agonists. The ability of LXRs to induce reverse cholesterol transport in skeletal muscle, most likely via the up-regulation of ABCA1, ABCG1, and apoE expression, suggests that this major mass tissue can make significant contributions to whole body cholesterol homeostasis. We have not detected LXR agonist-dependent effects on the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in muscle, indicating that increased reverse cholesterol transport is not stimulating de novo cholesterol synthesis (data not shown). Not surprisingly, the ability of LXR agonists to promote reverse cholesterol transport has stimulated great interest in the potential of small molecule activators of LXRs as therapeutic agents for the treatment of cardiovascular disease (3Chawla A. Repa J.J. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Google Scholar, 4Edwards P.A. Kast H.R. Anisfeld A.M. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2-12Google Scholar). Previous studies, however, focus on the therapeutic benefit of regulating reverse cholesterol transport in macrophage foam cells, a cell-type that directly contributes to atherosclerotic lesion development (32Glass C.K. Witztum J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 503-516Google Scholar). Based on the overall mass of skeletal muscle, our work also identifies this tissue as an important site of action for LXR-based drugs. LXRs also regulate fatty acid metabolism by controlling expression of SREBP1c, the master transcriptional regulator of fatty acid synthesis, and the enzymes that participate in this metabolic pathway (1Schultz J.R., Tu, H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C., Li, L. Schwendner S. Wang S. Thoolen M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Lustig K.D. Shan B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2831-2838Google Scholar, 21Repa J.J. Liang G., Ou, J. Bashmakov Y.

Not surprisingly, treatment of experimental animals with LXR agonists results in significant increases in hepatic and serum triglycerides (1Schultz J.R., Tu, H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C., Li, L. Schwendner S. Wang S. Thoolen M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Lustig K.D. Shan B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2831-2838Google Scholar). The ability of LXRs to regulate fatty acid metabolism in skeletal muscle has important consequences for carbohydrate and lipid homeostasis. In response to insulin, skeletal muscle accounts for the majority of glucose uptake in the body. Insulin also induces SREBP1c expression in skeletal muscle, and this regulation is defective in patients with type II diabetes (33Ducluzeau P.H. Perretti N. Laville M. Andreelli F. Vega N. Riou J.P. Vidal H. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1134-1142Google Scholar). Thus LXR ligands should partially mimic insulin by inducing SREBP1c in muscle and may function as insulin sensitizers. However, significant correlations also exist between high levels of intra-muscular lipid content and insulin resistance (34Kelley D.E. Goodpaster B.H. Diabetes Care. 2001; 24: 933-941Google Scholar, 35Kraegen E.W. Cooney G.J., Ye, J. Thompson A.L. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 2001; 109: 516-526Google Scholar), suggesting that increased fatty acid synthesis by muscle may also have adverse effects. Interestingly, although SREBP1c is induced in skeletal muscle by LXR ligands, two down-stream targets involved in fatty acid synthesis, SCD-1 and FAS, are not. Thus, in muscle LXR activity may be uncoupled from fatty acid metabolism. Clearly additional studies will be needed to fully understand the cross-talk between insulin signaling and LXR transcriptional activity. The accumulation of cholesterol by macrophages in the arterial wall via the uptake of oxidized LDL particles is one the first steps in the development of atherosclerosis (32Glass C.K. Witztum J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 503-516Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, the ability of LXR to regulate reverse cholesterol transport in macrophages,i.e. the efflux of intracellular cholesterol to extracellular HDL particles, has stimulated great interest in understanding how LXR activity is regulated. In macrophages a second member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, PPARγ, directly regulates the gene encoding LXRα (36Chawla A. Boisvert W.A. Lee C.H. Laffitte B.A. Barak Y. Joseph S.B. Liao D.

Interestingly, agonists of PPARγ increase reverse cholesterol transport in isolated macrophages (10Venkateswaran A. Laffitte B.A. Joseph S.B. Mak P.A. Wilpitz D.C. Edwards P.A. Tontonoz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12097-12102Google Scholar, 37Oliver Jr., W.R. Shenk J.L. Snaith M.R. Russell C.S. Plunket K.D. Bodkin N.L. Lewis M.C. Winegar D.A. Sznaidman M.L.

Brown K.K. Silvestre M.J. Willson T.M. Palinski W. Glass C.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 523-531Google Scholar). Based upon these observations and the ability of LXR to directly regulate ABCA1, it has been suggested that induction of LXRα accounts at least in part for the ability of PPARγ agonists to stimulate reverse cholesterol transport (3Chawla A. Repa J.J. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Google Scholar, 4Edwards P.A. Kast H.R. Anisfeld A.M. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2-12Google Scholar). In muscle, however, PPARγ is expressed at relatively low levels, and in differentiated C2C12 myotubes a potent synthetic PPARγ agonist does not induce expression of ABCA1 or increase reverse cholesterol transport. Thus when compared with PPARγ ligands, activators of LXR may have the added benefit of stimulating reverse cholesterol transport in a cell type that accounts for ∼40% of human total body weight. Taking advantage of the C2C12 cell culture system we demonstrate that the mRNA encoding LXRα is induced during skeletal myogenesis just before the induction of LXR target genes involved in reverse cholesterol transport (ABCA1, ABCG1, and apoE). Strikingly, however, LXR targets involved in fatty acid synthesis (SREBP1c, FAS, and SCD-1) are not coordinately regulated with LXRα. These observations support the hypothesis that there are inherent differences in the regulation of these two classes of LXR targets. This apparent dichotomy in the LXR-dependent regulation of genes involved in reverse cholesterol transport and fatty acid metabolism has important implications for the development of LXR agonists as therapeutic agents. Increasing expression of ABC transporters and apoE with LXR agonists has several beneficial effects including increasing reverse cholesterol transport, elevating HDL cholesterol levels, and limiting the absorption of dietary cholesterol (7Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Google Scholar, 8Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J., Li, L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J.

In contrast, the LXR-dependent hypertriglyceridemia induced at least in part by up-regulation of fatty acid synthesis is an undesirable side effect (1Schultz J.R., Tu, H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C., Li, L. Schwendner S. Wang S. Thoolen M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Lustig K.D. Shan B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2831-2838Google Scholar). The differential induction of these two classes of LXR target genes observed in skeletal muscle and during myogenesis, however, suggests that there are mechanistic differences in the regulation of each target class that can be exploited for drug development. Future studies that define the mechanistic basis for this differential regulation will contribute to an understanding of biological function of LXR and assist in the development of effective LXR-based therapeutic agents.

Goodpasture autoantibodies bind two conformational epitopes (EA and EB) located within the non-collagenous (NC1) domain of this chain, which are sequestered within the NC1 hexamer of the type IV collagen network containing the α3(IV), α4(IV), and α5(IV) chains. In this study, the quaternary organization of these chains and the molecular basis for the sequestration of the epitopes were investigated. This was accomplished by physicochemical and immunochemical characterization of the NC1 hexamers using chain-specific antibodies. The hexamers were found to have a molecular composition of (α3)2(α4)2(α5)2 and to contain cross-linked α3-α5 heterodimers and α4-α4 homodimers. Together with association studies of individual NC1 domains, these findings indicate that the α3, α4, and α5 chains occur together in the same triple-helical protomer. In the GBM, this protomer dimerizes through NC1-NC1 domain interactions such that the α3, α4, and α5 chains of one protomer connect with the α5, α4, and α3 chains of the opposite protomer, respectively.

Type IV collagen, the main structural component of the GBM, has been implicated in several glomerular diseases. Goodpasture's (GP) disease is caused by anti-GBM autoantibodies that bind to the type IV collagen networks of the GBM, and, in some patients, of the alveolar basement membranes (1Wilson C.B. Borza D.B. Hudson B.G. Theofilopoulos A.N. Bona A.C. The Molecular Pathology of Autoimmune Diseases. 2nd Ed. Gordon & Breach Science Publishers/Harwood Academic Publishers, Newark, NJ2002: 981-1010Google Scholar). The bound antibodies induce an inflammatory response causing rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage. The GP autoantibodies are specifically targeted to the non-collagenous domain (NC1) of the α3(IV) chain, the “Goodpasture autoantigen,” one of the six chains that comprise the collagen IV family (2Saus J. Wieslander J. Langeveld J.P. Quinones S. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13374-13380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two conformational GP epitopes, designated EA and EB, have been localized within the α3(IV) NC1 domain at residues 17–31 and 127–141, respectively (3Netzer K.O. Leinonen A. Boutaud A. Borza D.B.

The GP epitopes are sequestered in the type IV collagen network of native basement membranes by quaternary interactions among NC1 domains (4Borza D.B. Netzer K.O. Leinonen A. Todd P. Cervera J.

How the α3(IV) chain is organized in the collagen IV network of GBM is unknown. Collagen IV networks are composed of triple-helical protomers that are connected at the carboxyl termini by NC1-to-NC1 interactions, forming dimers of protomers, and at the amino termini by interactions involving the 7 S domain, forming tetramers (5Timpl R.

In the GBM, an α1·α2(IV) network and a distinct α3·α4·α5(IV) network have been identified based on differential solubilization with pseudolysin (7Gunwar S. Ballester F. Noelken M.E. Sado Y.

The protomer and network organization of α1(IV) and α2(IV) chains has been well established and confirmed by the recent determination of the crystal structure of the [(α1)2α2]2(IV) NC1 hexamer (9Sundaramoorthy M.

In contrast, little is known about the organization of α3(IV), α4(IV), and α5(IV) chains, i.e. which combinations of three chains form protomers, what is the relative position of chains within protomers, and which kinds of protomers associate through NC1-to-NC1 interactions. This information is essential for understanding the molecular basis of GP disease. The GP epitopes are sequestered within the NC1 hexamer structure of the α3·α4·α5(IV) network and inaccessible for autoantibody binding unless the hexamer dissociates (4Borza D.B. Netzer K.O.

Unmasking the GP epitopes is thought to be critical for etiology and pathogenesis of GP disease, but the molecular basis for the epitope sequestration is not known (12Kalluri R. Sun M.J. Hudson B.G. Neilson E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9062-9068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Based on the identification of hydrophobic residues in the epitope of the immunodominant GPA autoantibodies, it has been proposed that the epitope is buried at the interface between interacting NC1 domains (13David M. Borza D.B. Leinonen A. Belmont J.M. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6370-6377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). An analysis of the homologous α1·α2(IV) NC1 hexamer structure revealed that the GP epitopes are located adjacent to the triple-helical domain and to the interfaces between NC1 monomers within a protomer (9Sundaramoorthy M. Meiyappan M. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31142-31153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 10Than M.E. Henrich S. Huber R. Ries A. Mann K. Kuhn K.

In the present study, the quaternary organization of the α3(IV) chain in relation to the α4(IV) and α5(IV) chains in the network was investigated to determine: (a) which chains coexist and their relative position in the triple-helical protomers, (b) how the protomers are connected through the NC1 domains, and (c) how the GP epitopes are sequestered. The results unambiguously identify a single quaternary organization of the α3·α4·α5 NC1 hexamer revealing that the α3, α4, and α5 chains coexist in a single protomer that self-associates through NC1-NC1 domain interactions to form a network. Moreover, the immunodominant GP epitope, located within the EA region, is sequestered at the α3-α5 NC1 interface within the protomer, which partially buries residues required for autoantibody binding, whereas the EB epitope is sequestered at the α3-α4 NC1 interface. Based on these findings, we propose that the designation of Goodpasture autoantigen should henceforth refer to the α3·α4·α5(IV) triple-helical protomer, rather than to the α3(IV) collagen chain, as this molecules reflects both the organization and the cryptic property of the autoantigen in the GBM. Human glomeruli isolated from human kidneys by differential sieving were used to purify human GBM, which was solubilized by digestion with bacterial collagenase (Calbiochem), and then fractionated by ion-exchange and gel filtration to purify the NC1 hexamers of type IV collagen (14Wieslander J. Kataja M. Hudson B.G. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1987; 69: 332-340PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant (r-) human α3, α4, and α5 NC1 domains with NH2-terminal FLAG epitope were expressed in human kidney 293 cells and purified by affinity chromatography using immobilized anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), as described previously (15Sado Y.

A new monoclonal antibody specific for the EB region of α3 NC1 domain, designated mAb EB3, was produced by immunizing mice with human r-α3 NC1 monomers. Its specificity was determined by ELISA against a panel of α1/α3 NC1 chimeras (3Netzer K.O. Leinonen A. Boutaud A. Borza D.B. Todd P. Gunwar S. Langeveld J.P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol.

Several properties of mAb EB3 resemble those of human GPB autoantibodies: (a) its epitope is encompassed by the EB region, (b) it is cryptic in the NC1 hexamer, and (c) it is conformational. A full description of this antibody will be presented elsewhere. 2S. Colon, A. Leinonen, B. G. Hudson, and D.-B. Borza, manuscript in preparation. Several NC1 hexamer-binding mAbs were used for the immunoaffinity fractionation of native NC1 hexamers from human GBM. Mab1 and Mab3 were used for immunoprecipitation of α1- and α3-containing native NC1 hexamers, and immobilized rat mAbs B51 (to α5) and B66 (to α6) were used for affinity chromatography of hexamers containing the α5 and α6 chains, respectively, as described (17Borza D.B.

In addition, several novel hexamer-binding mAbs specific for the α4 NC1 domain were produced by the rat lymph node method (18Sado Y. Kagawa M. Kishiro Y. Sugihara K. Naito I. Seyer J.M. Sugimoto M. Oohashi T. Ninomiya Y. Histochem.

The specificities of these mAbs were determined by ELISA using human α1–α6 NC1 domains and all were found to be specific for human r-α4 NC1 monomers. Moreover, in indirect immunofluorescence of human kidney sections, mAbs RH42, RH45, and N42 exhibited a glomerular staining pattern identical to that of anti-α4 mAb H43. However, whereas mAb H43 recognized cryptic epitopes and required pretreatment of tissue sections with acid urea, the newly produced mAbs stained native sections, indicating that they bind to epitopes exposed in the NC1 hexamer. For further use in the affinity fractionation of NC1 hexamers, RH45 IgG was purified on protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and immobilized to Affi-Gel-10 (Bio-Rad), as described for mAbs B51 and B66 (17Borza D.B.

Affinity-purified α3·α4·α5(IV) NC1 hexamers, eluted from either the RH45 or the B51 affinity columns, were coated at 75–150 ng/well in microtiter plates in 3 m guanidinium chloride. Their reactivity with mAbs EB3, RH45, and H52 was measured by ELISA, using anti-rat IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase as secondary antibody. The amounts of α3, α4, and α5(IV) NC1 domains in the purified hexamers were quantified relative to standard curves, constructed by coating 10–100 ng of human r-α3, r-α4, and r-α5 NC1 monomers under the same conditions.

Binding to immobilized NC1 monomers of anti-α3 NC1 antibodies, alone or preincubated with r-α3 NC1 monomers (0.5 μg/ml for 1 h at room temperature), was measured by ELISA using the appropriate secondary antibodies (anti-mouse IgG, anti-rat IgG, or anti-human IgG) conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. The measurements were performed in triplicates. Human GBM NC1 hexamers (2–10 μg) were dissociated under various experimental conditions and immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies against α1–α5 NC1 domains (10–20 μg). The NC1 domains bound to the precipitating antibodies were collected on protein G-Sepharose, separated by SDS-PAGE in replicate gels, and analyzed by Western blots for the presence of α1–α5 NC1 domains. The choice of dissociation conditions was important, because complete dissociation of the NC1 hexamers into subunits had to be achieved without destroying the epitopes, to allow subsequent binding of the precipitating antibodies to the NC1 monomers and dimers. The optimal conditions were empirically determined to be heating with 0.5% SDS for 10 min at 60 °C, followed by 10–20-fold dilution with Tris-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The small amount of SDS remaining did not interfere with the binding of anti-NC1 antibodies, but was sufficient to prevent further non-covalent interactions among the dissociated NC1 domains, as demonstrated by the identification of a single species of NC1 monomers in the immunoprecipitate. PAGE was performed in gradient gels (10–22%) under non-reducing condition, using 200–300 ng of NC1 hexamer per lane. For two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (two-dimensional PAGE), the NC1 hexamers (3–15 μg) were separated in the first dimension by non-equilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis (19Gunwar S. Saus J. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5466-5469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), then in the second dimension by SDS-PAGE using a 10–22% gel gradient. The gels were silver-stained or transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis. After blocking with 2% casein, the membranes were reacted with monoclonal antibodies to α1–α5 NC1 domains (diluted 1:500–1:1000), incubated with the appropriate alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted 1:2000), then developed with 4-bromo-5-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium.

In the type IV collagen suprastructure, two triple-helical protomers interact at the carboxyl terminus via their NC1 domains, forming a stable NC1 hexamer complex that can be excised from basement membranes by collagenase digestion. Because of the special position of NC1 hexamers, connecting two adjoining protomers, the identity of monomer and dimer subunits of the hexamers reflects the chain composition of protomers, and the dimer subunits identify which chains are connected by covalent interactions between protomers. A strategy perfected for the analysis of NC1 hexamers from smooth muscle basement membranes that led to the discovery of a novel α1·α2·α5·α6(IV) network (17Borza D.B. Bondar O. Ninomiya Y. Sado Y. Naito I. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28532-28540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was used here to analyze the collagen IV network containing the α3, α4, and α5 chains. Previous studies of the NC1 hexamers from the GBM using immunoprecipitation with Mab3 antibody (to α3 NC1) revealed that α3 NC1 interacts with α4 NC1 and α5 NC1 forming a subset of NC1 hexamers distinct from the α1·α2 NC1 hexamers (8Boutaud A. Borza D.B. Bondar O. Gunwar S. Netzer K.O. Singh N. Ninomiya Y. Sado Y. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30716-30724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Whether this hexamer population consisted of α3/α4 or α3/α5 or α3/α4/α5 heterohexamers could not be determined because only an α3-precipitating antibody was available. Recently, we developed precipitating mAbs for α5 and α6 NC1 domains, designated B51 and B66, respectively (17Borza D.B. Bondar O. Ninomiya Y. Sado Y. Naito I. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28532-28540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Here, we introduce a novel precipitating mAb specific for the α4 NC1 domain, RH45. The availability of hexamer-binding mAbs to α3–α6 NC1 domains provided the experimental strategy to delineate hexamer organization (Fig.1). The hexamer population from a preparation of human glomeruli contains all six chains of type IV collagen (Fig. 1, i). Immunohistochemical studies have established that the GBM contains the α1–α5(IV) chains, Bowman's capsule basement membrane contains the α1, α2, α5 and α6(IV) chains, and the mesangial matrix comprises the α1 and α2(IV) chains (16Ninomiya Y.

Ninomiya Y. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Hence, hexamers containing α3 and α4 (along with α5) originate exclusively from the GBM, whereas those containing α6 originate exclusively from Bowman's capsule basement membrane. The α6-containing hexamers were removed from the mixture by absorption to an anti-α6 affinity column (mAb B66). The B66-bound fraction, representing ∼1% of the total hexamers, contained the α6 NC1 domain along with the α1, α2, and α5 NC1 domains (Fig. 1, ii). This composition, together with the mobility of dimers, indicate that the B66-bound hexamer population is identical to that identified in the smooth muscle basement membranes of aorta and bladder (17Borza D.B. Bondar O. Ninomiya Y. Sado Y. Naito I. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28532-28540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, the Bowman capsule contains the same α1·α2·α5·α6(IV) network found in smooth muscle. The unbound hexamers, containing the α1–α5 NC1 domains (Fig. 1,iii), were further analyzed with Mab3 (anti-α3), mAb RH45 (anti-α4), and mAb B51 (anti-α5). Mab3 bound hexamers that contained only the α3, α4, and α5 NC1 domains (Fig. 1,iv), as described previously, whereas those not bound contained only α1 and α2 NC1 domains (Fig. 1, vii). The later result indicates the presence of α1·α2(IV) hexamers (as confirmed by coprecipitation of α1 and α2 NC1 domains by Mab1; data not shown). The absence of α4 and α5 NC1 domains from the Mab3-unbound indicates that the α4(IV) and α5(IV) chains must always accompany the α3(IV) chain; this rules out the existence of α4 and α5 homohexamers as well as α4/α5 heterohexamers. Likewise, mAb RH45 bound hexamers consisting of the α3, α4, and α5 NC1 domains (Fig. 1, v), whereas the unbound hexamers contained only α1 and α2 NC1 domains (Fig. 1, vii). This indicates that α3(IV) and α5(IV) chains must accompany the α4(IV) chain, further ruling out α3 and α5 homohexamers, as well as α3/α5 heterohexamers. Finally, mAb B51 (Fig. 1, vi) bound hexamers containing α3, α4, and α5 NC1 domains, while the unbound fraction contained only α1 and α2 NC1 (Fig. 1,vii). Absence of the α3 and α4 NC1 domains from the unbound fraction indicates that the α3(IV) and α4(IV) chains must accompany the α5(IV) chain; this excludes α3 and α4 homohexamers as well as α3/α4 heterohexamers. Together, these data indicate that the α3, α4, and α5 NC1 domains originating from the GBM exist as heterohexamers composed of all three domains, but not as homohexamers, nor as α3/α4, α3/α5, or α4/α5 heterohexamers. The α3·α4·α5 heterohexamer can theoretically exists as ten distinct isoforms that differ in the stoichiometric composition of the three NC1 domains. Examples compositions are: (α3)2(α4)2(α5)2, (α3)1(α4)2(α5)3, and (α3)1(α4)1(α5)4. To distinguish among these, the relative abundance of each NC1 domain was measured by ELISA using chain-specific monoclonal antibodies: EB3 for α3NC1, RH45 for α4NC1, and H52 for α5NC1. These antibodies yielded linear calibration curves using known amounts of recombinant human NC1 domains (data not shown). The α3, α4, and α5 NC1 domains were found in approximately equimolar proportions: 37.4% ± 6.0%, 33.7% ± 6.0%, and 28.9 ± 7.8%, respectively (means and S.D. values from five determinations). These results indicate that the hexamer has a composition of (α3)2(α4)2(α5)2. This composition could reflect 18 distinct combinations in which two protomers (trimers of chains), varying in both chain composition and relative position of chains, interact in different trimer-trimer orientations forming a cross-linked hexamer (Fig.2). For example, in group I all protomers contain an α3, α4, and α5 chain, but the combinations differ with respect to the trimer-trimer orientations (as in A1, A2, and A3) and with respect to the orientation of the three chains in the protomer (as in A1, B1, and C1), for a total of nine combinations. In group II, two different protomers, differing in chain composition and different from group I, associate forming three additional combinations. Similarly, groups III and IV represent six additional combinations. Many of these combinations can be excluded by the identification of NC1 monomers that are cross-linked forming dimers. In most basement membranes, including the GBM, the NC1 hexamer contains a large proportion of NC1 dimers (∼75%) cross-linked by a covalent bond that connects two adjoining protomers in the network. Previously, this cross-link was identified as a disulfide bond (21Weber S. Dolz R. Timpl R. Fessler J.H. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 175: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but recent crystallographic studies suggested a cross-link between the conserved Met-93 and Lys-211 residues (10Than M.E. Henrich S. Huber R. Ries A. Mann K. Kuhn K. Timpl R. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Because each NC1 domain of a protomer can be cross-linked to the corresponding NC1 domain of the opposite protomer, each hexamer is characterized by three NC1 dimers that reflect specific trimer-trimer interactions. Thus, the identity of dimers that exist in the α3·α4·α5 heterohexamer reflects which chains are connected between protomers. Overall, the 18 hexamer isoforms shown in Fig. 2contain six possible dimer combinations. These are: α3-α3, α4-α4, and α5-α5 NC1 homodimers and α3-α4, α3-α5, and α4-α5 NC1 heterodimers. The absence of some of these NC1 dimer combinations would rule out the existence of certain hexamers isoforms. Two independent methods were used for this determination. Under the separation conditions in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the NC1 hexamers dissociate into their component subunits, NC1 monomers and dimers, which migrate to distinct positions according to their size and isoelectric point (22Langeveld J.P.

Saus J. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. Connect. Tissue Res. 1990; 24: 169-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Following separation by two-dimensional electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose, the NC1 domains from human GBM hexamers were identified by Western blot with chain-specific mAbs (Fig. 3), and the migration position of the NC1 dimers was analyzed. Both α1 and α2 NC1 dimers migrated to characteristic positions indicative of α1-α1 and α2-α2 homodimers, consistent with the known organization of the α1·α2(IV) hexamer, in which the two (α1)2α2 protomers are cross-linked by α1-α1 and α2-α2 bonds. Among the α3, α4, and α5 NC1 domains, only α4 NC1 dimers migrated to a distinct position, which demonstrates the existence of α4-α4 homodimers but rules out α4-α3 and α4-α5 heterodimers. The positions of α3 and α5 NC1 dimers overlapped significantly, suggesting the possible existence of α3-α5 heterodimers, as suggested previously (24Kleppel M.M. Fan W. Cheong H.I. Michael A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4137-4142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, because comigration does not prove the existence of a covalent link, the NC1 dimers of human GBM were also analyzed by immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig.4). This was achieved by first dissociating the NC1 hexamers into their component subunits (NC1 monomers and dimers), followed by precipitation with chain-specific antibodies (Fig. 4, top). Dissociation conditions were chosen that achieved complete dissociation of the hexamer, while allowing subsequent binding of the antibodies to the NC1 monomers and dimers subunits. Upon reaction with dissociated GBM hexamers subunits, H11 (to α1 NC1) and H22 (to α2 NC1) mAbs precipitated their respective NC1 monomers and homodimers. Likewise, mAb H43 (to α4 NC1) precipitated only α4 NC1 monomers and α4 NC1 dimers, indicating that the α4 NC1 domain forms α4-α4 homodimers, but not α4-α3, nor α4-α5 heterodimers. In contrast, several antibodies to the α3 NC1 domain (GPA autoantibodies, mAb EB3, mAb H31) precipitated α3 NC1 monomers and α3 NC1 dimersalong with α5 NC1 dimers of the"

During cell intoxication, this domain undergoes a change from a soluble and folded state at alkaline pH to a functional membrane-inserted state at acid pH. We found that hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions occur in a sequential manner between the domain and the membrane during the insertion. The first step involves hydrophobic interactions by the C-terminal region. This is because of the pH-induced formation of a molten globule specialized for binding to the membrane. Accumulation of this molten globule follows a precise molecular mechanism adapted to the toxin function. The second step, as the pH decreases, leads to the functional inserted state. It arises from the changes in the balance of electrostatic attractions and repulsions between the N-terminal part and the membrane.

Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 357: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 36Bennett M.J. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1464-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A central hydrophobic helical hairpin made of helices TH8 and TH9 is hidden from the solvent by two amphiphilic layers made of the TH1-TH4 and TH5-TH7 groups of α-helices. Such topology is found for other membrane-penetrating proteins such as the pore-forming domain of colicins (37Parker M.W. Pattus F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 391-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and the pro- or anti-apoptotic proteins belonging to the Bcl-2 family (38Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.L., Ng, S.L. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region (TH1-TH4) contains many negative and positive residues at neutral pH. We have found that first hydrophobic, and then electrostatic, interactions are involved during the insertion of the T domain in a membrane. On the basis of our results we propose a model that describes how these two kinds of interactions are controlled by pH and involve distinct regions of the domain. In a first step, hydrophobic interactions by the C-terminal TH8-TH9 helices are allowed by the pH-induced partial unfolding of the soluble form. In a second step, further acidification changes the balance of electrostatic attractions and repulsions between the N-terminal part of the domain and the membrane surface, leading to increased penetration into the membrane. Our study shows how the structural changes and the interaction with membranes of the T domain are finely tuned by pH changes to take advantage of the cellular uptake system. The recombinant T domain has been described previously (39Nizard P. Chenal A. Beaumelle B. Fourcade A. Gillet D. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 40Chenal A.

Cys-201 (native diphtheria toxin numbering) has been mutated to Ser. The protein was further purified on a 1-ml anion exchange column (HiTrapTMQ-SepharoseTM HP; Amersham Biosciences). Anionic lipid vesicles were prepared in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 7.8) from egg phosphatidyl choline (EPC) and egg phosphatidic acid (EPA) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) at a 9:1 molar ratio by reverse phase evaporation (41Rigaud J.L. Bluzat A. Buschlen S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,42Nizard P. Liger D. Gaillard C. Gillet D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) to obtain large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) or by sonication to obtain small unilamellar vesicles (SUV). The protein was kept in 20 mm phosphate buffer and was diluted in a range of 5 mm citrate buffers of various pH before spectroscopic measurements. The pH of the diluted protein was checked afterward. All experiments were done at 22 °C. CD experiments were performed on a CD6 spectrodichrograph (Jobin-Yvon Instruments, Longjumeau, France) as described previously (40Chenal A. Nizard P. Forge V. Pugniere M. Roy M.O. Mani J.C. Guillain F. Gillet D. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The scans were recorded using a bandwidth of 2 nm and an integration time of 1 s at a scan rate of 0.5 nm·s−1. The spectra were corrected for the blank, and a smoothing algorithm was then used with the minimum filter in the CD6 software (CDMax, filter 5). Fluorescence measurements were performed with an FP-750 spectrofluorimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) in a thermostated cell holder, using a 1-cm path length quartz cell as described previously (40Chenal A. Nizard P. Forge V. Pugniere M. Roy M.O. Mani J.C. Guillain F. Gillet D. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A bandwidth of 5 nm was used for both excitation and emission beams. The excitation wavelength was fixed at 295 nm where the contribution of Tyr is negligible. The emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 500 nm at a scan rate of 60 nm·min−1. Maximal emission wavelength (λmax) represents the average of five values obtained from emission spectra that were corrected for blank measurements. The various pH dependence monitored in this study were fitted with the following binding curve equation:S = S i + (S f − S i)/(1 + (K/H)nH), whereS is the signal used to monitor the reaction,Si and Sf are the initial and final values, respectively, H is the proton concentration, H = 10−pH, K is the dissociation constant, and n H is the Hill coefficient. When intrinsic fluorescence was used, we chose to show λmax as a function of pH, because it provides direct information about the Trp environment. Unlike the fluorescence intensity at a fixed wavelength, λmax is not an extensive variable. To be exact one should not use λmax to be fitted by a binding curve. In the case of intrinsic fluorescence of proteins, however, it can provide reliable thermodynamic parameters of a reaction (43Dumoulin M. Conrath K. Van Meirhaeghe A. Meersman F. Heremans K. Frenken L.G. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Matagne A. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 500-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). This is confirmed by our study where the pH dependence of λmax was systematically compared with a different kind of data (CD, partition, or fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)). In addition, we used the binding curve fitting to the pH dependence of λmax in the presence of membranes to estimate the value of λmax after the first step of the conformational change, to gather information about the Trp environment at that stage. Fast fluorescence time courses were recorded with an SFM-3 stopped-flow (Bio-Logic, Claix, France) equipped with a 15-μl observation chamber. The excitation wavelength was 299 nm (2-nm bandwidth), and the emitted light was detected through a cut-on filter excluding light below 330 nm. About 10 traces were accumulated for each experiment, and the average trace was fitted with the BioKine program (Bio-Logic, Claix, France). Experiments were performed as described previously (42Nizard P. Liger D. Gaillard C. Gillet D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Dansyl-DHPE (D-57; Molecular Probes) was mixed with methanol and dissolved by sonication to give a 12.18 mm stock solution. SUV containing dansyl were prepared from dansyl-DHPE, EPC, and EPA at a 5:90:10 molar ratio. For each pH, aliquots of T were added, and FRET was measured (Excitation wavelength: 292 nm; emission wavelength: 520 nm) until fluorescence intensity reached a plateau. Fluorescence intensity of the dansyl at the plateau was normalized to its initial fluorescence in the absence of T. A 5.23 mm stock solution of NBD-PE (N-360; Molecular Probes) was prepared in chloroform. LUV were prepared from EPC, EPA, and NBD-PE at a 90:10:0.3 molar ratio. Vesicles and proteins were incubated in 8 ml for 2 h. After fluorescence measurements, 4 ml of each sample were neutralized and centrifuged 2 h later. The other 4 ml were directly centrifuged in a Beckman L-70 ultracentrifuge using a Ti 70.1 rotor at 4 °C for 1.5 h at 70,000 rpm (350,000 × g). Pelleting efficiency was determined by comparison of the NBD-PE fluorescence (Excitation wavelength: 292 nm; emission wavelength: 520 nm) in the supernatant with that measured before centrifugation. The partitioning of T was determined as follows:p = (Fo −F)/Fo, whereFo and F are the fluorescence intensities of T before and after centrifugation, respectively. LUV were used instead of SUV, because they gave better pelleting. The far-UV CD spectrum of the T domain (Fig.2 A) indicates a substantial α-helix content, consistent with the structure deduced from x-ray crystallography (35Choe S. Bennett M.J. Fujii G. Curmi P.M. Kantardjieff K.A. Collier R.J. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 357: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 36Bennett M.J. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1464-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The amount of secondary structure does not depend on pH (Fig. 2 A). The near-UV CD spectrum of T at neutral pH, i.e. in the S-state, displays a large signal at 292 nm, which vanishes at acid pH (Fig. 2 B). This signal can be attributed to Trps stabilized in a rigid chiral environment, and it reveals their embedding in tertiary structure at neutral pH (44Kuwajima K. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Therefore, CD spectra show that at acid pH, i.e. in the A-state, the tertiary structure is lost whereas the secondary structure remains native-like. 1-Anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (ANS) binding experiments (data not shown) also indicate that hydrophobic surfaces become exposed to solvent, in agreement with earlier work (28Zhan H. Choe S. Huynh P.D. Finkelstein A. Eisenberg D. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11254-11263Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar,45Zhan H., Oh, K.J. Shin Y.K. Hubbell W.L. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4856-4863Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Moreover, the one-dimensional NMR spectrum of T at acidic pH shows a drastic diminution of the chemical shift dispersion, together with broader peaks, as compared with the spectrum in the native state (data not shown). Such an NMR spectrum indicates that important conformational exchanges occur in the A-state on the millisecond time scale (46Schulman B.A. Kim P.S. Dobson C.M. Redfield C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 47Balbach J. Forge V. van Nuland N.A. Winder S.L. Hore P.J. Dobson C.M. Nat. Struct.

Biol. 1999; 288: 673-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Overall, the structural characteristics of the A-state are those commonly accepted for the molten globule state, which is observed in the folding reaction of many proteins (49Arai M. Kuwajima K. Adv. Protein Chem. 2000; 53: 209-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The conformational change induced by acid pH is fully reversible, because the peak at 292 nm detected by CD in the near-UV at neutral pH and lost at acid pH is recovered after neutralization of the acid sample (Fig. 2 B). It is not possible to monitor the tertiary structure of T as a function of pH by near-UV CD because of aggregation of T around pH 5.5 at the protein concentrations needed for CD experiments (40Chenal A. Nizard P. Forge V. Pugniere M. Roy M.O. Mani J.C. Guillain F. Gillet D. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, this is possible by recording λmax of the Trps (Fig. 3). Aggregation is avoided, because lower protein concentrations are used for the fluorescence experiments. As the tertiary structure is destabilized, the Trp environment becomes more polar as shown by the red shift in λmax from 336 nm in the S-state to 342 nm in the A-state (Fig. 3), in agreement with previous studies (30Malenbaum S.E. Collier R.J. London E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17915-17922Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This change in the fluorescence spectrum occurs between pH 6 and 5 and is fully reversible regardless of the pH values investigated (Fig. 3). The pH dependence of the equilibrium between the S- and A-states can be described with a dissociation constant, pK Eq = 5.5, and a Hill coefficient, n H = 2.8 (Fig. 3), a value that indicates that at least three protons participate in a cooperative manner in the conformational change. For comparison, similar binding parameters were extracted from the near-UV CD changes of a fusion protein, ZZ-T (data from Ref. 40Chenal A. Nizard P. Forge V. Pugniere M. Roy M.O. Mani J.C. Guillain F. Gillet D. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), in which the structural and functional behaviors of T are preserved and that is soluble at the high concentrations needed for CD regardless of the pH. To gain more insight into the role of protons in the stabilization of the A-state, the kinetics of the transition from the S- to the A-state were monitored for various final pH values by recording the fluorescence change due to the conformational change. As in both steady-state and kinetics experiments the same phenomenon is monitored by using intrinsic fluorescence, it is possible to draw some conclusions regarding the mechanism of the pH-induced conformational change from the comparison of the two pH dependences. The kinetics of the fluorescence change were fitted with a single exponential decay. The observed rate constant (k obs) strongly increases from 0.7 s−1 at pH 4.85 to 44.4 s−1at pH 2.8 (Fig. 4) and seems to reach a plateau for pH values lower than 3 (Fig. 4, inset). It is difficult to obtain experimental k obs values for pH values lower than 2.8, because T becomes unstable. When the experiment is conducted in the reverse direction, i.e.starting from T prepared at pH 4.6 and then mixed with a buffer to reach a final pH of 7.8, the reaction is slower withk obs = 0.14 s−1. The pH dependence of the rate constant indicates that a binding of protons is associated with the rate-limiting step of the conformational change (50Kuwajima K. Mitani M. Sugai S. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 547-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 51Jamin M. Geierstanger B. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6127-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 52Guillain F. Gingold M.P. Buschlen S. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2072-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Forge V. Mintz E. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10961-10968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A simple way to describe the pH dependence of k obsis to consider that the proton binding is a fast event that precedes the conformational change. In that case k obs is controlled by this event and depends on the proportion of the protonated species. The final conditions used for the kinetic measurements are highly favorable to the A-state. Indeed, in these experiments the final pH is lower than 4.8, and according to the equilibrium experiments (Fig. 3), a large majority of the protein is in the A-state under these conditions. Therefore, as an approximation, we can consider the reaction as a one-way reaction. Then, the pH dependence of k obs can be written in terms of binding constants as follows: k obs =k 0/(1 + 10 (−n H(pK K i − pH))), where k 0 is the rate of the conformational change of the protonated S-state, pK K i is the dissociation constant of the proton binding to the S-state, and n H reflects the cooperativity of the binding. The pH dependence ofk obs can be described with the following parameters: pK K i = 3.6,n H = 1.4, and k 0 = 48 s−1 (±1 s−1) (Fig. 4). The pK and the cooperativity of the proton binding associated with the rate-limiting step of the conformational change are lower than those obtained at equilibrium, pK Eq = 5.5, andn H = 2.8. Thus, an additional binding of protons must occur after the rate-limiting step monitored in the kinetics. This additional binding must be of high affinity to increase the apparent pK and n H of the transition at equilibrium in contrast to those of the binding that control the rate of the conformational change. According to the two differentn H values obtained from kinetic and steady-state experiments, the binding of at least two protons is associated with the rate-limiting step of the conformational change (n H = 1.4), whereas at least three protons are involved in the whole conformational change (n H= 2.8). For the sake of simplicity in the model proposed below to interpret our results, we show the binding of only two and one-third protons for each step, respectively. SchemeFS1 is the minimal scheme to describe both the steady-state and kinetic experiments.Figure FS1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The sequential binding of two protons to the S-state accounts for the cooperative binding that controls the rate of the conformational change (S- to A-state). K 1a andK 1b can be calculated from the parameters of the pH dependence of k obs as follows:K 1a =K K i/(4/n H − 2) and K 1b = K K i × (4/n H − 2) (54Forge V. Mintz E. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10953-10960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The values we obtain with pK K i = 3.6 and n H= 1.4 are pK 1a = 3.55 and pK 1b = 3.7. These two initial protonations induce a conformational change that, in turn, exposes to the solvent at least one additional amino acid, now open to protonation. The binding of the third proton determines the dissociation constant and then H observed in the steady-state experiment. S, SH, and SH2 (the S-state with various amount of bound protons in Scheme FS1) have the same fluorescence characteristics,i.e. λm = 336 nm. SH2spontaneously changes its conformation in AH2 (the A-state with two bound protons), and this rate-limiting equilibrium (K 2 = SH2/AH2 =k alkaline/k acid) favors the AH2 species, which could be stabilized by a further protonation in AH3. Within AH2 and AH3, the Trps are more exposed to solvent, i.e.λm = 342 nm. In the rate-limiting equilibrium,k acid is determined from the pH dependence ofk obs, k acid =k 0 = 48 s−1. The rate of the conformational change induced by a pH jump from 4.6 to 7.8, which is highly favorable to the S-state, can be used as an approximation fork alkaline, k alkaline ≈ 0.14 s−1. Then, K 2 can be estimated, pK 2 ≈ 2.5, andK 3 can be calculated from these values and the parameters of the steady-state experiments (pK Eq= 5.5), pK 3 ≈ 6.75 (K 3≈K Eq3/K 1a K 1b K 2, the other terms of the relationship being negligible). One can notice here that such calculations can be helpful for the identification of the amino acids responsible for the sensitivity to the pH of the conformational change. The values of pK 1a and pK 1b (3.55 and 3.7, respectively) suggest that the protonations of aspartates (pK a3 = 3.9) or glutamates (pK a3 = 4.3) are responsible for the first step, whereas histidines (pK a3 = 6) could be involved in the second step (pK3 ≈ 6.75). The two Trps of the T domain are located in the TH1 and TH5 helices. When Trp fluorescence is used to monitor the pH-induced conformational changes of the T domain in the presence of anionic SUV made of a mixture of neutral and negative phospholipids (EPC and EPA 9/1, respectively), two steps are detected (Fig. 5 A). The first step occurs between pH 7 and pH 6. The shift of λmax from 336 to 344 nm indicates that the Trps become more accessible to the solvent. During the"

An appropriate level of tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for regulating cell growth, differentiation, metabolism, progression through the cell cycle, cell-cell communication, cell migration, gene transcription, ion channel activity, the immune response, and apoptosis/survival decisions (1Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Google Scholar). As observed with protein-tyrosine kinases, defective or inappropriate regulation of PTP activity leads to aberrant tyrosine phosphorylation, which contributes to the development of many human diseases including cancers and diabetes (2Zhang Z.-Y. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 416-423Google Scholar). The hallmark that defines the PTP superfamily is the active site amino acid sequence (H/V)C X 5 R(S/T), also known as the PTP signature motif, in the catalytic domain. Based on this unique structural feature, it is estimated that more than 100 PTPs are encoded in the human genome (3International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Google Scholar). Biochemical and structural studies have shown that all PTPs share a common mechanism of action and catalyze the same reaction, namely the hydrolysis of phosphotyrosine (4Zhang Z.-Y. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 209-234Google Scholar). However, the cellular processes in which the PTPs are involved can be both highly specialized and fundamentally important. Despite the large number of PTPs identified to date and the emerging roles played by PTPs in human diseases, a detailed understanding of the role played by PTPs in normal physiology and in pathogenic conditions has been hampered by the absence of PTP-specific inhibitors. Such specific small molecule inhibitors could serve as useful tools for determining the physiological functions of PTPs and may constitute valuable therapeutics in the treatment of several human diseases. There is intense interest in obtaining specific and potent PTP inhibitors for biological studies and pharmacological development (4Zhang Z.-Y. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 209-234Google Scholar,5Burke Jr., T.R. Zhang Z.-Y. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 225-241Google Scholar). However, there have been relatively few reports on potent and selective PTP inhibitors. An important issue that needs to be resolved is, given the highly conserved nature of the PTP active site, whether selectivity can be achieved in PTP inhibitor development. We believe that it is feasible to acquire potent and highly selective PTP inhibitory agents. This belief was prompted by previous findings that pTyr alone is not sufficient for high affinity binding to PTPs and that amino acid residues flanking the pTyr furnish additional interactions for efficient and high affinity PTP substrate recognition (6Zhang Z.-Y.

These results indicate that there are subpockets adjacent to the PTP active site that can also be targeted for inhibitor development. These studies, together with the discovery of a second aryl phosphate binding site adjacent to the active site in PTP1B (12Puius Y.A. Zhao Y. Sullivan M. Lawrence D.S. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13420-13425Google Scholar) provide a molecular basis for addressing and manipulating PTP inhibitor potency and specificity and suggest a novel paradigm for the design of potent and specific PTP inhibitors, namely bidentate ligands that bind to both the active site and a unique adjacent peripheral site. Consequently, unique PTP subpockets that border the active site may be targeted to enhance inhibitor affinity and selectivity. The rationale for the enhanced affinity of bidentate inhibitors is based on the principle of additivity of free energy of binding. The interaction of an inhibitor with two independent sites (e.g. pTyr site and a unique peripheral site) in one PTP would be expected to confer exquisite specificity, because other PTPs may not possess an identical second site interaction. To identify bidentate inhibitors capable of simultaneously occupying both the active site and a unique peripheral site in PTP1B, we have employed a combinatorial library/high throughput screening approach that lead to the identification of Compound 2 (see Fig. 1), which displays a K i value of 2.4 nm for PTP1B and exhibits several orders of magnitude selectivity in favor of PTP1B against a panel of PTPs (13Shen K. Keng Y.-F., Wu, L. Guo X.-L. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47311-47319Google Scholar). Compound 2 is the most potent and selective PTP1B inhibitor identified to date. This result serves as a proof-of-concept in PTP inhibitor development, as it demonstrates the feasibility of acquiring potent, yet highly selective, PTP inhibitory agents. Although we have demonstrated that it is possible to obtain potent and selective PTP1B inhibitors, it is not clear why Compound 2is so specific for PTP1B. To unravel the structural basis of PTP1B-inhibitor specificity, and to lay the groundwork for future design of more potent and specific compounds that can interfere with the processes that are controlled by PTP1B, we must first identify the regions that form the inhibitor binding sites. The present study was initiated to assess the exact binding mode between Compound2 and PTP1B, using hydrogen/deuterium exchange in combination with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic analysis. The results provide insights into the molecular basis of the potency and selectivity of Compound 2 for PTP1B. The increased understanding of PTP1B-inhibitor recognition may also stimulate efforts to design specific inhibitors “tailored” to other members of the PTP family. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) was purchased from Fluke Co. The procedure for the preparation of the stock solution of sodium orthovanadate has been described previously (9Wu L. Buist A. den Hertog J. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6994-7002Google Scholar). Pepsin was obtained from Worthington Biochemical Co. (Freehold, NJ), and D2O (99.9 atom % D) was from Isotec Inc. (Miamisburg, OH). All other chemicals and reagents were of the highest grade available commercially. All mutant forms of PTP1B were generated using the QuickChange kit from Stratagene. The oligonucleotide primers used for mutagenesis were from Sigma. All of the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. PTP1B was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified to homogeneity as described previously (12Puius Y.A. Zhao Y. Sullivan M. Lawrence D.S. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13420-13425Google Scholar). The PTP1B/N40A and PTP1B/N44A transformed cells were grown for 12 h at room temperature after isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. All mutant forms except R47A and R47E were purified similarly to wild-type PTP1B. R47A and R47E were purified using a procedure described previously (14Sarmiento M. Zhao Y. Gordon S.J. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26368-26374Google Scholar). Protein purity was checked by 12% SDS-PAGE, which showed a single band at 37 kDa. The protein concentration was determined from absorbance measurement at 280 nm using an absorbance coefficient of A 1 mg/ml280 = 1.24. PTP activity was assayed at 30 °C in a reaction mixture (0.2 ml) containing pNPP concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 5K m. The following buffered solution was used for activity measurements: at pH 7.0, 50 mm3,3-dimethylglutarate, 1 mm EDTA, and the ionic strength of 0.15 m, adjusted by addition of NaCl. Initial rate measurements for the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of pNPP were conducted as described previously (15Zhang Z.-Y. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1516-1525Google Scholar). The steady state kinetic parameters were determined from a direct fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the nonlinear regression program KINETASYST (IntelliKinetics, State College, PA). PTP1B-catalyzed hydrolysis of pTyr-containing peptides was continuously monitored at 282 nm using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 14 spectrophotometer (16Zhang Z.-Y. Thieme-Sefler A.M. Maclean D. Roeske R. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-15Google Scholar). The instrument was equipped with a water-jacketed cell holder, permitting maintenance of the reaction mixture at the desired temperature. The enzyme assays were conducted at 30 °C. When K m≪ [S], both k cat and K mvalues can be determined using the integrated Michaelis-Menten equation (16Zhang Z.-Y. Thieme-Sefler A.M. Maclean D. Roeske R. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-15Google Scholar) shown in Equation 1. t=p/kcatE0+(Km/kcatE0)ln[p∞/(p∞­p)]Equation 1 The reaction mixture (0.6ml) contained 100 μmsubstrate in 50 mm 3,3-dimethylglutarate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol with an ionic strength of 0.15 m (adjusted with NaCl). The reaction was initiated by addition of PTP1B at a final concentration in the range of 7 to 1800 nm PTP1B. The data were analyzed using a nonlinear least squares regression program (KaleidaGraph; Synergy Software). Inhibition constants were determined for the wild-type PTP1B and the mutants in the following manner. At various fixed concentrations of the inhibitor, the initial rate at various pNPP concentrations was measured by following the production ofp-nitrophenol as described above. All experiments were performed at 30 °C in 50 mm 3,3-dimethylglutarate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EDTA with an ionic strength of 0.15 m adjusted with NaCl. EDTA was excluded from the buffer for measurements with vanadate as an inhibitor. The inhibition constant and inhibition pattern were evaluated using the direct curve-fitting program KINETASYST (IntelliKinetics) to the appropriate equations. The complex of PTP1B with Compound2 was formed by incubating 320 μm PTP1B with 1 mm inhibitor in 50 mm 3,3-dimethylglutarate H2O buffer, pH 7.0, ionic strength 0.15 m(adjusted with NaCl), for at least 1 h at 4 °C. Hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange was initiated by adding 1 μl of a 320 μm PTP1B or PTP1B-inhibitor complex solution to 19 μl of 50 mm 3,3-dimethylglutarate buffer in 99.9 atom % D2O, pD 7.0, ionic strength 0.15 m (adjusted with sodium chloride). The resulting H/D exchange solutions were maintained at 25 °C using a water bath and allowed for exchange for different periods of time. At appropriate intervals, H/D exchange reaction was quenched by the addition of an equal volume of cold 0.5m phosphate buffer, pH 2.5, in the absence or presence of 20 μm pepsin. Pepsin digestion was performed at 0 °C for 4 min. Deuterated protein solution or pepsin digest was loaded immediately onto a Vydac 1.0 × 50-mm C4 or C8 column, respectively. A Shimadzu HPLC equipped with two LC-10AD pumps was used to generate an acetonitrile gradient. Solvent A was 94.95% H2O containing 5% acetonitrile and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, and Solvent B was 95% acetonitrile containing 4.95% H2O and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. A low volume static mixing tee was used to minimize the delay period for HPLC. The solvent precooling coil, static mixing tee, Rheodyne injector, and column were immersed in an ice bath (0 °C) to minimize back exchange with HPLC solvents. Desalted at 5% solvent B for 5 min, the protein eluted at ∼1.7 min with a 2-min 5–95% B gradient, and the peptic peptides eluted between 2.2 and 7.4 min with a 0.5-min 5–15% B gradient followed by an 8-min 15–45% B gradient. The column effluent (50 μl/min) was delivered directly to a ThermoQuest (Riviera Beach, FL) LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer for mass analyses of deuterated protein and its peptic peptides. MagTran 1.0 software (written by Dr. Zhongqi Zhang) was used to determine the centroid value for each peak in the list processed from the mass spectrum. To identify the sequences of peptic peptides, tandem mass spectrometry was performed on HPLC fractions of the peptic digest collected at 30-s intervals. The extent of deuterium exchange was calculated using Equation 2 (17Wang F., Li, W. Emmett M.R. Hendrickson C.L. Marshall A.G. Zhang Y.L. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15289-15299Google Scholar), D=m­m0%m100%­m0%HEquation 2 where m is the measured mass of deuterated protein or peptide, m0% is the measured mass of a “zero-deuteration” control prepared by adding 1 μl of 320 μm protein solution into a 19:20 (v/v) mixture of deuterated buffer and quenching buffer, m100%is the measured mass of a “full-deuteration” control prepared by incubating a deuterated protein sample for 5 h at 60 °C followed by addition of an equal volume of cold quenching buffer, and H is the total exchangeable amide hydrogens. All moisture-sensitive reactions were carried out in oven-dried glassware under a positive pressure of dry N2 or Ar. 2-(1H-Benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-uronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), Fmoc-amino acids,N-hydroxybenzotriazole, N-methylmorpholine, piperidine, Rink amide resin, and triisopropylsilane for solid-phase synthesis were purchased from Advanced ChemTech. Cesium carbonate, cuprous bromide, benzyl bromide, diethyl bromodifluorophosphonate, dryN,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), dryN,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), iodotrimethylsilane, NMR solvents, and zinc powder were purchased from Aldrich. HPLC-grade solvents acetonitrile, DMF, ethyl acetate, ethyl ether, and methylene chloride were purchased from Fisher Scientific. 4-Iodophenylacetic acid was purchased from Lancaster Synthesis.

Chem. 2001; 276: 47311-47319Google Scholar) or the following modified procedure: to a mixture of 4-iodophenylacetic acid (360 mg, 1.4 mmol), Cs2CO3 (500 mg, 1.5 mmol), and benzyl bromide (260 mg, 1.5 mmol) was added dry DMF (5 ml), and the suspension was stirred at room temperature overnight before it was filtered. The filtrate was subjected to CH2Cl2/water extraction, and the organic portion was concentrated and flash column-purified to furnish 420 mg (87% yield) of benzyl 4-iodophenylacetate ( 1The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; ESI, electrospray ionization; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectroscopy; pTyr, phosphotyrosine; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; HBTU, 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-uronium hexafluorophosphate; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; DMA, N,N-dimethylacetamide; DMF, N,N-dimethylformamide; P-loop, phosphate-binding loop.H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.7 (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 2H), 7.4–7.3 (m, 5H), 7.1 (d,J = 8.3 Hz, 2H), 5.1 (s, 2H), 3.6 (s, 2H);13C NMR (75 MHz, CDCl3) δ 171, 138, 136, 134, 131, 128.7, 128.5, 128.3, 93, 67, 41). Zinc powder (260 mg, 4 mmol) in DMA (3 ml) was sonicated for 1 h prior to treatment with a solution of diethyl bromodifluorophosphonate (13Shen K. Keng Y.-F., Wu, L. Guo X.-L. Lawrence D.S.

Sonication was continued for an additional 3 h, and then cuprous bromide (0.65 g, 4.5 mmol) was added in one portion. After 30 min a DMA solution (2 ml) of benzyl 4-iodophenylacetate (358 mg, 1 mmol) was added dropwise, and the resulting mixture was stirred for 24 h, diluted with ethyl acetate, washed with water and brine, dried over sodium sulfate, and filtered, and the solvent was removed via rotary evaporation. Flash column chromatography afforded the desired product benzyl 4-[(diethylphosphono)difluoromethyl]phenylacetate (277 mg, 66%), as confirmed by NMR (13Shen K. Keng Y.-F., Wu, L. Guo X.-L. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47311-47319Google Scholar). Synthesis was performed on Rink amide resin using a standard protocol for HBTU/N-hydroxybenzotriazole/N-methylmorpholine activation of carboxylic acids. The coupling reaction was performed in DMF for 1.5 h using a 3-fold excess of acid relative to resin-bound amine.

Most of previous work on PTP inhibitor development has been focused on PTP1B (4Zhang Z.-Y. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 209-234Google Scholar). PTP1B is considered as a negative regulator of the insulin-stimulated signal transduction pathway (21Ahmad F., Li, P.M. Meyerovitch J. Goldstein B.J. J. Biol.

These observations suggest that specific PTP1B inhibitors may enhance insulin sensitivity and act as effective therapeutics for the treatment of Type II diabetes, insulin resistance, and obesity. However, in addition to a role in insulin signaling, PTP1B is also implicated in several other physiological and pathological processes including transformation by Neu oncogene (26Wiener J.R.

The results described above suggest that PTP1B may be a participant in several signaling pathways. Thus, it is highly desirable to obtain specific and potent PTP1B inhibitors to further elucidate its roles in various signaling pathways and to develop PTP1B-based therapeutics. We have recently acquired Compound 2 (Fig.1), the most potent (K i = 2.4 nm) and selective PTP1B inhibitor identified to date, which exhibits several orders of magnitude selectivity in favor of PTP1B against a panel of PTPs (13Shen K. Keng Y.-F., Wu, L. Guo X.-L. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47311-47319Google Scholar). Although Compound 2 contains several negative charges, which may prevent its direct usage in cell-based assays, we have prepared several cell-permeable analogs that are highly effective in inhibiting PTP1B in several cell lines. 2L.-P.

The goal of the present study was to probe in detail the interactions between PTP1B and Compound 2 by a combination of kinetics, mass spectrometry, and site-directed mutagenesis experiments. The results have led to an increased understanding of the molecular basis for potent and specific PTP1B inhibition. This understanding is essential for the further development of more potent and selective PTP1B inhibitors and for the design of specific inhibitors tailored to other members of the P"

Using a novel LRP receptor fusion construct, a type I transmembrane protein chimera, termed sIgG-LRP (bearing the intracellular COOH-terminal tail of human LRP as recombinant fusion to a transmembrane region plus the extracellular IgG-Fc domain), we here investigated LRP signal transduction specificity in intact cells. First and similar to activated α2-macroglobulin as agonist of endogenous LRP, expression of sIgG-LRP demonstrated significant apoptosis protection. Second and similar to α2-macroglobulin-induced endogenous LRP, sIgG-LRP is sufficient to negatively modulate mitogen-induced Elk-1 and cJun (but not NF-κB) transcriptional activity. Third, expression of sIgG-LRP also impaired cJun transactivation mediated by constitutive active mutants of Rac-1 and MEKK-1. Fourth and unexpectedly, sIgG-LRP expression was found to be associated with a marked enhancement of mitogen-induced cJun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. Fifth, confocal microscopic examination and subcellular fractionation demonstrated that sIgG-LRP and JNK co-localize in transfected cells. Therefore, sIgG-LRP expression was found to significantly impair activation-induced translocation of JNK into the nucleus. Taken together, we here demonstrate that sIgG-LRP protein sequesters activated JNK into the plasma membrane compartment in intact cells, inhibiting nuclear activation of the JNK-dependent transcription factors Elk-1 and cJun.

Nevertheless, the cellular signaling function of these receptor families are not well understood, and no systematic investigation on downstream effector functions has yet been performed. Studies presented here are focused on the elucidation of intracellular key signaling pathways that occur downstream of LRP (as one representative member of this family) and in direct comparison downstream of APP activation. Given the complex situation of the LRP ectodomain binding protein network, we here employed the established chimeric receptor approach (21Romeo C. Kolanus W. Amiot M. Seed B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1992; 57: 117-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kolanus W. Romeo C. Seed B. Cell. 1993; 74: 171-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), fusing a transmembrane region and the extracellular sIgG Fc-domain to the intracellular tails of APP and LRP, respectively. Our results indicate that in the transfected Jurkat TAg cell line ectopic expression of the cytoplasmic domain of LRP (but not or at least much less of APP), as a specific constituent downstream or parallel of MEKK-1, exerts modifying signaling functions and that active JNK is sequestered by plasma membrane resident LRP multiprotein complexes, preventing JNK from translocation into and transactivation of Elk-1 and cJun within the nucleus. Thus, this study formally demonstrates, for the first time, that lipoprotein receptors (via the established interaction with JIP) (15Gotthardt M. Trommsdorff M. Nevitt M.F. Shelton J. Richardson J.A.

Camptothecin was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), ionomycin, NGF, and native α2-macroglobulin were purchased from Sigma. Synthetic NF-κB-Luc construct and the Elk-1 and c-Jun PathDetectTM transreporting systems have been obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The plasmid encoding the murine major histocompatibility complex class I protein H2-Kk was purchased from Miltenyi Biotec (Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). The plasmids pEF-RacVI2, MEKK-1 catalytic fragment (Δ), JNK-2-HA, ERK-2-MYC, and pEF-bcl-2 were described recently (23Ghaffari-Tabrizi N. Bauer B. Villunger A. Baier-Bitterlich G. Altman A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1843-1846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For activation, α2-macroglobulin was incubated in 2m methylamine/50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)/150 mm NaCl for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. Unreacted methylamine was removed by dialysis for 48 h with 5 changes of HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) at 4 °C. Finally, α2-macroglobulin preparation was dialyzed again with serum-free BME Eagle W medium for 4 h and sterilized through a 0.22-μm filter and then stored at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks. Using recombinant PCR, appropriate restriction sites have been introduced into the human APP and LRP cDNA sequences (employing primers LRP-5′-MluI: 5′-GTATTCACGCGTAAGCGGCGAGTCCAAGGGGC-3′; LRP-3′-NotI: 5′-TCCGACGCGGCCGCCTACTATGCCAAGGGGTCCCCTATC-3′, and APP-5′-MluI: 5′-TTGGTGACGCGTAAGAAGAAACAGTACACATCCATTC-3′, APP-3′-NotI: 5′-GCTGCTGCGGCCGCCTACTAGTTCTGCATCTGCTCAAAGAA-3′ respectively).

Correct constructs have been identified and confirmed by restriction analysis and partial DNA sequencing employing primers p5C7-sense: 5′-TGCCCTCCCTGCGGCCCT-3′ and p5C7-antisense: 5′-TTACCAATGATTATTTCGTT-3′. For reporter gene analysis, anti-Fc antibody-mediated cross-linking was done for 16 h employing Dynabeads-Protein A (Dynal, Hamburg Germany) coated with rabbit anti-human IgG. For apoptosis detection soluble goat anti-human IgG was used for cross-linking. Cerebellar neurons were prepared from the cerebelli of 5–7-day-old beheaded rats (as described by Ref. 27Hatten M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 384-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) and cultivated in BME medium (complemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 30 mm glucose, and 20 mm KCl) on poly-l-lysine-coated 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 106/well at 37 °C and 5% CO2. PC12 cells were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium complemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 5% fetal calf serum, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated horse serum. Cells were fed every second day and split once a week (split ratio 1:10). Culture plates had to be coated with collagen S (120 μg/ml in distilled water). 24 h after medium exchange cells were harvested and washed in prewarmed PBS (10 min, 200 g, room temperature). 2 × 106 cells (resuspended in RPMI medium without supplements) were mixed with up to 45 μg of plasmid DNA (total volume 400 μl) and transferred into cuvettes and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The electroporation was performed in an Electro Cell Manipulator 600 using predetermined optimal conditions (250V, 48Ω, 1100 microfarads) (28Enzinger C. Wirleitner B. Lutz C. Bock G. Tomaselli B. Baier G. Fuchs D. Baier-Bitterlich G. Eur J. Cell Biol. 2002; 81: 97-202Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). After transfection cells were incubated at room temperature for an additional 15 min before cultured in RPMI medium with supplements at 37 °C. CD4+ Jurkat TAg T cells (a kind gift from Dr. G. Crabtree, Stanford University, Stanford, CA) that stably express the SV40-derived large T antigen were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium complemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. 24 h after medium change Jurkat TAg cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed three times in medium without supplements, resuspended at a concentration of 2 × 107 cells/400 μl, and incubated on ice for 15 min. Transient transfection of cells was performed by electroporation in a BTX T820 ElectroSquarePorator (ITC, Biotech, Heidelberg, Germany) apparatus using predetermined optimal conditions (volume, 400 μl of cell suspension; mode, 99 μs; voltage, 450 V; number of pulses, 5). After electroporation cells were incubated for 15 min at room temperature before cultured in RPMI medium with supplements at 37 °C. Reporter gene expression was measured in co-transfection assays using 20–30 μg of the sIgG expression constructs and 10 μg of NF-κB-Luc or 16 μg of pFRLuc promoter firefly luciferase reporter (RLU1) plus 4 μg of pFA-Jun or pFA Elk-1, respectively, as described in Ref. 29Bauer B. Krumbock N. Ghaffari-Tabrizi N. Kampfer S. Villunger A. Wilda M. Hameister H. Utermann G. Leitges M. Uberall F. Baier G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 3645-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar. After 30 h cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml PMA and 1 μg/ml ionomycin for up to 16 h or left unstimulated (Me2SO buffer control), as indicated. To allow a comparison between different experiments, which vary with regard to transfection efficiencies, the different cell populations to be tested were co-transfected with a housekeeping expression plasmid (0.3 μg of the Renilla luciferase reporter vector pTK-Renilla-Luc, RLU2, Promega, Madison, WI) driven by the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter, and results of enhancer/promoter activation (i.e. firefly luciferase reporter protein expression) were normalized to the corresponding Renilla luciferase reporter. Luciferase activities were determined using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and a 1450 Micro-Beta WALLAC Jet Liquid Scintillation and Luminescence Counter. PC12 cells were stimulated in triplicates with 5 μg/ml NGF-β for 16 h for reporter gene analysis. 50 μg/ml activated or native α2-macroglobulin were added. The results shown are obtained with different preparations of expression plasmids and represent the mean ± S.E. from representative experiments done in duplicates. sIgG surface expression of transfected cells was detected with goat anti-human IgG (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) and, as secondary reagent, donkey anti-goat IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson ImmunoResearch), each employed for 30 min at 4 °C and analyzed by FACS scan. SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions using 4–12% Bis/Tris-buffered gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) and MOPS-running buffer for 90 min at 150 V. Proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by semi-dry blotting (90 mA/112 cm2, 90 min, room temperature). Blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with primary antibodies over night at 4 °C and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce, 1:5.000) for 1 h at room temperature. For antigen detection enhanced chemiluminescence was used (Super Signal, Pierce). Cerebellar neurons were cultivated 4 days in full BME medium (on poly-l-lysine-coated glass cover slips) and then preincubated with 50 μg/ml activated or inactivated α2-macroglobulin for 16 h. Cells were washed once with prewarmed PBS and incubated with supplemented medium containing 8 μm Hoechst 33342 for 15 min at 37 °C in the dark. 5 μg/ml propidium iodide were added, and cells incubated for an additional 5 min. Cells were washed twice in PBS and counted in an axioplan fluorescence microscope (PI: excitation: 570 nm, emission: 590 nm/Hoechst: excitation: 400 nm, emission: 420 nm) and pictures were taken with an Olympus U-CMAD-2 camera. Jurkat TAg cells were co-transfected with 20 μg of the indicated pEF-neomycin empty vector control, bcl-2, or sIgG expression constructs and the surface marker expression plasmid encoding the murine major histocompatibility complex class I H2-Kk, respectively, and incubated for 48 h. During this time cells were stimulated with camptothecin (1 μm) or staurosporine (1 μm) for 6 h. Cells were harvested and washed once in Krebs Ringer-buffer (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glutamate, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mmMgSO4, and 20 mm Hepes buffer), stained with phosphatidylethanolamine labeled anti-mouse H2-Kkmonoclonal antibody (1:200 dilution, Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) to identify transfected cells and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V (1:200 dilution, Alexis Biochemicals) for 30 min on ice and analyzed by FACS-Scan. Rates of apoptosis in transfected Jurkat cells were determined by evaluation of the percentage of annexin-positive cells within the H2-Kk-positive population by flow cytometry. 2 × 107 Jurkat TAg cells per assay point were transiently co-transfected with 10 μg of epitope-tagged reporter kinase constructs plus 30 μg of the various sIgG cDNA expression plasmids, encoding sIgG-receptor chimera or receptor control as indicated (sIgG-receptor expression plasmid was used in 3-fold molar excess to statistically ensure cotransfection in each cell, which harbors the reporter kinase construct). 48 h posttransfection (with or without stimulation with 50 ng/ml PMA and 1 μg/ml ionomycin for 15 min), cells were harvested, solubilized in lysis buffer (5 mm NaP2P, 5 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 2% Nonidet P-40, and 50 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin) for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. After preclearing, the epitope-tagged protein kinases were immunoprecipitated by incubation overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of the respective anti-tag antibody and protein-G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed six times with lysis buffer. The reporter protein kinase was then resolved by immunoblotting with anti-active and pan mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK and JNK) antibodies (New England Biolabs, Inc.). A representative result of at least five experiments is shown. 2 × 107 Jurkat TAg cells per assay point were co-transfected with 1 μg HA-tagged JNK constructs plus 20 μg of the sIgG-receptor chimera or receptor control as indicated. 40 h posttranfection cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml PMA and 1 μg/ml ionomycin for 60 min and seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated glass cover slips and incubated at 37 °C and for 10 min. Cover slips were washed, and the cells fixed and permeabilized with the Fix and Perm Kit (An der Grub Bioresearch), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rhodamine-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgG-Fc and fluorescein conjugated rat anti-HA antibodies were added to the permeabilization solution, and cells incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. The cover slips were washed four times with PBS and mounted on slides with mowiol mounting solution (Calbiochem). Microscopy was performed with the Olympus BX50 Fluorescence Microscope, and pictures were taken with the digital camera Microview TE/CCD1317-K/1 (Princeton Scientific Instruments) using the metamorph imaging software (Universal Imaging Corporation). Finally the pictures were processed with the AutoDeblur 7.5 software (Autoquant Imaging, Inc.). 2 × 107 Jurkat TAg cells per assay point were transfected with 30 μg of cDNA expression plasmids encoding chimeric sIgG-receptors, sIgG or sIgG-LRP respectively, plus 1 μg of JNK-2-HA for subcellular fractionation of JNK. After incubation for 44–46 h cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml PMA and 1 μg/ml ionomycin for up to 60 min at 37 °C or left unstimulated (Me2SO buffer control). Cell fractionation was performed by subsequent lysis and centrifugation in equivalent amounts of different buffers: “n, nuclear fraction” (pelleted by 10 min and 1000 × g centrifugation) and “s, cytoplasmic (post-1000 × g soluble) fraction” were resolved by lysis buffer without detergent (5 mmNa3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 2 mmEDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris pH 7.3, and 50 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin), “pt, particulate/membrane fraction” was resolved in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, as described (29Bauer B. Krumbock N. Ghaffari-Tabrizi N. Kampfer S. Villunger A. Wilda M. Hameister H. Utermann G. Leitges M. Uberall F. Baier G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 3645-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. (n = 6). Two distinct sIgG-receptor chimeric expression constructs, termed sIgG-LRP and sIgG-APP, were constructed by fusing transmembrane region and extracellular IgG-Fc domain to the cytoplasmic COOH termini of the human LRP and APP cDNA, respectively (see Fig. 1 A for illustration). Ectopic Jurkat TAg cell transfection with these chimeric sIgG constructs (and the truncated sIgG-receptor control protein, expressing no cytoplasmic fusion tail) followed by FACS employing the anti-IgG Fc antibody demonstrated cell surface expression of sIgG chimera in transfected cells (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly (and most likely due to altered kinetics of processing, surface expression and/or endocytotic rates exerted by the internalization signals of the LRP and APP COOH-tail domains), reduced levels of surface expression of these chimeric sIgG-receptorsversus sIgG-receptor control could be reproducibly detected (48 h posttransfection, 20% versus50% sIgG-receptor-expressing cells, respectively). Immunoblot analysis of plasma membrane fractions employing Fc-specific antisera detected protein smears of 54–65 kDa proteins in cells transfected with the corresponding sIgG-expression plasmids but not in cells transfected with empty vector control (Fig. 1 C). The distinct molecular appearance of the different sIgG-receptor proteins indicates posttranslational glycoyslation of the Fcdomain. First, and for comparison purposes with our chimeric sIgG-LRP receptor, we have examined the ability of endogenous LRP signaling pathways to modulate cellular survival. Activated α2-macroglobulin, an established ligand of LRP (1Herz J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 571-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) reduces (by 40%) apoptosis of the ex vivocultured rat cerebellar granule cells (Fig.2 A). Native α2-macroglobulin, which is not a ligand for LRP, served as control. Similarly, decreased susceptibility to DNA damage, were reproducibly observed by sIgG-LRP expression (29% increase in survival, relative to sIgG control; Fig. 2 B). As positive control, transient bcl-2 overexpression also inhibited DNA damage-induced apoptosis in parallel experiments (Fig. 2 C). This provides evidence that α2-macroglobulin-exerted survival effects (through the endogenous LRP-mediated pathway) can be bypassed by ectopic sIgG-LRP expression. We then extended our analysis by testing the signaling role of endogenous LRP on mitogenic signaling function employing transient transfection with promoter reporter constructs. Activated α2-macroglobulin by itself did not affect signals to Elk-1. Interestingly, however, α2-macroglobulin treatment altered the cellular response to NGF, e.g. significantly abrogated mitogen-induced Elk-1 and cJun transcriptional activity (Fig.3 and not shown), indicating that the ERK and/or JNK pathways operate downstream of LRP in the regulation of NGF signaling. This very reproducible result prompted us to examine mitogenic signaling modulation employing our sIgG-LRP chimeric receptor approach. To investigate the potential role of sIgG-LRP and sIgG-APP (in comparison to sIgG-control) in induction of the Elk-1, cJun, and NF-κB-promoter reporters, cells were transiently co-transfected with sIgG-chimeric cDNA constructs and the promoter reporters and subsequently stimulated for up to 16 h with PMA/ionomycin or left unstimulated, lysed, and assayed for reporter gene expression. Consistent to the endogenous LRP function (Fig. 3), sIgG-LRP, and sIgG-APP by itself (with or without bead-bound anti-Fc antibody-mediated clustering) are not sufficient to induce signaling function on these pathways under investigation (Fig.4 A). Additionally, no change in basal phosphotyrosine staining of total cellular proteins could be detected upon expression of sIgG-APP and sIgG-LRP (with or without anti-Fc cross-linking, not shown). However, expression of the established receptor sIgG-Syk, a protein tyrosine kinase isoenzyme of the ZAP-70 family, induced strong changes of total cellular phosphotyrosine protein staining (not shown), strictly dependent on anti-Fc cross-linking (26Zeitlmann L. Knorr T. Knoll M. Romeo C. Sirim P. Kolanus W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15445-15452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore we decided to further investigate the cellular signaling cascade(s) involving sIgG-APP and sIgG-LRP vis-à-vis of mitogenic activation leading to Elk-1, c-Jun, and NF-κB-transactivation employing pleiotropic phorbol ester and ionomycin stimulation. As shown in Fig. 4 B, transient overexpression of sIgG-LRP (relative to the sIgG-receptor control) caused a significant decrease in the transcriptional activation of the Elk-1 (Fig. 4, B and C) and cJun (Fig.4 D) promoter reporter gene, (with or without bead-bound anti-Fc antibody-mediated clustering) indicating interference function(s) of LRP on the given signaling pathways. This phenomenon was also observed with endogenous LRP signaling (see Fig.3). Interestingly, and in contrast to similar binding results of JIP to both, LRP and APP (1Herz J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 571-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), sIgG-APP mutant was much less effective (cJun, Fig. 4 D) and even failed (Elk-1, Fig. 4, Band C) to significantly abrogate mitogen-induced promoter reporter activity even though both transgenes have been properly expressed (not shown a"
https://openalex.org/W2015922146,"Although ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50) is a PDZ domain-containing protein known to bind to various channels, receptors, cytoskeletal elements, and cytoplasmic proteins, there is still very little evidence for a role of EBP50 in the regulation of receptor signal transduction. In this report, we show that EBP50 inhibits the phospholipase C (PLC)-β-mediated inositol phosphate production of a Gαq-coupled receptor as well as PLC-β activation by the constitutively active Gαq-R183C mutant. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that EBP50 interacts with Gαq and to a greater extent with Gαq-R183C. Agonist stimulation of the thromboxane A2 receptor (TP receptor) resulted in an increased interaction between EBP50 and Gαq, suggesting that EBP50 preferentially interacts with activated Gαq. We also demonstrate that EBP50 inhibits Gαq signaling by preventing the interaction between Gαq and the TP receptor and between activated Gαq and PLC-β1. Investigation of the EBP50 regions involved in Gαq binding indicated that its two PDZ domains are responsible for this interaction. This study constitutes the first demonstration of an interaction between a G protein α subunit and another protein through a PDZ domain, with broad implications in the regulation of diverse physiological systems. Although ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50) is a PDZ domain-containing protein known to bind to various channels, receptors, cytoskeletal elements, and cytoplasmic proteins, there is still very little evidence for a role of EBP50 in the regulation of receptor signal transduction.

(also known as NHERF1), a 55-kDa phosphoprotein, was first identified as a cofactor essential for protein kinase A-mediated inhibition of Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) (1Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Google Scholar). EBP50 contains two PDZ domains (PDZ1 and PDZ2) implicated in multiple protein-protein interactions, and an ERM domain, which binds to the actin-associated ERM proteins (ezrin, radixin, moesin, and merlin) (2Murthy A.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Google Scholar). EBP50 was also found to interact with a small number of transmembrane proteins such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (4Moyer B.D. Duhaime M. Shaw C. Denton J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 9206-9213Google Scholar). EBP50 also associates with the phospholipases C (PLC)-β1/β2, and with the TRP4 and TRP5 calcium channels to form a PLC-β1/2-TRP4/5-EBP50 protein complex (9Tang Y. Tang J. Chen Z. Trost C. Flockerzi V., Li, M. Ramesh V. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37559-37564Google Scholar). The physiological role of this interaction on the regulation of PLC-β1/2 remains undefined. The EBP50 protein can also bind through its PDZ domains to various intracellular proteins, including GRK6A (10Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Premont R.T. Rahman N. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J.

A close relative of EBP50 has been identified and is known as E3KARP (13Yun C.H., Oh, S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Google Scholar), SIP-1 (14Poulat F. Barbara P.S. Desclozeaux M. Soullierk S. Moniotk B. Bonneaudk N. Boizetk B. Berta P. J. Biol.

EBP50 and NHERF2 share 52% amino acid identity and a conserved domain architecture (13Yun C.H., Oh, S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that the PDZ domains of EBP50 can homo-oligomerize and also hetero-oligomerize with the PDZ domains of NHERF2 (16Lau A.G. Hall R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8572-8580Google Scholar). Despite the growing evidence suggesting the role of EBP50 as a scaffolding protein involved in the formation of signaling complexes, there is still little evidence for a role of EBP50 in the regulation of transmembrane receptor signaling pathways. Our laboratory has been interested in the regulation of the thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptors (TP receptors). TXA2 has a variety of pharmacological effects that modulate the physiological responses of several cells and tissues (17Kinsella B.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 641-654Google Scholar). Binding of TXA2 to its receptor induces platelet aggregation, constriction of vascular and bronchiolar smooth muscle cells, as well as mitogenesis and hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells (18Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Google Scholar). The TP receptor is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. Two TP receptor isoforms were identified that are generated by the alternative splicing of a single gene, TPα (343 amino acids) and TPβ (407 amino acids), which share the first 328 amino acids (19Hirata M. Hayashi Y. Ushikubi F. Yokota Y. Kageyama R. Nakanishi S. Narumiya S. Nature. 1991; 349: 617-620Google Scholar, 20Raychowdhury M.K. Yukawa M. Collins L.J. McGrail S.H. Kent K.C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19256-19261Google Scholar). Different experiments demonstrated that agonist-induced production of the second messenger inositol phosphates by the TP receptors results from the activation of the Gq/11 family of the Gα subunits (17Kinsella B.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 641-654Google Scholar). Gαq-mediated production of inositol phosphates involves the stimulation of PLC-β isoforms in the following order of potency: PLC-β1 ≥ PLC-β3 > PLC-β2 (21Smrcka A.V. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9667-9674Google Scholar). Furthermore, PLC-β isoenzymes accelerate the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis by Gα subunits acting as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) (22Chidiac P. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19639-19643Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that PLC-βs form dimers in vivo and suggested that dimerization could mediate their interaction with GTP-bound Gαq (23Singer A.U. Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 32-36Google Scholar). Although the signaling pathways of the TP receptors are being described in increasing detail, their regulation remains to be characterized. Knowing that the TP receptor signaling cascade involves the activation of Gαq and the stimulation of the downstream effector PLC-β, we investigated the effect of EBP50 on the signaling of the agonist-stimulated TP receptor through the Gαq pathway. Surprisingly, our experiments revealed that EBP50 regulates the Gαq signaling pathway by preferentially binding through its PDZ domains to the activated Gαq and by preventing its interaction with PLC-β. Furthermore, we show that EBP50 also interferes in the TP receptor-Gαq coupling. This novel interaction between PDZ domains and Gαq has broad implications in intracellular signaling regulation. Growing evidence demonstrates the role of EBP50 in a wide variety of physiological events. The regulation of these events could possibly be modulated by the Gαq-EBP50 interaction. The Myc, Gαq/11, and PLCβ1-specific polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Myc-specific monoclonal antibody was a gift from Dr. J. Stankova (Université de Sherbrooke). Hemagglutinin (HA)-specific monoclonal antibody was from Babco, and EBP50-specific monoclonal antibody was from BD Biosciences. ECL reagents were purchased fromAmersham Biosciences. Protein A-agarose and FuGENE 6TM were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Transient transfections of HEK293 cells grown to 75–90% confluence were performed using FuGENE 6TMaccording to the manufacturer's instructions. Empty pcDNA3 vector was added to keep the total DNA amount added per plate constant. 6-Well plates of HEK293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-EBP50-HA, pcDNA3-Gαq, pcDNA3-Gαq-R183C, pcDNA3-Myc-TPα, pcDNA3-Myc-TPβ, pcDNA3-PDZ1-HA, pcDNA3-PDZ2-HA, pcDNA3-PDZ1-PDZ2-HA, pcDNA3-PDZ2-ERM-HA, and pcDNA3-ERM-HA, in the different combinations indicated under the “Results.” Transfected cells were maintained as described above for 48 h. The cells transfected with TPα or TPβ were incubated for 0–30 min at 37 °C in the presence or the absence of 100 nmU46619 prior to harvesting. The cells were then rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 800 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris, pH 8, 1% Nonidet P-40,0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 5 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (9 nm pepstatin, 9 nm antipain, 10 nmleupeptin, and 10 nm chymostatin) (Sigma). After the cells were incubated in lysis buffer for 60 min at 4 °C, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. One to four μg of specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies were added to the supernatant. After 60 min of incubation at 4 °C, 50 μl of 50% protein A-agarose pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer was added, followed by an overnight incubation at 4 °C. Samples were then centrifuged for 1 min in a microcentrifuge and washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by addition of 50 μl of SDS sample buffer followed by a 30-min incubation at room temperature. Initial lysates and immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using specific antibodies. Inositol phosphates measurements were performed as described previously (24Parent J.L. Labrecque P. Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8941-8948Google Scholar). 2 × 105 HEK293 cells were grown overnight in 12-well plates. The cells were then cotransfected as described above with the indicated constructs. The cells were labeled the following day for 18–24 h with 4 μCi/ml of myo-[3H]inositol in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose, without inositol). The cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in pre-warmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose, without inositol) supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 20 mm LiCl for 10 min. Cells were then stimulated for 5–30 min with 500 nmU46619 in the case of the TP receptor-transfected cells. After stimulation, the medium was removed, and the reactions were terminated by addition of 0.8 ml of 0.4 m chilled perchloric acid. Cells were than collected in Eppendorf tubes, and 0.5 volume of 0.72 n KOH, 0.6 m KOHCO3was added. Tubes were mixed and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. Inositol phosphates were separated on Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 columns. Total labeled inositol phosphates were then measured by liquid scintillation counting. The pcDNA- EBP50-HA construct was a kind gift of Dr. Mark Von Zastrow (University of California, San Francisco). The different HA-tagged domains of EBP50 (PDZ1, PDZ2, ERM, PDZ1-PDZ2, and PDZ2-ERM) were obtained by the use of polymerase chain reaction using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), subcloned in the pcDNA3 vector, and the integrity of the coding sequence was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. cDNA encoding for EBP50 was subcloned in the pRSET A vector (Invitrogen), and the construct was used to produce a His6-tagged recombinant EBP50 in theEscherichia coli K-12 PR745 by following the manufacturer's instruction. The recombinant EBP50 was purified using the QIAexpressionistTM kit (Qiagen Inc, Canada) as indicated by the manufacturer. The purified recombinant EBP50 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and was immunoblotted by using an EBP50-specific monoclonal antibody as described above. The purified recombinant EBP50 was later used in the Gαq interaction and GTPase assays. The His-EBP50-Gαq-R183C binding assay was performed using recombinant EBP50 produced as described above. His-EBP50 (50 μg) was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 100 μl of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, Canada) in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm MgSO4, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol). Thereafter, the resin was washed three times with the binding buffer. The Ni-NTA-bound EBP50 was then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with cellular extracts from HEK293 cells transfected with either pcDNA3-Gαq-R183C or with pcDNA3 in binding buffer. The binding reactions were then washed three times with binding buffer. SDS sample buffer was added to the binding reactions, and the tubes were boiled for 5 min. The binding reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the indicated specific antibodies. Gα GTPase activity was assessed in solution using a single turnover assay essentially as described previously (25Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Google Scholar). After incubation of Gαq-R183C in the presence of [γ-32P]GTP, the GTP-loaded Gαq-R183C was filtered in G-25 Sephadex. Thereafter, Gα([γ-32P]GTP) was incubated in the absence or the presence of RGS4 (100 nm), EBP50 (100 nm), EBP50 (250 nm), or control buffer. Reactions were quenched with 9 volumes of 5% (w/v) Norit A Charcoal in 50 mmNaH2PO4. The charcoal was pelleted, and the32Pi-containing supernatant was counted. To investigate the effect of EBP50 on TP(α/β) signaling, we measured total inositol phosphate production in HEK293 cells cotransfected with either pcDNA3-HA-TPα or pcDNA3-HA-TPβ with an empty pcDNA3 vector (100% control) or pcDNA3- EBP50 following a U46619(a stable TP receptor agonist) stimulation. GRK2 has been shown to inhibit the inositol phosphate response of both TP receptor isoforms (26Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.G. Benovic J.L. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34483-34492Google Scholar) and was thus included in these experiments as a positive control. Fig. 1 A shows that EBP50 expression results in a significant loss in the agonist-induced inositol phosphate production by both TPα and TPβ, reaching only 41 and 45% of their maximal response, respectively. Receptor expression was determined to be 1.2 ± 0.2 pmol of receptor/mg of protein for each construct combination shown in Fig. 1 A. Because the TP receptors activate PLC-β through the Gαq protein, we looked at whether EBP50 could directly inhibit Gαq signaling. Gαq-R183C, a GTPase-deficient Gαq mutant that leads to the constitutive activation of PLC-β (27Conklin B.R. Chabre O. Wong Y.H. Federman A.D. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 31-34Google Scholar), was cotransfected with either an empty pcDNA3 vector (100% control), EBP50, GRK2, GRK5, or GRK6 in HEK293 cells. Although it was shown that GRK2 inhibited Gαq-R183C mediated activation of PLC-β, GRK5, and GRK6 on the other hand, showed no such effect (26Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.G. Benovic J.L. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34483-34492Google Scholar). GRK2, GRK5, and GRK6 were thus used as experimental controls. Surprisingly, EBP50 inhibits significantly the inositol phosphate production induced by Gαq-R183C-mediated activation of PLC-β. Indeed, we observed a loss of more than 60% of the inositol phosphate production when Gαq-R183C was cotransfected with EBP50 as compared with its transfection with an empty vector (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that EBP50 mediates the inhibition of the production of inositol phosphates following TPα and TPβ stimulation by preventing the TP(α/β)-activated Gαq from activating PLC-β. EBP50 is a PDZ-domain containing protein known for its ability to bind to a wide variety of other proteins. We were thus interested in determining if EBP50 could interact with Gαq. Consequently, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed in HEK293 cells cotransfected with pcDNA3-EBP50-HA and either Gαq, Gαq-R183C, or empty pcDNA3. Cell lysates were then incubated with a Gαq-specific polyclonal antibody. Blotting of the immunoprecipitation reactions with an HA-specific monoclonal antibody revealed that EBP50-HA could be coimmunoprecipitated with Gαq and Gαq-R183C. However, the amount of EBP50-HA that coimmunoprecipitated with Gαq-R183C was greater than with Gαq (Fig. 2 A,upper panel). The presence of a faint EBP50-HA band in absence of overexpressed Gαq indicates that endogenous Gαq proteins are sufficient for coimmunoprecipitation of EBP50. Immunoblotting results of the cell lysates with the HA-specific antibody showed that EBP50-HA expression levels were similar in the cells transfected with pcDNA3-EBP50-HA (data not shown). The Gαq-EBP50 interaction was further verified in cell lysates immunoprecipitated with an EBP50-specific antibody, and the resulting material was blotted with the Gαq-specific antibody to visualize the coprecipitated Gαq (Fig.2 B, upper panel). As it can be seen, Gαq-R183C and Gαq could be immunoprecipitated with either endogenous or transfected EBP50. As expected from Fig. 2 A, Gαq-R183C coimmunoprecipitated with EBP50 in a larger amount than the wild type Gαq. The equivalent expression of EBP50 in the cell lysates was confirmed by immunoblotting using an EBP50-specific monoclonal antibody (data not shown). The EBP50-Gαq-R183C interaction was further confirmed by running HEK293 cell extracts expressing Gαq-R183C over His-tagged EBP50-purified protein bound to a Ni2+ column (Fig.3). The upper panel of Fig. 3shows that Gαq-R183C binds to EBP50, whereas it does not bind to the free Ni-NTA resin. Furthermore, no binding was observed when cellular extracts from HEK293 transfected with pcDNA3 were used. Thelower panel of Fig. 3 shows immunoblotting of the binding reactions with anti-EBP50 monoclonal antibody.Figure 3Interaction of Gαq-R183C with purified His-EBP50 protein. Purification of the His-EBP50 protein and the binding assay were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The upper panel shows that Gαq-R183C binds specifically to the His-EBP50 protein, whereas the lower panel illustrates the amount of His-EBP50 protein present in each reaction. IB, immunoblot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The results described in Fig. 2 showed that EBP50 coimmunoprecipitated preferentially with Gαq-R183C (a constitutively active form of Gαq) than it did with Gαq (the assumed “inactive” form). Thus, our data strongly suggest that the interaction of EBP50 with the activated form of Gαq could be implicated in the mechanism leading to the inhibition of the agonist-induced inositol phosphate production by TPβ. To verify this, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using HEK293 cells transfected with pcDNA3-Myc-TPβ and pcDNA3-EBP50-HA. The cells were incubated with the TP receptor agonist U46619 (500 nm) for different incubation times from 0 to 30 min. Cell lysates were then incubated with the Gαq-specific antibody, and the immunoprecipitation reactions were assessed by immunoblotting with the HA-specific monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 4, only a small amount of EBP50 could be coimmunoprecipitated with Gαq in the absence of TPβ agonist stimulation, consistent with results seen in Fig.2 A. However, a greater amount of EBP50 could be coimmunoprecipitated with Gαq after a 5-min TPβ stimulation, suggesting that the agonist treatment resulted in the activation of endogenous Gαq leading to an increased interaction with EBP50 (Fig. 4, upper panel). Basal levels of EBP50 coimmunoprecipitated with Gαq when TPβ was stimulated for longer periods, suggesting an inactivation of GTP-bound Gαq and a loss of Gαq-EBP50 interaction. Our data indicate that activation of Gαq by a GPCR results in a transiently increased Gαq-EBP50 interaction. Similarly, activation of Gαs by the TP and β2-adrenergic receptors showed that this Gα protein subunit could also bind transiently to EBP50 when activated, whereas other Gα proteins tested so far (Gαi/o/t/z, Gα12/13, and Gα16) failed to interact with EBP50 in our system, 2C. La Madeleine and J.-L. Parent, manuscript in preparation. showing a specificity in the EBP50 interaction with Gα subunits. Because EBP50 coimmunoprecipitates with Gαq, we investigated the effect of EBP50 on the TP(α/β)-Gαq interaction. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with different combinations of pcDNA3-Myc-TPβ, pcDNA3-Myc-TPα, pcDNA3-Gαq, pcDNA3-EBP50-HA, and pcDNA3 as described in Fig. 5. The cells were then stimulated or not with 500 nmU46619 for 5 min, and the cell lysates were incubated with a Myc-specific monoclonal antibody. Blotting of the immunoprecipitation reactions with the Gαq-specific polyclonal antibody revealed that, in the absence of EBP50 overexpression, Gαq coimmunoprecipitated with TPα and TPβ demonstrating physical coupling of the receptors to Gαq (Fig. 5, upper panel). After agonist stimulation of TPβ, the amount of coimmunoprecipitated Gαq decreased due to the activation and the subsequent uncoupling of Gαq. This uncoupling was observed in a lesser extent for the TPα receptor. These observations argue for differential TPα/β coupling to Gαq. This difference is not surprising because TPα and TPβ are also subject to differential regulation of other events such as phosphorylation (17Kinsella B.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 641-654Google Scholar) or constitutive and agonist-induced internalization (24Parent J.L. Labrecque P. Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8941-8948Google Scholar, 28Parent J.L. Labrecque P. Rochdi M.D. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7079-7085Google Scholar). However, in the HEK293 cells transfected with either TPβ or TPα with Gαq and EBP50, EBP50 seemed to inhibit the coupling of both receptors to Gαq, because we observed a significant decrease in the amount of Gαq that could be coimmunoprecipitated with both receptors. Once more, the negative effect of EBP50 on TPβ coupling to Gαq was more significant than on the TPα coupling to Gαq. Thus, it appears that EBP50 interferes in the receptor-Gαqinteraction. It is well known that the GTP-bound (active) form of Gαq enhances the phospholipase activity of PLC-β1 by directly binding to its C2 carboxyl-terminal domain (29Wang T. Pentyala S. Elliott J.T. Dowal L. Gupta E. Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7843-7846Google Scholar). In order to investigate whether the EBP50-(GTP-Gαq) interaction results in a sequestration of the activated Gαq, thus preventing it from activating the downstream effectors such as PLC-β1, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments of endogenous PLC-β1 in HEK293 cells cotransfected with pcDNA3-Gαq-R183C or pcDNA3-Gαq and either pcDNA3-EBP50-HA or an empty pcDNA3. The cell lysates were then incubated with a PLC-β1-specific polyclonal antibody. Blotting of the immunoprecipitation reactions with a Gαq-specific antibody revealed that a large amount of Gαq-R183C could be coimmunoprecipitated with PLC-β1 in the absence of transfected EBP50 (Fig. 6 A). As we expected, these data indicate that Gαq-R183C interacts with PLC-β1 resulting in the inositol phosphate production shown in Fig. 1 B. The interaction between Gαq-R183C and PLC-β1 was almost completely inhibited when EBP50-HA was present. This result demonstrates that EBP50 interferes with the Gαq-dependent activation of PLC-β1 by preventing the GTP-bound Gαq-PLC-β1 interaction. It can also be observed that only Gαq-R183C, and not the inactive form of Gαq, could bind to PLC-β1 (Fig.6 A). Fig. 6 D demonstrates that EBP50 also binds to PLC-β1, as was recently shown by Tang et al. (9Tang Y. Tang J. Chen Z. Trost C. Flockerzi V., Li, M. Ramesh V. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37559-37564Google Scholar). We were next interested in studying the EBP50 domains involved in the interaction with activated Gαq. Different deletion constructs of EBP50 were thus generated, as schematically represented in Fig. 7 A. HEK293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-Gαq-R183C and either of the indicated EBP50 mutant constructs. Cell lysates were then incubated with the Gαq-specific antibody, and the immunoprecipitation reactions were analyzed by blotting with an HA-specific monoclonal antibody. The results obtained have shown that the ERM domain does not coimmunoprecipitate with Gαq-R183C (Fig. 7 B). On the other hand, PDZ1 and PDZ2 coimmunoprecipitated with Gαq-R183C, indicating that these domains are implicated in the EBP50-Gαq-R183C interaction. However, the PDZ1-PDZ2 construct seems to coimmunoprecipitate in a greater amount than did each individual PDZ domain (PDZ1 and PDZ2) or the PDZ2-ERM mutant and to a similar level as the full-length EBP50 (Fig. 7 B, upper panel). Thus, it appears that the PDZ1-PDZ2 domains are responsible for the full interaction with activated Gαq. EBP50 is thought to be an important link for several membrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton through its ERM domain, which is involved in the binding to the cytoskeleton-binding ERM proteins. The results described above have shown that the PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains are involved in the EBP50-(Gαq-R183C) interaction, whereas the ERM domain is not. However, we wondered if the ERM domain of EBP50 is important for its inhibition of the Gαq binding to PLCβ1 and the TP receptor. HEK293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-Gαq-R183C and either pcDNA3-PDZ1-HA, pcDNA3-PDZ2-HA, or pcDNA3-ERM-HA. The cell lysates were then incubated with a PLC-β1-specific polyclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitation reactions were analyzed by blotting with the Gαq-specific antibody. Surprisingly, the PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains inhibited the binding of Gαq-R183C to PLC-β1, whereas the ERM domain did not (Fig.8 A). The effect of each EBP50 domain on the interaction between TPβ and Gαq was then investigated. HEK293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-Myc-TPβ, pcDNA3-Gαq, and either pcDNA3-EBP50-HA, pcDNA3-PDZ1-HA, pcDNA3-PDZ2-HA, or pcDNA3-ERM-HA. The cell lysates were then incubated with a Myc-specific monoclonal antibody, and the immunoprecipitation reactions were analyzed by immunoblotting with the Gαq-specific antibody. The results obtained showed that EBP50, PDZ1, and PDZ2 could inhibit the physical coupling of TPβ to Gαq, whereas the ERM showed no effect (Fig.9 A). Taken together, these results have shown that the PDZ1 and the PDZ2 domains are sufficient to regulate the coupling of TPβ to Gαq as well as the binding of the activated Gαq to PLC-β1. Finally, we wanted to assess if EBP50 showed any GAP activity for Gαq. GDP dissociation, and therefore GTP loading, in the absence of activated GPCR is particularly inefficient compared withk cat for GTP hydrolysis for Gαq precluding use of the single turnover assay (30Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14367-14375Google Scholar). However, the k cat for GTP hydrolysis of Gαq-R183C is significantly reduced allowing GTP loading to occur more efficiently (31Ingi T. Krumins A.M. Chidiac P. Brothers G.M. Chung S. Snow B.E. Barnes C.A. Lanahan A.A. Siderovski D.P. Ross E.M. Gilman A.G. Worley P.F. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7178-7188Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was recently shown that the GTPase activity of Gαq-R183C can be promoted by RGS4 in a single turnover assay (31Ingi T. Krumins A.M. Chidiac P. Brothers G.M. Chung S. Snow B.E. Barnes C.A. Lanahan A.A. Siderovski D.P. Ross E.M. Gilman A.G. Worley P.F. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7178-7188Google Scholar). Thus, we utilized this assay to monitor the GTPase activity of Gαq-R183C in the absence or presence of purified RGS4 or EBP50. Although 100 nm RGS4 promoted rapid GTP hydrolysis releasing up to 7–8 fmol of Pi, 100 and 250 nm EBP50 failed to enhance GTP hydrolysis over 15 min of incubation (Fig.10). Thus, it appears that EBP50 has no ability to function as a GAP for Gαq. This study demonstrates a direct regulation of the Gαq signaling pathway by EBP50. We have shown that EBP50 inhibited the inositol phosphate production induced by TPα and TPβ agonist stimulation. We showed that EBP50 decreased PLC-β-dependent production of inositol phosphates induced by Gαq-R183C, a constitutively active mutant of Gαq. We demonstrated that EBP50 interacts in a greater extent with Gαq-R183C than with Gαq. Moreover, stimulation of the TPβ receptor promoted the Gαq-EBP50 interaction, strongly indicating that EBP50 interacts better with the activated Gαq. It was observed that, beyond 5 min of agonist stimulation of TPβ, the amount of EBP50 that coimmunoprecipitated with Gαq decreased to levels similar to what was observed in the absence of agonist. It is known that the activation of Gαq by GPCRs is a rapid process involving the release of GDP by Gαq and its exchange for a GTP. Thereafter, rapid hydrolysis of the GTP by the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gαq results in the inactivation of the Gαq subunit and its return to the inactive GDP-bound state. In addition, rapid desensitization of GPCRs occurs after agonist stimulation resulting in their inability to activate G protein subunits. Taken together, this could explain the loss of EBP50-Gαq interaction after prolonged stimulation of TPβ. These results strongly suggest that the regulation of the TP receptors signaling by EBP50 is caused by the binding of the activated Gαq to EBP50. However, because activation of the Gα subunit results in its dissociation from the βγ subunits, the strong binding of the active form of Gαq to EBP50 could be due to its dissociation from the βγ subunits and not to its GTP-bound active state per se. Arguing against the last statement is the fact that the overexpressed inactive Gαqdid not interact as well as Gαq-R183C with EBP50, unless the endogenous βγ subunits can account for the difference. Furthermore, the activated Gαq-EBP50 interaction after receptor stimulation is transient, suggesting that the Gαq comes off the EBP50 protein upon GTP hydrolysis, which could indicate that EBP50 indeed binds preferentially to the active form of Gαq. More experiments need to be performed to verify if the βγ subunits compete with EBP50 for the binding of Gαq. Our results showed that EBP50 interferes with the coupling of the TP receptors to Gαq which could be explained by the binding of EBP50 to both the active and the inactive forms of Gαqleading to the possible sequestration of Gαq. It can be argued that EBP50 could also bind directly to the receptor, as reported for other GPCRs (5Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Google Scholar), and further interfere in the Gαqcoupling this way. The EBP50-TPβ receptor interaction is currently studied in our laboratory. GTP-bound Gαq preferentially activates PLC-β1 as described in the Introduction. Singer et al. (23Singer A.U. Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 32-36Google Scholar) have shown that the GTP bound-Gαq directly binds and activates PLC-β. Because on the one hand EBP50 inhibited the inositol phosphate production and on the other hand had a greater affinity for the active form of Gαq, the effect of EBP50 on the Gαq-PLC-β1 interaction was investigated. We observed an almost complete inhibition in the interaction of Gαq-R183C with PLC-β1 in the presence of EBP50. Taken together, the results described above indicate that EBP50 regulates the TP receptor signaling through Gαq at different levels. First, we have shown that EBP50 interferes with the coupling of the TP receptors to Gαq by binding and preventing the GDP-bound Gαq (inactive form) from binding to the TP receptor. Second, we have shown that EBP50 also interferes with the coupling of the activated Gαq to the downstream effector PLC-β1. GAPs regulate the heterotrimeric G protein signaling by increasing the rate of GTP hydrolysis by Gα subunits up to 2000-fold. Both RGS proteins (regulators of G protein signaling) and G protein effectors (such as PLC-β and p115RhoGEF, which lack an RGS domain) belong to the family of GAP proteins. RGS proteins specifically bind the GTP-bound Gα subunits and share an RGS domain involved in the regulation of the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα. Because our results have shown that EBP50 binds preferentially the GTP-bound Gαq, and that this interaction is transient after activation of a GPCR, there was the possibility that EBP50 could modulate the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity of Gαq. Analysis of the EBP50 amino acid sequence and its alignment with the RGS proteins failed to show any significant homology, indicating that EBP50 does not contain an RGS domain. Our results showed that EBP50 does not modulate the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gαq. Regulation of Gαq signaling by EBP50 must then rely principally on the mechanisms discussed above. We cannot, however, totally rule out the GAP activity of EBP50. Indeed, it was shown that the GRK2 GAP activity is apparent only in the presence of an activated GPCR (26Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.G. Benovic J.L. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34483-34492Google Scholar), which suggests the possibility that receptors could have a critical role in potentiating GAP activity in cells. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the ability of RGS2 to inhibit Gαq-mediated signals in cells is highly dependent on the nature of the receptors that are being stimulated (32Xu X. Zeng W. Popov S. Berman D.M. Davignon I., Yu, K. Yowe D. Offermanns S. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3549-3556Google Scholar). The authors of this study suggested that regulatory selectivity may be conferred by specific receptor-RGS complexes. Thus, further investigation of the role of receptors in modulating EBP50-Gαq interactions seem warranted. EBP50 binds to NHE3 and is involved in its regulation by cAMP, as well as in its down-regulation (33Weinman E.J. Minkoff C. Shenolikar S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F393-F399Google Scholar). EBP50 may also be required to localize the H+-ATPase in both apical and basolateral membranes in renal intercalated cells (33Weinman E.J. Minkoff C. Shenolikar S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F393-F399Google Scholar). Furthermore, EBP50 serves as a membrane retention signal for CFTR (34Moyer B.D. Denton J. Karlson K.H. Reynolds D. Wang S. Mickle J.E. Milewski M. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B., Li, M. Stanton B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1353-1361Google Scholar) and facilitates the dimerization of CFTR that promotes the full expression of chloride channel activity (35Raghuram V. Mak D.D. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1300-1305Google Scholar). Moreover, recent experiments (6Maudsley S. Zamah A.M. Rahman N. Blitzer J.T. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8352-8363Google Scholar) have shown that EBP50 is involved in the dimerization of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor. Among its numerous functions, EBP50 also regulates the sorting of the β2-adrenergic receptor to either recycling endosomes or lysosomal degradatory pathways (36Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Zastrow M.V. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Google Scholar). Since its isolation, EBP50 has been associated with a broad array of biological systems, all of which depend on the interaction of EBP50 through its PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains with the different target proteins. Our study identifies Gαq as a novel interacting partner for the PDZ domains of EBP50. This finding is important in terms of G protein signaling regulation. The study of possible interactions between other PDZ domain-containing proteins with Gα subunits constitutes a new and exciting field of research. It is also easy to envision the great impact of the Gαq-EBP50 interaction in signaling “cross-talk” because an EBP50 molecule bound to Gαq could possibly be unable to engage in the interaction with another binding partner. Indeed, one can imagine that multiple biological systems associated with EBP50 could be modulated by the activated Gαq-EBP50 interaction."

T4 polynucleotide kinase was procured from Invitrogen. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [3H]thymidine (20 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. HMVEC were bought from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD). Cells were grown in endothelial basal medium 2 (CC-3156) containing EGM-2 MV SingleQuots (CC-4147). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were growth-arrested by incubating in endothelial basal medium 2 for 24 h and used to perform the experiments. HMVEC with and without appropriate treatments were pulse-labeled with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for the indicated times. After labeling, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was suspended in cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and vortexed vigorously to lyse cells. After standing on ice for 20 min, the cell lysis mixture was passed through a glass fiber filter (GF/C, Whatman). The filter was washed once with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and once with cold 70% (v/v) ethanol. The filter was dried, placed in a liquid scintillation vial containing the scintillant fluid, and the radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (LS 5000TA, Beckman Instruments). Nuclear extracts were prepared from treated or untreated HMVEC as described previously (36Rao G.N. Katki K.A. Madamanchi N.R., Wu, Y. Birrer M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6003-6010Google Scholar). The protein content of the nuclear extracts was determined using Micro BCATM protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Protein-DNA complexes were formed by incubating 5 μg of nuclear protein in a total volume of 20 μl consisting of 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 3 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 15% glycerol, and 100,000 cpm of32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe for 30 min on ice. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel using 1× Tris-glycine-EDTA buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 200 mm glycine, 0.1 mm EDTA). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using the T4 polynucleotide kinase kit (Invitrogen) following the supplier's protocol. PI3-kinase activity was measured according to a previously published protocol (37Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Pierce J.H. Blenis J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28783-28789Google Scholar). After appropriate treatments, cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2 μm leupeptin, 10 units/ml aprotinin, and 400 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 20 min on ice. The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein content of the supernatants was determined as described above. Five hundred micrograms of protein from control and each treatment was immunoprecipitated with 5 μl of anti-PI3-kinase antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with 40 μl of 50% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose beads for an additional hour. The immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with lysis buffer, 3 times with wash buffer, and 3 times with TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 μm Na3VO4). The kinase activity was measured by resuspending the immunoprecipitates in 30 μl of TNE buffer and incubating with 10 μl of 2 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol, 10 μl of 100 mm MgCl2, 2 μl of 100 mm ATP, and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 22 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 5 n HCl and 200 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1) mix. The aqueous and organic phases were separated by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 min. The organic phase containing the phosphoinositide phosphates was spotted onto silica gel 60A TLC plate coated with 1% potassium oxalate and separated in a solvent system consisting of chloroform:methanol:water:ammonium hydroxide (90:70:14.6:5.4). The TLC plate was exposed to X-Omat AR x-ray film for 4–6 h at −80 °C and developed. After appropriate treatments, HMVEC were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Cells were lysed by thawing in 250 μl of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and scraped into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. After standing on ice for 20 min the cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were resolved by electrophoresis on 0.1% SDS and 10% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond, Amersham Biosciences). After blocking in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, the membrane was treated with appropriate primary antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected using chemiluminescence reagent kit (Amersham Biosciences). All the experiments were repeated three times with similar results. Data on DNA synthesis are presented as the mean ± S.D. The treatment effects were analyzed by Student'st test. p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. In the case of PI3-kinase activity, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and Western blot analysis, one representative set of data is shown. To understand the role of eicosanoids in angiogenesis, we have studied the effect of various LOX metabolites of arachidonic acid on HMVEC DNA synthesis. Quiescent HMVEC were treated with and without 1 μm of indicated eicosanoids for 24 h, and DNA synthesis was measured by pulse-labeling cells with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for the last 2 h of the 24-h incubation period. Among the LOX metabolites of arachidonic acid tested, only 5(S)-HETE induced DNA synthesis by about 80% over control (Fig. 1). To learn the signaling events of 5(S)-HETE-induced DNA synthesis, the role of the Jak/STAT pathway was studied. Quiescent HMVEC were treated with and without 5(S)-HETE (1 μm) for the indicated times, and cell extracts were prepared. Equal amounts of protein from control and various times of 5(S)-HETE-treated HMVEC were analyzed for tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak-2, STAT-1, and STAT-3 using their phospho-specific antibodies. 5(S)-HETE stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak-2, STAT-1, and STAT-3 in a time-dependent manner (Fig.2). A maximum of a 2–3-fold increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak-2 and STAT-3 was observed at 5 min of 5(S)-HETE treatment, and these levels were sustained for at least 1 h. In the case of STAT-1, only a slight increase in its tyrosine phosphorylation levels was observed at 5 min of 5(S)-HETE treatment compared with control, and these increases were also sustained for at least 1 h. To test the specificity of 5(S)-HETE on the phosphorylation of Jak-2 and STAT-3, quiescent HMVEC were treated with and without 1 μm 5(S)-, 12(S)- or 15(S)-HETE for 30 min, and cell extracts were prepared. Equal amounts of protein from control and each treatment were analyzed by Western blotting for tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak-2 and STAT-3 using their phospho-specific antibodies. The effect of 5(S)-HETE on tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak-2 and STAT-3 was found significantly higher than that of 12(S)- or 15(S)-HETE (Fig. 3). This result suggests that the observed effects of 5(S)-HETE on stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak-2 and STAT-3 are relatively specific. To find whether Jak-2 phosphorylates and activates STAT-3, we tested the effect of AG490, a potent and specific inhibitor of Jak-2 (38Nielsen M. Kaltoft K. Nordahl M. Ropke C. Geisler C. Mustelin T. Dobson P. Svejgaard A. Odum N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6764-6769Google Scholar), on tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-3. AG490 at 25 μm concentration significantly inhibited 5(S)-HETE-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-3 (Fig. 4 A). These results suggest a role for Jak-2 in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-3 by 5(S)-HETE. To investigate whether the increases in STAT-3 tyrosine phosphorylation lead to its activation, quiescent HMVEC were treated with and without 5(S)-HETE (1 μm) in the presence and absence of AG490 (25 μm) for 2 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared. Equal amounts of nuclear protein from control and each treatment were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay for DNA binding activity using32P-labeled STAT-3 consensus oligonucleotide as a probe. Consistent with its phosphorylation state, a 2-fold increase in STAT-3-DNA binding activity was observed at 2 h of 5(S)-HETE treatment (Fig. 4 B). In addition, use of anti-STAT-3 antibodies caused a supershift of the STAT-3-DNA complex. This result suggests the presence of STAT-3 in the protein-DNA complex formed in response to 5(S)-HETE in HMVEC. AG490 significantly inhibited 5(S)-HETE-induced STAT-3-DNA binding activity. To find the role of Jak/STAT pathway in 5(S)-HETE-induced HMVEC growth, the effect of AG490 on 5(S)-HETE-induced DNA synthesis was studied. As shown in Fig. 5, AG490 significantly inhibited 5(S)-HETE-induced DNA synthesis.Figure 25(S)-HETE stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak-2, STAT-1, and STAT-3 in a time-dependent manner in HMVEC. Growth-arrested HMVEC were treated with and without 5(S)-HETE (1 μm) for the indicated times, and cell extracts were prepared. Equal amounts of protein (40 μg) from control and each treatment were analyzed by Western blotting for pJak-2, pSTAT-1, and pSTAT-3 using their phospho-specific antibodies.

In recent years, it was reported that the LOX and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid, particularly, 12(S)-HETE and 14, 15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid, play a role in cell survival (39Chen J.K.

Because cell survival activity is required for cell growth, we wanted to study the effect of 5(S)-HETE on activation of PI3-kinase/Akt signaling. Quiescent HMVEC were treated with and without 5(S)-HETE in the presence and absence of LY294002 (25 μm), a potent and specific inhibitor of PI3-kinase, and cell extracts were prepared. Equal amounts of protein from control and each treatment were assayed for PI3-kinase activity. 5(S)-HETE stimulated PI3-kinase activity 2-fold, and this response was completely inhibited by LY294002 (Fig. 6). We next tested the effect of 5(S)-HETE on the phosphorylation of PI3-kinase downstream targets, Akt (32Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Google Scholar, 33Blume-Jensen P.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Google Scholar). 5(S)-HETE stimulated serine phosphorylation of Akt, p70S6K, ribosomal protein S6, 4E-BP1, and eIF4E (Fig. 7). LY294002 completely inhibited 5(S)-HETE-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt, p70S6K, ribosomal protein S6, 4E-BP1, and eIF4E. To test the role of PI3-kinase/Akt in 5(S)-HETE-induced HMVEC growth, we next studied the effect of LY294002 on 5(S)-HETE-induced DNA synthesis. LY294002 significantly inhibited 5(S)-HETE-induced DNA synthesis in HMVEC (Fig.8). Consistent with this finding, rapamycin (50 ng/ml), a potent inhibitor of mTOR, also significantly blocked 5(S)-HETE-induced DNA synthesis in HMVEC (Fig. 8). To validate the inhibitory effects of LY294002 and rapamycin and, therefore, the role of the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway in 5(S)-HETE-induced growth, we tested the effect of cyclosporin A (1 μm), a potent inhibitor of calcineurin (47Macian F. Rodriguez C.L. Rao A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2476-2489Google Scholar) that supposedly does not affect the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway, on 5(S)-HETE-stimulated DNA synthesis. Cyclosporin A had no effect on 5(S)-HETE-stimulated DNA synthesis in HMVEC (data not shown). Previous studies from other laboratories report that constitutively active STAT-5 stimulates hematopoietic cell survival and growth, and it involves activation of PI3-kinase (48Santos S.C. Lacronique V. Bouchaert I. Monni R. Bernard O. Gisselbrecht S. Gouilleux F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2080-2090Google Scholar). Because 5(S)-HETE induced DNA synthesis in HMVEC and this phenomenon required activation of both Jak-2 and PI3-kinase, we were intrigued to learn whether there is any cross-talk between these two events. To address this, we tested the effect of AG490 on 5(S)-HETE-induced PI3-kinase activity and phosphorylation of its downstream molecules. Interestingly, 5(S)-HETE-induced increases in PI3-kinase activity and Akt, p70S6K, ribosomal protein S6, 4E-BP1, and eIF4E phosphorylation were inhibited about 50% by AG490 (Fig. 9). These results suggest a requirement for Jaks, particularly Jak-2, in the activation of PI3-kinase and its downstream targets by 5(S)-HETE in HMVEC.Figure 75(S)-HETE stimulates phosphorylation of Akt, p70S6K, ribosomal protein S6, 4E-BP1, and eIF4E in a PI3-kinase-dependent manner.

Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Google Scholar, 23Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Google Scholar). To test whether 5(S)-HETE stimulates HMVEC growth via induction of expression of angiogenic factors, we studied its effect on the expression of bFGF-2 and VEGF. Although having a modest effect on VEGF expression (1.7-fold), 5(S)-HETE induced the expression of bFGF-2 by 3-fold compared with control (Fig. 10). In addition, 5(S)-HETE-induced expression of bFGF-2 but not VEGF was attenuated by AG490 and LY294002, the inhibitors of Jak-2 and PI3-kinase, respectively (Fig. 10). To test the role of bFGF-2 in 5(S)-HETE-induced HMVEC DNA synthesis, quiescent cells were treated with and without 5(S)-HETE (1 μm) in the presence and absence of neutralizing anti-bFGF-2 (3 μg/ml) or anti-VEGF (3 μg/ml) antibodies for 24 h, and DNA synthesis was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation. 5(S)-HETE-induced DNA synthesis was completely inhibited by neutralizing anti-bFGF-2 but not anti-VEGF antibodies (Fig.11).Figure 11Neutralizing anti-bFGF-2 but not anti-VEGF antibodies inhibit 5(S)-HETE-induced DNA synthesis in HMVEC.

These results suggest that 5(S)-HETE stimulates HMVEC growth via Jak-2- and PI3-kinase-dependent induction of expression of bFGF-2.

In addition to their role in the mitogenic signaling events cited above, some eicosanoids such as prostaglandin F2αand 12(R)-hydroxy-5,8,14-eicosatrienoic acid induce the expression of angiogenic factors bFGF-2 and VEGF in rat aortic smooth muscle cells and rabbit limbal microvessel endothelial cells, respectively (50Mezentsev A.

In the present study we show for the first time that 5(S)-HETE induces the expression of bFGF-2 and, thereby, stimulates an autocrine growth in HMVEC, and this phenomenon is dependent on activation of Jak-2 and PI3-kinase. Considering these novel observations, it is likely that 5(S)-HETE plays an important role in angiogenesis. A large body of pharmacological data indicates that the LOX metabolites of arachidonic acid are involved in tumorigenesis (14Glasgow W.C. Afshari C.A. Barrett J.C. Eling T.E. J. Biol.

In this aspect, the present study identifies 5(S)-HETE as one of the LOX products of arachidonic acid that is a potent mitogen for microvessel endothelial cells. Future studies are required to understand whether 5(S)-HETE also regulates the levels and/or activities of other molecules such as matrix metalloproteinases that are involved in angiogenesis."

Helicase proteins mediate the disruption of hydrogen bonds of duplex DNA, the inter-/intramolecular duplex RNA molecules, or the dissociation of proteins from nucleic acid (2Tanner N.K. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Coupled with their helicase activity, all helicase proteins possess intrinsic NTP hydrolytic (NTPase) activity that can be stimulated by nucleic acids (2Tanner N.K. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). For examples, Rhlb, a DEAD1 box protein inEscherichia coli, is involved directly in mRNA degradation, functioning as an RNA helicase in a multiprotein degradosome complex (3Py B. Higgins C.F. Krisch H.M. Carpousis A.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The eIF4A·eIF4B complex, in conjunction with eIF4F, is believed to melt the 5′-proximal secondary structure of mRNA, generating ssRNA regions that facilitate ribosome binding, an important reaction governing the efficiency of RNA translation (4Rosen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick L.W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Recent studies on their mechanism of action indicate that most helicases, whether monomeric or multimeric, possess two functional domains, one for interaction with single-stranded nucleic acid (ssNA) and the other for interaction with double-stranded nucleic acid (dsNA) (5Korolev S.

The spatial and functional arrangements of these NA binding domains determine the directional movement of the helicase relative to the bound ssNA in either the 5′ to 3′ or 3′ to 5′ direction. If multiple ssNA or dsNA binding domains are present in a single protein, or if the helicase functions as an oligomer, bidirectionality can be observed in the unwinding reaction, as seen with p68 (9Huang Y. Liu Z.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12810-12815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and eIF4A complexed with eIF4B (4Rosen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E.

Most helicases exhibit a preferential substrate specificity for either DNA or RNA molecules (2Tanner N.K. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Until now, RNA helicase A (10Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4338-4407PubMed Google Scholar), also known as NDH II (11Zhang S. Grosse F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3906-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) or maleless (MLE) (12Lee C.G. Chang K.A. Kuroda M.I. Hurwitz J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), is the only cellular helicase found to catalyze the unwinding of both RNA and DNA molecules. Unlike some DNA helicases that function in a processive manner (13Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 14Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), it is believed that RNA helicases are inherently catalytic, unwinding only short stretches of duplex (15Jankowsky E. Gross C.H. Shuman S. Pyle A.H. Nature. 2000; 403: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In addition to directional movement on NA, the substrate specificity and processivity are likely to be dictated by the molecular nature of the NA binding domains of individual helicases. In this report, I describe the identification of an RNA helicase named RH70. Mass spectrometric analysis reveals that RH70 is DDX17, a DEAD protein with a demonstrated RNA-dependent ATPase activity (16Lamm G.M. Nicole S.M. Fuller-Face F.V. Lammond A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3739-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). RH70 functions as an RNA helicase, unwinding duplex RNA in both the 5′ to 3′ and the 3′ to 5′ directions. When the duplex region is increased to 29 bp, RNA substrate cannot be unwound by RH70. Interestingly, the presence of a 3-nucleotide mismatch in the middle of a 31-bp duplex leads to an efficient unwinding by RH70. Our observations suggest that RH70 is a bidirectional and catalytic helicase. The possible involvement of RH70 in pre-mRNA splicing is also discussed. All nucleotides were purchased fromAmersham Biosciences. Radioactive nucleotides such as [α-32P]ATP and [α-32P]GTP were obtained from ICN. TLC plates (PEI-cellulose F) used in the ATPase assay were from EM Industry. RNase inhibitor was obtained from Promega. SP6 and T7 polymerases were from Stratagene or New England Biolabs (NEB). All restriction nucleases used to make DNA template for in vitrotranscription were purchased from NEB. RNA substrates in Figs.

The specific radioactivity of RNA substrate was adjusted to 100,000 cpm/50 fmol of RNA. In vitro reactions for the helicase and ATPase activities were carried out for 30 min at 37 °C following the procedures described previously (10Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. J. Biol.

Nuclear extracts (2.6 g) were prepared from 60 liters of HeLa suspension culture according to the procedure described by Dignam et al. (17Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). As summarized in Fig.1 A, nuclear extracts were fractionated through six successive chromatography steps using buffer A (20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) and an indicated concentration of KCl. At each step, bound proteins were eluted by linearly increasing the concentration of KCl in buffer A. Fractions containing U1snRNP, determined by the presence of U1snRNA as well as U1snRNP-specific 70-kDa protein, were pooled. The salt concentration of pooled fractions is described in Fig. 1 A. Eluant composition was examined with the indicated amount of pooled fractions by 12% SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 B). S-Sepharose chromatography yielded about 43 mg of protein, which was dialyzed overnight to 0.1 m KCl and loaded onto a single-stranded DNA cellulose column (12 ml). No protein was detected in the flow-through, and bound proteins were eluted in 50 ml of buffer A containing an increasing concentration of KCl (50–500 mm). Of 72 fractions collected, fractions 19–34 were enriched in U1snRNP. They were pooled (8 mg) and dialyzed overnight to 50 mm KCl and 15 mm MgCl2 in buffer A. Subsequently, they were loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (2 ml). Bound proteins were eluted using buffer A (30 ml) containing 15 mm MgCl2 and an increasing concentration of KCl (50–700 mm). Pooled 0.1 m KCl fractions (2.64 mg) contained RH70, whereas U1snRNP was highly enriched in 0.25m KCl fractions (3.0 mg). An aliquot (100 μg) of pooled Q-Sepharose fractions containing RH70 was loaded on top of a linear glycerol gradient (5 ml, 20–40%) in buffer A containing 0.2m KCl and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. After centrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 24 h at 4 °C in a Sorvall AH650 rotor, 30 fractions were collected from the tube bottom. Aliquots (0.5 μl) were used in both RNA helicase and poly(U)-dependent ATPase assays; 16-μl aliquots were analyzed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by Coomassie staining. Protein concentration was determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). RH70 (2.4 μg) or U1snRNP (16 μg), mixed with 10 μl of Y12 mAb (provided by J. Steitz), was incubated for 1 h on ice in the absence or presence of 15 mm MgCl2 or 3 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm ATP. IP pellets, isolated using protein A-agarose (Sigma), were resuspended in 30 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer. After boiling for 5 min, aliquots (15 μl) of IP pellets were analyzed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by Coomassie staining. Several RNA-dependent ATPases and RNA helicases were detected in various column fractions during the purification of U1snRNP, but only one was co-purified with U1snRNP enriched in ssDNA cellulose fractions. Pooled ssDNA fractions contained two distinct proteins of about 70 and 22 kDa in addition to all known components of U1snRNP such as 70 kDa, A, B, B, C, D, E, F, and G (Fig.1 B, lane 6). Subsequent Q-Sepharose chromatography resulted in partial separation of 70-kDa protein and complete removal of 22-kDa protein from U1snRNP (Fig. 1 B, lanes 6–8). For the purpose of their identification, 70- and 22-kDa proteins were subjected to tryptic digestion followed by Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. These studies revealed that the 22-kDa protein is cyclophilin B (CyB), whereas the 70 kDa protein, named RH70, is DDX17, which exhibits extensive sequence similarity to p68, a prototypical DEAD helicase (data not shown) (16Lamm G.M. Nicole S.M. Fuller-Face F.V. Lammond A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3739-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because U4/6 snRNP interacts with cyclophilins (18Horowitz D.S. Kobayashi R. Krainer A.R. RNA. 1997; 3: 1374-1387PubMed Google Scholar, 19Teigelkamp S. Achsel T. Mundt C. Gothel S.F. Cronshagen U. Lane W.S. Marahiel M. Luhrmann R. RNA. 1998; 4: 127-141PubMed Google Scholar), I explored the possibility that co-purification of CyB and U1snRNP might be due to their physical interaction in a Mg2+-sensitive manner. However, immunoprecipitation of HeLa nuclear extract with IgGs specific for either U1 70 kDa or CyB did not yield any evidence indicating an interaction between CyB and U1snRNP (data not shown). As U1snRNP is purified from heparin-Sepharose through ssDNA cellulose, RH70 seems also to be enriched relative to other proteins (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4–6). In contrast to CyB, which is absent from the final U1snRNP preparation, the continued co-purification of RH70 with U1snRNP may suggest their stable interaction (lane 8). To test this possibility, RH70 and U1snRNP were analyzed by immunoprecipitation using Y12 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) specific for the B/B′ and D polypeptides of U1snRNP. As shown in Fig. 1 C, neither RH70 nor CyB reacted with Y12 mAb (lanes 7–9). In contrast, RH70 present in U1snRNP was immunoprecipitated by Y12 mAb (lanes 4–6). There was no noticeable influence of MgCl2 or ATP on the reactivity of RH70 and U1snRNP with Y12 mAb. Thus, it is very likely that a certain fraction of RH70 forms a stable complex with U1snRNP. It is important to note that p68 RNA helicase, which is highly homologous to RH70, also interacts with U1snRNP:5′-splice site complex during pre-mRNA maturation (20Liu Z.R. Sargueil B. Smith C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6910-6920Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). Pooled RH70 fractions (Fig. 1 B, lane 7) were subjected to sedimentation analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The helicase activity on the glycerol gradient migrated faster than cytochrome C (CYC) but slower than bovine serum albumin (BSA, 68 kDa, 4.3 S) (Fig.2). The calculated sedimentation coefficient of RH70 was 4.0 S (Fig. 2 C), and the protein co-migrating with the helicase activity was 70 kDa in size (Fig.2 A), suggesting that RH70 might exist as a monomer in solution. In addition to the helicase activity, RNA-dependent ATPase activity also co-sedimented with 70-kDa protein, indicating that both activities are likely to be associated with RH70 (Fig. 2 C). ATPase activity was highly stimulated by poly(U). For example, an 0.5-μl aliquot of fraction 17 with the highest helicase activity yielded 240 pmol of inorganic phosphate (Pi) in the presence of RNA but 2 pmol of Pi in the absence of RNA after a 30 min-incubation at 37 °C. Helicase reactions were carried out using 40 ng of RH70 (pooled glycerol gradient fractions) under the standard condition described under “Experimental Procedures.” Helicase activity was absolutely dependent on MgCl2 and ATP. The addition of either EDTA (5 mm) or nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs such as App(CH2)p and App(NH)p instead of ATP resulted in more than 90% inhibition of the maximal activity (data not shown). To determine their K m, varying concentrations (0, 0.2, and 1 mm) of each nucleotide was added to helicase reactions. As shown in Fig. 3, the helicase activity was stimulated by higher ATP concentration (lanes 4–5) but was not supported by other nucleotides (lanes 6–11). No helicase activity of RH70 was observed with dsDNA substrate (data not shown). These results indicate that RH70 functions as an RNA helicase, preferentially utilizing ATP. The directionality of helicase activity is defined by the strand on which an enzyme binds and translocates. To determine the directionality of RH70, two different dsRNA substrates containing single-stranded regions exclusively at the 3′- or 5′-end were compared in the helicase reaction containing 40 ng of RH70 (Fig. 3). RH70 efficiently unwound both 5′- and 3′-tailed dsRNA (compare left and right panels in Fig. 3). In Fig. 2, although helicase activity was measured with 5′-tailed dsRNA substrate, essentially the same result was obtained with 3′-tailed dsRNA substrate. These results indicate that RH70 catalyzes the unwinding of dsRNA bidirectionally. The processivity of helicase reflects the probability that the helicase will perform the next unwinding step with a unique step size (15Jankowsky E. Gross C.H. Shuman S. Pyle A.H. Nature. 2000; 403: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Thus, the processivity of RH70 was determined using a new 5′-tailed dsRNA containing a duplex region comparable with that of the 3′-tailed dsRNA substrate. As shown in Fig.4 A, with an increase in duplex length from 15 to 26 bp, the efficiency of the unwinding reaction drastically decreased. These results suggest that the unwinding of 5′-tailed dsRNA by RH70 is highly catalytic. It is also possible that the length of ssRNA regions, which is much longer in 3′-tailed dsRNA (78 and 82 nucleotides) than in 5′-tailed dsRNA (26 and 20 nucleotides), might also influence the unwinding reaction catalyzed by RH70. The directionality of RH70 was further explored using two additional dsRNAs, including one containing shorter ssRNA regions but a 3-nucleotide mismatch in the middle of a duplex region (Fig.4 B). RNA helicase A (RHA) efficiently catalyzed the unwinding of both dsRNAs (compare lanes 4–5 and12–13). Unlike RH70, RHA did not unwind 5′-tailed substrate at all (compare lanes 20–21 and 23–24). These results indicate that the presence of a mismatch does not significantly influence RHA and that the availability of ssNA regions at the 3′-end is important for RHA to be effective as a helicase. Despite the presence of comparable ssNA regions at both 3′- and 5′-ends, the unwinding by RH70 was insignificant with dsRNA containing a longer duplex (29 bp) (lanes 7–8). Interestingly, the presence of a mismatch in the duplex region allowed effective unwinding of an RNA substrate that was otherwise poorly utilized by RH70 (comparelanes 7–8 and 15–16). These results indicate that, unlike RHA, RH70 unwinds dsRNA in a highly catalytic and bidirectional mode. Here I report that RH70 co-purified with U1snRNP is DDX17, a DEAD family member (16Lamm G.M. Nicole S.M. Fuller-Face F.V. Lammond A.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3739-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Employing sedimentation analysis, I also demonstrate that RH70 possesses both RNA-dependent ATPase and RNA helicase activities. As reported previously for its ATPase activity, ATP is the only nucleotide that supports the helicase activity of RH70. Our study also shows that RH70 catalyzes the unwinding of dsRNA in both the 5′ to 3′ and 3′ to 5′ directions, consistent with its sequence identity (about 70%) to p68, which mediates the unwinding of dsRNA in a bidirectional manner (9Huang Y. Liu Z.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12810-12815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This study establishes that the presence of a mismatch in a duplex region can be important for an efficient unwinding of dsNAs by catalytic helicases. It can be predicted that if the helicase dissociates after partial disruption of a duplex region, no ssNA product will be observed because of the re-annealing of partially unwound duplex region. This so-called “abortive unwinding” is depicted in Fig. 5 A. The prevention of partially melted regions from re-annealing would be important for the productive generation of ssNA regions. As seen in the unwinding of the SV40 viral replication origin, mediated by T antigen with the assistance of single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) (21Goetz G.S. Dean F.B. Hurwitz J. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 383-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Dean F.B. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5062-5071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the above can be achieved by a particular ssNA-binding factor. Even in the absence of ssNA-binding factor, however, the use of a mismatch can turn abortive unwinding of dsNA to productive unwinding, as shown in Fig. 5 B. Helicase protein translocates along dsNA with a defined unwinding step size. A recent study demonstrated that a DExH (Asp-Glu-x-His) protein, NPH-II, unwinds dsRNA with a step size of roughly 6 bp (15Jankowsky E. Gross C.H. Shuman S. Pyle A.H. Nature. 2000; 403: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), which is similar to that of UvrD DNA helicase, 4–5 bp (23Ali J.A. Lohman T.M. Science. 1997; 275: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). If a certain helicase dissociates from dsNA after a single round of translocation with a step size of about 4–6 bp, a productive unwinding reaction would hardly be detected in vitro. To date, not all DEAD/DEAH family members have been shown to possess helicase activity in vitro (2Tanner N.K. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 24Fuller-Face F.V. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 271-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), perhaps because of the requirement for a specific substrate or assisting factors. My observation suggests an additional possibility; helicases, previously reported to be nonfunctional, may be highly catalyticin vitro in such a way that partially unwound duplex regions are re-annealed before the second engagement of the helicase. As demonstrated for RH70 in this study, the use of dsNA, consisting of a series of mismatches between multiple duplex regions of varying base pairs, will enable us to test the above possibility and also experimentally determine the maximum step size of catalytic helicases. Pre-mRNA splicing involves five snRNPs and numerous non-snRNP proteins (25Kramer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 26Schwer B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A number of conformational changes occur during pre-mRNA splicing, including the formation and disruption of RNA base pairs and protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions. At least eight splicing factors belonging to the DEAH ATPase/helicase family have been identified in yeast (26Schwer B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The ATP requirement for pre-mRNA splicing can be attributed in part to energy-consuming steps mediated by these DEAH proteins. For example, two DEAH proteins, PRP22 and PRP43, mediate the dissociation of the spliceosome complex releasing mRNA as well as splicing factors, which is essential for the recycling of splicing factors for new rounds of pre-mRNA splicing (27Campodonico E. Schwer B. Genetics. 2002; 160: 407-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Arenas J. Abelson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 17743-17750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It is intriguing to note that PRP2 and PRP16, the two relatively well characterized DEAH proteins, show a broad range of nucleotide specificity (30Kim S.H. Smith J. Claude A. Lin R.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2319-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 31Schwer B. Guthrie C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 5033-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), whereas pre-mRNA splicing is strictly dependent on ATP (25Kramer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). In addition to various processes mediated by known DEAH proteins, yet unknown energy-requiring reactions may take place in the earlier stages of pre-mRNA splicing, mediated by proteins highly specific for ATP. In fact, a protein kinase activity was observed with immunoaffinity-purified U1snRNP (32Woppmann A. Will C.L. Kornstadt U. Zuo P. Manley J.L. Luhrmann R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 21: 2815-2822Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and a similar kinase activity (SRPK1) was purified from HeLa cells (33Gui J.F. Tronchere H. Chandler S.D. Fu X.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10824-10828Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, SRPK1 seems to function as a negative regulator of pre-mRNA splicing (34Gui J.F. Lane W.S. Fu X.D. Nature. 1994; 369: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). My observation makes it plausible to consider the following scenario as an alternative explanation for the ATP specificity of pre-mRNA splicing. As soon as pre-mRNAs are synthesized by RNA polymerase II, RH70 may assist U1snRNP to recognize and interact with the 5′-splice site through its helicase activity functioning in the 5′ to 3′ direction. In this regard, it is informative to note that p68 RNA helicase, which is highly homologous to RH70, interacts with the U1:5′-splice site duplex (20Liu Z.R. Sargueil B. Smith C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6910-6920Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A detailed functional study on RH70 and p68 in the context of pre-mRNA splicing could elucidate the nucleotide specificity of pre-mRNA splicing and perhaps clarify the molecular basis of U1snRNP interaction with the 5′-splice site.

Previously, we suggested that the NH2 termini of the mouse HCN2 isoform were important for subunit co-assembly and functional channel expression. Using an alignment strategy together with yeast two-hybrid assays, patch clamp electrophysiology, and confocal imaging, we have now identified a domain within the NH2 terminus of the HCN2 subunit that is responsible for interactions between NH2termini and promoting the trafficking of functional channels to the plasma membrane. This domain is composed of 52 amino acids, is located adjacent to the putative first transmembrane segment, and is highly conserved among the mammalian HCN isoforms. This conserved domain, but not the remaining unconserved NH2-terminal regions of HCN2, specifically interacted with itself in yeast two-hybrid assays. Moreover, the conserved domain was important for expression of currents. Whereas relatively normal whole cell HCN2 currents were produced by channels containing only the conserved domain, further deletion of this region, leaving only a more polar and putative coiled-coil segment, eliminated HCN2 currents and resulted in proteins that localized predominantly in perinuclear compartments. Thus, we suggest that this conserved domain is the critical NH2-terminal determinant of subunit co-assembly and trafficking of pacemaker channels.

Their primary amino acid sequence predicts a structure similar to those of voltage-gated potassium channels and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. Thus, HCN subunits are thought to have six transmembrane helices with cytoplasmic amino and carboxyl termini, and to co-assemble as tetramers when forming functional channels. Four mammalian HCN isoforms (HCN1–4) are known (3Santoro B. Liu D.T. Yao H. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R.

Co-assembly of different mammalian HCN isoforms has been suggested using electrophysiological analyses (6Chen S. Wang J. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Gen.

Nature. 2001; 413: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the formation of heteromeric channels contributes to the diversity of pacemaker current phenotypes described in vivo. Recently, we suggested that NH2-terminal interactions are required for subunit co-assembly and targeting of functional channels to the plasma membrane (13Proenza C. Tran N. Angoli D. Zahynacz K. Balcar P. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29634-29642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, we have not yet determined the region(s) responsible. To identify the critical region, we subdivided the NH2 terminus based on homology among the different mammalian isoforms of HCN channels. An alignment of NH2-terminal amino acid sequences from these isoforms revealed a 52-amino acid domain, which has a high sequence identity (>90%), and is located immediately adjacent to the first putative transmembrane domain (S1). Using yeast two-hybrid assays, confocal imaging, and patch clamp electrophysiology, we have found that the conserved domain interacted with itself and was required for plasma membrane localization of channel protein and expression of HCN2 currents. Our data suggests that the conserved domain of the NH2 terminus is important for subunit co-assembly and trafficking of pacemaker channels. The coding sequences for the unconserved domain (residues 1–130) and conserved domain (residues 131–182) of the mHCN2 NH2 terminus were each inserted in-frame into both the GAL4 activation- and binding-domain plasmids, pGAD424 and pGBT9 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The two regions were amplified using PCR, with EcoRI andBamHI restriction sites added to the ends of the primers. The PCR fragments were then ligated into pGAD424 and pGBT9 at theirEcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. The resulting constructs were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics, University of British Columbia, Canada). The constructs were assayed for interaction by expression in the yeast strain AH109. Pooled yeast colonies expressing the fusion proteins were collected from plates containing synthetic medium lacking tryptophan and leucine (SD/−Trp/−Leu) and were then spread onto test plates containing medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine (SD/−Trp/−Leu/−His). The test plates were examined for the appearance of colonies after incubation for 3–7 days at 30 °C. Positive interactions were compared with a control interaction consisting of the interaction domains from the α and β subunits of the skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ channel (14Proenza C. Wilkens C. Lorenzon N.M. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23169-23174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and were defined as appearance of colonies in >70% of the test transformations. Each interaction was tested in at least six independent transformations. The deletion mutants, “HCN2-Δ2–130” and “HCN2-Δ2–154,” were constructed by replacing an EcoRI-AccI restriction fragment of the wild type channel with a PCR product lacking the coding sequence for residues 2–130 and 2–154, respectively. For the c-Myc tagged channel, “HCN2-c-Myc,” the sequence encoding residues 1–863 of the wt mHCN2 channel was first amplified using PCR, withBamHI and EcoRI restriction sites added to the ends of the primers. The PCR product was then inserted into a mammalian c-Myc expression vector, pcDNA3.1/myc-His (Invitrogen), using the common restriction sites BamHI andEcoRI, such that the c-Myc protein is expressed on the COOH-terminal end of the resulting fusion protein. The same method was also used to construct “HCN2-Δ2–154-c-Myc,” except that the coding sequence for residues 155–863 was amplified in the PCR amplification step instead, and an ATG start codon was added after theBamHI restriction site. All constructs were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics, University of British Columbia). Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Hams' F-12 medium supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal bovine serum, and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were plated onto glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes. One day after plating, mammalian expression vectors encoding wild type (wt) or mutant mHCN channels (2 μg/dish) were transiently co-transfected into the cells along with the green fluorescent protein reporter plasmid (0.3 μg/dish) using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Cells expressing the transfected DNA were identified by the appearance of green fluorescence 24–48 h after transfection. One to 2 days following transfection, a shard of coverslip plated with cells was transferred to a recording chamber (∼200 μl volume) and continually perfused (0.5–1.0 ml/min) with a low K+ extracellular solution (5.4 mmKCl, 135 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with NaOH). Following rupture of the patch membrane, the solution was changed to a high K+ recording solution (135 mmKCl, 5.4 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with KOH) to maximize current amplitude. The patch pipettes were filled with a solution containing 130 mm K-aspartate, 10 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 1 mm EGTA and adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH. Whole cell currents were measured using borosilicate glass electrodes, which had a resistance of 2.0–4.0 mΩ when filled with the intracellular solution. Currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and Clampex software (Axon Instruments). Data were filtered at 2 kHz and were analyzed using Clampfit (Axon Instruments) and Origin (Microcal) software. All experiments were conducted at room temperature (20–22 °C). Currents were not leak-subtracted. Instantaneous currents were taken as the peak current measured immediately after the capacitive transient. The voltage dependence of activation was determined from tail currents at −65 mV following 2-s test pulses ranging from 60 to −150 mV, in 30-mV steps. Normalized tail current amplitudes were plotted as a function of test potential and values were fit with a Boltzmann function, f(V)=Imax/(1+e(V1/2−V)/k)(Eq. 1) to determine the midpoint of activation (V 1/2) and slope factor (k). Single test pulses were often followed by a 200–500-ms pulse to +5 mV to ensure complete channel deactivation, and the resting current was always allowed to return to its baseline value before subsequent voltage pulses. Statistical comparisons were performed using an ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc analysis; significance was assumed if thep value was <0.05. Data are reported as mean ± S.E., and n values represent the number of cells measured, which were from a minimum of three separate transfections for each value reported. One day after transfection, cells on coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min. The cells were washed with PBS (2× for 10 min), permeabilized using 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with 10% normal goat serum for 10 min. After one wash with PBS containing 1% normal goat serum, cells were incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) specific to the c-Myc epitope present on the COOH termini of the wild type and HCN2-Δ2–154 mHCN2 constructs at a dilution of 1:3200 in PBS with 1% normal goat serum for 2 h at room temperature. The antibody was removed, cells were again washed with PBS (3× for 5 min), and then incubated with a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody tagged with Cy3 (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA) at a dilution of 1:600 in PBS with 1% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. After washing in PBS (3× for 5 min), coverslips were mounted on slides using Permount (Fisher). Cells were examined using confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal), and images were taken using a ×63 oil immersion objective lens at an excitation wavelength of 535 nm. An alignment of amino acid sequences of the amino termini of four mammalian HCN isoforms (mHCN1, mHCN2, mHCN3, and hHCN4) revealed a region of high sequence identity (>90%) (Fig.1). This region is 52 amino acid residues long (Ser131-Asp182) and is located immediately adjacent to the first putative transmembrane domain (S1). We hypothesized that this conserved region could mediate the interactions between complete NH2 termini observed previously in our lab (13Proenza C. Tran N. Angoli D. Zahynacz K. Balcar P. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29634-29642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Using yeast two-hybrid assays, we tested the conserved and unconserved domains of HCN2 for self-interactions. The conserved (Ser131-Asp182) and unconserved (Met1-Gly130) domains were expressed in the yeast strain AH 109 as fusion proteins with the binding domain and activation domain of the GAL4 transcription factor. The presence of yeast colonies on SD/−Trp/−Leu/−His nutritional selection medium was used as the indicator of interactions between test proteins. Yeast expressing the conserved domain exhibited robust growth, similar to that of yeast expressing the positive control interaction domains of the skeletal muscle L-type-calcium channel. In contrast, no growth was observed for yeast expressing either the unconserved domain of the NH2 terminus or the negative control, which consisted of the GAL4 activation and binding domains alone (Fig.2). The conserved and unconserved domain constructs were also expressed with the empty vectors (pGAD and pGBT9) to ensure that the positive results were not because of cross-reactivity with the GAL4 portions of the fusion proteins. The results of those control tests were negative (n = 6 transformations each, data no shown). Previously, we found that the complete removal of the NH2 terminus of mHCN2 (see construct in Fig. 3 D) abolished expression of HCN2 currents and resulted in the localization of channel protein mainly in intracellular compartments (13Proenza C. Tran N. Angoli D. Zahynacz K. Balcar P. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29634-29642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because the conserved domain was found to interact with itself in the yeast two-hybrid assays, we reasoned that this portion of the NH2terminus would promote channel assembly and trafficking, and therefore restore the expression of HCN2 currents. To test this possibility, we constructed a deletion mutant containing only the conserved domain (HCN2-Δ2–130, Fig. 3 B). When expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, this construct produced both the slowly activating current (I h) and the instantaneous current (I inst) that are characteristic of mHCN2 channels (15Proenza C. Angoli D. Agranovich E. Macri V. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5101-5109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), although both currents were significantly smaller than those recorded from cells expressing wt mHCN2 (Fig.4, A–C). Thus, the conserved domain of the NH2 terminus of HCN2 was sufficient to rescue functional expression, probably by promoting channel assembly and trafficking to the plasma membrane as has been suggested for the conserved NH2-terminal domains of Shakerchannels (16Zerangue N. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 3591-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).Figure 4The conserved region is sufficient for functional expression, but the putative coiled-coil region is not. A, current traces recorded from cells expressing green fluorescent protein, HCN2-Δ2–154, HCN2-Δ2–130, or HCN2 in response to voltage steps of −150 mV from a holding potential of −35 mV. Average current densities of I h (B) and I inst (C) were recorded from cells expressing green fluorescent protein (n = 9), HCN2 (n = 9), HCN2-Δ2–130 (n = 10), or HCN2-Δ2–154 (n = 11). Single asterisksindicate a significant difference of HCN2 values from the other groups, whereas the double asterisk indicates a significant difference of HCN2-Δ2–130 from all other groups, using an ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc analysis. Confocal images of cells transfected with HCN2-c-Myc (D) or HCN2-Δ2–154-c-Myc (E) are shown. The small arrows point to regions of the plasma membrane conspicuous for the presence or absence of fluorescence. The large arrow (in D) points to a nontransfected cell for comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) There are several possible explanations for the reduction inI h density produced by cells expressing HCN2-Δ2–130. The decrease could reflect a negative shift in the voltage dependence of I h activation. However, theV 1/2 and k values ofI h activation curves determined from cells expressing HCN2-Δ2–130 were −106.9 ± 4.4 mV and 9.0 ± 0.8 mV, respectively (n = 6). I h was completely activated at −150 mV. This is similar to what we reported previously for wt mHCN2 (V 1/2 = −101 ± 3.1 mV and k = 12.1 ± 1.7 mV, n = 7 (13Proenza C. Tran N. Angoli D. Zahynacz K. Balcar P. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29634-29642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Proenza C. Angoli D. Agranovich E. Macri V. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5101-5109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar)). Thus, the smaller I h current measured for the HCN2-Δ2–130 at −150 mV was not because of a negative shift in activation curve but probably resulted from a decrease in functional channel number or single channel conductance. Either mechanism is supported by the parallel decreases inI inst and I h, but single channel measurements and/or the determination of surface channel number will be required to answer this question. Another possible explanation for the reduction in current produced by HCN2-Δ2–130 is that the deletion of the unconserved domain could have disrupted the tertiary structure. However, other studies have found that complete exchange of NH2 termini between different HCN mammalian isoforms (with unrelated unconserved regions) did not significantly alter I h gating properties (17Viscomi C. Altomare C. Bucchi A. Camatini E. Baruscotti M. Moroni A. DiFrancesco D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29930-29934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Wang J. Chen S. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Together with the relatively normal voltage dependence of HCN2-Δ2–130 channels, these data suggest that the unconserved region of the NH2 terminus does not greatly influence the proper assembly and folding of HCN channels. Another explanation could be that the unconserved domain contains primary sequences that specifically promote assembly and/or expression (16Zerangue N. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 3591-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 19Ma D. Zerangue N. Lin Y.F. Collins A., Yu, M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 2001; 291: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). An artificial coiled coil oligomerization sequence, inserted in place of the conserved NH2-terminal tetramerization or “T1” domain of Shaker K+channels, has recently been shown to retain efficient expression of these channels (16Zerangue N. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 3591-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 20Minor Jr., D.L. Lin Y.F. Mobley B.C. Avelar A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Berger J.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We searched the mHCN2 NH2 terminus for regions with high probabilities of forming coiled coils, using a statistical coiled coil prediction program. 2The program was created by Lupas et al. (24Lupas A. Dyke M.V. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar) and was based on the prediction protocol proposed by David Parry (26Parry D.A.D. Biosci. Rep. 1982; 2: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It can be found on the Swiss EMBnet node web site at www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS_form.html. A relatively polar region of 14 amino acids (from Gln159 to Ala172) with a high probability (83.9%) of forming a coiled-coil configuration was identified within the conserved domain of the NH2 terminus. Based on this finding, we constructed a deletion mutant, HCN2-Δ2–154, further removing the amino acids up to this putative coiled-coil region (Fig. 3 C) and then determined whether functional expression was retained. Cells transfected with the HCN2-Δ2–154 clone were pulsed to −150 mV from a holding potential of −35 mV for 1 s. We found that this deletion abolished I h and reducedI inst to the same level as that of control cells transfected with only green fluorescent protein (Fig. 4,A–C). Two possible explanations for the inability of the HCN2-Δ2–154 mutant to produce currents are that: (a) the mutant channels were assembled and exported to the cell surface, but channel function was eliminated by the deletion; or (b) the mutant channels were expressed at reduced levels on the plasma membrane. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we examined the subcellular localization of HCN2-Δ2–154 compared with that of the wt HCN2. To do this, we inserted the c-Myc epitope on the COOH-terminal end of both wt HCN2 and HCN2-Δ2–154. Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing HCN2-c-Myc had immunofluorescent labeling evident on the cell surface (Fig. 4 D). In contrast, the HCN2-Δ2–154-c-Myc protein was predominantly localized in the perinuclear regions of the cell (e.g. Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, or degredatory compartments), with little or no apparent surface immunofluorescence (Fig. 4 E). Given the interactions of the conserved domain in the yeast two-hybrid assays and the elimination of currents in the HCN2-Δ2–154 mutant, the retention of the HCN2-Δ2–154 mutant protein in intracellular compartments most likely represents inefficiently assembled channels and reduced trafficking of channels to the plasma membrane as has been proposed forShaker channels lacking conserved regions of the NH2 terminus (16Zerangue N. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 3591-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We have shown that a region of 52 amino acids of the NH2 terminus, which is highly conserved among mammalian isoforms of HCN channels, is important for NH2-terminal interactions, plasma membrane localization, and expression of pacemaker currents. This region may play a role in isoform co-assembly that is similar to the role of the T1 domains inShaker channels. Although Shaker channels can form in the absence of the NH2 terminus (21Kobertz W.R. Miller C. Nat. Struct.

B., Hooper, D., Corpuz, G. P., Ramilo, C. A., Bandyopadhyay, P., Cruz, L. J., and Olivera, B. M. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 1583–1588). The C. gloriamaris spasmodic peptide has been synthesized, and the refolded polypeptide was shown to be biologically active using a mouse bioassay. The chemically synthesized gm9a elicited the same symptomatology described previously for natively folded tx9a, and gm9a and tx9a were of similar potency, implying that neither the two γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues found in tx9a (Ser8and Ala13 in gm9a) nor Gly1 (Ser1in gm9a) are crucial for biological activity. We have determined the three-dimensional structure of gm9a in aqueous solution and demonstrated that the molecule adopts the well known inhibitory cystine knot motif constrained by three disulfide bonds involving Cys2-Cys16, Cys6-Cys18and Cys12-Cys23. Based on the gm9a structure, the sites of Gla substitution in tx9a are in loops located on one surface of the molecule, which is unlikely to be involved directly in receptor binding. Because this is the first structure reported for a member of the newly defined P-superfamily conotoxins, a comparison has been made with structurally related conotoxins. This shows that the structural scaffold that characterizes the P-conotoxins has the greatest potential for exhibiting structural diversity among the robust inhibitory cystine knot-containing conotoxins, a finding that has implications for functional epitope mimicry and protein engineering.

The new polypeptide defined a new class of venom components, the P-conotoxin superfamily, which has a distinctive cysteine framework, -CX 3CX 5CX 3CXCX 4C-, where X can be any amino acid. Conopeptides with three disulfide linkages and no half-cystines adjacent to each other have not been characterized previously (1Lirazan M.B. Hooper D. Corpuz G.P. Ramilo C.A. Bandyopadhyay P.

The polypeptide purified from C. textile venom designated the “spasmodic peptide” is unusual in two respects. First, when injected into mice it phenocopied a well known mutant, the spasmodic mouse (3Ryan S.G. Buckwalter M.S. Lynch J.W. Handford C.A. Segura L. Shiang R. Wasmuth J.J. Camper S.A. Schofield P.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Second, in addition to the standard amino acids, this polypeptide has two residues of γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla),1 a distinctive post-translationally modified amino acid.A second member of the P-superfamily was identified by molecular techniques from a different Conus species, Conus gloriamaris. The sequence of the latter was inferred from a cDNA clone (1Lirazan M.B. Hooper D. Corpuz G.P. Ramilo C.A. Bandyopadhyay P. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1583-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The predicted mature C. gloriamarissequence is largely identical to the C. textile spasmodic peptide sequence, but it does not have the two glutamate codons presumably encoding Glu residues post-translationally modified to Gla. This polypeptide has not yet been isolated from C. gloriamaris venom. The sequences of the two mature P-superfamily polypeptides are shown in Fig. 1.In this work, we have synthesized and refolded the C. gloriamaris polypeptide, gm9a, and assessed its activity in the same bioassay used to characterize tx9a. This has been done as a first step in understanding the molecular basis of the symptomatology elicited by tx9a, which is unique among known conotoxins. Of particular interest is the significance of the post-translationally modified amino acids found in tx9a but not in gm9a. Further to this end, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of gm9a in aqueous solution, which is expected to be homologous to that of tx9a considering the extent of sequence homology between the two polypeptides.Because of their small size, robustness, and scope for structural diversity, conotoxins can be regarded as scaffolds that can be engineered for the mimicry of functional epitopes (5Pallaghy P.K. Norton R.S. Biopolymers. 2000; 54: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this context, the structures of the P-conotoxins are of interest because of their novel cysteine framework. In this work, we explore the structural consequences of the additional degrees of freedom in the molecular structure that result when no Cys residues are directly adjacent in the polypeptide sequence. The gm9a structure is considered in comparison with structurally related conotoxins, particularly the well characterized O-superfamily conotoxins (6Norton R.S. Pallaghy P.K. Baell J.B. Wright C.E.

A second polypeptide that had high sequence identity with tx9a including the distinctive Cys framework was identified in that work from C. gloriamaris. In this work, we have synthesized the gm9a polypeptide from C. gloriamaris and determined that it is pharmacologically related to tx9a. We have found these polypeptides to be indistinguishable in an in vivo assay in mice in which both the polypeptides phenocopy the spasmodic mouse mutant (3Ryan S.G. Buckwalter M.S. Lynch J.W.

In this mouse, there are alterations in glycine receptors, but the molecular target of the Conuspolypeptides in the central nervous system has not yet been determined (1Lirazan M.B. Hooper D.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1583-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Functional Diversity among ConotoxinsOne of the tenets of structural genomics is that structure provides clues regarding function, but it has been pointed out that this nexus generally is weak in the case of polypeptide toxins (33Norton R.S. Ménez A. Perspectives in Molecular Toxinology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2002: 159-173Google Scholar). This is certainly true of the conotoxins where functional diversity is achieved by a combination of sequence variation and structural variation. As a result, structural analysis reveals few clues as to the potential molecular target of a given polypeptide. Fig.5 shows ribbon representations of several conotoxin structures that contain six Cys residues and exhibit the same disulfide-bonding pattern exhibited by gm9a, namely C1-C4/C2-C5/C3-C6.

These polypeptides are similarly structured but functionally distinct. The μ-conotoxins bind selectively to sodium channels (34Wakamatsu K. Kohda D. Hatanaka H. Lancelin J.M. Ishida Y. Oya M.

All of these polypeptides exhibit the ICK motif within the same Cys framework (-CX 6CX 6CCX 2–3CX 4–6C-), and despite significant sequence diversity, even among the ω-conotoxins, all have a remarkably similar structure. However, the ω-conotoxins SO3 (H), MVIIA (I), and GVIA (J) all selectively inhibit voltage-gated calcium channels (41Nielsen K.J. Thomas L. Lewis R.J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 42Pallaghy P.K. Norton R.S. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 53: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and PVIIA (K), a κ-conotoxin, selectively inhibits Shaker potassium channels (43Savarin P. Guenneugues M. Gilquin B. Lamthanh H. Gasparini S. Zinn-Justin S. Ménez A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5407-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast is conotoxin GS (E), which is structurally related to the O-conotoxins through a common Cys framework and ICK motif but is functionally related to the μ-conotoxins as it binds competitively with μ-GIIIA to skeletal muscle sodium channels (38Hill J.M. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Structure. 1997; 5: 571-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This is complicated further by the fact that conotoxin GS has low sequence identity with either GIIIA or GIIIB and is 50% larger.Structural Diversity within SuperfamiliesDespite having a Cys framework in common, there can also be significant structural diversity among members of a given superfamily. This diversity can be attributed mainly to the different inter-cysteine spacings across the sequences and is well illustrated by considering the structural variation among the O-superfamily polypeptides (Fig. 5,D–K), all of which have a common Cys framework and exhibit the ICK motif.There is significant sequence variation among ω-SO3 (Fig. 5,H), ω-MVIIA (I), ω-GVIA (J), and κ-PVIIA (K), even though they have very similar structures. An inspection of Table II shows that the number of residues between sequential cysteines is reasonably consistent across the four polypeptides, i.e. 6 (C1-C2), 6 (C2-C3), 0 (C3-C4), 2–3 (C4-C5), and 4–6 (C5-C6). By contrast, conotoxin GS (E) has inter-cysteine spacings of 6, 3, 0, 4, and 7 and a structure that differs from the ω- and κ-conotoxins. In TVIIA (D), these spacings are 6, 3, 0, 4, and 4, and as a consequence, it has essentially the same structure as conotoxin GS over the disulfide-linked region of the molecule with the exception that the loop between C5 and C6 is approximately half as large in TVIIA (Fig. 5). A similarly significant departure from the classic ω-conotoxin fold is observed in EVIA (G), which has the spacings of 6, 9, 0, 3, and 3. When this type of analysis is applied to the P-conotoxin gm9a in which 3, 5, 3, 1, and 4 residues separate sequential Cys residues, it is readily apparent why the structure of this polypeptide is unique among those shown in Fig.5.In light of this analysis, two points can be made with regard to the newly defined P-conotoxins. First, because the number of residues between sequential half-cystines is a significant indicator of structural variation and as new members of this family of conopeptides are identified, this source of structural diversity can be used to assess the extent of their homology with gm9a. Second, because the P-conotoxins have no cysteines directly adjacent to one another, the scaffold underlying this superfamily of polypeptides has the greatest scope for exhibiting structural and functional diversity among all of the six Cys-containing conotoxins. This latter point has significant implications for protein engineering and functional epitope mimicry (40Mourier G. Servent D. Zinn-Justin S. Ménez A. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 45Vita C. Drakopoulou E. Vizzavona J. Rochette S. Martin L. Ménez A. Roumestand C. Yang Y.S. Ylisastigui L. Benjouad A. Gluckman J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13091-13096Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). An inspection of the structure of gm9a suggests that the loops between the second and third half-cysteines and the fifth and sixth are potentially the most suitable for the introduction of new sequences.Implications for tx9a from C. textileChemically synthesized gm9a, the C. gloriamaris spasmodic peptide, has biological activity comparable to that elicited by the C. textile spasmodic peptide in an in vivo assay in mice (1Lirazan M.B. Hooper D. Corpuz G.P. Ramilo C.A. Bandyopadhyay P. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1583-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The two spasmodic peptide sequences from C. textile(tx9a) and C. gloriamaris (gm9a) differ in only three positions, with Ser1, Ser8, and Ala13 in gm9a substituted for Gly, Gla, and Gla, respectively, in tx9a. We expect tx9a to adopt a conformation similar to that of gm9a, because the location of the six Cys residues is identical in the two polypeptides, the substitution at the flexible N terminus is not likely to be structurally significant, and the two Gla substitutions involve neither glycine nor proline residues, mutations that might be expected to yield structural variation. In addition, it was demonstrated by Hill et al. (38Hill J.M. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Structure. 1997; 5: 571-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) that substituting Gla for Glu in conotoxin GS resulted in no change in the backbone conformation of that polypeptide.The nature of the molecular target of gm9a and tx9a remains undefined, but the symptomatology elicited by both polypeptides is reminiscent of spasmodic and spastic mouse mutants (3Ryan S.G. Buckwalter M.S. Lynch J.W. Handford C.A. Segura L. Shiang R. Wasmuth J.J. Camper S.A. Schofield P. O'Connell P. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 4Saul B. Schmieden V. Kling C. Mulhardt C. Gass P. Kuhse J. Becker C.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which were characterized as being defective in glycine receptors. Although the receptor for these polypeptides is still to be determined, it is apparent from the comparable results of the mouse assays that the two γ-carboxyglutamates in tx9a are not involved directly in receptor binding.An analysis of the gm9a structure shows that residues 8 and 13 (Fig.4 F) are found on the same face of the molecule, flanking the only acidic residue Asp11. One consequence of this finding is that on one face of the molecule, tx9a is substantially more electronegative than is gm9a. This is significant because in the main, conotoxins are rich in basic side-chains (see Table II) that interact with anionic sites in their ion channel receptors. This also implies that this region of the molecular surface does not constitute the receptor-binding interface of these polypeptides. Rather, it can be inferred that the polar face of these molecules is solvent-exposed when the polypeptides bind their target and that the binding epitope is probably on the hydrophobic/cationic face of the molecule.γ-Carboxyglutamates have been implicated in Ca2+ binding by Prorok et al. (39Prorok M. Warder S.E. Blandl T. Castellino F.J.

In these polypeptides, however, Gla residues are in close proximity to one another with some being adjacent in the sequences. Hill et al. (38Hill J.M. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Structure. 1997; 5: 571-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) considered the possibility that the single Gla residue in conotoxin GS might be involved in Ca2+ binding. They demonstrated by NMR that there was no conformational change in the polypeptide observable in the presence of calcium ions and found no evidence of line broadening or perturbation of Gla32side-chain resonances that might indicate calcium binding. It was concluded that this single residue might not play a crucial role in either the structure or function of conotoxin GS.tx9a has two Gla residues, but inspection of the gm9a structures indicates that across the family of 20 structures, residues 8 and 13 are always >10-Å apart. Clearly, this is too large a distance for these residues to cooperatively chelate Ca2+ ions in the folded structure. However, it is conceivable that one or other of the Gla residues and the intervening Asp11 could participate in Ca2+ binding in tx9a. It is also possible that these Gla residues could be involved in the folding of the tx9a polypeptide. Prorok et al. (39Prorok M. Warder S.E. Blandl T. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16528-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) found that Ca2+binding induced an increase in the α-helical content of the conantokins considered in their work. In gm9a and presumably in tx9a, residues 8 and 13 are found in the loops of the molecule. In tx9a, the formation of these loops could conceivably be induced by Ca2+ binding. A novel Conus polypeptide was recently purified and characterized from the venom of Conus textile, aConus species known to hunt other snails (1Lirazan M.B. Hooper D. Corpuz G.P. Ramilo C.A. Bandyopadhyay P. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1583-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The new polypeptide defined a new class of venom components, the P-conotoxin superfamily, which has a distinctive cysteine framework, -CX 3CX 5CX 3CXCX 4C-, where X can be any amino acid. Conopeptides with three disulfide linkages and no half-cystines adjacent to each other have not been characterized previously (1Lirazan M.B. Hooper D. Corpuz G.P. Ramilo C.A. Bandyopadhyay P.

The polypeptide purified from C. textile venom designated the “spasmodic peptide” is unusual in two respects. First, when injected into mice it phenocopied a well known mutant, the spasmodic mouse (3Ryan S.G. Buckwalter M.S. Lynch J.W. Handford C.A. Segura L. Shiang R. Wasmuth J.J. Camper S.A. Schofield P.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Second, in addition to the standard amino acids, this polypeptide has two residues of γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla),1 a distinctive post-translationally modified amino acid. A second member of the P-superfamily was identified by molecular techniques from a different Conus species, Conus gloriamaris. The sequence of the latter was inferred from a cDNA clone (1Lirazan M.B. Hooper D. Corpuz G.P. Ramilo C.A. Bandyopadhyay P. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1583-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The predicted mature C. gloriamarissequence is largely identical to the C. textile spasmodic peptide sequence, but it does not have the two glutamate codons presumably encoding Glu residues post-translationally modified to Gla. This polypeptide has not yet been isolated from C. gloriamaris venom. The sequences of the two mature P-superfamily polypeptides are shown in Fig. 1. In this work, we have synthesized and refolded the C. gloriamaris polypeptide, gm9a, and assessed its activity in the same bioassay used to characterize tx9a. This has been done as a first step in understanding the molecular basis of the symptomatology elicited by tx9a, which is unique among known conotoxins. Of particular interest is the significance of the post-translationally modified amino acids found in tx9a but not in gm9a. Further to this end, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of gm9a in aqueous solution, which is expected to be homologous to that of tx9a considering the extent of sequence homology between the two polypeptides. Because of their small size, robustness, and scope for structural diversity, conotoxins can be regarded as scaffolds that can be engineered for the mimicry of functional epitopes (5Pallaghy P.K. Norton R.S. Biopolymers. 2000; 54: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this context, the structures of the P-conotoxins are of interest because of their novel cysteine framework. In this work, we explore the structural consequences of the additional degrees of freedom in the molecular structure that result when no Cys residues are directly adjacent in the polypeptide sequence. The gm9a structure is considered in comparison with structurally related conotoxins, particularly the well characterized O-superfamily conotoxins (6Norton R.S. Pallaghy P.K. Baell J.B. Wright C.E.

The lipid-A preparation consisted of a mixture of structures due to differences in fatty acylation and in the glycosyl backbone. There were two different disaccharide backbones. One disaccharide consisted of a distal glucosaminosyl residue β-linked to position 6 of a proximal 2-aminoglucono-1,5-lactonosyl residue, and in the second disaccharide, the proximal residue was 2-amino-2,3-dideoxy-d-<i>erythro</i>-hex-2-enono-1,5-lactone. For both disaccharides, the distal glucosamine was acylated at C-2′ primarily with β-hydroxypalmitate (β-OHC16:0) which, in turn, was <i>O</i>-acylated with 27-hydroxyoctacosanoic acid. For some of the lipid-A molecules, the distal glucosaminosyl residue was also acylated at C-3′ with β-hydroxymyristate (β-OHC14:0), whereas other molecules were devoid of this acyl substituent. Both the 2-aminoglucono-1,5-lactonosyl and 2-amino-2,3-dideoxy-d-<i>erythro</i>-hex-2-enono-1,5-lactonosyl residues were acylated at C-2, primarily with β-OHC16:0.

Although TFII-I functions as a signal-induced transcriptional activator, the role of the related family member hMusTRD1/BEN is less clear.

The transcription functions of hMusTRD1/BEN have not yet been well characterized biochemically. It was first reported (3O'Mahoney J.V. Guven K.L. Lin J. Joya J.E. Robinson C.S. Wade R.P. Hardeman E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18 (and Correction (2000) Mol. Cell. Biol.20, 5361): 6641-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) as a muscle specific activator of the troponin I gene. It also seems to function as an activator in yeast one-hybrid assays (6Yan X. Zhao X. Qian M. Guo N. Gong X. Zhu X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, clear demonstration of its activator function is not yet obtained. Results from our laboratory suggest that hMusTRD1/BEN behaves as a specific repressor of TFII-I (10Tussié-Luna M.I. Bayarsaihan D. Ruddle F.H. Roy A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7789-7794Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although each protein when individually expressed exhibits predominant nuclear localization in eukaryotic cells, TFII-I is excluded from the nucleus when it is co-expressed with hMusTRD1/BEN. Nuclear exclusion of TFII-I results in the repression of the TFII-I-responsive c-fos gene. A key to this novel nuclear exclusion function appears to be the serine stretch (ss)1 in hMusTRD1/BEN because deletion of this stretch results in co-occupancy of both proteins in the nucleus (10Tussié-Luna M.I. Bayarsaihan D. Ruddle F.H. Roy A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7789-7794Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, although the Δss hMusTRD1/BEN failed to prevent nuclear localization of TFII-I, the transcriptional repression of TFII-I was still observed. The latter data led us to postulate that the repression by hMusTRD1/BEN involves the following two-step mechanism: a competition for a common cytoplasmic factor required for nuclear translocation and a competition for a nuclear cofactor required for transcriptional activation. In an attempt to identify these putative factors that are shared by both the activator (TFII-I) and the repressor (hMusTRD1/BEN), we performed a two-hybrid screen using TFII-I and hMusTRD1/BEN as baits. We screened both yeast genomic and mouse cDNA libraries with the rationale that these screens would ideally yield homologous proteins. We further set the criteria such that (a) the interacting proteins should interact with both hMusTRD1/BEN and TFII-I and (b) the nuclear cofactor must interact with both the wild type and the Δss hMusTRD1/BEN, whereas the cytoplasmic factor should not interact with the latter. By employing such a double screen, we report that we have identified protein Siz2/Miz1/PIASxβ that appears to be the nuclear cofactor that interacts with TFII-I as well as the wild type and the Δss hMusTRD1/BEN. The yeast library screen yielded NFI1 (neck filament interacting protein) also known as Siz2 (after SAP and Miz) (12Strunnikov A.V. Aravind L. Koonin V.

NFI1/Siz2 and Miz1/mPIASxβ interact more avidly with hMusTRD1/BEN than TFII-I both in yeast and in mammalian interaction assays. This RING-like zinc finger-containing factor is localized exclusively in the nucleus and failed to alter the nuclear residency of TFII-I or hMusTRD1/BEN in mammalian localization assays. Consistent with these properties, ectopic Miz1/mPIASxβ augments transcriptional activation by TFII-I and alleviates Δss hMusTRD1/BEN-mediated transcriptional repression.

Experiments were done at least three times with triplicate sets included each time. At 42 h post-transfection COS7 cells were harvested, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, and lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25 °C, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm NaF, 2 mmNa3VO4, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 1× antiprotease mixture EDTA-free (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. Total protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). 800 μg of whole cell extracts were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-TFII-I antibody, and 300 μg were used for GST pull down. Incubations with protein A-agarose or glutathione-agarose beads (50 μl, 1:1 slurry; Invitrogen and Sigma, respectively) were done for 2 h, rocking at 4 °C. At the end of the incubation, the beads were washed 2 times with 1 ml of lysis buffer without detergents. After the final wash, 4× SDS sample buffer was added to the beads, boiled at 100 °C for 3 min, and loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE. Semi-dry transfer to nitrocellulose was done as described (18Novina C.D.

The mouse monoclonal antibodies, anti-GST (GST-2, Sigma) and anti-GFP (JL-18, Clontech), were used at 1:3500 and 1:2000, respectively. Detection was done by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using standard methods. COS7 cells were transfected with 200 ng of each construct, and 36 h post-transfection cells were fixed as described before (10Tussié-Luna M.I. Bayarsaihan D. Ruddle F.H. Roy A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody anti-GST (GST-2, Sigma) (1:3500) followed by Alexa 594 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) (1:20,000) and visualized on a fluorescence E400 Nikon microscope. In an attempt to identify the putative factors that are shared by both TFII-I and hMusTRD1/BEN, we performed a two-hybrid screen using both of these proteins sequentially as baits. We screened both yeast genomic library and a mouse cDNA library with the rationale that these screens would ideally yield homologous proteins. Indeed, by using this approach, the yeast library screen yielded NFI1/Siz2 (12Strunnikov A.V. Aravind L. Koonin V. Genetics. 2001; 158: 95-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A.

Gene (Amst.). 2001; 275: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), whereas the mouse library screen yielded the corresponding homologue, Miz1/mPIASxβ (19Wu L., Wu, H. Sangiorgi F., Wu, N.

Although in all our analyses we have used the cDNA corresponding to Miz1, sequence analysis revealed that Miz1 is actually a truncated form of mPIASxβ missing the N-terminal 124 amino acids. The PIAS proteins belong to a large family of proteins that share two highly conserved motifs (Fig.2) as follows: a SAP domain (a putative DNA-binding motif) presumably involved in chromosomal organization (12Strunnikov A.V.

Importantly, both NFI1/SIZ2 and Miz1/mPIASxβ interacted better with Δss hMusTRD1/BEN. Our final selection of true positive clones was determined under extremely stringent conditions (Fig. 1). Hence, the observation that TFII-I yeast co-transformants grow much slower than wt or Δss hMusTRD1/BEN yeast co-transformants reflects the strength of interaction. We conclude that Siz2/Miz1/mPIASxβ interaction with hMusTRD1/BEN in yeast is stronger than the interaction of Siz2/Miz1/mPIASxβ with TFII-I.Figure 2Schematics of PIAS family proteins.Members of this family are found in different eukaryotic species. The relative localization of the SAP domain, proline-rich domain (putative SH3 binding domain), serine/threonine/glutamine-rich domain, RING-like zinc finger, and the putative nuclear localization signals are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) After establishing interactions of Siz2/Miz1/mPIASxβ with both TFII-I and hMusTRD1/BEN in yeast, we wanted to corroborate these interactions in mammalian cells. Furthermore, to determine which regions of Miz1/mPIASxβ are important for potential physical and functional interactions with TFII-I and hMusTRD1/BEN, we also generated a series of C-terminal mutants (Fig.3 A). For interaction studies, we either expressed GST-tagged Miz1/mPIASxβ (wild type or mutants) alone or with GFP-tagged TFII-I (Fig. 3 B) or with GFP-tagged hMusTRD1/BEN (Fig. 4) in COS7 cells. The potential interactions were analyzed either by immunoprecipitation (for TFII-I, Fig. 3 B, upper panel) or by GST pull down (for hMusTRD1/BEN, Fig. 4, upper panels). These results revealed that wild type GST-Miz1/mPIASxβ was immunoprecipitated when co-expressed with GFP-TFII-I (Fig. 3 B, compare lane 1 with lane 2). Deletion of the C-terminal 141 amino acids, containing the serine-threonine-rich regions, increased the interaction of this mutant with TFII-I (compare lane 2 with3). Further deletion from the C-terminal end, including the putative nuclear localization signals and the RING finger (ΔC382), also somewhat enhanced the interaction of this mutant with TFII-I (compare lanes 2 and 4). Whereas deletion of a portion of the RING/zinc finger (amino acids 231–236, ΔZF) or deletion of a putative nuclear localization signal (ΔNLS1) did not alter the interaction of Miz1/mPIASxβ with TFII-I (lanes 5and 6), deletion of the putative second NLS (ΔNLS2) significantly diminished the interaction with TFII-I (lane 7). The amount of immunoprecipitated TFII-I in all lanes was comparable except in lane 5 (bottom panel). However, when normalized to the precipitated protein in lane 1, it appears that the interaction of TFII-I with ΔZF is even better than the wild type Miz1/mPIASxβ. These results suggested that interaction of Miz1/mPIASxβ with TFII-I is mediated largely through the N-terminal portion of Miz1/mPIASxβ that does not include the RING/zinc finger.Figure 4Miz1/mPIASxβ interacts with hMusTRD1/BEN in mammalian cells.GST-Miz1/mPIASxβ proteins were used as baits for GST pull-down assays. COS7 cells were transfected with 10 μg each of GST-Miz1/mPIASxβ wt (lanes 1 and 8), GST-Miz1/mPIASxβ ΔZF (lanes 2 and 3), GST-Miz1/mPIASxβ ΔNLS1 (lanes 4 and 5), GST-Miz1/mPIASxβ ΔNLS2 (lanes 6 and 7), GST-Miz1/mPIASxβ ΔC141 (lanes 9 and 10), GST-Miz1/mPIASxβ ΔC237 (lanes 11 and 12), or GST-Miz1/mPIASxβ ΔC382 (lanes 13 and 14) alone or together with 10 μg of plasmid encoding GFP-hMusTRD1/BEN (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7,8, 10, 12, and 14). Blots were probed first with anti-GFP antibody (α- GFP) (upper panels), stripped, and reprobed with anti-GST antibody (α-GST) (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Identical results were obtained with hMusTRD1/BEN (Fig. 4,top and bottom panels). ΔZF Miz1/mPIASxβ interacted better than the wild type protein with hMusTRD1/BEN (compare lanes 3 and 8). Because hMusTRD1/BEN is expressed less than TFII-I in general, we observed fainter bands in GST pull-down assays with GST-Miz1/mPIASxβ. The GST pull-down assay was performed due to a lack of specific antibodies against either hMusTRD1/BEN or Miz1/mPIASxβ. Despite these differences in assay conditions, it is clear that both TFII-I and hMusTRD1/BEN interact with Miz1/mPIASxβ through the N-terminal end of Miz1/mPIASxβ. It is also worth mentioning that Δss hMusTRD1/BEN also interacted with Miz1/mPIASxβ in GST pull-down assays (data not shown). Although members of PIAS family of proteins have been shown to exhibit nuclear residency, no definitive localization for Miz1/mPIASxβ has been documented. To determine the functional nuclear localization signal in Miz1/mPIASxβ, either wild type or various mutants were expressed as GST fusion proteins in COS7 cells, and their localization was determined by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 5). Miz1/mPIASxβ (wt) was localized exclusively to the nucleus when expressed individually. Although deletion of NLS1 (ΔNLS1) did not have any significant effect, deletion of NLS2 (ΔNLS2) profoundly altered the nuclear residency of Miz1/mPIASxβ, suggesting that NLS2 is the functional sequence under our conditions and in this cell type. Neither deletion of the zinc/RING finger motifs (ΔZF) nor deletion of the C-terminal 141 amino acids (ΔC141) had significant effect on the nuclear localization of Miz1/mPIASxβ. Interestingly, ΔZF localizes in nuclear dots far more than the wild type protein. Also a slight cytoplasmic spreading out observed with overexpression of ΔC141 may be due to the fact that the deletion is too close to NLS2. As anticipated, further deletion from the C-terminal end (ΔC237 and ΔC382) had severe effect on the nuclear localization of Miz1/mPIASxβ because both of these mutations remove the functional NLS2 (Fig. 5). We rationalized that if Miz1/mPIASxβ is indeed a nuclear cofactor for TFII-I, then it should have a nuclear residency even in the presence of TFII-I. To test this idea, either wild type or various mutants of GST-Miz1/mPIASxβ were co-expressed with GFP-TFII-I or GFP-hMusTRD1/BEN in COS7 cells, and their localization was determined by indirect immunofluorescence. As expected, there was no change in the nuclear localization of either Miz1/mPIASxβ or TFII-I when these proteins were co-expressed and both co-localized in the nucleus (Fig.6). Identical results were also obtained when Miz1/mPIASxβ was co-expressed with hMusTRD1/BEN (Fig. 6). However, these results do not indicate whether the interactions between Miz1/mPIASxβ and TFII-I or hMusTRD1/BEN occur in the nucleus. In order to test whether the interactions are occurring in the cytoplasm or nucleus, we employed the ΔNLS2 mutant of Miz1/mPIASxβ. Our rationale was that if the two proteins interact stably in the cytoplasm, wild type TFII-I or wild type hMusTRD1/BEN should be able to “carry” the NLS mutant Miz1/mPIASxβ to the nucleus. However, no significant change in cytoplasmic localization of ΔNLS2 Miz1/mPIASxβ was observed when co-expressed with either TFII-I or with hMusTRD1/BEN. These data suggests that either interaction between these proteins is not strong enough or that it occurs inside the nucleus. Based on the fact that we observe a greatly diminished interaction of the ΔNLS2 Miz1/mPIASxβ with TFII-I or hMusTRD1/BEN, we prefer the latter explanation. In converse experiments both a nuclear signal deficient-TFII-I or a nuclear-deficient hMusTRD1/BEN remains in the cytoplasm when co-expressed with wild type Miz1/mPIASxβ further corroborating our idea (data not shown). We have also observed that the nuclear localization of TFII-I does not change substantially when it is ectopically expressed in a yeast strain that lacks the SIZ2 gene and subsequently complemented with ectopic Miz1/mPIASxβ. 2M. I. Tussié-Luna and A. L. Roy, unpublished data. Because we observed an enhanced interaction between the ΔC382 and TFII-I or hMusTRD1/BEN, we also wanted to test whether such interactions might lead to alteration in nuclear localization of the latter proteins. However, upon co-expression of TFII-I or hMusTRD1/BEN with ΔC382 Miz1/mPIASxβ, we did not observe any significant change in nuclear localization of TFII-I or hMusTRD1/BEN. Although 77% of ectopically TFII-I remained in the nucleus when co-expressed with wild type Miz1/mPIASxβ, 70% of nuclear TFII-I was found when it is co-expressed with ΔC382 Miz1/mPIASxβ. Thus, the enhanced interaction of TFII-I or hMusTRD1/BEN with ΔC382 Miz1/mPIASxβ most likely occurred at a post-lysis stage. Because TFII-I and Miz1/mPIASxβ co-localize in the nucleus, we were interested to test whether Miz1/mPIASxβ would augment or inhibit transcriptional activity of TFII-I. However, if Miz1/mPIASxβ is indeed the nuclear cofactor that we sought, then it should co-activate rather than repress. In transient co-transfection assays with c-fos as a reporter and in the presence of rhEGF, TFII-I activated the c"

The development of circulatory shock is often linked to a systemic inflammatory response to endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide; LPS)1 in the blood of affected patients, strongly implicating endotoxemia as a critical factor in pathogenesis.

Shock. 1994; 44: 216-220PubMed Google Scholar, 29Morris D. Moore J.N. Am. J. Vet. Res. 1992; 1992: 1565-1569Google Scholar), was used to confirm TNFα bioactivity in the supernatants. Binding assays were performed according to the method described by Kitchens and Munford (30Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9904-9910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, Mono Mac 6 cells were preincubated in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 300 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm NaF, 5 mmdeoxyglucose, 10 mm NaN3 (SEBDEF buffer) to prevent ligand internalization. Tritiated E. coli LPS (30 μg/ml final concentration) was mixed with increasing concentrations of either unlabeled E. coli or Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum as a source of LBP prior to addition to the cells. These mixtures were then incubated with the cells at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold SEBDEF buffer, solubilized in scintillation mixture, and cell-bound [3H]LPS was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. In preliminary experiments, pretreatment of Mono Mac 6 cells with the anti-CD14 neutralizing antibody, 60bca (1.4 μl ascites fluid), for 30 min reduced binding of the tritiated E. coli LPS by >85% (data not shown). Binding assays were performed with CD14-transfected CHO cells expressing high levels of human CD14 (31Medvedev A. Henneke P. Schromm A. Lien E. Ingalls R. Fenton M. Golenbock D. Vogel S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Cells were released from the flasks with trypsin, washed twice, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in SEBDEF buffer. Cell viability and number were assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Ligands (Alexa FluorE. coli LPS and unlabeled E. coli orRhizobium Sin-1 LPS) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in fetal calf serum to form LPS·LBP complexes prior to addition to the cells. Complexes were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 2 × 105 cells suspended in SEBDEF buffer. Thereafter, the cells were washed three times, suspended in SEBDEF buffer, and analyzed on a Beckman Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer. Expression of CD14 by cells was monitored with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD14 antibody, MY-4. To assess binding of LPS to LBP, we used a commercially available LBP competitive binding ELISA assay. This assay is based on that described by Scott et al. (32Scott M.G. Vreugdenhil A.C. Buurman W.A. Hancock R.E. Gold M.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) to demonstrate competition between polymyxin B or cationic peptides and LPS for binding to LBP. Briefly, biotinylated E. coli LPS was mixed with increasing concentrations of either E. colior Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS. These complexes were then incubated with antibody-immobilized LBP in wells of a microtiter plate. Wells were washed, and binding of the biotinylated E. coli LPS to the LBP was detected colorimetrically atA 450 with streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate and tetramethylbenzidine as substrate. To demonstrate competitive binding of unlabeled Rhizobium Sin-1 or E. coli LPS to purified recombinant CD14, we used native PAGE mobility shift assays as described by Hailman et al. (33Hailman E. Lichenstein H. Wurfel M. Miller D. Johnson D. Kelley M. Busse L. Zukowski M. Wright S. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 179: 269-277Crossref Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg/ml [3H]E. coli LCD25 LPS was sonicated in the presence or absence of either 250 μg/ml unlabeledE. coli LCD25 LPS or Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS in Mg2+/Ca2+-free phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA. Thereafter, 1 μg of recombinant CD14 was added to the tubes and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Complexes were resolved by 4–20% native PAGE at 150 V for ∼2 h. The gels were fixed in 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid, soaked in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min, and exposed to Kodak XAR film for 2 days. Autoradiographs were scanned densitometrically, and changes in the binding of the radiolabel to the CD14 was reported as arbitrary values. Inclusion of LBP during the incubations did not significantly alter the binding of the radiolabel to CD14 or the competition of either unlabeled LPS for binding to CD14 during these assays (data not shown). As a specificity control, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin was incubated with the [3H]E. coli LPS; no mobility shift of the radiolabel was evident. All values are listed as means ± S.E. (S.E.). Analyses were performed with GraphPad PrismTMsoftware. The data were analyzed with analysis of variance with Bonferroni's post hoc test. Significance was set at p< 0.05. Incubation of Mono Mac 6 cells with LPS at concentrations of 10 and 100 ng/ml resulted in significant secretion of TNFα only in response to E. coli LPS. LPS fromRhizobium Sin-1 and R. galegae did not induce TNFα secretion, whereas LPS from R. etli CE3 was a weak agonist (Fig. 1). Concentrations ofRhizobium Sin-1 LPS up to 1 μg/ml failed to induce TNFα secretion by the Mono Mac 6 cells (data not shown). Based on the lack of response toRhizobium Sin-1 LPS, its potential to act as an antagonist of E. coli LPS-induced TNFα secretion was explored. To this end, E. coli LPS concentration-response curves were determined in the absence and presence of three increasing concentrations of Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS (100, 200, or 300 ng/ml; Fig. 2 A). In the absence of Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS, E. coli LPS produced a concentration-dependent increase in TNFα synthesis, which plateaued at concentrations exceeding 32 ng/ml. Preincubation with Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS produced parallel shifts of the E. coli LPS-response curve to “the right.” The latter findings indicate that Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS antagonized the E. coli LPS-induced stimulation of the cells. Further analysis of these data indicated that the EC50 (concentration of E. coli LPS required to induce 50% maximal TNFα synthesis) increased 3.9-, 9.7-, and 10.1-fold at the three concentrations of Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS (E. coli alone, 3.1 ng/ml; E. coli +Rhizobium Sin-1 100 and 12.1 ng/ml; E. coli +Rhizobium Sin-1 200 and 30.1 ng/ml; E. coli +Rhizobium Sin-1 300 and 31.5 ng/ml). Schild regression analysis (log (dose ratio −1) versus log (Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS)) of these data (Fig. 2 B) yielded a slope of 1, indicating that Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS is a competitive inhibitor of E. coli LPS. Furthermore, thex intercept reveals an apparent dissociation constant of ∼40 ng/ml for Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS. The results of competitive binding assays performed with either unlabeled E. coli LPS or Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS in Mono Mac 6 cells (Fig. 3 A) demonstrate that both Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS and E. coli LPS compete with the [3H]E. coli LPS-binding site on Mono Mac 6 cells. Although Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS was somewhat less potent than E. coli LPS, increasing concentrations provided complete displacement of [3H]E. coliLPS-specific binding, indicating that binding of the two LPS species is mutually exclusive. The results of flow cytometric assays (Fig. 3 B) with CHO cells expressing CD14 indicate that unlabeled RhizobiumSin-1 LPS, unlabeled E. coli LPS, and MY4 prevented binding of fluorescently labeled E. coli LPS; fluorescently labeledE. coli LPS did not bind to CHO cells not expressing CD14 (data not shown). The fact that MY4 is a CD14-specific monoclonal antibody supports the conclusion that E. coli LPS is binding to these CD14+ CHO cells via CD14 and that inhibition of this binding by Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS occurs by preventing the binding of E. coli LPS to CD14. To determine whether Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS competes with E. coli LPS at the level of CD14, we used native PAGE mobility shift assays with Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS, tritiated E. coli LPS, and purified CD14. Incubation of tritiated E. coli LPS with CD14 caused an increased mobility of the radiolabel on native polyacrylamide gels through the formation of an LPS:CD14 complex (Fig. 4). Inclusion of a 250-fold excess of either unlabeled E. coli LCD25 orRhizobium Sin-1 LPS during the incubation decreased binding of [3H]E. coli LCD25 LPS by 47 and 49%, respectively. Inclusion of purified LBP during these incubations did not alter the ability of Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS to displace binding of the E. coli LPS to CD14. These data suggest that occupancy of CD14 on intact monocytes by Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS mediates the decrease in binding of E. coli LPS to these cells. The results of studies performed with immobilized LBP (Fig. 5) show that unlabeled Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS competes with biotinylatedE. coli LPS for binding to LBP. These data show thatRhizobium Sin-1 LPS and E. coli LPS bind to LBP in a mutually exclusive manner with Hill coefficient slopes of 1.0.Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS bound more avidly to LBP than did unlabeled E. coli LPS as reflected by an IC50value that was 3.5-fold lower than that for E. coli LPS (34.7 and 121.1 ng/ml, respectively, for Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS and E. coli LPS). In this study, two hypotheses were tested, namely that structurally novel LPS from nitrogen-fixing rhizobial bacteria would not induce, or would only minimally induce, TNFα synthesis by human monocytes and that the rhizobial LPS inducing the least synthesis of TNFα would antagonize the pro-inflammatory effects of E. coli LPS. These hypotheses were based on the unusual lipid-A structures of the rhizobial LPSs and on the fact that alterations in the structural features of E. coli lipid-A (based on studies using LPS from other bacterial species or natural and synthetic lipid-A analogs (19Loppnow H. Libby P. Freudenberg M. Krauss J.H. Weckesser J. Mayer H. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3743-3750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Takayama K. Qureshi N. Beutler B. Kirkland T.N. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 1336-1338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) have been associated with reductions in the endotoxicity and with the acquisition of endotoxin antagonist activity. The rhizobial LPSs were obtained from R. etli CE3, R. galegae, and Rhizobium Sin-1. The lipid-A portions of these three different LPSs have different, but closely related, structures. The structures of R. etli CE3 lipid-A have been reported (23Bhat U.R. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14402-14410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Que N.L.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 28017-28027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and are shown in Fig.6 A, whereas the structures ofRhizobium Sin-1 lipid-A are shown in Fig. 6 B(39Jeyaretnam B.S. Glushka V.S. Kolli K. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41802-41810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The structures of R. galegae lipid-A are still under investigation. The LPSs from these rhizobial species were of interest due to the fact that their lipid-A structures proved to be very different from those of enteric bacteria, as well as from some other rhizobial species, in that they do not have a bis-phosphorylated glucosamine disaccharide backbone and have very different fatty acylation patterns. In addition, the R. etli CE3 lipid-A differs from that of Rhizobium sp. Sin-1 in several ways. First, the R. etli CE3 lipid-A carbohydrate backbone has a galacturonosyl residue at the 4′-position of the distal glucosamine. Second, a significant portion of the R. etli CE 3 lipid-A structures contain glucosamine as a proximal residue, i.e.it is not oxidized to 2-aminogluconic acid. Third, the principleN-fatty acyl residue of R. etli CE3 lipid-A is β-OHC14:0 rather than β-OHC16:0, Fourth, a significant percentage of the Rhizobium Sin-1 lipid-A molecules lack a fatty acyl residue at the 3′-position. Fifth, the 27-OHC28:0 residue of theRhizobium Sin-1 lipid-A is not acylated with β-hydroxybutyrate. Although the R. galegae lipid-A structure (not shown) has not yet been completed, it appears to differ from that of Rhizobium Sin-1 only in the possible presence of a glucosyl residue at the 4′-position. The LPSs from the three rhizobial species all proved to have a greatly reduced capacity to induce TNFα. Both the R. galegae andRhizobium Sin-1 LPSs were unable to induce TNFα synthesis even at mg/ml concentrations, whereas a 10 ng/ml concentration ofE. coli LPS was a potent agonist of TNFα synthesis. However, the LPS from R. etli CE3 did induce TNFα synthesis at concentrations of 100 ng/ml and was, therefore, a weak agonist. This difference between the R. etli CE3 andRhizobium Sin-1 (or R. galegae) activities is most likely due to one or more of the above-mentioned structural differences between the two different lipid-As. For example, it may be that the 4′-galacturonosyl of R. etli CE3 lipid-A provides a negative charge at that position (e.g. in place of phosphate), which results in the slight agonist activity. Because the purpose of this work was to pursue those lipid-A structures which minimize agonist activity and maximize antagonist activity, the structural basis for the difference between the R. etli CE3 and Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS activities was not investigated further. Thus, the LPS from Rhizobium Sin-1 was selected to perform the remaining experiments because it lacked agonist activity at all concentrations tested. The Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS preparation used contains a variety of lipid-A moieties with minor structural differences. The mixture of possible lipid-A structures inRhizobium Sin-1 LPS are described in the companion paper (39Jeyaretnam B.S. Glushka V.S. Kolli K. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41802-41810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and shown in Fig. 6 B. In this series of studies, LPS from Rhizobium Sin-1 functioned as a potent antagonist of E. coli LPS in Mono Mac 6 cells. The data indicated that Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS acts as a competitive antagonist of E. coli LPS, with an apparent dissociation constant of ∼40 ng/ml. When compared with the reported dissociation constant of ∼30 ng/ml for E. coli LPS (36Kirkland T.N. Finley F. Leturcq D. Lee J.D. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24818-24823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the results of our study suggest that the affinities ofRhizobium Sin-1 and E. coli LPS for monocytic cells are similar. This competitive binding affinity is particularly interesting because the Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS preparation is a mixture of potentially eight or more molecules (see Fig. 6), and therefore, it is possible that only one or two of these structures is responsible for the antagonistic activity. If so, that structure(s) would have an even greater affinity than the observed 40 ng/ml value. Further experiments were done to determine the mechanism by whichRhizobium Sin-1 LPS acts as an antagonist. As described in the Introduction, two initial proteins involved in the signal transduction pathway leading to the synthesis of TNFα are CD14 and LBP. It was shown that Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS prevents the binding of E. coli LPS to both CD14 and LBP. Interference with the binding of E. coli LPS to CD14 was shown by the fact that Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS competed with tritiatedE. coli LPS for binding to Mono Mac 6 cells and prevented binding of fluorescently labeled E. coli LPS to transfected CHO cells expressing CD14. In addition, native PAGE assays showed thatRhizobium Sin-1 LPS significantly reduced the binding of tritiated E. coli LPS to purified CD14. It was next shown, using immobilized LBP, that Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS binds more tightly to LBP than E. coli LPS. These findings suggest thatRhizobium Sin-1 LPS may reduce the availability and delivery of E. coli LPS monomers to CD14 on mononuclear cells, as well as prevent the binding of E. coli LPS to CD14, thereby accounting for the reduction in E. coli LPS-induced synthesis of TNFα. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that structurally unique LPS from rhizobial bacteria caused either no measurable, or only slight, induction of TNFα in human monocytic cells and that LPS from one of these rhizobial species, Rhizobium Sin-1, antagonizes the effects of E. coli LPS through at least two probable mechanisms. Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS avidly competes withE. coli LPS for binding to LBP, which is intimately involved in delivering LPS monomers to CD14 on the cell surface. Furthermore,Rhizobium Sin-1 LPS competes with E. coli LPS for binding sites on human monocytic cells and CHO cells expressing CD14. Pharmacologic analysis of the concentrations of E. coli LPS required to induce TNFα synthesis in the presence ofRhizobium Sin-1 LPS indicate that Rhizobium Sin-1 is an effective competitive inhibitor of E. coli LPS. In the companion paper (39Jeyaretnam B.S. Glushka V.S. Kolli K. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41802-41810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it is shown that the RhizobiumSin-1 LPS used in this work contains eight or more different lipid-A structures (Fig. 6). These structures vary from one another in their fatty acylation pattern and as to whether or not the proximal glycosyl residue exists as 2-aminogluconate or as 2-aminoglucono-1,5-lactone. Given the multiple dissimilarities between the rhizobial and enteric bacterial lipid-A structures, it is not possible to determine which specific structural feature(s) of the rhizobial LPS is/are most responsible for the results obtained in the present study. Therefore, studies with pure synthetic lipid-A analogs (synthesized by Dr. Geert-Jan Boons of the Complex Carbohydrate Research Center) are in progress to clearly define the structure/function relationship with regard to endotoxin antagonistic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1999912948,"Sperm are terminally differentiated cells that undergo several membrane-altering events before fusion with eggs. One event, the sea urchin sperm acrosome reaction (AR), is blocked by the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). In an effort to identify proteins involved in the AR induction, the peptide sequence was obtained from a 220-kDa WGA-binding protein. Degenerate PCR and library screening resulted in the full-length deduced amino acid sequence of an ATP-binding cassette transporter, suABCA. The protein of 1,764 residues has two transmembrane regions, two nucleotide-binding domains, and is most closely related to the human ABC subfamily A member 3 transporter (ABCA3). Sequence analysis suggests a large extracellular loop between transmembrane spanning segments 7 and 8, with fiveN-linked glycosylation sites. An antibody made to the loop region binds to non-permeabilized cells, supporting that this region is extracellular. suABCA is found in sperm membrane vesicles, it can be solubilized with nonionic detergents, and it shifts from 220 to 200 kDa upon protein:N-glycanase F digestion. suABCA localizes to the entire surface of sperm in a punctate pattern, but is not detected in lipid rafts. Based on its relationship to subfamily A, suABCA is most likely involved in phospholipid or cholesterol transport. This is the first investigation of an ABC transporter in animal sperm.

Based on its relationship to subfamily A, suABCA is most likely involved in phospholipid or cholesterol transport. This is the first investigation of an ABC transporter in animal sperm. As spermatocytes mature, their shape is altered from round, undifferentiated spermatocytes to long, thin, highly compartmentalized, terminally differentiated cells. Most sperm consist of a head containing an acrosomal vesicle and a nucleus, a midpiece containing mitochondria, and a long flagellum. Upon release into seawater, sea urchin sperm activate motility and, before fusing with eggs, undergo the exocytotic acrosome reaction (AR). 1The abbreviations used are: AR, acrosome reaction; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; ABCA, ABC subfamily A; ABCe, bacterially expressed protein; FSW, filtered seawater; HDL, high density lipoprotein; TMS, transmembrane segment(s); WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; SMV, sperm membrane vesicle; PNGase F, protein:N-glycanase F; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. In mammals, this process is further complicated by the need to undergo capacitation before the AR can be triggered. Capacitation is a poorly understood process involving cholesterol efflux, changes in intracellular ion concentrations, and tyrosine phosphorylation (1Visconti P.E. Westbrook V.A. Chertihin O. Demarco I. Sleight S. Diekman A.B. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2002; 53: 133-150Google Scholar). All of these processes involve changes in membrane structure and composition (2Bearer E.L. Friend D.S. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1990; 16: 281-297Google Scholar), and the molecules involved in these changes are only now being discovered. One of the best studied membrane-altering events in fertilization is the sea urchin sperm AR. When sperm contact a fucose sulfate polymer contained in the jelly layer surrounding the egg, multiple fusions occur between the acrosomal vesicle and the plasma membrane of sperm resulting in exocytosis of the vesicle (3Vacquier V.D. Moy G.W. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 125-135Google Scholar). A newly exposed membrane, covering the actin-containing acrosomal process, then fuses with the egg plasma membrane (4Mengerink K.J. Vacquier V.D. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 37R-43RGoogle Scholar). Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) blocks the egg jelly-induced AR of sea urchin sperm (5Podell S.B. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1598-1604Google Scholar). One WGA-binding protein, suREJ1, has been demonstrated to be involved in triggering the AR (6Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Google Scholar), and another, suREJ3, has been implicated in this process (7Mengerink K.J. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 943-948Google Scholar). This paper identifies another major WGA-binding protein of sea urchin sperm as an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, most closely related to human ABCA3. ABC transporters make up one of the largest families of transmembrane proteins and have been identified in every organism. These proteins use ATP to drive the transport of a wide variety of substances across the membrane including phospholipids, amino acids, peptides, toxins, metals, and antibiotics. The functional unit contains two distinct transmembrane regions, each with five to eight transmembrane spanning segments (TMS), and two distinct nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). In bacteria, each domain is a separate polypeptide, whereas in eukaryotes a single polypeptide chain can contain a half-transporter (one transmembrane region and one NBD) or a full transporter with two transmembrane regions and two NBDs (8Croop J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 101-116Google Scholar, 9Klein I. Sarkadi B. Varadi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 237-262Google Scholar). Forty-eight human ABC transporters are divided into seven distinct families based on sequence similarity. Human subfamily A contains 12 members, which can be further subdivided into two distinct groups (10Dean M. Hamon Y. Chimini G. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1007-1017Google Scholar). The first group in subfamily A has seven members, all of which are implicated in phospholipid and cholesterol transport. Here we identify a sea urchin ABC transporter belonging to the subfamily A. This is the first description of an ABC transporter in animal sperm. All procedures were on ice or at 4 °C. Sea urchins, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, were spawned by injection with 0.5 m KCl and the undiluted sperm collected with a Pasteur pipette. Sperm were resuspended in 0.45-μm filtered seawater (FSW), coelomocytes were removed by three (5 min) centrifugations at 200 × gand sperm cells sedimented at 5,000 × g (15 min). Sperm membranes were solubilized by suspending sperm pellets in 0.15m NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1% Nonidet P-40. Solubilized protein was obtained from the supernatant after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. This supernatant was applied to a WGA-agarose column (EY Laboratories). The column was washed with 50 column volumes of wash buffer (0.15m NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4) and the protein eluted in wash buffer containing 100 mm N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. SDS-PAGE was performed (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and the gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The 220-kDa band was cut excised from the gel, destained, and sent to the Stanford University PAN Facility for trypsin digestion and peptide sequencing. Degenerate primers were designed according to peptides 1 and 3 and used to amplify a message from cDNA from an entire sea urchin. Specific primers were made to this message and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Ambion) with testis mRNA was performed to obtain most of the 3′ end of the sequence. This product was used to screen a testis λ ZAP II library (Stratagene). Overlapping clones were obtained and sequenced. suABCA homologs were identified using BLAST (12Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar). Specific domains and glycosylation sites were found using the ProfileScan website (www.isrec.isb-sib.ch/software/PFSCAN_form.html) and the PredictProtein website (dodo.cpmc.columbia.edu/predictprotein/predictprotein.html). The signal sequence was predicted using the SignalP website (13Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Google Scholar). TMS were predicted using hydropathy plots that were generated by the method of Kyte and Doolittle with a window of 14 amino acids (14Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Google Scholar), as well as the TMHMM website (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0/html; Ref. 15Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments were made using Clustal W, Clustal X, and GeneDoc (16Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Google Scholar, 17Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Google Scholar, 18Nicholas K.B. Nicholas Jr., H.B. Deerfield II, D.W. EMBNEW News. 1997; 4: 14Google Scholar). Neighbor joining trees with bootstrap values (1,000 replicas) were made using Clustal X and viewed using TreeView (19Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358Google Scholar). A portion of suABCA DNA corresponding to Ala961–Pro1158 was ligated into the pET15b vector (Novagen), which contains an NH2-terminal His tag, and bacterially expressed according to a previously published protocol (7Mengerink K.J. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 943-948Google Scholar). The resulting purified recombinant protein, ABCe, was separated by SDS-PAGE and negatively stained with cupric chloride (20Lee C. Levin A. Branton D. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 308-312Google Scholar). The protein was excised, destained, and used to make commercially raised anti-ABCe rabbit antibodies (Strategic BioSolutions). The antibodies were subsequently affinity purified on an ABCe-conjugated Affi-Gel-15 column (Bio-Rad). Sperm membrane vesicles (SMVs) were made according to the pH 9 method (21Vacquier V.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1986; 27: 15-40Google Scholar, 33Podell S.B. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 778: 25-37Google Scholar). For protein:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) treatment of sperm protein, 40 μg of WGA eluate containing 0.5% SDS and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol was boiled 5 min. Nonidet P-40 was added to 7.5%, followed by 2.4 μl of PNGase F and 27.6 μl of distilled water. The sample was incubated overnight at 37 °C. Following deglycosylation, the sample was separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF, and Western blots performed using ABCe antibody. Lipid rafts were made following a previously described protocol (22Ohta K. Sato C. Matsuda T. Toriyama M. Lennarz W.J. Kitajima K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 616-623Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 μl of dry sperm were solubilized with 1 ml of 1% Triton X-100 in solubilization buffer (SB; 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA), incubated on ice for 20 min, and homogenized with 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. The cell debris was removed by a 5 min, 1,300 × gcentrifugation. The supernatant was mixed with equal volume of 85% (w/v) sucrose in SB. Two milliliters of the resulting supernatant were layered successively with 6 ml 30% sucrose in SB and 3.5 ml 5% sucrose in SB. The lipid rafts were obtained by ultracentrifugation at 200,000 × g at 4 °C for 18 h, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, and gels were stained with silver (23Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Google Scholar), Coomassie Brilliant Blue, or transferred to PVDF for immunoblotting. Transfer to PVDF was in 20% methanol:80% water with 192 mm glycine and 25 mm Tris-OH at pH 8.3. Blots were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated 1 h with a 1:20,000 dilution of primary antibody. After washing in 150 mm NaCl, the membranes were reacted 1 h with a 1:50,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (Calbiochem). Membranes were developed the SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate kit (Pierce). Freshly spawned sperm were diluted 1:100 and incubated 10 min in FSW containing 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde. Fixed cells were washed three times for 10 min with PBS, pH 7.4. For washing, cells were sedimented by a 5 min centrifugation at 1,000 × g and resuspended in PBS. Permeabilized sperm were incubated 10 min in PBS containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and then washed three times. Nonspecific sites were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min and then incubated for 1 h with primary antibody in blocking solution. This was followed by three 10-min washes in PBS, a 1-h incubation in Alexafluor 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes), and three additional washes before viewing by epifluorescence. Control cells, treated with only the second antibody, had absolutely no fluorescence. Several high molecular weight proteins are enriched in WGA eluates of solubilized sperm protein when compared with the starting material, including suREJ1 and suREJ3 (6Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Google Scholar, 7Mengerink K.J. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 943-948Google Scholar). The 220-kDa band is enriched in the eluate and can also be detected in the starting material (Fig.1). To purify this protein, a WGA-eluate was separated by SDS-PAGE and the gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The 220-kDa protein was excised and trypsin digestion and peptide sequencing performed. Three peptide sequences were obtained (Fig.2). Peptides 1 and 3 were used to design degenerate primers and the primers used to amplify a partial sequence from cDNA. The initial PCR product was then used to obtain the full-length sequence by a combination of screening a testis cDNA library and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends with testis cDNA. Using BLAST to search GenBankTM identified this protein as a new member of the ABC transporter superfamily, named suABCA.Figure 2The deduced amino acid sequence of suABCA.

SignalP predicts a signal sequence from Met 1The abbreviations used are: AR, acrosome reaction; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; ABCA, ABC subfamily A; ABCe, bacterially expressed protein; FSW, filtered seawater; HDL, high density lipoprotein; TMS, transmembrane segment(s); WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; SMV, sperm membrane vesicle; PNGase F, protein:N-glycanase F; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. to Arg44. All three peptides were found in the deduced suABCA amino acid sequence. The NBDs of suABCA contain the subfamily A signature sequences, including the Walker A motif, the #50 sequence, the “hot spot,” the ATS/C region, the Walker B motif, and the Switch #162 sequence (Fig. 3 A; Refs. 24Schmitz G. Langmann T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 129-140Google Scholarand 25Broccardo C. Luciani M.-F. Chimini G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 395-404Google Scholar). Within all of these regions, the two homologous domains of suABCA vary by only three amino acids. Also, suABCA is conserved in the additional ABCA regions 100–130 amino acids downstream of the Walker B motif, varying by only two amino acids. A Kyte-Doolittle plot (Fig. 3 B) indicates that suABCA has 12 predicted TMS, with the first TMS located within the putative signal sequence. The TMS are also predicted by TMHMM (15Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Google Scholar). Between TMS 1–2 and TMS 7–8 are large, putative extracellular loops of 158 and 242 residues, respectively. The first loop contains three potentialN-linked glycosylation sites, and five are predicted in the second loop (Fig. 3 D). Two of the peptide sequences are found in the second loop and each includes an N-linked glycosylation site. In both cases, the asparagine could not be determined by Edman degradation, most likely due to possession of oligosaccharide chains. The human ABC transporter subfamily A is divided into two groups based on phylogeny (10Dean M. Hamon Y. Chimini G. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1007-1017Google Scholar). Human ABCA1, -2, -3, -4, -7, and -12 fall into one group. Multiple sequence alignments of suABCA to this group show the sea urchin transporter to be most similar to member 3 (Fig. 3 C). Also, suABCA is similar in size to human ABCA3 (1,764 compared with 1,704 amino acids) and, like human ABCA3, contains a shorter extracellular loop between TMS 1 and 2 in comparison to the other members of this group. In summary, suABCA has a large glycosylated extracellular loop in the first transmembrane region and a second larger glycosylated loop in the second transmembrane region. Six TMS are predicted in each transmembrane region; however, TMS1 may be cleaved after the signal sequence (Fig. 2). Anti-ABCe antibody reacts with a band at the expected size of 220 kDa in an Nonidet P-40 extract of whole sperm (Fig. 4 A). The antigen is enriched in sperm membrane vesicles and is not present in the supernatant of the vesicle preparation. A second band, appearing in the SMV sample, is most likely a breakdown product. suABCA is highly enriched in the WGA eluate. Lanes N, V, andS contain 10 μg of protein, while lane Wcontains 0.5 μg of protein. The density of the band in lane W is similar to that of the SMV preparation, indicating that the WGA eluate provides approximately a 20-fold enrichment of the suABCA transporter. Based on amino acid sequence alone, suABCA should be ∼195 kDa. Treatment of WGA-binding proteins with PNGase F, followed by anti-ABCe immunoblotting, demonstrates that suABCA shifts in relative mass from 220 to 200 kDa (Fig. 4 B), confirmingN-linked glycosylation. Immunofluorescence using the anti-ABCe antibody localizes the antigen to the entire surface of sperm in a punctate pattern (Fig.5 A). This pattern and level of fluorescence was seen in both nonpermeabilized and permeabilized cells and was not altered by time of fixation. Also, decreasing the concentration of antibody resulted in the same punctate pattern with lower levels of fluorescence. Cells reacted with only the secondary antibody had absolutely no fluorescence. Because of the punctate pattern and possible role of suABCA in phospholipid or cholesterol transport, lipid rafts were isolated and tested for the presence of suABCA (Fig. 5 B). A sucrose cushion was floated on top of the detergent-extracted supernatant and the sample ultracentrifuged. This resulted in a lipid-dense band in fraction 4, which has been characterized previously as the glycosphingolipid-rich raft fraction (22Ohta K. Sato C. Matsuda T. Toriyama M. Lennarz W.J. Kitajima K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 616-623Google Scholar). Fractions taken from top to bottom show that suABCA is mostly solubilized by detergent and is not detected in the lipid raft fraction. WGA blocks the egg jelly-induced AR of sea urchin sperm (5Podell S.B. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1598-1604Google Scholar), and there are ∼10 major WGA-binding proteins visible on a silver-stained gel. One or more of these proteins must play a role in AR induction. suREJ1 was the first WGA-binding protein shown to be a receptor for the egg jelly fucose sulfate polymer, a known AR inducer (3Vacquier V.D. Moy G.W. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 125-135Google Scholar, 6Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Google Scholar). Also, the NH2- and COOH-terminal halves of suREJ3 bind WGA and are implicated in the AR, due to their location on the plasma membrane covering the acrosomal vesicle (7Mengerink K.J. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 943-948Google Scholar). The 220-kDa (previously reported as 190 kDa; Refs. 21Vacquier V.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1986; 27: 15-40Google Scholar and 33Podell S.B. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 778: 25-37Google Scholar) WGA-binding protein was shown to be an ABC transporter belonging to the human subfamily A transporters. Twelve members of this subfamily have been identified from human, which are all full transporters with two transmembrane regions and two NBDs (25Broccardo C. Luciani M.-F. Chimini G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 395-404Google Scholar). Available data show that the members of subfamily A are involved in cholesterol or phospholipid transport (10Dean M. Hamon Y. Chimini G. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1007-1017Google Scholar). Members of subfamily A that cluster with suABCA include ABCA1, -2, -3, -4, -7, and -12. suABCA is most similar to human ABCA3 (Fig. 3 C). ABCA3 is found associated with the lamellar bodies of lung alveolar type II cells and is thought to play a role in phospholipid transport during surfactant production (26Mulugeta S. Gray J.M. Notarfrancesco K.L. Gonzales L.W. Koval M. Feinstein S.I. Ballard P.L. Fisher A.B. Shuman H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22147-22155Google Scholar, 27Yamano G. Funahashi H. Kawanami O. Zhao L.X. Ban N. Uchida Y. Morohoshi T. Ogawa J. Shioda S. Inagaki N. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 221-225Google Scholar). The best studied member of this subfamily is ABCA1, mutations in which cause the autosomal recessive disorder Tangier disease. Patients with Tangier disease have virtually no plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL), they accumulate cholesterol in macrophages, and they have a high incidence of atherosclerosis (28Lin G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 727-731Google Scholar, 29Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1173-1179Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence shows ABCA1 transports cholesterol and phospholipids to lipid-poor apolipoproteins, such as HDL (28Lin G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 727-731Google Scholar, 29Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1173-1179Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that suABCA has a similar lipid-transporting function. Transmission electron micrographs of filipin-cholesterol complexes show that during capacitation, cholesterol increases over the guinea pig acrosomal vesicle (2Bearer E.L. Friend D.S. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1990; 16: 281-297Google Scholar). During capacitation, mammalian sperm lose cholesterol from their membranes. Bovine serum albumin, cyclodextrins, and HDL are all capable of binding cholesterol and increasing the rate of capacitation (1Visconti P.E. Westbrook V.A. Chertihin O. Demarco I. Sleight S. Diekman A.B. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2002; 53: 133-150Google Scholar). In mammalian sperm, no mechanism has been described for cholesterol removal from membranes. An ABCA transporter would be an ideal protein to perform such a task. However, sea urchin sperm no not appear to have a capacitation-like process and are capable of acrosome reacting immediately upon release into seawater. Anti-ABCe was made against the region between TMS 7 and 8. This region is thought to be a regulatory region in ABCA1 (25Broccardo C. Luciani M.-F. Chimini G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 395-404Google Scholar), and several models have been proposed describing the topology of this region in subfamily A members (24Schmitz G. Langmann T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 129-140Google Scholar, 30Bungert S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23539-23546Google Scholar). With ABCA1, data support a model for an intracellular location with the hydrophobic region (TMS 7) sticking into the membrane but not passing through it (24Schmitz G. Langmann T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 129-140Google Scholar). In ABCA4, evidence indicates that the region corresponding to TMS 7 passes through the membrane so that the region between TMS 7 and 8 is extracellular. Like ABCA4, our data support an extracellular location of this region. Twenty kDa of the relative molecular mass of suABCA can be accounted for by N-linked glycosylation, and five N-linked sites are predicted in this region. Two sites are present in the sequenced peptides, and asparagine residues could not be identified via Edman degradation, indicating that they are glycosylated. Also the anti-ABCe antibody made against this putative extracellular region binds non-permeabilized cells, and the level of binding does not change after permeabilization. Because this region may be a regulatory in some ABCA members (25Broccardo C. Luciani M.-F. Chimini G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 395-404Google Scholar), anti-ABCe was dialyzed into FSW and applied to live sperm. No differences could be detected in swimming behavior, cell agglutination, or acrosome reactions (data not shown). suABCA has a distinct punctate pattern of immunofluorescence. To test the possibility that suABCA was present in specific membrane microdomains, anti-ABCe immunoblots were performed on isolated lipid rafts. Rafts have previously been isolated from sea urchin sperm and shown to be enriched in glycosphingolipids but not cholesterol (22Ohta K. Sato C. Matsuda T. Toriyama M. Lennarz W.J. Kitajima K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 616-623Google Scholar). Several sea urchin membrane proteins such as the speract receptor, suREJ1, adenylate cyclase, and guanylate cyclase have been detected in the raft fraction but suABCA is not (31Ohta K. Sato C. Matsuda T. Toriyama M. Vacquier V.D. Lennarz W.J. Kitajima K. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 205-214Google Scholar). Likewise, human ABCA1 does not associate with sphingomyelin/cholesterol-rich lipid rafts (32Mendez A.J. Lin G. Wade D.P. Lawn R.M. Oram J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3158-3166Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence of testis homogenates shows that the protein is present in a similar pattern on all immature spermatogenic cells (data not shown). A potential role for suABCA could be involved in the early stages of membrane structuring to create the terminally differentiated mature spermatozoa. Although many proteins and carbohydrates have been identified as important players in sperm-egg interactions (4Mengerink K.J. Vacquier V.D. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 37R-43RGoogle Scholar), the membrane alterations during fertilization are poorly understood. One interesting question raised by this work is why suABCA is such an abundant membrane protein present on the entire surface of the sperm. Sperm might alter their membranes during spermatogenesis, motility, the acrosome reaction, and ultimately sperm-egg fusion. This research has implications beyond sperm physiology. Membrane vesicles can be isolated from sperm as right-side-out vesicles by the pH 9 method (33Podell S.B. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 778: 25-37Google Scholar) or as a mixture of right-side-out and inside-out vesicles by nitrogen cavitation (34Ward G.E. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 95-101Google Scholar). suABCA remains tightly associated with SMVs. SMV preparations can be combined with methods such as WGA chromatography or affinity chromatography to enrich for suABCA-containing lipid vesicles. The abundance of suABCA may offer an excellent opportunity to study the biochemical properties of these transporters in their native environment. We thank Yi-Hsien Su and Brian J. Hillier for providing testis RNA and whole sea urchin cDNA and Anna T. Neill for reviewing the manuscript."

Photolabeling of these peptides was most effectively prevented by the presence of NAD+ during photolysis, demonstrating a selectivity of the photoprobe for the NAD+ binding site. Amino acid sequencing and compositional analysis identified Glu279 as the site of photoinsertion into human GDH, suggesting that Glu279 is located at or near the NAD+ binding site. The importance of the Glu279 residue in the binding of NAD+ was further examined by cassette mutagenesis with mutant enzymes containing Arg, Gly, Leu, Met, or Tyr at position 279. The mutagenesis at Glu279 has no effects on the expression or stability of the different mutants. The K mvalues for NAD+ were 10–14-fold greater for the mutant GDHs than for wild-type GDH, whereas the V maxvalues were similar for wild-type and mutant GDHs. The efficiency (k cat/K m) of the mutant GDH was reduced up to 18-fold. The decreased efficiency of the mutants results from the increase in K m values for NAD+.

Austen B.M. Blumenthal K.M. Nyc J.F. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. XI. Academic Press, New York1975: 293-367Google Scholar). There are three types of GDH that vary according to the coenzyme they use: NAD(H)-specific GDH, NADP(H)-specific GDH, and GDH with mixed specificity. The bacterial and fungal NADP+-linked and vertebrate dual specificity GDHs have six identical subunits, with a subunit size between 48 kDa (Escherichia coli) (2McPherson M.J. Wootton J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 5257-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and 55–57 kDa (vertebrate) (1Smith E.L. Austen B.M. Blumenthal K.M. Nyc J.F. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. XI.

Chem. 1974; 249: 7922-7928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or six identical subunits with a subunit size of ∼48 kDa (Clostridium symbiosum) (5Rice D.W. Hornby D.P. Engel P.C. J. Mol.

NAD(H)-specific enzymes are believed to participate mainly in the catabolism of glutamate, but NADP(H)-specific enzymes have a mainly anabolic role. Unlike GDH from primitive organisms, mammalian GDH uses both forms of coenzyme with comparable efficacy, and the anabolic/catabolic balance is therefore tightly controlled by a complex network of allosteric regulators.

Biol. 1985; 181: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been suggested that the antenna domain that is unique to mammalian GDH has important roles in allosteric regulation (10Peterson P.E. Smith T.J.

For instance, ADP is generally considered as an activator of mammalian GDH (11Smith T.J. Peterson P.E. Schmidt T. Fang J. Stanley C.A. J. Mol.

The most recent study shows that GTP binds to GDH from E. coli at an allosteric site and reverses the destabilizing effects of the coenzyme (20Maurizi M.R. Rasulova F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 206-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This result strongly suggests that the unique 48-amino acid antenna region in mammalian GDH may not be wholly responsible for the observed regulation of ADP and GTP. It has been a major goal to identify the substrate and regulatory binding sites of GDH. Identification of the nucleotide binding sites of a variety of proteins has been advanced by the use of nucleotide photoaffinity analogues that selectively insert into a site upon photoactivation with ultraviolet light. For instance, [32P]2N3NAD+ was shown to be a valid active-site probe for several proteins (21Kim H. Haley B. Bioconjugate Chem. 1991; 2: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Cho S.-W.

Recent studies of the x-ray structure of bovine liver GDH indicate that Glu275 (Glu279in human enzyme) forms a hydrogen bond with the coenzyme (10Peterson P.E. Smith T.J.

Studies of the effects of site-directed mutagenesis at the Glu279 site on the affinity and kinetics of coenzyme binding are necessary to obtain such information. Recently, a 1557-bp gene that encodes human GDH has been synthesized and expressed in E. coli in our laboratory (31Cho S.-W. Yoon H.-Y. Ahn J.-Y. Lee E.-Y. Lee J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3205-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Using this synthetic human GDH gene, reactive amino acid residues for catalysis (31Cho S.-W. Yoon H.-Y. Ahn J.-Y. Lee E.-Y.

In the present work, we report identification of an NAD+ binding site of human GDH by a combination of cassette mutagenesis and photolabeling. For the present study, the mutant human GDHs containing Gly, Leu, Met, Arg, or Tyr at the Glu279 site have been expressed in E. colias a soluble protein and characterized. Our data place the NAD+ binding domain within a proposed catalytic cleft defined in the crystal structure of GDH (10Peterson P.E. Smith T.J.

To our knowledge, this is the first report by site-directed mutagenesis showing an involvement of Glu279 of mammalian GDH in NAD+ binding. NADH, NAD+, 2-oxoglutarate, ADP, andl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin were purchased from Sigma. Human GDH gene (pHGDH) has been chemically synthesized and expressed in E. coli as a soluble protein in our laboratory as described elsewhere (31Cho S.-W. Yoon H.-Y. Ahn J.-Y. Lee E.-Y. Lee J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3205-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 2N3NAD+ and [32P]2N3NAD+ were synthesized using NMN adenylyltransferase according to the same method described previously (21Kim H. Haley B. Bioconjugate Chem. 1991; 2: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). NMN adenylyltransferase was kindly provided by Dr. Mathias Ziegler (Institut für Biochemie, Freie Universität Berlin). Precast gels for SDS-PAGE were purchased from Novex. All other chemicals and solvents were of reagent grade or better. E. coli DH5α (36Hanahan D. J. Mol.

Berlyn,E. coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale University) lacked both GDH and glutamate synthase activities (37Teller J. Smith R.J. McPherson M.J. Engel P.C. Guest J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and was used to test plasmids for GDH activity. E. coli BL21 (DE3) (38Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4811) Google Scholar) was used for high-level expression of recombinant human GDH. Photolabeling of wild-type human GDH was performed by the method of Kim and Haley (21Kim H. Haley B. Bioconjugate Chem. 1991; 2: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), with a slight modification. For saturation studies, wild-type GDH (100 μg) in 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, containing 12 mmglutarate was incubated with various concentrations of [32P]2N3NAD+ in Eppendorf tubes for 5 min. Glutarate was included in the reaction mixture because it has been reported by equilibrium dialysis and initial rates that glutarate makes NAD+ bind to GDH more tightly (39Frieden C. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3286-3299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Dalziel K. Egan R.R. Biochem. J. 1972; 126: 975-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 41Dalziel K. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. XI. Academic Press, New York1975: 1-60Google Scholar). For competition studies, 100 μg of enzyme was incubated with various concentrations of NAD+ for 10 min in the same buffer before the addition of 100 μm[32P]2N3NAD+ and then incubated with the photoprobe for 5 min as described above. The samples were irradiated twice with a hand-held 254 nm UV lamp for 90 s at 4 °C. The reaction was quenched by the addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 7%). The reaction mixtures were kept on the ice bath for 30 min and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed and resuspended with 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0. The remaining free photoprobe, if any, was further removed from the protein by exhaustive washing using Centrifree (Amicon), and 32P incorporation into protein was determined by liquid scintillation counting. To determine the site modified by [32P]2N3NAD+, 2.0 mg of wild-type GDH in 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, was incubated with 100 μm [32P]2N3NAD+ in the presence of 1 mm GTP, 12 mm glutarate, and 10 μm EDTA for 5 min at 4 °C. The mixtures were irradiated twice for 90 s. The reaction was quenched by the addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 7%) and kept at 4 °C for 30 min. The protein was precipitated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 75 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8.5, containing 2 murea. The enzymes were proteolyzed by the addition of 15 μg of trypsin and kept at room temperature for 3 h, after which time 15 μg of trypsin was added again. After an additional 3 h at room temperature, 20 μg of trypsin was added, and the digestion mixture was kept at 25 °C overnight. To validate that the isolated peptide was specific for the NAD+ binding site and could be protected from photomodification, the GDH proteins were photolysed in the presence of 300 μm NAD+ and proteolyzed as described above. The tryptic digested peptides were applied to a boronate column equilibrated with 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 9.0. Unmodified peptides were washed with the same buffer, and photolabeled peptides were eluted with an 80-ml gradient of pH 9.0 to pH 5.0 in 0.1 m ammonium acetate. The absorbance of the fractions was measured at 220 nm, and the photoincorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The fractions containing photolabeled peptides were desalted, freeze-dried, resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, isolated by reversed-phase HPLC using a Waters C18 column, and sequenced by the Edman degradation method described previously (28Cho S.-W. Yoon H.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13948-13953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cassette mutagenesis at the Glu279 site was performed using a synthetic human GDH gene, pHGDH (31Cho S.-W. Yoon H.-Y. Ahn J.-Y. Lee E.-Y. Lee J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3205-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The plasmid DNA (5 μg) was digested with NsiI and EspDI to remove the 46-bp fragment that encodes amino acids 275–290, which was replaced with five 46-bp synthetic DNA duplexes containing a substitution on both DNA strands at positions encoding Glu279 to make E279G, E279L, E279M, E279R, and E279Y mutants. Glu279 mutants were identified by DNA sequencing using plasmid DNA as a template. Each of these mutants has been expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity as described below and has had its steady-state kinetic parameters determined. The gene expression level of Glu279 mutant proteins in the crude extracts was examined by Western blot and compared with that of wild-type GDH. Fresh overnight cultures of DE3/pHGDH were used to inoculate 1 liter of LB containing 100 μg ampicillin/ml. DE3/pHGDH was grown at 37 °C until A 600 reached 1.0, and then isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, DE3/pHGDH was grown for an additional 3 h at 37 °C and then harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were suspended in 100 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol and lysed with a sonicator. The wild-type and mutant GDHs were purified according to the method developed in our laboratory (3Cho S.-W. Lee J. Choi S.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 31Cho S.-W. Yoon H.-Y. Ahn J.-Y. Lee E.-Y. Lee J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3205-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Because the wild-type and mutant GDHs were readily solubilized, no detergents were required throughout the entire purification steps. The purified enzymes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and recognized by Western blot using monoclonal antibodies previously produced in our laboratory against bovine brain GDH (42Choi S.Y. Hong J.W. Song M.-S. Jeon S.G. Bahn J.H. Lee B.Y. Ahn J.-Y. Cho S.-W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2162-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (43Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) using bovine GDH as a standard. Because E. colihas only an NADP+-dependent GDH (36Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8146) Google Scholar), the enzyme assay was performed with NAD+ in the direction of glutamate oxidation in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, containing 14 mm NAD+, 2.6 mm EDTA, and 1 mm ADP at 25 °C. The reaction was started by the addition of glutamate to 25 mm final concentration. One unit of enzyme was defined as the amount of enzyme required to reduce 1 μmol NAD+/min at 25 °C. For determination ofK m and V max values, the assays were carried out by varying the substrate under investigation while keeping the other substrate and reagents at the optimal concentration indicated above. The K m andV max values were calculated by linear regression analysis of double-reciprocal plots and given along with standard errors. Catalytic efficiency was estimated by use of the equationv/[E 0] = (k cat/K m)[S] (44Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman, New York1985: 98-120Google Scholar). Effects of allosteric regulators on GDH activities were examined by incubating the enzyme with the allosteric effectors at various concentrations in the assay buffer at 25 °C. At intervals after the initiation with the effectors, aliquots were withdrawn for the assay of GDH activity. The role of Glu279 in the direct binding of NAD+ to human GDH was examined by photoaffinity labeling with [32P]2N3NAD+. To show specificity of the photoprobe-protein interaction, saturation of photoinsertion should be observed. To demonstrate saturation effects with the photoprobe, the purified enzymes were photolabeled with increasing concentrations of [32P]2N3NAD+ in the presence of glutarate. Under the experimental conditions described, saturation of photoinsertion with [32P]2N3NAD+occurred at around 95 μm photoprobe (Fig.1). In all photolabeling experiments, the ionic strength was kept low to enhance binding affinity because we have observed in general that the lower the ionic strength, the tighter the binding of nucleotide photoaffinity probes and the more efficient the photoinsertion. The results in Fig. 1 indicate the saturability of the NAD+-specific site of GDH with this photoprobe and therefore decrease the possibility of nonspecific photoinsertion. To further demonstrate specific labeling of GDH, wild-type GDH was photolabeled with [32P]2N3NAD+ in the presence of increasing NAD+ concentrations. As shown in the results of the competition experiments (Fig.2), NAD+ was able to protect photolabeling from 10 μm[32P]2N3NAD+ at concentrations in the range of known K d values (41Dalziel K. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. XI. Academic Press, New York1975: 1-60Google Scholar). Approximately 85% protection was observed with 150 μm NAD+for wild-type GDH (Fig. 2). These results show the specificity and utility of [32P]2N3NAD+ as a good probe for determining the NAD+ binding site.Figure 2The effect of NAD+ on [32P]2N3NAD+ phosphoincorporation into GDH. Wild-type GDH in reaction buffer was photolysed with 100 μm [32P]2N3NAD+ in the presence of the indicated concentrations of NAD+. Relative 32P incorporation into protein was determined and expressed as described in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To identify the peptides modified by [32P]2N3NAD+, wild-type GDH was photolabeled twice in the absence and presence of 300 μmNAD+ and digested with trypsin. To reduce any possible nonspecific labeling and, at the same time, optimize the specific labeling of the enzymes, 100 μm[32P]2N3NAD+ was used, which is the concentration at which photoinsertion approaches saturation. The photolabeled proteins were separated from most of the noncovalently bound nucleotide by acid precipitation and proteolyzed by trypsin. Taking advantage of the existence of the two cis-hydroxyl groups on the ribose groups of the photoincorporated probe, the photolabeled peptides were isolated by using immobilized boronate column chromatography. It has been shown that immobilized boronate can be successfully used to fractionate adenine and pyridine nucleotides (21Kim H. Haley B. Bioconjugate Chem. 1991; 2: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 45Gonzalez R.A. Salinas E.L. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 135: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and nucleosidyl peptides (46Bailey J.M. Colman R.F. J. Biol.

The tryptic digested GDHs were applied to the boronate column equilibrated with 0.1 mammonium acetate, pH 9.0. After washing the column with ammonium acetate buffer, pH 9.0, the radioactive peptides were eluted with a pH gradient of 9.0 to 5.0 (Fig. 3). One major radioactive peak around pH 6.5 was observed for wild-type GDH. The peptides exhibited an unusual UV spectrum with a maximum absorption of 262 nm and a shoulder near 278 nm, which verifies that an adduct of the [32P]2N3NAD+ photoprobe is still covalently attached to the peptides. Photolabeling of the peptide was prevented by the presence of NAD+ during photolysis. When 300 μm NAD+ was originally present in the incubation mixture, ∼ 90% of the radioactivity of the peak was eliminated, as shown in Fig. 3. These results demonstrate the selectivity of the photoprobe and suggest that the radioactive peak represents a peptide in the NAD"

The reactivity of the catalytic disulfide bond (Cys30-Pro31-His32-Cys33) is primarily due to an extremely low pKa value (3.4) of Cys30, which is stabilized by the partial positive dipole charge of the active-site helix α1 (residues 30–37). We have randomized all non-cysteine residues of helix α1 (residues 31, 32, and 34–37) and found that two-thirds of the resulting variants complement DsbA deficiency in a dsbA deletion strain. Sequencing of 98 variants revealed a large number of non-conservative replacements in active variants, even at well conserved positions. This indicates that tertiary structure context strongly determines α-helical secondary structure formation of the randomized sequence. A subset of active and inactive variants was further characterized. All these variants were more reducing than wild type DsbA, but the redox potentials of active variants did not drop below −210 mV. All inactive variants had redox potentials lower than −210 mV, although some of the inactive proteins were still re-oxidized by DsbB. This demonstrates that efficient oxidation of substrate polypeptides is the crucial property of DsbA in vivo.

The enzyme contains a catalytic disulfide bridge, which is located at the N terminus of the active-site helix α1 with the sequence Cys30-Pro31-His32-Cys33-Tyr34-Gln35-Phe36-Glu37. DsbA-mediated disulfide bond formation in the periplasm involves oxidation of reduced, newly translocated substrate polypeptides by DsbA, followed by reoxidation of DsbA by the inner membrane protein DsbB.

The enzyme possesses a thioredoxin fold, which is common to most thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases and contains the active-site disulfide (8Martin J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). In addition to the thioredoxin domain, DsbA possesses a second, purely α-helical domain, which is inserted into the thioredoxin domain (5Martin J.L. Bardwell J.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1993; 365: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The structural differences between oxidized and reduced DsbA are locally restricted to the active-site region, and there is no major domain motion related to the redox state of DsbA (6Schirra H.J. Renner C. Czisch M. Huber-Wunderlich M. Holak T.A. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6263-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 7Guddat L.W. Bardwell J.C. Martin J.L.

Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar,10Zapun A. Bardwell J.C. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and it oxidizes thiol compounds randomly and extremely rapidly (11Wunderlich M. Otto A. Seckler R. Glockshuber R.

Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3576-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The pKa of the nucleophilic, active-site thiol of Cys30 has an extremely low value of 3.4 (compared with 9 to 10 for normal cysteine side chains) (14Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The low pKa can, at least qualitatively, explain the high redox potential of the enzyme, as well as the fact that the reduced state of DsbA is thermodynamically more stable than the oxidized state (10Zapun A. Bardwell J.C. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 14Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E.

The x-ray and NMR structures of reduced DsbA indicate that the partial positive charge from the dipole of the active-site helix α1 stabilizes the thiolate anion of Cys30, which is the most N-terminal residue of α-helix 1. In addition, His32 presumably contributes about one pKa unit to the lowered pKa of Cys30, possibly by formation of a hydrogen bond between the Cys30 thiolate and Nδ1 (7Guddat L.W. Bardwell J.C. Martin J.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar,16Hol W.G. Prog. Biophys. Mol.

Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14503-14511Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, possible hydrogen bonds with the thiol of Cys33, the amide hydrogen of His32, and the amide hydrogen of Cys33 further stabilize the Cys30 thiolate (7Guddat L.W. Bardwell J.C. Martin J.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).The redox potentials of the different members of the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase family vary over a wide range, from −122 mV for the most oxidizing member DsbA to −270 mV for thioredoxin, the most reducing member (8Martin J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 9Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R.

Previous mutagenesis studies have shown that the Xaa-Xaa dipeptide sequence between the active-site cysteines is a critical determinant of the redox properties of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases. The first experiment in this direction was the replacement of the Gly-Pro dipeptide in E. colithioredoxin with that of eukaryotic protein disulfide isomerase (PDI)1 (Gly-His). The mutation shifted the redox properties of thioredoxin by 35 mV toward the redox potential of PDI (20Krause G. Lundstrom J. Barea J.L. Pueyo de la Cuesta C. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9494-9500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analogous results were reported for the catalytic a-domain of PDI, in which the reverse exchange of the dipeptide Gly-His against the thioredoxin dipeptide Gly-Pro leads to a decrease in redox potential by 66 mV (18Kortemme T. Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14503-14511Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For thioredoxin variants carrying the dipeptide Gly-His (like PDI), Pro-His (like DsbA), and Pro-Tyr (like glutaredoxin), the redox potential increases by 49, 66, and 75 mV (21Mössner E. Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Conversely, lowered redox potentials were obtained for analogous dipeptide variants of DsbA (22Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Folding Des. 1998; 3: 161-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Random mutagenesis of the dipeptide in DsbA, thioredoxin, or PDI, combined with functional screening or selection methods, has also clearly demonstrated the functional importance of the Xaa-Xaa dipeptide (23Chivers P.T. Laboissiere M.C. Raines R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2659-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24Grauschopf U. Winther J.R. Korber P. Zander T. Dallinger P. Bardwell J.C.

To this end, we have simultaneously randomized all six non-cysteine residues of the active-site helix α1, i.e. residues 31, 32, and 34–37 (see Fig. 1), and screened overproducing bacterial clones for biologically active and inactive variants. From the pool of 98 different sequences (see Supplemental Material, Table B), nine different variants were chosen for further in vitrocharacterization (see Table I). The redox potentials, pKa values of Cys30, reactivity toward the reduced polypeptide substrate hirudin, and the reoxidation by DsbB were measured for these variants and compared with the properties of wild type DsbA.Table IPrimary structures of E. coli DsbA variants with randomized active-site helix α1 that were arbitrarily selected after expression analysis for biochemical characterizationAmino acid numberaActive-site cysteines are depicted in bold, as are proline residues within segment 34–37.3031323334353637% buriedbPercentage of solvent-inaccessibility of the corresponding amino acid side chain in the x-ray structure of oxidized DsbA (5,7), calculated with the program MOLMOL (47).9133309976497789# of variantExpression levelcExpression level of the DsbA variants was classified as follows: +++, strong, wild type-like expression (100–30% of wild type level); ++, 10–30% of wild type level.WTCPHCYQFE+++Active DsbA variantsdDsbA variants were classified according to their in vivo activity with respect to oxidative inactivation of periplasmically oriented β-galactosidase (1) and recovery of motility (29) in a dsbA deletion strain: class I, variants active in both assays; class II, variants that are active in the β-galactosidase assay but inactive in the motility assay; class III, variants that are inactive in both assays.1CPPCRLIY+++2CHDCSEFS+++3CHACGLRY+++Semi-active DsbA variantsdDsbA variants were classified according to their in vivo activity with respect to oxidative inactivation of periplasmically oriented β-galactosidase (1) and recovery of motility (29) in a dsbA deletion strain: class I, variants active in both assays; class II, variants that are active in the β-galactosidase assay but inactive in the motility assay; class III, variants that are inactive in both assays.70CRGCNKLA+++71CRSCCTYR+++Inactive DsbA variantsdDsbA variants were classified according to their in vivo activity with respect to oxidative inactivation of periplasmically oriented β-galactosidase (1) and recovery of motility (29) in a dsbA deletion strain: class I, variants active in both assays; class II, variants that are active in the β-galactosidase assay but inactive in the motility assay; class III, variants that are inactive in both assays.82CRICFQVP++83CYECTADH++84CHTCASTR++85CKHCPVPT++a Active-site cysteines are depicted in bold, as are proline residues within segment 34–37.b Percentage of solvent-inaccessibility of the corresponding amino acid side chain in the x-ray structure of oxidized DsbA (5Martin J.L.

Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONNumerous mutagenesis studies in the last few years have demonstrated that proteins can be very tolerant toward multiple amino acid replacements and that tertiary structure context plays a major role in defining the eventual fold of a polypeptide chain (40Minor Jr., D.L. Kim P.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 41DeGrado W.F. Summa C.M. Pavone V. Nastri F. Lombardi A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 779-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 42Gustafsson C. Govindarajan S. Emig R. Exploration of sequence space for protein engineering..J. Mol. Recognit. 2001; 14: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For example, randomization of all amino acids from the hydrophobic core of barnase leads to a surprisingly high tolerance toward substitutions (43Axe D.D. Foster N.W. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5590-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Moreover, extensive site-directed substitutions of amino acids in T4 lysozyme suggest that about half of the natural primary structure would be sufficient for defining the three-dimensional structure of the protein (44Matthews B.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the case of the small SH3 domain, it was even possible to reduce the amino acid alphabet to only five different amino acids (45Riddle D.S. Santiago J.V. Bray-Hall S.T. Doshi N. Grantcharova V.P., Yi, Q. Baker D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the fact that about 70% of all variants of DsbA obtained after complete randomization of six residues from the active-site helix α1 retained native tertiary structure and biological activity is remarkable and unexpected. This is because helix α1 is a well conserved element of regular secondary structure in the DsbA family, and because the dipole of helix α1 and hydrogen bonds within the 310-helical, N-terminal part of α1 are assumed to cause the low pKa value of Cys30 (7Guddat L.W. Bardwell J.C. Martin J.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The low pKa of Cys30is indeed considered the key factor underlying the enormous oxidative force of DsbA and the extreme reactivity of its active-site disulfide bond (14Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 24Grauschopf U. Winther J.R. Korber P. Zander T. Dallinger P. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Although we cannot make statements about the exact local structures of the randomized segments in the mutant proteins from our present data, all spectroscopic techniques applied so far, as well as the abnormally low pKa values of Cys30 observed for all mutant proteins, indicate that even the biologically inactive DsbA variants obtained after randomization of α1 have essentially wild type-like tertiary structures. Altogether, these results demonstrate that tertiary structure context almost alone determines folding of segment 30–37 to a conformation guaranteeing a functional enzyme. This is in agreement with the view that tertiary structure context is more important for folding of polypeptide segments within a protein than, for example, secondary structure propensities or steric factors (40Minor Jr., D.L. Kim P.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Our data also provide further evidence for the extremely degenerate code for protein folding, i.e. that a large number of sequences fulfill the requirements for the same tertiary structure.The high sequence variability of the active-site helix of DsbA is also in agreement with results from a previous circular permutation study on DsbA, in which a series of permuted DsbA variants with novel N and C termini at different positions in the polypeptide chain was investigated. This study demonstrated that the α-helical domain of DsbA, but not its catalytic thioredoxin domain, is critical for folding and stability and is the most stable part of the enzyme (27Hennecke J. Sebbel P. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1197-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The α-helical domain of DsbA, which is inserted into the thioredoxin motif, could thus have provided a scaffold for evolving the thioredoxin domain of DsbA toward an oxidizing redox potential by interdomain stabilization. Our present data are also in agreement with previous mutagenesis studies on the DsbA segment 38–40, which connects α1 to the second part of the active-site helix α1′ (residues 41–50). Deletion of residues 38–40, as well as other mutations that eliminate all charged residues in the vicinity of the catalytic disulfide bond, had practically no effect on the functional properties of DsbA (34Jacobi A. Huber-Wunderlich M. Hennecke J. Glockshuber R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21692-21699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar,39Hennecke J. Spleiss C. Glockshuber R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 189-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).The measured redox potentials of the active-site helix variants generated in this study also provide interesting information on the functional requirements for the catalyst of disulfide bond formation in the bacterial periplasm. Together with previous data obtained for periplasmically produced thioredoxin variants, our data suggest that the redox potential of a biologically active catalyst that can complement DsbA deficiency in vivo must be above −210 mV. In the case of DsbA, it appears that the general consequence of a lowered redox potential in DsbA variants is less efficient oxidation of polypeptide substrates. In this context, the active variant 1 is particularly interesting, as its redox potential is already at the threshold value of −210 mV. The low redox potential of variant 1 may be compensated by its fast reoxidation through DsbB, which occurs 5.4-fold faster at DsbB saturation than wild type DsbA (see Fig. 5 and Table II). Rationally engineered, more reducing analogs of variant 1 could therefore be used to search for biologically active DsbA variants with even more reducing redox potentials.The fact that some of the DsbA variants (variants 1 and 70) appeared to be more efficient oxidants in the hirudin oxidation and refolding experiments than the wild type, despite their lower redox potentials (Fig. 4), has to be interpreted carefully. One of the main disadvantages of DsbA is its extremely rapid, random oxidation of substrate proteins with multiple cysteine residues. This initially leads to a high fraction of fully oxidized but scrambled molecules in the case of the substrate hirudin (11Wunderlich M. Otto A. Seckler R. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12251-12256Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As scrambled, fully oxidized molecules cannot isomerize spontaneously to the native conformation without reduction of at least one of the disulfide bonds by an external reductant, isomerization of non-native disulfide bonds is rate-limiting for hirudin folding after oxidation with wild type DsbA. A slightly slower oxidation of hirudin, allowing intramolecular disulfide rearrangements of partially oxidized species, would thus lead to higher apparent folding rates. This appears to be exactly the case for the DsbA variants 1 and 70 (Fig. 4), which cause a slower disappearance of the HPLC peak corresponding to fully reduced hirudin but faster formation of native hirudin than wild type DsbA (Fig. 4).Another interesting aspect of the present study with regard to thein vivo function of DsbA is the identification of the semi-active variants 70–73 (see Tables I and II and Supplemental Material, Table B), which all successfully inactivated periplasmically oriented β-galactosidase by random oxidation but failed to restore motility to the dsbA deletion strain. The two purified variants 70 and 71 had sufficiently high redox potentials for biological activity (−166 and −185 mV, respectively), proved to be fully active in oxidizing hirudin, and were efficiently reoxidized by DsbB in vitro. Thus, there is no obvious reason why these variants should not be fully active. We believe that the simplest explanation for the failure to reconstitute motility in thedsbA deletion strain is a more restricted substrate specificity of the semi-active variants. As mentioned above, all sequenced semi-active variants have a basic residue at position 31, which is normally not found in active variants (see Supplemental Material, Table B; only exception, variant 47). A basic residue at position 31 may prevent efficient oxidation of subunits of the flagellar P-ring, whose functional assembly is probed by the motility reconstitution assay. This result suggests that broad substrate specificity is another critical, functional property of DsbA, the common oxidant of all 148 periplasmic E. coli proteins (46Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (5972) Google Scholar). The thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase DsbA from Escherichia coli is a monomeric protein of 189 amino acids, which is required for disulfide bond formation in the bacterial periplasm (1Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 2Kamitani S. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The enzyme contains a catalytic disulfide bridge, which is located at the N terminus of the active-site helix α1 with the sequence Cys30-Pro31-His32-Cys33-Tyr34-Gln35-Phe36-Glu37. DsbA-mediated disulfide bond formation in the periplasm involves oxidation of reduced, newly translocated substrate polypeptides by DsbA, followed by reoxidation of DsbA by the inner membrane protein DsbB. DsbB is in turn reoxidized by molecular oxygen through ubiquinone and terminal cytochrome oxidases (3Bader M. Muse W. Zander T. Bardwell J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10302-10307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D.P. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C.

The three-dimensional structure of both oxidized and reduced DsbA has been solved by x-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy (5Martin J.L. Bardwell J.C. Kuriyan J.

Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). In addition to the thioredoxin domain, DsbA possesses a second, purely α-helical domain, which is inserted into the thioredoxin domain (5Martin J.L. Bardwell J.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1993; 365: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The structural differences between oxidized and reduced DsbA are locally restricted to the active-site region, and there is no major domain motion related to the redox state of DsbA (6Schirra H.J.

Biophysical studies on DsbA have shown that the protein is the strongest known oxidant within the disulfide oxidoreductase family (9Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R.

Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3576-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The pKa of the nucleophilic, active-site thiol of Cys30 has an extremely low value of 3.4 (compared with 9 to 10 for normal cysteine side chains) (14Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The low pKa can, at least qualitatively, explain the high redox potential of the enzyme, as well as the fact that the reduced state of DsbA is thermodynamically more stable than the oxidized state (10Zapun A. Bardwell J.C. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 14Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E.

The x-ray and NMR structures of reduced DsbA indicate that the partial positive charge from the dipole of the active-site helix α1 stabilizes the thiolate anion of Cys30, which is the most N-terminal residue of α-helix 1. In addition, His32 presumably contributes about one pKa unit to the lowered pKa of Cys30, possibly by formation of a hydrogen bond between the Cys30 thiolate and Nδ1 (7Guddat L.W. Bardwell J.C.
