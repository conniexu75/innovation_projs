This photoelectrochemical cell, which is voltage biased with an integrated photovoltaic device, splits water directly upon illumination; light is the only energy input. The hydrogen production efficiency of this system, based on the short-circuit current and the lower heating value of hydrogen, is 12.4 percent."
https://openalex.org/W2045563337,"Interleukin 1β-converting enzyme-like proteases (caspases) are crucial components of cell death pathways. Among the caspases identified, caspase-3 stands out because it is commonly activated by numerous death signals and cleaves a variety of important cellular proteins. Studies in caspase-3 knock-out mice have shown that this protease is essential for brain development. To investigate the requirement for caspase-3 in apoptosis, we took advantage of the MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell line, which we show here has lost caspase-3 owing to a 47-base pair deletion within exon 3 of the CASP-3 gene. This deletion results in the skipping of exon 3 during pre-mRNA splicing, thereby abrogating translation of the CASP-3 mRNA. Although MCF-7 cells were still sensitive to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- or staurosporine-induced apoptosis, no DNA fragmentation was observed. In addition, MCF-7 cells undergoing cell death did not display some of the distinct morphological features typical of apoptotic cells such as shrinkage and blebbing. Introduction of the CASP-3 gene into MCF-7 cells resulted in DNA fragmentation and cellular blebbing following TNF treatment. These results indicate that although caspase-3 is not essential for TNF- or staurosporine-induced apoptosis, it is required for DNA fragmentation and some of the typical morphological changes of cells undergoing apoptosis.

Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is typically accompanied by the activation of a class of death proteases (caspases) and widespread biochemical and morphological changes to the cell (1Nicholson D.W.

These changes almost invariably involve chromatin condensation and its margination at the nuclear periphery, extensive double-stranded DNA fragmentation, and cellular shrinkage and blebbing (3Wyllie A.H.

The most commonly activated caspase (caspase-3) can mediate the limited proteolysis of these proteins, as well as the cleavage inactivation of DNA fragmentation factor (DFF45; ICAD) (9Sakahira H.

Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar, 2Porter A.G. Ng P. Jänicke R.U. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), it is not known if caspase-3 is required in vivo for breakdown of DNA or cleavage of any of the proteins involved in maintaining cellular architecture. Here we show that MCF-7 carcinoma cells, which can be killed by apoptotic stimuli without DNA fragmentation and many of the hallmarks of apoptosis (7Oberhammer F. Wilson J.W. Dive C. Morris I.D. Hickman J.A. Wakeling A.E. Walker P.R. Sikorska M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar), are devoid of caspase-3 owing to a functional deletion in the CASP-3 gene. This has enabled us to address the question of whether caspase-3 is essential for double-stranded DNA breaks and some of the morphological alterations typical of apoptotic cell death. The human Sy5y neuroblastoma cell line was provided by E. Feldman (University of Michigan), and the human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 was obtained from the ATCC. Cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sy5y) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm glutamine, and 50 μg (each) of streptomycin and penicillin/ml (16Jänicke R.U. Lee F.H.H. Porter A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5661-5670Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The origin and cultivation of HeLa D98 and H21 cells were as described (16Jänicke R.U. Lee F.H.H. Porter A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5661-5670Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The protease inhibitors aprotinin, bacitracin, antipain, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as well as staurosporine were purchased from Sigma. The specific activity of TNF was 4 × 107units/mg protein. The monoclonal antibodies to CPP32 (caspase-3) were from Transduction Laboratories Inc. The monoclonal anti-actin antibodies were from Sigma. Cell extracts were prepared as described (17Jänicke R.U. Lin X.Y. Lee F.H.H. Porter A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5245-5253Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For detection of caspase-3, cell extracts were separated in 0.1% SDS, 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and subjected to Western blotting as described (16Jänicke R.U. Lee F.H.H. Porter A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5661-5670Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The protein was visualized by the Amersham ECL kit. The plasmid pcDNA3 containing the full-length Yama (CASP-3) cDNA was provided by V. Dixit. For the isolation of CASP-3 cDNA, total RNA was extracted by the guanidinium thiocyanate method as described (16Jänicke R.U. Lee F.H.H. Porter A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5661-5670Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) or with a Qiagen RNA purification kit reverse transcribed with the SuperScript Kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) and amplified by PCR. The following primers were used for the PCR (BamHI and EcoRI sites are indicated by italicized letters): Y1, 5′-AAAGGATCCTTAATAAAGGTATCCATGGAGAACACT-3′ (nucleotides −15 to +12 relative to the AUG in the CASP-3 mRNA); and Y5, 5′-AAAGAATTCTTAGTGATAAAAATAGAGTTCTTTTGTGAG-3′ (nucleotides +834 to +805 of CASP-3 mRNA). The PCR products were cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pUC18. Genomic DNA was isolated from MCF-7 and Sy5y cells with a Qiagen purification kit. Based on the genomic organization of the mouse CASP-3 DNA (18Juan T.S.-C. McNiece I.K. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Fletcher F.A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 749-755PubMed Google Scholar) and published cDNA sequences of human CASP-3 (19Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30761-30764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), DNA fragments were amplified from both cell lines by using two different primer sets specific for exons 2/3 (Y1/Y2) and exons 3/4 (Y3/Y4), respectively (see Fig. 2 C). Primer sequences (BamHI and EcoRI sites are indicated by italicized letters) were: Y1, 5′-AAAGGATCCTTAATAAAGGTATCCATGGAGAACACT-3′ (−15 to +12: exon 2); Y2, 5′-AAAGAATTCCAGTGCTTTTATGAAAATTCTTATTAT-3′ (+178 to +152: exon 3); Y3, 5′-AAAGGATCCAAAGATCATACATGGAAGCGAATCAAT-3′ (+54 to +80: exon 3); and Y4, 5′-AAAGAATTCCATCACGCATCAATTCCACAATTTCTT-3′ (+307 to +281: exon 4). Amplification of MCF-7 or Sy5y DNA with the CASP-3-specific primer sets (Y1/Y2 and Y3/Y4) resulted in two different PCR products, both with a size of approximately 3200 bp, containing exons 2/3 or exons 3/4, respectively (see Fig. 2 C). The 5′ and 3′ ends of the PCR products were directly sequenced with a double-stranded DNA Cycle Sequencing System (Life Technologies, Inc.) to confirm that both fragments were derived from the human CASP-3 gene. Subsequently, DNA fragments from several independent PCR reactions obtained from MCF-7 and Sy5y DNA with the same primer sets (Y1/Y2 and Y3/Y4) were isolated and digested with BamHI and EcoRI. A ∼1800-bp BamHI/EcoRI fragment derived from digestion of the Y1/Y2 PCR product (comprising exon 3 and part of the 5′ flanking intron 2; see Fig. 2 C) and a ∼1900-bp BamHI/BamHI fragment derived from digestion of the Y3/Y4 PCR fragment (comprising exon 3 and part of the 3′ flanking intron 3; see Fig. 2 C) were isolated from both cell lines and cloned into pUC18. Sequence analysis of exon 3 and flanking intron sequences was performed with several clones derived from independent PCRs by using pUC18-specific forward and reverse sequencing primers. Apoptosis was induced with a combination of TNF (30 ng/ml) and cycloheximide (Chx; 10 μg/ml) or with staurosporine (1 μm) (Sigma). Cell death was measured with the standard TNF cytotoxicity assay as described (16Jänicke R.U. Lee F.H.H. Porter A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5661-5670Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). TNF-treated or untreated cells were fixed in ice-cold 80% ethanol, washed with phosphate-buffered saline and stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml, Sigma) at 37 °C for 60 min in the presence of RNase (20 μg/ml, Sigma) and 0.1% Triton X-100. Cell cycle analysis was performed using a Becton Dickinson FACScan. For each determination, a minimum of 20,000 cells were analyzed. For DNA fragmentation analysis, cellular DNA was prepared using the Blood and Cell Culture Mini DNA kit (Qiagen, Germany). Purified DNA was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 200 μg/ml RNase and analyzed on 1.6% agarose gels. DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining. MCF-7 cells were stably transfected with caspase-3 or the expression vector alone (pcDNA3, Invitrogen) using the SuperFect Reagent (Qiagen, Germany). 40 h post-transfection, cells were trypsinized and reseeded in medium containing 800 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). HeLa D98 and H21 carcinoma cells, which are highly or only marginally sensitive to TNF-induced apoptosis, respectively (16Jänicke R.U. Lee F.H.H. Porter A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5661-5670Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), were treated with TNF or staurosporine, and the percentage of apoptosis was compared with the activation of pro-caspase-3. Because the caspase-3 antibody used for Western blot analysis did not detect the active 17-kDa subunit, the activation/processing of caspase-3 was judged by the disappearance of the 32-kDa precursor form. A 4-h treatment with TNF/Chx killed 78% of HeLa D98 cells (Fig. 1 A) and resulted in a complete loss of the 32-kDa caspase-3 precursor form (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, pro-caspase-3 was efficiently processed in HeLa H21 cells following a 4-h treatment with TNF/Chx (Fig. 1 B, lane 5), but only 18% of the cells were killed (Fig. 1 A). There was also no correlation between the extent of cell death and activation of caspase-3 when both HeLa cell lines were exposed to the apo-ptosis inducer staurosporine (20Bertrand R. Solary E. O'Connor P. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Although both cell lines were efficiently killed after a 16-h staurosporine treatment (Fig. 1 A), extensive processing of pro-caspase-3 was observed only in HeLa D98 cells (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 3 and 6). These results suggest that TNF and staurosporine may activate different apoptotic pathways and that caspase-3 activation is dependent not only on the death stimulus but also on the cell type. Our observation that caspase-3 may not be essential for all death scenarios was directly proven with the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7. These cells were efficiently killed by both death stimuli, TNF/Chx and staurosporine (Fig. 1 A); however, we could not detect the expression of pro-caspase-3 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 7–9). To investigate why pro-caspase-3 was absent in MCF-7 cells, Northern blot analysis was performed with total RNA from MCF-7, HeLa D98, and H21 cells, as well as Jurkat cells that were shown to express functional CASP-3 mRNA (19Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30761-30764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All cell lines showed similar expression of the CASP-3 mRNA, and no apparent size differences were observed (data not shown). Therefore, the lack of pro-caspase-3 in MCF-7 cells is not due to the failure to transcribe CASP-3 mRNA. To determine whether mutation(s) led to the loss of pro-caspase-3, total RNA prepared from MCF-7 cells was reverse transcribed and used for PCR amplification. The RT-PCR performed with specific primers flanking the entire coding region of the CASP-3 mRNA gave rise to a fragment of around 750 bp (Fig. 2 A, lane 2), which was shorter than the expected 867 bp observed in two control reactions performed with total RNA from HeLa D98 and Jurkat cells (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 4). Sequence analysis revealed that the MCF-7 CASP-3 mRNA contained a deletion of nucleotides 54–178 (Fig. 2 B), whereas the mRNA from HeLa D98 cells matched the published sequence of the CASP-3 cDNA (19Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30761-30764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The deletion of 125 nucleotides found in the MCF-7CASP-3 mRNA leads to a frame shift starting at codon 18, thereby creating a new in-frame stop codon 41 amino acids downstream of the initiation codon (Fig. 2 B), thus explaining the lack of pro-caspase-3 in MCF-7 cells. Six clones from two independent PCRs all contained the same deletion, and no DNA corresponding to the full-length CASP-3 cDNA was detected, suggesting that the PCR did not lead to the introduction of mutations in this gene and that no wild-type allele of CASP-3 is expressed. Furthermore, several MCF-7 clones obtained from different sources were all found to contain the same deletion in the CASP-3 mRNA, implying that the loss of pro-caspase-3 is not due to clonal variation. The genomic organization of the human CASP-3 gene is unknown. However, based on the genomic map of the mouseCASP-3 gene (18Juan T.S.-C. McNiece I.K. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Fletcher F.A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 749-755PubMed Google Scholar), it is obvious that exon 3 consists of exactly the 125 nucleotides deleted in the MCF-7 CASP-3 mRNA. Therefore, we concluded that the CASP-3 mRNA produced in MCF-7 cells does not contain exon 3. To identify the cause of the exon skipping, two different primer sets for the CASP-3 gene were used to amplify genomic DNA from MCF-7 and Sy5y cells (which express pro-caspase-3; data not shown). In both cell lines, primer set Y1/Y2 specific for exons 2 and 3 (Fig. 2 C) gave rise to a PCR product of the expected size of approximately 3200 bp, whereas the fragment obtained with primer set Y3/Y4 specific for exons 3 and 4 (Fig. 2 C) was much longer (∼3200 bp) than the corresponding intron 3 sequence reported for the mouseCASP-3 gene (∼1755 bp) (18Juan T.S.-C. McNiece I.K. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Fletcher F.A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 749-755PubMed Google Scholar). Sequencing of the amplified products revealed a deletion of nucleotides 84–130 within exon 3 of the MCF-7 CASP-3 gene, whereas the full-length exon 3 matching the known CASP-3 sequence was present in Sy5y cells. In addition, approximately 100 bp of adjacent intron sequences upstream and downstream of exon 3 (3′-intron 2 and 5′-intron 3, respectively) as well as intron consensus sequences downstream of exon 2 and upstream of exon 4 (Fig. 2 C) were found to be identical in both MCF-7 and Sy5y cells, indicating that the skipping of exon 3 in MCF-7 cells is not due to mutations in these important splicing regions. These results suggest that the deletion of 47 bp within exon 3 of the CASP-3 gene in MCF-7 cells leads to the skipping of this exon during splicing of the CASP-3 pre-mRNA. Recently, it was reported that MCF-7 cells do not express detectable levels of caspase-3 (21Li F. Srinivasan A. Wang Y. Armstrong R.C. Tomaselli K.J. Fritz L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30299-30305Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Here we extend this observation and show that the lack of caspase-3 in MCF-7 cells is due to a partial deletion within exon 3 of the CASP-3 gene. How does the deletion within exon 3 result in the skipping of the complete exon? Correct splicing of pre-mRNAs depends on conserved sequences around the 5′ and 3′ intronic splice sites, including a degenerate site of lariat formation (branchpoint) that is approximately 10–50 nucleotides upstream of the 3′ acceptor splice site (22Nilsen T.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 23Valcárcel J. Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 296-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, splice site strength, RNA secondary structure around splice sites, exon length, and even purine-rich exon-specific enhancer sequences have been reported to be involved in exon recognition (23Valcárcel J. Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 296-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Tanaka K. Watakabe A. Shimura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 25Berget S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2411-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Except for the deletion, other sequences in the MCF-7 CASP-3 gene including those around the splice sites of exon 3 were identical to the CASP-3 gene of pro-caspase-3-expressing Sy5y cells. It is also unlikely that the skipping of exon 3 is caused by its small size, because exons shorter than 78 bp can be correctly spliced (25Berget S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2411-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that the deleted internal exon sequences, which do not contain the consensus of the purine-rich exon-specific enhancer sequence GARGARGAR (where R is any purine) (26Xu R. Teng J. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3660-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), are necessary for the correct splicing of the CASP-3 pre-mRNA. Additional studies are necessary to identify the critical sequences and interacting enhancer proteins involved in pre-mRNA splicing (23Valcárcel J. Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 296-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells treated with various apoptotic stimuli (e.g. transforming growth factor-β1 or etoposide) undergo cell death in the absence of DNA fragmentation (7Oberhammer F. Wilson J.W. Dive C. Morris I.D. Hickman J.A. Wakeling A.E. Walker P.R. Sikorska M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). In addition, the apoptotic stimuli TNF/Chx or staurosporine efficiently killed MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1), but no DNA fragmentation was observed (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, treatment of HeLa D98 cells with TNF/Chx or staurosporine resulted in the appearance of the internucleosomal DNA laddering typical of cells undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 3 A, upper panel) (16Jänicke R.U. Lee F.H.H. Porter A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5661-5670Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that caspase-3 activates the endonuclease CAD responsible for DNA fragmentation by specifically cleaving and inactivating ICAD, the inhibitor of CAD (9Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar, 10Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). However, because there are several caspase-3-like proteases, it is not known whether caspase-3 is sufficient or essential for DNA fragmentation. To investigate the hypothesis that caspase-3 is required for DNA fragmentation, CASP-3 cDNA was stably transfected into MCF-7 cells, which resulted in the generation of 26 individual caspase-3-expressing MCF-7 clones. In all of these clones, caspase-3 was not spontaneously activated, and there were no detectable morphological changes (data not shown). However, the caspase-3 activation pathway was fully functional in these transfectants, because TNF/Chx treatment of MCF-7.3.28 cells (one representative caspase-3-expressing clone out of three tested) resulted in the efficient activation of this protease as judged by Western blotting (Fig. 3 B, top panel). In addition, MCF-7.3.28 cells showed a slight increase in TNF sensitivity (data not shown), and more importantly, DNA from TNF/Chx-treated MCF-7.3.28 cells exhibited the internucleosomal DNA laddering typical of apoptotic cells (Fig. 3 B, middle panel). No internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was observed in MCF-7 cells transfected with the vector alone (Fig. 3 B, middle panel). Lighter exposures of both agarose gels revealed extensive double-stranded DNA breaks as judged by faster migrating DNA only in TNF/Chx- and staurosporine-treated HeLa D98 cells (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel) and TNF/Chx-treated MCF-7 cells stably expressing caspase-3 (Fig. 3 B, bottom panel). These data demonstrate that the components required for DNA fragmentation are present and fully functional in MCF-7 cells and, furthermore, indicate that caspase-3 is essential for their activation. Cell cycle analysis with propidium iodide-stained cells confirmed these results, because TNF/Chx induced the appearance of a sub-G1apoptotic peak characteristic of DNA fragmentation in MCF-7.3.28 cells (Fig. 4 B) but not in vector-transfected (Fig. 4 A) nor in parental MCF-7 cells (data not shown). Finally, MCF-7.3.28 cells but not MCF-7/vector cells showed the morphological changes typical of cells undergoing apoptosis such as shrinkage and blebbing following TNF/Chx treatment (Fig. 4,C and D). TNF/Chx treatment of two other individual caspase-3-expressing MCF-7 clones also resulted in DNA fragmentation and blebbing (data not shown). Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that caspase-3 is required for DNA fragmentation and the morphological changes during apoptosis. MCF-7 cells transfected to express the Fas antigen CD95 were shown to be sensitive to Fas ligand-induced apoptosis but were resistant to apoptosis induced by microinjection of cytochrome c (21Li F.

In addition, we show that MCF-7 cells are as sensitive as HeLa D98 cells to TNF- or staurosporine-induced apoptosis despite the functional deletion of the CASP-3 gene, demonstrating that apoptosis induced by these agents does not require caspase-3. MCF-7 cells have been widely reported to die by apoptosis induced by TNF, Fas, or staurosporine (21Li F. Srinivasan A. Wang Y. Armstrong R.C. Tomaselli K.J. Fritz L.C. J. Biol.

However, rounding and detachment of MCF-7 cells was accompanied by an altered chromatin structure but without a typical apoptotic morphology and, notably, in the absence of any DNA fragmentation (7Oberhammer F.

By expressing caspase-3 in MCF-7 cells, we have shown that caspase-3 is required for the surface blebbing that is so typical of a disintegrating apoptotic cell. Caspase-3 (or a related caspase-3-like protease) has been shown to cleave a number of structural proteins involved in maintaining cytoplasmic and nuclear architecture and integrity, such as gelsolin, actin, α-fodrin, PAK2, FAK, and rabaptin-5 (2Porter A.G.

We have also demonstrated that caspase-3 is essential for fragmentation of MCF-7 cell chromosomal DNA during TNF-induced apoptosis. CAD was shown to be the DNA endonuclease responsible for cleaving chromosomal DNA specifically during apoptosis (9Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar, 10Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). The inhibitor of this endonuclease (ICAD; DFF45) can be cleaved and inactivated by caspase-3, releasing active CAD that translocates into the nucleus where it degrades the DNA (9Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar, 10Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S.

Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). Our results raise the possibility that ICAD degradation may be the caspase-3-dependent step in DNA fragmentation. If not, another as yet unknown caspase-3-dependent cleavage step may occur upstream or downstream of CAD activation. In conclusion, this is the first report showing that a caspase is functionally deleted in a cancer cell line and that caspase-3 is required for certain distinctive biochemical and morphological changes during apoptosis. Knockout mouse studies have established that caspase-3 is essential for proper brain development, but it is not known at what step it acts (30Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C-y. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar). In contrast, caspase-3 is apparently dispensable for programmed cell death in all other tissues and organs (30Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C-y. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar), which implies that apoptosis during development in caspase-3-deficient mice may occur without DNA fragmentation. We thank P.

https://openalex.org/W2009283506,"The NEUROGENINS (NGNs) are neural-specific basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) transcription factors. Mouse embryos lacking ngn1 fail to generate the proximal subset of cranial sensory neurons. ngn1 is required for the activation of a cascade of downstream bHLH factors, including NeuroD, MATH3, and NSCL1. ngn1 is expressed by placodal ectodermal cells and acts prior to neuroblast delamination. Moreover, NGN1 positively regulates the Delta homolog DLL1 and can be negatively regulated by Notch signaling. Thus, ngn1 functions similarly to the proneural genes in Drosophila. However, the initial pattern of ngn1 expression appears to be Notch independent. Taken together with the fact that ectopic ngn1 expression can convert ectodermal cells to neurons in Xenopus (50Ma Q.

https://openalex.org/W2121726351,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by selective upper and lower motor neuron degeneration, the pathogenesis of which is unknown. About 60%-70% of sporadic ALS patients have a 30%-95% loss of the astroglial glutamate transporter EAAT2 (excitatory amino acid transporter 2) protein in motor cortex and spinal cord. Loss of EAAT2 leads to increased extracellular glutamate and excitotoxic neuronal degeneration. Multiple abnormal EAAT2 mRNAs, including intron-retention and exon-skipping, have now been identified from the affected areas of ALS patients. The aberrant mRNAs were highly abundant and were found only in neuropathologically affected areas of ALS patients but not in other brain regions. They were found in 65% of sporadic ALS patients but were not found in nonneurologic disease or other disease controls. They were also detectable in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of living ALS patients, early in the disease. In vitro expression studies suggest that proteins translated from these aberrant mRNAs may undergo rapid degradation and/ or produce a dominant negative effect on normal EAAT2 resulting in loss of protein and activity. These findings suggest that the loss of EAAT2 in ALS is due to aberrant mRNA and that these aberrant mRNAs could result from RNA processing errors. Aberrant RNA processing could be important in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disease and in excitotoxicity. The presence of these mRNA species in ALS CSF may have diagnostic utility."

Cathepsin L was found to be necessary for Ii degradation in cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs), but not in bone marrow (BM)-derived antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Consequently, positive selection of CD4+ T cells was reduced. Because different cysteine proteinases are responsible for specific Ii degradation steps in cTECs and BM-derived APCs, the proteolytic environment in cells mediating positive and negative selection may be distinct.

https://openalex.org/W1998747207,"Cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) is a model system for neuronal information storage that has an absolute requirement for activation of protein kinase C (PKC). It has been claimed to underlie several forms of cerebellar motor learning. Previous studies using various knockout mice (mGluR1, GluRdelta2, glial fibrillary acidic protein) have supported this claim; however, this work has suffered from the limitations that the knockout technique lacks anatomical specificity and that functional compensation can occur via similar gene family members. To overcome these limitations, a transgenic mouse (called L7-PKCI) has been produced in which the pseudosubstrate PKC inhibitor, PKC[19-31], was selectively expressed in Purkinje cells under the control of the pcp-2(L7) gene promoter. Cultured Purkinje cells prepared from heterozygous or homozygous L7-PKCI embryos showed a complete blockade of LTD induction. In addition, the compensatory eye movements of L7-PKCI mice were recorded during vestibular and visual stimulation. Whereas the absolute gain, phase, and latency values of the vestibulo-ocular reflex and optokinetic reflex of the L7-PKCI mice were normal, their ability to adapt their vestibulo-ocular reflex gain during visuo-vestibular training was absent. These data strongly support the hypothesis that activation of PKC in the Purkinje cell is necessary for cerebellar LTD induction, and that cerebellar LTD is required for a particular form of motor learning, adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex."

https://openalex.org/W2021669986,"Initiation factor eIF4E binds to the 5′-cap of eukaryotic mRNAs and plays a key role in the mechanism and regulation of translation. It may be regulated through its own phosphorylation and through inhibitory binding proteins (4E-BPs), which modulate its availability for initiation complex assembly. eIF4E phosphorylation is enhanced by phorbol esters. We show, using specific inhibitors, that this involves both the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and Erk signaling pathways. Cell stresses such as arsenite and anisomycin and the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β also cause increased phosphorylation of eIF4E, which is abolished by the specific p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB203580. These changes in eIF4E phosphorylation parallel the activity of the eIF4E kinase, Mnk1. However other stresses such as heat shock, sorbitol, and H2O2, which also stimulate p38 MAP kinase and increase Mnk1 activity, do not increase phosphorylation of eIF4E. The latter stresses increase the binding of eIF4E to 4E-BP1, and we show that this blocks the phosphorylation of eIF4E by Mnk1 in vitro, which may explain the absence of an increase in eIF4E phosphorylation under these conditions.

Initiation factor eIF4E plays a key role in mRNA translation and its regulation (1Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control.

Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 293-310PubMed Google Scholar). eIF4E binds to the 7-methylguanosine triphosphate (“cap”) structure found at the 5′-end of eukaryotic cytoplasmic mRNAs. eIF4E also interacts with eIF4G, a large scaffolding protein, which itself binds to other translation factors including eIF4A, an RNA helicase, and eIF3, a multimeric protein that binds to the 40 S ribosomal subunit (3Hentze M.W. Science. 1997; 275: 500-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The complex of eIF4E, eIF4G, and eIF4A is often termed eIF4F and is believed to be especially important for the translation of mRNAs whose 5′-untranslated regions are rich in secondary structure, because such structures in general inhibit translation but can be unwound by eIF4A (1Sonenberg N.

Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar)). It is regulated by phosphorylation at multiple sites, in response,e.g. to insulin, which causes its dissociation from eIF4E (4Lawrence J.C. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). eIF4E is a phosphoprotein, and its phosphorylation is generally enhanced by agents that activate translation (reviewed in Refs. 1Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar and2Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 293-310PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF4E increases its affinity for the cap and for mRNA and may also favor its entry into initiation complexes (1Sonenberg N.

The phosphorylation site in eIF4E is Ser209 (5Joshi B. Cai A.L. Keiper B.D. Minich W.B. Mendez R. Beach C.M. Stolarski R. Darzynkiewicz E. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol.

We have recently shown that insulin-induced eIF4E phosphorylation requires the MAP kinase signaling pathway (also termed the Erk, extracellular signal-regulatedkinase pathway, the term used here) (7Flynn A. Proud C.G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, eIF4E is not a substrate for the Erks, and we have shown that it is phosphorylated instead at Ser209 by a novel Erk-activated protein kinase, MAP kinase signal-integrating kinase-1 (Mnk1) (8Waskiewicz A.J.

Mnk1 is also phosphorylated and activated by an additional enzyme related to Erk, p38 MAP kinase, which lies on a distinct signaling pathway activated by cell stresses and cytokines (8Waskiewicz A.J.

Cell. 1995; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). Here we show that the increased phosphorylation of eIF4E brought about by the phorbol ester tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), which activates members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family, requires the Erk and p38 MAP kinase pathways. Furthermore, we show that eIF4E phosphorylation is enhanced by agents, such as certain stresses and cytokines, that activate p38 MAP kinase and that this is blocked by a specific inhibitor of this enzyme. Our data support the identity of Mnk1 as a physiologically important eIF4E kinase. Certain stresses that activate p38 MAP kinase do not increase eIF4E phosphorylation. This is likely to be due to the increased association of eIF4E with 4E-BP1 that these conditions bring about, because 4E-BP1 inhibits phosphorylation of eIF4E by Mnk1.

As expected, PD098059 reduced the ability of TPA to enhance eIF4E phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A) and also completely inhibited the activation of Erk by TPA in 293 cells (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–4). However, the inhibition of eIF4E phosphorylation was incomplete indicating that other signaling pathways were involved. We therefore tested the effect of a specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase SB203580 (21Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C.

It has been shown not to interfere with stress-, cytokine-, or growth factor-induced activation of other signaling pathways such as Erk, JNK, or p70 S6 kinase (21Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R.

SB203580 partially blocked TPA-induced eIF4E phosphorylation, and its use together with PD098059 completely abolished TPA-induced eIF4E phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A). As shown in Fig. 1 B(lanes 5–8), TPA activates MAPKAP-K2, which is activated by p38 MAP kinase (10Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamarillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A. Cell. 1995; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1507) Google Scholar), in 293 cells. These data suggest that TPA acts through both Erk and p38 MAP kinase to increase eIF4E phosphorylation in 293 cells. Waskiewicz et al. (8Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) previously showed that Mnk1 could be activated in vitro by either Erk or p38 MAP kinase. To assess Mnk1 activity in 293 cells subjected to these treatments, we transfected 293 cells with a vector encoding wild-type Mnk1 fused to GST (8Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) and subjected the transfected cells to treatment with TPA in the absence or the presence of kinase inhibitors. Cells were extracted, and Mnk1-GST was isolated and assayed. SB203580 or PD098059 only partially prevented the activation of Mnk1 by TPA, but use of both completely abolished it (Fig. 1 C). The changes in Mnk1 activity parallel the alterations in eIF4E phosphorylation observed under these conditions, entirely consistent with a key role for Mnk1 in mediating eIF4E phosphorylation (8Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). TPA also increases eIF4E phosphorylation in CHO.K1 cells, which involves the so-called conventional isoforms of PKC (11Flynn A. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Analysis of the roles of signaling pathways in the phosphorylation of eIF4E in these cells is more complex than for 293 cells due to the high basal level of eIF4E phosphorylation (Fig. 1 D). This was partially decreased either by PD098059 or SB203580, although both were required to completely suppress it (Fig. 1 D). Each compound alone also decreased the level of eIF4E phosphorylation in TPA-treated CHO.K1 cells, but both were again required to abolish eIF4E phosphorylation completely (Fig. 1 D). Taken together, the data reinforce the conclusion that both the Erk and p38 MAP kinase cascades are involved in mediating changes in eIF4E phosphorylation. Our data imply that the phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation of eIF4E is not, as has previously been suggested (1Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar), directly mediated by PKC. A more likely route by which TPA increases eIF4E phosphorylation is through activation of the Erk/p38 MAP kinase cascades, via PKC, leading to the activation of Mnk1, which itself directly phosphorylates eIF4E (8Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). This is consistent with all the published data on phorbol ester-induced eIF4E phosphorylation (11Flynn A. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10611-10616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Morley S.J.

Acta. 1993; 1176: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The above data prompted us to ask whether other treatments that activate p38 MAP kinase affect eIF4E phosphorylation. Arsenite potently activates the p38 MAP kinase pathway in 293 cells (Fig. 2 A) and also markedly increased eIF4E phosphorylation (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–5). The p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 (21Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar) blocked both this and the arsenite-induced activation of MAPKAP-K2 (Fig. 2,A and B). Arsenite did not activate Erk in 293 cells (data not shown), and the MEK inhibitor PD098059 did not affect arsenite-induced eIF4E phosphorylation (Fig. 2 B). Thus, arsenite-induced eIF4E phosphorylation appears to be mediated by the p38 MAP kinase pathway (8Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Changes in Mnk1 activity again parallel those in eIF4E phosphorylation (Fig. 2 C). The ability of arsenite to increase eIF4E phosphorylation is not restricted to 293 cells because the same effect was also observed in CHO.K1 cells (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6–9), and again, SB203580 blocked both arsenite-induced eIF4E phosphorylation and p38 MAP kinase activation (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). Anisomycin activates Mnk1 in 293 cells, and this activation was blocked by SB203580 (Ref. 8Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar and Fig. 2 C). Anisomycin increased eIF4E phosphorylation in 293 cells (to about 80%, data not shown), and this effect was also completely blocked by SB203580. Anisomycin also increases eIF4E phosphorylation in NIH 3T3 cells, and this increase is blocked by SB203580 (25Morley S.J. McKendrick L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17887-17893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The finding that arsenite stimulates eIF4E phosphorylation is surprising given that arsenite potently inhibits protein synthesis (26Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 256: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas eIF4E phosphorylation is normally associated with its activation. It is likely that arsenite inhibits other steps in translation, and, indeed, we have shown that it increases phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eIF2, which is well known to lead to inhibition of peptide chain initiation (27Price N.T. Proud C.G. Biochimie. 1994; 76: 748-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Other stresses such as hyperosmolarity (sorbitol) and oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide) also activate p38 MAP kinase, MAPKAP-K2 (Fig. 2 A) and Mnk1 (Fig. 2 C). However, unlike arsenite, they did not increase eIF4E phosphorylation (Fig. 2 D,lanes 3–5). In 293 cells, where the basal eIF4E phosphorylation is low, no change was seen (Fig. 2 D). In CHO.K1 cells, where the basal eIF4E phosphorylation is significant, they led to a fall in eIF4E phosphorylation (Fig. 2 D). Heat shock did not appreciably activate p38 MAP kinase in 293 cells but did in CHO.K1 cells (16Vries R.G.J. Flynn A. Patel J.C. Wang X. Denton R.M. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32779-32784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and this activation is blocked by SB203580. Despite this, heat shock actually caused a decrease in eIF4E phosphorylation (Fig. 2 D). Why do some stresses increase eIF4E phosphorylation, whereas others cause a decrease, even though they also activate Mnk1? To try to explain this apparent paradox, we analyzed the association of eIF4E with its regulator 4E-BP1; we have previously shown that in CHO.K1 cells, most stresses increase binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E (16Vries R.G.J. Flynn A. Patel J.C. Wang X. Denton R.M. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32779-32784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This effect is also seen in 293 cells (Fig. 3 A). (The exception here (as in CHO cells) is arsenite, which does not cause increased binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E. This is probably because it can activate the rapamycin-sensitive signaling pathway (28Wang X. Proud C.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which leads to the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and its dissociation from eIF4E (4Lawrence J.C. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).) These findings raised the possibility that the association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E might impair phosphorylation of the latter by Mnk1. To test this, we examined the effect of 4E-BP1 on the ability of Mnk1 to phosphorylate eIF4E in vitro. The data (Fig. 3 B) clearly show that 4E-BP1 substantially inhibits the phosphorylation of eIF4E by Mnk1. The highest amount of 4E-BP1 used represents saturation of the eIF4E with 4E-BP1 as indicated by the fact that addition of further 4E-BP1 resulted in (i) it not being retained on m7GTP-Sepharose, i.e. not being associated with eIF4E, and (ii) phosphorylation of the excess 4E-BP1 by the Erk present in the activated Mnk1, with only free 4E-BP1 (and not the 4E-BP1/eIF4E complex) being a substrate for Erk (12Diggle T.A. Moule S.K. Avison M.B. Flynn A. Foulstone E.J. Proud C.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (data not shown). SB203580 had no effect on the association of eIF4E with 4E-BP1, either under stress or control conditions (16Vries R.G.J. Flynn A. Patel J.C. Wang X. Denton R.M. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32779-32784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 2X. Wang, A. Flynn, A. J. Waskiewicz, B. L. J. Webb, R. G. Vries, I. A. Baines, J. A. Cooper, and C. G. Proud, unpublished data. 4E-BP1 did not affect the phosphorylation of another substrate, the cAMP-response element binding protein, by Mnk1 (data not shown). This suggests that inhibition of eIF4E phosphorylation by 4E-BP1 reflects the inability of Mnk1 to phosphorylate eIF4E in the eIF4E/4E-BP1 complex and is likely to be specific for this substrate. The inhibition of Mnk1-catalyzed eIF4E phosphorylation by 4E-BP1 provides an explanation for the differing effects of stresses on eIF4E phosphorylation, and, in particular, for the ability of heat shock to reduce eIF4E phosphorylation (reviewed in Ref. 29Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 271-294Google Scholar). Some studies have shown that rapamycin reduces the level of eIF4E phosphorylation (25Morley S.J. McKendrick L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17887-17893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,30Mendez R. Myers M.G. White M.F. Rhoads R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2857-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that this may be due to increased association of eIF4E with 4E-BP1 caused by rapamycin (due to dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (4Lawrence J.C. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar)) and resulting inhibition of Mnk1-catalyzed eIF4E phosphorylation. 4E-BP1 also blocks the phosphorylation of eIF4E by PKC (31Whalen S.G. Gingras A.C. Amankwa L. Mader S. Branton P.E. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11831-11837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The binding site for 4E-BP1 in eIF4E has recently been identified (32Matsuo H. Li H.J. McGuire A.M. Fletcher C.M. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Wagner G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Because it is some distance from Ser209 in the three-dimensional structure of the protein, it seems unlikely that 4E-BP1 actually occludes the phosphorylation site. The effect of 4E-BP1 may instead reflect interference with the interaction between these kinases and other regions of the eIF4E protein required for kinase/substrate binding. The increased binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E was accompanied by a decrease in the binding of eIF4G to eIF4E (Fig. 3 C), as expected from the mutually competitive nature of their interactions (33Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Consistent with its lack of effect on 4E-BP1 binding, arsenite also had no effect on the association of eIF4E with eIF4G. It was important to ascertain whether treatment of cells with physiological activators of p38 MAP kinase, such as cytokines, also altered the phosphorylation of eIF4E. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) is a physiological regulator of endothelial cell function (34Pietersma A. Tilly B.C. Gaestel M. DeJong N. Lee J.C. Koster J.F. Sluiter W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and in HUVECs it markedly activates the p38 MAP kinase pathway without any apparent effect on Erk activity (data not shown and Ref. 34Pietersma A. Tilly B.C. Gaestel M. DeJong N. Lee J.C. Koster J.F. Sluiter W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We therefore studied its effect on the phosphorylation of eIF4E. TNFα increased the phosphorylation of eIF4E (Fig. 4 A), and this increase was prevented by SB203580, which blocked activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway and hence of MAPKAP-K2. These data show for the first time that cytokines increase phosphorylation of eIF4E through the p38 MAP kinase pathway. In CHO.K1 cells, another cytokine, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) activates p38 MAP kinase, although less markedly than TNFα does in HUVECs (data not shown). IL-1β (5 ng/ml) increased the phosphorylation of eIF4E in CHO.K1 cells (Fig. 4 B). This effect, like that of TNFα in HUVECs, was prevented by SB203580 (data not shown). The ability of activators of p38 MAP kinase to increase eIF4E phosphorylation was seen in three different cell types, human embryonic kidney (293) cells, CHO cells, and HUVECs and in response to stresses and cytokines. In all cases, SB203580 blocked the phosphorylation of eIF4E. The data for TNFα in HUVECs are of particular note given that the TNFα-stimulated induction of the cell adhesion molecule V-CAM is mediated by the p38 MAP kinase pathway (34Pietersma A. Tilly B.C. Gaestel M. DeJong N. Lee J.C. Koster J.F. Sluiter W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and involves post-transcriptional effects that might be related to changes in eIF4E phosphorylation. Both the stress stimuli (arsenite and anisomycin) and TNFα also activate the JNK pathway. However, the ability of SB203580 (which does not affect JNK activity in the cells used here)2 to block eIF4E phosphorylation indicates that the JNK pathway is not involved in modulating eIF4E phosphorylation."

Expression of alternative splice variants of Slo, a gene encoding calcium- and voltage-activated potassium channels, was measured in rat adrenal chromaffin tissue from normal and hypophysectomized animals. Hypophysectomy triggered an abrupt decrease in the proportion of Slo transcripts containing a “STREX” exon. The decrease was prevented by adrenocorticotropic hormone injections. In Xenopus oocytes, STREX variants produced channels with functional properties associated with enhanced repetitive firing. Thus, the hormonal stress axis is likely to control the excitable properties of epinephrine-secreting cells by regulating alternative splicing of Slo messenger RNA."

We have investigated the circuit mechanisms that underlie these correlations by recording simultaneously from many ganglion cells in the salamander retina. During spontaneous activity in darkness, three types of correlations were distinguished: broad (firing synchrony within 40–100 ms), medium (10–50 ms), and narrow (<1 ms). When chemical synaptic transmission was blocked, the broad correlations disappeared, but the medium and narrow correlations persisted. Further analysis of the strength and time course of synchronous firing suggests that nearby ganglion cells share inputs from photoreceptors conveyed through interneurons via chemical synapses (broad correlations), share excitation from amacrine cells via electrical junctions (medium), and excite each other via electrical junctions (narrow). It appears that the firing patterns in the optic nerve are strongly shaped by electrical coupling in the inner retina."

https://openalex.org/W1978734924,"Thalamocortical networks can generate both normal and abnormal patterns of synchronized network activity, such as spindle waves and spike-and-wave seizures. These periods of synchronized discharge are often separated by a silent, refractory phase of between 5 and 20 s. In vitro investigations have demonstrated that this refractory period is due in large part to the persistent activation of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current Ih in thalamocortical cells. Here, we show that increases in [Ca2+]i due to rebound Ca2+ bursts result in persistent activation of Ih resulting from a positive shift in the activation curve of this current. The dynamical upregulation and persistent activation of Ih is the critical determinant of the time course of the refractory period. These findings demonstrate that periodicity in neural network oscillations may be generated through an interaction between the electrophysiological properties and intracellular signaling pathways of the constituent neurons."

Some direction-selective cells showed delayed asymmetric inhibition, some showed a shifting excitatory time course across the receptive field, and some showed both.

The delayed asymmetric inhibition may contribute to the shifting response time course. The data suggest that asymmetric inhibition is the major determinant for directionality in these cells, though both mechanisms could contribute. Based on this physiology, a simple, single-cell model is proposed, consistent with the known anatomy of some direction-selective cells."

Nature. 1989; 341: 752-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif (11Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar, 12Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3281-3285PubMed Google Scholar) in its cytoplasmic tail, and this association is thought to allow aggregated FcγRI to recruit and activate soluble tyrosine kinases (13Duchemin A-M. Anderson C.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 865-871PubMed Google Scholar). The γ chain was originally identified in mast cells as a component of the high affinity IgE receptor, FcεRI, but has subsequently been found in macrophages in the absence of the α-chain of FcεRI (14Blank U. Ra C. Miller L. White K. Metzger H. Kinet J.-P. Nature. 1989; 337: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Thus, although expressed in different cell types, the ligand recognition subunits (α-chains) of FcγRI and FcεRI are able to use the same signal-transducing molecule. Recently, FcεRI has been shown to mobilize calcium transients in a mast cell line through the activation of a novel pathway involving sphingosine kinase (15Choi O.H. Kim J.-H. Kinet J.-P. Nature. 1996; 380: 634-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). However, the precise details of the signaling pathway and its relationship to tyrosine kinase activation are as yet unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that FcγRI mobilizes calcium from intracellular stores by activating sphingosine kinase in the absence of phospholipase C activation and resultant generation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3). We also show that FcγRI-stimulated activation of sphingosine kinase is downstream of phospholipase D activation and that both these enzymes are dependent on tyrosine kinase activation. Moreover, activation of this pathway is necessary and sufficient to account for intracellular calcium mobilization after FcγRI aggregation in cytokine-primed U937 cells and for efficient vesicular trafficking of internalized immune complexes for degradation. U937 cells, a human monocyte cell line (16Harris P. Ralph P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1985; 37: 407-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), treated with 200 ng/ml interferon-γ for 18 h were used for all experiments (8Davis W. Sage S.O. Allen J.M. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Harrison P.T. Davis W. Norman J.C. Hockaday A.R. Allen J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24396-24402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the biochemical assays, approximately 3 × 106 cells were harvested and incubated with 1 μm human monomeric IgG (Serotec) to occupy surface FcγRI. Unbound IgG was removed by dilution and centrifugation of the cells. The cells were resuspended in ice-cold Hepes-buffered saline (HBS), and cross-linking antibody (goat anti-human IgG, 1:100 dilution) was added. The cells were then warmed to 37 °C and harvested at specified times for biochemical assay. Where the low affinity receptor was specifically aggregated using anti-FcγRIIa, the cells were loaded with the monoclonal antibody 2e1 (1 μg) (Serotec) in the presence of saturating concentrations (3 μm) of human IgG4 (to block binding of the Fc portion of 2e1 to FcγRI). After removal of excess antibody, anti-FcγRIIa was aggregated by the addition of goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab) (1:100 dilution). Sphingosine kinase was assayed as described by Olivera et al. (18Olivera A. Rosenthal J. Spiegel S. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were terminated at the times specified in the figures by the addition of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in ice-cold 0.1m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20% glycerol, 1 mm mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, phosphatase inhibitors (20 mm ZnCl2, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, and 15 mm sodium fluoride), protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF), and 0.5 mm 4-deoxypyridoxine. Cells were disrupted by freeze thawing and centrifuged at 105,000 ×g for 90 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were assayed for sphingosine kinase activity using sphingosine (Sigma) and [γ32P]ATP (2 μCi, 5 mm) as specified by Olivera et al. (18Olivera A. Rosenthal J. Spiegel S. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). After incubation, products were separated by TLC on silica gel G60 using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (90:90:15:6) and visualized by autoradiography. The radioactive spots corresponding to sphingosine phosphate were scraped and counted in a scintillation counter. Sphingosine 1-phosphate concentrations were measured as described by Olivera and Spiegel (19Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were preincubated overnight (15 h) in media containing [3H]serine (20 μCi ml) to label cellular sphingolipids and free sphingosine pools. Following labeling, the cells were washed in ice-cold RPMI 1640, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (RHB medium) and resuspended in ice-cold RHB medium containing 0.1 mml-canaline and the pyridoxal phosphate analog 4-deoxypyridoxine (0.5 mm) to inhibit the pyridoxal-dependent sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase. Cells were then stimulated by the addition of cross-linking antibody and warming to 37 °C, and the reactions were terminated at specified times. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the lipids were extracted and analyzed by TLC on silica gel G60 using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (90:90:15:6). Standard sphingosine 1-phosphate was applied with the samples, and the lipids were visualized using iodine vapors. Bands corresponding to sphingosine 1-phosphate were excised from the plate and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Results were calculated as a percentage of the total radioactivity incorporated in the lipids. Data presented are the mean ± S.D. of triplicate measurements, and the results shown are representative of three different experiments. Inositol phosphates were assayed essentially as described by Harnett and Harnett (20Harnett W. Harnett M.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4829-4837PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, U937 cells were labeled with myo-[3H]inositol (1 μCi/106 cells) for 16 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed three times and resuspended (at 1–3 × 107cells/ml) in RHB medium, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. Following stimulation, the cells were harvested, resuspended in 100 μl of HBS, transferred to glass trident vials, and extracted by the addition of 0.94 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2) on ice for 10 min. A Bligh-Dyer phase separation was achieved by the addition of 0.31 ml of chloroform and 0.31 ml of water, vortexing, and centrifugation at 270 ×g for 5 min. Levels of [3H]InsP3or total [3H]inositol phosphates (reaction mixture containing 10 mm LiCl) were determined by liquid scintillation counting of fractions eluted following Dowex (formate form) ion exchange chromatography of aliquots of the aqueous phase. Results were calculated as a percentage of the total radioactivity incorporated in the lipids. Data presented are the mean ± S.D. of triplicate measurements, and the results shown are representative of three different experiments. Mass DAG was measured as described by Briscoeet al. (21Briscoe C.P. Plevin R. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The lower organic phase of Bligh-Dyer extractions was dried in vacuo, and the lipids were solubilized in a Triton X-100/phosphatidylserine mixture. Briefly, phosphatidylserine (30 μl; supplied as 25 mm stock from Lipid Products) was dried under nitrogen and then probe-sonicated in 2.5 ml of 10 mm imidazole buffer, pH 6.6, containing 0.6% (w/v) Triton X-100, until the solution was optically clear. Aliquots (50 μl) were added to the lipid samples, which were then sonicated in a bath for 30 min. Once sonicated, 20 μl of 250 mmimidazole buffer, pH 6.6, containing 250 mm NaCl, 62.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 μl of freshly prepared 100 mm dithiothreitol was added to the solubilized lipid. Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase (Calbiochem) was added to a final concentration of 50 milliunits/ml, and the reaction was started by the addition of 10 μl of 5 mm ATP containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP made up in 100 mm imidazole, pH 6.6; this results in a final ATP concentration of 0.5 mm in a final reaction volume of 100 μl. The tubes were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of chloroform/methanol/HCl (150:300:2). After 10 min, 300 μl of chloroform and 400 μl of H2O are added. The tubes are vortexed and centrifuged at 270 × g for 5 min to promote phase splitting and washed once with 1 ml of a synthetic upper phase. The samples were then dried in vacuo and solubilized in 40 μl of chloroform/methanol (19:1), and 20 μl was spotted onto silica TLC plate (Whatman catalog no. 4861720, 10 × 20 cm K6F). The plates were developed in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (38:9:4.5), and radiolabeled bands were located by autoradiography or phosphor imaging. The phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) band (relative to standards) was scraped into scintillation vials, scintillant was added, and the associated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. PLD activity was measured by the transphosphatidylation assay (21Briscoe C.P. Plevin R. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, U937 cells were labeled (106 cells/ml) with [3H]palmitic acid (5 μCi/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum for 16 h. Following labeling, the cells were washed in ice-cold RHB medium, resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml, and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in RHB medium containing butan-1-ol (0.3% final). Specific Fc receptors were cross-linked as described above, and after the times indicated, cells were extracted by Bligh-Dyer phase separation. An aliquot of the lower organic phase was removed and dried down under vacuum (Jouan, catalog number RC1022), and the samples were redissolved in 25 μl of chloroform/methanol (19:1, v/v), containing 40 μg of unlabeled phosphatidylbutanol (Lipid Products, South Nutfield, Surrey, UK) as standard, and applied to prerun, heat-activated TLC plates (20 × 20 cm, Silica gel 150A grooved plates, Whatman). The plates were developed in the organic phase of the solvent, ethyl acetate/2,2,4-trimethylpentane/acetic acid/water (11:5:2:10) for approximately 90 min, and the position of the phosphatidylbutanol product was detected using iodine vapor. [3H]PtdBut-containing silica indicated by the phosphatidylbutanol standard was then scraped into scintillation fluid and counted. Results were calculated as a percentage of the total radioactivity incorporated in the lipids. Data presented are the mean ± S.D. of triplicate measurements, and the results shown are representative of three different experiments. U937 cells were loaded with human IgG and cross-linked as described earlier. After washing in PBS, the cells were lysed with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml CLAP (1 mg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin), 1 mm sodium orthophosphate, and 1 mm sodium fluoride for 30 min. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min, and the cell lysates were incubated with an agarose-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (clone 4G 10; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) at 4 °C overnight. Phosphotyrosine proteins were then harvested by centrifugation of the agarose beads and were then dissociated from the beads by boiling in sample buffer (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.53Google Scholar) containing 50 mm dithiothreitol for 15 min. Samples were run in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (0.2-μm pore size) as described by Towbi et al. (24Towbi H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44841) Google Scholar). The presence of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was then detected by Western blotting with a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G 10; Upstate Biotechnology). Western blots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cytosolic calcium was measured in cell populations at 37 °C using a Cairn Research Spectrophotometer as described previously (8Davis W. Sage S.O. Allen J.M. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were loaded with Fura2 and human monomeric IgG in HBS supplemented with 1 mmCa2+ to prevent depletion of calcium stores. After dilution and centrifugation to remove excess dye and antibody, the cells were resuspended in a small volume of HBS, 1 mm Ca2+to give a final density of 106 cells/100 μl. From this, cells were added to stirred cuvettes containing 1.4 ml of nominally Ca2+-free HBS (at 37 °C) in a Cairn Spectrophotometer system (Cairn Research Ltd.). Excitation wavelengths of 340, 360, and 380 nm were provided by a filter wheel rotating at 35 Hz in the light path. Emitted light was filtered by a 485-nm-long pass filter, and samples were averaged to give a data point every 500 ms. The background-corrected 340/380 ratio was calibrated using the method of Grynkiewicz et al. (25Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Following each experiment, cells were lysed by the addition of 50 μm digitonin in the presence of external 2 mm Ca2+ to give anRmax value. Rmin was subsequently determined by the addition of 20 mm EGTA (pH 7.4) in the presence of an equimolar concentration of Tris base. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-treated cells were harvested and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then loaded with 125I-labeled IgG as described previously (17Harrison P.T. Davis W. Norman J.C. Hockaday A.R. Allen J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24396-24402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After removal of nonbound radiolabel by dilution and centrifugation, cross-linking antibody was added, and the cells were warmed to 37 °C for the given times. The rate of endocytosis was assessed by measuring the rate of internalization of radiolabeled surface immune complexes. At time 0, triplicate aliquots of cells were harvested into ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4), and this was counted in a Packard γ-counter to provide a measure of the total counts bound to the cell surface. To measure the proportion of radiolabeled immune complexes internalized after incubation at 37 °C, any surface-bound radiolabeled immune complexes can be stripped from the cell by incubating the cells in ice-cold acidified PBS (pH 2.0) (17Harrison P.T. Davis W. Norman J.C. Hockaday A.R. Allen J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24396-24402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled immune complexes that have been internalized remain trapped inside the cell and cannot be released by this acid wash. Thus, to assess the rate of internalization, aliquots of cells were transferred at given times into ice-cold acidified PBS (pH 2.0) for 5 min to strip off cell surface radiolabeled immune complexes (17Harrison P.T. Davis W. Norman J.C. Hockaday A.R. Allen J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24396-24402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were then centrifuged, and the pellets were counted in a Packard γ-counter to yield the counts that had been internalized, or the cell-associated counts. The cell-associated counts for each time point were then expressed as the percentage of total counts bound at time 0 to provide a measure of the rate of internalization of the immune complexes. After warming the cells to 37 °C for long time intervals, the proportion of cell-associated counts was observed to fall. To determine whether this reduction in cell-associated counts represented degradation of the immune complexes, the supernatant following the cell incubation was examined for the presence of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radiolabel indicating that the radiolabeled IgG had been degraded. Thus, cells were also harvested at the same time points to measure the rate of degradation of the internalized counts. Cells were centrifuged, the supernatants were harvested, and trichloroacetic acid was then added to these supernatants. After incubation on ice for 60 min, the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were counted to provide a measure of the trichloroacetic acid-soluble counts in the supernatant. The results were expressed as a percentage of the initial cell-associated counts at time 0. The results shown are the mean ± S.D. of triplicate measurements and are representative of three different experiments. In IFN-γ-primed U937 cells, aggregation of FcγRI with surface-bound immune complexes results in calcium transients in the form of a single spike (see Ref. 8Davis W. Sage S.O. Allen J.M. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 A). The FcγRI-associated accessory transducing molecule, γ-chain, has recently been reported to mobilize calcium via activation of sphingosine kinase when coupled to the high affinity IgE receptor, FcεRI (15Choi O.H. Kim J.-H. Kinet J.-P. Nature. 1996; 380: 634-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Thus, to compare the nature of this FcγRI-calcium response to that of FcεRI, the effect of dl-threo-dihydrosphingosine (DHS) on the release of calcium from intracellular stores was determined. Pretreatment of cells with 25 μm DHS completely abolished the FcγRI-mediated rise in cytosolic calcium, indicating that intracellular calcium stores are mobilized in these cells in a similar fashion to that observed for FcεRI in mast cells (15Choi O.H. Kim J.-H. Kinet J.-P. Nature. 1996; 380: 634-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The calcium stores were intact in cells treated with DHS, since the subsequent addition of thapsigargin (250 nm) resulted in a prompt increase in cytosolic calcium, thereby demonstrating that the failure to observe a rise in calcium following aggregation of FcγRI in cells pretreated with DHS was not secondary to depletion of intracellular calcium stores. Since DHS acts as a competitive inhibitor of sphingosine kinase, the activity of this enzyme after FcγRI aggregation was next assessed. Aggregation of FcγRI stimulated a prompt increase in sphingosine kinase activity, which was detectable within 30 s (Fig. 1 B). Sphingosine kinase activation by FcγRI aggregation in these cytokine-primed cells was dependent on tyrosine kinase activation, since treatment of the cells with genistein (0.37 mm) completely abolished the response (Fig. 1 B). Pretreatment with genistein at a lower concentration (0.1 mm) also completely inhibited FcγRI activation of sphingosine kinase (Fig. 1 C), although concentrations below this only resulted in partial inhibition (Fig. 1 C). In parallel with the activation of sphingosine kinase, FcγRI aggregation resulted in a prompt increase in the concentration of sphingosine 1-phosphate in these cells (Fig. 1 D). The concentration of sphingosine 1-phosphate peaked 30 s after receptor aggregation, and although levels fell gradually thereafter, concentrations remained elevated above control values 5 min after receptor aggregation. Pretreatment of cells with genistein (0.37 mm) completely abolished the FcγRI-mediated increase in sphingosine 1-phosphate generation. Since immune complex aggregation of FcγRI has previously been reported to lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ1 (5Liao F. Shin H.S. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3659-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) with presumed generation of InsP3 and DAG, the role of this phospholipid signaling pathway in mediating the cytosolic calcium response was also investigated. Surprisingly, no increase in InsP3 could be detected (data not shown). Since InsP3 generation can be transient in nature, the accumulation of total inositol phosphates (InsPs) was measured to ensure that any small transient InsPs signals did not go undetected. No accumulation of total InsPs over 20 min could be detected in IFN-γ-primed U937 cells after aggregation of FcγRI (Fig. 2 A). Phospholipase C signaling was, however, functional in these cells, since aggregation of a related immune receptor, the low affinity IgG receptor (FcγRIIa), using monoclonal antibodies resulted in an easily measurable accumulation of InsP3 (data not shown) and total InsPs (Fig. 2 A). Unlike FcγRI, the low affinity receptor possesses an integral, albeit unconventional, immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif in its cytoplasmic tail; the tyrosine residues are separated by an unusually long intervening sequence (26Stengelin S. Stamenkovic I. Seed B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that the high affinity receptor, FcγRI, mobilizes calcium stores through a novel pathway that, unlike the low affinity receptor (FcγRIIa), does not involve InsP3. Interestingly, despite the lack of generation of InsPs over 20 min, mass DAG concentrations were elevated following aggregation of FcγRI (Fig. 2 B). Thus, in an attempt to delineate alternative lipid signaling pathways involved in mediating the response to FcγRI, DAG was measured in the presence of 0.3% butan-1-ol to block the generation of DAG derived from PtdOH resulting from PLD activation (21Briscoe C.P. Plevin R. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the primary alcohol, butan-1-ol, traps the phosphatidyl-moiety generated by PLD-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine as PtdBut; PtdBut is not a substrate for the enzyme, phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase, that converts PtdOH to DAG (21Briscoe C.P. Plevin R. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). FcγRI-coupled DAG was indeed shown to be derived from PtdOH generated by phospholipase D activation, since pretreating cells with 0.3% butan-1-ol completely abolished the receptor-stimulated rise in mass levels of DAG (Fig. 2 B). Activation of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D (PtdCho-PLD) following aggregation of FcγRI was demonstrated by the definitive transphosphatidylation assay (21Briscoe C.P. Plevin R. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These experiments showed that aggregation of Fcγ receptors in IFN-γ-primed, [3H]palmitate-labeled cells stimulated activation of PtdCho-PLD, as evidenced by substantial generation of [3H]PtdBut, in the presence of butan-1-ol, over a 30-min time course (Fig. 2 C). Higher concentrations of butan-1-ol (1%) resulted in no further increase in measured [3H]PtdBut compared with cells incubated with 0.3% butan-1-ol, indicating that all of the phosphatidyl moiety generated by PtdCho-PLD is trapped at the lower concentration of primary alcohol. Lower concentrations of butan-1-ol (0.1%) resulted in less measurable [3H]PtdBut. Thus, the optimal concentration of butan-1-ol to trap the phosphatidyl moiety is 0.3% (Fig. 2 D). The specificity of the measurement was confirmed using butan-2-ol, which is unable to trap the phosphatidyl moiety generated by PtdCho-PLD. No [3H]PtdBut could be detected in cells preincubated with butan-2-ol even at 1% preincubation. The increase in PtdCho-PLD activity following receptor aggregation was tyrosine kinase-dependent, since it was completely abolished by treating the cells with genistein. Moreover, the concentration dependence of genistein-mediated inhibition of PtdCho-PLD (Fig. 2 E) showed a similar profile to that obtained for sphingosine kinase coupling (Fig. 1 C). Thus, FcγRI is coupled through tyrosine kinases to the activation of PtdCho-PLD and sphingosine kinase. To assess the relative relationship of activation of PtdCho-PLD and sphingosine kinase, studies"
https://openalex.org/W2002156069,"Mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1) are linked to early onset of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) and are shown to foster production of Aβ1–42/43 in FAD patients and transgenic mice. PS1 null mice are embryonic lethal and exhibit axial skeleton malformation and CNS defects. We show that transgenic mouse lines expressing either the wild-type human PS1 protein or human PS1 with the A246E FAD mutation can rescue the PS1 knockout mouse from embryonic lethality to similar degrees, indicating that the mutation does not lead to loss of PS1 function during development. Furthermore, a 50% reduction of PS1 activity in PS1+/− mice does not lead to Aβ1–42/43 increase, whereas expression of human mutant PS1 on murine PS1 null background is sufficient to elevate Aβ1–42/43, supporting a gain-of-function activity as the result of the PS1 mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2015762216,"Pseudoknot formation folds the 3′ ends of many plant viral genomic RNAs into structures that resemble transfer RNA in global folding and in their reactivity to transfer RNA–specific proteins. The solution structure of the pseudoknotted T arm and acceptor arm of the transfer RNA–like structure of turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The molecule is stabilized by the hairpin formed by the 5′ end of the RNA, and by the intricate interactions related to the loops of the pseudoknot. Loop 1 spans the major groove of the helix with only two of its four nucleotides. Loop 2, which crosses the minor groove, interacts closely with its opposing helix, in particular through hydrogen bonds with a highly conserved adenine. The structure resulting from this interaction between the minor groove and single-stranded RNA at helical junctions displays internal mobility, which may be a general feature of RNA pseudoknots that regulates their interaction with proteins or other RNA molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2054196099,"Spontaneous neuronal activity plays an important role in the development of cortical circuitry, yet its spatio-temporal dynamics are poorly understood. Cajal-Retzius (CR) neurons in developing layer 1 are necessary for correct cortical lamination and are strategically located to coordinate early circuit activity. To characterize the spontaneous activity of CR and other layer 1 neurons during cortical development, we imaged calcium transients in populations of layer 1 neurons in hemispheres and slices from postnatal rat somato-sensory neocortex. The spontaneous activity in layer 1 had complex spatio-temporal patterns. Groups of non-CR cells showed synchronous activations and formed networks of correlated neurons superimposed in the same territory. Correlated activity among non-CR cells was mediated by a depolarizing effect of GABA and was modulated by glutamate, probably released by CR cells. Our findings demonstrate that developing layer 1 can sustain complex patterns of correlated activity and reveal a circuit mechanism that can mediate this patterned activity."
https://openalex.org/W2113831400,"Mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1) cosegregate with ∼25% of early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) pedigrees. A variety of in vitro and in vivo paradigms have established that one mechanism by which PS1 variants cause AD is by elevating the production of highly amyloidogenic Aβ1–42/43 peptides. PS1 is homologous to sel-12, a C. elegans protein that facilitates signaling mediated by the Notch/lin-12 family of receptors. Wild-type human PS1 complements an egg-laying defect in C. elegans lacking sel-12, while FAD-linked PS1 variants exhibit reduced rescue activity. These data suggested that mutant PS1 may cause disease as a result of reduction in PS1 function. To test the function of FAD-linked PS1 in mammals, we examined the ability of the A246E PS1 variant to complement the embryonic lethality and axial skeletal defects in mice lacking PS1. Finally, to examine the influence of reduced PS1 levels on Aβ production, we quantified Aβ1–42/43 peptide levels in PS1 heterozygous null mice (PS1+/− mice). We now report that both human wild-type and A246E PS1 efficiently rescue the phenotypes observed in PS1−/− embryos, findings consistent with the view that FAD-linked PS1 mutants retain sufficient normal function during mammalian embryonic development. Moreover, the levels of Aβ1–42/43 and Aβ1–40 peptides between PS1+/− and control mice are indistinguishable. Collectively, these data lead us to conclude that mutant PS1 causes AD not by loss of normal PS1 function but by influencing amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing in a manner that elevates Aβ1–42/43 production."

This may indicate that most CAIs formed in a restricted region of the solar nebula and were then unevenly distributed throughout the various chondrite accretion regions. The Semarkona CAI is isotopically homogeneous and contains highly 16 O-enriched melilite, supporting the hypothesis that all CAI minerals were originally 16 O-rich, but that in most carbonaceous chondrite inclusions some minerals exchanged oxygen isotopes with an external reservoir following crystallization."

Slob also coimmunoprecipitates with the Drosophila EAG potassium channel but not with Drosophila Shaker, mouse Slowpoke, or rat Kv1.3. Confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrates that Slob and dSlo redistribute in cotransfected cells and are colocalized in large intracellular structures. Direct application of Slob to the cytoplasmic face of detached membrane patches containing dSlo channels leads to an increase in channel activity.

https://openalex.org/W2001408976,"We describe the genetic and kinetic defects in a congenital myasthenic syndrome caused by heteroallelic mutations of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) ε subunit gene. The mutations are an in-frame duplication of six residues in the long cytoplasmic loop (ε1254ins18) and a cysteine-loop null mutation (εC128S). The ε1254ins18 mutation causes mode switching in the kinetics of receptor activation in which three modes activate slowly and inactivate rapidly. The ε1245ins18-AChR at the endplate shows abnormally brief activation episodes during steady state agonist application and appears electrically silent during the synaptic response to acetylcholine. The phenotypic consequences are endplate AChR deficiency, simplification of the postsynaptic region, and compensatory expression of fetal AChR that restores electrical activity at the endplate and rescues the phenotype."

To test the hypothesis that urea transport involves passage through an aqueous channel, osmotic water permeability was measured in Xenopus oocytes expressing UTs. The UT3 class of urea transporters functioned as efficient water channels. Quantitative measurement of single channel water permeability (pf) using epitope-tagged rat UTs gavepf (in cm3/s × 10−14) of 0.14 ± 0.11 (UT2) and 1.4 ± 0.2 (UT3), compared with 6.0 and 2.3 for water channels AQP1 and AQP3, respectively. Relative single channel urea permeabilities (purea) were 1.0 (UT2), 0.44 (UT3), and 0.0 (AQP1). UT3-mediated water and urea transport were weakly temperature-dependent (activation energy <4 kcal/mol), inhibited > 75% by the urea transport inhibitor 1,3-dimethylthiourea, but not inhibited by the water transport inhibitor HgCl2. To test for a common water/urea pore, the urea reflection coefficient (ςurea) was measured by independent induced osmosis and solvent dragmethods. In UT3-expressing oocytes, the time course of oocyte volume in response to different urea gradients (induced osmosis) gave ςurea ∼0.3 for the UT3 pathway, in agreement with ςurea determined by the increase in uptake of [14C]urea during osmotic gradient-induced oocyte swelling (solvent drag).

Several related urea transporters (UTs) 1The abbreviation used is: UT(s), urea transporter(s). 1The abbreviation used is: UT(s), urea transporter(s). have been cloned recently. The UT2 transporter (rat form referred to as rUT2, Ref. 1Smith C.P. Lee W.S. Martial S. Knepper M.A. You G. Sands J.M. Hediger M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1556-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) was first identified in rabbit by expression cloning (2You G. Smith C.P. Kanal Y. Lee W.S. Stelzner M. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The UT2 cDNA encodes a 397-amino acid glycoprotein that is expressed in the medullary portion of descending limbs of Henle in kidney (3Nielsen S. Terris J. Smith C.P. Hediger M.A. Ecelbarger C.A.

Physiol. 1997; 272: F654-F660PubMed Google Scholar). UT1 is larger protein (929 amino acids) that contains the UT2 sequence at its C terminus fused to a 67% identical amino acid sequence at its N terminus (5Shayakul C. Steel A. Hediger M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2580-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). UT1 functions a cAMP-regulated urea transporter that is expressed at the apical membrane of inner medullary collecting duct cells. UT1 and UT2 are thought to be derived from a single gene by alternative splicing. A 391-amino acid urea transporter expressed in erythrocytes was initially cloned from human bone marrow (HUT11, Ref.6Olives B. Neau P. Bailly P. Hediger M.A. Rousselet G. Cartron J.P. Ripoche P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31649-31652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently from rat kidney (named UT3, Ref. 7Tsukaguchi H. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Tokui T. Brown D. Hediger M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1506-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Rat UT3 has 62% amino acid identity to UT2 and is expressed strongly in kidney in descending vasa recta in the inner stripe of outer medulla, as well as in testis and brain (7Tsukaguchi H.

Cartron J.P. Rondeau E. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 138-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It is thought that these urea transporters have an important role in the urinary concentrating mechanism to establish a hypertonic renal medullary interstitium (9Sands J.M. Timmer R.T. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F321-F339PubMed Google Scholar). UT3 was initially recognized as the Kidd antigen (Jk) in erythrocytes (10Frohlich O. Macey R.I. Edwards-Moulds J. Gargus J.J. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: F778-C783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Olives B. Mattei M.G. Huet M. Neau P. Martial S. Cartron J.P. Bailly P. J. Biol.

Humans lacking the Kidd antigen (Jk−/−) have low erythrocyte urea permeability. These individuals are phenotypically grossly normal, but have a defect in their ability to produce a maximally concentrated urine (13Sands J.M. Gargus J.J. Frohlich O. Gunn R.B. Kokko J.P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1992; 2: 1689-1696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From the number of Kidd antigen proteins per erythrocyte and the erythrocyte urea permeability, it was estimated that the UT3 turnover rate is 2–15 × 106urea molecules/s (9Sands J.M. Timmer R.T. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F321-F339PubMed Google Scholar, 14Mannuzzu L.M. Moronne M.M. Nichols M.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 133: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This turnover rate is substantially higher than that of usual solute carriers, suggesting a channel mechanism for urea transport. Additional functional data involving urea concentration dependence and trans-inhibition (15Yousef L.W. Macey R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 984: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) support a channel-type mechanism. The purpose of this study was to test whether urea transporters of the UT3-type (and possibly the UT2-type) transport urea by a channel mechanism involving urea passage through an aqueous pore. It was found that UT3 functions as an efficient water channel with water transport rates comparable with those of aquaporin-type water channels. Water movement through UT3 was weakly temperature-dependent and inhibited by urea transport inhibitors but not by water transport inhibitors. A key finding was that the reflection coefficient for urea was remarkably less than unity, providing strong evidence for a common water and urea pathway through UT3. These results have important implications regarding urea transporter structure and transporting mechanism and suggest a novel role for UT3 in the urinary concentrating mechanism as a facilitator of urea solvent drag in renal vasa recta. Full-length cDNAs encoding rat AQP1 (GenBank™ accession number L07268), AQP3 (GenBank™ accession numberD17695), UT2 (GenBank™ accession number U09957), and UT3 (GenBank™ accession number U81518) were polymerase chain reaction-amplified using rat kidney cDNA as template and primers (BamHI orBglII and XbaI engineered restriction sites underlined): AQP1 sense, 5′-CGGGATCCATGGCCAGCGAGTTAAAGAAGA-3′; AQP1-antisense, 5′-GCTCTAGATTTGGGCTTCATCTCCACCCTG-3′; AQP3 sense, 5′-CGGGATCCATGAACCGTTGCGGGGAGATGC-3′; AQP3-antisense, 5′-GCTCTAGAGATCTGCTCCTTGTGCTTCATG-3′; UT2 sense, 5′-CGAGATCTATGGAGGAGAGCTCTGAGATAA-3′; UT2 antisense, 5′-GCTCTAGAGGAGACGTCGTAGGCCTGGTAC-3′; UT3 sense, 5′-CGAGATCTATGGAAGATATTCCCACTATGG-3′; UT3 antisense, 5′-GCTCTAGATTACAGCGGGCGGTCGACCGCGCTT-3′. Amplified DNA fragments was confirmed by sequence analysis and subcloned into oocyte expression plasmid (pSP64T-N-c-Myc) (16Yang B. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16140-16146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The constructs encoded fusion proteins consisting of each full-length aquaporin or urea transporter fused downstream and in-frame from a 10-amino acid human c-Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL). Complementary RNA was transcribed in vitro using SP6 polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 5 μg of plasmid DNA in a 100-μl volume at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of diguanosine triphosphate (1A250 unit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Plasmid DNA was digested with RNase-free DNase (Invitrogen), extracted with phenol-chloroform, precipitated twice in ethanol, and suspended in distilled water. Stage V and VI oocytes from Xenopus laeviswere isolated and defolliculated with collagenase in Barth's buffer (200 mosm). Oocytes were microinjected with 50-nl samples of specified cRNAs (0–200 ng/μl) and incubated at 18 °C for 24 or 48 h. Osmotic water permeability (Pf) was measured from the time course of oocyte swelling at 10 °C in response to a 2- or 5-fold dilution of the extracellular Barth's buffer with distilled water. OocytePf was calculated from the initial rate of swelling as described previously (17Zhang R. Logee K. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15375-15378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, oocytes were incubated with 1,3-dimethylthiourea or phloretin for 30 min or HgCl2 for 5 min at 20 °C prior to and during permeability measurements. To determine urea reflection coefficient, oocytes were partially swelled in 0.2 ml of 1:1 diluted Barth's (100 mosm) for 30 s, and then 0.2 ml of water containing different concentrations of urea (0–1600 mm) was added (see below). To measure urea uptake, groups of 10 oocytes were incubated in 0.2 ml of Barth's buffer containing 3 μCi of [14C]urea (nonradioactive urea added to give 1 mm final [urea]) at 23 °C. After 0 or 90 s, or 2 h (to determine equilibrium incorporation), oocytes were washed four times rapidly in ice-cold Barth's buffer containing 1 mm unlabeled urea, and individual oocytes were dissolved in 5% SDS for scintillation counting. Data were expressed as percent 90-s [14C]urea uptake, where 100% refers to 2-h uptake. In some experiments, the incubation solution containing [14C]urea was made hypoosmolar (40 or 100 mosm) by dilution with distilled water or hyperosmolar (400 mosm) by addition of sucrose. Transport of water and urea across the oocyte plasma membrane is described quantitatively by the Kedem-Katchalsky equations of coupled water and solute transport (18Kedem O. Katchalsky A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1958; 27: 229-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar) adapted for channel-expressing oocytes,Jv=−pflipidvwS(ΔCi+Δ[urea])−pfchannelvwS(ΔCi+ςureaΔ[urea])Equation 1 Jurea=S(purealipid+pureachannel)Δ[urea]+Jvchannel(1−ςurea)〈urea〉Equation 2 where Jv is the volume flux (cm3/s) and Jurea the urea flux (mol/s) (inward flux defined as positive), ςurea the urea reflection coefficient, S the oocyte surface area (0.045 cm2), vw the partial molar volume of water (18 cm3/mol), and Pf and Purea the water and urea permeability coefficients (cm/s, “lipid” and “channel” superscripts refer to transport through lipid versus expressed channel). Jvchannel in Equation 2 refers to the second term in Equation 1. Concentration gradients of impermeant solutes (ΔCi) and urea (Δ[urea]) are defined as outside-inside differences, and <urea> is taken here as the outside urea concentration. Equations 1 and 2 were numerically integrated for determination of ςurea. Pflipid and Pfchannel were determined from water permeability measurements without and with cRNA expression, respectively; Purealipid and Pureachannel were determined similarly from [14C]urea uptake measurements. Metabolic labeling was performed by incubating groups of 10 oocytes for 24 h at 18 °C in 100 μl of Barth's buffer containing 50 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Oocytes were washed and plasma membrane complexes were peeled and collected. As described in detail previously (16Yang B. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16140-16146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), membranes were homogenized, solubilized in 100 mmβ-octyl glucoside, and immunoprecipitated using a mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads. Immunoprecipitated proteins were released from the beads in SDS loading buffer, resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, soaked in 15% (w/v) 2,5-diphenyloxazole in Me2SO, and exposed to hyperfilm (Amersham) at −70 °C for 5–14 days. Fig. 1 A shows the time course of osmotically induced swelling in control (water-injected) oocytes, oocytes expressing aquaporin water channels AQP1 and AQP3, and oocytes expressing urea transporters UT2 and UT3. Averaged water permeability coefficients (Pf) are summarized in Fig. 1 B. The large increase in Pf in oocytes expressing UT3 was an unexpected finding. Fig. 1 Cshows the 90-s uptake of [14C]urea for the same groups of oocytes. Urea permeability in oocytes expressing UT2 or UT3 was >12-fold increased over that in control and AQP1-expressing oocytes. To determine the intrinsic (per channel) water and urea permeabilities of the expressed AQPs and UTs, permeability values from Fig. 1,B and C, were normalized to account for differences in transporter expression at the plasma membrane. Oocytes expressing c-Myc epitope-tagged AQPs and UTs were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and c-Myc-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from microdissected oocyte plasma membranes. Fig. 1 D shows a representative autoradiogram of immunoprecipitated proteins. The protein sizes are in agreement with cDNA sequence and published immunoblot data. Absolute single channel water permeability coefficients (pf) were computed as described previously (16Yang B. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16140-16146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) using a reference pf of 6 × 10−14 cm3/s for AQP1. Pf (in cm3/s × 10−14, S.E., n = 3) were: 0.14 ± 0.11 (UT2), 1.4 ± 0.2 (UT3), and 2.3 ± 0.1 AQP3. Single channel urea permeabilities (purea), relative to that of UT2 (defined as 1.0) were: 0.44 (UT3), 0.0 (AQP1) and 0.02 (AQP3). The significant intrinsic water permeability of UT3 suggests the existence of a continuous aqueous channel through the UT3 protein that passes both water and urea. Studies of temperature dependence, inhibitor specificity, and urea reflection coefficient were done to test this possibility. Fig. 2 Ashows a weak temperature dependence for UT3-mediated transport of both water and urea. The low Arrhenius activation energy (<4 kcal/mol) is consistent with an aqueous pore pathway and is in agreement with the low activation energies found for several of the aquaporin-type water channels. Fig. 2 B indicates that UT3-mediated water and urea transport were each strongly inhibited by the urea analog 1,3-dimethylthiourea and by phloretin. Neither water nor urea transport were inhibited by HgCl2, a potent inhibitor of most aquaporin-type water channels. HgCl2, but not the urea transport inhibitors, strongly inhibited water permeability in oocytes expressing AQP1 (Fig. 2 C). Together these results support a common aqueous route for water and urea transport through UT3. The most direct evidence for a common water/solute pathway is the finding of a low solute reflection coefficient (19Finkelstein A. Water Movement through Lipid Bilayers, Pores, and Plasma Membranes: Theory and Reality. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar, 20Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C837-C850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reflection coefficient measurements have in general been challenging because of the tight coupling between volume and solute transport as described by Equations 1 and 2. Of note, different labs have reported substantially different reflection coefficients for urea transport across erythrocytes (21Goldstein D.A. Solomon A.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1960; 44: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 22Mlekoday H.J. Moore R. Levitt D.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 81: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and NaCl transport across proximal tubule (23Corman B. DiStefano A. Pfluegers Arch. 1983; 397: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 24Andreoli T.E. Schafer J.A. Troutman L.L. Watkins M.L. Am. J.

Our strategy to determine the urea reflection coefficient (ςurea) in oocytes involved independent measurements ofinduced osmosis and solvent drag, and quantitative comparison of experimental results with numerical solution of the Kedem-Katchalsky equations. In the induced osmosis method, oocytes were briefly swelled in 100 mm Barth's buffer (because oocytes do not shrink well below their normal volume, Ref. 26Zhang R. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C26-C34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and then the external solution was switched to 50 mm Barth's buffer containing different concentrations of urea. As seen in Fig. 3 A (top), oocytes expressing UT3 initially swelled for external [urea] of 200 and 400 mm and shrunk for [urea] of 600 and 800 mm, suggesting ςurea ≪ 1. The same measurements were simulated numerically using Equations 1 and 2 for different values of ςurea (Fig. 3 B). There was good agreement between the simulated and experimental data set for ςurea∼0.3. An important control study was done to validate the above approach for determination of ςurea and to show that the low ςurea is not a consequence of apparent solvent/solute coupling (“pseudo-solvent drag”) due to unstirred layers. An identical set of measurements (as in Fig. 3 A, top) was done in oocytes coexpressing AQP1, which is permeable to water but not urea, and UT2, which is permeable to urea and not water. The amounts of injected cRNAs encoding AQP1 and UT2 were adjusted to give oocyte water and urea permeabilities comparable with those for UT3-expressing oocytes. Fig. 3 A (bottom) shows little initial oocyte swelling or shrinking for external [urea] ∼200 mm, suggesting that ςurea ∼1. This result was confirmed by the simulated curves in Fig. 3 B(bottom). As an independent method to measure ςurea utilizingsolvent drag, the 90-s uptake of [14C]urea into oocytes was measured for different external solution osmolalities. For ςurea less than 1, the osmotic water influx induced by a low external osmolality would result in increased [14C]urea uptake (compared with no osmotic gradient) because of additive urea diffusion and solvent drag mechanisms (Equation 2). Fig. 3 C shows that [14C]urea uptake was significantly enhanced by hypoosmolar external solutions and depressed by a hyperosmolar solution. The model simulations for ςurea = 0.3 determined above were in reasonable agreement with the [14C]urea uptake data. Our results provide strong evidence that the UT3 protein is associated with an aqueous channel that transports water and urea in a coupled manner. The high UT3-mediated urea turnover and the trans-stimulation data cited in the Introduction are explainable by a common water/urea channel. Although electron crystallography data suggest the location of a putative aqueous pore through aquaporin-type water channels (27Cheng A. Van Hoek A.N. Yaeger M. Verkman A.S. Mitra A.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 28Walz T. Hirai T. Murata K. Heymann J.B. Mitsuoka K. Fujiyoshi Y. Smith B.L. Agre P. Engel A. Nature. 1997; 387: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), there is no structural information about the UT proteins to suggest the existence or location of an aqueous channel. Of note, the UT and AQP proteins share no homology. Structure and mutagenesis studies are needed to resolve the mechanism of UT3-mediated water and urea transport. Although not directly addressed in this study, we speculate about the physiological implications of a common water/urea channel in UT3. UT3 is expressed in descending vasa recta in kidney (7Tsukaguchi H. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Tokui T. Brown D. Hediger M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1506-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 8Xu Y. Olives B. Bailly P. Fischer E. Ripoche P. Ronco P. Cartron J.P. Rondeau E.

Physiol. 1994; 267: R260-F267PubMed Google Scholar). The countercurrent exchange mechanism in the renal medulla requires the delivery of large quantities of urea and water from the vasa recta to the inner medullary interstitium (30Kokko J.P. Rector F.C. Kidney Int. 1972; 2: 214-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 31Stephenson J.L.

The UT3-mediated solvent drag of urea could provide a simple and elegant solution to the problem of insuring an adequate rate of urea exit from vasa recta to balance osmotically driven water exit.

https://openalex.org/W2066497238,"Freshly isolated human monocytes do not express p125FAK but upon adherence to substrata activate the highly related calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase (CADTK), also known as Pyk2, CAKβ, RAFTK, and FAK2. The monocyte CADTK was 5 kDa smaller than protein from epithelial cells; isolation and sequencing of the monocyte CADTK cDNA revealed a predicted 42-amino acid deletion between the two proline-rich domains of the enzyme. The nucleic acid sequence suggests that the deletion is caused by alternative RNA splicing. This species was also found in T and B lymphocytes and appears to be the predominant form of cytoskeletal associated tyrosine kinase in non-neoplastic, circulating, hematopoietic cells. CADTK was not activated when monocytes maintained in suspension were treated with agents that produce an intracellular calcium (thapsigargin) or protein kinase C (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) signal including a chemokine, RANTES, that binds to the HIV co-receptor, CCK5. In contrast, monocyte adherence to tissue culture plastic-stimulated CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation, a process that was enhanced by thapsigargin, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and RANTES but that was completely blocked by preincubation with cytochalasin D. When compared with plastic, adherence to fibronectin- or collagen-coated surfaces produced only minimal CADTK activation but permitted significant stimulation by added thapsigargin. These data suggest that in a cell type that lacks p125FAK, CADTK plays an early role in post-adherence signaling. Its activation involves two stages, cytoskeletal engagement, which is permissive, and co-stimulatory signals (calcium or protein kinase C) generated by extensive cell surface engagement, agonists, or inflammatory chemokines. Freshly isolated human monocytes do not express p125FAK but upon adherence to substrata activate the highly related calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase (CADTK), also known as Pyk2, CAKβ, RAFTK, and FAK2. The monocyte CADTK was 5 kDa smaller than protein from epithelial cells; isolation and sequencing of the monocyte CADTK cDNA revealed a predicted 42-amino acid deletion between the two proline-rich domains of the enzyme. The nucleic acid sequence suggests that the deletion is caused by alternative RNA splicing. This species was also found in T and B lymphocytes and appears to be the predominant form of cytoskeletal associated tyrosine kinase in non-neoplastic, circulating, hematopoietic cells. CADTK was not activated when monocytes maintained in suspension were treated with agents that produce an intracellular calcium (thapsigargin) or protein kinase C (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) signal including a chemokine, RANTES, that binds to the HIV co-receptor, CCK5. In contrast, monocyte adherence to tissue culture plastic-stimulated CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation, a process that was enhanced by thapsigargin, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and RANTES but that was completely blocked by preincubation with cytochalasin D. When compared with plastic, adherence to fibronectin- or collagen-coated surfaces produced only minimal CADTK activation but permitted significant stimulation by added thapsigargin. These data suggest that in a cell type that lacks p125FAK, CADTK plays an early role in post-adherence signaling. Its activation involves two stages, cytoskeletal engagement, which is permissive, and co-stimulatory signals (calcium or protein kinase C) generated by extensive cell surface engagement, agonists, or inflammatory chemokines. Peripheral monocytes circulate until they encounter an injured or activated endothelial surface to which the receptors of the monocyte adhere (1Beekhuizen H. Van Furth R. J.

In this report we demonstrate a third type of cell exemplified by freshly isolated monocytes, which express CADTK but not p125FAK. In addition, CADTK activation in monocytes and epithelial cells is apparently a two-stage process involving a permissive cytoskeletal engagement step and an additional intracellular calcium or PKC signal. The concept of a hierarchy in adherence-dependent signaling in monocyte endothelial interactions is well established and may be reflected in the two-stage activation of CADTK. Human monocytes were isolated from randomly selected, healthy donors as described previously (17Lofquist A.K. Mondal K. Morris J.S. Haskill J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1737-1746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified monocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% autologous serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. When cultured adherently, 5 × 106 to 5 × 107 monocytes were plated on polystyrene tissue culture dishes (Corning) or fibronectin (Becton Dickenson) or collagen Type IV (Sigma) coated culture dishes. Nonadherent monocytes were incubated in polystyrene tubes (Falcon) at cell concentration 106cells/ml. Rat liver epithelial cells (GN4) were cultured as described (9Earp H.S. Huckle W.R. Dawson T.L. Li X. Graves L.M. Dy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28440-28447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with CADTK (21Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) or p125FAK antibody (A-17 or C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and analyzed as described (10Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G.

Total cellular RNA from purified monocytes was isolated by the guanidimium isothiocyanate-CsCl method, and subsequently reverse transcribed with random hexamers as primers (17Lofquist A.K. Mondal K. Morris J.S. Haskill J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1737-1746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three sets of PCR primers, which cover N-terminal (5′-CTTAGCTGCTGCCTGAGAGG-3′, 5′-CAGCTGAAGTACTGCCTGGC-3′), catalytic (5′-GCCAGGCAGTACTTCAGCTG-3′, 5′-CCAGCAGCGGGTCATGAGGG-3′), and C-terminal domains (5′-CCCTCATGACCCGCTGCTGG-3′, 5′-GGTGGCCCCCACCCTCCGTC-3′) of human CADTK (Pyk2), were used to amplify the entire first strand cDNA from monocytes. PCR-amplified products were then cloned and sequenced. Cellular RNA of T and B cell lines were kindly provided by Drs. Beverly Mitchell and Nancy Raab-Traub, respectively. First strand cDNAs were made by a Superscript™ preamplification system according to the manufacturer's (Life Technologies, Inc.) protocol. The C-terminal PCR primers were used to distinguish between the full-length and 126-base pair-deleted isoforms. We adhered freshly isolated, lymphocyte-depleted monocytes (an approximately 95% pure population) to plastic tissue culture dishes for 30 min and immunoprecipitated CADTK and p125FAK. Comparison with parallel immunoprecipitates from angiotensin II (Ang II)-treated GN4 rat liver epithelial cells revealed tyrosine phosphorylated CADTK in both cell types; however, the monocyte CADTK immunoreactive species had a faster electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast to GN4 cells, monocytes lacked p125FAK (Fig. 1 C). We have noted, under less stringent conditions,i.e. those not involving preplating with autologous serum, that p125FAK-containing, large, platelet-like entities were found in the monocyte preparations. With our technique, these were eliminated and p125FAK was absent. Monocyte CADTK had an estimated molecular mass of 110 kDa versus 115 kDa in GN4 cells. This could result from cell type-specific phosphorylation, antibody cross-reaction with yet another member of the p125FAK family, proteolysis, or an encoded isoform. We used RNA from freshly prepared human peripheral monocytes to isolate and sequence the entire CADTK coding region. The monocyte CADTK cDNA sequence was almost identical to human Pyk2 with an exception, a 126-base pair deletion resulting in a molecule missing 42 amino acids between the two CADTK SH3 binding proline-rich domains (Fig. 2, A and B). Examination of the nucleic acid sequence reveals potential splice donor sites at the junctions of the deletion, suggesting that this isoform may be generated by alternative RNA splicing (Fig. 2 C). A similar set of splice donor acceptor sites is found in the rat CADTK sequence, suggesting the capability of forming this splice variant in other species. CADTK (and p125FAK) has two proline-rich domains; this deletion could influence the local tertiary structure, thereby changing individual CADTK-SH3 interactions (e.g. with p130Cas). Alternatively, the simultaneous interaction of SH3 domains from different molecules with the two proline-rich regions of CADTK would be influenced by the different spacing between the two regions due to the 42-amino acid deletion. In addition, the deleted sequence is rich in prolines and serines characteristic of PEST-like sequences whose deletion might change the susceptibility to proteolysis (18Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsterimer M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar),i.e. foreshortened CADTK could be more long-lived. Lymphocyte CADTK (Pyk2/RAFTK) is activated by T cell receptor engagement (19Qian D. Lev S. van Oers N.S.C. Dikic I. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 20Ganju R.K. Hatch W.C. Avraham H. Ona M.A. Druker B. Avraham S. E. G.J. J. Exp.

Earp, unpublished results. Therefore, we investigated CADTK isoforms using first strand cDNA from human T, B, and epithelial cell lines. A PCR strategy designed to detect full-length and spliced CADTK revealed the short (splice variant) form in monocytes as well as T and B cell lines (Fig. 2 D). Jurkat T cells also expressed a normal sized CADTK species (Fig. 2 D). The identify of the PCR products from Jurkat and the B cell line were confirmed by subcloning and sequencing. The short form was identical to that of monocytes; the sequence of the larger Jurkat product was identical to full-length human CADTK/Pyk2. Analysis of multiple neoplastic T, B, and myelomonocytic leukemia cell lines reveals the presence of both the deleted and full-length isoforms. The epithelial lines (C33–1B cervical) and MCF10 (breast) do not exhibit the deleted isoform (Fig. 3 A). Normal, monocyte-depleted, peripheral, blood, mononuclear cells exhibit either the deleted isoform alone (Fig. 2 D) or a preponderence of the deleted isoform with a smaller proportion of the full-length isoform. The proportion of the full-length isoforms appears to be donor-specific. In summary, the deleted isoform is found in all hematopoietic cells tested with the amount of full-length isoform being variable but appearing to be increased with neoplastic transformation. Close examination of Figs. 2 D and 3 A reveals one other band in some T, B, and mononuclear cell line samples (e.g. CEM-LD, H-9, BL41, RAJ1, and U937). Currently, we have not identified a third isoform, but this possibility exists. Furthermore, PCR analysis of adherent monocyte CADTK expression showed that expression of the longer isoform increased somewhat with long term monocyte adhesion (Fig. 3 B). CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation occurs within 5 min of adherence to tissue culture plastic (data not shown) and appeared maximal at 30 min. In adherent epithelial (10Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G. Dy R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1711-1718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), CADTK is tyrosine phosphorylated upon addition of agonists. Thus, it was surprising that we failed to activate CADTK in freshly isolated monocytes in suspension with PMA treatment (Fig. 4, A and C). However, addition of PMA to adherent monocytes produced an additional increment in CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation above that of adherence alone (Fig. 4 A). Continued adherence for 20 h or 4 days resulted in persistent CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A). We repeated the adherent/nonadherent experiment using PMA, the chemokine RANTES (which produces a distinct calcium signal) (21Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 22Bacon K.B. Premack B.A. Gardner P. Schall T.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1727-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), and the tumor promoter thapsigargin, which results in an intracellular calcium signal by blocking the intracellular calcium reuptake mechanism. Again, in suspended monocytes, agonists failed to stimulate significant tyrosine phosphorylation, although, in an occasional experiment, low but detectable levels of CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation were seen with thapsigargin (e.g. Fig. 4 C). In adherent cells, the addition of PMA or, particularly, thapsigargin resulted in increased CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation (usually from 50% to 2–3-fold above that seen with adherence alone). The increase caused by thapsigargin was present whether thapsigargin was present during the entire 30 min adherence or during the last 5 min of the 30-min adherence protocol (data not shown). These results suggest two phases of activation, adherence followed by additional amplifying signals. Each experiment was performed with individual donors, and there were some donors in which adherence to tissue culture plastic produced near maximal CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation without additional agonists (data not shown). The importance of cytoskeletal engagement was emphasized by a complete absence of CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation in cells adhered to plastic in the presence of cytochalasin D (Fig. 4 E), even though similar amounts of CADTK were immunoprecipitated from both samples (Fig. 4 E). In contrast, adherence in the presence of the microtubular inhibitor, colchicine (10 μm, 30 min), did not inhibit CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). Thus, it appears that engagement or involvement of the actin cytoskeleton but not the microtubules is necessary for the CADTK activation. Adherence to activated or injured endothelium is a multistage process that appears to involve several sets of monocyte-endothelial surface protein interactions. Experimentally, monocyte activation and subsequent gene expression differ depending on the substrata to which cells adhere (3Sporn S.A. Eierman D.F. Johnson C.E. Morris J. Martin G. Ladner M. Haskill S. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4434-4441PubMed Google Scholar, 4Mondal K. Lofquist A.K. Watson J.M. Morris J.S. Price L.K. Haskill J.S. Biochem. Soc.

To investigate any hierarchy in adherence signaling, we compared adherence to tissue culture plastic, a strong stimulus, with a more physiologic substratum, culture dishes coated with fibronectin or collagen. Adherence to the latter substrate produced low level CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation, but addition of thapsigargin to monocytes on fibronectin and collagen stimulated CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation to the level near that seen with adherence to plastic (Fig. 5 A). Adherence to fibronectin and collagen appears to be a weak stimulus per se but is permissive, allowing thapsigargin, which has little or no effect in nonadhered monocytes, to fully promote CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5 A, Exp. 1). Similarly, adherence to fibronectin followed by RANTES resulted in enhanced CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5 A, Exp. 2). To further test the idea that cytoskeletal engagement is necessary for CADTK activation, we examined the effect of agonists on rat liver epithelial cells adhered to culture dishes and then suspended in same tissue culture medium for 15 min. Ang II, thapsigargin, and TPA stimulate CADTK in adherent GN4 cells but fail to do so when added to GN4 cells in suspension, even though CADTK expression is very similar in these two conditions (Fig. 5, C and D). These data further support the hypothesis that cytoskeleton engagement is required for CADTK activation.

In epithelial and smooth muscle cells, adherence results in sustained p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas CADTK is dephosphorylated. Agonists stimulate CADTK, and additional paxillin and p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation follows (23Li X. Earp H.S. J. Biol.

CADTK is expressed but is not activated by thapsigargin, PMA, or RANTES in nonadhered peripheral monocytes. Adherence by itself produces a range in monocyte CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation depending on the substratum and, to some extent, the donor, which was enhanced by acute treatment with thapsigargin, PMA, or RANTES. The effect of cytochalasin D and the minimal tyrosine phosphorylation when monocytes were adhered to fibronectin and collagen support a potential two-stage process for CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation (Figs. 4 and 5). A similar deficit in thapsigargin or TPA-dependent activation is observed in GN4 epithelial cells (Fig. 5). This indicates that in adherent cells the first stage, engagement of the cytoskeleton, has already occurred and CADTK activation simply awaits a second cue, calcium or PKC activation. Whether this two-stage hypothesis implies distinct mechanisms, alignment to a cellular locale or structure followed by a calcium or PKC-dependent activating phosphorylation, or a continuum in which cytoskeletal engagement is followed by another cytoskeletal step that is indirectly influenced by calcium or PKC remains to be determined.

The signal transduction events coupling receptors for the TGFβ 1The abbreviations used are: TGFβ, transforming growth factor β; FKBP12, FK506-binding protein 12; FNTA, α subunit of farnesyltransferase; RACE, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends; SD, synthetic dropout; Smad, MAD-related protein; TβR-I, type I TGFβ receptor; TβR-II, type II TGFβ receptor; TRAP-1, TβR-I-associated protein-1; 3-AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; bp, base pair(s); DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HA, hemagglutinin. superfamily to TGFβ-dependent responses remain incompletely understood. TGFβ signaling requires two transmembrane receptors acting in series, TβR-II phosphorylating TβR-I, each characterized by a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase domain (1Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar), but the subsequent signaling pathways are less clear-cut (2Massagué J. Cell. 1996; 85: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Several candidates have been identified by interaction cloning in yeast “two-hybrid” systems, which interact with the cytoplasmic domain of TβR-I. These include both the immunophilin-binding protein, FKBP12 (3Wang T.W. Donahoe P.K. Zervos A.S. Science. 1994; 265: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), a target for the macrolides FK506 and rapamycin, and the α subunit of Ras farnesyltransferase (FNTA) (4Kawabata M. Imamura T.

Donahoe P.K. Zervos A.S. Science. 1994; 265: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Although FKBP12 might inhibit TGFβ signaling, at least at threshold concentrations of ligand (7Wang T.W. Li B.Y. Danielson P.D. Shah P.C. Rockwell S. Lechleider R.J. Martin J. Manganaro T.

Liu F. Doody J. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13931-13934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, genetic screening inDrosophila identified the transcription factor,mothers against decapentaplegic (MAD), as acting downstream from the TGFβ homologue, decapentaplegic (12Sekelsky J.J. Newfeld S.J. Raftery L.A. Chartoff E.H. Gelbart W.M. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1347-1358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vertebrates, multiple MAD-related proteins exist (Smads) that are thought to mediate signaling by TGFβ family members via phosphorylation-dependent nuclear translocation (13Massagué J. Hata A. Liu F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 187-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 14Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J.

Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). TGFβ responses required Smad4 in concert with Smad2 (14Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar) or Smad3 (14Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J.

Because Smad proteins are substrates for type I receptors (16Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 17Kretzschmar M. Liu F. Hata A. Doody J. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), these transcription factors may provide a direct link between type I receptors and the nucleus. Using genetic complementation in yeast, a novel member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, the TGFβ-activated kinase, TAK1, was identified as an alternative mediator of TGFβ signaling, which may be necessary for at least a subset of TGFβ effects (18Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe T. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). Thus, functional pathways appear to exist distinct from direct phosphorylation of Smad proteins. Because the failure of interaction cloning to identify bona fide TGFβ receptor substrates might reasonably have been due, in part, to the use of inactive receptor as bait, we sought to identify molecules that interact specifically with active TβR-I, employing TβR-IL193A,P194A,T204D as the bait. The charged amino acid substitution at Thr204 confers constitutive activity in the absence of ligand and TβR-II; disruption of the invariant Leu-Pro motif abrogates binding to FKBP12 (9Charng M.-J. Kinnunen P. Hawker J. Brand T. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22941-22944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Using this strategy we identified a novel protein, TRAP-1, that discriminates between quiescent TβR-I and TβR-I that is activated in the presence of TGFβ. Constructions containing the cytoplasmic domains of TβR-I and TβR-II or point mutations of TβR-I in the yeast expression plasmid pAS2–1 were previously described (9Charng M.-J. Kinnunen P. Hawker J. Brand T. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22941-22944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of TβR-IL193A,P194A,T204D in pAS2–1 was used as bait, to screen a human lymphocyte cDNA library in the pACT vector (CLONTECH). The bait and library DNA were introduced into yeast strain Y190 cells (GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3 and GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-lacZ) using lithium acetate (19Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on synthetic dropout (SD)/−Leu/−Trp/−His/+25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) plates and tested for lacZ using a β-galactosidase colony lift assay (9Charng M.-J. Kinnunen P. Hawker J. Brand T. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22941-22944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Positive clones were counterselected in SD/−Leu/+cycloheximide plates to eliminate the bait plasmid and then were subjected to the yeast mating assay for interaction specificity. As additional controls for the two-hybrid assays in yeast, pVA3–1, encoding murine p53 (amino acids 72–390), and pLAM5′-1, encoding lamin C (amino acids 66–230), were obtained fromCLONTECH. Candidate plasmids purified from yeast were sequenced by the dideoxy method. To obtain a more complete TRAP-1 cDNA, the 3′ partial sequence was used to screen a human heart cDNA library in λgt10 (CLONTECH); 50,000 plaques were plated per 150-mm dish. Duplicate filters were hybridized with 32P-labeled TRAP-1 cDNA (Rediprime DNA labeling kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 7% SDS, 0.5 m NaH2PO4, and 1 mm EDTA at 55 °C overnight. Filters were washed twice in 2 × SSC and 0.05% SDS at room temperature for 15 min and then in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS twice at 55 °C for 15 min. Filters were subjected to autoradiography. Purification of positive clones was done as described (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Inserts were subcloned into pBluescript SK (Strategene) and sequenced. The GenBank™ accession number for TRAP-1 is AF022795. The 5′ sequence of TRAP-1 was completed using the 5′-RACE reaction. Human heart poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH) was reversed transcribed using the TRAP-1-specific primer 5′-GCC TGT GCT GTA ATT GTG GAT GAT GT-3′ and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. Second strand cDNA synthesis was performed usingEscherichia coli DNA polymerase I, RNase H, and E. coli DNA ligase (21Gubler U. Hoffman B.J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar). Double-stranded cDNA was blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, ligated to the Marathon cDNA adaptor (5′-CTA ATA CGA CTC ACT ATA GGG CTC GAG CGG CCG CCC GGG CAG GT-3′) (CLONTECH) and amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using a nested internal TRAP-1 specific primer (5′-ATG TTG ACC AGG CTG ATG GAG TTG TCA C-3′) and an adaptor primer (5′-CCA TCC TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGC-3′). The polymerase chain reaction products were resolved by electrophoresis through 1% agarose. The resulting 460-bp band was excised, purified, subcloned into PCR-script (Strategene), and subjected to DNA sequencing. Yeast strain Y187 (MATα) was transformed with wild-type TβR-I, point mutations of TβR-I, or TβR-II plasmids and was grown on SD/-Trp plates. Yeast strain Y190 (MATa) was transformed with TRAP-1 or TRAP-2 plasmids and grown on SD/−Leu plates. One colony from each mating type was picked, placed in 0.5 ml of YPD medium (20 g/liter peptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract), and incubated at 30 °C with shaking at 250 rpm for 8 h. Mating cultures (15 μl) were spread on SD/−Leu/−Trp and SD/−Leu/−Trp/-His +25 mm 3-AT plates and incubated at 30 °C for 5 days. Growth was scored on SD/−Leu/−Trp/−His +25 mm plates. The β-galactosidase colony lift filter assay was performed on SD/−Leu/−Trp plates (22Bendixen C. Gangloff S. Rothstein R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1778-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Filters containing poly(A)+ RNA from multiple human tissues (CLONTECH) were prehybridized in ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH) at 68 °C for 30 min and hybridized with a 32P-labeled TRAP-1 cDNA probe at 68 °C for 1 h. Filters were washed in 2× SSC and 0.05% SDS at room temperature for 30 min, washed in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 40 min, and subjected to autoradiography. To engineer the mammalian expression plasmid pFlag-ΔTRAP-1-CMV2, the partial TRAP-1 cDNA (encoding the C-terminal 387 amino acids) was excised from pAS2–1 and inserted into pFlag-CMV-2 (IBI Kodak). Mammalian 293 cells, plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2in 100-mm tissue culture dishes, were cotransfected for 5 h with 8 μg of wild-type or mutant TβR-I-HA-pCMV5, 8 μg of pFlag-ΔTRAP-1-CMV2, 8 μg of TβR-II-SV-Sport, and 45 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Human recombinant TGFβ1 (1 nm, R & D Systems) versus the diluent was added 48 h later for 15 min. Cells were solubilized in 500 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml Pefabloc, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 μm okadaic acid). Lysates (450 μl) were incubated with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), supernatants were incubated with 4 μg of anti-Flag M5 (IBI Kodak) for 1 h, and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads were added overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The beads were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and were eluted by boiling for 5 min with 5 μl of 6× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. The proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1 μg/ml anti-HA-biotin (Boehringer Mannheim), washed 4 × with Tris-buffered saline:0.05% Tween, and incubated with 0.2 units/ml streptavidin-peroxidase (Boehringer Mannheim). Bound antibody was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 6 mm NaHCO3, 10% fetal bovine serum. For transfection, cells were seeded at 1 × 105cells/24-mm well in 12-well tissue culture dishes. Cells were transfected 36 h after plating by a calcium phosphate method (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John A. Wiley & Sons. Inc., New York1994Google Scholar), using 100 ng of p3TP-Lux (24Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar), derived from the promoter for plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, 100 ng of the pCH110 β-galactosidase reporter gene, driven by the SV40 early promoter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (25Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar), 0–600 ng of pFlag-ΔTRAP-1-CMV2, and 0–100 ng of a CMV-driven TβR-IL193A,P194A,T204D expression vector (9Charng M.-J. Kinnunen P. Hawker J. Brand T. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22941-22944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were fed 0.5 ml of DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum 1 h before transfection. Calcium phosphate-DNA precipitates were formed by slowly mixing 20 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 280 mm NaCl, Na2HPO4·7 H20 with 20 μl of 125 mm CaCl2 containing 0.8 μg of DNA. Cells were incubated with DNA precipitates (40 μl/well) for 5 h and were cultured overnight in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. Medium was replaced on the following day by DMEM with 0.03% fetal bovine serum in the absence or presence or 1 ng/ml TGFβ1 (R & D Systems). Cells were harvested 24 h later, and the luciferase activity and β-galactosidase activity were measured. For all comparisons, total DNA and promoter content were kept constant using equivalent amounts of vector. Luciferase activity was corrected for the internal constitutivelacZ plasmid, and results (mean ± S.E.) are expressed relative to expression in vehicle-treated, vector-transfected cells (six to nine cultures for each condition, from two or three independent experiments). Results were compared by analysis of variance and Scheffe's test using a significance level of p < 0.01. A human lymphocyte cDNA library was screened using TβR-IL193A,P194A,T204D as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system (2.4 × 106 colonies). Unlike previously reported screens using wild-type TβR-I, where FKBP12 was the predominant protein detected, none of the resulting colonies encoded FKBP12, as expected from the obligatory role of the Leu-Pro dipeptide. Five clones corresponded to FNTA, which previously was shown to interact with both TβR-I and T204D-TβR-I (4Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Engel M.E. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29628-29631Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Two proteins were novel, designatedTβR-I-associatedprotein-1 and -2 (TRAP-1 and TRAP-2; Fig. 1). To define the binding specificity of TRAP-1 and TRAP-2, we employed the yeast mating assay to ensure co-introduction of plasmids encoding both chimeric proteins into a single yeast host (22Bendixen C. Gangloff S. Rothstein R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1778-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Yeast Y190 cells containing GAL4-BD-TRAP-1 or GAL4-BD-TRAP-2 plasmids were mated with yeast Y187 cells containing the “bait” (GAL4-AD-TβR-IL193A,P194A,T204D) or other test cDNAs, in frame with the GAL4 activator domain. In this assay system, interaction between two hybrid proteins induces two GAL4-dependent genes, HIS3 and lacZ, which allows both growth on histidine-deficient plates and induction of β-galactosidase. By both criteria, TRAP-1 and TRAP-2 interacted specifically with TβR-IL193A,P194A,T204D but not with wild-type TβR-I, TβR-II, or other irrelevant proteins (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2TRAP-1 associates selectively with activating mutations of TβR-I. The specificity for interaction of TRAP-1 and TRAP-2 with TβR-I, mutations of TβR-I, and control proteins was assessed by the yeast mating assay. Yeast strain Y190 was transformed with TRAP-1 or TRAP-2 in pAS2–1 and was mated with yeast strain Y187 carrying wild-type or mutant TβR-I, TβR-II, lamin C, or p53 in pACT2. In A and B, mating cultures were plated on nonselective medium (SD/−Leu/−Trp, a and d) to confirm the presence of both plasmids and on selective medium (SD/−Leu/−Trp/−His/+3-AT; b and e) to assess protein-protein interaction by two-hybrid induction of the HIS3 gene; lacZ activity was determined by a colony lift X-gal assay on filter replicas of the SD/−Leu/−Trp plates (c and f).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because three amino acid substitutions were incorporated in our TβR-I bait, to establish which amino acid(s) conferred this interaction, the associations between TRAP-1 and TRAP-2 and each individual mutation of TβR-I were tested. TRAP-1 also bound the TβR-IT204D kinase domain, containing the substitution that activates TβR-I signaling; TRAP-1 did not interact with TβR-IL193A or TβR-IP194A (Fig. 2 B). Thus, activation of TβR-I, not disruption of FKBP12 binding, was responsible for the conditional binding of TRAP-1. In contrast, TRAP-2 only interacted with TβR-IL193A,P194A,T204D but not TβR-IT204Dor other single mutations. For this reason, TRAP-1 was selected for more extensive analysis. To obtain the full-length coding sequence of TRAP-1, the 3′ 1399-bp partial cDNA was used to screen a human heart cDNA library, and the 5′ sequence of TRAP-1 was obtained by performing 5′-RACE on poly(A)+ RNA from human heart. The full-length cDNA was 3100 bp in length, comprising 860 amino acid residues (Fig. 1). An in-frame stop codon (TAA) was 153 bp upstream from the ATG start codon and Kozak consensus sequence (26Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar). A search of GenBank™ using BLAST revealed no homologous proteins; a search for potential functional motifs using the BLAST Enhanced Alignment Utility identified one potential phosphorylation site for protein kinase A, nine for protein kinase C, and eight for casein kinase 2, and seven potential myristylation sites. No other known structural motifs were identified. TRAP-1 mRNA was detected as two transcripts of 4.4 and 6 kilobases in all tissues examined, with lesser abundance in lung and liver (Fig. 3); the mechanism for generating the two transcripts remains to be determined. To confirm the prediction that TRAP-1 might also associate specifically with activated TβR-I in mammalian cells, the receptor-binding portion of TRAP-1 isolated in the yeast two-hybrid screen was epitope-tagged at its N terminus using the FLAG sequence and was cotransfected into human 293 cells together with wild-type TβR-I or the activated mutation, TβR-IL193A,P194A,T204D, each incorporating the Hemophilus influenzae hemagglutinin (HA) tag. Two days following transfection, the cells were incubated with TGFβ1 or the vehicle. To recover TRAP-1 itself, plus associated proteins, lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody to the FLAG epitope and then were blotted with antibody to the HA tag (Fig. 4). The constitutively activated receptor, TβR-IL193A,P194A,T204D, was coprecipitated with TRAP-1 even in the absence of TGFβ1. However, wild-type TβR-I-HA was coprecipitated only from TGFβ-treated cells. This preferential binding to the ligand-activated receptor contrasts markedly with FKBP12 and farnesyltransferase, both of which were released from TβR-I in the presence of TGFβ1 (5). Thus, unlike these proteins, TRAP-1 is recruited selectively to the active forms of TβR-I. To ascertain whether binding of TRAP-1 to the activated receptor might have functional consequences, HepG2 cells were transfected with the TGFβ-responsive p3TP-Lux reporter gene, an internal lacZ control, and 0–600 ng of the partial TRAP-1 expression vector (Fig. 5). TβR-IL193A,P194A,T204D was sufficient to up-regulate expression more than 30-fold (33.5 ± 3.4; p = 0.0001 versus vector-transfected cells). Co-transfection with increasing amounts of the ΔTRAP-1 expression vector progressively decreased the induction of p3TP-Lux. Using 600 ng of this TRAP-1 construct, only 12-fold induction was seen (12.2 ± 1.4; p = 0.0001 versus the absence of TRAP-1). Analogous results were seen following stimulation of endogenous type I receptor with 1 ng/ml TGFβ1. Expression increased to 6.17 ± 0.46, relative to vehicle-treated cells (p = 0.0001), and this induction likewise was inhibited by ΔTRAP-1 (2.51 ± 0.24, using 600 ng; p = 0.0001 versus the absence of TRAP-1). Thus, a partial TRAP-1 cDNA, which is sufficient to recognize the activated receptor selectively, can function as an inhibitor of TGFβ-dependent gene transcription. Ligand-induced receptor homodimerization, causing reciprocal cross-phosphorylation in trans, is a strategy commonly employed by receptor tyrosine kinases for transmembrane signaling (27Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 477-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated tyrosine residues of the receptor, in turn, recruit SH2 domain-containing molecules that are required for signaling. For receptor serine/threonine kinases and the TGFβ superfamily, the signal transduction pathway is similar but distinct; TGFβ ligands induce the heterodimerization of TβR-II and TβR-I, whereupon TβR-II phosphorylates TβR-I on serine and threonine residues of its Gly/Ser-rich domain. This directional phosphorylation event and the kinase activity of both receptors functioning sequentially are required for signal generation (1Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar). Conversely, we and others have shown that negatively charged amino acids can serve as surrogates for the phosphorylation of TβR-I and constitutively activate the receptor even in the absence of TβR-II (9Charng M.-J. Kinnunen P. Hawker J. Brand T. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22941-22944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). According to this model, TβR-I, being the substrate for TβR-II, should interact with downstream mediators and effectors. Therefore, it has been discouraging that interaction cloning using the TβR-I cytoplasmic domain as bait has not succeeded to date in identifying specific molecules that confer the TβR-I signal (3Wang T.W. Donahoe P.K. Zervos A.S. Science. 1994; 265: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 5Wang T.W. Danielson P.D. Li B.Y. Shah P.C. Kim S.D. Donahoe P.K.

Based on precedents with receptor tyrosine kinases, one foreseeable explanation for this failure may be that some effector molecules acting downstream of TβR-I might associate preferentially with phosphorylated (active) TβR-I rather than with the unphosphorylated (inactive) TβR-I used as bait in previously reported cloning efforts. Here, we have used TβR-IL193A,P194A,T204D as bait, which has two potentially advantageous properties for this purpose: being autonomously active and not binding FKBP12. Beyond its ability to distinguish activated from wild-type TβR-I in yeast two-hybrid assays, the novel protein, TRAP-1, binds only mutationally activated or ligand-activated TβR-I in mammalian cells not the inactive type I receptor, reminiscent of the signaling tactics used by receptor tyrosine kinases. This novel protein is selective in binding active forms of TβR-I, which favors its involvement in the TGFβ cascade. Similar binding specificity recently was demonstrated for Smad7, which preferentially associates with active TβR-I, preventing receptor association with and phosphorylation of Smad2 (30Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y.B. Cai J.X. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone M.A. Wrana J.L. Falb D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1165-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). Thus, intracellular antagonists as well as mediators might be identified by use of the activated receptor as bait. Indeed, at least for Smad proteins, only the inhibitory forms like Smad7 have been shown to bind stably to the activated receptor. In keeping with this model, the C-terminal portion of TRAP-1 (which is sufficient for stable interaction with the activated receptor both in yeast and in mammalian cells) was found to inhibit TGFβ signaling, as measured by the p3TP-Lux reporter gene. This does not preclude a more complex role for the full-length protein, which we have not yet expressed, or address the status of TGFβ signaling in the absence of TRAP-1. Further work is required to validate the suggested function of TRAP-1 in TβR-I signaling via Smad, TAK1, or an alternative pathway. We gratefully acknowledge C.-H. Heldin, H. Lodish, J. Massagué, A.

https://openalex.org/W2093146082,"Iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2) are two cytoplasmic RNA-binding proteins that control iron metabolism in mammalian cells. Both IRPs bind to specific sequences called iron-responsive elements (IREs) located in the 3′ or 5′ untranslated regions of several mRNAs, in particular mRNA encoding ferritin and transferrin receptor. In this study, we followed in parallel the in vivo regulation of the two IRPs in physiologically stimulated macrophages. We show that stimulation of mouse RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cells increased IRP1 IRE binding activity 4-fold, whereas IRP2 activity decreased 2-fold 8 h after interferon-γ/lipopolysaccharide treatment. Decrease in IRP2 was not due to nitric oxide (NO) production and did not require de novo protein synthesis. Our data therefore indicate that the two IRPs can be conversely regulated in response to the same stimulus. In addition, the effect of endogenously produced NO on IRP1 was further characterized in an activated macrophage/target cell system. We show that NO acts as an intercellular signal to increase IRP1 activity in adjacent cells. As the effect was detectable within 1 h and did not require de novo protein synthesis, this result supports a direct action of NO on IRP1.

Five IRE sequences have also been located in the 3′ untranslated region of transferrin receptor mRNA and, in that case, IRE/IRP interaction confers stability against endonucleolytic cleavage (15Binder R.

Thus, IRPs control uptake, storage, and intracellular metabolism of iron through their IRE binding activity. Two IRPs called IRP1 and IRP2 have been characterized and cloned in several cell types (12Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Henderson B.R. Seiser C. Kühn L.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30904-30910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IRP1 exhibits considerable sequence homology with mitochondrial aconitase and has been identified as the cytoplasmic aconitase (19Hentze M.W. Argos P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1739-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 20Kennedy M.C. Mende-Mueller L. Blondin G.A. Beinert H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1991; 64: 881-883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The two activities of this protein are mutually exclusive. The form that presents aconitase activity converting citrate into isocitrate in the cytosol possesses an intact 4Fe-4S cluster, whereas the IRE-binding form lacks it (22Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1442-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 23Haile D.J. Rouault T.A. Tang C.K. Chin J. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7536-7540Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Thus, the status of the Fe-S cluster is crucial to determination of IRP1 function. In iron-repleted cells, holoIRP1 predominates and exhibits aconitase activity. Conversely, apoIRP1, which binds IRE with high affinity, is the major form in iron-depleted cells. This first discovered regulation of IRP1 by iron led to the suggestion that a switch between the holo- and apoprotein without any change in IRP1 protein levels explains the regulation (2Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). In vitro, IRP2 binds IRE sequences of ferritin and transferrin receptor (Tf-R) mRNA with similar affinity to IRP1 (17Henderson B.R. Seiser C. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27327-27334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kim H.Y. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4983-4986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This second IRP shares 61% amino acid identity with IRP1, but despite conservation of the cluster-ligating cysteines at the active site, IRP2 is unable to assemble an Fe-S cluster in vitro and therefore is unable to exhibit aconitase activity (25Phillips J.D. Guo B. Yang Y. Brown F.M. Leibold E.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15704-15714Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The primary sequences of IRPs principally differ from each other by the insertion of a 73-amino acid sequence in the N terminus domain of IRP2. It has been shown that this cysteine-rich sequence is required to regulate IRP2 expression by iron (26Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Unlike the regulation of IRP1 by iron, loss of IRE binding of IRP2 is due to its own degradation via the proteasome pathway (26Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 27Guo B. Phillips J.D. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21645-21651Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Despite the rising interest in IRP2 displayed for the last few years, the questions as to why two IRPs exist and about their respective roles are still puzzling. Apart from the regulation mediated by iron availability, NO was the first physiological molecule found to be able to convert IRP1 from aconitase to the IRE-binding form in macrophages and non-macrophage cells (28Drapier J.C. Hirling H. Wietzerbin J. Kaldy P. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3643-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 29Weiss G. Goossen W.D. Fuchs D. Pantopoulos K. Werner-Felmayer G. Wachter H. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3651-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). It has also been established that endogenous NO production was able to repress ferritin mRNA translation and to stabilize transferrin receptor mRNA (30Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1267-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). IRP1 activation has also been reported in fibroblasts (Ltk-) exposed to H2O2 and chemicals able to release NO (31Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The effect of H2O2 is fast and indirect and, in contrast to our previous proposal (32Bouton C. Raveau M. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2300-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) it was stated that the effect of NO is slow and analogous to that exhibited by iron chelators (31Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In the same set of experiments, it was shown that IRP2 of fibroblasts Ltk- also exhibited higher IRE binding activity after treatment by NO-releasing drugs (31Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These results conflicted with those published by another group showing that neither endogenous NO production by the hepatoma cell line FTO2B nor its exposure to exogenous NO influences the IRE binding activity of IRP2 (33Phillips J.D. Kinikini D.V. Guo B. Leibold E.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2983-2992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To clarify the regulation of the two IRPs by NO (or congeners), we have first studied the modulation of their IRE binding activity in RAW 264.7 macrophages immunologically stimulated for NO production. We show that endogenous TNF is required for NO-dependent activation of IRP1 RNA binding activity. Further, we report that unlike IRP1, IRP2 loses its IRE binding activity independently of the production of NO. We have also carefully investigated the time course of the effect of NO on aconitase and IRE binding activities of IRP1 in an effector/target coculture system. We show that NO released by macrophages quickly modulates IRP1 activities of target cells without requirement ofde novo synthesis of protein. Murine recombinant interferon-γ (specific activity: 2 × 107 units/mg) was produced by Genentech and provided by Dr G. R. Adolf (Boehringer Ingelheim, Vienna, Austria). Rabbit anti-TNF-α antibodies (neutralizing titer was 1 to 25,000) were produced in our laboratory by repeated inoculations of rabbits with pure Mu-rTNF. N G-monomethyl-l-arginine,Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (serotype 0111: B4), cycloheximide, and desferrioxamine were purchased from Sigma. The macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% endotoxin low fetal calf serum. The rat C58 pre-T cell line was kindly supplied by Dr. Markus Nabholz (Institut Suisse de Recherches Experimentales sur le Cancer, Epalinges, Switzerland) and cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% endotoxin low fetal calf serum and 5 mm glutamine. RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with IFN-γ alone or in combination with LPS. When indicated, 1 mm N G-monomethyl-l-arginine, 100 μm desferrioxamine, or a rabbit anti-TNF-α antibody was added to the culture medium. RAW 264.7 macrophages were stimulated for 16 h with 10 units/ml IFN-γ and 50 ng/ml LPS for NO synthase 2 (NOS2) induction. Cells were exhaustively washed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove the stimulating agents. Under these conditions, it has been shown that macrophages are able to produce NO for 24 h without further stimuli. Pre-T C58 target cells were added to the NO-producing macrophage monolayers at an effector to target ratio of 1. When required, release of the NOS2 products was blocked by addition of 1 mm N G-monomethyl-l-arginine, and de novo protein synthesis was inhibited by 800 ng/ml cycloheximide. Cells (1 × 106/ml) were treated with 0.007% digitonin for 10 min at 4 °C in 0.25 m sucrose, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, to lyse cells without damaging mitochondria. The resulting lysate was then centrifuged at 75,000 rpm for 20 min in a Beckman TL 100 ultracentrifuge to spin down any particulate material. Cytosolic extracts (0.5 mg/ml) were aliquoted and kept at −80 °C until use for gel mobility shift assay and aconitase measurement (34Drapier J.C. Hibbs Jr., J.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells (1 × 106/ml) were also treated with 0.5% Nonidet-P40 for 5 min at room temperature. The lysates were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were directly analyzed for gel mobility shift assay or kept at −80 °C. IRP/IRE interactions were measured as described previously (35Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 36Müllner E.W. Neupert B. Kühn L.C. Cell. 1989; 58: 373-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) by incubating a molar excess of [32P]CTP-labeled IRE transcript from plasmid pSPT-fer with 5–10 μg of cytoplasmic extracts in a 20 μl reaction volume. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, 20 units of RNase T1 and 5 mg/ml heparin were sequentially added for 10 min each. IRE-protein complexes were run on a nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel. In parallel experiments, samples were routinely treated with 2% 2-mercaptoethanol prior to addition of the IRE probe to allow full expression of IRE binding activity (37Hentze M.W. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Science. 1989; 244: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The IRP-IRE complexes were quantified with a PhosphorImager using Image Quant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Experiments were performed at least three times, and one representative experiment is shown. Aconitase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by following the disappearance ofcis-aconitate at 240 nm as described previously (34Drapier J.C. Hibbs Jr., J.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 38Drapier J.C. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 26-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction volume (900 μl) contains 60 μg of cytoplasmic extract in 100 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, and kinetics was started by the addition of 15 μl of 20 mm cis-aconitate. Units represent nanomoles of substrate consumed/min at 37 °C (ε = 3.6 mm−1cm−1). The formation of nitrite, one of the end products of nitric oxide, was determined spectrophotometrically in the culture medium at 543 nm, using the Griess reagent containing 0.5% sulfanilamide and 0.05% N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine hydrochloride in 45% acetic acid. Cells were cultivated with various concentrations of cycloheximide in leucine-starved RPMI medium for 24 h. Then, cells were pulse-labeled with 4 μCi/ml ofl-[3H]leucine for 2 h. After incorporation of leucine, cells were washed ten times and harvested in 10% trichloroacetic acid solution. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and protein pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Incorporated3H-radioactivity was measured as described previously (34Drapier J.C. Hibbs Jr., J.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Cell viability was estimated using the LDL-10 kit from Sigma. The protein content of extracts was determined spectrophotometrically at 595 nm, using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. As shown previously, IFN-γ-treated macrophages express NOS2, and release of endogenous NO can be followed by nitrite accumulation in culture medium. As a consequence, IRP1 exhibits high affinity for IRE (28Drapier J.C. Hirling H. Wietzerbin J. Kaldy P. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3643-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 29Weiss G. Goossen W.D. Fuchs D. Pantopoulos K. Werner-Felmayer G. Wachter H. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3651-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1,lane 2). Here we show that incubation of cells with anti-TNF-α antibodies before treatment with IFN-γ maintains IRE binding activity of IRP1 at a basal level (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1–3). It is likely that production of endogenous TNF-α, by boosting NOS2 expression, allows activation of IRP1 in concert with IFN-γ. In unstimulated RAW 264.7 cells, IRP2 expresses constitutive basal IRE binding activity as high as that of IRP1 (Fig. 2 A, lane 1) and, in agreement with previous data, is markedly enhanced after treatment with 2% 2-ME (39Bouton C. Hirling H. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19969-19975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As expected, in response to overnight stimulation by IFN-γ, IRE binding activity of IRP1 was increased, but in striking contrast, that of IRP2 decreased and was not fully restored by 2-ME (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). Furthermore, when associated with IFN-γ, LPS, which maximally induces NOS2 in murine macrophages, enhanced IRE binding activity of IRP1 and amplified the loss of IRE binding activity of IRP2 (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). As evidenced by PhosphorImaging analysis, activation of IRP1 and inactivation of IRP2 correlated with NO synthesis as measured by nitrite release in the culture medium (Fig. 2 B). Despite loading of an identical amount of protein on the gel, we consistently observed that IRE binding activity of IRP1 after addition 2% 2-ME was less in stimulated cells as compared with control cells (Fig. 2 A, lower panel, compare lanes 2and 3 to lane 1).Figure 2Differential regulation of IRE binding activities of IRP1 and IRP2 in RAW 264.7 macrophages stimulated for NO synthesis by IFN-γ alone or IFN-γ/LPS. A, cells were stimulated with 400 units/ml IFN-γ (lane 2) or with 10 units/ml IFN-γ and 50 ng/ml LPS (lane 3) for 16 h. Cell extracts were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and equal amounts of protein were analyzed for IRE binding by IRP1 and IRP2 in the presence or absence of 2% 2-ME. B, radioactivity associated with IRE-IRP complexes was quantified by PhosphorImaging. IRP1 activity was expressed as a percentage of the value obtained after exposure to 2% 2-ME, which allows visualization of the total IRE binding activity of IRP1. Signals of IRP2 activity were plotted in arbitrary units. In parallel, nitrite production (a stable oxidation product of NO) was measured in the culture medium using the colorimetric assay based on the Griess reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It is well known that IRP1 and IRP2 activities are enhanced following treatment of cells with the iron chelator, desferrioxamine. To see whether IFN-γ-mediated down-regulation of IRP2 can influence the iron-dependent pathway, cells were cultured in the presence of both IFN-γ and desferrioxamine. As shown in Fig. 3, lanes 1–4, IRP2 of RAW 264.7 cells stimulated by IFN-γ lost the capacity to respond to desferrioxamine regulation. To clarify the mechanism by which immunological stimuli modulate IRP2, we investigated the kinetics of IRP2 modulation in IFN-γ/LPS-treated cells in parallel to that of IRP1. When IRE binding of IRP1 exhibited nearly a 4-fold increase after 8 h of treatment, IRP2 activity decreased 2-fold. Converse modulation of both IRPs occurred as soon as NOS2 was expressed as testified by nitrite production. In parallel experiments, we routinely treated cytoplasmic extracts with 2% 2-ME prior to the binding step to fully express the IRE binding activity of both IRPs. We observed that full binding activity of both IRPs of IFN-γ/LPS-treated cells decreased from the first hour (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1–7 with8–14). To determine if decrease in IRP2 IRE binding activity was due to NO production, IFN-γ- or IFN-γ/LPS-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages were stimulated in the presence of L-NMA, a NOS inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 5, reduction of NO production led to a decrease in IRP1 binding to IRE but had no effect on IRP2 activity. However, as a competitive inhibitor, L-NMA was unable to completely inhibit expression of NOS2 as indicated by residual nitrite production. Because IRP2, at least in RAW 264.7 cells, is more sensitive to post-translational redox modulation than IRP1 (39Bouton C. Hirling H. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19969-19975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we cannot exclude the possibility at this stage that low output of NO is sufficient to down-regulate IRP2. To see whether modulation of IRP2 activity requires de novo protein synthesis, we assessed IRP modulation in IFN-γ/LPS-treated cells in the presence of cycloheximide, a translation inhibitor. In the presence of cycloheximide, stimulated cells did not produce significant amounts of nitrite before 24 h (Fig. 6 A). Under these conditions, IRP1 IRE binding activity was not increased whereas that of IRP2 decreased to the same extent as in cells stimulated in the absence of cycloheximide (Fig. 6 B). From these two sets of experiments, we conclude that IRP2 expression or activity is affected in response to immunological stimuli, i.e. IFN-γ and LPS, independently of NO.Figure 5IRE binding activities of IRP1 and IRP2 in RAW 264.7 macrophages stimulated in the presence of a NOS inhibitor.

Signals of IRP2 were 10-fold amplified relative to those of IRP1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In a previous paper (28Drapier J.C. Hirling H. Wietzerbin J. Kaldy P. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3643-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), we showed that kinetics of IRP1 activation in primary macrophages is superimposable on that of endogenous NO production, which suggested that NO (or some species derived from NO) reacts rapidly and directly with IRP1. Yet results of another study (31Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) indicated that NO exerts a delayed response on IRP1 activity and may therefore affect iron availability rather than targeting the protein. Accordingly, to shed light on this controversial matter, we reinvestigated this question in greater detail. To avoid the lag necessary to induce NOS2 activity, we performed a coculture study. First, macrophages were maximally activated for NO production for 18 h and after exhaustive washings C58 lymphoma target cells, which are unable to produce NO, were added to the macrophage monolayer. RNA binding activity of C58 target cells was then measuredversus time. Significant induction of IRE binding activity of IRP1 appeared in C58 cells within 1 h (Fig. 7 A) and was correlated with release of nitrite from effector cells (Fig. 7 B, upper panel). Meanwhile aconitase activity of IRP1 rapidly decreased in response to NO production (data not shown). In fact, IRP2 expression, which was low at the beginning of cell culture, progressively increased and was maximal after 8 h (see Fig. 7, A and B, lower panel). Interestingly, we noted that IRP2 expression in C58 cells cocultured with NO-releasing macrophages, but in the absence of immunological stimuli, was unchanged (Fig. 7 B, lower panel). As expected, IRE binding by IRP1 in target cells was prevented when the macrophage monolayer was cultured in the presence of L-NMA, and notable aconitase activity was measured (Fig. 8). However, induction of IRP1 IRE binding activity was unaffected in the presence of cycloheximide, showing that modulation of IRP1 did not require de novo protein synthesis (Fig. 8).Figure 8IRE binding activity of IRP1 in C58 cells after coculture with NO-producing RAW 264.7 cells in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX) or NOS2 inhibitor.

IRP1 is an Fe-S protein whose RNA-binding activity is regulated post-translationally in response to environmental signals: intracellular iron level, nitric oxide synthesis, oxidative stress, and degree of phosphorylation (1Hentze M.W. Kühn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar, 2Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B.

Chem. 1993; 268: 27363-27370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that IRP2 is also regulated by iron but by a different mechanism. Indeed, in response to iron accumulation, IRP2 is degraded via the proteasome pathway (26Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 42Guo B. Brown F.M. Phillips J.D. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16529-16535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report that physiological stimulation of macrophages modulates RNA binding activity of IRP1 and IRP2 conversely. As shown earlier, the pathway that allows cytokines to modulate IRP1 activity relies on NO synthesis. IFN-γ is a major positive regulator (28Drapier J.C. Hirling H. Wietzerbin J. Kaldy P. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3643-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 29Weiss G. Goossen W.D. Fuchs D. Pantopoulos K. Werner-Felmayer G. Wachter H. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3651-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), whereas interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 down-regulate IRP1 RNA binding activity (43Weiss G. Bogdan C. Hentze M.W. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 420-425PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we show that endogenous production of TNF, an important autocrine inducer of NO synthase, is crucial for IFN-γ-mediated activation of IRP1. It is likely that the part played by inflammatory cytokines in iron availability has far reaching implications for cell-mediated responses to microbial infections or to oxidative stress. Whether or not immunological stimuli like cytokines can also drive IRP2 is still an open question. Indeed, conflicting results have been reported concerning the effect of NO on IRP2 (31Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 33Phillips J.D. Kinikini D.V. Guo B. Leibold E.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2983-2992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that exposure of fibroblasts to NO-releasing drugs increases RNA binding activity of IRP2, whereas an independent study concluded that endogenous production of NO by hepatoma cells or their treatment by exogenous NO does not have any effect on IRP2 (31Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 33Phillips J.D. Kinikini D.V. Guo B. Leibold E.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2983-2992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To perform this study, we deliberately chose two cell lines that express significant basal IRP2 activity, i.e. murine RAW 264.7 macrophages and rat lymphoma C58 cells. In RAW 264.7 cells, we observed that in contrast to IRP1, IRP2 activity dropped upon exposure to IFN-γ. It is noteworthy that this effect was strong enough to counteract the up-regulation of IRP2 classically observed in cells depleted of iron after desferrioxamine treatment. As IRP2 possesses redox-active cysteines (25Phillips J.D. Guo B. Yang Y. Brown F.M. Leibold E.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15704-15714Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 39Bouton C. Hirling H.

Eisenstein R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3950-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which, as previously pointed out by our group and others, are crucial for its activity (39Bouton C. Hirling H. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19969-19975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 40Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 700-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), it was expected that NO would be the effector molecule responsible for the down-regulation. However, our coculture system clearly demonstrated that IRP2 is controlled independently of NO endogenously produced by macrophages. Overall, these results are reminiscent of data reported by Phillips et al. (33Phillips J.D. Kinikini D.V. Guo B. Leibold E.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2983-2992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showing that endogenous NO released by IFN-γ/LPS-stimulated hepatoma cells does not activate IRP2. However, this is the first report that IRP1 and IRP2 are regulated in opposite ways. As reported by Schalinske and Eisenstein (40Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7168-7176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), RNA binding capacity of IRP2 may depend on phosphorylation. Indeed, in HL-60 premonocytic cells, phosphorylation of IRP2 stabilizes a reduced (i.e.active) form, and as a consequence, Tf-R mRNA level is increased (40Schalinske K.L. Eisenstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7168-7176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that a modification of the kinase/phosphatase balance within cells could favor formation of a latent form of IRP2 under our experimental conditions. Alternatively, the down-regulation of IRP2 in activated macrophages described in this paper may be due to accelerated degradation of the protein. We also point out that translation inhibition, in IFN-γ/LPS-stimulated cells, prevents IRP1 activation without altering loss of IRP2 activity. This result stresses an intrinsic role of IRP2 in cells and suggests that IFN-γ/LPS regulation is not mediated by iron because iron-dependent degradation of IRP2 generally requiresde novo protein synthesis (12Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 46Henderson B.R. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20509-20515Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Altogether, these results are in keeping with a recent observation showing that in cells lacking IRP1, IRP2 can mediate IRE-dependent regulation of cellular iron by itself (47Schalinske K.L. Blemings K.P. Steffen D.W. Chen O.S. Eisenstein R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10681-10686Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our observation that immunological/inflammatory stimuli decrease RNA binding by IRP2 may reconcile some published divergent data. Indeed, cells exposed to NO-releasing drugs or overexpressing NO synthase logically exhibit higher expression of Tf-R mRNA (31Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 33Phillips J.D. Kinikini D.V. Guo B. Leibold E.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2983-2992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Domachowske J.B. Rafferty S.P. Singhania N. Mardiney III, M. Malech H.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 2980-2988PubMed Google Scholar, 49Oria R. Sanchez L. Houston T. Hentze M.W. Liew F.Y. Brock J. Blood. 1995; 85: 2962-2966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yet it was also reported in the same papers that cells stimulated by IFN-γ and LPS, despite production of endogenous NO and subsequent activation of IRP1, unexpectedly exhibited a low Tf-R mRNA level (31Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 33Phillips J.D. Kinikini D.V. Guo B. Leibold E.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2983-2992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most likely interpretation of these data was that some ill-defined negative effect on Tf-R mRNA expression resulting from immunological stimulation, overcomes the effect of the NO/IRP1 pathway. Besides, Cairo and Pietrangelo (50Cairo G. Pietrangelo A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) using an experimental model of inflammation have reported that IRP2 rather than IRP1 is responsible for modulation of Tf-R mRNA stabilization (50Cairo G. Pietrangelo A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). At this juncture, it is difficult to understand how IRP2 could out-compete IRP1 in binding Tf-R IREs. One simple explanation is that an active IRE-binding form of IRP2 is more abundant in some tissues. If NOS2 is not induced in these tissues, IRP2 activity may prevail. Response would thus be tissue-specific. An alternative interpretation is that IRP2 exhibits greater affinity for Tf-R IREs. A previous report (12Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) addressed this question and revealed that both IRPs bind Tf-R IRE B and C equally well at least in vitro. However, to our knowledge such data are not available for the three other Tf-R IREs, and it is worth noting that IRP2 has a greater affinity than IRP1 for IREs with an adenine in the middle of the 6-membered loop, i.e. NNGAGN (51Butt J. Kim H.Y. Basilion J.P. Cohen S. Iwai K. Philpott C.C. Altschul S. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4345-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 52Henderson B.R. Menotti E. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4900-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Among the 5 IREs of Tf-R, only IRE A possesses an adenine at this critical position (2Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 53Theil E. Biochem. J. 1994; 30: 1-11Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It is therefore tempting to speculate that binding of IRE A by IRP2 is determinant for Tf-R mRNA stabilization. If so, the IFN-γ/LPS-dependent down-regulation of IRP2 that we reported would explain why Tf-R mRNA expression is decreased in cells exposed to these stimuli (31Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar,33Phillips J.D. Kinikini D.V. Guo B. Leibold E.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2983-2992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, our study solves a longstanding question as to whether NO rapidly reacts with IRP1 or alternatively affects iron availability and prevents IRP1 cluster reconstitution after a lag (31Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Our findings show that IRP1 of cells placed in contact with NO-producing macrophages is significantly activated in less than 1 h. In this short time frame, 15% of IRP1 was completely converted from a form unable to bind IRE into one which can. This means that the biochemical NO-dependent process that activates the protein was completed. Whether it affects all or some of the IRP1 molecules is of secondary importance in this matter and may depend on experimental conditions. The results of this in vivo study thus strengthens our proposal that NO affects IRP1 directly, probably by reacting with its Fe-S cluster. This is in line with recent results ofin vitro studies showing that NO in the absence of oxygen yields an EPR-detectable signal typical of iron-nitrosyl complexes in mitochondrial aconitase and IRP1 (54Kennedy M.C. Antholine W.E. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20340-20347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). With NO, cells therefore possess an efficient effector molecule ready to control IRP1 functions and adjust iron availability. The only delay may arise from the requirement to induce NOS2. However, this drawback can be bypassed if one of the constitutive NO synthases (NOS1 and NOS3) is concerned, as already shown in neurons (55Jaffrey S.R. Cohen N.A. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12994-12998Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or in the case of closeness to NOS2-expressing cells, as shown in our coculture model.

Subsequently, a fireball forms and expands relativistically outward. The expanding fireball interacts with the surrounding interstellar medium, causing its kinetic energy to be radiated in shock waves and producing a burst of x-ray radiation.

The number and diversity of putative receptors is consistent with the ability of mammals to differentiate thousands of odors (2Buck L.B. Curr. Opin.

Despite the compelling circumstantial evidence that this family of receptors functions in mammalian odor discrimination, definitive data documenting ligand-receptor binding and functional receptor expression are lacking. The possibility that these orphan receptors may serve a more general function in chemodetection comes from the discovery that OdR-like proteins are expressed in the testis (7Parmentier M. Libert F.

In this report, RNase protection assays likewise detect OdR transcripts in the spleen. These findings suggest that sperm tails, olfactory cilia, and immune cells may share common mechanisms to detect exogenous chemical signals. The hypothesis that OdRs function in mammalian sperm to regulate motility in response to exogenous signals derives from the existence of sperm-egg chemotaxis in invertebrates. The small peptides, speract and resact, are secreted by sea urchin eggs and attract spermatozoa in a species-specific manner by stimulating sperm motility and respiration (13Suzuki N. Garbers D. Biol. Reprod. 1984; 30: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14Suzuki N. Normura K. Ohtoke H. Isaka S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Recent evidence indicates that sperm-egg chemotaxis may likewise occur during mammalian fertilization (16Cohen-Dayag A. Tur-Kaspa I. Dor J. Mashiach S. Eisenbach M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We were interested in clarifying the role of OdR expression in the testis. During the meiotic phase of spermatogenesis, gene promoters may become exposed as a result of altered chromatin structure, potentially leading to spurious transcription of a host of gene products lacking physiologic function. To avoid this confounding issue in studying whole testis, we restricted our investigation of OdR expression to round spermatids, the post-meiotic, differentiating cell population in the testis. We report the identification of two novel families of OdR-like proteins, termed spermatid chemoreceptors (SCRs), in spermatids of rat testis. In situ hybridization studies illustrate the selective localization of SCRs to spermatids in the testis and demonstrate that SCR expression is developmentally regulated, with transcripts first detectable during sexual maturation. RACE-PCR and sequencing of genomic clones led to the discovery that SCRs undergo 5′-splicing, which may regulate receptor expression during spermatogenesis. The 5′-splicing of OdR transcripts may influence the stability of OdR mRNAs and the expression of functional OdR proteins in olfactory, reproductive, immunologic, and experimental systems. Total RNA was prepared from testis, whole brain, and olfactory tissue using TRIzol reagant (Life Technologies, Inc.) and Oligotex poly(A)+ selection (Qiagen) according to manufacturer protocols. Round spermatids were purified from the testis by elutriation (18Shaper N. Wright W. Shaper J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); the cell pellet was homogenized in guanidinium isothiocyanate and RNA pelleted through a cesium chloride gradient according to established procedures (19MacDonald R. Swift G. Przybyla A. Chirgwin J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). RNA was treated with 10 units of RNase-free DNase (Life Technologies, Inc.) per μg of RNA. Five μg of RNA from each source was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) or random primers. PCR was performed on a 1/20 aliquot of the RT mixture for 35 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min using TAQ DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Degenerate primers to the conserved LHTPMYLF (OdR 1) and STCASH (OdR 2) sequences of originally cloned OdRs (1Buck L. Axel R. Cell. 1991; 65: 175-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3694) Google Scholar) were employed. Buck and Axel clone F2 was used as a positive control for RT-PCR with OdR 1 + 2; negative control PCR reactions were run with mock reverse-transcribed RNA that was not treated with reverse transcriptase. The spermatid PCR product was TA-subcloned into pCRII (Invitrogen) and 14 clones (A–N) were sequenced. The testis PCR product was likewise subcloned and 7 clones were sequenced. Two sets of PCR primers were designed for pSCRs D and G to generate probes corresponding to the two halves of each PCR product. PCR primer sequences were as follows: D.1 (EIGYTC, 5′-GAGATTGGCTATACTTGC); D.2 (GMGCTV, 3′-TACTGTGCATCCCATTCC); D.3 (GLGQTN, 5′-GGTCTGGGACAGACCAAT); D.4 (GRHKAL, 3′-AAGAGCTTTGTGGCGCCC); G.1 (MFSSVE, 5′-ATGTTCTCCTCTGTGGAG); G.2 (LGFLFM, 3′-CATGAAGAGGAACCCCAA); G.3 (ASPVVM, 5′-GCCAGTCCAGTTGTGATG); and G.4 (SARERQ, 3′-CTGTCGCTCCCTGGCTGA). Each half of the corresponding pSCR was amplified by PCR, gel-purified using QIAEX reagants (Life Technologies, Inc.), and labeled using a nick translation kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The probes were used to screen 2.5 × 106 phage plaques of an EMBL3 rat genomic library (CLONTECH) according to established procedures (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 2.82-2.107Google Scholar). To identify SCR D clones, duplicate lifts were taken, and one lift was screened with the D.1-D.2 probe and the other with the D.3-D.4 probe. Fifty-two co-hybridizing plaques were identified, and 10 plaques were purified by two additional rounds of screening. The same technique was used to identify SCR G clones. For the SCR G screen, 221 co-hybridizing plaques were identified, and 10 plaques were purified by two additional rounds of screening. Purified phage were used to infect K803 cells (CLONTECH), and phage DNA were isolated using the lambda prep kit (Promega). Phage DNA was double strand sequenced directly using the fluorescent terminator method of cycle sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 373a automated DNA sequencer at the DNA Analysis Facility of The Johns Hopkins University (21McCombie W.R. Heiner C. Kelly J.M. Fitzgerald M.G. Gocayne J.D. DNA Seq. 1992; 2: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 22Smith L.M. Sander J.Z. Kaiser R.J. Hughes P. Dodd C. Connel C.R. Heiner C. Kent S.B. Hood L.E. Nature. 1986; 321: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used for sequencing were synthesized on an ABI 394 synthesizer following ABI protocols. DNA sequence data was analyzed using Sequencher software (Gene Codes). SCR amino acid alignments were conducted using the MacVector program (Oxford Molecular Group). SCR hydropathy data were obtained by Kyte-Doolittle analysis (23Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17215) Google Scholar) using MacVector. A putative phylogenetic tree relating SCRs to previously cloned full-length OdR sequences was constructed using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean analysis (24Nei M. Molecular Evolutionary Genetics. Columbia University Press, New York, NY1987: 287-326Crossref Google Scholar, 25Fitch W.M. Margoliash E. Science. 1967; 155: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar) of the Geneworks program (Oxford Molecular Group). Riboprobes for RNase protection assays corresponding to D.1-D.4 and G.1-G.4 were in vitrotranscribed off of pCRII-pSCR D and pCRII-pSCR G using T7 RNA polymerase (MAXIscript kit, Ambion) and [α-32P]UTP (NEN Life Science Products). Riboprobes were run on 6% polyacrylamide, 8m urea precast TBE gels (Novex) and were gel-purified. RNase protection assays were performed using the RPA II kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To determine riboprobe sizes on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels for comparison with protected fragments, the sense transcripts for pSCR D and pSCR G were in vitro transcribed using SP6 RNA polymerase. Antisense riboprobes were incubated for 24 h at 45 °C with sense RNA, 10 μg of cesium chloride purified total RNA from pachytene spermatocytes, round spermatids, and olfactory epithelium, and 0.5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH) from adult testis, lung, brain, liver, and spleen. Ten μg of yeast RNA was used as a control. The integrity of total and poly(A)+ RNA employed was evaluated by running RPAs in parallel using a rat β-actin antisense riboprobe generated from the pTRI-β-actin-125-rat template (Ambion). RNase-treated samples were precipitated and run on non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide TBE gels (Novex). The gels were transferred to Whatman filter paper and exposed to Kodak X-OMat film or evaluated by phosphorimaging. In situ hybridization using digoxigenin-labeled probes was conducted using full-length SCRs D-2, D-8, and G-14 coding sequence and the novel 5′-SCR D RACE and SCR G RACE sequence. Fresh-frozen 20-mm cryostat sections of rat testis (2-, 6-, and 10-week-old rats as indicated) were cut onto Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher), allowed to air dry 1–3 h, and postfixed for 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline. When expression patterns in the testis were compared between probes, serial sections were utilized. The slides were washed 3 × for 3 min in TBS, treated 10 min in 0.25% acetic anhydride, 0.1 mtriethanolamine, pH 8.0, washed 3 × for 3 min in TBS, and prehybridized for 2 h at room temperature in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 500 mg/ml sonicated herring sperm DNA, 250 mg/ml MRE tRNA). The tissue was incubated with 0.1 ml of buffer containing 40 ng of cRNA probe under a siliconized coverslip at 65 °C overnight. After removal of the coverslips in 5× SSC at 65 °C, sections were washed as follows: 2 × for 1 h in 0.2× SSC, 1 × for 5 min in 0.2× SSC, and 1 × for 5 min in TBS. Following a 1-h block at room temperature in 4% normal goat serum/TBS, the slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 1:5000 dilution of anti-DIG Fab fragment (Boehringer Mannheim) in 4% normal goat serum/TBS. Sections were then washed 3 × for 5 min in TBS and 1 × for 5 min in AP buffer (0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 9.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2). The color signal was developed in AP buffer containing 3.375 mg/ml NBT (Boehringer Mannheim), 3.5 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Boehringer Mannheim), and 0.24 mg/ml levamisole. The color reaction was carried out in the dark for 24–72 h at room temperature and then terminated with a TE wash. The developed slides were coverslipped with Aquapolymount (Polysciences). Control sections were hybridized with identical quantities of sense cRNA, and no signal was observed. Thein situ hybridization protocol has been utilized to distinguish the localizations of transcripts sharing as much as 85–90% nucleic acid identity (6Vassar R. Ngai J. Axel R. Cell. 1993; 74: 309-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 26Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8074-8082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5′-RACE-PCR was conducted using the Life Technologies, Inc. 5′-RACE kit. One μg of adult testis poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH) was reverse-transcribed (Superscript II RT, Life Technologies, Inc.) using 25 ng of the SCR D specific 3′-primer D.2. First strand cDNA was purified and oligo(dC)-tailed according to the manufacturer's protocol. dC-tailed cDNA was amplified using the anchor primer and primer D.6 (PGECFL, 3′-GAGGAAGCATTCTCCAGG), a nested SCR D-specific 3′-primer. Products resulting from PCR reactions that contained dC-tailed cDNA, but not present in reactions using mock dC-tailed control cDNA, were gel-purified (QIAEX, Qiagen) and reamplified by PCR with the adapter primer and primer D.6. To confirm the presence of SCR D sequence in the RACE products, gel-purified bands were checked by PCR with D.5 (M(T/S)VNCS, 5′-ATGA(C/G)TGTCAACTGTTCT), a 5′-primer to the presumptive amino terminus of SCR D and D.6. If the appropriate 93-base pair D.5-D.6 product could be generated, the RACE product was subcloned into pCRII vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced with sp6 and T7 primers. The identical procedure was followed using the SCR G-specific 3′-primer G.2 to generate first strand cDNA, a nested SCR G-specific primer G.6 (YLASLMG, 3′-GCCCATGAGGGAGGCCAAGTA) for RACE-PCR with the anchor primer, and a 5′-primer to the presumptive amino terminus of SCR G, G.5 (MEWLM, 5′-ATGGAATGGCT(G/A)ATG), used with G.6 for PCR analysis of RACE products. To investigate the origin of the novel sequence identified upstream of the starting methionines of SCRs, genomic clones containing SCRs G-14, G-15, and D-9 were sequenced in the 5′ direction. PCR using primers designed against SCR D RACE sequence (5′-CGTGATGGGATCAGAAAT) and upstream SCR D-9 genomic sequence (3′-AGGATGTACCAAGATCAATGT) was also performed on SCR D-9 phage DNA to identify intervening sequence. To determine if SCR transcripts in spleen and olfactory tissue likewise undergo splicing, 1 μg of spleen poly(A)+ RNA and olfactory epithelium total RNA were reverse-transcribed as described above using primer G.2 to generate first strand cDNA. PCR was then conducted using a 5′-primer to the SCR G RACE sequence (5′-ACCACTCAAGATTTGCAC) and the 3′-G.6 primer; the products generated were TA-cloned and sequenced. In a search for OdR-like proteins that may serve functional roles in reproduction, we reasoned that the post-meiotic and actively differentiating cells of the testis would be most likely to express chemoreceptors physiologically relevant to mature spermatozoa. Accordingly, we purified round spermatids from rat testis (Fig. 1 a) to isolate total RNA from this select population of cells, and we conducted RT-PCR experiments using degenerate primers (OdR 1 and 2) designed against highly conserved regions of the OdR family. A robust product was generated using cDNA derived from the round spermatid total RNA (Fig. 1 b). The 520-bp product corresponded in size to the band generated from PCR using the control template F2, an originally cloned Buck and Axel OdR. Whereas a 520-bp product was also obtained from testis cDNA, no product was observed using whole brain cDNA. No products were generated when PCR was conducted using negative control samples from each tissue that were mock reverse-transcribed in the absence of reverse transcriptase. The spermatid PCR product was TA-subcloned, and subsequent EcoRI digestion of 14 clones revealed two recurrent restriction patterns, with the exception of clone B which did not contain an insert of the appropriate size (Fig. 1 c). DNA sequencing of 13 clones identified two distinct and unique sequences (Fig. 1 d) that aligned with members of the OdR family. All inserts were either identical to the sequence of clone D, which contained an internalEcoRI site, or matched the sequence of clone G. In contrast, sequencing of seven subcloned PCR products from the testis yielded seven different partial receptor sequences (data not shown), indicating that a multitude of receptor transcripts are generated in whole testis. To obtain full-length SCRs, we screened a rat genomic library using probes generated from the partial SCR clones (Fig. 1 d). Three distinct clones containing the pSCR D sequence were isolated and encode 321 amino acid proteins sharing >87% amino acid identity (Fig. 2 a). Three distinct clones containing the pSCR G sequence were also identified and encode 327 amino acid proteins sharing >86% amino acid identity (Fig. 2 b). The highly homologous clones within each family were determined to be individual gene products based on their unique 3′-genomic DNA sequence (Fig. 2, a and b). Hydropathy plots generated by Kyte-Doolittle analysis (23Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17215) Google Scholar) predict that the receptors contain seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TMDs) (Fig. 2, a and b). Multiple sequence alignment with previously cloned OdRs reveals that SCRs share sequence characteristics of the superfamily, with conserved motifs in TMDs 2, 6, and 7 and in the extracellular loop between TMDs 3 and 4. To conceptualize the relationship of SCRs to other full-length OdR proteins, we constructed a putative phylogenetic tree using the Geneworks program (Fig. 3). Based on the program's unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean analysis (24Nei M. Molecular Evolutionary Genetics. Columbia University Press, New York, NY1987: 287-326Crossref Google Scholar, 25Fitch W.M. Margoliash E. Science. 1967; 155: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar), the SCR G family is the most evolutionary divergent of all members of the OdR superfamily. The clustering of OdRs does not appear to correlate with tissue source or species of origin. For example, the SCR D family is only 35% identical to SCR G receptors and is more closely related to select mouse OdRs (OR3 and OR37) than to chemoreceptors expressed in dog and human testis (DTMT and HGMPO7I, -E, and -J). RNase protection assays were used to confirm the presence of SCR D and G transcripts in spermatids of the testis. Full-length protection of SCR D and G riboprobes was observed with total RNA from round spermatids but not with RNA purified from spermatocytes in the pachytene stage of meiosis (Fig. 4). Full-length RNase protection was likewise achieved using total RNA from olfactory tissue, with multiple partially protected products generated by the SCR G riboprobe. Hybridization of antisense probes with the corresponding sense cRNAs served as markers for full-length protection. The integrity of template RNA was confirmed using a 125-bp β-actin riboprobe. In experiments utilizing poly(A+) RNA, we observed full-length protection of SCR riboprobes in testis, with a less robust but detectable product in spleen. No RNase protection occurred with the yeast control RNA or with poly(A+) RNA from brain, lung, or liver. In situ hybridization was used to localize SCRs D and G in rat testis (Fig. 5). The expression of SCRs D and G is developmentally regulated, with the absence of detectable RNA message at age 2 weeks, when the seminiferous epithelium contains spermatogonia and spermatocytes but no spermatids (Fig. 5,a and b). SCR D and G transcripts were detected in select seminiferous tubule cross-sections of 6-week-old sexually maturing rats; by this stage of puberty, round spermatids are being produced by the second meiotic division (Fig. 5, c–f). Prominent hybridization with SCR D and G riboprobes was observed in 10-week-old rat testis (Fig. 5, g and h). The specific labeling seen with the antisense riboprobes was absent when sections were incubated with the corresponding sense riboprobes (Fig. 5, i and j). In rat, the cellular composition of seminiferous tubule epithelium varies along the length of the tubule according to a 14-stage growth cycle (27Dym M. Clermont Y. Am. J. Anat. 1970; 18: 265-281Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Thus, different cross-sectional segments contain distinct groupings of spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids at a characteristic stage of rat spermatogenesis. High power images of in situ hybridization experiments with SCR D and G riboprobes demonstrated the absence of RNA message in spermatogonia and spermatocytes located peripherally to spermatids in the seminiferous tubule cross-sections (Fig. 5,e and f). In contrast, the more adluminal round and elongating spermatids showed robust hybridization with SCR riboprobes (Fig. 5, e and f). The SCR mRNA pattern is consistent with the localization of OdR protein to elongating spermatids in rat testis using antibodies generated against conserved OdR peptide sequences (8Walensky L.D. Roskams A.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Snyder S.H. Ronnett G.V. Mol. Med. 1995; 1: 130-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in dog testis using fusion protein antibodies directed against the DTMT receptor (9Vanderhaeghen P. Schurmans S. Vassart G. Parmentier M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1441-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Several observations prompted us to pursue a comparative analysis of SCR cDNA and 5′-genomic sequence. 1) The splice acceptor sequence (28Mount S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (2784) Google Scholar), TTTCTTTCAGG, occurred immediately upstream of the presumptive starting methionine in the genomic sequence of SCRs D-2, -8, and -9. 2) In situhybridization studies comparing the localization of SCR D and G transcripts in serial sections of sexually mature testis revealed overlapping but also non-overlapping mRNA patterns among seminiferous tubule cross-sections (data not shown). This finding, coupled with the observed developmental expression of SCRs, suggested that distinct transcriptional and/or translational controls may govern the production of SCRs. 3) The introduction of constructs containing OdR coding sequences into transgenic mice has failed to produce detectable expression of OdR proteins. 3R. Reed, personal communication. We reasoned that the functional expression of OdR proteins may require 5′-translated or -untranslated spliced sequence for message stability, membrane targeting, and/or receptor function. RACE-PCR experiments were conducted by employing SCR D- and SCR G-specific 3′-primers to generate first strand cDNAs from testis poly(A)+ RNA. RACE-PCR using the anchor primer and nested SCR 3′-primers yielded products for both SCRs D and G. SCR D RACE products contained sequence upstream of the SCR D-8 presumptive starting methionine that was distinct from the genomic clone, providing evidence of 5′-splicing (Fig. 6 a). Interestingly, the novel sequence encodes an upstream open reading frame of 20 amino acids starting with a methionine at nt −60 which is preceded by a stop codon at nt −75. Theoretically, the RACE cDNA sequence could encode a 5′-MREPIPQSRHVLKEEGFCLE amino-terminal extension, which is hydrophilic by Kyte-Doolittle analysis (23Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17215) Google Scholar). Sequences of the SCR G RACE products are identical to the genomic SCR G-14 clone up to nt −73, at which point novel upstream sequence was identified (Fig. 6 b). At position −90, a stop codon occurs, and no alternative methionine is encoded downstream. As could also be the case for SCR D, the novel SCR G RACE sequence likely represents 5′-untranslated sequence. To confirm that the clones obtained by RACE-PCR represent 5′-splice products, SCR genomic clones were restriction digested withEcoRI/BamHI orHindIII/EcoRV, and Southern analysis was performed using probes corresponding to the novel 5′-sequence. The SCR G RACE probe, for example, recognized bands in SCR G-14 and G-15 digests, indicating that the novel 5′-RACE sequence was contained in the phage insert (data not shown). Sequencing of the SCR G-14 genomic clone identified the identical 140-bp SCR G RACE sequence 1475 bp upstream of the starting methionine (Fig. 7). In the SCR G-15 clone, sequence 88% identical to SCR G RACE was found 3503 bp upstream of the starting methionine (Fig. 7). In both cases, a splice acceptor site precedes the starting methionine by 73 bp. 5′-Sequencing and PCR experiments also led to identification of homologous SCR D RACE sequence in the upstream genomic DNA of SCR clone D-9 (data not shown). In contrast to SCR G receptors, the SCR D splice acceptor sequence occurs immediately adjacent to the presumptive starting methionine. To determine if splicing of SCR transcripts likewise occurs in spleen and olfactory epithelium, PCR experiments were conducted using the 5′-SCR G RACE and 3′-nested G.6 primers on first strand cDNAs generated from both tissues with primer G.2. The identically spliced SCR G-14 product originally obtained from testis was detected in both spleen and olfactory epithelium, indicating that 5′-splicing of this SCR is a common phenomenon in these tissues. To localize the spliced RNA sequences in rat testis, we conductedin situ hybridization studies using probes corresponding to the novel 5′-RACE sequences (Fig. 8 b and data not shown). The 5′-spliced sequences were detected in adluminal spermatids, with robust hybridization occurring in seminiferous tubule profiles throughout the testis. Whereas in situ hybridization with a full-length SCR D-8 probe-labeled spermatids of select tubule profiles (Fig. 8 a), a serial section incubated with a probe to the novel 5′-SCR D RACE sequence displayed a strong signal in many more profiles (Fig. 8 b). This finding indicates that the 5′-spliced sequence is present in multiple mRNAs, in addition to the subset of SCR D-8 mRNAs localized by the specific probe. This conclusion is consistent with our identification of conserved RACE sequence in the upstream genomic DNA of distinct members of a given SCR family.

Structural data show that HMG-17 was efficiently incorporated into the chromatin and induced an extended chromatin structure. Using an in vitro SV40 replication system, we find that minichromosomes containing HMG-17 replicate with higher efficiency than minichromosomes deficient of HMG-17.

The eukaryotic genome is packaged by histone and non-histone proteins into a highly condensed complex termed chromatin (reviewed in Refs. 1van Holde K.E. Chromatin.

As a consequence, efficient transcription and replication require mechanisms that relieve the repressive activity of the chromatin structure. Recently, several ATP-dependent nucleosome remodelling factors, which seem to be required for the initiation of transcription from nucleosomally organized promotor sequences have been identified (10Tsukiyama T.

One of the features commonly associated with transcriptionally active chromatin is an increase in the content of non-histone chromosomal proteins (1van Holde K.E. Chromatin.

The high mobility group (HMG) 1The abbreviation used is: HMG, high mobility group. 1The abbreviation used is: HMG, high mobility group. chromosomal proteins are among the most abundant and ubiquitous non-histone proteins found in nuclei of all higher eukaryotes (reviewed in Refs. 23Bustin M.

The HMG-14/-17 subgroup is the only known class of nuclear proteins which bind specifically to the nucleosomal core particle, each nucleosome contains two binding sites for either chromosomal protein HMG-14 or HMG-17 (25Madrian J.K.

In the cell nucleus, the amount of these proteins is smaller than the number of nucleosomes. Consequently, HMG-14 and HMG-17 are associated with only a subset of the nucleosomes. A variety of experiments have shown that HMG-14/-17 are preferentially associated with chromatin subunits containing transcribed genes. The role of chromosomal proteins HMG-14 and HMG-17 in the generation of transcriptionally active chromatin was studied in Xenopusegg extracts with a chromatin template carrying the 5 S rRNA gene (26Crippa M.P. Trieschmann L. Alfonso P.J. Wolffe A.P. Bustin M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar,27Trieschmann L. Alfonso P.J. Crippa M.P. Wolffe A.P. Bustin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1478-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The experiments showed that HMG-14/-17 enhance the transcriptional potential of RNA polymerase III genes by increasing the turnover of transcriptionally active templates. The ability of HMG proteins to stimulate transcription from chromatin templates was further demonstrated with SV40 minichromosomes, isolated from CV-1 cells overexpressing HMG-14. These experiments revealed that elevated levels of HMG-14 stimulate the rate of transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II but not the level of transcriptional initiation (28Ding H.-F. Rimsky S. Batson S.C. Bustin M. Hansen U. Science. 1994; 265: 796-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, Paranjape et al. (29Paranjape S.M. Krumm A. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1978-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) demonstrated that HMG-17, in conjunction with the sequence-specific activator GAL4-VP16, stimulates the initiation of transcription. Although the mechanism whereby HMG-14/-17 stimulate transcription from chromatin templates is not fully understood, recent experiments suggest that the proteins unfold the higher order chromatin structure (27Trieschmann L. Alfonso P.J. Crippa M.P. Wolffe A.P. Bustin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1478-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30Graziano V. Ramakrishnan V. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 897-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, HMG-containing minichromosomes sediment slower in sucrose gradients and are digested faster by various nucleases than minichromosomes lacking HMG-14/-17 (27Trieschmann L. Alfonso P.J. Crippa M.P. Wolffe A.P. Bustin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1478-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, neutron scattering experiments on the binding of HMG-14/-17 to salt-washed chromatin suggest that the proteins decrease the mass per unit length of the chromatin fiber (30Graziano V. Ramakrishnan V. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 897-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, changes in higher order structure seem to be the main mechanism whereby HMG-14/-17 enhance the transcriptional potential of chromatin. A reduction in compactness may facilitate access of various components of the transcriptional machinery to their target. Changes in chromatin structure also influence the processes of chromatin replication (9Gruss C. Knippers R. Cohn W.E. Moldave K. Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 337-365Google Scholar). A stimulation of replication has thus been shown to be accompanied by a relaxation of the underlying chromatin structure (31Quintini G. Treuner K. Gruss C. Knippers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2888-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 32Halmer L. Gruss C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1420-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). So far, little is known about the influence of HMG proteins on the replication efficiency of chromatin templates. To this end, we have investigated the replication of minichromosomes assembled in the absence or presence of HMG-17 proteins. We found that minichromosomes assembled in the presence of HMG-17 have a more extended chromatin structure than minichromosomes devoid of HMG-17 and that these minichromosomes replicate with significantly higher efficiency compared with minichromosomes deficient of HMG proteins. Xenopus laevis unfertilized egg extract was prepared as described previously (33Almouzni G. Mechali M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4355-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 34Almouzni G. Mechali M.

A. 1986; 83: 1646-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was cloned into double-stranded M13 DNA. Single-stranded M13 DNA, containing the SV40 origin, was assembled into chromatin during complementary DNA strand synthesis for 2 h at 22 °C under previously described conditions (36Almouzni G. Clark D.J. Mechali M. Wolffe A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5767-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 37Almouzni G. Mechali M. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) in the absence of exogenously added ATP and MgCl2. Recombinant human HMG-17 proteins (38Bustin, M., Becerra, P. S., Crippa, M. P., Lehn, D. A., Pash, J. M., and Shiloach, J. (1991) 19, 3115–3121.Google Scholar) were added at the beginning of the chromatin assembly reaction in a molar ratio of HMG:nucleosome core of 70:1 or to reconstituted chromatin in a ratio of 1:1, 2:1, 5:1, and 10:1. Assembled chromatin was purified on 10–30% sucrose gradients (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.25% Triton X-100) containing either 70 or 400 mm KCl and centrifuged in an SW 40 rotor for 2.5 h at 40,000 rpm at 4 °C (26Crippa M.P. Trieschmann L. Alfonso P.J. Wolffe A.P. Bustin M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Chromatin-containing fractions were identified by agarose gel electrophoresis, pooled, and concentrated by centrifugation over a 30% sucrose cushion (SW 55 rotor, 16 h, 31,000 rpm, 4 °C). Chromatin was resuspended in hypotonic buffer (20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol). 1 μg of single-stranded M13ori DNA was assembled into chromatin in the presence of 5 μCi [α-32P]dATP for 2 h at 22 °C in the absence or presence of HMG protein and purified on sucrose gradients. Chromatin-containing fractions were identified by trichloroacetic acid precipitation of the individual fractions and agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography. An aliquot of the assembly reaction was removed after the indicated time points and stopped with stop solution (20 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.25% SDS). Samples were deproteinized by proteinase K treatment and phenol extraction, loaded on a 0.8% agarose gel, and visualized by autoradiography. For topoisomer analysis, samples were separated on 0.8% agarose gels containing 20 μm chloroquine. SV40 T-Ag was prepared from insect cells (Sf9) infected with a recombinant baculovirus (39Lanford R.E. Virology. 1988; 167: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) by immunoaffinity chromatography (40Simanis V. Lane D.P. Virology. 1985; 144: 88-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Cytosolic HeLa S100 extracts were prepared exactly as described (41Stillman B.W. Gluzman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2051-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In standard experiments, 300 ng of chromatin, assembled in the absence or presence of HMG proteins, were incubated with 1 μg of T-Ag and 250 μg of cytosolic extract proteins in a 50-μl reaction for 2 h at 37 °C exactly as described (42Gruss C. Wu J. Koller T. Sogo J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4533-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For determination of the incorporated nucleotides, 1/10 of the replication assay was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. For restriction analysis, the replication products were purified as described (42Gruss C. Wu J. Koller T. Sogo J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4533-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and digested for 1 h at 37 °C with 5 units each of the restriction enzymesClaI, AvaII, and MscI in the recommended buffer (Biolabs). The restriction fragments were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels in 1× TBE (43Maniatis T. Fritsch E.E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor1982Google Scholar) and visualized by autoradiography. Purified minichromosomes were diluted into triethanolamine buffer (10 mm, pH 7.5) and fixed with glutaraldehyde (final concentration of 0.1%). Samples were processed by using the benzyldimethylalkylammonium chloride spreading technique of Vollenweider et al. (44Vollenweider H.J. Sogo J. Koller T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) as described in detail before (45Wessel R. Schweizer J. Stahl H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 804-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 300 ng of the sucrose gradient purified minichromosomes preparations were separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE (46Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) and blotted to a Teflon membrane. HMG-17 antibodies (47Bustin M. Crippa M.P. Pash J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20077-20080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were diluted 1:1000 in Tris-buffered saline with Tween buffer. All the other steps were exactly done as described in the protocol for ECL Western blotting from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. To investigate the influence of HMG-17 on DNA replication in the context of a chromatin template, single-stranded circular M13 DNA containing the SV40 origin sequences was used as a template for complementary strand synthesis in high speed supernatants ofXenopus egg extracts. Complementary DNA strands are synthesized on added single-stranded DNA concomitantly with nucleosome assembly (48Mechali M. Harland R.M. Cell. 1982; 30: 93-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Assembled minichromosomes were then used as template in the SV40 in vitro replication system. Complementary DNA strand synthesis was done for 2 h at 22 °C inXenopus egg extracts in the absence or presence of HMG-17. Purified HMG-17 was added at the beginning of the reaction at a level comparable with that of the histones in the Xenopus extract. As has been shown before, HMG 17 is not present in Xenopusegg extracts (26Crippa M.P. Trieschmann L. Alfonso P.J. Wolffe A.P. Bustin M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Prior to carrying out the replicational analysis in the SV40 in vitro replication system, it was essential to determine whether HMG-17 was incorporated efficiently and properly into the chromatin. We therefore purified assembled chromatin on sucrose gradients containing 70 mm KCl and analyzed it first by immunoblotting with HMG-17 specific antibodies (Fig. 1 A). By comparison with the intensities of HMG marker proteins, the amount of HMG incorporated into the assembled chromatin corresponded to the physiological ratio of 2 HMG molecules per nucleosome. The data is in agreement with mobility shift assays which had demonstrated that in this assembly system the HMG proteins are associated with nucleosomes (26Crippa M.P. Trieschmann L. Alfonso P.J. Wolffe A.P. Bustin M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Likewise, polyacrylamide gel analysis of the proteins present in the purified chromatin confirmed our previous results, indicating that the assembled chromatin contains a full complement of histones and HMG (data not shown). Thus, HMG-17 was properly assembled into chromatin, and the presence of HMG-17 did not affect the content of histones in the assembled template. The effect of HMG-17 on the efficiency of chromatin assembly was then examined by DNA supercoiling analysis (Fig. 1 B). In aXenopus egg extract, single-stranded DNA is replicated and assembled into regularly spaced chromatin in a time-dependent manner (33Almouzni G. Mechali M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4355-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 34Almouzni G. Mechali M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The kinetics of the assembly of the replicated DNA into chromatin can be monitored by the appearance of supercoiled DNA. The data show that the rate of chromatin assembly was not affected by the presence of HMG-17. After 30 min, some topoisomers are still visible, and after 120 min, the molecules were completely assembled into chromatin in both cases (Fig. 1 B). For a further comparison of the number of nucleosomes assembled in the absence or presence of HMG-17, reconstituted chromatin was investigated by separation on chloroquine gels (Fig. 1 C) and by electron microscopy (Fig. 1 D). As revealed by both techniques, the presence of HMG-17 did not affect the number of nucleosomes assembled onto the plasmid. Analysis of the minichromosomes visualized by electron microscopy showed that the number of nucleosomes assembled in the absence and presence of HMG-17 was 34 ± 2 nucleosomes (Fig. 1 D). Thus, HMG-17 did not affect the histone composition or the number of nucleosomes in the minichromosomes. It has been suggested that incorporation of HMG-17 into nascent nucleosomes induces an extended chromatin conformation (27Trieschmann L. Alfonso P.J. Crippa M.P. Wolffe A.P. Bustin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1478-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Since our results clearly demonstrate that HMG-17 protein does not affect the number of nucleosomes in the minichromosomes and since we anticipate that changes in chromatin conformation may affect the rate of replication of a chromatin template, we tested whether HMG-17 also affects the structure of the minichromosomes under our assembly conditions. To investigate the effect of HMG-17 on the chromatin structure, minichromosomes assembled in the presence of [α-32P]dATP in either the absence or presence of HMG-17 were sedimented through sucrose gradients containing 70 or 400 mm KCl. Chromatin-containing fractions were identified by trichloroacetic acid precipitation of the individual fractions and agarose gel electrophoresis. On gradients containing 70 mmsalt minichromosomes assembled in the presence of HMG-17 sedimented significantly slower than chromatin reconstituted in the absence of HMG-17 (Fig. 2 A). Thus, in agreement with previous studies (27Trieschmann L. Alfonso P.J. Crippa M.P. Wolffe A.P. Bustin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1478-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), minichromosomes assembled in the presence of HMG-17 seem to have a more open conformation than those lacking HMG-17. Purification on gradients containing 400 mmsalt, which causes the removal of the HMG-17 protein from chromatin (compare Fig. 1 A, 400 mm) sedimentation differences between chromatin, which was reconstituted in the absence or presence of HMG-17 protein, disappear (Fig. 2 B). Both types of minichromosomes sediment slightly slower on gradients containing 400 mm salt compared with the sedimentation on gradients containing 70 mm salt, which is due to the removal of other non-histone proteins from the minichromosomes at 400 mm salt. These data demonstrate that the observed differences in chromatin structure are due to the presence of the HMG-17 protein. Equal amounts of minichromosomes that were assembled in either the absence or presence of HMG-17 and purified over sucrose gradients containing 70 or 400 mm KCl were used as templates in the SV40 in vitro replication system. In these experiments, the minichromosomes were incubated for 2 h in the presence of the SV40 T-Ag and [α-32P]dATP to label the newly synthesized DNA. Replication products were purified and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (Fig. 3, A and C). The incorporation of radioactive nucleotides was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation (Fig. 3, B and D). When we purified minichromosomes on gradients containing 70 mm salt, we found that the replication efficiency of minichromosomes containing HMG-17 was ∼3-fold higher than that of minichromosomes lacking HMG-17. The increase in replication efficiency is evident from the higher amounts of both replicative intermediates (Fig. 3 A, RI) and of completely replicated molecules (Fig. 3 A, between form II and form I). Additionally, in the presence of HMG-17, more topoisomers are visible in the replicated DNA. This is due to a limited chromatin assembly in this system, which is not sufficient to package higher amounts of replicated DNA completely into chromatin (42Gruss C. Wu J. Koller T. Sogo J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4533-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 49Krude T. Knippers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6257-6267Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and therefore distinct topoisomers appear between forms I and II DNA. Control experiments were performed in the absence of the SV40 T-Ag, and in this case, no incorporation of nucleotides was measured, which demonstrates that the observed incorporation is not due to repair synthesis (data not shown). When we used minichromosomes, which were purified on sucrose gradients containing 400 mm salt as template for in vitro replication, differences in replication efficiency between minichromosomes assembled in the absence or presence of HMG-17 disappeared (Fig. 3, C and D). This demonstrates that the observed differences in replication efficiency (Fig. 3, A and B) are due to the presence of HMG-17 on chromatin. The increase in the replication efficiency could be due to either a direct effect of HMG-17 on the replication apparatus or to changes in the chromatin structure leading to a more efficient production of replicated molecules. To distinguish between these two possibilities, increasing amounts of HMG-17 were added to the replication assay of minichromosomes that were assembled in the absence of HMG-17 (Fig. 4 A). In a separate set of experiments, increasing amounts of HMG-17 were added to the replication assay of protein-free, double-stranded M13ori DNA (Fig. 4 B). Purified replication products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. We found that the addition of HMG-17 up to a 10-fold excess had no effect on the replication efficiency of chromatin templates (Fig. 4 A). Higher amounts of added HMG-17 inhibited replication efficiency, presumably because some of the protein incorrectly binds to the linker DNA and inhibits access of replication proteins to their target (data not shown). This result demonstrates that HMG-17 enhances the rate of replication of minichromosomes only when incorporated into chromatin during nucleosome assembly. Addition of HMG-17 to the in vitro replication assay of protein-fee DNA had no effect on replication efficiency (Fig. 4 B), which demonstrates that the observed stimulation of replication is specific for chromatin and not due to a general stimulation of the replication efficiency by HMG-17. The HMG-17-dependent stimulation of replication efficiency could be due to either a more efficient initiation of replication or to an increase in the rate at which the replicative fork moves along the replicated template. To address this point, replicating minichromosomal DNA was digested with restriction endonucleases to separate the SV40 origin-containing fragment from flanking DNA segments and the termination region (Fig. 5 A). Minichromosomes assembled in either the absence or presence of HMG-17 were replicated for the indicated times (Fig. 5 B). The deproteinized DNA was then digested with the restriction endonucleasesAvaII, ClaI, and MscI and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Autoradiograms of restriction fragments (Fig. 5 B) show that both in the absence and in the presence of HMG-17, nucleotides were incorporated first into the origin fragment (Fig. 5 A, fragment a) and then, after a short delay, into both flanking DNA segments (fragments b and c) and finally into the termination region (fragment d). Thus, replication occurs in a bidirectional manner regardless of whether the minichromosomes contain HMG-17 protein or not. However, quantitative analysis indicates that HMG-17 protein significantly affects the kinetics of nucleotide incorporation into the various regions of the minichromosome. We determined the relative intensities of the autoradiographic signals from each DNA segment by laser scanning densitometry and plotted the values as a function of replication times (Fig. 5 C). These data show that nucleotides were incorporated with higher efficiency into the origin fragment of HMG-17-containing chromatin compared with HMG-17-free chromatin. This result suggests that the presence of HMG-17 facilitates initiation of replication. To evaluate the elongation rates of the two different templates, the mean values of the intensities of fragments b, c, and fragment d, determined by laser densitometric scanning of the autoradiogram, were represented in a fitted line against the replication time. The slopes of the lines were different and indicate that the rate of elongation in minichromosomes containing HMG-17 was faster than in minichromosomes devoid of HMG-17. Thus we conclude, that the presence of HMG-17 stimulates both the initiation of replication and the rate of replication fork movement along the chromatin template. Our major finding is that chromosomal protein HMG-17 enhances the rate of replication of a chromatin template, but not that of a DNA template. We present evidence that the timing of deposition of the HMG into the chromatin template is an important step in the generation of a chromatin template with an increased rate of replication. Addition of HMG-17 to chromatin does not increase the rate of replication. Based on the data presented here, and previously published results, we suggest that HMG-17 protein functions as an architectural element and unfolds the chromatin template. Assembly of the protein into nucleosomes reduces the overall compactness and therefore the repressive activity of the chromatin fiber. As demonstrated here, the unfolded chromatin fiber is more efficiently replicated and, also as was demonstrated elsewhere, is a better substrate for transcription by both RNA polymerase II and polymerase III. Chromatin was generated from a single-stranded circular DNA template by a coupled DNA replication-chromatin assembly process that was carried out, with Xenopus egg extracts, in either the absence or presence of HMG-17 protein. Analysis of the replication kinetics of these minichromosomes in the SV40 in vitro replication system showed that incorporation of nucleotides into the chromatin region containing the origin of replication is higher in minichromosomes containing HMG-17 as compared with minichromosomes devoid of this protein. What is the mechanism whereby the presence of HMG-17 stimulates the initiation of replication only in chromatin and not on DNA? Since in this system a nucleosome at the origin inhibits the initiation of replication (42Gruss C. Wu J. Koller T. Sogo J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4533-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 50Cheng L. Kelly T.J. Cell. 1989; 59: 541-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the presence of HMG allows initiation from a nucleosomal origin. We feel that this is unlikely because we have demonstrated before that neither the acetylation of the core histones (20Alexiadis V. Halmer L. Gruss C. Chromosoma. 1997; 105: 324-331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) nor the complete removal of the amino-terminal domains of the histones (31Quintini G. Treuner K. Gruss C. Knippers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2888-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) release the block imposed by nucleosomes on the SV40 origin. Thus, it seems unlikely that association of HMG-17 with the nucleosome is sufficient for opening of a nucleosomal origin to the replication machinery. We favor a second possibility, namely that the HMG-17 protein unfolds the higher order chromatin structure of the minichromosomes and thereby induces a more extended chromatin structure that is more accessible to the replication machinery. This results in a higher rate of initiation events of minichromosomes with a nucleosome-free origin. More importantly, the HMG-17-dependent stimulation of the rate of elongation of replication of the chromatin template is also in full agreement with the suggestion that the effect of HMG-17 is mediated through unfolding of the chromatin template. Recent experiments have shown that a more extended chromatin structure facilitates elongation of replication. Thus, minichromosomes where the amino-terminal histone domains were completely removed by trypsin treatment (31Quintini G. Treuner K. Gruss C. Knippers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2888-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have a more extended chromatin structure and replicate with higher efficiency than control chromatin. Furthermore, minichromosomes with hyperacetylated core histones (20Alexiadis V. Halmer L. Gruss C. Chromosoma. 1997; 105: 324-331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed a higher rate of replication fork movement than control minichromosomes. Recent experiments have shown that the chromatin structure can regulate the accessibility for topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II to the chromatin and thus the replication efficiency of the template (51Halmer L. Gruss C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2624-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). One possibility for the increased replication efficiency of HMG-containing chromatin could be the facilitated access of topoisomerases to this chromatin. What might be the in vivo function of HMG-17 during DNA replication? HMG proteins are preferentially associated with chromatin subunits containing transcribed genes (52Druckmann S.E. Mendelson E. Landsman D. Bustin M. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 166: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 53Postnikov Y.V. Shick V.V. Belyavsky A.V. Khrapko K.R. Brodolin K.L. Nikolskaya T.A. Mirzabekov A.D. Nucleic Acid Res. 1991; 19: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Transcriptionally active chromatin is preferentially replicated early in S-phase (54DePamphilis M.L. Trends Cell. Biol. 1993; 3: 161-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Conceivably, early replicating DNA could contain a higher amount of HMG proteins than late replicating DNA. In addition, transcriptional active chromatin is enriched in hyperacetylated histones which has been shown to facilitate the access of transcription factors to their target sequences (55Lee D.Y. Jeffrey J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 73-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 56Vettese-Dadey M. Grant P.A. Hebbes T.R. Crane-Robinson C. Allis C.D. Workman J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2508-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and to cause an increase in transcriptional initiation and elongation on chromatin templates (57Ura K. Kurumizaka H. Dimitrov S. Almouzni S. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2096-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Furthermore SV40 minichromosomes containing hyperacetylated histones replicate with higher efficiency than control minichromosomes in vitro(20Alexiadis V. Halmer L. Gruss C. Chromosoma. 1997; 105: 324-331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the interesting possibility arises that the association of chromatin with HMG proteins together with core histone acetylation may contribute to the regulation of early S-phase replication by facilitating the passage of the replication machinery.

https://openalex.org/W2014437609,"Decapentaplegic (Dpp) is a Drosophilamember of bone morphogenetic proteins, which belong to the transforming growth factor-β superfamily. Members of this family regulate a variety of biological processes such as cell proliferation, morphogenesis, immune response, and apoptosis. Dpp plays a critical role in many aspects of Drosophila development. Members of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily bind to two different types of serine/threonine kinase receptors, termed type I and type II. Type I receptors act as downstream components of type II receptors in the receptor complexes. Therefore, intracellular proteins that interact with the type I receptors are likely to play important roles in signaling. Several proteins have been identified through protein-protein interaction screenings. We identifiedDrosophila inhibitor of apoptosis (DIAP) 1 as an interacting protein of a Dpp type I receptor, Thick veins (Tkv). DIAP1 associates with Tkv in vivo. The binding region in DIAP1 is mapped to its C-terminal RING finger region. DIAP2, anotherDrosophila member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, also interacts with Tkv in vivo. These data suggest that DIAP1 and DIAP2 may be involved, possibly as negative regulators, in the Dpp signaling pathway, which leads to cell apoptosis. Decapentaplegic (Dpp) is a Drosophilamember of bone morphogenetic proteins, which belong to the transforming growth factor-β superfamily. Members of this family regulate a variety of biological processes such as cell proliferation, morphogenesis, immune response, and apoptosis. Dpp plays a critical role in many aspects of Drosophila development. Members of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily bind to two different types of serine/threonine kinase receptors, termed type I and type II. Type I receptors act as downstream components of type II receptors in the receptor complexes. Therefore, intracellular proteins that interact with the type I receptors are likely to play important roles in signaling. Several proteins have been identified through protein-protein interaction screenings. We identifiedDrosophila inhibitor of apoptosis (DIAP) 1 as an interacting protein of a Dpp type I receptor, Thick veins (Tkv). DIAP1 associates with Tkv in vivo. The binding region in DIAP1 is mapped to its C-terminal RING finger region. DIAP2, anotherDrosophila member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, also interacts with Tkv in vivo. These data suggest that DIAP1 and DIAP2 may be involved, possibly as negative regulators, in the Dpp signaling pathway, which leads to cell apoptosis.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 2Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3313) Google Scholar). Ligands of this superfamily have been identified in organisms from invertebrates to vertebrates. In Drosophila, three factors, Decapentaplegic (Dpp), 60A, and Screw, have been isolated, and all of them belong to the BMP subfamily (3Hogan B.L.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar, 4Padgett R.W. Savage C. Das P. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Dpp plays an important role during Drosophila development. Dpp acts as a morphogen to establish the patterning of the dorsal ectoderm. Dpp also regulates gut morphogenesis and growth of imaginal discs such as wings and eyes.Dpp has been an ideal molecule for studying the signaling mechanism of the TGF-β superfamily, because a wide range of genetic approaches are applicable in Drosophila. Mothers against dpp (Mad) was identified as a genetic enhancer of the dppphenotypes (5Sekelsky J.J. Newfeld S.J. Raftery L.A. Chartoff E.H. Gelbart W.M. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1347-1358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Maternally, Mad mutations exacerbated the embryonal leathality caused by dpp mutations. Madmutations also enhanced various dpp phenotypes associated with appendages such as wings, eyes, and claws in zygotes. Sma proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans are structurally similar to Mad (6Savage C. Das P. Finelli A.L. Townsend S.R. Sun C.Y. Baird S.E. Padgett R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 790-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). An increasing number of vertebrate homologs of Mad and Sma have been identified and are now generically denoted Smad. Eight different Smads (Smad1–Smad8) have been identified in mammals, and they are biochemically demonstrated to mediate signals of the TGF-β superfamily proteins (2Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3313) Google Scholar, 4Padgett R.W. Savage C. Das P. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 7Chen Y. Bhushan A. Vale W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12938-12943Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).Signals of TGF-β are transduced into the cell by two types of serine/threonine kinase receptors (1Kingsley D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 2Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3313) Google Scholar). The type II TGF-β receptor (TβR-II) is a constitutively active kinase. Upon ligand binding, TβR-II recruits and phosphorylates the type I TGF-β receptor (TβR-I). Phosphorylation of TβR-I occurs mainly at the GS domain, a glycine-serine-rich region highly conserved among the type I receptors. Mutation of threonine 204 in the GS domain to aspartic acid resulted in constitutive activation of TβR-I (8Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that TβR-I is the effector kinase that phosphorylates cytoplasmic substrates, now revealed as Smad2 and Smad3 (2Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3313) Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation by TβR-I, Smad2 and Smad3 form a complex with Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus where they activate transcription of the target genes.Yeast two-hybrid screenings using the cytoplasmic region of TβR-I or TβR-II as a bait have led to the identification of various proteins such as FKBP12 (9Wang T.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although farnesyl transferase-α is phosphorylated both in vitro and in vivo by TβR-I, little is known about its role in TGF-β signaling. FKBP12 binds to the juxtamembrane region of TβR-I. FKBP12 has been shown to prevent spontaneous activation of TβR-I by TβR-II (13Chen Y.G. Liu F. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3866-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). TRIP-1 and apolipoprotein J interact with TβR-II, but their functions in signal transduction of TGF-β remain to be determined.We employed the two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic region of Thick veins (Tkv), one of the type I receptors for Dpp (4Padgett R.W. Savage C. Das P. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). One positive clone encoded Drosophilainhibitor of apoptosis 1 (DIAP1), which is structurally similar to baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) (19Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1253-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Moreover, we show that Tkv interacts with DIAP1 in vivo. DIAP2, anotherDrosophila member of the IAP family (19Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1253-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar), also interacts with Tkv.RESULTSTo search for proteins that interact with Tkv, we employed the interaction trap screen developed by Brent and co-workers (21Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). ADrosophila imaginal disc cDNA library was screened with the cytoplasmic region of Tkv as a bait. 160,000 transformants were screened. Finally, four positive clones were isolated. One clone encoded Drosophila FKBP12, a homolog of human FKBP12 that is known as a binding protein for mammalian type I receptors, including TβR-I (9Wang T. Donahoe P.K. Zervos A.S. Science. 1994; 265: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 11Okadome T. Oeda E. Saitoh M. Ichijo H. Moses H.L. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3866-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) (data not shown). One of the other clones, termed PC1, encoded a partial C-terminal region of DIAP1 (Fig. 1 A), which is a homolog of baculovirus IAP (19Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1253-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). The remaining two positive clones were not analyzed. PCR using a Drosophila 4–8-h-old embryo cDNA library was performed to obtain the missing N-terminal region.We then examined the interaction of the full-length DIAP1 with Tkv using the interaction trap (Fig. 1 B). DIAP1 strongly interacted with the wild type Tkv, although its interaction was slightly weaker than that of the partial clone, PC1. Mutants of Tkv with different signaling activities were also tested for the interaction with DIAP1. One Tkv mutant replacing glutamine 253 with aspartic acid (QD), reported to have a constitutively kinase activity (22Wiersdorff V. Lecuit T. Cohen S.M. Mlodzik M. Development. 1996; 122: 2153-2162PubMed Google Scholar), showed strong interaction with DIAP1 as well as with PC1. Another mutant replacing lysine 281 with arginine (KR), which is expected to lack the kinase activity (8Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), showed weak interaction with DIAP1 and PC1. We also tested a deletion mutant lacking the juxtamembrane region (amino acids 205–254) where probable transphosphorylation sites by the type II receptor exist (8Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The mutant, Tkv (ΔJM), did not interact with PC1 or DIAP1. Contrary to Tkv, Saxophone (Sax), another Dpp type I receptor (20Penton A. Chen Y. Staehling H.K. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Szidonya J. Cassill J.A. Massagué J. Hoffmann F.M.

Thus, DIAP1 specifically interacted with Tkv in the yeast system.In Drosophila, two types of IAP are known (19Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1253-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). DIAP2, another Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis, has three baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domains, whereas DIAP1 has two BIR domains (Fig. 1 A). We tested whether DIAP2 interacts with Tkv. DIAP2 did not show interaction with the wild type or mutants of Tkv, Sax, or Punt in the yeast system (Fig. 1 B). To identify the interacting region of DIAP1 with Tkv, we constructed various truncated forms (TF) of DIAP1 (Fig. 1 A). The wild type Tkv showed interaction with TF4 that has only the RING finger domain but not with the other truncated forms (Fig. 1 C). Thus, the interacting region in DIAP1 is mapped to the RING finger domain. Sax and Punt did not interact with TF4.We next examined the interaction between DIAP1 and Tkv in vivo. DIAP1 was epitope-tagged with FLAG at the C terminus (DIAP1-FLAG). HA-tagged Tkv and/or DIAP1-FLAG were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Labeled lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA or anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies and then subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A). Each antibody specifically recognized Tkv-HA and DIAP1-FLAG, respectively (Fig. 2 A, fourth and seventh lanesfrom the left). Anti-FLAG antibody coprecipitated Tkv only when DIAP1 was expressed, demonstrating that DIAP1 interacts with Tkvin vivo (Fig. 2 A, ninth lane from the left). Both constitutively active (QD) and kinase-inactive (KR) mutants interacted with DIAP1 as efficiently as the wild type Tkv (Fig. 2 A, eleventh and thirteenth lanes from the left). The reason for the difference between this result in COS-7 cells and that in the yeast assay (Fig. 1 B) is not known, but the difference in mammalian cells and in yeast was also observed in the interaction of FKBP12 with TβR-I (11Okadome T. Oeda E. Saitoh M. Ichijo H. Moses H.L. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21687-21690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).We also tested the interaction of DIAP2 with Tkv in vivo. Tkv-HA and/or DIAP2-FLAG were transiently transfected in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2 B). Although the interaction of DIAP2 with Tkv was not detected in the yeast assay (Fig. 1 B), DIAP2 coprecipitated not only with the wild type Tkv but also with the QD and KR mutants in vivo.To determine the region of DIAP1 required for the interaction with Tkvin vivo, expression plasmids of the BIR domain (BIR-FLAG) and C-terminal region of DIAP1 (PC1-FLAG) were constructed (Fig. 3 A). Tkv-HA was coexpressed with BIR-FLAG or PC1-FLAG (Fig. 3 B). Tkv-HA was detected in a stable complex only with PC1-FLAG but not with BIR-FLAG (Fig. 3 B, eleventh and thirteenth lanes from the left). These results indicate that the interaction region of DIAP1 is the C terminus, which contains the RING finger domain, consistent with the results in the yeast assay. TF4-FLAG that has only the RING finger domain was tested, but the expression level was too low to detect interaction (data not shown).Figure 3Region of DIAP1 responsible for interaction with Tkv in vivo. A, shown is the schematic representation of the DIAP1 constructs used in the experiment. B, COS-7 cells were transfected with the wild type Tkv in combination with the BIR domain or RING finger domain of DIAP1. The arrows indicate the positions of Tkv and various forms of DIAP1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONMembers of the TGF-β superfamily regulate growth, differentiation, and apoptosis of various cell types. Recent data have clearly shown that Smad proteins transduce signals for the TGF-β superfamily proteins; however, it is likely that other signaling pathways may exist for the TGF-β superfamily. BMPs and TGF-β have been reported to induce apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo (29Zou H. Niswander L. Science. 1996; 272: 738-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 30Chen R.H. Chang T.Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 821-827PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, caspase family proteases, such as interleukin-1β converting enzyme (ICE), are involved in the apoptosis signals for the TGF-β superfamily (30Chen R.H. Chang T.Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 821-827PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not yet known whether Smads are involved in the apoptosis pathway.DIAP1 is a homolog of the baculovirus IAP that prevents cell apoptosis when virus infects cells. Recently, an increasing number of IAPs have been reported in virus (OpIAP, CpIAP) (31Crook N.E. Clem R.J. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2168-2174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Birnbaum M.J.

IAPs share conserved regions, i.e. two or three BIR domains at the N-terminal region and one RING finger domain at the C-terminal region, with an exception of neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein that has three BIR domains but not the RING finger domain. It has been reported that IAPs are able to prevent cell apoptosis induced by ICE (34Uren A.G. Pakusch M. Hawkins C.J. Puls K.L. Vaux D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4974-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 35Duckett C.S. Nava V.E. Gedrich R.W. Clem R.J. Van D.J. Gilfillan M.C. Shiels H. Hardwick J.M. Thompson C.B.

Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1 and 2 (36Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar), and tumor necrosis factor receptor-1-associated death domain protein, a 34-kDa cytoplasmic protein containing a C-terminal death domain (38Shu H.B. Takeuchi M. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13973-13978Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) were shown to associate with mammalian IAPs. Drosophila Doom, which induces apoptosis in insect cells, interacts with viral IAPs (39Harvey A.J. Bidwai A.P. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2835-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Reaper is a small polypeptide with 65 amino acids that induces apoptosis in Drosophila. DIAP2 prevents Reaper-induced cell death by binding to it (40Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Harvey A.J. Miller L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10183-10188Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). All of the five proteins above bind to IAPs through the BIR domains, whereas Tkv associates with DIAP1 through the RING finger domain.Mutations of DIAP1 enhanced apoptosis caused by Reaper, whereas overexpression of DIAPs in Drosophila eyes suppressed normally occurring cell death, causing rough eye phenotype (19Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1253-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Tkv QD mutant induces rough eye (22Wiersdorff V. Lecuit T. Cohen S.M. Mlodzik M. Development. 1996; 122: 2153-2162PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a possible involvement of Tkv in the apoptosis signal pathway. Our results suggest that Tkv may induce apoptosis by suppressing the DIAP1 function. Future studies will be directed to investigate how the interaction between Tkv and DIAP1 is regulated, which molecules are targets of Tkv-DIAP1 pathway, and whether Smad proteins are linked to the signaling activity of DIAP1.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 2Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3313) Google Scholar). Ligands of this superfamily have been identified in organisms from invertebrates to vertebrates. In Drosophila, three factors, Decapentaplegic (Dpp), 60A, and Screw, have been isolated, and all of them belong to the BMP subfamily (3Hogan B.L.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar, 4Padgett R.W. Savage C. Das P. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Dpp plays an important role during Drosophila development. Dpp acts as a morphogen to establish the patterning of the dorsal ectoderm. Dpp also regulates gut morphogenesis and growth of imaginal discs such as wings and eyes. Dpp has been an ideal molecule for studying the signaling mechanism of the TGF-β superfamily, because a wide range of genetic approaches are applicable in Drosophila. Mothers against dpp (Mad) was identified as a genetic enhancer of the dppphenotypes (5Sekelsky J.J. Newfeld S.J. Raftery L.A. Chartoff E.H. Gelbart W.M. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1347-1358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Maternally, Mad mutations exacerbated the embryonal leathality caused by dpp mutations. Madmutations also enhanced various dpp phenotypes associated with appendages such as wings, eyes, and claws in zygotes. Sma proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans are structurally similar to Mad (6Savage C. Das P. Finelli A.L. Townsend S.R. Sun C.Y. Baird S.E. Padgett R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 790-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). An increasing number of vertebrate homologs of Mad and Sma have been identified and are now generically denoted Smad. Eight different Smads (Smad1–Smad8) have been identified in mammals, and they are biochemically demonstrated to mediate signals of the TGF-β superfamily proteins (2Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3313) Google Scholar, 4Padgett R.W. Savage C. Das P.

A. 1997; 94: 12938-12943Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Signals of TGF-β are transduced into the cell by two types of serine/threonine kinase receptors (1Kingsley D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 2Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3313) Google Scholar). The type II TGF-β receptor (TβR-II) is a constitutively active kinase. Upon ligand binding, TβR-II recruits and phosphorylates the type I TGF-β receptor (TβR-I). Phosphorylation of TβR-I occurs mainly at the GS domain, a glycine-serine-rich region highly conserved among the type I receptors. Mutation of threonine 204 in the GS domain to aspartic acid resulted in constitutive activation of TβR-I (8Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that TβR-I is the effector kinase that phosphorylates cytoplasmic substrates, now revealed as Smad2 and Smad3 (2Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3313) Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation by TβR-I, Smad2 and Smad3 form a complex with Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus where they activate transcription of the target genes. Yeast two-hybrid screenings using the cytoplasmic region of TβR-I or TβR-II as a bait have led to the identification of various proteins such as FKBP12 (9Wang T. Donahoe P.K. Zervos A.S.

Although farnesyl transferase-α is phosphorylated both in vitro and in vivo by TβR-I, little is known about its role in TGF-β signaling. FKBP12 binds to the juxtamembrane region of TβR-I. FKBP12 has been shown to prevent spontaneous activation of TβR-I by TβR-II (13Chen Y.G. Liu F. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3866-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). TRIP-1 and apolipoprotein J interact with TβR-II, but their functions in signal transduction of TGF-β remain to be determined. We employed the two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic region of Thick veins (Tkv), one of the type I receptors for Dpp (4Padgett R"

Analysis of heterochromatin of a single telomere was so far lacking, due to the difficulties intrinsic to the highly repetitive nature of telomeric sequences. In LIII, the terminal (C1–3A)n repetitive sequences are followed by a complete X element and by the single copy Ty5-1 retrotransposon. Both the telosome and the X element exhibit overall resistance to micrococcal nuclease digestion reflecting their tight chromatin structure organization. The X element contains protein complexes and irregularly distributed but well localized nucleosomes. In contrast, a regular array of phased nucleosomes is associated with the promoter region of Ty5-1 and with the more centromere-proximal sequences. The lack of a structural component of yeast telomeres, the SIR3 protein, does not alter the overall tight organization of the X element but causes a nucleosome rearrangement within the promoter region of Ty5-1 and releases Ty5-1 silencing. Thus, Sir3p links the modification of the heterochromatin structure with loss of transcriptional silencing.

Telomeres play an essential role in cell biology in stabilizing chromosomes and facilitating complete replication of chromosomal termini. Telomeric DNA usually contains tandem repetitions of a short motif flanked by subtelomeric middle repetitive sequences (1Zakian V. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1989; 23: 579-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). In yeast, telomeric sequences are composed of about 350 base pairs containing the (C1–3A)n repeats and are followed by two main subtelomeric sequences: the Y′ and Xelements (2Louis E. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1553-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Y elements are highly conserved and are found in about 70% of the telomeres (2Louis E. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1553-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 3Walmsley R. Chan C. Tye B. Petes T. Nature. 1984; 310: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 4Chan C. Tye B. J.

X elements are present in all telomeres and can exist in two main forms: a complete form containing the X core and the STR-A,B,C,D (6Louis E. Naumova E. Lee A. Naumov G. Haber J. Genetics. 1994; 136: 789-802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) elements or a short form containing essentially the X core or part of it (2Louis E.

The complete X is found in about 80% of the telomeres, whereas uncomplete forms are found in the remaining 20%.Previous reports have referred to the chromatin structure of yeast telomeres as heterochromatin. This denomination is based on structural and functional similarities that yeast telomeres share withDrosophila heterochromatin (7Laurenson P. Rine J. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 543-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Weiler K. Wakimoto B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 577-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 9Henikoff S. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 422-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the terminal (C1–3A)n repeats are organized into a nuclease-resistant structure called telosome (10Wright J. Gottschling D. Zakian V. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 11Wright J. Zakian V.

Biol. 1988; 8: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and interacts with other proteins including RIF1, RIF2, SIR3, and SIR4 (16Wotton D. Shore D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 748-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 17Moretti P. Freeman K. Coodly L. Shore D.

The proteins SIR3 and SIR4 interact with each other, RAP1, and the amino terminus of the histones H3 and H4. Thus, the building of the telomeric heterochromatic structures in yeast involves complex homotypic and heterotypic interactions.Although the chromatin structure of yeast telomeres is probably the best known among all eukaryotes, its specific organization is still poorly understood. It is known that both Y′ and Xelements contain nucleosomes (10Wright J. Gottschling D. Zakian V. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, their distribution within both elements has not been described previously.A previous report has described that the Ty5-1 retrotransposon, a subtelomeric transcriptional unit located in S. cerevisiaeLIII, undergoes telomeric silencing (19Vega-Palas M. Venditti S. Di Mauro E. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 232-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This retrotransposon is silenced in wild-type strains but is derepressed in a sir3mutant. We describe here the chromatin structure of LIII and its influence on the silencing of Ty5-1. A link between Ty5-1 silencing and a specific Sir3p-dependent heterochromatin structure is established.DISCUSSIONThe URA3 reporter gene and other reporter genes placed immediately adjacent to terminal (C1–3A)n repeats in the absence of subtelomeric sequences are silenced (22Gottschling D. Aparicio O. Billington B. Zakian V. Cell. 1990; 63: 751-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Therefore, the special heterochromatic organization of the X elements is not required for the spreading of transcriptional telomeric silencing.Yeast telomeres repress the expression of adjacent genes (7Laurenson P. Rine J. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 543-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This repression, referred to as telomere position effect, requires the integrity of telomeric proteins like RAP1, SIR2, SIR3, SIR4, and the amino termini of histones H3 and H4 (23Kyrion G. Boakye K. Lustig A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5159-5173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Thompson J. Ling X. Grunstein M. Nature. 1994; 369: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 25Aparicio O. Billington B. Gottschling D. Cell. 1991; 66: 1279-1287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). SIR3 and SIR4 interact among them, with RAP1 and with the amino terminus of the core histones. Thus, they have been proposed to physically connect telosomes and the nucleosomes located in the telomeric regions that undergo silencing (17Moretti P. Freeman K. Coodly L. Shore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2257-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 26Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S. Grunstein M.

A. 1997; 94: 2186-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical data support this notion. SIR3 and SIR4 require RAP1 and the amino termini of histones H3 and H4 to silence telomeric genes (23Kyrion G. Boakye K. Lustig A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5159-5173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Thompson J. Ling X. Grunstein M. Nature. 1994; 369: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 25Aparicio O. Billington B. Gottschling D. Cell. 1991; 66: 1279-1287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). SIR3, SIR4, and RAP1 localize by immunofluorescence to a number of foci near the nuclear periphery, being the amino termini of histones H3 and H4 required for the perinuclear localization of SIR3 and SIR4. The positioning of these foci inside the nuclei is coincident with hybridization signals of subtelomeric repeats (26Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S. Grunstein M. Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 29Gotta M. Laroche T. Formenton A. Maillet L. Shertan H. Gasser S. J.

Cell. 1993; 75: 543-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In addition, SIR3, SIR4, RAP1, and histone proteins coimmunoprecipitate and are found at the same distance from the telomeres (27Hecht A. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Grunstein M. Nature. 1996; 383: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 31Strahl-Bolsinger S. Hecht A. Luo K. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar).We have shown in this report that the lack of Sir3p affects the chromatin structure of the X element and of the adjacent Ty5-1 retrotransposon in LIII. These results provide evidence forin vivo interactions between Sir3p and nucleosomes in the X element and in the Ty5-1 retrotransposon.Ty5-1 has been previously described to be silenced in its natural context in a SIR3 dependent manner (19Vega-Palas M. Venditti S. Di Mauro E. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 232-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The promoter region of the retrotransposon is located at about 1.3 kilobases from the end of LIII. This result is in agreement with previous studies showing that Sir3p can be immunolocalized up to 2–3 kilobases from the right telomere of S. cerevisiae chromosome VI (27Hecht A. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Grunstein M. Nature. 1996; 383: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 31Strahl-Bolsinger S. Hecht A. Luo K. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Since the chromatin structure of the Ty5-1 promoter region is altered in asir3 mutant, Sir3p establishes a link between chromatin remodeling and transcriptional telomeric silencing. The SIR complex could function as a stapler joining nucleosomes from the Xelement and from the Ty5-1 retrotransposon and impair the access of the transcriptional machinery to the Ty5-1 promoter.In wild-type strains, the 5′ region of Ty5-1 shows overall sensitivity to MNase similar to the sensitivity of bulk DNA (data not shown) and contains a normal array of nucleosomes. Thus, this heterochromatic region does not show specific structural features. However, according to previous results (27Hecht A. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Grunstein M. Nature. 1996; 383: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), the 5′ region of Ty5-1 should associate with proteins like SIR2, SIR3, or SIR4. Therefore, these proteins should interact among them and with the amino termini of histones H3 and H4 without affecting the accessibility of MNase to the linker internucleosomal regions. Telomeres play an essential role in cell biology in stabilizing chromosomes and facilitating complete replication of chromosomal termini. Telomeric DNA usually contains tandem repetitions of a short motif flanked by subtelomeric middle repetitive sequences (1Zakian V. Annu. Rev.

SIR3 and SIR4 require RAP1 and the amino termini of histones H3 and H4 to silence telomeric genes (23Kyrion G. Boakye K. Lustig A. Mol. Cell.

SIR3, SIR4, and RAP1 localize by immunofluorescence to a number of foci near the nuclear periphery, being the amino termini of histones H3 and H4 required for the perinuclear localization of SIR3 and SIR4. The positioning of these foci inside the nuclei is coincident with hybridization signals of subtelomeric repeats (26Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S. Grunstein M. Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 29Gotta M. Laroche T. Formenton A. Maillet L. Shertan H. Gasser S. J.

Cell. 1993; 75: 543-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In addition, SIR3, SIR4, RAP1, and histone proteins coimmunoprecipitate and are found at the same distance from the telomeres (27Hecht A. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Grunstein M. Nature. 1996; 383: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 31Strahl-Bolsinger S. Hecht A. Luo K. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar).We have shown in this report that the lack of Sir3p affects the chromatin structure of the X element and of the adjacent Ty5-1 retrotransposon in LIII. These results provide evidence forin vivo interactions between Sir3p and nucleosomes in the X element and in the Ty5-1 retrotransposon.Ty5-1 has been previously described to be silenced in its natural context in a SIR3 dependent manner (19Vega-Palas M. Venditti S. Di Mauro E. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 232-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The promoter region of the retrotransposon is located at about 1.3 kilobases from the end of LIII. This result is in agreement with previous studies showing that Sir3p can be immunolocalized up to 2–3 kilobases from the right telomere of S. cerevisiae chromosome VI (27Hecht A. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Grunstein M. Nature. 1996; 383: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 31Strahl-Bolsinger S. Hecht A. Luo K. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Since the chromatin structure of the Ty5-1 promoter region is altered in asir3 mutant, Sir3p establishes a link between chromatin remodeling and transcriptional telomeric silencing. The SIR complex could function as a stapler joining nucleosomes from the Xelement and from the Ty5-1 retrotransposon and impair the access of the transcriptional machinery to the Ty5-1 promoter.In wild-type strains, the 5′ region of Ty5-1 shows overall sensitivity to MNase similar to the sensitivity of bulk DNA (data not shown) and contains a normal array of nucleosomes. Thus, this heterochromatic region does not show specific structural features. However, according to previous results (27Hecht A. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Grunstein M. Nature. 1996; 383: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), the 5′ region of Ty5-1 should associate with proteins like SIR2, SIR3, or SIR4. Therefore, these proteins should interact among them and with the amino termini of histones H3 and H4 without affecting the accessibility of MNase to the linker internucleosomal regions. The URA3 reporter gene and other reporter genes placed immediately adjacent to terminal (C1–3A)n repeats in the absence of subtelomeric sequences are silenced (22Gottschling D. Aparicio O. Billington B. Zakian V. Cell. 1990; 63: 751-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Therefore, the special heterochromatic organization of the X elements is not required for the spreading of transcriptional telomeric silencing. Yeast telomeres repress the expression of adjacent genes (7Laurenson P. Rine J. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 543-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This repression, referred to as telomere position effect, requires the integrity of telomeric proteins like RAP1, SIR2, SIR3, SIR4, and the amino termini of histones H3 and H4 (23Kyrion G. Boakye K. Lustig A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5159-5173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Thompson J. Ling X. Grunstein M. Nature. 1994; 369: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 25Aparicio O. Billington B. Gottschling D. Cell. 1991; 66: 1279-1287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). SIR3 and SIR4 interact among them, with RAP1 and with the amino terminus of the core histones. Thus, they have been proposed to physically connect telosomes and the nucleosomes located in the telomeric regions that undergo silencing (17Moretti P. Freeman K. Coodly L. Shore D.
