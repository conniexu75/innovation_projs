https://openalex.org/W2048299560,"The ligand for osteoprotegerin has been identified, and it is a TNF-related cytokine that replaces the requirement for stromal cells, vitamin D3, and glucocorticoids in the coculture model of in vitro osteoclastogenesis. OPG ligand (OPGL) binds to a unique hematopoeitic progenitor cell that is committed to the osteoclast lineage and stimulates the rapid induction of genes that typify osteoclast development. OPGL directly activates isolated mature osteoclasts in vitro, and short-term administration into normal adult mice results in osteoclast activation associated with systemic hypercalcemia. These data suggest that OPGL is an osteoclast differentiation and activation factor. The effects of OPGL are blocked in vitro and in vivo by OPG, suggesting that OPGL and OPG are key extracellular regulators of osteoclast development."

We show that cardiac hypertrophy is induced by the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, which dephosphorylates the transcription factor NF-AT3, enabling it to translocate to the nucleus. NF-AT3 interacts with the cardiac zinc finger transcription factor GATA4, resulting in synergistic activation of cardiac transcription. Transgenic mice that express activated forms of calcineurin or NF-AT3 in the heart develop cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure that mimic human heart disease. Pharmacologic inhibition of calcineurin activity blocks hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro. These results define a novel hypertrophic signaling pathway and suggest pharmacologic approaches to prevent cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2087647782,"Macrophage uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is thought to play a central role in foam cell formation and the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We demonstrate here that oxLDL activates PPARgamma-dependent transcription through a novel signaling pathway involving scavenger receptor-mediated particle uptake. Moreover, we identify two of the major oxidized lipid components of oxLDL, 9-HODE and 13-HODE, as endogenous activators and ligands of PPARgamma. Our data suggest that the biologic effects of oxLDL are coordinated by two sets of receptors, one on the cell surface, which binds and internalizes the particle, and one in the nucleus, which is transcriptionally activated by its component lipids. These results suggest that PPARgamma may be a key regulator of foam cell gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1976621212,"The formation of foam cells from macrophages in the arterial wall is characterized by dramatic changes in lipid metabolism, including increased expression of scavenger receptors and the uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). We demonstrate here that the nuclear receptor PPARgamma is induced in human monocytes following exposure to oxLDL and is expressed at high levels in the foam cells of atherosclerotic lesions. Ligand activation of the PPARgamma:RXRalpha heterodimer in myelomonocytic cell lines induces changes characteristic of monocytic differentiation and promotes uptake of oxLDL through transcriptional induction of the scavenger receptor CD36. These results reveal a novel signaling pathway controlling differentiation and lipid metabolism in monocytic cells, and suggest that endogenous PPARgamma ligands may be important regulators of gene expression during atherogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2003123776,"COPII vesicle formation requires only three coat assembly subunits: Sar1p, Sec13/31p, and Sec23/24p. PI 4-phosphate or PI 4,5-bisphosphate is required for the binding of these proteins to liposomes. The GTP-bound form of Sar1p recruits Sec23/24p to the liposomes as well as to the ER membranes, and this Sar1p-Sec23/24p complex is required for the binding of Sec13/31p. Ultrastructural analysis shows that the binding of COPII coat proteins to liposomes results in coated patches, coated buds, and coated vesicles of 50–90 nm in diameter. Budding proceeds without rupture of the donor liposome or vesicle product. These observations suggest that the assembly of the COPII coat on the ER occurs by a sequential binding of coat proteins to specific lipids and that this assembly promotes the budding of COPII-coated vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2032123628,"To investigate the roles of astroglial cells, we targeted their ablation genetically. Transgenic mice were generated expressing herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase from the mouse glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter. In adult transgenic mice, 2 weeks of subcutaneous treatment with the antiviral agent ganciclovir preferentially ablated transgene-expressing, GFAP-positive glia from the jejunum and ileum, causing a fulminating and fatal jejuno-ileitis. This pathology was independent of bacterial overgrowth and was characterized by increased myeloperoxidase activity, moderate degeneration of myenteric neurons, and intraluminal hemorrhage. These findings demonstrate that enteric glia play an essential role in maintaining the integrity of the bowel and suggest that their loss or dysfunction may contribute to the cellular mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease."
https://openalex.org/W2080853555,"Germline mutations in PKD2 cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. We have introduced a mutant exon 1 in tandem with the wild-type exon 1 at the mouse Pkd2 locus. This is an unstable allele that undergoes somatic inactivation by intragenic homologous recombination to produce a true null allele. Mice heterozygous and homozygous for this mutation, as well as Pkd+/- mice, develop polycystic kidney and liver lesions that are indistinguishable from the human phenotype. In all cases, renal cysts arise from renal tubular cells that lose the capacity to produce Pkd2 protein. Somatic loss of Pkd2 expression is both necessary and sufficient for renal cyst formation in ADPKD, suggesting that PKD2 occurs by a cellular recessive mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2128057594,"The physiological role of prion protein (PrP) remains unknown. Mice devoid of PrP develop normally but are resistant to scrapie; introduction of a PrP transgene restores susceptibility to the disease. To identify the regions of PrP necessary for this activity, we prepared PrP knockout mice expressing PrPs with amino-proximal deletions. Surprisingly, PrP lacking residues 32-121 or 32-134, but not with shorter deletions, caused severe ataxia and neuronal death limited to the granular layer of the cerebellum as early as 1-3 months after birth. The defect was completely abolished by introducing one copy of a wild-type PrP gene. We speculate that these truncated PrPs may be nonfunctional and compete with some other molecule with a PrP-like function for a common ligand."

https://openalex.org/W2143764910,"Microtubule disassembly at centrosomes is involved in mitotic spindle function. The microtubule-severing protein katanin, a heterodimer of 60 and 80 kDa subunits, was previously purified and shown to localize to centrosomes in vivo. Here we report the sequences and activities of the katanin subunits. p60 is a new member of the AAA family of ATPases, and we show that expressed p60 has microtubule-stimulated ATPase and microtubule-severing activities in the absence of p80. p80 is a novel protein containing WD40 repeats, which are frequently involved in protein-protein interactions. The p80 WD40 domain does not participate in p60 dimerization, but localizes to centrosomes in transfected mammalian cells. These results indicate katanin's activities are segregated into a subunit (p60) that possesses enzymatic activity and a subunit (p80) that targets the enzyme to the centrosome."
https://openalex.org/W2071686558,"Akt is a serine/threonine kinase that requires a functional phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to be stimulated by insulin and other growth factors. When directed to membranes by the addition of a src myristoylation sequence, Akt becomes constitutively active. In the present study, a conditionally active version of Akt was constructed by fusing the Akt containing the myristoylation sequence to the hormone binding domain of a mutant murine estrogen receptor that selectively binds 4-hydroxytamoxifen. The chimeric protein was expressed in NIH3T3 cells and was shown to be stimulated by hormone treatment 17-fold after only a 20-min treatment. This hormone treatment also stimulated an approximate 3-fold increase in the phosphorylation of the chimeric protein and a shift in its migration on SDS gels. Activation of this conditionally active Akt resulted in the rapid stimulation of the 70-kDa S6 kinase. This conditionally active Akt was also found to rapidly stimulate in these cells the phosphorylation of properties of PHAS-I, a key protein in the regulation of protein synthesis. The conditionally active Akt, when expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, was also stimulated, although its rate and extent of activation was less then in the NIH3T3 cells. Its stimulation was shown to be capable of inducing glucose uptake into adipocytes by stimulating translocation of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane.

The PH domain is a protein module found in many signal transduction proteins that can mediate either protein-lipid or protein-protein interactions (1Haslam R.J. Kolde H.B. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 309-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 2Shaw G. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of Akt is stimulated by a number of different growth factors, including insulin and platelet-derived growth factor (3Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K.

Several studies have shown that Akt stimulation requires prior activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) (3Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), possibly due to a direct interaction of the Akt PH domain with these lipids products (6Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar) or, alternatively, due to the phosphorylation of Akt by a distinct Ser/Thr kinase, which is activated by PI 3-phosphates (7Alessi D. James S. Downes C. Holmes A. Gaffney P. Reese C. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further interest in Akt has been stimulated by the finding that this enzyme can induce a variety of biological responses. In particular, Akt has been proposed to positively regulate the 70-kDa S6 kinase (4Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar) and negatively regulate the GSK-3 kinase (8Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4292) Google Scholar). Moreover, Akt has been shown to be capable of stimulating the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes (9Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Finally, Akt has been shown to stimulate lipogenesis (9Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) and to induce glucose uptake into adipocytes by stimulating GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane (9Kohn A.D.

Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether a particular biological response can be mediated via Akt, the above studies made use of a constitutively active form of Akt in which the enzyme is targeted to membranes via the addition of either the src myristoylation signal or a myristoylated gag sequence (4Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar, 8Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M.

Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Coffer P. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such studies have the problem that the Akt kinase activity is unregulated, and thus the kinase is active as soon as it is expressed in cells. In contrast, the responses one is attempting to mimic, such as stimulation of glucose uptake, are stimulated by insulin within minutes. In addition, such studies require one to utilize different populations of cells to compare a particular response; for example, cells expressing the constitutively active Akt must be compared with control cells. In this report, we describe and characterize a conditionally active form of the Akt molecule. This conditionally active form of Akt was created by fusing the hormone binding domain (HBD) of a mutant murine estrogen receptor (14Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar) to a variant of Akt that lacks its PH domain but contains a src myristoylation signal at its amino terminus (myrAkt Δ4–129) (15Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The Akt construct without the HBD has unregulated constitutive kinase activity (15Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). This mutant HBD of the estrogen receptor, which has also been used to make a conditionally active myc (14Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar), does not bind 17β-estradiol but is responsive to 4-hydroxytamoxifen (14Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). In the present work, we show that the kinase activity of the Akt-estrogen receptor fusion protein (myrAkt Δ4–129-ER) is dependent on 4-hydroxytamoxifen (HT). This conditionally active form of Akt was used to demonstrate that acute activation of Akt was sufficient to stimulate the phosphorylation of PHAS-I (phosphorylated heat- andacid-stable protein) and to induce its dissociation from eIF4E, a key step in the regulation of protein synthesis. To make an estradiol-dependent human Akt protein kinase, the hormone binding domain of a mutant murine estrogen receptor (ER) (a gift from Dr. Martin McMahon) that no longer binds 17β-estradiol but is activated by the synthetic steroid 4-hydroxytamoxifen (14Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar) was first subcloned into the pWZLneo retroviral vector (16Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar), which carries a neomycin resistance gene, using theEcoRI and SalI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. In addition, the polymerase chain reaction was used to modify myrAkt Δ4–129 and A2myrAkt Δ4–129 (15Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) by replacing the stop codon after the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag with an in-frame EcoRI site. The fragment obtained by the polymerase chain reaction was confirmed by sequencing. The Akt constructs were then fused to the estrogen receptor in pWZLneo using the 5′ BamHI and 3′ EcoRI restriction sites, resulting in the formation of myrAkt Δ4–129-ER and A2myrAkt Δ4–129-ER. A p70 S6 kinase clone (a gift from Dr. Gerry Crabtree) was modified to encode a myc epitope-tag at its 5′ end and subcloned into the pWZLneo retroviral vector using standard molecular biological techniques. NIH3T3 fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were infected with either myrAkt Δ4–129-ER or A2myrAkt Δ4–129-ER as described previously (15Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells infected with either myrAkt Δ4–129-ER or A2myrAkt Δ4–129-ER were then infected with the pWZLneo retroviral vector expressing the myc epitope-tagged p70 S6 kinase construct. The cells were infected using the same protocol noted above, except that the cells were not subjected to additional drug selection. The Akt immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (9Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar), except that a single 100-mm plate was used for each treatment, and each plate was lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer. In most experiments, a peptide (sequence GRPRTSSFAEG) assay was utilized to measure Akt kinase activity as described (8Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4292) Google Scholar), except that a 40% SDS-polyacryamide gel was utilized to separate the incorporated label from free ATP. This assay was linear for up to 90 min, and all the values determined were within the linear range for Akt levels. To detect phosphorylation of Ser473, immunoblotting was performed with the phospho-specific Akt antibody from New England BioLabs. The expressed p70 S6 kinase was immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal antibody directed against the myc epitope tag (Babco) that was preadsorbed to protein G-Sepharose. The nonspecific background was measured by incubating lysates with normal mouse immunoglobulin that was also preadsorbed to protein G-Sepharose. The kinase activity was measured as described previously (15Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). 3× Laemmli sample buffer (45 μl) was also added to the remaining beads. The bound protein was eluted by incubating for 4 min at 100 °C, and these samples were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were transferred and immunoblotted using the anti-myc antibody to detect p70 S6 kinase. The PI 3-kinase assay using pure phosphatidylinositol (Sigma) as a substrate was performed as described previously (17Chin J.E. Dickens M. Tavare J.M. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6338-6347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that cells were serum-starved for 16 h before being treated and lysed. The PHAS-I shift and eIF4E dissociation were measured by PHAS-I immunoblotting either whole cell extracts and m7GTP-Sepharose bound material, respectively, as described previously (18Lin T.-A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 270: 653-656Crossref Scopus (598) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 preadipocytes infected with either myrAkt Δ4–129-ER or A2myrAkt Δ4–129-ER were cultured, selected, and differentiated as described previously (9Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). These cell lines were used to measure glucose uptake and to isolate crude membrane fractions for detection of GLUT1 and GLUT4 expression as described previously (9Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane was performed and quantitated as described previously (19Garcia de Herreros A. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19994-19999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fingar D.C. Hausdorff S.F. Blenis J. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3005-3008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Medium was replaced with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 10 mmglucose and [32P]orthophosphate (500 μCi/plate). After 3 h at 37C/5%CO2, NIH3T3 cells expressing myrAkt Δ4–129-ER were treated without or with 1 μm HT for additional 40 min, placed on ice, washed with ice-cold HBS, and lysed with 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 300 nmokadaic acid, 1 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5) bound to Protein-A agarose beads. Beads were washed, and bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. To confirm which band was Akt, the membrane was immunoblotted with anti-HA antibodies. The autoradiographs were scanned, imported into Adobe Photoshop, and quantitated after subtracting a background region of the gel. Several strategies exist to make a conditionally active Akt kinase, the activity of which can be regulated. Tetracycline-regulatable systems have been described in which tetracycline can be added to suppress or induce expression of a given construct (21Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). In addition, one could use drug-induced dimerization systems exploiting synthetic bivalent membrane permeable compounds that bind to drug binding domains fused to intracellular signaling molecules (22Spencer D.M. Wandless T.J. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Finally, conditionally active forms of the transcription factor Myc and the protein kinases Raf1 and Abl have been made by fusing them with the HBD of steroid receptors, particularly the estrogen receptor (23Jackson P. Baltimore D. Picard D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2809-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell.

Although we were unable to create a conditionally active form of Akt using the tetracycline-regulatable or drug-induced dimerization systems (data not shown), we were able to generate such an enzyme by constructing a HBD fusion protein. We have previously described a constitutively active form of Akt (myrAkt Δ4–129) created by attaching the srcmyristoylation signal to the amino terminus of a variant of Akt that lacked its PH domain and carried a HA epitope tag at its carboxyl terminus (15Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). We also described a control construct (A2myrAkt Δ4–129) that was not constitutively active in which the myristoylated glycine at the second amino acid position was converted to alanine to eliminate the membrane-targeting function of thesrc myristoylation signal sequence (15Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). To generate a conditionally active form of Akt, the myristoylated Akt construct and the mutant control lacking the myristoylated glycine were fused in-frame to the HBD of a mutant form of the murine estrogen receptor (myrAkt Δ4–129-ER and A2myrAkt Δ4–129-ER) (Fig.1) that no longer binds 17β-estradiol but is still responsive to the synthetic steroid HT (26Danielian P.S. White R. Hoare S.A. Fawell S.E. Parker M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). These fusion proteins were subcloned into a retroviral vector that carried a neomycin resistance gene (16Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were infected with retroviruses encoding the different forms of Akt, drug-selected, serum-starved for 16 h, and then treated for increasing amounts of time with HT. The Akt fusion protein was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using a monoclonal antibody directed against the HA tag, and the kinase activity was measuredin vitro using a synthetic peptide as substrate (8Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4292) Google Scholar). Exposure of cells to HT for only 20 min caused the kinase activity of myrAkt Δ4–129-ER to increase 17-fold. The kinase activity continued to increase with longer exposures to HT to more than a 50-fold activation (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the kinase activity of myrAkt Δ4–129-ER treated with ethanol alone and the activity of A2myrAkt Δ4–129-ER treated with either ethanol or HT was barely elevated compared with control immunoprecipitates using normal mouse immunoglobulin. The immunoprecipitated protein was also analyzed by immunoblotting using antibody directed against the HA epitope. Treatment of cells with HT did not change the expression level of myrAkt Δ4–129-ER. However, HT treatment was associated with the appearance of a slower migrating band (Fig. 2 B), consistent with an increase in the phosphorylation state of the protein. As shown above, although the levels of the myrAkt Δ4–129-ER protein did not change after HT treatment of cells, the protein did shift to a higher molecular weight on SDS gels (Fig.2 B), consistent with an increase in phosphorylation. To directly test this, metabolically labeled cells expressing myrAkt Δ4–129-ER were treated for 40 min with either HT or ethanol and lysed, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies. An approximate 3-fold increase (range, 1.8–3.4; n = 3) in labeling of the myrAkt Δ4–129-ER was observed with HT treatment (Fig. 2 D). To determine whether the activating site Ser473 was phosphorylated, the immunoprecipitated myrAkt Δ4–129-ER was blotted with a phospho-specific antibody directed against this site. HT treatment greatly stimulated the ability of the phosphospecific antibody to recognize this chimera (Fig. 2 E), demonstrating that HT treatment stimulates an increase in the phosphorylation of Ser473. To determine whether PI 3-kinase had any role in the activation of the conditionally active form of Akt, NIH3T3 cells that had been infected with myrAkt Δ4–129-ER were treated for 20 min with increasing concentrations of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (27Okada T. Kawano Y. Sabakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were then treated for 10 min with HT to induce the Akt kinase activity. The basal PI 3-kinase activity was measured in anti-p85 antibody precipitates prepared from nonstimulated cells to verify the inhibitory effect of wortmannin. MyrAkt Δ4–129-ER was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates prepared from cells that had been treated with HT, and its kinase activity was measured in vitro to determine whether its activation was dependent on PI 3-kinase. At 1 nm wortmannin, a slight increase in Akt activity was observed, similar to a slight increase in Akt activity previously observed with 1 nm wortmannin after insulin treatment (5Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). However, at higher wortmannin concentrations, the activation of myrAkt Δ4–129-ER was inhibited, and this paralleled the inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity (Fig.3). A structurally unrelated inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, LY294002 (28Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was also found to block the activation of myrAkt Δ4–129-ER (data not shown). Prior studies have shown that constitutively active forms of Akt stimulate the enzymatic activity of p70 S6 kinase (4Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar, 15Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In these reports, the constitutively active Akt was unregulated, so its kinase activity was chronically elevated, raising the possibility that p70 S6 kinase was stimulated not because of a phosphorylation cascade initiated by Akt but rather because of other cellular events arising secondary to long-term expression of a constitutively active kinase. The conditionally active Akt allowed us to resolve this question. NIH3T3 cells already expressing either myrAkt Δ4–129-ER or A2myrAkt Δ4–129-ER were subsequently infected with a myc-epitope-tagged p70 S6 kinase that had also been subcloned into a retroviral vector. The cells were serum-starved for 16 h and then treated for 10 min with HT or with ethanol, the control vehicle. The p70 S6 kinase was immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal antibody directed against the myc epitope tag, and its kinase activity was measured in vitrousing the 40S ribosomal subunit as a substrate. Induction of Akt kinase activity by treating cells that co-expressed myrAkt Δ4–129-ER with HT was associated with a 3- and 7-fold increase in p70 S6 kinase activity after a 10- and 60-min stimulation, respectively (Fig.4). In contrast, treating cells that co-expressed A2myrAkt Δ4–129-ER with HT did not cause an increase in p70 S6 kinase activity compared with control-treated cells (Fig. 4). The stimulation of p70 S6 kinase after 60 min with HT in cells coexpressing myrAkt Δ4–129-ER chimera was comparable to the stimulation achieved using 2 nm platelet-derived growth factor (Fig. 4). The increased activity of p70 S6 kinase observed in the context of the induced myrAkt Δ4–129-ER was also associated with the appearance of hyperphosphorylated forms of p70 S6 kinase (data not shown), consistent with prior studies of this enzyme (29Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 255-260PubMed Google Scholar, 30Chou M.M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The unregulated constitutively active Akt has previously been shown to stimulate glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and induce the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (9Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 13Tanti J.F. Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Coffer P. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the conditionally active Akt could also stimulate this response, we infected 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with either myrAkt Δ4–129-ER or A2myrAkt Δ4–129-ER. The kinase activity of the Akt fusion proteins was measured in immunoprecipitates prepared from differentiated adipocytes that had been treated with either HT or ethanol, the control vehicle, for different periods of time by utilizing a peptide as exogenous substrate (8Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4292) Google Scholar). This assay showed no activation of Akt in the adipocytes after a 1-h stimulation, but after 6 h, there was a 20-fold stimulation (Fig.2 C), and the activity remained elevated after 16 h. In contrast, the A2myrAkt Δ4–129-ER construct was not significantly stimulated at any of the times tested, and the myrAkt Δ4–129-ER was not activated in the absence of HT (Fig. 2 C). The slower rate of activation of myrAkt Δ4–129-ER with HT in the adipocytes could be due to the lower level of expression of these constructs in the adipocytes in comparison to the NIH3T3 cells or for some other unknown reason. To measure the enzymatic activity of the expressed myrAkt Δ4–129-ER in comparison to the endogenous Akt, 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing myrAkt Δ4–129-ER were stimulated with HT for 16 h or 10 min with 100 nm insulin and lysed, and the expressed Akt and endogenous Akt were immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody and an antibody to the PH domain of Akt, respectively. The immunoprecipitates were tested for kinase activity in vitro using the peptide as substrate (8Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4292) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated endogenous Akt had approximately 5 times as much activity as the expressed myrAkt Δ4–129-ER. We next evaluated the ability of this conditionally active Akt to regulate glucose transport. The uptake of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose was measured in differentiated adipocytes expressing either myrAkt Δ4–129-ER or A2myrAkt Δ4–129-ER that had been treated for various periods of time with HT. Exposure of cells expressing myrAkt Δ4–129-ER to HT for 1 h or less did not result in any significant change in glucose uptake (Fig.5 A), consistent with the low activation of Akt enzymatic activity at these times in adipocytes (Fig.2 C). In contrast, the 16-h stimulation was associated with a 2.5–3-fold increase in 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake compared with both control-treated cells and cells expressing A2myrAkt Δ4–129-ER that were control-treated or treated with HT (Fig. 5A). Incubations of cells expressing A2myrAkt Δ4–129-ER with HT for shorter periods of time (2–6 h) gave a partial stimulation of glucose uptake. This increase in glucose uptake was not associated with a change in the level of expression of GLUT4, as determined by immunoblotting crude total membrane fractions (Fig. 5 A, inset). To assess whether activation of this conditionally active Akt could stimulate GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane, the sheet assay was utilized (19Garcia de Herreros A. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19994-19999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fingar D.C. Hausdorff S.F. Blenis J. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3005-3008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells expressing either myrAkt Δ4–129-ER or A2myrAkt Δ4–129-ER were treated or not for various periods of time with HT and sonicated, and the amount of plasma membrane GLUT4 was measured. Exposure of cells expressing myrAkt Δ4–129-ER to HT for 2 h or less did not result in any significant change in surface GLUT4 (Fig. 5 B), consistent with the low activation of Akt enzymatic activity at these times in adipocytes (Fig. 2 C). After 16 h, HT stimulated a 3-fold increase in the amount of surface GLUT4 in the cells expressing myrAkt Δ4–129-ER but not those expressing A2myrAkt Δ4–129-ER (Fig. 5 B). After a 6-h stimulation, a smaller increase in surface GLUT4 was also observed in the cells expressing myrAkt Δ4–129-ER. Insulin stimulated GLUT4 translocation approximately 7–8-fold in both cell types (Fig.5 B, inset). Thus, the conditionally active Akt could regulate 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In addition to regulating glucose uptake, insulin stimulates protein synthesis in a variety of cell types (31Lawrence J.C. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The constitutively active Akt, myrAkt, was found to activate protein synthesis to a level comparable to insulin stimulation. 2A. D. Kohn and R. A. Roth, unpublished observations. One mechanism whereby insulin has been found to regulate protein synthesis is via the phosphorylation of the eIF4E-binding protein, PHAS-I (31Lawrence J.C. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The nonphosphorylated form of PHAS-I inhibits protein synthesis by tightly binding to the mRNA cap-binding protein, eIF4E. When PHAS-I is phosphorylated on the appropriate sites, it releases eIF4E, which is then free to participate in translation initiation (31Lawrence J.C. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of PHAS-I has been shown to be controlled by a rapamycin-sensitive pathway involving the mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR (31Lawrence J.C. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that PI 3-kinase is an upstream element in this pathway, but the role of Akt in the control of PHAS-I phosphorylation is not known. Experiments were therefore performed to investigate the effect of the conditionally active Akt on the phosphorylation of PHAS-I and its association with eIF4E. NIH3T3 cells expressing myrAkt D4–129-ER (MER-3T3) or control cells were treated with 1 μm HT and lysed, and the lysates were either analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting for PHAS-I or first incubated with m7GTP-Sepharose to determine the amount of PHAS-I complexed with eIF4E. Phosphorylation of PHAS-I has been shown to markedly decrease its electrophoretic mobility in SDS gels (18Lin T.-A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 270: 653-656Crossref Scopus (598) Google Scholar). By gel shift analysis, HT treatment of MER-Akt-expressing cells was found to rapidly stimulate PHAS-I phosphorylation to an extent comparable to insulin (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, HT was without effect in the control cells (Fig. 6 A), whereas insulin stimulated the shift of PHAS-I in both cell types. In addition, tamoxifen stimulated a dissociation of PHAS-I from eIF4E in the MER-Akt cells but not in the control cells, as detected by a decrease in the amount of the PHAS-I/eIF4E complex bound to the m7GTP-Sepharose (Fig. 6). The results presented here demonstrate that fusion of the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor to an activated form of Akt renders the kinase activity of this protein dependent on the addition of exogenous HT. Using HT, the kinase activity can be rapidly turned on in several cell types, including NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2 A), a mouse hepatoma cell line, and primary myoblasts. 3Andreas Barthel and R. A. Roth, unpublished observations. The induction of Akt kinase activity correlates with the phosphorylation of this protein, including at a key regulatory site, Ser473 (Fig.2, B, D, and E), consistent with the hypothesis that phosphorylation regulates the enzymatic activity of this chimera as it does the the wild type enzyme (32Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar). The rapid activation of the chimera with HT treatment is consistent with the previously described model, in which hormone binding stimulates the release of the 90-kDa heat shock protein from the HBD, thereby allowing access of other proteins (e.g. a kinase) to the chimeric molecule (33Scherrer L. Picard D. Massa E. Harmon J. Simons S.J. Yamamoto K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5381-5386Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). An alternative model would be that the HBD could induce oligomerization of the chimera, and this oligomerization could be sufficient to result in transphosphorylation and activation of Akt. This did not appear to be the case because A2myrAkt Δ4–129-ER, which only lacks the glycine that is myristoylated, was not activated. Thus, the Akt chimera must be present in a membrane compartment to be activated. Presumably, this is due to the presence of a kinase in the membrane that is responsible for phosphorylating Akt. This kinase could be the recently described Akt kinase kinase, which is stimulated by PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate and PI 3,4-bisphosphate (7Alessi D. James S. Downes C. Holmes A. Gaffney P. Reese C. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, a distinct membrane kinase could also be involved. In this regard, it is intriguing that wortmannin and LY294002, inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, could block the activation of myrAkt Δ4–129-ER by HT (Fig. 3 and data not shown). The latter has recently been shown to also cause a deactivation of the constitutively active Akt (34Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31515-31524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). This inhibition could be caused by these drugs directly inhibiting the kinase that is responsible for phosphorylating Akt (possibly the PI 3-kinase itself) or, more likely, by the ability of these drugs to lower the basal levels of PI 3-phosphates in the cells and thereby decrease the basal activity of a kinase sensitive to these compounds. The slower rate of activation of myrAkt Δ4–129-ER in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in comparison to the NIH3T3 cells could be due to a lower level of the membrane kinase responsible for phosphorylating and activating Akt and/or a lower basal level of the necessary PI 3-phosphates. Alternatively, it may be due to the lower levels of expression of the Akt chimera in these cells or for some other reason. The generation of a conditionally active Akt allowed us to investigate downstream targets of this enzyme. Prior studies have shown that expression of different constitutively active forms of Akt induce various subsequent biological responses, including stimulation of the p70 S6-kinase and glucose uptake (4Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar, 8Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M.

Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Coffer P. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we could show activation of the p70 S6-kinase activity in NIH3T3 cells expressing myrAkt Δ4–129-ER after only a 10-min stimulation with HT (Fig. 4), a time very close to that required for induction of Akt enzymatic activity in these cells (Fig. 2 A). These results indicate that the activation of the 70-kDa S6 kinase by Akt is an immediate consequence of stimulation of Akt kinase activity, rather than an event secondary to long-term expression of a constitutively active kinase. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the activation of myrAkt Δ4–129-ER was considerably slower than in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2 C), and the maximal amount of activity was less. A detectable increase in glucose uptake was observed after 4- and 6-h incubations with HT. After 16 h, glucose uptake was stimulated approximately ¼ as well as a maximal dose of insulin. The extent of stimulation of glucose uptake after HT treatment corresponded with the extent of GLUT4 translocation and the relative amounts of Akt stimulated by HT in comparison to insulin. That is, the amount of Akt kinase activity and glucose uptake observed with a 16-h HT stimulation of cells expressing myrAkt Δ4–129-ER was approximately ¼ the maximal amount of glucose uptake and endogenous Akt kinase activity observed in insulin-treated cells. It is possible that the longer period of time required to maximally stimulate Akt activity and glucose uptake in these cells allowed other processes to occur in addition to Akt activation, raising the question of whether Akt activation alone is sufficient for stimulation of glucose uptake. For example, it was possible that Akt activation stimulates the release of a secreted molecule that feeds back to activate glucose uptake. However, the supernatants of these cells were incapable of stimulating glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes,3 indicating that this increase in glucose uptake was at least not due to the release of a secreted factor. Recent additional evidence of a role for Akt in mediating the insulin-induced increase in glucose uptake has come from studies showing that expression of an inactive Akt can hinder the ability of insulin to stimulate GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes (35Cong L.N. Chen H. Li Y. Zhou L. McGibbon M.A. Taylor S.I. Quon M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we also utilized the conditionally active Akt to determine whether this enzyme can modulate the phosphorylation of PHAS-I, a key regulator of protein synthesis, as well as its association with eIF4E (31Lawrence J.C. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). A constitutively active Akt, myrAkt, can increase protein synthesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes to the same extent as insulin2 and stimulate an increase in leptin production in these cells (36Barthel A. Kohn A.D. Luo Y. Roth R.A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3877-3888Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). One mechanism by which insulin and other growth factors regulate protein synthesis is a stimulation in phosphorylation of PHAS-I and its subsequent release from eIF4E (31Lawrence J.C. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Prior studies have demonstrated that insulin stimulates a phosphorylation of PHAS-I and its subsequent release from eIF4E, thereby increasing the amount of eIF4E available to participate in translation of capped mRNAs (31Lawrence J.C. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed that activation of the conditionally active Akt caused a shift of the PHAS-I protein within 10 min of stimulation (Fig. 6). This phosphorylation was associated with a release of PHAS-I from eIF4E. Thus, acute activation of Akt was sufficient to mimic the ability of insulin to stimulate PHAS-I phosphorylation and release of eIF4E, indicating that Akt is upstream of the kinase(s) responsible for phosphorylation of PHAS-I. In summary, the present study provides further evidence that Akt can directly regulate activation of the 70-kDa S6 kinase and glucose uptake. In addition, we provide the first evidence that activation of Akt can regulate the phosphorylation of PHAS-I, as well as its association with eIF4E, providing a potential mechanism whereby insulin may regulate protein synthesis.

A bent α helix in N recognizes primarily the shape and negatively charged surface of the boxB hairpin through multiple hydrophobic and ionic interactions. The GAAGA boxB loop forms a GNRA fold, previously described for tetraloops, which is essential for N binding. The fourth nucleotide of the loop extrudes from the GNRA fold to enable the E. coli elongation factor NusA to recognize the N protein/RNA complex.

https://openalex.org/W2322489293,"Numerous studies have indicated that inactivation of p53 is one of the essential requirements for the unrestrained growth of tumoral cells. When the status of the p53 gene was examined in various types of lymphoid malignancies, mutations in p53 have been predominantly detected in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells, therefore suggesting that alteration of p53 could specifically contribute to the malignant phenotype of these tumoral cells. In addition to mutations, functional inactivation of p53 can also occur through interaction of the wild-type gene product with various viral or cellular proteins. The cellular MDM2 protein, for example, is able to inhibit p53 tumor suppressor function by concealing its transactivation domain. Mdm2 gene amplification has been described in several types of sarcomas, resulting in overexpression of the MDM2 protein. In this study, we have examined the status of MDM2 and p53 in 20 BL cell lines. Four were found to contain wild-type p53 and to overexpress MDM2 protein. Within these BL cells, both molecules are physically associated since they can be co-precipitated and p53 is inactivated as cells neither arrest in G1 nor enter apoptosis following γ-radiation. We also report that the high level of the MDM2 protein in BL cells is neither associated with an amplification of the mdm2 gene nor with an elevated level of RNA or an increased protein stability, but is rather due to an enhanced translation ability of the mdm2 RNA. These results indicate that in certain BL cells, overexpression of MDM2 protein regulated at the posttranscriptional level, induces an escape from p53-controlled cell growth."

https://openalex.org/W1991418321,"Disabled-2 (Dab2), a mammalian structural homolog of Drosophila Disabled (Dab), is a mitogen-responsive phosphoprotein. It has been speculated to be a negative regulator of growth since its expression is lost in ovarian carcinomas. Dab2 contains a C-terminal proline-rich domain with sequences similar to those found in Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras. The proline-rich sequences of Sos mediate the interaction of Sos with Grb2, an adaptor protein which coupled tyrosine kinase receptors to Sos. Herein, we have investigated the possibility that Dab2 interacts with Grb2. In experiments of co-immunoprecipitation from BAC1.2F5 macrophage cell lysates, significant quantities of Grb2 were associated with both Sos and Dab2, although Dab2 and Sos were not present in the same complex. Transfection of Dab2 into a Dab2-negative cell line (293 cells) decreased the amount of Grb2 associated with Sos, suggesting that Dab2 competes with Sos for binding to Grb2. Proline-rich peptides corresponding to Dab2 (#661-669) and to Sos (#1146-1161) inhibited the binding of Dab2 to Grb2, but were less effective in disrupting the Grb2-Sos complex. The expressed proline-rich domain of Dab2 (#600-730) bound Grb2, but other regions of Dab2 failed to bind Grb2. Both of the individual SH3 domains of Grb2 bound to Sos (N-terminal SH3 domain >> C-terminal SH3 domain), but binding to Dab2 required the intact Grb2, suggesting cooperative binding using both SH3 domains of Grb2. These data indicate that Dab2 binds to the SH3 domains of Grb2 via its C-terminal proline-rich sequences. Dab2 may modulate growth factor/Ras pathways by competing with Sos for binding to Grb2."

This leads to caspase-3 activation, phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, and GSH depletion. Since mitochondrial ROI levels are regulated by the supply of NADPH from the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), the effect of transaldolase (TAL), a key enzyme of PPP, was investigated. Jurkat and H9 human CD4+ T cells were transfected with TAL expression vectors oriented in the sense or antisense direction. TAL overexpression down-regulated glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities and GSH levels. Alternatively, decreased TAL expression up-regulated glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities and GSH levels. HIV-induced 1) mitochondrial ROI production, 2) caspase-3 activation, 3) proteolysis of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and 4) PS externalization were accelerated in cells overexpressing TAL. In contrast, suppression of TAL abrogated these four activities. Thus, susceptibility to HIV-induced apoptosis can be regulated by TAL through controlling the balance between mitochondrial ROI production and the metabolic supply of reducing equivalents by the PPP. The dominant effect of TAL expression on oxidative stress, caspase activation, PS externalization, and cell death suggests that this balance plays a pivotal role in HIV-induced apoptosis.

Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.E. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6714) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that increased apoptosis may underlie the etiology of depletion of lymphocytes, primarily of the CD4+ T cell subset, during infection by HIV-1 (2Meyaard L. Otto S.A. Jonker R.R. Mijnster M.J. Keet R.P.M. Miedema F. Science. 1992; 257: 217-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Various mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive have been proposed to trigger the decline of CD4+ T cells. While HIV infection was previously associated with decreased GSH levels (3Buhl R. Holroyd K.J. Mastrangeli A. Cantin A.M. Jaffe H.A. Wells F.B. Saltini C. Crystal R.G. Lancet. 1989; II: 1294-1298Abstract Scopus (589) Google Scholar), involvement of ROI production in diminishing intracellular GSH has not been directly addressed. Decline of GSH levels in HIV-infected cells was associated with cysteine deficiency, which served as a rationale for treatment with N-acetylcysteine (4Droge W. Eck H. Mihm S. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 211-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). More recently, decreased GSH was correlated with increased levels of GSSG in HIV-infected CD4+ T cells, suggesting that a lack of reducing equivalents rather than decreased GSSG synthesis is responsible for GSH deficiency (5Aukrust P.

These data may explain the failure of N-acetylcysteine treatment to increase GSH in lymphocytes of patients with AIDS (7Witschi A. Junker E. Schranz C. Speck R.F. Lautenburg B.H. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1995; 11: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Signaling through the APO-1/Fas/CD95 antigen (8Westendorp M.O. Frank R. Ochsenbauer C. Stricker K. Dhein J. Walczak H.

Activation of interleukin-1β-converting enzyme and related cysteine proteases results in the proteolysis of several cellular substrates, which in turn leads to the characteristic morphologic and biochemical changes of apoptosis (16Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). However, HIV-induced PCD was found to be decreased by cysteine protease/caspase inhibitors but not by Fas/CD95/TNF receptor-1 antagonists (18Glynn J.M. McElligott M.L. Mosier D.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2754-2758PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ohnimus H. Heinkelein M. Jassoy C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5246-5252PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the apoptotic protease cascade is dependent on cytochrome c, which is normally present exclusively in mitochondria (20Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M.

Thus, changes in mitochondrial membrane integrity leading to cytochrome c release appear to be the point of no return in the effector phase of PCD (20Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6199) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial membrane permeability is subject to regulation by an oxidation-reduction equilibrium of ROIs, pyridine nucleotides (NADH/NAD plus NADPH/NADP), and GSH levels (28Constantini P.

ROIs have long been considered as toxic by-products of aerobic existence; however, evidence is now accumulating that controlled levels of ROIs modulate various aspects of cellular function and are necessary for signal transduction pathways, including those mediating apoptosis (33Lipton S.A.

Because apoptosis and bcl-2 protection were demonstrated in very low oxygen pressure, ROI may not be absolutely required for PCD (40Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C. Nature. 1995; 374: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). A cell may normally generate 1011ROI molecules/day (41Ames B.N. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1989; 7: 121Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). ROI production during apoptosis may be controllable by increased synthesis of reducing equivalents (42Sarafian T.A. Bredesen D.E. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1994; 21: 1-8Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar). A normal reducing atmosphere, required for cellular integrity, is maintained by GSH, which protects the cell from damage by excess ROIs (43Mayes P. Murray R. Granner D. Mayes P. Rodwell V. Harper's Biochemistry. Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, CT1993: 201-211Google Scholar). Synthesis of GSH from its oxidized form, GSSG, depends on NADPH produced by the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (43Mayes P. Murray R. Granner D. Mayes P. Rodwell V. Harper's Biochemistry. Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, CT1993: 201-211Google Scholar). In fact, a fundamental function of PPP is to maintain glutathione in a reduced state, thereby protecting sulfhydryl groups and cellular integrity from emerging oxygen radicals. The PPP has been recognized as playing a significant role in many developmental and disease processes, including embryogenesis (44Stark K.L. Harris C. Juchau M.R. Biochem.

Phys. 1992; 22: 671-675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). All of the foregoing processes are associated with PCD (55Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6180) Google Scholar). The PPP comprises two separate, oxidative and nonoxidative, phases. Reactions in the oxidative phase are irreversible, whereas all reactions of the nonoxidative phase are fully reversible. The two phases are functionally connected. The nonoxidative phase converts ribose 5-phosphate to glucose 6-phosphate for utilization by the oxidative phase and thus, indirectly, contributes to generation of NADPH. Different enzymes are rate-limiting in the two phases. The oxidative phase primarily depends on glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) (56Wood T. The Pentose Phosphate Pathway. Academic Press, Inc., New York1985Google Scholar), whereas transaldolase (TAL) is the rate-limiting enzyme for the nonoxidative phase (57Heinrich P.C. Morris H.P. Weber G. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 3189-3197PubMed Google Scholar). TAL catalyzes the transfer of a 3-carbon fragment (corresponding to dihydroxyacetone) tod-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, d-erythrose 4-phosphate, and a variety of other acceptor aldehydes (58Banki K. Halladay D. Perl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2847-2851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TAL expression and enzymatic activity is regulated in a tissue-specific (57Heinrich P.C.

Hothersall J.S. McLean P. Greenbaum A.L. Dev. Med. Child Neurol. 1977; 19: 81-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). TAL overexpression lowers G6PD and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activities and NADPH and GSH levels and renders the cell highly susceptible to apoptosis induced by serum deprivation, hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide, TNFα, and anti-Fas monoclonal antibody. When TAL levels are reduced, G6PD and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activities and GSH levels are increased and apoptosis is inhibited. TAL activity profoundly impacts the balance between the two branches of PPP and the ultimate output of NADPH and GSH (24Banki K. Hutter E. Colombo E. Gonchoroff N.J. Perl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32994-33001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with a dominant role for TAL within the metabolic network that controls the propagation of biochemical signals (61Ni T.-C. Savageau M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7927-7941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This is particularly important because depletion of CD4+ T cells, immunosuppression, and disease development in HIV-infected patients are associated with wasting (62Coodley G.O. Loveless M.O. Merrill T.M. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1994; 7: 681-694PubMed Google Scholar, 63Sharpstone D.R. Murray C.P. Ross H.M. Hancock M.R. Phelan M.S. Crane R.C. Menzies I.S. Reaveley D.A. Lepri A.C.

The present study provides evidence that levels of TAL expression can determine the extent of increased mitochondrial ROI production and subsequent caspase activation, PS externalization, and cell death during HIV infection. Overexpression of TAL accelerated HIV-induced oxidative stress, protease activation, PS externalization, and cell death in two human CD4+ T cell lines. In contrast, suppression of TAL activity abrogated these effects and blocked HIV-induced PCD. The results show that increased mitochondrial ROI production is a defining step in HIV-induced apoptosis and identify TAL as a possible target in the development of new therapeutics against HIV disease. TAL cDNA clone 4/2–4/1 (58Banki K. Halladay D. Perl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2847-2851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted into theHpaI site of the metallothionein promoter-driven pMAXRHneo-1 vector (66Banki K. Ablonczy E. Nakamura M. Perl A. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) following removal of the coding sequence of the p40tax protein of HTLV-I by cleavage withHpaI. Clones containing the TAL cDNA in the sense (pL26–3) and antisense orientation (pL18–3) were selected. 20 μg of plasmid DNA linearized with KpnI were used to stably transfect Jurkat cells by electroporation as described (66Banki K. Ablonczy E. Nakamura M. Perl A. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were grown in the presence of G418 (750 μg/ml for Jurkat and 1 mg/ml for H9 cells) and cloned by limiting dilution. Levels of transaldolase expression were measured by enzyme assay and Western blot analyses in the absence and presence of 5 μmCdCl2. Jurkat cell lines, producing increased (L26–3/1 and L26–3/2D1) and suppressed levels of transaldolase (L18–3/1 and L18–3/1D9), were earlier described (24Banki K. Hutter E. Colombo E. Gonchoroff N.J. Perl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32994-33001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In comparison with control H9 cells and in the absence of CdCl2, L26/1D3 and L26/3H6 cells displayed higher transaldolase levels, whereas transaldolase activity was decreased by in L18–3/B and L18–3/4C4 cells based on four independent enzyme activity measurements (Table I). Transfection of the pMAXRHneo-1 vector alone had no effect on TAL activity (not shown). While overexpression and suppression were doubled by incubating the cells with 5 μm CdCl2, CdCl2was not utilized in the following experiments to preclude possible interference with apoptotic pathways (34Halliwell B.

Anti-Fas monoclonal IgG1 antibody ZB4 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and utilized to inhibit IgM Fas antibody-induced apoptosis. An anti-human TNF receptor (p80) monoclonal antibody, IgG2b was obtained from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Apoptosis was monitored by observing cell shrinkage and nuclear fragmentation and quantified by trypan blue exclusion (69Trauth B.C. Klas C. Peters A.M.J. Matzku S. Moller P. Falk W. Debatin K. Krammer P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). DNA fragmentation during apoptosis was monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis (24Banki K. Hutter E. Colombo E. Gonchoroff N.J. Perl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32994-33001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was also measured by flow cytometry after concurrent staining with fluorescein-conjugated annexin V (annexin V-FITC; R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) (FL1) and propidium iodide (FL2) as earlier described (70Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar, 71Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. McGahon A.J.

Staining with phycoerythrin-conjugated annexin V (annexin V-PE; R & D Systems) was used to monitor PS externalization (FL2) in parallel with measurement of ROI levels by dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR) fluorescence (FL1; see below). Staining with annexin V alone or in combination with DHR was carried out in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mmNaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2. The production of ROIs was estimated fluorometrically using oxidation-sensitive fluorescent probes 5,6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA) and DHR (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as earlier described (24Banki K.

Following apoptosis assay, cells were washed three times in 5 mm Hepes-buffered saline, pH 7.4, incubated in Hepes-buffered saline with 0.1 μm DCFH-DA or DHR for 2 min, and samples were analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACStar Plus flow cytometer equipped with an argon ion laser delivering 200 megawatts of power at 488 nm. Fluorescence emission from 5,6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF; green) or DHR (green) was detected at a wavelength of 530 ± 30 nm. Dead cells and debris were excluded from the analysis by electronic gating of forward and side scatter measurements. ROI levels as determined by fluorescence of control cells served as a base line for assessment of increased ROI levels in response to HIV infection or Fas stimulation. While R123, the fluorescent product of DHR oxidation, binds selectively to the inner mitochondrial membrane, DCF, the fluorescent product of DCFH oxidation, remains in the cytosol of living cells (73Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). In agreement with earlier data (24Banki K. Hutter E. Colombo E. Gonchoroff N.J. Perl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32994-33001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), DHR was significantly more sensitive than DCFH in detecting early increases in ROI levels in response to Fas stimulation. Upon infection by HIV-1, DHR fluorescence was enhanced significantly more than DCF fluorescence. Selective increase of DHR fluorescence indicated that increased mitochondrial ROI production occurred with maintenance of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and membrane integrity (73Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). DHR fluorescence decreased in annexin V-positive cells with diminished size possibly reflecting a decline of negative internal mitochondrial membrane potential and leakage of ROI at later stages of the apoptotic process. Mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm) was also estimated by staining with 40-nm 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6, Molecular Probes), a cationic lipophilic dye (25Xiang J. Chao D.T.

Fluorescence of DiOC6 is oxidation-independent and correlates with mitochondrial transmembrane potential (75Tanner M.K. Wellhausen S.R. Klein J.B. Cytometry. 1993; 14: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Co-treatment with a protonophore, 5 μm carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone (Sigma), for 15 min at 37 °C resulted in decreased DHR and DiOC6 fluorescence and served as a positive control for disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (75Tanner M.K.

This paper describes the cDNA cloning, characterization of the primary protein structure deduced from the cDNA, and gene expression of this enzyme in various human tissues. We obtained an entire 1517-base pair sequence of cDNA with an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide with 418-amino acid residues. The polypeptide consisted of a 232-residue catalytic region and a 186-residue noncatalytic region with a hydrophobic putative transmembrane domain near the NH2 terminus. The polypeptide was suggested to be a type II integral membrane protein in which the COOH-terminal catalytic region is extracellular. Therefore, this protein is thought to be synthesized as a membrane-bound precursor and to mature to a soluble and active protease by limited proteolysis. It showed 29–38% identity in the sequence of the catalytic region with human hepsin, enteropeptidase, acrosin, and mast cell tryptase. The noncatalytic region had little similarity to other known proteins. In Northern blot analysis a transcript of 1.9 kilobases was detectable most prominently in the trachea among 17 human tissues examined.

Many previous investigations have indicated that proteases released from immunoinflammatory cells participate in pathogenesis of several kinds of respiratory diseases. For instance, neutrophil elastase has been shown to be intimately related to the pathologic states of pulmonary emphysema (1Cohen A.B. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1983; 127: 2-58PubMed Google Scholar, 2Janoff A. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1985; 132: 417-433PubMed Google Scholar), cystic fibrosis (3Suter S. Chevallier I. Eur. Respir.

Med. 1981; 304: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) through destruction of extracellular matrix components, such as elastin, of alveolar and bronchial tissues. Mast cells, which abound in airway mucosa and in alveolar wall, release trypsin-like protease (tryptase) and chymotrypsin-like protease (chymase) into extracellular spaces during degranulation (7Schwartz L.B. Irani A.M. Roller K. Castells M.C. Schechter N.M. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 2611-2615PubMed Google Scholar). The tryptase has potential to stimulate smooth muscle, fibroblast, and tissue turnover (8Caughey G.H. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 150: 138-142Crossref Google Scholar). Different substrates for chymase (9Gervasoni Jr., J.E. Conrad D.H. Hugli T.E. Schwartz L.B. Ruddy S. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 285-292PubMed Google Scholar, 10Pejler G. Karlström A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18134-18140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicate the potential involvement of the enzyme in a variety of processes related to the inflammatory response. Recently it was revealed that chymase from human mast cells selectively converted big endothelins to trachea-constricting peptides (12Nakano A. Kishi F. Minami K. Wakabayashi H. Nakaya Y. Kido H. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1987-1992PubMed Google Scholar). These effects of the two mast cell proteases have attracted considerable attention as one of the pathogenic determinants and the therapeutic targets of bronchial asthma and allergic inflammation. Elastase released from alveolar macrophages has also been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of pulmonary emphysema by degrading matrix components of alveolar walls (13Janoff A. J. Appl. Physiol. 1983; 55: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Sibille Y. Reynolds H.Y. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1990; 141: 471-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). However, there are very few reports dealing with the functions and roles of proteases secreted from respiratory tissues, such as secretory glands or surface epithelial cells of the airway. Kido and co-workers (15Kido H. Yokogoshi Y. Sakai K. Tashiro M. Kishino Y. Fukutomi A. Katunuma N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13573-13579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sakai K. Kawaguchi Y. Kishino Y. Kido H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) found a novel trypsin-like protease that is secreted from rat Clara cells, secretory cells localized to the distal airway only. The protease, named tryptase Clara, was shown to enhance the infectivity of influenza and Sendai viruses (17Tashiro M. Yokogoshi Y. Tobita K. Seto J.T. Rott R. Kido H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7211-7216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although its physiological role is unknown. Previously, we found trypsin-like activity in the sputum of patients with chronic airway diseases and isolated a novel trypsin-like protease from the sputum, designated human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT) 1The abbreviations used are: HAT, human airway trypsin-like protease; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase or kilobase pair. (18Yasuoka S. Ohnishi T. Kawano S. Tsuchihashi S. Ogawara M. Masuda K. Yamaoka K. Takahashi M. Sano T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Gel filtration studies showed that HAT was a monomeric enzyme with an apparent molecular mass of 27 kDa. Immunohistochemical studies showed that HAT was localized mainly in cells of submucosal serous glands of the bronchi and trachea. These results indicate that HAT is released from the submucosal serous glands onto mucous membrane, at least in patients with chronic airway diseases. In this paper, we report the cloning of HAT cDNA, the primary structure of this enzyme and characterization of the polypeptide deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA, and results of analysis of expression of HAT mRNA in various human tissues. The primary structure of HAT was compared with that of other known serine proteases. Human trachea QUICK-CloneTM cDNA, human trachea poly(A)+ RNA, human trachea λgt10 cDNA library (oligo(dT) and random-primed), 5′-RACE kit, human multiple tissue Northern blots, and human β-actin cDNA were purchased fromCLONTECH Laboratories Inc. (Palo Alto, CA).Taq DNA polymerase was from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). SureCloneTM ligation kit, dNTP, and plasmid vector pUC18 were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and RNase inhibitor were from Boehringer Mannheim. Restriction endonucleases, random primer labeling kit, andEscherichia coli JM109 were from Takara Shuzo Co. Ltd. (Otsu, Japan). Nylon membrane HybondTM-N+ for blotting and [α-32P]dCTP for probe labeling in hybridization were from Amersham. Denhardt's solution and salmon sperm DNA were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Qiagen lambda kit for purification of phage DNA was from Qiagen GmbH. (Hilden, Germany). Oligonucleotide purification cartridge column and DyeDeoxyTM terminator cycle sequencing kit for sequencing of DNA were from Applied Biosystems Inc. (Foster City, CA). PCR was performed according to the procedure described by Sambrook et al. (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used as PCR primers were synthesized by a DNA/RNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Inc., model 394) and purified by oligonucleotide purification cartridge column. Unless otherwise stated, PCR was carried out by adding 15 pmol of each primer and an appropriate amount of template DNA to 20 μl of PCR buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100) containing 0.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase and 0.2 mm dNTP. The reaction using a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) was carried out for 35 cycles of 1-min denaturation at 94 °C, 1.5-min annealing at 57 °C, and 2-min extension at 72 °C. To subclone DNA fragments that were amplified by PCR, SureCloneTM ligation kit was used. DNA fragments were blunted by Klenow fragment, inserted into theSmaI site of plasmid vector pUC18, and introduced intoE. coli JM109 by Hanahan's method (20Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8190) Google Scholar). On the other hand, for subcloning of insert DNA of λgt10 phage clone, the insert DNA was excised by EcoRI from phage DNA, which was purified using Qiagen lambda kit and inserted into the EcoRI site of plasmid vector pUC18. E. coli JM109 was transformed as described above. Plasmid DNA was isolated from each transformant by the alkaline lysis procedure (21Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9902) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The nucleotide sequence of the DNA inserted into plasmid vector pUC18 was analyzed by an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., model 373) using the Dye-DeoxyTM terminator cycle sequencing kit. Both strands of all clones were completely sequenced. Hydropathy of amino acid sequence was analyzed (22Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17217) Google Scholar) with the Genetyx program package (Software Development Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). A computer survey of the National Biomedical Research Foundation (Washington, D.C.) and SWISS-PLOT (European Bioinformatics Institute, Geneva, Switzerland) data banks for similarity of amino acid sequences between HAT and other known proteins was carried out using MPsrch program, which was modified from the method of Smith and Waterman (23Smith T.F. Waterman M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 147: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (7150) Google Scholar) with Teijin Systems Technology Ltd. (Yokohama, Japan). In a previous report (18Yasuoka S. Ohnishi T. Kawano S. Tsuchihashi S. Ogawara M. Masuda K. Yamaoka K. Takahashi M. Sano T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we showed that the sequence of the 20 NH2-terminal amino acids of native HAT purified from the sputum of patients with chronic airway diseases was ILGGTEAEEGSWPWQVSLRL (amino acids 187–206 in Fig. 1). Based on this amino acid sequence, we designed and synthesized two kinds of degenerate PCR primers, namely 5′-ATCYTNGGRGGNACNGAGGC-3′ 2Y represents T or C; N represents C or I (inosine); R represents G or A; K represents G or T; M represents A or C; S represents G or C. (sense) and 5′-ARKCKMAGGCTSACYTG-3′2 (antisense) to obtain the 59-bp cDNA fragment encoding the front 19 residues of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence by PCR. PCR was carried out in the reaction mixture containing 5 pmol of each primer and 1 ng of cDNA derived from human trachea (QUICK-CloneTMcDNA). The amplified DNA fragment was then subcloned and sequenced as described above. The analysis of the sequence showed that a 59-bp DNA fragment encoding the 19-residue amino acid sequence corresponding to the NH2 terminus of the purified HAT was produced by this PCR. To obtain a cDNA that had a nucleotide sequence in the downstream side of the 59-bp DNA fragment, we employed the 3′-RACE method developed by Frohman et al. (24Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar). Two kinds of sense primers were used to amplify the cDNA specifically and effectively. These primers were designed and synthesized based on the nucleotide sequence of the 59-bp cDNA fragment. At first, single-stranded cDNAs were synthesized by reverse transcription at 42 °C for 60 min in 20 μl of reaction buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 10 ng of human trachea poly(A)+ RNA, 115 pmol of (dT)17-adapter primer 5′-GACTCGAGTCGACATCGA(dT)17-3′, 25 units of RNase inhibitor, 1 mm dNTP, and 40 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. One-tenth of the reaction mixture was used as a template in the first-round PCR in which 5′-ATCTTGGGGGGCACGGAGGCTGA-3′ and the adapter primer 5′-GACTCGAGTCGACATCGAT-3′ were used as the sense and antisense primers, respectively. For further amplification of the cDNA, the second-round PCR was carried out using one-fortieth of the first-round PCR reaction mixture as the template with 5′-GAGGCTGAGGAGGGAAGCTGGCCGT-3′ (nucleotides 635–659 in Fig. 1) and the (dT)17-adapter primer described above as the sense and antisense primers, respectively. The cDNA amplified by 3′-RACE was then subcloned and sequenced. Plaque hybridization against human trachea cDNA library was performed according to the standard procedure (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The DNA fragment obtained by 3′-RACE was labeled by the random prime method (25Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar) using [α-32P]dCTP and random primer labeling kit. Using this probe, 1 × 106plaques derived from human trachea λgt10 cDNA library were screened by hybridization as follows. The blots for the plaques were hybridized with the probe at 65 °C overnight (16–20 h) in a solution containing 5× SSPE buffer (0.75 m NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. These blots were then washed twice at 65 °C for 20 min with 0.1× SSPE buffer containing 0.1% SDS. Five positive clones were selected and plaque-purified, and the insert DNAs of these clones were then subcloned and sequenced. To obtain a cDNA that had a nucleotide sequence in the upstream side of the cDNA coding for native HAT, amplification of the cDNA was carried out using 5′-RACE kit (24Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar). Single-stranded cDNAs were synthesized by reverse transcription of 2 μg of human trachea poly(A)+RNA using the antisense primer 5′-ACGTGGCAATCCAGTCACGAGGATT-3′ (nucleotides 785–761 in Fig. 1). The single-stranded cDNAs were purified using glass powder in 5′-RACE kit after alkaline hydrolysis of RNA in the reaction mixture. Using T4 RNA ligase, AmpliFINDERTM anchor was ligated to the 3′-ends of the single-stranded cDNAs. PCR amplification (0.75 min at 94 °C, 0.75 min at 57 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C) was then carried out using 0.01 of the ligation mixture as template, with anchor primer 5′-CTGGTTCGGCCCACCTCTGAAGGTTCCAGAATCGATAG-3′ and 5′-TGAGCTGCTGTCAGGATCCACATGT-3′ (nucleotides 741–717 in Fig. 1) as the sense and antisense primers, respectively. The cDNA amplified by 5′-RACE was then subcloned and sequenced. A 1.3-kbBamHI-HindIII fragment containing the entire HAT cDNA was cloned into the transfer vector pBlueBacIII (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) to generate pBacPHAT1. Recombinant HAT-expressing viruses were generated after co-transfection of Sf9 cells with pBacPHAT1 and wild-type AcMNPV DNA essentially as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). For baculovirus/insect cell expression (26Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 16.9.1-16.11.12Google Scholar), 800 ml of Tn5 (27Wickham T.J. Davis T. Granados R.R. Shuler M.L. Wood H.A. Biotechnol. Prog. 1992; 8: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) cells were then infected with the high titer lysate for 72 h and harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was treated with 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h on ice and was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. From this infected cell lysate, the recombinant HAT was isolated by sequential chromatographic procedures of the native HAT purification described previously (18Yasuoka S. Ohnishi T. Kawano S. Tsuchihashi S. Ogawara M. Masuda K. Yamaoka K. Takahashi M. Sano T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and degradation of fibrinogen by HAT were done as described (18Yasuoka S. Ohnishi T. Kawano S. Tsuchihashi S. Ogawara M. Masuda K. Yamaoka K. Takahashi M. Sano T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) The expression level of HAT mRNA in various human tissues was examined by Northern blot analysis. To prepare the probe for the analysis, the full-length cDNA for HAT was 32P-labeled by random priming (25Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar) and hybridized as follows. Northern blots of various human tissues, which contained 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA derived from various tissues in each lane, were probed under the same conditions as the library screening described above (except that the concentration of SDS was 0.5%) and then washed. In the case of the blot for trachea, 2 μg of human trachea poly(A)+ RNA was resolved by 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis (28Lehrack H. Diamond D. Wozney J.M. Boedtker H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4743-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar), and transferred onto HybondTM-N+ blotting membrane and UV-cross-linked. X-ray films were exposed to the probed blots for 4 days at −80 °C with an intensifying screen, and the presence of HAT mRNA in each human tissue was evaluated. These blots were then stripped of the HAT cDNA probe by boiling in 0.5% SDS for 10 min and re-probed with32P-labeled human β-actin control probe as an internal standard for the amounts of RNA loaded. Using a pair of highly degenerate oligonucleotide primers, the partial 59-bp cDNA fragment for HAT, which contained a nucleotide sequence coding for the NH2-terminal 19-residue amino acid sequence of the native HAT, was obtained by PCR amplification from human trachea cDNA. To stretch this cDNA sequence to the 3′-end, a 3′-RACE reaction was carried out. The resulting 0.9-kb amplified product was shown to encompass the entire nucleotide sequence of the 3′ region, including the poly(A) tail of HAT cDNA (nucleotides 635–1517 in Fig.1). The amino acid sequence deduced from this 0.9-kb fragment was shown to exactly contain the 15- amino acid sequence (amino acids 192–206 in Fig. 1) of the NH2-terminal 20-amino acid sequence of the native HAT. With this 0.9-kb cDNA fragment as a probe, 1 × 106clones of a human trachea λgt10 cDNA library were screened. Five of 28 independent positive clones were then subcloned and sequenced. The largest insert was shown to contain a 1323-bp sequence of cDNA (nucleotides 133–1455 in Fig. 1) but was considered not to contain the entire nucleotide sequence of the 5′ region of HAT cDNA. To obtain the missing sequences in the 5′ region of HAT cDNA, 5′-RACE reaction was carried out. The 5′-RACE procedure produced a 741-bp cDNA fragment (nucleotides 1–741 in Fig. 1). This product had a 609-bp nucleotide sequence overlapping (nucleotides 133–741 in Fig. 1) with the 5′-end of the largest insert of cDNA clone obtained by the cDNA library screening. Analysis of the cDNA clones obtained by the successive procedures including 3′-RACE, cDNA library screening, and 5′-RACE showed a 1517-bp nucleotide sequence up to the poly(A) region (Fig. 1), which represented the HAT cDNA sequence. This nucleotide sequence was also shown to contain one open reading frame, and the polypeptide deduced from the cDNA included the 20-residue amino acid sequence of the NH2 terminus of the native HAT (amino acids 187–206 in Fig. 1). The molecular mass of the polypeptide, including the NH2 terminus of the 20 residues to the COOH terminus deduced from the stop codon TAG (nucleotide-1316), was estimated to be 25,308 Da. This value is similar to the apparent molecular mass (27 kDa) estimated by gel filtration of the native HAT protein purified from sputum (18Yasuoka S. Ohnishi T. Kawano S. Tsuchihashi S. Ogawara M. Masuda K. Yamaoka K. Takahashi M. Sano T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the 5′-flanking region of this cDNA, one in-frame stop codon TAG was located at nucleotide 26. Four in-frame ATG codons were detectable between this stop codon and the region encoding the native HAT, but none of these ATG codons satisfied the criteria for a Kozak consensus sequence (29Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). Therefore we could not determine the translational initiation site in the cDNA from the nucleotide sequence. To determine the initiation site, we expressed recombinant HAT in a baculovirus/insect cell system using the HAT cDNA. The recombinant virus containing the HAT cDNA was isolated, and the insect cell Tn5 was infected with the virus and then cultured. The lysate obtained by 1% Triton X-100 treatment of the infected cells was analyzed by immunoblotting with a rabbit antibody against a peptide corresponding to the NH2-terminal 19-amino acid sequence of the native HAT (18Yasuoka S. Ohnishi T. Kawano S. Tsuchihashi S. Ogawara M. Masuda K. Yamaoka K. Takahashi M. Sano T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) as primary antibody, and the immunoblotting indicated that the infected cells biosynthesized a protein with a molecular mass of 48 kDa as a main product (Fig. 2). The molecular mass of each polypeptide, deduced from the nucleotide sequence initiating from each of 4 ATG codons in the cDNA, was 46,263, 32,933, 31,436, and 30,107 Da, respectively. The molecular mass of 46,263 Da is the most similar to that of the recombinant protein expressed in the insect cells, suggesting that the ATG located nearest the 5′-end (at nucleotide 62) is the initiation codon of HAT. To demonstrate that the cloned enzyme has the same activity as the native HAT, the recombinant HAT that was expressed in the baculovirus/insect cell system was isolated in its active form. The minor product in Fig. 2, lane 3 was isolated selectively as the active recombinant HAT from the infected cell lysate by sequential chromatographic procedures of the native HAT purification (18Yasuoka S. Ohnishi T. Kawano S. Tsuchihashi S. Ogawara M. Masuda K. Yamaoka K. Takahashi M. Sano T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The purified recombinant enzyme has the molecular mass of 28 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the identical 10 NH2-terminal residues to the native HAT. Immunoblotting also showed the purified recombinant enzyme as same size as the native HAT (Fig. 2). The recombinant HAT had an enzymatic activity degrading fibrinogen, especially the α-chain (Fig.3), similar to the native HAT. From these results, it was established that the isolated cDNA clone encodes HAT. Based on these results, the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA for HAT (Fig. 1) was summarized as follows. The cDNA includes 1254 nucleotides coding for 418 amino acids and two untranslated nucleotide sequences composed of 61 and 185 nucleotides at the 5′-end and 3′-end, respectively. In the 3′-untranslated region, there is a polyadenylation signal sequence, ATTAAA, at nucleotides 1478–1483, 17 nucleotides distant from the poly(A) tail. The open reading frame of HAT cDNA was thought to encode a polypeptide consisting of 418 amino acid residues, thus having the molecular mass of 46,263 Da. The NH2-terminal 20-amino acid sequence of the native HAT extends from Ile187 to Leu206 in the sequence of the deduced polypeptide (Fig. 1). This result indicates that the Arg186-Ile187 peptide bond in the HAT polypeptide should be cleaved for activation of HAT. This type of cleavage has been shown to be a relatively common step for activation of many known serine protease zymogens (30Blow D.M. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 3. Academic Press, Inc., New York1971: 185-212Google Scholar, 31Keil B. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 3. Academic Press, Inc., New York1971: 250-275Google Scholar). Therefore it is likely that the HAT gene product is synthesized as a precursor protein that consists of a noncatalytic region with 186 amino acid residues (20,955 Da, amino acids 1–186 in Fig. 1) and a catalytic region with 232 amino acid residues (25,308 Da, amino acids 187–418 in Fig. 1) and that the precursor is converted to an active enzyme by limited proteolysis like trypsinogen to trypsin in the small intestine (32Davie E.W. Neurath H. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 212: 515-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this noncatalytic region, there were two potential N-linked glycosylation sites, namely Asn-Asn-Ser and Asn-Pro-Ser, at Asn144 and Asn152, respectively. A hydropathy plot (22Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17217) Google Scholar) of the predicted amino acid sequence of HAT precursor (Fig. 4) showed that a typical NH2-terminal signal sequence (33von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar, 34Wickner W. Science. 1980; 210: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 35von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar) is not present, but a single obvious hydrophobic region (amino acids 13–43 in Fig. 1) is present near the NH2 terminus. This hydrophobic region consisting of 31 amino acid residues does not contain any charged amino acids and is flanked by charged amino acids (Arg12 and Asp44). This internal hydrophobic region is thought to correspond to a transmembrane domain that anchors the protein to the cell membrane (36von Heijne G. Manoil C. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A generalized rule in the eucaryotic transmembrane proteins (37Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 38Parks G.D. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 777-787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) suggests that the difference in total charge between 15-residue sequences on either side of the membrane-spanning hydrophobic region determines the orientation of the protein, with the more positive side facing the cytosol. As for the precursor polypeptide deduced from HAT cDNA, the NH2-terminal side of the hydrophobic region had a net charge of +3, whereas the opposite side had that of +1. The charge on the NH2-terminal side was +2, as positive as that on the COOH-terminal side. This result suggests that HAT precursor has an intracellular NH2-terminal tail region consisting of 12 amino acid residues facing the cytosol and an extracellular COOH-terminal region consisting of 375 amino acid residues and containing the catalytic region. Therefore, the HAT precursor can be classified as a type II integral membrane protein (39High S. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar,40Semenza G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 255-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is thought to be synthesized as a membrane-bound precursor protein translocated to the cell surface, processed to a soluble form, and released. Because neither the precursor nor intermediate form of HAT has been isolated and characterized, it is unknown whether or not the membrane-bound HAT is active on the cell surface. The mechanisms of expression and activation of many serine proteases have been clarified. The predicted maturation process of HAT precursor described above is similar to that of the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subtilisin (41Wells J.A. Ferrari E. Henner D.J. Estell D.A. Chen E.Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7911-7925Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The subtilisin is synthesized as a membrane-associated precursor (preprosubtilisin) and released outside the cell after it is autocatalytically converted to an active form (42Power S.D. Adams R.M. Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3096-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Only mature subtilisin has been detected extracellularly (41Wells J.A. Ferrari E. Henner D.J. Estell D.A. Chen E.Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7911-7925Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Active HAT contained in sputum samples was also detected extracellularly. It is possible that the membrane-bound HAT or the portion remaining in the membrane after release of the soluble HAT may be involved in some important physiological processes on the cell surface through interaction with ligands, other proteins, or the surface. Recent reports have shown that some viruses and a bacterial toxin utilize cell surface proteases as receptors (43Kido H. Fukutomi A. Katunuma N. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: 781-789PubMed Google Scholar, 44Delmas B. Gelfi J. L'Haridon R. Vogel L.K. Sjostrom H. Noten O. Laude H.

Virol. 1993; 67: 6576-6585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Knight P.J.K. Crickmore N. Ellar D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), indicating other usage in addition to intrinsic roles of these proteins. To find any similarity in the primary structure between HAT and known proteins, we surveyed publicly available data banks. Previous investigators have shown that the serine protease family has a common catalytic site consisting of three amino acid residues, His, Asp, and Ser, joined by hydrogen bonds to display catalytic action as a catalytic triad, although they are located apart from each other in the primary structure of the enzyme (48Kraut J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 331-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Based on these established facts, the catalytic site of HAT is thought to consist of amino acid residues His227, Asp272, and Ser368 (Fig.5). In comparison of the amino acid sequence of HAT with those of other serine proteases, the most striking similarity was found around this putative catalytic triad as shown in Fig. 5. Six of seven cysteine residues in the catalytic region of HAT were at identical positions as those of other serine proteases (Fig.5). Nine cysteine residues were contained in the deduced polypeptide of HAT precursor, and the Cys20 was located in the predicted transmembrane domain. Based on the locations of the known disulfide bridges in other serine proteases (49Young C.L. Barker W.C. Tomaselli C.M. Dayhoff M.O. Dayhoff M.O. Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure. 5. National Biochemical Research Foundation, Washington, D. C.1978: 73-93Google Scholar), it is postulated that the other eight cysteine residues may form four disulfide bonds, which are located at cysteine pairs 212/228, 337/353, and 364/393 in the catalytic region and at 173/292 between the noncatalytic region and the catalytic region. It was shown that the amino acid sequence of the catalytic region of HAT was homologous to that of the other human serine proteases: 38% identity with hepsin (50Leytus S.P. Loeb K.R. Hagen F.S. Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), 32% with enteropeptidase (51Kitamoto Y. Veile R.A. Donis-Keller H. Sadler J.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4562-4568Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), 30% with acrosin (52Adham I.M. Klemm U. Maier W.M. Engel W. Hum. Genet. 1990; 84: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and 29% with mast cell tryptase (53Miller J.S. Westin E.H. Schwartz L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1188-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Hepsin, of which the catalytic region shows the highest similarity with that of HAT in this survey, is a cell surface protease widely expressed in various tissues including liver and is suggested to play a role in cell growth and maintenance of cell morphology (54Kurachi K. Torres-Rosado A. Tsuji A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 100-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the amino acid sequence of the noncatalytic region of HAT showed no significant similarity with those of other proteins and had neither kringle nor an EGF-like domain, which are found in some kinds of proteases relating to the blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and complement cascades (55Patthy L. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1990; 1: 153-166PubMed Google Scholar). The function or roles of this unique and relatively long noncatalytic portion of HAT precursor are unknown. Previously, we showed immunohistochemically that HAT protein was expressed in the cells of submucosal serous glands of human bronchi and trachea (18Yasuoka S. Ohnishi T. Kawano S. Tsuchihashi S. Ogawara M. Masuda K. Yamaoka K. Takahashi M. Sano T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Serous glands are widely distributed in various human tissues. Therefore multiple tissue Northern blot analysis was carried out to confirm that HAT mRNA was expressed in the human lower airway and also to clarify whether or not HAT mRNA was expressed in human other tissues. As shown in Fig. 6, a 1.9-kb transcript was detectable in only the trachea blot among the 17 different types of tissues examined, such as heart, brain, pancreas, lung, and liver. The mRNA size is in fairly good accordance with that (1517 bp) of the HAT cDNA established in the present work. In addition to the 1.9-kb mRNA, 3.0-kb and 0.9-kb signals were weakly detectable in the trachea and pancreas blot, respectively. These two transcripts may appear as result of an alternative splicing/polyadenylation process or represent a cross-hybridizing mRNA, but the nature of these transcripts is unknown. These results strongly suggest that HAT mRNA is more actively expressed in the lower airway including trachea than in the other tissues examined and support our previous result that HAT is localized in cells of submucosal serous glands of trachea and bronchi. Although the native HAT was found in the sputum of patients with chronic airway diseases, HAT mRNA is thought to be expressed in the normal tissues of healthy subjects, because the trachea poly(A)+ RNA subjected to the Northern blot was obtained from the normal trachea tissues of three white male subjects who died of trauma or acute heart failure. It will be useful to compare expression levels of mRNA and protein of HAT in the patients with airway diseases with those in healthy subjects to clarify the physiological and pathophysiological significance of HAT in the airway. In the airway, various kinds of proteins such as lysozyme (56Bowes D. Corrin B. Thorax. 1977; 32: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), secretory IgA (57Goodman M.R. Link D.W. Brown W.R. Nakane P.K. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1981; 123: 115-119PubMed Google Scholar), and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (58de Water R. Willems L.A. van Muijen G.N. Franken C. Fransen J.A. Dijkman J.H. Kramps J.A. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1986; 133: 882-890PubMed Google Scholar) are secreted from the submucosal serous glands onto mucous membrane and become constituents of airway mucous or bronchial secretions (59Kaliner M. Shelhamer J.H. Borson B. Nadel J. Patow C. Marom Z. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1986; 134: 612-621PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins play important roles in the host defense system of airways together with respiratory mucous glycoproteins, which are secreted from mucous glands cells and goblet cells (59Kaliner M. Shelhamer J.H. Borson B. Nadel J. Patow C. Marom Z. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1986; 134: 612-621PubMed Google Scholar). HAT may be released from the serous glands with these proteins and play some biological role in the host defense system on the mucous membrane independently of or in cooperation with other substances in airway mucous or bronchial secretions. In summary, it was confirmed through the present work that HAT is a novel trypsin-like serine protease by analyzing the primary structure of the polypeptide deduced from the nucleotide sequence of its cDNA. However, the mechanism of activation of the HAT precursor to mature enzyme, the physiological role of the enzyme, and biological significance of the noncatalytic region of the precursor remain to be resolved."

Inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity by wortmannin blocks osteopontin stimulation of actin filament formation, suggesting that activation of gelsolin-associated PI 3-kinase is an important pathway in cytoskeletal regulation. To study the mechanism of gelsolin-associated PI 3-kinase activation, we analyzed anti-gelsolin immunoprecipitates for the association of protein kinases. We demonstrated that c-Src co-immunoprecipitates with gelsolin, and that osteopontin stimulates its activity. Elimination of osteopontin-stimulated Src activity associated with gelsolin through antisense oligodeoxynucleotides blocked the stimulation of PI 3-kinase activity associated with gelsolin and the gelsolin-dependent cytoskeletal reorganization induced by osteopontin, including increased F-actin levels. In addition, treatment of osteoclasts with antisense oligonucleotides to Src reduced bone resorption. Our results demonstrate that osteopontin stimulates gelsolin-associated Src, leading to increased gelsolin-associated PI 3-kinase activity and PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 levels, which facilitate actin filament formation, osteoclast motility, and bone resorption.

Osteoclasts are multinucleated, giant cells, responsible for bone resorption. Osteoclast adhesion to bone leads to the formation of the osteoclast clear zone: a ring-like adhesion zone circumscribing an area of bone resorption. The cytoplasm of the clear zone contains numerous actin filaments perpendicular to the bone matrix, which are anchored in podosomes (1Marchisio P.C. Cirillo D. Naldini L. Primavera M.V. Teti A.

Podosomes contain numerous proteins observed in the focal adhesions of other cells. Although podosomes and focal adhesions are related, there are important functional differences. Podosomes are less tightly associated with the substratum and are more highly dynamic, changing in size and location and appearing and disappearing with life spans of 2–12 min (4Lakkakorpi P.T. Vaananen H.K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1991; 6: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts are highly motile cells, and podosomes appear to be a preferred cell/matrix attachment mechanism for motility in cells such as macrophages, monocytes, and osteoclasts. The adhesion of osteoclasts through podosomes involves interaction of cell surface receptors, integrins, with matrix components. In osteoclasts, integrin αvβ3 1The abbreviations used are: αvβ3, adhesion receptor αvβ3; OP, osteopontin; GRGDS, Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser cell adhesion sequence; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; ODN, oligodeoxynucleotide; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is responsible for adhesion associated with bone resorption (3Zambonin-Zallone A.

The ligands of αvβ3 are many, and they contain the RGD cell adhesion sequence present in several serum and bone matrix proteins. Osteopontin (OP) is an RGD-containing bone matrix protein, which plays a key role in anchoring osteoclasts to bone surfaces. Besides its role as an anchorage protein, OP is produced by osteoclasts in large quantities (7Ikeda T. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Suda T. Yoshiki S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar),2 and its αvβ3integrin receptor, besides location in the podosomes, is found in the osteoclast membrane opposite to the bone matrix (4Lakkakorpi P.T.

Cell Res. 1991; 195: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We have shown that osteopontin binding to basolateral αvβ3 is an autocrine motility factor regulating the shape and depth of osteoclast resorption (9Chellaiah M. Kwiatkowski D. Alvarez U. Gillis M. Hruska K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: S137Google Scholar). The intracellular biochemical pathways that integrins regulate, and the cellular functions that they control, have recently been the focus of careful scrutiny. Association of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) with the cell surface at focal adhesions directs interactions with the cytoplasmic domains of integrins and their participation in signal transduction (10Ingber D.E.

Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). OP stimulated PtdIns 3,4-P2 and PtdIns 4,5-P2(PtdIns-P2) and PtdIns 3,4,5-P3(PtdIns-P3) levels in osteoclasts (19Hruska K.A. Rolnick F. Huskey M. Alvarez U. Cheresh D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2984-2992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We further defined one specialized domain of increased PtdIns 3,4-P2 and PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 levels as an actin-capping protein found in the podosome, gelsolin (21Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the increase of PtdIns-P2 and PtdIns-P3 associated with gelsolin, uncapped actin oligomers leading to an increase in F-actin content and actin filament formation (21Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). PtdIns-P2regulates several actin-binding proteins, including gelsolin (22Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1987; 325: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), profilin (23Lassing I. Lindberg U. Nature. 1985; 314: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), α-actinin (24Fukami K. Furuhashi K. Inagaki M. Endo T. Hatano S. Takenawa T. Nature. 1992; 359: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and vinculin (25Fukami K. Endo T. Imamura M. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1518-1522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Osteopontin affected PtdIns-P2 and -P3 levels associated specifically with gelsolin and not the other proteins (21Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A marked increase in the level of PtdIns-P2 with gelsolin leads to the hypothesis that PtdIns-P2 synthesis may be essential for podosome assembly and disassembly. OP treatment also resulted in the increased activity of PI 3-kinase associated with gelsolin. Phosphorylation of PtdIns 4,5-P2 by PI 3-kinase associated with gelsolin leads to the formation of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 in OP-treated cells. The physiological function of the association of PI 3-kinase with gelsolin is stimulation of actin polymerization during cell motility, and inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity with wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, blocks the increase in F-actin and actin polymerization stimulated by osteopontin (21Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Examination of the signaling pathways leading to integrin-mediated activation of PI 3-kinase suggests that members of the Src family of nonreceptor kinases may play a role (27Pleiman C.M. Hertz W.M. Cambier J.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 28Escobedo J.A. Navankassatusas K. Kavanaugh W.M. Milfay D. Fried V. Williams L.T.

Biol. 1993; 13: 5226-5232Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase activity is associated with c-Src, and the associated kinase activity increases quickly upon stimulation with thrombin in platelets (31Gutkind J.S. Lacal P.M. Robbins K.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3806-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence reveal that PI 3-kinase is activated by c-Src (32Fukui Y. Kornbluth S. Jong S.M. Wang L.H. Hanafusa H. Oncogene Res. 1989; 4: 283-292PubMed Google Scholar, 33Fukui Y. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1972-1979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). c-Src itself plays an important role in the osteoclast. Deletion of the gene for c-Src in mice results in impaired osteoclast polarization, failure of bone resorption, and osteopetrosis (34Horne W.C. Neff L. Chatterjee D. Lomri A. Levy J.B. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 35Lowe C. Yoneda T. Boyce B.F. Chen H. Mundy G.R. Soriano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4485-4489Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), Osteoclasts from c-Src deficient mice lack ruffled borders and have impaired bone resorptive activity in vitro (36Boyce B.F. Yoneda T. Lowe C. Soriano P. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1622-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Wortmannin inhibited PI 3-kinase activity in osteoclasts both in vivo and in vitro and also ruffled border formation and bone resorption (37Nakamura I. Takahashi N. Sasaki T. Tanaka S. Udagawa N. Murakami H. Kimura K. Kubuyama Y. Kurokawa T. Suda T. Fukui Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These results suggest that both Src and PI3-kinase activity are important in osteoclastic bone resorption. To examine the role of c-Src in the pathway to activation of gelsolin-associated PI 3-kinase from OP/αvβ3 integrin-mediated signaling, we have utilized an antisense strategy to disrupt the function of Src in the avian osteoclast system. Our results demonstrate that c-Src activity associated with the actin-binding protein gelsolin was increased upon treatment with OP. Furthermore, this increase in Src activity was necessary for the activation of gelsolin-associated PI 3-kinase, and for the subsequent increase in F-actin content and actin filament formation stimulated by liganding of αvβ3. Thus, c-Src is upstream of gelsolin-associated PI 3-kinase, and it activates PI 3-kinase. Since the c-Src antisense oligodeoxynucleotides-treated osteoclasts failed to form an organized podosome-containing clear zone, and were deficient in bone resorption, our data address an important second issue regarding the Src knockout phenotype. Our results, at leastin vitro, demonstrate that the osteoclast defect of the Src−/− mouse is not species-specific. They suggest that the avian osteoclasts also possess cellular sites where Src function cannot be substituted for by another member of the Src superfamily.

Protein A-Sepharose, mouse IgG, anti-gelsolin antibody, phospholipid standards, and most of the chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were obtained from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). Protein assay reagent kit and the reagents for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were purchased from Bio-Rad. Antibody to c-Src was purchased from Oncogene (Uniondale, NY). Recombinant c-Src was obtained from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). RNAzol, background quencher, and hybridization solutions were purchased from Tel-Test (Friendswood, TX). Turboblotter transfer system and nylon membranes for RNA transfer were purchased from Schleicher & Schuell. Prime-A-Gene labeling kit and restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Rhodamine-phalloidin was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Avian osteoclast precursors were prepared as described previously (21Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 38Alvarez J.I. Teitelbaum S.L. Blair H.C. Greenfield E.M. Athanasou N.A. Ross F.P. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2324-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, osteoclast precursors were isolated from bone marrow of egg-laying hens maintained on Ca2+-deficient diets. Partially purified preparations of mononuclear cells were recovered from the interface of Ficoll/Hypaque gradients. Nonadherent cells were separated from the adherent population after 18–24 h in culture. The nonadherent cells were sedimented, resuspended in fresh medium (5 × 106cells/ml), and cultured in the presence of cytosine arabinoside (5 μg/ml). Multinucleated osteoclast precursor cells formed between 3 and 6 days in culture, and the preparations were 70–90% pure multinucleated tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive cells. After 4 days in culture, osteoclast precursors were incubated in serum-free media for 2 h. Subsequently cells were treated with one of the following: OP (25 μg/ml for 15 min at 37 °C) or GRGDS (100 μg/ml for 15 min at 37 °C). In some cases herbimycin A was added at a concentration of 100 ng/ml for 14–16 h prior to treatment. Following treatment, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed in a Triton-containing lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.05, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mmZnCl2, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were pelleted by centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C), and the pellets were solubilized by trituration in radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% aprotinin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent kit, and equal amounts of protein lysates were used for immunoprecipitations. Immunoprecipitations and Western blotting were carried out as described (21Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In vitro immune complex protein kinase assays were performed as described previously (39Chellaiah M. Fitzgerald C. Filardo E.J. Cheresh D.A. Hruska K.A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2432-2440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-gelsolin or c-Src antibodies. The immune complexes collected by the addition of protein A-Sepharose were used for kinase assays. The Sepharose beads, after washing several times with the buffers described (39Chellaiah M. Fitzgerald C. Filardo E.J. Cheresh D.A. Hruska K.A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2432-2440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 mmNa3VO4) containing [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi) and casein (1 mg/ml) as an exogenous substrate. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 20 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-sample buffer. The samples were boiled and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and radiolabeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. Experiments were performed with synthetic phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs). 24-mer sequences corresponding to positions 1–24 of c-Src cDNA (40Takeya T. Hanafusa H. Cell. 1983; 32: 881-890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) were constructed. The targeted sequences include the presumed translation initiation site. ODNs were made in both sense, and antisense orientations and the sequences are as follows: sense (5′-ATG GGG AGC AGC AAG AGC AAG CCC 3′) and antisense (5′- GGG CTT GCT CTT GCT GCT CCC CAT 3′). Scrambled ODNs containing the antisense nucleotides were also synthesized and used as a control: 5′-TTT GTT ATC CTC CGT GGC CTC CCG 3′. Osteoclast precursor cells, cultured for 4–6 days were used for permeabilization with streptolysin O (41Duncan R.L. Kizer N. Barry E.L.R. Friedman P.A. Hruska K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar,42Barry E. Gesek F. Friedman P. Biofeedback. 1993; 15: 1019-1020Google Scholar). Osteoclasts were washed twice with permeabilization buffer (120 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2) (43Graves D.D. Lucas S.C. Alexander D.R. Cantrell D.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 190: 407-413Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Freshly prepared dithiothreitol (5 mm), ATP (1 mm), and 0.5 unit/ml streptolysin O and ODNs in sense, antisense, or scrambled orientation at various concentrations were added to the buffer at the time of permeabilization. Resealing was achieved by the addition of α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and incubation was continued for 8 h. Before the end of the 8 h, the cells were serum-starved for 2 h and stimulated with OP as above. ODNs were maintained at the indicated concentration throughout the time mentioned. Additionally, control cells were permeabilized and stimulated with OP as above but in the absence of ODNs. Total RNA was isolated using RNAzol and processed according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Tel-Test). Total RNA (10 μg) was denatured, electrophoresed on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels and transferred to nylon membranes using a Turboblotter transfer system. The membranes were exposed to UV light to cross link the RNA. 32P-Labeled pp60c-src cDNA probes (1.6 kilobase pairs) were random prime-labeled using [α-32P]dCTP. The blots were prehybridized at 37 °C in a solution containing 1 mNaCl, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 50% formamide, and 1× background quencher for 1–2 h and hybridized overnight using the solution in high efficiency hybridization system, as directed by the manufacturers' instructions. Blots were then washed once at room temperature in 5× SSPE, 0.1% SDS; once at 37 °C in 1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS; and twice at 65 °C in 0.1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS. Blots were then analyzed by exposure to x-ray films. Lysate preparation and immunoprecipitations were carried out as described above. Equal amounts of proteins were used for immunoprecipitation. The immune complexes, adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose pellets were assayed for lipid kinase activity. PI 3-kinase was assayed by following the method (44Jackson T.R. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16627-16636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) described previously (21Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, the immune complexes, adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose pellets, were washed successively as follows: once with Triton lysis buffer; twice with 0.5 m LiCl, 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; once with 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6; and finally once with kinase assay buffer (1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4 at 25 °C, 5 mmMgCl2). The pellets were then assayed for inositol lipid kinase activity. Freshly prepared lipid mix (20 μl; Ref. 44Jackson T.R. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16627-16636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was added to the beads; the mix was vortexed gently and then placed at 37 °C for 5 min. Ten microliters of kinase buffer (20 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), containing [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi/assay), and 5 μm Na2ATP was then added. The mixture was gently vortexed and the incubation continued at 37 °C for an additional 15 min. Incubations were terminated by the addition of 0.425 ml of chloroform:methanol:water (5:10:2, v/v). Lipids were then extracted as described (45Whitman M. Kaplan D.R. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L. Roberts T. Nature. 1985; 315: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) and dried under N2. The dried lipids were reconstituted in 100 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1) and spotted on silica gel TLC plates pretreated with 1.2% potassium oxalate in methanol and water (2:3). The plates were developed in chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:acetone:water (40:15:13:12:7) and dried. Bands were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by scanning in GS 300 Transmittance/Reflectance scanning densitometer (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA). Phospholipid standards were visualized by exposure to iodine vapors. F-actin measurement was performed as described (21Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 46Cooper J.A. Carraway K.L. Carraway C.A.C. The Cytoskeleton: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1992: 47-71Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in 24-well culture plates for 4 days, incubated with ODNs after permeabilization with streptolysin O, and treated with OP or vehicle as described above. Eight wells were used for each treatment. The cells were fixed with 1.5% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. The cells were rinsed and incubated with rhodamine-phalloidin in PBS for 30 min. After washing quickly several times with PBS, the cells were extracted with absolute methanol. The fluorescence of each sample was measured using fluorimetry (Gilford Fluoro IV). To assess nonspecific binding, a 10-fold excess of unlabeled phalloidin was used. The nonspecific binding was subtracted from the total binding to get the specific binding. Actin staining was carried out as described (47Brown P.D. Benya P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed briefly with PBS containing 5 mmEGTA (PBS-EGTA) and fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS-EGTA for 20 min at 37 °C. Coverslips were immersed in 47.5% ethanol containing 5 mm EGTA for 15 min at room temperature and rinsed with several changes of PBS-EGTA before staining with 1:20 dilution of rhodamine-phalloidin in PBS-EGTA for 30 min at 37 °C. After rinsing several times with PBS-EGTA, coverslips were mounted on a mounting solution (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingham, CA). Cells were viewed in a Meridian ACAS 570 (Okemos, MI) with confocal option. Rhodamine-phalloidin images were recorded in 514 argon excitation line with a 40×/1.3 numerical aperture oil objective. Confocal images were processed by the Adobe Photoshop software program (Adobe Systems, Inc., Mountain View, CA). Avian osteoclasts were cultured in 24-well plates for 4–6 days. On day 5 in culture, cells were permeabilized and treated with or without ODNs as described above. Bone resorption assays were carried out as described previously (38Alvarez J.I. Teitelbaum S.L. Blair H.C. Greenfield E.M. Athanasou N.A. Ross F.P. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2324-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with ODNs and [3H]proline-labeled bone particles (2 × 104 cpm/ml) in serum-containing media at 37 °C for 12 h. For each treatment, four to six wells were used. Aliquots of supernatants (400 μl) were removed at 12 h and replaced with fresh media containing ODNs. Further aliquots were obtained after 24 h. Released isotope from [3H]proline-labeled bone particle by osteoclasts was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed in Triton-containing lysis buffer as described above, and the protein content was determined as described above. Radioactivity was then normalized to protein content. All comparisons were made to “control,” which refers to mock permeabilized cells or mock permeabilized and vehicle-treated cells. Data presented are mean ± S.E. of experiments performed at different times, normalized to intra-experimental control values. Statistical comparisons between the treatment groups were done using analysis of variance with the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. We have previously reported osteopontin stimulation of gelsolin-associated PI 3-kinase in avian osteoclasts. The activation of PI 3-kinase associated with Triton-soluble gelsolin was required for the osteopontin stimulation of F-actin (21Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase has been identified in a variety of systems associated with receptor tyrosine kinases (45Whitman M. Kaplan D.R. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L. Roberts T. Nature. 1985; 315: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 48Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Soltoff S.P. Libby P. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), and it is known to be a substrate for c-Src. Therefore, anti-gelsolin immunoprecipitates made from lysates of vehicle or OP-treated cells were analyzed for Src association with gelsolin by Western blotting (Fig. 1). c-Src was observed in anti-gelsolin immunoprecipitates of Triton-soluble fractions of cell lysates (Fig. 1 A,lanes 1 and 2). Negligible amounts of Src were associated with the anti-gelsolin immunoprecipitates of Triton-insoluble fractions (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and4). The effect of OP was an increase in ge"

We found that the rapid degradation of nascent apolipoprotein B in HepG2 cells was diminished but not abolished by the addition of any of three different inhibitors of proteasomes. Ubiquitin is conjugated to apolipoprotein B that is not assembled with sufficient lipids either during or soon after synthesis. In addition, we found that apolipoprotein B that has entered the endoplasmic reticulum sufficiently to become glycosylated can be degraded by proteasomes. Furthermore, we detected ubiquitin-apolipoprotein B that is associated with the Sec61 complex, the major constituent of the translocational channel. Treatment of cells with monomethylethanolamine or dithiothreitol decreased the translocation of apolipoprotein B and increased the proportion of ubiquitin-conjugated molecules associated with Sec61. Conversely, treatment of cells with oleic acid, which increased the proportion of translocated apolipoprotein B, decreased the amount of ubiquitin-apolipoprotein B in the Sec61 complex. Finally, we found that inhibition of the interaction between calnexin and apolipoprotein B decreases the translocation of apolipoprotein B, increases the ubiquitin-apolipoprotein B in the Sec61 complex, and increases the proteasomal degradation of glycosylated apolipoprotein B. Thus, ubiquitin can be attached to unassembled apolipoprotein B in the Sec61 complex, and this process is affected by factors including calnexin that alter the translocation of apolipoprotein B.

Full-length apoB100 is secreted on very low density lipoproteins from hepatic cells, and apoB serves as a ligand on low density lipoproteins for the low density lipoprotein receptor. Increased levels of apoB and low density lipoprotein-associated cholesterol in human plasma correlate with increased risks of coronary artery disease. In HepG2 cells, a large amount of newly synthesized apoB is degraded (5Sato R. Imanaka T. Takatsuki A. Takano T. J. Biol.

Intracellular disposal appears to be the principal means of regulating the secretion of apoB. Since an inhibitor of calpains and cysteine proteases, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN), can protect apoB from degradation, an uncharacterized cysteine protease was proposed to be responsible for the apoB degradation (6Thrift R.N.

Recently, it has been shown that most if not all of these proteins undergo retrograde transport from the lumen of the ER back into the cytosol through a protein-conducting channel containing the Sec61 complex (20Wiertz E.J.H.J.

Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The Sec61 complex, which consists of α, β, and γ subunits, is the major constituent of the channel used for translocation into the ER. However, apoB has not been shown to be transported retrograde prior to degradation. Several experimental interventions have been shown to affect translocation, secretion, and degradation. Stimulating lipid synthesis by the addition of oleic acid (OA) increases the proportion of apoB that is fully translocated and secreted and decreases the amount that is degraded (7Sakata N. Wu X. Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22967-22970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol.

The effect of calnexin, another chaperone in the ER, on the translocation of apoB has not been examined previously. Molecules of apoB that are not completely translocated into the ER can be degraded. Thrift et al. (6Thrift R.N. Drisko J. Dueland S. Trawick J.D. Davis R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9161-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) first showed in a non-hepatic cell line that molecules of apoB that are not fully translocated into the ER are degraded by an ALLN-sensitive pathway. More recent data suggest that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway could be responsible for degradation of incompletely translocated apoB (11Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H.

Unlike typical secretory proteins, not all of the apoB molecules are completely translocated into the ER. Several investigators have found newly synthesized apoB with large domains exposed to the cytosol. These domains are accessible to proteolytic cleavage (26Macri J. Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7328-7337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Chuck S.L. Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. McCarthy B.J. Lingappa V.R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25220-25224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The cytosolic domains of such molecules of apoB would be accessible to ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and proteasomes. The location of this incompletely translocated apoB that could be bound by ubiquitin is not known. Such molecules could reside entirely on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane, whether due to aborted forward translocation or retrograde transfer. Alternatively, these ubiquitin-conjugated apoB proteins (ub-apoB) might be spanning the ER membrane either in the lipid bilayer itself or within the translocational apparatus. In this study, we examine the kinetics and action of ubiquitin and proteasomes in the degradation of different subsets of apoB. We also demonstrate a role for calnexin in the proteasomal degradation of glycosylated apoB. Furthermore, we investigate the intertwined roles of translocation and proteasomal degradation in regulating the secretion of apoB. α modification of Eagle's medium (αMEM) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) were purchased from Mediatech. Minimum essential medium (MEM) without methionine/cysteine, water-soluble oleic acid, 2-(methylamino)ethanol (monomethylethanolamine, MME), ALLN, and brefeldin A (BFA) were obtained from Sigma. Castanospermine (CST) was purchased from Calbiochem. DTT was obtained from Fisher. Protein A- and protein G-agarose beads were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Trans-label [35S]methionine/ cysteine and [3H]d-mannose were obtained from ICN Biochemicals.

Haas (33Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies against Sec61α and Sec61β, and the peptide that was used to raise the antibody against Sec61β, were generous gifts from Walther Mothes and Tom Rapoport (34Gorlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar,35Gorlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Antibody against ubiquitin that was used for Western blotting was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, antisera against human apoB were purchased from Calbiochem and Boehringer Mannheim, and antiserum against calnexin was obtained from StressGen. HepG2 cells (obtained from American Type Culture Collection) were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in αMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were used at about 90% confluence. In some experiments, proteasomal inhibitors, BFA, MME, OA, CST, or DTT were added to the preincubation, labeling, and chase media as indicated in the figure legends. HepG2 cells were preincubated in cysteine-, methionine-, and serum-free MEM for 1 h and then pulse-labeled with 50–200 μCi/ml trans-label [35S]methionine/cysteine for 10 min or 1 h. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) once, labeled cells were chased for various times in serum-free αMEM. For labeling with [3H]mannose, glucose- and serum-free DMEM were used for the preincubation and pulse labeling. After 1 h preincubation, HepG2 cells were pulse-labeled with 50 μCi/ml [3H]mannose for up to 1 h. The cells were washed with PBS once and then chased for different times in medium containing a 1,000-fold excess of unlabeled mannose. After various times of chase, pulse-labeled cells were lysed with TXSWB (1% Triton X-100, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)) (36Chuck S.L. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 9-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation of calnexin, cells were lysed in cholate buffer (2% sodium cholate, 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mmPMSF). For immunoprecipitation of Sec61β, cells were lysed in digitonin buffer (1% digitonin, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF) containing 100 mm NaCl for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoprecipitation of Sec61α required lysis of cells in TX2 buffer (2% Triton X-100, 500 mm potassium acetate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm PMSF) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cellular lysates were spun for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. No apoB was detected in the unsolubilized cellular debris. The supernatants were incubated at 4 °C with an excess amount of the appropriate antibodies for at least 1 h. Protein A- or protein G-agarose beads were added, and the samples were rotated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and then twice with wash buffer (500 mm potassium acetate, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, for Sec 61α immunoprecipitates; 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, for calnexin immunoprecipitates; 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl for all other immunoprecipitates). For sequential immunoprecipitation, the immunoprecipitates were boiled for 10 min in elution buffer containing 2% SDS. The supernatants were diluted with 40-fold TXSWB, and a second immunoprecipitation was performed. The immunoprecipitates were solubilized in sample buffer (4% SDS, 125 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 500 mm DTT) at 37 °C, boiled for 10 min, and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). For labeling studies, the gel was treated with ENHANCE™ (DuPont), dried, and exposed to film. For Western blotting, proteins were transferred overnight onto nitrocellulose membranes, probed with antibody as indicated in the figure legends, and revealed by peroxidase conjugated to anti-rabbit or anti-goat IgG antibodies using the LumiGLO substrate kit (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Some blots were stripped in buffer (2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at 70 °C for 30 min prior to a second immunodetection. HepG2 cells were suspended in homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm PMSF, 50 μmALLN). Cell homogenization was carried out using a motorized Dounce homogenizer (30 strokes). The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to pellet cellular debris and nuclei. Microsomes were isolated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 170,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. The microsomes were extracted with sodium carbonate, pH 11.5, for 1 h at 4 °C (37Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar), and the supernatant was subjected to sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation according to Boren et al. (38Boren J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9858-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (No apoB was detected in the pelleted membranes.) The gradient was unloaded into 12 fractions; the densities of each fraction were very similar to those previously reported with this method (38Boren J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9858-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoB was recovered from each fraction by immunoprecipitation and visualized by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. HepG2 cells were preincubated for 2 h in cysteine-, methionine-, and serum-free MEM and then pulse-labeled with 200 μCi/ml trans-label [35S]methionine/cysteine for 10 min. ALLN was included in the preincubation and labeling media. After washing with PBS, the labeled cells were lysed in digitonin buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. The peptide used to raise antibody against Sec61β was added to 1 aliquot of the cell lysate at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. Immunoprecipitation with Sec61β antibody was carried out as described above. To define the kinetics and extent to which proteasomes degrade apoB, we performed pulse-chase analyses using HepG2 cells treated with ALLN, ZL3H, or lactacystin. HepG2 cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 10 min in the presence or absence of different proteasome inhibitors and followed by various times of chase. ApoB was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The three inhibitors had similar protective effects on apoB. Nascent apoB in untreated cells was dramatically degraded starting at a very early chase time; 40% of the apoB was degraded after 10 min of chase (Fig. 1). Since it has been estimated that 14–20 min are necessary to synthesize a full-length apoB molecule (12Benoist F. Grand-Perret T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20435-20442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 39Bostrom K. Wettesten M. Boren J. Bondjers G. Wiklund O. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13800-13806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), degradation must begin during or within a very short time after synthesis. Treatment of cells with lactacystin, ALLN, or ZL3H resulted in increased levels of apoB. After 30 min of chase, more than 75% of apoB molecules in the untreated cells were degraded, whereas about 70% of apoB molecules still remained intact in inhibitor-treated cells (Fig. 1). Analysis of the kinetics of degradation demonstrated a significant difference (p < 0.01) in rates of removal (slopes in Fig. 1 B) in the presence or absence of an inhibitor. These data indicate that proteasomes degrade apoB molecules rapidly within a short time after synthesis. Protein ubiquitination is a critical step in the degradation of most proteins by the proteasome pathway (40Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin has been detected on apoB (10Yeung S.J. Chen S.H. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 11Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20427-20434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), although it is unclear how soon after synthesis this conjugation occurs. To determine when ubiquitination of apoB takes place, HepG2 cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and then chased for 0, 10, 30, and 60 min. Sequential immunoprecipitation was performed using antiserum against apoB followed by antiserum against ubiquitin. Ub-apoB appears at a very early time even in the sample without chase which suggests that ubiquitin is conjugated to apoB during or immediately after synthesis (Fig. 2). Association with lipids is a prerequisite for apoB secretion, and some early steps in particle formation can occur cotranslationally (38Boren J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9858-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We wondered whether apoB that is assembled with lipids into nascent particles would escape conjugation with ubiquitin. To investigate the correlation between ubiquitin binding and the amount of lipid bound to apoB, microsomes were prepared from HepG2 cells, extracted with sodium carbonate, and the proteins that were released were fractionated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation according to Boren et al. (38Boren J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9858-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoB molecules were recovered from each fraction of the gradient by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies either against apoB or ubiquitin. As described previously (38Boren J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9858-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), some of the apoB was found to float in the gradient with a density of high density lipoprotein (HDL)-like particles (Fig. 3 A,fractions 3–9). When the blot was reprobed with anti-ubiquitin antiserum, ubiquitin was found only on the lipid-poor apoB recovered from the bottom of the gradient (Fig. 3 B,fractions 1 and 2). The anti-ubiquitin immunoreactive smear with apparent higher molecular weight reflects the covalent attachment of multiple ubiquitin chains to apoB molecules. These results indicate that only apoB that is not assembled with sufficient lipids can be marked with ubiquitin. It has been shown that incompletely translocated apoB53 molecules are degraded by an ALLN-sensitive pathway in non-hepatic cells (6Thrift R.N. Drisko J. Dueland S. Trawick J.D. Davis R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9161-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, it is not known to what extent full-length apoB100 enters the ER of hepatic cells prior to its degradation by proteasomes. To determine whether apoB with at least some domains translocated is degraded by proteasomes, we investigated the degradation of glycosylated apoB. Furthermore, we tested whether N-linked high-mannose oligosaccharides protect apoB or become attached to those molecules of apoB that have escaped proteasomal degradation. We pulse-labeled HepG2 cells with [3H]mannose for 10 min, washed the cells with PBS, and then incubated the cells in medium with a 1,000-fold excess of unlabeled mannose for various times. Glycosylated apoB was degraded in a manner similar to 35S-labeled apoB (Fig.4). When HepG2 cells were treated with 10 μm lactacystin, about three times as much glycosylated apoB remained after 240 min indicating that glycosylated apoB can be degraded by proteasomes. Calnexin is a molecular chaperone that is localized in the ER (41Ou W.J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). By associating transiently with nascent influenza hemagglutinin, calnexin can regulate protein folding, oligomerization, and degradation (42Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2961-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Calnexin can bind to a number of glycoproteins including apoB, although the role of calnexin in apoB biogenesis is not defined (41Ou W.J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 43Patel S.B. Grundy S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18686-18694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). When cells are preincubated with castanospermine (CST), the trimming of glucose residues is prevented and the binding of glycoproteins by calnexin is inhibited (42Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2961-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Since glycosylated apoB is degraded by proteasomes, we investigated the role of calnexin in the degradation of apoB. First, we confirmed the effect of CST on the binding of calnexin to apoB. HepG2 cells were labeled for 1 h with [35S]methionine/cysteine in the presence or absence of 1 mm CST, and the association of calnexin with apoB was measured by co-immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig.5 A, treatment with CST decreased the co-immunoprecipitation of apoB by about 45%. However, CST had no effect on the immunoprecipitation of calnexin. We next examined the role of calnexin in the degradation of glycosylated apoB by proteasomes. HepG2 cells were pulse-labeled in the presence or absence of 1 mm CST with [3H]mannose and then chased with medium containing 1,000-fold unlabeled mannose with or without CST for 1 h. In the presence of CST, over twice as much apoB was degraded in 1 h compared with untreated cells (Fig. 5 B). To ascertain the pathway that leads to the increased loss of apoB caused by the treatment of CST, we repeated the above experiment in the presence of lactacystin. The addition of lactacystin completely inhibited the increased degradation of apoB caused by CST (Fig. 5 C). These results suggest that the interaction between apoB and calnexin protects apoB from degradation by proteasomes. Not all molecules of apoB are fully translocated into the ER upon completion of translation; many have large domains exposed to the cytosol (26Macri J. Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7328-7337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar,28Chuck S.L. Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. McCarthy B.J. Lingappa V.R.

We wondered if ubiquitin binds to this partially translocated apoB while it is still in the Sec61-containing translocation channel. First, we established the specificity of co-immunoprecipitating apoB with antibody against Sec61β. Digitonin extracts were prepared from HepG2 cells treated with ALLN and labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine. Under these conditions, the Sec61 complex (consisting of α, β, and γ subunits) remains intact (35Gorlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Upon the addition of antibody against Sec61β, apoB was co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 6 A, second lane). To demonstrate that this material represented Sec61β-apoB conjugates, we added Sec61β peptide to samples before the a"
https://openalex.org/W1990648589,"Inherited forms of the human transmissible spongiform encephalopathy Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) have been associated with mutations in the normal soluble, protease-sensitive form of the host prion protein (PrP-sen). Normal PrP protein contains five copies of a repeating eight-amino acid region, and PrP molecules with six or more copies of this region are associated with disease in familial CJD. It has been hypothesized that these mutations might facilitate spontaneous formation of the abnormal, aggregated protease-resistant PrP isoform, PrP-res, associated with clinical CJD and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). In the present experiments, hamster PrP molecules with 5 (wild-type), 7, 9, or 11 copies of this repeat region were generated and expressed in mouse fibroblast cells or mouse neuroblastoma cells. In mouse fibroblast cells, mutant hamster PrP molecules expressing 7, 9, and 11 copies of the octapeptide repeat sequence showed altered cell surface expression, but both mutant and wild-type hamster PrP-sen molecules demonstrated abnormal properties of aggregation and increased protease resistance. By contrast in mouse neuroblastoma cells, hamster PrP-sen with 5, 9, and 11 octapeptide repeats were expressed normally on the cell surface, but only PrP-sen molecules with 9 or 11 copies of the repeat motif had abnormal properties of aggregation and increased protease resistance. Overall, regardless of cell type, hamster PrP molecules with greater than 7 octapeptide repeats were more aggregated and more protease-resistant than molecules with 7 repeats or less. However, these abnormal molecules were at least 1000-fold less protease-resistant than bona fide PrP-res derived from TSE-infected brain tissue, and they showed no increased ability to form PrP-res in a cell-free system. Inherited forms of the human transmissible spongiform encephalopathy Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) have been associated with mutations in the normal soluble, protease-sensitive form of the host prion protein (PrP-sen). Normal PrP protein contains five copies of a repeating eight-amino acid region, and PrP molecules with six or more copies of this region are associated with disease in familial CJD.

The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) 1The abbreviations used are: TSE, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy; CJD, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; PK, proteinase K; PrP, prion protein; PrP-sen, protease-sensitive PrP; PrP-res, protease-resistant PrP; HaPrP, hamster PrP; PIPLC, phosphotidylinositol-specific phospholipase C; MNB, mouse neuroblastoma; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. are a group of rare, neurodegenerative diseases which include scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle and kuru, and Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans. In humans, TSE disease can occur in iatrogenic, sporadic, and familial forms. Iatrogenic CJD is associated with exposure to CJD contaminated materials such as dura mater, corneal transplants, or cadaver-derived human growth hormone. Sporadic CJD occurs with a worldwide incidence of 1 in 1–2 million. In sporadic CJD there is no known exposure to the infectious CJD agent and the exact cause of disease is unclear (1Pocchiari M. Mol. Aspects Med. 1994; 15: 195-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Familial TSE are forms of CJD or Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome which vary in disease incubation times and clinical presentation and are associated with both point and insertion mutations in the PrP gene (see Pocchiari (1Pocchiari M. Mol. Aspects Med. 1994; 15: 195-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) for review). The insertion mutations occur in a portion of the PrP gene that has five copies of a repeating eight amino acid region and involve extra copies of this motif (2Goldfarb L.G. Brown P. McCombie W.R.

In families with insertional mutations onset of disease is usually early in life and the disease course is long, sometimes lasting several years. Generally, the greater the number of insertions the longer the disease and the earlier the age of onset (6Capellari S. Vital C. Parchi P. Petersen R.B. Ferrer X. Jarnier D. Pegoraro E. Gambetti P.

Transmissible Subacute Spongiform Encephalopathies: Prion Diseases. Elsevier, Paris1996: 425-431Google Scholar). A key event in the pathogenesis of the TSE is the conversion of a normal, proteinase K-sensitive host protein, PrP-sen, into an abnormal partially proteinase K-resistant form, PrP-res. Direct interactions between PrP-sen and PrP-res are necessary for this conversion to occur (9Borchelt D.R. Scott M. Taraboulos A. Stahl N. Prusiner S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 10Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18217-18223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). PrP-sen and PrP-res are encoded by the same host gene, and there are no known differences in post-translational modifications between the two molecules which distinguishes them (12Hope J.

Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1991-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). PrP-res has been detected in most familial CJD patients with octapeptide repeat insertions in the PrP gene (6Capellari S. Vital C. Parchi P. Petersen R.B. Ferrer X. Jarnier D. Pegoraro E. Gambetti P. Julien J. Neurology. 1997; 49: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 7Cochran E.J. Bennett D.A. Cervenakova L. Kenney K. Bernard B. Foster N.L. Benson D.F. Goldfarb L.G. Brown P. Neurology. 1996; 47: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether the PrP-res is derived from the mutant PrP allele, the normal PrP allele, or both. One possible explanation for the occurrence of familial CJD is that the mutant PrP protein can spontaneously form PrP-res which slowly accumulates over time, eventually leading to disease. In partial support of this hypothesis, a mutant mouse PrP protein containing 11 copies of the amino acid repeat was shown to have a slightly increased resistance to low concentrations of proteinase K (PK) and was not expressed normally on the surface of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (14Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 15Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 5610-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In vivo, PrP molecules with six or more copies of the repeat region are all associated with disease, but the effect of increasing numbers of the repeat region on aggregation and protease resistance is unknown. To more closely examine the relationship between the number of amino acid repeats and increased aggregation and protease resistance, we engineered hamster PrP (HaPrP) molecules which contained 5 (wild-type), 7, 9, and 11 copies of this region and assayed their characteristics in two different cell types. In mouse fibroblast cells, PrP molecules with greater than 5 copies of the octapeptide repeat were expressed abnormally on the cell surface, but all PrP molecules tested showed a significant increase in aggregation and a slight increase in protease resistance. However, in mouse neuroblastoma cells, all PrP molecules tested were expressed normally on the cell surface and only PrP molecules with 9 or 11 copies of the octapeptide motif demonstrated an increase in aggregation and protease resistance. Our studies suggest that in vivo the cell type in which PrP is expressed may be an important determinant of whether or not mutant PrP-sen acquires abnormal properties. The wild-type HaPrP clone has been described previously (17Chesebro B. Wehrly K. Caughey B. Nishio J. Ernst D. Race R. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1993; 80: 131-140PubMed Google Scholar). The clones made are summarized in Fig. 1 A(see “Results”). To insert additional copies of the octapeptide motif into HaPrP, a BamHI site was engineered into wild-type HaPrP cloned into the vector Bluescript-SK (Stratagene). The primers used for amplification were the M13 primer and the HaPrP primer 5′-TACCCACCTCAGGGTGGCGGCGGATCCTGGGGGCAG-3′ which introduces a BamHI site at codons 55 and 56 of HaPrP. The mutated bases are underlined. Although this introduces a Thr to Ser change at codon 56 in HaPrP, the sequence of the octapeptide repeat is the same as repeat motifs in other PrP molecules (1Pocchiari M. Mol. Aspects Med. 1994; 15: 195-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction product was confirmed by sequencing and the HaPrP with the BamHI site was subcloned into the Bluescript-SK vector or the retroviral vector pSFF (17Chesebro B. Wehrly K. Caughey B. Nishio J. Ernst D. Race R. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1993; 80: 131-140PubMed Google Scholar) from which the BamHI site had been removed. Overlapping oligonucleotides were synthesized and annealed to generate a DNA fragment containing the amino acid repeat motif Trp-Gly-Gln-Pro-His-Gly-Gly-Gly-Trp-Gly Gln-Pro-His-Gly-Gly-Ser. The oligonucleotides used were 5′-GATCATGGGGGCAGCCCCACGGTGGTGGCTGGGGCCAACCACACGGGG3-′ and 3′-TACCCCCGTCGGGGTGCCACCACCGACCCCGGTTGGTGTGCCCCCTAG-5′. Both ends of the sequence had BamHI restriction endonuclease 3′ overhangs but only one restored the BamHI restriction site (underlined). The reconstituted fragment was ligated into theBamHI HaPrP mutant at the BamHI site resulting in the in-frame insertion of the two copies of the amino acid repeat motif and regeneration of the single BamHI site. Sequential insertion of this DNA fragment was used to generate clones containing 9 and 11 copies of the repeat region (Fig. 1 A). Hamster PrP molecules expressing 5, 7, 9, and 11 copies of the octapeptide repeat region were expressed in a mixture of the retroviral packaging cell lines Ψ2 and PA317. These cells are NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells modified to generate infectious retroviruses (17Chesebro B. Wehrly K. Caughey B. Nishio J. Ernst D. Race R. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1993; 80: 131-140PubMed Google Scholar). Following transduction, the Ψ2/PA317 cells expressed high levels of the hamster PrP proteins. Individual cell clones were not derived as >95% of the cells were positive for the expressed construct by immunofluorescence analysis and expression levels were stable over multiple cell passes (data not shown). The mouse neuroblastoma (MNB) cell line N2a and the MNB cell line that expresses the wild-type HaPrP gene have been described previously (18Priola S.A. Caughey B. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3299-3305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All of the MNB cell lines expressing exogenous HaPrP constructs with 9 or 11 copies of the octapeptide repeat region were produced by transducing MNB cells with retroviral vectors expressing the various PrP constructs. Single-cell clones expressing high levels of HaPrP protein recognized by the hamster-specific monoclonal antibody 3F4 were derived as described previously (18Priola S.A. Caughey B. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3299-3305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). At least two independent cell lines were assayed for each HaPrP. All MNB cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 300 units/ml penicillin. The Ψ2/PA317 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 300 units/ml penicillin plus 10% calf bovine serum. Treatment of radiolabeled cell monolayers with PIPLC was done as described previously (18Priola S.A. Caughey B. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3299-3305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, a confluent 25-cm2 flask of cells was incubated in the presence of Tran35S-labeled methionine/cysteine (ICN) for 90 min at 37 °C and then incubated for 30 min in 10% fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's modified essential medium. Cells were next incubated in the presence of 0.2 unit/ml PIPLC at 37 °C for 30 min. The medium was collected and assayed for the presence of radiolabeled PrP. The cell monolayer was lysed and the lysate was also assayed for radiolabeled PrP. A confluent 75-cm2 flask of cells was lysed as described previously (18Priola S.A. Caughey B. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3299-3305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Assays were done on either equivalent aliquots of the cell lysate (1/15th of the total lysate) or on cell lysates which had been adjusted to the same protein concentration in order to keep the detergent:protein ratio the same. Results were similar for both techniques. Lysates were treated with increasing concentrations of PK for 30 min at 37 °C. PK was inactivated with protease inhibitors and the lysate precipitated by adding four volumes of methanol. To assay aggregated PrP, another aliquot of the same cell lysate was centrifuged over a 5% sucrose, lysing buffer cushion for 45 min at 353,000 × g as described previously (18Priola S.A. Caughey B. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3299-3305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Detection of HaPrP was by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using the HaPrP-specific monoclonal antibody 3F4 as described previously (18Priola S.A. Caughey B. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3299-3305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The in vitro conversion of HaPrP-sen to HaPrP-res was as described previously (11Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of HaPrP-res was incubated with 10–20,000 cpm of radiolabeled HaPrP-sen at 37 °C for 2 days. After incubation, 1/10 of the reaction was precipitated in methanol. The remaining 9/10 was treated with 80 μg/ml PK for 1 h at 37 °C, PK was inactivated with protease inhibitors, and the protein was methanol-precipitated. Radiolabeled protease-resistant products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amount of protease-resistant (17–32 kDa) and protease-sensitive (25–70 kDa) radiolabeled protein was determined using the Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager system. Bands were quantified in terms of volume, and the percent conversion was calculated using the formula Percent conversion=(vol of protease­resistant)(vol of protease­sensitive)(10)×100Equation 1 Hamster PrP contains a repeating region of amino acids consisting of one nine-amino acid motif and four tandem copies of an eight-amino acid region. Hamster PrP with 5 (HaPrP-5, wild-type), 7 (HaPrP-7), 9 (HaPrP-9), or 11 (HaPrP-11) copies of the octapeptide repeat regions (Fig.1 A) were derived and expressed in the retroviral packaging cell line mix Ψ2/PA317. These cells were derived from NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (17Chesebro B. Wehrly K. Caughey B. Nishio J. Ernst D. Race R. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1993; 80: 131-140PubMed Google Scholar). All cells expressed similar levels of the different glycosylated forms of monomeric HaPrP as well as the dimeric form of HaPrP we have described previously for HaPrP-5 (18Priola S.A. Caughey B. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3299-3305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The expected increase in molecular mass was observed with the successive addition of the eight amino acid repeat region (Fig.1 B). No difference was observed in the kinetics of biosynthesis or the turnover rate of the mutant HaPrP proteins when compared with wild-type HaPrP (data not shown). PrP is normally attached to the cell surface via a phosphotidylinositol anchor (19Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Hsiao K. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar), but mutant PrP molecules can be aberrantly expressed on the cell surface (14Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 15Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1633-1637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 20Petersen R.B. Parchi P. Richardson S.L. Urig C.B. Gambetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12661-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We tested the cell-surface expression of the three mutant HaPrP proteins by treating the Ψ2/PA317 cells with PIPLC which specifically cleaves the phosphotidylinositol anchor attaching PrP to the cell surface. As the number of repeats increased, the amount of monomeric HaPrP released by PIPLC decreased (Fig.2 A). Consistent with a previous study (18Priola S.A. Caughey B. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3299-3305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the HaPrP dimer was not releasable by PIPLC treatment. These results demonstrated that in Ψ2/PA317 cells aberrant cell surface expression of HaPrP correlated with increasing numbers of octapeptide repeats. Fibroblast cells are not susceptible to infection with scrapie (21Race R.E. Fadness L.H. Chesebro B. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 1391-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar,22Race R.E. Caughey B. Graham K. Ernst D. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2845-2849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine how the mutant PrP molecules would act in cells which are known to support TSE infectivity, the same HaPrP constructs were expressed in mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells. These cells are susceptible to scrapie infection (21Race R.E. Fadness L.H. Chesebro B. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 1391-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 22Race R.E. Caughey B. Graham K. Ernst D. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2845-2849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Single cell clones of mouse neuroblastoma cells expressing HaPrP-5, HaPrP-9, and HaPrP-11 were derived. These clones expressed similar levels of the recombinant HaPrP proteins and no difference was observed in the kinetics of biosynthesis or the turnover rate of the mutant HaPrP proteins when compared with wild-type HaPrP (data not shown). We tested the cell-surface expression of the two mutant HaPrP proteins by treating the MNB cell clones with PIPLC. PIPLC released approximately 60% of only the monomeric forms of the wild-type and mutant HaPrP molecules (Fig. 2 B). Surprisingly, there was no difference in PIPLC releasability between the HaPrP-5, HaPrP-9, and HaPrP-11 proteins. The data suggested that cell surface expression of GPI-linked HaPrP was not just an intrinsic property of the PrP amino acid sequence but could also be dependent upon the cell type in which the mutant was expressed. Consequently, other characteristics of normal and mutant HaPrP were assayed in both Ψ2/PA317 fibroblast cells and in mouse neuroblastoma cells. One of the distinguishing characteristics of PrP-res is its ability to form large aggregates (23Prusiner S.B. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Bendheim P.E. Bolton D.C. Groth D.F. Glenner G.G. Cell. 1983; 35: 349-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 24Bolton D.C. McKinley M.P. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5898-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 25Meyer R.K. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Braunfeld M.B. Barry R.A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2310-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). To test the aggregation of mutant HaPrP proteins expressed in Ψ2/PA317 cells and MNB cells, cell lysates were centrifuged under conditions which pelleted particles ≥20 S in size (18Priola S.A. Caughey B. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3299-3305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In Ψ2/PA317 cells, monomeric HaPrP proteins with 5, 7, 9, and 11 copies of the octapeptide repeat sequence aggregated to a greater extent than the same constructs in MNB cells, while the dimeric forms of these constructs aggregated less in Ψ2/PA317 cells when compared with MNB cells (Fig. 3, A andB). The differences in aggregation of HaPrP-5 and HaPrP-11 in Ψ2/PA317 cells and MNB cells were significant (p≤ 0.0006). In general, as the number of repeats increased so too did the tendency of the PrP protein to aggregate. HaPrP proteins with greater than 7 copies of the octapeptide repeat region were almost always more aggregated than wild-type HaPrP-5 (Fig. 3). These differences suggested that the extent of aggregation was not only a consequence of the protein sequence but also a consequence of the cell-type in which the protein was expressed. The mutant HaPrP proteins with extra copies of the octapeptide repeat region resembled PrP-res in that they showed a greater tendency to form aggregates than did wild-type HaPrP protein. Next, we tested whether or not the mutant HaPrP proteins had an increased resistance to PK, another characteristic of PrP-res. Cell lysates were digested with increasing concentrations of PK and the amount of HaPrP remaining was assayed. The monomeric and dimeric forms of the protein were similarly resistant to PK and the combined data for both PrP forms is shown in Fig.4. In both cell types, constructs with greater than 7 copies of the octapeptide repeat regions showed an increase in PK resistance with HaPrP-11 > HaPrP-9 > HaPrP-7 or -5. All of the constructs in Ψ2/PA317 cells were more resistant to PK treatment (Fig. 4 A) than the same constructs expressed in MNB cells (Fig. 4 B). These data demonstrated that an increase in the number of octapeptide repeats in HaPrP led to an increase in the resistance of HaPrP to digestion by PK. However, this PK-resistance is 1000-fold less than that of PrP-res derived from scrapie-infected hamster brain which is greater than 95% resistant to digestion with up to 500 μg/ml PK for 30 min at 37 °C (26McKinley M.P. Bolton D.C. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1983; 35: 57-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). PrP-sen mutants containing extra copies of the octapeptide motif may induce familial TSE by forming PrP-res more easily than wild-type PrP-sen. To determine if the mutant HaPrP proteins formed PrP-res more efficiently than wild-type HaPrP, mutant and wild-type HaPrP-sen proteins were assayed for their ability to form protease-resistant products in a cell-free conversion assay (11Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). In the absence of HaPrP-res, none of the HaPrP proteins tested was able to spontaneously convert to HaPrP-res under the conditions used (Fig.5, A and B). In the presence of HaPrP-res, wild-type and mutant HaPrP-sen proteins from either Ψ2/PA317 or MNB cells were induced to convert to PrP-res with similar yields (Fig. 5, A and B). The results demonstrated that the insertion of extra octapeptide repeats did not result in a mutant PrP-sen molecule which formed PrP-res more efficiently than wild-type PrP-sen in this cell-free system. In this study we examined the relationship between an increase in the number of octapeptide repeats and the acquisition of abnormal properties in PrP. As the number of repeats increased so did the aggregation and PK resistance of the mutant PrP protein. Interestingly, our data correlate with in vivo observations that increasing numbers of the repeat motif are associated with an earlier onset of familial CJD (6Capellari S. Vital C. Parchi P. Petersen R.B. Ferrer X. Jarnier D. Pegoraro E. Gambetti P. Julien J. Neurology. 1997; 49: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 8Goldfarb L.G. Cervenakova L. Brown P. Gajdusek D.C. Court L. Dodet B. Transmissible Subacute Spongiform Encephalopathies: Prion Diseases. Elsevier, Paris1996: 425-431Google Scholar). The increased aggregation and/or protease-resistance of the mutant PrPs could be responsible for the onset of disease associated with these mutations. The type of familial TSE associated with extra copies of the PrP octapeptide repeat region is reminiscent of Huntington's disease. Onset of Huntington's disease is associated with the expansion of a polyglutamine repeat sequence in the huntingtin gene from the normal 10–34 copies to the disease-associated 37–100 copies (27Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group Cell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7074) Google Scholar). As in familial CJD, the greater the number of repeats, the earlier the disease onset; expansions of 70 and above are always associated with the juvenile form of Huntington's disease (28Davies S.W.

Recent studies with huntingtin protein have shown that as the number of glutamine repeats increases, so does the tendency of the huntingtin protein to aggregate and form amyloid fibrils similar to those observed in the TSE and Alzheimer's disease (28Davies S.W.

Our data are very similar in that increasing numbers of the octapeptide repeat region in PrP also appeared to increase the extent to which PrP aggregated. It is unknown, however, whether or not the mutant PrP-sen, in the absence of PrP-res, can form fibrils or intranuclear inclusions similar to those formed by the mutant huntingtin protein (28Davies S.W. Turmaine M. Cozens B.A. DiFiglia M. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Scherzinger E. Wanker E.E. Mangiarini L. Bates G.P.

Science. 1997; 277: 1990-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (2319) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which extra copies of the octapeptide repeat region influence aggregation of PrP is unclear. Other glycine-proline rich repeat regions are present in proteins such as wheat high molecular weight glutenin (31Sugiyama T. Rafalski A. Peterson D. Soll D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8729-8737Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), keratin, and type I collagen (32Marchuk D. McCrohon S. Fuchs E. Cell. 1984; 39: 491-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 33Piez K.A. Wetlaufer D.B. The Protein Folding Problem. Westview, Boulder, CO1984: 47-63Google Scholar), which aggregate or form filaments. The PrP octapeptide repeats might also be involved in PrP polymerization. One possibility is that the repeat region may act as a site which promotes either PrP self-aggregation or aggregation between PrP and other cellular factors (34Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the idea that PrP mutants with extra copies of the octapeptide repeat region could more efficiently form PrP-res spontaneously in vivo. The differences in aggregation of different PrP-sen molecules in our cells might also be influenced by overexpression of the protein. However, all of the fibroblast cells expressed similar levels of the constructs (Fig. 1 B), so overexpression cannot explain the increased aggregation of the mutant HaPrP-7, HaPrP-9, and HaPrP-11 proteins versus the normal HaPrP-5 protein within fibroblast cells. The same is true for the MNB cells. However, expression level could at least in part explain the higher levels of aggregation and PK resistance in fibroblast cells compared with MNB cells, since, in general, the fibroblast cells used here expressed higher levels of recombinant PrP protein (data not shown). In our studies in mouse fibroblast cells, there was a correlation between an increase in the number of octapeptide repeats, a decrease in expression of PrP-sen on the cell surface in a form accessible to PIPLC, and an increase in aggregation and protease-resistance. In other studies in CHO cells a mutant PrP molecule which was inaccessible to PIPLC demonstrated increased aggregation and protease resistance (14Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 15Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11604-11612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast, in our studies in MNB cells at least two different mutants (HaPrP-9 and HaPrP-11) were susceptible to PIPLC while still showing increased aggregation and PK-resistance. These findings suggest that, whereas increased aggregation and increased PK resistance correlate with increasing numbers of octapeptide repeats, sensitivity to PIPLC may be a consequence of cell type. The altered behavior of mutant PrP following PIPLC treatment in CHO cells suggests that mutant PrP molecules begin to acquire abnormal properties as early as the translocation of PrP into the endoplasmic reticulum (35Daude N. Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11604-11612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). While our data in mouse fibroblast cells is in agreement with this hypothesis, our data in mouse neuroblastoma cells is not. In neuroblastoma cells, mutant and wild-type PrP are similarly sensitive to PIPLC added to the extracellular medium (Fig. 2), but only mutant PrP molecules aggregate and are mildly PK-resistant. Therefore, in neuroblastoma cells, aggregation and PK-resistance may be acquired after translocation through the endoplasmic reticulum at a later step during biosynthesis than in CHO or fibroblast cells. This is in keeping with previous results in scrapie-infected mouse neuroblastoma cells, which demonstrated that protease-resistant PrP is made from mature PrP after it reaches the cell surface (9Borchelt D.R. Scott M. Taraboulos A. Stahl N. Prusiner S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 10Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18217-18223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inability of our mutants to spontaneously convert to PrP-res in a cell-free assay argues that the increases in aggregation and protease-resistance of PrP-sen detected in our analyses may not be sufficient to promote the spontaneous formation of PrP-res in familial TSE. Even when HaPrP-res was added to the cell-free assay system, mutant HaPrP molecules were not induced to convert to PrP-res any more efficiently than normal HaPrP (Fig. 5). The situation could be very different in vivo, however, where over the course of time the mutant PrP proteins may eventually potentiate the spontaneous formation of PrP-res. Another possibility is that abnormal PrP proteins could facilitate an early step in pathogenesis of familial TSE. For example, mutations in PrP could act as susceptibility factors which might eventually initiate disease in vivo when combined with other events such as aging, interactions with other molecules such as chaperones (36DebBurman S.K.

In connective tissue-type mast cells, the polysaccharide is stored intracellularly in granules. The mast cell polysaccharide is traditionally referred to as heparin but is composed of the same structural units as HS. HS has been implicated in cell adhesion processes, cytokine action, regulation of enzyme activities and in the maintenance of the permeability of basement membranes (reviewed in Refs. 1Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar, 2David G. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 3Lindahl U. Lidholt K. Spillman D. Kjellén L. Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 1-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The polysaccharide chain carries many negative charges that enables it to interact electrostatically with a wide variety of molecules. However, some of the interactions are highly specific (4Spillman D. Lindahl U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 677-682Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 5Couchman J.R. Woods A. J.

During biosynthesis, the HS-chains are polymerized by sequential addition of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine units. Concomitantly, the polymer is modified through a series of reactions that include N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of glucosamine residues, epimerization of glucuronic acid to iduronic acid, and finally O-sulfation at various positions (3Lindahl U. Lidholt K. Spillman D. Kjellén L. Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 1-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 6Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U.

The extent of these reactions varies, giving rise to enormous structural heterogeneity. Compared with HS, heparin is more highly sulfated and has a higher content of N-sulfated glucosamine and iduronic acid (3Lindahl U. Lidholt K. Spillman D. Kjellén L. Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 1-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The first modifying enzyme, a combinedN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase has a prime regulatory role in determining the overall structure and charge density of HS as N-deacetylation followed by N-sulfation are required for all subsequent modifications (1Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). Proteins, with features typical of Golgi proteins, expressingN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase activities have been purified and cloned from a mouse mastocytoma (8Pettersson I. Kusche M. Unger E.

Recently, the cDNA sequence of a human counterpart to the rat liver transcript (15Dixon J. Loftus S.T. Gladwin A.J. Scambler P.J. Wasmuth J.J. Dixon M.J. Genomics. 1995; 26: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) as well as the predicted structure of the corresponding gene was published (16Gladwin A.J. Dixon J. Loftus S.K. Wasmuth J.J.

The enzyme purified from the mouse mastocytoma is encoded by an ∼4-kb mRNA while the rat liver transcript contains ∼8 kb. The major part of the protein sequences have ∼70% identity. However, the most N-terminal 80 amino acids show a low level of structural homology, with approximately 30% identical amino acids. In addition, both the 5′ and the 3′ noncoding regions seem unrelated (9Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. Wei Z. Swiedler S.J. Ishihara M. J. Biol.

In this study, we demonstrate that the two transcripts are widely distributed in mouse tissues and that they are encoded by different genes. The structure of the gene encoding the 4-kb transcript is reported and shown to share many features with the previously characterized human gene for the 8-kb transcript. Isolated genomic DNA from adult mouse liver was digested with XbaI, HindIII,EcoRI, and BglII. Thirty-five μg of genomic DNA was used for each digest. The samples were fractionated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.9 m Tris, 0.9 m boric acid, 0.020 m EDTA. After electrophoresis, the gel was soaked in 0.4 m NaOH for 30 min before transfer to nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were hybridized overnight at 65 °C with32P-labeled probes in 5× SSC (SSC is 0.15 mNaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 7.0), 5× Denhardt's solution, 2% SDS containing 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and washed in 0.1× SSC, 0.5% SDS at 65 °C. Four different cDNA probes, labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products) in the random primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim), were used for hybridization. Probes A and C recognize the coding and 3′-untranslated region, respectively, of the 4-kb transcript, whereas probes B and D hybridize with the coding and 3′-untranslated region of the 8-kb transcript. Probe A is a HinfI cDNA fragment of the 4-kb mouse transcript (nt 1412–1900 in Fig. 1 of Ref. 10Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10438-10443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Probe B was generated by RT-PCR of rat liver RNA using the same conditions as described for the 504-bp PCR-product (10Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10438-10443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with a sense and an antisense primer corresponding to nt 1639–1660 and 2025–2004, respectively, in the rat liver cDNA-sequence (14Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15744-15750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To the 5′-end of the primers was added a dCCGAATTC extension to create anEcoRI site in the PCR-product. Probe C is a 356-bp cDNA-fragment, corresponding to the 3′noncoding end of the 4 kb mouse mastocytoma transcript (nt 2951–3307; Ref. 10Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10438-10443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Probe D is aHinfI fragment of the 504-bp PCR product generated by RT-PCR of rat liver RNA (10Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10438-10443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), corresponding to nt 3396–3679 in Ref. 14Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15744-15750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Hepatocytes were isolated after collagenase perfusion of a rat liver and purified by density gradient centrifugation in Percoll (17Smedsröd B. Pertoft H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1985; 38: 213-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from these cells and from mouse mastocytoma (18Furth J. Hagen P. Hirsch E.I. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1957; 95: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and mouse liver tissue using the LiCl/urea/SDS method (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A single filter containing poly(A)-selected RNA from several adult mouse tissues (CLONTECH) was hybridized at 65 °C in 5× SSPE (1× SSPE is 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), 10× Denhardt's solution, 2% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, at three occasions with probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products) as described above. The probes used were a 356-bp cDNA-fragment, identical to the 356-bp cDNA fragment (Probe C) used in Southern blotting (see above), a full-length cDNA corresponding to an mRNA encoding a protease specific for connective tissue-type mast cells, kindly provided by Dr. Lars Hellman, University of Uppsala (MMCP-4; Ref. 20Huang R.Y. Blom T. Hellman L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 1611-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and a 2-kb cDNA recognizing β-actin mRNA (CLONTECH). A similar filter was hybridized, as described above, to a 216-bp fragment that had been amplified from mouse liver RNA by RT-PCR using primers corresponding to nt 2103–2123 (sense) and nt 2318–2298 (antisense), respectively, in the nucleotide sequence of the 8 kb rat liver transcript, (14Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15744-15750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of the amplified product was established by nucleotide sequence analysis, using [α-35S]dATP and the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). An RT-PCR-based strategy was employed to clone the mouse homologue of the rat liverN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase. Primers were selected in regions corresponding to conserved sequences in the rat (14Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15744-15750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the human (15Dixon J. Loftus S.T. Gladwin A.J. Scambler P.J. Wasmuth J.J. Dixon M.J. Genomics. 1995; 26: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) transcripts. One pair of primers (1) corresponding to nt 1–18 (sense) and 1199–1182 (antisense), respectively, in the rat liver cDNA-sequence (14Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15744-15750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used to amplify the 5′ half of the cDNA. An overlapping clone extending to the 3′-untranslated region was obtained using two primers (2) corresponding to nt 1147–1163 (sense) and nt 2717–2700 (antisense), respectively, in Ref. 14Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15744-15750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Random hexamer primed cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of mouse liver total RNA using the GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer). The PCR reaction for primer pairs1 was performed under conditions of: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 1 min, 30 cycles each of 94 °C for 15 s, 50 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 2 min. The amplified 1199-bp fragment was subcloned into the pUC 119 vector and sequenced. Conditions used to amplify the second part of the cDNA using primer pairs 2 were: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 1 min, 35 cycles each of 94 °C for 20 s, 45 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 2 min plus 1 s for each cycle, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The amplified product (1571 bp) was subcloned into the pCR II vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The sequence identities between the mouse liver and rat liver 8-kb transcript are 96% for both the 1199 and 1571-bp fragments (EBI/GenBank™ accession numberAF049894). To obtain a full-length clone, a unique NdeI site at nt 1178 was used. The insert in the pCR II plasmid was excised withNdeI and EcoRI and ligated into the same site in the pUC vector containing the PCR product of primer pairs 1. The sequence around the NdeI site in the resulting full-length clone was verified by nucleotide sequence analysis as described above, using synthetic oligonucleotide primers. Sequences were analyzed with the aid of the Lasergene software package (DNAStar Inc., Madison). A mouse λFIX II genomic library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened using as probes a mixture of a 1.7-kb cDNA fragment (10Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10438-10443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), corresponding to a region entirely within the coding region of the 4-kb transcript, and “probe B” (see above), corresponding to 366 nt of the coding region of the rat 8-kb transcript. The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products) as described above. About 1× 106 plaques were screened, and approximately 60 clones were plaque purified. Of those, two different clones for the 4-kb transcript and 4 different clones for the 8-kb transcript were obtained. The genomic clones were further analyzed by restriction mapping and Southern blotting using as probes specific cDNA oligonucleotide primers (17 nt) that had previously been used for nucleotide sequence analysis of the mouse mastocytoma 4-kb cDNA (10Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10438-10443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic DNA fragments obtained from the phage DNA after digestion with SacI and/or BamHI were subcloned into the plasmid vector pUC 119 for characterization. The gene encoding the 4-kb transcript was further characterized, using other restriction fragments of the λ clones that were subcloned into pUC 119 and sequenced. The size of each intron was determined by nucleotide sequence analysis. One μg of total RNA from each tissue in a total volume of 20 μl was used for the generation of single-stranded cDNA in the GeneAmp RNA PCR kit. After dilution to 40 μl, 1 μl of each sample was used for PCR in a Rapidcycler (Idaho Technology), with Taq DNA polymerase (MBI-Fermenta) and TaqStart Antibody (CLONTECH). The sense primer corresponds to nt 1301–1317 in the sequence of the mouse mastocytoma 4-kb transcript (10Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10438-10443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), identical to nt 1593–1609 in the sequence of the rat liver 8-kb transcript (14Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G.

Also, the antisense primer corresponds to identical regions in the mouse 4-kb (nt 2299–2282; Ref. 10Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol.

The 10 μl reactions were done in heat-sealed glass capillaries in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.3, containing 3 mm MgCl2 and 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After an initial hold for 2 min at 95 °C, each cycle included denaturation at 95 °C for 0 s, annealing at 56 °C for 0 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. After 20, 25, or 30 cycles, the capillaries were emptied into Eppendorf tubes, and to the tubes were added 10 μl of “restriction enzyme mix, ” containing 4 units of EcoRI or HindIII, 50 ng of pUC 119, 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin in the appropriate restriction enzyme buffer (MBI-Fermenta). After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C and addition of 4 μl of sample dye, 20 μl of the samples were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gels. Samples subjected to 30 PCR cycles and subsequently incubated without any restriction enzyme were also analyzed. The plasmid vector pUC 119 served as a control of complete restriction enzyme cleavage, which was checked after ethidium bromide staining of the gel. After blotting to Hybond-N+, the nylon membrane was pre-hybridized at 42 °C for 30 min in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) and incubated in the same solution at 42 °C for 1 h with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide IE 16 (dAACTATGGAAATGACCG). This sequence is found in both transcripts from rat and mouse, and hybridizes with the intact rat and mouse 1-kb products as well as the 829-nt EcoRI and the 668-nt HindIII fragment generated from the 1-kb band corresponding to the rat and mouse 8-kb transcript, respectively. The membrane was finally washed with 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS twice for 10 min at 42 °C, before exposure to x-ray film. Southern blots of genomic DNA isolated from mouse liver was hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA-probes from the coding and from the 3′-untranslated regions of the 4-kb mouse and the 8-kb rat transcript, respectively (Fig. 1). While the coding regions of the 4-kb mouse and the 8-kb rat transcript are fairly similar (∼70% identity at the amino acid level), the untranslated regions are unrelated (9Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. Wei Z. Swiedler S.J. Ishihara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2270-2276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10438-10443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hybridization with mouse DNA of the probe corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region of the 8-kb rat transcript (Fig. 1 D) clearly demonstrates that also the mouse genome contains sequence information for this transcript. The cDNA probe corresponding to the coding region of the 8-kb transcript, hybridized to other genomic fragments (Fig.1 B), demonstrating the presence of restriction sites forXbaI, HindIII, EcoRI, andBglII in this gene. Notably, the hybridization pattern was distinct from that obtained with the probes corresponding to the 4-kb transcript (Fig. 1, A and C), indicating that the two transcripts are encoded by different genes. The expression of the 8-kb transcript in mouse liver was established using RT-PCR followed by nucleotide sequence analysis of the isolated clones. The nucleotide sequence of the coding region (GenBank™ accession number, AF049894) was highly homologous to that of the corresponding region in the rat 8-kb transcript (96% identity). On the protein level, only a few amino acids differed between the two species (Fig. 2). According to Northern blotting of different mouse tissues, the 8-kb transcript was widely distributed, with lung, liver, and kidney containing the highest amounts (Fig.3).Figure 3Distribution of the 8-kbN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase mRNA in adult mouse tissues. A mouse multiple tissue Northern blot was hybridized with a 216-bp 32P-labeled probe recognizing the coding region of the 8 kb transcript (A) and a 2-kb cDNA recognizing β-actin (B). The filter was washed at 50 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Sizes of RNA-markers in kilobases are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To isolate genomic clones containing theN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase genes, two cDNA probes corresponding to parts of the coding region of the mastocytoma and the rat liver cDNA transcripts, receptively (see “Experimental Procedures”), were mixed and used for screening of a 129/sv mouse genomic DNA library. Several positives clones were isolated and subsequently identified by Southern hybridization with cDNA fragments and oligonucleotides specific for the 4 and the 8-kb transcript, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures”). Two clones, 2:3 and 4:3 in Fig.4, were derived from the gene encoding the 4-kb transcript, but these clones did not cover the 5′-part of the gene. An ∼400-bp SacI fragment from the most 5′-terminal region of the 4:3 genomic clone was therefore used as a probe in another screening of the library. This approach yielded two more clones (8:2 and 10:1). Together with clones2:3 and 4:3, approximately 30 kb of genomic sequence were now covered (Fig. 4). Four of the clones identified in the initial screening were fragments of the gene encoding the 8 kb transcript. Characterization of these clones are in progress and will be reported in a separate communication. A crude map of the gene was constructed based on hybridization of restriction fragments with oligonucleotides, previously used as specific primers in nucleotide sequence analysis of cDNA corresponding to the mouse mastocytoma 4-kb transcript (10Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10438-10443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic fragments generated by digestion of the clones with SacI and/or BamHI were subcloned into pUC 119. The exon-intron organization and the size of exons and introns were determined by nucleotide sequence analyses of these fragments. The data available suggest that the mouse 4-kbN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase gene consists of 14 exons distributed within 8 kb of genomic DNA. However, it cannot be excluded that additional introns may exist in the extreme 5′- and 3′-ends of the gene. The exons contain between 88 and 1322 nucleotides, and all of the donor and acceptor splicing sites agree to the consensus sequences for eukaryotic genes (21Breatnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar). These data are summarized in Fig.4 and in Table I. Exon 1 contains part of the 5′-untranslated region, whereas the remainder of the 5′-untranslated sequence is located in exon 2, which contains the translation start site. This exon, which is much larger than any of the other exons, also encodes both the short N-terminal cytoplasmatic domain and the transmembrane part of the protein in addition to a large portion of the luminal domain of theN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase. While most of the intron junctions are of the 0 type (splicing occurs between codons), introns 3 and 8 are type 1 introns (where splicing occurs after the first base of the codon). Introns 9 and 12, finally, are of type 2 (splicing occurs after the second base of the codon).Table IExon-intron organization of the mouse 4-kb N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase geneExon numberExon size5′ Splice donorIntron length3′ Splice acceptorAmino acid interruptedbpbp1-aIntron sizes were determined by sequencing; “∼” indicates that portions of the introns were sequenced on one strand only. 1>2001-bThe size of exon 1 that contains 5′-untranslated regions was not determined since the 5′-boundary of this exon has not been localized.AGCCAAGgtatg428tacagATTGTAUTR1-cUTR, untranslated region. 21322T GTT GAGgtcag201tccagGCT TTG TTGluV EA L L 388CAT ACC Ggtgag∼269cacagGG ACA GAAGly H T GT E 4155T GCT TTGgtgag189cccagGAG CAT GGLeuA LE H G 5186C ATC ATGgtgag∼461ctcagGTG CTC CCMetI MV L P 6129T AAT CCGgtaag126tgcagATC AGT GTProN PI S V 7183G TGG CAGgtaag87ttcagAAT CCC TGGlnW QN P C 897AAG ACA Ggtaaa∼1306tgcagGC ACC ACGGly K T GT T 9124TC GAC TGgtgag∼121tctagG TAC ATGTrpI D WY M10175G TAC CAGgtgtg∼200tgcagCAC CAG CGlnY QH Q11171T GGA CAGgtacg∼88ttcagTTG CTG AGlnG QL L12110CC CTC AGgtggg147agtagG TTT GATArgT L RF D13103C ATG GAGgtaag100atcagTCT GCC TGluM ES D14∼614T GTG GGC-3′UTRV G1-a Intron sizes were determined by sequencing; “∼” indicates that portions of the introns were sequenced on one strand only.1-b The size of exon 1 that contains 5′-untranslated regions was not determined since the 5′-boundary of this exon has not been localized.1-c UTR, untranslated region. Open table in a new tab It has generally been assumed that the 4-kb transcript encodes the N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase involved in heparin biosynthesis and thus that this transcript is confined to mast cells. We previously noted a low expression of the 4-kb transcript in rat liver (10Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10438-10443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since mast cells in the liver capsule may have been the source of this transcript, we decided to look for the presence of the 4-kb transcript in purified hepatocytes using a PCR approach. In this method, a primer pair is used that will amplify a 1-kb band from cDNA generated by reverse transcription of either of the 4 or 8-kb transcripts 2The nucleotide sequence of the four different PCR products corresponding to the 4- and 8-kb transcripts in rat and mouse have been determined. A unique EcoRI site is found in the 1-kb band generated from the rat 8-kb transcript, whereas the mouse 8-kb mouse transcript contains a unique HindIII site. . (The nucleotide sequence of the 4- and 8-kb transcripts is identical in the regions where the primers anneal.) After the PCR, the 1-kb band is incubated with a restriction enzyme that cleaves the band derived from the 8-kb transcript but leaves the band generated from the 4-kb transcript intact. For RNA derived from rat tissues, EcoRI is used, while HindIII cleaves the 1-kb band generated from the mouse 8-kb transcript (See Fig. 5where exon 8 of the gene encoding the 4-kb transcript is compared with the corresponding exon in the mouse gene for the 8-kb transcript.). As shown in Fig. 6, most of the 1-kb PCR product obtained using rat hepatocyte cDNA as template is cleaved by EcoRI, but small amounts of the 4-kb transcript are present in these cells, represented by the weak intact 1-kb band (Fig.6 A). Mouse liver, in contrast, appears to contain similar amounts of the 4- and 8-kb transcripts (Fig. 6 B), and mouse mastocytoma contains almost exclusively the 4-kb transcript (Fig.6 C). Small amounts of the HindIII cleavage product, not evident in the figure, can be detected after additional PCR cycles (data not shown). In Fig. 6, the large difference in expression of N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase mRNA in mastocytoma and liver is also evident.Figure 6Expression of 4- and 8-kb transcripts in rat hepatocytes, mouse liver, and mouse mastocytoma. After reverse transcription of total RNA, PCR was performed with primers selected to give a 1-kb band when cDNA corresponding to both 4- and 8-kb transcripts from either murine or rat tissues was used as template (see “Experimental Procedures”). After 20, 25, and 30 cycles, the samples were incubated with EcoRI (rat hepatocyte samples) or HindIII (mouse mastocytoma and liver samples). This treatment selectively cleaves the 1-kb band corresponding to the 8-kb transcript. The enzyme-treated samples, uncleaved controls, and size markers were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose and subsequently blotted to nylon membrane. After hybridization with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide, recognizing intact mouse and rat 1-kb product as well as the 829-nt EcoRI and 668-nt HindIII fragments, the membrane was washed and exposed to x-ray film.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The distribution of the 4-kb transcript in different adult mouse tissues was also studied by Northern blotting using a probe specific for the 4-kb transcript (Fig.7 A). All tissues examined expressed the transcript, testis, liver, and kidney containing the highest amounts of the mRNA (Fig. 7 A). The distribution of an mRNA encoding a protease specific for connective tissue-type mast cells (MMCP-4; Ref. 20Huang R.Y. Blom T. Hellman L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 1611-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was different, skeletal muscle containing considerable amounts of the transcript while lower levels could be detected in heart, spleen, and lung (Fig. 7B). From these results, it can be concluded that expression of the 4-kbN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase transcript is not restricted to mast cells. Southern blotting of mouse genomic DNA (Fig. 1) showed that the two different N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase enzymes, encoded by the 4 and 8-kb transcript, respectively, originate from related but distinct genes. Nucleotide sequence analysis of cDNA corresponding to the 8 kb mRNA (Fig. 2), established that mice also express this transcript. The nucleotide sequence of the rat and human transcripts have previously been published (14Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15744-15750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Dixon J. Loftus S.T. Gladwin A.J. Scambler P.J. Wasmuth J.J. Dixon M.J. Genomics. 1995; 26: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The mouse protein is very similar to its rat counterpart with 99% identity on the protein level (Fig. 2). As demonstrated by Northern blotting, the 8-kb transcript is widely distributed and was detected in all tissues analyzed (Fig. 3). The gene encoding the human 8-kb transcript has previously been characterized (16Gladwin A.J. Dixon J. Loftus S.K. Wasmuth J.J. Dixon M.J. Genomics. 1996; 32: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Characterization of the mouse gene encoding the 4-kb transcript, which spans at least 7.4 kb and is split into 14 exons (Fig. 4), revealed a high resemblance between the two genes. The exons have the same size, except for exons 1, 2, and 14. In addition, the exon-intron phases from exon 2 and downstream are of the same type (eight type 0, two type 1 and two type 2 boundaries). The structural similarities between these genes strongly suggest that they have evolved from a common ancestral gene. However, some differences between the two genes may be noted. 1) The introns of the human gene encoding the 8-kb transcript are much larger (16Gladwin A.J. Dixon J. Loftus S.K. Wasmuth J.J. Dixon M.J. Genomics. 1996; 32: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This gene was estimated to span approximately 35 kb of genomic DNA. 2) In the murine gene encoding the 4-kb transcript, the initiation codon is found in the large exon 2, which contains 1005 nucleotides of coding sequence, while the corresponding region in the other gene (1008 nucleotides) is divided between the two first exons. 3In the partly characterized murine gene encoding the 8-kb transcript (Inger Eriksson, Marion Kusche Gullberg, Hanna Wlad, Rikard Pehrson, and Lena Kjellén, work in progress), exons 1 and 2 are organized in the same way as in the human counterpart. Also, the sequence of the splice donor site of intron 8 (GC instead of GT) is conserved (see Fig. 5). 3) In the human gene, the splice donor site of exon 8 is a GC rather than the expected GT.3 This rare variant was not found in the murine gene encoding the 4-kb transcript. 4) Exon 14 in the mouse gene has 123 nucleotides of coding region, whereas the corresponding exon in the human gene contains 117 nucleotides. While so far only two different genes encoding glucosaminylN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferases have been identified, we cannot exclude the presence of additional genes. It was previously suggested that the enzyme encoded by the 4-kb transcript, first recognized in mouse mastocytoma (8Pettersson I. Kusche M. Unger E. Wlad H. Nylund L. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8044-8049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was restricted to connective tissue mast cells and to the biosynthesis of heparin (9Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. Wei Z. Swiedler S.J. Ishihara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2270-2276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10438-10443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the tissue distribution of the 4-kbN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase mRNA reported in this paper (Figs. 6 and 7), demonstrates that this transcript is widely distributed and that it is present in cells other than mast cells. Accordingly, the enzyme encoded by the 4-kb transcript appears to take part both in heparin and heparan sulfate biosynthesis. The high level of expression of the 4-kb transcript in mastocytoma compared with its expression in e.g. liver (Fig. 6), may be the reason why this transcript was not previously recognized in other cells (9Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. Wei Z. Swiedler S.J. Ishihara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2270-2276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As indicated by overexpression of the enzymes in vitro (12Ishihara M. Guo Y. Wei Z. Yang Z. Swiedler S.J. Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20091-20095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Cheung W.-F. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5250-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the two enzymes may have different catalytic properties; transfection of cDNA corresponding to the 4-kb transcript in the human kidney cell-line 293 resulted in a dramatic increase in N-sulfation of the heparan sulfate produced by the cells (22Cheung W.-F. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5250-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), while overexpression in COS cells of cDNA for the 8-kb mRNA did not cause any significant change in the overallN-sulfation of the polysaccharide (12Ishihara M. Guo Y. Wei Z. Yang Z. Swiedler S.J. Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20091-20095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme encoded by the 4-kb transcript thus appears to participate in the production of HS with higher N-sulfate content. Tentatively, different locations of the 4- and 8-kb transcripts in a certain tissue may result in a local variation of HS structure. Such local variation of HS structure was recently reported for kidney, using a monoclonal antibody recognizing N-unsubstituted glucosamine residues, found in HS in the glomerular basement membrane but not in the basement membranes of the tubules (23van den Born J. Gunnarsson K. Bakker M.A.H. Kjellén L. Kusche-Gullberg M. Maccarana M. Berden J.H.M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31303-31309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These results imply that the fine structure of heparan sulfate may be carefully regulated. Expression of the 4- or 8-kb transcript may be one of the means for the cell to control the structure of the heparan sulfate produced, which in turn will be important for the ability of the proteoglycan for functionally important interactions with effector molecules such as cytokines, enzymes, and enzyme inhibitors (4Spillman D. Lindahl U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 677-682Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 6Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U.

https://openalex.org/W2059507019,"Establishment of dorsoventral polarity within the Drosophila embryo requires extraembryonic positional information generated during oogenesis. The genes windbeutel, pipe, and nudel are required within the somatic follicle cells of the ovary for production of this spatial cue. Using a novel follicle cell marker system, we have directly evaluated the effect of mutant follicle cell clones on the embryonic dorsoventral pattern. We find no spatially localized requirement for nudel activity. In contrast, windbeutel and pipe are required only within a restricted ventral region of the follicular epithelium. This ventral region can determine lateral embryonic cell fates nonautonomously, indicating that spatial information originating ventrally is subsequently refined, perhaps via diffusion, to yield the gradient of positional information that determines the embryonic dorsoventral pattern."

Many of the family members, including BCL-2 and BAX, have a putative transmembrane domain that anchors the proteins to intracellular membranes including mitochondrial, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear membranes (10Chen-Levy Z.

The BCL-2 gene encodes two proteins (26 and 22 kDa) that differ in their C termini as a result of alternative mRNA splicing mechanisms (13Tsujimoto Y. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5214-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 14Tanaka S. Saito K. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10920-10926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The smaller form, designated BCL-2-β which lacks the C terminus, lacks the transmembrane domain and thus represents a soluble form of BCL-2 (14Tanaka S. Saito K. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10920-10926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the BCL-2-α and BCL-2-β proteins enhance tumorigenicity of fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells (15Reed J.C. Cuddy M. Slabiak T. Croce C. Nowell P. Nature. 1988; 336: 259-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and both are able to malignantly transform rat embryo fibroblasts with theras oncogene (16Reed J.C. Haldar S. Croce C.M. Cuddy M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4370-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, BCL-2-β has been shown not to prolong cell survival nor suppress apoptosis (17Nguyen M. Branton P.E. Walton P.A. Oltavia Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16521-16524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although membrane attachment is not necessarily required for its protective effect (18Borner C. Martinou I. Mattmann C. Irmler M. Schaerer E. Martinou J.-C. Tschopp J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), the smaller form of BCL-2 does not possess all of the characteristics of the longer form. The BAX gene has also been shown to encode spliced variants (8Oltvai Z. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5853) Google Scholar). Four members of the BAX family have thus far been characterized including BAX-α that encodes for a 21-kDa protein; BAX-β that encodes for a 24-kDa protein lacking the C terminus due to a termination codon within the coding region of intron 5; BAX-γ, which is missing exon 2 resulting in a 4.5-kDa protein that prematurely terminates in exon 3 due to a translational frameshift; and BAX-δ (19Apte S.S. Mattei M.-G. Olsen B.R. Genomics. 1995; 26: 592-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) that is missing exon 3 but retains the same translational frame, the BH1 and BH2 domains, and the putative transmembrane domain. The function of these alternatively spliced variants is not yet known. In this paper, we report the cloning, biochemical characterization, and functional analysis of a novel splice isoform that we have called BAX-ω. BAX-ω has a structure distinct from BAX-α including the absence of a putative transmembrane domain. BAX-ω is found in every tissue tested. Overexpression of BAX-ω increases basal levels of cell death but does not appear to potentiate death by other inducers. Interestingly, mouse fibroblast L929 cells stably transfected withBAX-ω exhibit properties distinct from both wild-type and vector-transfected cells when induced to undergo apoptosis in that the cells appear to be more resistant to other inducers of cell death. These data suggest that the putative function of this alternatively spliced form of BAX is to induce apoptosis, but under conditions of constitutive overexpression, BAX-ω directly or indirectly protects the cells from apoptotic cell death. Both human BAX-α andBAX-ω were cloned from human hippocampal cDNA (CLONTECH) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT/PCR, reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HA, hemagglutinin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; RPA, ribonuclease protection analysis. in a volume of 50 μl using 1 μm forward (5′-GGAATTCGCGGTGATGGACGGGTCCGG) and reverse (3′-TCTGGAAGAAGATGGGCTGAG) primers, 200 μmdeoxynucleotide triphosphates, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 75 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 9.2 (Stratagene PCR Optimal Buffer 10) and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). The brain cDNA was amplified for 25 cycles as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min 20 s, annealing at 60 °C for 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1.5 min. Immediately following the last cycle, the mixture was heated to 94 °C for 1.5 min, 60 °C for 2 min, and 74 °C for 10 min. The resulting PCR product was end-filled with Klenow enzyme, blunt-ligated into theSmaI site of pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and sequenced starting from the 5′ end. To obtain the 3′ end of the BAX-ω gene it was necessary to use 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends technology. 3′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the exception of the 3′-primer which was as follows: 5′-CGCAGATCTGATCGATGTCGTCATTTTTTTTTTTTT. Amplification of the cDNA was for 25 cycles as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 65 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 40 s. The resulting product was subcloned into pCR3 using the TA-cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced. To determine whether the extra 49 bp contained withinBAX-ω was encoded by intron 5, intron 5 was cloned by PCR amplification from human genomic DNA in a volume of 50 μl containing 1 μm of each of the primers, 200 μmdeoxynucleotide triphosphates, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 75 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 9.2 (Stratagene PCR Optimal Buffer 10), and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). The 5′-primer was GAGCGGCTGTTGGGCTGGATCCAA, corresponding to sequence in exon 5, and the 3′-primer was the complement of TCTGGAAGAAGATGGGCTGAG, corresponding to sequence in exon 6. Amplification of the cDNA was for 30 cycles as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 65 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 45 s. The resulting product was subcloned into pCR3 using the TA-cloning kit (Invitrogen), and the construct was sequenced. For expression in monkey kidney E5 cells, BAX-ω was subcloned into the BamHI site of the plasmid, pα22βgalαGT (20Lawrence M.S. Ho D.Y. Sun G.H. Steinberg G. Sapolsky R.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 486-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A human frontal cortex-LambaZAP cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened (1 × 106 clones) with a probe corresponding to the first 452 nucleotides of BAX-α radiolabeled with 32P by random priming (Boehringer Mannheim). The screening used standard hybridization protocols (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) followed by washing in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Normal tissue was obtained from male Sprague-Dawley rats. Total RNA was isolated by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63087) Google Scholar), and first strand cDNA synthesis was accomplished in a volume of 2.5 μl containing 150 ng of total RNA, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (2 units; Boehringer Mannheim), and 1 μm complementary 3′-primer TCTGGAAGAAGATGGGCTGAGG (exon 6) at 42 °C for 30 min. Following first strand synthesis, 1 μm 5′-primer GAGCGGCTGTTGGGCTGGATCCAA (corresponding to sequence in exon 5), 200 μm dNTPs (dCTP was replaced with radiolabeled dCTP), and Taq DNA polymerase (10 units; Boehringer Mannheim) was added, and the reaction mix was heated to 95 °C for 3 min and amplified for 25 cycles with the following conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 63 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 40 s. The products were electrophoresed on a 5% polyacrylamide/urea gel, and the gel bands were analyzed with a PhosphorImage Scanner (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The RPA probe forBAX transcripts was prepared using the MAXIscript SP6 kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). The 400-bp BAX RNA probe was synthesized from a BamHI-linearized plasmid cDNA containing a 778-bp insert of human BAX cDNA in the vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and was radiolabeled with [α-32P]CTP that was included in the reaction mix. The control probe of 18 S rRNA was transcribed in vitrofrom an 18 S rRNA plasmid cDNA. The radiolabeled probes were purified on a 5% polyacrylamide urea gel. The full-length probes were cut from the gel and eluted overnight. RPA quantitation of BAX was performed using the RPA 11 kit (Ambion Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total human RNAs (20 μg) were hybridized with the radiolabeled BAX RNA and 18 S rRNA probes (as described above) and then digested with RNase A/RNase T1. The protected RNA fragments of BAX and 18 S rRNA were precipitated with ethanol and separated on a 5% polyacrylamide urea gel. Following gel electrophoresis, the protected fragments were visualized and quantitated using PhosphorImage scanning (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Normal brain, liver, lung, kidney, and heart tissues were obtained from male Sprague-Dawley rats. Approximately 2 g of each tissue were homogenized in 500 μl of ice-cold RIPA containing aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and leupeptin at 4 °C. Following homogenization, the tissue lysate was sonicated for 1 min and then incubated on ice for an additional 30 min. The protein lysate was centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resultant supernatant was subjected to the Bradford method of protein analysis (Bio-Rad). Following the Bradford analysis, equal amounts of protein were denatured by boiling for 10 min in RIPA containing 100 μm dithiothreitol, and the proteins were electrophoresed on a 12% polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE). Prestained molecular weight markers were run in parallel. The gel was electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room temperature. For immunoblot analysis of proteins, the membrane was blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk (milk solution) for 30 min followed by incubation with the primary antibody, NXrBAX-1, for 1 h in milk solution, washing, incubating with the secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled to peroxidase in milk solution for 1 h, washing and visualizing using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by autoradiography. For Western analysis of cultured cells, L929 cells, which were either transfected with vector alone or with BAX-ω, were grown to subconfluent levels, removed from a 10-cm tissue culture plate with Versene, and centrifuged for 5 min at 1500 rpm. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold RIPA containing aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and leupeptin and was nutated at 4 °C for 1 h. The protein lysate was centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resultant supernatant was subjected to the Bradford method of protein analysis (Bio-Rad). The samples were then processed essentially as above except for the use of P19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as the primary antibody. Mouse fibroblast L929 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone), referred to as complete medium, in an environment of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Exponentially growing cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells per 10-cm tissue culture plate (Falcon) in 10 ml of complete medium the day prior to transfection. The cells were electroporated in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 μg ofBAX-ω-pcDNA3 (twice purified by CsCl2) with 250 volts and a capacitance of 250 microfarads, grown for 2 days in growth medium, and then selected in G-418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Drug-resistant clones were transferred to 24-well dishes and grown to confluence with drug selection. E5 cells were transfected with pα22βgalBAX-ω, pα22βgalBAX-α and pα22βgalBCL-2 using LipofectAMINE essentially as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Exponentially growing L929 cells were seeded at 5–10 × 105 cells per 10-cm tissue culture plate (Falcon) in 10 ml of complete medium the day prior to the induction of cell death. Cell death was initiated by replacing the complete medium with Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 40 ng/ml TNF and 10 μg/ml cycloheximide. After various times, the cells were scraped from the plates, centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min, and resuspended in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% trypan blue. The cells were incubated in the trypan blue solution for 5 min, transferred to a hemacytometer, and the number of viable (phase bright) and nonviable (blue) cells were recorded. For each sample, five fields were counted. We and others (23Tartaglia L.A. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4303-4307Google Scholar) found >95% death by 20 h. Plasmids were constructed for coupled in vitro transcription/translation. HumanBAX-α was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) from the PCR product obtained from the human hippocampal cDNA (as described above). Human BCL-2 cDNA was obtained from human hippocampal cDNA using the following primers: 5′-ggaattcgcggtgatggacgggtccgg-3′ and 5′-ggaattctcagcccatcttcttccaga-3′, and the resultant product was subcloned into pcDNA3. A partial BAX-ω clone, obtained from the library screen (see above), was ligated intoPstI-digested pBluescriptSKII containing BAX-α, resulting in a complete clone. This full-length BAX-ω construct was then subcloned into EcoRI-digested pcDNA3. HA-truncated BAX-α (lacking the last 18 residues) and HA-BAX-ω were constructed into pcDNA3 by ligating aEcoRI/SalI or EcoRI, respectively, fragment containing the HA coding sequence in-frame with truncatedBAX-α or full-length BAX-ω from the yeast expression vector pAS2-tBAX-α or pAS2-BAX-ω into EcoRI/XhoI or EcoRI-digested pcDNA3. Truncated BAX-α was constructed into pAS2 (CLONTECH) by standard PCR reactions.BAX-ω was constructed into pAS2 by ligating theBamHI/SalI fragment from a partialBAX-ω clone obtained from the library screen (see above) into BamHI/SalI-digested pAS2. The coupled in vitro transcription and translation was performed with a commercially available kit (Promega). The35S-labeled proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-HA antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40) bound to protein A/G agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and washed three times with the same buffer containing 0.01% Nonidet P-40. The immunoprecipitated products were analyzed on 14% SDS gels. Gels were dried and exposed autoradiographically. Human hippocampal cDNA was used to screen for brain-specificBAX homologues using the technique of reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR). By using synthetic primers, we obtained three different splice variants of BAX, including the previously described (8Oltvai Z. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5853) Google Scholar) BAX-α andBAX-γ. Additionally, we obtained a novel splice variant that we have called BAX-ω. As shown in Fig.1, BAX-ω is identical toBAX-α through the region of the protein encoded by exon 5; at this point, BAX-ω is generated as a result of the splice donor site on exon 5 joined to a site 49 base pairs 5′ to theBAX-α acceptor site on exon 6 (Fig.2). We have confirmed that the extra 49-bp insert found in BAX-ω is derived from the 3′ end of intron 5 by sequencing a genomic clone of BAX (data not shown). The addition of 49 bp results in a translational frameshift and a protein distinct from BAX-α. In order to obtain the complete coding sequence for BAX-ω, it was necessary to use 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The complete coding sequence for BAX-ω is shown in Fig. 2. While BAX-α encodes a 21-kDa protein, the novel transcript predicts a larger 24-kDa protein. An interesting characteristic of this novel protein is that it contains no putative transmembrane domain, suggesting a cytosolic rather than membrane localization. BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains are almost entirely conserved, however.Figure 2Alternative splicing generates multiple forms of BAX. The black boxes in the upper portion of this figure represent the different exons that compriseBAX-α and BAX-ω that are translated into protein. The smaller hatched box is that part of exon 6 that is translated into protein for BAX-ω only as a result of the translational frameshift. The hatched larger boxesrepresent untranslated mRNA. The thin dark linesrepresent the introns of the gene, and the heavy dark linerepresents the portion of intron 5 retained by BAX-ω. The actual amino acids contained within each of the two proteins beginning with the BH2 domain are shown at the bottom of the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm that this new form of BAX is not a cloning artifact, a human frontal cortex library was screened with aBAX-ω probe. Seven independent clones were obtained and sequenced. Sequence analysis of the clones showed that three of the clones encode nucleotides 71–800 of BAX-ω, whereas the other four encode BAX-α (data not shown). The discovery of this novel isoform of BAX in human brain suggested that it may represent a brain-specific form of BAX. To address this question, we evaluated the expression of BAX-ω andBAX-α (and other possible splice variants) in a number of different tissues. Ribonuclease protection analysis was performed to evaluate the tissue distribution ofBAX-ω versus BAX-α. RNA from human brain, liver, heart, lung, and kidney were hybridized with an RNA probe synthesized from a cDNA clone containing a portion of theBAX-ω gene corresponding to nucleotides 300–600, which includes the unique 49-bp insert of BAX-ω. The resultant RNA probe was designed to recognize all of the known splice variants ofBAX. As shown in Fig. 3, we observed three main transcripts that correspond to the predicted sizes for BAX-α, BAX-β, and BAX-ω. Bgl II was used to digest the resultant bands to confirm their identity (data not shown). While BAX-α is the predominant transcript in human lung and kidney, both BAX-ω andBAX-β are expressed at levels comparable toBAX-α in human brain, liver, and heart. We also evaluated the levels of protein of the two forms of BAX, BAX-α and BAX-ω, in rat tissues. As shown in Fig.4, BAX-α and BAX-ω are expressed in all of the tissues examined including rat brain, heart, kidney, liver, and lung. Interestingly, the pattern of expression of the two proteins is quite distinct from one another. For example, BAX-ω is highly expressed in brain (upper panel, lane 1). BAX-α is highly expressed in lung (lower panel, lane 4), moderately expressed in brain and liver (lower panel, lanes 1 and2), and barely detectable in heart and kidney (lower panel, lanes 3 and 5). These results are consistent with those of Krajewski et al. (42Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Shabaik A. Miyashita T. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1323-1336PubMed Google Scholar). In brain and liver we see a doublet for BAX-ω. When this antibody is preadsorbed with peptide, the lower band disappears suggesting that the upper band represents either a post-translationally modified form of BAX-ω, possibly a phosphorylated form, or that the upper band represents a nonspecific cross-reacting antigen. If the latter is true, then BAX-ω protein is undetectable in heart, lung, and kidney by this method. This differential expression of BAX splice variants in different tissues suggested to us that the function of BAX-ω may have different relative importance from tissue to tissue depending on the expression of other BCL-2 family members in those tissues. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis was done to determine whether the translational product of BAX-ω interacts with other known members of the BCL-2 family of proteins. Full-length BAX-ω, BAX-α,BCL-2, and a hemagglutinin protein of human influenza virus (HA)-tagged form of full-length BAX-ω (HA-BAX-ω) and a HA-tagged form of truncatedBAX-α (lacking its transmembrane domain, HA-tBAX-α) were prepared by in vitrotranscription and co-translation and assayed for their ability to co-immunoprecipitate. Translation of HA-BAX-ω produces a major product that migrates slightly higher than the untagged protein (Fig. 5, lower panel, compare1st and 4th lanes). Lower molecular weight bands are also apparent, probably resulting from internal initiations at the first BAX-ω methionine and an internal methionine at amino acid residue 20. A similar pattern of one major product and several internal initiations is seen with the translation of HA-tBAX-α (Fig. 5, upper panel, 1st lane). Different combinations of the cDNAs were co-transcribed and co-translated using [35S]Met-labeled proteins and were incubated with an anti-HA antibody. The anti-HA antibody immunoprecipitated HA-BAX-ω and HA-tBAX-α (Fig. 5, 1st lane, both panels) but not BAX-ω, BAX-α, or BCL-2 (data not shown). When HA-tBAX-α or HA-BAX-ω was co-translated with BCL-2, the anti-HA antibody co-precipitated BCL-2 indicating the interaction of both HA-tBAX-α and HA-BAX-α with BCL-2 (Fig. 5, upper panel, 5th lane; lower panel, 5th lane). When HA-tBAX-α was co-translated withBAX-ω or when HA-BAX-ω was co-translated withBAX-α, the anti-HA antibody co-precipitated the BAX-ω in the case of HA-tBAX-α (Fig. 5, upper panel, 3rd lane) and BAX-α in the case of HA-BAX-ω (Fig. 5, lower panel, 1st lane) indicating an interaction of full-length and truncated BAX-α with BAX-ω. Dimerization of truncated BAX-α with full-length BAX-α was seen when HA-tBAX-α was co-translated with BAX-α and immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody (Fig. 5, upper, lane 1). Dimerization of BAX-ω with itself was more difficult to establish. The lower molecular weight bands that result from translation of the HA-tagged proteins appear to co-precipitate with the tagged proteins (Fig. 5, lower panel, 3rd lane). This could result from the cross-reactivity of the antibody with these proteins or, alternatively, from the interaction of these proteins with HA-tBAX-α and HA-BAX-ω. We favor the latter explanation since Western blotting analysis showed that the lower bands are not directly recognized by the anti-HA antibody (data not shown). Co-precipitation of these lower bands with the HA-tBAX-α and HA-BAX-ω suggests an interaction of HA-tBAX-α with tBAX-α and HA-BAX-ω with BAX-ω. The specificity of these interactions was confirmed by co-translation of HA-tBAX-α or HA-BAX-ω with SNAP-25 and immunoprecipitation with the anti-HA antibody. In these experiments, no interaction was observed between HA-tBAX-α or HA-BAX-ω with SNAP-25 (Fig. 5, upper panel, 7th lane; lower panel, 7th lane). As shown in Fig. 5 the lysates alone were run alongside the immunoprecipitations to validate the size of the protein being co-immunoprecipitated (upperand lower panels, 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th lanes). Expression of BAX-ω protein in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system and its subsequent interaction with BAX-α and BCL-2 proteins showed that the BAX-ω mRNA encodes for a functional protein. To evaluate its physiological function in vivo, we transfected BAX-ω into the mouse fibroblast cell line, L929, selected clones, and evaluated the expression level of the protein in the various clonal cell lines using Western blot analysis. An expression plasmid derived from pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was constructed placingBAX-ω under the control of the CMV promoter. The resultant pcDNA3-BAX-ω plasmid was stably transfected into the mouse fibroblast cell line, L929, by electroporation. Twenty four clonal cell lines were obtained, and 12 were evaluated by Western analysis for the expression levels of BAX-ω protein using the BAX-α antibody, BAX (P-19) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The translational product of BAX-ω migrated at approximately 28 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as shown in Fig.6. Two other bands are detected with this antibody that migrate at approximately 42 and 60 kDa. Although we do not know the nature of these bands, we can say that the 42-kDa band appears infrequently and randomly and, thus, appears to be nonspecific. The 60-kDa band is frequently seen but with a number of different antibodies, as well as with preimmune serum, suggesting that it too is a nonspecific band. Several of the transfected cell lines express BAX-ω protein (Fig. 6). Although all of the cells lines have detectable BAX-ω mRNA levels as shown by RT/PCR analysis (data not shown), some of the cell lines express no detectable levels of the protein using this antibody. One possibility for this difference is that the BAX-ω protein expressing cell lines express a more stable form of the protein. Another possibility is that the cellular milieu of some of the transfected cell lines is more amenable to the expression of or stability of BAX-ω protein (i.e.depending on where the gene inserts). To evaluate the function of BAX-ω, we evaluated its role in a model of apoptotic cell death, namely TNF-induced cell death. TheBAX-ω-transfected L929 cells were used to determine whether BAX-ω has an activity similar to or distinct from BAX-α. Vector-transfected L929 or BAX-ω-transfected cells were treated with TNF (40 ng/ml) and cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) for 12 h. Cell death was measured using the technique of trypan blue exclusion. As shown in Fig. 7, of the three cell lines tested, pcDNA3BAX-ω1, pcDNA3BAX-ω3, and pcDNA3BAX-ω8 all showed increased viability relative to the vector-transfected control. These data indicate that BAX-ω has a function opposite to that of BAX-α. To determine how long after treatment with 40 ng/ml TNF BAX-ω remained protective, a time course of treatment was done. As shown in Fig. 8, BAX-ω was protective up to 12 h following treatment. After 20 h, a majority of the cells died, probably because cycloheximide prevented the ongoing translation of all proteins. These data suggest that constitutive overexpression of BAX-ω protects L929 cells from TNF-induced cell death.Figure 8Time course of TNF-induced cell death in L929 and BAX-ω-transfected L929 cells. Vector-transfected L929 cells and three BAX-ω overexpressing clonal cell lines were exposed to 40 ng/ml TNF with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for 4.5, 6.5, 12, and 20 h in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following incubation, the cells were"

The receptor is envisaged to form a large extracellular domain (ECD) (polypeptide M r 45,000 plus carbohydrate), a seven-transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail. It is closely related to the receptors for the other glycoprotein hormones (follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and chorionic gonadotrophin) but has two unique insertions of 8 and 50 amino acids (residue numbers 38–45 and 317–366) in the ECD. It is generally assumed that the ECD is solely responsible for ligand interaction and that the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions are involved in signal transduction. However, we showed that the recombinant ECD expressed in isolation as a soluble 60,000M r glycoprotein was recognized by autoimmune antibodies but did not bind to TSH with high affinity (8Harfst E. Johnstone A.P. Nussey S.S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 9: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting that additional components may play a role in ligand interaction. This conclusion is supported by data from other groups (9Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2525-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10Vlase H. Matsuoka N. Graves P.N. Magnusson R.P. Davies T.F.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Evidence for the extracellular loops between the transmembrane regions making an important contribution to TSH binding has been provided by experiments in which mutations or insertions in the first or second extracellular loops resulted in a receptor that was unable to bind TSH (12Kosugi S. Mori T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13Haraguchi K. Saito T. Endo T. Onaya T.

Res. 1995; 27: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Conversely, the recombinant ECD expressed on the cell surface, in an ill-defined way by virtue of an 11-amino acid tail derived from a cloning vector, was able to bind TSH with similar affinity to full-length receptor (15Shi Y. Zou M. Parhar R.S. Farid N.R. Thyroid. 1993; 3: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and the isolated recombinant ECD is reported to bind TSH, although less effectively than the full-length molecule (16Chazenbalk G.D. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1543-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 17Seetharamaiah G.S. Kurosky A. Desai R.K. Dallas J.S. Prabhakar B.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Studies on the ECD are hampered by the fact that, when expressed alone in eukaryotic cells, the recombinant protein is retained within the cell rather than being secreted as expected (8Harfst E. Johnstone A.P. Nussey S.S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 9: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 9Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2525-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have managed to facilitate secretion of ECD material by fusing it to the “hinge” region of rat CD8 or to domains 3 and 4 of rat CD4 (18Johnstone A.P. Cridland J.C. DaCosta C.R. Harfst E. Shepherd P.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 105: R1-R9Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and truncated versions of the ECD (down to 261 residues) are secreted (19Chazenbalk G.D. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18959-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar); however, although these modified ECD are recognized by at least some autoantibodies, they do not bind TSH with high affinity, the same situation as for the ECD retained inside cells. ECD expressed alone in prokaryotes or baculovirus is insoluble and without function (8Harfst E. Johnstone A.P. Nussey S.S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 9: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,20Takai O. Desai R.K. Seetharamaiah G.S. Jones C.A. Allaway G.P. Akazizu T. Kohn L.D. Prabhakar B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In order to address more clearly the issue of the minimal structural requirements for TSH binding, we have expressed the ECD in isolation on the cell surface in a defined way by means of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor and report here characterization of the recombinant product, including binding of TSH and autoantibodies. Polymerase chain reaction was used to add sequences directing attachment of a GPI anchor to the ECD at residue 412, Ile, which is just prior to the first predicted transmembrane sequence of the TSHR. The template used was a construct encoding domains 3 and 4 of rat CD4 attached to the C terminus of the human ECD (18Johnstone A.P. Cridland J.C. DaCosta C.R. Harfst E. Shepherd P.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 105: R1-R9Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Domain 3 possesses some amino acids that are acceptable for GPI attachment. These were used together with artificially created sequences to direct a signal for GPI anchoring. The primers used were an 18-base sequence corresponding to nucleotide positions 973–990 of the human TSHR cDNA (sense) 5′-ATCAGAGGAATCCTTGAG-3′ and a 55-base sequence containing a signal for GPI attachment, a stop codon, and an artificial BamHI site for subsequent cloning (antisense) 5′-GAGGATCCTAGACGAGCACGAGCAGGAGCAGAAGGATGAGTAGGAAGAAGAACTC-3′. The nucleotide and corresponding amino acid sequence for the added material is shown in Fig. 1, the double underlined serine residue serving as the putative attachment site. The polymerase chain reaction consisted of 30 cycles (95 °C 1 min; 60 °C 2 min; 72 °C 1 min) and produced a fragment encompassing nucleotides 973–1332 of the TSHR (including a NdeI site at position 1265) plus the anchor sequence. The coding region for the extracellular region of the human TSHR has been cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-3X (8Harfst E. Johnstone A.P. Nussey S.S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 9: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This was digested withEcoRI, the overhang filled in with Klenow, further digested with NdeI, and the NdeI-digested polymerase chain reaction fragment was ligated into this. The BamHI fragment containing the ECD plus GPI anchor signal was then excised, ligated into the eukaryotic expression vector pEE14, and the product transfected into CHO-K1 cells, as described (26Harfst E. Johnstone A.P. Gout I. Taylor A.H. Waterfield M.D. Nussey S.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 83: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), to generate stable lines, which were selected by their resistance to methionine sulfoximine and by using slot blotting to identify colonies with a large number of copies of plasmid incorporated into genomic DNA. The sequence of the construct used for transfection was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing using a commercial kit (Pharmacia Ltd.). CHO lines expressing full-length TSHR (designated “FLD4” and “FLE4.2”) and isolated ECD (designated “ExG2”) have been described previously (8Harfst E. Johnstone A.P. Nussey S.S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 9: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Harfst E. Johnstone A.P. Gout I. Taylor A.H. Waterfield M.D. Nussey S.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 83: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An enriched membrane fraction of recombinant CHO cells was prepared as described (27Perret J. Ludgate M. Libert F. Gerard C. Dumont J.E. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 1044-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) using freeze/thaw and hypotonic homogenization. Samples were sonicated at 100 watts on ice for 3 × 10 s and then heated at 100 °C for 5 min in SDS-PAGE loading buffer (65 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.001% bromphenol blue). SDS-PAGE was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206271) Google Scholar). Western transfer onto nitrocellulose (Electran, 0.45 μm; BDH, Poole, United Kingdom) was as described (29Towbin H. Gordon J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 72: 313-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was carried out using monoclonal antibodies to TSHR (18Johnstone A.P. Cridland J.C. DaCosta C.R. Harfst E. Shepherd P.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 105: R1-R9Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and the Boehringer Mannheim chemiluminescence blotting substrate kit. Confluent cells were removed from 9-cm dishes using Versene (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, UK) and washed in PBS. An aliquot (2 × 106 cells) was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min, resuspended in 100 μl of 1% (v/v) Triton X-114 in PBS containing protease inhibitors (2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin), incubated on ice for 10 min and then at 30 °C for 5 min. The sample was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min to enhance phase separation. An equal volume of 2 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added to the aqueous (containing soluble proteins) and detergent phase (containing membrane proteins) and the samples analyzed by immunoblotting. Cells were removed from 9-cm dishes using Versene, washed in PBS and solubilized in 200 μl of 1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS containing protease inhibitors (2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 1 min on ice, insoluble material being removed by centrifugation at 13,000 g for 5 min. One quarter of the supernatant (equivalent to 2 × 105 cells) was analyzed by immunoblotting to check for recovery of protein in the Nonidet P-40 extracts. The remaining supernatant was split into two aliquots (equivalent to 3 × 105 cells) and diluted with an equal volume of 0.1% SDS in PBS, so that the final Nonidet P-40 and SDS concentrations were 0.5 and 0.05%, respectively. To one aliquot was added 10 milliunits of N-glycosidase F (Boehringer) and both aliquots were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h and the resultant digest analyzed by immunoblotting. Cells were removed from 9-cm dishes using Versene and their reaction with an anti-TSHR monoclonal antibody analyzed by flow cytofluorimetry as described (18Johnstone A.P. Cridland J.C. DaCosta C.R. Harfst E. Shepherd P.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 105: R1-R9Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For experiments investigating the susceptibility of the recombinant protein to enzymes, the cells were detached from four dishes, washed twice with PBS, and the pellet from each dish (approximately 5–6 × 106 cells) resuspended by the addition of 100 μl of PBS containing 0.5 unit of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC), 1 unit of thrombin, 0.125% trypsin, or no enzyme; all samples except for the trypsin one also contained 2% fetal calf serum. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the cells were washed with PBS and reacted with an anti-TSHR monoclonal antibody in the normal way for analysis by flow cytofluorimetry. Cells grown in 24-well plates (approximately 105/well) were washed twice with binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and unlabeled TSH or human sera added. Radioiodinated TSH (a kind gift of BRAHMS Diagnostica, Berlin, Germany) was added at approximately 30,000 cpm/well. The final volume was 300 μl and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The cells were then washed rapidly with 500 μl of ice-cold binding buffer, solubilized in 500 μl of 0.5 m NaOH, and their radioactivity determined. Nonspecific binding, determined in the presence of 150 nm TSH, was subtracted from all counts. For binding experiments involving membrane preparations, 40–100 μg of membrane protein was used for each point and incubated with regular mixing in tubes, as described above for cells. The membranes were then isolated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer, and the radioactivity associated with the pellets measured as described above. For comparison between different membrane preparations or different experiments, the counts were corrected for membrane protein content as measured in the final NaOH solution using the method of Lowry (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (5–6 × 106) were washed twice with PBS and incubated in serum-free, methionine-free, HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN Flow, Thame, UK) at 37 °C for 30 min. The culture supernatants were then replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum and 100 μCi of [35S]methionine or [3H]ethanolamine (Amersham, Bucks, UK) at 37 °C for 3 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and solubilized on ice with PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The cell extract was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the Nonidet P-40-soluble material stored at −20 °C until analyzed by immunoprecipitation (8Harfst E. Johnstone A.P. Nussey S.S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 9: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For experiments involving PIPLC and thrombin, cells were labeled as described above and then washed twice with PBS. The cells (approximately 5–6 × 106) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 1 ml of PBS, 2% bovine serum albumin containing 0.5 unit of PIPLC, 1 unit of thrombin, or no enzyme. The supernatants were then removed and the cells extracted with Nonidet P-40 as described above; the supernatants and the Nonidet P-40 extracts were analyzed by immunoprecipitation. Following transfection of CHO cells with the GPI construct in the pEE14 vector, successful transfectants were identified and selected by their resistance to methionine sulfoximine; further screening of these stable lines by means of slot blotting DNA identified one clone with the highest copy number of TSHR sequences, which was designated “GPIA6.” Western blotting of crude extracts from GPIA6, as well as other clones with lower copy number, using monoclonal antibodies detected a band of approximately 70,000 M rexpressed at high levels, approximately 10,000 larger than the isolated ECD (Fig. 2 A, tracks 1 and3). Digestion with N-glycosidase F decreased theM r by approximately 10,000 (Fig. 2 A, track 4); a similar decrease in M r was also observed for isolated ECD in ExG2 extracts (Fig. 2 A, track 2). N-Glycosidase F does not remove the entire carbohydrate moiety, unlike endoglycosidase F which was used in an earlier study (31Harfst E. Ross M.S. Nussey S.S. Johnstone A.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 102: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) where an M r of 15,000 was attributed to carbohydrate on the ECD of ExG2 cells. Approximately 50% of the recombinant material partitioned into the detergent phase in Triton X-114-treated cells (Fig. 2 B, tracks 3 and4), indicating that it was membrane bound; in contrast, the vast majority of the ECD construct in ExG2 cells partitioned into the aqueous phase (Fig. 2 B, tracks 1 and 2), indicating that it was not membrane bound, as expected (8Harfst E. Johnstone A.P. Nussey S.S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 9: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In confirmation of this, approximately 30% of TSHR material was released in soluble form after freeze/thawing and homogenization of GPIA6 cells (Fig. 2 C, tracks 4–6) compared with greater than 90% released from ExG2 cells (Fig. 2 C, tracks 1–3). Analysis of GPIA6 cells using flow cytofluorimetry showed that TSHR material was present on the cell surface (Fig.3). Using several different monoclonal antibodies, the fluorescence signal was 3–10-fold higher for GPIA6 cells than for cells expressing the full-length receptor (FLE4.2), indicating a substantial increase in surface expression for the GPI-anchored molecule. Immunoprecipitation of detergent-solubilized GPIA6 cells, which had been biosynthetically radiolabeled with methionine, demonstrated that the GPI-anchored material was recognized by autoantibodies in sera from several patients with Graves' disease (Fig.4 A), which also react with the recombinant isolated ECD in ExG2 cells as reported previously (8Harfst E. Johnstone A.P. Nussey S.S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 9: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The TSHR material from GPIA6 cells, but not from ExG2 cells, also incorporated radiolabeled ethanolamine (Fig. 4 B), as expected for a GPI-anchored protein. In confirmation of the GPI-anchored structure, incubation of GPIA6 cells with PIPLC decreased the fluorescence signal in flow cytofluorimetry by approximately 70%, whereas this treatment had no effect (or caused a slight increase) on the full-length molecule in FLE4.2 cells (Table I). Similarly, thrombin decreased the fluorescence signal by approximately 50% for GPIA6 cells but had much less effect on FLE4.2 cells, presumably cutting at the thrombin site engineered into the GPI construct just before the GPI attachment signal sequence (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1). Analysis by immunoprecipitation of the soluble and membrane-bound TSHR content from similar digests of biosynthetically labeled cells demonstrated release of soluble ECD from GPIA6 cells by PIPLC or thrombin treatment (Fig.5).Table ISusceptibility of recombinant GPI-anchored TSHR to cleavage by thrombin or PIPLCAdditionGPIA6 cellsFLE4.2 cellsMean fluorescence intensityDecrease in fluorescenceMean fluorescence intensityDecrease in fluorescence%%None54.40.031.90.0PIPLC16.766.0 ± 1.736.9−10.0 ± 3.0Thrombin30.148.9 ± 3.326.220.4 ± 1.6Trypsin0.897.6 ± 1.42.795.0 ± 2.0 Open table in a new tab Intact GPIA6 cells bound 125I-labeled TSH, with a maximum approximately 3-fold higher than that of FLE4.2 cells, which express the full-length receptor (Fig.6 A). When plotted as a percentage of maximum binding, the curves from the two cell lines are very similar (Fig. 6 B), indicating that the two recombinant molecules have a similar affinity for TSH; Scatchard analyses of the data from seven independent experiments gave K D values of 0.209 ± 0.042 nm for GPIA6 cells and 0.281 ± 0.032 nm for FLD4 cells (mean ± S.E.). Membranes prepared from GPIA6 cells also bound 125I-labeled TSH (Fig. 7); in contrast, those from ExG2 cells (which have soluble ECD that does not bind TSH) were negative and those from FLE4.2 and FLD4 cells (which express less receptors than GPIA6) were negative or slightly positive.Figure 7Radioligand binding analysis of GPI-anchored TSHR in membranes. In two separate experiments (A andB) membranes from recombinant CHO lines expressing full-length TSHR (FLE4.2 and FLD4), ECD alone (ExG2), or GPI-anchored ECD (GPIA6) were incubated with radioiodinated TSH in the absence (cross-hatched bars) or presence (solid bars) of 150 nm unlabeled TSH. The amount of radioactivity bound to the membranes was determined and is presented relative to the protein content of each sample.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The ability of autoantibodies in the sera of Graves' disease patients to inhibit the binding of 125I-labeled TSH to intact cells was then investigated (Fig. 8). While most of the sera that inhibited binding to full-length receptors also inhibited binding to the GPI-anchored molecules, there were clear differences in the amount of this inhibition. Thus serum from patients S361, H804, H254, H291, S235, and H569 inhibited binding to the GPI-anchored molecules significantly less than to the full-length receptors, whereas serum from patient S342 or S778 was more inhibitory on the GPI-anchored material. A GPI anchor consists of phosphatidylinositol (inserted in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane), a glycan core, and an ethanolamine covalently attached to the C-terminal residue of the protein. No clear consensus sequence exists for directing such anchoring but there are some general requirements for creating a synthetic anchor sequence: (i) a hydrophobic region at the C terminus of the molecule (10–20 amino acids) not followed by a cluster of basic residues; (ii) a “spacer domain” of 7–10 residues preceding the hydrophobic region; (iii) small amino acids after the spacer region, where cleavage of the precursor and attachment of the anchor occurs (32Coyne K.E. Crisci A. Lublin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6689-6693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GPI anchor is preassembled and added to nascent proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (33Bangs J.D. Hereld D. Krakow J.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3207-3211Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 34Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Concomitant with this step, the initial C-terminal peptide is removed so that the GPI anchor is covalently attached to a new C-terminal amino acid on the protein (35Boothroyd J.C. Paynter C.A. Cross G.A. Bernards A. Borst P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 4735-4743Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). By introducing sequences conforming to these general rules (Fig.1), we have directed the attachment of a GPI anchor to the end of the TSHR ECD. This is demonstrated by the biosynthetic labeling of the material with ethanolamine (Fig. 4 B) and susceptibility to release from membranes by PIPLC (Fig. 5 and Table I). This achievement allowed studies on the structural requirements of the TSHR for binding TSH, and also demonstrates the general utility of this approach for expressing other proteins with simple membrane anchors. In addition to the membrane anchored form, a significant amount of recombinant material was present in a soluble, non-membrane bound form (Fig. 2, B and C), presumably retained inside the endoplasmic reticulum. There is no obvious explanation for this. It is possible that the engineered thrombin site is susceptible to partial spontaneous cleavage, as noted for other recombinant molecules containing this site (36Classon B.J. Brown M.H. Garnett D. Somoza C. Barclay A.N. Willis A.C. Williams A.F. Int. Immunol. 1992; 4: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), or that an endogenous PIPLC cleaved within the GPI anchor (37Bangs J.D. Andrews N.W. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); alternatively, the soluble form could be a partially processed product before addition of the GPI anchor. There is a slight difference in M r of the two forms, the soluble appearing slightly larger (Fig. 2, B andC); a GPI anchor contributes 1500 to theM r of a polypeptide on SDS-PAGE but such small changes to larger glycosylated proteins are not easily observed (34Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The GPI-anchored material was expressed at much higher levels than the full-length receptor, as demonstrated by its ease of detection using immunoblotting (Fig. 2) and radioligand binding to crude membranes (Fig. 7), neither of which techniques detect full-length molecules in our hands. The GPI-anchored material was present on the cell surface in significantly greater amounts than the full-length receptor (3–10-fold), as demonstrated by flow cytofluorimetric analyses (Fig.3) and radioligand binding to whole cells (Fig. 6 A). This observation supports our earlier conclusion (38Harfst E. Johnstone A.P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 207: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) that the similar, limited expression of full-length recombinant molecules in mammalian cells reported by several groups using different expression systems is related to the number of receptor molecules (with a bulky seven-transmembrane region) that a cell can tolerate without impairing its viability, a simpler membrane attachment allows increased cell-surface capacity. However, an increase of this magnitude is unlikely to be sufficient to account for the increased signals observed on immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and radioligand binding to membranes. Consequently, we think that the available data indicate that, in addition to the recombinant material expressed on the cell surface, a substantial amount is retained inside the cell, probably in the endoplasmic reticulum, in a membrane-bound form as well as the soluble form discussed above. The recombinant material from GPIA6 cells was consistently observed as two bands in immunoprecipitation analyses; using immunoblotting only one band was detected, corresponding to the upper band in immunoprecipitation (Figs. 2, 4, and 5). Both bands were also biosynthetically labeled by [3H]ethanolamine (Fig.4 B), suggesting that they both contained a GPI anchor. Presumably, the lower band is a minor component (and hence not easily detectable by immunoblotting) which is synthesized efficiently but which is then degraded or metabolized further thus preventing its accumulation. The K D of our full-length receptor for TSH was calculated in an earlier study to be 0.225 nm (26Harfst E. Johnstone A.P. Gout I. Taylor A.H. Waterfield M.D. Nussey S.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 83: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which is in good agreement with the values determined for the native receptor on thyroid membranes and also with similar full-length recombinant preparations of other groups. In this study, we again obtained a similar K D value for the full-length receptor and, furthermore, observed that the GPI-anchored material bound TSH with a very similar high affinity (Fig. 6). This is in contrast to the ECD alone which does not bind TSH with high affinity (8Harfst E. Johnstone A.P. Nussey S.S. J. Mol.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Neither of these truncated recombinant molecules contains the extracellular loops and so these cannot be required for TSH binding. It is possible that membrane insertion assists correct folding of the ECD, thus allowing complete formation of the TSH-binding site; this would be in agreement with one earlier report (15Shi Y. Zou M. Parhar R.S. Farid N.R. Thyroid. 1993; 3: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the isolated ECD is folded well enough to be recognized by autoantibodies, which do not react with linear epitopes (39Libert F. Ludgate M. Dinsart C. Vassart G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 73: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). There is no obvious difference in the carbohydrate content of the ECD alone compared with GPI-anchored ECD (Fig. 2) that can be postulated to explain the difference in TSH binding, although we cannot rule out a subtle difference in carbohydrate structure. The GPI-anchored ECD contains none of the TSHR regions that are predicted to lie within the membrane or cytoplasm. Consequently, this recombinant construct would not be expected to couple to second messenger systems and, in support of this, we found that TSH did not induce cAMP production (data not shown). Autoantibodies in the sera of some Graves' disease patients recognize the GPI-anchored material, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation (Fig.4) and by their inhibition of TSH binding (Fig. 8). However, there was no direct correlation between the two techniques and not every serum that inhibited TSH binding was positive in immunoprecipitation (e.g. patient H804), possibly reflecting a requirement for antibodies of higher affinity in order to be detectable by immunoprecipitation, because of its stringent washes. Significant differences were noted in the amount of inhibition by individual sera between the GPI-anchored and full-length material (Fig.8). As an example, it is notable that serum from patient S235 which reacted well with the GPI-anchored material by immunoprecipitation only inhibited TSH binding to that same material by about 25%, in contrast to its 90% inhibition of full-length material. It should be noted that all sera probably contain more than one autoantibody; if some of these react with the extracellular loops, this might explain the greater amount of TSH-binding inhibition of these sera with the full-length construct. This conclusion is somewhat at odds with the data from one other study (19Chazenbalk G.D. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18959-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) which found that a truncated version of the ECD of only 261 residues neutralized the majority of autoantibodies from all patients. There is no obvious explanation for the converse situation where a serum inhibits the GPI-anchored material more than the full-length (e.g. patients S342 and S778). The recombinant GPI-anchored TSHR reported here represents the smallest known fragment of TSHR that has retained high-affinity TSH binding. The high expression of this material by stable recombinant cell lines coupled with its susceptibility to PIPLC allows the production of functional material in both membrane-bound and soluble form. Such material will undoubtedly be useful in defining the structure-function relationships of this important molecule, a task which has proved to be surprisingly arduous. We are grateful to Dr. Guy Whitley and Dr. Stephen Nussey, both of St. George's Hospital Medical School, and Dr. Philip Shepherd, of United Medical and Dental Schools London, for helpful discussions. We thank BRAHMS Diagnostica, Berlin, for the kind gift of radiolabeled TSH."

Tyrosine-phosphorylated (Tyr(P)) insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 are found in the uterus of mice treated with estradiol. Immunoprecipitates of uterine Tyr(P) IRS-1 contained both p85, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, and PI 3-kinase catalytic activity. Estradiol also stimulated binding of IRS-1 and PI 3-kinase to the IGF-1R. Depletion of IRS-1 from uterine extracts reduced PI 3-kinase associated with the receptor, which suggests that binding of the enzyme to IGF-1R occurs primarily in a complex that also contains IRS-1. Following treatment with estradiol, formation of Tyr(P) IGF-1R, Tyr(P) IRS-1, and the p85·IRS-1 complex was very weak in the uterus of IGF-1m/m mice, which are severely deficient in IGF-1. This indicated that most, if not all, of the estradiol-stimulated Tyr phosphorylation of uterine IRS-1 originates from ligand activation of IGF-1R kinase. IRS-2 was also Tyr-phosphorylated in the normal uterus and bound more IGF-1R and p85 in response to estradiol; however, a marked decrease in levels of uterine IRS-2 occurred 12–24 h after treatment with estradiol. Since IRS-2 was present in IGF-1R precipitates and a recombinant form of IGF-1 (long R3IGF-1) stimulated formation of Tyr(P) IRS-2, hormonal activation of this docking protein probably occurs through the IGF-1R. In summary, our findings show that estrogen activation of uterine IGF-1R kinase results in enhanced binding of p85 (PI 3-kinase) to IRS-1 and IRS-2. The formation of one or both of these complexes may be important for the potent mitogenic action of this steroid. That estradiol stimulated a decrease of IRS-2, but not of IRS-1, suggests that these docking proteins have different roles in hormone-induced signaling in the uterus.

That estradiol stimulated a decrease of IRS-2, but not of IRS-1, suggests that these docking proteins have different roles in hormone-induced signaling in the uterus. Estradiol exerts potent effects on gene expression and cell proliferation in the uterus. Several earlier studies indicated that local growth factor pathways may be important for the mitogenic action of estradiol (reviewed in Refs. 1Murphy L.J. Ghahary A.

In addition, estradiol-enhanced uterine epithelial DNA synthesis was significantly decreased in castrated mice overexpressing rat IGF-binding protein-1 in the uterine epithelium, as compared with that for wild-type mice, providing evidence that IGF-1 is an important effector of estradiol-induced DNA synthesis in this tissue (10Rajkumar K. Dheen T. Krsek M. Murphy L.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The IGF-1R is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein consisting of two extracellular α-subunits and two transmembrane β-subunits linked by disulfide bonds (reviewed in Ref. 11LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to the α-subunit activates the tyrosine kinase of the β-subunit, resulting in autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of cellular substrates. A key component of several signaling intermediates is the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain that binds tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in a sequence-specific manner (12Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). In vitro binding studies (13Seely B.L. Reichart D.R. Staubs P.A. Jhun B.H. Hsu D. Maegawa H. Milarski K.L.

The membrane was blocked with either Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% bovine albumin or PBS, 3% nonfat dry milk and probed with the appropriate antibodies. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence. Supernatants of uterine homogenates from estradiol- or vehicle-treated mice were incubated with anti-IRS-1 (C terminus) antibody or nonspecific IgG. Following adsorption of immune complexes to protein A-Sepharose, immunoprecipitation supernatants were precipitated again with anti-IRS-1 antibody or nonspecific IgG. After the second round of anti-IRS-1 antibody or nonspecific IgG immunoprecipitation, resulting supernatants were precipitated with anti-IGF-1R antibody. All immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blot analysis, and additional IGF-1R precipitates were evaluated for PI 3-kinase activity as described below. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to an in vitro PI 3-kinase assay as described previously (19Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. Cheatham B. Jachna B.R. Glasheen E.M. Backer J.M. White M.F.

The precipitates obtained 6 h after treatment of mice with estradiol or vehicle were washed successively with 1% Triton X-100, 100 μm Na3VO4 in PBS (three times); 500 mm LiCl, 100 μmNa3VO4 in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (three times); and 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm Na3VO4 in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5 (two times). The pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and combined with 10 μl of 10 mmMgCl2 and 10 μl of PI (4 μg/μl) sonicated with 1 mm EGTA in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The phosphorylation reaction was started by adding 10 μl of 440 μm ATP containing 300 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 10 min at 22 °C with constant shaking on a Eppendorf thermomixer, the reaction was stopped with 20 μl of 8 n HCl and 160 μl of CHCl3:methanol (1:1). After centrifugation, the lower organic phase was recovered and, along with the PI-4-monophosphate standard, applied to a silica gel TLC plate. TLC plates were developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (99:78:18:5.3), dried, and visualized by autoradiography.32P incorporation into PI-3-monophosphate was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). IRS-1 is a major substrate of the IGF-1R tyrosine kinase (19Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. Cheatham B. Jachna B.R. Glasheen E.M. Backer J.M. White M.F.

Since estradiol induces coordinated phosphorylation of the IGF-1R β-subunit and IRS-1 in the uterus (4Richards R.G. DiAugustine R.P. Petrusz P. Clark G.C. Sebastian J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12002-12007Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we examined whether this steroid hormone stimulates the formation of a complex containing both the IGF-1R and IRS-1. Immunoblot analysis of IGF-1R (β-subunit) precipitates from uterine extracts obtained 6 h after estradiol treatment showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation at 110 and 170 kDa; a 185-kDa Tyr(P) protein was evident by 12 h after hormone treatment (Fig. 1 A). The tyrosine-phosphorylated 110-kDa protein was also present at 12 h after estradiol treatment, whereas phosphorylation of the 170- and 185-kDa proteins was still evident at 72 h after estrogen exposure (Fig. 1 A). Immunoblot analysis of the IGF-1R precipitates revealed that the 110- and 170-kDa Tyr(P) proteins correspond to the IGF-1R (β-subunit) and IRS-1, respectively (Fig. 1 A). The identity of the 185-kDa Tyr(P) protein that coprecipitated with the IGF-1R β-subunit has not been determined. At each time period examined, there was no apparent change in IGF-1R protein levels following treatment with estradiol (Fig. 1 A). As previously reported (4Richards R.G. DiAugustine R.P. Petrusz P. Clark G.C. Sebastian J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12002-12007Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), tyrosine phosphorylation of uterine IRS-1 increased by 6 h following estradiol treatment (Fig.1 B). When compared with IRS-1 from extracts of control mice (0 h), the Tyr(P) content of this docking protein was still enhanced at 72 h after estrogen exposure (Fig. 1 B). IRS-1 from extracts of control mice displayed a mobility of 160 kDa but shifted to 170 kDa by 6 h after estrogen treatment; by 48 h, the migration of IRS-1 was similar to that observed in control (0 h) samples (Fig. 1 B). IRS-1 protein levels were comparable throughout the time period investigated (Fig. 1 B). The apparent formation of an IGF-1R·IRS-1 complex suggests that IRS-1 is a substrate for this receptor; however, since various receptors have the potential to tyrosine-phosphorylate IRS-1 (21Argetsinger L.S.

Therefore, the hormone-induced change in Tyr(P) content of IGF-1R and IRS-1 in uterine extracts from IGF-1m/m mice was compared with that of wild-type mice. Following estrogen exposure, the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the uterine IGF-1R (Fig.2 A) and IRS-1 (Fig.2 B) of IGF-1m/m mice was much less than that of wild-type mice. Although estradiol-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was negligible in the IGF-1m/m mutants, the IRS-1 immunoreactive band exhibited the same hormone-dependent decrease in gel mobility observed with that in wild types (Fig.2 B). The IGF-1R (Fig. 2 A) and IRS-1 (Fig.2 B) protein levels in uteri from either vehicle- or estradiol-treated animals were comparable in mutant and wild-type mice. The uterine weights of ovariectomized wild-type and mutant mice both increased about 2-fold 6 h after treatment with hormone. When uterine sections from both groups were evaluated by light microscopy, no gross difference in histology was observed. To identify SH2 domain-containing proteins that associate with the IGF-1R and IRS-1 as a result of estrogen action, uterine extracts were examined by immunoprecipitation for possible interactions between either the IGF-1R or IRS-1 and various SH2-containing proteins. IGF-1R- and IRS-1-associated p85 was detected in control (0 h) samples, and binding of p85 to both the IGF-1R (Fig.3 A) and IRS-1 (Fig.3 B) increased by 6 h after estrogen exposure. This enhanced association of p85 with the IGF-1R and IRS-1 was still evident at 72 h after treatment with estradiol. Additionally, p85 precipitates obtained from mice 6 h after treatment with estradiol contained enhanced IRS-1 immunoreactivity as compared with that of vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 3 C). There was no apparent increased interaction of Grb-2 or Syp with the IGF-1R or IRS-1 following treatment (6 h) of mice with estradiol (Fig.4 A); Grb-10 did not associate with the uterine IGF-1R from mice treated with vehicle or estradiol (data not shown). The estrogen-enhanced binding of p85 and apparent lack of interaction of Grb-2 and Syp with IRS-1 were confirmed with anti-IRS-1 antibodies derived against two different regions of the molecule, the extreme C terminus region (Figs. 3, A andB, and 4 A) and an N terminus region containing the pleckstrin homology domain (data not shown).Figure 4Grb-2 and Syp do not associate with the uterine IGF-1R and IRS-1 following estradiol exposure. Tissue extracts were prepared from CD-1 castrates 6 h after treatment with 1 μg of estradiol (E) or vehicle (C).Panel A, immunoprecipitates (IP) of the IGF-1R and IRS-1 as well as supernatants of uterine extracts (Ext) were separated by SDS-15% PAGE and immunoblotted with antibody to Grb-2 or Syp.

https://openalex.org/W2318492342,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is one of the major causes of cancer mortality in the industrialized world, having among the poorest prognosis of any malignancy. Mutations or alterations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene/protein are observed in 50–70% of these cancers, yet little information is available regarding the phenotypic effects of restoration of wild-type (wt) p53 function in pancreatic ductal carcinoma cells. The consequences of stable reintroduction of wt p53 on apoptosis and differentiation was examined in a poorly differentiated pancreatic carcinoma cell line (Panc-1), possessing only mutant (mt) p53 (codon 273 mutation). Cells were transfected with a temperature-sensitive mouse p53val135 (tsp53) vector under additional control of a genetically-modified metallothionein promoter. This tsp53 has a `mt' phenotype at 37.5°C, and a `wt' phenotype at 32.5°C and the presence of 100 μM ZnCl2. Stable expression of wt p53 caused upregulation of the p21/WAF1 gene, and G1 growth arrest as shown by flow cytometry and BrdU labeling. Additionally, apoptosis was induced 8–12 post-induction in the majority of the cells (60–70%), as demonstrated by morphological changes, in situ TdT labeling and internucleosomal laddering. However, a subpopulation (30%) of the transfectants survived this apoptotic fate. Unlike the epithelial parental Panc-1 cells, these cells exhibited the appearance of a neuroendocrine-like phenotype with extensive branch-like processes, and marked cytoplasmic and cytoskeletal immunostaining for tau-2, synaptophysin, and chromogranin A. These studies suggest that stable and regulated expression of wt p53 can have multiple phenotypic consequences (apoptosis and altered differentiation to a neuroendocrine-like phenotype) in poorly-differentiated pancreatic carcinoma cells."

https://openalex.org/W2323074194,"The heterodimeric Ku protein, which comprises a 86 kDa (Ku86) amd a 70 kDa (Ku70) subunits, is an abundant nuclear DNA-binding protein which binds in vitro to DNA termini without sequence specificity. Ku is the DNA-targeting component of the large catalytic sub-unit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase complex (DNA-PKCS), that plays a critical role in mammalian double-strand break repair and lymphoid V(D)J recombination. By using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrated that in addition to the major KuDNA complex usually detected in cell line extracts, a second complex with faster electrophoretic mobility was observed in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) extracts. The presence of this faster migrating complex was restricted to B cells among the circulating lymphocyte population. Western blot analysis revealed that B cells express a variant form of the Ku86 protein with an apparent molecular weight of 69 kDa, and not the 86 kDa- full-length protein. Although the heterodimer Ku70/variant-Ku86 binds to DNA-ends, this altered form of the Ku heterodimer has a decreased ability to recruit the catalytic component of the complex, DNA-PKCS, which contributes to an absence of detectable DNA-PK activity in B cells. These data provide a molecular basis for the increased sensitivity of B cells to ionizing radiation and identify a new mechanism of regulation of DNA-PK activity that operates in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2314781188,"The Oligodendrocyte-Myelin glycoprotein gene (OMgp) is placed within an intron of the NF1 gene. Neurofibromin, the product of NF1, acts as a RasGAP and suppresses growth; inactivating mutations in NF1 lead to neurofibromatosis type 1. We report that OMgp also has growth suppressive effects and downregulates mitogenic signaling pathways closely related to those influenced by neurofibromin. Overexpression of OMgp alters mitogenic signaling in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Cells overexpressing OMgp grow more slowly in serum compared to controls and show a partial G1 block upon cell cycle analysis. PDGF is the primary mitogen for fibroblasts in serum. Overexpression of OMgp alters PDGF signaling in fibroblasts which results in a block of mitogenic signaling. PDGF induced activation of c-Src is blocked, as is the induction of c-Myc and c-Fos, while tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFβ receptor, PLCγ1 and induction of c-Jun are intact. Although a number of genes embedded within other genes have been described, the biological significance of this arrangement remains unknown. We demonstrate here that structurally unrelated products of two such genes may exercise closely related functions. Our data also raise the possibility of a role for OMgp in disorders of cell proliferation such as NF1."
https://openalex.org/W2052058024,"Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive leukaemia cells express the chimeric bcr/abl oncoprotein, whose deregulated protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity antagonizes the induction of apoptosis by DNA damaging agents. Treatment of Ph-positive K562, TOM 1 and KCL-22 cells with etoposide for 2d induced cytosolic vacuolation, but not nuclear condensation or DNA fragmentation. The bcr/abl kinase-selective inhibitor herbimycin A increased the induction of nuclear apoptosis by etoposide or gamma-radiation. The concentration of herbimycin required to synergize with etoposide was similar to that required to decrease the level of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins or of the protein tyrosine kinase activity of anti-abl immune complexes in K562 cells. The ability of herbimycin A to sensitize K562, TOM 1 or KCL-22 cells to apoptosis induction correlated with its ability to decrease the cellular content of phosphotyrosyl proteins in these Philadelphia-positive lines. Enhancement of nuclear apoptosis by herbimycin was not attributable to downregulation of the bcl-2 or bcl-XL anti-apoptotic proteins. In contrast, herbimycin protected Philadelphia-negative HL60 cells from apoptosis induction by etoposide and did not affect killing of NC37 and CEM cells. The data suggest that the induction of apoptosis is blocked in cells expressing the bcr/abl oncoprotein and that herbimycin A increases induction of programmed cell death following DNA damage. Selective PTK inhibitors may therefore be of value in securing the genetic death of Ph-positive leukaemia cells."
https://openalex.org/W2331346458,"A detailed long range restriction map of the region defined by markers D6S149 and D6S193 on chromosome 6q27 has been constructed. This was achieved by YAC cloning and contig assembling of the same region. Seven YAC clones were found to span the almost 1000 Kb region flanked by the two markers which on the genetic map resulted to be 1.9 cM apart. With some of the characterized YAC clones we undertook a molecular cytogenetic analysis of 20 benign ovarian tumors. The rationale for this was the recent mapping to a region of chromosome 6q27, flanked by markers D6281 and D6S133, of a locus for the SV40-mediated immortalization of human cells (SEN6 gene). Noteworthy we found that the the D6S149-D6S193 region (comprised in the larger D6S281-D6S133 physical interval) was altered in all samples analysed adding support to the occurrence of a immortalization step in this type of tumors."

It is important to know the involvement of PARP in development for understanding biological functions of PARP in vivo.

TheDrosophila genomic library EMBL-3 SP6/T7 (CLONTECH) was screened using a 0.4-kb cDNA fragment from nt +2254 to +2627 (the nt +1 corresponds to the first nucleotide of translation initiation codon of D. PARP cDNA (7Uchida K. Hanai S. Ishikawa K. Ozawa Y. Uchida M. Sugimura T. Miwa M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3481-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)) and pD-5′, a 1.3-kb EcoRI-XbaI fragment (nt +117 to +1078 of cDNA) as probes. A full-length cDNA was also used to screen cosmid libraries (Promega, Madison, WI). Recombinants grown on agar plates were transferred onto two replica filters of nitrocellulose. Filter lifts were hybridized with probes under standard conditions (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and exposed to a x-ray film. Cosmid and phage clones were subjected to mapping of restriction sites with complete restriction digestion and partial digestion using cosmid mapping kit (Takara, Kyoto, Japan). Overlapping of clones were confirmed by hybridizing each other. Restriction fragments of phage clones containing exons were subcloned into pBluescript II KS− (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the deletion plasmids were prepared. Sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method using a sequencing kit (Life Technologies, Inc.; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequences were analyzed by MACMOLLY-TETRA (Soft Gene GmbH, Berlin, Germany) and GCG (Genome Computer Group Inc., Madison, WI). The genomic DNA from adult flies of a wild type, Canton S, was extracted by a standard method as described (32Ashburner M. Drosophila: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 106-107Google Scholar). Ten μg of DNA digested by restriction enzymes were separated on a 0.8% agarose gel, then transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). A full-length cDNA for D. PARP labeled with [α-32P]dCTP was hybridized and analyzed with a Fujix BAS 2000 imaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). A fragment amplified by polymerase chain reaction, which corresponds to exons 2 and 3 (from nt +169 to +562 of cDNA), was also used as a probe. Chromosomein situ hybridization was carried out as described (33Engels W.R. Preston C.R. Thompson P. Eggleston W.B. Focus. 1986; 8: 6-8Google Scholar) using biotinylated probes. To identify the 5′-end of transcript of D. PARP, two μg of poly(A)+ RNA prepared from Canton S embryos was subjected to 5′ RACE using 5′ AmpliFINDER RACE kit (CLONTECH). The reaction was performed according to manufacturer's protocol. Primer Exon-2R (5′-AGCTGGGACGCTGGTTTTTA-3′) and Exon-1R (5′-TTGAACCATGACAGCAATCCGAAGAGTATC-3′) were used. The products were subcloned into pCR II (CLONTECH), and the nucleotide sequence was determined as described above. The plasmids pSK-CAT, pSV2-CAT with poly linker of pBluescript, and pAc-CAT, pSK-CAT with Drosophilaactin 5C promoter (kind gifts from Dr. A. Matsukage, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute) were used. pEx1-1k-CAT contains aKpnI-DraI fragment upstream of exon 1 (nt from −8 to −1, 234, +1 corresponds to the first nucleotide of the initiation codon in exon 1 and the first base upstream of +1 is defined as −1) in pSK-CAT. pEx1-2k-CAT has a ∼2-kbXbaI-DraI fragment upstream of exon 1. KC cells, a Drosophila embryonic cell line, was kindly provided by Dr. R. Ueda (Mitsubishi Kasei Institute of Life Sciences). The cells were transfected with 15 μg of the CAT plasmids and 5 μg of the β-galactosidase plasmid (pRSV-β-gal, a kind gift from Dr. S. Ishii, RIKEN) according to the method described by Chen and Okayama (34Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4793) Google Scholar). After 48-h incubation, cells were collected, and the cell lysates were prepared. After centrifugation, the supernatant was used for the following assay. The cell extract was incubated at 37 °C for 5 h in the reaction mixture containing 0.25 μCi ofd-threo-[dichloroacetyl-1-14C]chloramphenicol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 1 mm acetyl-CoA. This mixture was extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was transferred to another tube and evaporated under vacuum. The residual was dissolved in 30 μl of ethyl acetate, spotted on a silica gel (Art. 5748, plastic sheets silica gel 60, Merck), and developed in a thin-layer chromatography chamber containing chloroform:methanol (19:1, v/v). The silica gel was exposed to a imaging plate for 30 min, and the CAT activities were measured with a Fujix BAS 2000 imaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film). To standardize the CAT activity, the efficiency of transfection was determined by a β-galactosidase assay as described (36Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Total RNA from Canton S was isolated as described (37Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62851) Google Scholar). Embryos collected at each 2 or 3 h AEL were incubated at 25 °C. A probe of about 1-kb EcoRI fragment from D. PARP cDNA (from nt +2008 to +2965) was used. Hybridization was performed under standard conditions (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The blot was also probed with a 5′-radiolabeled oligonucleotide, rp49–3′; 5′-TTGAATCCGGTGGGCAGCAT-3′ from nt +699 to +680 of ribosomal protein 49, rp49 (X00848) (38O'Connell P.O. Rosbash M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5495-5513Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Autoradiographs of blots were analyzed with a Fujix BAS 2000 imaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film). Whole mountin situ hybridization of Drosophila embryos was performed according to the procedure described by Tautz and Pfeifle (39Tautz D. Pfeifle C. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1989; 98: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). The single-stranded DNA probes prepared from D. PARP cDNA by polymerase chain reaction using a single primer were labeled using random prime DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). EMBL-3 SP6/T7 phage library was screened using probes of partial cDNAs forD. PARP (7Uchida K. Hanai S. Ishikawa K. Ozawa Y. Uchida M. Sugimura T. Miwa M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3481-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and 12 clones covering all the coding regions were obtained. To isolate overlapping clones, the pWE15 cosmid library was screened. Using a full-length cDNA as a probe, 25 clones were isolated from 1 × 106 recombinants. DNA fragments containing the coding region were subcloned, and the nucleotide sequences of the coding regions, including the exon-intron boundaries, were determined (Table I). The exon-intron boundaries had splicing sites that were located at positions corresponding to amino acids 38, 86, 197, 375, and 565 ofDrosophila PARP. The organization of the D. PARPgene is shown in Fig. 1. The DNA-binding domain is encoded by exons 1, 2, 3, and 4. The first zinc finger was encoded by exons 1 and 2, and the second zinc finger is included within exon 3. Exon 4 contains a nuclear localization signal (40Uchida K. Morita T. Sato T. Ogura T. Yamashita R. Noguchi S. Suzuki H. Nyunoya H. Miwa M. Sugimura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The auto-modification domain was encoded by exon 5, and the catalytic domain was in exon 6, with a part in exon 5.Table IExon-intron organization of D.

Conserved nucleotides for donor and acceptor in introns are underlined. Open table in a new tab Compositions of exon-intron boundaries in Drosophila and human PARP genes were compared. Although the zinc finger of several zinc finger proteins is coded in a single exon, the first zinc finger of human PARP is split by an intron (43Auer B. Nagl U. Herzog H. Schneider R. Schweiger M. DNA (N. Y.). 1989; 8: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This split site was conserved between Drosophila and human PARPgenes. Exon 2 of the Drosophila gene encodes a half of the first zinc finger and corresponds to exon 2 of the humanPARP gene. Drosophila exon 3 corresponds to exons 3 and 4 of the human gene. Drosophila exon 4 contains exons 5–8 of the human gene, and exon 5 corresponds to exons 9–12 of the human gene, and exon 6 corresponds to exons 13–23 of the human gene. We mapped the restriction enzyme sites (EcoRI,PstI, and XhoI) of the D. PARP gene using overlapping cosmid clones. Fig. 2(lanes 1–5) shows Southern blotting using a full-length cDNA for PARP as a probes. The size of bands detected inEcoRI, PstI, and XhoI digests corresponded to the expected size from the restriction map (Fig. 1). When the same blot was re-hybridized to exon 2 plus 3 specific probe, a single band was detected at the expected sizes in each lane (Fig. 2,lanes 6–10). The D. PARP gene was localized cytologically to the right arm of the third chromosome (3R) at position of 81F by in situ polytene chromosome hybridization (data not shown). We determined the sequence of the putative 5′ promoter and regulatory region to 1280 bp upstream of the translation initiation start codon. We also isolated the full extent of 5′ portion of D. PARP cDNA by 5′ RACE to identify the transcriptional initiation site. Nucleotide sequences of the 5′ RACE fragments that have been subcloned into plasmids were determined (data not shown). Three out of 10 clones examined were completely identical. The 5′-end of these full-extended clones, adenine nucleotide at −76 (+1 corresponds to the first nucleotide of the initiation codon in exon 1, and the first base upstream of +1 is defined as −1) from translation start codon (Fig.3), suggested that the potential transcriptional initiation site in Drosophila PARP was 76 bp upstream from the translation initiation site. The other seven clones contained smaller fragments of the 5′ portion of cDNA, possibly due to incomplete reverse transcription. As shown in Fig.4 B, the 5′-flanking sequence of D. PARP had transcriptional activity in aDrosophila embryonic cell line, KC cells. pEx1-1k-CAT, which contains a 1-kb fragment upstream of exon 1, showed almost the same activity as pEx1-2k-CAT, which contain a 2-kb fragment upstream of exon 1. A putative transcription initiation site, TATA and CCAAT boxes, and putative binding sites for representative transcription factors (TF) were identified (Fig. 3). A typical TATA box was found at −119. CCAAT boxes were found at −132, −455, and −788. The CCAAT box at −788 matched to one of CP1 sites. Two sequence motifs, at −455 and −132, were matched to conserved CCAAT box sequences that were found in histone H2B genes in various species (44Wells D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: r119-r149Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Putative binding sites for CP2 and C/EBP were found. Two CP2-binding sequences were found at −808 and +48. Consensus sequences for C/EBP binding site (45Johnson P.F. Landschulz W.H. Graves B.J. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) were at −331 and −169. The octamer motif was at −502. Zeste-, aDrosophila TF that activates Ubx transcription (46Biggin M.D. Tjian R. Trends Genet. 1989; 5: 377-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), binding sites were located at −1160 and −845. Binding sites of H4TF-1, which was identified as a TF for human histone H4 promoter (47Dailey L. Hanly S.M. Roeder R.G. Heintz N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7241-7245Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), were found at −967, −869, −576, and −128. Binding sites of HiNF-A, which also binds to human histone H4 promoter (48van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1679-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), were located at −1122, −1114, −1094, −986, −876, −583, −506, and −81.Figure 4Promoter activity of the 5′ region of theD.

The PARP mRNA gave a 3.2-kb band, except in the larval stages (Fig. 5 A, lane 9and 10). Changes of the PARP mRNA level during development, standardized by rp49, are shown in Fig.5 B. PARP expression was at a high level in embryos 0–2 h AEL (Fig. 5 B, lane 1) and decreased to 20% at 6–8 h (lane 4), later showing a slight increase at 8–10 h (lane 5). In these stages, a minor band of 2.6 kb was observed in addition to a major 3.2-kb band of PARPmRNA. A cDNA clone, which lacks the auto-modification domain by alternative splicing of exon 5, was isolated. 2T. Kawamura, S. Hanai, M. Uchida, M. Miwa, and K. Uchida, unpublished data. A smaller mRNA corresponds to this alternative form of PARP. The amount of PARPmRNA in pupae (lane 11) was about 20%, and in adults (lane 12) 30%, of 0–2-h embryo levels. Spatial distribution of the mRNA during embryogenesis is shown in Fig. 6. PARP mRNA was distributed uniformly over the cleavage and blastodermal embryos (Fig.6, A and B), but was indiscernible in pole cells, the germ line progenitor, of the cellular blastodermal embryos (data not shown). Later during embryogenesis, the mRNA was distributed in almost all cells of the embryos. A large amount of PARPmRNA accumulated in an unidentified cell type dispersed around the central nervous system at stage 14–15 (Fig. 6 D) and in the cells forming the anal plate of stage 16 embryos (data not shown). During oogenesis, PARP mRNA was detectable in the nurse cells of the early stage 10 egg chambers and accumulated in the oocytes of the egg chambers at stage 11–12 (Fig. 6 H). We isolated overlapping cosmid clones covering almost the entirePARP gene. The PARP gene spanned more than 60 kb in length and was composed of six coding exons separated by five introns. The human PARP gene has 23 exons and is 43 kb in length (43Auer B. Nagl U. Herzog H. Schneider R. Schweiger M. DNA (N. Y.). 1989; 8: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, the auto-modification domain was encoded in a single exon, and the catalytic domain is almost all encoded by exon 6. Thus, organization of exons of the D. PARP gene seems to correspond to its functional domains. The size of bands in genomic Southern blot analysis using a full-length cDNA and exon-specific probes was explained by the expected size from cosmid mapping. These results indicate that D. PARP gene is a single copy per haploid genome. The D. PARP gene was mapped to 81F of third chromosome. This locus is nearby centromeric heterochromatin regions of chromosome III. The regulatory region of the D. PARP gene showed transcriptional activity in KC cells. The promoter region of theD. PARP gene has a TATA box and three CCAAT boxes and an octamer motif, while mammalian PARP genes have no typical TATA boxes, but have GC-rich sequences (49Ogura T. Nyunoya H. Takahashi-Masutani M. Miwa M. Sugimura T. Esumi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 50Potvin F. Thibodeau J. Kirkland J.B. Dandenault B. Duchaine C. Poirier G.G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Putative AP-1 binding sites were found in the D. PARP promoter, and induction ofPARP expression by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment has been reported in mammalian cells (51Yokoyama Y. Kawamoto T. Mitsuuchi Y. Kurosaki T. Toda K. Ushiro H. Terashima M. Sumimoto H. Kuribayashi I. Yamamoto Y. Maeda T. Ikeda H. Sagara Y. Shizuta Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, D. PARP gene expression did not increase by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment of KC cells (data not shown). Expression of PARP mRNA was at a high level in early embryos and distributed uniformly in the embryos, except for pole cells. Accumulation of PARP mRNA in oocytes and in embryos immediately after oviposition indicates that PARP mRNA in early embryos might be of maternal origin. PARP is abundant in nuclei of mammalian cells and its mRNA increases at the S phase of cell cycle (52Menegazzi M. Gerosa F. Tommasi M. Uchida K. Miwa M. Sugimura T. Suzuki H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 995-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is speculated that PARP may be involved in nuclear or cell division in the early embryo. A slight increase in the amount of PARP mRNA in embryos at 8–19 h AEL (Fig. 5) is possibly due to zygotic expression of the PARP gene.PARP mRNA accumulated in an unidentified cell type dispersed around the central nervous system in embryos at stage 14–15. During these stages, programmed cell death occurred around the central nervous system (53Abrams J.M. White K. Fessler L.I. Steller H. Development (Camb.). 1993; 117: 29-43PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting that no PARP transcript was detected in the first or third instar. DNA synthesis occurred extensively during the larval stage, but was not accompanied by mitosis and cytokinesis (54Lehner C.F. Lane M.E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 523-528PubMed Google Scholar). Further investigations on the role of PARP in developmental processes will be possible by the use of P-insertion mutants and transgenic flies with ectopic expression of PARP. Targeted expression of PARP in the eye imaginal disc induced aberrant development of eyes inDrosophila. 3M. Uchida, S. Hanai, K. Sawamoto, H. Okano, M. Miwa, and K. Uchida, unpublished observation. The role of PARP in cell cycle, cell differentiation, and apoptosis in compound eyes can be examined by these transgenic flies. Additionally, it should now be possible to identify functionally related targets by the use of genetic methods and analysis of suppressor and enhancer mutants and elucidate the signaling pathway.

Therefore, studies were conducted to determine whether the protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45 regulates signaling via these transmembrane receptors in an analogous manner. Cross-linking of either class II molecules or the BCR on CD45-positive K46-17μmλ B lymphoma cells was observed to induce activation of the Src family protein- tyrosine kinase Lyn, tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and phospholipase Cγ, and the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate leading to intracellular mobilization as well as extracellular influx of Ca2+. In the absence of CD45, cross-linking of either class II molecules or the BCR failed to induce activation of Lyn. Syk was inducibly phosphorylated on tyrosine in a normal manner, whereas phospholipase Cγ exhibited a high basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation that was not significantly increased upon stimulation. Nevertheless, phospholipase Cγ appeared to be functional because CD45-negative cells produced elevated levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate following stimulation through class II or the BCR. Regardless of this, CD45-negative cells exhibited Ca2+mobilization responses that were greatly diminished and transient in nature. Whereas little or no mobilization of Ca2+ was observed in response to class II cross-linking, CD45-deficient cells mobilized Ca2+ from intracellular stores but not the extracellular environment in response to BCR cross-linking. These results demonstrate that CD45 regulates both Src family kinase activation and Ca2+ mobilization associated with class II- and BCR-mediated signal transduction.

The exact molecular mechanism(s) by which class II molecules are coupled to these distinct signaling pathways is at present unclear but appears to be regulated in part by the activation state of the B cell. In both the human and mouse, cross-linking of MHC class II molecules on unstimulated B cells elicits the production of cAMP and promotes translocation of protein kinase C (23Scholl P.R. Geha R.S. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 418-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 26Wade W.F. Davoust J. Salamero J. Andre P. Watts T.H. Cambier J.C. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 539-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast, differences in coupling of MHC class II molecules to the PTK-dependent signaling pathway in humanversus mouse appear to exist. Whereas cross-linking of class II molecules in human tonsillar B cells and B cell lines leads to PTK activation (21Lane P.J.L. McConnell F.M. Schieven G.L. Clark E.A. Ledbetter J.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3684-3692PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mooney N.A. Grillot-Courvalin C. Hivroz C. Ju L.-Y. Charron D. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2070-2076PubMed Google Scholar), studies using quiescent mouse splenic B cells have demonstrated that class II-mediated PTK activation is dependent on the receipt of a priming signal delivered via the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) in conjunction with IL-4 (24Cambier J.C. Morrison D.C. Chen M.M. Lehmann K.R. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2075-2082PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent differences in coupling of class II to the PTK-dependent pathway in humanversus mouse have been attributed to inherent differences in the activation state of the cells being examined.Structure/function studies have demonstrated that the ability of MHC class II to mediate PTK activation resides in the transmembrane/extracellular region of the α and/or β chains (25Andre P. Cambier J.C. Wade T.K. Raetz T. Wade W.F. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 763-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Wade W.F. Davoust J. Salamero J. Andre P. Watts T.H. Cambier J.C. Immunol.

Immunol. 1995; 7: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that class II is coupled to PTK activation through its interaction with an intermediate transducer protein(s) in much the same way that membrane immunoglobulin is coupled to the Src PTKs through an interaction with the Igα/Igβ heterodimer. Further analogies between class II-mediated signaling and that of the BCR can be drawn from a range of studies. Cross-linking of MHC class II molecules on B cells leads to the activation of the Src family PTKs Lyn and Fgr (29Morio T. Geha R.S. Chatila T.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Additionally, class II has been shown to regulate the activation of the PTK Syk in both tonsillar B cells and B leukemia cell lines (30Kanner S.B. Grosmaire L.S. Blake J. Schieven G.L. Masewicz S. Odum N. Ledbetter J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1995; 46: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Downstream PTK-dependent processes including activation of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), phosphatidylinositol turnover, and increases in the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ have also been documented following cross-linking of class II molecules in human tonsillar B cells (21Lane P.J.L. McConnell F.M. Schieven G.L. Clark E.A. Ledbetter J.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3684-3692PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mooney N.A. Grillot-Courvalin C. Hivroz C. Ju L.-Y. Charron D. J.

Raetz T. Wade W.F. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 763-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that cross-linking of MHC class II molecules activates a signaling pathway that is similar to the one associated with the BCR.Because the signaling pathway activated by cross-linking of MHC class II molecules is similar to that triggered by ligand binding to the BCR, it was of interest to determine whether signal transduction via MHC class II is regulated by the protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) CD45. Numerous studies have demonstrated that optimal BCR-mediated signaling requires CD45 expression on the surface of the cell (31Justement L.B. Brown V.K. Lin J. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 399-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32Justement L.B. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 66: 1-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of CD45, BCR cross-linking does not mediate recruitment and activation of Src family PTKs (33Pao L.I. Bedzyk W.D. Persin C. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1116-1124PubMed Google Scholar, 34Pao L.I. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2663-2669PubMed Google Scholar, 35Yanagi S. Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Sabe H. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30487-30492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), whereas the PTK Syk is recruited to the BCR complex and is activated (34Pao L.I. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2663-2669PubMed Google Scholar, 35Yanagi S. Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Sabe H. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30487-30492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although Syk function appears to be intact in cells lacking CD45, the absence of this PTP is manifest by the fact that BCR-mediated mobilization of Ca2+ is abnormal, and activation of Ras is abrogated (36Justement L.B. Campbell K.S. Chien N.C. Cambier J.C. Science. 1991; 252: 1839-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 37Kim K.M. Alber G. Reth M. Immunol.

Thus, it is clear that the loss of CD45 may affect not only Src PTK activation but downstream processes as well.To determine whether CD45 regulates class II-mediated signaling, experiments were conducted using the K46 B cell lymphoma in conjunction with two CD45-deficient variants. The K46 lymphoma is ideal for these studies because it exhibits a primed MHC class II signaling phenotype (25Andre P. Cambier J.C. Wade T.K. Raetz T. Wade W.F. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 763-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Studies demonstrate that MHC class II-mediated activation of the Src family protein tyrosine kinase Lyn is abrogated, and Ca2+ mobilization is drastically reduced in the absence of CD45. These findings indicate that CD45 plays an analogous role in regulating both MHC class II- and BCR-mediated signal transduction.DISCUSSIONThe K46 B lymphoma cell line in conjunction with derivative CD45-negative variants constitutes a valuable model system for analyzing the role of CD45 in both BCR- and MHC class II-mediated signal transduction. The inherent advantage of utilizing the K46 cell line is that signaling via both the BCR and MHC class II can be analyzed in the same cell type without the need to prime the cell in order to couple class II to its PTK-dependent signaling pathway. This facilitates the direct comparison of the effect that loss of CD45 expression has on signal transduction via both receptors. The results obtained from this study suggest that, with regard to the requirement for CD45 expression, there are significant similarities between the BCR-mediated signaling pathway and the PTK-dependent pathway activated in response to cross-linking of MHC class II.Previous studies in both T cells and B cells have demonstrated that CD45 physically associates with members of the Src family and that loss of CD45 expression abrogates antigen receptor-dependent activation of Src family PTKs (32Justement L.B. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 66: 1-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Brown V.K. Ogle E.W. Burkhardt A.L. Rowley R.B. Bolen J.B. Justement L.B. J. Biol.

In the B cell, BCR-mediated activation of multiple Src family PTKs including Lyn, Fyn, and Blk is attenuated in the absence of CD45 (33Pao L.I. Bedzyk W.D. Persin C. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1116-1124PubMed Google Scholar, 34Pao L.I. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2663-2669PubMed Google Scholar, 35Yanagi S. Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Sabe H. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30487-30492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The inability to activate Src family PTKs in CD45-deficient cells results from hyperphosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal negative regulatory tyrosine residues in the respective members of the family (32Justement L.B. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 66: 1-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Pao L.I. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2663-2669PubMed Google Scholar, 35Yanagi S. Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Sabe H. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30487-30492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and the failure to properly recruit these PTKs to the BCR activation complex (34Pao L.I. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2663-2669PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with previous work this study demonstrates that, in the absence of CD45, cross-linking of either the BCR or MHC class II fails to inducibly activate the PTK Lyn. Although Lyn did not exhibit a significant increase in its basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation in the CD45-negative 35S5 and 3S5 clones, it was nevertheless clear that activation of this PTK is abrogated based on an analysis of its ability to phosphorylate the exogenous substrate enolase. Previous studies have implicated Fgr in addition to Lyn in class II-mediated signaling in the B cell (29Morio T. Geha R.S. Chatila T.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, because the K46 cell line does not express this PTK, it was not possible to determine whether CD45 expression is required for its inducible activation. It would be logical nonetheless to predict that the functional activation of this PTK would be inhibited as well because loss of CD45 expression has been shown to affect receptor-mediated activation of multiple Src family members in T and B cells (32Justement L.B. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 66: 1-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Although it was apparent from these studies that Src family PTK function is abrogated in the absence of CD45, subsequent studies demonstrated that the non-Src family PTK Syk is inducibly phosphorylated in response to cross-linking of both the BCR and MHC class II molecules. Based on an analysis of putative Syk substrate phosphorylation in response to cross-linking of either the BCR or class II, it is likely that Syk is constitutively active in the 3S5 and 35S5 clones. HS1, CD22, and PLCγ all exhibited increased basal levels of tyrosine phosphorylation in the 35S5 and 3S5 clones when compared with the CD45-positive K46 cells. Furthermore, CD22 was inducibly hyperphosphorylated suggesting that Syk activity is potentiated by BCR or class II ligation in cells lacking CD45. Previous studies using the J558L plasmacytoma and a CD45-positive transfectant of this cell line have revealed that Syk is recruited to the BCR activation complex in response to anti-Ig stimulation regardless of whether CD45 is expressed on the surface of the cell (34Pao L.I. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2663-2669PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of Syk in the absence of CD45 has also been reported in studies using the chicken DT40 cell line (35Yanagi S. Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Sabe H. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30487-30492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) as well as Syk-positive Jurkat T cells (45Chu D.H. Spits H. Peyron J.F. Rowley R.B. Bolen J.B. Weiss A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6251-6261Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Perhaps more important in light of the observation that putative Syk substrates exhibit basal hyperphosphorylation in the 35S5 and 3S5 clones is the finding that Syk is constitutively activated in CD45-deficient B cells. Studies using the J558L plasmacytoma demonstrated that Syk was approximately 3–4-fold more active in unstimulated cells that lacked CD45 when compared with CD45-positive transfectants (34Pao L.I. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2663-2669PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the loss of CD45 expression may result in aberrant constitutive activation of the PTK Syk.Because it was apparent from these studies that Syk activity may be constitutively elevated in the absence of CD45, it was of interest to determine whether the downstream substrate PLCγ is inducibly phosphorylated and activated in response to BCR or MHC class II cross-linking. Analysis of PLCγ phosphorylation revealed that it is constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine in the 35S5 clone in agreement with the possibility that Syk may be constitutively active in these cells. This finding is in contrast to previous studies using B cells isolated from CD45-deficient mice in which apparently normal inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ was observed in response to cross-linking of the BCR (46Benatar T. Carsetti R. Furlonger C. Kamila N. Mak T. Paige C.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Moreover, experiments with the CD45-negative J558L cell line revealed inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 even though the basal activity of Syk was elevated in these cells compared with CD45-positive J558L transfectants (33Pao L.I. Bedzyk W.D. Persin C. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1116-1124PubMed Google Scholar).Although PLCγ exhibited high basal phosphorylation in the 35S5 clone, subsequent studies to measure IP3 production demonstrated that PLCγ is indeed functional and that its activity is increased upon cross-linking of the BCR or MHC class II. In agreement with the observation that PLCγ was constitutively hyperphosphorylated in the CD45-negative clones, basal levels of IP3 were 1.5–2-fold higher in these cells when compared with parental K46 cells. Moreover, the level of IP3 present in CD45-deficient cells stimulated via the BCR or MHC class II was elevated at all time points assayed. Previous studies with the CD45-deficient J558L plasmacytoma have demonstrated that cross-linking of the BCR mediates increased production of IP3 in the absence of CD45 (33Pao L.I. Bedzyk W.D. Persin C. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1116-1124PubMed Google Scholar). However, because the basal level of IP3 in the J558L cells was only a fraction of that in the CD45-positive transfectants, the maximum level of IP3 produced in response to cross-linking of the BCR was not observed to surpass the base-line level of IP3present in the CD45-positive transfectants (33Pao L.I. Bedzyk W.D. Persin C. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1116-1124PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, although there is general agreement that cross-linking of the BCR, as well as MHC class II, leads to increased production of IP3 in the absence of CD45, there is a discrepancy between the K46 and J558L cell lines as to whether the net level of IP3 produced upon stimulation is sufficient to mediate downstream signaling.Consistent with previous studies of signal transduction via the BCR in CD45-deficient B cell lines, experiments revealed that there is a significant alteration in the Ca2+ mobilization response in the 3S5 and 35S5 clones. Cross-linking of the BCR in the CD45-negative clones leads to a transient rise in the [Ca2+] i that was due to mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Little or no extracellular influx of calcium was observed suggesting that the loss of CD45 expression either directly or indirectly affects the function of plasma membrane Ca2+channels. The loss of CD45 was observed to have an even more profound effect on class II-mediated Ca2+ mobilization. Class II ligation failed to induce a significant Ca2+ mobilization response in the absence of CD45. The explanation for the difference between BCR- and class II-mediated Ca2+ mobilization responses is at present unclear but does not seem related to the production of IP3.The selective abrogation of the extracellular influx of Ca2+ in the 35S5 and 3S5 clones in response to BCR cross-linking is in agreement with previous results from studies with B cells derived from CD45-deficient mice (46Benatar T. Carsetti R. Furlonger C. Kamila N. Mak T. Paige C.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The specific mechanism by which influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular space is inhibited in the absence of CD45 is not clear. Based on the results presented in this study, it would appear that IP3production leading to the depletion of intracellular Ca2+stores occurs more or less normally in the absence of CD45. Recent studies have demonstrated that depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores leads to the generation of a signal that activates Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane through a process termed capacitative Ca2+ entry (47Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). The specific mechanism by which depletion-activated Ca2+ channels are regulated is currently not well understood. However, there is evidence to support the hypothesis that depletion of intracellular stores initiates the production of a second messenger(s) from the microsomal fraction of the cell that diffuses through the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane where it opens the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channel (48Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 623-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The identity of the calcium influx factor is not well established at present. Nevertheless, the direct involvement of CD45 in regulating the production of Ca2+ influx factor might provide an explanation for the lack of BCR-mediated Ca2+ influx in CD45-negative cells. Alternatively, studies have suggested that depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores may regulate CRAC channel function via a PTK-dependent mechanism (49Vostal J.G. Jackson W.L. Shulman N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16911-16916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Lee K.-M. Toscas K. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9945-9948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus it is possible that CD45 expression is required to enable a member(s) of the Src family, or an as yet undefined PTK, to regulate CRAC channel function.In summary, this study demonstrates that CD45 plays a comparable role in regulating signaling via the BCR and MHC class II molecules in the B cell. Loss of CD45 expression attenuates Src family PTK activation in response to BCR or class II ligation. Additionally, the loss of CD45 expression has a profound effect on receptor-mediated Ca2+mobilization. These findings confirm that CD45 plays an important role in regulating B cell activation and further suggest that this PTP may regulate clonal expansion and differentiation mediated by MHC class II.

https://openalex.org/W2314886992,"The 5′ untranslated sequence (5′ UTS) of platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B/c-sis) mRNA is highly preserved through evolution, and inhibits translation of downstream coding sequences. In this study, using Northern analysis we identified two PDGF-B/c-sis mRNAs (3.5 kb and 2.6 kb) expressed in normal developing rat brain. In contrast to the constitutive expression of 3.5 kb mRNA, the expression of 2.6 kb mRNA increased markedly in accordance with those stages of brain development at which we had previously demonstrated an increased immunoreactivity for PDGF-B/c-SIS in neurons (). By PCR cloning and the RNase protection assay, we determined the complete sequence of rat PDGF-B/c-sis, and found that the 2.6 kb transcript was a form of the 3.5 kb message truncated at the 5′ end, and that the predominant 2.6 kb mRNA commenced 15 nt upstream of the signal peptide. Accordingly, it is suggested that the truncation of 5′ UTS contributes to the expression of PDGF-B/c-SIS protein in the CNS. Lack of translational inhibitory 5′ UTS of PDGF-B/c-sis transcript and resultant efficient protein translation have been reported in only a few transformed cells and cultured umbilical vein endothelial cells. We have extended this knowledge to the developing rat brain, and suggest that a similar mechanism could operate widely in non-transformed tissue in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2050876365,"To understand the relative contribution of viral receptor expression and cell proliferation in retroviral gene transfer, we created human hepatocyte-derived HuH-7.MCAT-1 cell lines. These cells constitutively express the murine ecotropic retroviral receptor MCAT-1 without changes in morphology or proliferation states. The MCAT-1 receptor is also a cationic amino acid transporter, and the HuH-7.MCAT-1.7 cells showed increased V max of uptake and steady-state accumulation of the cationic amino acidsl-arginine and l-lysine. In HuH-7.MCAT-1 cells,l-arginine uptake was significantly up-regulated by norepinephrine and dexamethasone, and hepatocyte growth factor also increased l-arginine uptake along with cellular DNA synthesis. Gene transfer was also markedly increased in HuH-7.MCAT-1.7 cells incubated with an ecotropic LacZ retrovirus, and this further increased with hormones and hepatocyte growth factor. To define whether viral receptor up-regulation by itself increased gene transfer, cell cycling was inhibited by a recombinant adenovirus expressing the Mad transcription factor (AdMad), which is a dominant-negative c-Myc regulator. This restricted cells in G0/G1, without attenuating MCAT-1 activity, as shown by flow cytometry andl-arginine uptake analysis, respectively. When asynchronously cycling HuH-7.MCAT-1.7 cells were first infected with the AdMad virus and then exposed to the ecotropic LacZ virus, gene transfer was virtually abolished. The data indicate that while up-regulation of viral receptors can greatly enhance retrovirally mediated gene transfer, DNA synthesis remains an absolute requirement for hepatic gene therapy with this approach. To understand the relative contribution of viral receptor expression and cell proliferation in retroviral gene transfer, we created human hepatocyte-derived HuH-7.MCAT-1 cell lines.

In HuH-7.MCAT-1 cells,l-arginine uptake was significantly up-regulated by norepinephrine and dexamethasone, and hepatocyte growth factor also increased l-arginine uptake along with cellular DNA synthesis. Gene transfer was also markedly increased in HuH-7.MCAT-1.7 cells incubated with an ecotropic LacZ retrovirus, and this further increased with hormones and hepatocyte growth factor. To define whether viral receptor up-regulation by itself increased gene transfer, cell cycling was inhibited by a recombinant adenovirus expressing the Mad transcription factor (AdMad), which is a dominant-negative c-Myc regulator. This restricted cells in G0/G1, without attenuating MCAT-1 activity, as shown by flow cytometry andl-arginine uptake analysis, respectively. When asynchronously cycling HuH-7.MCAT-1.7 cells were first infected with the AdMad virus and then exposed to the ecotropic LacZ virus, gene transfer was virtually abolished. The data indicate that while up-regulation of viral receptors can greatly enhance retrovirally mediated gene transfer, DNA synthesis remains an absolute requirement for hepatic gene therapy with this approach. Retroviral gene transfer vectors are desirable because of their safety and integration into the host genome, which permits permanent expression of introduced genes. However, proviral integrations in the host genome require cell proliferation and even ongoing mitosis (1Roe T.Y. Reynolds T.C. Yu G. Brown P.O. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2099-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the frequency of cell proliferation-related events differs among cell types and may govern why cycling cells incorporate retroviruses far more avidly than quiescent cells (2Pages J.-C. Andreoletti M. Bennoun M. Vons C. Elcheroth J. Lehn P. Houssin D. Chapman J. Briand P. Benarous R. Franco D. Weber A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Additional factors determining retroviral gene transfer include the presence or absence of specific receptors that determine viral entry into cells (3Miller A.D. Miller D.G. Garcia J.V. Lynch C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 217: 581-599Crossref Scopus (377) Google Scholar,4Closs E.I. Rinkes I.H.M. Bader A. Yarmush M.L. Cunningham J.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2097-2102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of retroviral infection is exhibited at two levels: species-specific and cell type-specific. The former is determined by differences in the viral envelope, and the latter by the presence of specific cell membrane receptors, which make cell types susceptible to infection with a given retrovirus. Alternative vectors, particularly adenovirus, which in contrast with retroviruses can be produced in extremely high titers, suffer from episomal deposition of introduced genes, leading eventually to gene losses, as well as from deleterious host immune responses preventing repeated virus administration (5Wilson J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1185-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Ecotropic retroviruses utilize the murine cationic amino acid transporter (MCAT-1) 1The abbreviations are used: MCAT, murine cationic amino acid transporter; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection. 1The abbreviations are used: MCAT, murine cationic amino acid transporter; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection. as their cellular receptor, which has recently been characterized (6Kim J.W.

MCAT-1 possesses 622 residues and 14 transmembrane-spanning domains; transports the cationic amino acids arginine, lysine, and ornithine; and belongs to the so-called y+ transporter system (see Refs. 11Wu J.Y. Robinson D. Kung H.-J. Hatzoglou M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1615-1623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12White M.F. Christensen H.N. J. Biol.

Nutr. 1993; 13: 137-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar for review). Transfection experiments showed that MCAT-1 expression makes nonpermissive cells susceptible to ecotropic retroviruses (4Closs E.I. Rinkes I.H.M. Bader A. Yarmush M.L. Cunningham J.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2097-2102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the MCAT-1 mRNA is expressed under basal conditions in many adult organs, including the brain, intestine, stomach, bone marrow, and spleen, this is not so in the normal adult liver (4Closs E.I. Rinkes I.H.M. Bader A. Yarmush M.L. Cunningham J.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2097-2102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wu J.Y. Robinson D. Kung H.-J. Hatzoglou M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1615-1623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, proliferating liver cells do express MCAT-1, as shown by studies in the newborn rat, partial hepatectomy-induced liver regeneration, and cultured primary hepatocytes undergoing DNA synthesis (4Closs E.I. Rinkes I.H.M. Bader A. Yarmush M.L. Cunningham J.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2097-2102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wu J.Y. Robinson D. Kung H.-J. Hatzoglou M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1615-1623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, a number of studies showed that retrovirally mediated gene transfer is increased under similar conditions (2Pages J.-C. Andreoletti M. Bennoun M. Vons C. Elcheroth J. Lehn P. Houssin D. Chapman J. Briand P. Benarous R. Franco D. Weber A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 10Kavanaugh M.P. Wang H. Zhang Z. Zhang W. Wu Y.-N. Dechant E. North R.A. Kabat D. J. Biol.

Therefore, it has been unclear as to the individual contribution of viral receptor expression and DNA synthesis in retroviral gene transfer. To develop a suitable system for dissociating retroviral receptor expression and cellular DNA synthesis, we created novel hepatic cell lines capable of constitutively expressing the MCAT-1 retroviral receptor. The task was facilitated by using the established HuH-7 cell line, which was originally derived from a human hepatocellular carcinoma (16Nakabayashi H. Taketa K. Miyano M. Yamane T. Sato J. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 3858-3863PubMed Google Scholar). HuH-7 cells are resistant to ecotropic retroviruses because appropriate receptors are lacking. A number of cell clones were stably transfected with an MCAT-1 cDNA, and the model was verified for MCAT-1 expression by using l-arginine uptake as a reporter, including testing hormonal and growth factor regulation of MCAT-1 activity. To suppress cell cycling without interfering with MCAT-1 expression, we overexpressed the Mad transcription factor, which preferentially binds to Max and serves to antagonize c-Myc activity in cells (17Lahoz E.G. Xu L. Schreiber-Agus N. DePinho R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5503-5507Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Use of these systems allowed us to investigate whether overexpression of viral receptors could lead to greater retroviral gene transfer, whether DNA synthesis was an absolute requirement for proviral integrations in the setting of receptor overexpression, and whether a combination of receptor overexpression and cellular DNA synthesis would be most effective in retroviral gene transfer. The pJET plasmid (18Albritton L.M. Tseng L. Scadden D. Cunningham J.M. Cell. 1981; 57: 659-666Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (551) Google Scholar) was digested with BamHI and EcoRI to isolate MCAT-1 cDNA (2.279-kilobase pair fragment), which was subcloned into the pGEM3Zf(+) plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) between theBamHI and EcoRI sites (pGEM3ZMCAT-1 plasmid). The MCAT-1 cDNA was then cut from the pGEM3ZMCAT-1 plasmid byHindIII and EcoRI and subcloned into the multicloning sites between the HindIII and EcoRI positions of the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 containing the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter/enhancer and the 231-base pair-long polyadenylation sequence from the bovine growth hormone gene (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). In the final pcDNA3MCAT-1 plasmid, the MCAT-1 cDNA retained the original BamHI site of the pJET plasmid. This cloning strategy allowed us to use the CMV promoter and polyadenylation site of the pcDNA3 plasmid with no further manipulations. The pcDNA3MCAT-1 plasmid coexpressed theneo R gene under the control of the SV40 promoter/enhancer and allowed for cell selections. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Biochemicals Inc., Calabasas, CA), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The plasmid pcDNA3MCAT-1 was transfected via liposomes into HuH-7 cells, and resistant cells were selected with 400 μg/ml Geneticin™ (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 4 weeks in Geneticin™, cell clones were screened for MCAT-1 cDNA integration and mRNA expression as well as susceptibility to infection by an ectotropic retrovirus. Based upon these studies, including increased retroviral gene transfer, one such clone (designated HuH-7.MCAT-1.7) was used for all subsequent experiments, and this was recloned by limiting dilutions to ensure cellular homogeneity. In some experiments, primary rat hepatocytes isolated by previously described collagenase perfusion methods were also included (19Gupta S. LaBrecque D.R. Shafritz D.A. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The viability of primary rat hepatocytes, tested by trypan blue dye exclusion, was 85–90%, and 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics for 24 h on dishes coated with rat tail collagen. The NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were originally from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). For hormonal induction experiments, 10−5 to 10−7m dexamethasone, 5–20 μg/ml insulin, 10−4 to 10−6m norepinephrine, or 20 ng/ml recombinant human hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was used. The cells were cultured both with and without arginine in the culture medium for 24 h before exposure for 2 h to arginine-free medium containing l-[3H]arginine for analyzing steady state intracellular accumulation (see below). [3H]Thymidine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable DNA was measured as described previously (19Gupta S. LaBrecque D.R. Shafritz D.A. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 3 μCi of [3H]thymidine/ml of medium (specific activity of 67 Ci/mmol; ICN Inc., Irvine, CA) for 1 h, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4), lysed in 0.33 msodium hydroxide, and precipitated with 1.2 m hydrochloric acid and 40% trichloroacetic acid. The DNA was pelleted in a microcentrifuge and redissolved in sodium hydroxide. In aliquots, either the radioactivity was counted in a scintillation counter, or DNA content was measured by a sensitive microfluorometric assay (19Gupta S. LaBrecque D.R. Shafritz D.A. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The number of cells was manually determined with a Neubauer hemocytometer. For flow cytometry, cells were released by 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA and washed once with Earle's balanced salt solution containing 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5.3 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 117 mm NaCl2, 1 mmNaH2PO4, and 5.6 mmd-glucose (pH 7.4) (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cellular DNA was stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide for 10 min using hypotonic shock with 0.1% sodium citrate as described (19Gupta S. LaBrecque D.R. Shafritz D.A. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), followed by analysis with a FACScan using Lysis II software (Becton Dickinson Advanced Cellular Biology, San Jose, CA). All experiments were performed in at least triplicate and repeated several times. Total cellular RNA and genomic DNA from the parental HuH-7 and HuH-7.MCAT-1 cells were isolated by a single-step procedure as described (20Chomcynski P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 532-537PubMed Google Scholar). Before electrophoresis, DNA samples (10 μg each) were digested with BamHI andEcoRI restriction endonucleases (Promega), electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, transblotted, and UV-cross-linked to Hybond-N™ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fifteen μg of RNA/sample was electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gels containing 0.6 mformaldehyde, transblotted, and UV-cross-linked to Hybond-N™ membranes. Equivalent RNA loading was analyzed by ethidium bromide staining. The blots were prehybridized for 8 h and hybridized for 16 h with a full-length MCAT-1 cDNA at 42 °C as per the manufacturer. The purified MCAT-1 cDNA insert was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random primer extension to 2–5 × 108 cpm/μg of DNA using a commercial kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (21Feinberg A.P Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16562) Google Scholar). The transblots were washed under stringent conditions with a final wash using 0.1 × SSPE at 65 °C (1 × SSPE = 0.18 m NaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.7), and 0.001 m Na2EDTA). Autoradiography was at −70 °C with X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Ribonuclease protection assays were performed with the HybSpeed™ ribonuclease protection assay kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). The [32P]UTP-labeled riboprobes were produced using a MAXIscript™ in vitro transcription kit (Ambion Inc.). A 720-base pair MCAT-1 riboprobe was synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase with linearized plasmid pGEM3ZMCAT-1 as the template. A 250-base pair internal control riboprobe was prepared with the SP6 RNA polymerase using a linearized pTRI mouse β-actin cDNA as the template. Fifteen μg of RNA/sample was mixed with 8 × 104 cpm of [32P]UTP-labeled riboprobe and hybridized at 68 °C for 1 h; the single-stranded unhybridized riboprobe molecules were subsequently degraded with RNase A/T1 at 37 °C for 30 min. After precipitation, the samples were loaded on either denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gels or nylon membranes by slot blotting. The assay using Earle's balanced salt solution was based on the method initially described by Gazzola et al. (22Gazzola G.C. Dall'Asta V. Franchi-Gazzola R. White M.F. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 115: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar).l-[2,3,4,5-3H]Arginine (64 Ci/mmol),l-[U-14C]proline (>250 mCi/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and l-[4,5-3H]lysine (80–110 Ci/mmol; Sigma) were obtained commercially. After culturing 1 × 105 cells in RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h in 24-well dishes, the medium was switched, and cells were incubated for 1 h in amino acid-free Dulbecco's modified essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Cells were then washed with amino acid-free Earle's balanced salt solution and incubated with Earle's balanced salt solution containing various amounts of unlabeled arginine or proline and a constant amount of [3H]arginine, [3H]lysine, or [14C]proline (∼1 × 106 cpm). Amino acid uptake was terminated by adding ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and cells were transferred immediately to ice. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS/bovine serum albumin and extracted with 200 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid, and activity in the soluble phase was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The extent of nonspecifically associated [3H]arginine, [3H]lysine, or [14C]proline was estimated by incubating cells at 4 °C, and this value was subtracted as an uptake blank from each sample. The kinetic constantsK m and V max were determined for the initial uptake of l-[3H]arginine, [3H]lysine, and [U-14C]proline in the presence of Na+. After depletion of amino acids for 1 h, the initial reaction velocities were estimated from a 60-s incubation over concentrations ranging between 0.02 and 1.00 mm. The protein concentration of each sample was measured by the Bio-Rad assay after dissolving 5% trichloroacetic acid-insoluble phase in 200 μl of 0.1 n sodium hydroxide (Bio-Rad). For demonstrating steady-state accumulation of the reporters, 1 × 105 cells were incubated in amino acid-free Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and either 0.02 or 0.8 mmunlabeled arginine plus [3H]arginine for 2 h, and incorporation was analyzed as described above. The amino acid uptake in individual cultures was standardized to the protein content and fit by least squares to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The least-square fitting analysis provided computer-derived K m andV max estimates ± S.E. of the estimate. Recombinant adenoviruses were grown in E1a-transformed 293 embryonic kidney cells; purified with two rounds of cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation; and dialyzed in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol (23Graham F.L. Prevec L. Murray E. Methods in Molecular Biology: Gene Transfer and Expression Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Jersey City, NY1991: 109-128Google Scholar). The adenoviral titer was determined by measuring optical density at 260 nm. For infection, cells were incubated with medium containing adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 20 for 2 h. The AdMad virus, which expresses the Mad protein, was used to suppress cell cycling. The Adβgal virus, which expresses Escherichia coli LacZ, was used as a control to exclude nonspecific changes due to adenoviral proteins, and this virus was provided by the Cell Culture and Genetic Engineering Core of the Liver Research Center at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. An additional control adenovirus was generated by inserting antisense hepatitis B virus sequences, using the EcoRI/XbaI fragment from the pCP10 hepatitis B virus plasmid, map positions 3182 to 2143 (24Elfassi E. Virology. 1987; 160: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), into the pAdBglII plasmid using the pJM17 system, obtained with the permission of Dr. M. Imperiale (University of Michigan) and Dr. F. L. Graham (McMaster University), respectively, from Dr. M. Horwitz at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. After digestion of the AdBglII plasmid with BglII, the antisense hepatitis B virus sequences previously ligated into an expression cassette containing the immediate-early CMV promoter and enhancer and the SV40 small T-antigen splice and SV40 polyadenylation sites were cloned. The antisense hepatitis B virus adenovirus was produced by Lipofectin™-mediated transfection of the modified pAdBglII and pJM plasmids into E1a-transformed 293 embryonic kidney cells. The transfected 293 cells were cultured for 10–12 days until cytopathic effect became apparent, and cells were lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles. The recombinant adenovirus was grown and purified as described above. Ecotropic and amphotropic retroviruses expressing E. coliLacZ were used for demonstrating gene transfer. The Ψ-CRE-nls-LacZ 30 producer cells were originally developed by Somatix Corp. (Los Angeles, CA) and provided by the Cell Culture and Genetic Engineering Core of the Marion Bessin Liver Research Center. The producer cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% calf serum and antibiotics. The culture supernatant was harvested after overnight incubation of cells with fresh medium and passed through a 0.45-μm filter to remove debris. Target cells were infected with retroviruses in serum-free Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 8 μg/ml Polybrene for 2 h and cultured for an additional 72 h before fixation in 0.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10 min. After washing with PBS, fixed cells were incubated overnight with 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside in 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, and 2 mm magnesium chloride. For determining the viral m.o.i., a constant number of NIH 3T3 cells (1 × 105) were incubated with serially diluted retrovirus medium, and the number of blue-stained cells was counted in random areas. For some experiments, retroviruses were concentrated by precipitation with 5 mmcalcium chloride as described (25Morling F.J. Russell S.J. Gene Ther. 1995; 2: 504-508PubMed Google Scholar). Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Data were analyzed by SigmaStat software (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). The significance of differences was tested where appropriate by Student's t test or analysis of variance, and p < 0.05 was taken to be significant. A total of 14 HuH-7.MCAT-1 cell clones were analyzed 4 weeks after transfection with the plasmid pcDNA3MCAT-1. In all positive clones, steady-statel-[3H]arginine accumulation was markedly increased compared with the untransfected parental cells (TableI). From among these cell clones, the HuH-7.MCAT-1.7 clone was randomly chosen for detailed studies because these cells expressed the introduced MCAT-1 cDNA with increased susceptibility to ecotropic retroviral infection, although not uniquely so. DNA transblot analysis showed that the HuH-7.MCAT-1.7 cells contained integrated MCAT-1 cDNA sequences that were absent in the parental HuH-7 cells (Fig.1 A). Although additional faint hybridization bands could have represented cross-hybridization with partially homologous endogenous sequences, these were not further characterized. RNA transblots showed that HuH-7.MCAT-1.7 cells contained mRNA transcripts that hybridized with a full-length MCAT-1 cDNA probe and corresponded to the 2.4-kilobase pair size of transfected MCAT-1 cDNA (Fig. 1 B). In addition, 10−5m dexamethasone up-regulated the steady-state abundance of this transgene transcript by severalfold. The RNase protection assay showed that HuH-7.MCAT-1.7 cells expressed unique mRNA transcripts hybridizing with the MCAT-1 riboprobe that were absent in parental HuH-7 cells (Fig. 1, C andD). In addition, the steady-state abundance of the MCAT-1 transgene transcript was up-regulated by severalfold after exposure to 10−5m dexamethasone. Interestingly, RNase protection showed that β-actin mRNAs were also up-regulated by dexamethasone in HuH-7.MCAT-1.7 cells, although the significance of this observation was unclear. Direct demonstration of the MCAT-1 gene product in the HuH-7.MCAT-1.7 cells was impossible due to the nonavailability of a reliable antibody for transblotting or immunoprecipitation, despite the use of an antibody for immunostaining (26Woodard M.H.

Open table in a new tab The transport and intracellular retention of arginine were markedly increased in HuH-7.MCAT-1.7 cells. The initial velocity ofl-arginine uptake appeared to be greater in HuH-7.MCAT-1.7 and NIH 3T3 cells compared with HuH-7 cells (Fig.2 A). The relevant parameters of the transport kinetics obtained from three independent experiments are summarized in Table II. Thel-arginine uptake showed saturable kinetics in parental HuH-7 cells, with V max = 3.0 ± 0.5 nmol/mg of protein/min and K m = 257 ± 16 μm. In contrast, the V max ofl-arginine transport was significantly greater in HuH-7.MCAT-1.7 cells (mean, 160% greater), indicating higher capacity as well as higher affinity for arginine transport. In contrast, in the NIH 3T3 cells, which exhibit remarkable avidity for ecotropic retroviruses, the l-arginine uptake was characterized by even greater affinity, but with a lower capacity (mean, 77% less), in comparison with the parental HuH-7 cells. Interestingly, when compared with NIH 3T3 cells, the V max andK m of arginine transport in the HuH-7.MCAT-1.7 cells were significantly different (p < 0.03 andp < 0.002, respectively), with the HuH-7.MCAT-1.7 cells showing lower affinity and higher apparent capacity forl-arginine transport. The l-lysine transport analysis demonstrated a greater initial velocity ofl-lysine uptake in HuH-7.MCAT-1.7 cells (Fig.2 B). The mean V max (7.03 ± 0.52 nmol/mg of protein/min) for l-lysine in these cells was significantly greater (161%) than that in parental HuH-7 cells (V max = 4.36 ± 0.21 nmol/mg of protein/min; p < 0.01), indicating again a higher affinity and capacity for another cationic amino acid. We found that arginine uptake could not be saturated in primary rat hepatocytes, confirming previous studies (12White M.F. Christensen H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4450-4457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and further contrasting with the arginine transport observed in HuH-7.MCAT-1.7 cells. On the other hand, the proline transport was similar in HuH-7 and HuH-7.MCAT-1.7 cells, with V max = 2.35 ± 0.11 versus2.38 ± 0.14 nmol/mg of protein/min and K m = 0.138 ± 0.10 versus 0.124 ± 0.09 mm, respectively (p = not significant) (Fig.2 C).Table IIKinetic parameters of l-arginine uptakeCell typeV maxpK mpnmol/mg protein/minμmHuH-73.0 ± 0.5257 ± 16HuH-7.MCAT-1.74.7 ± 0.2<0.001169 ± 11<0.001NIH3T32.5 ± 0.1<0.0596 ± 3<0.001Comparisons for p values were against HuH-7 cells.

MCAT-1 overexpression is known to increase the steady-state intracellular accumulation of l-arginine as shown inXenopus oocytes and mink fibroblasts (27Wang H. Dechant E. Kavanaugh M. North R.A.

Utilizing retention ofl-[3H]arginine allowed us to conveniently examine the hormonal regulation of MCAT-1 activity. Our studies of steady-state arginine accumulation showed that l-arginine retention in HuH-7.MCAT-1.7 cells was markedly increased compared with HuH-7 cells (>300%, p < 0.001) (Fig.3). The increase inl-[3H]arginine accumulation was competitively inhibited by unlabeled arginine.

https://openalex.org/W2065391141,"Thrombin has been shown to mediate neurite retraction in neurons and synapse elimination at the neuromuscular junction. The presence of prothrombin mRNA has been demonstrated in brain and in muscle, but extra-hepatic regulation of the prothrombin gene has not been investigated. To identify cis-acting DNA elements involved in the expression of the prothrombin gene in muscle, we have isolated and analyzed a 1.3-kilobase pair promoter region of the mouse prothrombin gene. Using a series of transiently transfected plasmid constructs in which gene segments of the prothrombin promoter were linked to the luciferase gene, we have identified a sequence, −302 to −210, essential for prothrombin promoter activity in C2-myotubes. Fine analysis revealed that deletion of nucleotides between −248 and −235 eliminated prothrombin promoter activity in C2-myotubes. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that a nuclear factor present in C2-myotubes, but not in C2-myoblasts or HepG2 hepatocytes, specifically binds to the sequence −241 to −225. Substitutional mutation of nucleotides −237 to −231 abolished myotube-specific promoter activity and inhibited the nuclear factor binding. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction demonstrated the expression of prothrombin mRNA in myotubes, but not in myoblasts, of primary, C2, and G8 muscle cells. This result correlates with the lack of prothrombin promoter activity in C2-myoblasts. The data thus suggest that a myotube-specific nuclear factor binds to a cis-acting sequence encompassing the core nucleotides −237 to −231 and plays a critical role in muscle-specific, differentiation-dependent expression of the mouse prothrombin gene.

Thrombin is synthesized and secreted from hepatocytes as a proteolytically incompetent zymogen form, prothrombin, the activation of which occurs at the sites of vascular injury. The function of thrombin has been extensively studied in the vascular system, and thrombin is known to play a key role in the maintenance of hemostasis (1Fenton J.W., II Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 485: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Recent reports have also identified extravascular cellular functions that are mediated by thrombin in the process of neural development. Thrombin has been shown to modulate the shape of astrocytes (2Cavanaugh K.P. Gurwitz D. Cunningham D.D. Bradshaw R.A. J.

Most thrombin-mediated cellular effects are observed experimentally with the addition of exogenous thrombin or thrombin inhibitors to anin vitro culture system. The cellular localization of non-hepatic prothrombin mRNA is of interest because most thrombin-mediated cellular effects observed in vitro are thought to occur in the normal course of development, such as synapse reshaping. The recruitment of activated thrombin from blood in the absence of vascular injury during these events is unlikely. In support of this scenario, the expression of prothrombin mRNA has been demonstrated in brain and neural cell lines (10Dihanich M. Kaser M. Reinhard E. Cunningham D. Monard D. Neuron. 1991; 6: 575-581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 11Weinstein J.R. Gold S.J. Cunningham D.D. Gall C.M. J.

Fitzgerald S. Coven E. Brenneman D.E. Nelson P.G. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 99: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and in extracts of mouse skeletal muscle (9Zobine M.N. Ma J.Y. Smirnova I.V. Citron B.A. Festoff B.W. Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, the transcriptional regulation of prothrombin gene expression in tissues other than the liver has not been studied. We have investigated the expression of the mouse prothrombin gene in muscle, and in this report, we demonstrate that transcriptional regulation of the mouse prothrombin gene in skeletal muscle cells is distinct from that in liver cells. Furthermore, the prothrombin gene is not expressed in myoblasts but is activated upon differentiation of skeletal muscle in culture. The 5′-flanking region of the mouse prothrombin gene was cloned using the Genome Walker Kit (CLONTECH). The kit provides five sets of mouse genomic libraries generated from mouse genomic DNA cut with different restriction enzymes and ligated to short adapter sequences. Primary and nested polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kbp, kilobase pair(s); EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; WT, wild type. were performed using forward primers complementary to the adapter sequence and reverse primers, 5′-TACCAGGCTAACCAGGGCAGCCAGAGC-3′ and 5′-AGCCAGAGCCAAGCAGCCAGGGGAGGCC-3′, which correspond to nucleotides 84–58 and nucleotides 66–37, respectively, of the mouse prothrombin cDNA sequence (13Degen S.J.

A 1.3-kilobase pair (kbp) PCR product was cloned into the pCR 2.1 vector (Invitrogen), designated as pCR/1.3-kbp, and sequenced on both strands by a commercial service (Lark Technologies, Inc.). To determine the transcription start site of the prothrombin gene, poly(A)+ mRNA from the leg muscles of embryonic day 16 mice was isolated using the Oligotex Direct mRNA purification kit (Qiagen). Muscle mRNA (100 ng) was subjected to the 5′-RACE, Version 2.0 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Reverse primers 5′-CACTGAATCACACACACTGTGT-3′ and 5′-TCCTCCAGGAAGCCACTGTT-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 300–281 and 170–151, respectively, of the mouse prothrombin cDNA sequence, were employed in primary and nested PCRs (13Degen S.J.

Putative clones were identified by EcoRI and ApaI/SacII restriction enzyme digestion analysis, and four clones were sequenced using the T7 Sequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All animals used for the study were handled in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Animal Care and Welfare protocol. Prothrombin promoter gene segments containing various 5′-ends were generated by PCR using the pCR/1.3-kbp plasmid as a template. Forward primers used for PCR are shown in TableI. Promoter sequences containing substituted nucleotides, sequences M1 to M5, were also generated by PCR using forward primers with the indicated nucleotide substitutions (Table I). The numbering of nucleotides is relative to the transcription start site (+1) determined from the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. A common reverse primer, 5′-GTGAGATCTAGTGTGTCAGCTCCTG-3′, contained aBglII site to facilitate cloning into the pGL3-basic vector (Promega) linearized with SmaI/BgllI. PCR was performed utilizing pfu polymerase (Stratagene). All the reporter plasmid constructs were sequenced on both strands to confirm their fidelity to the sequence of the 1.3-kbp mouse prothrombin gene. A series of pure clones was isolated by two consecutive platings on ampicillin-containing LB agar plates. Overnight cultures of 300 ml were subjected to the Maxi DNA preparation kit (Qiagen), and approximately 400 μg of plasmid was obtained. The stock reporter plasmids were diluted to 2 mg/ml in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl and 1 mm EDTA (TE), and kept at 4 °C.Table IForward primers used for the construction of reporter plasmidsPrimer5′-bp positionNucleotide sequence1-aBoldface letters indicate mutation.1−775′-TGCCACTGATTTCTTCA-3′2−1515′-CCAGGAGAACCTGTCCT-3′3−2105′-TGGAAGGGTGACGGTCTT-3′4−3025′-TGGATGTGGGGAGTTTTG-3′6−4005′-CAGTAGGCCCGGTGTTTTGT-3′7−6075′-GTGCTGGGGCAGGAGATTGA-3′8−8025′-AGGTGTCCCTGCTCTTTGTC-3′9−9845′-GATATATGTTTTATATG-3′10−12185′-CACATGGACATATACACATC-3′11−2805′-ATCTCTGTCGGTTGGGATTA-3′12−2655′-GATTAGAAGGAGCCTCC-3′13−2565′-GAGCCTCCAGAAGGACTT-3′14−2485′-AGAAGGACTTATTGAT-3′15−2355′-GATTCACATTTACCCA-3′M1−2485′-AGAAGGAAAAATTGATTCACATTTACCC-3′M2−2485′-AGAAGGACTTAAAAATTCACATTTACCC-3′M3−2485′-AGAAGGACTTATTGAAAAACATTTACCC-3′M4−2485′-AGAAGGACTTATTGATTCAAAAATACCCAC-3′M5−2485′-AGAAGGACTTATTGATTCACATTTAAAAACATCA-3′1-a Boldface letters indicate mutation. Open table in a new tab The mouse C2 skeletal muscle cell line was obtained from Dr. Christian Fuhrer (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum. The HepG2 liver cell line was purchased from ATCC (Rockville Pike, MD) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfection was performed by the method of calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation using a commercial kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). For the transfection of C2-myoblasts, mononucleated C2 cells at approximately 40% confluency were transfected, and the cells were harvested 48 h later. No signs of fusion were observed microscopically at the time of harvesting. For C2-myotubes, C2 cells 80–90% confluent were transfected with reporter constructs. After 24 h, the medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with the 5% horse serum to induce differentiation into multinucleated myotubes. Within 48 h, fusion was complete, and C2-myotubes were harvested for the luciferase assay. pRL-CMV vectors were co-transfected with pGL3 reporter plasmids to normalize the pGL3 reporter luciferase activity according to the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Measurements were made using a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (EG & G Berthold, Wilbad, Germany). Nuclear protein extracts from C2-myoblasts, C2-myotubes, and HepG2 cells were prepared as described (14Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar) with the modifications described in Ref. 34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 12.1.1-12.1.9Google Scholar. Nuclear extracts were dialyzed in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mmEDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C. Any precipitation formed during dialysis was removed by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined using a commercially available Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). For the EMSA probes, wild type (WT) and five mutant constructs (M1–M5) containing nucleotides from −284 to −140 of the prothrombin promoter sequence were generated by PCR amplification using the pCR/1.3-kbp construct as a template. PCR was performed with WT or mutant forward primers (Table I) and a common reverse primer, 5′-AGGTTCTCCTGGAACCAG-3′ (−140 to −157). PCR products were purified by low melting point agarose gel electrophoresis and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and separated from free nucleotides by Sephadex G-25 chromatography. Oligonucleotides matching short segments of the WT fragment were synthesized by a commercial service (Genosys) and purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For competitive EMSA, the double-stranded oligomeric probes were prepared by annealing equal amounts of complementary oligonucleotides. A 100-fold excess of unlabeled probe was added in competitive binding reactions. DNA-protein binding reactions were carried out in a total volume of 15 μl, which included 2 μg of nuclear proteins, 1 μg of poly(dI)·poly(dC), 50 fmol of probes (∼20,000 cpm), and a buffer consisting of 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, DNA-protein complexes were separated from the free oligonucleotides by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in buffer containing 50 mm Tris base, 380 mm glycine, and 2 mm EDTA. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. RNA samples from primary muscle and fibroblast cultures and skeletal muscle cell lines C2 and G8 were isolated using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Primary mouse muscle cultures were prepared as described in Ref. 12Glazner G.W. Yadav K. Fitzgerald S. Coven E. Brenneman D.E. Nelson P.G. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 99: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, and primary fibroblasts were obtained from the preplating used to remove contaminating fibroblasts during muscle culture preparation. The G8 cell line was obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% horse serum and 10% fetal calf serum. G8 cells differentiated into multinucleated myotubes when at confluency without a reduction in serum content of the medium. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA by priming with oligo(dT)18 using the Advantage RT-for-PCR kit (CLONTECH). Competitor mimic cDNAs flanked by the target gene primer sequences (5′-CAACATCAATGAGATACAGCCCAGCGTCC-3′ and 5′-CATGCGTGTAGAAGCCGTATTTCCCCTTC-3′ for prothrombin and 5′-GGCCAGATCCTGATGCCCAAC-3′ and 5′-CAGCTGTGCTGCTCTTTCTAC-3′ for rPL32) were generated using a PCR mimic construction kit (CLONTECH). The mimic cDNAs were initially diluted 10-fold ranging from 100 attomoles/μl to 10−6attomoles/μl and co-amplified with a constant amount of the muscle cDNA sample in a 25-μl reaction that included 1× PCR buffer, 50 μm dNTPs, 0.1 μm each 5′- and 3′-primers, and 1.2 units of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). Samples were amplified for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, and the PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gels (Novex). After the initial screening using 10-fold serially diluted competitor cDNA, the optimal range of mimic cDNA dilution was chosen for the competitive PCR experiment described in Fig. 1. The intensities of bands in EtBr-stained gels were quantified using the BioImage IQ program (BioImage, Ann Arbor, MI) and used to calculate the ratios of prothrombin to mimic cDNA. The values were then normalized relative to the values obtained for a housekeeping gene, the gene encoding ribosomal protein L32 (rPL32) (15Dudov K.P. Perry R.P. Cell. 1984; 37: 457-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence of the mouse prothrombin 1.3-kbp clone has been submitted to GenBankTM. The sequence between −972 and the translation initiation codon ATG had 69% identity with the corresponding region of the human prothrombin gene, based on a GCG sequence alignment program (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI). The human prothrombin sequence used for the alignment was as previously reported (16Chow B.K.-C. Ting V. Tufaro F. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18927-18933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with GenBankTM accession numberM65141. The sequence between −1211 and −1017 was 86% identical to the mouse B1 repetitive sequence (17Bonnerot C. Varin N. Rabourdin-Come C. Fridman W.H. Even J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) found in numerous mouse genes based on a National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST search (18Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70277) Google Scholar). The transcription start site was determined to be five nucleotides upstream from the translational initiation codon ATG based on sequence analyses of the four clones resulting from the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The promoter region of the mouse prothrombin gene does not contain a consensus CCAAT motif or a canonical TATA box, as has been reported for the human prothrombin gene (16Chow B.K.-C. Ting V. Tufaro F. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18927-18933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have located a TATA-like sequence, TATTAA, at −46 with respect to the transcription start site. mRNA expression of mouse prothrombin was investigated in primary mouse muscle cultures and in the mouse skeletal cell lines C2 and G8 (Fig.1). A competitive PCR was used to quantitatively determine differences in prothrombin mRNA expression. The expression of prothrombin mRNA could be detected in myotubes of primary, C2, and G8 cells. Prothrombin mRNA in mononucleated myoblasts both from primary and from C2 and G8 was undetectable. The quantitation results of the competitive PCR on rPL32 demonstrated that housekeeping rPL32 mRNA levels were equivalent in myoblasts and myotubes (Fig. 1), thus confirming that prothrombin mRNA is present in differentiated multinucleated myotubes but not in undifferentiated myoblasts of primary, C2, and G8 cells. The expression of prothrombin mRNA was also not detected in the contaminating primary fibroblasts obtained during the muscle culture preparation (Fig. 1). To investigate the contributions of specific promoter regions to prothrombin gene expression in muscle and liver, varying lengths of the mouse prothrombin gene promoter possessing the same 3′-end sequence were linked to the 5′-end of a promoterless luciferase reporter gene in the pGL3-basic plasmid vector. The reporter plasmid constructs were initially tested in human HepG2 hepatocytes to investigate the promoter activity of mouse prothrombin constructs in relation to that previously reported for the human prothrombin promoter in HepG2 cells (16Chow B.K.-C. Ting V. Tufaro F. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18927-18933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The overall pattern of activity of the mouse reporter constructs in HepG2 cells (Fig.2) was nearly identical to that of the human prothrombin reporter constructs tested in HepG2 cells (16Chow B.K.-C. Ting V. Tufaro F. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18927-18933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the human gene, a liver-specific cis-acting sequence was shown to be located between −940 and −860 (for numbering of the human gene, see Ref. 16Chow B.K.-C. Ting V. Tufaro F. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18927-18933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and deletion of nucleotides in this region virtually destroyed the activity of the human prothrombin gene promoter in HepG2 cells (16Chow B.K.-C. Ting V. Tufaro F. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18927-18933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GCG best-fit alignment indicated that residues −940 to −840 in human prothrombin align with −816 to −723 in the mouse prothrombin sequence (data not shown), and deletion of this region in mouse also drastically diminished promoter activity in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2). In addition, no significant differential activity was observed among mouse promoter segments terminating between nucleotides −607 and −77 (Fig. 2), similar to the case of human gene (16Chow B.K.-C. Ting V. Tufaro F. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18927-18933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As described for the corresponding sequence of human prothrombin, the mouse sequence −816 and −723 was also flanked by Sp-1-like sequences. Moreover, a putative liver-specific enhancer AATATTT (hepatic nuclear factor 1) identified in the human promoter is also conserved in the mouse prothrombin gene. The above constructs were also transiently transfected into C2 mouse muscle cells to investigate the muscle-specific regulation of mouse prothrombin expression (Fig. 2). None of the constructs had appreciable luciferase activity in C2-myoblasts (Fig. 2). This result correlates well with the lack of expression of the endogenous prothrombin gene in undifferentiated C2-myoblasts (Fig. 2). Highest luciferase activity in C2-myotubes was from the −802/+5 construct (29-fold above the construct −77/+5). The constructs −1218/+5 and −984/+5 showed 2-fold lower activity in C2-myotubes compared with that of −802/+5, whereas the activities of all three constructs were equivalent in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the region −984 to −802 encompasses a negative cis-element that represses expression of the mouse prothrombin in C2-myotubes but not in HepG2 cells. Moreover, the constructs terminating between −607 and −210 did not show dramatically lower activity in C2-myotubes as they did in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2). The proximal promoter region −302/+5 still possessed a 17-fold higher activity than that of −77/+5 and was about 60% as active as the −802/+5 construct. These results indicate that the transcriptional regulation of prothrombin gene in C2-myotubes is distinct from that in HepG2 cells. Five additional reporter plasmids were constructed by progressive deletion of 5′ sequence spanning −302 to −210 and were transfected into C2-myotubes (Fig.3). The luciferase activities of the reporter constructs are shown relative to the activity of the construct −302/+5 as 100% activity. The −235/+5 construct was about half as active as the longer constructs. Therefore, the proximal sequence between nucleotides −248 to −235 may contain an importantcis-acting regulatory sequence that is required for prothrombin promoter activity in C2-myotubes. In pursuit of finding prothrombin gene-specifictrans-acting factors in C2 nuclear extract, EMSA was performed with the probe −248/−140 and the nuclear extracts of C2-myoblasts, C2-myotubes, and HepG2 cells (Fig.4). The results demonstrated that complex C-I was present only in the nuclear extracts from C2-myotubes. Other complexes (C-II, C-III, and C-IV) were shared between C2-myoblast and C2-myotube nuclear extracts. The complexes CB-I and CB-II were observed either exclusively or noticeably higher in C2-myoblasts nuclear extracts. There was no apparent binding of nuclear factors from HepG2 cells specifically in the area of the C-I complex. The competitive EMSA demonstrated that the binding of both C-I and C-II to −248/−140 could be inhibited in the presence of excess cold probe −241/−210 or −241/−225 (Fig. 5). The cold probe −209/−166 preferentially inhibited complex C-III binding to the hot probe −248/−140 and also appeared to affect the binding of C-II. However, this indirect inhibition of the binding of C-II was not observed when we performed a competitive EMSA identical to that described in Fig. 5 using C2-myoblasts nuclear extracts (data not shown). Interestingly, we found that the formation of the both complexes C-II and CB-I was inhibited in the presence of either cold competitors, −241/−210 or −241/−225, as was the case for myotube complexes C-I and C-II. These results suggested that the C-II protein may play a central role in the binding of either the myoblast complex CB-1 or the myotube complex C-I during differentiation of C2 cells. Because the oligomeric probe −241/−225 successfully inhibited the binding of C-I nuclear factor to the WT probe −248/−140 (Fig. 5), the region −241 to −227 was mutated by step-wise substitution of adenine nucleotides (Fig. 6 A). A nearly complete inhibition of the binding of complex C-I was observed with the mutant probes M2 and M3. The results were in agreement with transfection analysis of the five mutant reporter plasmid constructs (Fig.6 B). The luciferase activity of the constructs was evaluated relative to the activity of the WT construct. Constructs containing mutations M2 (−237/−235) and M3 (−233/−231) had diminished activity, comparable to the activity loss observed with the −235/+5 construct. The M1 mutation resulted in a moderate inhibition of the C-I binding but did not result in a significant decrease in reporter activity. Taken together, these results indicate that C-I interacts with the cis-region encompassing the core nucleotides −237 to −231 and plays a critical role in prothrombin reporter activity in C2-myotubes. Until the early 1990s, prothrombin was considered to be a model gene for studying liver-specific gene regulation because of its abundant and exclusive expression in the liver (16Chow B.K.-C. Ting V. Tufaro F. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18927-18933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent reports, however, strongly indicate that the regulation of prothrombin gene expression in the skeletal muscle might be independent of that in the liver. In particular, the expression of prothrombin mRNA in muscle appears to be innervation-dependent, being high at birth and drastically diminishing after the period of stable synapse formation (9Zobine M.N. Ma J.Y. Smirnova I.V. Citron B.A. Festoff B.W. Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have recently found that the denervation of adult limb muscle significantly up-regulates the expression of prothrombin. 2S. Kim, unpublished data. Nevertheless, the localization of prothrombin mRNA in muscle has been problematic due to extremely low mRNA levels. In our experience, the expression of prothrombin mRNA in neonatal mouse skeletal muscle was up to 3 orders of magnitude lower than in neonatal and adult mouse liver. Although a sensitive reverse transcription-PCR analysis detected the expression of prothrombin mRNA in the leg muscle at mouse embryonic days 12 and 16 (9Zobine M.N. Ma J.Y. Smirnova I.V. Citron B.A. Festoff B.W. Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the cellular localization of prothrombin usingin situ hybridization revealed the expression of prothrombin exclusively in the liver of the corresponding days of embryos (19Soifer S.J. Peters K.G. O'Keefe J. Coughlin S.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 60-69PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported recently that application of exogenous thrombin to C2-myoblasts resulted in a delay in the formation of myotubes without being mitogenic (20Guttridge D.C. Lau A. Tran L. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24117-24120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, in that study, the authors did not investigate endogenous prothrombin expression in C2 cells. Earlier, exogenous thrombin had been shown to be mitogenic in rat primary myoblasts (21Suidan H.S. Niclou S.P. Dreessen J. Beltraminelli N. Monard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29162-29169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Using a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, we have demonstrated here that prothrombin mRNA is exclusively expressed in differentiated myotubes but not in myoblasts of both primary muscle culture and skeletal muscle cells C2 and G8. The prothrombin message appears upon fusion of muscle cells, and thus, it is intriguing to speculate about the in vivo function of endogenous prothrombin in the muscle fibers. The proteolytic activity of thrombin has already seen associated with the process of synapse elimination at the neuromuscular junction (8Liu Y. Fields R.D. Festoff B.W. Nelson P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10300-10304Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 9Zobine M.N. Ma J.Y. Smirnova I.V. Citron B.A. Festoff B.W. Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our experiments revealed that the activity of the prothrombin gene in C2-myotubes was significantly dependent on a C2-myotube nuclear factor C-I binding to the sequence between −241 and −225 encompassing the nucleotides TGATTCA (−236/−230), a sequence previously reported to bind to AP-1 (22Perkins K.K. Dailey G.M. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1615-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The substitution of either nucleotides −237/−235 or −233/−231 abolished both the binding of C-I and reporter activity in C2-myotubes. A major component of the AP-1 binding factor, c-Jun, is known to form homodimers as well as heterodimers with Jun B, Jun D, c-Fos, Fra-1, Fra-2, and Fos B. A putative AP-1 binding site is located in a corresponding region of the human prothrombin sequence based on a search using Transcription Element Search Software on the World Wide Web. 3J. Schug and G. C. Overton (1997) Technical report CBIL-TR-1997-1001-v0.0, Computational Biology and Informatics Laboratory, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, (available at agave.humgen.upenn.edu/tessl). We therefore performed both supershift EMSA and EMSA coupled with Western blot analysis (data not shown) using antibodies (purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) specific to c-Jun (cross-reactivity with c-Jun, Jun B, and Jun D) and c-Fos (cross-reactivity with c-Fos, Fos B, Fra-1, and Fra-2). In addition, we have performed competitive EMSA with the 26-mer DNA probe containing a consensus AP-1 binding motif TGACTCA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). None of the antibodies alone or combined showed a reactivity with the C2-myotube nuclear complex C-I. The 26-mer AP-1 sequence failed to compete for the binding of C-I to the −248/−140 probe (data not shown), whereas the 16-mer oligomeric −241/−225 probe, encompassing the sequence TGATTCA, competitively abolished the binding of C-I to −248/−140. It has been previously reported that the expression of c-jun mRNA is down-regulated during differentiation of C2 cells and that the constitutive expression of c-Jun in C2-myoblasts inhibits the myogenic differentiation of C2 cells (23Bengal E. Ransone L. Scharfmann R. Dwarki V.J. Tapscott S.J. Weintraub H. Verma I.M. Cell. 1992; 68: 507-519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Thus, we have concluded that the possibility of the C-I complex containing AP-1 is remote. We are currently engaged in purification of the C-I factor, and further analysis will determine its identity. A family of myogenic basic helix-loop-helix DNA-binding proteins, mainly MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and MEF4, play a pivotal role in the determination of muscle lineage and the differentiation of skeletal muscle fibers (reviewed in Refs. 24Edmondson D.G. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 755-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 25Lassar A. Münsterberg A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These myogenic factors bind E-box motifs (CANNTG) found in control regions of muscle-specific genes, and the binding of the myogenic factors to the E-box has been shown to play a critical role in the expression of muscle-specific genes (reviewed in Refs. 24Edmondson D.G. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 755-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 25Lassar A. Münsterberg A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We have identified four E-box motifs in the 1.3-kbp promoter region of the mouse prothrombin gene. However, the three E-boxes located between −1218 and −802 did not play a positive role in reporter activity in transient transfection because the highest luciferase activity was obtained with the construct −802/+5. Also, the construct −151/+5, possessing a proximal E-box, did not exhibit any appreciable level of luciferase activity in C2-myotubes (Fig. 2). Although maximal expression of many muscle-specific genes is controlled by the presence of more than one E-box, it has been reported that certain muscle-specific genes can be controlled by a single E-box accompanied by other regulatory sites (26Sartorelli V. Webster K.A. Kedes L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1811-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 27Lin H. Yutzey K.E. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 28Simon A.M. Burden S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5133-5140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There have also been examples of muscle-specific genes that do not contain E-boxes within their regulatory regions (29Mohun T.J. Taylor M.V. Garrett N. Gurdon J.B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1153-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 30Mar J.H. Ordhal C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4271-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 31Thompson W.R. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22678-22688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such regulatory regions were shown to contain motifs, such as CArG (29Mohun T.J. Taylor M.V. Garrett N. Gurdon J.B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1153-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), M-CAT (30Mar J.H. Ordhal C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4271-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and MEF-2 (32Gossett L.A. Kelvin D.J. Sternberg E.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5022-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 33Cserjesi P. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4854-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), that were also shown to participate in the activation of muscle-specific genes. However, the C-I binding site, CTTATTGATTC (−241/−231), does not resemble CArG, M-CAT, or MEF-2 sequences. Whether myogenic factors interact in cis with the C-I factor or C-I is indirectly activated by myogenic factors during muscle differentiation remains to be determined. The myotube-specific complex C-I readily interacts with the probe −248/−140; however, C-I did not bind to the oligomeric probes −241/−210 and −241/−225. Instead, a ubiquitous nuclear factor (not AP-1) present in both C2-myoblasts and C2-myotubes bound to these two probes, as did nuclear factors in HepG2 cells (data not shown). Most importantly, there was no evidence of differential binding activity of C2-myotube nuclear extracts to either −241/−210 or −241/−225 probes in comparison with nuclear extracts from C2-myoblasts and HepG2 cells. Nevertheless, when these probes were used in excess in the competitive EMSA, they could compete the binding of C-I to the probe −280/−140. This might indicate a cooperative interaction between the C-I complex and nuclear complexes bound to the −209 to −148 that resulted in an increased binding affinity of C-I to its site. In this report, we have demonstrated that regulation of the prothrombin gene in muscle is quite distinct from that in liver and that its activation is dependent upon the terminal differentiation of muscle cells. Detection of the endogenous prothrombin mRNA in C2-myotubes but not in myoblasts is in agreement with the observation that the prothrombin promoter is active in C2-myotubes but not in C2-myoblasts. It has been shown that exogenously applied thrombin inhibitors can completely block activity-dependent synapse elimination in a nerve-muscle co-culture system (8Liu Y. Fields R.D. Festoff B.W. Nelson P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10300-10304Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and that cholinergic stimulation of aneural myotubes results in the augmentation of prothrombin mRNA expression (12Glazner G.W. Yadav K. Fitzgerald S. Coven E. Brenneman D.E. Nelson P.G. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 99: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It will thus be interesting to investigate whether thecis-acting sequence TTGATTC (−237 to −231), identified here to be critical for the transcription in differentiated muscle, can also confer activity-dependent regulation of the prothrombin gene in myotubes. We express our appreciation to Drs. Gretchen Gibney and James Brady for their critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2086527094,"Previous experiments using deletion mutants of the iron-sulfur protein had indicated that amino acid residues 138–153 might be involved in the assembly of this protein into the cytochromebc 1 complex. To determine which specific residues might be involved in the assembly process, charged amino acids located in the α1-β4 loop of the iron-sulfur protein were mutated to uncharged residues and tryptophan 152 to phenylalanine. The mutant genes were used to transform yeast cells (JPJ1) lacking the iron-sulfur protein gene. Mutants R146I and W152F had almost undetectable growth in medium containing glycerol/ethanol, whereas mutants D143A, K148I, and D149A grew more slowly than the wild type. Activity of the cytochromebc 1 complex was decreased 50, 90, 67, 89, and 90% in mutants D143A, R146I, K148I, D149A, and W152F, respectively, but unchanged in mutants D139A, Q141I, D145L, and V147S. In all of these mutants except W152F, the cytochrome c 1content, determined by immunoblotting, was comparable with that of wild-type cells. However, immunoblotting revealed that the content of the iron-sulfur protein was decreased proportionately in the five mutants with lowered enzymatic activity and growth suggesting that these amino acids are critical for maintaining the stability of the iron-sulfur protein. The efficiency of assembly in vitrocompared with the wild type determined by selective immunoprecipitation was unchanged in the mutants with the exception of R146I, D149A, and W152F where decreases of 80, 60, and 60%, respectively, were observed suggesting that these amino acids are critical for the proper assembly of the iron-sulfur protein into the bc 1complex.

The cytochrome bc 1complex 1The abbreviations used are: cytochromebc 1 complex, ubiquinol-cytochrome coxidoreductase; DBH2, 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; RIP, wild-type iron-sulfur protein gene; rip, mutant iron-sulfur protein gene. is an integral multiprotein complex of the inner mitochondrial membrane which catalyzes the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochromec coupled to the translocation of protons across the membrane (1Brandt U.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15341-15345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The bc 1 complex of yeast mitochondria consists of 10 subunits, of which 3 have prosthetic groups that serve as redox centers: cytochromes b andc 1 and the Rieske iron-sulfur protein. The iron-sulfur protein is an important component of the catalytic reaction center P of the bc 1 complex where it is involved in the transfer of electrons to cytochrome c 1from ubiquinol (2di Rago J.P. Bruel C. Graham L.A. Slonimski P. Trumpower B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15341-15345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Consistent with its catalytic function, the iron-sulfur protein is anchored on the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane where it protrudes into the intermembrane space (3Trumpower B.L. Gennis B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 675-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 4Sidhu A. Clejan L. Beattie D.S J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12308-12314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recent resolution of the crystal structure of the cytochrome bc 1 complex of beef heart mitochondria has revealed that the complex exists as a dimer with 13 membrane-spanning helices (5Xia D. Yu C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). With the exception of cytochrome b, the sole mitochondrial gene product of the bc 1 complex, all the subunits of this complex are synthesized on free cytoplasmic ribosomes and in a subsequent step imported into mitochondria where they are assembled into a functional complex in the membrane (6Beckman J.D. Ljungdahl P.O. Lopez J.L. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8901-8909PubMed Google Scholar). The iron-sulfur protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is synthesized as a precursor protein with a molecular mass of 29 kDa and possesses a 30-amino acid leader sequence at the amino terminus of the protein. The precursor form of the iron- sulfur protein is processedin vivo into the mature form through an intermediate form in two distinct processing events observed both in vitro andin vivo (7Fu W. Japa S. Beattie D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16541-16547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Graham L.A. Trumpower B.L J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22485-22492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of assembly of the subunits of the cytochromebc 1 complex and, in particular, that of the iron-sulfur protein has been the subject of several studies (9Fu W. Beattie D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16212-16218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Japa S. Beattie D.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 11Sidhu A. Beattie D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10649-10656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These investigations have led to the suggestion that the iron-sulfur protein may be one of the last proteins to become associated with a postulated “core” membrane-bound complex during mitochondrial biogenesis (11Sidhu A. Beattie D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10649-10656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Crivellone M.D. Wu M.A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14323-14333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies in our laboratory, the assembly of the iron-sulfur protein into the bc 1complex was investigated in vitro by using selective immunoprecipitation with antiserum against either the iron-sulfur protein or the intact bc 1 complex after import of radiolabeled precursor into mitochondria lacking the iron-sulfur protein (9Fu W. Beattie D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16212-16218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the import and assembly of 8 deletion mutants of the iron-sulfur protein into the bc 1complex was studied using this technique (13Ramabadran R.S. Japa S. Beattie D.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 14Obungu V. Yu L.P. Japa S. Beattie D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1321: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The results obtained in these studies indicated that the amino acids located in the extramembranous regions of the iron-sulfur protein might be involved in assembly with other subunits of the bc 1 complex. By contrast, the amino acid residues in the membranous region of the protein are apparently not required for the efficient assembly of the iron-sulfur protein into the bc 1 complex (14Obungu V. Yu L.P. Japa S. Beattie D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1321: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Further examination of one of these extramembranous regions containing amino acid residues 138–153 revealed the presence of 6 charged amino acids located in a loop connecting the α1 helix and the β4 sheet of a soluble fragment of the iron-sulfur protein from beef heart mitochondria (15Iwata S. Saynovtis M. Link T.A. Michel H. Structure. 1996; 4: 567-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). To determine the possible role of these charged amino acids in this region of the yeast iron-sulfur protein, which we assume has a similar if not identical structure, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of the charged amino acids present in this region. The effect of these mutations on the activity and the assembly of the iron-sulfur protein into the bc 1 complex has been examined. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Stratagene Quick ChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit. The codons for the selected amino acids in the predominantly charged α1-β4 loop of the iron-sulfur protein iron-sulfur protein were altered to encode the desired amino acids according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutations were performed using theRIP gene inserted in the single copy plasmid, pRG415; however, in some instances the mutations were performed in the high copy vector pSP64. When this plasmid was used, the mutantrip genes were subsequently subcloned into the pRG415 vector that was used to transform yeast cells. The mutant DNA, thus constructed, was analyzed by restriction enzyme analysis and by sequencing the mutated gene using the Cy5TM AutoCycle (or AutoRead) DNA sequencing kit for use with the Alf express automated sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This sequencing kit is based on the dideoxy chain termination method (16Sambrook J.E. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 13.3-13.10Google Scholar, 17Sanger F. Science. 1981; 214: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). DNA containing the wild-type RIP gene or the mutant rip genes was used to transform yeast cells (JPJ1), in which the RIP gene had been deleted, by the lithium acetate method (18Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as modified (19Dunn B. Szauter P. Pardue L. Szostak J.W. Cell. 1984; 39: 191-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Mutant yeast cells were selected by their ability to grow on a medium lacking uracil. To test for respiratory competence, the transformed JPJI colonies from the uracil minus plates were streaked on plates containing 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 3% glycerol, and 4% ethanol, pH 5.0, in 1.5% agar. The plates were incubated at both permissive (30 °C) and non-permissive (37 °C) temperatures. Subsequently, the transformed yeast cells were grown in the same liquid medium at 30 °C, and the rate of growth was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 650 nm over several hours. JPJI, the yeast strain lacking the RIP gene, was grown aerobically at 30 °C in a semi-synthetic medium as described previously (8Graham L.A. Trumpower B.L J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22485-22492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transformed cells were grown in a medium containing 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% galactose prior to mitochondrial isolation for enzymatic studies. In order to prepare mitochondria, yeast cells were grown to early logarithmic phase (A 650 = 0.9–1.2), harvested by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min at room temperature, and washed once with distilled water prior to mitochondrial isolation. For enzymatic and spectral analyses, yeast cells were broken using the modified glass bead method (2di Rago J.P. Bruel C. Graham L.A. Slonimski P. Trumpower B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15341-15345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); however, for import studies mitochondria was prepared from yeast digested with Zymolyase as described previously (14Obungu V. Yu L.P. Japa S. Beattie D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1321: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The activity of the cytochromebc 1 complex was determined by measuring the reduction of 40 μm horse heart ferricytochromec at 550–540 nm using the ubiquinol analog decylbenzoquinol (DBH2) as electron donor. The assay was performed at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, and 2 mm KCN. The non-enzymatic rate of cytochrome c reduction was determined by adding 33 μm DBH2 and allowing the reaction to proceed for 5 s after which the enzymatic reaction was initiated by addition of 0.1 mg of mitochondrial protein. The inhibition of enzymatic activity by antimycin A and myxothiazol was determined for each mutant. Optical spectra were recorded using the dual wavelength mode of the Aminco DW-2A spectrophotometer coupled to a recorder with reference beam set at 539 nm. Mitochondrial membranes were suspended at 2 mg/ml in 25 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% dodecyl maltoside, oxidized by ferricyanide, and then reduced by adding a few grains of sodium dithionite. The spectra of the oxidized cytochromes was subtracted from that of the reduced cytochromes to obtain the reduced versus oxidized difference spectra. The concentration of cytochromes was determined by using the following absorption coefficients and wavelength pairs for the reduced minus oxidized proteins; 20.9 mm−1 cm−1at 553–539 for cytochrome c-c 1 and 25.6 mm−1 cm−1 at 562–575 for cytochrome b (20Sen K. Beattie D.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 242: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant rip genes, inserted in the expression vector pSP64, were transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system from Promega. The expressed radiolabeled proteins were imported into mitochondria and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against the iron-sulfur protein and the intact cytochrome bc 1 complex as described previously (9Fu W. Beattie D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16212-16218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Obungu V. Yu L.P. Japa S. Beattie D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1321: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The mitochondria were then reisolated and the proteins separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were scanned and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) as described previously (14Obungu V. Yu L.P. Japa S. Beattie D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1321: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed using the ECL Western blotting system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Mitochondria were isolated from yeast cells and the proteins separated by SDS-PAGE prior to transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes. Primary antibodies raised against the iron-sulfur protein were used to locate the proteins immobilized on the membrane. These antibodies were subsequently detected by goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies labeled with horseradish peroxidase that catalyzes the oxidation of luminol, thereby emitting small but sustained quantities of light. The chemiluminescence was then specifically enhanced allowing an image to be recorded on a photosensitive film (Amersham ECL bulletin). Previous studies in our laboratory involving deletion mutants of the iron-sulfur protein had indicated that amino acid residues 138–153 might be involved in the interaction of this protein with other subunits during the assembly of the cytochromebc 1 complex (13Ramabadran R.S. Japa S. Beattie D.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 14Obungu V. Yu L.P. Japa S. Beattie D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1321: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a water-soluble fragment of the iron-sulfur protein from beef heart mitochondria had revealed that these residues are located in the predominantly charged α1-β4 loop on the surface of the protein (15Iwata S. Saynovtis M. Link T.A. Michel H. Structure. 1996; 4: 567-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In order to determine which of these residues might be specifically involved in the proposed interactions of the iron-sulfur protein with other proteins, site-directed mutagenesis of the following amino acids was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The acidic amino acids, Asp-139, -143, and -149, were mutated to alanine (D139A, D143A, D149A), and Asp-145 was mutated to leucine (D145L), whereas the basic amino acids, Arg-146 and Lys-148, were mutated to isoleucine (R146I, K148I). As a control, two uncharged amino acid residues (Gln-141 and Val-147) were mutated to isoleucine and serine, respectively (Q141I, V147S). In addition, Trp-152 was mutated to phenylalanine (W152F), as a previous study had reported that the W152R mutation resulted in a loss of enzymatic activity (21Graham L.A. Brandt U. Sargent J.S. Trumpower B.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The wild-type RIP gene and each of the mutant ripgenes were used to transform the JPJ1 strain of yeast cells, and growth was monitored on the non-fermentable carbon source glycerol/ethanol. After the initial screening on plates, the rate of growth of the transformed yeast cells was determined in liquid medium with the same carbon sources at 30 °C. JPJ1 cells transformed with the wild-typeRIP gene, indicated as wild type in TableI, grew with a doubling time of 2 h. Two of the mutants, R146I and W152F, had an almost undetectable growth rate calculated as doubling times of >12 and >10 h, respectively, whereas mutants D143A, K148I, and D149A grew more slowly than the wild type with doubling times of 3.5, 4, and 5 h, respectively. Growth of the remaining mutants, D139A, Q141I, D145L, and V147S, was identical to that of the wild-type cells.Table IGrowth characteristics, enzymatic activities, and cytochrome b and c 1 content in JPJ1 yeast cells transformed with the wild-type RIP and mutant rip genesMutantsDoubling timeEnzymatic activityConcentrationCytochromebCytochrome c-c 1hμmol/min/mg proteinnmol/mg proteinWild type2.00.930.0880.095D139A2.50.820.0740.086Q141I2.00.840.0730.095D143A3.50.470.0870.095D145L2.50.900.0860.090R146I>120.060.0600.090V147S2.00.940.0900.107K148I4.00.310.0800.092D149A5.00.100.0740.083W152F>100.0790.0520.067JPJ1No growth00.0410.074 Open table in a new tab The enzymatic activity of the cytochrome bc 1 complex was determined as DBH2 cytochrome c reductase to determine whether a lowered activity of the complex correlated with the decreased growth rates observed for some mutant cells. For these experiments, mitochondria were isolated from the transformed mutant yeast cells that had been grown in a medium containing galactose as carbon source. To confirm the enzymatic nature of the observed cytochrome creductase activity, the inhibitory effects of the specific inhibitors of the cytochrome bc 1 complex, antimycin A and myxothiazol, were determined. The cytochrome c reductase activity of the two mutants with very low rates of growth, R146I and W152F, was less than 10% of that observed with mitochondria from the wild-type cells (Table I). In addition, the enzymatic activity of the mutants D143A, K148I, and D149A was reduced approximately 50, 67, and 89%, respectively, compared with the wild type. The remaining mutants D139A, Q141I, D145L, and V147S retained enzymatic activity at wild-type levels. In general, these results demonstrate a good correlation between the observed reduction in the growth rate of these mutants in the glycerol/ethanol medium and the enzymatic activity of the cytochrome bc 1 complex. Our next approach was to investigate whether changes in the spectral properties or content of cytochromes b and c-c 1had occurred as a result of the mutations introduced into the iron-sulfur protein. Spectral analysis of the wild-type mitochondria, JPJ1 cells transformed with the wild-type RIP, is presented for comparison with several of the iron-sulfur protein mutants (Fig.1). The concentration of cytochromesb and c-c 1 in the wild-type mitochondria was determined to be 0.088 and 0.095 nmol/mg of protein, respectively (Table I). Examination of the spectra of the mutants revealed the presence of cytochromes c-c 1 at the same level as that of the wild-type cells with the exception of W152F in which the cytochrome c-c 1 content was diminished by 30%. By contrast, spectral analysis of mitochondria obtained from several of the mutants revealed significant changes in the spectra of cytochrome b leading to calculated decreases in the amount of cytochrome b present in the mitochondria (Fig. 1). For example, the iron-sulfur mutants D139A, Q141I, and D149A had 16–17% less cytochrome b heme than the wild type whereas the cytochrome b heme content was diminished by 32% in R146I and 41% in W152F. These values can be compared with the 53% decrease in cytochrome b heme observed in mitochondria isolated from JPJ1, the strain lacking the iron-sulfur protein. These reductions in the cytochrome b levels may reflect damage to the environment of the b hemes due either to the absence of the iron-sulfur protein or to a change in its conformation as a result of the specific amino acid mutation (8Graham L.A. Trumpower B.L J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22485-22492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The decreased levels of cytochrome b observed in several of these mutants rather than the actual mutation in the iron-sulfur protein may be responsible for the observed lowered enzymatic activity of the bc 1 complex in these mutants. To make this determination, the turnover numbers of thebc 1 complex in the various mutants were calculated as enzymatic activity (nmol of cytochrome creduced mg−1 of mitochondrial protein min−1)/the content of cytochrome b (nmol mg−1of mitochondrial protein) (Fig. 2). A similar pattern in the loss of enzymatic activity determined as turnover numbers was observed for the mutants in which the enzymatic activity was lowered. For example, the decrease in the turnover numbers was as follows: 50% for D143A, 90% for R146I, 60% for K148I, and 90% for D149A and W152F. The turnover numbers for the remaining mutants were not affected. These results indicate that the loss of enzymatic activity observed in these five mutants resulted from the mutations introduced into the iron-sulfur protein and not from a decreased level of cytochrome b. The observation that site-directed mutagenesis of several charged amino acids plus Trp-152 in the region containing residues 139–152 of the iron-sulfur protein resulted in a reduction in the enzymatic activity of the cytochromebc 1 complex prompted an investigation of the level of expression of the iron-sulfur protein in these mutants. The presence of the iron-sulfur protein in mitochondria isolated from these mutants was determined by Western blotting with an antibody against the iron-sulfur protein. As a control, the expression of cytochromec 1 in these mitochondria was compared on the same gel. Immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of the iron-sulfur protein in all of the mutants (Fig. 3,A and C); however, the levels of expression of the iron-sulfur protein were considerably lower in the mutants D143A, R146I, K148I, and D149A when compared with the wild-type levels. By contrast, the levels of cytochrome c 1 determined by immunoblotting with the antibody against cytochromec 1 were unaffected in the mutants (Fig. 3,B and D). These results indicate that mutating two acidic amino acids, Asp-143 and Asp-149, two basic amino acids, Arg-146 and Lys-148, and the aromatic residue, Trp-152, results in varying decreases in the levels of the iron-sulfur protein observedin vivo, perhaps resulting from a decreased expression of the protein or from an increased instability of the protein. For example, removal of the charges in this region of the iron-sulfur protein or changing the tryptophan moiety through mutagenesis may result in the formation of an unstable protein that is degraded soon after translation. The decreased amounts of the iron-sulfur protein observed in several of the mutants prompted us to investigate whether the import into mitochondria of these mutant proteins and their subsequent assembly into thebc 1 complex were affected by the mutations. The import and assembly of the iron-sulfur protein were determined in vitro after transcription and translation of these ripgenes inserted into the high copy pSP64 plasmid. After coupled transcription/translation in vitro, the radiolabeled precursors of the mutant and the wild-type iron-sulfur protein were all imported efficiently into the mitochondria isolated from yeast strain JPJ1, where they underwent the identical two-step cleavage process (Fig. 4). These results indicate that the mutations introduced into the iron-sulfur protein had no effect on the import and processing of the respective precursor proteins. The assembly of the wild-type and mutant iron-sulfur proteins into the cytochrome bc 1 complex was investigated in vitro using selective immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies. The procedure is based on the principle that radiolabeled precursor and mature forms of the iron-sulfur protein can be immunoprecipitated with antiserum against the wild-type iron-sulfur protein; however, the precursor form of the iron-sulfur protein cannot be immunoprecipitated by the antiserum raised against the intact complex III (13Ramabadran R.S. Japa S. Beattie D.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 14Obungu V. Yu L.P. Japa S. Beattie D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1321: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Moreover, this antibody does not recognize the iron-sulfur proteins in immunoblots of mitochondrial membranes. Consequently, the immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled iron-sulfur protein with the antiserum against complex III after import reflects the assembly of the iron-sulfur protein with other subunits of thebc 1 complex recognized by the complex III antiserum. The efficiency of assembly of the wild-type and mutant iron-sulfur proteins was determined by dividing the radioactivity immunoprecipitated by the antiserum against complex III by that immunoprecipitated by the antiserum against the iron-sulfur protein, assumed to represent the total amount of the protein imported into mitochondria (Fig. 5). Slight variations in the efficiency of assembly of the various mutants were observed (Fig. 6); however, the most significant effects were noted with the following mutants: an 80% decrease in R146I and a 60% decrease in both D149A and W152F. These results suggest that certain amino acids, especially Arg-146, Asp-149, and Trp-152, present in the α1-β4 loop of the iron-sulfur protein, may be critical for the efficient assembly of this protein into thebc 1 complex.Figure 6Efficiency of assembly of the mutant iron-sulfur proteins into the cytochrome bc 1 complex of mitochondria from JPJ1. The relative radioactivities of the mature forms of the mutant and wild-type iron-sulfur proteins assembled into the bc 1complex were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. The percentages indicate the value of normalized immunoprecipitates divided by that of the wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the current study, we have investigated the role of charged amino acids located in the α1-β4 loop of the iron-sulfur protein on the activity and assembly of the yeast cytochromebc 1 complex. These parameters were examined in mutants in which six charged amino acids in this region were changed to uncharged residues, and the tryptophan at position 152 at the base of the β4 sheet was changed to a phenylalanine. Four of these mutants, D143A, R146I, K148I, and D149A, as well as the W152F mutant grew more slowly than the wild type, whereas growth of two of the mutants, D139A and D145L, was unaffected. A corresponding decrease in the enzymatic activity of the bc 1 complex was observed in all of these mutants suggesting that the slower rate of growth reflected a lowered activity of the bc 1 complex. For example, the two mutants with a barely detectable growth rate, R146I and W152F, had enzymatic activities less than 10% that of the wild type (Table I). Spectral analysis of cytochrome b andc-c 1 in the mutant mitochondria and the subsequent determination of turnover numbers indicated that the reduction in the activity of the bc 1 complex did not result from a decrease in the levels of the two cytochromes. Indeed, Western blot analysis of mitochondrial proteins from these mutants revealed that the loss of enzymatic activity of thebc 1 complex was correlated with a decreased level of expression of the iron-sulfur protein in these mutants. For example, three of the slowest growing mutants, R146I, D149A, and W152F, with corresponding very low enzymatic activity had the lowest levels of the iron-sulfur protein; however, those mutants with moderately reduced growth rates and enzymatic activities, D143A and K148I, had a corresponding greater level of immunodetectable iron-sulfur protein. The lowered levels of the iron-sulfur protein in these mutants indicate that four of the charged amino acids in the α1-β4 loop of the protein plus the tryptophan at residue 152 are necessary for expression of the iron-sulfur protein in vivo. These charged residues and Trp-152 may be crucial in maintaining the overall stability of the protein such that when these amino acids are mutated, the resulting iron-sulfur protein may become unstable. Such an unstable protein might be degraded soon after translation in the cytosol or during its import into mitochondria. Alternately, the mutated protein might not assemble efficiently into the bc 1 complex resulting in its subsequent degradation in the mitochondria. To distinguish among these possibilities, the effect of these mutations on the import and assembly of the mutated iron-sulfur proteins into the cytochromebc 1 complex was investigated in vitro. None of these mutations of the iron-sulfur protein had any effect on the import of the mutated proteins into mitochondria in vitro or on the subsequent two-step processing of the precursor to the mature form in the mitochondrial matrix. By contrast, differences in the efficiency of assembly in vitro of the five mutations that affect growth and activity were observed. Three of the mutants, R146I, D149A, and W152F, were assembled into thebc 1 complex with very low efficiency when compared with the wild type. It should also be noted that these three mutations resulted in the most severe effects on growth and enzymatic activity of the cytochrome bc 1 complex. We suggest that Arg-146, Asp-149, and Trp-152 may be involved in establishing the conformation of the iron-sulfur protein necessary for its efficient assembly with the other proteins in thebc 1 complex. The charged amino acids may form hydrogen bonds or salt bridges with other charged amino acids to maintain the α1-β4 loop in its extended conformation, whereas the location of Trp-152 at the base of the β4 sheet may be critical for the overall conformation of the protein. Recent reports have indicated that mutations of the iron-sulfur protein of Rhodobacter capsulatus also affect the conformation of the iron-sulfur protein and consequently its stability (22Liebl U. Sled V. Brasseur G. Ohnishi T. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11675-11684Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). By contrast, two of the mutants with lower enzymatic activity and decreased levels of the iron-sulfur protein in vivo, D143A and K148I, assembled into the bc 1 complexin vitro almost as efficiently as the wild-type protein. It should be noted that the effects of these mutations on the enzymatic activity of the bc 1 complex and the mitochondrial content of the iron-sulfur protein in vivowere moderate in comparison with the mutations in Arg-146, Asp-149, and Trp-152. We suggest that the charged amino acids Asp-143 and Lys-148 may not affect the conformation of the protein and its assembly into the bc 1 complex; however, these charged amino acids may be necessary for maintaining the stability of the iron-sulfur protein. Consequently, mutating them to uncharged amino acids may have led to a partial degradation of the mutated iron-sulfur protein during or soon after its translation on cytosolic ribosomes. In conclusion, we suggest that several charged amino acids and Trp-152 located in the α1-β4 loop of the iron-sulfur protein of the yeast cytochrome bc 1 complex are required to maintain the stability of the protein in vivo. As a consequence of this instability, lowered levels of the iron-sulfur protein were observed in vivo resulting in a decreased activity of thebc 1 complex and slower growth of the cells. Currently, we are extending these investigations to mutations of charged amino acids located in the α1 helix of the iron-sulfur protein to obtain further evidence in support of this suggestion."
