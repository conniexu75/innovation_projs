https://openalex.org/W2071587489,"Rhizomes of stinging nettle contain a small-sized lectin that exhibits binding specificity toward chitin. This lectin inhibits growth of several phytopathogenic and saprophytic chitin-containing fungi in vitro. The antifungal action of the nettle lectin differs from the action of chitinases, which are a ubiquitous class of antifungal plant proteins. Moreover, the nettle lectin acts synergistically with chitinase in inhibiting fungal growth. The nettle lectin may be a promising candidate for possible applications in the genetic engineering of disease-resistant crops."
https://openalex.org/W2036413971,The quantitative assessment of underplating and concomitant partial melting of continental crust requires the use of geologically reasonable melt fraction distributions as a function of temperature. Conductive modeling indicates that simple underplating of metapelite by basalt can yield magma bodies with melt fractions above the rheological limit of extraction for almost any reasonable geotherm. Convection and subsequent homogenization are likely in these bodies. Granitic and tonalitic protoliths do not appear to yield substantial amounts of extractable magma. These results indicate that underplating involves repeated intrusion or occurs in deep crust.
https://openalex.org/W2001472679,"The unambiguous structural characterization of a single-sized all-carbon molecule requires its chemical synthesis. For cyclo[18]carbon, ab initio calculations predict a relatively stable, cyclic D9h ground state geometry with alternating C-C (1.36 angstroms) and C identical withC (1.20 angstroms) bonds. The synthesis and x-ray crystal structure of a direct precursor to C(18) are described. The analysis of laser flash heating experiments on this precursor by time-of-flight mass spectroscopy shows a sequence of retro-Diels-Alder reactions leading to C(18) as the predominant fragmentation pattern. Structural evidence is provided for the generation of an all-carbon molecule from a well-characterized organic precursor."

The rhythm of sperm release was shown to persist in vitro, in isolated complexes of testis and seminal ducts cultured in light-dark cycles or in constant darkness. The phase of the rhythm was also reset in vitro by exposure to shifted light-dark cycles. Therefore, the testisâ€”seminal ducts complex from the gypsy moth is photosensitive and contains a circadian pacemaker, which controls the rhythm of sperm movement. This finding extends the range of structures in multicellular organisms that are known to contain circadian oscillators and provides a new model system in which circadian mechanisms may be studied."
https://openalex.org/W1986393389,"Modern potash salt deposits and associated brines of the Qaidam Basin, western China, demonstrate that some anomalous marine evaporites may have formed from nonmarine brines instead of seawater. Qaidam Basin brines are derived from meteoric river inflow mixed with small amounts of CaCl spring inflow similar in composition to many saline formation waters and hydrothermal brines. Evaporation of springenriched inflow yields a predicted mineral sequence including carnallite, bischofite, and tachyhydrite that is identical to several anomalous marine evaporites. Other mixtures of river and spring inflow produce the salt assemblage expected from evaporation of seawater."

In understanding why, it is important to recognize the reasons for poverty among children in both two-parent working poor families and single-parent families. Examination of the evidence suggests that family poverty basically reflects the economic and social changes that affect most United States families."
