Carnitine acetyl transferase (E.C.2.3.1.7) has recently been partly purified from pig heart2. The existence of a carnitine palmitoyl transferase, distinct from the acetyl transferase, has been shown3,5, and it has been suggested4,5 that acyl-carnitine compounds might play a part in the transfer of activated acyl-groups across the mitochondrial membrane. Intracellular levels of acyl-carnitinecompounds might be expected to be influenced by conditions known to affect the tissue levels of acyl-coenzyme A compounds6,7."

Vascular smooth muscle is generally considered to be of the multi-unit type and to be devoid of spontaneous conducted activity. It was thought that the spontaneously active anterior mesenteric vein strip might prove a suitable tissue for investigating the electrical activity of vascular tissue."

https://openalex.org/W1996611625,"DESPITE the prevailing interest in the redox potentials of biological systems1 there still does not appear to exist in the literature a satisfactory experimental demonstration of a functionally active electron transport system in the blood. Published evidence2 provides no adequate or conclusive proof since most of the findings can be criticized, among other things, for the failure to keep the temperature of the blood samples within the biological range, and for the crucial omission of ascertaining the reliability and consistency of the readings, for example, through the use, simultaneously, of multiple electrodes. These and other shortcomings have been corrected in our investigations, which lend support to the view that an accurately measurable and reproducible redox potential of a blood sample can indeed be obtained. The following is submitted as an illustration."
