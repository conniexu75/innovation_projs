The mechanism by which B cells are selected remains unclear, as does the role of the two anatomically defined areas of the GC, light zone (LZ) and dark zone (DZ). We combined a transgenic photoactivatable fluorescent protein tracer with multiphoton laser-scanning microscopy and flow cytometry to examine anatomically defined LZ and DZ B cells and GC selection. We find that B cell division is restricted to the DZ, with a net vector of B cell movement from the DZ to the LZ. The decision to return to the DZ and undergo clonal expansion is controlled by T helper cells in the GC LZ, which discern between LZ B cells based on the amount of antigen captured and presented. Thus, T cell help, and not direct competition for antigen, is the limiting factor in GC selection.PaperClip/cms/asset/4dd31600-d8a4-4a48-b398-f0e2a1f11fac/mmc11.mp3Loading ...(mp3, 2.85 MB) Download audio"

https://openalex.org/W2152294605,"The balance between cellular proliferation and differentiation is a key aspect of development in multicellular organisms. Using high-resolution expression data from the Arabidopsis root, we identified a transcription factor, UPBEAT1 (UPB1), that regulates this balance. Genomewide expression profiling coupled with ChIP-chip analysis revealed that UPB1 directly regulates the expression of a set of peroxidases that modulate the balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) between the zones of cell proliferation and the zone of cell elongation where differentiation begins. Disruption of UPB1 activity alters this ROS balance, leading to a delay in the onset of differentiation. Modulation of either ROS balance or peroxidase activity through chemical reagents affects the onset of differentiation in a manner consistent with the postulated UPB1 function. This pathway functions independently of auxin and cytokinin plant hormonal signaling. Comparison to ROS-regulated growth control in animals suggests that a similar mechanism is used in plants and animals."

https://openalex.org/W2062886649,"Genetic variants at the FTO gene are associated with obesity in humans. Now, Roger Cox and colleagues analyze mice globally overexpressing Fto and show that increased Fto expression leads to obesity in mice. Genome-wide association studies have identified SNPs within FTO, the human fat mass and obesity–associated gene, that are strongly associated with obesity. Individuals homozygous for the at-risk rs9939609 A allele weigh, on average, ∼3 kg more than individuals with the low-risk T allele. Mice that lack FTO function and/or Fto expression display increased energy expenditure and a lean phenotype. We show here that ubiquitous overexpression of Fto leads to a dose-dependent increase in body and fat mass, irrespective of whether mice are fed a standard or a high-fat diet. Our results suggest that increased body mass results primarily from increased food intake. Mice with increased Fto expression on a high-fat diet develop glucose intolerance. This study provides the first direct evidence that increased Fto expression causes obesity in mice."
https://openalex.org/W1996813139,"Metazoan transcription is controlled through either coordinated recruitment of transcription machinery to the gene promoter or regulated pausing of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in early elongation. We report that a striking difference between genes that use these distinct regulatory strategies lies in the ""default"" chromatin architecture specified by their DNA sequences. Pol II pausing is prominent at highly regulated genes whose sequences inherently disfavor nucleosome formation within the gene but favor occlusion of the promoter by nucleosomes. In contrast, housekeeping genes that lack pronounced Pol II pausing show higher nucleosome occupancy downstream, but their promoters are deprived of nucleosomes regardless of polymerase binding. Our results indicate that a key role of paused Pol II is to compete with nucleosomes for occupancy of highly regulated promoters, thereby preventing the formation of repressive chromatin architecture to facilitate further or future gene activation."
https://openalex.org/W2070927743,"Worldwide, acute, and chronic pain affects 20% of the adult population and represents an enormous financial and emotional burden. Using genome-wide neuronal-specific RNAi knockdown in Drosophila, we report a global screen for an innate behavior and identify hundreds of genes implicated in heat nociception, including the α2δ family calcium channel subunit straightjacket (stj). Mice mutant for the stj ortholog CACNA2D3 (α2δ3) also exhibit impaired behavioral heat pain sensitivity. In addition, in humans, α2δ3 SNP variants associate with reduced sensitivity to acute noxious heat and chronic back pain. Functional imaging in α2δ3 mutant mice revealed impaired transmission of thermal pain-evoked signals from the thalamus to higher-order pain centers. Intriguingly, in α2δ3 mutant mice, thermal pain and tactile stimulation triggered strong cross-activation, or synesthesia, of brain regions involved in vision, olfaction, and hearing."

Although this modification has been shown to be reversible, little is known about the enzymes catalyzing deglutamylation. Here we describe the enzymatic mechanism of protein deglutamylation by members of the cytosolic carboxypeptidase (CCP) family. Three enzymes (CCP1, CCP4, and CCP6) catalyze the shortening of polyglutamate chains and a fourth (CCP5) specifically removes the branching point glutamates. In addition, CCP1, CCP4, and CCP6 also remove gene-encoded glutamates from the carboxyl termini of proteins. Accordingly, we show that these enzymes convert detyrosinated tubulin into Δ2-tubulin and also modify other substrates, including myosin light chain kinase 1. We further analyze Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) mice that lack functional CCP1 and show that microtubule hyperglutamylation is directly linked to neurodegeneration. Taken together, our results reveal that controlling the length of the polyglutamate side chains on tubulin is critical for neuronal survival.

This modification has been initially discovered on α- and β-tubulin, the building blocks of microtubules (MTs; Eddé et al., 1990Eddé B. Rossier J. Le Caer J.P. Desbruyeres E. Gros F. Denoulet P.

Polyglutamylation levels are particularly high on stable MT assemblies such as the ones found in neurons (Audebert et al., 1993Audebert S. Desbruyeres E. Gruszczynski C. Koulakoff A. Gros F.

Tubulins are polyglutamylated at their carboxy-terminal tails, which upon assembly of MTs become exposed on the outer surface of the tubules, where they provide binding sites for several MT-associated proteins (MAPs) and molecular motors. Accordingly, MT polyglutamylation has recently been shown to regulate the activity of ciliary dynein (Kubo et al., 2010Kubo T. Yanagisawa H.-a. Yagi T. Hirono M. Kamiya R.

Cell Biol. 2010; 189: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The enzymes that catalyze polyglutamylation, polyglutamylases, are members of a protein family sharing a homology domain with another tubulin-modifying enzyme, tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL; Ersfeld et al., 1993Ersfeld K. Wehland J. Plessmann U. Dodemont H. Gerke V. Weber K. Characterization of the tubulin-tyrosine ligase.J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and thus are referred to as TTL-like (TTLL) proteins (Janke et al., 2005Janke C. Rogowski K. Wloga D. Regnard C. Kajava A.V. Strub J.-M. Temurak N. van Dijk J.

Cell. 2007; 26: 437-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Initial functional studies on polyglutamylases provided first evidence that polyglutamylation plays important roles in vivo. Mice knocked out for TTLL1 polyglutamylase display abnormal beating of airway epithelial cilia leading to respiratory problems (Ikegami et al., 2010Ikegami K. Sato S. Nakamura K. Ostrowski L.E. Setou M. Tubulin polyglutamylation is essential for airway ciliary function through the regulation of beating asymmetry.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 10490-10495Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Another polyglutamylase, TTLL6, was also shown to play a role in cilia. Depletion of this enzyme in zebrafish reduced glutamylation in the olfactory placodes resulting in defective assembly of olfactory cilia (Pathak et al., 2007Pathak N. Obara T. Mangos S. Liu Y. Drummond I.A. The zebrafish fleer gene encodes an essential regulator of cilia tubulin polyglutamylation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 4353-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, also overexpression of TTLL6 enzyme, which caused abnormal elongation of glutamate chains, produced ciliary defects in Tetrahymena (Janke et al., 2005Janke C. Rogowski K. Wloga D. Regnard C. Kajava A.V. Strub J.-M. Temurak N. van Dijk J.

Cell. 2009; 9: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Taken together, this suggests that maintaining the correct levels of tubulin polyglutamylation by the coordinated action of polyglutamylases and deglutamylating enzymes is essential. The aim of the present work was to identify deglutamylating enzymes and analyze their functions in vivo. Recent studies of a family of cytosolic carboxypeptidases (CCPs) have suggested that one of the members of this family, CCP1 (also known as Nna1), is the enzyme that removes the C-terminal tyrosine from α-tubulin (Kalinina et al., 2007Kalinina E. Biswas R. Berezniuk I. Hermoso A. Aviles F.X. Fricker L.D. A novel subfamily of mouse cytosolic carboxypeptidases.FASEB J. 2007; 21: 836-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, Rodriguez de la Vega et al., 2007Rodriguez de la Vega M. Sevilla R.G. Hermoso A. Lorenzo J. Tanco S. Diez A. Fricker L.D. Bautista J.M. Aviles F.X. Nna1-like proteins are active metallocarboxypeptidases of a new and diverse M14 subfamily.FASEB J. 2007; 21: 851-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); however convincing evidence has not been provided. The possibility that CCP1 is involved in tubulin modifications was exciting because loss of function of CCP1 had been associated with the phenotypes observed in Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) mice (Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2002Fernandez-Gonzalez A. La Spada A.R. Treadaway J. Higdon J.C. Harris B.S. Sidman R.L. Morgan J.I. Zuo J. Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) phenotypes caused by mutations in the axotomy-induced gene, Nna1.Science. 2002; 295: 1904-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). pcd mice display multiple defects including degeneration of several types of neurons. The first neurons to be lost are Purkinje cells, which die during early adulthood leading to ataxia. The loss of Purkinje cells is followed by degeneration of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs), and later some populations of thalamic neurons also disappear (Mullen et al., 1976Mullen R.J. Eicher E.M. Sidman R.L. Purkinje cell degeneration, a new neurological mutation in the mouse.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1976; 73: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Moreover, mitral cells from the olfactory bulb as well as retinal photoreceptors degenerate progressively over 1 year. Finally, the males are sterile and the females experience difficulties giving birth (reviewed in Wang and Morgan, 2007Wang T. Morgan J.I. The Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) mouse: an unexpected molecular link between neuronal degeneration and regeneration.Brain Res. 2007; 1140: 26-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrated that Purkinje cell loss as well as retinal degeneration observed in the pcd mice could be rescued by wild-type (WT) CCP1 but not an inactive CCP1 (Chakrabarti et al., 2008Chakrabarti L. Eng J. Martinez R.A. Jackson S. Huang J. Possin D.E. Sopher B.L. La Spada A.R. The zinc-binding domain of Nna1 is required to prevent retinal photoreceptor loss and cerebellar ataxia in Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) mice.Vision Res. 2008; 48: 1999-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2006Wang T. Parris J. Li L. Morgan J.I. The carboxypeptidase-like substrate-binding site in Nna1 is essential for the rescue of the Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) phenotype.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 33: 200-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This demonstrated that the lack of CCP1 carboxypeptidase activity is responsible for the phenotypes observed in the pcd mice; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the numerous defects remain unclear. Here, we show that CCP1 specifically catalyzes the removal of the penultimate glutamate residue from detyrosinated α-tubulin, thus generating Δ2-tubulin; however, it is not involved in detyrosination itself. Moreover, we demonstrate that the removal of gene-encoded glutamic acids from the C termini of proteins is not specific to tubulin but affects a range of substrates including myosin light chain kinase 1 (MLCK1). Apart from the deglutamylation of protein primary sequence, CCP1 also shortens posttranslationally generated glutamate side chains on tubulin and is therefore a tubulin deglutamylase. We further demonstrate the existence of two functional homologs of CCP1, CCP4, and CCP6, and we provide evidence that another recently described deglutamylating enzyme, CCP5 (Kimura et al., 2010Kimura Y. Kurabe N. Ikegami K. Tsutsumi K. Konishi Y. Kaplan O.I. Kunitomo H. Iino Y. Blacque O.E. Setou M. Identification of tubulin deglutamylase among Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian cytosolic carboxypeptidases (CCPs).J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22936-22941Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), specifically removes the branching point glutamates generated by polyglutamylation. Finally, we have analyzed the neurodegeneration phenotype in the pcd mice in light of the newly identified deglutamylating activity of CCP1. Consistent with the enzymatic activity of CCP1, we show that tubulin polyglutamylation is highly increased specifically in brain areas that degenerate in the pcd mice. Moreover, by downregulating polyglutamylation, we were able to partially prevent neurodegeneration, providing direct evidence that abnormally high polyglutamylation levels lead to neuronal degeneration. Recent studies have suggested that CCP1 is involved in α-tubulin detyrosination (Kalinina et al., 2007Kalinina E. Biswas R. Berezniuk I. Hermoso A. Aviles F.X. Fricker L.D. A novel subfamily of mouse cytosolic carboxypeptidases.FASEB J. 2007; 21: 836-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To directly test this idea, we performed immunoblot analysis of protein extracts prepared from HEK293 cells expressing either active or enzymatically inactive (dead, Figure S1 available online) murine CCP1. Although we did not observe any increase in the level of tubulin detyrosination, we detected an ectopic appearance of a related tubulin modification, Δ2-tubulin (Paturle-Lafanechere et al., 1991Paturle-Lafanechere L. Eddé B. Denoulet P. Van Dorsselaer A. Mazarguil H. Le Caer J.P. Wehland J. Job D. Characterization of a major brain tubulin variant which cannot be tyrosinated.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10523-10528Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, CCP1 seems to catalyze the removal of the penultimate glutamate residue, but not detyrosination itself. To further test whether CCP1 is specifically generating Δ2-tubulin, we expressed this protein in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and stained the cells with antibodies for tyrosinated and Δ2-tubulin. There was no obvious reduction in the level of tyrosinated tubulin, but we observed a strong increase in the labeling for Δ2-tubulin specifically in cells expressing CCP1 (Figure 1B ). This increase in the level of Δ2-tubulin was not observed when the enzymatically dead version of CCP1 was expressed (Figure S2A ). Taken together these results demonstrate that CCP1 catalyzes the removal of the very C-terminal glutamate residue from detyrosinated α-tubulin, but it is not involved in α-tubulin detyrosination.Figure 1Enzymatic Characterization of CCP1Show full caption(A) Immunoblot of protein extracts from HEK293 cells expressing active (EYFP-CCP1) or inactive (EYFP-CCP1d) CCP1.(B) Immunofluorescence of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) expressing EGFP-CCP1.

This demonstrates that purified, recombinant CCP1 can remove long, but not short glutamate chains from purified brain tubulin. Considering that CCP1 was associated with α-tubulin primary sequence deglutamylation, we speculated that it might also catalyze the removal of glutamate side chains, which are added to α- and β-tubulin as a result of posttranslational polyglutamylation (Eddé et al., 1990Eddé B. Rossier J. Le Caer J.P. Desbruyeres E. Gros F. Denoulet P. Posttranslational glutamylation of alpha-tubulin.Science. 1990; 247: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, Rüdiger et al., 1992Rüdiger M. Plessman U. Kloppel K.D. Wehland J. Weber K.

To test this hypothesis, we expressed CCP1 in neurons, which are known to carry a high level of tubulin polyglutamylation (Audebert et al., 1993Audebert S. Desbruyeres E. Gruszczynski C. Koulakoff A. Gros F. Denoulet P. Eddé B. Reversible polyglutamylation of alpha- and beta-tubulin and microtubule dynamics in mouse brain neurons.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and labeled them with polyE antibody that recognizes glutamate chains composed of at least three glutamic acids (Figure S3). Neurons expressing active but not inactive CCP1 showed a strong reduction in the level of polyE signal (Figure 1C and Figure S2B). These results show that CCP1 is indeed involved in the removal of posttranslational polyglutamylation. To further characterize the deglutamylation activity of CCP1, we set up an in vitro deglutamylation assay in which highly polyglutamylated brain tubulin was incubated with protein extract from HEK293 cells expressing either active or inactive CCP1. The status of polyglutamylation was examined with two polyglutamylation-specific antibodies: polyE that recognizes long glutamate side chains, and GT335 that recognizes all glutamylated forms of tubulin because it is specific to the branching point of the glutamate side chain (Wolff et al., 1992Wolff A. de Nechaud B. Chillet D. Mazarguil H. Desbruyeres E. Audebert S. Eddé B. Gros F. Denoulet P. Distribution of glutamylated alpha and beta-tubulin in mouse tissues using a specific monoclonal antibody, GT335.Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 425-432PubMed Google Scholar). In combination, these two antibodies allowed us to distinguish between tubulin carrying either short or long glutamate side chains. Brain tubulin treated with active CCP1 was no longer detected by polyE antibodies, while the GT335 signal was not decreased (Figure 1D). This indicated that CCP1 shortens the glutamate side chains of brain tubulin without removing the branching point glutamates. Similar results were obtained with purified 6His-CCP1, confirming that CCP1 directly catalyzes tubulin deglutamylation (Figures S2C and S2D). To further investigate the enzymatic specificity of CCP1 for long side chains, we assayed the enzyme with mono- or polyglutamylated tubulin purified from HeLa cells after overexpression of different TTLL glutamylating enzymes (van Dijk et al., 2007van Dijk J. Rogowski K. Miro J. Lacroix B. Eddé B. Janke C. A targeted multienzyme mechanism for selective microtubule polyglutamylation.Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 437-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). When monoglutamylated tubulin (modified by TTLL4) was incubated with active CCP1, no changes in glutamylation levels were observed, indicating that CCP1 cannot remove the short side chains generated by TTLL4 (Figure 1D). Surprisingly, when tubulin polyglutamylated with TTLL6 was incubated with CCP1, a strong reduction in both polyE and GT335 signals was observed (Figure 1D). This indicated that besides shortening the polyglutamate side chains, CCP1 also removes the branching point glutamates when the glutamylation is generated by TTLL6 but not by TTLL4 or by TTLL1, which generates most of the glutamylation present on brain MTs (Janke et al., 2005Janke C. Rogowski K. Wloga D. Regnard C. Kajava A.V. Strub J.-M. Temurak N. van Dijk J. Boucher D. van Dorsselaer A. et al.Tubulin polyglutamylase enzymes are members of the TTL domain protein family.Science. 2005; 308: 1758-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To validate that the removal of the branching point glutamates by CCP1 depends on the enzyme that has generated glutamylation in the first place, we set up cotransfection experiments. CCP1 was coexpressed together with TTLL4 or TTLL6 in HEK293 cells, and the cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblot. In agreement with our in vitro data, expression of CCP1 had no effect on the glutamylation status of tubulin and other proteins that are modified by TTLL4. In contrast, CCP1 blocked the accumulation of both mono- and polyglutamylation on TTLL6 substrates, which include tubulins and TTLL6 itself (Figure 1E). These results confirmed that CCP1, in addition to shortening long glutamate chains, also removes the branching point glutamates when the modification is generated by TTLL6 but not TTLL4. To study the role of CCP1 in vivo, we took advantage of Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd3J) mice in which a deletion in the CCP1 gene results in loss of function of the CCP1 protein (Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2002Fernandez-Gonzalez A. La Spada A.R. Treadaway J. Higdon J.C. Harris B.S. Sidman R.L. Morgan J.I. Zuo J. Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) phenotypes caused by mutations in the axotomy-induced gene, Nna1.Science. 2002; 295: 1904-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Based on our discovery of the deglutamylating activity of CCP1 we expected the absence of Δ2-tubulin and increased tubulin polyglutamylation in the pcd mice. To test our predictions we compared the status of tubulin modifications between pcd and WT mice. Protein extracts from several organs were analyzed by immunoblot with antibodies recognizing either the unmodified C-terminal α-tubulin tail (tyrosinated tubulin) or its processed versions (detyrosinated or Δ2-tubulin), as well as with polyE antibodies specific to long glutamate chains. When comparing the levels of tyrosinated and detyrosinated tubulin between pcd and WT mice, we observed no differences in all organs analyzed. Surprisingly, the Δ2-tubulin modification was also unchanged in most of the organs except skeletal muscles, where we detected a strong reduction (Figure 2A ). This confirmed that CCP1 is involved in generating Δ2-tubulin in vivo, but at the same time it implied the existence of additional enzyme(s) catalyzing this modification. Tubulin polyglutamylation, for which we expected an increase in the pcd mice, at least in the organs where tubulin glutamylases are highly expressed such as brain and testes, was indeed slightly increased relative to the equal levels of tyrosinated tubulin in these two organs (Figure 2A). These results are in agreement with CCP1 being involved in the removal of posttranslational tubulin polyglutamylation. In contrast to mostly slight changes in the levels of tubulin posttranslational modifications observed in the pcd mice, we detected protein bands outside of the tubulin region that reacted with anti-Δ2-tubulin exclusively in the WT mice. Conversely, bands of corresponding size were labeled by detyrosinated or polyE antibodies in the pcd mice (Figure 2A). This suggested the existence of proteins that end with a -GEn sequence at their C termini, which is recognized in the pcd mice with polyE (if n ≥ 3) or with detyrosinated antibody (if n = 2). However, in WT mice, both types of proteins have C termini shortened to -GE (specifically detected with anti-Δ2-tubulin antibody), most likely by the enzymatic activity of CCP1. Thus, C-terminal deglutamylation seems to be a modification that is not restricted to tubulin. Two of the potential CCP1 substrates (∼130 kDa and ∼20 kDa) were prominent in stomach and one (∼130 kDa) in the uterus (Figure 2A). In order to identify these substrates, we prepared protein extract from mouse stomach and analyzed the two anti-Δ2-reactive bands by mass spectrometry. Several proteins were identified (Table S2 and Table S3), but only two appeared as promising candidates for being processed by CCP1. Myosin light chain kinase 1 (130 kDa MLCK1) and telokin, a 17 kDa protein corresponding to the C-terminal fragment of MLCK1 (Smith et al., 1998Smith A.F. Bigsby R.M. Word R.A. Herring B.P.

The process is called ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) and is conserved in all eukaryotes. In S. cerevisiae, substrates use three ERAD pathways (ERAD-L, -M, and -C), depending on whether their misfolded domain is located in the ER lumen, in the ER membrane, or on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane (Carvalho et al., 2006Carvalho P.

ERAD-M requires only a subset of these components. Finally, ERAD-C uses a different ubiquitin ligase (Doa10p) (Swanson et al., 2001Swanson R. Locher M. Hochstrasser M.

Although most, if not all, components have been identified, the molecular mechanisms of the ERAD pathways remain unclear. Some insight exists into the events that occur during ERAD-L on the luminal and cytoplasmic sides of the ER membrane. Misfolded, glycosylated ERAD-L substrates are initially recognized in the ER lumen. Their prolonged residence time in the ER results in the processing of their carbohydrate moiety to generate a terminal α1,6 mannose residue (Bhamidipati et al., 2005Bhamidipati A. Denic V. Quan E.M.

This sugar, together with the unfolded polypeptide segment surrounding the carbohydrate attachment site, constitutes the degradation signal (Xie et al., 2009Xie W. Kanehara K. Sayeed A. Ng D.T.

Cell. 2009; 20: 3317-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The signal is then recognized through a luminal domain of Hrd3p as well as the lectin Yos9p (Denic et al., 2006Denic V. Quan E.M.

Once the substrate appears on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane, the RING finger domain of Hrd1p, together with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc7p or Ubc1p, catalyze polyubiquitination (Bays et al., 2001aBays N.W.

The modified substrate is then recognized by the Cdc48p/Ufd1p/Npl4p ATPase complex and moved into the cytosol (Bays et al., 2001bBays N.W. Wilhovsky S.K. Goradia A. Hodgkiss-Harlow K. Hampton R.Y.

Finally, the substrate is delivered to the proteasome and degraded. The events of ERAD-L occurring inside the ER membrane are unknown, particularly the mechanism by which substrates are moved through the ER membrane. It has been proposed that a retrotranslocation channel is required, and several channel candidates have been considered (for review, see Hirsch et al., 2009Hirsch C. Gauss R. Horn S.C. Neuber O. Sommer T. The ubiquitylation machinery of the endoplasmic reticulum.Nature. 2009; 458: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Among the components of the Hrd1p complex, the most attractive candidates are Der1p and its mammalian homologs, the Derlins (Knop et al., 1996Knop M. Finger A. Braun T. Hellmuth K. Wolf D.H. Der1, a novel protein specifically required for endoplasmic reticulum degradation in yeast.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, Lilley and Ploegh, 2004Lilley B.N.

In addition, some studies suggest a role for the Sec61 channel, which is normally involved in the translocation of proteins from the cytosol into the ER (Pilon et al., 1997Pilon M. Schekman R. Römisch K. Sec61p mediates export of a misfolded secretory protein from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol for degradation.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, Schäfer and Wolf, 2009Schäfer A.

Cell. 1999; 4: 925-934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, there is no direct evidence in support of any of these candidates, and it is not even clear whether a channel exists. In fact, it has been suggested that translocation is instead linked to the formation of lipid droplets (Ploegh, 2007Ploegh H.L. A lipid-based model for the creation of an escape hatch from the endoplasmic reticulum.Nature. 2007; 448: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). How the driving force for retrotranslocation is provided is also unclear. Whereas it is conceivable that the Cdc48p ATPase pulls on a polyubiquitinated substrate once it appears on the cytosolic side of the membrane, it is mysterious how energy would be provided for moving the polypeptide through the membrane to make it accessible to the ubiquitination machinery. Finally, and more generally, the specific functions of the individual components of the Hrd1p-complex are unknown, and it is unclear whether they act in a temporal order during retrotranslocation of ERAD-L substrates. Here, we show that Hrd1p is the central membrane component in the ERAD-L process and propose a model for polypeptide movement through the ER membrane. In wild-type S. cerevisiae cells, all four components of the Hrd1p complex (Hrd1p, Hrd3p, Usa1p, and Der1p) are essential for the degradation of ERAD-L substrates (Knop et al., 1996Knop M. Finger A.

However, we reasoned that the overexpression of one component may make other components dispensable, a result that would indicate a functional hierarchy among these factors. These experiments were also motivated by the previous observation that overexpression of Hrd1p compensates for the absence of Hrd3p (Gardner et al., 2000Gardner R.G. Swarbrick G.M. Bays N.W. Cronin S.R. Wilhovsky S. Seelig L. Kim C. Hampton R.Y. Endoplasmic reticulum degradation requires lumen to cytosol signaling. Transmembrane control of Hrd1p by Hrd3p.J.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4123-4134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although this result was interpreted as simply restoring the levels of Hrd1p, which becomes unstable in a HRD3 deletion mutant. We tested the effect of overexpression of Hrd1p on the degradation of a well-characterized ERAD-L substrate, a misfolded version of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY∗) that is tagged with a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (Finger et al., 1993Finger A.

The unfolded protein response regulates multiple aspects of secretory and membrane protein biogenesis and endoplasmic reticulum quality control.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In wild-type cells, CPY∗-HA is degraded with a half-life of ∼30 min (Figure 1A , lanes 1–4 and graph). When the endogenous promoter for Hrd1p was replaced by the strong, galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter and the cells were grown in the presence of galactose, CPY∗-HA degradation was accelerated (Figure 1A, lanes 5–8). In the presence of glucose, when the Gal promoter was repressed, CPY∗-HA was stable, as expected from the depletion of Hrd1p (Figure S1A available online). Although overexpressed Hrd1p is unstable, the steady-state levels are increased by a factor of ∼10 (Figure S1B). CPY∗-HA degradation by overexpressed Hrd1p was much slower when the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc7p was absent (Figure 1A, lanes 9–12) and was completely abrogated when an essential cysteine in the RING finger domain of Hrd1p was mutated (Figure S1C). In addition, degradation was attenuated in a cdc48 mutant (Figure S1C). Thus, the requirements for ubiquitin-ligase activity by Hrd1p and for the function of the Cdc48 ATPase are maintained when Hrd1p is overexpressed.Figure S1Stability of CPY∗ and Hrd1p in Cells with the Indicated Genotype Expressing Different Levels of Hrd1p, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) The degradation of the misfolded luminal ER protein CPY∗-HA was followed after inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide in wild-type (wt) cells or in cells in which Hrd1p was placed under the control of the GAL promoter.

The bottom panel shows the levels of wild-type and mutant Hrd1p in the same experiment. Next, we tested CPY∗-HA degradation in cells that overexpressed Hrd1p but lacked other components of the Hrd1p complex. As reported (Plemper et al., 1999Plemper R.K. Bordallo J. Deak P.M. Taxis C. Hitt R. Wolf D.H. Genetic interactions of Hrd3p and Der3p/Hrd1p with Sec61p suggest a retro-translocation complex mediating protein transport for ER degradation.J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4123-4134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), degradation was not affected when Hrd3p was absent (Figure 1A, lanes 13–16). Of interest, the process was also not affected by the absence of Usa1p or Der1p (Figure 1A, lanes 17–20 and 21–24). Moreover, even in cells that simultaneously lacked Hrd3p, Usa1p, and Der1p, the degradation of CPY∗-HA was unimpeded (Figure 1A, lanes 25–28). Degradation in the triple-deletion mutant required Hrd1p expression (Figure S1A) and ubiquitin ligase activity (Figure S1D). These experiments indicate that Hrd1p overexpression bypasses the need for the other components of the Hrd1p complex. Similar results were obtained with KHN-HA (a soluble protein) and KWW-HA (a membrane-bound protein), both containing a misfolded luminal domain (Figure S2) (Vashist and Ng, 2004Vashist S. Ng D.T.W. Misfolded proteins are sorted by a sequential checkpoint mechanism of ER quality control.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The bypass effect observed with Hrd1p was not seen when the other components of the Hrd1p complex were overexpressed. Der1p under the Gal promoter did not accelerate CPY∗-HA degradation and did not alleviate the requirement for the other Hrd1p complex components (Figure 1B). Usa1p or Hrd3p overexpression blocked degradation of CPY∗-HA (Figures 1C and 1D), indicating that excess of these components interferes with the normal function of the Hrd1p complex. Taken together, our data suggest that Hrd1p is the key component of the Hrd1p complex and that the other subunits may have ancillary roles. We hypothesized that Hrd1p overexpression bypasses the need of the other Hrd1p complex components because Hrd1p must oligomerize to be active in ERAD-L; in wild-type cells, the oligomerization would be regulated by other components of the Hrd1p complex, whereas Hrd1p overexpression would force its spontaneous oligomerization. Both our own previous experiments and more recent results indicate that endogenous Hrd1p forms high-molecular weight complexes whose size depends on the presence of Usa1p, but not Hrd3p or Der1p (Carvalho et al., 2006Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A.

Cell. 2009; 36: 782-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To investigate directly the oligomerization of Hrd1p, we expressed Myc- and HA-tagged versions of Hrd1p in the same cell, both under the endogenous promoter. Detergent-solubilized membrane extracts were then treated with bifunctional crosslinking reagents and subjected to immunoprecipitation with HA antibodies. With extracts from wild-type cells that were not treated with crosslinker, HA antibodies precipitated Hrd1p-Myc (Figure 2A , top panel, lane 4), as previously described (Horn et al., 2009Horn S.C. Hanna J. Hirsch C. Volkwein C. Schütz A. Heinemann U. Sommer T. Jarosch E. Usa1 functions as a scaffold of the HRD-ubiquitin ligase.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 782-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Upon treatment with crosslinkers, several high-molecular weight bands were observed (Figure 2A, top panel, lanes 5 and 6). The highest molecular weight band appeared with multiple crosslinkers and contains not only Hrd1p, but also Usa1p (Figure 2A, bottom panel, lanes 5 and 6). With extracts lacking Usa1p, HA antibodies precipitated only negligible amounts of Hrd1p-Myc or the crosslinked bands (Figure 2A, bottom panel, lanes 1–3). Thus, Usa1p facilitates Hrd1p oligomerization. Next, we identified the regions in Usa1p that are responsible for Hrd1p interaction and oligomerization. Usa1p contains two transmembrane segments flanked by long cytoplasmic domains (Figure 2B). Preliminary experiments showed that the cytoplasmic region preceding the first transmembrane segment was required for both Hrd1p oligomerization and Usa1p interaction (data not shown). For a more precise analysis, we introduced deletions into Usa1p (Figure 2B). We found a segment (437–490), called segment H, whose deletion abolished both the binding of Usa1p to Hrd1p and the oligomerization of Hrd1p (Figure 2B, lane 12). Segment H likely interacts with the C-terminal 34 residues of Hrd1p (Horn et al., 2009Horn S.C. Hanna J. Hirsch C. Volkwein C. Schütz A. Heinemann U. Sommer T. Jarosch E. Usa1 functions as a scaffold of the HRD-ubiquitin ligase.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 782-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Another deletion (residues 319–418) left the interaction between Usa1p and Hrd1p intact but significantly reduced Hrd1p oligomerization (Figure 2B, lane 10). The region from 371 to 418, called segment U, appears to be important for Hrd1p oligomerization because a deletion mutant lacking residues 319–371 behaves like wild-type Usa1p (Figure 2B, lane 9). A recent report suggested that the segment from 259 to 312 encompassing the Ubl domain is responsible for inducing oligomers of Hrd1p (Horn et al., 2009Horn S.C. Hanna J. Hirsch C. Volkwein C. Schütz A. Heinemann U. Sommer T. Jarosch E. Usa1 functions as a scaffold of the HRD-ubiquitin ligase.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 782-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, we did not observe any defects of Hrd1p oligomerization upon complete deletion of the Ubl domain (259–318) (Figure S3A ). A simple model for Usa1p-dependent Hrd1p oligomerization is that Usa1p itself forms oligomers through segment U and binds Hrd1p through segment H (see scheme in Figure 7A). To test this idea, we expressed HA-tagged full-length Usa1p together with FLAG-tagged versions of Usa1p mutants, all under the endogenous promoter. HA antibodies precipitated all Usa1p-FLAG constructs, with the exception of the one lacking segment U (Figure 2C). Similar results were obtained with hrd1Δ cells (data not shown). These results support a model in which Usa1p oligomers facilitate Hrd1p oligomerization. Based on our overexpression experiments, it appears that Hrd1p has an intrinsic propensity to form oligomers, which are stabilized by Usa1p. Indeed, crosslinking experiments show that overexpressed Hrd1p can form high molecular weight species even in the absence of Usa1p (Figure S3B). This is further supported by experiments in which ERAD was inactivated by a mutation of an essential cysteine in the RING finger of Hrd1p (C399S). As expected (Horn et al., 2009Horn S.C. Hanna J. Hirsch C. Volkwein C. Schütz A. Heinemann U. Sommer T. Jarosch E. Usa1 functions as a scaffold of the HRD-ubiquitin ligase.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 782-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), in the presence of Usa1p, this mutant protein formed oligomers (Figure 2D, lane 11). Of interest, however, Hrd1p (C399S) oligomerized even in the absence of Usa1p (Figure 2D, lanes 15"

https://openalex.org/W1986221874,"Ribonuclease (RNase) P is the universal ribozyme responsible for 5′-end tRNA processing. We report the crystal structure of the Thermotoga maritima RNase P holoenzyme in complex with tRNAPhe. The 154 kDa complex consists of a large catalytic RNA (P RNA), a small protein cofactor and a mature tRNA. The structure shows that RNA–RNA recognition occurs through shape complementarity, specific intermolecular contacts and base-pairing interactions. Soaks with a pre-tRNA 5′ leader sequence with and without metal help to identify the 5′ substrate path and potential catalytic metal ions. The protein binds on top of a universally conserved structural module in P RNA and interacts with the leader, but not with the mature tRNA. The active site is composed of phosphate backbone moieties, a universally conserved uridine nucleobase, and at least two catalytically important metal ions. The active site structure and conserved RNase P–tRNA contacts suggest a universal mechanism of catalysis by RNase P. Transfer RNAs are synthesized as precursors that require trimming at the 5' and 3' ends, and some modification of specific nucleotides. The ribozyme RNase P is universally responsible for processing the 5' end of tRNAs. The crystal structure of RNase P (from Thermotoga maritima) bound to mature phenylalanine transfer RNA has now been solved. It reveals the interactions involved in pre-tRNA recognition, active site location and the role of metals in catalysis. The RNase P–tRNA ribonucleoprotein structure also offers clues as to how an ancient RNA-based world might evolve to become the protein-catalyst dominated world of today. tRNAs are synthesized in a premature form that requires trimming of the 5′ and 3′ ends and modification of specific nucleotides. RNase P, a complex containing a long catalytic RNA and a protein cofactor, catalyses the cleavage that generates the mature 5′ end. Here, the structure of RNase P bound to mature tRNAPhe is solved. Recognition of the leader sequence and its mechanism of cleavage is determined by soaking an oligonucleotide corresponding to the premature 5′ end into the crystal."
https://openalex.org/W2090184439,"Aberrant activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway can drive tumorigenesis. To investigate the mechanism by which glioma-associated oncogene family zinc finger-1 (GLI1), a crucial effector of Hh signaling, regulates Hh pathway activation, we searched for GLI1-interacting proteins. We report that the chromatin remodeling protein SNF5 (encoded by SMARCB1, hereafter called SNF5), which is inactivated in human malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs), interacts with GLI1. We show that Snf5 localizes to Gli1-regulated promoters and that loss of Snf5 leads to activation of the Hh-Gli pathway. Conversely, re-expression of SNF5 in MRT cells represses GLI1. Consistent with this, we show the presence of a Hh-Gli-activated gene expression profile in primary MRTs and show that GLI1 drives the growth of SNF5-deficient MRT cells in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, our studies reveal that SNF5 is a key mediator of Hh signaling and that aberrant activation of GLI1 is a previously undescribed targetable mechanism contributing to the growth of MRT cells."

It is unclear whether similarly general organizational principles also exist for inhibitory neocortical circuits. Here we delineate and compare local inhibitory-to-excitatory wiring patterns in all principal layers of primary motor (M1), somatosensory (S1) and visual (V1) cortex, using genetically targeted photostimulation in a mouse knock-in line that conditionally expresses channelrhodopsin-2 in GABAergic neurons. Inhibitory inputs to excitatory neurons derived largely from the same cortical layer within a three-column diameter. However, subsets of pyramidal cells in layers 2/3 and 5B received extensive translaminar inhibition. These neurons were prominent in V1, where they might correspond to complex cells, less numerous in barrel cortex and absent in M1. Although inhibitory connection patterns were stereotypical, the abundance of individual motifs varied between regions and cells, potentially reflecting functional specializations."

We have recently defined the tumorigenic potential and clinical significance of the YAP1 oncogene in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study aims to define the tumorigenic properties of YAP in HCC and elucidate the related downstream signaling mechanism. In a gain-of-function study, we demonstrated that ectopic increased expression of YAP in the immortalized non-tumorigenic hepatocyte cell line MIHA confers tumorigenic and metastatic potentials, as evidenced by (1) enhanced aptitudes in cell viability, anchorage-independent growth, migration and invasion; (2) tumor formation in a xenograft mouse model; and (3) induction of HCC biomarker α-fetoprotein and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. Furthermore, we have identified AXL, a receptor tyrosine kinase, as a key downstream target that drives YAP-dependent oncogenic functions. RNAi-mediated knockdown of AXL expression decreased the ability of YAP-expressing MIHA cells and of the primary HCC cell line to proliferate and invade. These results indicate that AXL is a mediator of YAP-dependent oncogenic activities and implicates it as a potential therapeutic target for HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2108812570,"PI3K and PTEN lipid phosphatase control the level of cellular phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate, an activator of AKT kinases that promotes cell growth and survival. Mutations activating AKT are commonly observed in human cancers. We report here that ENTPD5, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enzyme, is upregulated in cell lines and primary human tumor samples with active AKT. ENTPD5 hydrolyzes UDP to UMP to promote protein N-glycosylation and folding in ER. Knockdown of ENTPD5 in PTEN null cells causes ER stress and loss of growth factor receptors. ENTPD5, together with cytidine monophosphate kinase-1 and adenylate kinase-1, constitute an ATP hydrolysis cycle that converts ATP to AMP, resulting in a compensatory increase in aerobic glycolysis known as the Warburg effect. The growth of PTEN null cells is inhibited both in vitro and in mouse xenograft tumor models. ENTPD5 is therefore an integral part of the PI3K/PTEN regulatory loop and a potential target for anticancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2085309970,"Little is known about crosstalk between the eukaryotic transcription and translation machineries that operate in different cell compartments. The yeast proteins Rpb4p and Rpb7p represent one such link as they form a heterodimer that shuttles between the nucleus, where it functions in transcription, and the cytoplasm, where it functions in the major mRNA decay pathways. Here we show that the Rpb4/7 heterodimer interacts physically and functionally with components of the translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3), and is required for efficient translation initiation. Efficient translation in the cytoplasm depends on association of Rpb4/7 with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in the nucleus, leading to a model in which Pol II remotely controls translation. Hence, like in prokaryotes, the eukaryotic translation is coupled to transcription. We propose that Rpb4/7, through its interactions at each step in the mRNA lifecycle, represents a class of factors, ""mRNA coordinators,"" which integrate the various stages of gene expression into a system."
https://openalex.org/W2006763255,"During interphase, centrosomes are held together by a proteinaceous linker that connects the proximal ends of the mother and daughter centriole. This linker is disassembled at the onset of mitosis in a process known as centrosome disjunction, thereby facilitating centrosome separation and bipolar spindle formation. The NIMA (never in mitosis A)-related kinase Nek2A is implicated in disconnecting the centrosomes through disjoining the linker proteins C-Nap1 and rootletin. However, the mechanisms controlling centrosome disjunction remain poorly understood. Here, we report that two Hippo pathway components, the mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 2 (Mst2) and the scaffold protein Salvador (hSav1), directly interact with Nek2A and regulate its ability to localize to centrosomes, and phosphorylate C-Nap1 and rootletin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the hSav1-Mst2-Nek2A centrosome disjunction pathway becomes essential for bipolar spindle formation on partial inhibition of the kinesin-5 Eg5. We propose that hSav1-Mst2-Nek2A and Eg5 have distinct, but complementary functions, in centrosome disjunction."
https://openalex.org/W2071088375,"Using a rat model of PD, the authors find a progressive decline in autonomous globus pallidus pacemaking. This loss was reversed by viral expression of the HCN channel. However, the motor disability induced by DA depletion was not reversed, suggesting that the loss of pacemaking was a consequence, not a cause, of key network pathophysiology. Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a profound motor disability that is traceable to the emergence of synchronous, rhythmic spiking in neurons of the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe). The origins of this pathophysiology are poorly defined for the generation of pacemaking. After the induction of a parkinsonian state in mice, there was a progressive decline in autonomous GPe pacemaking, which normally serves to desynchronize activity. The loss was attributable to the downregulation of an ion channel that is essential in pacemaking, the hyperpolarization and cyclic nucleotide–gated (HCN) channel. Viral delivery of HCN2 subunits restored pacemaking and reduced burst spiking in GPe neurons. However, the motor disability induced by dopamine (DA) depletion was not reversed, suggesting that the loss of pacemaking was a consequence, rather than a cause, of key network pathophysiology, a conclusion that is consistent with the ability of L-type channel antagonists to attenuate silencing after DA depletion."
https://openalex.org/W2024238110,"Two pathways in ubiquitylation are linked, as the RING domain E3 ligase Ubr1, from the N-end rule pathway, is found to bind and cooperate with the HECT domain E3 Ufd4 from the ubiquitin-fusion degradation pathway. Substrates of the N-end rule pathway are recognized by the Ubr1 E3 ubiquitin ligase through their destabilizing amino-terminal residues. Our previous work showed that the Ubr1 E3 and the Ufd4 E3 together target an internal degradation signal (degron) of the Mgt1 DNA repair protein. Ufd4 is an E3 enzyme of the ubiquitin-fusion degradation (UFD) pathway that recognizes an N-terminal ubiquitin moiety. Here we show that the RING-type Ubr1 E3 and the HECT-type Ufd4 E3 interact, both physically and functionally. Although Ubr1 can recognize and polyubiquitylate an N-end rule substrate in the absence of Ufd4, the Ubr1–Ufd4 complex is more processive in that it produces a longer substrate-linked polyubiquitin chain. Conversely, Ubr1 can function as a polyubiquitylation-enhancing component of the Ubr1–Ufd4 complex in its targeting of UFD substrates. We also found that Ubr1 can recognize the N-terminal ubiquitin moiety. These and related advances unify two proteolytic systems that have been studied separately for two decades."
https://openalex.org/W2068452253,"Approximately 20% of tumors contain activating mutations in the RAS family of oncogenes. As tumors progress to higher grades of malignancy, the expression of oncogenic RAS has been reported to increase, leading to an oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) response. Evasion of this senescence barrier is a hallmark of advanced tumors indicating that OIS serves a critical tumor-suppressive function. Induction of OIS has been attributed to either RAS-mediated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or to induction of a DNA damage response (DDR). However, functional links between these two processes in triggering the senescent phenotype have not been explicitly described. Our previous work has shown that, in cultured untransformed cells, preventing elimination of oxidized guanine deoxyribonucleotides, which was achieved by suppressing expression of the cellular 8-oxo-dGTPase, human MutT homolog 1 (MTH1), sufficed to induce a DDR as well as premature senescence. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of MTH1 can prevent the oncogenic H-RAS-induced DDR and attendant premature senescence, although it does not affect the observed elevation in ROS levels produced by RAS oncoprotein expression. Conversely, we find that loss of MTH1 preferentially induces an in vitro proliferation defect in tumorigenic cells overexpressing oncogenic RAS. These results indicate that the guanine nucleotide pool is a critical target for intracellular ROS produced by oncogenic RAS and that RAS-transformed cells require robust MTH1 expression to proliferate."
https://openalex.org/W2058537378,"Successful haematopoiesis requires long-term retention of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in a quiescent state. The transcriptional regulation of stem cell quiescence, especially by factors with specific functions in HSCs, is only beginning to be understood. Here, we demonstrate that Nurr1, a nuclear receptor transcription factor, has such a regulatory role. Overexpression of Nurr1 drives early haematopoietic progenitors into quiescence. When stem cells overexpressing Nurr1 are transplanted into lethally irradiated mice, they localize to the bone marrow, but do not contribute to regeneration of the blood system. Furthermore, the loss of only one allele of Nurr1 is sufficient to induce HSCs to enter the cell cycle and proliferate. Molecular analysis revealed an association between Nurr1 overexpression and upregulation of the cell-cycle inhibitor p18 (also known as INK4C), suggesting a mechanism by which Nurr1 could regulate HSC quiescence. Our findings provide critical insight into the transcriptional control mechanisms that determine whether HSCs remain dormant or enter the cell cycle and begin to proliferate."
https://openalex.org/W2093153811,"Alpha actinins (ACTNs) are known for their ability to modulate cytoskeletal organization and cell motility by cross-linking actin filaments. We show here that ACTN4 harbors a functional LXXLL receptor interaction motif, interacts with nuclear receptors in vitro and in mammalian cells, and potently activates transcription mediated by nuclear receptors. Whereas overexpression of ACTN4 potentiates estrogen receptor α (ERα)-mediated transcription in transient transfection reporter assays, knockdown of ACTN4 decreases it. In contrast, histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) inhibits estrogen receptor α (ERα)-mediated transcription. Moreover, the ACTN4 mutant lacking the CaM (calmodulin)-like domain that is required for its interaction with HDAC7 fails to activate transcription by ERα. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrate that maximal associations of ACTN4 and HDAC7 with the pS2 promoter are mutually exclusive. Knockdown of ACTN4 significantly decreases the expression of ERα target genes including pS2 and PR and also affects cell proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with or without hormone, whereas knockdown of HDAC7 exhibits opposite effects. Interestingly, overexpression of wild-type ACTN4, but not the mutants defective in interacting with ERα or HDAC7, results in an increase in pS2 and PR mRNA accumulation in a hormone-dependent manner. In summary, we have identified ACTN4 as a novel, atypical coactivator that regulates transcription networks to control cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2058061005,"The transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is activated in human breast cancer tissues and cell lines. However, it is unclear whether NF-κB activation is a consequence of tumor formation or a contributor to tumor development. We developed a doxycycline (dox)-inducible mouse model, termed DNMP, to inhibit NF-κB activity specifically within the mammary epithelium during tumor development in the polyoma middle T oncogene (PyVT) mouse mammary tumor model. DNMP females and PyVT littermate controls were treated with dox from 4 to 12 weeks of age. We observed an increase in tumor latency and a decrease in final tumor burden in DNMP mice compared with PyVT controls. A similar effect with treatment from 8 to 12 weeks indicates that outcome is independent of effects on postnatal virgin ductal development. In both cases, DNMP mice were less likely to develop lung metastases than controls. Treatment from 8 to 9 weeks was sufficient to impact primary tumor formation. Inhibition of NF-κB increases apoptosis in hyperplastic stages of tumor development and decreases proliferation at least in part by reducing Cyclin D1 expression. To test the therapeutic potential of NF-κB inhibition, we generated palpable tumors by orthotopic injection of PyVT cells and then treated systemically with the NF-κB inhibitor thymoquinone (TQ). TQ treatment resulted in a reduction in tumor volume and weight as compared with vehicle-treated control. These data indicate that epithelial NF-κB is an active contributor to tumor progression and demonstrate that inhibition of NF-κB could have a significant therapeutic impact even at later stages of mammary tumor progression."

In the eye, fluorescent retinyl esters in subcellular structures called retinosomes mediate regeneration of the visual chromophore, 11-cis-retinal, by the visual cycle. But harmful fluorescent condensation products of retinoids also occur in the retina. We report that in wild-type mice, excitation with a wavelength of ∼730 nm identified retinosomes in the retinal pigment epithelium, and excitation with a wavelength of ∼910 nm revealed at least one additional retinal fluorophore. The latter fluorescence was absent in eyes of genetically modified mice lacking a functional visual cycle, but accentuated in eyes of older wild-type mice and mice with defective clearance of all-trans-retinal, an intermediate in the visual cycle. MPM, a noninvasive imaging modality that facilitates concurrent monitoring of retinosomes along with potentially harmful products in aging eyes, has the potential to detect early molecular changes due to age-related macular degeneration and other defects in retinoid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2062244250,"A major immunological response during neuroinflammation is the activation of microglia, which subsequently release proinflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)). Besides its proinflammatory properties, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-derived PGE(2) has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects on innate immune responses. Here, we investigated the role of microsomal PGE(2) synthase-1 (mPGES-1), which is functionally coupled to COX-2, in immune responses using a model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced spinal neuroinflammation. Interestingly, we found that activation of E-prostanoid (EP)2 and EP4 receptors, but not EP1, EP3, PGI(2) receptor (IP), thromboxane A(2) receptor (TP), PGD(2) receptor (DP), and PGF(2) receptor (FP), efficiently blocked LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) synthesis and COX-2 and mPGES-1 induction as well as prostaglandin synthesis in spinal cultures. In vivo, spinal EP2 receptors were up-regulated in microglia in response to intrathecally injected LPS. Accordingly, LPS priming reduced spinal synthesis of TNFα, interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and prostaglandins in response to a second intrathecal LPS injection. Importantly, this reduction was only seen in wild-type but not in mPGES-1-deficient mice. Furthermore, intrathecal application of EP2 and EP4 agonists as well as genetic deletion of EP2 significantly reduced spinal TNFα and IL-1β synthesis in mPGES-1 knock-out mice after LPS priming. These data suggest that initial inflammation prepares the spinal cord for a negative feedback regulation by mPGES-1-derived PGE(2) followed by EP2 activation, which limits the synthesis of inflammatory mediators during chronic inflammation. Thus, our data suggest a role of mPGES-1-derived PGE(2) in resolution of neuroinflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2046373706,"The chemotaxis signalling network in Escherichia coli that controls the locomotion of bacteria is a classic model system for signal transduction. This pathway modulates the behaviour of flagellar motors to propel bacteria towards sources of chemical attractants. Although this system relaxes to a steady state in response to environmental changes, the signalling events within the chemotaxis network are noisy and cause large temporal variations of the motor behaviour even in the absence of stimulus. That the same signalling network governs both behavioural variability and cellular response raises the question of whether these two traits are independent. Here, we experimentally establish a fluctuation-response relationship in the chemotaxis system of living bacteria. Using this relationship, we demonstrate the possibility of inferring the cellular response from the behavioural variability measured before stimulus. In monitoring the pre- and post-stimulus switching behaviour of individual bacterial motors, we found that variability scales linearly with the response time for different functioning states of the cell. This study highlights that the fundamental relationship between fluctuation and response is not constrained to physical systems at thermodynamic equilibrium but is extensible to living cells. Such a relationship not only implies that behavioural variability and cellular response can be coupled traits, but it also provides a general framework within which we can examine how the selection of a network design shapes this interdependence."
https://openalex.org/W1973568027,"EFA-6, originally identified as a suppressor of defects associated with dynein muations in early Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, regulates microtubule growth at the embryo cortex through a conserved amino-terminal motif but independently of its ARF6 GTP exchange factor activity. Microtubules are polymers of tubulin heterodimers that exhibit dynamic instability: periods of growth followed by periods of shrinkage1. However, the molecular regulation of dynamic instability remains elusive. Here, we show that EFA-6, a cortically-localized protein2, limits the growth of microtubules near the cell cortex of early embryonic cells from Caenorhabidits elegans, possibly by inducing microtubule catastrophes. Compared with wild type, embryos lacking EFA-6 had abnormally long and dense microtubules at the cell cortex, and growing microtubule plus ends resided at the cortex for up to five-fold longer. Loss of EFA-6 also caused excess centrosome separation and displacement towards the cell cortex early in mitosis, and subsequently a loss of anaphase spindle-pole oscillations and increased rates of spindle elongation. The centrosome separation phenotype was dependent on the motor protein dynein, suggesting a possible link between the modulation of microtubule dynamics at the cortex and dynein-dependent force production. EFA-6 orthologues activate ARF6-type GTPases to regulate vesicle trafficking3. However, we show that only the C. elegans EFA-6 amino-terminus is both necessary and sufficient to limit microtubule growth along the cortex, and that this function is independent of ARF-6."

Accumulation of lipofuscin (granular deposits) in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a hallmark of major degenerative eye diseases such as Stargardt disease, Best disease, and age-related macular degeneration. The intrinsic reactivity of vitamin A leads to its dimerization and to the formation of pigments such as A2E, and is believed to play a key role in the formation of ocular lipofuscin. We sought a clinically pragmatic method to slow vitamin A dimerization as a means to elucidate the pathogenesis of macular degenerations and to develop a therapeutic intervention. We prepared vitamin A enriched with the stable isotope deuterium at carbon twenty (C20-D3-vitamin A). Results showed that dimerization of deuterium-enriched vitamin A was considerably slower than that of vitamin A at natural abundance as measured in vitro. Administration of C20-D3-vitamin A to wild-type rodents with no obvious genetic defects in vitamin A processing, slowed A2E biosynthesis. This study elucidates the mechanism of A2E biosynthesis and suggests that administration of C20-D3-vitamin A may be a viable, long-term approach to retard vitamin A dimerization and by extension, may slow lipofuscin deposition and the progression of common degenerative eye diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2046617409,"Proteoglycan (PG) expression was studied in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). RT-PCR analyses showed that the expression of the PG serglycin core protein was much higher than that of the extracellular matrix PG decorin and the cell surface PG syndecan-1. PG biosynthesis was further studied by biosynthetic [(35)S]sulfate labeling of polarized HUVEC. Interestingly, a major part of (35)S-PGs was secreted to the apical medium. A large portion of these PGs was trypsin-resistant, a typical feature of serglycin. The trypsin-resistant PGs were mainly of the chondroitin/dermatan sulfate type but also contained a minor heparan sulfate component. Secreted serglycin was identified by immunoprecipitation as a PG with a core protein of ∼30 kDa. Serglycin was furthermore shown to be present in perinuclear regions and in two distinct types of vesicles throughout the cytoplasm using immunocytochemistry. To search for possible serglycin partner molecules, HUVEC were stained for the chemokine growth-related oncogene α (GROα/CXCL1). Co-localization with serglycin could be demonstrated, although not in all vesicles. Serglycin did not show overt co-localization with tissue-type plasminogen activator-positive vesicles. When PG biosynthesis was abrogated using benzyl-β-D-xyloside, serglycin secretion was decreased, and the number of vesicles with co-localized serglycin and GROα was reduced. The level of GROα in the apical medium was also reduced after xyloside treatment. Together, these findings indicate that serglycin is a major PG in human endothelial cells, mainly secreted to the apical medium and implicated in chemokine secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2034060255,"The zymogen activation mechanism and physiological functions of the most ancient and highly conserved basic amino acid-specific proprotein convertase 7 (PC7) are not known. Herein, we characterized the biosynthesis, subcellular localization, and trafficking of the membrane-bound full-length rat and human PC7. The prosegment of PC7 is primarily secreted alone as a non-inhibitory protein via the conventional, Golgi-dependent, secretory pathway. Mature PC7 is partially sulfated and thus reaches the cell surface via the conventional route. However, a fraction of PC7 reaches the cell surface through a brefeldin A- and COPII-independent unconventional secretory pathway. The latter trafficking may explain the rapid (<10 min) transit of a fraction of PC7 from the ER to the cell surface. Electron microscopy further confirmed the localization of PC7 to the cell surface of HEK293 cells. Within the cytosolic tail, only two cysteines (Cys699 and Cys704) are palmitoylated, but this modification does not affect the choice of trafficking pathway. Swapping the transmembrane-cytosolic tail (TMCT) sequences of the convertases Furin and PC7 revealed that PC7TMCT-Furin is much more sulfated and hence traffics more efficiently through the conventional secretory pathway. In contrast, the FurinTMCT-PC7 is no longer sulfated and thus reaches the cell surface by the unconventional pathway. Because trafficking of PC7CT-Furin and FurinCT-PC7 resemble their wild type counterparts, we deduce that the transmembrane domain of PC7 regulates the sorting of PC7 toward the unconventional secretory pathway. In conclusion, PC7 is distinct from other proprotein convertases in its zymogen activation, subcellular localization, and trafficking.

https://openalex.org/W1981559825,"The evidence that nuclear proteins can be degraded by cytosolic proteasomes has received considerable experimental support. However, the presence of proteasome subunits in the nucleus also suggests that protein degradation could occur within this organelle. We determined that Sts1 can target proteasomes to the nucleus and facilitate the degradation of a nuclear protein. Specific sts1 mutants showed reduced nuclear proteasomes at the nonpermissive temperature. In contrast, high expression of Sts1 increased the levels of nuclear proteasomes. Sts1 targets proteasomes to the nucleus by interacting with Srp1, a nuclear import factor that binds nuclear localization signals. Deletion of the NLS in Sts1 prevented its interaction with Srp1 and caused proteasome mislocalization. In agreement with this observation, a mutation in Srp1 that weakened its interaction with Sts1 also reduced nuclear targeting of proteasomes. We reported that Sts1 could suppress growth and proteolytic defects of rad23Δ rpn10Δ. We show here that Sts1 suppresses a previously undetected proteasome localization defect in this mutant. Taken together, these findings explain the suppression of rad23Δ rpn10Δ by Sts1 and suggest that the degradation of nuclear substrates requires efficient proteasome localization."
https://openalex.org/W2014079410,"In eukaryotes, ribosome assembly requires hundreds of conserved essential proteins not present in the mature particle. Despite their importance, the function of most factors remains unknown. This is because protein deletion often affects the composition of the entire particle. Additionally, many proteins are present in assembling ribosomes for extended times, which makes it difficult to pinpoint their role to a particular step. Here we have combined classical yeast biochemistry with experiments using recombinant proteins and RNA to study the role of Dim2 and its interaction with Nob1, the nuclease that generates the 3'-end of 18 S rRNA. Analysis of Dim2 mutants in which the interaction with Nob1 is disrupted demonstrates that this interaction between Dim2 and Nob1 is essential for optimal growth, and RNA binding experiments show that Dim2 increases Nob1 RNA affinity. Furthermore, our data indicate that Dim2 helps regulate Nob1 cleavage activity at the 3'-end of 18 S rRNA, as point mutants where this interaction is abolished in vitro accumulate pre-ribosomes containing Nob1 and 20 S rRNA in vivo. Interestingly, the site of interaction with Nob1 is mapped to the canonical RNA binding surface of a KH-like domain in Dim2, providing another example where an RNA-binding domain can be repurposed for protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2032794629,"G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium channel (GIRK) plays crucial roles in regulating heart rate and neuronal excitability in eukaryotic cells. GIRK is activated by the direct binding of heterotrimeric G protein βγ subunits (Gβγ) upon stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors, such as M2 acetylcholine receptor. The binding of Gβγ to the cytoplasmic pore (CP) region of GIRK causes structural rearrangements, which are assumed to open the transmembrane ion gate. However, the crucial residues involved in the Gβγ binding and the structural mechanism of GIRK gating have not been fully elucidated. Here, we have characterized the interaction between the CP region of GIRK and Gβγ, by ITC and NMR. The ITC analyses indicated that four Gβγ molecules bind to a tetramer of the CP region of GIRK with a dissociation constant of 250 μM. The NMR analyses revealed that the Gβγ binding site spans two neighboring subunits of the GIRK tetramer, which causes conformational rearrangements between subunits. A possible binding mode and mechanism of GIRK gating are proposed."
https://openalex.org/W4239875975,"Here we report that bufalin and other cardiac glycoside inhibitors of the sodium-potassium ATPase (sodium pump) potently inhibit the induction of the interferon-β (IFNβ) gene by virus, double-stranded RNA or double-stranded DNA. Cardiac glycosides increase the intracellular sodium concentration, which appears to inhibit the ATPase activity of the RNA sensor RIG-I, an essential and early component in the IFNβ activation pathway. This, in turn, prevents the activation of the critical transcription factors IRF3 and NFκB. Bufalin inhibition can be overcome by expressing a drug-resistant variant of the sodium pump and knocking down the pump by short hairpin RNA inhibits IFNβ expression. Thus, bufalin acts exclusively through the sodium pump. We also show that bufalin inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling, at least in part by interfering with the nuclear translocation of NFκB. These findings suggest that bufalin could be used to treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases in which IFN or TNF are hyperactivated."
https://openalex.org/W2054214630,"We define two classes of calreticulin mutants that retain glycan binding activity; those that display enhanced or reduced polypeptide-specific chaperone activity, due to conformational effects. Under normal conditions, neither set of mutants significantly impacts the ability of calreticulin to mediate assembly and trafficking of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, which are calreticulin substrates. However, in cells treated with thapsigargin, which depletes endoplasmic reticulum calcium, major histocompatibility complex class I trafficking rates are accelerated coincident with calreticulin secretion, and detection of cell-surface calreticulin is dependent on its polypeptide binding conformations. Together, these findings identify a site on calreticulin that is an important determinant of the induction of its polypeptide binding conformation and demonstrate the relevance of the polypeptide binding conformations of calreticulin to endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1991275339,"Disturbed endochondral ossification in X-linked hypophosphatemia indicates an involvement of P(i) in chondrogenesis. We studied the role of the sodium-dependent P(i) cotransporters (NPT), which are a widely recognized regulator of cellular P(i) homeostasis, and the downstream events in chondrogenesis using Hyp mice, the murine homolog of human X-linked hypophosphatemia. Hyp mice showed reduced apoptosis and mineralization in hypertrophic cartilage. Hyp chondrocytes in culture displayed decreased apoptosis and mineralization compared with WT chondrocytes, whereas glycosaminoglycan synthesis, an early event in chondrogenesis, was not altered. Expression of the type III NPT Pit-1 and P(i) uptake were diminished, and intracellular ATP levels were also reduced in parallel with decreased caspase-9 and caspase-3 activity in Hyp chondrocytes. The competitive NPT inhibitor phosphonoformic acid and ATP synthesis inhibitor 3-bromopyruvate disturbed endochondral ossification with reduced apoptosis in vivo and suppressed apoptosis and mineralization in conjunction with reduced P(i) uptake and ATP synthesis in WT chondrocytes. Overexpression of Pit-1 in Hyp chondrocytes reversed P(i) uptake and ATP synthesis and restored apoptosis and mineralization. Our results suggest that cellular ATP synthesis consequent to P(i) uptake via Pit-1 plays an important role in chondrocyte apoptosis and mineralization, and that chondrogenesis is ATP-dependent."

In addition, we define the consequences of disrupting ATP regulation of ENaC in Cx30−/− mice. Urinary ATP levels in wild-type mice increase with sodium intake, being lower and less dependent on sodium intake in Cx30−/− mice. Loss of inhibitory ATP regulation causes ENaC activity to be greater in Cx30−/− versus wild-type mice, particularly with high sodium intake. This results from compromised ATP release rather than end-organ resistance: ENaC in Cx30−/− mice responds to exogenous ATP. Thus, loss of paracrine ATP feedback regulation of ENaC in Cx30−/− mice disrupts normal responses to changes in sodium intake. Consequently, ENaC is hyperactive in Cx30−/− mice lowering sodium excretion particularly during increases in sodium intake. Clamping mineralocorticoids high in Cx30−/− mice fed a high sodium diet causes a marked decline in renal sodium excretion. This is not the case in wild-type mice, which are capable of undergoing aldosterone-escape.

https://openalex.org/W2063184008,"Mineralization, a characteristic phenotypic property of osteoblastic lineage cells, was blocked by 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF) and decanoyl-Arg-Arg-Leu-Leu-chloromethyl ketone (dec-RRLL-cmk), inhibitors of SKI-1 (site 1; subtilisin kexin like-1) protease. Because SKI-1 is required for activation of SREBP and CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein)/ATF family transcription factors, we tested the effect of these inhibitors on gene expression. AEBSF decreased expression of 140 genes by 1.5-3.0-fold including Phex, Dmp1, COL1A1, COL11A1, and fibronectin. Direct comparison of AEBSF and dec-RRLL-cmk, a more specific SKI-1 inhibitor, demonstrated that expression of Phex, Dmp1, COL11A1, and fibronectin was reduced by both, whereas COL1A2 and HMGCS1 were reduced only by AEBSF. AEBSF and dec-RRLL-cmk decreased the nuclear content of SKI-1-activated forms of transcription factors SREBP-1, SREBP-2, and OASIS. In contrast to AEBSF, the actions of dec-RRLL-cmk represent the sum of its direct actions on SKI-1 and indirect actions on caspase-3. Specifically, dec-RRLL-cmk reduced intracellular caspase-3 activity by blocking the formation of activated 19-kDa caspase-3. Conversely, overexpression of SKI-1-activated SREBP-1a and CREB-H in UMR106-01 osteoblastic cells increased the number of mineralized foci and altered their morphology to yield mineralization nodules, respectively. In summary, SKI-1 regulates the activation of transmembrane transcription factor precursors required for expression of key genes required for mineralization of osteoblastic cultures in vitro and bone formation in vivo. Our results indicate that the differentiated phenotype of osteoblastic cells and possibly osteocytes depends upon the non-apoptotic actions of SKI-1."

However, how p53 is activated by defects of ribosome biogenesis remains to be determined. Here, we identified human UTP14a as an SSU processome component by showing that hUTP14a is nucleolar, associated with U3 snoRNA and involved in 18 S rRNA processing. Interestingly, ectopic expression of hUTP14a resulted in a decrease and knockdown of hUTP14a led to an increase of p53 protein levels. We showed that hUTP14a physically interacts with p53 and functionally promotes p53 turn-over, and that hUTP14a promotion of p53 destabilization is sensitive to a proteasome inhibitor but independent of ubiquitination. Significantly, knockdown of hUTP14a led to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Our data identified a novel pathway for p53 activation through a defect in rRNA processing and suggest that a ribosome biogenesis factor itself could act as a sensor for nucleolar stress to regulate p53."

Many of these transcription factors (e.g. Ets-1, c-Myc, and IRF-1) are ubiquitously expressed and therefore are not likely to influence A3G expression across the developmental and differentiation transitions. Accordingly, the transcription factors governing promoter selectivity and cell type specificity have yet to be established.Here, we performed a detailed analysis to define a minimal cell type-specific promoter element that contains neither a TATA nor CAAT box in their usual upstream location but contains a critical composite binding site for the NFAT and IRF families of transcription factors. When NFATc1 (also known as NFAT2) or NFATc2 (also known as NFAT1) and IRF-4 were expressed in tandem, A3G expression was strongly induced in nonimmune cells and T cell lines that do not usually express A3G. This manipulated expression correlated with the ability of these cells to potently resist an HIV-1Δvif challenge. Identifying the transcription factor families and member proteins that control cell type-specific A3G expression is thus important for understanding how the virus and antiviral innate immune responses intersect.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we identified the minimal core promoter fragment and critical transcription factors responsible for functional A3G gene expression. Using this data, we then successfully induced the expression of the A3G gene in two different cell lines, which do not normally express endogenous A3G. Examination of primary T cells for transcriptional start sites revealed that transcription initiates from two distinct regions, a common feature of TATA-less promoters. The region encompassing TSS1 confers the striking cell type specificity. A DNA fragment containing this sequence acts as a promoter in a T cell line but lacks detectable function in either the 293T or HeLa cell line. Although the defined Sp1 site in this sequence is likely to be important for in vivo A3G promoter activity and has been shown to function in reporter assays (29Muckenfuss H. Kaiser J.K. Krebil E. Battenberg M. Schwer C. Cichutek K. Münk C. Flory E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 3784-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and there are certainly other key DNA motifs within this core promoter, it is the overlapping NFAT and IRF binding sequence that is essential for the observed cell type specificity. This suggests a regulated model whereby basal transcription machinery and the composite NFAT/IRF site coordinately regulate the critical cell type-specific activation of the promoter.NFATc1 and NFATc2 are expressed in T cells at various stages of development and states of activation and have been implicated in several essential regulatory mechanisms that exhibit a cell type specificity (41Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). However, both are also expressed in a variety of cell types, suggesting that additional transcription factors participate in establishing the cell type-specific regulation seen with the A3G promoter. The IRF family of DNA-binding factors regulates interferon-inducible genes. Within this family, the proteins IRF-4 and IRF-8 exhibit a strict restriction of expression in cells of the lymphoid and myeloid lineages. IRF-4 is the predominant form expressed in T cells and the IFN-inducible IRF-8 is found in macrophages and dendritic cells (42Ozato K. Tailor P. Kubota T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20065-20069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Both cooperate with other transcription factors to exert a cell type-specific regulation (39Zhu C.

Regarding, the NFAT/IRF partnering specifically, IRF-4 and IRF-8 have been shown to individually cooperate with NFAT proteins to regulate cytokine production in cells of the immune system, in response to a variety of stimuli (36Hu C.M.

IRF-4 expression is induced upon T cell activation and, along with NFATc1/c2, is critically involved in the genetic regulation of interleukin-2 and -4. In contrast, interferon-γ treatment of monocytes stimulates IRF-8, which regulates the transcription of interleukin-12 (46Mamane Y. Heylbroeck C. Génin P. Algarté M. Servant M.J. LePage C. DeLuca C. Kwon H. Lin R. Hiscott J. Gene. 1999; 237: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). This differential responsiveness of IRF-4 and IRF-8, accounts for the finer points of cell type-specific regulation within different cell types of the immune compartment. In accordance with these findings, we consider it likely that IRF-4 critically participates in the regulation of A3G promoter activity in T cells, whereas IRF-8 likely adopts that role in macrophages; A3G expression is detected in both cell types, whereas IRF-4 expression is restricted to lymphocytes, and IRF-8 is primarily detected in cells of myeloid lineage (42Ozato K. Tailor P. Kubota T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20065-20069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we propose an association between the pattern of NFATc1/NFATc2 and IRF-4/IRF-8 expression and induction and the regulation of the innate immune response (24Stopak K.S. Chiu Y.L. Kropp J. Grant R.M. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3539-3546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Understanding the regulation of the innate immune response, which must also include consideration of cellular restriction factors such as A3G upon exposure to HIV-1 is essential.We verified that NFATc1/NFATc2 and IRF-4 binding to the A3G promoter was correlative as measured by ChIP experiments. Neither NFATc1/c2 nor IRF-4 binding was individually detected. In either case, when examining CEM versus CEMss cells, or stimulated versus unstimulated CEMss cells, the increased nuclear localization of the NFAT family member was associated with increased IRF-4 binding. The ionomycin stimulation of CEMss cells led to significant NFAT relocalization to the nucleus resulting in the detection of A3G promoter occupancy at a higher level than even in CEM cells, which endogenously express A3G. Although this is intriguing, it cannot unequivocally be stated whether this increased occupancy is solely at the A3G promoter. It must be noted that, by alignment, the promoter region of APOBEC3F (A3F) is virtually identical to A3G. The distinguishing of A3G versus A3F expression is certainly interesting, but it does not affect the interpretation of these results as both A3G and A3F are potent HIV-1 restriction factors. The primary focus of this work was the induction of A3G, but the parallel induction of other APOBEC3 family members is likely. The A3 genes are the result of segmental duplication and homologous sets of conserved TFBS are expected among the related family members. Alignment of upstream regions of the A3 family members reveals that APOBEC3D/E, A3F, and A3G are virtually identical in putative promoter regions. Each of these proteins exhibits potent anti-HIV-1 activity, and a simultaneous elevation of all three proteins may prove highly beneficial in a therapeutic setting.NFAT activity can be modulated via a “threshold phenomenon” whereby NFAT-controlled expression is mediated by regulating the amount of nuclear-localized protein. In neither 293T nor CEMss cells, were the nuclear levels of NFAT sufficient to potentiate A3G promoter activation. However, by manipulating each cell type using different methods, we affected A3G expression in a similar fashion, confirming the importance of the identified transcription factors. In 293T cells, robust A3G gene expression was seen when NFAT and IRF-4 were co-transfected. This data suggest that co-expression of IRF-4 and NFAT was both necessary and sufficient to induce A3G expression. In CEMss cells, which express IRF-4, nuclear mobilization of NFAT was accomplished via ionomycin. This translocation then resulted in binding of NFAT and IRF-4 to the A3G promoter, followed by the appearance of A3G protein. Finally, in CEM-A cells cyclosporin A treatment inhibited NFAT nuclear translocation, resulting in a detectable decrease of A3G expression. These observations indicate that the level of nuclear NFAT regulates the expression of A3G. Additional experiments in CEMss confirmed that the ionomycin-induced A3G allowed the cells to restrict an HIV-1Δvif challenge. This conferment of viral restriction was identical to that observed when the A3G was overexpressed via the stable transduction of the cDNA in the CEMss cell line (1Sheehy A.M. Gaddis N.C. Choi J.D. Malim M.H. Nature. 2002; 418: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar). This reporting of the ability to suppress HIV-1 infection via transcriptional control of a restriction factor is novel and opens an exciting line of investigation examining the potential of this type of approach.Although the stimulated A3G expression in CEMss cells did not dramatically alter the replication kinetics of wild-type HIV-1, it is intriguing and significant that partial protection was observed as indicated by the altered kinetics of wild-type HIV-1 growth in these cells. The delay itself is relatively moderate (∼4 days), but it is consistently observed and may suggest an important in vivo relevance when considering events of acute infection, such as the critical establishment of viral set point. A shift in the balance between viral replication and innate defense exerted during the period of acute infection may have long lasting and important consequences for disease outcome.Ultimately, the importance of understanding the cellular regulation of A3G gene expression is underscored by clinical observations that correlate elevated A3G expression with either the ability to resist HIV-1 exposure or successfully control infection (18Jin X.

These novel insights into regulation of A3G expression may lay the molecular foundation for development of therapeutics aimed at exploiting and manipulating the A3G regulatory circuit allowing for modulation of A3G to protective levels in vivo. IntroductionHuman A3G is an innate immune resistance factor for a broad range of retroviruses. The gene is expressed in hematopoietic cell populations, lymphoid tissues, and selected established T cell lines (1Sheehy A.M. Gaddis N.C. Choi J.D. Malim M.H. Nature. 2002; 418: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar).

HIV-1 Vif potently counteracts this restriction in the producer cell by targeting A3G to the proteasome, thereby preventing incorporation of A3G into the virus particle (8Marin M. Rose K.M.

The mechanism for producer cell mediated A3G restriction and HIV-1 Vif counteraction have been extensively studied and characterized (12Farrow M.A. Sheehy A.M. Future Microbiol. 2008; 3: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and the Vif:A3G regulatory circuit is one of the most interesting examples of how cellular restriction factors participate in the exertion of a powerful intracellular defense mechanism.A3G mRNA and protein levels vary across both developmental and differentiation transitions, and these differences influence the restrictive capacity of the particular cell type. Decreased A3G expression and susceptibility to HIV-1 occurs during differentiation of human monocytes to monocyte-derived macrophages (13Peng G. Greenwell-Wild T. Nares S. Jin W. Lei K.J. Rangel Z.G. Munson P.J. Wahl S.M. Blood. 2007; 110: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Conversely, increased A3G expression with enhanced resistance to HIV-1 occurs during dendritic cell maturation (14Pion M. Granelli-Piperno A. Mangeat B. Stalder R. Correa R. Steinman R.M. Piguet V. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 2887-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Finally, decreased levels of A3G have been noted in the CD4+ T helper 2 (Th2) subset, compared with T helper 1 (Th1) cells (15Vetter M.L. Johnson M.E. Antons A.K. Unutmaz D. D'Aquila R.T. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000292Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that A3G is an important part of an effective innate immune response (16Biasin M.

https://openalex.org/W2048463724,"Alphaviruses are enveloped arboviruses. The viral envelope is derived from the host cell and is positioned between two icosahedral protein shells (T = 4). Because the viral envelope contains glycoproteins involved in cell recognition and entry, the integrity of the envelope is critical for the success of the early events of infection. Differing levels of cholesterol in different hosts leads to the production of alphaviruses with distinct levels of this sterol loaded in the envelope. Using Mayaro virus, a New World alphavirus, we investigated the role of cholesterol on the envelope of alphavirus particles assembled in either mammalian or mosquito cells. Our results show that although quite different in their cholesterol content, Mayaro virus particles obtained from both cells share a similar high level of lateral organization in their envelopes. This organization, as well as viral stability and infectivity, is severely compromised when cholesterol is depleted from the envelope of virus particles isolated from mammalian cells, but virus particles isolated from mosquito cells are relatively unaffected by cholesterol depletion. We suggest that it is not cholesterol itself, but rather the organization of the viral envelope, that is critical for the biological activity of alphaviruses."

The ability of cells to transit between mesenchymal and amoeboid modes of migration has complicated the development of successful therapies designed to target cell migration as a means of inhibiting metastasis. Therefore, investigations of the mechanisms that regulate cell migration and render cells stationary are necessary. Tropomyosins are actin-associating proteins that regulate the activity of several effectors of actin filament dynamics. Previously, we have shown that the tropomyosin isoform Tm5NM1 stabilizes actin filaments and inhibits cell migration in a two-dimensional culture system. Here, we show that Tm5NM1 inhibits the mesenchymal migration of multiple cell lines in an isoform-specific manner. Tm5NM1 stimulates the downregulation of Src kinase activity and a rounded or elliptical morphology in three-dimensional collagen gels, and cells have dramatically reduced capacity to form pseudopodia. Importantly, we find that Tm5NM1 inhibits both the mesenchymal to amoeboid and amoeboid to mesenchymal transitions. Collectively, our data suggest that mimicking the action of Tm5NM1 overexpression represents an approach for effectively inhibiting the mesenchymal mode of migration."

During adult stage development, fetal hemoglobin (HbF 2The abbreviations used are: HbFfetal hemoglobinHDAChistone deacetylaseHDRPhistone deacetylase-related proteinNaBsodium butyrateTSAtrichostatin ART-qPCRreverse transcription-quantitative PCRqPCRquantitative PCRPIpropidium iodinepTarTpTargetac-H3acetylated histone H3.; α2γ2) production reaches a basal level of less than 2% of total hemoglobin (1Stamatoyannopoulos G.

Understanding the molecular events involved in γ-globin gene reactivation has been the focus of intense investigation for more than 2 decades, with a potential application for the treatment of sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia. Molecular events known to promote γ-globin expression include binding of developmental stage-specific transcription factors, such as fetal Kruppel-like factor, to the γ-globin promoter CACCC box element (2Asano H.

Moreover, epigenetic modifications during erythroid maturation that allows interactions between the β-globin locus control region and the γ-globin gene promoters (4Stamatoyannopoulos G. Exp.

Various pharmacological agents, such as butyrate, decitabine, and hydroxyurea, have been shown to induce HbF synthesis in vitro and in vivo (6Perrine S.P. Olivieri N.F. Faller D.V. Vichinsky E.P.

Moyer M.A. Moore J.W. Blood. 1987; 69: 109-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our laboratory has shown that histone deacetylase inhibitors, including sodium butyrate (NaB) and trichostatin A (TSA), induce γ-globin gene expression via the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade (10Pace B.S. Qian X. Ofori-Acquah S.F. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 50: 43-51PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sangerman J. Lee M.S. Yao X. Oteng E. Hsiao C.H. Li W. Zein S. Ofori-Acquah S.F. Pace B.S. Blood. 2006; 108: 3590-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Generalized acetylation of histones to confer chromatin accessibility is considered the main mechanism by which γ-globin gene activation is accomplished by HDAC inhibitors; however, other HbF inducers worked independently of histone hyperacetylation (12Boosalis M.S.

Anticancer Drugs. 2005; 16: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A better understanding of the role of chromatin-modifying proteins would be useful for the development of more potent HbF inducers for therapeutic purposes. Currently, 18 mammalian HDAC genes have been identified that have been classified into four groups based on sequence homologies (15Yang X.J. Seto E. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5310-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Class I HDAC genes (HDAC1, -2, -3, and -8) are nuclear proteins with ubiquitous expression. Previous investigations in the globin field have primarily focused on understanding the role of Class I HDAC genes in γ-globin gene regulation. Interaction of HDAC1 with NE-F4 minimizes its activation potential at the γ-promoter in fetal erythroid cells (16Zhao Q. Cumming H. Cerruti L. Cunningham J.M. Jane S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41477-41486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). During γ- to β-globin switching, HDAC1 and the chromatin remodeling protein Mi-2 contribute to γ-globin silencing (17Bottardi S. Ross J. Bourgoin V. Fotouhi-Ardakani N. Affar el B. Trudel M. Milot E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 1526-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that the short chain fatty acid RB7 mediated displacement of HDAC3 and its adapter protein, NcoR (nuclear receptor co-repressor) from the γ-globin promoter to stimulate transcription (18Mankidy R. Faller D.V. Mabaera R. Lowrey C.H. Boosalis M.S. White G.L. Castaneda S.A. Perrine S.P. Blood. 2006; 108: 3179-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, limited investigations have been performed to determine the role of Class II HDAC genes (HDAC4, -5, -6, -7, -9, and -10) in γ-globin gene regulation. These proteins display tissue-specific expression and have the ability to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells. HDACs remove the acetyl group from histones and are associated with a variety of repressor proteins; thus, HDACs are generally viewed as transcriptional co-repressors (19Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In addition to histones, HDACs deacetylate non-histone proteins, including a variety of transcription factors and many regulators involved in cell signaling or metabolism (15Yang X.J. Seto E. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5310-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 20Glozak M.A. Sengupta N. Zhang X. Seto E. Gene. 2005; 363: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Contrasting studies have also shown the association of HDACs with gene activation (21Wang Z. Zang C. Cui K. Schones D.E. Barski A. Peng W. Zhao K. Cell. 2009; 138: 1019-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar) and deacetylation of certain proteins required for transcription activation signals (22Nusinzon I. Horvath C.M. Sci. STKE 2005. 2005; : re11Google Scholar). These observations support the dynamic role of HDACs as co-repressors and co-activators in their overall control of gene expression (23Smith C.L. BioEssays. 2008; 30: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The objective of our study was to identify Class II HDAC genes involved in γ-globin gene regulation. We first screened for changes in expression of Class II HDAC subtypes in response to the HbF inducers NaB, TSA, and hemin. Interestingly, the expression of HDAC9 and histone deacetylase-related protein (HDRP), a spliced variant of HDAC9 lacking the catalytic domain, were significantly decreased by all three drugs in K562 cells. These data provided indirect evidence that they might be involved in the γ-globin gene regulation. Subsequent data generated using siRNA knockdown and enforced HDAC9 expression mediated a positive regulatory effect on γ-globin gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated in vivo HDAC9 and HDAC1 binding in the upstream Gγ-globin promoter. Studies in primary erythroid progenitors confirmed the ability of HDAC9 to activate γ-globin gene expression in early and late erythroid progenitors. The implications of these findings in γ-globin gene regulation are discussed. K562 erythroleukemia cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For drug induction studies, 3 million cells were treated for 48 h with 50 μm hemin, 2 mm NaB, or 0.5 μm TSA. Cell counts and viability were measured using 0.4% trypan blue stain. Drugs and antibiotics were purchased from Sigma. To quantify gene expression levels, total RNA was isolated using RNA Stat-60TM (TEL-TEST “B” Inc., Friendswood, TX) and used for RT-qPCR analysis as described previously (11Sangerman J. Lee M.S. Yao X. Oteng E. Hsiao C.H. Li W. Zein S. Ofori-Acquah S.F. Pace B.S. Blood. 2006; 108: 3590-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA was generated from total RNA using the Improm-II reverse transcriptase system and oligo(dT) 15 primers (Promega, Madison, WI). qPCR was performed on an iCycler (Bio-Rad) using SYBR Green iQ Supermix (Bio-Rad) and 10 pm gene-specific primers. Levels of γ-globin, β-globin, and the internal control GAPDH mRNA were quantified as follows. Standard curves were generated using serial 10-fold dilutions of Topo7 base plasmids carrying the γ-globin cDNA sequences (Topo7-γ-globin), Topo7-β-globin, and Topo7-GAPDH plasmids. For expression profiling of Class II HDAC genes, standard curves were generated with 10-fold dilutions of genomic DNA (from 500 ng to 0.5 ng) and HDAC gene-specific primers (Table 1). All gene mRNA levels were calculated as a ratio of GAPDH.TABLE 1Primers used for RT-qPCR analysis of Class II HDAC genesHDAC geneGene IDPrimer sequencePCR productbpHDAC4 (forward)NM_0060375′-GTTCCAGAGGCAGCACGAG-3′267HDAC4 (reverse)5′-TTGAGGACAAATTCTTGTAACTTCA-3′HDAC5 (forward)NM_0054745′-GGAGGGGGAAGTCGTCTC-3′229HDAC5 (reverse)5′-GCCAGCACTGAGGTAAAGC-3′HDAC6 (forward)NM_0060445′-AGCGGAGGTAAAGAAGAAAGGCAAAATG-3′418HDAC6 (reverse)5′-CCAGGCAGGCACAGGAGTATGAGTT-3′HDAC7 (forward)NM_0154015′-AGCGCCTGCACCACCACCTCTTCCT-3′547HDAC7 (reverse)5′-CCTGATGCGGGCGTGCTGCTACTACT-3′HDAC9 (forward)NM_1784235′-CCAGCCACCCTCATGTTACT-3′300HDAC9 (reverse)5′-TGCTGCTGGTATTGCTTCTG-3′HDAC10 (forward)NM_0320195′-TGGCACCGCTATGAGCAT-3′202HDAC10 (reverse)5′-GAGACCAGCACCAGCTCAG-3′HDRP (forward)NM_0147075′-AACTTGAAGGTGCGGTCCA-3′1008HDRP (reverse)5′-TTACAAATCCTGGAGCTAAAT-3′ Open table in a new tab To test the effects of drug treatments on cell cycle progression, we performed PI stain after NaB and TSA treatments. One million K562 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed in 70% ethanol at 4 °C for 45 min. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 500 μl of PI staining solution composed of 50 μg/ml PI, 0.1 mg/ml RNase A, and 0.05% Triton X-100 on ice for 1 h in the dark. PI-stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCAlibur instrument with CellQuest analysis software (BD Biosciences). For each sample, 10,000 cells were analyzed, and a histogram was plotted with FL2-W on the x axis and cell count on the y axis. The fluorescence levels were collected using the FL-2 filter at 470 V. Appropriate gates were set to quantify the distribution of cells in the different stages of the cell cycle. For gene silencing studies, K562 cells were transfected with SMARTpool siRNAs for HDAC7, HDAC9, HDAC10, and HDRP (M-series, Dharmacon) by OligofectamineTM (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. The siRNA for HDAC9 (siHDAC9, M-005241-03, Dharmacon) targeting exons 3, 7, 9, and 10 was used at different concentrations of 80, 160, and 320 nm. For the 80 nm reaction, 1 μl of a 20 μm stock solution of siHDAC9 was diluted with 40 μl of Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium, and then 1 μl of Oligofectamine diluted in 8 μl of Opti-MEM was added and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Control reactions included scrambled siRNAs (80 nm) or Oligofectamine containing only Opti-Medium (mock). To complete the transfections, 50,000 cells were suspended in 250 μl of Opti-MEM I, and then the siRNA-Oligofectamine was mixed in 24-well plates. After 4 h of incubation, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 30% fetal bovine serum were added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Transient enforced gene expression studies were performed as described previously (24Yao X. Kodeboyina S. Liu L. Dzandu J. Sangerman J. Ofori-Acquah S.F. Pace B.S. Exp. Hematol. 2009; 37: 889-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) using 10 million K562 cells and 10, 20, 30, and 40 μg of empty vector control pTarget (pTarT) or pTarget-HDAC9 (pTarT-HDAC9) expression vector carrying a FLAG tag. Cells were transfected using a GenePulser machine (Bio-Rad) at 260 V and 975 microfarads and then incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Total RNA and protein were harvested to perform RT-qPCR or Western blot analysis, respectively. For combined knockdown and rescue experiments, K562 cells were transfected simultaneously with SMARTpool siHDAC9 and a pTarT-HDAC9, pcDNA3.1-HDAC1, pcDNA3.1-HDAC7, or pMT3-HDAC10 expression vector; the respective empty vector controls were also tested, and γ-globin expression levels were normalized by subtracting empty control values. Transfections were performed using a Nucleofector device and a K562-Nucleofector kit (Amaxa Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 100 μl of Nucleofector solution was mixed with 5 million K562 cells and then siHDAC9 (160 nm) and 15 μg of pTarT, pTarT-HDAC9, pMT3, or pMT3-HDAC10 expression vector. Control experiments included mock (no DNA) and scrambled siRNA (160 nm) reactions. Cells were electroporated using the T-016 Amaxa program and incubated for 48 h, and then RNA was isolated for RT-qPCR analysis of γ-globin, HDAC9, HDAC10, and actin gene expression. K562 cells from the different experimental conditions were mixed with lysis buffer (Promega) to isolate total protein that was quantified by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). For Western blot analysis, 150 μg of protein was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (F-1804, Sigma) primary antibody (1:1000) was used to quantify FLAG-HDAC9 levels for enforced expression studies. Goat polyclonal HDAC9 (1:500 dilution) or mouse monoclonal HDAC7 (1:5000) primary antibody (from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-10408) and Abcam (ab50212), respectively) was used to measure endogenous HDAC9 and HDAC7 mRNA levels in siRNA studies. Membranes were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Actin antibody (Chemicon Millipore, Billerica, MA) (MAB1501) was used as a loading control. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Pierce (catalog nos. 31400 and 31430, respectively), the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) was used to visualize proteins, and band intensities were quantified using the ChemiDoc System (Bio-Rad). ChIP assays were performed in untreated K562 cells and after NaB (2 mm) and TSA (0.5 μm) drug treatments as described previously (11Sangerman J. Lee M.S. Yao X. Oteng E. Hsiao C.H. Li W. Zein S.

Briefly, 40 million cells from different conditions were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde. After cell lysis, nuclei were sonicated using a Sonicator 3000 (Misonix, Farmingdale, NY) for 3–5 pulses at 10 W and output level 5 on ice to generate about 250–500-bp DNA fragments. Immunoprecipitation reactions were performed with HDAC1 (sc-7872) or HDAC9 (sc-10408) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). TFIID (sc-204X), IgG (Sigma), and no antibody reactions were set up as controls. After reverse cross-linking at 65 °C, chromatin was purified by ethanol precipitation and used for qPCR analysis with primers covering approximately 2000 bases of the Gγ and Aγ-globin gene promoters (Table 2). Acetylated histone H3 (ac-H3) levels in the γ-globin gene promoters were used as a positive control.TABLE 2Primers used for qPCR analysis of chromatin enrichment produced by ChIP assayGlobin geneaG/A, Gγ/Aγ promoters; F, forward; R, reverse.Primer positionPrimer sequencePCR productbpG/A-1F−467 to −4475′-TCAAAAATCCTGGACCTATG-3′290G/A-1R−182 to −1915′-TTGAGATAGTGTGGGGAAGG-3′G/A-2F−825 to −8075′-AAAACCCTGGGTCATCAGC-3′390G/A-2R−434 to −4575′-TGTGAAATGTGTTTTAGGCATAGG-3′G/A-3F−1091 to −10705′-TCCAATATGTCAGAAACAGCAC-3′268G/A-3R−801 to −8195′-CTGATGACCCAGGGTTTTG-3′G/A-4F−1360 to −13375′-GAGCAGATATAAGCCTTACACAGG-3′305G/A-4R−1070 to −10925′-CAGTGCTGTTTCTGACATATTGG-3′G-5F−1714 to −16905′-TCTTAAAGGTCAGGCTCTACAAATG-3′379A-5F−1717 to −16955′-GCCATCACTCACTACCATTTCA-3′385G/A-5R−1331 to −3545′-CCTGTGTAAAGCTTATATCTGCTCA-3′A-6F−2013 to −19925′-CCACTTGTCCTCTGTGTTTCAG-3′307A-6R−1707 to −17285′-GAGTGATGGCATTTGAAGTGG-3′G-7F−2015 to −19975′-GCAGATCACCTGAGGTCAAGA-3′309G-7R−1706 to −17315′-CCTTTAAGAATGTGTCAGAGACTGG-3′a G/A, Gγ/Aγ promoters; F, forward; R, reverse. Open table in a new tab Primary erythroid progenitors were grown from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells purchased from Carter BloodCare (Fort Worth, TX) in accordance with guidelines of the Institutional Review Board at the University of Texas at Dallas. Erythroid progenitors were generated using the Fibach method (25Fibach E. Rachmilewitz E.A. Stem Cells. 1993; 11: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). During phase 1, cells were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 30% fetal bovine serum and 50 ng/ml each of granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-3 and -6, and stem cell factor. To initiate phase 2 on day 7, the medium was changed, and erythropoietin (3 units/ml) and stem cell factor (50 ng/ml) were added. Cells were harvested on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 for cytospin preparations stained with Giemsa and RT-qPCR analysis to measure γ-globin, β-globin, and GAPDH levels. The γ/γ + β and β/γ + β levels were calculated after each gene mRNA level was normalized by GAPDH. For siRNA experiments, erythroid cells were transfected on day 11 and day 28 using a Nucleofector device and the CD34+-Nucleofector kit (Amaxa). Briefly, 1 million cells were mixed with 100 μl of Nucleofector solution and siHDAC9 at 80 and 320 nm concentrations in triplicates. Cells were electroporated on the U-08 setting for erythroid progenitors and incubated for 72 h. Similar experimental settings were used to perform enforced expression studies with 5 million primary cells. Cells were electroporated with 5, 10, and 15 μg of pTarT or pTarT-HDAC9 expression vector or 2 μg of the control pMAxGFP reporter (Amaxa) to monitor transfection efficiency. The percentage of GFP-positive cells determined at 24 h by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) was used to normalize gene expression levels quantified by RT-qPCR analysis. Cytospin cell preparations were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min and then permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 solution. Cells were then blocked in a 5% bovine serum albumin solution for 1 h at room temperature. Immunostaining was performed at 4 °C overnight with anti-HbF fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., Montgomery, TX). Cell nuclei were stained with mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Erythroid cells were photographed with an Olympus BX 51 phase-contrast epifluorescent microscope equipped with Hoffman Modulation optics. Phase-contrast images were recorded with a CCD camera (1100-s exposure), and fluorescence images were photographed through 485/20-nm emission and 540/35-nm excitation filters. Total hemoglobin was quantified using 20 μl of protein extract isolated from one million primary erythroid cells mixed with 5 ml of Drabkin's reagent (Sigma), and then cyanmethemoglobin was measured at 540 nm. HbF levels were measured using the human Hemoglobin F ELISA Quantitation Kit (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.). Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with sheep anti-human HbF antibody (1 mg/ml) blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin, and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1 mg/ml) was added. Raw data were analyzed in GraphPad PRISM (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA), and HbF levels were calculated as a ratio of total hemoglobin corrected for total protein levels for each sample (HbF/total Hb/total protein). The data are reported as the means ± S.E. from at least five data points generated from independent drug treatments or transfections. Data were analyzed by a two-tailed Student's t test, and values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA). Our initial screening studies were aimed at determining the possible involvement of Class II HDAC members in γ-globin regulation. HDAC gene-specific PCR primers were designed (Table 1) that produced amplification products from 300 to 500 bp. Changes in HDAC expression levels were quantified in K562 cells after treatment with the HbF inducers hemin (50 μm), TSA (0.5 μm), and NaB (2 mm) (26McElveen R.L. Lou T.F. Reese K. Xia S. Baliga B.S. Pace B.S. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 51: 215-227PubMed Google Scholar) for 48 h; γ-globin mRNA levels were monitored to ensure that adequate induction was achieved (Fig. 1A). We observed 4.2-, 2.8-, and 2.6-fold γ-gene induction by hemin, TSA, and NaB, respectively. The effects of HDAC inhibitors on cell cycle kinetics were monitored by PI stain and flow cytometry. NaB increased the number of cells in G0/G1 phase with a simultaneous decrease in G2/M cell counts (Fig. 1B). By contrast, TSA did not have a significant effect on cell cycle kinetics. In the same samples, steady state Class II HDAC mRNA levels were measured (Fig. 1C), which showed that hemin decreased HDAC6 (50%), HDAC7 (54%), HDAC9 (39%), and HDRP (95%) significantly (p < 0.05); hemin also increased HDAC4 expression 1.6-fold (p < 0.05). A similar analysis was performed for TSA, where we observed decreased HDAC9 and HDRP expression and a 2.4-fold increase in HDAC7. Finally, studies with NaB demonstrated its ability to repress HDAC4, -7, -9, and HDRP by 50–80% (Fig. 1B). By contrast, NaB significantly increased HDAC5 (1.6-fold) and HDAC10 (1.8-fold) gene expression. These studies demonstrated the diverse indirect effects of HbF inducers on HDAC gene expression and their potential role in γ-globin gene regulation. The most dramatic effects were observed for HDAC7, HDAC9, HDAC10, and HDRP; therefore, we performed siRNA studies to determine which protein might be directly involved in γ-globin expression. To investigate a possible direct role of the four HDACs, we determined whether gene silencing using siRNA molecules would alter γ-globin gene expression. K562 cells were transfected for 48 h with different siRNAs by Oligofectamine methods to screen for gene-specific silencing at the 80 nm concentration (Fig. 2A). We confirmed 50 and 42% knockdown of HDAC7 and HDAC10 mRNA levels, respectively, by its target siRNA, which did not reach statistical significance. By contrast, siHDAC9 and siRNA for HDRP showed 70 and 90% gene silencing, respectively, compared with scrambled control transfections (Fig. 2A); studies were also performed with siRNA for GAPDH. Because we had evidence of HDAC gene silencing in our system, we next performed dose-dependent siRNA silencing to determine if γ-globin gene transcription was affected by HDAC gene knockdown at the 80, 160, and 320 nm concentrations. We observed a 35% decrease in γ-globin expression at the 320 nm concentration of siRNA for HDAC7 (Fig. 2B). Although knockdown of HDAC9 produced a dose-dependent decrease in γ-globin mRNA levels of 20–50% (Fig. 2B), HDAC10 and HDRP knockdown did not alter γ-globin expression significantly. We then confirmed HDAC7 and HDAC9 knockdown by Western blot analysis. There was a dose-dependent 80% decrease in HDAC9 protein at the 320 nm concentration (Fig. 2C), whereas HDAC7 protein was silenced by 50% at the amounts tested (Fig. 2D). We also completed analyses to evaluate the potential off-target effects of siHDAC9 treatments. There were no significant changes in the mRNA levels of HDAC1 (0.9–1.2-fold change), HDAC7 (0.86–1.20-fold change), or HDAC10 (1.09–1.15-fold change) compared with scrambled siRNA in K562 cells treated with 320 nm siHDAC9. These results suggest that HDAC9 exerts a specific positive regulatory effect on γ-globin gene expression in K562 cells. To determine the direct regulatory effects of HDAC9 on γ-globin gene transcription, enforced expression studies were completed with the constitutively active pTarT-HDAC9 vector. K562 cells were transfected with 10, 20, 30, and 40 μg of pTarT-HDAC9 for 48 h, and then HDAC9, γ-globin, and GAPDH mRNA levels were quantified by RT-qPCR (see “Experimental Procedures”). A 30-fold increase in HDAC9 mRNA levels was produced at the 20-μg concentration (Fig. 3A). All HDAC9 mRNA values were normalized by GAPDH, and the effects of the empty vector (pTarT) were subtracted at each amount tested. Western blot performed with a FLAG antibody showed an increase in HDAC9 protein (Fig. 3A) starting at 10 μg. Interestingly, at the highest amounts of pTarT-HDAC9, a larger band appeared that might be due to protein modifications, such as phosphorylation or nonspecific antibody cross-reaction. To ascertain whether HDAC9 directly activates γ-globin transcription, mRNA levels were measured after enforced expression (Fig. 3B). We observed a maximal 3-fold increase in γ-globin mRNA levels at the 20- and 30-μg amounts of pTarT-HDAC9, confirming the ability of HDAC9 to stimulate γ-globin gene expression. To gain direct evidence for the ability of HDAC9 to exert a positive effect on γ-globin, we performed knockdown/rescue experiments in which K562 cells were transfected with siHDAC9 and pTart-HDAC9 simultaneously for 48 h (see “Experimental Procedures”). The results of these experiments are summarized in Fig. 3C. In the presence of 84% γ-globin gene silencing produced by 160 nm siHDAC9, we observed 5.3-fold (p = 0.0033) trans-activation by pTartT-HDAC9 compared with no rescue of γ-globin expression by HDAC1, HDAC7, or HDAC10. We observed a highly significant increase in target HDAC mRNA synthesis for all expression vectors after enforced expression (data not shown). We next asked the question whether HDAC9 interacts in the γ-globin promoter to produce its effects. ChIP assays were performed in K562 cells, to determine whether HDAC9 binds the γ-globin promoter in vivo. Eight overlapping primer sets (Table 2) were designed for RT-qPCR to measure chromatin enrichment for the region between −2000"

IntroductionDuring transcription of protein-coding genes, RNA polymerase II assembles on promoter DNA with general transcription factors, initiates transcription, escapes from the promoter, and elongates the RNA chain until a termination signal is reached. The transition from the initiation to the elongation phase of transcription goes along with phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II on its C-terminal domain (CTD), 5The abbreviations used are: CTDC-terminal domain6-AU6-azauracilssDNAsingle-stranded DNARPAreplication protein ATAPtandem affinity purification5-FOA5-fluoroorotic acidMMSmethyl methanesulfonateHUhydroxyureaRIDRPA interaction domainSDCsynthetic complete dextrose medium. a tail-like extension of its largest subunit that consists of heptapeptide repeats with the consensus sequence YSPTSPS.During transcription elongation, the CTD is phosphorylated mainly at Ser-2 residues by CDK9 (cyclin-dependent kinase 9), a subunit of pTEFb, and CDK12 (1.Cho E.J.

Adelman K. Lis J.T. Greenleaf A.L. Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 2303-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In yeast, two homologs of CDK9 and CDK12 are known, Bur1 and Ctk1, a subunit of the CTD kinase I complex, both of which catalyze Ser-2 phosphorylation of the CTD, with Bur1 most likely being orthologous to CDK9 and Ctk1 to CDK12 (Refs. 2.Bartkowiak B. Liu P. Phatnani H.P. Fuda N.J. Cooper J.J. Price D.H. Adelman K. Lis J.T. Greenleaf A.L. Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 2303-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar and 3.Wood A. Shilatifard A. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1066-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and references therein). Bur1 associates with its cognate cyclin Bur2 to form the Bur1-Bur2 complex. Bur2 is named a cyclin solely by homology, but its expression does not cycle. In addition to Ser-2 phosphorylation, Bur1-Bur2 phosphorylates promoter-distal Ser-7 residues (4.Tietjen J.R. Zhang D.W. Rodríguez-Molina J.B. White B.E. Akhtar M.S. Heidemann M. Li X. Chapman R.D. Shokat K. Keles S. Eick D. Ansari A.Z. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 1154-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Bur1-Bur2 is recruited to the 5′-region of transcribed genes and remains present in coding regions (5.Qiu H. Hu C.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 4852-4863Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Mutations of BUR1 lead to sensitivity to 6-azauracil (6-AU), a drug that depletes intracellular UTP and GTP levels and renders cells dependent on elongation factors (7.Yao S. Neiman A. Prelich G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7080-7087Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 8.Keogh M.C. Podolny V. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7005-7018Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, BUR1 interacts genetically with the TREX complex that functions in coupling transcription to nuclear mRNA export (9.Strässer K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M.

Hurt, unpublished data. further implicating Bur1-Bur2 in transcription elongation. Bur1-Bur2 is required for monoubiquitylation of histone H2B at Lys-123 by Rad6, for trimethylation of histone H3 at Lys-4 by Set1, and for methylation of histone H3 at Lys-36 by Set2 (10.Wood A.

Bur1-Bur2 function is further required for recruitment of the Paf1 complex by phosphorylation of the transcription elongation factor Spt5 (6.Liu Y. Warfield L. Zhang C. Luo J. Allen J. Lang W.H. Ranish J. Shokat K.M. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 4852-4863Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 13.Zhou K. Kuo W.H. Fillingham J. Greenblatt J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 6956-6961Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which was recently shown to be a Rad26-independent suppressor of transcription-coupled repair (14.Ding B. LeJeune D. Li S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 5317-5326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Another major DNA-associated cellular process is genome maintenance. Many kinds of DNA damage lead to the accumulation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in the cell. For example, the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination requires an initial resection of the double-strand break ends to produce 3′-single-stranded tails (reviewed in Ref. 15.Mimitou E.P. Symington L.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2009; 34: 264-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Likewise, replication forks that stall or collapse when encountering DNA damage may expose ssDNA (16.Sogo J.M. Lopes M. Foiani M. Science. 2002; 297: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). However, other DNA metabolic processes such as transcription may also transiently uncover ssDNA. In the cell, ssDNA is rapidly bound by the major ssDNA-binding protein, replication protein A (RPA), which serves to shield the DNA against degradation and the formation of toxic secondary structures (17.Alani E. Thresher R. Griffith J.D. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 54-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Accordingly, RPA plays essential roles in a range of processes such as DNA replication, nucleotide excision repair, and homologous recombination. In particular, RPA controls homologous recombination by recruiting the Rad52 protein to regions of ssDNA (18.Lisby M. Barlow J.H. Burgess R.C. Rothstein R. Cell. 2004; 118: 699-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 19.Barlow J.H. Lisby M. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 73-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The substantial recruitment of Rad52 to even a single double-strand break results in a Rad52 focus that can be visualized by fluorescence microscopy of YFP-tagged Rad52 (18.Lisby M. Barlow J.H. Burgess R.C. Rothstein R. Cell. 2004; 118: 699-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Rad52 is responsible for recruiting the Rad51 recombinase and several downstream accessory recombination proteins and is thus essential for the homologous recombination pathway in budding yeast (20.Krogh B.O. Symington L.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 233-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). RPA is also responsible for recruiting the Mec1-Ddc2 (homolog of human ATR-ATRIP) checkpoint complex to sites of DNA damage (18.Lisby M. Barlow J.H. Burgess R.C. Rothstein R. Cell. 2004; 118: 699-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 21.Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar).Here, we show that the transcription elongation factor Bur1-Bur2 interacts physically with RPA. Importantly, mutation of BUR1 leads to a deregulated DNA damage response. The C terminus of Bur1 interacts with RPA, and deletion of the Bur1 C terminus consistently leads to a defect in DNA repair. Interestingly, mutation of BUR1 suppresses the defects of an rfa1 mutant, indicating that these two protein complexes are functionally linked. In summary, we show that the transcription elongation factor Bur1-Bur2 has a second function in the replication stress response, which requires its RPA interaction domain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and PlasmidsYeast strains and plasmids are listed in supplemental Tables S1 and S2, respectively. Tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged strains were generated by integration of the TAP tag C-terminal of the respective gene by homologous recombination as described (22.Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Séraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). BUR1, RFA1, RFA2, and RFA3 shuffle strains were obtained as heterozygous diploids from EUROSCARF; transformed with pRS316-BUR1, pRS316-RFA1, pRS316-RFA2, or pRS316-RFA3, respectively; and sporulated. Shuffle strains identified by tetrad analysis were crossed to RS453. Double mutant strains were obtained by crossing the respective single mutant strains.Generation of Temperature-sensitive bur1 and rfa1 AllelesTo generate temperature-sensitive alleles of BUR1 and RFA1, 20 μg of plasmid pRS315-BUR1 and pRS315-RFA1, respectively, were incubated in 500 μl of 1 m hydroxylamine buffer for 20 h at 50 °C. The BUR1 or RFA1 shuffle strain was transformed with the mutagenized plasmid, and cells were grown on SDC(−Leu) plates for 3 days at 30 °C in the dark. About 3000 and 3800 colonies, respectively, were picked and restreaked on 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA)-containing plates at 30 °C. These plates were replica-plated onto YPD plates and incubated at 30 and 37 °C. Four bur1-ts mutants (bur1-1, bur1-4, bur1-7, and bur1-24) and one rfa1-ts mutant (rfa1-249) were derived from these screens. The plasmids were recovered and reintroduced into the BUR1 or RFA1 shuffle strain, respectively, to verify the temperature-sensitive phenotype. The obtained temperature-sensitive mutants were sequenced and led to the following mutations: bur1-101 (P230Y, K324N, P447L, and K630R), bur1-104 (A263V), bur1-107 (G51R and G222N), bur1-124 (R106STOP), and rfa1-249 (A364T, P515L, and E607K). These alleles are recessive.Yeast GeneticsTo test the functionality of Bur1 domains, plasmids expressing full-length Bur1 (pRS315-BUR1-TADH1, positive control), the kinase domain of Bur1 (pRS315-bur1-ΔC), or the C terminus of Bur1 (pRS315-bur1-C-TADH1) and pRS315-TADH1 (negative control) were transformed into the BUR1 shuffle strain and restreaked onto 5-FOA-containing plates to shuffle out the URA3 plasmid encoding BUR1. Growth indicates functionality of the BUR1 construct. To assess epistasis between bur1-ts mutants and null mutants in different DNA repair pathways, the BUR1 shuffle strain was mated to a shuffle strain carrying the indicated deletion of a gene involved in one of the repair pathways. The respective double shuffle strains identified after tetrad analysis were transformed with plasmids encoding wild-type (BUR1) or bur1-ts mutants and a plasmid encoding the “DNA repair pathway gene” or an empty plasmid.TAP PurificationAffinity purification of TAP-tagged proteins was performed as described previously (22.Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Séraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). Copurifying proteins were analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis, Coomassie Blue staining, and identification by mass spectrometry or Western blotting using an antibody directed against Bur1. The anti-Bur1 antibody was generated by immunization of rabbits with recombinant Bur1-C (amino acids 365–657). Where stated, whole cell extracts were treated with 100 μg/ml DNase for 30 min at 23 °C to eliminate DNA prior to TAP purification.Bur1-RPA Binding AssaysRPA was TAP-purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing Rfa1-TAP, including a washing step with TAP buffer containing 1 m NaCl (9.Strässer K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Rondón A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Bur1 truncations were expressed in BL21 cells from plasmid pGEX-4T-3 (GE Healthcare), purified using GSH beads, washed with TAP buffer containing 1 m NaCl, and resuspended in TAP buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. Bur1 fragments bound to GSH beads were incubated in TAP buffer with RPA, washed, and eluted with sample buffer and boiling.Fluorescence MicroscopyPrior to live cell imaging, cells were grown to an A600 of 0.2–0.3 with shaking in liquid synthetic complete medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml adenine, harvested by centrifugation at 2500 rpm, and processed for fluorescence microscopy as described previously (23.Lisby M. Rothstein R. Mortensen U.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8276-8282Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Fluorophores were visualized using band-pass YFP (catalog no. 41028) and RFP (catalog no. 41002c) filter sets from Chroma (Brattleboro, VT). Digital images were acquired on a Zeiss AxioImager Z1 (Brock & Michelsen) using Volocity (Improvision, Coventry, United Kingdom) and prepared for publication using Adobe Photoshop. For time-lapse microscopy of Rad52-YFP, cultures were diluted to 5 × 105 cells/ml, and a 10% neutral density filter was used.Drug Sensitivity AssaysTo test the sensitivity of the diverse mutants to drugs impairing transcription (6-AU), increasing DNA damage (methyl methanesulfonate (MMS)), or causing replication stress (hydroxyurea (HU)), 10-fold serial dilutions of these strains were spotted on YPD or selective SDC plates containing 100 μg/ml 6-AU; 0.005, 0.02, or 0.035% MMS; or 1, 25, or 100 mm HU as indicated. Plates were incubated at 30 or 33 °C for 2–4 days.Genome-wide Expression ProfilingCells for the microarray analysis were grown in YPD and treated with 0.1% MMS for 1 h. RNA was extracted with phenol and purified with the Qiagen RNeasy MinElute kit. Experiments were performed in biological triplicates.Microarray HandlingYeast RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Yeast Genome 2.0 arrays essentially as described (24.Dengl S. Mayer A. Sun M. Cramer P. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 389: 211-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To minimize errors, samples were processed in parallel, and arrays were scanned the same day. Biological triplicate measurements were performed for the wild-type strain, bur1-107, and rfa1-249. Biological duplicate measurements were done for the bur1-107 rfa1-249 double mutant strain because one sample was identified to be an outlier.Gene Expression Data AnalysisRaw signal intensities for each probe set as they are contained in the CEL files were analyzed using Partek Genomics Suite Version 6.3. Data were filtered by application of an expanded mask file that was based on the s_cerevisiae.msk file of Affymetrix to mask Schizosaccharomyces pombe probe sets, unspecific probe sets, and replicate probe sets of S. cerevisiae. The robust multiarray average normalization method (25.Irizarry R.A. Hobbs B. Collin F. Beazer-Barclay Y.D. Antonellis K.J. Scherf U. Speed T.P. Biostatistics. 2003; 4: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (8380) Google Scholar) was used for robust multiarray average background correction, quantile normalization, and median polish probe set summarization. Expression values were transformed to log2 before statistical analysis. A sample intensity plot was calculated, showing that the data are normally distributed for all samples with the exception of one sample of the bur1-107 rfa1-249 double mutant strain. A principal component analysis confirmed the double mutant sample as an outlier, and it was excluded from further analysis. Genes that were differentially expressed between wild-type and mutant strains were detected with one-way analysis of variance, implemented in Partek. A linear contrast was used to compare mutant samples with base-line wild-type samples. The recovered p values of the comparisons were then corrected using a step-up false discovery rate value of 5% (26.Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. J. R. Stat. Soc. B. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar). The resulting list of significantly expressed genes was filtered to include only genes that demonstrated 2-fold or greater up- or down-regulation. Only over-represented biological process terms with a recovered p value <0.05 were considered. Microarray data were deposited in the ArrayExpress Database with accession number E-MEXP-2536.Hierarchical Cluster and Correlation AnalysisHierarchical cluster analysis was performed with microarray data of bur1-107, rfa1-249, and bur1-107 rfa1-249 mutant yeast strains. In total, the hierarchical cluster analysis was performed for 115 significantly altered genes. Hierarchical cluster analysis was calculated using the TIGR MeV application (27.Saeed A.I. Sharov V. White J. Li J. Liang W. Bhagabati N. Braisted J. Klapa M. Currier T. Thiagarajan M. Sturn A. Snuffin M. Rezantsev A. Popov D. Ryltsov A. Kostukovich E. Borisovsky I. Liu Z. Vinsavich A. Trush V. Quackenbush J. BioTechniques. 2003; 34: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar), choosing average linkage as the linkage method and Euclidean distance as the distance metric. Pearson's correlation was calculated in Microsoft Excel. The respective correlation coefficient (r-value) was calculated for each pair of mutant strains and was based on the respective lists of significantly altered genes.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have identified a physical and genetic interaction between Bur1-Bur2 and the eukaryotic ssDNA-binding protein RPA, which is important for the cellular response to genotoxic stress. Mutations in BUR1 led to increased sensitivity to MMS and HU, which caused replication fork stalling. This function of Bur1-Bur2 is most likely mediated by its interaction with RPA because a C-terminal deletion mutant of BUR1 that abolished the RPA interaction also exhibited sensitivity to MMS and HU. However, RPA did not seem to be a substrate of Bur1-Bur2 kinase activity (data not shown). Genome-wide transcriptome analyses of bur1-107 and rfa1-249 mutants showed no common impact on transcription, and importantly, genes required for resistance to MMS exhibited wild-type levels of expression, indicating that the DNA damage sensitivity of bur1-107 and rfa1-249 mutants is unlikely to be due to a change in transcription proficiency.Fluorescence microscopy indicated that the bur1-107 mutant failed to suppress Rad52 recruitment to stalled replication forks in the presence of HU, which is a feature reminiscent of a Δmec1 mutant that fails to stabilize stalled replication forks (18.Lisby M. Barlow J.H. Burgess R.C. Rothstein R. Cell. 2004; 118: 699-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 34.Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F. Nature. 2001; 412: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Consistently, the bur1-107 mutation suppressed the HU sensitivity of a Δmec1 mutant, indicating that Bur1 acts upstream of Mec1 in stabilization of stalled replication forks and that, in its absence, replication forks collapse, leading to double-strand breaks and persisting Rad52 foci (Fig. 8). This model is consistent with the report that RPA is responsible for the accumulation of the Mec1-Ddc2 checkpoint complex at stalled replication forks in HU-treated cells (18.Lisby M. Barlow J.H. Burgess R.C. Rothstein R. Cell. 2004; 118: 699-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 21.Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar), a process that could be stimulated by the interaction of Bur1 with RPA. Furthermore, using time-lapse microscopy, we showed that the observed increase in spontaneous Rad52 and Rfa1 foci in the bur1-107 mutant in the absence of exogenous replication stress was due primarily to a persistence of foci rather than a higher frequency of focus formation (Fig. 5). This observation suggests that BUR1 mutation reduces the efficiency of recombinational DNA repair. Intriguingly, the rfa1-249 and Δmec1 mutations exhibited similar genetic interactions with bur1-107, suggesting that rfa1-249 is defective in Mec1-dependent fork stabilization during replication stress (Fig. 8).Furthermore, Bur1-Bur2 is required for monoubiquitylation of histone H2B at Lys-123 by Rad6 (11.Laribee R.N. Krogan N.J. Xiao T. Shibata Y. Hughes T.R. Greenblatt J.F. Strahl B.D. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1487-1493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), which facilitates efficient homologous recombination in response to ionizing radiation (35.Game J.C. Williamson M.S. Spicakova T. Brown J.M. Genetics. 2006; 173: 1951-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the sensitivity of bur1 mutants to replication stress is due to a failure to ubiquitylate histone H2B at stalled replication forks.A recent study in human cells shows that CDK9, the mammalian homolog of Bur1, is also required during the DNA replication stress response (36.Yu D.S. Zhao R. Hsu E.L. Cayer J. Ye F. Guo Y. Shyr Y. Cortez D. EMBO Rep. 2010; 11: 876-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This function of CDK9 is specific for the CDK9-cyclin K complex and is independent of the CDK9-cyclin T1, T2a, and T2b complexes, which act to promote transcription elongation, suggesting that the roles of CDK9 in transcription and the replication stress response are separate. Similarly, we found that the CTD and RPA interaction domains of Bur1 are overlapping, suggesting that the two functions of Bur1 in budding yeast are also separate. Notably, CDK9 interacts directly with ATR-ATRIP and claspin, but not with RPA, which contrasts with our finding of a direct interaction between Bur1-Bur2 and RPA (36.Yu D.S. Zhao R. Hsu E.L. Cayer J. Ye F. Guo Y. Shyr Y. Cortez D. EMBO Rep. 2010; 11: 876-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In summary, we have found a novel biochemical and genetic interaction between the transcription elongation factor Bur1-Bur2 and the ssDNA-binding protein RPA, which is required for resistance to genotoxic stress that causes replication fork stalling and/or collapse.

Mutations of BUR1 lead to sensitivity to 6-azauracil (6-AU), a drug that depletes intracellular UTP and GTP levels and renders cells dependent on elongation factors (7.Yao S. Neiman A. Prelich G.

Bur1-Bur2 is required for monoubiquitylation of histone H2B at Lys-123 by Rad6, for trimethylation of histone H3 at Lys-4 by Set1, and for methylation of histone H3 at Lys-36 by Set2 (10.Wood A.

Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 5317-5326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Another major DNA-associated cellular process is genome maintenance. Many kinds of DNA damage lead to the accumulation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in the cell. For example, the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination requires an initial resection of the double-strand break ends to produce 3′-single-stranded tails (reviewed in Ref. 15.Mimitou E.P. Symington L.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2009; 34: 264-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Likewise, replication forks that stall or collapse when encountering DNA damage may expose ssDNA (16.Sogo J.M. Lopes M. Foiani M. Science. 2002; 297: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). However, other DNA metabolic processes such as transcription may also transiently uncover ssDNA. In the cell, ssDNA is rapidly bound by the major ssDNA-binding protein, replication protein A (RPA), which serves to shield the DNA against degradation and the formation of toxic secondary structures (17.Alani E. Thresher R. Griffith J.D. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 54-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Accordingly, RPA plays essential roles in a range of processes such as DNA replication, nucleotide excision repair, and homologous recombination. In particular, RPA controls homologous recombination by recruiting the Rad52 protein to regions of ssDNA (18.Lisby M. Barlow J.H. Burgess R.C. Rothstein R. Cell. 2004; 118: 699-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 19.Barlow J.H. Lisby M. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 73-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The substantial recruitment of Rad52 to even a single double-strand break results in a Rad52 focus that can be visualized by fluorescence microscopy of YFP-tagged Rad52 (18.Lisby M. Barlow J.H. Burgess R.C. Rothstein R. Cell. 2004; 118: 699-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Rad52 is responsible for recruiting the Rad51 recombinase and several downstream accessory recombination proteins and is thus essential for the homologous recombination pathway in budding yeast (20.Krogh B.O. Symington L.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 233-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). RPA is also responsible for recruiting the Mec1-Ddc2 (homolog of human ATR-ATRIP) checkpoint complex to sites of DNA damage (18.Lisby M. Barlow J.H. Burgess R.C. Rothstein R. Cell. 2004; 118: 699-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 21.Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar).Here, we show that the transcription elongation factor Bur1-Bur2 interacts physically with RPA. Importantly, mutation of BUR1 leads to a deregulated DNA damage response. The C terminus of Bur1 interacts with RPA, and deletion of the Bur1 C terminus consistently leads to a defect in DNA repair. Interestingly, mutation of BUR1 suppresses the defects of an rfa1 mutant, indicating that these two protein complexes are functionally linked. In summary, we show that the transcription elongation factor Bur1-Bur2 has a second function in the replication stress response, which requires its RPA interaction domain."
https://openalex.org/W1995428490,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate reductase (MtAPR) is an iron-sulfur protein and a validated target to develop new antitubercular agents, particularly for the treatment of latent infection. The enzyme harbors a [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster that is coordinated by four cysteinyl ligands, two of which are adjacent in the amino acid sequence. The iron-sulfur cluster is essential for catalysis; however, the precise role of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in APR remains unknown. Progress in this area has been hampered by the failure to generate a paramagnetic state of the [4Fe-4S] cluster that can be studied by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Herein, we overcome this limitation and report the EPR spectra of MtAPR in the [4Fe-4S](+) state. The EPR signal is rhombic and consists of two overlapping S = &frac12; species. Substrate binding to MtAPR led to a marked increase in the intensity and resolution of the EPR signal and to minor shifts in principle g values that were not observed among a panel of substrate analogs, including adenosine 5'-diphosphate. Using site-directed mutagenesis, in conjunction with kinetic and EPR studies, we have also identified an essential role for the active site residue Lys-144, whose side chain interacts with both the iron-sulfur cluster and the sulfate group of adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate. The implications of these findings are discussed with respect to the role of the iron-sulfur cluster in the catalytic mechanism of APR."
https://openalex.org/W2036753586,"Although the mechanisms of generation of signals that control transcriptional activation of Type III IFN (IFNλ)-regulated genes have been identified, very little is known about the mechanisms by which the IFNλ receptor generates signals for mRNA translation of IFNλ-activated genes. We provide evidence that IFNλ activates the p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (RSK1) and its downstream effector, initiation factor eIF4B. Prior to its engagement by the IFNλ receptor, the non-active form of RSK1 is present in a complex with the translational repressor 4E-BP1 in IFNλ-sensitive cells. IFNλ-inducible phosphorylation/activation of RSK1 results in its dissociation from 4E-BP1 at the same time that 4E-BP1 dissociates from eIF4E to allow formation of eIF4F and initiation of cap-dependent translation. Our studies demonstrate that such IFNλ-dependent engagement of RSK1 is essential for up-regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 expression, suggesting a mechanism for generation of growth-inhibitory responses.

Such functional properties of IFNλ have generated substantial interest and raised prospects for utilization of IFNλ in the treatment of human diseases, including viral infections and malignancies. However, despite the advances in the field and the emerging understanding of the mechanisms of Type III IFN-induced transcriptional activation, very little is known about the signals by which the Type III IFN receptor ultimately controls mRNA translation of target genes to induce IFNλ-dependent biological responses. Over the last 2 decades, our overall understanding of the mechanisms of control of mRNA translation in eukaryotes has evolved, and several important steps have been defined. Control of mRNA translation occurs primarily at the initiation step, in which the small (40 S) ribosomal subunit and the eIF2·tRNAMet·GTP ternary complex form the 43 S complex in association with eIF3. The 43 S complex associates with eIF4F (eukaryotic initiation factor 4F), resulting in formation of the 48 S complex that is recruited to the 5′-end of mRNA and scans the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) for AUG (19Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar). The recruitment of 40 S to mRNA requires the assembly of the eIF4F complex and its binding to the mRNA 5′ cap structure (7-methylguanosine cap structure; m7GpppN). The eIF4F complex is composed of eIF4E, the cap-binding subunit; eIF4G, the scaffolding protein that binds other initiation factors; and eIF4A (an RNA helicase whose function is essential for unwinding of the mRNA 5′ secondary structure) (19Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar, 20Hay N. Sonenberg N.

Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 5992-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recruitment of eIF4F to the 5′ cap structure is a key step at which mRNA translation in different systems is regulated, via competition between the translational repressor 4E-BP1 and eIF4G for binding to eIF4E (23Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.C. Donzé O. Lin T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Various growth factors, hormones, and mitogens control translation at that level by inducing activation of the mTOR kinase and mTOR-mediated 4E-BP1-phosphorylation, resulting in deactivation of 4E-BP1 and its dissociation from eIF4E (19Gingras A.C.

Other work has established that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is activated in response to Type I, II, and III IFNs (7Zhou Z. Hamming O.J. Ank N. Paludan S.R. Nielsen A.L. Hartmann R. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 7749-7758Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 30David M. Petricoin 3rd, E. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is evidence that RSK mediates Type I IFN-dependent eIF4B phosphorylation in certain cell types (28Kroczynska B. Kaur S. Katsoulidis E. Majchrzak-Kita B. Sassano A. Kozma S.C. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 29: 2865-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but the precise involvement and role of RSK in IFN-dependent translational regulation as well as global mRNA translation in eukaryotes remains to be fully elucidated. In the present work, we provide evidence for IFNλ-dependent activation of the mTOR and ERK/RSK pathways and demonstrate that both pathways play important roles in IFNλ signaling. Remarkably, our data establish for the first time that the inactive form of RSK1 is constitutively bound to 4E-BP1 and participates in a complex that prevents recruitment of components of eIF4F to the 5′ cap structure. IFNλ treatment results in RSK1 phosphorylation/activation and dissociation from 4E-BP1, and this event is followed by RSK1-mediated eIF4B activation. Interestingly, IFNλ-dependent phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 is only partially blocked by either MEK or mTOR inhibition in IFNλ-sensitive cells, indicating that input from both MEK/ERK and mTOR is necessary for phosphorylation/deactivation of the protein during its engagement by the IFNλ receptor. Our studies also demonstrate that inhibition of RSK1 activity mediates IFNλ-inducible antiproliferative responses, establishing key and essential roles for RSK1 in IFNλ signaling.

HT-29 cells were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium and then pretreated for 1 h with U0126 (10 μm) or rapamycin (20 nm) and then treated with IFNλ (10 ng/ml) for the indicated times. Cell lysates were incubated with 7-methyl-GTP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 4 h and then washed with lysis buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, transferred on Immobilon membranes (Millipore), and probed with the indicated antibodies. Different GST-proteins (GST-RSK1 protein, activated GST-RSK1 protein, or control GST) were annealed with 0.4 μg of His-4E-BP1 in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris, 100 mm sodium chloride, pH 8.0, for 1 h in 4 °C before they were applied to the 100 μl of His60 Ni superflow resin (Clontech), as described previously (37Krajcíková D. Lukácová M. Müllerová D. Cutting S.M. Barák I. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 3212-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After extensive washing, the proteins were eluted using 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm sodium chloride, 300 mm imidazole, pH 7.4. Ten 100-μl fractions were collected from each sample, and equal amounts were used for SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. GST, GST-RSK1 fusion proteins, and 4E-BP1 were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-GST or anti-4E-BP1 antibodies. These assays were performed according to previously described methodologies (38Ito A. Kataoka T.R. Watanabe M. Nishiyama K. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. Kitamura Y. Nojima H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 562-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). 2 μg of active GST-RSK1 was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 50 μl of PP2A buffer (50 mm Tris, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm MnCl2, pH 8.0) and 0.1 unit of PP2A. Immune complex kinase assays to detect RSK1 kinase activity in anti-RSK1 immunoprecipitates were performed essentially as described previously (39Itoh S. Ding B. Bains C.P. Wang N. Takeishi Y.

GST-4E-BP1 or His-4E-BP1 was used as exogenous substrate. Studies to detect in vitro phosphorylation of GST-RSK1 by activated ERK1 or activated PDK1 were performed essentially as described previously (40Sapkota G.P. Cummings L. Newell F.S. Armstrong C.

Cells were treated with 10 ng/ml IFNλ for 6 h, and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Real-time RT-PCR was performed as in our previous studies (25Kaur S. Lal L. Sassano A. Majchrzak-Kita B. Srikanth M. Baker D.P. Petroulakis E. Hay N. Sonenberg N. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In initial studies, we examined whether IFNλ treatment of sensitive cell lines induces activation of the MEK/ERK pathway and whether RSK1 is activated by the Type III IFN receptor downstream of ERK. HT-29 cells were incubated for different times in the presence or absence of IFNλ, and cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against the phosphorylated forms of RSK1 and ERK1/2. Treatment with IFNλ resulted in phosphorylation of RSK1 on Thr359/Ser363 (Fig. 1A) and ERK1/2 on Thr202/Tyr204 (Fig. 1B), consistent with engagement and activation of these kinases. Such phosphorylation was blocked by pretreatment of cells with the MEK inhibitor U0126, whereas the specific mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, had no inhibitory effects (Fig. 1, A and B). IFNλ treatment also resulted in phosphorylation of eIF4B (Fig. 1C), a protein that plays an important role in the regulation of mRNA translation in eukaryotes and whose phosphorylation has been previously shown to be mediated by either RSK1 or the mTOR-regulated S6K in other systems (20Hay N. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar, 28Kroczynska B. Kaur S. Katsoulidis E. Majchrzak-Kita B. Sassano A. Kozma S.C. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 29: 2865-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). eIF4B phosphorylation was blocked by the MEK/ERK inhibitor U0126, but not rapamycin, indicating that IFNλ-dependent engagement of eIF4B on Ser422 in HT-29 cells is a MEK/ERK-dependent signaling event. In further studies, we determined whether engagement of the IFNλ receptor results in activation of the mTOR pathway and generation of downstream signals that mediate initiation of mRNA translation. IFNλ treatment of sensitive cells resulted in phosphorylation of mTOR on Ser2448 (Fig. 1D), a site whose phosphorylation correlates with activation of mTORC1 complexes (41Copp J. Manning G. Hunter T. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 1821-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In addition, such treatment resulted in phosphorylation/activation of downstream effector of mTOR, S6K (Fig. 1E). Activation of S6K was blocked by rapamycin, consistent with mTOR-mediated engagement of the pathway. Treatment of cells with IFNλ also resulted in phosphorylation of the translational repressor 4E-BP1 on Thr37/46 (Fig. 1F), a site whose phosphorylation is required for deactivation of this translational repressor and its dissociation from the initiation factor eIF4E (19Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar, 20Hay N. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar, 24Gingras A.C. Raught B. Gygi S.P. Niedzwiecka A. Miron M. Burley S.K. Polakiewicz R.D. Wyslouch-Cieszynska A. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2852-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). Such phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was only partially blocked by rapamycin, whereas it was also partially inhibited by U0126 (Fig. 1F). This raised the possibility that coordinated engagement of mTOR and ERK/RSK is required for deactivation of 4E-BP1 during IFNλ treatment of cells. Similar results were obtained when studies were performed using the IFNλ-sensitive ARPE-19 cell line. IFNλ also induced phosphorylation of RSK1 (Fig. 2A), eIF4B (Fig. 2A), 4E-BP1 (Fig. 2B), and S6K (Fig. 2C). As for HT-29 cells, phosphorylation of RSK1 and eIF4B was U0126-sensitive and rapamycin-insensitive, whereas engagement of the S6K was blocked by rapamycin (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 on Thr37/46 was partially blocked by either rapamycin or U0126 (Fig. 2B), suggesting dual IFNλ-dependent regulation of the protein by the mTOR and ERK/RSK pathways. Because the recruitment of eIF4F to the 5′ cap structure of mRNA is an important step in the regulation of mRNA translation, we sought to determine the regulatory effects of IFNλ-dependent activated MEK/ERK or mTOR pathways on the binding of translation initiation factors to the 7-methylguanosine cap complex. IFNλ treatment resulted in dissociation of 4E-BP1 and enhanced binding of eIF4E, eIF4G, and eIF4A to the 7-methylguanosine cap complex (Fig. 3A). Such dissociation of 4E-BP1 upon IFNλ-treatment and binding of the different eukaryotic initiation factors was also seen in rapamycin-pretreated cell lysates (Fig. 3A), consistent with the partial resistance of IFNλ-inducible 4E-BP1 phosphorylation to rapamycin seen in these cells (Fig. 1F). Surprisingly, in cells pretreated with U0126, 4E-BP1 did not dissociate from the complex upon IFNλ treatment, raising the possibility that another protein whose activity is inhibited by U0126 is involved in the process (Fig. 3A). Because RSK1 is a known target and effector of the MEK/ERK pathway, we determined whether non-phosphorylated RSK1 binds to the 7-methylguanosine cap complex. As shown in Fig. 3B, RSK1 was present in the complex and, upon IFNλ treatment, dissociated from it (Fig. 3B). However, RSK1 remained in the complex when cells were treated with IFNλ in the presence of U0126 (Fig. 3B). Because U0126, but not rapamycin, inhibits RSK1 phosphorylation in these cells (Fig. 1A), these data suggested that phosphorylation of the protein is an event that ultimately results in its dissociation from the complex. Consistent with this, RSK1 dissociated from the complex in an IFNλ-dependent manner in the presence of rapamycin (Fig. 3B). Notably, RSK1 followed a similar pattern as 4E-BP1, being detectable in the 7-methylguanosine cap complex at base line and dissociating after IFNλ treatment (Fig. 3A). Such dissociation was reversed by U0126 but not rapamycin (Fig. 3B), suggesting that RSK1 and 4E-BP1 associate with each other in a complex that binds to m7GpppN. IFNλ treatment of HT29 cells also resulted in enhanced binding of eIF4G, eIF4A, and eIF4E to the 7-methylguanosine cap complex, and this correlated with 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and dissociation from the complex (Fig. 3C). However, in cells pretreated with SL0101-1, an inhibitor of the RSK N-terminal kinase domain (NTKD) (40Sapkota G.P. Cummings L. Newell F.S. Armstrong C. Bain J. Frodin M. Grauert M. Hoffmann M.

To directly determine whether 4E-BP1·RSK1 complexes are formed and to determine the effects of IFNλ on the formation and binding capacities of such complexes, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out. HT-29 cells were treated with IFNλ in the presence or absence of U0126 or rapamycin, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-4E-BP1 antibody, followed by immunoblotting with an antibody against RSK1. RSK1 protein was co-immunoprecipi"
