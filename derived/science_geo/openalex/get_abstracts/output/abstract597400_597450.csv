When the gravitational wave event GW170817 was detected, astronomers rushed to search for the source using conventional telescopes (see the Introduction by Smith). Coulter et al. describe how the One-Meter Two-Hemispheres (1M2H) collaboration was the first to locate the electromagnetic source. Drout et al. present the 1M2H measurements of its optical and infrared brightness, and Shappee et al. report their spectroscopy of the event, which is unlike previously detected astronomical transient sources. Kilpatrick et al. show how these observations can be explained by an explosion known as a kilonova, which produces large quantities of heavy elements in nuclear reactions.

https://openalex.org/W3101477063,"Merging neutron stars offer an exquisite laboratory for simultaneously studying strong-field gravity and matter in extreme environments. We establish the physical association of an electromagnetic counterpart EM170817 to gravitational waves (GW170817) detected from merging neutron stars. By synthesizing a panchromatic dataset, we demonstrate that merging neutron stars are a long-sought production site forging heavy elements by r-process nucleosynthesis. The weak gamma-rays seen in EM170817 are dissimilar to classical short gamma-ray bursts with ultra-relativistic jets. Instead, we suggest that breakout of a wide-angle, mildly-relativistic cocoon engulfing the jet elegantly explains the low-luminosity gamma-rays, the high-luminosity ultraviolet-optical-infrared and the delayed radio/X-ray emission. We posit that all merging neutron stars may lead to a wide-angle cocoon breakout; sometimes accompanied by a successful jet and sometimes a choked jet."
https://openalex.org/W2765302758,"On 2017 August 17, gravitational waves were detected from a binary neutron star merger, GW170817, along with a coincident short gamma-ray burst, GRB170817A. An optical transient source, Swope Supernova Survey 17a (SSS17a), was subsequently identified as the counterpart of this event. We present ultraviolet, optical and infrared light curves of SSS17a extending from 10.9 hours to 18 days post-merger. We constrain the radioactively-powered transient resulting from the ejection of neutron-rich material. The fast rise of the light curves, subsequent decay, and rapid color evolution are consistent with multiple ejecta components of differing lanthanide abundance. The late-time light curve indicates that SSS17a produced at least ~0.05 solar masses of heavy elements, demonstrating that neutron star mergers play a role in r-process nucleosynthesis in the Universe."

https://openalex.org/W2766378524,"On 2017 August 17, Swope Supernova Survey 2017a (SSS17a) was discovered as the optical counterpart of the binary neutron star gravitational wave event GW170817. We report time-series spectroscopy of SSS17a from 11.75 hours until 8.5 days after merger. Over the first hour of observations the ejecta rapidly expanded and cooled. Applying blackbody fits to the spectra, we measure the photosphere cooling from $11,000^{+3400}_{-900}$ K to $9300^{+300}_{-300}$ K, and determine a photospheric velocity of roughly 30% of the speed of light. The spectra of SSS17a begin displaying broad features after 1.46 days, and evolve qualitatively over each subsequent day, with distinct blue (early-time) and red (late-time) components. The late-time component is consistent with theoretical models of r-process-enriched neutron star ejecta, whereas the blue component requires high velocity, lanthanide-free material."
https://openalex.org/W2765909478,"11 hours after the detection of gravitational wave source GW170817 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory and Virgo Interferometers, an associated optical transient SSS17a was discovered in the galaxy NGC 4993. While the gravitational wave data indicate GW170817 is consistent with the merger of two compact objects, the electromagnetic observations provide independent constraints of the nature of that system. Here we synthesize all optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of SSS17a collected by the One-Meter Two-Hemisphere collaboration. We find that SSS17a is unlike other known transients. The source is best described by theoretical models of a kilonova consisting of radioactive elements produced by rapid neutron capture (the r-process). We find that SSS17a was the result of a binary neutron star merger, reinforcing the gravitational wave result."

https://openalex.org/W2765808908,"Emerging evidence supports a key role for the gut microbiota in metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor vildagliptin is highly efficacious in treating T2D. However, whether vildagliptin can alter the gut microbiome is still unclear. This study aimed to identify whether vildagliptin modifies the gut microbiota structure during T2D treatment. Diabetic Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were induced by a high-fat diet and streptozotocin injection (HFD/STZ). Diabetic rats were orally administered a low dose of vildagliptin (LV, 0.01 g/kg/d vildagliptin), high dose of vildagliptin (HV, 0.02 g/kg/d vildagliptin), or normal saline for 12 weeks. Fasting blood glucose, blood glucose after glucose loading, and serum insulin levels were significantly reduced in the LV and HV groups compared with those in the T2D group. The serum GLP-1 level increased more in the vildagliptin-treated group than in the T2D group. Pyrosequencing of the V3-V4 regions of 16S rRNA genes revealed that vildagliptin significantly altered the gut microbiota. The operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and community richness (Chao1) index were significantly reduced in the vildagliptin and diabetic groups compared with those in the control group. At the phylum level, a higher relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, lower abundance of Firmicutes, and reduced ratio of Fimicutes/Bacteroidetes were observed in the vildagliptin-treated group. Moreover, vildagliptin treatment increased butyrate-producing bacteria, including Baceroides and Erysipelotrichaeae, in the diabetic rats. Moreover, Lachnospira abundance was significantly negatively correlated with fasting blood glucose levels. In conclusion, vildagliptin treatment could benefit the communities of the gut microbiota."

Oncogenic signaling also prevents oxidative stress and cell death caused by increased production of reactive oxygen species. However, elevated glucose metabolism in cancer cells, especially in glioblastoma, results in the cells becoming sensitive to glucose deprivation (i.e. in high glucose dependence), which rapidly induces cell death. However, the precise mechanism of this type of cell death remains unknown. Here, we report that glucose deprivation alone does not trigger glioblastoma cell death. We found that, for cell death to occur in glucose-deprived glioblastoma cells, cystine and glutamine also need to be present in culture media. We observed that cystine uptake through the cystine/glutamate antiporter xCT under glucose deprivation rapidly induces NADPH depletion, reactive oxygen species accumulation, and cell death. We conclude that although cystine uptake is crucial for production of antioxidant glutathione in cancer cells its transport through xCT also induces oxidative stress and cell death in glucose-deprived glioblastoma cells.

Cancer cells increase glucose uptake and metabolism to support survival and sustained proliferation. Thus, transporters or enzymes involved in altered glucose metabolism have been considered as potential therapeutic targets for many cancers (1Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A.

One consequence of elevated glucose metabolism in cancer cells, especially in glioblastoma cells, is that they become sensitive to glucose deprivation (glucose addiction).

ROS are produced in all cells as a by-product of normal cellular metabolism, and at low levels, ROS increase cell proliferation and survival. However, when ROS levels become excessively high, they cause oxidative stress, leading to cell death (9Cairns R.A. Harris I.S. Mak T.W. Regulation of cancer cell metabolism.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar, 10Sabharwal S.S. Schumacker P.T. Mitochondrial ROS in cancer: initiators, amplifiers or an Achilles' heel?.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2014; 14: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). In cancer cells, ROS are produced at high levels and contribute to accelerating the accumulation of additional mutations and amplifying the tumorigenic phenotype. Therefore, cancer cells up-regulate antioxidant systems and reduce ROS to moderate levels to avoid harmful oxidative stress and cell death (9Cairns R.A. Harris I.S. Mak T.W. Regulation of cancer cell metabolism.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar, 10Sabharwal S.S. Schumacker P.T.

Thus, elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying how ROS levels are tightly regulated in cancer cells provides opportunities for novel therapies against cancer. Cancer cells also exhibit altered amino acid uptake and utilization, and therefore they often express high levels of cell surface amino acid transporters. Among them, xCT (SLC7A11), the light chain of the cystine/glutamate antiporter system xc−, is up-regulated in brains of patients with glioblastoma and in glioblastoma cell lines, and its expression correlates with tumor invasion and poor survival (11Kim J.Y.

The system xc− is composed of xCT and the heavy chain subunit 4F2 (4F2hc, SLC3A2) that exchanges extracellular cystine for intracellular glutamate at the plasma membrane. The substrate specificity and activity of system xc− depend on xCT, and increased expression of xCT leads to enhanced activity of cystine/glutamate exchange. In contrast, 4F2hc is known to form heterodimers with several light chains of specific amino acid transporters including xCT, leading to the surface expression of amino acid transporters (18Verrey F.

Within the cells, the imported cystine is reduced to cysteine, which is the rate-limiting amino acid for reduced glutathione synthesis. Glutathione is one of the most important antioxidants in many types of cancer including glioblastoma. Conversely, treatment with pharmacological inhibitors of xCT or depletion of glutathione in several types of cancer cells triggers iron-dependent nonapoptotic cell death termed ferroptosis (21Dixon S.J.

Thus, intracellular transport of cystine is important to reduce elevated ROS levels and to avoid oxidative stress-induced cell death in cancer cells. However, xCT has recently been reported to have an opposite effect on cell viability during glucose deprivation (24Shin C.S. Mishra P. Watrous J.D. Carelli V. D'Aurelio M. Jain M. Chan D.C.

In this study, we show that, in glioblastoma cells expressing high levels of xCT, intracellular transport of cystine through xCT rapidly induces NADPH depletion, ROS accumulation, and cell death. As reported previously (5Jelluma N. Yang X. Stokoe D. Evan G.I. Dansen T.B. Haas-Kogan D.A. Glucose withdrawal induces oxidative stress followed by apoptosis in glioblastoma cells but not in normal astrocytes.Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we used U251 glioblastoma cell line to show that glucose deprivation from the medium rapidly induced cell death: cells were detached from the substrate within 24 h. Unexpectedly, when U251 cells were deprived of both glucose and all amino acids in the medium, few cells were detached from the substrate over 24 h (Fig. 1A). To quantify U251 cell death, we measured lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in the culture medium at 24 h after deprivation of glucose or glucose and amino acids. Glucose deprivation significantly increased cell death, whereas deprivation of both glucose and amino acids did not (Fig. 1B). We next used essential amino acid (EAA) solution (containing arginine, cystine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine) and nonessential amino acid (NEAA) solution (containing alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, proline, and serine) to examine whether addition of amino acids restored glucose deprivation-induced cell death. Addition of EAA solution, but not NEAA solution or glutamine (glutamine is not included in NEAA solution used here), in the glucose- and amino acid-free medium restored cell death but not completely, and the combination of glutamine and EAA solution was sufficient to restore glucose deprivation-induced cell death (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that an amino acid(s) in EAAs and glutamine are required for glucose deprivation-induced cell death in U251 cells. Similar results were obtained using a trypan blue exclusion assay (Fig. 1C). To determine which amino acid(s) in EAA solution was responsible for the glucose deprivation-induced rapid cell death, glutamine and each amino acid in the EAA solution were added in the glucose- and amino acid-free medium, and cell death was analyzed by LDH release assay. We found that addition of cystine with glutamine in the glucose- and amino acid-free medium triggered cell death (Fig. 1D). Addition of cystine alone also induced cell death, but the combination of cystine and glutamine was required to induce cell death at levels comparable with those induced by deprivation of glucose alone (Fig. 1E). Addition of glucose in the glucose- and amino acid-free medium completely inhibited cell death induced by cystine and glutamine, suggesting that cystine and glutamine do not affect cell viability in the presence of glucose. We used other glioblastoma cell lines to show that this is not limited to U251 cells. Similar results were obtained in T98G and LN229 cells, but they showed different responses to glutamine. In T98G cells, cell death induced by cystine alone was very weak, and addition of glutamine greatly promoted cystine-induced cell death in the glucose- and amino acid-free medium, although glutamine alone had little effect on cell viability (Fig. 1F). Conversely, the level of glucose deprivation-induced cell death in LN229 cells was low compared with those in U251 and T98G cells, and addition of glutamine had little effect on cystine-induced cell death (Fig. 1G). In contrast, A172 cells did not die without glucose, and neither addition of cystine alone nor addition of a combination of cystine and glutamine under glucose and amino acid deprivation conditions induced cell death in A172 cells within 24 h (Fig. 1H). These results suggest that cystine and glutamine are required for glucose deprivation-induced cell death in glioblastoma cells.

We could not obtain complete xCT knock-out cells: this might be due to the fact that cells derived from xCT knock-out mice fail to proliferate and finally die under normal culture conditions (20Lewerenz J.

However, glucose deprivation-induced cell death was greatly inhibited in cells with reduced expression of xCT using sgRNAs targeting different regions of SLC7A11 gene (sgSLC7A11-1, -2, and -3; Fig. 2C). Like parental cells, control sgRNA-expressing cells died in the glucose-free medium. We also found that A172 cells, which were much less sensitive to glucose depletion, expressed very low levels of xCT compared with other glioblastoma cell lines (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that xCT mediates glucose deprivation-induced cell death in glioblastoma cells. It has been reported that normal astrocytes express less xCT than glioblastoma cells and are not sensitive to glucose deprivation (5Jelluma N. Yang X. Stokoe D. Evan G.I. Dansen T.B. Haas-Kogan D.A.

Consistent with these findings, the expression level of xCT in normal astrocytes prepared from rat cerebral cortex was very low compared with that of U251 cells, and glucose deprivation from the medium or addition of cystine and glutamine in the glucose- and amino acid-free medium had little effect on the viability of normal astrocytes within 24 h (Fig. 2E). Glutamine is transported into cells and metabolized to glutamate, and cystine uptake by xCT is coupled to the export of glutamate. Our results show that glutamine promoted, rather than inhibited, cystine-induced cell death (Fig. 1), suggesting that the uptake of cystine, rather than depletion of intracellular glutamate, contributes to xCT-mediated cell death under glucose deprivation conditions in glioblastoma cells. In addition, glutamine did not promote the cystine-induced cell death when U251 cells were treated with bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES), a glutaminase inhibitor, although BPTES alone had a slight cytotoxic effect (Fig. 2F). This result also supports the idea that the conversion of glutamine to glutamate drives xCT-mediated cystine uptake and cell death. One of the important roles of xCT is to supply cysteine necessary for glutathione synthesis (18Verrey F. Closs E.I. Wagner C.A. Palacin M. Endou H. Kanai Y.

Glutathione is synthesized from three amino acids, cysteine, glutamate, and glycine, but addition of glycine had little effect on cystine- and glutamine-induced cell death (Fig. 2G). We next examined the morphological changes of U251 cells after addition of cystine and glutamine in the glucose- and amino acid-free medium. Addition of cystine and glutamine rapidly triggered the formation of blebbing-like structures on the plasma membrane and shrinking of the cell size (Fig. 3A, arrows indicate typical blebbing-like structures). These morphological changes were not observed in the absence of cystine. The level of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, an apoptosis marker, did not change after glucose deprivation from the medium or addition of cystine and glutamine in the glucose- and amino acid-free medium (Fig. 3B; staurosporine and MG132, both of which induce apoptosis in glioblastoma cells (30Yamasaki F.

In addition, the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk had no effect on glucose deprivation- or cystine-induced cell death (Fig. 3C). In contrast, treatment with a cell-permeable ROS scavenger, MnTMPyP, completely suppressed glucose deprivation- or cystine-induced cell death (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that cystine induces ROS-dependent nonapoptotic cell death during glucose deprivation. Flow cytometric analysis of U251 cells loaded with the cell-permeable fluorescent ROS probe 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate revealed that although glucose deprivation increased intracellular ROS levels combined depletion of glucose and amino acids did not (Fig. 3E). However, addition of cystine and glutamine in the glucose- and amino acid-free medium caused an increase in intracellular ROS levels (Fig. 3F). Addition of glutamine alone had little effect on ROS levels. We next used xCT-deficient cells to investigate whether xCT is involved in the ROS accumulation under glucose deprivation. Although glucose withdrawal increased intracellular ROS levels in control sgRNA-expressing cells, it caused a decrease, rather than an increase, in intracellular ROS levels in xCT-deficient cells (Fig. 3G). Thus, xCT promotes ROS accumulation under glucose deprivation conditions in glioblastoma cells. Because ROS are produced by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in most cancer cells (2Ward P.S.

Reprogramming glucose metabolism in cancer: can it be exploited for cancer therapy?.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), glucose deprivation may decrease mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and therefore reduce intracellular ROS generation, although the exact reason for reduced ROS levels in glucose-deprived xCT-deficient cells is unknown.

Female students' mental health problems and help-seeking behaviors increased from the 2005 to the 2011 cohorts and no changes emerged for male students across cohorts. Overall, male students reported higher levels of mental health problems than did female students in the first college year, whereas female students reported more help-seeking behaviors than did male students in the following four college years. College students' mental health problems was associated positively with help-seeking behaviors. College students were more likely to seek help from the college psychological counselling center when they experienced relatively few or quite a lot of mental health issues (i.e., an inversed U shape). Implications for future studies and practices are discussed."

Exercise caused an increase in endogenous glucose production, glycogenolysis, and gluconeogenesis from phosphoenolpyruvate. Citric acid cycle fluxes, pyruvate cycling, anaplerosis, and cataplerosis were also elevated during this exercise. Sedentary nutrient fluxes in the postabsorptive state were comparable for the WT and KO mice. However, the increment in the endogenous rate of glucose appearance during exercise was blunted in the KO mice because of a diminished glycogenolytic flux. This lower rate of glycogenolysis was associated with lower hepatic glycogen content before the onset of exercise and prompted a reduction in arterial glucose during exercise.

https://openalex.org/W2767039311,"Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of aquatic invasive species environmental DNA (AIS eDNA) was used for rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of Dreissena sp. relevant to the Great Lakes (USA) basin. The method was validated for two uses including i) direct amplification of eDNA using a hand filtration system and ii) confirmation of the results after DNA extraction using a conventional thermal cycler run at isothermal temperatures. Direct amplification eliminated the need for DNA extraction and purification and allowed detection of target invasive species in grab or concentrated surface water samples, containing both free DNA as well as larger cells and particulates, such as veligers, eggs, or seeds. The direct amplification method validation was conducted using Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena bugensis and uses up to 1 L grab water samples for high target abundance (e.g., greater than 10 veligers (larval mussels) per L for Dreissena sp.) or 20 L samples concentrated through 35 μm nylon screens for low target abundance, at less than 10 veligers per liter water. Surface water concentrate samples were collected over a period of three years, mostly from inland lakes in Michigan with the help of a network of volunteers. Field samples collected from 318 surface water locations included i) filtered concentrate for direct amplification validation and ii) 1 L grab water sample for eDNA extraction and confirmation. Though the extraction-based protocol was more sensitive (resulting in more positive detections than direct amplification), direct amplification could be used for rapid screening, allowing for quicker action times. For samples collected between May and August, results of eDNA direct amplification were consistent with known presence/absence of selected invasive species. A cross-platform smartphone application was also developed to disseminate the analyzed results to volunteers. Field tests of the direct amplification protocol using a portable device (Gene-Z) showed the method could be used in the field to obtain results within one hr (from sample to result). Overall, the direct amplification has the potential to simplify the eDNA-based monitoring of multiple aquatic invasive species. Additional studies are warranted to establish quantitative correlation between eDNA copy number, veliger, biomass or organismal abundance in the field."

Furthermore, we determined the correlation between Q α2MG and cerebrospinal (CSF) interleukin (IL)-6 level and quotient complement component 3 (Q C3). To determine intrathecal production of C3, the C3 index (Q C3/Q α2MG) was also calculated. Fifty-six patients with SLE were included in this study. Of these, 48 were diagnosed with NPSLE, consisting of 30 diffuse NPSLE patients (acute confusional state (ACS): n = 14, non-ACS: n = 16) and 18 patients with focal NPSLE. CSF IL-6 concentration, and paired serum and CSF levels of α2MG and C3, were measured by enzyme-linked immuno solvent assay (ELISA). The Q α2MG, Q C3, and C3 index were then calculated. Q α2MG, Q C3, and IL-6 concentrations in the CSF were significantly elevated in NPSLE compared with non-NPSLE. Among the subsets of NPSLE, significant increases in Q α2MG, CSF IL-6, and Q C3 were observed in ACS compared with non-ACS or focal NPSLE. There was a positive correlation between CSF IL-6 level and Q α2MG, as well as between Q C3 and Q α2MG, in diffuse NPSLE. There were no significant differences in C3 index between NPSLE and non-NPSLE, as well as among the subgroups of NPSLE. Our study suggests that BBB disruption is present in ACS, and elevated levels of IL-6 and C3 in CSF in diffuse NPSLE, especially in ACS, might result from their entry to the CSF from the systemic circulation through the damaged BBB, as well as increased intrathecal production. Furthermore, Q α2MG might be useful for the evaluation of BBB integrity."

Objectives To characterise the reaction types and the drugs implicated in admission to Jimma University Specialized Hospital, Southwest Ethiopia, and to identify risk factors associated with ADR-related hospitalisation. Methods A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted from May 2015 to August 2016 among consenting patients aged ≥18 years consecutively admitted to medical wards taking at least one medication prior to admission. ADR-related hospitalisations were determined through expert review of medical records, laboratory tests, patient interviews and physical observation. ADR causality was assessed by the Naranjo algorithm followed by consensus review with internal medicine specialist. ADR preventability was assessed using Schumock and Thornton’s criteria. Only definite and probable ADRs that provoked hospitalisation were considered. Binary logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of ADR-related hospitalisation. Results Of 1,001 patients, 103 (10.3%) had ADR-related admissions. Common ADRs responsible for hospitalisation were hepatotoxicity (35, 29.4%) and acute kidney injury (27, 22.7%). The drug classes most frequently implicated were antitubercular agents (45, 25.0%) followed by antivirals (22, 12.2%) and diuretics (19, 10.6%). Independent predictors of ADR-related hospitalisation were body mass index (BMI) <18.5 kg/m2 (adjusted odd ratio [AOR] = 1.69; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10–2.62; p = 0.047), pre-existing renal disease (AOR = 2.84; 95%CI = 1.38–5.85, p = 0.004), pre-existing liver disease (AOR = 2.61; 95%CI = 1.38–4.96; p = 0.003), number of comorbidities ≥4 (AOR = 2.09; 95%CI = 1.27–3.44; p = 0.004), number of drugs ≥6 (AOR = 2.02; 95%CI = 1.26–3.25; p = 0.004) and history of previous ADRs (AOR = 24.27; 95%CI = 11.29–52.17; p<0.001). Most ADRs (106, 89.1%) were preventable. Conclusions ADRs were a common cause of hospitalisation. The majority of ADRs were preventable, highlighting the need for monitoring and review of patients with lower BMI, ADR history, renal and liver diseases, multiple comorbidities and medications. ADR predictors should be integrated into clinical pathways and pharmacovigilance systems."

Although successful, this approach does not leverage the environmental and genetic factors shared among the multiple phenotypes collected in contemporary cohorts. Here we developed covariates for multiphenotype studies (CMS), an approach that improves power when correlated phenotypes are measured on the same samples.

There is evidence that cyanoHABs occurred repeatedly in the Baltic Sea but knowledge of their spatiotemporal distribution and the cyanobacteria that contributed to them is limited. In this study, we examined representatives of the major bloom-forming heterocystous cyanobacteria (i.e. Aphanizomenon, Dolichospermum (formerly Anabaena) and Nodularia) to establish lipid fingerprints that allow tracking these environmentally important diazotrophs in the modern and past Baltic Sea. The distribution of normal and mid-chain branched alkanes, fatty acid methyl esters, bacteriohopanepolyols and heterocyst glycolipids permitted a clear chemotaxonomic separation of the different heterocystous cyanobacteria but also indicated a close phylogenetic relationship between representatives of the genera Aphanizomenon and Dolichospermum. Compared to the discontinuous nature of phytoplankton surveys studies, the distinct lipid profiles reported here will allow obtaining detailed spatiotemporal information on the frequency and intensity of Baltic Sea cyanoHABs as well as their community composition using the time-integrated biomarker signatures recorded in surface and subsurface sediments. As heterocystous cyanobacteria of the genera Aphanizomenon, Dolichospermum and Nodularia are generally known to form massive blooms in many brackish as well as lacustrine systems worldwide, the chemotaxonomic markers introduced in this study may allow investigating cyanoHABs in a great variety of contemporary environments from polar to tropical latitudes."
https://openalex.org/W2766948832,"Background Many studies have found significant associations between high ambient temperatures and increases in heat-related morbidity and mortality. Several studies have demonstrated that increases in heat-related hospitalizations are elevated among individuals with diagnosed mental illnesses and/or behavioral disorders (MBD). However, there are a limited number of studies regarding risk factors associated with specific mental illnesses that contribute, at least in part, to heat-related illnesses (HRI) in the United States. Objective To identify and characterize individual and environmental risk factors associated with MBD hospitalizations with a concurrent HRI diagnosis. Methods This study uses hospitalization data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2001–2010). Descriptive analyses of primary and secondary diagnoses of MBDs with an HRI were examined. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated from multivariable models to identify risk factors for hospitalizations among patients with mental illnesses and/or behavioral disorders and HRI. Results Nondependent alcohol/drug abuse, dementia, and schizophrenia were among the disorders that were associated with increased frequency of HRI hospitalizations among MBD patients. Increased risk of MBD hospitalizations with HRI was observed for Males (RR, 3.06), African Americans (RR, 1.16), Native Americans (RR, 1.70), uninsured (RR, 1.92), and those 40 years and older, compared to MBD hospitalizations alone. Conclusions Previous studies outside the U.S. have found that dementia and schizophrenia are significant risk factors for HRI hospitalizations. Our results suggest that hospitalizations among substance abusers may also be an important risk factor associated with heat morbidity. Improved understanding of these relative risks could help inform future public health strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2766021298,"The majority of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), an organ-specific autoimmune disease, harbor autoantibodies that attack the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR-Abs) at the neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscles, resulting in muscle weakness. Single cell manipulation technologies coupled with genetic engineering are very powerful tools to examine T cell and B cell repertoires and the dynamics of adaptive immunity. These tools have been utilized to develop mAbs in parallel with hybridomas, phage display technologies and B-cell immortalization. By applying a single cell technology and novel high-throughput cell-based binding assays, we identified peripheral B cells that produce pathogenic nAChR-Abs in patients with MG. Although anti-nAChR antibodies produced by individual peripheral B cells generally exhibited low binding affinity for the α-subunit of the nAChR and great sequence diversity, a small fraction of these antibodies bound with high affinity to native-structured nAChRs on cell surfaces. B12L, one such Ab isolated here, competed with a rat Ab (mAb35) for binding to the human nAChR and thus considered to recognize the main immunogenic region (MIR). By evaluating the Ab in in vitro cell-based assays and an in vivo rat passive transfer model, B12L was found to act as a pathogenic Ab in rodents and presumably in humans.These findings suggest that B cells in peripheral blood may impact MG pathogenicity. Our methodology can be applied not only to validate pathogenic Abs as molecular target of MG treatment, but also to discover and analyze Ab production systems in other human diseases."

Thirty preterm babies (M = 15 and F = 15; ≤ 36 week gestation age) were studied from within 72 hours of delivery. These babies were admitted to the newborn intensive care and were further categorized into groups based on whether their mothers with or without diabetic mellitus. Blood sugar levels were monitored by both RTGMS and the traditional intermittent arterial line (A-Line) glucose method. Continuous glucose monitoring were well tolerated in 30 infants. There were good consistency between RTGMS and A-Line glucose concentration measurements. Of the preterm infants, 33.33% experienced abnormal glucose levels (hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia) between the checkpoint intervals of the intermittent A-Line blood sugar measurements. RTGM showed advantages with regards to reduced pain, greater comfort, the provision of real-time information, high sensitivity (94.59%) and specificity (97.87%) in discovering abnormalities of blood sugar, which are especially valuable for premature infants of diabetic mothers. RTGMS is comparable to A-line measurement for identifying fluctuations in blood glucose in premature infants. RTGMS detects more episodes of abnormal glucose concentration than intermittent A-line blood glucose measurement. High risk infants, especially premature infants with diabetic mothers, should receive more intensive blood sugar level checks by using continuous RTGMS."

Sample size was calculated using simple random sampling with a confidence level of 95%, confidence interval of 0.05 and a proportion of 87%. A total of 103 participants responded to the questionnaire (calculated sample size was 96). Independent variables were defined and described, and the bivariate relationship to dependent variables was determined using Odds Ratio. Multivariate analysis was carried out using logistic regression. The mean adherence of study population was 78% (SD 0.08, max = 96%, min = 55%). The mean adherence in transplant patients was 82% (SD 7.8, max 96%, min 63%), and the mean adherence in dialysis patients was 76% (SD 7.8 max 90%, min 55%). Adherence was positively associated to the mother's educational level and to higher monthly household income. Together predisposing, enabling and need factors illustrate the complexities surrounding adherence in this pediatric CKD population.

This is contrary to the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), which had reduced variability and therefore may be misleading as an analog for 21st century warming, notwithstanding its warm (and arid) conditions. Given past non-stationarity, and particularly erratic LIA, a ‘warm LIA’ climate scenario for the coming century that combines high precipitation variability (similar to LIA conditions) with warm and dry conditions (similar to MCA conditions) represents a plausible situation that is supported by recent climate simulations. Our comparison of tree ring-based drought analysis and records from the tropical Pacific Ocean suggests that changing variability in El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) explains much of the contrasting variances between the MCA and LIA conditions across the American Southwest. Greater ENSO variability for the 21st century could be induced by a decrease in meridional sea surface temperature gradient caused by increased greenhouse gas concentration, as shown by several recent climate modeling experiments. Overall, these results coupled with the paleo-record suggests that using the erratic LIA conditions as benchmarks for past hydroclimatic variability can be useful for developing future water-resource management and drought and flood hazard mitigation strategies in the Southwest."
https://openalex.org/W2767154331,"Screening of variants, related to lipid metabolism in patients with extreme cholesterol levels, is a tool used to identify targets affecting cardiovascular outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and characteristics of rare and common variants of APOB and PCSK9 in Korean patients with extremely low low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels.Among 13,545 participants enrolled in a cardiovascular genome cohort, 22 subjects, whose LDL-C levels without lipid-lowering agents were ≤1 percentile (48 mg/dL) of Korean population, were analyzed. Two target genes, APOB and PCSK9, were sequenced by targeted next-generation sequencing. Prediction of functional effects was conducted using SIFT, PolyPhen-2, and Mutation Taster, and matched against a public database of variants.Eight rare variants of the two candidate genes (five in APOB and three in PCSK9) were found in nine subjects. Two subjects had more than two different rare variants of either gene (one subject in APOB and another subject in APOB/PCSK9). Conversely, 12 common variants (nine in APOB and three in PCSK9) were discovered in 21 subjects. Among all variants, six in APOB and three in PCSK9 were novel. Several variants previously reported functional, including c.C277T (p.R93C) and c.G2009A (p.G670E) of PCSK9, were found in our population.Rare variants of APOB or PCSK9 were identified in nine of the 22 study patients with extremely low LDL-C levels, whereas most of them had common variants of the two genes. The common novelty of variants suggested polymorphism of the two genes among them. Our results provide rare genetic information associated with this lipid phenotype in East Asian people."
https://openalex.org/W2765365580,"Background Diet has been associated with better mental health in general populations, but less is known on this association in patients with a history of coronary heart disease. The objective of this study is to examine the cross-sectional associations between dietary patterns and mental health in elderly patients with a history of myocardial infarction. Methods Data were drawn from the final assessment of the Alpha Omega cohort that monitored patients with a history of myocardial infarction (age range 60–80 years). 2171 patients with complete data for diet and mental health were included in this study. Diet was assessed with the 203-item Food Frequency Questionnaire, and subsequently categorized into two scores: the Dutch Healthy Nutrient and Food Score (DHNaFS) and the Dutch Undesirable Nutrient and Food Score (DUNaFS). Depressive symptoms, assessed with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), and dispositional optimism, assessed with the 4-item questionnaire (4Q), were cross-sectionally analyzed in relation to dietary patterns using linear regression analysis. Results Patients were on average 72.2 years old and 79.5% were male. The DHNaFS score was associated with less depressive symptoms and higher dispositional optimism (β = -0.108; P<0.001; and β = 0.074; P<0.001), whereas no associations were found with the DUNaFS score. Particularly, consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, and low fat-dairy were associated with less depressive symptoms and higher optimism. Similar associations were found when analyzing the association between average DHNaFS score over the preceding 41 months with depression β = -0.085; P<0.001) and higher dispositional optimism (β = 0.084; P<0.001). Conclusions A healthy dietary pattern, in particular a higher consumption of vegetables, fruit, whole grains, fish and low-fat dairy, was associated with less depressive symptoms and higher optimism. However, given the cross-sectional nature of our analyses, our findings may also be explained by more optimistic participants making healthier food choices. Therefore, future prospective or interventions studies are needed to establish the direction of causality of this association. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03192410."
https://openalex.org/W2765768040,"Tropical forest fragmentation creates insular biological communities that undergo species loss and changes in community composition over time, due to area- and edge-effects. Woody lianas thrive in degraded and secondary forests, due to their competitive advantage over trees in these habitats. Lianas compete both directly and indirectly with trees, increasing tree mortality and turnover. Despite our growing understanding of liana-tree dynamics, we lack detailed knowledge of the assemblage-level responses of lianas themselves to fragmentation, particularly in evergreen tropical forests. We examine the responses of both sapling and mature liana communities to landscape-scale forest insularization induced by a mega hydroelectric dam in the Brazilian Amazon. Detailed field inventories were conducted on islands created during reservoir filling, and in nearby mainland continuous forest. We assess the relative importance of variables associated with habitat fragmentation such as area, isolation, surrounding forest cover, fire and wind disturbance, on liana community attributes including abundance, basal area, diversity, and composition. We also explore patterns of liana dominance relative to tree saplings and adults ≥10 cm diameter at breast height. We find that 1) liana community composition remains remarkably similar across mainland continuous forest and islands, regardless of extreme area- and edge- effects and the loss of vertebrate dispersers in the latter; and 2) lianas are increasing in dominance relative to trees in the sapling layer in the most degraded islands, with both the amount of forest cover surrounding islands and fire disturbance history predicting liana dominance. Our data suggest that liana communities persist intact in isolated forests, regardless of extreme area- and edge-effects; while in contrast, tree communities simultaneously show evidence of increased turnover and supressed recruitment. These processes may lead to lianas becoming a dominant component of this dam-induced fragmented landscape in the future, due to their competitive advantage over trees in degraded forest habitats. Additional loss of tree biomass and diversity brought about through competition with lianas, and the concurrent loss of carbon storage, should be accounted for in impact assessments of future dam development."
https://openalex.org/W2765607623,"Tumour budding and podia formation are well-appreciated in surgical pathology as an aggressive invasion phenotype of colorectal carcinoma cells that is attained in the microenvironment of the invasive margin. In this study, we addressed how tumour budding and podia formation feature in xenografts. Primary colorectal carcinomas (N = 44) of various molecular types (sporadic standard type, high-degree microsatellite-unstable, CpG island methylator phenotype) were transplanted subcutaneously into T and B cell-deficient NSG mice, making possible immunohistochemistry with routine surgical pathology antibodies. Tumor budding and podia formation were both appreciably present in the xenografts. Quantitative evaluations of cytokeratin immunostains of primaries and their corresponding xenografts showed a reduction of tumour buds in the xenografts. Furthermore, in xenografts tumour cells were completely negative by pSTAT3 immunohistochemistry, indicating absence of cytokine/chemokine signalling, but nuclear β-catenin and SMAD4 immunostainings as read-out of wnt and BMP pathway activation, respectively, were maintained. Carcinoma cells in most xenografts retained immunostaining of at least some nuclei by immunohistochemistry with antibodies against pERK1/2. K-ras/B-raf mutational status did not correlate with tumour budding or podia formation in the xenografts. Our results indicate that tumour budding and podia formation can be modelled by xenografting, and in NSG mice it can be studied with the same immunohistochemical methods as used for primaries in surgical pathology. Dysregulation of wnt and BMP signalling appears to be transferred into the xenograft microenvironment, but not cytokine/chemokine signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2766771281,"Despite the importance of body awareness for health and well-being there is still a lack of valid assessment tools to scan proper body awareness. To respond to the limitations of questionnaires (reading/interpretation problems) the Awareness-Body-Chart (ABC) was designed to assess body awareness by colouring 51 regions according to their awareness. The objective of this study was to investigate the psychometric characteristics of the ABC.In a questionnaire-study, 106 students in Graz (79 females, 27 males, age median 21 (IQR 20-23) years) filled in the ABC, furthermore a German body awareness questionnaire ""KEKS"", and the Beck Depression Inventory II. Factor structure, internal consistency, and retest reliability of the ABC were investigated. Correlations of the ABC with the KEKS and the Beck Depression Inventory II and comparisons of subgroups were conducted.Through factor analyses, 14 factors with clear assignments to body parts could be categorized: cranium, face, cervical/lumbar region, chest/abdomen, back, shoulder, upper arm, lower arm/elbow, hand, genital area, thigh/hip, knee, lower leg, and foot. The 14 body parts and the total score showed acceptable to high Cronbach's alphas (α = .64 - .97). The test-retest reliability showed values between ρ = .71 and ρ = .96. The correlation of the ABC and KEKS (r = .66, p < .001) confirmed validity. Further indications of validity could be seen in comparisons of subgroups and in correlations with the Beck Depression Inventory II.The ABC proved good psychometric properties with acceptable to high internal consistency, acceptable to high retest reliability and high construct validity. It is an easy-to-use tool for clinical settings and research. The ABC opens new insights into body awareness-patterns of various subgroups."
https://openalex.org/W2767143403,"Introduction Evidence on personality traits change implies it should be studied as an outcome and not only as an explanatory effect. Therefore, we aimed to assess how personality and academic achievement sway each other. Three cohorts of medical students (n = 181) comprised of school leavers and graduates, completed NEO-FFI when admitted (baseline) and later on medical training (follow-up). Previous achievement was measured as mean scores on national school examinations, and academic achievement as medical course average. Causal relations were studied by cross-lagged analysis. Results Cross-sectional analysis at baseline showed differences between graduates and school leavers on personality, with graduates scoring lower on neuroticism (β = -12.344, p<0.001), and higher on openness to experience (β = 5.257, p<0.001), conscientiousness (β = 2.345, p = 0.004,) and agreeableness (β = 6.993, p<0.001). Longitudinal analyses indicated that personality traits and achievement tracked over time. Cross-lagged analysis found a positive significant association between academic achievement and neuroticism at baseline (β = 0.031, p = 0.014) and with being a graduate student (β = 0.766, p = 0.006). After adjusting, no association was found between previous achievement and personality at follow-up. Conclusions Some neuroticism may enhance medical academic achievement. The blurring of the initial differences between graduates and school leavers suggests a reasonable possibility of personality traits change along the medical course. Future research on medical selection processes cannot afford to ignore the influence of the medical school environment on personality traits change."
https://openalex.org/W2765467433,"The Rnd family of proteins, Rnd1, Rnd2 and Rnd3, are atypical Rho family GTPases, which bind to but do not hydrolyse GTP. They interact with plexins, which are receptors for semaphorins, and are hypothesised to regulate plexin signalling. We recently showed that each Rnd protein has a distinct profile of interaction with three plexins, Plexin-B1, Plexin-B2 and Plexin-B3, in mammalian cells, although it is unclear which region(s) of these plexins contribute to this specificity. Here we characterise the binary interactions of the Rnd proteins with the Rho-binding domain (RBD) of Plexin-B1 and Plexin-B2 using biophysical approaches. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments for each of the Rnd proteins with Plexin-B1-RBD and Plexin-B2-RBD showed similar association constants for all six interactions, although Rnd1 displayed a small preference for Plexin-B1-RBD and Rnd3 for Plexin-B2-RBD. Furthermore, mutagenic analysis of Rnd3 suggested similarities in its interaction with both Plexin-B1-RBD and Plexin-B2-RBD. These results suggest that Rnd proteins do not have a clear-cut specificity for different Plexin-B-RBDs, possibly implying the contribution of additional regions of Plexin-B proteins in conferring functional substrate selection."
https://openalex.org/W2765896823,"Social exclusion has many effects on individuals, including the increased need to belong and elevated sensitivity to social information. Using a self-reporting method, and an eye-tracking technique, this study explored people’s need to belong and attentional bias towards the socio-emotional information (pictures of positive and negative facial expressions compared to those of emotionally-neutral expressions) after experiencing a brief episode of social exclusion. We found that: (1) socially-excluded individuals reported higher negative emotions, lower positive emotions, and stronger need to belong than those who were not socially excluded; (2) compared to a control condition, social exclusion caused a longer response time to probe dots after viewing positive or negative face images; (3) social exclusion resulted in a higher frequency ratio of first attentional fixation on both positive and negative emotional facial pictures (but not on the neutral pictures) than the control condition; (4) in the social exclusion condition, participants showed shorter first fixation latency and longer first fixation duration to positive pictures than neutral ones but this effect was not observed for negative pictures; (5) participants who experienced social exclusion also showed longer gazing duration on the positive pictures than those who did not; although group differences also existed for the negative pictures, the gaze duration bias from both groups showed no difference from chance. This study demonstrated the emotional response to social exclusion as well as characterising multiple eye-movement indicators of attentional bias after experiencing social exclusion."
https://openalex.org/W2766902106,"Three independent but complementary lines of research have provided evidence for the recognition of refugia: paleontology, phylogeography and species distributional modelling (SDM). SDM assesses the ecological requirements of a species based on its known occurrences and enables its distribution to be projected on past climatological reconstructions. One advantage over the other two approaches is that it provides an explicit link to environment and geography, thereby enabling the analysis of a large number of taxa in the search for more general refugia patterns. We propose a methodology for using SDM to recognize biogeographical patterns of endemic insects from Southern South America. We built species distributional models for 59 insect species using Maxent. The species analyzed in the study have narrow niche breadth and were classified into four assemblages according to the ecoregion they inhabit. Models were built for the Late Pleistocene, Mid-Holocene and Present. Through the procedure developed for this study we used the models to recognize: Late Pleistocene refugia; areas with high species richness during all three periods; climatically constant areas (in situ refugia); consistent patterns among in situ refugia, Pleistocene refugia and current distribution of endemic species. We recognized two adjacent Pleistocene refugia with distinct climates; four in situ refugia, some of which are undergoing a process of fragmentation and retraction or enlargement. Interestingly, we found a congruent pattern among in situ refugia, Pleistocene refugia and endemic species. Our results seem to be consistent with the idea that long-term climate stability is known to have a key role in promoting persistence of biodiversity in an area. Our Pleistocene and in situ refugia are consistent with refugia identified in studies focusing on different taxa and applying other methodologies, showing that the method developed can be used to identify such areas and prove their importance for conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2766028082,"Prions are infectious proteins that cause fatal neurodegenerative disorders including Creutzfeldt–Jakob and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow) diseases. The yeast [PSI+] prion is formed by the translation-termination factor Sup35, is the best-studied prion, and provides a useful model system for studying such diseases. However, despite recent progress in the understanding of prion diseases, the cellular defense mechanism against prions has not been elucidated. Here, we report that proteolytic cleavage of Sup35 suppresses spontaneous de novo generation of the [PSI+] prion. We found that during yeast growth in glucose media, a maximum of 40% of Sup35 is cleaved at its N-terminal prion domain. This cleavage requires the vacuolar proteases PrA–PrB. Cleavage occurs in a manner dependent on translation but independently of autophagy between the glutamine/asparagine-rich (Q/N-rich) stretch critical for prion formation and the oligopeptide-repeat region required for prion maintenance, resulting in the removal of the Q/N-rich stretch from the Sup35 N terminus. The complete inhibition of Sup35 cleavage, by knocking out either PrA (pep4Δ) or PrB (prb1Δ), increased the rate of de novo formation of [PSI+] prion up to ∼5-fold, whereas the activation of Sup35 cleavage, by overproducing PrB, inhibited [PSI+] formation. On the other hand, activation of the PrB pathway neither cleaved the amyloid conformers of Sup35 in [PSI+] strains nor eliminated preexisting [PSI+]. These findings point to a mechanism antagonizing prion generation in yeast. Our results underscore the usefulness of the yeast [PSI+] prion as a model system to investigate defense mechanisms against prion diseases and other amyloidoses."
https://openalex.org/W2766317433,"Background Prenatal exposure to lead (Pb) has been shown to have negative and irreversible health impacts on foetal and early childhood development, affecting morbidity and mortality in adulthood. This study aimed to assess in utero Pb exposure, examine birth outcomes, and identify confounding factors in the large cohort of South African population, following the legislated removal of Pb from petrol. Methods Lead was measured in the maternal blood, urine and cord blood using Inductive Coupled Plasma Mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The statistical analyses included Spearman’s correlation, Wilcoxon rank sum (Mann Whitney), Kruskal-Wallis rank tests and multivariate linear regression. Results Overall, the geometric mean (GM) of Pb in maternal blood (PbB) was 1.32 μg/dL (n = 640; 95% CI, 1.24–1.40). In the subset cohort, the GM of paired maternal PbB and cord blood (PbC) was 1.73 μg/dL (n = 350; 95% CI, 1.60–1.86) and 1.26 μg/dL (n = 317; 95% CI, 1.18–1.35), respectively with a positive correlation between the log PbB and the log PbC (rho = 0.65, p = <0.001). Birth outcomes showed geographical differences in the gestational age (p<0.001), birth length (p = 0.028) and head circumference (p<0.001), Apgar score at 5 min (p<0.001) and parity (p<0.002). In female neonates, a positive association was found between PbC and head circumference (rho = 0.243; p<0.016). The maternal PbB levels were positively correlated with race, educational status, water sources, cooking fuels and use of pesticides at home. Conclusions This study has demonstrated not only the positive impact that the introduction of unleaded petrol and lead-free paint has had on in utero exposure to Pb in South Africa, but has also contributed new data on the topic, in a region where such data and scientific investigations in this field are lacking. Future research should evaluate if similar effects can be detected in young children and the adult population."
https://openalex.org/W2766839238,"Kinesin1 plays a major role in neuronal transport by recruiting many different cargos through its kinesin light chain (KLC). Various structurally unrelated cargos interact with the conserved tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of KLC. The N-terminal capping helix of the TPR domain exhibits an atypical sequence and structural features that may contribute to the versatility of the TPR domain to bind different cargos. We determined crystal structures of the TPR domain of both KLC1 and KLC2 encompassing the N-terminal capping helix and show that this helix exhibits two distinct and defined orientations relative to the rest of the TPR domain. Such a difference in orientation gives rise, at the N-terminal part of the groove, to the formation of one hydrophobic pocket, as well as to electrostatic variations at the groove surface. We present a comprehensive structural analysis of available KLC1/2-TPR domain structures that highlights that ligand binding into the groove can be specific of one or the other N-terminal capping helix orientations. Further, structural analysis reveals that the N-terminal capping helix is always involved in crystal packing contacts, especially in a TPR1:TPR1’ contact which highlights its propensity to be a protein–protein interaction site. Together, these results underline that the structural plasticity of the N-terminal capping helix might represent a structural determinant for TPR domain structural versatility in cargo binding."
https://openalex.org/W2765365785,"In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we quantitatively analyzed the tomographic features in the neural tissues around the optic disc in patients with diabetic retinopathy with and without panretinal photocoagulation. We analyzed 206 eyes, comprising 33 normal eyes in subjects without diabetes (group I), 30 eyes without diabetic retinopathy (group II), 66 eyes with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (group III), 45 eyes with panretinal photocoagulation (group IV), and 32 eyes with normal tension glaucoma (group V). Sequential images acquired using swept-source optical coherence tomography in three-dimensional mode were used to measure peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, neuro-retinal rim thickness, anterior lamina cribrosa depth, prelaminar thickness, and thickness of the lamina cribrosa. The peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and lamina cribrosa thickness were significantly thinner in group IV than in group III (p = 0.019 and p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in rim thickness, anterior lamina cribrosa depth, or prelaminar thickness between groups III and IV (p = 0.307, p = 0.877, and p = 0.212). Multivariate analysis revealed that time since panretinal photocoagulation and thickness of the lamina cribrosa had a significant effect on peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (p < 0.001 and p = 0.014). In group IV, there was a negative correlation between time elapsed since panretinal photocoagulation and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, rim thickness, and thickness of the lamina cribrosa (r = -0.765, r = -0.490, and r = -0.419), but no correlation with prelaminar thickness or anterior lamina cribrosa depth (r = 0.104 and r = -0.171). Panretinal photocoagulation may be related to thinning of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer, rim thickness, and lamina cribrosa, but not prelaminar thickness or anterior lamina cribrosa depth. These features are different from the peripapillary features of eyes with typical normal tension glaucoma."
https://openalex.org/W2766493423,"Introduction Most HIV infections in Africa are acquired by married/cohabiting adults and WHO recommends couple’s voluntary HIV counseling and testing (CVCT) for prevention. The handover from NGO-sponsored weekend CVCT to government-sponsored services in routine weekday antenatal care (ANC) and individual voluntary testing and counseling (VCT) services in Zambia’s two largest cities from 2009–2015 is described. Methods Government clinic counselors were trained to provide CVCT, and along with community health workers they promoted CVCT services in their clinic and surrounding areas. When client volume exceeded the capacity of on-duty staff in ANC and VCT, non-governmental organization (NGO) subsidies were offered for overtime pay. Results Implementation of routine CVCT services varied greatly by clinic and city. The 12 highest volume clinics were examined further, while 13 clinics had CVCT numbers that were too low to warrant further investigation. In Lusaka, the proportion of pregnant women whose partners were tested rose from 2.6% in 2009 to a peak of 26.2% in 2012 and 24.8% in 2015. Corresponding reports in Ndola were 2.0% in 2009, 17.0% in 2012 and 14.5% in 2015. Obstacles to CVCT included: limited space and staffing, competing priorities, record keeping not adapted for couples, and few resources for promotion and increasing male involvement. Conflicting training models for ‘partner testing’ with men and women separately vs. CVCT with joint post-test counseling led to confusion in reporting to district health authorities. Discussion A focused and sustained effort will be required to reach a meaningful number of couples with CVCT to prevent heterosexual and perinatal HIV transmission. Establishing targets and timelines, funding for dedicated and appropriately trained staff, adoption of standardized data recording instruments with couple-level indicators, and expansion of community and clinic-based promotions using proven models are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2766909706,"Intestinal helminth antigens are inducers of type 2 responses and can elicit regulatory immune responses, resulting in dampened inflammation. Several platyhelminth proteins with anti-inflammatory activity have been reported. We have identified, cloned and expressed the Taenia solium calreticulin (rTsCRT) and shown that it predominantly induces a type 2 response characterized by IgG1, IL-4 and IL-5 production in mice. Here, we report the rTsCRT anti-inflammatory activity in a well-known experimental colitis murine model. Mice were orally immunized with purified rTsCRT and colitis was induced with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). Clinical signs of disease, macroscopic and microscopic tissue inflammation, cytokine production and micronuclei formation, as a marker of genotoxicity, were measured in order to assess the effect of rTsCRT immunization on experimentally induced colitis. rTsCRT administration prior to TNBS instillation significantly reduced the inflammatory parameters, including the acute phase cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. Dampened inflammation was associated with increased local expression of IL-13 and systemic IL-10 and TGF-β production. Genotoxic damage produced by the inflammatory response was also precluded. Our results show that oral treatment with rTsCRT prevents excessive TNBS-induced inflammation in mice and suggest that rTsCRT has immunomodulatory properties associated with the expression of type 2 and regulatory cytokines commonly observed in other helminths."

Here, 547 known miRNAs representing 129 miRNA families, and 282 potential novel miRNAs were identified in Beta macrocarpa using small RNA deep sequencing. A phylogenetic analysis was performed, and 8 Beta lineage-specific miRNAs were identified. Through a differential expression analysis, miRNAs associated with Beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV) infection were identified and confirmed using a microarray analysis and stem-loop RT-qPCR. In total, 103 known miRNAs representing 38 miRNA families, and 45 potential novel miRNAs were differentially regulated, with at least a two-fold change, in BNYVV-infected plants compared with that of the mock-inoculated control. Targets of these differentially expressed miRNAs were also predicted by degradome sequencing. These differentially expressed miRNAs were involved in hormone biosynthesis and signal transduction pathways, and enhanced axillary bud development and plant defenses. This work is the first to describe miRNAs of the plant genus Beta and may offer a reference for miRNA research in other species in the genus. It provides valuable information on the pathogenicity mechanisms of BNYVV."
https://openalex.org/W2766593309,"The present study investigated the parameters of nocturnal sleep that mediate the relationship between morningness-eveningness preference and the sleep architecture of naps in university students. This study had a cross-sectional, descriptive correlational design. The sleep architecture of 52 students invited to take an afternoon nap in the laboratory was recorded. The morningness-eveningness questionnaire (MEQ) was used to evaluate morningness-eveningness preference. An actigraph was used to collect students' nighttime sleep data in the week preceding the study. Polysomnography was used to measure the sleep architecture of the participants' naps. After adjustments for potential factors, although the MEQ did not directly correlate with the percentage of sleep stages in naps, the effects of the MEQ on the percentage of Stage 1 sleep, slow-wave sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep; sleep duration; and sleep efficiency of naps were mediated by the total sleep time in the preceding week. This preliminary study suggests that nap quality was affected by morningness-eveningness preference through the mediation of total nocturnal sleep time. Therefore, future studies should be carefully designed to consider nighttime sleep patterns when analyzing the effects of chronotypes on daytime sleep."
https://openalex.org/W2767032802,"Bacteria cells are protected from osmotic and environmental stresses by an exoskeleton-like polymeric structure called peptidoglycan (PG) or murein sacculus. This structure is fundamental for bacteria's viability and thus, the mechanisms underlying cell wall assembly and how it is modulated serve as targets for many of our most successful antibiotics. Therefore, it is now more important than ever to understand the genetics and structural chemistry of the bacterial cell walls in order to find new and effective methods of blocking it for the treatment of disease. In the last decades, liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry have been demonstrated to provide the required resolution and sensitivity to characterize the fine chemical structure of PG. However, the large volume of data sets that can be produced by these instruments today are difficult to handle without a proper data analysis workflow. Here, we present PG-metrics, a chemometric based pipeline that allows fast and easy classification of bacteria according to their muropeptide chromatographic profiles and identification of the subjacent PG chemical variability between e.g. bacterial species, growth conditions and, mutant libraries. The pipeline is successfully validated here using PG samples from different bacterial species and mutants in cell wall proteins. The obtained results clearly demonstrated that PG-metrics pipeline is a valuable bioanalytical tool that can lead us to cell wall classification and biomarker discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2765131683,"Human farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (hFPPS) catalyzes the production of the 15-carbon isoprenoid farnesyl pyrophosphate. The enzyme is a key regulator of the mevalonate pathway and a well-established drug target. Notably, it was elucidated as the molecular target of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, a class of drugs that have been widely successful against bone resorption disorders. More recently, research has focused on the anticancer effects of these inhibitors. In order to achieve increased non-skeletal tissue exposure, we created phenylaminopyridine bisphosphonates (PNP-BPs) that have bulky hydrophobic side chains through a structure-based approach. Some of these compounds have proven to be more potent than the current clinical drugs in a number of antiproliferation assays using multiple myeloma cell lines. In the present work, we characterized the binding of our most potent PNP-BPs to the target enzyme, hFPPS. Co-crystal structures demonstrate that the molecular interactions designed to elicit tighter binding are indeed established. We carried out thermodynamic studies as well; the newly introduced protein-ligand interactions are clearly reflected in the enthalpy of binding measured, which is more favorable for the new PNP-BPs than for the lead compound. These studies also indicate that the affinity of the PNP-BPs to hFPPS is comparable to that of the current drug risedronate. Risedronate forms additional polar interactions via its hydroxyl functional group and thus exhibits more favorable binding enthalpy; however, the entropy of binding is more favorable for the PNP-BPs, owing to the greater desolvation effects resulting from their large hydrophobic side chains. These results therefore confirm the overall validity of our drug design strategy. With a distinctly different molecular scaffold, the PNP-BPs described in this report represent an interesting new group of future drug candidates. Further investigation should follow to characterize the tissue distribution profile and assess the potential clinical benefits of these compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2765297200,"Sucrose is crucial to the growth and development of plants, and sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) plays a key role in sucrose synthesis. To understand the genetic and molecular mechanisms of sucrose synthesis in Cerasus humilis, ChSPS1, a homologue of SPS, was cloned using RT-PCR. Sequence analysis showed that the open reading frame (ORF) sequence of ChSPS1 is 3174 bp in length, encoding a predicted protein of 1057 amino acids. The predicted protein showed a high degree of sequence identity with SPS homologues from other species. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that ChSPS1 mRNA was detected in all tissues and the transcription level was the highest in mature fruit. There is a significant positive correlation between expression of ChSPS1 and sucrose content. Prokaryotic expression of ChSPS1 indicated that ChSPS1 protein was expressed in E. coli and it had the SPS activity. Overexpression of ChSPS1 in tobacco led to upregulation of enzyme activity and increased sucrose contents in transgenic plants. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of ChSPS1 in transgenic tobacco was significantly higher than in wild type plants. These results suggested that ChSPS1 plays an important role in sucrose synthesis in Cerasus humilis."
https://openalex.org/W2766333790,"Socioeconomic status has been shown to be associated with sexual activity, contraceptive-use, pregnancy and abortion among young people. Less is known about whether the strength of the association differs for each outcome, between men and women, or cross-nationally. We investigate this using contemporaneous national probability survey data from Britain and France.Data were analysed for 17-29 year-olds in Britain's third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-3, n = 5959) undertaken 2010-2012, and the 2010 French Fertility, Contraception and Sexual Dysfunction survey (FECOND, n = 3027). For each country, we estimated the gender-specific prevalence of sex before-16, contraceptive-use, conception before-20, and abortion in the event of conception, and used logistic regression to examine associations between two measures of socioeconomic status-educational-level and parental socioeconomic-group-and each outcome. We tested for interactions between socioeconomic characteristics and country, and socioeconomic characteristics and gender, for each outcome.For each outcome, Britain and France differed with regard to prevalence but associations with socioeconomic characteristics were similar. Respondents of higher educational level, and, less consistently, with parents from higher socioeconomic-groups, were less likely to report sex before-16 (Britain, men: adjusted OR (aOR) 0.5, women: aOR 0.5; France, men: aOR 0.5, women: aOR 0.5), no contraception at first sex (Britain, men: aOR 0.4, women: aOR 0.6; France, men: aOR 0.4, women: aOR 0.4), pregnancy before-20 (Britain: aOR 0.3; France: aOR 0.1), and in Britain, a birth rather than an abortion in the event of conception (Britain: aOR 3.1). We found no strong evidence of variation in the magnitude of the associations with socioeconomic characteristics by country or gender.Population level differences in conception and abortion rates between the two countries may partly be driven by the larger proportion of the population that is disadvantaged in Britain. This research highlights the role intra-country comparisons can play in understanding young people's sexual and reproductive behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W2766233737,"Urinary tract infection is one of the most common bacterial infections worldwide. Current diagnosis of urinary tract infection chiefly relies on its clinical presentation, urine dipstick tests and urine culture. Small molecules found in bio-fluids related with both infection and recovery would facilitate diagnosis and management of UTI. Mass spectrometry-based fingerprinting of plasma and urine at 3 time points, pre-infection (t = -24h), infection (t = 24h) and post 3-day treatment (t = 112h), were acquired in the following four groups: mice which were healthy, infected but not treated, infected and treated with ciprofloxacin, and infected and treated with Relinqing® granules (n = 6 per group). A metabolomics workflow including multivariate analysis and ROC regression was employed to select metabolic features that correlated with UTI and its treatment. Circa 4,000 molecular features were acquired for each sample. The small acid 3-hydroxybutyrate in plasma was found to be differentiated for urinary tract infection, with an area under the curve = 0.97 (95% confidence interval: 0.93-1.00, accuracy = 0.91, sensitivity = 0.92 and specificity = 0.91). The level of 3-hydroxybutyrate in plasma was depleted after infection with a fold change of -22 (q < 0.0001). Correlation between plasma 3-hydroxybutyrate and urine bacterial number in all groups and time points was r = -0.753 (p < 0.0001). The findings show that 3-hydroxybutyrate is depleted in blood and strongly associated with UTI at both infection and post-treatment stage in a UTI mouse model. Further work is envisaged to assess the clinical potential of blood tests to assist with UTI management."
https://openalex.org/W2766398019,"Mesenchymal stromal cells have been isolated from different sources. They are multipotent cells capable of differentiating into many different cell types, including osteocytes, chondrocytes and adipocytes. They possess a therapeutic potential in the management of immune disorders and the repair of damaged tissues. Previous work in our laboratory showed an increase of the percentages of CD172a+, CD14+, CD163+, Siglec-1+, CD4+ and CD8+ hematopoietic cells, when co-cultured with immortalized mesenchymal cells derived from bone marrow. The present work aimed to demonstrate the stemness properties of SV40-immortalized mesenchymal cells derived from nasal mucosa, lungs, spleen, lymph nodes and red bone marrow and their immunomodulatory effect on blood monocytes. Mesenchymal cells from nasal mucosa, lungs, spleen, lymph nodes and red bone marrow were isolated and successfully immortalized using simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40LT) and later, co-cultured with blood monocytes, in order to examine their differentiation stage (expression of Siglec-1). Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the five mesenchymal cell lines were positive for mesenchymal cell markers CD105, CD44, CD90 and CD29, but lacked the expression of myeloid cell markers CD16 and CD11b. Growth analysis of the cells demonstrated that bone marrow derived-mesenchymal cells proliferated faster compared with those derived from the other tissues. All five mesenchymal cell lines co-cultured with blood monocytes for 1, 2 and 7 days triggered the expression of siglec-1 in the monocytes. In contrast, no siglec-1+ cells were observed in monocyte cultures without mesenchymal cell lines. Mesenchymal cells isolated from nasal mucosa, lungs, spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow were successfully immortalized and these cell lines retained their stemness properties and displayed immunomodulatory effects on blood monocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2766995918,"Direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from black hole (BH) mergers began in earnest in 2015, but until this August, astronomers hunting for electromagnetic (EM) counterparts to GW events were left in the dark. Published in Science 's First Release this week, Kasliwal et al. ( 1 ), Evans et al. ( 2 ), Hallinan et al. ( 3 ), and Coulter et al. ( 4 ) detail the exciting search and discovery of a panchromatic transient, dubbed EM170817, which they argue is the first unassailable EM counterpart to a GW event. That event (GW170817) was promptly recognized by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo collaboration ( 5 ) as resulting from the merger of two neutron stars (NSs), compact stellar remnants about 40% more massive than the Sun but only a few kilometers in radius. The reported observations, connecting GWs to both gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and a long-theorized—but hitherto undetected—short-lived EM transient represents a watershed moment in astrophysics."
https://openalex.org/W2766742794,"The multiple insecurities, anatomical, physiological and psychological changes arising from the gestational period can generate an overload of stress in the mother and cause disturbances in the offspring, affecting it throughout its development. The existing analysis linking prenatal stress and offspring's anxiety have divergent results, being limited as to gestational week, type of stressor and age of progeny's assessment. Social separation has been described as a stressor that causes increase in anxiety. Thus, the present study evaluated the effects of social separation applied in one of the three gestational weeks of rat dams on the manifestation of the defensive behaviors related to generalized anxiety disorder and panic in the Elevated T Maze of the male progeny in three stages of development (1, 3 or 6 months of life). It was found, in the offspring of grouped (control) dams, increased behaviors associated with generalized anxiety disorder and a reduction of panic-like behaviors throughout development. For animals whose dams were socially separated during pregnancy, the most critical period of exposure was the 2nd gestational week, which affected the acquisition of aversive memory, demonstrated by the impairment on learning of avoidances of the offspring in all ages evaluated. Stressor exposure in this week also increased the avoidances, related to generalized anxiety of progeny in the 1st month and decreased escapes, related to panic in the 3rd month of life and, at the age of 6 months old, an inverse situation, with the reduction of the defensive behaviors associated to generalized anxiety disorder. The results show that, when assessing effects of prenatal stress on the manifestation of anxiety, not only the period of exposure is important, but also the age of offspring assessed."

We explored the effect of human plasma-derived C1-INH on allergic lung inflammation in a house dust mite (HDM) induced asthma mouse model by daily administration of C1-INH (15 U) during the challenge phase. NaCl and HDM exposed mice had comparable plasma C1-INH levels, while bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) levels were increased in HDM exposed mice coinciding with slightly reduced activation of complement (C5a). C1-INH treatment reduced Th2 response and enhanced HDM-specific IgG1. Influx of eosinophils in BALF or lung, pulmonary damage, mucus production, procoagulant response or plasma leakage in BALF was similar in both groups. In conclusion, C1-INH dampens Th2 responses during HDM induced allergic lung inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2765888738,"Cooling the lower abdomen is one of the Japanese traditional non-pharmacological prophylactic managements for postpartum hemorrhage. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of cooling the lower abdomen in reducing postpartum blood loss compared with no intervention. In both cases, women delivered vaginally without prophylactic oxytocin in the third stage of labor.In this randomized controlled trial, the lower abdomen was cooled by placement of an 8.6°C icepack during the first 2 h after placental delivery. The primary outcome was measured as the total blood loss within 2 h after delivery. This study had 80% power at the two tails of 5% significance level to detect the mean difference (MD, 70 g) in total blood loss within 2 h after delivery between the two groups. The sample size was calculated as 144 women (72 women per group).Between January and May 2016, 160 women were randomly assigned to the intervention group (cooling the lower abdomen, n = 81) or the control group (n = 79). Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, with the exception of mean blood loss during the third stage of labor. The primary outcome was not reduced by cooling, compared with no intervention (mean blood loss, 513.3 vs. 478.1 g, respectively; MD = 35.2 g; 95% confidence interval = -65.3-135.7). No adverse events occurred; however, seven (8.7%) women in the intervention group declined to continue cooling the lower abdomen because of discomfort.Compared with the control group, cooling the lower abdomen did not reduce the total amount of blood loss up to 2 h after delivery.UMIN-CTR UMIN000019834."
