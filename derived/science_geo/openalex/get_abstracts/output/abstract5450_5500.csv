https://openalex.org/W2035520923,"A derivative of bacteriophage Î» has been modified and tested together with an appropriate host system to meet the criteria of EK2 biologic containment for cloning DNA from higher organisms. In this report certain of the safety features are summarized and some of the tests carried out to confirm the containment properties of the vector are described. The cloning efficiency of this system, together with available gene purification and hybrid screening technology, indicate that it can be used to clone DNA fragments carrying specific, unique mammalian genes."
https://openalex.org/W2046015569,"Flagellar antigens are specified by two genes, H1 and H2. The expression of these genes is regulated such that only one gene activity, or phase, is expressed at a given time. Molecular cloning techniques were used to isolate the segments of Salmonella DNA which contain these genetic loci. Heteroduplex analyses revealed an anomaly in the cloned fragment, that is, an apparent inversion, which was shown to be adjacent to the H2 gene. A correlation was demonstrated between the phase state of the H2 gene and the sequence of the adjacent segment. We propose that an inversion of this region is the phase-determining event in flagellar gene expression in Salmonella."
https://openalex.org/W1495200137,"The role of Ca2+ ions in alpha-adrenergic activation of hepatic phosphorylase was studied using isolated rat liver parenchymal cells. The activation of glucose release and phosphorylase by the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine was impaired in cells in which calcium was depleted by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) treatment and restored by calcium addition, whereas the effects of a glycogenolytically equivalent concentration of glucagon on these processes were unaffected. EGTA treatment also reduced basal glucose release and phosphorylase alpha activity, but did not alter the level of cAMP or the protein kinase activity ratio (-cAMP/+cAMP) or impair viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion, ATP levels, or gluconeogenic rates. The effect of EGTA on basal phosphorylase and glucose output was also rapidly reversed by Ca2+, but not by other ions. Phenylephrine potentiated the ability of low concentrations of calcium to reactivate phosphorylase in EGTA-treated cells. The divalent cation inophore A23187 rapidly increased phosphorylase alpha and glucose output without altering the cAMP level, the protein kinase activity ratio, and the levels of ATP, ADP, or AMP, The effects of the ionophore were abolished in EGTA-treated cells and restored by calcium addition. Phenylephrine rapidly stimulated 45Ca uptake and exchange in hepatocytes, but did not affect the cell content of 45Ca at late time points. A glycogenolytically equivalent concentration of glucagon did not affect these processes, whereas higher concentrations were as effective as phenylephrine. The effect of phenylephrine on 45Ca uptake was blocked by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phenoxybenzamine, was unaffected by the beta blocker propranolol, and was not mimicked by isoproterenol. The following conclusions are drawn: (a) alpha-adrenergic activation of phosphorylase and glucose release in hepatocytes is more dependent on calcium than is glucagon activation of these processes; (b) variations in liver cell calcium can regulate phosphorylase alpha levels and glycogenolysis; (c) calcium fluxes across the plasma membrane are stimulated more by phenylephrine than by a glycogenolytically equivalent concentration of glucagon. It is proposed that alpha-adrenergic agonists activate phosphorylase by increasing the cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ ions, thus stimulating phosphorylase kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2161695812,"The poly(A)-containing RNA, isolated from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been characterized with regard to the number and distribution of sequences by a kinetic analysis of RNA-cDNA hybridization. In agreement with results previously obtained on metazoan eucaryotes (Bishop et al., 1974), discrete complexity classes were observed. There exist low, medium, and high complexity classes which contain approximately 20, 400, and 2400 sequences, respectively. This measurements of the number of sequences has been verified by hybridization with single copy DNA. 20% of the single copy fraction of the yeast genome is rendered double-stranded by poly(A)-containing RNA. Assuming asymmetric transcription, this is equivalent to approximately 4000 poly(A)-containing sequences, verifying the results obtained with RNA-cDNA hybridization. In addition, the first-order kinetics of the hybridization with single copy DNA verified the notion that most of the sequence complexity is present at the same intracellular concentration. The same number and distribution of sequences were found in poly(A)-containing polysomal RNA and in total RNA, suggesting that most or all of the sequence complexity is on polysomes and is adenylated. The results indicate that RNA-cDNA hybridization is an accurate method for determining sequence complexity values and that yeast, grown under vegetative conditions, has 3000-4000 different mRNA sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1518753545,"Several clones of Chinese hamster ovary cells have been selected for their resistance to the toxic effects of wheat germ agglutinin. The clones do not bind wheat germ agglutinin as well as parent cells and are 5- to 250-fold more resistant to the toxic effects of the lectin. Of three clones studied in detail, all exhibit a decrease in wheat germ agglutinin binding affinity. Two have normal numbers of wheat germ agglutinin binding sites, while one (Clone 13) has a 65% decrease in binding sites. Crude membrane preparations of the clones have a decrease in sialic acid content relative to parent cells, and Clone 13 membranes are also deficient in galactose, while the mannose and hexosamine contents of all three clones are normal. The membrane sugar deficiencies affect both glycoproteins and glycolipids. Sialyl-lactosylceramide is the major glycolipid in parent cells, while Clones 1 and 1021 have lactosylceramide and Clone 13 has glucosylceramide as the predominant glycolipid. Labeling experiments with N-[G-3H]acetylmannosamine suggest that Clone 1021 cells have a block in the transfer of sialic acid from CMP-sialic acid to glycoprotein and glycolipid acceptors. Yet CMP-sialic acid:glycoprotein sialyl-transferase activity in cell lysates of Clone 1021 cells is 80% of normal. While CMP-sialic acid:lactosylceramide sialyl-transferase activity is only 25% of normal, it can be restored to normal or elevated levels by sodium butyrate induction without an associated increase in cellular sialyl-lactosylceramide content. Similarly, the galactose-deficient Clone 13 can synthesize UDP-galactose and has normal levels of UDP-galactose:glycoprotein galactosyltransferase and UDP-galactose:glucosylceramide galactosyltransferase when assayed in vitro. The glycosyltransferases of both these clones can utilize their own glycoproteins as sugar acceptors in in vitro assays. These data suggest that the variant cells fail to carry out specific glycosyltransferase reactions in vivo despite the fact that they possess the appropriate nucleotide sugars, glycoprotein and glycolipid acceptors, and glycosyltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W1574972316,"Energy coupling for three K+ transport systems of Escherichia coli K-12 was studied by examining effects of selected energy sources and inhibitors in strains with either a wild type or a defective (Ca2+, Mg2+)-stimulated ATPase. This approach allows discrimination between transport systems coupled to the proton motive force from those coupled to the hydrolysis of a high energy phosphate compound (ATP-driven). The three K+ transport systems here studied are: (a) the Kdp system, a repressible high affinity (Km=2 muM) system probably coded for by four linked Kdp genes; (b) the Trka system, a constitutive system with high rate and modest affinity (Km=1.5 mM) defined by mutations in the single trkA gene; and (c) the TrkF system, a nonsaturable system with a low rate of uptake (Rhoads, D.B., Waters, F.B., and Epstein, W. (1976) J. Gen. Physiol. 67, 325-341). Each of these systems has a different mode of energy coupling: (a) the Kdp system is ATP-driven and has a periplasmic protein component; (b) the TrkF system is proton motive force-driven; and (c) the TrkA system is unique among bacterial transport systems described to date in requiring both the proton motive force and ATP for activity. We suggest that this dual requirement represents energy fueling by ATP and regulation by the proton motive force. Absence of ATP-driven systems in membrane vesicles is usually attributed to the requirement of such systems for a periplasmic protein. This cannot explain the failure to demonstrate the TrkA system in vesicles, since this system does not require a periplasmic protein. Our findings indicate that membrane vesicles cannot couple energy to ATP-driven transport systems. Since vesicles can generate a proton motive force, the inability of vesicles to generate ATP or couple ATP to transport (or both) must be invoked to explain the absence of TrkA in vesicles. The TrkF system should function in vesicles, but its very low rate may make it difficult to identify."
https://openalex.org/W1992101913,"Cell surface alterations during myogenesis have been investigated in Yaffe's myogenic cell line L8, using indirect immunofluorescence with an antibody against the large external transformation-sensitive (LETS) protein. The immunofluorescent technique reveals a susbstantial alteration in the distribution of this surface antigen. With the prefused myoblasts, LETS protein is dispersed all over the cell surface; following myoblast fusion, this pattern is markedly changed. All of the fibril-like surface LETS protein disappears, and in some myotubes, discrete clusters of LETS protein become conspicuous. By use of radioimmunological assay, the total LETS protein is quantitatively reduced upon myoblast fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1480773097,"A series of 16 analogs of 5'-deoxy-5'-adenosylcobalamin (adenosylcobalamin) were examined for their effects on the diol dehydrase system of Klebsiella pneumoniae (Aerobacter Aerogenes). Four analogs, ara-adenosyl-, aristeromycyl-, 3-isoadenosyl-, and nebularylcobalamin, were able to function as coenzymes in the diol dehydrase reaction, coenzyme activity decreasing in that order. Like the native holoenzyme, complexes of the enzyme with these four analogs show a cob(II)alamin-like absorption peak or shoulder in the presence of 1,2-propanediol. Analogs containing hypoxanthine, cytosine, or benzimidazole do not function as coenzymes, but are weak competitive inhibitors in the presence of adenosylcobalamin. Analogs in which the D-ribosyl moiety is replaced by L-ribose or by an alkyl chain of 2 to 6 carbons are inactive as coenzymes, but act as competitive inhibitors with extremely high affinity for the apoenzyme. Complexes with the inactive analogs showed visible spectra similar to those of the corresponding free cobalamins. Upon anaerobic photolysis and subsequent aeration, complexes with the first group of inactive analogs produced unusually stabilized cob(II)alamin, while complexes with the second group of inactive analogs were readily photolyzed to a hydroxocobalamin-enzyme complex. Complexes with adeninylpentyl- and L-adenosylcobalamin were stable to light under the same conditions. These findings suggest that both the ribose and the adenine moiety of the nucleoside participate in enzyme-coenzyme interaction, involving not only the binding to the apoenzyme but also the activation of the carbon-cobalt bond."
https://openalex.org/W1534719189,"Primary liver cells, isolated from 16- 17-day-old chick embryos, were incubated in a serum-free chemically defined medium (Ham's F12) supplemented with hormones for up to 6 days. The culture method also includes the complete removal of contaminating red cells before the initiation of culture. On the 2nd day in cluture, the level of amino-levulinate (ALA) synthase activity in response to allylisopropylacetamide (AIA) was increased 6-fold in cells grown in F12. Insulin, hydrocortisone, and triiodothyronine alone had no appreciable effects on ALA synthase levels. On the other hand, when added with AIA, insulin, insulin plus hydrocortisone, insulin plus hydrocortisone triiodothyronine increased ALA synthase levels 17-, 50-, 110-fold, respectively. The maximally induced levels of ALA synthase activity by AIA in the presence of insulin, hydrocortisone, and triiodothyronine were approximately 15 nmol of ALA/mg of protein/h, 37 degrees or 3 micronmol of ALA/g of tissue/h, 37 degrees, a value similar to that found in ovo or at least 5 times greater than that found in rat liver. The morphology of hepatocytes was maintained for at least 6 days in culture, although the induction of ALA synthase was reduced after the 4th day unless triiodothyronine was present. Dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (10(8) M) or glucagon (5x10(8) M) had little effect on the induced as well as noninduced levels of ALA synthase or porphyrins. These data demonstrate a permissive effect of insulin, hydrocortisone, and triiodothyronine on the induction of ALA synthase and porphyrins by AIA in cultured chick embryo liver cells. In the absence of insulin hydrocortisone, or triiodothyronine, AIA produces only a slight increase in ALA synthase activity or porphyrins (or both); on the other hand, it produces a marked increase in the enzyme activity and porphyrins when these hormones are added to the culture medium. The term permissive is applied to these hormone-dependent effects. A sensitive spectrofluorometric method for heme quantitation allowed us to follow changes in the cellular heme content in hemoglobin-free cultured liver cells. Heme content in the cultured liver cells was approximately 250 pmol/mg of protein at the initiation of culture but gradually declined to 175 pmol/mg of protein at the initiation of culture but gradually declined to 175 pmol/mg of protein during 48 h of incubation. The apparent decrease in heme content may be accounted for by the concomitant increase in protein content in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1525276477,"Abstract Two DNA polymerases are present in extracts of commercial bakers' yeast and wild type Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown aerobically to late log phase. Yeast DNA polymerase I and yeast DNA polymerase II can be separated by DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, and denatured DNA-cellulose chromatography from the postmitochondrial supernatants of yeast lysates. The yeast polymerases are both of high molecular weight (greater than 100,000) but are clearly separate species by the lack of immunological cross-reactivity. Analysis of associated enzyme activities and other reaction properties of yeast DNA polymerases provides additional evidence for distinguishing the two species. Enzyme I has no associated nuclease activity but does carry out pyrophosphate exchange and pyrophosphorolysis reactions, and has an associated 3'-exonuclease activity. Enzyme I does not degrade deoxynucleoside triphosphates and cannot utilize a mismatched template. Enzyme II does carry out a template-dependent deoxynucleoside triphosphate degradation reaction and can excise mismatched 3'-nucleotides from suitable template systems. Earlier studies have shown that both Enzyme I and Enzyme II are inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide. The yeast enzymes are not identical to any known eukaryotic or prokaryotic DNA polymerases. In general, Enzyme I appears to be most similar to eukaryotic DNA polymerase alpha and Ezyme II exhibits properties of prokaryotic DNA polymerases II and III."
https://openalex.org/W1995907478,"Nonirradiated mice of the W/WV genotype were injected with normal (+/+) bone marrow cells that had been treated with antiserum to Thy 1.2 and complement (C'). Such bone marrow cells had no effect on the number of macroscopic colonies formed in the spleens of these mice, but did not cure the anemia. The addition of +/+ thymocytes to these bone marrow cells restored their ability to cure the anemia in W/WV mice. These data suggest that a theat-sensitive cell is required in the promotion of differentiation of murine hematopoietic stem cells into erythrocytes, and that there is a deficiency of such a cell in the W/WV mouse."

The third Eco RI site in the lambda chromosome has been altered by mutation, and the left-hand Eco RI fragment has been shortened. The new vector, Î»gt4-lop-11 lig+, forms a stable lysogen which, upon induction, produces a 100-fold increase in DNA ligase activity. Introduction of a phage mutation (S7) that prevents cell lysis results in an even greater increase (500-fold)."
https://openalex.org/W1528601491,"Bacteriophage T4 RNA ligase catalyzes the ATP-dependent ligation of a 5'-phosphoryl-terminated nucleic acid donor to a 3'-hydroxyl-terminated nucleic acid acceptor. We have identified adenylylated DNA and RNA reaction intermediates in which the AMP moiety is attached by a pyrophosphate bond to the 5'-phosphoryl group of the donor. A large amount of DNA-adenylate accumulates during the reaction and the dependence of joining and adenylylation on chain length are similar. The adenylylated donor is joined by ligase to an acceptor in the absence of ATP, and AMP is released stoichiometrically in this reaction. The acceptor is not only a substrate in the reaction but also a cofactor for adenylylation of the donor; in the absence of a 3'-hydroxyl group the activated intermediate does not form. The activated DNA need not join to the acceptor that initially stimulated activation but can also join to another acceptor. This process of acceptor exchanges has proven useful for promoting the cyclization of small DNA substrates and the synthesis of DNA co-polymers."
https://openalex.org/W2082590378,"Four thousand Escherichia coli clones containing yeast DNA inserted into the plasmid pBR313 have been isolated. Of these, 175 clones were identified as carrying yeast transfer RNA genes. The initial analysis of the inserted transfer RNA genes via the colony hybridization technique with individual radioactive transfer RNA species is reported. The data indicate that yeast transfer RNA genes are not highly clustered, although some clustering exists. In addition, it was observed that the reiteration number of different transfer RNA genes may vary extensively."
https://openalex.org/W1495770884,"The amino acid sequence of CB3, the NH2-terminal fragment of troponin-T, and the alignment of all six cyanogen bromide (CB) fragments are reported. Fragment CB3, comprised of 70 residues, has eight of the nine prolines of troponin-T. As observed in other proteins of the myofibrillar system, its NH2 terminus is blocked by an acetyl group. Methionine-containing overlap peptides isolated from a peptic digest of troponin-T as well as 2-(2-nitrophenylsulfenyl)-3-methyl-3'-bromoindolenine cleavage of the protein were used to order the fragments as CB3-CB2-CB5-CB4-CB7-CB6. The complete sequence of troponin-T, a single polypeptide chain of 259 amino acids having a molecular weight of 30,500, is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1556705894,"A microsomal fraction resembling striated muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum was isolated from uterine smooth muscle. ATP induces calcium accumulation in this fraction. Increased temperature enhances calcium accumulation and calcium-activated ATPase. In the absence of ATP, approximately 35% of the intrinsic calcium exchanges with the 45Ca in the incubation medium. In the presence of ATP, exchange of intrinsic calcium with 45Ca increases by an amount which equals the ATP-dependent calcium binding. In preparations partially preloaded with calcium, a steady state of bound calcium is reached when the ATP is exhausted. Calcium is released under these conditions by prostaglandins E2 and F2alpha, but not by PGF1beta. The antibiotic ionophores X537A and A23187, as well as oxytocin, also release calcium previously accumulated under ATP stimulation. None of these agents, with the exception of oxytocin, release intrinsic calcium. Thus, the effect of prostaglandins resembles that of the ionophores, suggesting an ionophoretic action of these prostaglandins. The release of calcium conforms with the in vivo smooth muscle contracting action of these agents."
https://openalex.org/W2108481184,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae we have carried out a detailed study of the response of transcription to the inhibition of translation. Measurement of the incorporation of labeled bases and nucleosides into the nucleoside triphosphate pools revealed that amino acid deprivation brings about a 10- to 50-fold inhibition of such labeling. Therefore accurate comparisons of RNA synthesis using such precursors are difficult to obtain. To overcome this problem we have turned to the use of L-[methyl-3H] methionine as a precursor, because the labeling of the S-adenosylmethionine pool is relatively unaffected by the rate of protein synthesis. Using this precursor, we have observed that in the absence of protein synthesis the transcription of ribosomal RNA is reduced by 80%, the transcription of messenger RNA is reduced by about 25%, and the transcription of transfer RNA is reduced by less than 20%. These results are obtained when protein synthesis is inhibited either by deprivation of an amino acid or by the addition of cycloheximide. Ribosomal precursor RNA synthesized in the absence of protein synthesis is fully methylated. We conclude that the transcription of rRNA is the primary target of stringent control. Furthermore the inhibition of protein synthesis, itself, may be the trigger for this response."
https://openalex.org/W1991425441,Colicinogenic plasmid E1 (Col E1) and Col E1 derivatives offer advantages as plasmid cloning vehicles with regard to both utility and biological containment. The Col E1 derivative pCR1 does not alter those essential characteristics of the enfeebled Escherichia coli strain x1776 that make this strain particularly useful as a host-vehicle system for recombinant DNA research.
https://openalex.org/W1580123086,"We have shown that purified rabbit skeletal muscle AMP-aminohydrolase binds to rabbit muscle myosin, heavy meromyosin, and Subfragment 2 but does not bind to light meromyosin nor to Subfragment 1. The dissociation constant for binding to myosin was determined to be 0.14 muM. A new sedimentation boundary, presumably reflecting formation of a complex between AMP-aminohydrolase and heavy meromyosin or Subfragment 2, can be observed using the analytical ultracentrifuge. Binding of AMP-aminohydrolase to myosin, heavy meromyosin, or Subfragment 2 is abolished by phosphate (less than 10 mM), an inhibitor of AMP-aminohydrolase. No other rabbit muscle enzyme tested showed any interaction with myosin under the same conditions and there was no indication of complex formation between AMP-aminohydrolase and phosphofructokinase or phosphocreatine kinase in the analytical ultracentrifuge."
https://openalex.org/W1562797470,"A pro-clotting enzyme capable of causing the gelation of clottable proteins in Limulus polyphemus (horseshoe crab) has been purified to apparent homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. The activation of the pro-clotting enzyme depended on the presence of both Ca+ and endotoxin. It contained gamma-carboxyglutamic acids and gave a single NH2-terminal lysine. The enzyme was inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and soy bean trypsin inhibitor, indicating that it is a serine protease. The molecular weight of the proclotting enzyme was determined to be at least 150,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis under reducing and denaturing conditions. The protein appears to consist of a single peptide chain, since exposure of the reduced and carboxymethylated enzyme to 6 M guanidine hydrochloride failed to dissociate it into any subunits."
https://openalex.org/W92551535,"The interaction of monovalent cations with holotryptophanase has been examined by spectral and kinetic methods. Using S-orthonitrophenyl-L-cysteine as a substrate, activation by the following monovalent cations was demonstrated; values of KA (mM, in italics) and Vmax (mumol min-1 mg) aare given in parentheses: Li+ (54 +/- 11.6, 4.3 +/- 0.28), Na+ (40 +/- 0.03, 18) K+ (1.44 +/- 0.06, 41.1 +/- 3.5), Tl+ (0.95 +/- 0.1, 39 +/- 4.4), NH4+ (0.23 +/- 0.01, 57.9 +/- 2.6), Rb+ (3.5 +/- 0.3, 33.5 +/- 1.8), Cs+ (14.6 +/- 2.6, 21 +/- 2.3). It was demonstrated by circular dichroic spectra that the competitive inhibitor, ethionine, interacts with the holoenzyme in the absence of activating monovalent cations, although it does not undergo labilization of the alpha proton. On addition of monovalent cation to the holoenzyme-ethionine complex, a marked increase occurs in absorption of 508 nm resulting from labilization of the alpha proton with formation of the quinoid form of the pyridoxal phosphate moiety of the enzyme-substrate complex at the catalytic center (Morino, Y., and Snell, E.E. (1967) J. Biol. Chem; 242, 2800-2809. The extent of formation of this quinoid intermediate was linearly related to the maximum velocity observed with each cation except NH4+, which was anomalously active. When measured at 500 nm, the change in absorption ranged from deltaA = 0.45 mg-1 of tryptophanase for NH4+ to 0.06 mg-1 for Li+. Two moles of thallium (I) were bound per mole of subunit. The data are most consistent with the interaction of monovalent cation at or near the catalytic center in such a way that it either participates directly in the reaction or is required for the critical alignment of one or more functional groups necessary for catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2171360051,"The effect of N10-formyl-H4folate on mitochondrial peptide chain initiation has been studied in isolated mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The addition of N10-formyl-H4-folate strongly stimulates the incorporation of amino acids into mitochondrial protein at both 6 and 15 mm Mg2+. Still higher stimulation (up to 10-fold) has been obtained in the production of de novo synthesized initial peptides, measured as peptidyl puromycin derivatives. The maximum effect is observed at 0.1 mM N10-formyl-H4folate. At 5 mM puromycin, the ratio formylated/unformylated peptides is 3, as shown by electrophoretic analysis. At 10 mM puromycin, the ratio is increased to more than 6. This is due to the presence of deformylase and amidohydrolase activities, which are more effective the longer the initial peptide is synthesized; at increasing puromycin concentrations, progressively shorter peptide chains are formed. Chemically synthesized fMet-puromycin and Met-puromycin are virtually stable when incubated with intact or frozen and thawed mitochondria. More careful kinetic analysis shows an early cessation of the initial peptide formation in the samples without N10-formyl-H4-folate. This indicates that the formylation of methionyl-tRNA formylatable species is an absolute requirement for mitochondrial peptide chain initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1600731924,"cDNA, synthesized from rabbit globin mRNA, was used in a self-priming reaction, with avian myeloblastosis virus DNA polymerase, for the synthesis of double-stranded DNA. Globin DNA ranging from about 400 to 650 base pairs was elongated with dG tails using deoxypolynucleotide transferase and was annealed to linear Escherichia coli plasmic pCR1, elongated with dC tails. Preparation of the plasmid DNA involved an enzymatic reconstruction of one EcoRI-specific site on each side of the molecule. After transformation of E. coli cells to kanamycin resistance with the hybrid molecules, bacterial clones harboring recombinant plasmids were studied for the presence of globin-specific DNA. Plasmids containing either alpha or beta rabbit globin gene sequences were obtained. There was a 4-fold excess of recombinant plasmids containing beta-globin sequences over those with alpha-globin DNA. The longest beta-globin sequences found in plasmids were about 550 to 600 pairs long, and correspond therefore to the entire beta-globin structural gene and to some of the untranslated regions. The alpha-globin sequences were 400 to 450 base pairs long. Treatment of clone pCR1betarG 19 with EcoRI endonuclease released two DNA fragments (410 and 210 base pairs) resulting from cleavage at two reconstructed external EcoRI sites and at one internal EcoRI site within the rabbit globin gene. The same treatment of pCR1alpharG 11 released one fragment. In most other recombinant plasmids studied however, no fragment was released by EcoRI digestion."
https://openalex.org/W2227488804,"Radioactive elongation factor Tu coded by either the tufA or the tufB gene of Escherichia coli K-12 was isolated from cells incubated with a mixture of radioactive amino acids after infection with the defective lambda phage particles that carry either of these genes. Two-dimensional chromatographic analyses of tryptic digests of the tufB gene product revealed about 50 radioactive spots. These same spots plus an additional one were also found in tryptic digests of the tufA gene product. Furthermore, these peptide maps are qualitatively the same as those of the elongation factor Tu obtained from two separate isolates of uninfected E. coli K-12 or from rel+ and relA strains of E. coli B. Because the number of spots recovered is consistent with the number of trypsin-sensitive sites, these analyses indicate that the tufA and tufB genes have not significantly diverged from each other."
https://openalex.org/W1648075174,"We examined the effect of adriamycin on kinetics of DNA synthesis catalyzed by DNA polymerase purified from bacteriophage T4-infected Escherichia coli. Two distinct modes of enzyme inhibition occur: uncompetitive and competitive at low and high drug:DNA nucleotide molar ratios, respectively. Competitive inhibition is not observed unless an unblocked amino group is present on the sugar (daunosamine) moiety. A model is proposed to relate the enzyme inhibition kinetics to intercalative and ionic binding of adriamycin to DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1560480214,"Double-stranded ovalbumin DNA was amplified and purified by the cloning of bacterial transformants. The double-stranded DNA was synthesized from a complete complementary DNA transcript of ovalbumin mRNA using Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and the self-priming ability of the initial transcript. After S. nuclease treatment, poly(dA) was added to the 3â termini with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and the ovalbumin gene was hybridized to a linear plasmid DNA, pMB9, containing 3â-poly(dT) termini. This hybrid molecule was used to transform the E. coli strain X1849. The cloned transformants contained from 30 to 53% of the complete ovalbumin DNA as determined by hybridization with full length cDNA. The length of the inserts was confirmed by treatment of the isolated plasmids with the restriction enzyme Hha I. Separation of the fragments by agarose gel electrophoresis showed that the amount of inserted DNA in clones tested varied from 680 to 1090 base pairs."

https://openalex.org/W1600013467,"The heterogeneous form of nitrate reductase released from the membrane fraction of Escherichia coli by heat treatment was converted to a new electrophoretic form by incubation with trypsin. As a result of the trypsin treatment, the heat-released enzyme was converted from an associating-dissociating system to a nonassociating monomer (Mr approximately 200,000) which retained full enzymatic activity. Several distinct subunits in the 47,000- to 59,000-dalton range were converted to a single 43,000-dalton subunit during the trypsin treatment, while the other major subunit (155,000 daltons) was unaffected. Nitrate reductase extracted from the membrane fraction with deoxycholate and ammonium sulfate was composed of two apparently homogeneous subunits (155,000 and 59,000 daltons). The detergent-extracted enzyme preparation was converted by trypsin to an electrophoretic form very similar to the product of trypsin treatment of the heat-released enzyme with an identical subunit composition (155,000 and 43,000 daltons). These results demonstrate that the heterogeneous subunits present in the heat-released enzyme are produced during heat treatment by proteolytic cleavage of a single 59,000-dalton subunit. The fragments removed by trypsin treatment are implicated in the self-associating properties of the heat-released enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1608428024,"Among the membrane proteins synthesized in toluene-treated cells of Escherichia coli were two distinct membrane proteins of different molecular weights, which were cross-reactive with antiserum against a structural lipoprotein of the outer membrane. One was thought to be the known membrane lipoprotein since it migrated to the same position as that of the lipoprotein (Mr = 7,200) in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, the other protein migrated slower than the lipoprotein. No protein corresponding to the slower-migrating species was detected in the membrane proteins synthesized in vivo. The apparent molecular weight of the protein at the new peak was estimated to be between 10,000 and 15,000. Both the new protein and the lipoprotein were found to be synthesized from stable mRNA(s) in the toluene-treated cells. The synthesis of the new protein as well as the lipoprotein was sensitive to chloramphenicol, indicating that both proteins were synthesized on ribosomes. Peptides mapping of the new protein revealed the same COOH-terminal sequence as in the lipoprotein. This indicates that the new protein has an extra sequence at the NH2-terminal end. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the NH2 terminus of the new lipoprotein is methionine, while that of the lipoprotein is a substituted cysteine. From double label experiments with each of 17 different amino acids and arginine, the amino acid composition of the extra region was deduced. The new protein was found to contain at least 18 to 19 extra amino acid residues over the lipoprotein, if it is assumed that the new protein has no extra arginine residues. It was found that 4 out of the 5 amino acids which were deficient in the lipoprotein (phenylalanine, tryptophan, proline, and histidine) were also deficient in the new protein, but the fifth one, glycine, was present in the new protein. From these results, it seems possible that this new form of the lipoprotine is a precursor of the lipoprotein (prolipoprotein) in the process of biosynthesis and assembly of the lipoprotein in the outer membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2067360091,"The temperature-sensitive mutant of yeast, rna2-, when incubated at the nonpermissive temperature, has a qualitatively distinct distribution of mRNA sequences as compared to wild-type. Quantitative comparison with the wild-type distribution indicates that after 1 hr at the nonpermissive temperature, the concentration of approximately 100-150 abundant sequences is significantly decreased. Control experiments indicate that this effect is not simply a function of the increase in incubation temperature nor a general effect on all mRNAs. Gorenstein and Warner (1976) have shown that the synthesis of ribosomal proteins is preferentially depressed at the non-permissive temperature in rna2-. It is proposed that among these 100-150 sequences are the mRNAs which code for the ribosomal proteins."

After reduction, alkylation and subsequent degradation of the modified enzyme with alpha-chymotrypsin, the principal radioactive decapeptide of sequence Val-Gly-Ala-Met-Arg-Pro-Ser-Thr-Ser-Met was isolated. A second radioactive hexapeptide Arg-Pro-Ser-Thr-Ser-Met resulting from chymotryptic digestion of the decapeptide was also isolated.

We report a method for solubilization of one such peptide, bacteriophage fl coat protein, by chemical modification in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Following this treatment the 50-residue peptide was degraded stepwise in an automated sequenator using a single cleavage Quadrol program with high repetitive yield through residue 47. We also report a modified program using detergent incorporated into dimethylallylamine buffer which permitted sequencing with high repetitive yields for at least the first 18 residues of the unmodified and otherwise highly insoluble coat protein. The presence of detergent caused no observable difficulties in detection of residues by gas chromatography, thin layer chromatography, or amino acid analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1550261037,"1. Studies on the function of initiation factor 1 (IF-1) in the formation of 30 S initiation complexes have been carried out. IF-1 appears to prevent the dissociation of initiation factor 2 (IF-2) from the 30 S initiation complex. The factor has no effect on either the initial binding of IF-2 nor does it increase the amount of IF-2 dependent fMet-tRNA and GTP bound to the 30 S subunit. Bound fMet-tRNA remains stable to sucrose gradient centrifugation even in the absence of IF-1. 2. It is postulated that the presence of IF-2 on the 30 S complex is necessary so that at the time of junction with the 50 S subunit to form a 70 S complex, the 70 S-dependent GTPase activity of IF-2 can hydrolyze GTP. This hydrolysis provides a means by which GTP can be removed to facilitate formation of a 70 S initiation complex active in peptidyl transfer. In support of this postulate, it was observed that 30 S initiation complexes formed in the absence of IF-1 could be depleted of their complexes were still able to accept 50 S subunits to form 70 S complexes which could still donate fMet-tRNA into peptide linkages. These results indicate that 30 S complexes lacking GTP do not require IF-2 for formation of active 70 S complexes. 3. IF-1, which is required to prevent dissociation of IF-2 from the 30 S initiation complex, is also required for release of IF-2 from ribosomes following 70 S initiation complex formation. The mechanisms of the release of IF-2 has been studied in greater detail. Evidence is presented which rules out the presence of a stable IF-2 GDP complex on the surface of the 70 S ribosome following GTP hydrolysis and of any exchange reactions between IF-1 and guanine nucleotides necessary for effecting the release of IF-2. IF-2 remains on the 70 S initiation complexes after release of guanine nucleotides and can be liberated solely by addition of IF-1."
https://openalex.org/W2025875538,Addition of Eco RI fragment 6 of the Escherichia coli sex factor F to pSC101 increases the frequency of its transmission by RI-19 and ColVB. Transmission frequencies of pSC101 and two pSC101 chimeras are also increased after the putative transposition of drug resistance element Tn3 from RI-19. These increases may result from addition of an origin of conjugatinal transfer to the plasmids.
https://openalex.org/W1984617465,"Strains of Escherichia coli K12 have been constructed as safer hosts for use in recombinant DNA research, These strains are unable to survive passage through the intestinal tracts of rats because of a constellation of mutations conferring bile sensitivity and requirements for diaminopimelic acid and thymine. Since death caused by diaminopimelic acid deprivation could release recombinant DNA before DNA is degraded because of thymine starvation, it is important to determine the ""survival potential"" of the released DNA's. Bacterial and plasmid DNA's extracted from bacterial cells are rapidly degraded when added to low dilutions of rat intestinal contents. This observation, coupled with the stringent requirements necessary for in vitro transformation or transfection, make in vivo transmission of naked recombinant DNA in the rat intestinal tract highly improbable."
https://openalex.org/W1494916470,"The rate of transfer of amino acid from enzyme-bound aminoacyl adenylate to tRNA has been compared with the rate of esterification of free amino acid. The approach of Lovgren et al. (Lovgren, T. N. E., Heinonen, J., and Loftfield, R. B. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 3854-3860) was used, with 14C in the aminoacyl adenylate and 3H in the free amino acid and with both the lysine and isoleucine systems of Escherichia coli. In both systems kinetic analyses show more rapid transfer from the preformed enzyme complex when interference by the back reaction with inorganic pyrophosphate was eliminated. Parallel experiments, in which the amount of enzyme complex was measured, confirmed that aminoacyl adenylate is an intermediate in both systems. No evidence was found for an alternative mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1532227985,"Stopped flow spectrophotometry was used to investigate the kinetics of the transition of the phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (3-phosphoglycerate: NAD oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.95) reaction from the active to the inhibited rate upon the addition of the physiological inhibitor serine. The transition was characterized by a single first order rate constant (kobs,i) which was independent of enzyme concentration. At pH 8.5, kobs,i increased in a hyperbolic manner with serine concentration from 2 to 8 s-1. The increase in kobs,i occurred at serine concentrations where the steady state inhibition was virtually complete. These results indicate that serine inhibition is an allosteric process involving a conformational change in the enzyme. A model is presented in which serine at low concentrations binds exclusively to the inhibited state of the enzyme and shifts the equilibrium toward that state; at high serine concentrations, serine binds to the active state, facilitating its conversion to the inhibited state. An alternative model, which we favor, proposes two classes of inhibitor binding sites. The kinetics of the fluorescence quenching of enzyme-bound NADH by serine (Sugimoto, E., and Pizer, L.I. (1968) J. Biol. Chem. 243, 2090-2098), measured by stopped flow fluorimetry, was also characterized by a single first order rate constant (kobs,f.q.) which was independent of enzyme concentration. At pH 8.5, kobs,f.q. ranged from 0.4 s-1 at low serine concentrations to 1.1 s-1 at high serine concentrations. These results indicate that the fluorescence quenching induced by serine is a manifestation of a structural change in the enzyme. Enzyme and excess NADH were mixed with substrate and serine in the stopped flow instrument, and enzyme-bound NADH fluorescence was monitored by exciting through the protein at 285 nm. A rapid fluorescence quenching process, which occurred within the mixing time, was followed by a slower fluorescence enhancement process which terminated in a steady state level corresponding to the quenched fluorescence of the enzyme NADH serine complex. The rapid quenching was the result of substrate binding (Dubrow, R., and Pizer, L.I. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 1539-1551). The fluorescence enhancement was characterized by a single first order rate constant whose value for a given serine concentration corresponded with Kobs,j. This data shows that the quenched state of the enzyme-NADH-complex is the state which is directly responsible for the inhibition of enzyme activity. During catalysis the quenched state is achieved from a different initial conformation, and consequently at a different rate, than in the absence of substrate. kobs,j and kobs,f.q. were also measured using glycine, another inhibitor. The ultraviolet difference spectrum between enzyme and enzyme plus serine was determined and proposed to be the result of the same structural change which is responsible for the fluorescence quenching by serine."
https://openalex.org/W1543938243,"The specific activities of 15 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were measured after growth under a variety of conditions that produced a range of cell-doubling times. The specific activity of each synthetase increased as cell-doubling time decreased. Control experiments eliminate the possibility that these results are due to preferential recovery of synthetases, or to the presence of activators in the faster growing cultures or inhibitors in the slower growing ones. These observations run counter to the expectation that synthetases in bacteria and yeast are negatively regulated by free amino acids, or, more likely, by aminoacyl-tRNA. In fact, as the growth medium was enriched, generation times decreased, and synthetase and aminoacyl-tRNA levels increased. It is suggested that cytoplasmic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases may be more or less coordinately controlled such that their response to growth follows the pattern observed for ribosome production and RNA synthesis. This suggests the possibility of coordinated response of genes for components of the protein synthetic apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1489377528,"In the presence of RNA polymerase, RNase H, discriminatory factors alpha and beta, Escherichia coli binding protein, DNA elongation factor I, DNA elongation factor II preparation, DNA polymerase III, and ATP, UTP, GTP, CTP, dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, fd viral DNA can be quantitatively converted to RFII containing a unique gap in the linear minus strand. This gap, mapped with the aid of restriction endonucleases HinII and HpaII, is located within Fragment Hpa-H of the fd genome. The discrimination reaction has been resolved into two steps: Step A, fd viral DNA, E. coli binding protein, and discriminatory factors alpha and beta form a protein DNA complex; Step B, the complex isolated by agarose gel filtration selectively forms fd RFII when supplemented with RNase H, RNA polymerase, and the DNA elongation proteins. The omission of any of the proteins described above during the first reaction resulted in either no discrimination or a decrease in discrimination when the missing protein was added during the second step. Results are presented which indicate that E. coli binding protein, discriminatory factors alpha and beta, and RNase H must be present during the time RNA synthesis occurs in order to selectively form RFII from fd DNA and not phiX RFII. The amount of fd and phiX174 RNA-DNA hybrid formed in vitro is directly related to the DNA synthesis observed. Thus, under discriminatory conditions, only fd viral DNA leads to fd RNA-DNA complexes and no phiX RNA-DNA hybrid is formed. Under nondiscriminatory conditions, both DNAs yield RNA-DNA hybrids and DNA synthesis. In the absence of discriminatory factor alpha, no RNA-DNA hybrid is formed with either DNA, and in turn, no DNA synthesis is detected with either DNA template."

https://openalex.org/W1608836264,"Three mutants of Escherichia coli B which are defective in components of the transport system for uridine and uracil were isolated and utilized to study the mechanism of uridine transport. Mutant U- was isolated from a culture resistant to 77 micronM 5-fluorouracil. Mutant U-UR-, isolated from a culture of mutant U-, is resistant to 770 micronM 5-fluorouracil and 750 micronM adenosine. Mutant NUC- is resistant to 80 micronM showdomycin and has been reported previously. The characteristics of uridine transport by E. coli B and the mutants provide data supporting the following conclusions. The transport of adenosine, deoxyadenosine, guanosine, deoxyguanosine, adenine, or guanine by mutant U- and mutant U-UR- is identical with that in the parental strain. Uridine is transported by E. coli B as intact uridine. In addition, extracellular uridine is also rapidly cleaved to uracil and the ribose moiety. The latter is transported into the cells, whereas uracil appears in the medium and is transported by a separate uracil transport system. The entry of the ribose moiety of uridine is fast relative to the uracil and uridine transport processes. The Km values and the inhibitory effects of heterologous nucleosides for the transport of uridine and the ribose moiety of uridine are similar. Studies of cytidine uptake in the parental and mutant strains provide evidence that cytidine is transported by two independent systems, one of which is the same as that involved in the transport of intact uridine. Uridine inhibits but is not transported by the other system for cytidine transport. Evidence for the above conclusions was based on comparisons of the characteristics of [2-14C]uridine, [U-14C]uridine, and [2-14C]cytidine transport using E. coli B and the three transport mutants under conditions which measure initial rates. The nature of the inhibitory effects of heterologous nucleosides on the uridine transport processes and identification of extracellular components from radioactive uridine provides supportive data for the conclusions."

Observable alterations in the growth of hybrids containing yeast DNA insertions were less frequent and less extreme than those seen in hybrids containing E. coli DNA. A lambda-E. coli hybrid was selected after extensive growth on the Pol A (deficient in polymerase I) host which also grew very well on the PolA+ host and may have resulted from some alteration in the hybrid. Hybrids selected on the PolA host gave no evidence for the expression of polymerase I activity.

https://openalex.org/W1513363574,"Abstract The interactions of substrates with succinyl-CoA synthetase were investigated by measuring the enhancement of the longitudinal water proton relaxation rate (PRR) due to Mn(II) to the enzyme substrate complexes. The binding of Mn(II) to the enzyme was investigated by EPR. The effects of phosphorylating the enzyme on its interactions with Mn(II) and substrates were also examined. Mn(II) binds weakly to dephosphosuccinyl-CoA synthetase (E) at approximately four sites with a KD value of 0.14 mM, and the PRR enhancement of the complex, epsilonb, at 24.3 MHZ and 25 degree is 18.8. The phosphoenzyme (E-P) binds Mn(II) more strongly at approximately four sites with a KD value of 0.74 mM, and only a small change in epsilonb to 18.1. Mm ADP binds to E at one or two sites with K2 = 0.5 muM, the values of epsilont for the ternary E-Mn-ADP complex is 17.0. Free ADP binds about 126 times more weakly to the enzyme than does Mn-ADP. PRR titrations indicated that the values of epsilont for the ternary E-Mn-ADP and (E-P)-Mn-ADP complexes are about the same. Mn-ATP binds very weakly or not at all to (E-P)-Mn.Formation of the ternary complexes of CoA with E-Mn or (E-P)-Mn could be followed by small but significant increases in the PRR enhancement. No ternary complex with succinate could be detected since the addition of succinate had no effect on the PRR enhancement. However, a large decrease in enhancement, at least 2-fold, was observed upon addition of both succinate and CoA. An increase in the PRR enhancement was produced by the interaction of succinyl-CoA with the E-Mn complex. Upper limits of the dissociation constants for CoA from the quaternary E-Mn-ADP-succinate-CoA complex and for succinyl-CoA from the quaternary E-Mn-ADP-succinyl-CoA complex are 390 and 560 muM, respectively. The epsilon values for the quaternary and quinary complexes are 6.4 and 3.1, respectively. The successive occupation of substrate binding sites of succinyl-CoA synthetase produces alterations in the molecular dynamics or in the conformation of the active site (or both), which are accompanied by progressive decreases in the values of epsilon. Thus, the physical parameter used in these studies relects the previously observed catalytic properties of the enzyme system inasmuch as the catalytic function of succinyl-CoA synthetase is potentiated by substrate binding, and catalytic avtivity in partial reactions is maximized as binding sites are successively occupied."
https://openalex.org/W1521762547,"The molecule weight of the biodegradative threonine deaminase from Escherichia coli was determined to be approximately 147,000 by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation. Similar experiments using 5 M guanidinium chloride gave a value of 39,000 for the molecular weight of the enzyme subunit. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis the enzyme also dissociated into a single subunit with an estimated molecular weight of 38,000. The NH2 terminus of the enzyme was determined to be methionine by the dinitrophenylation procedure. Quantitative analysis revealed that 3.6 mol of methionine were detected per 147,000 g of enzyme. The selective tritium labeling method established alanine as the COOH-terminal residue. The sequence of residues at the NH2 terminus, determined using an automated sequence analyzer, was: (formula: see text). The fact that a single amino acid was released at each degradation step in the above experiment strongly suggests that the subunits in the enzyme contain the same amino acid sequence. Therefore, the native enzyme with a molecular weight of 147,000 appears to be composed of four identical polypeptide subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1598745525,"DNA replication in Escherichia coli is inhibited by uncouplers such as 2,4-dibromophenol and 3,3'4',5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide. Inhibition occurs in either aerobically or anaerobically growing cells or in cells made permeable by toluene. With anaerobically growing cells, inhibition by dibromophenol is reversible and occurs under conditions in which there is no change in pools of ATP or deoxynucleoside triphosphates. With toluenized cells, inhibition is not due to breakdown of deoxynucleoside triphosphates. The rates of protein and RNA synthesis are not inhibited either in vivo or in toluenized cells by concentrations of dibromophenol or tetrachlorosalicylanilide which inhibit replication. It is generally believed that uncouplers inhibit many other cellular processes by collapsing a proton gradient across a membrane. However, the relative effectiveness of eight uncouplers and related compounds to inhibit replication did not parallel their ability to transport protons into E. coli cells. Therefore, the inhibition by uncouplers does not suggest that replication depends on a chemiosmotic process. A possible explanation for the uncoupler sensitivity is provided by the finding that many of the purified enzymes tested, including DNA polymerases II and III, are inhibited by dibromophenol and tetrachlorosalicylanilide."

A preliminary study of the alkaline hydrolysis of the 7-methylguanosine residue that occurs at position 47 showed that at least two products are formed instead of only one as usually quoted in the literature. A rapid, ultramicro, chromatographic system for separating these products and measuring them quantitatively is described."
