https://openalex.org/W1991274614,"In the tongue, distinct classes of taste receptor cells detect the five basic tastes; sweet, sour, bitter, sodium salt and umami. Among these qualities, bitter and sour stimuli are innately aversive, whereas sweet and umami are appetitive and generally attractive to animals. By contrast, salty taste is unique in that increasing salt concentration fundamentally transforms an innately appetitive stimulus into a powerfully aversive one. This appetitive-aversive balance helps to maintain appropriate salt consumption, and represents an important part of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. We have shown previously that the appetitive responses to NaCl are mediated by taste receptor cells expressing the epithelial sodium channel, ENaC, but the cellular substrate for salt aversion was unknown. Here we examine the cellular and molecular basis for the rejection of high concentrations of salts. We show that high salt recruits the two primary aversive taste pathways by activating the sour- and bitter-taste-sensing cells. We also demonstrate that genetic silencing of these pathways abolishes behavioural aversion to concentrated salt, without impairing salt attraction. Notably, mice devoid of salt-aversion pathways show unimpeded, continuous attraction even to very high concentrations of NaCl. We propose that the 'co-opting' of sour and bitter neural pathways evolved as a means to ensure that high levels of salt reliably trigger robust behavioural rejection, thus preventing its potentially detrimental effects on health."

https://openalex.org/W1980826561,"Hybrid quantum systems with inherently distinct degrees of freedom play a key role in many physical phenomena. Famous examples include cavity quantum electrodynamics, trapped ions, or electrons and phonons in the solid state. Here, a strong coupling makes the constituents loose their individual character and form dressed states. Apart from fundamental significance, hybrid systems can be exploited for practical purpose, noteworthily in the emerging field of quantum information control. A promising direction is provided by the combination between long-lived atomic states and the accessible electrical degrees of freedom in superconducting cavities and qubits. Here we integrate circuit cavity quantum electrodynamics with phonons. Besides coupling to a microwave cavity, our superconducting transmon qubit interacts with a phonon mode in a micromechanical resonator, thus representing an atom coupled to two different cavities. We measure the phonon Stark shift, as well as the splitting of the qubit spectral line into motional sidebands, which feature transitions between the dressed electromechanical states. In the time domain, we observe coherent conversion of qubit excitation to phonons as sideband Rabi oscillations. This is a model system having potential for a quantum interface, which may allow for storage of quantum information in long-lived phonon states, coupling to optical photons, or for investigations of strongly coupled quantum systems near the classical limit."
https://openalex.org/W2040541715,"A set of small organic molecules catalyse reactions of unsaturated organoboron reagents with imines and carbonyls to produce amines and alcohols in high enantiomeric purity efficiently, speedily and at low cost through sustainable protocols. A team from the chemistry department of Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, has designed and synthesized a series of related small organic molecules capable of catalysing enantioselective transformations. Specifically, the molecules — derived from the abundant amino acid valine in a simple four-step process that uses inexpensive reagents — catalyse reactions of unsaturated organoboron reagents with imines and carbonyls. The products of the reactions are enantiomerically pure amines and alcohols that can be used to synthesize more complex, biologically active molecules for applications in chemistry, biology and medicine. The discovery of catalysts that can be used to synthesize complex organic compounds by enantioselective transformations is central to advances in the life sciences1; for this reason, many chemists aim to discover catalysts that allow for preparation of chiral molecules as predominantly one mirror-image isomer2. The ideal catalyst should not contain precious elements3 and should bring reactions to completion in a few hours through operationally simple procedures. Here we introduce a set of small organic molecules that can catalyse reactions of unsaturated organoboron reagents with imines and carbonyls; the products of the reactions are enantiomerically pure amines and alcohols, which might serve as intermediates in the preparation of biologically active molecules. A distinguishing feature of this catalyst class is the presence of a ‘key’ proton embedded within their structure. Catalysts are derived from the abundant amino acid valine and are prepared in large quantities in four steps with inexpensive reagents. Reactions are scalable, do not demand stringent conditions, and can be performed with as little as 0.25 mole per cent catalyst in less than six hours at room temperature to generate products in more than 85 per cent yield and ≥97:3 enantiomeric ratio. The efficiency, selectivity and operational simplicity of the transformations and the range of boron-based reagents are expected to render this advance important for future progress in syntheses of amines and alcohols, which are useful in chemistry, biology and medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2039769468,"Sophisticated genetic tools to modify essential biological processes at the molecular level are pivotal in elucidating the molecular pathogenesis of Clostridium difficile, a major cause of healthcare associated disease. Here we have developed an efficient procedure for making precise alterations to the C. difficile genome by pyrE-based allelic exchange. The robustness and reliability of the method was demonstrated through the creation of in-frame deletions in three genes (spo0A, cwp84, and mtlD) in the non-epidemic strain 630Δerm and two genes (spo0A and cwp84) in the epidemic PCR Ribotype 027 strain, R20291. The system is reliant on the initial creation of a pyrE deletion mutant, using Allele Coupled Exchange (ACE), that is auxotrophic for uracil and resistant to fluoroorotic acid (FOA). This enables the subsequent modification of target genes by allelic exchange using a heterologous pyrE allele from Clostridium sporogenes as a counter-/negative-selection marker in the presence of FOA. Following modification of the target gene, the strain created is rapidly returned to uracil prototrophy using ACE, allowing mutant phenotypes to be characterised in a PyrE proficient background. Crucially, wild-type copies of the inactivated gene may be introduced into the genome using ACE concomitant with correction of the pyrE allele. This allows complementation studies to be undertaken at an appropriate gene dosage, as opposed to the use of multicopy autonomous plasmids. The rapidity of the ‘correction’ method (5–7 days) makes pyrE− strains attractive hosts for mutagenesis studies."
https://openalex.org/W2013063066,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have enabled high-throughput and low-cost generation of sequence data; however, de novo genome assembly remains a great challenge, particularly for large genomes. NGS short reads are often insufficient to create large contigs that span repeat sequences and to facilitate unambiguous assembly. Plant genomes are notorious for containing high quantities of repetitive elements, which combined with huge genome sizes, makes accurate assembly of these large and complex genomes intractable thus far. Using two-color genome mapping of tiling bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) clones on nanochannel arrays, we completed high-confidence assembly of a 2.1-Mb, highly repetitive region in the large and complex genome of Aegilops tauschii, the D-genome donor of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum). Genome mapping is based on direct visualization of sequence motifs on single DNA molecules hundreds of kilobases in length. With the genome map as a scaffold, we anchored unplaced sequence contigs, validated the initial draft assembly, and resolved instances of misassembly, some involving contigs <2 kb long, to dramatically improve the assembly from 75% to 95% complete."
https://openalex.org/W1978215548,"Toxic cyanobacterial blooms threaten freshwaters worldwide but have proven difficult to predict because the mechanisms of bloom formation and toxin production are unknown, especially on weekly time scales. Water quality management continues to focus on aggregated metrics, such as chlorophyll and total nutrients, which may not be sufficient to explain complex community changes and functions such as toxin production. For example, nitrogen (N) speciation and cycling play an important role, on daily time scales, in shaping cyanobacterial communities because declining N has been shown to select for N fixers. In addition, subsequent N pulses from N2 fixation may stimulate and sustain toxic cyanobacterial growth. Herein, we describe how rapid early summer declines in N followed by bursts of N fixation have shaped cyanobacterial communities in a eutrophic lake (Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA), possibly driving toxic Microcystis blooms throughout the growing season. On weekly time scales in 2010 and 2011, we monitored the cyanobacterial community in a eutrophic lake using the phycocyanin intergenic spacer (PC-IGS) region to determine population dynamics. In parallel, we measured microcystin concentrations, N2 fixation rates, and potential environmental drivers that contribute to structuring the community. In both years, cyanobacterial community change was strongly correlated with dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations, and Aphanizomenon and Microcystis alternated dominance throughout the pre-toxic, toxic, and post-toxic phases of the lake. Microcystin concentrations increased a few days after the first significant N2 fixation rates were observed. Then, following large early summer N2 fixation events, Microcystis increased and became most abundant. Maximum microcystin concentrations coincided with Microcystis dominance. In both years, DIN concentrations dropped again in late summer, and N2 fixation rates and Aphanizomenon abundance increased before the lake mixed in the fall. Estimated N inputs from N2 fixation were large enough to supplement, or even support, the toxic Microcystis blooms."
https://openalex.org/W2005120972,"Dental microwear and 3D surface texture analyses are useful in reconstructing herbivore diets, with scratches usually interpreted as indicators of grass dominated diets and pits as indicators of browse. We conducted feeding experiments with four groups of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) each fed a different uniform, pelleted diet (lucerne, lucerne & oats, grass & oats, grass). The lowest silica content was measured in the lucerne and the highest in the grass diet. After 25 weeks of exposure to the diets, dental castings were made of the rabbit's lower molars. Occlusal surfaces were then investigated using dental microwear and 3D areal surface texture analysis. In terms of traditional microwear, we found our hypothesis supported, as the grass group showed a high proportion of (long) “scratches” and the lucerne group a high proportion of “pits”. Regardless of the uniform diets, variability of microwear and surface textures was higher when silica content was low. A high variability in microwear and texture analysis thus need not represent dietary diversity, but can also be related to a uniform, low-abrasion diet. The uniformity or variability of microwear/texture analysis results thus might represent varying degrees of abrasion and attrition rather than a variety of diet items per se."
https://openalex.org/W1995843048,"In microbial ecology, a fundamental question relates to how community diversity and composition change in response to perturbation. Most studies have had limited ability to deeply sample community structure (e.g. Sanger-sequenced 16S rRNA libraries), or have had limited taxonomic resolution (e.g. studies based on 16S rRNA hypervariable region sequencing). Here, we combine the higher taxonomic resolution of near-full-length 16S rRNA gene amplicons with the economics and sensitivity of short-read sequencing to assay the abundance and identity of organisms that represent as little as 0.01% of sediment bacterial communities. We used a new version of EMIRGE optimized for large data size to reconstruct near-full-length 16S rRNA genes from amplicons sheared and sequenced with Illumina technology. The approach allowed us to differentiate the community composition among samples acquired before perturbation, after acetate amendment shifted the predominant metabolism to iron reduction, and once sulfate reduction began. Results were highly reproducible across technical replicates, and identified specific taxa that responded to the perturbation. All samples contain very high alpha diversity and abundant organisms from phyla without cultivated representatives. Surprisingly, at the time points measured, there was no strong loss of evenness, despite the selective pressure of acetate amendment and change in the terminal electron accepting process. However, community membership was altered significantly. The method allows for sensitive, accurate profiling of the ""long tail"" of low abundance organisms that exist in many microbial communities, and can resolve population dynamics in response to environmental change."

https://openalex.org/W2055422589,"Recent evidence suggests that specialized lipid mediators derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids control resolution of inflammation, but little is known about resolution pathways in vascular injury. We sought to determine the actions of D-series resolvin (RvD) on vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotype and vascular injury. Human VSMCs were treated with RvD1 and RvD2, and phenotype was assessed by proliferation, migration, monocyte adhesion, superoxide production, and gene expression assays. A rabbit model of arterial angioplasty with local delivery of RvD2 (10 nM vs. vehicle control) was employed to examine effects on vascular injury in vivo. Local generation of proresolving lipid mediators (LC-MS/MS) and expression of RvD receptors in the vessel wall were assessed. RvD1 and RvD2 produced dose-dependent inhibition of VSMC proliferation, migration, monocyte adhesion, superoxide production, and proinflammatory gene expression (IC50≈0.1-1 nM). In balloon-injured rabbit arteries, cell proliferation (51%) and leukocyte recruitment (41%) were reduced at 3 d, and neointimal hyperplasia was attenuated (29%) at 28 d by RvD2. We demonstrate endogenous biosynthesis of proresolving lipid mediators and expression of receptors for RvD1 in the artery wall. RvDs broadly reduce VSMC responses and modulate vascular injury, suggesting that local activation of resolution mechanisms expedites vascular homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2083618864,"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal disorder of reproductive-age women. Yet the cause of BV has not been established. To uncover key determinants of BV, we employed a multi-omic, systems-biology approach, including both deep 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing and metabolomics of lavage samples from 36 women. These women varied demographically, behaviorally, and in terms of health status and symptoms.16S rRNA gene-based community composition profiles reflected Nugent scores, but not Amsel criteria. In contrast, metabolomic profiles were markedly more concordant with Amsel criteria. Metabolomic profiles revealed two distinct symptomatic BV types (SBVI and SBVII) with similar characteristics that indicated disruption of epithelial integrity, but each type was correlated to the presence of different microbial taxa and metabolites, as well as to different host behaviors. The characteristic odor associated with BV was linked to increases in putrescine and cadaverine, which were both linked to Dialister spp. Additional correlations were seen with the presence of discharge, 2-methyl-2-hydroxybutanoic acid, and Mobiluncus spp., and with pain, diethylene glycol and Gardnerella spp.The results not only provide useful diagnostic biomarkers, but also may ultimately provide much needed insight into the determinants of BV."

https://openalex.org/W1998635195,"Human guanylate-binding protein 1 (hGBP1) is an interferon-inducible protein involved in the host immune response against viral infection. In response to infection by influenza A virus (IAV), hGBP1 transcript and protein were significantly upregulated. Overexpression of hGBP1 inhibited IAV replication in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. The lysine residue at position 51 (K51) of hGBP1 was essential for inhibition of IAV replication. Mutation of K51 resulted in an hGBP1 that was unable to inhibit IAV replication. The viral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) was found to interact directly with hGBP1. K51 of hGBP1 and a region between residues 123 and 144 in NS1 were demonstrated to be essential for the interaction between NS1 and hGBP1. Binding of NS1 to hGBP1 resulted in a significant reduction in both GTPase activity and the anti-IAV activity of hGBP1. These findings indicated that hGBP1 contributed to the host immune response against IAV replication and that hGBP1-mediated antiviral activity was antagonized by NS1 via binding to hGBP1."

https://openalex.org/W2056932102,"Microsporidian strains are usually classified on the basis of their ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences. Although rDNA occurs as multiple copies, in most non-microsporidian species copies within a genome occur as tandem arrays and are homogenised by concerted evolution. In contrast, microsporidian rDNA units are dispersed throughout the genome in some species, and on this basis are predicted to undergo reduced concerted evolution. Furthermore many microsporidian species appear to be asexual and should therefore exhibit reduced genetic diversity due to a lack of recombination. Here, DNA sequences are compared between microsporidia with different life cycles in order to determine the effects of concerted evolution and sexual reproduction upon the diversity of rDNA and protein coding genes. Comparisons of cloned rDNA sequences between microsporidia of the genus Nosema with different life cycles provide evidence of intragenomic variability coupled with strong purifying selection. This suggests a birth and death process of evolution. However, some concerted evolution is suggested by clustering of rDNA sequences within species. Variability of protein-coding sequences indicates that considerable intergenomic variation also occurs between microsporidian cells within a single host. Patterns of variation in microsporidian DNA sequences indicate that additional diversity is generated by intragenomic and/or intergenomic recombination between sequence variants. The discovery of intragenomic variability coupled with strong purifying selection in microsporidian rRNA sequences supports the hypothesis that concerted evolution is reduced when copies of a gene are dispersed rather than repeated tandemly. The presence of intragenomic variability also renders the use of rDNA sequences for barcoding microsporidia questionable. Evidence of recombination in the single-copy genes of putatively asexual microsporidia suggests that these species may undergo cryptic sexual reproduction, a possibility with profound implications for the evolution of virulence, host range and drug resistance in these species."
https://openalex.org/W2012787384,"BRCA1-associated breast cancers are associated with particular features such as early onset, poor histological differentiation, and hormone receptor negativity. Previous studies conducted in Taiwanese population showed that the mutation of BRCA1 gene does not play a significant role in the occurrence of breast cancer. The present study explored methylation of BRCA1 promoter and its relationship to clinical features and outcome in Taiwanese breast cancer patients. Tumor specimens from a cohort of 139 early-stage breast cancer patients were obtained during surgery before adjuvant treatment for DNA extraction. Methylation of BRCA1 promoter region was determined by methylation-specific PCR and the results were related to clinical features and outcome of patients using statistical analysis. Methylation of the BRCA1 promoter was detected in 78 (56%) of the 139 tumors. Chi-square analysis indicated that BRCA1 promoter methylation correlated significantly with triple-negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-) status of breast cancer patients (p = 0.041). The Kaplan-Meier method showed that BRCA1 promoter methylation was significantly associated with poor overall survival (p = 0.026) and disease-free survival (p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis which incorporated variables of patients' age, tumor size, grade, and lymph node metastasis revealed that BRCA1 promoter methylation was associated with overall survival (p = 0.27; hazard ratio, 16.38) and disease-free survival (p = 0.003; hazard ratio, 12.19). Our findings underscore the clinical relevance of the methylation of BRCA1 promoter in Taiwanese patients with early-stage breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2123263344,"R-spondin proteins are adult stem cell growth factors capable of stimulating gut development by activating LGR4, 5, and 6 receptors to promote Wnt signaling. Although multiple Wnt ligands and cognate Frizzled receptors are expressed in the ovary, their physiological roles are unclear. Based on bioinformatic and in situ hybridization analyses, we demonstrated the exclusive expression of R-spondin2 in oocytes of ovarian follicles. In cultured somatic cells from preantral follicles, R-spondin2 treatment (ED50: 3 ng/ml) synergized with Wnt3a to stimulate Wnt signaling. In cultured ovarian explants from prepubertal mice containing preantral follicles, treatment with R-spondin2, similar to follicle stimulating hormone, promoted the development of primary follicles to the secondary stage. In vivo administration of an R-spondin agonist stimulated the development of primary follicles to the antral stage in both immature mice and gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist-treated adult mice. Subsequent treatment with gonadotropins allowed the generation of mature oocytes capable of undergoing early embryonic development and successful pregnancy. Furthermore, R-spondin agonist treatment of immune-deficient mice grafted with human cortical fragments stimulated the development of primary follicles to the secondary stage. Thus, oocyte-derived R-spondin2 is a paracrine factor essential for primary follicle development, and R-spondin agonists could provide a new treatment regimen for infertile women with low responses to the traditional gonadotropin therapy.—Cheng, Y., Kawamura, K., Takae, S., Deguchi, M., Yang, Q., Kuo, C., Hsueh, A.

https://openalex.org/W2138489374,"Strawberry (Fragaria×ananassa) is one of the most important berry crops in the world. Root rot of strawberry caused by Rhizoctonia spp. is a serious threat to commercial strawberry production worldwide. However, there is no information on the genetic diversity and phylogenetic status of Rhizoctonia spp. associated with root rot of strawberry in Australia. To address this, a total of 96 Rhizoctonia spp. isolates recovered from diseased strawberry plants in Western Australia were characterized for their nuclear condition, virulence, genetic diversity and phylogenetic status. All the isolates were found to be binucleate Rhizoctonia (BNR). Sixty-five of the 96 BNR isolates were pathogenic on strawberry, but with wide variation in virulence, with 25 isolates having high virulence. Sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacers of the ribosomal DNA separated the 65 pathogenic BNR isolates into six distinct clades. The sequence analysis also separated reference BNR isolates from strawberry or other crops across the world into clades that correspond to their respective anastomosis group (AG). Some of the pathogenic BNR isolates from this study were embedded in the clades for AG-A, AG-K and AG-I, while other isolates formed clades that were sister to the clades specific for AG-G, AG-B, AG-I and AG-C. There was no significant association between genetic diversity and virulence of these BNR isolates. This study demonstrates that pathogenic BNR isolates associated with root rot of strawberry in Western Australia have wide genetic diversity, and highlights new genetic groups not previously found to be associated with root rot of strawberry in the world (e.g., AG-B) or in Australia (e.g., AG-G). The wide variation in virulence and genetic diversity identified in this study will be of high value for strawberry breeding programs in selecting, developing and deploying new cultivars with resistance to these multi-genetic groups of BNR."

Our results, based on demographic and osteometric data, indicate that full domestication of both cattle and suids occurred at the site during the 8(th) millennium. Importantly, domestication was preceded in both taxa by demographic and metric population parameters indicating severe overhunting. The possible role of overhunting in shaping the characteristics of domesticated animals and the social infrastructure to ownership of herds is then explored."
https://openalex.org/W2145559038,"Smooth muscle contractility and neuronal excitability are regulated by large conductance, Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BKCa) channels, the activity of which can be increased after modulation by type I cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGKI) via nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP signaling. Our study focused on identifying key phosphorylation sites within the BKCa channel underlying functional enhancement of channel activity by cGKI. BKCa channel phosphorylation by cGKIα was characterized biochemically using radiolabeled ATP, and regulation of channel activity by NO/cGMP signaling was quantified in rat aortic A7r5 smooth muscle cells by cell-attached patch-clamp recording. Serine to alanine substitutions at 3 of 6 putative cGKI phosphorylation sites (Ser691, Ser873, and Ser1112) in the BKCa α subunit individually reduced direct channel phosphorylation by 25-60% and blocked BKCa activation by either an NO donor or a membrane-permeable cGMP by 80-100%. Acute inhibition of cGKI prevented stimulus-evoked enhancement of BKCa channel activity. Our data further suggest that augmentation of BKCa activity by NO/cGMP/cGKI signaling requires phosphorylation at all 3 sites and is independent of elevations in [Ca(2+)]i. Phosphorylation of 3 specific Ser residues within the murine BKCa α subunit by cGKIα accounts for the enhanced BKCa channel activity induced by elevated [cGMP]i in situ."
https://openalex.org/W2064378282,"Climate change and ocean acidification will expose marine organisms to synchronous multiple stressors, with early life stages being potentially most vulnerable to changing environmental conditions. We simultaneously exposed encapsulated molluscan embryos to three abiotic stressors-acidified conditions, elevated temperate, and solar UV radiation in large outdoor water tables in a multifactorial design. Solar UV radiation was modified with plastic filters, while levels of the other factors reflected IPCC predictions for near-future change. We quantified mortality and the rate of embryonic development for a mid-shore littorinid, Bembicium nanum, and low-shore opisthobranch, Dolabrifera brazieri. Outcomes were consistent for these model species with embryos faring significantly better at 26°C than 22°C. Mortality sharply increased at the lowest temperature (22°C) and lowest pH (7.6) examined, producing a significant interaction. Under these conditions mortality approached 100% for each species, representing a 2- to 4-fold increase in mortality relative to warm (26°C) non-acidified conditions. Predictably, development was more rapid at the highest temperature but this again interacted with acidified conditions. Development was slowed under acidified conditions at the lowest temperature. The presence of UV radiation had minimal impact on the outcomes, only slowing development for the littorinid and not interacting with the other factors. Our findings suggest that a warming ocean, at least to a threshold, may compensate for the effects of decreasing pH for some species. It also appears that stressors will interact in complex and unpredictable ways in a changing climate."

In this study, we manipulated two critical perceptual features that contribute to determining the significance of others' emotional expressions: the direction of attention (toward or away from the observer) and the intensity of the emotional display. Electromyographic activity over the corrugator muscle was recorded while participants observed videos of neutral to angry body expressions. Self-directed bodies induced greater corrugator activity than other-directed bodies; additionally corrugator activity was only influenced by the intensity of anger expresssed by self-directed bodies. These data support the hypothesis that rapid facial reactions are the outcome of self-relevant emotional processing."
https://openalex.org/W2004432705,"Composts are the products obtained after the aerobic degradation of different types of organic matter waste and can be used as substrates or substrate/soil amendments for plant cultivation. There is a small but increasing number of reports that suggest that foliar diseases may be reduced when using compost, rather than standard substrates, as growing medium. The purpose of this study was to examine the gene expression alteration produced by the compost to gain knowledge of the mechanisms involved in compost-induced systemic resistance. A compost from olive marc and olive tree leaves was able to induce resistance against Botrytis cinerea in Arabidopsis, unlike the standard substrate, perlite. Microarray analyses revealed that 178 genes were differently expressed, with a fold change cut-off of 1, of which 155 were up-regulated and 23 were down-regulated in compost-grown, as against perlite-grown plants. A functional enrichment study of up-regulated genes revealed that 38 Gene Ontology terms were significantly enriched. Response to stress, biotic stimulus, other organism, bacterium, fungus, chemical and abiotic stimulus, SA and ABA stimulus, oxidative stress, water, temperature and cold were significantly enriched, as were immune and defense responses, systemic acquired resistance, secondary metabolic process and oxireductase activity. Interestingly, PR1 expression, which was equally enhanced by growing the plants in compost and by B. cinerea inoculation, was further boosted in compost-grown pathogen-inoculated plants. Compost triggered a plant response that shares similarities with both systemic acquired resistance and ABA-dependent/independent abiotic stress responses."

We assessed the use of tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)/β-catenin (CTNNB1) genes to predict outcomes in patients with colorectal cancer. We selected and genotyped 10 tSNP to predict common variants across entire APC and CTNNB1 genes in 282 colorectal cancer patients. The associations of these tSNPs with distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox regression model, and survival tree analysis. The 5-year overall survival rate was 68.3%. Survival tree analysis identified a higher-order genetic interaction profile consisting of the APC rs565453, CTNNB1 2293303, and APC rs1816769 that was significantly associated with overall survival. The 5-year survival overall rates were 89.2%, 66.1%, and 58.8% for the low-, medium-, and high-risk genetic profiles, respectively (log-rank P = 0.001). After adjusting for possible confounders, including age, gender, carcinoembryonic antigen levels, tumor differentiation, stage, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, and lymph node involvement, the genetic interaction profile remained significant. None of the studied SNPs were individually associated with distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival. Our results suggest that the genetic interaction profile among Wnt pathway SNPs might potentially increase the prognostic value in outcome prediction for colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2095856204,"Period1 (PER1) is an important core clock gene, which regulates normal cell proliferations and physiological rhythms of human beings. Recent studies have showed aberrant expressions and altered rhythms of PER1 were highly correlated to the carcinogenesis and development of malignant tumors. However, there is no study on the correlation of aberrant expressions and altered rhythms of PER1 with the growth, proliferation and metastasis of buccal squamous cell carcinoma (BSCC). In this study, PER1 and MMP-2 expression in the cancerous and adjacent noncancerous tissues of 38 patients with BSCC and its correlations with patients' clinical pathologic characteristics were investigated. A mouse model of BSCC was also established and mice were sacrificed at 4 different time points in a period of 24 hours. Xenografted tumor weight, proliferation index (PI), and mitotic index (MI) of tumors in the 4 time groups were detected. Results showed that PER1 expression was significantly down-regulated in cancerous tissues of patients with BSCC (P<0.05). PER1 expression was significantly down-regulated in patients of T3∼T4 staging and those with lymph node metastasis compared to that of T1∼T2 staging and those without lymph node metastasis (P<0.05), respectively. PER1 mRNA expression, MI and tumor weight had significant differences among the 4 time groups, which PI all confirmed to circadian rhythms. MI, PI, MMP-2 mRNA and tumor weight had negative correlation with PER1 mRNA expression. Peak value of PER1 mRNA expression and trough values of MI, PI and tumor weight all appeared in middle activity phase, whereas trough value of PER1 mRNA expression and peak values of MI, PI and tumor weight all occurred in middle rest phase. Our study suggested that aberrant expression of PER1 had significant correlation with the growth, proliferation and metastasis of BSCC and it might act as an anti-oncogene."
https://openalex.org/W2162839002,"Persistent pruritus is a common disabling dermatologic symptom associated with different etiologic factors. These include primary skin conditions, as well as neuropathic, psychogenic, or systemic disorders like chronic liver disease. Defective clearance of potential pruritogenic substances that activate itch-specific neurons innervating the skin is thought to contribute to cholestatic pruritus. However, because the underlying disease-specific pruritogens and itch-specific neuronal pathways and mechanism(s) are unknown, symptomatic therapeutic intervention often leads to no or only limited success. In the current study, we aimed to first validate rats with bile duct ligation (BDL) as a model for hepatic pruritus and then to evaluate the contribution of inflammation, peripheral neuronal sensitization, and specific signaling pathways and subpopulations of itch-responsive neurons to scratching behavior and thermal hypersensitivity. Chronic BDL rats displayed enhanced scratching behavior and thermal hyperalgesia indicative of peripheral neuroinflammation. BDL-induced itch and hypersensitivity involved a minor contribution of histaminergic/serotonergic receptors, but significant activation of protein-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) receptors, prostaglandin PGE2 formation, and potentiation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel activity. The sensitization of dorsal root ganglion nociceptors in BDL rats was associated with increased surface expression of PAR2 and TRPV1 proteins and an increase in the number of PAR2- and TRPV1-expressing peptidergic neurons together with a shift of TRPV1 receptor expression to medium sized dorsal root ganglion neurons. These results suggest that pruritus and hyperalgesia in chronic cholestatic BDL rats are associated with neuroinflammation and involve PAR2-induced TRPV1 sensitization. Thus, pharmacological modulation of PAR2 and/or TRPV1 may be a valuable therapeutic approach for patients with chronic liver pruritus refractory to conventional treatments. Persistent pruritus is a common disabling dermatologic symptom associated with different etiologic factors. These include primary skin conditions, as well as neuropathic, psychogenic, or systemic disorders like chronic liver disease. Defective clearance of potential pruritogenic substances that activate itch-specific neurons innervating the skin is thought to contribute to cholestatic pruritus. However, because the underlying disease-specific pruritogens and itch-specific neuronal pathways and mechanism(s) are unknown, symptomatic therapeutic intervention often leads to no or only limited success. In the current study, we aimed to first validate rats with bile duct ligation (BDL) as a model for hepatic pruritus and then to evaluate the contribution of inflammation, peripheral neuronal sensitization, and specific signaling pathways and subpopulations of itch-responsive neurons to scratching behavior and thermal hypersensitivity. Chronic BDL rats displayed enhanced scratching behavior and thermal hyperalgesia indicative of peripheral neuroinflammation. BDL-induced itch and hypersensitivity involved a minor contribution of histaminergic/serotonergic receptors, but significant activation of protein-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) receptors, prostaglandin PGE2 formation, and potentiation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel activity. The sensitization of dorsal root ganglion nociceptors in BDL rats was associated with increased surface expression of PAR2 and TRPV1 proteins and an increase in the number of PAR2- and TRPV1-expressing peptidergic neurons together with a shift of TRPV1 receptor expression to medium sized dorsal root ganglion neurons. These results suggest that pruritus and hyperalgesia in chronic cholestatic BDL rats are associated with neuroinflammation and involve PAR2-induced TRPV1 sensitization. Thus, pharmacological modulation of PAR2 and/or TRPV1 may be a valuable therapeutic approach for patients with chronic liver pruritus refractory to conventional treatments. Chronic pruritus is a common, seriously debilitating symptom that can arise from dermatologic disorders, but often also appears in other disease states as a secondary symptom (1Weisshaar E. Kucenic M.J. Fleischer Jr., A.B. Pruritus: a review.Acta Derm. Venereol. Suppl. 2003; 213: 5-32Google Scholar). For instance, chronic itch has been associated with a wide variety of pathologies such as malignancy, or hematologic, infectious, neuropsychiatric, metabolic, and systemic disorders. Patients with end-stage renal and hepatic diseases often present with pruritus that might result from diminished renal or hepatic clearance of pruritogenic substances. The origin of hepatic pruritus remains poorly understood. The pathological accumulation of specific pruritogens is thought to directly or indirectly activate unmyelinated C-fibers that innervate the skin (2Imamachi N. Park G.H. Lee H. Anderson D.J. Simon M.I. Basbaum A.I. Han S.K. TRPV1-expressing primary afferents generate behavioral responses to pruritogens via multiple mechanisms.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, both the identity of disease-specific pruritogen(s) and the neuronal pathways and mechanism(s) involved in pruritus are highly controversial. For instance, although bile salts and other cholephiles are traditionally assumed to be major pruritogens, no correlation exists between pruritus intensity and either serum biomarkers for cholestasis or with the course of the disease (1Weisshaar E. Kucenic M.J. Fleischer Jr., A.B. Pruritus: a review.Acta Derm. Venereol. Suppl. 2003; 213: 5-32Google Scholar, 4Bergasa N.V. Mehlman J.K. Jones E.A.

It is widely accepted that other substances like the well known pruritogens histamine and serotonin (5-HT), 2The abbreviations used are: 5-HTserotoninAPalkaline phosphataseBDLbile duct ligationCGRPcalcitonin gene-related peptideDRGdorsal root ganglionIB4isolectin B4NF200neurofilament 200 kDaLPAlysophosphatidic acidPAR2protease-activated receptor 2PGE2prostaglandin E2PWLpaw withdrawal latencySSBspontaneous scratching boutTRPV1transient receptor potential vanilloid 1. which are released from mast cells, or endogenous opioids, which are liberated from immune cells, may accumulate in hepatic pruritus and activate sensory neurons (5Nelson L.

Whereas 5-HT and opioid receptor antagonists have therapeutic potential in a subset of cholestasis patients, antihistaminics have proven ineffective (7Glasova H. Beuers U.

TRPV1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1) is a polymodal receptor channel that conducts cations (preferentially Ca2+) in response to either the irritant compound capsaicin or to extracellular acidic pH and to noxiously high temperatures (≥43 °C). Pharmacological and genetic abrogation of TRPV1 function in rodents significantly reduces pain in acute and chronic inflammatory animal models (17García-Martinez C. Humet M. Planells-Cases R.

The vanilloid receptor: a molecular gateway to the pain pathway.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). Whereas TRPV1 channel activity is low under normal conditions, mediators released from injured cells and activated immune cells during inflammation potentiate TRPV1 activity through activation of G protein-coupled receptors, thereby leading to sensitization of nociceptive neurons (19Planells-Cases R.

Binding of pruritogens to their receptors, whose identity is often unclear, can trigger distinct and specific intracellular signaling pathways that can activate and potentiate TRPV1 function (2Imamachi N.

Hence, TRPV1 may be a common downstream effector in the itch signaling pathway. Indeed, most noxious stimuli can produce pain and/or itch, depending on how and where they are applied (23Ross S.E. Pain and itch: insights into the neural circuits of aversive somatosensation in health and disease.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2011; 21: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).

Nevertheless, our understanding of the mechanisms involved in pruritus signaling by TRPV1-expressing neurons remains limited. To our knowledge, no previous study has addressed the neuronal mechanism(s) underlying pruritus associated with cholestatic liver disease, a dynamic and complex condition leading to inflammation, liver fibrosis, and eventually cirrhosis. We hypothesized that a Wistar rat model with chronic bile duct ligation (BDL) (16Jover R. Rodrigo R. Felipo V. Insausti R. Sáez-Valero J. García-Ayllón M.S. Suárez I. Candela A. Compañ A. Esteban A.

We investigated the involvement of specific pathways and subpopulations of itch-responsive neurons by pharmacological intervention with selective antagonists and by immunohistochemistry. In particular, because neurogenic inflammation in chronic BDL rats (16Jover R. Rodrigo R. Felipo V. Insausti R. Sáez-Valero J. García-Ayllón M.S. Suárez I. Candela A. Compañ A. Esteban A. Cauli O.

Here, we show that Wistar BDL rats exhibit augmented scratching accompanied by peripheral sensitization of primary afferents as revealed by thermal hyperalgesia. Both symptoms showed an early onset that correlated with an increase in both serum biomarkers for cholestasis and proinflammatory cytokines. Whereas histamine/serotonin pathways only play a minor role in the scratching and thermal hyperalgesia phenotype of our rat model, our results demonstrate an involvement of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) activation, peripheral inflammation, and TRPV1 potentiation. Hence targeting the recruitment or modulation of PAR2 or TRPV1 may be useful therapeutic strategies to treat chronic itch and neuroinflammation in liver disease patients. Male Wistar rats (200–250 g) were obtained from Charles River, France. Experimental procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee and met European Union guidelines for care and management of experimental animals. BDL rats were operated on as described (16Jover R.

Control rats were sham-operated. Behavioral studies started 48 h after surgery and only when no signs of pain or distress were apparent. Pharmacological treatments began 3 weeks after surgery. The contribution of different signaling pathways was assessed by subcutaneous administration of cyproheptadine (20 mg/kg) (28Costa R. Marotta D.M. Manjavachi M.N. Fernandes E.S. Lima-Garcia J.F.

Drugs were prepared immediately before use in 0.9% NaCl from a stock solution. Control groups received the corresponding vehicle. Cyproheptadine, protease, and opioid antagonists were administered 30 min, and other drugs 60 min, before behavioral tests. All drugs were from Sigma unless otherwise stated. PAR2 agonist (PAR2-AP), a negative retropeptide control (PAR2-RP), and FSLLRY-NH2 (PAR2-Antg) were from Bachem. Meloxicam (Metacam®) was from Roche Applied Science, gabexate mesylate was from Tocris (Bristol, UK), and palmitoylated DD04107 and the scrambled control lipopeptide were synthesized by DiverDrugs (Gavà, Spain). Primary antibodies used were anti-α-CGRP (Novus, Littleton, CO), anti-PAR2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-TRPV1 (Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel), and NF200 and monoclonal anti-β-actin (Sigma). Secondary antibodies were from Jackson (West Grove, PA). Rats were acclimatized in a measuring cage for 30 min, followed by videotaping of scratching behavior for 30 min or 1 h. Spontaneous scratching was quantified by counting the number of scratches of any region of the body performed by forepaws or hindpaws. For Hargreaves' Plantar Test a standard apparatus (Ugo Basile, Italy) was used that automatically measured the paw withdrawal latency (PWL) to a thermal radiant stimulus (30Hargreaves K. Dubner R. Brown F. Flores C. Joris J. A new and sensitive method for measuring thermal nociception in cutaneous hyperalgesia.Pain. 1988; 32: 77-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4300) Google Scholar). To avoid tissue injury in refractory animals, stimulation was automatically terminated after 32 s. PWL was determined before and after drug or vehicle treatment in BDL and sham control rats. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. with a minimum of six animals/group. Serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (AP), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and glutamic pyruvic transaminase were determined by standard techniques and prostaglandin PGE2 by ELISA (GE Healthcare). Primary adult sham and BDL DRG cultures were established as described (24Liu Q. Weng H.J. Patel K.N. Tang Z. Bai H. Steinhoff M. Dong X. The distinct roles of two GPCRs, MrgprC11 and PAR2, in itch and hyperalgesia.Sci. Signal. 2011; 4: ra45Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were performed after ∼12 h in vitro in paired BDL and sham DRG cultures as in Ref. 31Lainez S. Valente P. Ontoria-Oviedo I. Estévez-Herrera J. Camprubí-Robles M. Ferrer-Montiel A. Planells-Cases R.

To investigate PAR2 modulation of TRPV1 activity, cells were exposed for 5 min to PAR2 agonist (AP), antagonist (Antg), or vehicle, followed by a 10-s pulse with 100 nm capsaicin (32Amadesi S. Cottrell G.S. Divino L. Chapman K. Grady E.F. Bautista F. Karanjia R. Barajas-Lopez C. Vanner S. Vergnolle N. Bunnett N.W.

Dissociated DRG neurons from sham- and BDL-operated rats were surface biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) and processed as described (33Sanz-Salvador L. Andrés-Borderia A. Ferrer-Montiel A. Planells-Cases R. Agonist- and Ca2+-dependent desensitization of TRPV1 channel targets the receptor to lysosomes for degradation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 19462-19471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Biotinylated proteins were isolated with streptavidin-agarose, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and detected with the following antibodies and dilutions: TRPV1 (1:1000), PAR2 (1:100), and β-actin (1:200). Immunoblots were digitized and quantified. The absence of contaminating intracellular proteins in membrane fractions was verified by labeling of actin. Rats were overanesthetized and then transcardially perfused with saline and then with 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4). DRGs were quickly removed, postfixed, and then placed in sucrose solution. 8-μm sections were co-incubated with anti-TRPV1 (1:1000) and FITC-isolectin B4 (IB4) (1:50) or one of the following antibodies: anti-NF200 (1:1000), anti-α-CGRP (1:300), anti-GRP (1:500), or anti-PAR2 (1:100) overnight at 4 °C. Cy3- or Alexa Fluor 488-tagged secondary antibodies were used in 1:200 dilutions for 1 h at 22 °C. Sections were then washed three times for 10 min in PBS and mounted. Controls for double-labeling experiments included imaging with both green and red filters in the presence of only one primary antibody and/or by omission of all primary antibodies. Settings for each channel were initially adjusted to avoid bleeding through. Images were taken on a Leica DM5000B epifluorescence microscope fitted with a digital camera. When comparing different samples, identical settings were used. The areas of TRPV1-positive (TRPV1+) neurons and DRG neuronal markers were analyzed by tracing the soma perimeter on a computer screen in a calibrated image and using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Calculated areas were plotted against the percentage of total TRPV1+ neurons. More than five sections per animal, three pairs of rats, and >1000 total neurons per phenotype were analyzed. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-test was used for paired comparisons. Between groups, one-way ANOVA was followed by Tukey's test. Differences were considered significant when *p ≤ 0.1, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001. Additional methods and materials are described in supplemental Experimental Procedures. We evaluated whether spontaneous scratching behavior was increased in Wistar BDL rats, an animal model that leads to jaundice, inflammation, and cirrhosis (16Jover R. Rodrigo R. Felipo V. Insausti R.

Cumulative spontaneous scratching bouts (SSBs) during 1-h observation periods were recorded in BDL- and sham-operated animals at different time points. As shown in Fig. 1A, BDL rats exhibited a significant (≈2-fold) elevation in the number of SSBs (SSB = 59 ± 4, n = 12, in BDL compared with 39 ± 4, n = 8, in sham rats) 48 h after surgery, a behavior that persisted for at least 3 months. Cholestasis was evident from increased serum bilirubin and AP levels, as well as from elevated levels of hepatic injury markers glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (Table 1).

Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody against EGFR, has been successful at prolonging survival but has only a 10% tumor shrinkage response rate in a clinical setting. The goal of this study was to compare dacomitinib (PF-00299804), a next generation small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that irreversibly blocks multiple HER family receptors (HER-1 (EGFR), HER-2 and HER-4 tyrosine kinases), to cetuximab, the current FDA approved anti-EGFR medication for HNSCC and erlotinib, an EGFR specific small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Dacomitinib, erlotinib and cetuximab were tested in a panel of 27 HNSCC cell lines. Treatment with 100 ug/ml of cetuximab or 1 uM of erlotinib inhibited growth by at least 50% in 7/27 cell lines, while treatment with 1 uM of dacomitinib had similar growth inhibition in 17/27 lines. Cell lines representing three levels of sensitivity to dacomitinib were further examined using Western blots, cell cycle and apoptosis analysis. Treatment with 100 nM of dacomitinib reduced EGFR activity and downstream AKT and ERK pathways more effectively than treatment with 100 ug/ml of cetuximab in all ten tested lines. Although both compounds induced apoptosis at similar levels, dacomitinib caused greater G0/G1 arrest. Sensitivity to EGFR blockade was associated with levels of EGFR and ERK and was not associated with common oncogenic mutations and copy number variations. Phosphorylated and total EGFR and ERK levels correlate with sensitivity to both cetuximab and dacomitinib. Three of the four lines in the exquisitely sensitive group had the highest levels of phosphorylated and total EGFR and ERK among the ten lines selected, while the three resistant lines collectively had the lowest levels. Neither pAKT nor tAKT was associated with sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2142710986,"Gene therapeutic strategies have shown promise in treating vascular disease. However, their translation into clinical use requires pharmaceutical carriers enabling effective, site-specific delivery as well as providing sustained transgene expression in blood vessels. While replication-deficient adenovirus (Ad) offers several important advantages as a vector for vascular gene therapy, its clinical applicability is limited by rapid inactivation, suboptimal transduction efficiency in vascular cells, and serious systemic adverse effects. We hypothesized that novel zinc oleate-based magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) loaded with Ad would enable effective arterial cell transduction by shifting vector processing to an alternative pathway, protect Ad from inactivation by neutralizing factors, and allow site-specific gene transfer to arteries treated with stent angioplasty using a 2-source magnetic guidance strategy. Ad-loaded MNPs effectively transduced cultured endothelial and smooth muscle cells under magnetic conditions compared to controls and retained capacity for gene transfer after exposure to neutralizing antibodies and lithium iodide, a lytic agent causing disruption of free Ad. Localized arterial gene expression significantly stronger than in control animal groups was demonstrated after magnetically guided MNP delivery in a rat stenting model 2 and 9 d post-treatment, confirming feasibility of using Ad-loaded MNPs to achieve site-specific transduction in stented blood vessels. In conclusion, Ad-loaded MNPs formed by controlled precipitation of zinc oleate represent a novel delivery system, well-suited for efficient, magnetically targeted vascular gene transfer.—Chorny, M., Fishbein, I., Tengood, J.

https://openalex.org/W1970279120,"Ets-1 is a transcription factor that regulates many genes involved in cancer progression and in tumour invasion. It is a poor prognostic marker for breast, lung, colorectal and ovary carcinomas. Here, we identified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) as a novel interaction partner of Ets-1. We show that Ets-1 activates, by direct interaction, the catalytic activity of PARP-1 and is then poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated in a DNA-independent manner. The catalytic inhibition of PARP-1 enhanced Ets-1 transcriptional activity and caused its massive accumulation in cell nuclei. Ets-1 expression was correlated with an increase in DNA damage when PARP-1 was inhibited, leading to cancer cell death. Moreover, PARP-1 inhibitors caused only Ets-1-expressing cells to accumulate DNA damage. These results provide new insight into Ets-1 regulation in cancer cells and its link with DNA repair proteins. Furthermore, our findings suggest that PARP-1 inhibitors would be useful in a new therapeutic strategy that specifically targets Ets-1-expressing tumours."
https://openalex.org/W1969240604,"Natural extracts have played an important role in the prevention and treatment of diseases and are important sources for drug discovery. However, to be effectively used in these processes, natural extracts must be characterized through the identification of their active compounds and their modes of action.From an initial set of 29,779 natural products that are annotated with their natural source and using a previously developed virtual screening procedure (carefully validated experimentally), we have predicted as potential peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) partial agonists 12 molecules from 11 extracts known to have antidiabetic activity. Six of these molecules are similar to molecules with described antidiabetic activity but whose mechanism of action is unknown. Therefore, it is plausible that these 12 molecules could be the bioactive molecules responsible, at least in part, for the antidiabetic activity of the extracts containing them. In addition, we have also identified as potential PPARγ partial agonists 10 molecules from 16 plants with undescribed antidiabetic activity but that are related (i.e., they are from the same genus) to plants with known antidiabetic properties. None of the 22 molecules that we predict as PPARγ partial agonists show chemical similarity with a group of 211 known PPARγ partial agonists obtained from the literature.Our results provide a new hypothesis about the active molecules of natural extracts with antidiabetic properties and their mode of action. We also suggest plants with undescribed antidiabetic activity that may contain PPARγ partial agonists. These plants represent a new source of potential antidiabetic extracts. Consequently, our work opens the door to the discovery of new antidiabetic extracts and molecules that can be of use, for instance, in the design of new antidiabetic drugs or functional foods focused towards the prevention/treatment of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W1978076591,"Proper retinal cell differentiation is essential for establishing a functional retina. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of early growth response 1 (egr1), a transcription factor (TF) that has been reported to control eye development and function, on retinal differentiation in zebrafish. Specifically, cellular changes in the Egr1-knockdown retinas were characterized by immunohistochemistry at 72 and 120 hours post-fertilization (hpf). The results indicate that Egr1 knockdown specifically suppressed the differentiation of subtypes of amacrine cells (ACs) and horizontal cells (HCs), including Parvalbumin- and GABA-positive ACs as well as Islet1-positive HCs. In addition, the knockdown induced a general delay of development of the other retinal cell types. These differentiation problems, particularly the ones with the ACs and HCs, also compromised the integrity of the inner and outer plexiform layers. In the Egr1-knockdown retinas, the expression of ptf1a, a TF that controls the specification of ACs and HCs, was prolonged and found in ectopic locations in the retina up to 72 hpf. Then, it became restricted to the proliferative marginal zone as in the control retinas at 120 hpf. This abnormal and prolonged expression of ptf1a during retinogenesis might affect the differentiation of ACs and HCs in the Egr1-knockdown retinas."
https://openalex.org/W2004677314,"Angiogenesis is an essential process for normal skeletal muscle function. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a potent antiangiogenic protein in tumorigenesis, is an important regulator of both physiological and pathological skeletal muscle angiogenesis. We tested the hypothesis that chronic exposure to a TSP-1 mimetic (ABT-510), which targets the CD36 TSP-1 receptor, would decrease skeletal muscle capillarity as well as alter the balance between positive and negative angiogenic proteins under basal conditions. Osmotic minipumps with either ABT-510 or vehicle (5% dextrose) were implanted subcutaneously in the subscapular region of C57/BL6 mice for 14 days. When compared to the vehicle treated mice, the ABT-510 group had a 20% decrease in capillarity in the superficial region of the gastrocnemius (GA), 11% decrease in the plantaris (PLT), and a 35% decrease in the soleus (SOL). ABT-510 also decreased muscle protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in both the GA (−140%) and SOL (−62%); however there was no change in VEGF in the PLT. Serum VEGF was not altered in ABT-510 treated animals. Endogenous TSP-1 protein expression in all muscles remained unaltered. Tunnel staining revealed no difference in muscle apoptosis between ABT-510 and vehicle treated groups. These data provide evidence that the anti-angiogenic effects of TSP-1 are mediated, at least in part, via the CD36 receptor. It also suggests that under physiologic conditions the TSP-1/CD36 axis plays a role in regulating basal skeletal muscle microvessel density."
https://openalex.org/W2022445378,"Aims Body mass index (BMI) shows several limitations as indicator of fatness. Using the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) reference and the World Health Organization (WHO) standard 2007 on the same dataset yielded widely different rates. At higher levels, BMI and the BMI cut-offs may be help in informing a clinical judgement, but at levels near the norm additional criteria may be needed. This study compares the prevalence of overweight and obesity using IOTF and WHO-2007 references and interprets body composition by comparing measures of BMI and body fatness (fat mass index, FMI; and waist-to-height ratio, WHtR) among an adolescent population. Methods and Results A random sample (n = 1231) of adolescent population (12–17 years old) was interviewed. Weight, height, waist circumference, triceps and subscapular skinfolds were used to calculate BMI, FMI, and WHtR. The prevalence of overweight and obesity were 12.3% and 15.4% (WHO standards) and 18.6% and 6.1% (IOTF definition). Despite that IOTF cut-offs misclassified less often than WHO standards, BMI categories were combined with FMI and WHtR resulting in the Adiposity & Fat Distribution for adolescents (AFAD-A) classification, which identified the following groups normal-weight normal-fat (73.2%), normal-weight overfat (2.1%), overweight normal-fat (6.7%), overweight overfat (11.9%) and obesity (6.1%), and also classified overweight at risk and obese adolescents into type-I (9.5% and 1.3%, respectively) and type-II (2.3% and 4.9%, respectively) depending if they had or not abdominal fatness. Conclusions There are differences between IOTF and WHO-2007 international references and there is a misclassification when adiposity is considered. The BMI limitations, especially for overweight identification, could be reduced by adding an estimate of both adiposity (FMI) and fat distribution (WHtR). The AFAD-A classification could be useful in clinical and population health to identify overfat adolescent and those who have greater risk of developing weight-related cardiovascular diseases according to the BMI category."

https://openalex.org/W1964151467,"The digital laminae is a two layer tissue that attaches the distal phalanx to the inner hoof wall, thus suspending the horse's axial skeleton in the hoof capsule. This tissue fails at the epidermal:dermal junction in laminitic horses, causing crippling disease. Basal epithelial cells line the laminar epidermal:dermal junction, undergo physiological change in laminitic horses, and lose versican gene expression. Versican gene expression is purportedly under control of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and is a trigger for mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition; thus, its repression in laminar epithelial cells of laminitic horses may be associated with suppression of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and loss of the epithelial cell phenotype. In support of the former contention, we show, using laminae from healthy horses and horses with carbohydrate overload-induced laminitis, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting after sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunofluorescent tissue staining, that positive and negative regulatory components of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway are expressed in laminar basal epithelial cells of healthy horses. Furthermore, expression of positive regulators is suppressed and negative regulators elevated in laminae of laminitic compared to healthy horses. We also show that versican gene expression in the epithelial cells correlates positively with that of β-catenin and T-cell Factor 4, consistent with regulation by the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. In addition, gene and protein expression of β-catenin correlates positively with that of integrin β4 and both are strongly suppressed in laminar basal epithelial cells of laminitic horses, which remain E-cadherin+/vimentin−, excluding mesenchymal transition as contributing to loss of the adherens junction and hemidesmosome components. We propose that suppression of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, and accompanying reduced expression of β catenin and integrin β4 in laminar basal epithelial cells reduces cell:cell and cell:basement membrane attachment, thus, destabilizing the laminar epidermal:dermal junction."

General characteristics and similarities among their diets were evaluated by considering high taxonomic ranks of all prey groups, and also the lower taxonomic ranks of the main prey groups. Dietary similarity was relatively high among species and low between seasons, and both evaluation criteria gave the equivalent results.

https://openalex.org/W2003642829,"Interneurons in the olfactory bulb are key elements of odor processing but their roles have not yet being fully understood. Two types of inhibitory interneurons, periglomerular and granule cells, act at two different levels within the olfactory bulb and may have different roles in coordinating the spiking of mitral cells, which are the principal output neurons of the olfactory bulb. In this work we introduce a reduced compartmental model of the periglomerular cell and use it to investigate its role on mitral cell spiking in a model of an elementary cell triad composed of these two cell types plus a granule cell. Our simulation results show that the periglomerular cell is more effective in inhibiting the mitral cell than the granule cell. Based on our results we predict that periglomerular and granule cells have different roles in the control of mitral cell spiking. The periglomerular cell would be the only one capable of completely inhibiting the mitral cell, and the activity decrease of the mitral cell through this inhibitory action would occur in a stepwise fashion depending on parameters of the periglomerular and granule cells as well as on the relative times of arrival of external stimuli to the three cells. The major role of the granule cell would be to facilitate the inhibitory action of the periglomerular cell by enlarging the range of parameters of the periglomerular cell which correspond to complete inhibition of the mitral cell. The combined action of the two interneurons would thus provide an efficient way of controling the instantaneous value of the firing rate of the mitral cell."
https://openalex.org/W2156339533,"Cancer and stem cells share the ability to silence tumor suppressors. We focused on Lefty, which encodes one of the most abundant tumor suppressors in embryonic stem (ES) cells and is not expressed in somatic cancer cells. We found that transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) induced demethylation of the Lefty B cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) island and increased Lefty expression (10–200 times) in human pancreatic cancer cells and human liver cancer cells (PLC/PRF/5 and HLF). Expression of Cripto, another important factor in Nodal-Lefty signaling, was not increased after adding TGF-β. We generated reprogrammed cancer cells that revealed high expression of immature marker proteins, high proliferation, and the potential to express morphological patterns of ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm, suggesting that these cells may have cancer stem cell-like phenotypes. We investigated Lefty and found that reprogrammed human liver cancer cells (induced pluripotent cancer cells) displayed a much lower ability to express Lefty, although less Lefty B CpG methylation was also observed. We also found that a MEK inhibitor dramatically enhanced Lefty expression in human pancreatic cancers with mutated ras, whereas Lefty B CpG methylation was not decreased. These observations indicate that despite the demethylation of DNA strands in promoter regions of pluripotency-associated genes, including Lefty gene, Lefty expression was not induced well in reprogrammed cells. Of note was the fact that Lefty is abundantly expressed in human ES cells but not in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. We thus think that reprogrammed cancer cells share the mechanism for expression of Lefty with iPS cells. This shared mechanism may contribute to the cancerous transformation of iPS cells.—Saito, A., Ochiai, H., Okada, S., Miyata, N., Azuma, T.

https://openalex.org/W2069443586,"Genomic instability stemming from dysregulation of cell cycle checkpoints and DNA damage response (DDR) is a common feature of many cancers. The cancer adult T cell leukemia (ATL) can occur in individuals infected with human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), and ATL cells contain extensive chromosomal abnormalities, suggesting that they have defects in the recognition or repair of DNA damage. Since Tax is the transforming protein encoded by HTLV-1, we asked whether Tax can affect cell cycle checkpoints and the DDR. Using a combination of flow cytometry and DNA repair assays we showed that Tax-expressing cells exit G1 phase and initiate DNA replication prematurely following damage. Reduced phosphorylation of H2AX (γH2AX) and RPA2, phosphoproteins that are essential to properly initiate the DDR, was also observed in Tax-expressing cells. To determine the cause of decreased DDR protein phosphorylation in Tax-expressing cells, we examined the cellular phosphatase, WIP1, which is known to dephosphorylate γH2AX. We found that Tax can interact with Wip1 in vivo and in vitro, and that Tax-expressing cells display elevated levels of Wip1 mRNA. In vitro phosphatase assays showed that Tax can enhance Wip1 activity on a γH2AX peptide target by 2-fold. Thus, loss of γH2AX in vivo could be due, in part, to increased expression and activity of WIP1 in the presence of Tax. siRNA knockdown of WIP1 in Tax-expressing cells rescued γH2AX in response to damage, confirming the role of WIP1 in the DDR. These studies demonstrate that Tax can disengage the G1/S checkpoint by enhancing WIP1 activity, resulting in reduced DDR. Premature G1 exit of Tax-expressing cells in the presence of DNA lesions creates an environment that tolerates incorporation of random mutations into the host genome."

Organ bath recordings, H(2)S production, immunohistochemistry and western blotting were performed on rat colonic samples to investigate the role of endogenous H(2)S in repeated WAS-induced hypermotility. Organ bath recordings and western blotting were used to detect the role of K(ATP) channels in repeated WAS.Repeated WAS increased the number of fecal pellets per hour and the area under the curve of the spontaneous contractions of colonic strips, and decreased the endogenous production of H(2)S and the expression of H(2)S-producing enzymes in the colon devoid of mucosa and submucosa. Inhibitors of H(2)S-producing enzymes increased the contractile activity of colonic strips in the SWAS rats. NaHS concentration-dependently inhibited the spontaneous contractions of the strips and the NaHS IC(50) for the WAS rats was significantly lower than that for the SWAS rats. The inhibitory effect of NaHS was significantly reduced by glybenclamide. Repeated WAS treatment resulted in up-regulation of Kir6.1 and SUR2B of K(ATP) channels in the colon devoid of mucosa and submucosa.The colonic hypermotility induced by repeated WAS may be associated with the decreased production of endogenous H(2)S. The increased expression of the subunits of K(ATP) channels in colonic smooth muscle cells may be a defensive response to repeated WAS. H(2)S donor may have potential clinical utility in treating chronic stress-induced colonic hypermotility."
https://openalex.org/W2160455977,"The pathway of voluntary joint torque production includes motor neuron recruitment and rate-coding, sarcolemmal depolarization and calcium release by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, force generation by motor proteins within skeletal muscle, and force transmission by tendon across the joint. The direct source of energetic support for this process is ATP hydrolysis. It is possible to examine portions of this physiologic pathway using various in vivo and in vitro techniques, but an integrated view of the multiple processes that ultimately impact joint torque remains elusive. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive computational model of the combined neuromuscular and musculoskeletal systems that includes novel components related to intracellular bioenergetics function. Components representing excitatory drive, muscle activation, force generation, metabolic perturbations, and torque production during voluntary human ankle dorsiflexion were constructed, using a combination of experimentally-derived data and literature values. Simulation results were validated by comparison with torque and metabolic data obtained in vivo. The model successfully predicted peak and submaximal voluntary and electrically-elicited torque output, and accurately simulated the metabolic perturbations associated with voluntary contractions. This novel, comprehensive model could be used to better understand impact of global effectors such as age and disease on various components of the neuromuscular system, and ultimately, voluntary torque output."

Knowledge-based, or systems biology, approaches that involve the analysis of integrated data, predominantly molecular pathways and networks may infer quantitative changes in the levels of biomolecules not included by the given assay from the levels of the analytes profiled. In this study we attempted to use a knowledge-based approach to predict biomarkers reflecting the changes in underlying protein phosphorylation events using Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) as a model. Two soluble biomarkers, CCL-2 and FasL, were inferred in silico as relevant to NAFLD pathogenesis. Predictive performance of these biomarkers was studied using serum samples collected from patients with histologically proven NAFLD. Serum levels of both molecules, in combination with clinical and demographic data, were predictive of hepatic fibrosis in a cohort of NAFLD patients.

While NOD2's role as an innate pathogen sensor is well established, NOD2 is also expressed at low levels in T cells and there are conflicting data as to whether NOD2 plays an intrinsic role in T cell function. Here we show that following adoptive transfer into WT hosts, NOD2−/− OT-I T cells show a small decrease in the number of OVA-specific CD8 T cells recovered at the peak of the response to respiratory influenza virus infection. On the other hand, no such defect was observed upon intranasal immunization with a replication defective adenovirus carrying the OVA epitope recognized by OT-I, or when OVA was delivered with LPS subcutaneously, or when influenza-OVA was delivered intraperitoneally. Thus we observed a selective defect in NOD2-deficient T cell responses only during a live viral infection. Moreover, there was no apparent defect when NOD2−/− OT-I T cells were stimulated in vitro. Finally, this selective defect in recovery of NOD2-deficient CD8 T cells was not observed in a non-transgenic respiratory infection model in which mixed bone marrow chimeras were used such that the NOD2−/− T cells were allowed to develop and respond in a NOD2-sufficient host. Taken together our data indicate that T cell intrinsic NOD2 is not required for CD8 T cell responses to antigen delivered under a variety of conditions in vitro and in vivo. However, CD8 T cells that have developed in the absence of NOD2 show a selective and modest impairment in their response to live respiratory influenza infection."

Porphyromonas gingivalis inhabits the subgingival and extraradicular biofilm of humans and is one of the primary pathogens that cause progressive marginal and refractory apical periodontitis. Furthermore, P. gingivalis possesses PGN_0088, which encodes a putative ortholog of B. subtilis sinR. Here, we investigated the role of PGN_0088 (sinR) on biofilm formation. P. gingivalis strains formed biofilms on saliva-coated glass surfaces in phosphate buffered saline. Quantitative analysis indicated that the biofilm of the sinR null mutant consisted of dense exopolysaccharide. Microscopic observations showed that the increased levels of exopolysaccharide produced by the sinR mutant changed the morphology of the EPS to a mesh-liked structure. Furthermore, physical analyses suggested that the enrichment of exopolysaccharide in the EPS enhanced the resistance of the biofilm to hydrodynamic shear force. The results presented here demonstrate sinR plays important roles in the ability of P. gingivalis strain ATCC 33277 to act as a negative mediator of exopolysaccharide accumulation and is indirectly associated with the structure of the EPS and the force of its adhesion to surfaces."
