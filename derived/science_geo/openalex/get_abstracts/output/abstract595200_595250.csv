https://openalex.org/W2559394418,"Fuelled by increasing computer power and algorithmic advances, machine learning techniques have become powerful tools for finding patterns in data. Since quantum systems produce counter-intuitive patterns believed not to be efficiently produced by classical systems, it is reasonable to postulate that quantum computers may outperform classical computers on machine learning tasks. The field of quantum machine learning explores how to devise and implement concrete quantum software that offers such advantages. Recent work has made clear that the hardware and software challenges are still considerable but has also opened paths towards solutions."
https://openalex.org/W2755255888,"Quantum computers can be used to address molecular structure, materials science and condensed matter physics problems, which currently stretch the limits of existing high-performance computing resources. Finding exact numerical solutions to these interacting fermion problems has exponential cost, while Monte Carlo methods are plagued by the fermionic sign problem. These limitations of classical computational methods have made even few-atom molecular structures problems of practical interest for medium-sized quantum computers. Yet, thus far experimental implementations have been restricted to molecules involving only Period I elements. Here, we demonstrate the experimental optimization of up to six-qubit Hamiltonian problems with over a hundred Pauli terms, determining the ground state energy for molecules of increasing size, up to BeH2. This is enabled by a hardware-efficient variational quantum eigensolver with trial states specifically tailored to the available interactions in our quantum processor, combined with a compact encoding of fermionic Hamiltonians and a robust stochastic optimization routine. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by applying the technique to a problem of quantum magnetism. Across all studied problems, we find agreement between experiment and numerical simulations with a noisy model of the device. These results help elucidate the requirements for scaling the method to larger systems, and aim at bridging the gap between problems at the forefront of high-performance computing and their implementation on quantum hardware."

https://openalex.org/W2754797405,"The field of quantum algorithms aims to find ways to speed up the solution of computational problems by using a quantum computer. A key milestone in this field will be when a universal quantum computer performs a computational task that is beyond the capability of any classical computer, an event known as quantum supremacy. This would be easier to achieve experimentally than full-scale quantum computing, but involves new theoretical challenges. Here we present the leading proposals to achieve quantum supremacy, and discuss how we can reliably compare the power of a classical computer to the power of a quantum computer."

https://openalex.org/W1513904472,"Cryptography is essential for the security of online communication, cars and implanted medical devices. However, many commonly used cryptosystems will be completely broken once large quantum computers exist. Post-quantum cryptography is cryptography under the assumption that the attacker has a large quantum computer; post-quantum cryptosystems strive to remain secure even in this scenario. This relatively young research area has seen some successes in identifying mathematical operations for which quantum algorithms offer little advantage in speed, and then building cryptographic systems around those. The central challenge in post-quantum cryptography is to meet demands for cryptographic usability and flexibility without sacrificing confidence."
https://openalex.org/W2755418751,"A practical quantum computer must not merely store information, but also process it. To prevent errors introduced by noise from multiplying and spreading, a fault-tolerant computational architecture is required. Current experiments are taking the first steps toward noise-resilient logical qubits. But to convert these quantum devices from memories to processors, it is necessary to specify how a universal set of gates is performed on them. The leading proposals for doing so, such as magic-state distillation and colour-code techniques, have high resource demands. Alternative schemes, such as those that use high-dimensional quantum codes in a modular architecture, have potential benefits, but need to be explored further. The leading proposals for converting noise-resilient quantum devices from memories to processors are compared, paying attention to the relative resource demands of each."
https://openalex.org/W2754504461,"While ferromagnets are at the heart of daily life applications, their large magnetization and resulting energy cost for switching bring into question their suitability for reliable low-power spintronic devices. Non-collinear antiferromagnetic systems do not suffer from this problem and often possess remarkable extra functionalities: non-collinear spin order may break space-inversion symmetry and thus allow electric-field control of magnetism, or produce emergent spin-orbit effects, which enable efficient spin-charge interconversion. To harness these unique traits for next-generation spintronics, the nanoscale control and imaging capabilities that are now routine for ferromagnets must be developed for antiferromagnetic systems. Here, using a non-invasive scanning nanomagnetometer based on a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in diamond, we demonstrate the first real-space visualization of non-collinear antiferromagnetic order in a magnetic thin film, at room temperature. We image the spin cycloid of a multiferroic BiFeO$_3$ thin film and extract a period of $\sim70$ nm, consistent with values determined by macroscopic diffraction. In addition, we take advantage of the magnetoelectric coupling present in BiFeO$_3$ to manipulate the cycloid propagation direction by an electric field. Besides highlighting the unique potential of NV magnetometry for imaging complex antiferromagnetic orders at the nanoscale, these results demonstrate how BiFeO$_3$ can be used as a versatile platform for the design of reconfigurable nanoscale spin textures."
https://openalex.org/W2754904600,"As a result of the 1987 Montreal Protocol and its amendments, the atmospheric loading of anthropogenic ozone-depleting substances is decreasing. Accordingly, the stratospheric ozone layer is expected to recover. However, short data records and atmospheric variability confound the search for early signs of recovery, and climate change is masking ozone recovery from ozone-depleting substances in some regions and will increasingly affect the extent of recovery. Here we discuss the nature and timescales of ozone recovery, and explore the extent to which it can be currently detected in different atmospheric regions."
https://openalex.org/W2754899469,"Titanium oxide, water, sodium and a strongly scattering haze have been detected in the atmosphere of the hot Jupiter exoplanet WASP-19b. The atmospheres of some hot Jupiters contain compounds of light and cosmically abundant elements. Metal oxides such as titanium oxide and vanadium oxide have been predicted to also be present, but hitherto have not been observed. Using high-precision spectroscopy, Elyar Sedaghati et al. have now detected titanium oxide in the atmosphere of the hot Jupiter WASP-19b. The researchers have also seen evidence of water and a strongly scattering haze. The findings pave the way for future studies of heavy elements in these hot exoplanetary atmospheres. As an exoplanet transits its host star, some of the light from the star is absorbed by the atoms and molecules in the planet’s atmosphere, causing the planet to seem bigger; plotting the planet’s observed size as a function of the wavelength of the light produces a transmission spectrum1. Measuring the tiny variations in the transmission spectrum, together with atmospheric modelling, then gives clues to the properties of the exoplanet’s atmosphere. Chemical species composed of light elements—such as hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, sodium and potassium—have in this way been detected in the atmospheres of several hot giant exoplanets2,3,4,5, but molecules composed of heavier elements have thus far proved elusive. Nonetheless, it has been predicted that metal oxides such as titanium oxide (TiO) and vanadium oxide occur in the observable regions of the very hottest exoplanetary atmospheres, causing thermal inversions on the dayside6,7. Here we report the detection of TiO in the atmosphere of the hot-Jupiter planet WASP-19b. Our combined spectrum, with its wide spectral coverage, reveals the presence of TiO (to a confidence level of 7.7σ), a strongly scattering haze (7.4σ) and sodium (3.4σ), and confirms the presence of water (7.9σ) in the atmosphere5,8."

https://openalex.org/W2755523064,"Mitochondrial trafficking plays a central role in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuronal cell survival and neurotransmission by transporting mitochondria from the neuronal cell body throughout the bundles of DRG axons. In type 2 diabetes (T2DM), dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia damage DRG neurons and induce mitochondrial dysfunction; however, the impact of free fatty acids and glucose on mitochondrial trafficking in DRG neurons remains unknown. To evaluate the impact of free fatty acids compared to hyperglycemia on mitochondrial transport, primary adult mouse DRG neuron cultures were treated with physiologic concentrations of palmitate and glucose and assessed for alterations in mitochondrial trafficking, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial bioenergetics. Palmitate treatment significantly reduced the number of motile mitochondria in DRG axons, but physiologic concentrations of glucose did not impair mitochondrial trafficking dynamics. Palmitate-treated DRG neurons also exhibited a reduction in mitochondrial velocity, and impaired mitochondrial trafficking correlated with mitochondrial depolarization in palmitate-treated DRG neurons. Finally, we found differential bioenergetic effects of palmitate and glucose on resting and energetically challenged mitochondria in DRG neurons. Together, these results suggest that palmitate induces DRG neuron mitochondrial depolarization, inhibiting axonal mitochondrial trafficking and altering mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity.-Rumora, A.

https://openalex.org/W2753988219,"Among dietary fatty acids with immunologic effects, ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as α-linolenic acid (ALA), have been considered as factors that contribute to the differentiation of M2-type macrophages (M2 macrophages). In this study, we examined the effect of ALA and its gut lactic acid bacteria metabolites 13-hydroxy-9(Z),15(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (13-OH) and 13-oxo-9(Z),15(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (13-oxo) on the differentiation of M2 macrophages from bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) and investigated the underlying mechanisms. BMDCs were stimulated with ALA, 13-OH, or 13-oxo in the presence of IL-4 or IL-13 for 24 h, and significant increases in M2 macrophage markers CD206 and Arginase-1 (Arg1) were observed. In addition, M2 macrophage phenotypes were less prevalent following cotreatment with GPCR40 antagonists or inhibitors of PLC-β and MEK under these conditions, suggesting that GPCR40 signaling is involved in the regulation of M2 macrophage differentiation. In further experiments, remarkable M2 macrophage accumulation was observed in the lamina propria of the small intestine of C57BL/6 mice after intragastric treatments with ALA, 13-OH, or 13-oxo at 1 g/kg of body weight per day for 3 d. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of M2 macrophage differentiation involving fatty acids from gut lactic acid bacteria and GPCR40 signaling.-Ohue-Kitano, R., Yasuoka, Y., Goto, T., Kitamura, N., Park, S.-B., Kishino, S., Kimura, I., Kasubuchi, M., Takahashi, H., Li, Y., Yeh, Y.-S., Jheng, H.-F., Iwase, M., Tanaka, M., Masuda, S., Inoue, T., Yamakage, H., Kusakabe, T., Tani, F., Shimatsu, A., Takahashi, N., Ogawa, J., Satoh-Asahara, N., Kawada, T. α-Linolenic acid-derived metabolites from gut lactic acid bacteria induce differentiation of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages through G protein-coupled receptor 40."
https://openalex.org/W2754309942,"Oxidative stress is one of the key factors that contributes to the pathogenesis of keratoconus (KC). Macroautophagy is a vital cellular mechanism that is activated in response to oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to understand the role of the autophagic lysosomal pathway in the oxidative damage of KC corneal epithelium and the human corneal epithelial cell line (HCE).The corneal epithelium was collected from 78 KC patients undergoing corneal cross-linking or topography guided photorefractive keratectomy. We performed microarray, qPCR and western blot analysis for the expression of autophagy markers on this epithelium from patients with different clinical grades of KC. A differential expression pattern of autophagy related markers was observed in the diseased corneal cone-specific epithelium compared to matched peripheral epithelium from KC patients with increasing clinical severity. Human corneal epithelial cells exposed to oxidative stress were analyzed for the expression of key proteins associated with KC pathogenesis and the autophagic pathway. Oxidative stress led to an increase in reactive oxygen species and an imbalanced expression of autophagy markers in the HCE cells. Further, reduced levels of Akt/p70S6 Kinase, which is a known target of the mTOR pathway was observed in HCE cells under oxidative stress as well as in KC epithelium. Our results suggest that an altered expression of proteins suggestive of defective autophagy and is a consequence of oxidative damage. This could play a possible role in the pathogenesis of KC."
https://openalex.org/W2756276536,"Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant and carcinogen that is frequently found in particulate matter, with a diameter of ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5). It has been reported to interrupt the normal reproductive system, but the exact molecular basis has not been clearly defined. To understand the underlying mechanisms regarding how BaP exposure disrupts female fertility, we evaluated oocyte quality by assessing the critical regulators and events during oocyte meiotic maturation and fertilization. We found that BaP exposure compromised the mouse oocyte meiotic progression by disrupting normal spindle assembly, chromosome alignment, and kinetochore-microtubule attachment, consequently leading to the generation of aneuploid eggs. In addition, BaP administration significantly decreased the fertilization rate of mouse eggs by reducing the number of sperm binding to the zona pellucida, which was consistent with the premature cleavage of N terminus of zona pellucida sperm-binding protein 2 and precocious exocytosis of ovastacin. Furthermore, BaP exposure interfered with the gamete fusion process by perturbing the localization and protein level of Juno. Notably, we found that BaP exposure induced oxidative stress with an increased level of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis in oocytes and therebyled to the deterioration of critical regulators and events during oocyte meiotic progression and fertilization. Our data document that BaP exposure reduces female fertility via impairing oocyte maturation and fertilization ability induced by oxidative stress and early apoptosis in murine models.—Zhang, M., Miao, Y., Chen, Q., Cai, M., Dong, W., Dai, X., Lu, Y., Zhou, C., Cui, Z., Xiong, B.

https://openalex.org/W2756295472,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to play diverse roles in biologic and pathologic processes, including myogenesis. We found that lncRNA AK017368 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle cells. Functional analyses showed that overexpression of AK017368 promoted proliferation and restrained differentiation of myoblasts; whereas inhibition of AK017368 had completely opposite effects in vitro. In mice, knockdown of AK017368 promoted muscle hypertrophy in vivo. RNA molecules of AK017368 acted mechanistically as competing endogenous RNAs to target micro-RNA (miR)-30c, which was supported by the results of bioinformatics analyses and dual-luciferase reporter assays. It has been shown that lncRNA AK017368 competes with trinucleotide repeat containing-6A (Tnrc6a)for miR-30c. Tnrc6a was previously reported to promote proliferation and inhibit differentiation of myoblast cells, whereas miR-30c targets the 3'-UTR of Tnrc6a mRNA to weaken its function.

https://openalex.org/W2754919895,"The pathology of schistosomiasis mansoni, a neglected tropical disease of great clinical and socioeconomic importance, results from the parasite eggs that become trapped in host tissues, particularly in the liver and intestines. Continuous antigenic stimulation from these eggs leads to recruitment of inflammatory cells to the sites of infection with formation of periovular granulomas. These complex structures have variable size and composition and are the most striking histopathological feature of schistosomiasis mansoni. However, evaluation of granulomas by conventional microscopy methods is time-consuming and limited, especially in large-scale studies. Here, we used high resolution Whole Slide Imaging (WSI), which allows fast scanning of entire histological slides, and multiple morphometric evaluations, to assess the granulomatous response elicited in target organs (liver, small and large intestines) of two models of schistosomiasis mansoni. One of the advantages of WSI, also termed virtual microscopy, is that it generates images that simultaneously offer high resolution and a wide field of observation. By using a model of natural (Nectomys squamipes, a wild reservoir captured from endemic areas in Brazil) and experimental (Swiss mouse) infection with Schistosoma mansoni, we provided the first detailed WSI characterization of granulomas and other pathological aspects. WSI and quantitative analyses enabled a fast and reliable assessment of the number, evolutional types, frequency and areas of granulomas and inflammatory infiltrates and revealed that target organs are differentially impacted by inflammatory responses in the natural and experimental infections. Remarkably, high-resolution analysis of individual eosinophils, key cells elicited by this helminthic infection, showed a great difference in eosinophil numbers between the two infections. Moreover, features such as the intestinal egg path and confluent granulomas were uncovered. Thus, WSI may be a suitable tool for detailed and precise histological analysis of granulomas and other pathological aspects for clinical and research studies of schistosomiasis."

https://openalex.org/W2754918228,"2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and related compounds are extraordinarily potent environmental toxic pollutants. Most of the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxicities are mediated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) family. Upon ligand binding, AhR forms a heterodimer with AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT) and induces the expression of genes involved in various biological responses. One of the genes induced by AhR encodes AhR repressor (AhRR), which also forms a heterodimer with ARNT and represses the activation of AhR-dependent transcription. The control of AhR activation is critical for managing AhR-mediated diseases, but the mechanisms by which AhRR represses AhR activation remain poorly understood, because of the lack of structural information. Here, we determined the structure of the AhRR–ARNT heterodimer by X-ray crystallography, which revealed an asymmetric intertwined domain organization presenting structural features that are both conserved and distinct among bHLH-PAS family members. The structures of AhRR–ARNT and AhR–ARNT were similar in the bHLH-PAS-A region, whereas the PAS-B of ARNT in the AhRR–ARNT complex exhibited a different domain arrangement in this family reported so far. The structure clearly disclosed that AhRR competitively represses AhR binding to ARNT and target DNA and further suggested the existence of an AhRR–ARNT-specific repression mechanism. This study provides a structural basis for understanding the mechanism by which AhRR represses AhR-mediated gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2755594586,"Early detection of bone metastases is helpful for the treatment of bladder cancer (BC). In this study, we investigated the potential risk factors for bone metastasis in newly diagnosed patients with BC. A total of 902 patients diagnosed with BC between January 2000 and August 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Of these patient, 50 (5.5%) were identified with bone metastasis. The serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and calcium were significantly higher in patients with bone metastases than those without bone metastases (P = 0.015 and P<0.001). And the concentration of hemoglobin (HB) was significant lower in bone metastatic patients compared with non bone metastatic patients (P = 0.009). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that ALP, HB and calcium were independent risk factors for bone metastases in patients with BC. The cut off values of ALP, HB and calcium were 116 U/L, 37.5g/L and 2.54 mmol/L according to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis. And combined ALP, HB with calcium had the highest diagnostic accuracy for predicting bone metastases in BC patients (AUC = 0.760, P<0.001). Therefore, for newly diagnosed patients with BC, the concentrations of ALP >116 U/L, HB <37.5 g/Land calcium >2.54 mmol/L were the risk factors for developing bone metastases. Combined ALP, HB with calcium was more useful to diagnose the bone metastases."
https://openalex.org/W2754220902,"Coastal wetland responses to sea-level rise are greatly influenced by biogeomorphic processes that affect wetland surface elevation. Small changes in elevation relative to sea level can lead to comparatively large changes in ecosystem structure, function, and stability. The surface elevation table-marker horizon (SET-MH) approach is being used globally to quantify the relative contributions of processes affecting wetland elevation change. Historically, SET-MH measurements have been obtained at local scales to address site-specific research questions. However, in the face of accelerated sea-level rise, there is an increasing need for elevation change network data that can be incorporated into regional ecological models and vulnerability assessments. In particular, there is a need for long-term, high-temporal resolution data that are strategically distributed across ecologically-relevant abiotic gradients. Here, we quantify the distribution of SET-MH stations along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast (USA) across political boundaries (states), wetland habitats, and ecologically-relevant abiotic gradients (i.e., gradients in temperature, precipitation, elevation, and relative sea-level rise). Our analyses identify areas with high SET-MH station densities as well as areas with notable gaps. Salt marshes, intermediate elevations, and colder areas with high rainfall have a high number of stations, while salt flat ecosystems, certain elevation zones, the mangrove-marsh ecotone, and hypersaline coastal areas with low rainfall have fewer stations. Due to rapid rates of wetland loss and relative sea-level rise, the state of Louisiana has the most extensive SET-MH station network in the region, and we provide several recent examples where data from Louisiana’s network have been used to assess and compare wetland vulnerability to sea-level rise. Our findings represent the first attempt to examine spatial gaps in SET-MH coverage across abiotic gradients. Our analyses can be used to transform a broadly disseminated and unplanned collection of SET-MH stations into a coordinated and strategic regional network. This regional network would provide data for predicting and preparing for the responses of coastal wetlands to accelerated sea-level rise and other aspects of global change."
https://openalex.org/W2755245816,"Background HIV-infected individuals have increased risk of developing obstructive lung disease (OLD). Studies from developed countries report high viral load, low CD4 counts, and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to be associated with OLD; but these findings may not be generalizable to populations in resource-limited settings. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of lung function in 730 HIV-infected black South African adults. Pre-bronchodilator spirometry was performed at enrollment and repeated annually for three years. Logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with OLD, defined as FEV1/FVC<0.70, at enrollment. Excess annual declines in FEV1 and FVC were modelled as the product-term of follow-up time and exposures using random effects regression. Results Median (IQR) age at enrollment was 36 (32–41) years, 85% were female and 30% ever-smoked with a median (IQR) exposure of 3 (1–6) pack-years. Median (IQR) CD4 count and viral load at enrollment were 372 (261–518) cells/mm3 and 2655 (91–13,548) copies/mL respectively. Overall, 25% were receiving ART at enrollment, 16% of whom reported at least 6 months of ART receipt. OLD was found in 35 (5%) at enrollment. Increasing age (aOR = 2.08 per 10-years [95%CI 1.22–3.57], p = 0.007), current smoking (aOR = 3.55 [95%CI 1.20–10.53], p = 0.02), and CRP (aOR = 1.01 per unit-increase [95%CI 1.00–1.03], p = 0.04) were significantly associated with OLD at enrollment; while increasing CD4 count (aOR = 1.02 per-100 cells/mm3 [95%CI 0.85–1.22], p = 0.82), viral load (aOR = 0.67 per log-increase [95%CI 0.43–1.10], p = 0.12) and receipt of ART (aOR = 0.57 [95%CI 0.18–1.75], p = 0.32) were not. The median (IQR) follow-up time was 18 (12–24) months. Participants with a history of tuberculosis (TB) had a 35 mL (95%CI 2–68, p = 0.03) and 57 mL (95%CI 19–96, p = 0.003) per year excess loss of FEV1 and FVC respectively. Conclusion Prevalent OLD was associated with older age, current smoking and higher CRP levels, but not CD4 counts and ART, in HIV-infected South African adults. Better understanding of the long-term effects of TB, smoking and inflammation on lung function in HIV-infected populations is urgently needed."

It is likely that there are additional, as yet unidentified viruses in camels with the potential to cause disease in humans. In this study, we performed metagenomic sequencing analysis on nasopharyngeal swab samples from 108 MERS-CoV-positive dromedary camels from a live animal market in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. We obtained a total of 846.72 million high-quality reads from these nasopharyngeal swab samples, of which 2.88 million (0.34%) were related to viral sequences while 512.63 million (60.5%) and 50.87 million (6%) matched bacterial and eukaryotic sequences, respectively. Among the viral reads, sequences related to mammalian viruses from 13 genera in 10 viral families were identified, including Coronaviridae, Nairoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Parvoviridae, Polyomaviridae, Papillomaviridae, Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, Poxviridae, and Genomoviridae. Some viral sequences belong to known camel or human viruses and others are from potentially novel camel viruses with only limited sequence similarity to virus sequences in GenBank. A total of five potentially novel virus species or strains were identified. Co-infection of at least two recently identified camel coronaviruses was detected in 92.6% of the camels in the study. This study provides a comprehensive survey of viruses in the virome of upper respiratory samples in camels that have extensive contact with the human population."

In this paper we study the empirical data that crawled from Twitter to describe the topology and information spreading dynamics of Online Social Networks. We propose a measurement with three measures to state the efforts of users on Twitter to get their information spreading, based on the unique mechanisms for information retransmission on Twitter. It is noticed that small fraction of users with special performance on participation can gain great influence, while most other users play a role as middleware during the information propagation. Thus a community analysis is performed and four categories of users are found with different kinds of participation that cause the information dissemination dynamics. These suggest that exiting topological measures alone may reflect little about the influence of individuals and provide new insights for information spreading."

This study quantified southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) habitat use within and around the polynyas of the Prydz Bay region (63°E– 88°E) in East Antarctica, and examined the bio-physical characteristics structuring polynyas as foraging habitat. Output from a climatological regional ocean model was used to provide context for in situ temperature-salinity vertical profiles collected by tagged elephant seals and to characterise the physical properties structuring polynyas. Biological properties were explored using remotely-sensed surface chlorophyll (Chl-a) and, qualitatively, historical fish assemblage data. Spatially gridded residence time of seals was examined in relation to habitat characteristics using generalized additive mixed models. The results showed clear polynya usage during early autumn and increasingly concentrated usage during early winter. Bathymetry, Chl-a, surface net heat flux (representing polynya location), and bottom temperature were identified as significant bio-physical predictors of the spatio-temporal habitat usage. The findings from this study confirm that the most important marine habitats for juvenile male southern elephant seals within Prydz Bay region are polynyas. A hypothesis exists regarding the seasonal evolution of primary productivity, coupling from surface to subsurface productivity and supporting elevated rates of secondary production in the upper water column during summer-autumn. An advancement to this hypothesis is proposed here, whereby this bio-physical coupling is likely to extend throughout the water column as it becomes fully convected during autumn-winter, to also promote pelagic-benthic linkages important for benthic foraging within polynyas."
https://openalex.org/W2754572079,"The translational regulator cytosolic polyadenylation element–binding protein 2 (CPEB2) has two isoforms, CPEB2A and CPEB2B, derived by alternative splicing of RNA into a mature form that either includes or excludes exon 4. Previously, we reported that this splicing event is highly dysregulated in aggressive forms of breast cancers, which overexpress CPEB2B. The loss of CPEB2A with a concomitant increase in CPEB2B was also required for breast cancer cells to resist cell death because of detachment (anoikis resistance) and metastasize in vivo. To examine the mechanism by which CPEB2 isoforms mediate opposing effects on cancer-related phenotypes, we used next generation sequencing of triple negative breast cancer cells in which the isoforms were specifically down-regulated. Down-regulation of the CPEB2B isoform inhibited pathways driving the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and hypoxic response, whereas down-regulation of the CPEB2A isoform did not have this effect. Examining key nodes of these pathways showed that CPEB2B induced the expression of regulatory DNA trans-factors (e.g. HIF1α and TWIST1). Specifically, CPEB2B functioned as a translational activator of TWIST1 and HIF1α. Functional studies showed that specific down-regulation of either HIF1α or TWIST1 inhibited the ability of CPEB2B to induce the acquisition of anoikis resistance and drive metastasis. Overall, this study demonstrates that CPEB2 alternative splicing is a major regulator of key cellular pathways linked to anoikis resistance and metastasis.

Down-regulation of the CPEB2B isoform inhibited pathways driving the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and hypoxic response, whereas down-regulation of the CPEB2A isoform did not have this effect. Examining key nodes of these pathways showed that CPEB2B induced the expression of regulatory DNA trans-factors (e.g. HIF1α and TWIST1). Specifically, CPEB2B functioned as a translational activator of TWIST1 and HIF1α. Functional studies showed that specific down-regulation of either HIF1α or TWIST1 inhibited the ability of CPEB2B to induce the acquisition of anoikis resistance and drive metastasis. Overall, this study demonstrates that CPEB2 alternative splicing is a major regulator of key cellular pathways linked to anoikis resistance and metastasis. Breast cancer currently has the second highest mortality rate of all types of cancers (1Dai X. Li T. Bai Z. Yang Y. Liu X. Zhan J. Shi B. Breast cancer intrinsic subtype classification, clinical use and future trends.Am. J. Cancer Res. 2015; 5: 2929-2943PubMed Google Scholar). Although most breast cancers are well-controlled via first-line treatments, patients whose cancers escape these therapies are at high risk for metastasis and associated mortality. Hence, studies which elucidate the mechanisms of tumor formation and metastasis are necessary to combat this deadly disease (2Haque R. Ahmed S.A. Inzhakova G. Shi J. Avila C. Polikoff J. Bernstein L.

Regarding these mechanisms, a multitude of acquired characteristics are necessary for cancer cells to form tumors, invade the surrounding tissues, and, eventually, colonize distant organs (4Vanharanta S.

One early characteristic is the ability to survive independent of attachment (i.e. anoikis resistance (AnR)) 3The abbreviations used are: AnRanoikis resistanceASalternative splicingCPEB2cytosolic polyadenylation element–binding protein 2EMTepithelial-to-mesenchymal transitionTNBCtriple negative breast cancerNGSnext generation sequencingiNOSinducible nitric oxide synthasepolyHEMApoly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate)RPKMreads per kilobase per million.

Our laboratory has recently delineated the RNA alternative splicing (AS) events, which are induced by AnR. One such event, the AS of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element–binding protein 2 (CPEB2) was demonstrated by our laboratory to enhance metastasis of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Specifically, the CPEB2B isoform, which is produced by inclusion of exon 4 into the mature CPEB2 mRNA, was observed to be dramatically up-regulated in aggressive forms of human breast cancer and expression of this CPEB2 isoform dramatically enhanced the metastasis of TNBC cells in murine orthotopic models (7Johnson R.M.

This pro-neoplastic function was in stark contrast to the anti-neoplastic function of the CPEB2A isoform, which is produced by exclusion of exon 4 from the mature CPEB2 mRNA. anoikis resistance alternative splicing cytosolic polyadenylation element–binding protein 2 epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition triple negative breast cancer next generation sequencing inducible nitric oxide synthase poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate) reads per kilobase per million. CPEB2 is a member of the family of cytosolic polyadenylation element–binding proteins (CPEB), which is comprised of four members (CPEB1–4) that function as regulators of protein translation via modulation of cytoplasmic RNA polyadenylation. In general, CPEB family members are considered to be suppressors of mRNA translation and anti-neoplastic in nature (8D'Ambrogio A. Nagaoka K. Richter J.D.

How the inclusion of a small exon (30 amino acids encoded by exon 4) into the mature CPEB2 mRNA to produce the CPEB2B isoform induces an opposite function from other CPEB family members is currently unknown. In these studies, the cellular mechanisms by which the CPEB2B isoform imparts the pro-neoplastic effects were elucidated. Specifically, these studies demonstrate that CPEB2B drives AnR via induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and hypoxic response pathways. We further show that CPEB2B plays an antagonistic role against CPEB2A by alleviating the translational inhibition of HIF1α and TWIST1 imparted by the CPEB2A splice variant. Thus, these studies show a major regulatory role for the AS of CPEB2 in the EMT and hypoxia pathways, and these studies demonstrate the critical role for AS in regulating specific cellular processes related to stress signaling. Our laboratory previously reported that the splice variants, CPEB2A and B, produced by alternative inclusion/exclusion of exon 4 (Fig. 1A) (7Johnson R.M. Vu N.T. Griffin B.P. Gentry A.E. Archer K.J. Chalfant C.E. Park M.A. The alternative splicing of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 2 drives anoikis resistance and the metastasis of triple negative breast cancer.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 25717-25727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), have contrasting functions on the acquisition of AnR and the metastatic ability of TNBC cells. Specifically, expression of the exon 4–included isoform, CPEB2B, correlated with AnR resistance, high-grade metastatic breast cancer, and a dramatically enhanced metastatic rate in stark contrast to CPEB2A, the exon 4–excluded isoform (7Johnson R.M. Vu N.T. Griffin B.P. Gentry A.E. Archer K.J. Chalfant C.E. Park M.A. The alternative splicing of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 2 drives anoikis resistance and the metastasis of triple negative breast cancer.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 25717-25727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These published findings supported the hypothesis that CPEB2 isoforms regulated key cell survival pathways in a contrasting manner. To explore this hypothesis, we utilized next generation sequencing (NGS) coupled to specific down-regulation of CPEB2 splice variants in AnR TNBC cells (Fig. 1B). Down-regulation of the CPEB2B isoform in MDA-MB-231 cells, in stark contrast to down-regulation of the CPEB2A isoform, led to suppression of cellular pathways driving both cell growth/proliferation and EMT/hypoxic response. Specifically, CPEB2A was observed as a negative regulator of transcriptomic signatures associated with both the EMT and the hypoxic response pathways as well as tumor suppressor pathways, whereas CPEB2B was observed to act as a major enhancer of these pathways as well as oncogenic signaling (Fig. 1, C and D). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) demonstrated that cellular signaling nodes linked to TWIST1/SNAI1 and HIF1α-regulated pathways were central to the contrasting functions of CPEB2 splice variants (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, differences in the mRNA levels of these DNA trans-factors were not observed in these NGS data. Because CPEB2 has been implicated as a translational repressor of TWIST1 and HIF1α (10Nairismägi M.L. Füchtbauer A. Labouriau R. Bramsen J.B. Füchtbauer E.M. The proto-oncogene TWIST1 is regulated by microRNAs.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e66070Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 11Chen P.J. Huang Y.S. CPEB2-eEF2 interaction impedes HIF-1α RNA translation.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 959-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), our findings coupled to these published reports formed the premise that CPEB2A is the suppressing form of CPEB2 on TWIST1 protein expression as reported by others (9Nairismägi M.L. Vislovukh A. Meng Q. Kratassiouk G. Beldiman C. Petretich M. Groisman R. Füchtbauer E.M. Harel-Bellan A. Groisman I. Translational control of TWIST1 expression in MCF-10A cell lines recapitulating breast cancer progression.Oncogene. 2012; 31: 4960-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 10Nairismägi M.L. Füchtbauer A. Labouriau R. Bramsen J.B. Füchtbauer E.M. The proto-oncogene TWIST1 is regulated by microRNAs.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e66070Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), whereas CPEB2B has the previously unexplored function of activating the expression of these DNA trans-factors in response to cellular stress or the acquisition of AnR. In line with this premise, we observed that both HIF1α and TWIST1 were up-regulated in AnR MDA-MB-231 cells, which correlated with a decrease in the CPEB2A/CPEB2B ratio (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, specific modulation of this splice variant ratio using siRNA affected the expression of HIF1α and TWIST1 at the protein level in parental MDA-MB-231 cells. Specifically, down-regulation of CPEB2A using siRNA (Fig. 2C) or ectopic expression of CPEB2B (Fig. 2, D and G) (FLAG-tagged CPEB2) to decrease the CPEB2A/B ratio up-regulated HIF1α and TWIST1 expression at the protein level. In contrast, down-regulation of CPEB2B using siRNA (Fig. 2C) or ectopic expression of CPEB2A (Fig. 2, D and G) (FLAG-tagged CPEB2) to increase the CPEB2A/B ratio dramatically down-regulated expression of these two proteins. These effects also translated to other members of the EMT pathway (N-cadherin, E-cadherin) and other factors, which were identified as part of the next generation sequencing screen (Fig. 2, C—E). Down-regulation of TWIST1 or HIF1α using siRNA blocked the expression of hypoxic response and EMT genes induced by CPEB2B expression in parental MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2F). Taken together, these results confirm that hypoxic and EMT pathways are regulated by CPEB2 AS via modulation of the expression of key DNA trans-factors regulating these pathways. Furthermore, these data show that the CPEB2A isoform is the negative regulator of TWIST1 and HIF1α expression, in complete contrast to the CPEB2B isoform. A large body of research has demonstrated that HIF1α is regulated via a decrease in ubiquitination and subsequent increase in protein stability after a hypoxic stress (12Wang R. Zhang P. Li J. Guan H. Shi G. Ubiquitination is absolutely required for the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor–1 alpha protein in hypoxic conditions.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2016; 470: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Our results suggested an additional component in regard to HIF1α expression, specifically the regulation of HIF1α translation/polyadenylation by CPEB2 isoforms. Therefore, we undertook studies aimed at determining whether CPEB2 AS regulated TWIST1 and HIF1α at either the level of transcription, protein stability, or translation. TWIST1 and HIF1α mRNA levels are not affected by ectopic expression of CPEB2A and B; additionally, the protein stability of these DNA trans-factors were also not affected (data not shown). To determine whether mRNA transcription was affected by CPEB2 AS, nascent RNA transcripts were biotinylated and pulled down with streptavidin. Again, no significant differences because of CPEB2 AS were observed in the rate of nascent mRNA formation (data not shown). To investigate the translation of TWIST1 and HIF1α, l-azidohomoalanine, a methionine mimetic, was used to pulse both CPEB2A and CPEB2B overexpressing cells (Fig. 3A) for nascent protein labeling with biotin. As shown in Fig. 3B, nascent TWIST1 and HIF1α protein levels were up-regulated by CPEB2B, but CPEB2A expression induced the opposite effect. Taken together, these results indicate that CPEB2A/B regulation of the hypoxia/EMT axis occurs at the level translation. Our data strongly suggest that CPEB2B-mediated increases in AnR occur via dysregulated EMT and hypoxic response signaling. Therefore, we performed experiments to determine whether HIF1α and TWIST1 signaling were important for CPEB2 AS-mediated AnR. Using MDA-MB-231 cells stably overexpressing FLAG-CPEB2B, we found that these cells were protected from cell death induced by detachment when compared with a stable vector control (pcDNA 3.1) (Fig. 4, A and B). Importantly, RNAi directed toward either HIF1α or TWIST1 significantly blocked the acquisition of AnR imparted by CPEB2B expression without effects on basal anoikis sensitivity in parental MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4, A and B). The requirement of HIF1α and TWIST1 for tumor growth in vivo was then assessed. Indeed, shRNA targeted toward TWIST1 and HIF1α significantly inhibited the enhanced tumor size induced by CPEB2B ectopic expression (Fig. 4, C and D). Inversely, when CPEB2A was ectopically expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells, the volume of primary tumors was significantly reduced in comparison to vector-expressing controls. In addition, rescuing the expression of TWIST1 and HIF1α using adenovirus vectors resulted in a recovery of primary tumor volumes to control levels (Fig. 4E). Finally, when primary tumor sizes were allowed to reach relatively equivalent volumes, enhanced lung metastasis was observed for the CPEB2B overexpressing cells, however shRNA to TWIST1 significantly decreased visible tumor lesions on the lungs (Fig. 5). Interestingly, tumors in which HIF1α was down-regulated were unable to produce primary tumors of significant volume to assess the effects on metastatic capability (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the effects of CPEB2 AS on AnR and subsequent enhancement of metastasis require TWIST1 signaling, whereas AnR and primary tumor growth is strongly associated with the HIF1α DNA trans-factor, but the association of this DNA trans-factor with the metastatic rate is inconclusive at this time. Our laboratory previously identified and characterized the requirement of CPEB2 AS in driving the acquisition of AnR and subsequent enhancement of the metastasis of TNBC (7Johnson R.M. Vu N.T. Griffin B.P. Gentry A.E. Archer K.J. Chalfant C.E. Park M.A. The alternative splicing of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 2 drives anoikis resistance and the metastasis of triple negative breast cancer.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 25717-25727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this study, these initial findings were extended to determining the mechanism by which CPEB2B, a novel “pro-metastatic” isoform of CPEB2, induced AnR. Interestingly, CPEB2A and CPEB2B, in an opposing fashion, were found to affect the mRNA levels of various genes central to the motility/hypoxia/EMT axis, but not the mRNA levels of the key nodes in these pathways, HIF1α and TWIST1. In regard to the expression of these key nodes, we found that ectopic expression of CPEB2A decreases the nascent protein synthesis of these DNA trans-factors with no effect on protein stability or transcriptional expression. However, and surprisingly, ectopic expression of CPEB2B enhanced the translation of these proteins. In regard to the translational regulation of these pathway nodes, CPEB2 has been reported as a translational repressor of target mRNAs such as TWIST1, but our studies demonstrate that specifically the CPEB2A isoform of the CPEB2 gene is a repressor of translation. On the other hand, the CPEB2B isoform is a translational activator of these same target mRNAs demonstrating a major regulatory role for CPEB2 AS in cellular stress responses. How the inclusion of an exon encoding 30 additional amino acids adjacent to the low complexity domain is providing such a drastic functional change is unknown. Based on the repressor complex for the CPEB family member, CPEB1, one can hypothesize that CPEB2B, in contrast to CPEB2A, does not possess the ability to form a stable repressor complex with known interaction partners (e.g. bind PARN, GLD2), and thus, when CPEB2B binds a target CPE RNA cis-element (CPE site) for a specific mRNA, cytoplasmic polyadenylation commences followed by efficient translation of the target mRNA (8D'Ambrogio A. Nagaoka K. Richter J.D. Translational control of cell growth and malignancy by the CPEBs.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2013; 13: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Richter J.D.

Opposing polymerase-deadenylase activities regulate cytoplasmic polyadenylation.Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 173-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Currently, our preliminary data do not show drastic differences between the isoforms in this regard (data not shown), but the composition of the repressor complex may be different among the CPEB family members as CPEB1 is the most characterized in this regard. Furthermore, the inclusion of exon 4 may simply inactivate the translational repressing function of CPEB2 while retaining the RNA-binding specificity and capability. Thus, CPEB2B, although inactive as a translational repressor, would compete with CPEB2A for binding target RNAs and allow both cytoplasmic polyadenylation and the subsequent translation to proceed. The above hypothesized mechanisms require the inference that CPEB2A and B bind to the same CPE sites, and thus compete for the binding of target RNAs. In this regard, both our published findings and this study support a straightforward, competition-based system (7Johnson R.M. Vu N.T. Griffin B.P. Gentry A.E. Archer K.J. Chalfant C.E. Park M.A. The alternative splicing of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 2 drives anoikis resistance and the metastasis of triple negative breast cancer.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 25717-25727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For example, direct modulation of one CPEB2 splice variant induces an enhancement of the opposing function of the other variant (e.g. down-regulation of CPEB2B induces the loss of TWIST1 expression whereas down-regulation of CPEB2A in the same cell lines induces the expression of TWIST1). Because the inclusion of exon 4 is not within the RNA-binding domains and the ratio of CPEB2A/B is associated with function, the premise of a competition-based mechanism is supported as both isoforms likely share the same RNA-binding capacity. Unpublished data from our laboratory also support this mechanism as both CPEB2A and B will bind specifically to the same CPE sites of the TWIST1 3′UTR. 4J. T. DeLigio, G. Lin, C. E. Chalfant, and M. A. Park, unpublished results. Additional future studies to determine effects on repressor complex formation and target mRNA polyadenylation are needed to validate this proposed mechanism. Another interesting finding from this study is that the translation of HIF1α is a key mechanism affecting the expression of this DNA trans-factor. As our data demonstrate, the expression of HIF1α, a major early marker in the hypoxia response pathway, is induced at least partially via translation in these studies, and is responsible for at least some of the tumor formation/tumor growth induced by the “B” isoform of CPEB2. The reigning paradigm is that in response to hypoxia, the proteolytic degradation of HIF1α is inhibited, which is the driving force in increasing HIF1α expression (15Kong X. Lin Z. Liang D. Fath D. Sang N. Caro J. Histone deacetylase inhibitors induce VHL and ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α.Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 2019-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 16Hon W.C. Wilson M.I. Harlos K. Claridge T.D. Schofield C.J. Pugh C.W. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Structural basis for the recognition of hydroxyproline in HIF-1 α by pVHL.Nature. 2002; 417: 975-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Our study found that increased translation of HIF1α was the major regulating mechanism for the expression of this DNA trans-factor in response to detachment-induced cell stress. It is therefore intriguing to surmise that during other cell stress cascades (e.g. hypoxia), enhanced translation of HIF1α via CPEB2B expression, acts as a cooperative mechanism with the inhibition of proteolytic degradation to drive HIF1α expression. Indeed, if this premise is validated, CPEB2 AS may emerge as a master regulator of a number of cellular stress responses. Of note, the culmination of the findings in this study coupled to our previous report (7Johnson R.M. Vu N.T. Griffin B.P. Gentry A.E. Archer K.J. Chalfant C.E. Park M.A. The alternative splicing of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 2 drives anoikis resistance and the metastasis of triple negative breast cancer.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 25717-25727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) suggest that targeting the CPEB2B isoform with new therapeutics would have profound effects on suppressing cell survival and stress pathways, and thus dramatically limit metastatic potential. As CPEB2A and B are likely competing for binding to the same mRNAs, specifically targeting CPEB2B may be difficult. On the other hand, therapies which target the CPEB2 splicing mechanism to suppress inclusion of exon 4 would likely inhibit these key survival mechanisms related to cancer metastasis. These types of therapies would be predicted to have limited side effects as normal, nontransformed cells do not normally express CPEB2B. The present study also demonstrates major roles for both HIF1α and TWIST1 in TNBC tumor maintenance/growth (HIF1α) and metastasis (TWIST1). To date, the literature on the role of TWIST1 and HIF1α in TNBC has been limited, with HIF1α even playing a paradoxical role as a modifier of the tumor suppressing function of PRC2 (17Regan Anderson T.M. Ma S.H. Raj G.V. Cidlowski J.A. Helle T.M. Knutson T.P. Krutilina R.I. Seagroves T.N. Lange C.A.

Inhibition of iNOS as a novel effective targeted therapy against triple-negative breast cancer.Breast Cancer Res. 2015; 17: 25Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In this study, a major role was identified for TWIST1 in both the AnR and downstream metastasis of TNBC, as down-regulation of this DNA trans-factor led to significant loss of AnR and, subsequently, a reduction in the metastatic rate enhanced by CPEB2B expression. Down-regulation of HIF1α, on the other hand, led to a profound effect on tumor growth, because even after 60 days, tumors did not reach the size of their control shRNA counterparts, and indeed, some tumors regressed (data not shown). Hence, the requirement for HIF1α expression may be limited to tumor growth/maintenance, whereas the requirement for TWIST1 expression leads to TNBC metastasis. The requirement for these two related cellular pathways suggests a link between CPEB2 AS and possibly the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) system. For example, iNOS inhibitors also significantly reduce the tumor growth and lung metastases of TNBC cells, which correlated with the impairment of HIF1α and TWIST1 expression and signaling (20Finlay J. Roberts C.M. Lowe G. Loeza J. Rossi J.J. Glackin C.A. RNA-based TWIST1 inhibition via dendrimer complex to reduce breast cancer cell metastasis.Biomed. Res.

Thus, one can speculate that iNOS may regulate CPEB2 AS or vice versa. Indeed, iNOS has been linked to breast cancer progression along with TWIST1. Furthermore, HIF1α has also been linked to iNOS via a normoxic pathway induced by chemotherapy, an efficacy-limiting event (22Hsia T.C. Liu W.H. Qiu W.W. Luo J. Yin M.C. Maslinic acid induces mitochondrial apoptosis and suppresses HIF-1α expression in A549 lung cancer cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions.Molecules. 2014; 19: 19892-19906Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, validation of a signaling link between CPEB2 AS and iNOS would logically suggest that the targeting of CPEB2 AS in combination with current first-line therapies may greatly improve initial efficacy and overall durability of these treatments. In conclusion, our data indicate that CPEB2A and CPEB2B have opposing effects on the hypoxia/EMT/cell motility signaling axis (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the induction of these pathways are critical for the ability of CPEB2B to impart AnR and, thereby, a higher metastatic rate to breast cancer cells. Lastly, our study shows that the ability of CPEB2B to activate these pathways is via enhancement of the translation of TWIST1 and HIF1α mRNAs. Overall, this study when coupled to our previous study showing the high expression of CPEB2B in aggressive breast cancers suggests that this splicing event is a plausible therapeutic target for metastatic breast cancer.

Therefore, we molecularly characterized clinical isolates of C.difficile from patients with suspicion of C.difficile infection (CDI) in three tertiary care hospitals. C.difficile was isolated from stool samples by culture, the presence of A/B toxins were detected by enzyme immunoassay, cytotoxicity was tested by cell culture and the antimicrobial susceptibility determined. After DNA extraction, tcdA, tcdB and binary toxin (CDTa/CDTb) genes were detected by PCR, and PCR-ribotyping performed. From a total of 913 stool samples collected during 2013-2014, 775 were included in the study. The frequency of A/B toxins-positive samples was 9.7% (75/775). A total of 143 isolates of C.difficile were recovered from culture, 110 (76.9%) produced cytotoxic effect in cell culture, 100 (69.9%) were tcdA+/tcdB+, 11 (7.7%) tcdA-/tcdB+, 32 (22.4%) tcdA-/tcdB- and 25 (17.5%) CDTa+/CDTb+. From 37 ribotypes identified, ribotypes 591 (20%), 106 (9%) and 002 (7.9%) were the most prevalent; only one isolate corresponded to ribotype 027, four to ribotype 078 and four were new ribotypes (794,795, 804,805). All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and metronidazole, while 85% and 7.7% were resistant to clindamycin and moxifloxacin, respectively. By multivariate analysis, significant risk factors associated to CDI were, staying in orthopedic service, exposure to third-generation cephalosporins and staying in an ICU before CDI symptoms; moreover, steroids showed to be a protector factor.

Although CtsB was reported to promote and reduce angiogenesis, there is no mechanistic explanation that reconciles this apparent discrepancy. CtsB cleaves CD18 from the surface of immune cells, but its contribution to angiogenesis has not been studied. We developed an in vivo technique for visualization of immune cell transmigration from corneal vessels toward implanted cytokines. Wild-type (WT) leukocytes extravasated from limbal vessels, angiogenic stalks, and growing tip vessels and migrated toward the cytokines, indicating immune competence of angiogenic vessels. Compared to WT leukocytes, CtsB−/− leukocytes accumulated in a higher number in angiogenic vessels, but extravasated less toward the implanted cytokine. The accumulated CtsB−/− leukocytes in angiogenic vessels expressed more CD18. CD18−/− leukocytes extravasated later than WT leukocytes. However, once extravasated, CD18−/− leukocytes transmigrated more rapidly than their WT counterparts. These results suggest that, although CD18 facilitates efficient extravasation, outside of the vessel CD18 interaction with the extracellular matrix, it reduced transmigration velocity. Our results reveal an unexpected role for CtsB in leukocyte extravasation and transmigration, which advances our understanding of the complex contribution of CtsB to angiogenesis.— Nakao, S., Zandi, S., Sun, D., Hafezi-Moghadam, A.

https://openalex.org/W2756002994,"Mormyrid weakly electric fish produce short, pulse-type electric organ discharges for actively probing their environment and to communicate with conspecifics. Animals emit sequences of pulse-trains that vary in overall frequency and temporal patterning and can lead to time-locked interactions with the discharge activity of other individuals. Both active electrolocation and electrocommunication are additionally accompanied by stereotypical locomotor patterns. However, the concrete roles of electrical and locomotor patterns during social interactions in mormyrids are not well understood. Here we used a mobile fish dummy that was emitting different types of electrical playback sequences to study following behavior and interaction patterns (electrical and locomotor) between individuals of weakly electric fish. We confronted single individuals of Mormyrus rume proboscirostris with a mobile dummy fish designed to attract fish from a shelter and recruit them into an open area by emitting electrical playbacks of natural discharge sequences. We found that fish were reliably recruited by the mobile dummy if it emitted electrical signals and followed it largely independently of the presented playback patterns. While following the dummy, fish interacted with it spatially by displaying stereotypical motor patterns, as well as electrically, e.g. through discharge regularizations and by synchronizing their own discharge activity to the playback. However, the overall emission frequencies of the dummy were not adopted by the following fish. Instead, social signals based on different temporal patterns were emitted depending on the type of playback. In particular, double pulses were displayed in response to electrical signaling of the dummy and their expression was positively correlated with an animals' rank in the dominance hierarchy. Based on additional analysis of swimming trajectories and stereotypical locomotor behavior patterns, we conclude that the reception and emission of electrical communication signals play a crucial role in mediating social interactions in mormyrid weakly electric fish."
https://openalex.org/W2756159965,"Utilizing a rat model of ischemic stroke, we have previously shown that sensory stimulation can completely protect rats from impending ischemic damage of cortex if this treatment is delivered within the first two hours post-permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAo). The current study sought to extend our findings in rats to mice, which would allow new avenues of research not available in rats. Thus, young adult C57BL/6J and CD1 mice were tested for protection from ischemic stroke with the same protective sensory stimulation-based treatment. Cortical activity and blood flow were assessed with intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI) and laser speckle imaging (LSI), respectively, and histological analysis (TTC) was performed at the completion of the experiments. Standing in stark contrast to the positive results observed in rats, in both strains we found that there were no differences between treated and untreated mice at 24 hours post-pMCAo in terms of infarct volume, negative functional imaging results, and major reduction in retrograde collateral blood flow as compared to pre-pMCAo baseline and surgical controls. Also, no differences were found between the strains in terms of theses variables. Potential reasons for the differences between rats and mice are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2756119721,"We present an in-silico model of avascular poroelastic tumour growth coupled with a multiscale biphasic description of the tumour-host environment. The model is specified to in-vitro data, facilitating biophysically realistic simulations of tumour spheroid growth into a dense collagen hydrogel. We use the model to first confirm that passive mechanical remodelling of collagen fibres at the tumour boundary is driven by solid stress, and not fluid pressure. The model is then used to demonstrate the influence of collagen microstructure on peritumoural permeability and interstitial fluid flow. Our model suggests that at the tumour periphery, remodelling causes the peritumoural stroma to become more permeable in the circumferential than radial direction, and the interstitial fluid velocity is found to be dependent on initial collagen alignment. Finally we show that solid stresses are negatively correlated with peritumoural permeability, and positively correlated with interstitial fluid velocity. These results point to a heterogeneous, microstructure-dependent force environment at the tumour-peritumoural stroma interface."
https://openalex.org/W2755461418,"PI3Kγ has emerged as a promising target for the treatment of obesity and insulin resistance; however, previous studies have indicated that PI3Kγ activity in pancreatic β cells is required for normal insulin secretion in response to glucose. Hence, a possible deterioration of insulin secretion capacity in patients who are predisposed to the failure of pancreatic β-cell function is a major concern for the pharmacologic inhibition of PI3Kγ. To address this issue, we investigated the effects of PI3Kγ ablation in db/db diabetic mice, a genetic model of obesity-driven β-cell failure and diabetes. Mice that lacked PI3Kγ were backcrossed into db/+ mice C57BL/KS (>10 generations) to obtain db/db-PI3Kγ-/- mice. db/db-PI3Kγ-/- mice and control db/db mice were phenotyped for glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, steatosis, metabolic inflammation, pancreatic islet morphometry, islet cellular composition, and inflammation. Pancreatic p-cell apoptosis and proliferation were also evaluated. db/db-PI3Kγ-/- mice and control db/db mice developed similar body weight, steatosis, glycemia, and insulin levels after a glucose load; however, db/db-PI3Kγ-/- mice displayed improved insulin tolerance, higher levels of fasting serum insulin, and lower pancreatic insulin content. In db/db-PI3Kγ-/- mice, the number of adipose tissue macrophages was similar to control, but displayed reduced adipose tissue neutrophils and M2-polarized adipose tissue gene expression. Finally, db/db-PI3Kγ-/- mice have more pancreatic β cells and larger islets than db/db mice, despite displaying similar islet inflammation. This phenotype could be explained by reduced β-cell apoptosis in db/db-PI3Kγ-/- mice compared with control db/db mice. Our results are consistent with the concept that the beneficial action of PI3Kγ ablation in obesity-driven glucose intolerance is largely a result of its leptin-dependent effects on adiposity and, to a lesser extent, the promotion of adipose tissue neutrophil recruitment and M1 polarization of gene expression. Of importance, our data challenge the concept that PI3Kγ is required for insulin secretion in response to glucose in vivo, and indicate that PI3Kγ ablation protects db/db mice from β-cell apoptosis and improves fasting insulin levels. We conclude that PI3Kγ inhibition in obese patients who are predisposed to β-cell failure is not expected to produce adverse effects on insulin secretion.—Breasson, L., Sardi, C., Becattini, B., Zani, F., Solinas, G.

https://openalex.org/W2755389414,"We explored the potential of airborne laser scanner (ALS) data to improve Bayesian models linking biodiversity indicators of the understory vegetation to environmental factors. Biodiversity was studied at plot level and models were built to investigate species abundance for the most abundant plants found on each study site, and for ecological group richness based on light preference. The usual abiotic explanatory factors related to climate, topography and soil properties were used in the models. ALS data, available for two contrasting study sites, were used to provide biotic factors related to forest structure, which was assumed to be a key driver of understory biodiversity. Several ALS variables were found to have significant effects on biodiversity indicators. However, the responses of biodiversity indicators to forest structure variables, as revealed by the Bayesian model outputs, were shown to be dependent on the abiotic environmental conditions characterizing the study areas. Lower responses were observed on the lowland site than on the mountainous site. In the latter, shade-tolerant and heliophilous species richness was impacted by vegetation structure indicators linked to light penetration through the canopy. However, to reveal the full effects of forest structure on biodiversity indicators, forest structure would need to be measured over much wider areas than the plot we assessed. It seems obvious that the forest structure surrounding the field plots can impact biodiversity indicators measured at plot level. Various scales were found to be relevant depending on: the biodiversity indicators that were modelled, and the ALS variable. Finally, our results underline the utility of lidar data in abundance and richness models to characterize forest structure with variables that are difficult to measure in the field, either due to their nature or to the size of the area they relate to."
https://openalex.org/W2755858372,"Mixed dispersal strategies are a form of bet hedging in which a species or population utilizes different dispersal strategies dependent upon biotic or abiotic conditions. Here we provide an example of a mixed dispersal strategy in the Aedes albopictus / Ascogregarina taiwanensis host/parasite system, wherein upon host emergence, the gregarine parasite is either carried with an adult mosquito leaving the larval habitat, or released back into the larval habitat. We show that the parasite invests a larger proportion of its dispersing (oocyst) life stage into adult female mosquitoes as opposed to adult male mosquitoes at low parasite exposure levels. However, as the exposure level of parasite increases, so does the parasite investment in adult males, whereas there is no change in the proportion of oocysts in the adult female, regardless of dose. Thus, A. taiwanensis is utilizing several dispersal strategies, depending upon host sex and intraspecific density. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this parasite reduces body size, increases time to emergence in females, and leads to a reduction in estimates of per capita growth rate of the host."
https://openalex.org/W2756095736,"The cytoprotective protein clusterin is often dysregulated during tumorigenesis, and in the stomach, upregulation of clusterin marks emergence of the oxyntic atrophy (loss of acid-producing parietal cells)-associated spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM). The hormone gastrin is important for normal function and maturation of the gastric oxyntic mucosa and hypergastrinemia might be involved in gastric carcinogenesis. Gastrin induces expression of clusterin in adenocarcinoma cells. In the present study, we examined the expression patterns and gastrin-mediated regulation of clusterin in gastric tissue from: humans; rats treated with proton pump (H+/K+-ATPase) inhibitors and/or a gastrin receptor (CCK2R) antagonist; H+/K+-ATPase β-subunit knockout (H/K-β KO) mice; and Mongolian gerbils infected with Helicobacter pylori and given a CCK2R antagonist. Biological function of secretory clusterin was studied in human gastric cancer cells. Clusterin was highly expressed in neuroendocrine cells in normal oxyntic mucosa of humans and rodents. In response to hypergastrinemia, expression of clusterin increased significantly and its localization shifted to basal groups of proliferative cells in the mucous neck cell-chief cell lineage in all animal models. That shift was partially inhibited by antagonizing the CCK2R in rats and gerbils. The oxyntic mucosa of H/K-β KO mice contained areas with clusterin-positive mucous cells resembling SPEM. In gastric adenocarcinomas, clusterin mRNA expression was higher in diffuse tumors containing signet ring cells compared with diffuse tumors without signet ring cells, and clusterin seemed to be secreted by tumor cells. In gastric cancer cell lines, gastrin increased secretion of clusterin, and both gastrin and secretory clusterin promoted survival after starvation- and chemotherapy-induced stress. Overall, our results indicate that clusterin is overexpressed in hypergastrinemic rodent models of oxyntic preneoplasia and stimulates gastric cancer cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W2754876693,"Dysferlin is a large transmembrane protein that plays a key role in cell membrane repair and underlies a recessive form of inherited muscular dystrophy. Dysferlinopathy is characterized by absence or marked reduction of dysferlin protein with 43% of reported pathogenic variants being missense variants that span the length of the dysferlin protein. The unique structure of dysferlin, with seven tandem C2 domains separated by linkers, suggests dysferlin may dynamically associate with phospholipid membranes in response to Ca2+ signaling. However, the overall conformation of the dysferlin protein is uncharacterized. To dissect the structural architecture of dysferlin, we have applied the method of limited proteolysis, which allows nonspecific digestion of unfolded peptides by trypsin. Using five antibodies spanning the dysferlin protein, we identified a highly reproducible jigsaw map of dysferlin fragments protected from digestion. Our data infer a modular architecture of four tertiary domains: 1) C2A, which is readily removed as a solo domain; 2) midregion C2B-C2C-Fer-DysF, commonly excised as an intact module, with subdigestion to different fragments suggesting several dynamic folding options; 3) C-terminal four-C2 domain module; and 4) calpain-cleaved mini-dysferlinC72, which is particularly resistant to proteolysis. Importantly, we reveal a patient missense variant, L344P, that largely escapes proteasomal surveillance and shows subtle but clear changes in tertiary conformation. Accompanying evidence from immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry using antibodies with conformationally sensitive epitopes supports proteolysis data. Collectively, we provide insight into the structural topology of dysferlin and show how a single missense mutation within dysferlin can exert local changes in tertiary conformation."
https://openalex.org/W2756260124,"Consumption of ergot alkaloid-containing tall fescue grass impairs several metabolic, vascular, growth, and reproductive processes in cattle, collectively producing a clinical condition known as “fescue toxicosis.” Despite the apparent association between pituitary function and these physiological parameters, including depressed serum prolactin; no reports describe the effect of fescue toxicosis on pituitary genomic expression profiles. To identify candidate regulatory mechanisms, we compared the global and selected targeted mRNA expression patterns of pituitaries collected from beef steers that had been randomly assigned to undergo summer-long grazing (89 to 105 d) of a high-toxic endophyte-infected tall fescue pasture (HE; 0.746 μg/g ergot alkaloids; 5.7 ha; n = 10; BW = 267 ± 14.5 kg) or a low-toxic endophyte tall fescue–mixed pasture (LE; 0.023 μg/g ergot alkaloids; 5.7 ha; n = 9; BW = 266 ± 10.9 kg). As previously reported, in the HE steers, serum prolactin and body weights decreased and a potential for hepatic gluconeogenesis from amino acid-derived carbons increased. In this manuscript, we report that the pituitaries of HE steers had 542 differentially expressed genes (P < 0.001, false discovery rate ≤ 4.8%), and the pattern of altered gene expression was dependent (P < 0.001) on treatment. Integrated Pathway Analysis revealed that canonical pathways central to prolactin production, secretion, or signaling were affected, in addition to those related to corticotropin-releasing hormone signaling, melanocyte development, and pigmentation signaling. Targeted RT-PCR analysis corroborated these findings, including decreased (P < 0.05) expression of DRD2, PRL, POU1F1, GAL, and VIP and that of POMC and PCSK1, respectively. Canonical pathway analysis identified HE-dependent alteration in signaling of additional pituitary-derived hormones, including growth hormone and GnRH. We conclude that consumption of endophyte-infected tall fescue alters the pituitary transcriptome profiles of steers in a manner consistent with their negatively affected physiological parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2755081114,"One of the primary transcriptional regulators of fatty acid homeostasis in many prokaryotes is the protein FadR. To better understand its biological function in the extreme thermophile Thermus thermophilus HB8, we sought to first determine its preferred DNA-binding sequences in vitro using the combinatorial selection method Restriction Endonuclease Protection, Selection, and Amplification (REPSA) and then use this information to bioinformatically identify potential regulated genes. REPSA determined a consensus FadR-binding sequence 5´-TTRNACYNRGTNYAA-3´, which was further characterized using quantitative electrophoretic mobility shift assays. With this information, a search of the T. thermophilus HB8 genome found multiple operons potentially regulated by FadR. Several of these were identified as encoding proteins involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation; however, others were novel and not previously identified as targets of FadR. The role of FadR in regulating these genes was validated by physical and functional methods, as well as comparative genomic approaches to further characterize regulons in related organisms. Taken together, our study demonstrates that a systematic approach involving REPSA, biophysical characterization of protein-DNA binding, and bioinformatics can be used to postulate biological roles for potential transcriptional regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2755699298,"We recently reported the aptitude of a membrane-active lipopeptide (C10OOc12O) to sensitize gram-negative bacilli (GNB) to host antibacterial proteins. Here we explored the potential of harnessing such capacity in the presence of antibiotics. For this purpose, we compared Escherichia coli sensitization to antibiotics in broth and plasma; assessed inner and outer membrane damages using scanning electron microscopy, dyes, and mutant strains; and assessed the ability to affect disease course using the mouse peritonitis-sepsis model for mono- and combination therapies. We found that by altering permeability of both outer and inner membranes, subinhibitory concentrations of C10OOc12O can transiently sensitize GNB to diverse cytoplasm-targeting antibiotics in simple media. Sensitization was maintained in plasma, where C10OOc12O instigated greater bactericidal activities, including in the presence of a bacteriostatic antibiotic (erythromycin). Single-dose administrations of rifampin and C10OOc12O to E. coli-infected mice resulted in 55% vs. 0, and 36% viability, respectively, for combined and individual treatments. Combining C10OOc12O and erythromycin has similarly improved mice protection from developing fatal sepsis. Consequently, the data confirmed that C10OOc12O renders GNB sensitive to both endogenous and exogenous antibacterials, and suggested that the tripartite concomitant presence increases therapeutic efficacy synergistically. This approach might expand the available treatment options to comprise antimicrobials with low permeability and/or efflux issues.-Jammal, J., Zaknoon, F., Mor, A.

https://openalex.org/W2753986084,"In order to obtain a coherent representation of the outside world, auditory and visual information are integrated during human information processing. There is remarkable variance among observers in the capability to integrate auditory and visual information. Here, we propose that visuo-perceptual capabilities predict detection performance for audiovisually coinciding transients in multi-element displays due to severe capacity limitations in audiovisual integration. In the reported experiment, we employed an individual differences approach in order to investigate this hypothesis. Therefore, we measured performance in a useful-field-of-view task that captures detection performance for briefly presented stimuli across a large perceptual field. Furthermore, we measured sensitivity for visual direction changes that coincide with tones within the same participants. Our results show that individual differences in visuo-perceptual capabilities predicted sensitivity for the presence of audiovisually synchronous events among competing visual stimuli. To ensure that this correlation does not stem from superordinate factors, we also tested performance in an unrelated working memory task. Performance in this task was independent of sensitivity for the presence of audiovisually synchronous events. Our findings strengthen the proposed link between visuo-perceptual capabilities and audiovisual integration. The results also suggest that basic visuo-perceptual capabilities provide the basis for the subsequent integration of auditory and visual information."
https://openalex.org/W2754176302,"Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons provide α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), which stimulates melanocortin 4 receptor to induce hypophagia by AMPK inhibition in the hypothalamus. α-MSH is produced by POMC cleavage in secretory granules and released. However, it is not known yet whether any posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism of POMC signaling exists upstream of the secretory granules in neurons. Here we show that glutamate transporter-associated protein 3-18 (GTRAP3-18), an anchor protein that retains interacting proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, is a critical regulator of food intake and body weight by interacting with POMC. GTRAP3-18-deficient mice showed hypophagia, lean bodies, and lower blood glucose, insulin, and leptin levels with increased serum and brain α-MSH levels, leading to AMPK inhibition. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests revealed significantly decreased blood glucose levels and areas under the curve in GTRAP3-18-deficient mice compared to wild-type mice. An intracerebroventricular infusion of a selective melanocortin 4 receptor antagonist to GTRAP3-18-deficient mice significantly increased their food intake and body weight. A fluorescence resonance energy transfer study showed an interaction between GTRAP3-18 and POMC in vitro These findings suggest that activation of the melanocortin pathway by modulating GTRAP3-18/POMC interaction could be an alternative strategy for obesity and/or type 2 diabetes.-Aoyama, K., Bhadhprasit, W., Watabe, M., Wang, F., Matsumura, N., Nakaki, T.

We studied geographical variation in larval spine length of the dragonfly Leucorrhinia dubia across Western Europe using a phylogenetic approach. Larvae were raised in a common garden laboratory experiment in the absence of fish predators. Results show that larvae from northern Europe (Sweden and Finland) had significantly longer larval spines compared to larvae from western and central Europe.

Species of Glossina differ in vector competence and Glossina morsitans morsitans is associated with transmission of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, which causes an acute and often fatal form of African Trypanosomiasis. Heat shock proteins are evolutionarily conserved proteins that play critical roles in proteostasis. The activity of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is regulated by interactions with its J-protein (Hsp40) co-chaperones. Inhibition of these interactions are emerging as potential therapeutic targets. The assembly and annotation of the G. m. morsitans genome provided a platform to identify and characterize the Hsp70s and J-proteins, and carry out an evolutionary comparison to its well-studied eukaryotic counterparts, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens, as well as Stomoxys calcitrans, a comparator species. In our study, we identified 9 putative Hsp70 proteins and 37 putative J-proteins in G. m. morsitans. Phylogenetic analyses revealed three evolutionarily distinct groups of Hsp70s, with a closer relationship to orthologues from its blood-feeding dipteran relative Stomoxys calcitrans. G. m. morsitans also lacked the high number of heat inducible Hsp70s found in D. melanogaster. The potential localisations, functions, domain organisations and Hsp70/J-protein partnerships were also identified.

Pharmacologic treatment is used for the control of post-operative atrial arrhythmias (POAA), but is associated with side effects. There is a need for a reversible, modulated solution to rate control. We propose a non-pharmacologic technique that can modulate AV nodal conduction in a selective fashion. Ten mongrel dogs underwent OHS. Stimulation of the anterior right (AR) and inferior right (IR) fat pad (FP) was done using a 7-pole electrode. The IR was more effective in slowing the ventricular rate (VR) to AF (52 +/- 20 vs. 15 +/- 10%, p = 0.003) and JET (12 +/- 7 vs. 0 +/- 0%, p = 0.02). Selective site stimulation within a FP region could augment the effect of stimulation during AF (57 +/- 20% (maximum effect) vs. 0 +/- 0% (minimum effect), p<0.001). FP stimulation at increasing stimulation voltage (SV) demonstrated a voltage-dependent effect (8 +/- 14% (low V) vs. 63 +/- 17 (high V) %, p<0.001). In summary, AV node fat pad stimulation had a selective effect on the AV node by decreasing AV nodal conduction, with little effect on atrial activity."
