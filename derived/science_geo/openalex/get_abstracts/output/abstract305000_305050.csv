https://openalex.org/W2035166278,"Most plant communities consist of several or many species which compete for light, water, and nutrients. Species in a given community may be ranked by their relative success in competition; productivity seems to be the best measure of their success or importance in the community. Curves of decreasing productivity connect the few most important species (the dominants) with a larger number of species of intermediate importance (whose number primarily determines the community's diversity or richness in species) and a smaller number of rare species. These curves are of varied forms and are believed to express different patterns of competition and niche differentiation in communities. It is probably true of plants, as of animals, that no two species in a stable community occupy the same niche. Evolution of niche differentiation makes possible the occurrence together of many plant species which are partial, rather than direct, competitors. Species tend to evolve also toward habitat differentiation, toward scattering of their centers of maximum population density in relation to environmental gradients, so that few species are competing with one another in their population centers. Evolution of both niche and habitat differentiation permits many species to exist together in communities as partial competitors, with distributions broadly and continuously overlapping, forming the landscape's many intergrading communities."

Large plastic deformations can be produced without fracture. The predominant mechanism of deformation is translation gliding. The preferred explanation for this anomalous weakness is that this synthetic quartz contains water which has hydrolyzed the silicon-oxygen bonds. The silanol groups so formed are presumed to be rendered sufficiently mobile by elevating the temperature to 400 degrees C so that they align themselves in dislocation lines and move through the crystal with the dislocation under the small applied shear stress."

Electron microscopy shows that the epicuticle is penetrated by filaments of wax 60 to 130 Å in diameter. These are believed to be lipid-water liquid crystals in the middle phase. The variable permeability to water, and other properties of the cuticle, may be due to phase changes."

By proper rewarding (positive reinforcement) and evocative techniques, such vocal emissions can be changed from the natural patterns. One such group of new sounds is said to resemble the human voice (""vocal mimicry""). Apects of these sounds which are physically determinable, specifiable, and demonstrable are the similarities in numbers of bursts of sound emitted by man and dolphin and in durations of successive emissions. In 92 percent of the exchanges the number of bursts emitted by Tursiops equalled, +/-1, the number just previously emitted by a man in sequences of one to ten bursts."

After delivery of at least one litter, the parous females exhibited normal immune reactions to sheep erythrocytes and skin homografts. The transplacental passage of a humoral substance from the thymus glands of the developing fetuses is suggested as the mechanism responsible for the restoration of immunological responsiveness in neonatally thymectomized parous female mice."

In preference tests with moving models, other preferences appear to over-ride the effects of the imprinting experience."
https://openalex.org/W1989359206,"Recognition of early human industries takes on significance with the realization that commitment to tools is the novel adaptive design accounting for the emergence of man. The most abundant evidence for the emergence of man consists of the stones that he refashioned. But recognizing these objects is a problem, as they are both rare and similar to the stones of the environments in which they occur. Because the validity of a procedural, or course-of-action, approach to the problem of recognition can be demonstrated, such an approach is preferable to the intuitive and heuristic approaches that have dominated attempts to deal with the possible traces of early man."

The concentrations of airborne Ce(144)-Pr(144), Sb(125), Cs(137), Zr(95)-Nb(95), Mn(54), and Ru(106)-Rh(106) in each size group were determined by gamma spectral analysis. Particles having diameters of less than 1.75 microns contained a minimum of 88 percent of the total activity."

https://openalex.org/W2063421369,"The diketone 2,5-hexanedione has been isolated as a product of the thermal oxidation of cis-1,4-polysioprene and of copolymers of ethylene and propylene. This is confirmatory evidence for the formation of acetonyl radicals during oxidation of these polymers and their reaction with each other in the presence of oxygen as postulated earlier."
