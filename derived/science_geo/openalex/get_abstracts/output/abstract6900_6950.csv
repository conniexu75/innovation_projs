https://openalex.org/W1498697464,"Mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation were compared in whole liver homogenates. Oxidation of 0.2 mM palmitoyl-CoA or oleate by mitochondria increased rapidly with increasing molar substrate:albumin ratios and became saturated at ratios below 3, while peroxisomal oxidation increased more slowly and continued to rise to reach maximal activity in the absence of albumin. Under the latter condition mitochondrial oxidation was severely depressed. In homogenates from normal liver peroxisomal oxidation was lower than mitochondrial oxidation at all ratios tested except when albumin was absent. In contrast with mitochondrial oxidation, peroxisomal oxidation did not produce ketones, was cyanide-insensitive, was not dependent on carnitine, and was not inhibited by (+)-octanoylcarnitine, malonyl-CoA and 4-pentenoate. Mitochondrial oxidation was inhibited by CoASH concentrations that were optimal for peroxisomal oxidation. In the presence of albumin, peroxisomal oxidation was stimulated by Triton X-100 but unaffected by freeze-thawing; both treatments suppressed mitochondrial oxidation. Clofibrate treatment increased mitochondrial and peroxisomal oxidation 2- and 6- to 8-fold, respectively. Peroxisomal oxidation remained unchanged in starvation and diabetes. Fatty acid oxidation was severely depressed by cyanide and (+)-octanoylcarnitine in hepatocytes from normal rats. Hepatocytes from clofibrate-treated rats, which displayed a 3- to 4-fold increase in fatty acid oxidation, were less inhibited by (+)-octanoylcarnitine. Hydrogen peroxide production was severalfold higher in hepatocytes from treated animals oxidizing fatty acids than in control hepatocytes. Assuming that all H2O2 produced during fatty acid oxidation was due to peroxisomal oxidation, it was calculated that the contribution of the peroxisomes to fatty acid oxidation was less than 10% both in cells from control and clofibrate-treated animals."

https://openalex.org/W1600148840,"Two different sialyltransferases (EC 2.4.99.1) have been resolved from Triton X-100 extracts of porcine submaxillary glands by affinity chromatography on CDP-hexanolamine agarose. The predominant sialyltransferase of this tissue, a CMP-N-acetylneuraminate: alpha-D-N-acetylgalactosaminide alpha2 leads to 6 sialyltransferase, has been obtained in a partially purified and stable form. A less abundant but highly active enzyme, a CMP-N-acetylneuraminate: beta-D-galactoside alpha2 leads to 3 sialyltransferase, was purified over 90,000-fold to homogeneity. Chromatography of the latter enzyme on Sephadex G-200 separated two noninterconverting forms, designated A and B, with Stokes radii of 51 A and 31 A, respectively. Both forms have equal specific activity toward lactose and contain a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of about 50,000 as estimated by gel electrophoresis. Form A appears to bind 1.18 g of Triton X-100 per g of protein, or nearly an entire detergent micelle per polypeptide, while Form B binds little or no detergent. The enzymatic properties of both forms are similar (Rearick, J.I., Sadler, J.E., Paulson, J.C., and Hill, R.L. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 4444-4451) supporting the conclusion that Form A may represent the native sialyltransferase with an intact membrane-binding site, and Form B may be a large proteolytic fragment of Form A."
https://openalex.org/W1533339726,"Binding of thrombin to monolayer cultures of human umbilical vein endothelium is studied. Binding is measured as inhibition by unlabeled ligand of the binding of 125I-thrombin to the cells. Radioactivity bound to cultures at equilibrium is measured after draining but not washing the cells. To correct for unremoved supernatant, 131I-albumin is included as a second label in the medium. Equilibrium between bound and free thrombin is attained within 1 min, and Scatchard analysis indicates a population of approximately 3 x 10(3) sites/cell with a dissociation constant of 10(-10) M, and a larger population with a dissociation constant greater than 10(-8) M. The two populations of sites are also indicated by a biphasic dissociation of bound label. Thrombin inactivated with diisopropyl fluorophosphate binds to the same receptor, with an affinity similar to that of active thrombin. Binding is unaffected by albumin (an acidic protein) and cytochrome c (a basic protein). Cultures of umbilical cord smooth muscle and fibroblasts bind thrombin at least 100 times more weakly than endothelium, and no binding to erythrocytes or a monolayer culture of mouse neuroblastoma is detected."
https://openalex.org/W1601029230,"The specific glucocorticoid binding capacity in cytosol preparations of rat thymocytes decays with a half-life of 4 h at 0 degrees C or 20 min at 25 degrees C. Phosphatase inhibitors (molybdate, fluoride, glucose 1-phosphate) added alone do not prevent this inactivation. Dithiothreitol (2 mM) has a large stabilizing effect on the binding capacity at 0 degrees C but only a small effect at 25 degrees C. Addition of 10 mM molybdate plus 2 mM dithiothreitol totally prevents inactivation for at least 8 h at 25 degrees C as well as at 0 degrees C. Fluoride (100 mM) also retards the inactivation if added with dithiothreitol. Addition of dithiothreitol at 25 degrees C to inactivated cytosol receptors results in partial activation of the binding capacity. Addition of dithiothreitol to receptors inactivated at 25 degrees C in the presence of molybdate allows total reactivation of the binding capacity to the maximum zero time value. If binding capacity is inactivated by preincubation of the cytosol at 25 degrees C, addition of ATP with dithiothreitol enhances the activation observed with only dithiothreitol. This ATP stimulated activation is optimal at 1 to 3 mM. ATP (10 mM) is required when molybdate is added to prevent simultaneous inactivation. ADP, GTP, CTP, and UTP have some activating capacity but the effects of all nucleotides are inhibited by the ATP analog, adenyl-5‘-yl (beta, gamma-methylene)diphosphonate. ATP-dependent activation can also be prevented with 50 mM EDTA, and addition of magnesium partially overcomes the EDTA inhibition. Dithiothreitol activation of thymocyte glucocorticoid binding capacity can also be enhanced by addition of a heat-stable preparation from thymocytes, L cells, or liver. Sephadex G-25 chromatography, assay of ATP, and inhibition of the activation with adenyl-5‘-yl (beta, gamma-methylene)diphosphonate suggest that these preparations contain varying amounts of endogenous reducing equivalents and ATP as well as a larger heat stable factor. Maximum activation is obtained by adding dithiothreitol, ATP, molybdate, and the larger heat-stable factor. These results suggest that stabilization and activation of glucocorticoid binding capacity in thymocytes requires phosphorylation as well as reduction of the receptor itself or of some other component required for the steroid binding reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1895563716,"The substrate requirements, linkage specificity, and kinetic mechanism of a pure sialyltransferase from porcine submaxillary glands have been examined. The enzyme transfers sialic acid from the donor nucleotide, CMP-NeuAc, into the sequence NeuAcalpha2 leads to 3Galbeta1 leads to 3GalNAc, which is found in both glycoproteins and gangliosides. It forms only the alpha2 leads to 3 linkage with the disaccharide Gal/beta1 leads to 3GalNAc or antifreeze glycoprotein, which, along with asialoglycoproteins containing the sequence Gal/beta1 leads to 3GalNAcalpha1 leads to O-Thr/Ser, are the best acceptor substrates. Low molecular weight galactosides linked beta1 leads to 3 to glycose residues other than N-acetylgalactosamine are poor acceptors with relatively high Km values, while those in beta1 leads to 4 or beta1 leads to 6 linkages have both high Km and low Vmax. With glycoprotein and ganglioside acceptors this substrate specificity appears to be even more strict, with the sequence Gal/beta1 leads to 3GalNAc serving as the exclusive acceptor. Thus the present enzyme is not responsible either for the sequence, NeuAcalpha2 leads to 3Galbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAc, found in the asparagine-linked chains of certain glycoproteins, or for the synthesis of hematoside, NeuAcalpha2 leads to 3Galbeta1 leads to 4Glcbeta1 leads to 1Cer. Initial rate kinetic studies, with and without inhibitors, suggest that the transferase has an equilibrium random order mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1544472308,"Plasma membrane vesicles isolated from porcine blood platelets take up approximately 8 to 15 pmol of [3H]imipramine per mg of membrane protein. This apparent binding requires Na+ in the external medium and is reversed by 5-hydroxytryptamine and fluoxetine. The apparent KD for imipramine uptake is 23 nM, which agrees well with the KI for competitive inhibition of 5-hydroxytryptamine transport by imipramine. In contrast to 5-hydroxytryptamine transport, imipramine uptake is not dependent on transmembrane Na+ and K+ gradients and is insensitive to ionophores such as nigericin and gramicidin which dissipate these gradients. Although 5-hydroxytryptamine rapidly and competitively displaces imipramine from membrane vesicles, imipramine does not cause 5-hydroxytryptamine efflux and inhibits 5-hydroxytryptamine exchange. These results are consistent with the proposal that imipramine binds to the substrate site of the 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter but cannot be transported."

https://openalex.org/W1654913286,"The major form of kinetoplast DNA in Crithidia fasciculata is a network which contains thousands of minicircles linked together in a two-dimensional array. This paper reports the existence of free minicircles in Crithidia which by several criteria are identical to those in networks. They are the same size (about 2500 base pairs), and they yield the same products upon digestion with restriction enzymes. About 0.4% of the minicircles in exponentially growing nonsynchronized cells are free and the remainder are in networks. After a 5-min pulse with [3H]thymidine, above 10% of all of the incorporated radioactivity in the cell is in free minicircles, and the minicircles have a higher specific radioactivity than the average of other DNAs in the cell. Three-branched structures, which resemble Cairns-type replication intermediates, are occasionally observed by electron microscopy. Kinetic studies of the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into free minicircles indicate that they turn over, and this turnover was confirmed by a pulse-chase experiment. These properties of free minicircles suggest that they may be intermediates in the replication of network minicircles."
https://openalex.org/W1589066506,"Heme oxygenase was purified to apparent homogeneity from liver microsomes of rats which had been treated with either cobaltous chloride or hemin to induce heme oxygenase in the liver and the purified preparations from either rats showed an apparent molecular weight of about 200,000 when estimated by gel filtration on a column of Sephadex G-200, and gave a minimum molecular weight of about 32,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The hepatic heme oxygenase could bind heme to form a heme . heme oxygenase complex showing an absorption peak at 405 nm, and the extinction coefficient at 405 nm of the heme . heme oxygenase complex was 140 mM-1 cm-1. The heme bound to the hepatic heme oxygenase protein was easily converted to biliverdin when the complex was incubated with the NADPH-cytochrome c reductase system in air. The hepatic heme oxygenase appears to have characteristics essentially similar to those of the splenic heme oxygenase (Yoshida, T., and Kikuchi, G. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 4224 and 4230). The heme oxygenase preparation which was purified from the cobalt-treated rats contained a small amount of cobaltic protoporphyrin, indicating that cobalt protoporphyrin was synthesized in these rats."

https://openalex.org/W1579646597,"Fetal epithelioid cells, isolated from human amniotic fluid, synthesize and secrete a type IV-like procollagen characterized by a unique pattern of cyanogen bromide (CNBr)-produced peptides. The procollagen is disulfide-bonded and, after reduction, migrates on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a doublet between collagen beta components and pro-alpha 1(I) chains. No conversion of the procollagen to collagen or to procollagen intermediates is observed in cell culture. The procollagen was purified by salt fractionation and ion exchange chromatography; its amino acid composition resembles that of collagenous proteins extracted from basement membranes, with a high 3- and 4-hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine content and low levels of alanine and arginine. The major products obtained after limited proteolytic digestion of the protein retain interchain disulfide bonds and, after reduction, migrate on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis near intact pro-alpha 1(I) chains. The procollagen is secreted efficiently by amniotic fluid cells despite almost complete inhibition of peptidyl hydroxylation but, unlike type I procollagen, the secreted underhydroxylated chains lack interchain disulfide bonds. Since these cells also secrete fibronectin and elaborate an extensive extracellular matrix, the system should prove useful in the study of cell-matrix interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1499942184,"Abstract Purified cathepsin B from porcine parathyroid glands was allowed to act upon radioactive bovine parathormone and proparathormone at various ratios of enzyme to substrate and for different times. The reaction products were isolated by ion exchange chromatography and analyzed by gel electrophoresis, amino acid composition, sequence analysis, and bioassay. The enzyme cleaved parathormone between residues 36 and 37 yielding a major carboxyl and amino fragment and appeared to cleave proparathormone at the same locus. The amino fragments were degraded further by removal of small peptides (possibly, di- or tripeptides) from their COOH termini. In contrast there was little if any degradation of the carboxyl fragment (residues 37 to 84). Despite the ease with which the enzyme cleaved the arginyl bond in the synthetic substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Lys-Lys-Arg-(4-methoxy)-2-naphthylamide, it did not remove the near homologous NH2-terminal hexapeptide extension of proparathormone (Lys-Ser-Val-Lys-Lys-Arg-R)--a reaction that would lead to the formation of parathormone from proparathormone. Purified liver cathepsin B cleaved the hormonal substrates in a fashion identical with that of the parathyroid enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1560391076,"The complete amino acid sequence of a calcium-binding proline-rich phosphoprotein, named Protein A, from human saliva was determined by automated and manual Edman degradation of peptides obtained by enzymatic and chemical cleavage of the intact protein. The NH2-terminal pyrrolidone carboxylic acid was identified by means of NMR. The protein consists of 106 amino acids, including 24 residues of proline. The NH2-terminal 32 residues contain 13 of the 15 negatively charged residues including 2 phosphoserines, but only 1 proline. In spite of a high concentration of proline in the COOH-terminal part of the molecule, the longest oligoproline sequence is tetraproline. The protein contains a number of repeated sequences and there are also several sequences of 3 or 4 residues identical with known sequences of collagen, but the characteristic occurrence of glycine in every third position in collagen is not found in salivary Protein A."
https://openalex.org/W1635916482,"Fucosidosis is unique among congenital exoglycosidase deficiencies, because not only oligosaccharides but large amount of glycopeptides are excreted in the urine. The structures of 22 major glycopeptides isolated from urine of a fucosidosis patient were determined. One of the prominent features common to all these glycopeptides was that they all contain 1 fucosyl residue at either C-3 or C-6 position of the N-acetylglucosamine which is linked to asparagine. Possibly, accumulation of glycopeptides in fucosidosis urine is caused by the inability of human endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase to cleave the asparagine-linked sugar chains, which have a fucose at the innermost N-acetylglucosamine residue."
https://openalex.org/W1551610456,"Following the rapid enzymatic transfer of an oligosaccharide (GlcNAc2Man9Glc3) from a lipid carrier to endogenous protein acceptors in membrane preparations from NIL fibroblasts, the transferred oligosaccharide chain undergoes processing. Protein-bound oligosaccharides, released from the polypeptide backbone by treatment with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, were analyzed by gel filtration and by susceptibility to alpha-mannosidase digestion. The initial stages of this processing in vitro consist of sequential excision of 3 glucose residues prior to the removal of mannose residues. The array of oligosaccharides generated in vitro by membrane preparations from NIL cells appears to be identical with processed oligosaccharides derived in vivo in intact NIL cells."

https://openalex.org/W1526481208,"Oligomers of hyaluronic acid were prepared by digestion of hyaluronic acid from rooster combs with testicular hyaluronidase (hyaluronate 4-glycanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.35), leech head hyaluronidase (hyaluronate 3-glycanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.36), and with fungal hyaluronidase (hyaluronate lyase from Streptomyces hyalurolyticus). The oligomers were fractionated by gel permeation, using Sephadex G-50. Oligomers isolated after incubation of the hyaluronic acid with the testicular hyaluronidase were further modified. To prepare oligomers with N-acetylglucosamine at both ends, terminal nonreducing glucuronic acid residues were removed with beta-glucuronidase. Reducing terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues were removed by reaction under mildly alkaline conditions. The reducing terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues were also reduced with sodium borohydride to form N-acetylglucosaminitol. The potentials of the various oligosaccharides to bind to the proteoglycan from bovine nasal septum cartilage were estimated by determining their effectiveness as inhibitors of the proteoglycan-hyaluronate interaction. The present study shows that, to bind maximally to the proteoglycan, the hyaluronate oligosaccharide must be at least 10 sugar residues in length and be terminated at the nonreducing and reducing ends with a glucuronate residue and an N-acetylglucosamine residue, respectively. Sugar residues extended beyond this basic decasaccharide, do not interact with the hyaluronate binding site on the proteoglycan."
https://openalex.org/W1633086308,"Synthetic mannose-containing glycolipids utilizing the cholesterol nucleus as a lipid anchor, and either the 6-aminohexyl- or the 6-(6-aminohexanamido)hexyl-1-thio-alpha-D-mannopyranosides as the carbohydrate ligands, have been synthesized and incorporated into small unilamellar liposomes. Incorporation of these cholesterol-mannoside derivatives at concentrations up to 14 mol% apparently does not affect the physical characteristics of the liposomes. Addition of concanavalin A to a suspension of liposomes containing the long chain cholesterol-mannose derivative causes an increase in light-scattering at 360 nm. As the increase in absorbance is completely reversed by the addition of alpha-methylmannoside, aggregation rather than fusion of the liposomes appears to be occurring. Liposomes containing 14 mol % of the short chain (6-aminohexyl-) derivative are aggregated by concanavalin A indicating that the lectin can approach to within 10 A of the lipid bilayer. Preliminary results suggest that the aggregation of vesicles containing either the long or short chain derivatives is highly dependent on the density of the sugar in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1576857995,"A somatic cell mutant of the CHO-K1 cell selected to be resistant to the killing effects of 25-hydroxycholesterol in the absence of cholesterol is shown to be defective in the inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase activity by 25-hydroxycholesterol, cholesterol, and lipoproteins, thus maintaining the enzyme activity found in cells in the absence of exogenous sterol constitutively. The mutants phenotype is shown to be dominant with respect to the wild type. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide prevent the increase of HMG-CoA reductase activity that occurs in the CHO-K1 cell when cholesterol is removed from medium. Degradation of the enzyme, measured during inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide, occurs at the same rate in the mutant as in the wild type. Kinetic studies indicate that the Km for two substrates, the activation energy, and a break in the Arrhenius plot are the same for HMG-CoA reductase determined in wild type and mutant cells. From these studies it is concluded that the mutant is defective in the regulation of synthesis of HMG-CoA reductase. Of the four processes which determine cellular cholesterol levels: biosynthesis, esterification, efflux, and uptake, only biosynthesis is altered, demonstrating that these processes are not co-ordinately controlled as has been suggested previously."
https://openalex.org/W1554141120,"Exposure of HeLa cells to sodium butyrate caused an increase in choleragen (cholera toxin) receptors as measured by increased binding of 125I-choleragen to the intact cells. The process was dependent on time and butyrate concentration; maximal increases (over 40-fold) were observed at 48 h and 5 mM sodium butyrate. Other short chain fatty acids were less effective in elevating choleragen receptors in the order: butyrate greater than pentanoate greater than hexanoate greater than propionate. Acetate and isobutyrate had no effect. The increase in toxin receptors caused by butyrate was reversible and occurred in serum-free medium. The affinity of choleragen for control and butyrate-treated HeLa cells appeared to be similar. Butyrate also induced an elevation in choleragen receptors in rat C6 glial and Friend erythroleukemic cells but not in a butyrate-resistant HeLa mutant. The increase observed in Friend cells paralleled the increase in ganglioside GM1 (galactosyl-N-acetylgalactosaminyl-[N-acetylneuraminyl]-galactosylglucosylceramide), the reported choleragen receptor. Although no GM1 could be detected in untreated Hela cells, small amounts were found in cells exposed to butyrate."
https://openalex.org/W1659735400,"Migration of 40 S ribosomal subunits on messenger RNA, detected previously in experiments using the antibiotic edeine (Kozak, M., and Shatkin, A.J. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 6568-6577) has now been observed in the presence of other inhibitors of initiation. 40 S subunit migration has been detected in both wheat germ and reticulocyte lysates treated with edeine, pactamycin, or sodium fluoride. The variety of structurally unrelated inhibitors that mediate this effect argues against the interpretation that migration is a drug-induced artifact. Indeed, limited migration of 40 S ribosomes occurs upon simply lowering the magnesium concentration, in the absence of inhibitors. Thus, migration seems to be an inherent property of 40 S ribosomal subunits and might be involved in the mechanism by which eukaryotic ribosomes select initiation sites in messenger RNA."

https://openalex.org/W1600393668,"D-Alanine carboxypeptidase (CPase), a detergent-soluble penicillin-sensitive membrane enzyme of Bacillus stearothermophilus, Mr = 46,500, was digested with either trypsin or alpha-chymotrypsin to yield water-soluble fragments, designated T-CPase and Chy-CPase, respectively, each of Mr = approximately 45,000. These fragments were generated and purified in milligram quantities by digestion of CPase covalently immobilized on a penicillin affinity column. They retained full enzymatic activity, became significantly more resistant to thermal inactivation, and lost micellar detergent binding upon proteolysis. Each was derived from CPase by loss of a COOH-terminal hydrophobic peptide. CPase was reconstituted into bacterial lipid vesicles in an enzymatically active form. Penicillin-binding sites were equally distributed on both sides of the lipid bilayer, suggesting a random orientation of the CPase molecules. Neither T-CPase nor Chy-CPase reconstituted into lipid vesicles when treated in an identical manner. CPase was slowly cleaved from the surface of these vesicles by either trypsin or alpha-chymotrypsin, yielding T-CPase and Chy-CPase, respectively. These results demonstrate that CPase is comprised of a water-soluble catalytic domain and a COOH-terminal hydrophobic region which mediates the anchoring of this enzyme to the bacterial membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1671522522,"Nucleoside phosphotransferase from barley seedlings was used to catalyze the equilibration of adenosine-5'-[18O]phosphorothioate having the S configuration at phosphorus with [adenine-8-14C]adenosine to produce [adenine-8-14C]adenosine-5'-[18O]phosphorothioate and adenosine. The configuration of the chiral phosphorus in adenosine-5'-[18O]phosphorothioate which was used as the donor substrate was then compared with that of the [adenine-8-14C]adenosine-5'-[18O]phosphorothioate isolated from the reaction mixture. They were found to be the same, showing that the reaction proceeds with 99.7% retention of configuration of the [18O]phosphorothioate. This is interpreted to be indicative of the involvement of a thiophosphoryl-enzyme intermediate in the nucleoside phosphotransferase reaction. The synthesis of adenosine-5'-[18O]phosphorothioate having the R and S configurations at the phosphorus atoms is described."
https://openalex.org/W1583002675,"The stereochemical course of the formation of the alkyl ether bond in alkyl ether lipids was investigated through the synthesis of stereospecifically labeled acyl R- or S-[1-3H]dihydroxyacetone 3-phosphate (DHAP) starting from L-glyceraldehyde. It was demonstrated directly that the formation of the alkyl ether bond results in the stereospecific exchange of the pro-R C-1 hydrogen of DHAP with a proton of water. The configuration of the hydrogen that is retained on C-1 after formation of the alkyl ether bond was also investigated. The alkyl ether lipid was degraded, and the DHAP backbone isolated as glycerol, converted to DHAP via glycerol 3-phosphate and treated with either aldolase or triose phosphate isomerase. The results demonstrated that the retained hydrogen on C-1, which was pro-S in the starting substrate, was pro-S in the product alkyl ether."
https://openalex.org/W1492581489,"RNA polymerase II polypeptides present in [35S]methionine-labeled Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell extracts have been quantitatively immunoprecipitated with an anti-calf thymus RNA polymerase II serum. Analyses of the immunoprecipitates on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels indicated that the immunoprecipitated polymerase II of both wild type CHO cells and the alpha-amanitin-resistant mutant Ama1 had polypeptides of molecular weight 214,000, 140,000, 34,000, 25,000, 23,000, 20,500, and 16,500. In heterozygous alpha-amanitin-resistant/alpha-amanitin-sensitive hybrid CHO cells, growth in the presence of alpha-amanitin results in the inactivation of the alpha-amanitin-sensitive RNA polymerase II activity and a compensating increase in the activity of the alpha-amanitin-resistant enzyme. Determination of the rates of synthesis and degradation of RNA polymerase II polypeptides using [35S]methionine labeling and polymerase II immunoprecipitation demonstrated that this increase in activity of alpha-amanitin-resistant polymerase II resulted from a co-ordinate increase in the rate of synthesis of at least three polypeptides of RNA polymerase II. At the same time, there was an enhanced rate of degradation of the alpha-amanitin-inactivated RNA polymerase II polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1557353187,"The effects of priming mouse cells with interferon on the production of interferon and its mRNA were investigated. Interferon-treated (primed) mouse L929 cells produce 3 to 10 times more interferon than do nonprimed cells following induction with Newcastle disease virus. Interferon appears 2 to 4 h sooner in the primed cultures than in nonprimed cultures and interferon production by primed cells becomes resistant to inhibition by actinomycin D about 4 h sooner than interferon production in nonprimed cells. Interferon mRNA is detected in primed-induced cells about 2 h earlier than in nonprimed-induced cells. It reaches peak levels about 2 to 4 earlier in primed cells, but it also disappears sooner in primed cells. The total amounts of interferon mRNA isolated from primed-induced cells and nonprimed-induced cells were indistinguishable, by the methods utilized. Therefore, although primed cells can produce significantly more interferon and make interferon mRNA sooner than nonprimed cells, the total amount of interferon mRNA produced is apparently not increased, nor is its half-life prolonged in primed cells. Thus, enhanced interferon production in primed cells may result from enhanced efficiency of translation of interferon mRNA in the primed cells."

The optical spectrum (peaks at 412 and 455 nm which disappear upon reduction) and the EPR spectrum (g values at 1.94 and 2.02) were typical for a ferredoxin. In reconstitution experiments, the protein could replace adrenodoxin in the cholesterol side chain cleavage reaction. The additional detection of cytochrome P-450 in brain mitochondria indicates that the isolated ferredoxin is part of a cytochrome P-450-dependent hydroxylation system."
https://openalex.org/W1680769567,"The mixed disulfide of bovine trypsinogen and glutathione refolded with high yields at protein concentrations of 20 microgram/ml or less, at 4-25 degrees C, pH 8.0 to 8.7, in the presence of 3 to 6 mM cysteine under anaerobic conditions. The regenerated protein behaved as native trypsinogen as judged by gel exclusion chromatography, isoelectric focusing, and activation with bovine enterokinase or trypsin. However, refolded samples that were quenched with iodoacetate and analyzed by disc gel electrophoresis formed two components corresponding to trypsinogen and S-(carboxymethylcysteine)2-(179-203)-trypsinogen. The use of cysteine as a disulfide interchange catalyst caused reduction of the 179 to 203 disulfide bond, and quenching of the refolding mixture with iodoacetate produced the carboxymethylated derivative. The overall yield of the regenerated product was 70% and the half-time at 4 degrees C was 55 min."

A. custellanii RNA polymerase II purified in this fash- ion has a native molecular weight of 630,000 when sedimented in glycerol gradients, and is composed of 12 putative subunits based upon polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sul- fate. The estimated molecular weights of these polypep- tides are: Subunit a, 193,000; Subunit b, 178,000; Sub- unit c, 162,000; Subunit d, 38,500 to 40,000; Subunit e, 22,600; Subunit f, 18,000; Subunit g, 16,600; Subunit h, 14,000; Subunit i, 13,300; Subunit j, 12,600; Subunit k, 12,000; Subunit 1, tlO,OOO. Subunits a and b are present in molar ratios of 0.23 and 0.76, respectively, suggesting the presence of two forms of the enzyme which differ in the size of their largest subunit. All of the remaining subunits are present in integral molar ratios except Subunits d, i, and j. A. castellanii is a free living soil amoeba which can be induced to undergo a cellular differentiation process termed encystment. This requires the formation of a bilayer wall composed of cellulose and protein. A major component of the cyst wall is a single protein which accounts for 16% of the dry weight of the cyst. The appearance of this protein must be temporally pre- ceded by transcription of large quantitites of messenger RNA encoding this protein, suggesting that this devel- opmentally controlled gene is useful for elucidating the regulation of single copy gene expression in eukary- otes. The purification procedure reported here is the first step toward the construction of an in vitro transcription system for studying the expression of this gene."

https://openalex.org/W1597574003,"Proteoglycans were extracted from porcine lungs with 4 M guanidinium chloride. The extract was subjected to associative density gradient centrifugation, and four equal fractions, labeled A1 through A4 from the bottom to the top of the gradient, were obtained. The pooled A1 fractions containing proteoglycan aggregates were further fractionated by dissociative density gradient centrifugation to yield four equal fractions labeled A1D1 through A1D4 from the bottom to the top of the gradient. These fractions were analyzed for their protein, uronic acid, glucosamine, galactosamine, hexose, and sialic acid content. The fraction A1D1 with the highest buoyant density had the highest content of uronic acid and galactosamine, and lowest content of protein, indicating the enrichment of proteoglycan monomers at the bottom of the dissociative density gradient. As the density of the gradient decreased, the protein, hexoses, and sialic acid content increased, whereas uronic acid and galactosamine content decreased. The amino acid analysis showed similar composition for all four fractions with aspartic acid, serine, glutamic acid, proline, glycine, alanine, valine, and leucine as the major constituent amino acids. No hydroxyproline was detected in any of the fractions. As the buoyant density of the fractions decreased, the aspartic acid content increased and glycine content decreased."

https://openalex.org/W1605858276,"A simplified procedure is described for the calculation of protein physical parameters from data obtained by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The position of an uncharacterized protein relative to standard proteins is determined after centrifugation through linear 5-20% sucrose gradients prepared in both H2O and D2O. From these data, together with the density of each 5% sucrose buffer, the partial specific volume and standard sedimentation coefficient can be calculated without knowledge of rotor dimensions, angular velocity, time of centrifugation, or solvent viscosity. In the absence of specific solvent-induced changes in protein composition or conformation, the magnitude of error due to the approximations inherent in the method is estimated to be less than 2.3% in partial specific volume or less than 10-15% in sedimentation coefficient."
https://openalex.org/W1580948719,"Abstract The pK values of the 3 histidine residues in the common alpha subunits of bovine and equine glycoprotein hormones have been determined from titration curves generated from their C-2 proton nuclear magnetic resonances at different pH values. Assignment of resonances to specific histidines is based on a comparison between the two species, which have 1 histidine residue in different positions in their sequences, and of the bovine alpha subunit after removal of its histidine 94 by treatment with carboxypeptidases. In both species, those histidines closest to the COOH terminus titrate with near normal pK values of 6.2. The histidine residue found in the bovine subunit at position 87 titrates with an approximate pK value of 5.4. Histidine 83, adjacent to an oligosaccharide moiety in both species, does not titrate over a pH range of 4.0 to 8.0 and thus appears inaccessible to solvent. Similarly, in bovine lutropin-beta, 1 of 3 histidine residues does not titrate between pH 5.0 and 7.0. In the intact hormone, 2 nontitratable histidine residues are found. Changes in the characteristics of the signals, however, preclude unambiguous assignment of these two resonances to the nontitrating histidines in the isolated subunits. It appears that changes in the environment of at least some histidines occur when the subunits combine to yield intact hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1590889120,"Native and pyridoxal phosphate modified rat liver glutamate dehydrogenase crystals have been obtained and used for a preliminary x-ray crystallographic analysis. The space group is P6222 (P6422) having unit cell dimensions a = b = 101 A, c = 724 A and gamma = 120 A. The unit cell contains 36 subunits (six hexameric molecules) of molecular weight 56,000 and there is one half-molecule, i.e. three subunits, in the asymmetric unit. Packing considerations suggest that the glutamate dehydrogenase molecule has the point group symmetry 32 and that each subunit can be represented as a particle with approximate dimensions of 45 x 45 x 60 A."

https://openalex.org/W2165768025,"Medicine, New York, New York 10035 We have used equilibrium dialysis and other tech- niques to examine the actinomycin D binding sites on unsubstituted and halodeoxyuridine-substituted DNAs. Some of the actinomycin D binding sites present on halodeoxyuridine-substituted DNAs have an enhanced affinity for actinomycin D compared to the standard binding sites present on unsubstituted DNA. Kinetic studies indicate that actinomycin D dissociates from these high affinity sites at a slower rate than it does from the standard sites on unsubstituted DNA. Increas- ing levels of bromodeoxyuridine substitution are asso- ciated with increased binding of actinomycin D to the substituted DNA. Substitution with iododeoxyuridine causes a greater increase in actinomycin D binding than do equivalent levels of substitution with chloro- deoxyuridine or bromodeoxyuridine. Some halodeox- yuridine-substituted DNAs appear to have additional binding sites for actinomycin D which are not available on unsubstituted DNA. The finding, that poly(dA- 5BrdU).poly(dA-5BrdU) as well as poly(dA-dT)"
