https://openalex.org/W2122778470,"The involvement of heme proteins in photometabolism, first suggested by Hill (1, 2), seems certain from results of recent enzyme studies (3-5) and observations on systems in viva using differential spectrophotometry (6-10). Of the many heme proteins which exist in intimate association with the photoactive pigments in the functional subcellular structures of photosynthetic tissues, only three have been isolated in soluble form in sufficient amounts and purity for adequate characterization. One of these is the so-called “cytochrome f” of green plant tissues (11). The other two are variant cytochromes, one of the V type (12), and one an atypical heme protein called “RHP” (12, 13) obtained from extracts of the facultative photoheterotrophic purple bacterium, Rhodospirillum rubrum. We now report the isolation and identification of two soluble heme proteins contained in extracts of the obligate photoanaerobit purple bacterium, Chromatium. Previous studies (14, 15) have indicated the existence of both a cytochrome ‘Y-type and an RHP-type heme protein’ in partially resolved preparations (15). Some preliminary data have been published on their physicochemical properties. Complete resolution of these heme protein mixtures has been achieved so that it is now possible to characterize completely the two soluble Chromutium cytochrome components."

The latter disease concealed the infection caused by the new hemagglutinating agent, which was shown to cause, by itself, a mild and transient illness in susceptible chickens. Preliminary studies indicate that the new agent may be a new entity of the myxovirus group."

https://openalex.org/W2069316529,"WE have recently established1 that 10-hydroxy-Δ2-decenoic acid, which constitutes about 15 per cent of royal jelly, is not present in the free state in pollens of representative species, nectar or honey. We suggested that it might therefore be present in combined form or be a specific bee product. In order to investigate the latter possibility we have examined the four pairs of salivary glands of the honey bee (Apis mellifica) obtained by dissection under distilled water."

A hybrid from an initial mating, when crossed again with E. coli, behaved then as a high-frequency recipient strain."
https://openalex.org/W2021702462,"THE recent University of the Witwatersrand-Nuffield expedition to the Kalahari desert enabled one of us (J.S.W.) to collect blood samples from Naron Bushmen, living their traditional hunting life and from Bushmen employed on farms in the vicinity of Ghanzi, Bechuanaland. The blood-grouping results on these specimens have already been reported1. In addition, two of us (R.S. and J.S.W.) were able to obtain samples from Hottentot (Nama-speaking) subjects in the Richtersveld area of Little Namaqualand and from Cape-coloured people in the Springbok and Steinkopf regions. Since the genetical variants of the serum proteins have not previously been studied in these peoples the sera were forwarded to London by Dr. A. Zoutendyk, who also kindly provided a series of Zulu sera, collected in Johannesburg, for comparison. The sera were examined by starch-gel electrophoresis using B.D.H. potato starch hydrolysed by the by the method of Smithies2. The discontinuous buffer system described by Poulik3 was used in routine screening. After addition of hæmoglobin to saturate the hatoglobins the sera were inserted into a wide gel on pieces of filter-paper in batches of twelve. One half of the gel was stained with amidoschwartz and the other was treated with benzidine-hydrogen peroxide reagent. Specimens in which haptoglobins were weak or apparently absent were also run by the vertical method4 and this was also used to compare β-globulin variants the identity of which as iron-binding transferrins was checked with the nitroso-R reagent of Smithies5. The results are shown in Table 1."

https://openalex.org/W2011401176,"it has been suggested that level of performance in a vigilance task is accurately reflected by frequency of observing responses. By means of photography it has been demonstrated that under conditions where a decrement in vigilance performance does not occur, the frequency of nonobserving behaviorand general activity increases in time."

https://openalex.org/W2065692300,"PROBABLY the most important factor which determines the carcinogenic properties of a substance is the species (and sometimes the strain) of the animals which are being treated with it. This makes it very difficult to deal with such substances from the public health point of view since results from animal experiments in the field of cancer research cannot always be related to what may happen in man. In practice, substances with known marked carcinogenic activity for man or animals, and which are liable to constitute an occupational hazard, are usually recognized and treated with the respect due to them."

https://openalex.org/W1981431057,"MANY strains of Lancefield group A streptococci synthesize a starch-like polysaccharide when grown on a medium containing maltose or maltose-polymers1, and some of these strains also produce an extracellular amylase2. It has been shown that amylase-negative starch-accumulating strains are associated with acute glomerulonephritis and acute rheumatic fever3. There is as yet no direct proof that the starch itself is more than a metabolic marker of bacterial variants, but because of the possibility of its production in vivo its isolation and characterization were of considerable interest, for it has been shown that bacterial polysaccharides of high molecular weight may have long persistence in the tissues4."
