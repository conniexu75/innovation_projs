https://openalex.org/W1968738869,"Parameters of bone formation and resorption were measured in rats orbited for 19.5 days aboard the Soviet Cosmos 782 biological satellite. The most striking effects were on bone formation. During flight, rats formed significantly less periosteal bone than did control rats on the ground. An arrest line at both the periosteum and the endosteum of flight animals suggest that a complete cessation of bone growth occurred. During a 26-day postflight period, the defect in bone formation was corrected. No significant changes in bone resorption were observed."

Much of the proteolytic activity appears to be due to plasmin. In addition, plasminogen activator activity can be demonstrated in follicle wall homogenates. Evidence that plasmin decreases the tensile strength of follicle wall preparations is also reported. The potential for the involvement of these substances in ovulation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1606616864,"The dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-sensitive ATPase from spinach chloroplast has been isolated. On sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, seven different polypeptides were seen. Five of these polypeptides coincided with the CF1 subunits, a 7,500-dalton peptide was identified as the proteolipid which interacts with [14C]dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and there was a 15,500-dalton hydrophobic polypeptide with unknown function. In two-dimentional gels, two additional peptides were resolved, one 17,500 daltons (co-migrating in sodium dodecyl sulfate gels with subunit delta) and one 13,500 daltons (co-migrating with subunit epsilon). Reconstitution was obtained by freezing and thawing the complex with a crude mixture of phospholipids. After reconstitution the complex catalyzed 32P1-ATP exchange (rates of 200 to 400 nmoles x mg-1 x min-1) and ATP formation during acid-to-base transition. These reactions were inhibited by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and uncouplers. Uncouplers at low concentrations stimulated and at high concentrations inhibited the Mg2+-ATPase activity. ATP hydrolysis and 32P1-ATP exchange were catalyzed by the complex in the presence of either Mg2+ or Mn2+ but not with Ca2+ or Co2+. ATP and GTP were substrates for the exchange reaction but not ADP or CTP."

https://openalex.org/W2146480641,"Individual muscle fibers from the biceps of five indi- viduals were analyzed for 10 different enzymes. For each person, lactic dehydrogenase and adenylokinase were first measured in 50 to 100 fibers. From each large group, 20 or more fibers, representing the full range of enzyme activity, were analyzed in duplicate for the other eight enzymes (glycogen phosphorylase, P-fruc- tokinase, pyruvate kinase, glycero-P dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, fumarase, fi-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehy- drogenase, and creatine kinase). On the basis of the enzyme patterns, two clearly defined fiber types and several subtypes could be distinguished. The high lactic dehydrogenase group (type II) had high levels of other glycogenolytic enzymes and low levels of mitochondrial enzymes; the low lactic dehydrogenase group (type I) had the reverse enzyme complement. The high lactic dehydrogenase fibers consisted of two partly overlapping subgroups, containing high or me- dium adenylokinase and low or medium levels of mi- tochondrial enzymes. The low lactic dehydrogenase fi- bers, although not so clearly separable into distinct subgroups, were heterogeneous in respect to enzymes of glycogenolysis, which varied in a coordinate manner over a wide range of values. In contrast, they were comparatively homogeneous with respect to the mito- chondrial ‘enzymes. No consistent correlation was seen between creatine kinase activities and fiber type. The results demonstrate the presence among neighboring muscle fibers of a broad spectrum of highly coordinated enzyme activities and illustrate the advantages of measuring many enzymes on the same individual fi- bers. During development skeletal muscle fibers differentiate into at least three distinct types which vary in speed of contraction and enzyme composition. These may be designated slow twitch red (type I), fast twitch red (type IIA), and fast twitch white (IIB). Various other names have also been applied (l-12). (Naming the fiber types presents difficulties (8, 9).) Although most muscles contain an intimate mixture of all three fiber types, in certain muscles one or another type predominates. Enzyme analyses of these specialized muscles have shown that type I fibers are adapted to aerobic metab- olism of fats and carbohydrates, type IIB fibers are suited to anaerobic glycolysis, and type IIA fibers display both"
https://openalex.org/W1575759963,"The mitochondrial F1-ATPase is irreversibly inactivated by the adenine nucleotide analogue, p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl-5'-adenosine. This inactivation is partly prevented by the presence of bound adenine nucleotides. Inactivations of the ATPase with p-fluorosulfonyl[14C]benzoyl-5'-adenosine were most efficiently accomplished with the nucleotide-free enzyme at pH 7.0, in a buffer containing 20% glycerol. Under these conditions, 4.2 g atoms of 14C are incorporated per 350,000 g of enzyme when the ATPase is inactivated by 90% by its reaction with 2 mM p-fluorosulfonyl[14C]benzoyl-5'-adenosine. Isolation of the component polypeptide chains of the labeled ATPase showed that all of the radioactivity was associated with the two largest subunits. The isolated alpha subunit contained 0.45 g atom of 14C/mol and the isolated beta subunit contained 0.88 g atom of 14C/mol. Hence, the inactivation can be correlated with the incorporation of 14C into the beta subunit. This suggests that the hydrolytic site of the enzyme resides on this subunit. The majority of the radioactivity in a tryptic digest of labeled beta subunit is contained ina tryptic peptide that has the following amino acid sequence: Ile-Met-Asp-Pro-Asn-Ile-Val-Gly-Ser-Glu-His-Tyr-Asp-Val-Ala-Arg, where Tyr is the radioactive derivative of the tyrosine residue that was sulfonylated during the inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1973167563,"Digestion of the complex between double-stranded DNA and M. luteus or E. coli DNA gyrase with staphylococcal nuclease gives a 143 ± 3 base pair DNA fragment containing no single-chain scissions. Digestion of the same complex with bovine pancreatic DNAase I gives six discernible single-stranded DNA bands upon electrophoresis of the product in a denaturing gel. The lengths of these fragments, in number of nucleotides, are measured to be 47 ± 1, 57 ± 1, 67 ± 1, 77 ± 1, 86 ± 1 and 96 ± 1, respectively. These results support the notion that in the DNA-gyrase complex, a segment(s) of the DNA helix is wrapped around the enzyme. The wrapping of the DNA around the enzyme has been proposed previously based on the observation that in the absence of ATP, the linking number of a duplex DNA ring covalently closed by ligase in the presence of bound gyrase is higher than in the absence of gyrase ( Liu and Wang, 1978 Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 75. 1978: 2098-2102 Google Scholar ). The coiling of DNA around the enzyme in the complex is believed to be intimately related to the ATP-dependent negative supercoiling of covalently closed duplex DNA ring by DNA gyrase. It has also been observed that digestion of pure double-stranded DNA by pancreatic DNAase I in the presence of calcium phosphate precipitate or solid hydroxylapatite gives a ladder of single-stranded DNA fragments of integral multiples of 10 nucleotides. This finding suggests that such a pancreatic DNAase I cleavage pattern is indicative of a DNA duplex lying on the outside of a surface."

The specific activity of the Mg2+-requiring plasma membrane ATPase activity (EC 3.6.1.3) was enriched from 0.3 mumol min-1 x mg-1 of protein in the homogenate to 26 in the purified membranes. The optimal conditions for solubilization of the ATPase activity by lysolecithin were found to be: 2 mg/ml of lysolecithin, a lysolecithin to protein ratio of 8 at pH 7.5, and 15 degrees C in the presence of 1 mM ATP and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. A 6- to 7-fold purification of the solubilized ATPase activity was obtained by centrifugation of the lysolecithin extract in sucrose gradient. Part of the ATPase activity which was inactivated during the centrifugation in the sucrose gradient could be restored by addition of a micellar solution of 50 microgram of lysolecithin/ml during the assay. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate of the purified enzyme showed only one band of Mr = 105,000 stained with Coomassie blue. Another ATPase component of apparent molecular weight lower than 10,000 was stained by periodic Schiff reagent but not colored by Coomassie blue. The purified enzyme was 85% inhibited by 50 micrometer N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 94% inhibited by 53 microgram of Dio-9/ml."

https://openalex.org/W2061472940,"The DNA sequences have been determined for promoter regions of two ribosomal protein operons in E. coli, the str operon and the spc operon. The site of in vitro transcription initiation within each of these promoter regions has been determined. The start site of the str operon occurs 69 bases upstream from the initiation codon of the S12 gene. The start site of the spc operon occurs 72 bases upstream from the L14 gene, and only 91 bases downstream from the termination codon of the S17 gene (which is in the preceding S10 operon). Both promoters are similar to other sequenced promoters in that they each have an identifiable ""Pribnow box"" sequence 5 bases upstream from the transcription start site. The spc promoter has a long sequence of 2 fold symmetry centered within the Pribnow box; the str promoter has a shorter but similar symmetry. At positions -69 through -40 in the spc operon, another long region of symmetry is present which may be the termination signal of the preceding S10 operon. Extensive sequence similarity between the str and spc promoter regions is found downstream from the Pribnow box-that is, in a transcribed region preceding the translation start sites."

https://openalex.org/W1582693492,"The capacity of various ATPase preparations from beef heart mitochondria to catalyze exchange of phosphate oxygens with water has been evaluated. Oligomycin-sensitive ATPase preparations retain a capacity for considerable intermediate Pi equilibrium HOH exchange per Pi formed during ATP hydrolysis at relatively high ATP concentration (5 mM). Submitochondrial particles prepared by an ammonia-Sephadex procedure with 5 mM ATP showed more rapid ATPase, less oligomycin sensitivity, and less capacity for intermediate exchange. With these particles, intermediate Pi equilibrium HOH exchange per Pi formed was increased as ATP concentration was decreased. The purified, soluble ATPase from mitochondria catalyzed little or no intermediate Pi equilibrium HOH exchange at 5 mM ATP but showed pronounced increase in capacity for such exchange as ATP concentration was lowered. The ATPase also showed a weak catalysis of an ADP-stimulated medium Pi equilibrium HOH exchange. The results support the alternating catalytic site model for ATP synthesis or cleavage. They also demonstrate that a transmembrane protonmotive force is not necessary for oxygen exchange reactions. At lower ATP concentrations, ADP and Pi formed at a catalytic site appear to remain bound and continue to allow exchange of Pi oxygens until ATP binds at another site on the enzyme."

This increase in synthesis depended on the activation of tryptophan hydroxylase.

https://openalex.org/W1523591525,"The present study provides data on the properties of Ca2+-dependent Atpase of sarcoplasmic reticulum in states intermediary between the fully detergent-solubilized and vesicular form. After solubilization of ATPase vesicles by dodecyloctaoxyethylene glycol monoether (C12E8), the protein is mainly present as a monomer exhibiting enzymatic activity. Gel chromatography in presence or absence of Tween 80 gives rise to formation of oligomers of various size and smaller amounts of monomeric ATPase. Only the oligomeric species retain enzymatic activity (half-life, 3 to 4 days), while the gel chromatographic monomer is enzymatically inactive. Teteramers or trimers of ATPase, containing approximately 22 mol of phospholipid/mol of ATPase, are the smallest enzymatically active units after gel chromatography. Formation of larger sized particles and vesicles of ATPase appears to depend on the presence of sufficient lipid to make a cohesion between the tetrameric or trimeric units. The protein appears to be partially deaggregated by a relatively high Tween 80 concentration in the eluant (0.5 mg/ml) and under these conditions, phospholipid binding is reduced to a low level (approximately 11 mol/mol of protein). The data indicate that any bonds between ATPase polypeptide chains are easily disrupted by detergent and that lipid also may play a role in mediating contact between individual polypeptide chains in the tetrameric or trimeric units. Phospholipid analysis and exchange experiments indicate that the phospholipid left on ATPase after solubilization has a similar composition to that of the whole membrane. The binding of Tween 80 by soluble ATPase above the critical micellar concentration is 0.23 to 0.29 g/g of protein. The inactive monomer of ATPase binds phospholipid and Tween 80 to about the same extent, but has a slightly different circular dichroism spectrum, than oligomeric ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W177598925,"Phosphofructokinase has been purified from the skeletal muscle of a rat (200 g) and a rabbit (3 kg) 20 h after intraperitoneal injection of [32P]phosphate (40 mCi). The specific radioactivities of the labeled phosphofructokinases were 3000 and 140 cpm/mg, respectively. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate and peptide mapping of the tryptic digest of the rat enzyme showed that one specific peptide is phosphorylated and that the phosphate is covalently linked to a serine residue. Rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase has been separated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography into two fractions with lower and higher phosphate contents, which contain an average of 0.3 and 0.8 mol of phosphate/mol of enzyme (320,000 daltons), respectively. The lower phosphate form differs from the phosphofructokinase fractions reported by other workers not only in the phosphate content but also in its aggregation state. Sedimentation velocity patterns of the lower phosphate fraction showed two major peaks (12 and 18 S) and also a minor peak (24 S), but no 30 S material. The higher phosphate fraction, however, consisted mainly of 30 S material (40%) and also 24, 18, and 12 S polymers. Upon decreasing the protein concentration from 7 to 0.4 mg/ml, the 24 and 18 S polymers in the lower and the higher phosphate fractions dissociated to 12 S material in a stepwise manner. The relative amount of 30 S material in the latter fraction remained constant, indicating that it is a stable polymer. Additional information concerning the dissociation process came from examination of three subfractions from molecular sieve chromatography of the lower phosphate and higher phosphate fractions. Within each set of three subfractions, the phosphate content was the same. However, all subfractions contained several polymeric species, with smaller polymers appearing in the trailing subfractions. The polymers appearing at comparable positions in the elution profiles were always smaller in the lower phosphate than the higher phosphate fraction. Thus, there is heterogeneity among the polymers of a given size, in phosphate content and perhaps conformation. We conclude that the association-dissociation system is too complex to be described in terms of any simple model. The specific activities of over 20 samples of phosphofructokinase with different phosphate content (0.2 to"

https://openalex.org/W1508443606,"The fluorescent reagent, S-mercuric N-dansyl-cysteine, reacts specifically with thiols of the purified Ca2+-ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, producing an increase of fluorescence of fluorescence intensity at 500 nm (lambda ex = 335 nm). The reaction is stoichiometric, and the increase of the fluorescence intensity is proportional to the number of blocked thiols. Twelve reactive thiols per 10(5) daltons of ATPase peptide fall into roughly three classes. Blocking of the most reactive thiol entails little inhibition of enzyme activity. Blocking of the five thiols reacting next (intermediate class) results in almost complete inhibition of both phosphorylated intermediate formation and ATP hydrolysis. The second order rate constants of the reaction of thiols have been determined by stopped flow studies. The most reactive thiol and the six least reactive thiols can each be treated as a single class with respect to the rate constant; five thiols of intermediate reactivity appear to have different rate constants (k2, k3, ..k6). Of these constants, k1, corresponding to the most reactive thiol, does not change with [Ca2+]. Upon increasing [Ca2+] from 10(-9) to 10(-5) M, k2 increase and k7-12 decreases; the changes roughly parallel the activation of ATPase activity and the Ca2+ binding to the high affinity alpha sites (Ikemoto, N. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 7219-7224). Upon further increase of [Ca2+] k2 decreases and k7-12 increase, in parallel with the inhibition of ATPase activity and with the Ca2+ binding to the low affinity gamma sites."

https://openalex.org/W1062773,"In studies of myosin from left and right ventricles of normal hearts and hypertrophic hearts at 5 weeks and 13 weeks after aortic banding, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows intermediate molecular weight components which derive from heavy chains fragmented in the presence of dodecyl sulfate. The proportion of degraded heavy chains is greater in myosin from hypertrophic hearts than normal hearts, with comparable degradation in left and right ventricle myosin. The observed fragmentation of myosin results from proteolysis due to contaminant proteases or a thermally activated, heat-stable nonenzymatic process, or both. The susceptibility of heavy chains to crude myofibrillar proteases differs in normal and hypertrophic cardiac myosin; however, the kinetics of tryptic digestion are identical for both myosins. With precautions to minimize proteolytic artifacts on dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, preparations of myosin from left and right ventricles of normal and hypertrophic hearts exhibit comparable subunit composition, with approximately molar ratios of heavy chains, light chain L1, and light chain L2. Comparable stoichiometry for the light chain fraction is determined by high speed sedimentation equilibrium at pH 11 and direct fractionation of the different cardiac myosins. We do not confirm reports (e.g. Wikman-Coffelt, J., Fenner, C., Smith, A., and Mason, D. T. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 1257-1262) of different proportions of light chains in left and right ventricle myosin of normal and hypertrophic canine hearts. The light chains display microheterogeneity, with L1 generating two isoelectric variants and L2 generating two major and two minor variants, but identical mobilities and isoelectric values are obtained in the different myosin preparations."

Modification of this group proceeds at a rate which parallels the loss of enzymatic activity. Efrapeptin protects the arginyl residue from reaction with phenylglyoxal. The data suggest that efrapeptin binds at the catalytic site and blocks accessibility of an essential arginine at the adenine nucleotide binding site. The detection of a single, fast-reacting, essential arginine on an enzyme with multiple copies of the catalytic subunit, provides further evidence in support of the alternating site mechanism for ATP synthesis proposed by Kayalar et al.

The 125,000- and 27,000-dalton polypeptides are consistently found in a molar ratio of 1:1. The content of the 14,000-dalton peptide is usually only 0.1 to 0.2, and always less than 0.5, relative to the other two chains and might be a contaminant or a degradation product of one of the other chains. The specific activities of the Ca2+-ATPase, (K+, EDTA)-ATPase, and (after phosphorylation of its heavy chain by a specific kinase) actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase of Acanthamoeba myosin IB are similar to those of rabbit skeletal muscle myosin. After treatment of the enzyme with 2 M LiCl, the 125,000-dalton heavy chain of Acanthamoeba myosin Ib can be obtained, by chromatography on Sephadex G-200, essentially free of the 14,000-dalton peptide and more than 90% free of the 27,000-dalton peptide. This isolated heavy chain has the same specific ATPase activities as the original enzyme.

Several peptides were produced from the original 105,000-dalton region of the sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoretic separation, but only two, 87,000 and 47,000 daltons, were labeled following incubation with [gamma-33P]ATP. After a 30-min hydrolysis, 35% of the original peptide remained unaltered and appeared to be a glycoprotein. ATP and ADP abolished the second phase of tryptic inactivation of both activities and only two peptides, of 78,000 and 30,000 daltons, were found on the acrylamide gel in addition to the original 105,000-dalton region, neither of which was labeled by [gamma-33P]ATP. The protection was specific for these nucleotides, AMP, beta, gamma-methylene ATP, TTP, and pNPP being ineffective. Na+ and K+ at high concentrations reduced the rate of loss of activity but no change in the peptides produced was found. The level of phosphoenzyme was increased 2-fold by trypsin treatment, whereas the quantity of K+-sensitive phosphoenzyme remained relatively constant. Thus, the 105,000-dalton region is heterogeneous, consisting of a catalytic subunit (the active site is on a 47,000-dalton fragment), a glycoprotein, and another 105,000-dalton peptide. The action of trypsin is initially to prevent interconversion of a K+-insensitive to a K+-sensitive form of the phosphoenzyme, thus inhibiting hydrolysis."

The response of the probes is complex and contains contributions from the binding of Ca2+ and ATP to the membrane. In a medium of 0.12 M KCl and 5 mM MgCl2, the fluorescence of Di-O-C5(3) is decreased by Ca2+ or ATP with apparent dissociation constants of 0.2 and 5 micron, respectively. This suggests that oxacarbocyanines respond to binding of Ca2+ and ATP at the active site of Ca2+ transport ATPase. The effect of ATP is observed in the absence of divalent cations. Further changes in the fluorescence or absorbance of cyanine dyes occur at millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ or during ATP-induced Ca2+ uptake, which can be related to Ca2+ binding to low affinity, relatively nonspecific binding sites on the membrane, that can also bind K+ and Mg2+. The optical changes due to Ca2+ accumulation are most pronounced in media of 0.25 M sucrose and much reduced in 0.12 M KCl and 5 mM MgCl2, in accord with competition by K+ and Mg2+ for the low affinity Ca2+ binding sites. These effects must be taken into account in the evaluation of the magnitude and direction of membrane potential in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles during Ca2+ uptake and release."

Energy transfer inhibitors that inhibit the ATPase activity of soluble chloroplast coupling factor 1 (CF1) (e.g. phloridzin and tentoxin) do not inhibit energy-dependent adenine nucleotide exchange. Energy transfer inhibitors that block proton flux through the hydrophobic protein proton channel (CF0) (e.g. dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and triphenyltin chloride) also block light-dependent adenine nucleotide exchange. 2.

https://openalex.org/W1641520421,A single gene nuclear yeast mutant was isolated whose mitochondrial F1-ATPase was resistant to the specific F1 inhibitor aurovertin. The mutant enzyme was not cross-resistant to other F1 inhibitors. The binding of aurovertin to F1 and to the two largest F1 subunits (alpha and beta) was measured by enhancement of aurovertin fluorescence. Aurovertin bound to wild type F1-ATPase and to its monomeric beta subunit with about the same binding constant. It failed to bind to wild type alpha subunit or to either F1 or F1 subunits from the mutant. The aurovertin-resistant mutant thus contains an altered nuclear gene which specifies the structure of the beta subunit of F1.

Extended plasmic digestions of human fibrin containing four epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)lysine cross-links per molecule produced a peptide of alpha-chain origin (Mr congruent to 21,000) which was comprised of a small donor peptide cross-linked to the acceptor site peptide from the middle of the alpha-chain. CNBr cleavage of highly cross-linked in vitro fibrin or of fibrin from a spontaneously formed in vivo arterial embolus produced about three cross-linked species of molecular weights 30,000 to 40,000, each of which contained the largest CNBr fragment (Mr = 29,000) from the alpha-chain. The predominant cross-link-containing CNBr fragments derived their donor group from the near COOH-terminal region of the alpha-chain as judged by difference amino acid compositions and NH2-terminal analyses. Additionally, cross-linked fragments of molecular weights 68,000 to 70,000 which appeared to contain two acceptor site peptides (Mr = 29,000) were detected in minor amounts in the CNBr digests of fibrin formed from whole plasma or from purified, plasminogen-free fibrinogen.

Although there was a small burst in Pi production, rate constant of 0.97 s-1, when 100 mM KCl was added, the burst when LiCl or no monovalent cation was added was either nonexistent or so small as to make its detection unreliable.

The half-life for the enzyme is about 2 days in control and in pClPhe-treated rats. In addition, there is no detectable incorporation of pClPhe into the phenylalanine hydroxylase molecule itself."

https://openalex.org/W1528563359,"The molecular specificity for the blocking action of thyroxine on the triiodothyronine effect in the cooperativity of membrane-bound rat erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase and Escherichia coli Ca2+-ATPase was analyzed. Changes in the values of n (Hill coefficient) were obtained at strict physiological levels of these hormones. The structural requirements of the thyroid hormones to modify the membrane-bound systems were studied using various analogues of these hormones. In the erythrocyte system, a very high molecular specificity for triiodothyronine and thyroxine actions was found. The L-alanine side is essential to carry out both the allosteric desensitization and the blocking effects. The blocking ability of thyroxine is characterized by the presence of iodine in the 5' position. The bacterial system presented only specificity for the triiodothyronine allosteric desensitization. A system of membrane-bound enzymes for the study of the actions of thyroid hormones, is presented here."

https://openalex.org/W45880961,"A new DNA-dependent ATPase was isolated and purified from soluble extracts of Escherichia coli. This enzyme, called ATPase II, has a molecular weight of 86,000 and exists in a monomeric state. It degrades ATP (or dATP) to ADP (or dADP) and Pi in the presence of magnesium and requires a double-stranded polynucleotide as cofactor. A correlation between the efficiency as cofactor and the melting point of the polynucleotide has been found; the lower the melting temperature, the higher the stimulation of ATPase II. The enzyme binds to single-stranded DNA and poly[d(A-T)] copolymer, but not to the double-stranded circular DNA (Form I) of simian virus 40."
