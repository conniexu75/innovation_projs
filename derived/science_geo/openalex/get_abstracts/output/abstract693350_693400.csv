https://openalex.org/W4280581045,"Having adopted a dynamic zero-COVID strategy to respond to SARS-CoV-2 variants with higher transmissibility since August 2021, China is now considering whether, and for how long, this policy can remain in place. The debate has thus shifted towards the identification of mitigation strategies for minimizing disruption to the healthcare system in the case of a nationwide epidemic. To this aim, we developed an age-structured stochastic compartmental susceptible-latent-infectious-removed-susceptible model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission calibrated on the initial growth phase for the 2022 Omicron outbreak in Shanghai, to project COVID-19 burden (that is, number of cases, patients requiring hospitalization and intensive care, and deaths) under hypothetical mitigation scenarios. The model also considers age-specific vaccine coverage data, vaccine efficacy against different clinical endpoints, waning of immunity, different antiviral therapies and nonpharmaceutical interventions. We find that the level of immunity induced by the March 2022 vaccination campaign would be insufficient to prevent an Omicron wave that would result in exceeding critical care capacity with a projected intensive care unit peak demand of 15.6 times the existing capacity and causing approximately 1.55 million deaths. However, we also estimate that protecting vulnerable individuals by ensuring accessibility to vaccines and antiviral therapies, and maintaining implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions could be sufficient to prevent overwhelming the healthcare system, suggesting that these factors should be points of emphasis in future mitigation policies."

We report on the thickness-dependent antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition in zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) thin films on silicon. The emergent ferroelectricity and hysteretic polarization switching in ultrathin ZrO2, conventionally a paraelectric material, notably persists down to a film thickness of 5 angstroms, the fluorite-structure unit-cell size. This approach to exploit three-dimensional centrosymmetric materials deposited down to the two-dimensional thickness limit, particularly within this model fluorite-structure system that possesses unconventional ferroelectric size effects, offers substantial promise for electronics, demonstrated by proof-of-principle atomic-scale nonvolatile ferroelectric memory on silicon. Additionally, it is also indicative of hidden electronic phenomena that are achievable across a wide class of simple binary materials."
https://openalex.org/W4229450449,"Abstract The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Gamma variant of concern has spread rapidly across Brazil since late 2020, causing substantial infection and death waves. Here we used individual-level patient records after hospitalization with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) between 20 January 2020 and 26 July 2021 to document temporary, sweeping shocks in hospital fatality rates that followed the spread of Gamma across 14 state capitals, during which typically more than half of hospitalized patients aged 70 years and older died. We show that such extensive shocks in COVID-19 in-hospital fatality rates also existed before the detection of Gamma. Using a Bayesian fatality rate model, we found that the geographic and temporal fluctuations in Brazil’s COVID-19 in-hospital fatality rates were primarily associated with geographic inequities and shortages in healthcare capacity. We estimate that approximately half of the COVID-19 deaths in hospitals in the 14 cities could have been avoided without pre-pandemic geographic inequities and without pandemic healthcare pressure. Our results suggest that investments in healthcare resources, healthcare optimization and pandemic preparedness are critical to minimize population-wide mortality and morbidity caused by highly transmissible and deadly pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, especially in low- and middle-income countries."
https://openalex.org/W4280580558,"Background The resurgence of COVID-19 cases since June 2021, referred to as the fourth COVID-19 wave, has led to the approval and administration of booster vaccines. Our study aims to identify any associations between vaccine status with the characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 disease. Methods We retrospectively reviewed all COVID-19 patients admitted to a large tertiary center between July 25 and October 25, 2021 (fourth wave in Israel). Univariant and multivariant analyses of variables associated with vaccine status were performed. Findings Overall, 349 patients with severe or critical disease were included. Patients were either not vaccinated (58%), had the first two vaccine doses (35%) or had the booster vaccine (7%). Vaccinated patients were significantly older, male predominant, and with a higher number of comorbidities including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, immunodeficient state, kidney disease and cognitive decline. Time from the first symptom to hospital admission was longer among non-vaccinated patients (7.2 ± 4.4 days, p = 0.002). Critical disease (p&lt;0.05), admissions to the intensive care unit (p = 0.01) and advanced oxygen support (p = 0.004) were inversely proportional to the number of vaccines given, lowest among the booster vaccine group. Death (20%, p = 0.83) and hospital stay duration (8.05± 8.47, p = 0.19) were similar between the groups. Conclusion Hospitalized vaccinated patients with severe COVID-19 had significantly higher rates of most known risk factors for COVID-19 adverse outcomes. Still, all disease outcomes were similar or better compared with the non-vaccinated patients."

https://openalex.org/W4280502224,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic and countrywide lockdown could negatively impact household food insecurity among low-income households. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of household food insecurity and its influencing factors among low-income people in Bangladesh during the lockdown of COVID-19. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted through face-to-face interviews from 500 low-income households during the countrywide COVID-19 lockdown. A pretested, structured and validated questionnaire was used to collect socioeconomic characteristics, household income conditions, and food accessibility. Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) and Dietary Diversity Score (DDS) were used to measure food insecurity. Multinomial logistic regression models were estimated to evaluate and predict risk factors that influence food insecurity. Results The study found that above 67% of households was mild-to-moderate food insecure while 23% experienced severe food insecurity. Significantly, 88%, 97.4%, and 93.4% of the households had anxiety and uncertainty, inadequate quality, and inadequate quantity of food, respectively. The regression analysis revealed the age 36–50 years (RRR: 4.86; 95% CI: 2.31–7.44, RRR: 4.16; 95% CI: 2.25–6.10) and monthly income &lt;58.3 USD (RRR: 3.04; 95% CI: 1.12–5.14, RRR: 3.26; 95% CI: 1.79–4.71) were significantly associated with food insecurity (p &lt;0.001). Likewise, less-income (RRR: 3.87; 95% CI: 1.37–6.46, RRR: 2.99; 95% CI: 1.16–4.83), increase in food prices (RRR: 1.29; 95% CI: 0.32–2.33, RRR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.05–1.12), and those who did not have same type of earning as before during the COVID-19 lockdown (RRR: 3.41; 95% CI: 1.33–5.62, RRR: 2.60; 95% CI: 0.99–4.24) were potential risk factor for MMFI and FI. Conclusion This study found that households become more susceptible to food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown period. Based on the findings, we suggest some essential food policies and adequate food assistance to mitigate these negative consequences."
https://openalex.org/W4280540619,"In this study, we report our experience in commissioning a commercial treatment planning system (TPS) for fast-raster scanning of carbon-ion beams. This TPS uses an analytical dose calculation algorithm, a pencil-beam model with a triple Gaussian form for the lateral-dose distribution, and a beam splitting algorithm to consider lateral heterogeneity in a medium. We adopted the mixed beam model as the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) model for calculating the RBE values of the scanned carbon-ion beam. To validate the modeled physical dose, we compared the calculations with measurements of various relevant quantities as functions of the field size, range and width of the spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP), and depth–dose and lateral-dose profiles for a 6-mm SOBP in water. To model the biological dose, we compared the RBE calculated with the newly developed TPS to the RBE calculated with a previously validated TPS that is in clinical use and uses the same RBE model concept. We also performed patient-specific measurements to validate the dose model in clinical situations. The physical beam model reproduces the measured absolute dose at the center of the SOBP as a function of field size, range, and SOBP width and reproduces the dose profiles for a 6-mm SOBP in water. However, the profiles calculated for a heterogeneous phantom have some limitations in predicting the carbon-ion-beam dose, although the biological doses agreed well with the values calculated by the validated TPS. Using this dose model for fast-raster scanning, we successfully treated more than 900 patients from October 2018 to October 2020, with an acceptable agreement between the TPS-calculated and measured dose distributions. We conclude that the newly developed TPS can be used clinically with the understanding that it has limited accuracies for heterogeneous media."

This study was aimed to determine the virulence content and phylogenetic groups of carbapenemase-producing E . coli isolates in southwest Iran. One hundred and fifty-two non-duplicate E . coli isolates were collected from various clinical samples. Antibiotic susceptibility and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion and agar dilution methods. Phenotypic screening of carbapenemase enzymes was performed by modified Hodge test (MHT). Detection of carbapenemase genes, phylogenetic groups, and virulence-associated genes were also performed by the PCR assay. The highest and lowest resistance rates were observed against mezlocillin (70.4%) and doripenem (13.1%), respectively. Out of 28 isolates that were resistant to carbapenem antibiotics, 12 (7.9%) strains were phenotypically carbapenemase producers. The bla OXA-48 was the predominant carbapenemase gene, detected in 58.3% of isolates, followed by bla IMP (41.7%) and bla NDM (8.3%). None of the isolates harbored bla VIM and bla KPC genes. Among the twelve carbapenemase-producing strains, urinary isolates were mostly classified into B2 (41.7%) and D (25%) phylogenetic groups, while other clinical isolates belonged to B1 (25%) and A (8.3%) groups. The frequency of virulence-associated genes was also investigated in all isolates and ranged from 6.6% for hly to 75% for fimA . The emergence of carbapenemase-producing strains is a growing concern to public health. Therefore, the proper implementation of monitoring programs is crucial for limiting their dissemination."
https://openalex.org/W4280517781,"Introduction Cervix, breast and oral cancers account for about one-third of all cancers in India which as a group is a major contributor to all non-communicable disease-related morbidity and mortality among women. Existing evidence suggests that early diagnosis plays a pivotal role in the prevention and intervention of these cancers, and many community-based early screening and awareness programs have been in place in developed countries. Currently, there is not enough research evidence regarding the sociodemographic correlates of cervix, breast and oral cancer screening among Indian women. In the present study, we aimed to assess the self-reported percentage and sociodemographic factors associated with the use of these three types of cancer screening services among Indian women aged 15–49 years. Methods Data were collected from National Family Health Survey conducted during 2015–16. Sample population was 699,686 women aged 15–49 years. Associations between self-reported cervical, breast and oral cancer screening status and the associated sociodemographic factors were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression methods. Results The percentage of screening for cervical (21%), breast (8.95%), and oral cancers (13.45%) varied significantly across the population sub-groups. Higher age, urban residence, higher education, having employment, health insurance, use of electronic media, higher household wealth quintile, having healthcare autonomy, showed a positive effect on taking screening services. Further analyses revealed that the strength of the associations varied considerably between urban and rural residents, denoting the need for region-specific intervention strategies. Sex of household head, age, watching TV, using radio, and having health insurance were the most significant contributors to the outcome effects. Conclusions The present study provides important insights regarding the current scenario of seeking cancer screening services among women in India. These findings could inform policy analysis and make an avenue for further in-depth analysis for future studies. Our findings conclude that cancer prevention policies should focus on leveraging the positive effects of better socioeconomic status, employment, health insurance ownership, exposure to electronic media, and better healthcare autonomy to improve the cancer screening service uptake among Indian women."
https://openalex.org/W4280533094,"This research examines how curriculum delivery predicts entrepreneurial skills, with knowledge of information and communication technology (ICT) as a mediator. Curriculum delivery with the multiple dimensions of objectives, contents, teaching strategies, and feedback and assessment was used in this study, and a quantitative research design was adopted. A questionnaire survey was used to collect data from 482 students at six universities in Lahore, Pakistan, and the partial-least-squares structural equation model in SmartPLS 3.2 was used for data analysis. The results show that all dimensions of curriculum delivery (i) do not influence entrepreneurial skills and (ii) positively influence the knowledge of ICT. Also, in the indirect relationships, all dimensions of curriculum delivery (i.e., objectives, contents, teaching strategies, and feedback and assessment) are associated positively with ICT knowledge. Therefore, ICT knowledge plays a mediating role between curriculum delivery and entrepreneurial skills. The results also show that curriculum delivery for educational entrepreneurs is not working effectively and efficiently in Pakistani universities, and it is concluded that curriculum delivery and ICT knowledge boost entrepreneurial skills. Finally, the conclusions, limitations, and practical implications of this study are presented in detail."
https://openalex.org/W4280620777,"The European Union Brexit referendum has divided the British electorate, with high levels of animosity between those who affiliate with the Remain side (Remainers) and the Leave side (Leavers) of the debate. Previous research has shown that a brief befriending meditation reduces affective polarization among Democrats and Republicans in the United States, but the results have not been replicated in a non-US sample and the psychological mechanisms underlying the effects have yet to be examined. The present study therefore used a post-test only randomized controlled design to investigate the effects of a brief befriending meditation on affective polarization among Remainers and Leavers (n = 922). Results showed that participants in the befriending condition scored modestly lower on affective polarization than participants in the attentional control condition (t(921) = 2.17, p = .030, d = 0.14) and that perceived commonality with the political outgroup mediated the effects. In sum, audio-guided befriending practices may be a highly scalable means to reduce high levels of affective polarization through increasing perceived commonality."
https://openalex.org/W4229443782,"Since December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has quickly spread across the world. The traditional understanding of the relationship between wealth and the spread of contagious diseases is that similar to many precedent epidemics, the pandemic spread easily in poor neighborhoods in many countries. The environmental and socioeconomic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic are still poorly understood, thus this paper examines the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and the spread of the pandemic through a case study of Shenzhen, a Chinese megacity with many low-income rural migrants. The major finding is that wealthier and larger neighborhoods in Shenzhen were more likely to be infected in the first wave of the pandemic in 2020. This spread pattern is likely to result from China’s strict control to prevent the pandemic, human mobility, and demographic characteristics such as income. This finding reveals a new phenomenon that contrasts with the traditional understanding of the influence of wealth on the spread of epidemics. This paper enriches the understanding of the role of neighborhoods in the spread of the pandemic, and it has important public policy implications."

https://openalex.org/W4229446921,"Neophobia (aversion to new objects, food, and environments) is a personality trait that affects the ability of wildlife to adapt to new challenges and opportunities. Despite the ubiquity and importance of this trait, the molecular mechanisms underlying repeatable individual differences in neophobia in wild animals are poorly understood. We evaluated wild-caught house sparrows ( Passer domesticus ) for neophobia in the lab using novel object tests. We then selected a subset of neophobic and non-neophobic individuals (n = 3 of each, all females) and extracted RNA from four brain regions involved in learning, memory, threat perception, and executive function: striatum, caudal dorsomedial hippocampus, medial ventral arcopallium, and caudolateral nidopallium (NCL). Our analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) used 11,889 gene regions annotated in the house sparrow reference genome for which we had an average of 25.7 million mapped reads/sample. PERMANOVA identified significant effects of brain region, phenotype (neophobic vs. non-neophobic), and a brain region by phenotype interaction. Comparing neophobic and non-neophobic birds revealed constitutive differences in DEGs in three of the four brain regions examined: hippocampus (12% of the transcriptome significantly differentially expressed), striatum (4%) and NCL (3%). DEGs included important known neuroendocrine mediators of learning, memory, executive function, and anxiety behavior, including serotonin receptor 5A, dopamine receptors 1, 2 and 5 (downregulated in neophobic birds), and estrogen receptor beta (upregulated in neophobic birds). These results suggest that some of the behavioral differences between phenotypes may be due to underlying gene expression differences in the brain. The large number of DEGs in neophobic and non-neophobic birds also implies that there are major differences in neural function between the two phenotypes that could affect a wide variety of behavioral traits beyond neophobia."

A sample of individuals over 18 years of age, residing in Peru and with no history of COVID-19was evaluated. Factors associated with prevention practices were evaluated using Poisson regressions with variance adjustment by region cluster and stratified by rurality.Of 3231 participants included, 2741 (84.8%) were from urban areas and 490 (15.2%) from rural areas. The frequency of good prevention practices against COVID-19 was 27.8% in our total sample. In urban areas the frequency of good prevention practices was 28.8% and in rural areas it was 22.5%. Factors associated with prevention practices against COVID-19 in both urban and rural areas were male sex (urban: aPR 0.64, 95%CI 0.55-0.75; rural: aPR 0.66, 95%CI 0.54-0.80) and self-considering adequately carrying out prevention practices (urban: aPR 2.48, 95%CI 2.13-2.89; rural: aPR 2.70, 95%CI 2.27-3.19).The frequency of good prevention practices against COVID-19 was less than 30% in both urban and rural areas. There are differences in the factors associated with good preventive practice against COVID-19. Only sex and considering that preventive measures were adequately carried out were associated with good prevention practices in both areas. In view of this, prevention measures should be promoted taking into account cultural principles and considering geographical location in the face of present and future outbreaks or pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W4280497247,"Background Parasitic contamination of vegetables is a public health problem in several countries and a challenge for food safety. With a short path from the field to the table, these foods can suffer several flaws in the good practices of production, transport and packaging which culminate in an offer of contaminated food to consumers. Therefore, this study describes a systematic review protocol with meta-analysis on evaluating the effectiveness of existing sanitation methods in removing parasites from vegetables. Methods The study will be conducted from published studies that report analyzes of parasites in vegetables before and after sanitization processes. The MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, FSTA, LILACS, Scopus and AGRIS electronic databases will be used. In addition, manual searches will be carried out through related articles, references to included articles and directories of theses and dissertations. The primary outcome will be the reduction or absence of parasitic forms in vegetables after the intervention or combined interventions, and the secondary outcomes will include: identification of the main parasites, assessment of the time required for processing and cost-effectiveness analysis. Two authors will independently screen the studies and extract data. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion, and a third reviewer will decide if there is no consensus. The criteria established by the Cochrane Manual (with some adaptations) will be used to assess the risk of bias in the studies and if the results are considered acceptable and sufficiently homogeneous, and a meta-analysis will be performed to synthesize the findings. Discussion The systematic review produced from this protocol will provide evidence on the effectiveness of sanitation protocols for removing parasitic forms in vegetables and will contribute to strengthening food safety, with the adoption of best sanitation practices and prevention of health risks. In addition, the study may highlight possible knowledge gaps that need to be filled with new research. Systematic review registration PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020206929 ."
https://openalex.org/W4280545328,"For effective sampling of mosquitoes in malaria surveillance programmes, it is essential to include attractive cues in traps. With the aim of implementing a citizen science project on malaria vectors in rural Rwanda, a handmade plastic bottle trap was designed and tested in the field to determine its effectiveness in capturing adult Anopheles gambiae sensu lato, the main malaria vector, and other mosquito species. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and light were used as attractive cues. CO2 was produced by inoculating sugar with yeast and water. Light was emitted from a torch by light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Under field conditions in rural Rwanda, three handmade trap designs were compared to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention miniature light traps (CDC-LT) in houses. The trap baited with yeast produced CO2 and light caught the highest number of mosquitoes compared to the traps baited with light alone or CO2 alone. The number of An. gambiae s.l. in the handmade trap with light and CO2 was approximately 9-10% of the number caught with a CDC light trap. This suggests that about 10 volunteers with a handmade trap could capture a similar-sized sample of An. gambiae as one CDC-LT would collect. Based on these findings, the handmade plastic bottle trap baited with sugar fermenting yeast and light represents an option for inclusion in mosquito surveillance activities in a citizen science context."

https://openalex.org/W4280607482,"The Lower Paleolithic Late Acheulian in the Levant marks a fascinating chapter in human cultural and biological evolution. Nevertheless, many aspects of the Late Acheulian are still undeciphered, hindered by the complex nature of each site on the one hand, a scarcity of wide, multidisciplinary studies on the other, and by difficulties in obtaining absolute chronology for this timeframe. Therefore, subjects such as human subsistence strategies and modes of adaptation, regional diversity, and the possible existence and nature of interactions between hominin groups are largely understudied. The discovery and study of Jaljulia, a large-scale Late Acheulian site at the central Coastal Plain, Israel, add valuable insights to the research of this chapter in human history. Considered to represent recurrent occupations at a favored, water and flint-rich setting, the site has provided extensive lithic assemblages obtained from several localities. Absolute chronology places the human activity on-site at roughly 500-300 ky (and possibly even later), which is suggested to be divided into several main occupation phases. Geomorphological and sedimentological analyses show a change in environmental conditions, from aeolian sand deposition and overlying Hamra soil during the Middle Pleistocene to high energy fluvial regime which transported large gravels in a north-south paleo-channel. Wetland environments, correlating to the human activity on site, developed later due to higher sea levels and a coastline shifts to the eastward, which caused a blockage of the Yarkon stream corridor to the sea by marine sand. In this paper we present results of the study of the site, including geomorphological formation and post-depositional processes, absolute chronology, lithic and faunal analyses. The site's extensive lithic assemblages are currently under study and future investigations are expected to shed more light on the technological nature of Late Acheulian Jaljulia."

When sufficient dioxygen is present, efficient prolyl-4-hydroxylation of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-α) subunits (as catalyzed by PHD or EGLN isoforms) signals for HIF-α degradation by promoting its binding to a von Hippel-Lindau protein ubiquitin ligase complex, so reducing the concentration of transcriptionally active heterodimeric α,β-HIF and HIF mediated transcription (1Ivan M.

Variations in the extent of ARD hydroxylation and lifetimes of ARDs coupled with the observation that hydroxylated ARDs bind less tightly to FIH have led to the proposal that ARD hydroxylation is a potential mechanism for establishing “hypoxic memory” (12Cockman M.E.

Here, we report biochemical and biophysical studies on the extent of FIH-catalyzed ASPP family hydroxylation; notably, the results reveal an unprecedented double asparaginyl hydroxylation of the “VNVN” motif present in the ARDs of ASPP1 and ASPP2.ResultsInitial cell evidence for VNVN double hydroxylationInitially, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments involving vectors that overproduce V5-tagged WT ASPP2 (WT ASPP2-V5) and ASPP2 V5 variants with hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged WT FIH (WT HA-FIH) in human bone osteosarcoma epithelia cells (U2OS) (Fig. 1). The ASPP2-V5 variants investigated included an N986A variant without the reported (23Janke K. Brockmeier U. Kuhlmann K. Eisenacher M. Nolde J. Meyer H.E. et al.Factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1) modulates protein interactions of apoptosis-stimulating p53 binding protein 2 (ASPP2).J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126: 2629-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) ASPP2 FIH hydroxylation site at Asp-986 and subsequently an ASPP2 N984A variant. Surprisingly, the alanine variants of the “VNVN” motif in ASPP2-V5 showed increased coimmunoprecipitation of HA-FIH compared with WT ASPP2-V5.To investigate the potential extent of FIH-catalyzed ASPP ARD hydroxylation, ASPP1-V5, ASPP2-V5, and iASPP-V5 encoding vectors were transfected into U2OS and U2OS “FIH CRISPR KO” cell lines (U2OS FIH KO) that were reconstituted with WT HA-FIH, a catalytically inactive HA-FIH D201A variant or an empty vector. LC–MS/MS analysis revealed hydroxylation of iASPP-V5, ASPP1-V5, and ASPP2-V5 in an FIH-dependent manner (Figs. S1–S4). Unexpectedly, in addition to the single hydroxylation of the asparaginyl residues present in the canonical ARD hydroxylation motifs (L…NVN) as reported by Janke et al. (23Janke K. Brockmeier U. Kuhlmann K. Eisenacher M. Nolde J. Meyer H.E. et al.Factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1) modulates protein interactions of apoptosis-stimulating p53 binding protein 2 (ASPP2).J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126: 2629-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), evidence for a second FIH-dependent hydroxylation site was observed at the asparagine two residues away (-2) from the canonical FIH hydroxylation site. Thus, in the cases of ASPP1-V5 and ASPP2-V5, there was evidence for hydroxylation at the VNVN residue (underlined), in addition to the VNVN residue and in the case of iASPP-V5 of the ANVN residue, in addition to the ANVN residue (Figs. S1–S4). Evidence for the double VNVN hydroxylation was only observed in samples with elevated WT HA-FIH levels. Attempts to determine the hydroxylation levels of endogenous ASPPs were unsuccessful, likely because of their relatively low abundance.ASPP peptides are monohydroxylated by FIHTo investigate the extent of FIH-catalyzed ASPP protein ARD hydroxylation, we then tested if ASPP peptides spanning both potential hydroxylation regions are accepted by FIH as substrates (Fig. 1). ASPP peptides (iASPP residues 670–693; ASPP1 residues 932–954; and ASPP2 residues 969–991) were incubated with FIH in the presence of appropriate cosubstrates (2OG, O2) and the cofactor Fe(II), under conditions reported to sustain FIH catalysis (8Hewitson K.S.

Following reaction, all the peptides manifested a clear +16 Da mass shift relative to the substrates, corresponding to a single hydroxylation reaction, which was shown to occur in an FIH-dependent manner (Fig. 1). The modification site was assigned for iASPP at Asn-687, using fragmentation mass spectrometry (MS) (Fig. S5 and Table S1). This (canonical) hydroxylation site corresponds to the previously assigned hydroxylation site on ASPP2 at Asn-986 (23Janke K. Brockmeier U. Kuhlmann K. Eisenacher M. Nolde J. Meyer H.E. et al.Factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1) modulates protein interactions of apoptosis-stimulating p53 binding protein 2 (ASPP2).J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126: 2629-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which is on a loop linking the second and third ARDs of ASPP2 and which is spatially adjacent to the Src homology 3 domain (Fig. S6).To investigate how the ASPPs bind to FIH, we crystallized FIH in complex with iASPP-, ASPP1-, and ASPP2-derived peptides containing the VNVN/ANVN motif (Fig. 2). The structures show that, at least in the crystalline state, all the ASPP fragment peptides bind in a conserved fashion, with the “canonical” asparagine residue orientated for β-hydroxylation, including via hydrogen bonding with Gln-239 of FIH (16Elkins J.M. Hewitson K.S. McNeill L.A. Seibel J.F. Schlemminger I. Pugh C.W. et al.Structure of factor-inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) reveals mechanism of oxidative modification of HIF-1 alpha.J.

The “second” asparagine is positioned in a similar orientation compared with Glu-801 of human HIF-1α with a metal to C-β distance of >10 Å, that is, in these structures, the “second” asparagine is not productively positioned to be hydroxylated (Fig. 2). The binding of the peptides implies that for protein ASPP substrates, at least partial unfolding of the ARDs must occur in order to bind to FIH in a catalytically productive manner, as has been proposed for other ARD substrates (13Coleman M.L. McDonough M.A. Hewitson K.S. Coles C. Mecinovic J. Edelmann M. et al.Asparaginyl hydroxylation of the Notch ankyrin repeat domain by factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor.J. Biol.

We investigated if substrate–enzyme interactions distant from the active site (i.e., not observed in the peptide substrates–FIH complexes) are needed for the VNVN double hydroxylation assigned in cells by producing recombinant forms of the C-terminal domains of iASPP, ASPP1, and ASPP2. Consistent with the cellular results, the C-terminal domains of all three proteins were subjected to FIH-catalyzed hydroxylation assays. LC–MS/MS analysis for all proteins showed evidence for double hydroxylation of the VNVN/ANVN motifs (Figs. S7–S9). The ASPPs were shown to compete with a HIF-1α fragment and a previously reported consensus ankyrin substrate (19Hardy A.P. Prokes I. Kelly L. Campbell I.D. Schofield C.J. Asparaginyl beta-hydroxylation of proteins containing ankyrin repeat domains influences their stability and function.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 392: 994-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) for FIH-catalyzed hydroxylation (Figs. S10–S12), raising the possibility that they might, along with other FIH substrates, be involved in regulating the role of FIH in the hypoxic response. Consensus ARD-derived peptides (19Hardy A.P. Prokes I. Kelly L. Campbell I.D. Schofield C.J. Asparaginyl beta-hydroxylation of proteins containing ankyrin repeat domains influences their stability and function.J. Mol.

To investigate if the VNVN double hydroxylation is specific to ASPPs or can be manifested with other FIH substrates, we conducted a bioinformatic search for human proteins containing a “VNVN” motif in their ankyrin repeats. In the human proteome, we found six members of the ARD family, including ASPP1 and ASPP2, that contain a VNVN motif (Fig. 3). To investigate if these manifest FIH-catalyzed single or double VNVN hydroxylations, we produced recombinant forms of ASB11 and P18-INK4C and tested them for FIH-catalyzed hydroxylation (Fig. 3). MS fragmentation studies provided evidence that ASB11 and P18-INK4C proteins undergo both monohydroxylation and dihydroxylation reactions within their VNVN motif (Figs 3, S14 and S15). Note that ASB11 has also a second assigned hydroxylation site at Asp-125 in the ARD, which is not part of a “VNVN” motif (Fig. S16). Peptides derived from ASB11 and P18-INK4C spanning potential hydroxylation regions, analogous to the ASPP peptides, were not accepted by FIH as substrates under the tested conditions (data not shown).Figure 3Evidence that FIH catalyzes two hydroxylations of ASB11 and p18.

The ability of FIH to catalyze two hydroxylations of the same VNVN motif in the case of ASPP1/2, ASB11, P18, and ANVN, at least in the case of iASPP, within ARDs is unprecedented.The ability of 2OG-dependent oxygenases and related oxygenases/oxidases to catalyze a range of different types of oxidative reactions and to accept multiple substrates is long established in plants and microbes (24Islam M.S.

Chapter 1: biochemical diversity of 2-Oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases.in: 2-Oxoglutarate-Dependent Oxygenases. The Royal Society of Chemistry, London2015: 1-58Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the case of human 2OG oxygenases acting on proteins and nucleic acids, the biologically relevant reactions catalyzed by them are presently limited to hydroxylations (including the sequential oxidation of methyl groups to acids) and N-methyl demethylations likely proceeding via sequential hydroxylation. However, certain 2OG-dependent protein hydroxylases, including FIH, AspH, JMJD6 and some procollagen-modifying enzymes, likely act on multiple substrates (24Islam M.S. Leissing T.M. Chowdhury R.

FIH is of particular interest because not only can it accept both HIF-α isoforms and multiple ARD (and other) proteins but also it can accept different residues as substrates, including Asn, Asp, His, and, at least in isolated form, some D-amino acids (17Yang M.

Günter J. Ruiz-Serrano A. Spielmann P. Fabrizio J.-A.

The human 2OG-dependent prolyl hydroxylase OGFOD1 is also reported both to catalyze a single C-3 hydroxylation of its ribosomal protein 23 substrate and to form a (likely) covalently linked complex with it (29Singleton R.S. Liu-Yi P. Formenti F. Ge W. Sekirnik R. Fischer R. et al.OGFOD1 catalyzes prolyl hydroxylation of RPS23 and is involved in translation control and stress granule formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2014; 111: 4031-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the yeast homolog of human OGFOD1 is reported to catalyze both the single and apparent double hydroxylation of the analogous prolyl residue (30Loenarz C. Sekirnik R. Thalhammer A. Ge W. Spivakovsky E. Mackeen M.M. et al.Hydroxylation of the eukaryotic ribosomal decoding center affects translational accuracy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2014; 111: 4019-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the case of substrate analog studies with isolated FIH, we have also observed that the double hydroxylation of a single residue can occur (d-Leu) though there is no evidence that this reaction is of biological relevance (27Choi H. Hardy A.P. Leissing T.M. Chowdhury R. Nakashima Y. Ge W. et al.A human protein hydroxylase that accepts D-residues.Commun. Chem. 2020; 3: 52Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Evidence that FIH can catalyze the desaturation of certain residues has also been accrued (17Yang M. Chowdhury R. Ge W. Hamed R.B. McDonough M.A. Claridge T.D. et al.Factor-inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor (FIH) catalyses the post-translational hydroxylation of histidinyl residues within ankyrin repeat domains.FEBS J. 2011; 278: 1086-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations imply that the range of oxidative reactions catalyzed by animal 2OG oxygenases, including FIH, likely extend well beyond those presently defined biochemically.Interestingly, we observed two hydroxylations of the VNVN/ANVN motifs with protein substrates but not with ASPP-derived peptide substrates. In the case of peptide substrates, we only observed hydroxylation at the canonical asparagine site, that is, the second asparagine residue in the VNVN or ANVN motifs. These observations are in accord with proposals that enzyme–substrate interactions relatively distant from the FIH active site, likely involving at least partial unfolding of the stereotypically observed ARD conformation, are involved in regulating catalysis by FIH (13Coleman M.L.

https://openalex.org/W4280514935,"Categorical perception identifies a tuning of human perceptual systems that can occur during the execution of a categorisation task. Despite the fact that experimental studies and computational models suggest that this tuning is influenced by task-independent effects (e.g., based on Hebbian and unsupervised learning, UL) and task-dependent effects (e.g., based on reward signals and reinforcement learning, RL), no model studies the UL/RL interaction during the emergence of categorical perception. Here we have investigated the effects of this interaction, proposing a system-level neuro-inspired computational architecture in which a perceptual component integrates UL and RL processes. The model has been tested with a categorisation task and the results show that a balanced mix of unsupervised and reinforcement learning leads to the emergence of a suitable categorical perception and the best performance in the task. Indeed, an excessive unsupervised learning contribution tends to not identify task-relevant features while an excessive reinforcement learning contribution tends to initially learn slowly and then to reach sub-optimal performance. These results are consistent with the experimental evidence regarding categorical activations of extrastriate cortices in healthy conditions. Finally, the results produced by the two extreme cases of our model can explain the existence of several factors that may lead to sensory alterations in autistic people."

We observed that in 100 patients, there were 57 males and 43 females. Immunopositive Her-2 expression was observed in 21% of patients, AR in 13%, ER in 3% and 0% for PR. Patients with betel quid/areca nut mouth habits had significantly absent Her-2 expression (P = 0.035). Also, Her-2 negative patients were also negative for AR expression (P = 0.002). Her-2 positive patients had poor 10-year survival (P = 0.041). A trend of low survival and high recurrence rate was observed in AR positive patients, but this was not significant (P = 0.072). No statistically relevant correlations were seen in the case of ER and PR. In conclusion, Her-2 may be a valuable marker for predicting long-term prognosis of OSCC patients."

Most lung ultrasound protocols published to date are complex and time-consuming. We describe a new illustrative Point-of-care ultrasound Lung Injury Score (PLIS) to help guide the care of patients with COVID-19 and assess if the PLIS would be able to predict COVID-19 patients’ clinical course. Methods This retrospective study describing the novel PLIS was conducted in a large tertiary-level hospital. COVID-19 patients were included if they required any form of respiratory support and had at least one PLIS study during hospitalization. Data collected included PLIS on admission, demographics, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, and patient outcomes. The primary outcome was the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Results A total of 109 patients and 293 PLIS studies were included in our analysis. The mean age was 60.9, and overall mortality was 18.3%. Median PLIS score was 5.0 (3.0–6.0) vs. 2.0 (1.0–3.0) in ICU and non-ICU patients respectively (p&lt;0.001). Total PLIS scores were directly associated with SOFA scores (inter-class correlation 0.63, p&lt;0.001), and multivariate analysis showed that every increase in one PLIS point was associated with a higher risk for ICU admission (O.R 2.09, 95% C.I 1.59–2.75) and in-hospital mortality (O.R 1.54, 95% C.I 1.10–2.16). Conclusions The PLIS for COVID-19 patients is simple and associated with SOFA score, ICU admission, and in-hospital mortality. Further studies are needed to demonstrate whether the PLIS can improve outcomes and become an integral part of the management of COVID-19 patients."
https://openalex.org/W4280565139,"Background Established MRI and emerging X-ray contrast agents for non-invasive imaging of articular cartilage rely on non-selective electrostatic interactions with negatively charged proteoglycans. These contrast agents have limited prognostic utility in diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA) due to the characteristic high turnover of proteoglycans. To overcome this limitation, we developed a radiocontrast agent that targets the type II collagen macromolecule in cartilage and used it to monitor disease progression in a murine model of OA. Methods To confer radiopacity to cartilage contrast agents, the naturally occurring tyrosine derivative 3,5-diiodo-L-tyrosine (DIT) was introduced into a selective peptide for type II collagen. Synthetic DIT peptide derivatives were synthesised by Fmoc-based solid-phase peptide synthesis and binding to ex vivo mouse tibial cartilage evaluated by high-resolution micro-CT. Di-Iodotyrosinated Peptide Imaging of Cartilage (DIPIC) was performed ex vivo and in vivo 4, 8 and 12 weeks in mice after induction of OA by destabilisation of the medial meniscus (DMM). Finally, human osteochondral plugs were imaged ex vivo using DIPIC. Results Fifteen DIT peptides were synthesised and tested, yielding seven leads with varying cartilage binding strengths. DIPIC visualised ex vivo murine articular cartilage comparably to the ex vivo contrast agent phosphotungstic acid. Intra-articular injection of contrast agent followed by in vivo DIPIC enabled delineation of damaged murine articular cartilage. Finally, the translational potential of the contrast agent was confirmed by visualisation of ex vivo human cartilage explants. Conclusion DIPIC has reduction and refinement implications in OA animal research and potential clinical translation to imaging human disease."
https://openalex.org/W4280591995,"Little data exists from sub-Saharan Africa describing incidence and outcomes of sepsis in emergency units and uncertainty exists surrounding optimal management of sepsis in low-income settings. There exists limited data regarding quality care metrics for non-physician clinicians trained in emergency care. The objective of this study was to describe changes in septic patients over time and evaluate associations between sepsis care and mortality.Secondary analysis of a prospective cohort of all consecutive patients seen from 2010-2019 in a rural Ugandan emergency unit staffed by non-physician clinicians was performed using an electronic database based on paper charts. Sepsis was defined as suspected infection with a quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (qSOFA)≥1. Multi-variable logistic regression was used to analyze three-day mortality.Overall, 48,653 patient visits from 2010-2019 yielded 17,490 encounters for patients age≥18 who had suspected infection, including 10,437 with sepsis. The annual proportion of patients with sepsis decreased from 45.0%% to 21.3% and the proportion with malarial sepsis decreased from 17.7% to 2.1% during the study period. Rates of septic patients receiving quality care (""both fluids and anti-infectives"") increased over time (21.2% in 2012 to 32.0% in 2019, p<0.001), but mortality did not significantly improve (4.5% in 2012 to 6.4% in 2019, p = 0.50). The increasing quality of non-physician clinician care was not associated with reduced mortality, and treatment with ""both fluids and antibiotics"" was associated with increased mortality (RR = 1.55, 95%CI 1.10-2.00).The largest study of sepsis management and outcomes ever published in both Uganda and sub-Saharan Africa showed sepsis and malarial sepsis decreasing from 2010 to 2019. The increasing quality of non-physician clinician care did not significantly reduce mortality and treatment with ""both fluids and antibiotics"" increased mortality. With causal associations between antibiotics and mortality deemed implausible, associations between sepsis mortality and interventions likely represent confounding by indication. Defining optimal sepsis care regionally will likely require randomized controlled trials."
https://openalex.org/W4280607432,"Introduction Obesity is characterized by elevated lipids, insulin resistance and relative hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, reducing fertility and increasing risk of pregnancy complications and birth defects. We termed this phenotype ‘Reprometabolic Syndrome’ and showed that it can be recapitulated by acute infusions of lipid/insulin into healthy, normal weight, eumenorrheic women. Herein, we examined the broader impact of hyperlipidemia and euglycemic hyperinsulinemia on anterior pituitary trophic hormones and their targets. Methods Serum FSH, LH, TSH, growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid hormones (free T4, total T3), cortisol, IGF-1, adiponectin, leptin and creatinine were measured in a secondary analysis of an interventional crossover study of 12 normal weight cycling women who underwent saline and heparin (control) infusion, or a euglycemic insulin infusion with heparin and Intralipid ® (lipid/insulin), between days 2–5 in sequential menstrual cycles. Results In contrast to the decrease in gonadotropins, FSH and LH, infusion of lipid/insulin had no significant effects on other trophic hormones; TSH, PRL or GH. Thyroid hormones (fT4 and total T3), cortisol, IGF-1, adiponectin and creatinine also did not differ between saline or lipid/insulin infusion conditions. Leptin increased in response to lipid/insulin (p&lt;0.02). Conclusion Acute hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia exerted differential, cell type specific effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal, adrenal and thyroid axes. Elucidation of mechanisms underlying the selective modulation of pituitary trophic hormones, in response to changes in diet and metabolism, may facilitate therapeutic intervention in obesity-related neuroendocrine and reproductive dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W4280609878,"Obesity and metabolic syndrome are of increasing global concern. In order to understand the basic biology and etiology of obesity, research has turned to animals across the vertebrate spectrum including zebrafish. Here, we carefully characterize zebrafish in a long-term obesogenic environment as well as zebrafish that went through early lifetime caloric restriction. We found that long-term obesity in zebrafish leads to metabolic endpoints comparable to mammals including increased adiposity, weight, hepatic steatosis and hepatic lesions but not signs of glucose dysregulation or differences in metabolic rate or mitochondrial function. Malnutrition in early life has been linked to an increased likelihood to develop and an exacerbation of metabolic syndrome, however fish that were calorically restricted from five days after fertilization until three to nine months of age did not show signs of an exacerbated phenotype. In contrast, the groups that were shifted later in life from caloric restriction to the obesogenic environment did not completely catch up to the long-term obesity group by the end of our experiment. This dataset provides insight into a slowly exacerbating time-course of obesity phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W4280636884,"Notch receptors are determinants of cell fate and function, and play an important role in the regulation of bone development and skeletal remodeling. Lateral Meningocele Syndrome (LMS) is a monogenic disorder associated with NOTCH3 pathogenic variants that result in the stabilization of NOTCH3 and a gain-of-function. LMS presents with neurological developmental abnormalities and bone loss. We created a mouse model (Notch3em1Ecan) harboring a 6691TAATGA mutation in the Notch3 locus, and heterozygous Notch3em1Ecan mice exhibit cancellous and cortical bone osteopenia. In the present work, we explored whether Notch3 antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) downregulate Notch3 and have the potential to ameliorate the osteopenia of Notch3em1Ecan mice. Notch3 ASOs decreased the expression of Notch3 wild type and Notch36691-TAATGA mutant mRNA expressed by Notch3em1Ecan mice in osteoblast cultures without evidence of cellular toxicity. The effect was specific since ASOs did not downregulate Notch1, Notch2 or Notch4. The expression of Notch3 wild type and Notch36691-TAATGA mutant transcripts also was decreased in bone marrow stromal cells and osteocytes following exposure to Notch3 ASOs. In vivo, the subcutaneous administration of Notch3 ASOs at 25 to 50 mg/Kg decreased Notch3 mRNA in the liver, heart and bone. Microcomputed tomography demonstrated that the administration of Notch3 ASOs ameliorates the cortical osteopenia of Notch3em1Ecan mice, and ASOs decreased femoral cortical porosity and increased cortical thickness and bone volume. However, the administration of Notch3 ASOs did not ameliorate the cancellous bone osteopenia of Notchem1Ecan mice. In conclusion, Notch3 ASOs downregulate Notch3 expression in skeletal cells and their systemic administration ameliorates cortical osteopenia in Notch3em1Ecan mice; as such ASOs may become useful strategies in the management of skeletal diseases affected by Notch gain-of-function."
https://openalex.org/W4229440616,"Prosthetic foot stiffness plays a key role in the functional mobility of lower limb prosthesis users. However, limited objective data exists to guide selection of the optimal prosthetic foot stiffness category for a given individual. Clinicians often must rely solely on manufacturer recommendations, which are typically based on the intended user’s weight and general activity level. Availability of comparable forefoot and heel stiffness data would allow for a better understanding of differences between different commercial prosthetic feet, and also between feet of different stiffness categories and foot sizes. Therefore, this study compared forefoot and heel linear stiffness properties across manufacturer-designated stiffness categories and foot sizes. Mechanical testing was completed for five types of commercial prosthetic feet across a range of stiffness categories and three foot-sizes. Data were collected for 56 prosthetic feet, in total. Testing at two discrete angles was conducted to isolate loading of the heel and forefoot components, respectively. Each prosthetic foot was loaded for six cycles while force and displacement data were collected. Forefoot and heel measured stiffness were both significantly associated with stiffness category ( p = .001). There was no evidence that the relationships between stiffness category and measured stiffness differed by foot size (stiffness category by size interaction p = .80). However, there were inconsistencies between the expected and measured stiffness changes across stiffness categories (i.e., magnitude of stiffness changes varied substantially between consecutive stiffness categories of the same feet). While statistical results support that, on average, measured stiffness is positively correlated with stiffness category, force-displacement data suggest substantial variation in measured stiffness across consecutive categories. Published objective mechanical property data for commercial prosthetic feet would likely therefore be helpful to clinicians during prescription."
https://openalex.org/W4280559584,"Although very recently, in Egypt, sick newborn screening has included screening for hepatorenal tyrosinemia, yet, it is not yet included in nationwide neonatal screening and hence diagnosis may be delayed. The aim of this study was to analyze data of all cases presenting with hepatorenal tyrosinemia to the Pediatric Hepatology Unit, Cairo University, Egypt from 2006 to 2019. Data were retrieved from patients' files including age of onset of symptoms, clinical signs, blood counts, liver functions, serum phosphorous, alpha-fetoprotein, succinylacetone and abdominal ultrasound. During this period, 76 patients were diagnosed with hepatorenal tyrosinemia if succinylacetone in dry blood spot was elevated above 1 μmol/L. These 76 cases came from 70 families; consanguinity was reported in 61 families. In our cohort we reported 30 affected siblings with a similar clinical presentation, who died undiagnosed. Presentation was acute in 26%, subacute in 30% and chronic in 43%. Abdominal distention was the commonest presenting symptom (52.6%). Coagulopathy was the commonest derangement in liver functions; hyperbilirubinemia and raised transaminases were less common. Ultrasound findings included hepatic focal lesions in 47% and enlarged echogenic kidneys in 39% and 45.3% respectively. Only 20 children were treated with Nitisinone because of unavailability and high costs; seven out of them underwent liver transplantation. In conclusion, although hepatorenal tyrosinemia is a rare inborn error of metabolism, in a large population country with high rate of consanguinity; this disease is not uncommonly diagnosed. The current treatment is not readily available because of the costs in a resource-limited country. Neonatal screening and subsidization of the costly medication need to be considered."
https://openalex.org/W4280561200,"Diabetes mellitus causes an increased incidence of congenital heart malformations. However, the pathogenesis and potential epigenetic mechanism involved in this process are unclear. In this study, we used MethylRAD sequencing to compare changes in methylation levels in the genomic landscapes in the fetal heart in a rat model of hyperglycemia. Our results showed that methylation of CCGG/CCNGG sites were mostly enriched in intergenic regions, followed by intron, exon, upstream and the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions. qRT-PCR results confirmed the MethylRAD sequencing findings, suggesting that abnormal CCGG/CCNGG methylation in the upstream region regulated gene expression. The differential methylation genes (DMGs) based on the CCGG and CCNGG sites in the upstream region were examined by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis. Gene Ontology indicated that the CCGG-based DMGs involved in biological process and function were mainly related to transcription and co-SMAD binding. The CCNGG-based DMGs were mainly related to transcription and cytokine-mediated signaling pathways. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis indicated that CCGG-based DMGs were mainly involved in the Wnt signaling and TGF-β signaling pathways. CCNGG-based DMGs were involved in the TNF signaling and apoptosis pathways. These genes may play dominant roles in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and heart disease and require further study. These genes may also serve as potential molecular targets or diagnostic biomarkers for heart malformations under hyperglycemia."
https://openalex.org/W4280564301,"For maize (Zea mays L.), nitrogen (N) fertilizer use is often summarized from field to global scales using average N use efficiency (NUE). But expressing NUE as averages is misleading because grain increase to added N diminishes near optimal yield. Thus, environmental risks increase as economic benefits decrease. Here, we use empirical datasets obtained in North America of maize grain yield response to N fertilizer (n = 189) to create and interpret incremental NUE (iNUE), or the change in NUE with change in N fertilization. We show for those last units of N applied to reach economic optimal N rate (EONR) iNUE for N removed with the grain is only about 6%. Conversely stated, for those last units of N applied over 90% is either lost to the environment during the growing season, remains as inorganic soil N that too may be lost after the growing season, or has been captured within maize stover and roots or soil organic matter pools. Results also showed iNUE decrease averaged 0.63% for medium-textured soils and 0.37% for fine-textured soils, attributable to fine-textured soils being more predisposed to denitrification and/or lower mineralization. Further analysis demonstrated the critical nature growing season water amount and distribution has on iNUE. Conditions with too much rainfall and/or uneven rainfall produced low iNUE. Producers realize this from experience, and it is uncertain weather that largely drives insurance fertilizer additions. Nitrogen fertilization creating low iNUE is environmentally problematic. Our results show that with modest sub-EONR fertilization and minor forgone profit, average NUE improvements of ~10% can be realized. Further, examining iNUE creates unique perspective and ideas for how to improve N fertilizer management tools, educational programs, and public policies and regulations."
https://openalex.org/W4280576798,"The data from the PISA survey show that student performance correlates with socio-economic background, that private schools have higher results and more privileged students, and that this varies between countries. We explore this further and analyze the PISA data using methods from network theory and find clusters of countries whose students have similar performance and socio-economic background. Interestingly, we find a cluster of countries, including China, Spain and Portugal, characterized by less privileged students performing well. When considering private schools only, some countries, such as Portugal and Brazil, are in a cluster with mostly wealthy countries characterized by privileged students. Swedish grades are compared to PISA results, and we see that the higher grades in private schools are in line with the PISA results, suggesting that there is no grade inflation in this case, but differences in socio-economic background suggest that this is due to school segregation."
https://openalex.org/W4280599740,"Background Nigeria has the highest rates of physical inactivity in Africa. As physical inactivity is a leading global risk factor for non-communicable diseases (NCD), physical activity promotion is a strategy for their mitigation. Physiotherapists are already ideally situated to undertake this role and can assist in the reversal of NCD. Gaining insight into how physiotherapists in Nigeria perceive their role in relation to physical activity promotion is needed to ensure this undertaking will be effective. This national survey aimed to investigate Nigerian physiotherapists’ knowledge and current practice for promoting physical activity across Nigeria and perceptions of their role related to this. Methods Following ethical approval, a cross-sectional, online questionnaire survey design was employed to investigate the aim. 330 qualified physiotherapists, working across Nigeria were recruited. Internal consistency of the survey was examined using Cronbach’s alpha. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse closed questions. Thematic content analysis was used to analyse open-ended questions. Chi-square inferential statistic was used to investigate the association between variables with alpha interpreted at a level of 0.05. Results The internal consistency of the questionnaire survey was good overall (Cronbach Alpha α = 0.71). 330 physiotherapists participated. 99.4% agreed that discussing the benefits of a physically active lifestyle with patients is part of their role. However, over 60% did not feel confident in suggesting specific physical activity programs for their patients. 59.7% were aware of one or more physical activity guideline. However, only 49.1% were incorporating it into their practice. 85.5% felt that developing a physical activity guideline specifically for Nigeria would promote physical activity. 63.3% of respondents did not use any resource in promoting physical activity. An association was found between the physiotherapist’s awareness of physical activity guidelines and male sex (χ 2 = 8.95, df = 2, p = 0.01). Conclusion Whilst most physiotherapists had a positive perception of their role in promoting physical activity, translating this into practice would seem to be challenging. A systems approach to physical activity health promotion is recommended with the need for a commitment by the Nigerian Government to the development and implementation of national guidelines. Incorporating more training in physiotherapy education could foster more confidence in the delivery of these guidelines. Greater use of resources and working with community organisations could help to optimise physical activity uptake in Nigeria."
https://openalex.org/W4280599879,"Introduction As technological advances allow the use of robotic exoskeleton devices with gait training, there is a critical need to establish a robotic gait training (RGT) program to meet the needs of people with spinal cord injury (SCI) during inpatient rehabilitation. The purposes of this study are to prospectively examine the efficacy of a stakeholder informed RGT program compared to usual care gait training (UC) during inpatient rehabilitation in people with incomplete SCI and compare the intensity of RGT and UC gait training during inpatient rehabilitation. Study design 128 patients with incomplete SCI admitted to our inpatient rehabilitation facility will be screened for eligibility and randomized to either the RGT or UC group. RGT sessions will use the Ekso robotic exoskeleton [class II medical device (United States FDA)]. UC sessions will use traditional gait training approaches such as manually assisted overground gait training with walkers and orthotics and body weight–supported treadmill training (BWSTT). Our primary outcome is gait function as characterized by the Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury–II (WISCI-II). Secondary outcomes are gait speed, Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM), Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Penn Spasm Frequency Scale (PSFS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), General Anxiety Disorder– 7 (GAD-7), International Spinal Cord Injury Quality of Life Basic Data Set, and a Qualitative Questionnaire. Assessments of primary and secondary outcomes will occur at admission and discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. General or generalized linear models will be used to analyze differences between groups for all measures. Clinical impact Successful completion of this study will provide a usable, replicable, stakeholder informed RGT intervention for use with individuals with incomplete SCI during inpatient rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W4280624188,"Thermophiles and hyperthermophiles are those organisms which grow at high temperature (> 40°C). The unusual properties of these organisms have received interest in multiple fields of biological research, and have found applications in biotechnology, especially in industrial processes. However, there are few listings of thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organisms and their relevant environmental and physiological data. Such repositories can be used to standardize definitions of thermophile and hyperthermophile limits and tolerances and would mitigate the need for extracting organism data from diverse literature sources across multiple, sometimes loosely related, research fields. Therefore, we have developed ThermoBase, a web-based and freely available database which currently houses comprehensive descriptions for 1238 thermophilic or hyperthermophilic organisms. ThermoBase reports taxonomic, metabolic, environmental, experimental, and physiological information in addition to literature resources. This includes parameters such as coupling ions for chemiosmosis, optimal pH and range, optimal temperature and range, optimal pressure, and optimal salinity. The database interface allows for search features and sorting of parameters. As such, it is the goal of ThermoBase to facilitate and expedite hypothesis generation, literature research, and understanding relating to thermophiles and hyperthermophiles within the scientific community in an accessible and centralized repository. ThermoBase is freely available online at the Astrobiology Habitable Environments Database (AHED; https://ahed.nasa.gov), at the Database Center for Life Science (TogoDB; http://togodb.org/db/thermobase), and in the S1 File."

The study assessed the presence and characteristics of ASPs, implemented antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) strategies and the challenges to their implementation in hospitals in Uganda. We conducted a cross-sectional study among heads of infection prevention committees (IPCs) in regional referral hospitals, general hospitals, and private-not-for-profit (PNFP) hospitals from November 2019 to February 2020. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. We analysed data using descriptive statistics. A total of 32 heads of IPCs were enrolled in the study. Of these, eight were from regional referral hospitals, 21 were from general hospitals, and three were from PNFPs. Most heads of IPC were pharmacists (17/32, 53.1%) with a mean age and standard deviation (sd) of 36.1 (±1.1) years. A formal ASP was adopted or implemented in 14 out of the 32 (44%, 95% CI 26–62) studied hospitals. Thirty out of 32 hospitals implemented at least one type of AMS strategy. Sixty-eight percent (22/32) of the hospitals implemented pre-authorisation and approval as their primary AMS core strategy to optimise antibacterial use. The most commonly reported challenges to the implementation of ASP across all 32 hospitals (with or without ASP) were lack of time for the ASP team (29/32, 90.6%) and lack of allocated funding for antimicrobial stewardship team (29/32, 90.6%). In this study, most hospitals in Uganda implemented at least one AMS strategy despite the low implementation of ASPs in hospitals. The ministry of health needs to sensitise and support the establishment of ASP in hospitals across the country."

https://openalex.org/W4280500757,"African cichlids are well established models for studying social hierarchies in teleosts and elucidating the effects social dominance has on gene expression. Ascension in the social hierarchy has been found to increase plasma levels of steroid hormones, follicle stimulating hormone (Fsh) and luteinizing hormone (Lh) as well as gonadosomatic index (GSI). Furthermore, the expression of genes related to gonadotropins and steroidogenesis and signaling along the brain-pituitary-gonad axis (BPG-axis) is affected by changes of an animal's social status. In this study, we use RNA-sequencing to obtain an in-depth look at the transcriptomes of testes and pituitaries from dominant and subordinate male Nile tilapia living in long-term stable social hierarchies. This allows us to draw conclusions about factors along the brain-pituitary-gonad axis that are involved in maintaining dominance over weeks or even months. We identify a number of genes that are differentially regulated between dominant and subordinate males and show that in high-ranking fish this subset of genes is generally upregulated. Genes differentially expressed between the two social groups comprise growth factors, related binding proteins and receptors, components of Wnt-, Tgfβ- and retinoic acid-signaling pathway, gonadotropin signaling and steroidogenesis pathways. The latter is backed up by elevated levels of 11-ketotestosterone, testosterone and estradiol in dominant males. Luteinizing hormone (Lh) is found in higher concentration in the plasma of long-term dominant males than in subordinate animals. Our results both strengthen the existing models and propose new candidates for functional studies to expand our understanding of social phenomena in teleost fish."
https://openalex.org/W4280591095,"This is the first taxonomic study of cirratulid polychaetes of the genus Kirkegaardia Blake, 2016 from Brazil. Nine new species of the genus are described from the Southern Brazilian coast (50–3000 m deep). The genus Kirkegaardia is generally subdivided into three distinct groups of species ( Kirkegaardia dorsobranchialis - heterochaeta , Kirkegaardia baptisteae - tesselata and Kirkegaardia luticastella ) and several out-group species for which relationships remains to be defined. In this study, new species were included in the Kirkegaardia dorsobranchialis - heterochaeta and Kirkegaardia baptisteae - tesselata groups. Kirkegaardia dorsobranchialis - heterochaeta is characterized by thoracic parapodia elevated producing a channel between the notopodia, elongate pre-setigerous region that is either entirely smooth or modified with a dorsal ridge and/or rings, and noto- and neurosetae capillaries denticulated. As belonging to this group, K . blakei sp. nov., K . brisae sp. nov., K . goytaca sp. nov., K . jongo sp. nov. and K . papaveroi sp. nov. are described here. Kirkegaardia baptisteae - tesselata includes species that lack thoracic parapodia elevated and mid-dorsal thoracic groove, although a dorsal ridge is sometimes developed. In the pre-setigerous region dorsal ridges and rings are present or absent. Most species in this group have neurosetae denticulated, and notosetae capillaries of other types.

https://openalex.org/W4280607609,"The present study investigated 7-month-old infants’ ability to perceive structural symmetry in mosaic-like abstract visual patterns. We examined infants’ (n = 98) spontaneous looking behaviour to mosaic-like sequences with symmetrical and asymmetrical structures. Sequences were composed of square tiles from two categories that differed in their colour scheme and internal shape. We manipulated sequence length (3 or 5 tiles) and abstractness of the symmetry (token vs. category level). The 7-month-olds discriminated structurally symmetrical from asymmetrical mosaics in the first half of the test phase (first 8 trials). Sequence length, level of symmetry, or number of unique tiles per sequence did not significantly modulate infants’ looking behaviour. These results suggest that very young infants detect differences in structural symmetry in multi-featured visual patterns."
https://openalex.org/W4280623461,"To increase power and minimize bias in statistical analyses, quantitative outcomes are often adjusted for precision and confounding variables using standard regression approaches. The outcome is modeled as a linear function of the precision variables and confounders; however, for many complex phenotypes, the assumptions of the linear regression models are not always met. As an alternative, we used neural networks for the modeling of complex phenotypes and covariate adjustments. We compared the prediction accuracy of the neural network models to that of classical approaches based on linear regression. Using data from the UK Biobank, COPDGene study, and Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), we examined the features of neural networks in this context and compared them with traditional regression approaches for prediction of three outcomes: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), age at smoking cessation, and log transformation of age at smoking cessation (due to age at smoking cessation being right-skewed). We used mean squared error to compare neural network and regression models, and found the models performed similarly unless the observed distribution of the phenotype was skewed, in which case the neural network had smaller mean squared error. Our results suggest neural network models have an advantage over standard regression approaches when the phenotypic distribution is skewed. However, when the distribution is not skewed, the approaches performed similarly. Our findings are relevant to studies that analyze phenotypes that are skewed by nature or where the phenotype of interest is skewed as a result of the ascertainment condition."
https://openalex.org/W4280648157,"Generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and logistic regression (LR) are extensively used in the medical field; however, the better model for predicting stroke outcome has not been established. The primary goal of this study was to compare the accuracies of GRNN and LR models to identify the most optimal model for the prediction of acute stroke outcome, as well as explore useful biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of acute stroke patients.In a single-center study, 216 (80% for the training set and 20% for the test set) acute stroke patients admitted to the Shenzhen Second People's Hospital between December 2019 to June 2021 were retrospectively recruited. The functional outcomes of the patients were measured using Barthel Index (BI) on discharge. A training set was used to optimize the GRNN and LR models. The test set was utilized to validate and compare the performances of GRNN and LR in predicting acute stroke outcome based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), accuracy, sensitivity, and the Kappa value.The LR analysis showed that age, the National Institute Health Stroke Scale score, BI index, hemoglobin, and albumin were independently associated with stroke outcome. After validating in test set using these variables, we found that the GRNN model showed a better performance based on AUROC (0.931 vs 0.702), sensitivity (0.933 vs 0.700), specificity (0.889 vs 0.722), accuracy (0.896 vs 0.729), and the Kappa value (0.775 vs 0.416) than the LR model.Overall, the GRNN model demonstrated superior performance to the LR model in predicting the prognosis of acute stroke patients. In addition to its advantage in not affected by implicit interactions and complex relationship in the data. Thus, we suggested that GRNN could be served as the optimal statistical model for acute stroke outcome prediction. Simultaneously, prospective validation based on more variables of the GRNN model for the prediction is required in future studies."
