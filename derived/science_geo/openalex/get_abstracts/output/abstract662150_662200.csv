https://openalex.org/W3094968263,"SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persist As the number of daily COVID-19 cases continues to mount worldwide, the nature of the humoral immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains uncertain. Wajnberg et al. used a cohort of more than 30,000 infected individuals with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms to determine the robustness and longevity of the anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibody response. They found that neutralizing antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein persisted for at least 5 months after infection. Although continued monitoring of this cohort will be needed to confirm the longevity and potency of this response, these preliminary results suggest that the chance of reinfection may be lower than is currently feared.

https://openalex.org/W3096177766,"There is an urgent need to create novel models using human disease-relevant cells to study severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) biology and to facilitate drug screening. Here, as SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract, we developed a lung organoid model using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-LOs). The hPSC-LOs (particularly alveolar type-II-like cells) are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and showed robust induction of chemokines following SARS-CoV-2 infection, similar to what is seen in patients with COVID-19. Nearly 25% of these patients also have gastrointestinal manifestations, which are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes1. We therefore also generated complementary hPSC-derived colonic organoids (hPSC-COs) to explore the response of colonic cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that multiple colonic cell types, especially enterocytes, express ACE2 and are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using hPSC-LOs, we performed a high-throughput screen of drugs approved by the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) and identified entry inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2, including imatinib, mycophenolic acid and quinacrine dihydrochloride. Treatment at physiologically relevant levels of these drugs significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of both hPSC-LOs and hPSC-COs. Together, these data demonstrate that hPSC-LOs and hPSC-COs infected by SARS-CoV-2 can serve as disease models to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide a valuable resource for drug screening to identify candidate COVID-19 therapeutics. The use of lung and colonic organoid systems to assess the susceptibility of lung and gut cells to SARS-CoV-2 and to screen FDA-approved drugs that have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 is demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W3093347896,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, leads to respiratory symptoms that can be fatal. However, neurological symptoms have also been observed in some patients. The cause of these complications is currently unknown. Here, we use human-pluripotent-stem-cell-derived brain organoids to examine SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism. We find expression of viral receptor ACE2 in mature choroid plexus cells expressing abundant lipoproteins, but not in neurons or other cell types. We challenge organoids with SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus and live virus to demonstrate viral tropism for choroid plexus epithelial cells but little to no infection of neurons or glia. We find that infected cells are apolipoprotein- and ACE2-expressing cells of the choroid plexus epithelial barrier. Finally, we show that infection with SARS-CoV-2 damages the choroid plexus epithelium, leading to leakage across this important barrier that normally prevents entry of pathogens, immune cells, and cytokines into cerebrospinal fluid and the brain."
https://openalex.org/W3094802395,"Myeloid malignancies, including acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), arise from the expansion of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells that acquire somatic mutations. Bulk molecular profiling has suggested that mutations are acquired in a stepwise fashion: mutant genes with high variant allele frequencies appear early in leukaemogenesis, and mutations with lower variant allele frequencies are thought to be acquired later1–3. Although bulk sequencing can provide information about leukaemia biology and prognosis, it cannot distinguish which mutations occur in the same clone(s), accurately measure clonal complexity, or definitively elucidate the order of mutations. To delineate the clonal framework of myeloid malignancies, we performed single-cell mutational profiling on 146 samples from 123 patients. Here we show that AML is dominated by a small number of clones, which frequently harbour co-occurring mutations in epigenetic regulators. Conversely, mutations in signalling genes often occur more than once in distinct subclones, consistent with increasing clonal diversity. We mapped clonal trajectories for each sample and uncovered combinations of mutations that synergized to promote clonal expansion and dominance. Finally, we combined protein expression with mutational analysis to map somatic genotype and clonal architecture with immunophenotype. Our findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of myeloid transformation and how clonal complexity evolves with disease progression. The evolution of myeloid malignancies is investigated using combined single-cell sequencing and immunophenotypic analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3096303972,"Limiting the rise in global mean temperatures relies on reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and on the removal of CO2 by land carbon sinks. China is currently the single largest emitter of CO2, responsible for approximately 27 per cent (2.67 petagrams of carbon per year) of global fossil fuel emissions in 20171. Understanding of Chinese land biosphere fluxes has been hampered by sparse data coverage2-4, which has resulted in a wide range of a posteriori estimates of flux. Here we present recently available data on the atmospheric mole fraction of CO2, measured from six sites across China during 2009 to 2016. Using these data, we estimate a mean Chinese land biosphere sink of -1.11 ± 0.38 petagrams of carbon per year during 2010 to 2016, equivalent to about 45 per cent of our estimate of annual Chinese anthropogenic emissions over that period. Our estimate reflects a previously underestimated land carbon sink over southwest China (Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangxi provinces) throughout the year, and over northeast China (especially Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces) during summer months. These provinces have established a pattern of rapid afforestation of progressively larger regions5,6, with provincial forest areas increasing by between 0.04 million and 0.44 million hectares per year over the past 10 to 15 years. These large-scale changes reflect the expansion of fast-growing plantation forests that contribute to timber exports and the domestic production of paper7. Space-borne observations of vegetation greenness show a large increase with time over this study period, supporting the timing and increase in the land carbon sink over these afforestation regions."
https://openalex.org/W3096478584,"The discoveries of intrinsically magnetic topological materials, including semimetals with a large anomalous Hall effect and axion insulators, have directed fundamental research in solid-state materials. Topological quantum chemistry has enabled the understanding of and the search for paramagnetic topological materials. Using magnetic topological indices obtained from magnetic topological quantum chemistry (MTQC), here we perform a high-throughput search for magnetic topological materials based on first-principles calculations. We use as our starting point the Magnetic Materials Database on the Bilbao Crystallographic Server, which contains more than 549 magnetic compounds with magnetic structures deduced from neutron-scattering experiments, and identify 130 enforced semimetals (for which the band crossings are implied by symmetry eigenvalues), and topological insulators. For each compound, we perform complete electronic structure calculations, which include complete topological phase diagrams using different values of the Hubbard potential. Using a custom code to find the magnetic co-representations of all bands in all magnetic space groups, we generate data to be fed into the algorithm of MTQC to determine the topology of each magnetic material. Several of these materials display previously unknown topological phases, including symmetry-indicated magnetic semimetals, three-dimensional anomalous Hall insulators and higher-order magnetic semimetals. We analyse topological trends in the materials under varying interactions: 60 per cent of the 130 topological materials have topologies sensitive to interactions, and the others have stable topologies under varying interactions. We provide a materials database for future experimental studies and open-source code for diagnosing topologies of magnetic materials."

https://openalex.org/W3096332317,"The anterolateral pathway consists of ascending spinal tracts that convey pain, temperature and touch information from the spinal cord to the brain1-4. Projection neurons of the anterolateral pathway are attractive therapeutic targets for pain treatment because nociceptive signals emanating from the periphery are channelled through these spinal projection neurons en route to the brain. However, the organizational logic of the anterolateral pathway remains poorly understood. Here we show that two populations of projection neurons that express the structurally related G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) TACR1 and GPR83 form parallel ascending circuit modules that cooperate to convey thermal, tactile and noxious cutaneous signals from the spinal cord to the lateral parabrachial nucleus of the pons. Within this nucleus, axons of spinoparabrachial (SPB) neurons that express Tacr1 or Gpr83 innervate distinct sets of subnuclei, and strong optogenetic stimulation of the axon terminals induces distinct escape behaviours and autonomic responses. Moreover, SPB neurons that express Gpr83 are highly sensitive to cutaneous mechanical stimuli and receive strong synaptic inputs from both high- and low-threshold primary mechanosensory neurons. Notably, the valence associated with activation of SPB neurons that express Gpr83 can be either positive or negative, depending on stimulus intensity. These findings reveal anatomically, physiologically and functionally distinct subdivisions of the SPB tract that underlie affective aspects of touch and pain."

https://openalex.org/W3096649342,"Boronic acids and their derivatives are some of the most useful reagents in the chemical sciences1, with applications spanning pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and functional materials. Catalytic C–H borylation is a powerful method for introducing these and other boron groups into organic molecules because it can be used to directly functionalize C–H bonds of feedstock chemicals without the need for substrate pre-activation1–3. These reactions have traditionally relied on precious-metal catalysts for C–H bond cleavage and, as a result, display high selectivity for borylation of aromatic C(sp2)–H bonds over aliphatic C(sp3)–H bonds4. Here we report a mechanistically distinct, metal-free borylation using hydrogen atom transfer catalysis5, in which homolytic cleavage of C(sp3)–H bonds produces alkyl radicals that are borylated by direct reaction with a diboron reagent. The reaction proceeds by violet-light photoinduced electron transfer between an N-alkoxyphthalimide-based oxidant and a chloride hydrogen atom transfer catalyst. Unusually, stronger methyl C–H bonds are borylated preferentially over weaker secondary, tertiary and even benzylic C–H bonds. Mechanistic studies indicate that the high methyl selectivity is a result of the formation of a chlorine radical–boron ‘ate’ complex that selectively cleaves sterically unhindered C–H bonds. By using a photoinduced hydrogen atom transfer strategy, this metal-free C(sp3)–H borylation enables unreactive alkanes to be transformed into valuable organoboron reagents under mild conditions and with selectivities that contrast with those of established metal-catalysed protocols. Metal-free borylation of C(sp3)–H bonds by violet-light-induced hydrogen atom transfer is reported, demonstrating high selectivity for the substitution of methyl C–H bonds over other weaker C–H bonds."
https://openalex.org/W3097817819,"Severe respiratory infections can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)1. There are no effective pharmacological therapies that have been shown to improve outcomes for patients with ARDS. Although the host inflammatory response limits spread of and eventually clears the pathogen, immunopathology is a major contributor to tissue damage and ARDS1,2. Here we demonstrate that respiratory viral infection induces distinct fibroblast activation states, which we term extracellular matrix (ECM)-synthesizing, damage-responsive and interferon-responsive states. We provide evidence that excess activity of damage-responsive lung fibroblasts drives lethal immunopathology during severe influenza virus infection. By producing ECM-remodelling enzymes—in particular the ECM protease ADAMTS4—and inflammatory cytokines, damage-responsive fibroblasts modify the lung microenvironment to promote robust immune cell infiltration at the expense of lung function. In three cohorts of human participants, the levels of ADAMTS4 in the lower respiratory tract were associated with the severity of infection with seasonal or avian influenza virus. A therapeutic agent that targets the ECM protease activity of damage-responsive lung fibroblasts could provide a promising approach to preserving lung function and improving clinical outcomes following severe respiratory infections. Viral infection of the respiratory system induces exuberant fibroblast activity, resulting in extensive remodelling of the extracellular matrix and cytokine release, which promote immune cell infiltration of the affected area at the expense of respiratory function."
https://openalex.org/W3101259433,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of unknown origin. Two possible mechanisms that could generate extremely coherent emission from FRBs invoke neutron star magnetospheres or relativistic shocks far from the central energy source. Detailed polarization observations may help us to understand the emission mechanism. However, the available FRB polarization data have been perplexing, because they show a host of polarimetric properties, including either a constant polarization angle during each burst for some repeaters or variable polarization angles in some other apparently one-off events. Here we report observations of 15 bursts from FRB 180301 and find various polarization angle swings in seven of them. The diversity of the polarization angle features of these bursts is consistent with a magnetospheric origin of the radio emission, and disfavours the radiation models invoking relativistic shocks."
https://openalex.org/W3095074479,"Muscle regeneration is sustained by infiltrating macrophages and the consequent activation of satellite cells1–4. Macrophages and satellite cells communicate in different ways1–5, but their metabolic interplay has not been investigated. Here we show, in a mouse model, that muscle injuries and ageing are characterized by intra-tissue restrictions of glutamine. Low levels of glutamine endow macrophages with the metabolic ability to secrete glutamine via enhanced glutamine synthetase (GS) activity, at the expense of glutamine oxidation mediated by glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GLUD1). Glud1-knockout macrophages display constitutively high GS activity, which prevents glutamine shortages. The uptake of macrophage-derived glutamine by satellite cells through the glutamine transporter SLC1A5 activates mTOR and promotes the proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells. Consequently, macrophage-specific deletion or pharmacological inhibition of GLUD1 improves muscle regeneration and functional recovery in response to acute injury, ischaemia or ageing. Conversely, SLC1A5 blockade in satellite cells or GS inactivation in macrophages negatively affects satellite cell functions and muscle regeneration. These results highlight the metabolic crosstalk between satellite cells and macrophages, in which macrophage-derived glutamine sustains the functions of satellite cells. Thus, the targeting of GLUD1 may offer therapeutic opportunities for the regeneration of injured or aged muscles. Mouse models of muscle injuries and ageing characterized by low levels of intra-tissue glutamine are ameliorated by macrophage-specific deletion or systemic pharmacological inhibition of glutamate dehydrogenase 1, which results in constitutively high activity of glutamine synthetase."

Stephen Paget’s “seed and soil” hypothesis posited that metastatic success results from disseminated cancer cell (DCC)-metastatic niche interplay (Paget, 1889Paget S. The distribution of secondary growths in cancer of the breast..Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1889; 2: 98-101Google Scholar). The metastatic niche consists of unique organ-specific cellular and acellular components, which profoundly influence the progression of metastatic disease (Peinado et al., 2017Peinado H. Zhang H. Matei I.R. Costa-Silva B. Hoshino A. Rodrigues G. Psaila B. Kaplan R.N. Bromberg J.F. Kang Y. et al.Pre-metastatic niches: organ-specific homes for metastases.Nat. Rev.

Med. 2013; 19: 1423-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (3462) Google Scholar). Brain metastasis (br-met) is frequently observed clinically. The brain is a complex organ and favorable soil for DCCs derived from non-CNS primary tumors (Achrol et al., 2019Achrol A.S. Rennert R.C. Anders C. Soffietti R. Ahluwalia M.S. Nayak L. Peters S. Arvold N.D. Harsh G.R. Steeg P.S. Chang S.D. Brain metastases.Nat. Rev. Dis. Primers. 2019; 5: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To successfully outgrow in the brain, DCCs must interact with brain-resident cells and infiltrating immune cells—the br-met niche (Winkler, 2015Winkler F. The brain metastatic niche.J. Mol. Med. (Berl.). 2015; 93: 1213-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Such br-met niche cells include astrocytes, endothelial cells, and microglia, among others (Quail and Joyce, 2013Quail D.F.

The brain metastatic niche.J. Mol. Med. (Berl.). 2015; 93: 1213-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Once considered immune-privileged, the brain is now known to have an intricate, diverse immune presence during homeostasis and disease. Central nervous system-native myeloid cells (CNS-myeloids), namely, microglia and border-associated macrophages (BAMs), are the predominant immune population of the homeostatic brain and vitally contribute to brain homeostasis and diseases (Butovsky and Weiner, 2018Butovsky O.

Pivotal mediators of CNS diseases, CNS-myeloids, and BMDMs are implicated in br-met progression. Immune gene signatures from human br-mets have provided clinical evidence on the correlation between the br-met immune niche and br-met outcome (Fischer et al., 2019Fischer G.M. Jalali A.

In this study, combining single-cell analyses with transgenic mouse models targeting and manipulating myeloid cells, we sought to elucidate the role of heterogeneous br-met-associated myeloid cell subsets in regulating br-met outgrowth. We found CNS-myeloids are most influential in promoting br-met by fostering immune suppression via negative immune checkpoints VISTA and PD-L1. Combinatorial targeting of these immune checkpoints presents a new opportunity for clinical management of br-met. Using a human br-met tissue array (Table S1), we observed hypertrophic Iba1+ myeloid cells surrounded and infiltrated human br-mets regardless of primary tumor origin (npatients = 37, ntumor origins = 14) (Figure 1A; Figure S1A), supporting prior observations (He et al., 2006He B.P.

Iba1+ br-met-associated myeloid cells (Br.MAM) also accumulated around and within murine br-mets irrespective of brain anatomical location or br-met stage (Figures 1B and 1C; Figures S1B–S1D). Br.MAM density increased within br-mets relative to the naive brain (Figures 1C and 1D; Figure S1E). Despite morphological heterogeneity, most Br.MAM were hypertrophic with enlarged cell bodies and reduced protrusion features, indicative of activation and a robust response (Figures 1C and 1D) (Heindl et al., 2018Heindl S.

Principal-component analysis (PCA) of the morphological features assessed resulted in two groups, with naive myeloid cells (NMCs) assuming low morphology scores and Br.MAM assuming higher morphology scores, further suggesting their activation (Heindl et al., 2018Heindl S.

We next examined how br-mets altered the brain immune landscape by mass cytometry (CyTOF). t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) showed a contrast in surface-marker expression between the naive brain and br-met (Figures 1G–1I; Figures S1F and S1G). Immune cells from br-mets more highly expressed myeloid cell and functional markers (Figures 1H and 1I; Figure S1G). Manual gating indicated most naive brain leukocytes were homogeneous CNS-myeloids (Figure 1J; Figure S1F), consistent with prior reports (Mrdjen et al., 2018Mrdjen D. Pavlovic A. Hartmann F.J. Schreiner B. Utz S.G. Leung B.P. Lelios I. Heppner F.L. Kipnis J.

In contrast, br-mets were immunologically diverse, inclusive to CNS-myeloids and peripherally derived immune cells, possessing a significant increase in all BMDM subsets and adaptive immune components compared to the naive brain (Figure 1J). Applying a gating scheme complementary to that which we used on mouse samples to human br-met CyTOF data (Friebel et al., 2020Friebel E. Kapolou K. Unger S. Núñez N.G. Utz S. Rushing E.J. Regli L. Weller M. Greter M.

To reveal the molecular underpinnings of the two broad Br.MAM subsets in br-mets, we employed cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes (CITE-seq) (Stoeckius et al., 2017Stoeckius M. Hafemeister C. Stephenson W. Houck-Loomis B. Chattopadhyay P.K. Swerdlow H. Satija R. Smibert P. Simultaneous epitope and transcriptome measurement in single cells.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar), enabling simultaneous transcriptome and surface-marker profiling of naive and br-met-associated immune cells. Projecting sequenced cells from the two conditions on a UMAP showed unique clusters present only in br-mets (Figure 2A). Manual gating on DNA-barcoded antibodies identified CNS-myeloids and BMDMs (Figure 2B; Figures S2A and S2B), the accuracy of which was confirmed by Tmem119 expression in CNS-myeloids and Itga4 expression in BMDMs (Figure 2C) (Bowman et al., 2016Bowman R.L. Klemm F. Akkari L. Pyonteck S.M. Sevenich L. Quail D.F. Dhara S. Simpson K. Gardner E.E.

Reflecting CyTOF profiling, the ratio of CNS-myeloids to BMDMs was higher in the naive brain than in br-mets (Figure 2C).Figure S2CITE-Seq Antibody-Based Gating Strategy and DAM Gene Signature, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) CITE-seq gating strategy for brain leukocytes.(B) CITE-seq gating strategy for blood leukocytes.(C) Proportions of naive or br-met-associated CNS-myeloid (left) or BMDM (right) contributing to each transcriptional cluster pictured in Figure 2D and 2G.(D) Violin plots of DAM stage 1 and stage 2 gene expression in CNS-myeloid split by sample origin (naive brain or br-met-burdened brain).Data in A-D derived from pooled analysis of three biological replicates from each group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) CITE-seq gating strategy for brain leukocytes.

(D) Violin plots of DAM stage 1 and stage 2 gene expression in CNS-myeloid split by sample origin (naive brain or br-met-burdened brain). Data in A-D derived from pooled analysis of three biological replicates from each group. CNS-myeloids were composed of eight transcriptional clusters that shifted on the UMAP between conditions (Figure 2D; Table S2). BAMs were restricted to cluster 3, while microglia of various transcriptional states composed the remaining clusters (Figure 2D). Cluster 0, marked by high expression of microglia homeostatic genes (Cx3cr1, Hexb, Jun), was enriched with naive microglia (Figure S2C; Table S2). Cluster 2 resembled cluster 0 but had higher mitochondrial gene expression and slightly reduced microglia homeostatic gene expression, resembling a primed state (Figure 2D; Table S2). Clusters 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 represented distinct microglia inflammatory states, all of which had reduced expression of microglia homeostatic genes (Figure 2D; Table S2). Cluster 3, composed of BAMs, highly expressed antigen processing and presentation genes (H2-Aa, Ha-Ab1, Cd74) (Figure 2D; Table S2). Differential gene-expression analysis between br-met-associated CNS-myeloids and naive CNS-myeloids identified br-met-associated CNS-myeloids upregulated pro-inflammatory genes (S100a4, S100a6, S100a10), anti-inflammatory genes (Lgals1, Lgals3, Ifitm3), and migration genes (Vim, Anxa) and downregulated microglia homeostatic genes (Cx3cr1, P2ry12, Hexb, Cst3) (Figure 2E; Table S2). Despite downregulating microglia homeostatic genes like Damage Associated Microglia (DAM) (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017Keren-Shaul H. Spinrad A. Weiner A. Matcovitch-Natan O. Dvir-Szternfeld R. Ulland T.K. David E. Baruch K. Lara-Astaiso D. Toth B. et al.A Unique Microglia Type Associated with Restricting Development of Alzheimer’s Disease.Cell. 2017; 169: 1276-1290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar), there were no other gene-expression similarities between br-met-associated CNS-myeloids and DAM (Figure S2D). Last, br-met-associated CNS-myeloids were enriched for canonical macrophage functional pathways (endocytosis, Immunoglobulin E binding, extracellular matrix production and remodeling) and inflammatory pathways relative to their naive counterparts (Figure 2F; Table S2). BMDMs segregated into eight transcriptional clusters (Figure 2G), representing canonical BMDM subsets as inferred by RNA and surface-marker expression (Figure S3A; Table S3). Stark transcriptional heterogeneity existed among and within canonically identified BMDMs but did not represent M1/M2 polarization (Figure 2G; Figure S3B). Several BMDM clusters, including clusters 0 (Ly6CHi monocytes), 1 (Ly6CLo DCs), 5 (neutrophils), and 7, were more abundant in br-mets relative to the naive brain, representing their influx to the brain and/or local expansion (Figure S2C). Genes related to inflammation (Tspo, Isg15, Ifitm2, Anxa2, Irf7) were upregulated, while Hbb-bs, Serinc3, Cd81, and Klf2 were downregulated in br-met-associated BMDMs (Figure 2H; Table S3). Br-met-associated BMDMs had higher enrichment of antigen processing and presentation and immune responsiveness pathways and lower enrichment of motility and lipoxin synthesis pathways (Figure 2I; Table S3). We further subsetted BMDMs into three broad canonically related categories for further analysis: Ly6CHi inflammatory monocytes, Ly6CLo patrolling monocytes, and neutrophils (Figures S3C–S3E). The transcriptional subclusters of each BMDM subset represented distinct canonical subtypes of BMDM and/or distinct transcriptional states (Figures S3C–S3E). Shifting of cluster proportions within each BMDM subpopulation was evident between the naive and br-met state (Figures S3C–S3E), suggesting cell infiltration and plasticity. Finally, we compared gene expression between conditions within each BMDM subset, finding all subsets increased expression of various inflammatory genes (Ifitm1, Il1b, S100a10, and Lgals1), while simultaneously displaying their own unique gene expression changes (Figures S3C–S3E). To validate the human relevance of our observations, we analyzed publicly deposited naive CNS-myeloids (npatients = 3) and br-met (npatients = 3) scRNA-seq datasets (Geirsdottir et al., 2019Geirsdottir L. David E. Keren-Shaul H. Weiner A. Bohlen S.C. Neuber J. Balic A. Giladi A. Sheban F.

Med. 2020; 26: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). As in mice, human br-met-associated CNS-myeloids downregulated microglia homeostatic genes (CX3CR1, CSF1R, TREM2) (Figures 3B and 3C; Table S4). Some of the top upregulated and downregulated genes in mouse br-met-associated CNS-myeloids showed similar trends in humans (upregulated: VIM, LGALS3, IFITM2, LYZ; downregulated: GFP34, CD81) (Figures 3B, 3D, and 3E; Table S4). Cumulatively, these data point toward an active and diverse myeloid response to br-met and indicate our model is clinically relevant. We next directly compared br-met-associated CNS-myeloids and BMDMs. Projecting only br-met-associated myeloid cells on a tSNE showed a general segregation of the two populations with some overlap, particularly in clusters 2 and 4 (Figure 4A). CNS-myeloids were enriched for microglia homeostatic genes and complement genes relative to BMDMs (Figure 4B; Table S5). BMDMs more highly expressed inflammatory genes (S100a11, Lgals, and Il1b) relative to CNS-myeloids (Figure 4B; Table S5). At the gene pathway level, CNS-myeloids were marked by migratory and regulatory gene signatures, while BMDMs were enriched for cell adhesion and antigen-presentation signatures (Figure 4C; Table S5). To investigate the transcriptional plasticity of CNS-myeloids and BMDMs during br-met, we performed RNA velocity (La Manno et al., 2018La Manno G. Soldatov R. Zeisel A. Braun E. Hochgerner H. Petukhov V. Lidschreiber K. Kastriti M.E. Lönnerberg P. Furlan A. et al.RNA velocity of single cells.Nature. 2018; 560: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). RNA velocity showed CNS-myeloids and BMDMs have trajectories directed within their own respective populations and toward each other (Figure 4D, points a and b). Using Dynverse trajectory inference (TI) analysis (Saelens et al., 2019Saelens W. Cannoodt R. Todorov H. Saeys Y. A comparison of single-cell trajectory inference methods.Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), we examined genes correlated with cell trajectory that may drive convergence within (point b) and between (point a) populations (Figure 4E). Inflammatory genes (S100 family genes, Il1b, Tgfbi) were highly expressed along the trajectory of cells leading to both convergent points (Figure 4E). Upon arriving to point a, cells bifurcated into two separate trajectories that either upregulated microglia homeostatic genes (Jun, Fos) or highly expressed mitochondrial genes (Figure 4E). Cells converging to point b upregulated genes related to antigen presentation (CD74 and H2-Aa) and complement (C1qc, C1qa) (Figures 4E and 4F). Seeking transcription factors (TFs) that potentially regulate the cellular convergence, we performed SCENIC regulon analysis (Aibar et al., 2017Aibar S. González-Blas C.B. Moerman T. Huynh-Thu V.A. Imrichova H. Hulselmans G. Rambow F. Marine J.-C. Geurts P. Aerts J. et al.SCENIC: single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 1083-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). TFs Cepbp and Lrrfip1 were enriched in cells moving to point a and point b, respectively (Figure 4G). TFs Mef2c and Atf3 were enriched within point a and point b cells, respectively (Figure 4G). Many target genes of these TFs contribute to the convergence processes along the predicted trajectory (genes in green font on heatmaps in Figure 4E). Collectively, these results highlight myeloid plasticity and suggest there is an appreciable l"
https://openalex.org/W3095623676,"With the explosion of digital media and technologies, scholars, educators and the public have become increasingly vocal about the role that an 'attention economy' has in our lives1. The rise of the current digital culture coincides with longstanding scientific questions about why humans sometimes remember and sometimes forget, and why some individuals remember better than others2-6. Here we examine whether spontaneous attention lapses-in the moment7-12, across individuals13-15 and as a function of everyday media multitasking16-19-negatively correlate with remembering. Electroencephalography and pupillometry measures of attention20,21 were recorded as eighty young adults (mean age, 21.7 years) performed a goal-directed episodic encoding and retrieval task22. Trait-level sustained attention was further quantified using task-based23 and questionnaire measures24,25. Using trial-to-trial retrieval data, we show that tonic lapses in attention in the moment before remembering, assayed by posterior alpha power and pupil diameter, were correlated with reductions in neural signals of goal coding and memory, along with behavioural forgetting. Independent measures of trait-level attention lapsing mediated the relationship between neural assays of lapsing and memory performance, and between media multitasking and memory. Attention lapses partially account for why we remember or forget in the moment, and why some individuals remember better than others. Heavier media multitasking is associated with a propensity to have attention lapses and forget."

https://openalex.org/W3094726667,"Germinal centres, the structures in which B cells evolve to produce antibodies with high affinity for various antigens, usually form transiently in lymphoid organs in response to infection or immunization. In lymphoid organs associated with the gut, however, germinal centres are chronically present. These gut-associated germinal centres can support targeted antibody responses to gut infections and immunization1. But whether B cell selection and antibody affinity maturation take place in the face of the chronic and diverse antigenic stimulation characteristic of these structures under steady state is less clear2–8. Here, by combining multicolour ‘Brainbow’ cell-fate mapping and sequencing of immunoglobulin genes from single cells, we find that 5–10% of gut-associated germinal centres from specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice contain highly dominant ‘winner’ B cell clones at steady state, despite rapid turnover of germinal-centre B cells. Monoclonal antibodies derived from these clones show increased binding, compared with their unmutated precursors, to commensal bacteria, consistent with antigen-driven selection. The frequency of highly selected gut-associated germinal centres is markedly higher in germ-free than in SPF mice, and winner B cells in germ-free germinal centres are enriched in ‘public’ clonotypes found in multiple individuals, indicating strong selection of B cell antigen receptors even in the absence of microbiota. Colonization of germ-free mice with a defined microbial consortium (Oligo-MM12) does not eliminate germ-free-associated clonotypes, yet does induce a concomitant commensal-specific B cell response with the hallmarks of antigen-driven selection. Thus, positive selection of B cells can take place in steady-state gut-associated germinal centres, at a rate that is tunable over a wide range by the presence and composition of the microbiota. Antibody selection and maturation within B cells found in gut-associated germinal centres is stimulated by the gut microbiota, to a degree that depends on the presence and composition of the microbes."
https://openalex.org/W3095108941,"Reproduction induces increased food intake across females of many animal species1–4, providing a physiologically relevant paradigm for the exploration of appetite regulation. Here, by examining the diversity of enteric neurons in Drosophila melanogaster, we identify a key role for gut-innervating neurons with sex- and reproductive state-specific activity in sustaining the increased food intake of mothers during reproduction. Steroid and enteroendocrine hormones functionally remodel these neurons, which leads to the release of their neuropeptide onto the muscles of the crop—a stomach-like organ—after mating. Neuropeptide release changes the dynamics of crop enlargement, resulting in increased food intake, and preventing the post-mating remodelling of enteric neurons reduces both reproductive hyperphagia and reproductive fitness. The plasticity of enteric neurons is therefore key to reproductive success. Our findings provide a mechanism to attain the positive energy balance that sustains gestation, dysregulation of which could contribute to infertility or weight gain. A multi-organ circuit is activated in female flies after mating, leading to changes in enteric neurons that increase food intake."

Magnocellular and parvocellular oxytocin neurons have been proposed to subserve two parallel streams of social information processing, which allow a single molecule to encode a diverse array of ethologically distinct behaviors. Here we provide the first comprehensive characterization of magnocellular and parvocellular oxytocin neurons in male mice, validated across anatomical, projection target, electrophysiological, and transcriptional criteria. We next use novel multiple feature selection tools in Fmr1-KO mice to provide direct evidence that normal functioning of the parvocellular but not magnocellular oxytocin pathway is required for autism-relevant social reward behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that autism risk genes are enriched in parvocellular compared with magnocellular oxytocin neurons. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence that oxytocin-pathway-specific pathogenic mechanisms account for social impairments across a broad range of autism etiologies."
https://openalex.org/W3095273857,"Nearly all classes of coding and non-coding RNA undergo post-transcriptional modification, including RNA methylation. Methylated nucleotides are among the evolutionarily most-conserved features of transfer (t)RNA and ribosomal (r)RNA1,2. Many contemporary methyltransferases use the universal cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a methyl-group donor. SAM and other nucleotide-derived cofactors are considered to be evolutionary leftovers from an RNA world, in which ribozymes may have catalysed essential metabolic reactions beyond self-replication3. Chemically diverse ribozymes seem to have been lost in nature, but may be reconstructed in the laboratory by in vitro selection. Here we report a methyltransferase ribozyme that catalyses the site-specific installation of 1-methyladenosine in a substrate RNA, using O6-methylguanine as a small-molecule cofactor. The ribozyme shows a broad RNA-sequence scope, as exemplified by site-specific adenosine methylation in various RNAs. This finding provides fundamental insights into the catalytic abilities of RNA, serves a synthetic tool to install 1-methyladenosine in RNA and may pave the way to in vitro evolution of other methyltransferase and demethylase ribozymes."

The landing process provided insights into the properties of a cometary nucleus1–3. Here we report an investigation of the previously undiscovered site of the second touchdown, where Philae spent almost two minutes of its cross-comet journey, producing four distinct surface contacts on two adjoining cometary boulders. It exposed primitive water ice—that is, water ice from the time of the comet’s formation 4.5 billion years ago—in their interiors while travelling through a crevice between the boulders. Our multi-instrument observations made 19 months later found that this water ice, mixed with ubiquitous dark organic-rich material, has a local dust/ice mass ratio of $${2.3}_{-0.16}^{+0.2}:1$$ , matching values previously observed in freshly exposed water ice from outbursts4 and water ice in shadow5,6. At the end of the crevice, Philae made a 0.25-metre-deep impression in the boulder ice, providing in situ measurements confirming that primitive ice has a very low compressive strength (less than 12 pascals, softer than freshly fallen light snow) and allowing a key estimation to be made of the porosity (75 ± 7 per cent) of the boulders’ icy interiors. Our results provide constraints for cometary landers seeking access to a volatile-rich ice sample.

https://openalex.org/W3095819098,"<h2>Summary</h2> Learning valence-based responses to favorable and unfavorable options requires judgments of the relative value of the options, a process necessary for species survival. We found, using engineered mice, that circuit connectivity and function of the striosome compartment of the striatum are critical for this type of learning. Calcium imaging during valence-based learning exhibited a selective correlation between learning and striosomal but not matrix signals. This striosomal activity encoded discrimination learning and was correlated with task engagement, which, in turn, could be regulated by chemogenetic excitation and inhibition. Striosomal function during discrimination learning was disturbed with aging and severely so in a mouse model of Huntington's disease. Anatomical and functional connectivity of parvalbumin-positive, putative fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) to striatal projection neurons was enhanced in striosomes compared with matrix in mice that learned. Computational modeling of these findings suggests that FSIs can modulate the striosomal signal-to-noise ratio, crucial for discrimination and learning."
https://openalex.org/W3096408626,"Scale-up of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention in Uganda began with serodiscordant couples (SDC) and has expanded to other most at-risk populations (MARPs). We explored knowledge, acceptability, barriers and facilitators of PrEP use among potential PrEP users in four MARPs (SDC; men who have sex with men [MSM]; female sex workers [FSW], and fisher folk).We administered quantitative surveys to potential PrEP users in multiple settings in Central Uganda at baseline and approximately 9 months after healthcare worker (HCW) training on PrEP.The survey was completed by 250 potential PrEP users at baseline and 125 after HCW training; 55 completed both surveys. For these 250 participants, mean age was 28.5 years (SD 6.9), 47% were male and 6% were transgender women, with approximately even distribution across MARPs and recruitment locations (urban, peri-urban, and rural). Most (65%) had not heard about PrEP. After HCW training, 24% of those sampled were aware of PrEP, and the proportion of those who accurately described PrEP as ""antiretrovirals to be used before HIV exposure"" increased from 54% in the baseline survey to 74% in the second survey (p<0.001). The proportion of participants who reported HCW as a source of PrEP information increased after training (59% vs 91%, p<0.001). In both surveys, nearly all participants indicated they were willing to take PrEP if offered. The most common anticipated barriers to PrEP were stigma, transportation, accessibility, busy schedules, and forgetfulness. Closeness to home was a common facilitator for all participant categories.Initial awareness of PrEP was low, but PrEP knowledge and interest increased among diverse MARPs after HCW training. Demand creation and HCW training will be critical for increasing PrEP awareness among key populations, with support to overcome barriers to PrEP use. These findings should encourage the acceleration of PrEP rollout in Uganda."
https://openalex.org/W3095898357,"In regression modelling the non-linear relationships between explanatory variables and outcome are often effectively modelled using restricted cubic splines (RCS). We focus on situations where the values of the outcome change periodically over time and we define an extension of RCS that considers periodicity by introducing numerical constraints. Practical examples include the estimation of seasonal variations, a common aim in virological research, or the study of hormonal fluctuations within menstrual cycle. Using real and simulated data with binary outcomes we show that periodic RCS can perform better than other methods proposed for periodic data. They greatly reduce the variability of the estimates obtained at the extremes of the period compared to cubic spline methods and require the estimation of fewer parameters; cosinor models perform similarly to the best cubic spline model and their estimates are generally less variable, but only if an appropriate number of harmonics is used. Periodic RCS provide a useful extension of RCS for periodic data when the assumption of equality of the outcome at the beginning and end of the period is scientifically sensible. The implementation of periodic RCS is freely available in peRiodiCS R package and the paper presents examples of their usage for the modelling of the seasonal occurrence of the viruses."
https://openalex.org/W3095271256,"A lack of perfusion has been one of the most significant obstacles for three-dimensional culture systems of organoids and embryonic tissues. Here, we developed a simple and reliable method to implement a perfusable capillary network in vitro. The method employed the self-organization of endothelial cells to generate a capillary network and a static pressure difference for culture medium circulation, which can be easily introduced to standard biological laboratories and enables long-term cultivation of vascular structures. Using this culture system, we perfused the lumen of the self-organized capillary network and observed a flow-induced vascular remodeling process, cell shape changes, and collective cell migration. We also observed an increase in cell proliferation around the self-organized vasculature induced by flow, indicating functional perfusion of the culture medium. We also reconstructed extravasation of tumor and inflammatory cells, and circulation inside spheroids including endothelial cells and human lung fibroblasts. In conclusion, this system is a promising tool to elucidate the mechanisms of various biological processes related to vascular flow."
https://openalex.org/W3096514384,"Honey can be categorized as monofloral and polyfloral honey. There is a strong interest in science and commerce, to further differentiate honey. In the present study, Schefflera abyssinica and polyfloral honey from Sheka Forest, Ethiopia was investigated. Botanical origin was determined based on Melissopalynology. Refractive index, moisture, sugars, ash, pH, free acidity, hydroxymethylfurfural, optical density, diastase activity, protein, and color were determined based on the standard method of the international honey commission (IHC) and AOAC. Antioxidant activity and Antioxidant content were determined using UV- visible spectroscopy. The level of pollen dominancy for monofloral honey (Schefflera abyssinica) ranged from 76.2 to 85.8%. The polyfloral honey stuffed with a variety of pollen grain ranged from 2.2% (Coffea arabica) to 23.2% (Schefflera abyssinica). Schefflera abyssinica honey contained more total phenolic compounds (75.08 ± 2.40 mg GAE/100g), and total flavonoids (42.03 ± 1.49 mg QE/100 g), as well as had stronger DPPH (44.43 ± 0.97%) and hydrogen peroxide (78.00 ± 4.82%) scavenging activity. The principal component analysis revealed that Schefflera abyssinica honey associated with the antioxidant properties of total phenolic, total flavonoids, DPPH, and H2O2., which revealed that floral honey sources can essentially differentiated by antioxidant patterns. The higher electrical conductivity (0.42 ± 0.02 mS/cm), ash (0.41 ± 0.05 g/100g), pH (4.01 ± 0.08), optical density (0.26 ± 0.03) and diastase activity (5.21 ± 0.17 Schade units) were recorded in polyfloral honey. Schefflera abyssinica and polyfloral honey satisfy the requirement of national and international standards. The pollen analysis in combination with antioxidant properties distinguishes Schefflera abyssinica from polyfloral honeys."
https://openalex.org/W3095895348,"Human osteoarthritis cartilage contains chondrocytes (OAC) and mesenchymal stromal cells (OA-MSC). Here, we found that TGF-β had different effects on OA-MSC and OAC, and revealed its lateral signaling mechanism in OA. RNAseq analysis indicated that OA-MSC expressed the same level of Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) Receptor-1A as OAC but only 1/12 of Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-β) Receptor-1. While TGF-β specifically activated SMAD2 in OAC, it also activated BMP signaling-associated SMAD1 in OA-MSC. While TGF-β stimulated chondrogenesis in OAC, it induced hypertrophy, mineralization, and MMP-13 in OA-MSC. Inhibiting TGF-βR1 suppressed MMP-13 in OA-MSC but stimulated it in OAC. In contrast, by specifically targeting BMPR1A/ACVR1 in both cell types, LDN193189 inhibits cartilage degeneration through suppressing hypertrophy and MMP-13 in a mouse osteoarthritis model. Thus, LDN193189, a drug under development to inhibit constitutive BMP signaling during heterotopic ossification, may be re-purposed for OA treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3096345829,"In this work we present a three-stage Machine Learning strategy to country-level risk classification based on countries that are reporting COVID-19 information. A K% binning discretisation (K = 25) is used to create four risk groups of countries based on the risk of transmission (coronavirus cases per million population), risk of mortality (coronavirus deaths per million population), and risk of inability to test (coronavirus tests per million population). The four risk groups produced by K% binning are labelled as ‘low’, ‘medium-low’, ‘medium-high’, and ‘high’. Coronavirus-related data are then removed and the attributes for prediction of the three types of risk are given as the geopolitical and demographic data describing each country. Thus, the calculation of class label is based on coronavirus data but the input attributes are country-level information regardless of coronavirus data. The three four-class classification problems are then explored and benchmarked through leave-one-country-out cross validation to find the strongest model, producing a Stack of Gradient Boosting and Decision Tree algorithms for risk of transmission, a Stack of Support Vector Machine and Extra Trees for risk of mortality, and a Gradient Boosting algorithm for the risk of inability to test. It is noted that high risk for inability to test is often coupled with low risks for transmission and mortality, therefore the risk of inability to test should be interpreted first, before consideration is given to the predicted transmission and mortality risks. Finally, the approach is applied to more recent risk levels to data from September 2020 and weaker results are noted due to the growth of international collaboration detracting useful knowledge from country-level attributes which suggests that similar machine learning approaches are more useful prior to situations later unfolding."
https://openalex.org/W3096948331,"Objectives According to current reporting, the number of active coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections is not evenly distributed, both spatially and temporally. Reported COVID-19 infections may not have properly conveyed the full extent of attention to the pandemic. Furthermore, infection metrics are unlikely to illustrate the full scope of negative consequences of the pandemic and its associated risk to communities. Methods In an effort to better understand the impacts of COVID-19, we concurrently assessed the geospatial and longitudinal distributions of Twitter messages about COVID-19 which were posted between March 3rd and April 13th and compared these results with the number of confirmed cases reported for sub-national levels of the United States. Geospatial hot spot analysis was also conducted to detect geographic areas that might be at elevated risk of spread based on both volume of tweets and number of reported cases. Results Statistically significant aberrations of high numbers of tweets were detected in approximately one-third of US states, most of which had relatively high proportions of rural inhabitants. Geospatial trends toward becoming hotspots for tweets related to COVID-19 were observed for specific rural states in the United States. Discussion Population-adjusted results indicate that rural areas in the U.S. may not have engaged with the COVID-19 topic until later stages of an outbreak. Future studies should explore how this dynamic can inform future outbreak communication and health promotion."
https://openalex.org/W3097663948,"Introduction Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are a leading cause of global perinatal (fetal and neonatal) and maternal morbidity and mortality. We sought to describe HDP and determine the magnitude and risk factors for adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes among women with HDP in southwestern Uganda. Methods We prospectively enrolled pregnant women admitted for delivery and diagnosed with HDP at a tertiary referral hospital in southwestern Uganda from January 2019 to November 2019, excluding women with pre-existing hypertension. The participants were observed and adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes were documented. We used multivariable logistic regression models to determine independent risk factors associated with adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes. Results A total of 103 pregnant women with a new-onset HDP were enrolled. Almost all women, 93.2% (n = 96) had either pre-eclampsia with severe features or eclampsia. The majority, 58% (n = 60) of the participants had an adverse perinatal outcome (36.9% admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (ICU), 20.3% stillbirths, and 1.1% neonatal deaths). Fewer participants, 19.4% (n = 20) had an adverse maternal outcome HELLP syndrome (7.8%), ICU admission (3%), and postpartum hemorrhage (3%). In adjusted analyses, gestational age of < 34 weeks at delivery and birth weight <2.5kg were independent risk factors for adverse perinatal outcomes while referral from another health facility and eclampsia were independent risk factors for adverse maternal outcomes. Conclusion Among women with HDP at our institution, majority had preeclampsia with severe symptoms or eclampsia and an unacceptably high rate of adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes; over a fifth of the mothers experiencing stillbirth. This calls for improved antenatal surveillance of women with HDP and in particular improved neonatal and maternal critical care expertise at delivering facilities. Earlier detection and referral, as well as improvement in initial management at lower level health units and on arrival at the referral site is imperative."
https://openalex.org/W3095612007,"Urease inhibitor (UI) and nitrification inhibitor (NI) can reduce N losses from agricultural soils but effects of inhibitors on N cycle are unclear. A field experiment was conducted with maize to test effects of UI (N-(n-Butyl) thiophosphoric, NBPT) and NI (3,4-dimethylepyrazolephosphate, DMPP) on N uptake and N-cycling soil microbes. Five treatments were imposed: no N fertilizer input (CK), conventional fertilization (CF) and 80% of urea input with NBPT (80%U+UI), with DMPP (80%U+NI) and with half NBPT and half DMPP (80%U+1/2(UI+NI)). There were no significant differences in biomass between 80%U+UI, 80%U+NI and CF but harvest index was increased under 80%U+UI and 80%U+NI. Compared to CF, N use efficiency of grain under 80%U+UI was increased by 7.1%, whereas grain yield and N uptake under 80%U+1/2(UI+NI) were decreased by 8.2% and 9.4%, respectively. The peak soil content was at about 15 days after fertilization (DAF) under CF but 30 DAF under the inhibitor treatments. In soils of 80%U+UI, the activities of urease and nitrate reductase were decreased between 15–45 DAF and between 5–30 DAF. The abundance of N-cycling soil microbes was affected: 80%U+UI and 80%U+NI reduced the copies of the amoA AOA and nir genes at about 15 days and reduced the copies of the amoA AOB gene at about 30 days. Correlation analysis indicated that there were significant positive relationships between amoA AOB gene and , as well as between nirK gene and . Overall, urea applied with NBPT has greater potential for improving maize N use efficiency and inhibiting nitrification under reduced fertilizer-N applications."
https://openalex.org/W3095178657,"Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a powerful technique to obtain high-resolution subsurface models, from seismic data. However, FWI is an ill-posed problem, which means that the solution is not unique, and therefore the expert use of the information is required to mitigate the FWI ill-posedness, especially when wide-aperture seismic acquisitions are considered. In this way, we investigate the multiscale frequency-domain FWI by using a weighting operator according to the distances between each source-receiver pair. In this work, we propose a weighting operator that acts on the data misfit as preconditioning of the objective function that depends on the source-receiver distance (offset) and the frequency used during the inversion. The proposed operator emphasizes information from long offsets, especially at low frequencies, and as a consequence improves the update of deep geological structures. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal, we perform numerical simulations on 2D acoustic Marmousi2 case study, which is widely used in seismic imaging tests, considering three different scenarios. In the first two ones, we have used an acquisition geometry with a maximum offset of 4 and 8 km, respectively. In the last one, we have considered all-offsets. The results show that our proposal outperforms similar strategies, for all scenarios, providing more reliable quantitative subsurface models. In fact, our inversion result has the lowest error and the highest similarity to the true model than similar approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3095396676,"Groundwater inflow to an underground mine will seriously affect its mining plan and engineering geology safety. Groundwater models are powerful tools commonly used in the mines to develop dewatering strategies. Many mines in the Kolwezi area have been present since the 1950s, and groundwater flow patterns have been significantly influenced by mining activities. A mining plan is developed for an underground mine with overturned syncline strata in Kolwezi, Congo. Previous groundwater models using layered homogeneous media lowered model accuracies. A new three-dimensional groundwater model using FEFLOW, consisting of a combined regionally and locally geology models integrating 16 hydrogeological cross-sections and borehole logging data, are formulated to predict the underground dewatering in the study area. A 31-days pumping tests with 3 pumping wells and 28 observation wells are carried out to estimate the hydrogeological properties. The simulated water level data match the observed data rather well. Under 8 scenarios of possible well designs, the model predicts a possible dewatering capacity greater 23,900 m3/d at the initial stage of mining. The concept of the model and its application can be a reference for other mines with complex geology for mining safety in the region of interest."
https://openalex.org/W3096531252,"Introduction Diabetes mellitus is a complex disease that affects many organ systems, leading to concerns about deteriorating population health status and ever-increasing healthcare expenditure. Many people with diabetes do not achieve optimal glycaemic control and other metabolic indices, leading to a heightened risk of developing complications. Adequate knowledge of diabetes complications is a prerequisite for risk-factor reduction and prevention of the consequences of the disease. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the knowledge of chronic complications of diabetes among persons living with type 2 diabetes mellitus in northern Ghana. Method A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 320 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in northern Ghana. The consecutive sampling technique was employed to recruit participants from September to November 2018. Data analysis was performed using IBM statistical package for social science version 23. Descriptive statistics such as frequencies and percentages were used. Both bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were employed to determine associations between knowledge of diabetes complications and demographic/clinical characteristics of participants, at 95% confidence interval with statistical significance at P<0.05. Results The majority of participants (54.1%) had inadequate knowledge and 45.9% had adequate knowledge of diabetes complications. The factors associated with inadequate level of knowledge were female gender [AOR = 0.29 (95%CI: 0.14–0.56), p<0.001], older age [AOR = 0.45 (95%CI:0.20–0.99), p = 0.049], primary education [AOR = 0.13 (95%CI: 0.03–0.51), p = 0.004], no formal education [AOR = 0.16 (95%CI: 0.05–0.50), p = 0.002], rural dwellers [AOR = 0.50 (95%CI: 0.27–0.95), p = 0.033] and unknown family history diabetes [AOR = 0.38 (95%CI: 0.17–0.82), p = 0.014]. Conclusion More than half of the studied population had inadequate knowledge of diabetes complications. Female gender, rural dwellers, and low education level were factors positively associated with inadequate knowledge of diabetes complications. A multisectoral approach is needed, where the government of Ghana together with other sectors of the economy such as the health, education and local government sectors work collaboratively in the development of locally tailored diabetes education programmes to promote healthy self-care behaviours relevant for the prevention of diabetes and its complications."
https://openalex.org/W3095623762,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system of unclear etiology, but there is some evidence that viral infections could be responsible for triggering autoimmune mechanisms against myelin. We searched for viral RNA and DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 34 MS patients and 13 controls using RT-PCR/PCR against common neurotropic viruses. In addition, shotgun DNA- and RNA-based metagenomics were done in 13 MS patients and 4 controls. Specific quantitative real-time RT-PCR/PCR testing revealed the presence of viral nucleic acid in seven (20.59%) MS patients and in one (7.69%) control patient. In MS patients the most frequently detected was human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6; 3 cases; 8.82%); followed by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV; 2 cases; 5.88%), varicella zoster virus (VZV; 1 case; 2.94%) and Enterovirus (EV; 1 case; 2.94%). The single identified virus among controls was EBV (7.69%). DNA and RNA metagenomic assays did not identify any known eukaryotic viruses even though three of the analyzed samples were low-level positive by specific quantitative real-time PCR. In conclusion, we detected the presence of Herpesviridae and occasionally Enteroviridae in CSF from patients with MS but their prevalence was not significantly higher than among controls. Metagenomic analysis seems to be less sensitive than real-time RT-PCR/PCR and it did not detect any potential viral pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3095964875,"Decentralised gambling applications are a new way for people to gamble online. Decentralised gambling applications are distinguished from traditional online casinos in that players use cryptocurrency as a stake. Also, rather than being stored on a single centralised server, decentralised gambling applications are stored on a cryptocurrency’s blockchain. Previous work in the player behaviour tracking literature has examined the spending profiles of gamblers on traditional online casinos. However, similar work has not taken place in the decentralised gambling domain. The profile of gamblers on decentralised gambling applications are therefore unknown. This paper explores 2,232,741 transactions from 24,234 unique addresses to three such applications operating atop the Ethereum cryptocurrency network over 583 days. We present spending profiles across these applications, providing the first detailed summary of spending behaviours in this technologically advanced domain. We find that the typical player spends approximately $110 equivalent across a median of 6 bets in a single day, although heavily involved bettors spend approximately $100,000 equivalent over a median of 644 bets across 35 days. Our findings suggest that the average decentralised gambling application player spends less than in other online casinos overall, but that the most heavily involved players in this new domain spend substantially more. This study also demonstrates the use of these applications as a research platform, specifically for large scale longitudinal in-vivo data analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3097125722,"The long-term accumulation of biodiversity has been punctuated by remarkable evolutionary transitions that allowed organisms to exploit new ecological opportunities. Mesozoic flying reptiles (the pterosaurs), which dominated the skies for more than 150 million years, were the product of one such transition. The ancestors of pterosaurs were small and probably bipedal early archosaurs1, which were certainly well-adapted to terrestrial locomotion. Pterosaurs diverged from dinosaur ancestors in the Early Triassic epoch (around 245 million years ago); however, the first fossils of pterosaurs are dated to 25 million years later, in the Late Triassic epoch. Therefore, in the absence of proto-pterosaur fossils, it is difficult to study how flight first evolved in this group. Here we describe the evolutionary dynamics of the adaptation of pterosaurs to a new method of locomotion. The earliest known pterosaurs took flight and subsequently appear to have become capable and efficient flyers. However, it seems clear that transitioning between forms of locomotion2,3—from terrestrial to volant—challenged early pterosaurs by imposing a high energetic burden, thus requiring flight to provide some offsetting fitness benefits. Using phylogenetic statistical methods and biophysical models combined with information from the fossil record, we detect an evolutionary signal of natural selection that acted to increase flight efficiency over millions of years. Our results show that there was still considerable room for improvement in terms of efficiency after the appearance of flight. However, in the Azhdarchoidea4, a clade that exhibits gigantism, we test the hypothesis that there was a decreased reliance on flight5–7 and find evidence for reduced selection on flight efficiency in this clade. Our approach offers a blueprint to objectively study functional and energetic changes through geological time at a more nuanced level than has previously been possible. Phylogenetic statistical analyses, biophysical models and information from the fossil record show that an evolutionary signal of natural selection acted to increase the flight efficiency of pterosaurs over millions of years."
https://openalex.org/W3097731134,"In the global context, health and the quality of life of people are adversely affected by either one or more types of chronic diseases. This paper investigates the differences in the level of income and expenditure between chronically-ill people and non-chronic population. Data were gathered from a national level survey conducted namely, the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) of Sri Lanka. These data were statistically analysed with one-way and two-way ANOVA, to identify the factors that cause the differences among different groups. For the first time, this study makes an attempt using survey data, to examine the differences in the level of income and expenditure among chronically-ill people in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the study discovered that married females who do not engage in any type of economic activity (being unemployed due to the disability associated with the respective chronic illness), in the age category of 40–65, having an educational level of tertiary education or below and living in the urban sector have a higher likelihood of suffering from chronic diseases. If workforce population is compelled to lose jobs, it can lead to income insecurity and impair their quality of lives. Under above findings, it is reasonable to assume that most health care expenses are out of pocket. Furthermore, the study infers that chronic illnesses have a statistically proven significant differences towards the income and expenditure level. This has caused due to the interaction of demographic and socio-economic characteristics associated with chronic illnesses. Considering private-public sector partnerships that enable affordable access to health care services for all as well as implementation of commercial insurance and community-based mutual services that help ease burden to the public, are vital when formulating effective policies and strategies related to the healthcare sector. Sri Lanka is making strong efforts to support its healthcare sector and public, which was affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) in early 2020. Therefore, findings of this paper will be useful to gain insights on the differences of chronic illnesses towards the income and expenditure of chronically-ill patients in Sri Lanka."
https://openalex.org/W3094659136,"Changes in data collection and processing of US maternal mortality data across states over time have led to inconsistencies in maternal death reporting. Our purpose was to identify possible misclassification of maternal deaths and to apply alternative coding methods to improve specificity of maternal causes. We analyzed 2016-2017 US vital statistics mortality data with cause-of-death literals (actual words written on the death certificate) added. We developed an alternative coding strategy to code the ""primary cause of death"" defined as the most likely cause that led to death. We recoded deaths with or without literal pregnancy mentions to maternal and non-maternal causes, respectively. Originally coded and recoded data were compared for overall maternal deaths and for a subset of deaths originally coded to ill-defined causes. Among 1691 originally coded maternal deaths, 597 (35.3%) remained a maternal death upon recoding and 1094 (64.7%) were recoded to non-maternal causes. The most common maternal causes were eclampsia and preeclampsia, obstetric embolism, postpartum cardiomyopathy, and obstetric hemorrhage. The most common non-maternal causes were diseases of the circulatory system and cancer, similar to the leading causes of death among all reproductive-age women (excluding injuries). Among 735 records originally coded to ill-defined causes, 94% were recoded to more specific, informative causes from literal text. Eighteen deaths originally coded as non-maternal mentioned pregnancy in the literals and were recoded as maternal deaths. Literal text provides more detailed information on cause of death which is often lost during coding. We found evidence of both underreporting and overreporting of maternal deaths, with possible overreporting predominant. Accurate data is essential for measuring the effectiveness of maternal mortality reduction programs."
https://openalex.org/W3097191186,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global public health problem with high mortality and morbidity. In low-middle income countries (LMIC) a large number of respiratory symptomatic cases that require TB screening per year demands more accurate, fast and affordable testing for TB diagnostics. Sputum smear is the initial screening test in LMICs, however, its sensitivity is limited in patients with low sputum bacilli load. The same limitation is observed in the currently available molecular tests. We designed, standardized and evaluated an electrochemical biosensor that detects the highly specific DNA insertion element 6110 (IS6110). A PCR amplified DNA product is hybridized on the surface of the working electrode built on FTO-Glass with immobilized specific DNA probes, after which cyclic voltammetry is performed with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a platinum counter electrode. The response of the sensor was measured by the ratio (cathodic peak current of the hybridized sensor) / (cathodic peak current of the non-hybridized sensor). We tested the biosensor, using positive hybridization control sequences, genomic DNA extracted from M. tuberculosis strains and sputum of TB patients, and extracted DNA from the urine of healthy controls spiked with M. tuberculosis DNA. This biosensor was effective for the detection of M. tuberculosis DNA with a detection limit of 16 fM in sputum sample and 1 fM in spiked urine samples. The low cost and the relatively brief duration of the assay make this an important TB screening tool in the fight against tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W3097750071,"This study aims to investigate the changes in metamorphopsia after administering the treat-and-extend regimen of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy for branch retinal vein occlusion-associated macular edema. We retrospectively examined 27 patients (27 eyes) with macula edema due to branch retinal vein occlusion who received intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents using the treat-and-extend regimen for ≥18 months. We evaluated best-corrected visual acuity, central macular thickness, macular edema recurrence, and amount of metamorphopsia quantified by M-CHARTS. The best-corrected visual acuity (logarithm of minimum angle of resolution) and central macular thickness significantly improved at 18 months compared to baseline, the median value (interquartile range [IQR]), 0.30 (0.15–0.52) and 459 (373–542) μm at baseline, and 0 (-0.08–0.16) and 267 (232–306) μm at 18 months. The M-CHARTS score (the mean of vertical and horizontal scores) significantly decreased at 1, 6, and 12 months compared to baseline, but worsened at 18 month, the median value (IQR), 0.45 (0.250–0.925), 0.4 (0.15–0.70), 0.4 (0.150–0.625), 0.4 (0.225–0.550) and 0.45 (0.225–0.750) at baseline, 1 month, 6 months, 12 months and 18 months, respectively. The median cumulative number of macular edema recurrences was 2 (IQR, 0.5–3.0) at 18 months. Simple linear regression and multivariate analyses revealed that the change in the mean M-CHARTS score at 18 months was significantly correlated with the baseline score and the cumulative number of macular edema recurrences. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy using the treat-and-extend regimen improved metamorphopsia in branch retinal vein occlusion-related macular edema in the short to mid-term follow-up period, but not in the long term.

https://openalex.org/W3097947411,"Background Screening with cardiac non-invasive stress studies (NISS) prior to listing for kidney transplantation can help in identifying treatable coronary disease and is considered an integral part of pre-kidney transplant evaluation. However, few studies assessed their effectiveness in all patients evaluated for transplantation in clinical practice. To evaluate the role of NISS in pre-kidney transplant evaluation we analyzed their impact prior to waitlisting in 1053 adult CKD-5 patients consecutively evaluated in Greater Manchester, UK during a 6-year period. Methods 918 waitlisted patients were grouped based on presence or absence of Diabetes or Cardio-Vascular Disease (CVD): Group-1 (255 DM-/CVD-/NISS-), Group-2 (368 DM-/CVD-/NISS+) and Group-3 (295 with DM or CVD). Results Group-2 patients had longer ‘time-to-listing’ (5.5months in Group-1 vs 6.9months in ‘Normal-NISS’ vs 9.9months in ‘Abnormal-NISS’, p<0.01) but none with ‘Abnormal-NISS’ needed coronary revascularization before listing. NISS was followed by revascularization in 8 Group-3 patients (3%). In multi-variate analyses, there was no association of NISS on death or MACE in listed patients. During follow up, Transplantation was the most significant factor associated with improved outcomes in all subgroups (HR:0.97, p<0.001). 135 patients were considered unsuitable for waitlisting, with NISS influencing management in 11 of these patients (8%). Conclusions Pre-kidney transplant evaluation with NISS influenced clinical management in 19 of 1053 (2%) patients. Screening with NISS added limited benefit but contributes to significant delays in listing and adding resource implications. Further studies are needed to assess clinical and cost effectiveness of NISS in pretransplant evaluation to optimize outcomes and resources."
https://openalex.org/W3095092878,"Background The promotion strategies of pharmaceutical companies create many problems including irrational prescribing, diminished trust in the patient-physician relationship and unnecessary increases in pharmaceutical costs. Educating prescribers is known to be one of the few potentially effective measures to counteract those impacts. However such educational programs are limited in the literature, and their effectiveness against the effects of hidden curriculum in the long term is unknown. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an education program both in the short term and the long term after the students have been exposed to informal and hidden curriculum and various pharmaceutical promotion methods. Methods A longitudinal and controlled study was carried out in a school of medicine in Turkey where there are no restrictive policies for pharmaceutical promotion. A survey was applied to 123 students who attended the class throughout the terms of 2011–12, 2012–13, and 2013–14, evaluating the pre-educational status of students’ opinions of promotion and any post-educational changes. A follow-up study four years later asked those three cohorts to fill out the same survey to see the possible effects of the clinical environment and various promotion methods. Also, the opinions of all 518 sixth-year students who had not taken the class in those three terms were compared to the educated students. Results The program was significantly effective in the short term in changing students’ opinions and attitudes positively towards recognizing companies’ discourse and promotion strategies. But in the long term, the education lost its ability to convince students of the importance of not getting financial support for scientific activities from pharmaceutical companies (p:0.006) and carrying out research (p<0.001). In addition, although the educated students were more aware that trivial gifts could influence prescriptions compared to the uneducated 6th year students (p<0.001), the difference between them and the uneducated students generally becomes less significant when they encounter the clinical environment. The study also evaluated students highly-exposed to promotion; for this sub-group, the educated students kept their consciousness level about the influences of trivial gifts (p<0.001) while the uneducated students were confident that they were immune to the influence of trivial gifts. Conclusions The education program could be used for creating awareness of, increasing skepticism towards, and inculcating disapproval about pharmaceutical promotion practices. However, the effectiveness of the educational intervention is susceptible to erosion after exposure to the informal and hidden curriculum together with exposure to promotion. The impact of role-models, organizational culture, and institutional policies could be important aspects to be addressed for sustaining the effectiveness of such education programs."

Measurements with QuickSee (QS) were taken in 62 of these patients without cycloplegia (NC), and in 61 under cycloplegia (C). Differences in refraction values (AR vs SR vs QS) as well as the visual acuity (VA) achieved by the patients with each method (QS vs SR) were used to evaluate the performance of the device in measuring refractive error.The spherical equivalent refraction obtained by QS agreed within 0.5 D of the SR in 71% (NC) and 70% (C) of the cases. Agreement between the desktop autorefractor and SR for the same threshold was of 61% (NC) and 77% (C). VA resulting from QS refractions was equal to or better than that achieved by SR procedure in 77% (NC) and 74% (C) of the patients. Average improvement in VA with the QS refractions was of 8.6 and 13.4 optotypes for the NC and C groups respectively, while the SR procedure provided average improvements of 8.9 (NC) and 14.8 (C) optotypes.The high level of agreement between QuickSee and subjective refraction together with the VA improvement achieved in both study groups using QuickSee refractions suggest that the device is a useful autorefraction tool for school-age children."
https://openalex.org/W3096651610,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a vital role in cell division and survival signaling pathways. EGFR is activated in nearly every cancer type, and its high expression in tumors is correlated with poor patient outcome. Altogether, EGFR is a prime candidate as a therapeutic target. While targeted EGFR therapy is initially effective in 75% of patients, a majority of patients relapse within the first year due to poorly understood mechanisms of resistance. p120-catenin (p120ctn) has recently been implicated as a biomarker for EGFR therapy. In previous studies, we demonstrated that p120ctn is a tumor suppressor and its loss is capable of inducing cancer. Furthermore, p120ctn down-regulation synergizes with EGFR overexpression to cause a highly invasive cell phenotype. The purpose of this present study was to investigate whether p120ctn down-regulation induced EGFR therapeutic resistance. Using human esophageal keratinocytes, we have found that EGFR-targeting compounds are toxic to cells overexpressing EGFR. Interestingly, these therapies do not cause toxicity in cells with EGFR overexpression and decreased p120ctn expression. These data suggest that decreased p120ctn causes resistance to EGFR therapy. We believe these findings are of utmost importance, as there is an unmet need to discover mechanisms of EGFR resistance."

Minimally invasive catheterization procedures in pigs have been already developed using Seldinger technique but reproducibility is low, especially in young pigs. A novel method for a minimally invasive catheterization of external jugular vein was evaluated in suckling piglets of 21 days of age. Growth performance and haptoglobin concentration in plasma were measured throughout a four-week study in a group of seven catheterized piglets and a group of seven non-catheterized piglets. Catheterization was performed using Seldinger technique under continuous ultrasound monitoring for vein detection and needle insertion. The surgical procedure was quick and showed a great reproducibility. All catheters remained functional during the first week after catheterization. Catheterization in piglets did not significantly affect body weight (BW) and feed intake during four weeks after the surgical intervention compared to non-catheterized piglets (P > 0.10). Haptoglobin concentration in plasma was greater in catheterized piglets compared with non-catheterized piglets, with a significant increase over two weeks after catheter insertion (P < 0.05), suggesting the development of a chronic inflammation in catheterized piglets. This method can be easily performed in piglets with minimal effect on growth and feeding behaviour. Transposition to heavier pigs should be considered."

The physical properties of the fabrics were quantitatively evaluated by a Fabric Touch Tester (FTT). Subjects were invited to rate the sensory perception of the fabric samples via a subjective questionnaire and objective EEG recording. Significant differences in the EEG relative spectral power of Theta and Gamma bands were acquired in response to the different fabric stimuli (P<0.05). The Theta and Gamma powers demonstrated a significant correlation with the most of the subjective sensations evaluated by questionnaire and the fabrics’ physical properties by FTT (P<0.05). The EEG spectral analysis could feasibly be used for the discrimination of fabric stimuli with different textile compositions and further indicates sensory perceptions during fabric stimulation. This finding may provide evidence for further exploratory research of sensory perceptions via EEG spectral analysis, which could be applied to the study of brain generators of skin tactility in future prostheses and the automatic detection of sensory perception in industries."

The annexation, which resulted in a political crisis in Russian-Ukrainian relations, is a setting which allows us to test if a bilateral political issue caused employee discrimination. We use a quasi-experimental approach to examine how the political crisis influenced participation in major sports leagues in Russia and Ukraine. The results show that the employment conditions significantly worsened since the Crimea crisis started."
https://openalex.org/W3094699913,"There currently is no field test available for measuring maximal exercise capacity in people with stroke.To determine the feasibility, reproducibility and validity of the Shuttle Test (ST) to measure exercise capacity in people with stroke.Longitudinal study design.Rehabilitation department, day care centres from a nursing home and private practices specialized in neuro rehabilitation.People with subacute or chronic stroke.A standardized protocol was used to determine feasibility, reproducibility and validity of the 10-meter Shuttle Test (10mST).Number of shuttles completed, 1stVentilatory Threshold (1stVT).The associations of the number of shuttles completed and cardiopulmonary capacity as measured with a portable gas analyser were r > 0.7, confirming good convergent validity in subacute and chronic people with stroke. Criterion validity, however, indicates it is not a valid test for measuring maximal cardiopulmonary capacity (VO2max). Only 60% of participants were able to reach the 1stVT. Higher cardiopulmonary capacity and a higher total score of the lower extremity Motricity Index contributed significantly to a higher number of shuttles walked (p = 0.001).The Shuttle Test may be a safe and useful exercise test for people after stroke, but may not be appropriate for use with people who walk slower than 2 km/h or 0.56 m/s."
