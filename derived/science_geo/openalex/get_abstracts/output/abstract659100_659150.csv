https://openalex.org/W3083012311,"In this study, we characterized, identified, and determined the effect of salt-tolerant PGPR isolated from coastal saline areas on rice growth and yield. A total of 44 bacterial strains were isolated, and 5 were found to be tolerant at high salt concentration. These isolates were further characterized for salinity tolerance and beneficial traits through a series of quantitative tests. Biochemical characterization showed that bacterial survivability decreases gradually with the increase of salt concentration. One of the strains, UPMRB9, produced the highest amount of exopolysaccharides when exposed to 1.5M of NaCl. Moreover, UPMRB9 absorbed the highest amount of sodium from the 1.5M of NaCl-amended media. The highest floc yield and biofilm were produced by UPMRE6 and UPMRB9 respectively, at 1M of NaCl concentration. The SEM observation confirmed the EPS production of UPMRB9 and UPMRE6 at 1.5M of NaCl concentration. These two isolates were identified as Bacillus tequilensis and Bacillus aryabhattai based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence. The functional group characterization of EPS showed the presence of hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amino groups. This corresponded to the presence of carbohydrates and proteins in the EPS and glucose was identified as the major type of carbohydrate. The functional groups of EPS can help to bind and chelate Na+ in the soil and thereby reduces the plant’s exposure to the ion under saline conditions. The plant inoculation study revealed significant beneficial effects of bacterial inoculation on photosynthesis, transpiration, and stomatal conductance of the plant which leads to a higher yield. The Bacillus tequilensis and Bacillus aryabhattai strains showed good potential as PGPR for salinity mitigation practice for coastal rice cultivation."

In this work, mathematical models are used to reproduce data of the early evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak in Germany, taking into account the effect of actual and hypothetical non-pharmaceutical interventions. Systems of differential equations of SEIR type are extended to account for undetected infections, stages of infection, and age groups. The models are calibrated on data until April 5. Data from April 6 to 14 are used for model validation. We simulate different possible strategies for the mitigation of the current outbreak, slowing down the spread of the virus and thus reducing the peak in daily diagnosed cases, the demand for hospitalization or intensive care units admissions, and eventually the number of fatalities. Our results suggest that a partial (and gradual) lifting of introduced control measures could soon be possible if accompanied by further increased testing activity, strict isolation of detected cases, and reduced contact to risk groups."
https://openalex.org/W3083535211,"Purpose This study sought to assess the performance of the Fitbit Charge HR, a consumer-level multi-sensor activity tracker, to measure physical activity and sleep in children. Methods 59 healthy boys and girls aged 9–11 years old wore a Fitbit Charge HR, and accuracy of physical activity measures were evaluated relative to research-grade measures taken during a combination of 14 standardized laboratory- and field-based assessments of sitting, stationary cycling, treadmill walking or jogging, stair walking, outdoor walking, and agility drills. Accuracy of sleep measures were evaluated relative to polysomnography (PSG) in 26 boys and girls during an at-home unattended PSG overnight recording. The primary analyses included assessment of the agreement (biases) between measures using the Bland-Altman method, and epoch-by-epoch (EBE) analyses on a minute-by-minute basis. Results Fitbit Charge HR underestimated steps (~11.8 steps per minute), heart rate (~3.58 bpm), and metabolic equivalents (~0.55 METs per minute) and overestimated energy expenditure (~0.34 kcal per minute) relative to research-grade measures (p< 0.05). The device showed an overall accuracy of 84.8% for classifying moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary and light physical activity (SLPA) (sensitivity MVPA: 85.4%; specificity SLPA: 83.1%). Mean estimates of bias for measuring total sleep time, wake after sleep onset, and heart rate during sleep were 14 min, 9 min, and 1.06 bpm, respectively, with 95.8% sensitivity in classifying sleep and 56.3% specificity in classifying wake epochs. Conclusions Fitbit Charge HR had adequate sensitivity in classifying moderate and vigorous intensity physical activity and sleep, but had limitations in detecting wake, and was more accurate in detecting heart rate during sleep than during exercise, in healthy children. Further research is needed to understand potential challenges and limitations of these consumer devices."

A wide range of acquired resistance and virulence markers indicate surviving strategy of P. aeruginosa. Complete-genome analysis has been identified as efficient approach towards understanding the pathogenicity of this organism. This study was designed to sequence the entire genome of P. aeruginosa UY1PSABAL and UY1PSABAL2; determine drug-resistance profiles and virulence factors of the isolates; assess factors that contribute toward stability of the genomes; and thereafter determine evolutionary relationships between the strains and other isolates from similar sources. The genomes of the MDR P. aeruginosa UY1PSABAL and UY1PSABAL2 were sequenced on the Illumina Miseq platform. The raw sequenced reads were assessed for quality using FastQC v.0.11.5 and filtered for low quality reads and adapter regions using Trimmomatic v.0.36. The de novo genome assembly was made with SPAdes v.3.13 and annotated using Prokka v.2.1.1 annotation pipeline; Rapid Annotation using Subsytems Technology (RAST) server v.2.0; and PATRIC annotation tool v.3.6.2. Antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence determinants were searched through the functional annotation data generated from Prokka, RAST and PATRIC annotation pipelines; In addition to ResFinder and Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) which were employed to determine resistance genes. The PHAge Search Tool Enhanced Release (PHASTER) web server was used for the rapid identification and annotation of prophage sequences within bacterial genome. Predictive secondary metabolites were identified with AntiSMASH v.5.0. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and cas genes regions were also investigated with the CRISPRone and CRISPRFinder server. The genome sizes of 7.0 and 6.4 Mb were determined for UY1PSABAL and UY1PSABAL2 strains with G+C contents of 66.1% and 66.48% respectively. β-lactamines resistance genes blaPAO, aminoglycoside phosphorylating enzymes genes aph(3’)-IIb, fosfomycine resistance gene fosA, vancomycin vanW and tetracycline tetA were among identified resistance genes harboured in both isolates. UY1PSABAL bore additional aph(6)-Id, aph(3'')-Ib, ciprofloxacin-modifying enzyme crpP and ribosomal methylation enzyme rmtB. Both isolates were found harbouring virulence markers such as flagella and type IV pili; and also present various type III secretion systems such as exoA, exoS, exoU, exoT. Secondary metabolites such as pyochelin and pyoverdine with iron uptake activity were found within the genomes as well as quorum-sensing systems, and various fragments for prophages and insertion sequences. Only the UY1PSABAL2 contains CRISPR-Cas system. The phylogeny revealed a very close evolutionary relationship between UY1PSABAL and the similar strain isolated from Malaysia; the same trend was observed between UY1PSABAL2 and the strain from Chinese origin. Complete analyses of the entire genomes provide a wide range of information towards understanding pathogenicity of the pathogens in question."
https://openalex.org/W3083302470,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs), are important for intercellular communication in both physiological and pathological processes. To explore the potential of cancer derived EVs as disease biomarkers for diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment decision, it is necessary to thoroughly characterize their biomolecular content. The aim of the study was to characterize and compare the protein content of EVs derived from three different cancer cell lines in search of a specific molecular signature, with emphasis on proteins related to the carcinogenic process. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and melanoma brain metastasis cell lines were cultured in CELLine AD1000 flasks. EVs were isolated by ultrafiltration and size-exclusion chromatography and characterized. Next, the isolated EVs underwent liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis for protein identification. Functional enrichment analysis was performed for a more general overview of the biological processes involved. More than 600 different proteins were identified in EVs from each particular cell line. Here, 14%, 10%, and 24% of the identified proteins were unique in OSCC, PDAC, and melanoma vesicles, respectively. A specific protein profile was discovered for each cell line, e.g., EGFR in OSCC, Muc5AC in PDAC, and FN1 in melanoma vesicles. Nevertheless, 25% of all the identified proteins were common to all cell lines. Functional enrichment analysis linked the proteins in each data set to biological processes such as ""biological adhesion"", ""cell motility"", and ""cellular component biogenesis"". EV proteomics discovered cancer-specific protein profiles, with proteins involved in processes promoting tumor progression. In addition, the biological processes associated to the melanoma-derived EVs were distinct from the ones linked to the EVs isolated from OSCC and PDAC. The malignancy specific biomolecular cues in EVs may have potential applications as diagnostic biomarkers and in therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3083184539,"Supervised classification methods often assume the train and test data distributions are the same and that all classes in the test set are present in the training set. However, deployed classifiers often require the ability to recognize inputs from outside the training set as unknowns. This problem has been studied under multiple paradigms including out-of-distribution detection and open set recognition. For convolutional neural networks, there have been two major approaches: 1) inference methods to separate knowns from unknowns and 2) feature space regularization strategies to improve model robustness to novel inputs. Up to this point, there has been little attention to exploring the relationship between the two approaches and directly comparing performance on large-scale datasets that have more than a few dozen categories. Using the ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 large-scale classification dataset, we identify novel combinations of regularization and specialized inference methods that perform best across multiple open set classification problems of increasing difficulty level. We find that input perturbation and temperature scaling yield significantly better performance on large-scale datasets than other inference methods tested, regardless of the feature space regularization strategy. Conversely, we find that improving performance with advanced regularization schemes during training yields better performance when baseline inference techniques are used; however, when advanced inference methods are used to detect open set classes, the utility of these combersome training paradigms is less evident."
https://openalex.org/W3083548084,"With the widespread use of biometric authentication comes the exploitation of presentation attacks, possibly undermining the effectiveness of these technologies in real-world setups. One example takes place when an impostor, aiming at unlocking someone else's smartphone, deceives the built-in face recognition system by presenting a printed image of the user. In this work, we study the problem of automatically detecting presentation attacks against face authentication methods, considering the use-case of fast device unlocking and hardware constraints of mobile devices. To enrich the understanding of how a purely software-based method can be used to tackle the problem, we present a solely data-driven approach trained with multi-resolution patches and a multi-objective loss function crafted specifically to the problem. We provide a careful analysis that considers several user-disjoint and cross-factor protocols, highlighting some of the problems with current datasets and approaches. Such analysis, besides demonstrating the competitive results yielded by the proposed method, provides a better conceptual understanding of the problem. To further enhance efficacy and discriminability, we propose a method that leverages the available gallery of user data in the device and adapts the method decision-making process to the user's and the device's own characteristics. Finally, we introduce a new presentation-attack dataset tailored to the mobile-device setup, with real-world variations in lighting, including outdoors and low-light sessions, in contrast to existing public datasets."
https://openalex.org/W3083650480,"Background Congenital heart disease accounts for almost a third of all major congenital anomalies. Congenital heart defects have a significant impact on morbidity, mortality and health costs for children and adults. Research regarding the risk of pre-surgical mortality is scarce. Objectives Our goal is to generate a predictive model calculator adapted to the regional reality focused on individual mortality prediction among patients with congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods Two thousand two hundred forty CHD consecutive patients’ data from InCor’s heart surgery program was used to develop and validate the preoperative risk-of-death prediction model of congenital patients undergoing heart surgery. There were six artificial intelligence models most cited in medical references used in this study: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB), Ada Boost Classification (ABC) and Bag Decision Trees (BDT). Results The top performing areas under the curve were achieved using Random Forest (0.902). Most influential predictors included previous admission to ICU, diagnostic group, patient's height, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, body mass, arterial oxygen saturation, and pulmonary atresia. These combined predictor variables represent 67.8% of importance for the risk of mortality in the Random Forest algorithm. Conclusions The representativeness of “hospital death” is greater in patients up to 66 cm in height and body mass index below 13.0 for InCor’s patients. The proportion of “hospital death” declines with the increased arterial oxygen saturation index. Patients with prior hospitalization before surgery had higher “hospital death” rates than who did not required such intervention. The diagnoses groups having the higher fatal outcomes probability are aligned with the international literature. A web application is presented where researchers and providers can calculate predicted mortality based on the CgntSCORE on any web browser or smartphone."
https://openalex.org/W3082902747,"The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is proposed to be critical to economic decision making. Yet one can inactivate OFC without affecting well-practiced choices. One possible explanation of this lack of effect is that well-practiced decisions are codified into habits or configural-based policies not normally thought to require OFC. Here, we tested this idea by training rats to choose between different pellet pairs across a set of standard offers and then inactivating OFC subregions during choices between novel offers of previously experienced pairs or between novel pairs of previously experienced pellets. Contrary to expectations, controls performed as well on novel as experienced offers yet had difficulty initially estimating their subjective preference on novel pairs, difficulty exacerbated by lateral OFC inactivation. This pattern of results indicates that established economic choice reflects the use of an underlying model or goods space and that lateral OFC is only required for normal behavior when the established framework must incorporate new information."
https://openalex.org/W3083662579,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical condition associated with diverse etiologies and abrupt loss of renal function. In patients with sepsis, rhabdomyolysis, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders, the underlying disease or associated therapeutic interventions can cause hypoxia, cytotoxicity, and inflammatory insults to renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs), resulting in the onset of AKI. To uncover stress-responsive disease-modifying genes, here we have carried out renal transcriptome profiling in three distinct murine models of AKI. We find that Vgf nerve growth factor inducible gene up-regulation is a common transcriptional stress response in RTECs to ischemia-, cisplatin-, and rhabdomyolysis-associated renal injury. The Vgf gene encodes a secretory peptide precursor protein that has critical neuroendocrine functions; however, its role in the kidneys remains unknown. Our functional studies show that RTEC-specific Vgf gene ablation exacerbates ischemia-, cisplatin-, and rhabdomyolysis-associated AKI in vivo and cisplatin-induced RTEC cell death in vitro. Importantly, aggravation of cisplatin-induced renal injury caused by Vgf gene ablation is partly reversed by TLQP-21, a Vgf-derived peptide. Finally, in vitro and in vivo mechanistic studies showed that injury-induced Vgf up-regulation in RTECs is driven by the transcriptional regulator Sox9. These findings reveal a crucial downstream target of the Sox9-directed transcriptional program and identify Vgf as a stress-responsive protective gene in kidney tubular epithelial cells.

As a result, the pathophysiology of AKI is generally complex because of the existence of multiple etiologies such as the presence of sepsis, ischemia, and therapy-induced nephrotoxicity (6Bonventre J.V.

Disorders such as sepsis, cancer, and rhabdomyolysis and therapeutic interventions such as cardiac surgery and chemotherapy are associated with inflammatory, toxic, and hypoxic insults to renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs).

To identify common stress-responsive genes, we have carried out genome-wide transcriptome analysis in three mouse models of AKI. Our studies identify the nerve growth factor–inducible gene Vgf (nonacronymic; unrelated to VEGF) as a stress-responsive gene that is up-regulated during ischemic, nephrotoxic, and rhabdomyolysis-associated kidney injury. Vgf was originally identified as a nerve growth factor–inducible gene in a neuroendocrine cell line and is expressed in specific neurons and endocrine cells in the brain and the periphery (18Salton S.R.

Interestingly, the role of Vgf in kidney physiology and pathophysiology remains unknown. Here, using transcriptome profiling and RTEC-specific gene ablation studies, we report that Vgf is a stress-inducible gene that plays a protective role during the development of AKI. To identify common stress-induced cellular transcriptome changes linked to the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury, we sought to perform bulk RNA-seq of renal tissues from distinct murine models of AKI. To this end, we utilized the well-characterized mouse models of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), drug-induced nephrotoxicity (cisplatin), and rhabdomyolysis-mediated kidney injury. IRI-associated AKI results from a generalized or localized impairment of oxygen and nutrient delivery to the kidneys (6Bonventre J.V. Yang L.

Rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury.N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 361 (19571284): 62-7210.1056/NEJMra0801327Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). In these mouse models, bilateral ischemic surgery, intraperitoneal cisplatin injection, and intramuscular glycerol injection trigger AKI within 24–72 h. The development and progression of AKI was determined by accumulation of nitrogenous waste (blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine) and histological analysis of tissue damage (H&E staining and renal damage score). During ischemia- (Fig. 1, A–C) and rhabdomyolysis-associated (Fig. 1, D–F) kidney injury, onset of renal impairment occurs 24 h post-surgery or -injection, whereas in the cisplatin-associated kidney injury models, renal impairment is observed 72 h post-injection (Fig. 1, G–I). Histological analysis revealed similar tubular damage in IRI (24 h), rhabdomyolysis (24 h), and cisplatin (72 h) groups (Fig. 1J). Because of temporal differences in the onset of kidney injury, we chose to compare gene expression signals at time points where the extent of kidney injury is similar in the three groups. To this end, we isolated renal tissues from control- (mock and vehicle, n = 8), IRI- (24 h, n = 4), rhabdomyolysis- (24 h, n = 4), and cisplatin-treated (72 h, n = 4) mice and then performed RNA-seq (4–8 biological replicates). Principal component analysis showed that the biological replicates clustered together across groups, signifying a high degree of similarity (Fig. 2A). Hierarchical clustering (Fig. 2B) revealed both divergent and convergent gene signatures between the control and the three AKI groups. In the three AKI conditions (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 and fold change ≥ 2), we identified a common set of 1501 differentially expressed genes (771 genes were down-regulated and 709 genes were up-regulated) (Fig. 2C). In Supplemental Files 1 and 2, we have provided the complete list and normalized expression levels of all detected and differentially expressed genes. Enrichment of genes related to GSH, nicotinamide, and fatty acid metabolism were observed upon gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis (Supplemental File 3). These pathways have been recently probed for their role in renal dysfunction (25Ralto K.M. Rhee E.P. Parikh S.M. NAD(+) homeostasis in renal health and disease.Nat. Rev.

To identify previously unexplored genes, we initially focused our attention on the top differentially expressed genes in the AKI conditions. The top common up-regulated genes in AKI mice were Fosl1, Krt20, Mmp10, 1700001F09Rik, Sprr2f, Lcn2, Sprr2g, Havcr1, Nptx2, and Vgf (Fig. 2D). On the other hand, the top common down-regulated genes were Ccdc169, Pvalb, Egf, Trdn, Inmt, Col6a6, Wfdc16, Pde6a, Slc7a13, and Gm6300. The molecular functions of some of these differentially expressed genes, including the widely studied injury biomarkers Lcn2 and Havcr1, have been explored previously (27Ichimura T. Bonventre J.V.

We found that similar to Havcr1 and Lcn2 up-regulation, 200–2000-fold induction of Vgf gene expression is observed in the three AKI conditions (Fig. 2, E–G). Immunoblot analysis showed a robust increase in Vgf protein levels early during the development of AKI (Fig. S1). These results indicated that Vgf is transcriptionally up-regulated in response to wide-ranging forms of renal injury. Vgf (nonacronymic) was first identified as a nerve growth factor–induced gene in a neuroendocrine cell line (18Salton S.R. Ferri G.L. Hahm S. Snyder S.E. Wilson A.J. Possenti R. Levi A. VGF: a novel role for this neuronal and neuroendocrine polypeptide in the regulation of energy balance.Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2000; 21 (10882540): 199-21910.1006/frne.2000.0199Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The Vgf gene encodes a highly conserved precursor polypeptide of 615 (human) and 617 (rat and mice) amino acids. The precursor polypeptide contains several cleavage sites, and protease action at these locations results in the generation of a number of peptides, which exert pleotropic biological activities (19Lewis J.E. Brameld J.M. Jethwa P.H. Neuroendocrine role for VGF.Front. Endocrinol. 2015; 6 (25699015): 310.3389/fendo.2015.00003Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), including promotion of pro-survival signaling in an autocrine and paracrine fashion (29Takeuchi H.

Although Vgf plays critical roles in neuronal and endocrine tissues, its role in the kidneys remains unknown. We initially sought to validate the RNA-seq data and investigate the cellular origin of Vgf mRNA up-regulation. To do so, we used reporter mice (31Kim J.Y. Bai Y. Jayne L.A. Hector R.D. Persaud A.K. Ong S.S. Rojesh S. Raj R. Feng M. Chung S. Cianciolo R.E. Christman J.W. Campbell M.J. Gardner D.S.

Commun. 2020; 11 (32317630): 192410.1038/s41467-020-15638-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) that expressed membrane-localized GFP in the tubular epithelial cells (Fig. 3A). These mice were challenged with ischemia, cisplatin, and rhabdomyolysis (Fig. S2), followed by isolation of GFP-positive cells from the kidneys and subsequent examination of Vgf gene expression. We found that Vgf mRNA up-regulation occurs in RTECs (GFP-positive cells) early during the development of AKI (Fig. 3, B–D). A similar increase in Vgf expression was observed when human and murine RTEC cell lines (HK-2 and BUMPT cells) and primary murine RTECs were challenged with cisplatin under in vitro conditions (Fig. 3E). Based on these results, we concluded that Vgf up-regulation in RTECs is a common response to stress in vitro and in vivo. To probe the functional role of Vgf in the pathogenesis of AKI, we examined the effect of Vgf gene ablation on the severity of AKI. To this end, we generated Vgf conditional knockout (VgfPT−/−) mice by crossing the Vgf-floxed mice with the Ggt1-Cre mice. In Ggt1-Cre mice, Cre recombinase is expressed in RTECs 7–10 days after birth, and as a result Cre-mediated gene ablation is unlikely to influence normal renal development (32Iwano M. Plieth D. Danoff T.M. Xue C. Okada H. Neilson E.G. Evidence that fibroblasts derive from epithelium during tissue fibrosis.J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110 (12163453): 341-35010.1172/JCI0215518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar). VgfPT−/− mice were indistinguishable from WT littermates and normal renal function was not evidently influenced by Vgf deficiency in RTECs (Fig. S3). Immunoblot and immunofluorescence experiments confirmed Vgf knockout in RTECs (Fig. 4, A–C). However, when the control and VgfPT−/− littermates were challenged with ischemia, cisplatin, and rhabdomyolysis, we observed that Vgf gene deletion markedly exacerbates renal injury (Fig. 4, D–I and Fig. S4). To further corroborate these results, we cultured primary RTECs from the WT and VgfPT−/− mice, challenged them with cisplatin, and then carried out viability assays. Cell survival and caspase assays (Fig. S5) showed that Vgf gene deletion results in increased cisplatin-induced cell death. Thus, we propose that Vgf plays a cytoprotective role in RTECs under stress conditions associated with AKI. Vgf has several pleiotropic functions in neurons and endocrine cells (18Salton S.R. Ferri G.L. Hahm S. Snyder S.E. Wilson A.J. Possenti R. Levi A. VGF: a novel role for this neuronal and neuroendocrine polypeptide in the regulation of energy balance.Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2000; 21 (10882540): 199-21910.1006/frne.2000.0199Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Notably, several Vgf proteolytic peptides have been identified and are named by the first four N-terminal amino acids and their total length (e.g. TLQP-62, TLQP-21, HHPD-41, AQEE-11, and LQEQ-19) (19Lewis J.E. Brameld J.M. Jethwa P.H. Neuroendocrine role for VGF.Front. Endocrinol. 2015; 6 (25699015): 310.3389/fendo.2015.00003Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These peptides can influence various cellular processes, including activation of pro-survival signaling under stress conditions (29Takeuchi H. Inagaki S. Morozumi W. Nakano Y. Inoue Y. Kuse Y.

Some of the biological effects of these Vgf-associated peptides are believed to be mediated through binding to extracellular receptors such as the complement-binding protein gC1qR and complement C3a receptor 1 (C3AR1) (35Hannedouche S.

We found that TLQP-21 levels were increased in the renal tissues of WT mice challenged with ischemia-, cisplatin-, and rhabdomyolysis-associated AKI (Fig. 5A). Additionally, WT primary murine RTECs secreted TLQP-21 in the medium when challenged with cisplatin (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, tissue distribution studies in mice have shown that intravenously injected TLQP-21 markedly accumulates in the kidney (37Guo Z. Sahu B.S. He R. Finan B. Cero C. Verardi R. Razzoli M. Veglia G. Di Marchi R.D. Miles J.M. Bartolomucci A. Clearance kinetics of the VGF-derived neuropeptide TLQP-21.Neuropeptides. 2018; 71 (29958697): 97-10310.1016/j.npep.2018.06.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This prompted us to carry out in vivo “add-back” experiments to determine whether the TLQP-21 administration can reverse the aggravated renal impairment phenotype observed in the VgfPT−/− mice. To this end, we administered a scrambled peptide or TLQP-21 to control and VgfPT−/− mice at 24 and 48 h after challenging them with cisplatin (Fig. 5C). Remarkably, we found that TLQP-21 administration mitigates cisplatin-associated AKI in the VgfPT−/− mice (Fig. 5, D–F), indicating that loss of TLQP-21 might be partly responsible for the increased sensitivity to renal injury. Complementary studies in primary murine RTECs showed that TLQP-21 treatment can protect Vgf-deficient RTECs from cisplatin-induced cell death (Fig. S6). These results indicate that the loss of TLQP-21 is partly responsible for the aggravated renal impairment phenotype seen in the Vgf-deficient mice. Next, we sought to identify the transcriptional mechanisms underlying stress-induced Vgf up-regulation in RTECs. While exploring the transcription factor binding sites in the Vgf promoter, we noticed the presence of a putative Sox9 binding site (Fig. 6A). Sox9 is up-regulated in RTECs in response to injury and is a critical transcriptional regulator of epithelial cell fate during AKI (31Kim J.Y. Bai Y. Jayne L.A. Hector R.D. Persaud A.K. Ong S.S.

https://openalex.org/W3083662883,"Treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) is still a major clinical challenge due to the limited inherent healing capacity of cartilage. Recent studies utilising stem cells suggest that the therapeutic benefits of these cells are mediated through the paracrine mechanism of bioactive molecules. The present study evaluates the regenerative effect of stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) conditioned medium (CM) on OA chondrocytes. The CM was collected after the SHED were cultured in serum-free medium (SFM) for 48 or 72 h and the cells were characterised by the expression of MSC and pluripotency markers. Chondrocytes were stimulated with interleukin-1β and treated with the CM. Subsequently, the expression of aggrecan, collagen type 2 (COL 2), matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) and the level of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers were evaluated. SHED expressed mesenchymal stromal cell surface proteins but were negative for haematopoietic markers. SHED also showed protein expression of NANOG, OCT4 and SOX2 with differential subcellular localisation. Treatment of OA chondrocytes with CM enhanced anti-inflammation compared to control cells treated with SFM. Furthermore, the expression of MMP-13 and NF-kB was significantly downregulated in stimulated chondrocytes incubated in CM. The study also revealed that CM increased the expression of aggrecan and COL 2 in OA chondrocytes compared to SFM control. Both CM regenerate extracellular matrix proteins and mitigate increased MMP-13 expression through inhibition of NF-kB in OA chondrocytes due to the presence of bioactive molecules. The study underscores the potential of CM for OA treatment."

Vaccination of mice with recombinant HSP25 (rHSP25, murine ortholog of human rHSP27) increased AAb levels, attenuated atherogenesis and reduced plaque inflammation and cholesterol content. We sought to determine if the HSP27 immune complex (IC) altered MΦ inflammation signaling (Toll Like Receptor 4; TLR4), and scavenger receptors involved in cholesterol uptake (SR-AI, CD-36). Combining a validated polyclonal IgG anti-HSP27 antibody (PAb) with rHSP27 enhanced binding to THP-1 MΦ cell membranes and activation of NF-κB signaling via TLR4, competing away LPS and effecting an anti-inflammatory cytokine profile. Similarly, adding the PAb with rHSP27 enhanced binding to SR-AI and CD-36, as well as lowered oxLDL binding in HEK293 cells separately transfected with SR-AI and CD-36, or THP-1 MΦ. Finally, the PAb enhanced the uptake and internalization of rHSP27 in THP-1 MΦ. Thus, the HSP27 IC potentiates HSP27 cell membrane signaling with receptors involved in modulating inflammation and cholesterol uptake, as well as HSP27 internalization. Going forward, we are focusing on the development of HSP27 Immune Complex Altered Signaling and Transport (ICAST) as a means of modulating inflammation."

Diet reversal (DiR) mice were fed a HFD for 5 weeks, followed by a ND for 5 or 10 weeks. Corneal sensitivity was determined using aesthesiometry. Corneal cytokine expression was analyzed using a 32-plex Luminex assay. Excised corneas were prepared for immunofluorescence microscopy to evaluate diet-induced changes and wound healing. For wounding studies, mice were fed a HFD or a ND for 10 days prior to receiving a central 2mm corneal abrasion.After 10 days of HFD consumption, corneal sensitivity declined. By 10 weeks, expression of corneal inflammatory mediators increased and nerve density declined. While diet reversal restored nerve density and sensitivity, the corneas remained in a heightened inflammatory state. After 10 days on the HFD, corneal circadian rhythms (limbal neutrophil accumulation, epithelial cell division and Rev-erbα expression) were blunted. Similarly, leukocyte recruitment after wounding was dysregulated and accompanied by delays in wound closure and nerve recovery.In the mouse, obesogenic diet consumption results in corneal dysfunction that precedes the onset of sustained hyperglycemia. Diet reversal only partially ameliorated this dysfunction, suggesting a HFD diet may have a lasting negative impact on corneal health that is resistant to dietary therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3083124482,"Bio-asphalt binders have been proposed as replacements for traditional asphalt binders, owing to advantages such as environmental protection, low costs, and abundant resources. However, a limitation of bio-asphalt binders is that their high-temperature performance is not suitable for pavement construction. In recent years, nano-particles have been widely used to improve the pavement performance of asphalt binders, particularly the high-temperature performance. Thus, the nano-particles might also provide a positive modified effect on the high-temperature performance of bio-asphalt binders. Based on this, five types of nano-particles including SiO2, CaCO3, TiO2, Fe2O3, and ZnO are selected for the preparation of modified bio-asphalt binders, using different dosages of nano-particles and bio-oil. The high- and low-temperature performances, aging resistance, workable performance, and water stability of the nano-modified bio-asphalt binders and mixtures are investigated. The results reveal that, the high-temperature performance and aging resistance of the nano-modified bio-asphalt binders and mixtures are improved at increased nano-particle dosages, whereas their low-temperature performance is slightly weakened. The effects of the nano-particles on the workable performance and water stability are insignificant."
https://openalex.org/W3083178846,"Introduction False-negative malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) results amongst symptomatic malaria patients are detrimental as they could lead to ineffective malaria case management. This study determined the nationwide contribution of parasites with Pfhrp2 and Pfhrp 3 gene deletions to false negative malaria RDT results in Ghana. Methods This was a cross sectional study where whole blood (~2 ml) was collected from patients presenting with malaria symptoms at 100 health facilities in all the regions in Ghana from May to August 2018. An aliquot of the blood was used to prepare thin and thick blood smears, filter paper blood spots (DBS) and spot a PfHRP 2 RDT kit. The remaining blood was separated into plasma and blood cells and stored at -20°C. Plasmodium parasite density and species identity was estimated from the blood smears. Plasmodium falciparum specific 18S rRNA PCR, merozoite surface protein (msp 1) and glutamate rich protein (glurp) gene PCR were used to identify P. falciparum positive samples, which were subjected to Pfhrp 2/3 exon1-2 and exon2 genotyping. Results Of the 2,860 microscopically P. falciparum positive patients analyzed, 134 (4.69%) had false negative P. falciparum specific RDT results. Samples for PCR analysis was available for 127 of the false negative patients, and the analysis identified 116 (91.3%) as positive for P. falciparum. Only 58.1% (79/116) of the false negative RDT samples tested positive by msp 1 and glurp PCR. Genotyping of exon 1–2 and exon 2 of the Pfhrp 2 gene identified 12.9% (10/79) and 39.5% (31/79) of samples respectively to have deletions. Genotyping exon 1–2 and exon 2 of the Pfhrp 3 gene identified 15.2% (12/79) and 40.5% (32/79) of samples respectively to have deletions. Only 5% (4/79) of the false negative samples had deletions in both exon 1–2 and exon 2 of the Pfhrp 2 gene. Out of the 49 samples that tested positive for aldolase by luminex, 32.6% (16/49) and) had deletions in Pfhrp 2 exon 2 and 2% (1/49) had deletions in both exon 2 and exon 1–2 of the Pfhrp 2 gene. Conclusions The low prevalence of false negative RDT test results provides assurance that PfHRP 2 based malaria RDT kits remain effective in diagnosing symptomatic malaria patients across all the Regions of Ghana. Although there was a low prevalence of parasites with deletions in exon 2 and exon 1–2 of the Pfhrp 2 gene the prevalence of parasites with deletions in Pfhrp 2 exon 2 was about a third of the false negative RDT results. The need to ensure rapid, accurate and reliable malaria diagnosis requires continuous surveillance of parasites with Pfhrp 2 gene deletions."
https://openalex.org/W3083198290,"Background Chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP) is one of the post-surgical complications of a Cesarean section. Despite the high rates of Cesarean section worldwide, the incidence of CPSP and the risk factors for this condition remain relatively unknown. The objective of this study was to calculate the incidence of CPSP in women submitted to Cesarean section and to analyze the associated risk factors. Materials and methods A prospective cohort of 621 women undergoing Cesarean section was recruited preoperatively. Potential presurgical (sociodemographic, clinical and lifestyle-related characteristics) and post-surgical risk factors (the presence and intensity of pain) risk factors were analyzed. Pain was measured at 24 hours and 7, 30, 60 and 90 days after surgery. Following discharge from hospital, data were collected by telephone. The outcome measure was self-reported pain three months after a Cesarean section. The risk factors for chronic pain were analyzed using the log-binomial regression model (a generalized linear model). Results A total of 462 women were successfully contacted 90 days following surgery. The incidence of CPSP was 25.5% (95%CI: 21.8–29.7). Risk factors included presurgical anxiety (adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.03; 95%CI: 1.01–1.05), smoking (adjusted RR 2.22; 95%CI: 1.27–3.88) and severe pain in the early postoperative period (adjusted RR 2.79; 95%CI: 1.29–6.00). Conclusion One in four women submitted to Cesarean section may develop CPSP; however, the risk factors identified here are modifiable and preventable.

Statistical prediction methods and machine learning methods have some defects in landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), meanwhile, hybrid methods have been developed by combining the statistical prediction methods with machine learning methods in recent years, and some of them were reported to perform better than conventional methods. In view of this, the principal component analysis (PCA) method was used to extract the susceptibility evaluation indexes of HLDs; the particle swarm optimization-support vector machine (PSO-SVM) model and genetic algorithm-support vector machine (GA-SVM) model were implemented to the susceptibility mapping and zoning of HLDs in China. The research results show that the accumulative contribution rate of the four principal components is 92.050%; evaluation results of the PSO-SVM model are better than those of the GA-SVM model; micro dangerous areas, moderate dangerous areas, severe dangerous areas and extreme dangerous areas account for 24.24%, 19.49%, 36.53% and 19.74% of the total areas of China; among the 1543 disaster points in the HLDs inventory, there are 134, 182, 421 and 806 located in the above areas respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3083216895,"This study was designed to explore the role of local knowledge (LK) in enhancing the resilience of Dinki watershed in the central highlands of Ethiopia. The data were collected through focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and household surveys. The qualitative data were analyzed through thematic analysis. Whereas descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used for quantitative data analyses. The result showed that the majority of the respondents have local knowledge and used in their daily activities. Furthermore, the LK is reported to have the adaptive capacity in managing land resource degradation, treating disease, mitigating food insecurity, and enhancing social capital, among others. Likewise, the logistic regression analysis showed that age, gender, and education status of the household head were significantly correlated (p<0.05) to knowledge level, indicating their predictive power for the acquisition of LK. Accordingly, old-aged (60+ years) male respondents who attended primary education were higher to acquire LK than their counterparts. The result realized that the adaptive roles (land resource management, medication, climate change adaptation, etc.) of local knowledge systems could contribute to enhancing resilience. More importantly, the presence of social mechanisms is insurance to maintain LK. Thus, both intergenerational and intragenerational information gaps are filled with education and promotion on the roles of local knowledge systems. Besides, local-decision options should participate in custodians to share their experiences, that could contribute to sustaining ecosystem resilience."
https://openalex.org/W3083188399,"Spectral Counts approaches (SpCs) are largely employed for the comparison of protein expression profiles in label-free (LF) differential proteomics applications. Similarly, to other comparative methods, also SpCs based approaches require a normalization procedure before Fold Changes (FC) calculation. Here, we propose new Complexity Based Normalization (CBN) methods that introduced a variable adjustment factor (f), related to the complexity of the sample, both in terms of total number of identified proteins (CBN(P)) and as total number of spectral counts (CBN(S)). Both these new methods were compared with the Normalized Spectral Abundance Factor (NSAF) and the Spectral Counts log Ratio (Rsc), by using standard protein mixtures. Finally, to test the robustness and the effectiveness of the CBNs methods, they were employed for the comparative analysis of cortical protein extract from zQ175 mouse brains, model of Huntington Disease (HD), and control animals (raw data available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD017471). LF data were also validated by western blot and MRM based experiments. On standard mixtures, both CBN methods showed an excellent behavior in terms of reproducibility and coefficients of variation (CVs) in comparison to the other SpCs approaches. Overall, the CBN(P) method was demonstrated to be the most reliable and sensitive in detecting small differences in protein amounts when applied to biological samples."
https://openalex.org/W3083660201,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are crucial in many cellular processes, yet relatively few have been shown to regulate human cardiomyocyte differentiation. Here, we demonstrate an essential role of GATA6 antisense RNA 1 (GATA6-AS1) in cardiomyocyte differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). GATA6-AS1 is adjacent to cardiac transcription factor GATA6. We found that GATA6-AS1 was nuclear-localized and transiently upregulated along with GATA6 during the early stage of cardiomyocyte differentiation. The knockdown of GATA6-AS1 did not affect undifferentiated cell pluripotency but inhibited cardiomyocyte differentiation, as indicated by no or few beating cardiomyocytes and reduced expression of cardiomyocyte-specific proteins. Upon cardiac induction, the knockdown of GATA6-AS1 decreased GATA6 expression, altered Wnt-signaling gene expression, and reduced mesoderm development. Further characterization of the intergenic region between genomic regions of GATA6-AS1 and GATA6 indicated that the expression of GATA6-AS1 and GATA6 were regulated by a bidirectional promoter within the intergenic region. Consistently, GATA6-AS1 and GATA6 were co-expressed in several human tissues including the heart, similar to the mirror expression pattern of GATA6-AS1 and GATA6 during cardiomyocyte differentiation. Overall, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized and functional role of lncRNA GATA6-AS1 in controlling human cardiomyocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W3083691870,"Background and objective A recent study identified progranulin as a candidate biomarker for frailty, based on gene expression databases. In the present study, we investigated associations between serum progranulin levels and frailty in a population-based sample of late middle-age and older adults. Methods We utilized a cohort study that included 358 African Americans (baseline ages 49–65). Frailty was assessed by three established methods: the interview-based FRAIL scale, the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) frailty scale that includes performance-based measurements, and the Frailty Index (FI) that is based on cumulative deficits. Serum levels of the following proteins and metabolites were measured: progranulin, cystatin C, fructosamine, soluble cytokine receptors (interleukin-2 and -6, tumor necrosis factor α-1 and -2), and C-reactive protein. Sarcopenia was assessed using the SARC-F index. Vital status was determined by matching through the National Death Index (NDI). Results Serum progranulin levels were associated with frailty for all indices (FRAIL, CHS, and FI) but not with sarcopenia. Inflammatory markers indicated by soluble cytokine receptors (sIL-2R, sIL-6R, sTNFR1, sTNFR2) were positively associated serum progranulin. Increased serum progranulin levels at baseline predicted poorer outcomes including future frailty as measured by the FRAIL scale and 15-year all-cause mortality independent of age, gender, and frailty. Conclusions Our findings suggest that serum progranulin levels may be a candidate biomarker for physical frailty, independent of sarcopenia. Further studies are needed to validate this association and assess the utility of serum progranulin levels as a potential biomarker for prevalent frailty, for risk for developing incident frailty, and for mortality risk over and above the effect of baseline frailty."

https://openalex.org/W3083421015,"Background Globally, the prevalence of HIV among transgender women remains much higher than that of the general population, and a large proportion of them are unaware of their HIV status. Transgender women are exposed to gender-based violence and social stigma and discrimination in different settings that may create significant barriers to receiving HIV prevention and care services. This study aimed to identify factors associated with recent HIV testing among transgender women in Cambodia. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 2016 among 1375 transgender women recruited from 13 provinces using a peer-based social network recruitment method. We used a structured questionnaire for face-to-face interviews and performed rapid HIV/syphilis testing onsite. We used a multiple logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with recent HIV testing. Results Of the total, 49.2% of the participants reported having an HIV test in the past six months. After controlling for other covariates, the odds of having an HIV test in the past six months was significantly lower among students (AOR 0.36, 95% CI 0.20–0.65), participants who perceived that they were unlikely to be HIV infected (AOR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32–0.78), and participants who reported always using condoms with male non-commercial partners in the past three months (AOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.49–0.85) relative to their respective reference group. The odds of having an HIV test in the past six months was significantly higher among participants who had been reached by community-based HIV services (AOR 5.01, 95% CI 3.29–7.65) and received HIV education (AOR 1.65, 95% CI 1.06–2.58) in the past six months relative to their respective reference group. Conclusions Despite the widely available free HIV testing services, more than half of transgender women in this study had not received an HIV test in the past six months. Our findings suggest that a tailored and comprehensive combination prevention program, in which HIV testing is linked to care continuum and beyond, maybe an essential next step. Social media may have the potential to be promoted and utilized among transgender women populations in order to improve HIV testing and other prevention measures."
https://openalex.org/W3083539701,"The purposes of this study were to investigate the influence of the orthodontics-first approach (OFA) and surgery-first approach (SFA) on changes in the signs and symptoms of temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) and to compare pre- and postoperative orthodontic treatment duration and total treatment duration between the two approaches. This retrospective study recruited 182 adult patients with malocclusions treated with OFA and SFA and recorded variables such as age, gender, skeletal classification, and signs and symptoms of TMD (clicking and pain disorders) before the start of the surgical-orthodontic treatment and after surgery. Changes in the signs and symptoms of TMD and treatment duration were evaluated within each approach and compared between two approaches. A binary logistic regression was performed to assess the influence of the variables on the postoperative signs and symptoms of TMD. There were no significant postoperative changes in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain for OFA and SFA, whereas a significant reduction was found in TMJ clicking after surgery for both approaches. According to binary logistic regression, the type of surgical-orthodontic treatment (OFA or SFA) was not a significant risk factor for postoperative TMJ clicking and pain, and the risk of postoperative TMJ clicking and pain was significant only when TMJ clicking (OR = 10.774, p < 0.001) and pain (OR = 26.876, p = 0.008) existed before the start of the entire treatment, respectively. With regard to the treatment duration, SFA (21.1 ± 10.3 months) exhibited significantly shorter total treatment duration than OFA (34.4 ± 11.9 months) (p < 0.001). The results of this study suggest that surgical-orthodontic treatment using SFA can be a feasible option of treatment for dentofacial deformities based on the equivalent effect on TMD and shorter overall treatment period compared to conventional surgical-orthodontic treatment using OFA."

https://openalex.org/W3083126739,"We investigate socio-economic urban scaling behavior of municipalities in Denmark, the Netherlands, and in particular in Germany. Our interest is twofold. First we investigate whether, and to what extent, scaling occurs in various types of urban areas. The second important topic of research concerns the comparison of specific types of urban areas with regard to the values of the gross urban product. This is a new approach: two scaling systems are compared not only in terms of the scaling exponent, but also in terms of the differences in the gross urban product. We are specifically interested in the role of urban governance in terms of local urban government structures. Germany is our central case because it works as a natural experiment: a large number of urban areas is one-governance, but others are not. More specifically, we distinguish between cities of which the surrounding urban area belongs to the municipality of the city (kreisfreie cities), and those specific districts (Kreise) which are urban areas consisting of several municipalities. Our findings suggest that urban areas with one municipality perform better than urban areas with fragmented governance structures. We also investigate the relation between scaling of Kreise and simple measures of centrality, including the Zipf-distribution. A strong relation is found between the measured residuals of the scaling equations and the socio-economic position of cities assessed with a set of different socio-economic indicators. Given the debate on the effectiveness of municipal reform, our results may lead to challenging conclusions about the importance of one-municipality instead of multi-municipality governance in urban areas. These results are relevant for policy as they suggest that there is a benefit to unifying the governance structure of compact urban agglomerations."
https://openalex.org/W3083420986,"As many other wild living species, black grouse Tetrao tetrix has to cope with anthropogenic disturbances in many habitats. Impacts of tourism and outdoor recreation on grouse species Tetraoninae have been subject to several studies in mountainous habitats in Central Europe and the United Kingdom. The geographically isolated and critically endangered black grouse population of Lower Saxony (North Germany) has been consistently monitored but beyond that poorly studied. This also applies to the key habitats of the nature reserve Lüneburg Heath (Lüneburger Heide) which, in turn, serves as a recreational area as well. In this study, the impact of tourism activity on habitat use of black grouse was investigated using data of GPS-tracked individuals. Additionally, visitor numbers on public and (usually undisturbed) closed routes were monitored using infrared light barriers. The spatio-temporal distribution of locations and the recreational activity were evaluated by linear mixed-effects models. Tagged individuals avoided the vicinity of public routes and avoiding distances were directly related to intensity of human activity. There was no seasonal change of black grouse habitat use alongside public routes. However, towards closed routes, significantly higher distances appeared during peak phases of visitor numbers (August and September), implying temporary increased disturbance levels within a key refuge area. Diurnal adaptation of habitat use was strongly dependent on the route density within the home range. Individuals used the vicinity of public trails at night and dawn but evaded these habitats during peak human activity around noon and afternoon. Recreational disturbances appeared to significantly affect the effective habitat availability for black grouse in the nature reserve. Visual cover by vegetation, however, seemed to diminish negative effects emerging from hiking trails. This provides an effective protective measure which requires minimal effort for the local conservation management."
https://openalex.org/W3082998951,"Do efficient communication networks accelerate solution discovery? The most prominent theory of organizational design for collective learning maintains that informationally efficient collaboration networks increase a group’s ability to find innovative solutions to complex problems. We test this idea against a competing theory that argues that communication networks that are less efficient for information transfer will increase the discovery of novel solutions to complex problems. We conducted a series of experimentally designed Data Science Competitions, in which we manipulated the efficiency of the communication networks among distributed groups of data scientists attempting to find better solutions for complex statistical modeling problems. We present findings from 16 independent competitions, where individuals conduct greedy search and only adopt better solutions. We show that groups with inefficient communication networks consistently discovered better solutions. In every experimental trial, groups with inefficient networks outperformed groups with efficient networks, as measured by both the group’s average solution quality and the best solution found by a group member."
https://openalex.org/W3083006907,"Podocytes are highly specialized cells that play an essential role in maintaining the integrity and function of the glomerular filtration barrier. Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) and β-catenin are two master regulators that play opposing roles in podocyte biology and mutually antagonize each other. However, exactly how β-catenin inhibits WT1 remains incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrated the role of miR-466o-3p in mediating β-catenin-triggered podocyte injury by targeting WT1. The expression of miR-466o-3p was upregulated in cultured podocytes after β-catenin activation and in glomerular podocytes in adriamycin (ADR) nephropathy, remnant kidney after 5/6 renal ablation, and diabetic kidney disease. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-466o-3p directly targeted WT1 mRNA. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-466o-3p downregulated WT1 protein and promoted podocyte injury in vitro. Conversely, inhibition of miR-466o-3p alleviated β-catenin-induced podocyte dysfunction. In mouse model of ADR nephropathy, overexpression of miR-466o-3p inhibited WT1, aggravated podocytes injury and deteriorated proteinuria. In contrast, inhibition of renal miR-466o-3p by antagomiR, either prior to or after ADR injection, substantially restored WT1, alleviated podocytes injury and reduced renal fibrosis. These studies reveal a critical role for miR-466o-3p, a novel microRNA that has not been characterized previously, in mediating β-catenin-triggered WT1 inhibition. Our findings also uncover a new pathogenic mechanism by which β-catenin promotes podocyte injury and proteinuria in glomerular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3083079696,"Esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) can be a curative treatment for superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SESCC). However, it is unclear whether the development of metachronous recurrence after ESD may be explained based on several risk factors. This study aimed to assess the incidence and the risk factors of metachronous recurrence of SESCC after ESD. This retrospective analysis was conducted at Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, from April 2007 to May 2018. Two hundred and fifty-three SESCC patients treated with ESD were followed using surveillance endoscopy after the procedure. Risk factors for metachronous esophageal SCC were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox’s proportional hazards model. Metachronous esophageal SCCs were found in 21 (8.3%) of the 253 patients. Six patients (2.4%) with extraesophageal recurrence such as lymph node metastasis confirmed by imaging were excluded from patients with metachronous recurrence and data were censored from the recurrence date. Univariate analysis revealed that the presence of many (>10) irregularly shaped multiform Lugol-voiding lesions (LVLs) around the main lesion, margin of the main LVL, and tumor differentiation were risk factors for the development of metachronous cancer. Multivariate analysis also revealed that many (>10) LVLs (hazard ratio [HR], 6.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.62–24.72; p = 0.047) and unclear or spiculated margin of the main LVL (HR, 6.51; 95% CI, 1.44–29.42; p = 0.029) were associated with the risk of metachronous recurrence. Metachronous esophageal SCC develops in patients treated with ESD for SESCC. A risk assessment is important for surveillance before and after ESD for SESCC. Number of LVLs and tumor edge type are associated with an increased risk of metachronous cancer in SESCC. Patients will benefit from careful endoscopic surveillance when endoscopists pay attention to these tumor characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W3083375541,"Resource-based livelihoods are uncertain and potentially unstable due to variability over time, including seasonal variation: this instability threatens marginalised populations who may fall into poverty. However, empirical understanding of trajectories of household well-being and poverty is limited. Here, we present a new household-level model of poverty dynamics based on agents and coping strategies-the Household Economy And Poverty trajectory (HEAP) model. HEAP is based on established economic and social insights into poverty dynamics, with a demonstration of the model calibrated with a qualitative and quantitative household survey in coastal Bangladesh. Economic activity in Bangladesh is highly dependent on natural resources; poverty is widespread; and there is high variability in ecosystem services at multiple temporal scales. The results show that long-term decreases in poverty are predicated more on the stability of, and returns from, livelihoods rather than their diversification. Access to natural resources and ecosystem service benefits are positively correlated with stable income and multidimensional well-being. Households that remain in poverty are those who experience high seasonality of income and are involved in small scale enterprises. Hence, seasonal variability in income places significant limits on natural resources providing routes out of poverty. Further, projected economic trends to 2030 lead to an increase in well-being and a reduction in poverty for most simulated household types."

We estimated the prevalence and factors associated with oral sex practices and characterized oropharyngeal STIs among a cohort of MSM and TGW in Nigeria. Methods From 2013 to 2018, TRUST/RV368 recruited MSM and TGW into HIV/STI diagnosis and treatment at community-based clinics in Nigeria. Participants who completed HIV testing and oral sex questions at enrollment were selected. Cross-sectional analyses with bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Oropharyngeal swab testing for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) began in 2014 and for those with diagnostic results at enrollment, the unadjusted association of oral sex practices with oropharyngeal STIs was conducted. Results A total of 1342 participants had a median age of 25 years (interquartile range: 22–29), 58% were living with HIV, and 69% reported oral sex practices. Factors associated with increased odds of engaging in oral sex included living with HIV (adjusted [a]OR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1–1.8), self-identifying as a woman (aOR:1.8, 95% CI: 1.1–2.8), mobile phone ownership (aOR:2.3, 95% CI: 1.3–3.9), receptive anal sex (aOR:1.7, 95% CI:1.3–2.3) and multiple male sexual partners (2 to 4 vs. ≤1, aOR:1.5, 95% CI: 1.0–2.2; 5+ vs ≤1, aOR:2.9, 95% CI:1.9–4.3). Oropharyngeal STI prevalence was 7% (52/752) and higher among those who engaged in oral sex compared to those who did not (unadjusted OR: 2.5, 95% CI:1.2–5.3). Conclusions Oral sex was common and associated with an increased odds of oropharyngeal STIs among MSM and TGW from Nigeria. In the absence of screening and treatment guidelines, condoms continue to be the mainstay for oral STI prevention. A pre-exposure prophylaxis for bacterial STIs would complement current prevention strategies to curb transmission."

The transmission of C. oleifera plantation will potentially affect soil C, N, and P pools as well as their stoichiometric characteristics both in top soil layer and vertical soil profile due to the intensive management. To understand changes in vertical pools and stoichiometric characteristics of soil C, N, and P as affected by intensive management of C. oleifera plantations, both mixed and pure C. oleifera plantations were studied. We conducted studies in five locations in Jiangxi, China with both pure and mixed C. oleifera plantations, to compare changes in vertical pools and stoichiometry of C, N, and P. Both C and N pools were significantly different between mixed and pure plantation types of C. oleifera. However, the ratio of C:N, C:P, and N:P was consistently higher in mixed plantations with C:P and N:P altered but C:N ratio did not change with soil depth. The intensive management significantly impact both C and N pools and the stoichiometry of C, N, and P. Intensive management of C. oleifera plantations decreased both C and N pools, especially at the depth of 30–50 cm soil layer. C. oleifera plantation alteration from mixed to pure should be considered in future forest management practice considering the substantial effects on soil element cycling and distribution along vertical soil profile."
https://openalex.org/W3083272662,"Introduction Disrespect and abusive care is a violation of women’s basic human rights and it is serious global problem that needs urgent intervention. Poor quality client-provider interaction is commonly reported from family planning programmes. In Ethiopia, disrespect and abusive care is very common (21–78%) across health facilities. Objective To assess the status of respectful family planning service (client-provider interaction) in Sidama zone, south Ethiopia. Methodology Health facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from June to August 2018. Data were collected from 920 family planning clients recruited from 40 randomly selected health facilities. The Mother on Respect index (MORi) questionnaire was used to collect the data through client exit interview. Partial proportional odds ordinal regression was employed to identify determinants of respectful family planning service. Result Among family planning clients, the level of respectful family planning service was found to be zero (0%) in the very low respect category, 75(18.5%) in the low respect category, 382(41.52%) in moderate respect category and 463(50.33%) in high respect category. Being a short acting method client (AOR = 0.30, 95%CI [0.12, 0.72]), being an uneducated client (AOR = 0.39, 95%CI [0.25, 0.61]) or a client with elementary education (AOR = 0.41, 95%CI [0.23, 0.73]), client’s poverty (AOR = 0.75, 95%CI [0.56, 0.99]), and long waiting time (AOR = 0.46, 95%CI [0.30, 0.69])significantly reduced the odds of moderate and high respect compared to low respect. Conversely, preference of male service providers, service providers’ work satisfaction and health workers’ prior training on respectful care significantly increased the odds of moderate and high respect. Conclusion Considering the current strategy of zero tolerance for disrespect and abuse in Ethiopia, the level of respectful care in this study is sub-optimal. Short term training for service providers on respectful care seems valuable to enhance the level of respectful care for family planning clients irrespective of their socioeconomic background."

This study investigates the association between six-month EBF and the frequency, duration, and form (face-to-face vs. telephone contact) of professional lactation support in a cohort of Lebanese mothers, and explores barriers to EBF during the first six months postpartum.An observational study was nested in a breastfeeding support randomized controlled trial. Secondary analysis of data from 159 trial participants who received professional lactation support was conducted. (1) Six-month EBF with professional lactation support frequency, duration, and form was investigated using bivariate and multivariate regression analyses. (2) Barriers to breastfeeding were explored using content analysis of narrative data collected about breastfeeding mothers by the lactation experts.Six-month EBF was achieved by 57/159 (35.8%) participants. Professional lactation support was received by more mothers continuing six months of EBF (100% vs. 83.3%, p = 0.001). In crude analysis, those mothers had a higher number of overall contacts with lactation experts (mean ± SD of 9.5 ± 2.9 vs. 7.0 ± 4.4, p = 0.001), and longer duration of face-to-face contacts (mean ± SD of 261.9 ± 209.1 vs. 201.0 ± 117.4 minutes, p = 0.035). In adjusted analysis, frequencies of overall and of telephone contacts with the lactation experts were positively associated with six-month EBF (OR = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.27, p = 0.007; OR = 1.12; 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.26, p = 0.05; respectively). Participants discontinuing EBF early were described as inexperienced, lacking breastfeeding knowledge, concerned about milk insufficiency, and showing negative attitudes towards night feeds.Need-based telephone contact augmenting face-to-face professional lactation support may positively influence six-month EBF. Early identification of mothers at risk for early discontinuation of EBF can help tailor interventions specific to their concerns."
https://openalex.org/W3083328698,"The spread of economic shocks in an increasingly interconnected global economy has been subject to several studies recently. These studies mostly focus on the synchronization of business cycles among economies and search for the relationship between trade linkages and shock contagion. In contrast to previous studies in the field, this paper focuses on the topological properties of the shock contagion network as measured by pairwise Granger causality between economic output of countries. This topological approach can bring new insights into the dynamics of contagion and the relationship between trade and cycle synchronization while also allows to test the patterns of shock contagion against randomness. Results show that connectedness decreases over the previous decades until the first decade of the 21st century, showing less frequent shock transmission which shades previous results in the field which typically associate increasing trade and globalization with more frequent or unchanged contagion. We find significant non-random topology with respect to transitivity and path lengths, the skewness of the degree distribution and the stability of connections. Estimations show that there is a systematically existing (persistent) contagion path in 16% of all possible connections. However, we do not find significant geographical or development-wise patterns behind the modularity of the contagion network and no significant association is found between economic openness and exposure to shock transmission in either direction."

The objective of this study was to associate certain clinical markers of maternal adiposity (body mass index and gestational weight gain) and neonatal adiposity (birth weight, abdominal circumference, and waist/height index) with the levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in umbilical cord blood at birth: IL-1β, IL-1Rα, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, and TNF-α. An exploratory cross-sectional study was conducted with a convenience sample of women from one hospital recruited shortly before giving birth through scheduled cesarean section. Of 31 the pregnant women who agreed to participate and met the inclusion criteria, twenty-nine newborns from these women were analyzed. Three cases of tobacco smoking during pregnancy were identified as an unexpected maternal risk factor and were included in the analysis. Typical of the population treated at this hospital, ten of our participants had diabetes during pregnancy, and nine of them had a pre-pregnancy BMI> 25. Non-parametric statistical analyses and a generalized linear model with gamma scale response with a log link were performed. Results: Correlation analyses, differences in medians, and a prediction model all showed positive and significant results between cytokine levels in cord blood and neonatal abdominal circumference, birth weight, and waist-height index. For maternal variables, smoking during pregnancy showed significant associations with cytokine levels in cord blood. Conclusion: This study found a variety of associations suggesting that increased neonatal adiposity increases pro-inflammatory cytokine levels at birth."

Using the previously identified memory B cell markers CD80, PD-L2, and CD73, we found an increase in the frequency of CD80-PD-L2-CD73+ B cells up to 55 days after a primary PyNL infection and at 4-6 days following a second PyNL infection. Moreover, injection of enriched immune CD19+CD73+ B cells into nonimmune mice were significantly more protective against a PyNL infection than CD73- B cells. Interestingly, a substantial fraction of these CD73+ B cells also expressed IgM and granzyme B, a biomolecule that has been increasingly associated with protective responses against malaria."

https://openalex.org/W3083454568,"Goal-directed reaching adapts to meet changing task requirements after unexpected perturbations such as a sudden switch of target location. Literature on adaptive behavior using a target switch has primarily focused on adjustments of the end-effector trajectory, addressing proposed feedback and feedforward processes in planning adjusted actions. Starting from a dynamical systems approach to motor coordination, the current paper focusses on coordination of joint angles after a target switch, which has received little attention in the literature. We argue that joint angles are coordinated in synergies, temporary task-specific units emerging from interactions amongst task, organism, and environmental constraints. We asked whether after a target switch: i) joint angles were coordinated in synergies, ii) joint angles were coordinated in a different synergy than the synergy used when moving to the original target, and iii) synergies or end-effector trajectory was adjusted first. Participants (N = 12) performed manual reaching movements toward a target on a table (stationary target trials), where in some trials the target could unexpectedly switch to a new location (switch trials). Results showed that the end-effector curved to the switched target. Joint angles were synergistically organized as shown by the large extent of co-variation based on Uncontrolled Manifold analyses. At the end of the target switch movement, joint angle configurations differed from the joint angle configurations used to move to the original stationary target. Hence, we argue, a new synergy emerged after the target switch. The order of adjustment in the synergies and in the end-effector was flexible within participants, though most often synergies were adjusted first. These findings support the two-step framework of Kay (1988) to understand the coordination of abundant degrees of freedom and to explain adaptive actions. The flexibility in the order of adjustments of synergies suggests that the coordination of DOF emerges from self-organization."

https://openalex.org/W3083059842,"Women with mental illness have a special need for family planning as they carry a high risk of unplanned pregnancy, sexual violence and, the poor obstetric outcomes due to their mental illness, as well as teratogenicity from exposure to psychotropic medications lower antenatal care utilization.To assess knowledge, and utilization of family planning and associated factors among women attending psychiatric outpatient clinics in Addis Ababa.A cross-sectional study was conducted among 423 women attending the outpatient psychiatric clinics of three general and one specialized mental hospital in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. A structured and pretested questionnaire were administered by psychiatric nurses. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with utilization of family planning methods.Four hundred twenty-two participants who had follow up at the psychiatric outpatient departments participated in the study. Almost 88% of participants had an unintended pregnancy. Only 68% of study participant had ever heard about Family planning. Just over one third (38.6%) reported current use of at least one method of Family planning. Of those not using family planning 73.3% had no intention to have children. And 38.8% did not have any intention to use Family Planning in the future. Fear of drug-interaction with psychiatric medication was the most common reason not to use contraceptives. Having one or two children was associated with higher utilization of family planning [adjusted odds ratio (95%, confidence interval) 2.05 (1.06, 3.99)].In this study, the majority of women with mental illness were not using family planning methods. The Awareness of the Family planning methods is lower than the national average. Education and counselling about family planning for women attending psychiatric outpatient departments should be strengthened."
https://openalex.org/W3083120158,"Factors beyond a person's control, such as demographic characteristics at birth, often influence the availability of rewards an individual can expect for their efforts. We know surprisingly little how such differences in opportunities impact human motivation. To test this, we designed a study in which we arbitrarily varied the reward offered to each participant in a group for performing the same task. Participants then had to decide whether or not they were willing to exert effort to receive their reward. Across three experiments, we found that the unequal distribution of offers reduced participants' motivation to pursue rewards even when their relative position in the distribution was high, and despite the decision being of no benefit to others and reducing the reward for oneself. Participants' feelings partially mediated this relationship. In particular, a large disparity in rewards was associated with greater unhappiness, which was associated with lower willingness to work-even when controlling for absolute reward and its relative value, both of which also affected decisions to work. A model that incorporated a person's relative position and unfairness of rewards in the group fit better to the data than other popular models describing the effects of inequality. Our findings suggest opportunity-gaps can trigger psychological dynamics that hurt productivity and well-being of all involved."
https://openalex.org/W3083501654,"To quantify changes in the patellar tendon length following surgical correction of medial patellar luxation in dogs and evaluate potential risk factors associated with patellar tendon elongation.Retrospective case series (n = 50).Dogs that underwent surgery for medial patellar luxation correction and had 2-3 months follow up were included. Digital radiographs were utilized to quantify the patellar tendon length to patellar length ratio at various follow-up points. Odds ratio comparisons between potential risk factors associated with changes in patellar tendon length were performed.Post-operative patellar tendon lengthening of ≥ 5% was observed in 20% of stifles and post-operative patellar tendon shortening of ≥ 5% was observed in 22% of stifles at the 2-3 month follow up period. The risk factors including age, body weight, trochleoplasty and grade of medial patellar luxation were not significantly associated with risk of patellar tendon elongation. Patellar tendon lengthening was not associated with recurrence of luxation.Patellar tendon lengthening and shortening can be observed in dogs following common medial patellar luxation corrective procedures in the short term follow up period. Patellar tendon lengthening does not appear to be associated with age, weight, trochleoplasty, grade of luxation, or risk of luxation recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W3083551404,"Background Velopharyngeal structure augmentation methods are used as alternatives to pharyngeal flap operations. Recently, we investigated the sites of velopharyngeal structure augmentation in dogs and reported that the most effective injection location is the soft palate. However, there have been no reports regarding the optimal materials for implantation or injection. In this study, we aimed to investigate the injectable materials used in soft palate augmentation in dogs to ameliorate velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI). Methods Endoscopic soft palate augmentation (ESPA) was performed in dogs using purified sodium hyaluronate, atelocollagen, or autogenic fat tissue. ESPA is an original technique developed by our group, and this is the first report of its performance. Moreover, we assessed the amount of nasal air leakage during inspiration at rest and during expiration under the rebreathing system at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months after injection of these materials. Results The amount of nasal air leakage during expiration under the rebreathing system was significantly decreased in all dogs injected with the ESPA materials, but neither apnea nor hypopnea was observed. Conclusions We investigated the optimal materials for use in ESPA, such as purified sodium hyaluronate, atelocollagen, or autogenic fat tissue. We found that all of them reduced nasal air leakage and only autogenic fat tissue showed significant histologic differences in dogs at 6 months. This technique may also be useful for the treatment of patients with VPI."
https://openalex.org/W3083688241,"SLAMF1 is often overexpressed in Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-infected B cell tumors. However, its role in the pathogenesis of EBV-infected B cell tumors remains largely unknown. Here, we generated SLAMF1-deficient EBV+ tumor cells and examined the effect of its deficiency on cell proliferation and cell survival. There were no significant differences in cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution for short periods between the SLAMF1-deficient and wild-type cells. However, the deficient cells were more resistant to an AKT inhibitor (MK-2206). When the both cells were co-cultured and repeatedly exposed to the limitations in nutrition and growth factors, the SLAMF1-deficient cells were gradually decreased. We observed that levels of phospho-AKT were differentially regulated according to the nutritional status between the SLAMF1-deficient and wild-type cells. A decrease in phospho-AKT was observed in SLAMF1-deficient cells as well as an increase in pro-apoptotic Bim just before cell passage, which may have been due to the loss of SLAMF1 under poor growth condition. Overall, SLAMF1 is not a strong survival factor, but it seems to be necessary for cell survival in unfavorable growth condition."
https://openalex.org/W3083280973,"Background Obstetric fistula significantly impacts women’s mental health and well-being. Routine screening for mental health in fistula repair programs can be a gateway to link patients to services, and can produce routine data to inform programmatic investments. This study observed the integration of a mental health screening program into an obstetric fistula repair program in Mali, with two specific objectives: 1) to describe the social and mental health well-being of women presenting with obstetric fistulas in Mali, and 2) to document the impact of the mental health screening pilot on policy change in Mali. Methods Seven fistula repair campaigns were conducted between June 2016 and May 2017. All individuals presenting for fistula repair completed a mental health assessment at intake, including a depression screener (PHQ-9) and an assessment of psycho-social impacts of fistula. The depression screener was repeated three months following inpatient discharge. Findings were shared with stakeholders in Mali and impacts on policy were documented. Results Of 207 women who presented for fistula repair, 167 patients completed the mental health assessment at surgical intake, and 130 patients repeated the screener at 3-month follow-up. At intake, 36.5% of women had moderate or severe depression, decreasing to 16.9% at follow-up. The mean depression score differed significantly by timepoint (9.14 vs. 6.72, p <0.001). Results were shared in a report with stakeholders, and consultations with the Mali Ministry of Health. As a result of advocacy, mental health was a key component of Mali’s National Fistula Prevention and Treatment Strategy (2018–2022). Conclusion The high prevalence of depression in Malian fistula patients underscores a need for more robust mental health support for patients after surgery. Data on mental health from routine screening informs community reintegration strategies for individual patients, elevates the overall quality of care of fistula repair programs by addressing patients’ holistic health needs, and contributes to evidence-informed decision-making and data-driven policy change within the larger health system."
https://openalex.org/W3083624457,"Market liquidity ensures the marketability of security and is an indispensable feature of stock markets. Previous studies have emphasized the role of stock market liquidity in empirical finance. However, they have inadequately explored its multidimensional nature. This study eliminates the ambiguities related to market liquidity by precisely measuring it by using popular and proven liquidity measures. As such, the present study aims to evaluate market liquidity in terms of depth, breadth, tightness, and immediacy in the Indian equity market and also identifies crucial interdependencies between liquidity dimensions. The study selects 500 stocks constituting the NIFTY 500 index of the National Stock Exchange, India, as of 26th May 2019. The data on trading volume, bid price, ask price, the number of shares outstanding, closing share prices were retrieved for the period from 1st April 2009 to 31st March 2019. The study employs Share Turnover, Amihud Illiquidity Ratio, Relative Quoted Spreads, and Coefficient of Elasticity of Trading for liquidity measurement. The Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) model is used to establish the simultaneous relationships between liquidity dimensions. The analysis is conducted at the aggregate market level as well as across turnover based stock groups divided based on their rankings in terms of stock specific share turnover. The empirical results evidenced the presence of consistent depth, strong breadth, and immediacy but lower tightness in the Indian equity market. The market depth and tightness appear to be relevant in determining dimensional interdependencies. Also, less frequently traded stocks exhibit higher illiquidity in the wake of lower tightness. The findings of this study will assist the investors to wisely understand the multifaceted nature of market liquidity and base their trading decisions accordingly. Moreover, the regulators of the stock exchange can devise liquidity enhancing policies based on the directional movements among liquidity dimensions."
