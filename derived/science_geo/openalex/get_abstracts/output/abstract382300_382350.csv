https://openalex.org/W2076922024,"Here, we describe a biomimetic microsystem that reconstitutes the critical functional alveolar-capillary interface of the human lung. This bioinspired microdevice reproduces complex integrated organ-level responses to bacteria and inflammatory cytokines introduced into the alveolar space. In nanotoxicology studies, this lung mimic revealed that cyclic mechanical strain accentuates toxic and inflammatory responses of the lung to silica nanoparticles. Mechanical strain also enhances epithelial and endothelial uptake of nanoparticulates and stimulates their transport into the underlying microvascular channel. Similar effects of physiological breathing on nanoparticle absorption are observed in whole mouse lung. Mechanically active ""organ-on-a-chip"" microdevices that reconstitute tissue-tissue interfaces critical to organ function may therefore expand the capabilities of cell culture models and provide low-cost alternatives to animal and clinical studies for drug screening and toxicology applications."

Because donor tissue is in short supply, there has been a long-standing interest in engineering functional and transplantable lung tissue in the laboratory. Petersen et al. (p. 538 , published online 24 June; see the Perspective by Wagner and Griffith ) now report an important step in this direction. After gently removing the cellular constituents of rat lungs with detergent, the residual scaffold of extracellular matrix—which retained the compliance and mechanical properties of the original lung—was re-seeded with a mixture of lung epithelial and endothelial cells and cultured in a bioreactor. Within a few days, the engineered lung tissue contained alveoli, microvessels, and small airways that were repopulated with the appropriate cell types. When transplanted into a rat for short time periods, the engineered lung showed evidence of gas exchange."
https://openalex.org/W2038329126,"Defining Time-Zero When a high-energy photon hits an atom and is absorbed, the result can be the excitation and emission of an electron. This photoemission, or photoelectric effect, is generally assumed to occur instantaneously, and represents the definition of “time-zero” in clocking such ultrafast events. Schultze et al. (p. 1658 , see the cover; see the Perspective by van der Hart ) use ultrafast spectroscopy, with light pulses on the time scale of several tens of attoseconds, to test this assumption directly. They excite neon atoms with 100 eV photons and find that there is a small (20-attosecond) time delay between the emission of electrons from the 2 s and 2 p orbitals of the atoms. These results should have implications in modeling electron dynamics occurring on ultrafast time scales."

CF 3 is a powerful attractor of electron density within a given molecular framework, and recently fluorine-hydrocarbon interactions have emerged as a distinct complement to the more traditional hydrophilic/hydrophobic interplay that governs docking between small molecules and proteins. Cho et al. (p. 1679 ) now present an efficient method for appending CF 3 groups to a broad range of aryl substrates. A carefully optimized palladium catalyst was able to speed up a critical elimination step that has plagued previous efforts to realize a general solution to this synthetic challenge."
https://openalex.org/W1981309347,"A major puzzle of paleoclimatology is why, after a long interval of cooling climate, each late Quaternary ice age ended with a relatively short warming leg called a termination. We here offer a comprehensive hypothesis of how Earth emerged from the last global ice age. A prerequisite was the growth of very large Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, whose subsequent collapse created stadial conditions that disrupted global patterns of ocean and atmospheric circulation. The Southern Hemisphere westerlies shifted poleward during each northern stadial, producing pulses of ocean upwelling and warming that together accounted for much of the termination in the Southern Ocean and Antarctica. Rising atmospheric CO2 during southern upwelling pulses augmented warming during the last termination in both polar hemispheres."
https://openalex.org/W2126147289,"A Gut Feeling The mammalian gut is colonized by many nonpathogenic, commensal microbes. In order to prevent the body from mounting inappropriate immune responses to these microbes, plasma cells in the gut produce large amounts of immunoglobulin A (IgA) specific for commensal bacteria. Because of the difficulties of uncoupling IgA production from microbial colonization, how commensal bacteria shape the gut IgA response is not well understood. Hapfelmeier et al. (p. 1705 ; see the Perspective by Cerutti ) have now devised a way to get around this problem by developing a reversible system of gut bacterial colonization in mice. Commensal-specific IgA responses were able to persist for long periods of time in the absence of microbial colonization and required the presence of high microbial loads in the gut for their induction. IgA responses upon bacterial reexposure did not resemble the synergistic prime-boost effect seen in classical immunological memory responses but rather exhibited an additive effect that matched the current bacterial content present in the gut. The body thus constantly adapts the commensal-specific immune response to the microbial species present in the gut, which contrasts with the systemic immune response, which persists in the absence of pathogenic microbes."
https://openalex.org/W2030879654,"Too Close to Home? Why are some species common while others are exceedingly rare? Attempts to answer this question have met limited success, particularly in hyperdiverse communities, such as tropical forests. Comita et al. (p. 330 , published online 24 June; see the cover) reveal a previously overlooked explanation. A large data set on seedling dynamics of 180 tree species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, combined with Bayesian statistical techniques, revealed that species abundance is shaped by the degree to which species negatively impact their own regeneration. Rare species regenerated far less well than common species in the proximity of conspecific neighbors, suggesting a mechanism determining the relative abundances of tree species in highly diverse tropical forest communities."
https://openalex.org/W2012271461,"Let There Be Light Retinitis pigmentosa, a disease that can result from a wide variety of genetic defects, causes degeneration of photoreceptor cells in the retina and leads to blindness. In the course of the disease, it is generally the rod photoreceptor cells that degenerate first. Cone photoreceptor cells may persist, but in a damaged and nonfunctional state. Busskamp et al. (p. 413 , published online 24 June; see the cover; see the Perspective by Cepko ) have now applied a gene therapy approach to mouse models of retinitis pigmentosa. Inducing expression of a bacterial light-activated ion pump, halorho dopsin, in the damaged cone cells improved visual responses in the diseased mouse retinas. Thus, it may be possible to rescue cone photoreceptors therapeutically, even after they have already been damaged."
https://openalex.org/W1991761746,"Tangle-Free Polymer Dynamics The dynamics of polymer chains at interfaces will differ from the dynamics in the bulk. While hard interfaces generally cause chain motions to slow down, at free surfaces the dynamics should generally speed up. A consequence is that for thin polymer films, there should be a reduction in the glass transition temperature ( T g ), but a wide range of effects have been seen in different polymeric materials. Now, Yang et al. (p. 1676 ) show that for short, unentangled polystyrene polymers, there is a direct correlation between the viscosity and the glass transition temperature, and that the reduction in T g is due to a surface mobile layer that dominates the behavior as the films decrease in thickness."
https://openalex.org/W2069581519,"Touch is both the first sense to develop and a critical means of information acquisition and environmental manipulation. Physical touch experiences may create an ontological scaffold for the development of intrapersonal and interpersonal conceptual and metaphorical knowledge, as well as a springboard for the application of this knowledge. In six experiments, holding heavy or light clipboards, solving rough or smooth puzzles, and touching hard or soft objects nonconsciously influenced impressions and decisions formed about unrelated people and situations. Among other effects, heavy objects made job candidates appear more important, rough objects made social interactions appear more difficult, and hard objects increased rigidity in negotiations. Basic tactile sensations are thus shown to influence higher social cognitive processing in dimension-specific and metaphor-specific ways."
https://openalex.org/W1973548823,"Pulsars are famed for their rotational clock-like stability and their highly-repeatable pulse shapes. However, it has long been known that there are unexplained deviations (often termed ""timing noise"") from the rate at which we predict these clocks should run. We show that timing behaviour often results from typically two different spin-down rates. Pulsars switch abruptly between these states, often quasi-periodically, leading to the observed spin-down patterns. We show that for six pulsars the timing noise is correlated with changes in the pulse shape. Many pulsar phenomena including mode-changing, nulling, intermittency, pulse shape variability and timing noise are therefore linked and caused by changes in the pulsar's magnetosphere. We consider the possibility that high-precision monitoring of pulse profiles could lead to the formation of highly-stable pulsar clocks."

https://openalex.org/W1982298072,"Addicts Lose Plasticity What are the biological mechanisms associated with the transition from occasional drug use to addiction? In rats, like in humans, even after a prolonged period of drug intake, only a limited number of animals develop addiction-like behavior despite the amount of drug taken by all subjects being the same. Kasanetz et al. (p. 1709 ) compared the expression of N -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA)–dependent long-term depression (NMDA-LTD) in the nucleus accumbens of addicted and nonaddicted rats. Initially, once drug self-administration had been learned and consolidated, but before the appearance of addiction-like behavior, LTD was suppressed in all animals independently of their vulnerability to addiction at a later stage. However, after 2 months, when addiction-like behavior appears, LTD was persistently lost in the addicted animals. In contrast, normal NMDA-LTD reappeared in animals that maintained a controlled drug intake without becoming addicted."

https://openalex.org/W2094137451,"The amide bond is one of nature's most common functional and structural elements, as the backbones of all natural peptides and proteins are composed of amide bonds. Amides are also present in many therapeutic small molecules. The construction of amide bonds using available methods relies principally on dehydrative approaches, although oxidative and radical-based methods are representative alternatives. In nearly every example, carbon and nitrogen bear electrophilic and nucleophilic character, respectively, during the carbon-nitrogen bond-forming step. Here we show that activation of amines and nitroalkanes with an electrophilic iodine source can lead directly to amide products. Preliminary observations support a mechanism in which the polarities of the two reactants are reversed (German, umpolung) during carbon-nitrogen bond formation relative to traditional approaches. The use of nitroalkanes as acyl anion equivalents provides a conceptually innovative approach to amide and peptide synthesis, and one that might ultimately provide for efficient peptide synthesis that is fully reliant on enantioselective methods."
https://openalex.org/W2016170408,"Soluble oligomers of Aβ42 peptide are believed to play a major role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). It was recently found that at least some of the neurotoxic effects of these oligomers may be mediated by specific binding to the prion protein, PrPC, on the cell surface (Laurén, J., Gimbel, D. A., Nygaard, H. B., Gilbert, J. W., and Strittmatter, S. M. (2009) Nature 457, 1128–1132). Here we characterized the interaction between synthetic Aβ42 oligomers and the recombinant human prion protein (PrP) using two biophysical techniques: site-directed spin labeling and surface plasmon resonance. Our data indicate that this binding is highly specific for a particular conformation adopted by the peptide in soluble oligomeric species. The binding appears to be essentially identical for the Met129 and Val129 polymorphic forms of human PrP, suggesting that the role of PrP codon 129 polymorphism as a risk factor in AD is due to factors unrelated to the interaction with Aβ oligomers. It was also found that in addition to the previously identified ∼95–110 segment, the second region of critical importance for the interaction with Aβ42 oligomers is a cluster of basic residues at the extreme N terminus of PrP (residues 23–27). The deletion of any of these segments results in a major loss of the binding function, indicating that these two regions likely act in concert to provide a high affinity binding site for Aβ42 oligomers. This insight may help explain the interplay between the postulated protective and pathogenic roles of PrP in AD and may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies as well.

In contrast to poor quantitative correlation between the burden of insoluble fibrillar amyloid plagues and the degree of dementia, the severity of AD appears to correlate well with the concentration of soluble Aβ oligomers (9Klein W.L.

Furthermore, these soluble oligomers have been shown to be potent neurotoxins in vitro and in vivo; among other effects, they were reported to inhibit hippocampal long term potentiation, a widely used electrophysiological measure of synaptic plasticity related to learning and memory, and cause impairment of long term memory in rats (9Klein W.L.

However, despite rapid progress in the field, the biochemical and biophysical mechanisms by which Aβ oligomers interact with synapses and lead to their functional impairment remain largely unknown. An important recent development was the identification of cellular prion protein, PrPC, as a high affinity binding site for Aβ oligomers (17Laurén J. Gimbel D.A. Nygaard H.B. Gilbert J.W. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2009; 457: 1128-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). Human PrPC is an abundantly expressed 209-residue glycoprotein, which largely localizes to cholesterol-rich lipid rafts on the outer surface of the cell membrane via a C-terminal glycophosphatidylinositol anchor (18Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). Although the protein is best known for its role, in a misfolded state, as a pathogenic agent in prion diseases (18Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Prion. 2009; 3: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), playing a role in copper homeostasis, cellular signaling, neuroprotection, cell adhesion, and synaptogenesis. Using an unbiased proteome-wide screen, Lauren et al. (17Laurén J. Gimbel D.A. Nygaard H.B. Gilbert J.W. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2009; 457: 1128-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar) recently found that cell surface PrPC acts as a highly specific binding site for synthetic Aβ42 oligomers. Importantly, the authors also demonstrated that these soluble Aβ42 oligomers inhibit long term potentiation in hippocampal slices from wild-type mice but not in those from the PrPC-null mice. Thus, these results strongly suggest that PrPC may act as a long sought specific receptor that mediates at least some of the toxic effects of Aβ oligomers. Apart from opening new avenues in AD research, identification of such a receptor provides a potentially valuable target for pharmacological intervention. Development of any therapeutic strategies targeting Aβ oligomer-PrPC interaction would require detailed knowledge of the molecular aspects of this interaction. Here we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and site-directed spin labeling to characterize PrP-Aβ42 binding at the biophysical level and to identify specific segments of the prion protein that are involved in this interaction. Our data demonstrate that in addition to the previously postulated ∼95–110 region, the cluster of basic residues within the N-terminal 23–27 segment of PrP is critically important for effective binding to Aβ42 oligomers. The plasmid encoding human prion protein (huPrP) with an N-terminal linker containing a His6 tail and a thrombin cleavage site was previously described (25Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36859-36865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The deletion variants and Cys mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using appropriate primers and the QuikChange kit (Stratagene), and the sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. Proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (25Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol.

Spin labeling with the [1-oxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-pyrolline-3-methyl]-methanethiosulfonate label and final purification of labeled proteins were performed as described previously (27Cobb N.J. Sönnichsen F.D. McHaourab H. Surewicz W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 18946-18951Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 276 nm using extinction coefficients appropriate for each deletion variant. Aβ42 peptide was purchased from American Peptide Co. (Sunnyvale, CA) as lyophilized powder. The peptide was dissolved in hexafluoro-2-propanol, aliquoted, and stored (after solvent evaporation) at −80 °C. Immediately before use, an aliquot was dissolved in a freshly prepared 10 mm NaOH solution and disaggregated as described previously (28Fezoui Y. Hartley D.M. Harper J.D. Khurana R. Walsh D.M. Condron M.M. Selkoe D.J. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Fink A.L. Teplow D.B. Amyloid. 2000; 7: 166-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The basic Aβ42 stock solution was then combined with a sodium phosphate buffer (final pH 7.4) precooled to 4 °C, and this solution was used immediately as a preparation of Aβ42 monomer. Aβ42 oligomers were generated by incubating the solution of monomeric Aβ42 (100 μm) at room temperature for 24 h (29Hou L. Kang I. Marchant R.E. Zagorski M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40173-40176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Aβ42 fibrils were generated by incubating the solution of the peptide in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for ∼6 days at 37 °C or under acidic conditions (pH 2) for 24 h (30Stine Jr., W.B. Dahlgren K.N. Krafft G.A. LaDu M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11612-11622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). The morphology of oligomers and fibrils was analyzed by atomic force microscopy as described previously (31Jones E.M. Surewicz W.K. Cell. 2005; 121: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Interaction between human PrP and Aβ42 oligomers was probed by SPR using a Biacore 3000 instrument. Prion protein was diluted to 1 μm in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip using the amine coupling chemistry. After coupling, the chip was deactivated with 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5. A reference channel of the chip was subjected to an identical chemical processing in the absence of the prion protein. Aβ42 monomer, oligomers, or fibrils were injected in a running buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min followed by the injection of the same buffer in the absence of Aβ42 peptide. Typically, association and dissociation curves were monitored for 5 min each. Regeneration of the surfaces was achieved by the injection of 25 mm NaOH at the flow rate of 100 μl/min. Samples for EPR spectroscopy were prepared by incubating spin-labeled huPrP (2 μm) for 1 h with different forms of Aβ42 at varying concentrations. Samples were then transferred into glass capillaries, and EPR spectra were measured at room temperature using a Bruker EMX spectrometer equipped with high sensitivity probe head as described previously (27Cobb N.J. Sönnichsen F.D. McHaourab H. Surewicz W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 18946-18951Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). For construction of binding isotherms, spectra for huPrP/Aβ42 oligomer mixtures were normalized to the same number of spins, and the amplitude of the low field sharp feature (labeled a in Fig. 5A) was measured for each spectrum. Because this amplitude is proportional to the population of free protein, the fraction of bound huPrP in the presence of different amounts of Aβ42 oligomers, θ, was calculated as θ = (A0 − A)/(A0 − Amax), where A0 is the amplitude of low field sharp feature for free huPrP, and A and Amax represent this amplitude at a given concentration of Aβ42 oligomers and under saturating conditions, respectively. To determine the apparent equilibrium binding parameters, we used a model assuming that each huPrP molecule, P, interacts with a binding site on Aβ42 oligomer, O, according to the equilibrium It is further assumed that each binding site consists of n Aβ monomers. Therefore, [O]T = [Aβ]T/n, where [O]T is the total concentration of binding sites and [Aβ]T is the total concentration of Aβ42.

These preparations appear morphologically similar to those used in previous studies on Aβ42 interaction with the prion protein (17Laurén J. Gimbel D.A. Nygaard H.B. Gilbert J.W. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2009; 457: 1128-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar, 32Balducci C. Beeg M. Stravalaci M. Bastone A. Sclip A. Biasini E. Tapella L. Colombo L. Manzoni C. Borsello T. Chiesa R. Gobbi M. Salmona M. Forloni G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 2295-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 also shows atomic force microscopy images of mature Aβ42 fibrils (panel C) as well as fibrils fragmented by sonication (panel D). The binding interaction between recombinant full-length huPrP and different forms of Aβ42 was investigated using SPR. The protein was immobilized on the surface of a CM5 sensor chip, and Aβ42 preparations were then injected (binding phase) followed by the injection of buffer alone (dissociation phase). Typical sensorgrams at several concentrations of Aβ42 oligomers are shown in Fig. 2A; they clearly demonstrate concentration-dependent binding of these oligomers to immobilized huPrP. Essentially identical results were obtained using Met129 and Val129 huPrP (data for Val129 not shown for brevity), indicating that the Met/Val polymorphism at residue 129 does not affect prion protein interaction with Aβ42 oligomers. In sharp contrast to the oligomers, no binding was detected for Aβ42 monomers or mature amyloid fibrils (Fig. 2B). To test whether the striking differences between the oligomers and fibrillar aggregates are not just due to the difference in size of these assemblies, long fibrils were fragmented by sonication. Also, in this case, no binding to huPrP could be detected by SPR (Fig. 2B). In many cases, analysis of SPR data allows calculation of binding constants from the ratio of rate constants for the association and dissociation reactions (33Schuck P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, consistent with the previous observation (32Balducci C. Beeg M. Stravalaci M. Bastone A. Sclip A. Biasini E. Tapella L. Colombo L. Manzoni C. Borsello T. Chiesa R. Gobbi M. Salmona M. Forloni G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 2295-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), the dissociation parts of sensorgrams for the huPrP-Aβ42 oligomer interaction were highly unusual in that they were almost horizontal, indicating very slow effective dissociation kinetics. This could be due to a number of factors, including secondary binding events that sometimes occur in SPR experiment and/or the obvious potential for multivalent binding between surface-immobilized PrP and large, heterogeneous in size oligomers consisting of many Aβ42 molecules. In any case, sensorgrams such as those shown in Fig. 2A do not allow reliable determination of dissociation rates. This, combined with the lack of analytical models for binding of heterogeneous oligomeric ligands, precluded quantitative assessment of SPR data in terms of binding constants. Therefore, we kept our analysis at a qualitative level, using the response (measured in resonance units) as an empirical measure of relative binding affinity for different deletion variants of huPrP. This approach, used successfully in previous SPR studies with other systems (34Visudtiphole V. Chalton D.A. Hong Q. Lakey J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 351: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 35Jiang J. Prasad K. Lafer E.M. Sousa R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 513-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), provides a tool for the assessment of the role of specific huPrP regions in the interaction with Aβ42 oligomers. To this end, we expressed and purified to homogeneity a number of deletion mutants of huPrP (Fig. 3A). Each of these proteins was immobilized onto the surface of a CM5 sensor chip at the same density (∼4000 resonance units (RU)), and SPR binding experiments were carried out under identical conditions. First, we tested the variant in which the entire N-terminal region 23–89 was removed (Δ23–89 huPrP), finding that this deletion results in essentially complete loss of binding capacity to Aβ42 oligomers (as indicated by the lack of any response in the sensorgram; Fig. 3B). Building on this observation, we then tested variants with partial deletions within the 23–89 region, Δ23–50 and Δ51–91. Although the deletion of residues 51–91 did not have any measurable effect, the removal of N-terminal residues 23–50 resulted in approximately an 8-fold reduction of the response in the sensorgram, indicating greatly reduced binding of Aβ42 oligomers (Fig. 3B). A similar impairment of Aβ42 binding was observed for the deletion variant Δ23–27 (Fig. 2B), indicating that the N-terminal cluster of basic residues 23KKRPK27 is critical for the interactions between prion protein and Aβ42 oligomers. To test the role of other regions, three additional deletion mutants were generated, Δ92–110 huPrP, Δ101–110 huPrP, and Δ111–125 huPrP. SPR data show that the removal of residues 92–110 results in a major loss of binding capacity (Fig. 3). The cluster of basic residues within the 101–110 segment appears to be only partly responsible for this effect as only partial loss of binding was observed for Δ101–110 huPrP. Finally, the sensorgram for the Δ111–125 variant was essentially identical to that for wild-type huPrP (Fig. 3C), indicating that the hydrophobic region 112–122 is not important for huPrP interaction with Aβ42 oligomers. The interaction between huPrP and Aβ42 was further probed by site-directed spin labeling coupled with EPR spectroscopy (36Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 37Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). In this approach, Gly at position 30 was replaced with Cys, and the latter residue was derivatized with the nitroxide label. The EPR spectrum of spin-labeled huPrP labeled at residue 30 (30R huPrP) in solution shows three relatively sharp lines (Fig. 4A). Such a spectrum is characteristic of a highly mobile nitroxide label (36Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 37Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), consistent with NMR data showing that the N-terminal part of huPrP is largely unstructured and flexible (38Zahn R. Liu A. Lührs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. López García F. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). If, as indicated by SPR data, the N-terminal part of PrP is involved in the interaction with Aβ42 oligomers, one would expect this interaction to result in a significant immobilization of the nitroxide label attached to residues within this region. Indeed, the EPR spectrum of 30R huPrP in the presence of Aβ42 oligomers (Aβ42 monomer to huPrP of 50:1) is dramatically different from that of the free protein, showing broad features characteristic of highly immobilized nitroxide (Fig. 4B). In contrast, no immobilization of the label was observed in the presence of Aβ42 monomer, mature amyloid fibrils, or fibrils fragmented by sonication. Thus, EPR data provide further evidence that huPrP interacts selectively with Aβ42 oligomers and has no apparent affinity for the monomeric peptide, amyloid fibrils or amyloid assemblies fragmented by sonication (Fig. 4, C–E). As shown previously for other systems (39Mchaourab H.S. Dodson E.K. Koteiche H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40557-40566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), distinct spectral properties of free and bound 30R huPrP provide a tool for quantitative analysis of equilibrium binding between prion protein and Aβ42 oligomers. To this end, 30R huPrP (2 μm) was titrated with increasing amounts of Aβ42 oligomers, and EPR spectra were recorded for each mixture. As shown in Fig. 5A, upon increasing the concentration of Aβ42, there was a decrease in the amplitude of low field sharp feature (labeled a), the intensity of which is a measure of the population of free huPrP. This was accompanied by an increase in the intensity of the immobilized component characteristic of the bound species (labeled b). For each huPrP/Aβ42 ratio, the molar fraction of free and bound 30R huPrP was determined from the intensity of the low field sharp feature (see “Experimental Procedures”), and these data were used to generate a binding isotherm (Fig. 5B). Fitting this isotherm to a simple equilibrium binding model (see “Experimental Procedures”) yields an apparent dissociation constant, Kd, of 71 nm and the number of Aβ42 monomers per binding site of 21. Next we used the site-directed spin labeling method to probe the effect of specific huPrP deletions on binding to Aβ42 oligomers. As shown in Fig. 6A, even at very high concentrations of Aβ42 oligomers, EPR spectra for 30R huPrP with deletions of residues 92–110 or 23–27 show only a very weak immobilized component. Because it is difficult to maintain Aβ42 in the oligomeric (nonfibrillar) state at peptide concentrations above ∼100 μm, we could not construct binding isotherms for these deletion variants. However, the much lower intensity of the immobilized component in EPR spectra for Δ92–110 huPrP and Δ23–27 huPrP as compared with wild-type protein clearly demonstrates that both deletions greatly impair huPrP binding to Aβ42 oligomers. In contrast, the spectra for Δ111–125 30R huPrP in the presence of Aβ42 oligomers were very similar to those for wild-type protein, demonstrating that residues 111–125 are of little importance for Aβ42 oligomer binding. To assess the effect of the deletion of the entire 23–89 segment, we prepared a huPrP variant with the nitroxide at residue 113 (113R huPrP). As expected, the EPR spectrum of free 113R huPrP displays three relatively sharp lines characteristic of highly mobile nitroxide, whereas in the presence of Aβ42 oligomers, the spectrum shows features characteristic of an immobilized nitroxide (Fig. 6B), indicating formation of a complex. In contrast, no immobilized component could be detected in the spectrum of the Δ23–89 113R huPrP mixture with Aβ42 oligomers, confirming the SPR-based observation that the deletion of residues 23–89 completely abolishes the interaction. Altogether, the SPR and EPR data consistently demonstrate that human prion protein binds selectively and with high affinity to Aβ42 oligomers and that this interaction is critically dependent on the presence of N-terminal residues 23–27 as well as residues within the ∼92–110 region. A number of recent observations point to an intriguing link between the cellular form of prion protein, PrPC, and AD (see Ref. 40Kellett K.A. Hooper N.M. Prion. 2009; 3: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar for review). Early studies in this regard focused on genetic analysis, finding that the gene encoding human prion protein (PRNP) is a potential AD susceptibility gene (41Bertram L. McQueen M.B. Mullin K. Blacker D. Tanzi R.E. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar) and that Met/Val polymorphism at codon 129 in PRNP may be a risk factor for AD in certain populations (42Dermaut B. Croes E.A. Rademakers R. Van den Broeck M. Cruts M. Hofman A. van Duijn C.M. Van Broeckhoven C. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 43Riemenschneider M. Klopp N. Xiang W. Wagenpfeil S. Vollmert C. Müller U. Förstl H. Illig T. Kretzschmar H. Kurz A. Neurology. 2004; 63: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). More recently, it was found that PrPC inhibits cleavage of APP by β-secretase BACE1, thereby decreasing production of Aβ peptides (44Parkin E.T. Watt N.T. Hussain I. Eckman E.A. Eckman C.B. Manson J.C. Baybutt H.N. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 11062-11067Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This effect, suggestive that PrPC may have a protective role against AD, appears to be modulated by PRNP polymorphism at codon 129. The most recent twist is the finding that PrPC may act as a high affinity receptor for Aβ42 oligomers (17Laurén J. Gimbel D.A. Nygaard H.B. Gilbert J.W. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2009; 457: 1128-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). Binding to this receptor was found to mediate Aβ42 oligomer-induced inhibition of long term potentiation in hippocampal slices, as indicated by the lack of such inhibition in slices derived from mice in which the PrP gene was knocked out (17Laurén J. Gimbel D.A. Nygaard H.B. Gilbert J.W. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2009; 457: 1128-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). The latter observation strongly suggests that PrPC mediates at least some of the toxic effects of Aβ oligomers and, thus, plays an important role in AD pathogenesis, although the clinical relevance of these findings is yet to be demonstrated (32Balducci C. Beeg M. Stravalaci M. Bastone A. Sclip A. Biasini E. Tapella L. Colombo L. Manzoni C. Borsello T. Chiesa R. Gobbi M. Salmona M. Forloni G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 2295-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The postulated protective function of PrPC as a modulator of APP processing and its pathogenic role as a modulator of Aβ toxicity are not necessarily mutually exclusive; rather, they suggest a possibility of an intriguing feedback loop between these effects (40Kellett K.A. Hooper N.M. Prion. 2009; 3: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because the finding regarding the role of PrPC as a mediator of Aβ oligomer toxicity has potentially major implications for AD research, it is important to understand the mechanism of the interaction between these two proteins at the molecular level. This can be best studied by biophysical methods using purified prion protein, the approach that avoids interference of other potential Aβ binding partners present in the cellular environment. Here we characterized the interaction between recombinant human PrP prion protein and Aβ42 using two complementary biophysical methods, SPR and the site-directed spin labeling. Consistent with previous observations in COS-7 cells and hippocampal neurons (17Laurén J. Gimbel D.A. Nygaard H.B. Gilbert J.W. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2009; 457: 1128-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar), both biophysical techniques consistently demonstrate that huPrP interacts strongly with soluble Aβ42 oligomers, whereas there is no detectable interaction with the monomeric form of the peptide or mature amyloid fibrils. Because previous data indicate that cytotoxic effects of fibrillar aggregates may depend on fibril length (45Xue W.F. Hellewell A.L. Gosal W.S. Homans S.W. Hewitt E.W. Radford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 34272-34282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), we also examined the effect of fibril fragmentation on Aβ42 binding. However, akin to long fibrils, no interaction was detected for fibrils that were fragmented by sonication. Thus, selective binding of huPrP observed for soluble oligomers is not related to the smaller size of these assemblies but reflects the strong specificity of the interaction for a particular conformation of Aβ42 in soluble oligomeric species. The apparent dissociation constant for this interaction is ∼70 nm, a value remarkably close to that estimated by Lauren et al. (17Laurén J. Gimbel D.A. Nygaard H.B. Gilbert J.W. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2009; 457: 1128-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar) for binding of similar oligomers to PrPC-expressing COS-7 cells. Furthermore, formal analysis of our data indicates that the oligomer binding site consists of ∼20 Aβ42 monomers. Given the unavoidable heterogeneity of our (and any other) preparations of synthetic Aβ42 oligomers, this should be considered an average value, possibly corresponding to the average size of oligomeric species. The main focus of the present study is on precise mapping of specific huPrP regions responsible for the interaction with Aβ42 oligomers. Based on limited data, it was previously postulated that the 95–110 region is a principal site for Aβ42 binding (17Laurén J. Gimbel D.A. Nygaard H.B. Gilbert J.W. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2009; 457: 1128-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). However, to our surprise, we found that the deletion of the 23–90 segment results in a complete loss of huPrP binding to Aβ oligomers, clearly indicating that residues within this N-terminal region play a major role in the interaction. These critical residues were identified as a cluster of basic amino acids 23KKRPK27 at the very N terminus of huPrP (Fig. 3A). The second determinant of binding to Aβ42 oligomers appears to be the region ∼92–110, consistent with the previous finding regarding the role of residues 95–110 (17Laurén J. Gimbel D.A. Nygaard H.B. Gilbert J.W. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 2009; 457: 1128-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). The highly charged, lysine-rich cluster within this ∼92–110 region is only a part of this determinant, as indicated by a partial loss of binding observed for Δ101–110 huPrP. Our present data clearly demonstrate that both the N-terminal residues 23–27 as well as the ∼92–110 region are critically important for PrP interactions with Aβ42 oligomers as the deletion of any of these regions results in a major loss of the binding function. Although this strongly suggests that these two segments act in concert to provide high affinity binding sites for Aβ42 oligomers, one cannot formally rule out the possibility that for one of them, the effect on interaction could be via influencing conformation of the whole protein rather than by direct binding to the Aβ oligomer. The latter scenario is, however, less likely because both the 23–27 and the ∼92–110 regions are located within the part of the prion protein that is highly flexible and natively unstructured (38Zahn R. Liu A. Lührs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. López García F. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NMR studies clearly demonstrate that the deletion of this entire unstructured region in PrP (up to residue ∼120) has no effect on the conformation of the folded C-terminal domain (38Zahn R. Liu A. Lührs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. López García F. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). In contrast to the critical role of specific segments within the N-terminal part of PrP, the folded C-terminal domain does not appear to be directly involved in the interaction with Aβ oligomers. The region around residue 129 is also not involved, as indicated by very similar binding observed for the Met129 and Val129 polymorphic forms of huPrP. Thus, the role of codon 129 polymorphism as a risk factor in AD must be due to factors unrelated to PrP interaction with Aβ oligomers. The same polybasic region at the extreme N terminus of PrP that we identified as a crucial determinant of binding to Aβ42 oligomers has been previously found to be critical for the interaction of prion protein with β-secretase and the resulting inhibition of its APP-cleaving activity (44Parkin E.T. Watt N.T. Hussain I. Eckman E.A. Eckman C.B. Manson J.C. Baybutt H.N. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 11062-11067Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The observation that the same region of PrP mediates the potential protective effect of the protein in AD (inhibition of β-secretase cleavage) and its toxic role (Aβ42 oligomer-induced long term potentiation blockage) is highly intriguing, suggesting that there may be a subtle balance between these effects that is controlled by additional cellular cofactors. One group of likely cofactors is glycosaminoglycans, which compete for the same polybasic binding site at the PrP N terminus (46Pan T. Wong B.S. Liu T. Li R. Petersen R.B. Sy M.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 47Warner R.G. Hundt C. Weiss S. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18421-18430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and appear to be required for the inhibitory action of PrPC on APP cleavage by β-secretase (44Parkin E.T. Watt N.T. Hussain I. Eckman E.A. Eckman C.B. Manson J.C. Baybutt H.N. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 11062-11067Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Apart from providing insight into the mechanism by which the prion protein could modulate the pathogenic process in AD, the identification of specific PrP regions that are crucial for the interaction with Aβ42 oligomers may also contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies that target this interaction. We thank Dr. Krystyna Surewicz for providing Val129 huPrP."

The x-ray structure of the C-family cbb3 oxidase from Pseudomonas stutzeri at 3.2 angstrom resolution shows an electron supply system different from families A and B. Like family-B HCOs, C HCOs have only one pathway, which conducts protons via an alternative tyrosine-histidine cross-link.

https://openalex.org/W2034017959,"Radiotherapy is a widely used treatment option in cancer. However, recent evidence suggests that doses of ionizing radiation (IR) delivered inside the tumor target volume, during fractionated radiotherapy, can promote tumor invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, the tissues that surround the tumor area are also exposed to low doses of IR that are lower than those delivered inside the tumor mass, because external radiotherapy is delivered to the tumor through multiple radiation beams, in order to prevent damage of organs at risk. The biological effects of these low doses of IR on the healthy tissue surrounding the tumor area, and in particular on the vasculature remain largely to be determined. We found that doses of IR lower or equal to 0.8 Gy enhance endothelial cell migration without impinging on cell proliferation or survival. Moreover, we show that low-dose IR induces a rapid phosphorylation of several endothelial cell proteins, including the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Receptor-2 and induces VEGF production in hypoxia mimicking conditions. By activating the VEGF Receptor-2, low-dose IR enhances endothelial cell migration and prevents endothelial cell death promoted by an anti-angiogenic drug, bevacizumab. In addition, we observed that low-dose IR accelerates embryonic angiogenic sprouting during zebrafish development and promotes adult angiogenesis during zebrafish fin regeneration and in the murine Matrigel assay. Using murine experimental models of leukemia and orthotopic breast cancer, we show that low-dose IR promotes tumor growth and metastasis and that these effects were prevented by the administration of a VEGF receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor immediately before IR exposure. These findings demonstrate a new mechanism to the understanding of the potential pro-metastatic effect of IR and may provide a new rationale basis to the improvement of current radiotherapy protocols."

https://openalex.org/W1988887339,"Heparanase activity is highly implicated in cell dissemination associated with tumor metastasis, angiogenesis, and inflammation. Heparanase expression is induced in many hematological and solid tumors, associated with poor prognosis. Heparanase homolog, termed heparanase 2 (Hpa2), was cloned based on sequence homology. Detailed characterization of Hpa2 at the biochemical, cellular, and clinical levels has not been so far reported, and its role in normal physiology and pathological disorders is obscure. We provide evidence that unlike heparanase, Hpa2 is not subjected to proteolytic processing and exhibits no enzymatic activity typical of heparanase. Notably, the full-length Hpa2c protein inhibits heparanase enzymatic activity, likely due to its high affinity to heparin and heparan sulfate and its ability to associate physically with heparanase. Hpa2 expression was markedly elevated in head and neck carcinoma patients, correlating with prolonged time to disease recurrence (follow-up to failure; p = 0.006) and inversely correlating with tumor cell dissemination to regional lymph nodes (N-stage; p = 0.03).

However, recent observations suggest that ES cell populations are heterogeneous with respect to the expression of Nanog and that individual ES cells reversibly change their Nanog expression level. Furthermore, it has been shown that cells exhibiting a low Nanog level are more likely to undergo differentiation. Applying a novel mathematical transcription factor network model we explore mechanisms and feedback regulations to describe the observed variation of the Nanog levels in mouse ES cells. In particular we show that these variations can occur under different assumptions yielding similar experimental characteristics. Based on model predictions we propose experimental strategies to distinguish between these explanations. Concluding from our results we argue that the heterogeneity with respect to the Nanog concentrations is most likely a functional element to control the differentiation propensity of an ES cell population. Furthermore, we provide a conceptual framework that consistently explains Nanog variability and a potential ""gate-keeper"" function of Nanog expression with respect to the control of ES cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1989014367,"Art v 1, the major pollen allergen of the composite plant mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) has been identified recently as a thionin-like protein with a bulky arabinogalactan-protein moiety. A close relative of mugwort, ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) is an important allergen source in North America, and, since 1990, ragweed has become a growing health concern in Europe as well. Weed pollen-sensitized patients demonstrated IgE reactivity to a ragweed pollen protein of apparently 29–31 kDa. This reaction could be inhibited by the mugwort allergen Art v 1. The purified ragweed pollen protein consisted of a 57-amino acid-long defensin-like domain with high homology to Art v 1 and a C-terminal proline-rich domain. This part contained hydroxyproline-linked arabinogalactan chains with one galactose and 5 to 20 and more α-arabinofuranosyl residues with some β-arabinoses in terminal positions as revealed by high field NMR. The ragweed protein contained only small amounts of the single hydroxyproline-linked β-arabinosyl residues, which form an important IgE binding determinant in Art v 1. cDNA clones for this protein were obtained from ragweed flowers. Immunological characterization revealed that the recombinant ragweed protein reacted with >30% of the weed pollen allergic patients. Therefore, this protein from ragweed pollen constitutes a novel important ragweed allergen and has been designated Amb a 4.

Therefore, this protein from ragweed pollen constitutes a novel important ragweed allergen and has been designated Amb a 4. The pollen of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) is a major cause of hay fever and associated asthma in Northern America. During the past few decades, ragweed has started to spread in many parts of central Europe, where it has become a serious health problem in the sensitized population. Several initiatives have formed to prevent further spread in e.g. France, Austria or southern Germany. The Compositae (or Asteraceae) family is one of the largest families of flowering plants, but only a few are important allergenic sources. These include Ambrosia (ragweed), Artemisia (mugwort), Helianthus (sunflower), and Parthenium (feverfew). It was further demonstrated that sera of mugwort allergic patients show considerable cross-reactivity with ragweed pollen extracts (1Oberhuber C. Ma Y. Wopfner N. Gadermaier G. Dedic A. Niggemann B.

IgE-binding to mugwort allergens in immunoblots was inhibited effectively by ragweed pollen extract (1Oberhuber C. Ma Y. Wopfner N. Gadermaier G. Dedic A. Niggemann B. Maderegger B. Gruber P.

So far, six groups of allergens have been identified in ragweed pollen. Most patients were classified as ragweed allergic if they reacted with the pectate lyases of the Amb a 1/2 group (3Gadermaier G. Wopfner N. Wallner M. Egger M. Didierlaurent A. Regl G. Aberger F.

In mugwort pollen, the major allergen is Art v 1, a protein with a globular domain homologous to thionins (or defensins) and a hydroxyproline-rich extensively glycosylated moiety (10Himly M.

Although the molecular weight of Art v 1 is 13–16 kDa, it is migrating between 24–28 kDa in SDS-PAGE, which results from this rigid and glycosylated C-terminal domain (11Leonard R. Petersen B.O. Himly M. Kaar W. Wopfner N. Kolarich D. van Ree R. Ebner C. Duus J.Ø. Ferreira F. Altmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7932-7940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and IgE immunoblot experiments using ragweed pollen extract revealed the presence of a glycoprotein similar in size and migrating with the same diffuse double band pattern as Art v 1 (1Oberhuber C. Ma Y. Wopfner N. Gadermaier G. Dedic A. Niggemann B. Maderegger B. Gruber P. Ferreira F. Scheiner O. Hoffmann-Sommergruber K. Int. Arch.

In this work, we describe the molecular cloning and structural characterization of the ragweed homologue of Art v 1. Furthermore, an initial assessment of the IgE binding capacity of this new ragweed allergen, designated as Amb a 4, with sera from ragweed and mugwort sensitized patients was performed. 5 g pollen of A. artemisiifolia (Allergon AB) were extracted for 15 min at room temperature with 120 ml of water. The extract was centrifuged, filtered, and mixed with 0.1 volumes of 0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer of pH 7.2. A CM-Sepharose column (1 × 18 cm, GE Healthcare) was equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and the extract was applied. Elution was performed with a 100-ml gradient from 0.02 to 0.3 m sodium phosphate. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE for the occurrence of a 30-kDa protein, which was shown to cross-react with a rabbit anti-Art v 1 serum available from a previous Art v 1 study (10Himly M.

Immunol. 2003; 111: 882-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In later purifications, Amb a 4 was identified via its N-terminal peptide KLCEKPSVTWSGK by tryptic digestion of 1% of each fraction and subsequent reversed phase-HPLC-ESI-MS as described (12Dragosits M.

Pooled fractions were subjected to size exclusion chromatography (Sephacryl S100 HR, GE Healthcare). Monosaccharide composition was determined after hydrolysis with 4 m trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 3 h by HPLC of 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone derivatives (13Altmann F. Lomonossoff G.P. J. Gen Virol. 2000; 81: 1111-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 14Fu D. O'Neill R.A. Anal.

Biochem. 1994; 220: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). From the same Amb a 4 preparation, amino acids were determined by HPLC of o-phthalaldehyde derivatives (16Altmann F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This allowed a correlation of sugar and protein content. For characterization of the polysaccharide moiety, the protein backbone was hydrolyzed with 0.22 m BaOH2 at 100 °C for 6 h (11Leonard R. Petersen B.O. Himly M. Kaar W. Wopfner N.

The alkaline hydrolyzate was neutralized with acetic acid and fractionated over Sephadex G15 using 1% acetic acid as the eluent. The void volume fraction was subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS on an Ultraflex TOF/TOF MS (Bruker) using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as matrix. Additionally, the samples were measured by off-line ESI-Q-TOF on a Q-TOF Ultima Global (Waters-Micromass) for MS/MS experiments. Alternatively, hydroxyproline (Hyp)-polysaccharide was subjected to reversed phase-LC-ESI-MS on an Aquastar C18 column (0.32 × 5 mm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using 0.1% formic acid in water and a gradient from 5 to 25% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The spray voltage was set to 3400 V, the RF lens value to 60 and the MS profile to 250/850/1450. Short arabinan chains linked to Hyp were detected by liquid-chromatography with mass spectrometric detection after alkaline hydrolysis of the protein (11Leonard R. Petersen B.O. Himly M. Kaar W.

Biochem. 1981; 115: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In this case, alkaline hydrolysis was followed by neutralization with sulfuric acid in the presence of sodium acetate buffer. After vacuum drying and dansylation of the Hyp-(Ara)n chains, the samples were subjected to porous graphitic carbon chromatography with MS detections using a 100 mm ammonia formate puffer of pH 9.0 and a 20-min acetonitrile gradient (14–38%). Mass spectrometric detection was done in positive ion mode on the Q-TOF instrument. A rabbit antiserum recognizing patches of β-arabinosyl residues was available from a previous Art v 1 study and used as described previously (11Leonard R. Petersen B.O. Himly M. Kaar W. Wopfner N.

Aspergillus niger α-arabinofuranosidase was purchased from Megazyme (Wicklow, Ireland). NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C in 5-mm tubes in a Cryo probe on a Bruker Avance 800 instrument at 799.3 MHz for proton and 200.98 MHz for carbon, using acetone as reference for proton (2.225 ppm) and 1,4-dioxane for carbon (67.4 ppm). Bruker standard programs cosydfphpr, noesyphpr (mixing time, 100 ms), mlevphpr (spinlock time, 80 ms), HSQC, HSQCTOCSY (spinlock time, 80 ms), HSQCNOESY (mixing time, 200 ms), HMBC, and H2BC were used with digital resolution in F2 dimension <2 Hz/pt (19Duus J. Gotfredsen C.H. Bock K. Chem. Rev. 2000; 100: 4589-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Processed spectra were assigned using the computer program PRONTO (20Kjaer M. Andersen K.V. Poulsen F.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 288-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). RNA from A. artemisiifolia young blossoms were extracted using SV total RNA isolation system (Promega) and used as template for cDNA synthesis by SuperScript III (Invitrogen). Based on the N-terminal sequence and tandem MS experiments, degenerated primers RhaAfor 5′-AARYTITGYGARAARCCIWSIGTNACNTGG-3′ and RhaArev 5′-GGRTTYTTNGTNGGRTCRCARTCRAAGTAGCA-3′ were designed.

Four distinct clones were obtained, corresponding to the plasmids pGEMT-RhaC1 to pGEMT-RhaC4 as they comprised only the C-terminal albeit largest part of the protein. To retrieve the authentic N-terminal nucleotide sequences, a 5′-RACE was performed (Smarter RACE cDNA amplification kit, Clontech). For this experiment, cDNA from flowers of 100 different ragweed plants was employed. The 5′-untranslated region of the new ragweed allergen was obtained by nested RACE-PCR with the primers CCGGAGGAGGCGGTCCATCACCTCCTTCGCCACCTGACGGAGGTGG and GGAGCAGGAGCCTTTCCCTTCGGGGCCCCTGGTGGCGGC. The 3′-untranslated region of ragweed allergen was obtained by a nested RACE PCR with the primers GCCGCCACCAGGGGCCCCGAAGGGAAAGGCTCCTGCTCC and CCACCTCCGTCAGGTGGCGAAGGAGGTGATGGACCGCCTCCTCCGG.

Clones were sequenced using a BIG Dye Termination Cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Predicted amino acid sequences were sorted with the help of MultAlign (21Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar). Using the forward primer Rha4forA (5′-AGTGCAAGGTGAAGCAGACCGATAAGTGTGACAAGCGGTG-3′) and Rha4revA (5′-GGAATTCCTCAACTTTTACCACCTCCTTCACC-3′) as reverse primer and the plasmid pGEMT-Rha4 (encoding Amb a 4 isoform 1) as a template, a fragment was amplified. Consecutively, PCR was performed with the forward primers Rha4forB (5′-TCCGTGACTTGGTCCGGCAAGTGCAAGGTGAAGCAGACC-3′), Rha4forC (5′-AAGCTGTGCGAGAAGCCGTCCGTGACTTGGTCCGGCA-3′) and Rha4forD (5′-GGGTACCAAGCTGTGCGAGAAGCCG-3′) in order to obtain a DNA encoding the complete allergen. The fragment was ligated into pET30a(+) (Novagen), and the resulting construct was transferred into Escherichia coli BL21 cells for expression. His-tagged recombinant Amb a 4 was purified with Ni-NTA agarose gel (Qiagen). Amb a 4 was further purified by reversed-phase HPLC with a C18 wide pore column (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm, 300-nm pore size, Phenomenex) using 0.05% TFA as starting solvent and a 5 to 35% acetonitrile gradient. Protein elution was monitored at 280 nm. Amino acids were determined using either o-phthaldehyde and 2-mercaptoethanol for primary amino acids or o-phthaldehyde, 3-mercaptopropionic acid and 9-fluorenylmethyl-chloroformate for secondary amino acids as described (16Altmann F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To obtain N-terminal sequence information purified natural Amb a 4 was separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinyl difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Bands were excised and sequenced on a Procise 491 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA), using the pulsed-liquid program. Internal peptide sequences were obtained from proteinase K peptides. The peptides were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC coupled to an ESI source and a Q-TOF hybrid mass spectrometer operating in the MS/MS mode as described recently (12Dragosits M. Stadlmann J. Albiol J. Baumann K. Maurer M. Gasser B. Sauer M. Altmann F. Ferrer P. Mattanovich D. J. Proteome Res. 2009; 8: 1380-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). C-terminal sequencing was attempted with carboxypeptidase Y (Sigma-Aldrich) in pyridine acetate buffer (22Winder J.S. Walker J.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 16: 313-318PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mass of native allergens was determined by MALDI-TOF-MS using a sinapinic acid matrix. Recombinant Amb a 4 was subjected to LC-ESI-MS via a Discovery® BIO Wide Pore C5 reversed-phase column (50 × 0.32 mm, 3 μm, Supelco) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min using 0.1% formic acid in water and a 10 to 50% acetonitrile gradient. The spray voltage was set to 3000 V, the RF lens value was set to 60, and the MS profile was set to 450/750/950. Deconvolution of spectra was performed with the MaxEnt1 procedure of MassLynx. Patients allergic to ragweed (and mugwort) were selected according to typical case history, positive skin prick test, and radioallergosorbent test classes >3.5. Eight sera were obtained from Canada (Dr. Alain Didierlaurent, Research Laboratory, Stallergenes S.A., Antony, France), 81 from Italy (Dr. Riccardo Asero, Ambulatorio di Allergologia, Clinica San Carlo, Paderno Dugnano, Italy), and 74 from Austria (Dr. Christof Ebner, Allergieambulatorium Reumannplatz, Vienna, Austria) and stored at −20 °C. Informed written consent was obtained from all subjects included in the study. For immunoblot analysis, crude ragweed pollen extract was electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Protran, Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) and incubated with patient IgE. Serum (0.6 ml) from an Austrian mugwort allergic patient was preincubated overnight with 0.00 μg, 0.01 μg, 0.10 μg, 1.00 μg, and 10.00 μg of natural Art v 1 and 10 μg recombinant Bet v 1 as a control. After an overnight incubation, the serum was added to the blotted membrane. Bound IgE antibodies were detected using 125I-labeled rabbit anti-human IgE (MALT Allergy system, IBL GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) on a phosphorimaging screen (Fujifilm BAS-1800 II, Tokyo, Japan). To detect whether mugwort or ragweed allergic sera reacted with Amb a 4, the IgE reactivity to the recombinant and natural allergen was measured. Maxisorp ELISA plates (NUNC, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with purified allergens (4 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween (TT buffer) and remaining binding sites were saturated by incubation with TT buffer plus 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature. Coated plates were incubated with patient sera overnight at 4 °C. All sera were diluted 1:3 in TT buffer plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin. After 5 TT buffer washes, plates were incubated (2 h at room temperature) with alkaline phosphatase conjugated monoclonal anti-human IgE antibodies (BD Biosciences) and developed with the substrate 4-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich). The optical density was measured at 405 nm, reference wavelength 492 nm, using a microplate reader (SLT Spectra 1.1, TECAN, Salzburg, Austria). Adequate ELISA controls, including omission of primary and/or secondary antibodies, were performed. The negative cut-off values were 0.2. For cross-inhibition experiments, recombinant Amb a 4 was coated to ELISA plates for inhibition experiments. In each case, six sera were used (four Austrian and two Canadian), diluted 1:5 and preincubated with increasing amounts of inhibitory proteins. Inhibition was performed at protein concentrations of 0.000, 0.002, 0.020, 0.200, and 2.000 μg/ml in 50 μl using natural and recombinant Art v 1. Proteins were incubated with patients IgE at 4 °C overnight. Values at protein concentration 0.000 μg/ml were used for data normalization. Separation of mugwort and ragweed pollen extracts by SDS-PAGE demonstrated a strong protein band of about the size of Art v 1 in ragweed pollen (Fig. 1A). Cross-reactivity between these bands of similar size was demonstrated using a patient reactive with mugwort pollen Art v 1 and its presumed ragweed homologue Amb a 4. Natural Art v 1 was able to inhibit binding of IgE to Amb a 4 in ragweed (Fig. 1B). Complete inhibition of IgE binding to Amb a 4 in ragweed pollen extract occurred only at higher Art v 1 concentrations (0.2 mg/ml), but partial inhibition was already observed at low protein concentrations. No inhibition was observed upon preincubation with recombinant Bet v 1 the major birch pollen allergen or with serum alone (Fig. 1B). Natural Amb a 4 was purified by cation-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography, similar to Art v 1. Initially the purification was monitored using sera of allergic patients. Further on, SDS-PAGE and LC-ESI-MS were used to detect the fractions containing the 30-kDa protein with the relevant N-terminal tryptic peptide. Purified natural Amb a 4 migrated on SDS-PAGE as one very diffuse band at ∼30 kDa but did not show the double band typical for natural Art v 1 (Fig. 2). In line with this observation, MALDI-TOF MS of Amb a 4 gave only one broad peak (Fig. 2). Amino acid analysis of Amb a 4 revealed an unusually high amount of glycine and proline residues, of which 78% were oxidized to Hyp. A parallel analysis of Art v 1 from mugwort revealed an even higher amount of 93% oxidized proline. Edman sequencing of the Art v 1 cross-reactive protein revealed the sequence of its first nineteen N-terminal residues as KLCEKPSVTWSGKCKVKQT. Sequence comparison revealed high homology to the defensin-like mugwort allergen Art v 1 and a protein from Helianthus annuus (Fig. 3). The predominating role of Art v 1 in mugwort allergy prompted us to investigate the molecular and immunological properties of its homologue in ragweed. Several attempts to obtain internal sequence information by mass spectrometric analysis of peptides digested with either trypsin, chymotrypsin, pepsin, or Pronase failed as well as RT-PCR amplification of Amb a 4 based on the N-terminal sequence. Finally, a proteinase K digest revealed the internal sequence CYFDCDPTKNPG. Its partial homology to Art v 1 and the sunflower protein P22357 indicated that this peptide originated from the C-terminal end of the allergens defensin domain (Fig. 3A). Next, degenerate primers were designed and, with the help of the already available 5′-primer a 49-bp nucleotide sequence could be cloned (Fig. 3B). Based on this sequence the cloning of the complete cDNA of Amb a 4 was accomplished with the exception of the 5′-end encoding the first 19 N-terminal amino acids as degenerate primers were used for this part. Four cDNA clones encoding three different protein sequences were obtained for the C-terminal part. Retrieval of the entire sequence of the allergen was hampered severely by the occurrence of large amounts of cDNA with some homology to our allergen but lacking the C-terminal Pro- and Gly-rich extension (data not shown). Such putative defensins are known from other plants, e.g. Arabidopsis. Finally, nested 5′-RACE based on the polyproline domain led to the amplification of the entire coding sequence of the allergen. 20 different cDNA clones were obtained from ∼50 colonies exemplifying a considerable genetic variability of this allergen. Knowing the possible protein sequences of Amb a 4 allowed us to re-evaluate the ESI-MS results. This retrieved the tryptic peptide CIEWEGAKHGACHKR, which, together with the already known two peptides, indicated isoforms 1, 3, and/or 4 to be a major variant on the protein level (Fig. 3C). A smaller signal for the N terminus of isoform 2 was found, whereas no indication for the presence of isoforms 5 to 9 in pollens was obtained. (Note that the cDNA was isolated from whole flowers.) Unfortunately, information on the C terminus of the protein could not be obtained, as no amino acids were released from Amb a 4 by carboxypeptidase Y even at a very high enzyme to substrate ratio, which may indicate an unidentified C-terminal modification. Also, trials to chemically deglycosylate Amb a 4 as done with Art v 1 inevitably led to degradation of the protein backbone and thus the actual size of the C-terminal moiety must remain elusive. Similarly, application of α-arabinofuranosidase as for Art v 1 (11Leonard R. Petersen B.O. Himly M. Kaar W. Wopfner N. Kolarich D. van Ree R. Ebner C. Duus J.Ø. Ferreira F. Altmann F. J. Biol.

Amb a 4 contained galactose and arabinose in a ratio of 1 to 24. A comparison of the results of amino acid and of monosaccharide analysis indicated a galactose content of 2.6 mol per mol protein (±20%). This translates into a carbohydrate mass of ∼6 kDa, which explains the large discrepancy between the theoretical mass of the polypeptide chains (12.6 to 13.5 kDa depending on isoform) and the results obtained by MALDI-TOF MS (∼18 ± 1 kDa) (Fig. 2). To detect whether Amb a 4 contained an arabinogalactan polysaccharide, the polymer fraction obtained upon alkaline digestion of Amb a 4 was analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. This identified a Hyp-linked polysaccharide containing 5 to more than 20 arabinose but only 1 galactose residue (Fig. 4A).

https://openalex.org/W2129669949,"Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes of the CYP101 and CYP111 families from the oligotrophic bacterium Novosphingobium aromaticivorans DSM12444 are heme monooxygenases that receive electrons from NADH via Arx, a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin, and ArR, a ferredoxin reductase. These systems show fast NADH turnovers (k(cat) = 39-91 s(-1)) that are efficiently coupled to product formation. The three-dimensional structures of ArR, Arx, and CYP101D1, which form a physiological class I P450 electron transfer chain, have been resolved by x-ray crystallography. The general structural features of these proteins are similar to their counterparts in other class I systems such as putidaredoxin reductase (PdR), putidaredoxin (Pdx), and CYP101A1 of the camphor hydroxylase system from Pseudomonas putida, and adrenodoxin (Adx) of the mitochondrial steroidogenic CYP11 and CYP24A1 systems. However, significant differences in the proposed protein-protein interaction surfaces of the ferredoxin reductase, ferredoxin, and P450 enzyme are found. There are regions of positive charge on the likely interaction face of ArR and CYP101D1 and a corresponding negatively charged area on the surface of Arx. The [2Fe-2S] cluster binding loop in Arx also has a neutral, hydrophobic patch on the surface. These surface characteristics are more in common with those of Adx than Pdx. The observed structural features are consistent with the ionic strength dependence of the activity."

This rule makes many simplifying assumptions, however, and does not accurately describe social evolution in organisms such as microbes where selection is both strong and nonadditive. We derived a generalization of Hamilton's rule and measured its parameters in Myxococcus xanthus bacteria. Nonadditivity made cooperative sporulation remarkably resistant to exploitation by cheater strains. Selection was driven by higher-order moments of population structure, not relatedness. These results provide an empirically testable cooperation principle applicable to both microbes and multicellular organisms and show how nonlinear interactions among cells insulate bacteria against cheaters."
https://openalex.org/W2169475091,"In vertebrate models of synaptic plasticity, signaling via the putative “retrograde messenger” nitric oxide (NO) has been hypothesized to serve as a critical link between functional and structural alterations at pre- and postsynaptic sites. In the present study, we show that auditory Pavlovian fear conditioning is associated with significant and long-lasting increases in the expression of the postsynaptically-localized protein GluR1 and the presynaptically-localized proteins synaptophysin and synapsin in the lateral amygdala (LA) within 24 hrs following training. Further, we show that rats given intra-LA infusion of either the NR2B-selective antagonist Ifenprodil, the NOS inhibitor 7-Ni, or the PKG inhibitor Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS exhibit significant decreases in training-induced expression of GluR1, synaptophysin, and synapsin immunoreactivity in the LA, while those rats infused with the PKG activator 8-Br-cGMP exhibit a significant increase in these proteins in the LA. In contrast, rats given intra-LA infusion of the NO scavenger c-PTIO exhibit a significant decrease in synapsin and synaptophysin expression in the LA, but no significant impairment in the expression of GluR1. Finally, we show that intra-LA infusions of the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 or the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 impair training-induced expression of GluR1, synapsin, and synaptophysin in the LA. These findings suggest that the NO-cGMP-PKG, Rho/ROCK, and CaMKII signaling pathways regulate fear memory consolidation, in part, by promoting both pre- and post-synaptic alterations at LA synapses. They further suggest that synaptic plasticity in the LA during auditory fear conditioning promotes alterations at presynaptic sites via NO-driven “retrograde signaling”."

https://openalex.org/W2072958840,"Heparan sulfates (HSs) modulate various developmental and homeostatic processes by binding to protein ligands. We have evaluated the structural characteristics of porcine HS in cellular signaling induced by basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2), using CHO745 cells devoid of endogenous glycosaminoglycans as target. Markedly enhanced stimulation of cell signaling, measured as phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and protein kinase B, was only observed with the shortest HS chains isolated from liver, whereas the longer chains from either liver or intestine essentially prolonged duration of signals induced by FGF2 in the absence of polysaccharide. Structural analysis showed that contiguous sulfated domains were most abundant in the shortest HS chains and were more heavily sulfated in HS from liver than in HS from intestine. Moreover, the shortest chains from either source entered into ternary complexes with FGF2 and FGF receptor-1c more efficiently than the corresponding longer chains. In addition to authentic HSs, decasaccharide libraries generated by chemo-enzymatic modification of heparin were probed for effect on FGF2 signaling. Only the most highly sulfated decamers, previously found most efficient in ternary complex formation (Jastrebova, N., Vanwildemeersch, M., Rapraeger, A. C., Giménez-Gallego, G., Lindahl, U., and Spillmann, D. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 26884-26892), promoted FGF2 cellular signaling as efficiently as short HS chains from liver. Together these results suggest that the effects of HS on FGF2 signaling are determined by both the structure of the highly sulfated domains and by the organization/availability of such domains within the HS chain. These findings underpin the need for regulation of HS biosynthesis in relation to control of growth factor-induced signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2001811190,"MicroRNAs (miRs) represent a class of endogenous approximately 18-25 nucleotide RNAs that regulate gene expression through translational repression by binding to a target mRNA. These miRs regulate several biological functions, such as cell growth, cell differentiation, carcinogenesis, and so on. In a previous report, we have indicated that miR-141 and -200a act as preosteoblast differentiation modulators. In the present study, using microRNA array and in silico analyses, we found that miR-208 is closely involved in preosteoblast differentiation by partially regulating the expression of Ets1 (V-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1), which transactivates osteopontin, runt-related transcription factor 2, parathyroid hormone-related protein, and type I procollagen. Furthermore, the enforced expression of mature miR-208 in murine preosteoblast in MC3T3-E1 cells or primary osteoblast cells remarkably attenuated BMP-2-induced preosteoblast differentiation. In addition, we determined that Ets1 is a target gene of miR-208 by using a sensor luciferase reporter assay. Taken together, these results suggest that the down-regulation of miR-208 in BMP-2-stimulated osteoblast differentiation is an important part of the regulatory machinery involved in early osteogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2036650959,"Background T cells producing multiple factors have been shown to be required for protection from disease progression in HIV but we have recently shown this not to be the case in TB. Subjects with active disease had a greater proportion of polyfunctional cells responding to ESAT-6/CFP-10 stimulation than their infected but non-diseased household contacts (HHC). We therefore wanted to assess this profile in subjects who had successfully completed standard TB chemotherapy. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study using PBMC from TB cases (pre- and post-treatment) and HHC. Samples were stimulated overnight with TB antigens (ESAT-6/CFP-10 and PPD) and their CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were assessed for production of CD107a, IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α and the complexity of the responses was determined using SPICE and PESTLE software. Results and Conclusions We found that an increase in complexity (i.e., production of more than 1 factor simultaneously) of the T cell profile was associated with TB disease and that this was significantly reduced following TB treatment. This implies that T cells are able to respond adequately to TB antigens with active disease (at least initially) but the ability of this response to protect the host from disease progression is hampered, presumably due to immune evasion strategies by the bacteria. These findings have implications for the development of new diagnostics and vaccine strategies."

This is the largest effect on Na+ affinity reported so far for any Na+,K+-ATPase mutant. D923N also affects the interaction with extracellular Na+ normally driving the E1P to E2P conformational transition backward.

Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was applied. For any choice of reaction path and rate constants, SimZyme solves the relevant differential equations using the fourth order Runge-Kutta numerical method and provides a graphical representation of the time dependence of the concentration of each of the reaction intermediates. The rate constants and initial concentrations of reaction intermediates providing the best fit to the experimental data points were determined by comparing computed time courses with the data points (see examples in supplemental Fig. S1). The structural model was created by substituting the relevant amino acid side chains of the Ca2+-ATPase in appropriate conformation (see the legend to Fig. 6) with those of the Na+,K+-ATPase followed by energy minimization and selection of appropriate rotamers of the inserted residues using the DeepView/Swiss-PdbViewer program (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics). The structure-based sequence alignment of the transmembrane region shown in supplemental Fig. S2 was used in the construction of the model. Structural figures were prepared using PyMol. This software was also used to make the structural alignment. Like the wild type enzyme, mutant D923N was capable of conferring ouabain resistance to the COS-1 cells, as evidenced by sustained cell viability in the presence of ouabain, thus indicating that D923N does transport Na+ and K+ across the membrane at a certain rate. Measurement of the maximal amount of acid-stable phosphoenzyme intermediate formed from [γ-32P]ATP (“active-site concentration” (19Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13312-13324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)) on the isolated plasma membrane fraction showed that D923N is well expressed at a level above wild type (ratio between mutant and wild type active-site concentrations 1.7 ± 0.23, n = 13). The catalytic turnover rate (Na+,K+-ATPase activity per active site) determined at 130 mm Na+, 20 mm K+, and 3 mm MgATP was, on the other hand, reduced by no less than 90% in D923N (843 ± 27 min−1 (n = 10) versus 8199 ± 209 min−1 in wild type (n = 10)). Taken together, these results show that the RDP mutation does not prevent the biogenesis and plasma membrane targeting of Na+,K+-ATPase but, rather, interferes with its function. It is generally believed that Na+,K+-ATPase exchanges three intracellular Na+ ions for two extracellular K+ ions in a consecutive mechanism, where Na+ triggers phosphorylation from ATP by binding at internally facing sites, and K+ activates dephosphorylation by binding at externally facing sites, cf. Scheme 1 (24Albers R.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1967; 36: 727-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 25Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol.

At the internal sites K+ inhibits by binding in competition with Na+, whereas Na+ inhibits at the external sites by binding in competition with K+. Examination of the Na+ dependence of ATPase activity in the presence of K+ (Na+,K+-ATPase activity) showed a significant reduction of the apparent affinity for Na+ activation in the D923N mutant as compared with wild type (Fig. 1A). The mutation furthermore caused a shift toward higher Na+ concentrations of the inhibition of ATPase activity resulting from Na+ interaction with externally facing low affinity sites. By fitting a function consisting of two Hill components, one corresponding to the rising phase and the other corresponding to the inhibition phase, a ∼25-fold reduction of the Na+ affinity for activation of ATPase activity and a ∼1.7-fold reduction of the Na+ affinity for inhibition was revealed. To determine the Na+ affinity of the internal sites without interference from K+, the Na+ dependence of phosphorylation from ATP was examined in the absence of K+ and presence of oligomycin to stabilize the phosphoenzyme (25Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Glynn I.M. J. Physiol. 1993; 462: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 27Fahn S. Koval G.J. Albers R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1993-2002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1B, D923N exhibited a most conspicuous 216-fold reduction of Na+ affinity relative to wild type in the phosphorylation assay. To examine whether the reduction of apparent Na+ affinity at the internal activating sites is caused by a shift of the E1-E2 conformational equilibrium away from the Na+ binding E1 form toward the K+ binding E2 form, we determined the apparent affinity for vanadate, which can be used for probing the E1-E2 distribution because it binds to E2 and not to E1. As evident from Fig. 1C, the apparent affinity for vanadate inhibition was reduced (K0.5 increased) by around 9-fold in D923N relative to wild type, showing that the RDP mutation actually favors the Na+-binding E1 state. Altogether, these data indicate a direct effect of mutation D923N on the true Na+ affinity of the internal Na+ sites of the E1 form. Oligomycin allows the phosphoenzyme to build up to a maximum level due to inhibition of the conversion of E1P to E2P and the promotion of Na+ occlusion in E1P, cf. Scheme 1 (25Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Glynn I.M. J. Physiol. 1993; 462: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 27Fahn S. Koval G.J.

The Rockefeller University Press, New York1991: 317-319Google Scholar). Fig. 1D shows the steady-state level of phosphoenzyme reached in the absence of oligomycin (EP) relative to that reached in its presence (EPmax). For the wild type, the EP/EPmax ratio was 84%, whereas it was reduced to 56% in D923N. The lower EP/EPmax ratio in the mutant may indicate that Na+ interaction is even more defective in the absence of oligomycin than in its presence. Moreover, an increased phosphoenzyme turnover rate in the absence of oligomycin (see further below) may contribute to lower the EP/EPmax ratio in the mutant. Fig. 2A displays the K+ dependence of the ATPase activity at Na+ concentrations of 40 and 400 mm. K+ exerts two different effects; (i) binding from the external side with high affinity to E2P, K+ triggers rapid dephosphorylation, and (ii) binding from the internal side with low affinity to E1 in competition with Na+, K+ inhibits phosphorylation and, thus, ATP hydrolysis. At 40 mm Na+, both the activation phase and the inhibition phase could be distinguished for the wild type as well as the mutant; however, the inhibition at high K+ concentrations was much more pronounced in the mutant, consistent with the marked reduction of the affinity for Na+ at the internal sites described above. As the Na+ concentration was raised 10-fold to 400 mm, the inhibition phase was reduced markedly, reflecting the increased Na+/K+ ratio at the internal sites. At both Na+ concentrations, the apparent affinity for K+ activation at the external sites, determined from the rising phase of the curves, was slightly higher in the mutant than in the wild type (2–3-fold). Because this could be an indirect consequence of a change in a reaction step preceding or subsequent to the binding step, the K+ binding properties of the external sites on E2P were assessed more directly by determining the rate of E2P dephosphorylation at a non-saturating and a saturating K+ concentration (Fig. 2B). The ratio between the dephosphorylation rates at 1 and 20 mm K+ did not differ significantly between mutant and wild type (26 versus 31%), showing that their intrinsic affinities for external K+ are quite similar. The decay of the phosphoenzyme was furthermore examined at 20 and 600 mm Na+ in the absence of K+ after phosphorylation at 150 mm Na+ (Fig. 3). At the lower Na+ concentration (open triangles), the spontaneous dephosphorylation was rather slow for both mutant and wild type. The slightly higher rate of the mutant may be explained by a higher amount of E2P accumulated during the phosphorylation (see below and Table 1). In the absence of K+, Na+ at a high concentration has dual effects on dephosphorylation in the wild type; (i) Na+, bound with low affinity at the external sites of E2P, is able to mimic K+, thus activating dephosphorylation to some extent and being transported toward the cytoplasmic side at a stoichiometry of two Na+ per ATP hydrolyzed (30Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7948-7953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Yoda A. Yoda S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 110-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and (ii) Na+ bound at an external site(s) reverses the E1P → E2P conformational transition, promoting accumulation of E1P (32Kaplan J.H. Hollis R.J. Nature. 1980; 288: 587-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 33Yoda S. Yoda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1147-1152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the wild type the net result of these two opposite effects is that the rate of dephosphorylation is higher at 600 mm Na+ compared with 20 mm Na+. However, the acceleration of dephosphorylation by Na+ at high concentrations was found considerably more pronounced for the D923N mutant than for the wild type (Fig. 3, open circles). To explore which partial reaction step(s) is responsible for this difference, we examined the effect of ADP on the rate of phosphoenzyme decay in the presence of 600 mm Na+. ADP dephosphorylates E1P, forming ATP, whereas E2P dephosphorylates only by hydrolysis activated by K+ or high Na+. It is seen in Fig. 3 (filled circles) that the ADP-induced acceleration of dephosphorylation was less pronounced in the mutant as compared with the wild type. Hence, the difference between the phosphoenzyme decay rates with and without ADP was much smaller for D923N than for the wild type. This observation suggested that 600 mm Na+ is less capable of driving the E1P → E2P transition backwards in the mutant. To further substantiate the latter hypothesis, we used the simulation software SimZyme (23Sorensen T.L. Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) to perform a series of computations of predicted dephosphorylation time courses for various assumptions regarding the rate constants of interconversion of E1P and E2P and dephosphorylation of E2P (see supplemental Fig. S1 for illustration of some of the computations). These computer simulations revealed that all the data in Fig. 3 are compatible with the model described in Table 1 (generating the lines in Fig. 3) in which the only difference between the dephosphorylation characteristics of mutant and wild type is a reduced ability of the mutant to interact with Na+ at the external low affinity site(s) responsible for driving the E1P → E2P transition backward. Hence, the dephosphorylation time courses observed in the presence of 600 mm Na+ with and without ADP are compatible with a 14-fold reduced rate constant of the backward conversion of E2P to E1P in the mutant relative to wild type. Furthermore, the analysis indicates that during the initial incubation with ATP at 150 mm Na+ to form the phosphoenzyme, more E2P accumulates in the D923N mutant as compared with wild type (85% versus 50%, Table 1) as a consequence of a reduced rate constant of the backward conversion of E2P to E1P in the mutant. The higher amount of E2P initially present in the mutant also explains the slight difference between the phosphoenzyme decay rates of mutant and wild type seen when the enzyme phosphorylated at 150 mm Na+ is diluted, allowing dephosphorylation to take place at 20 mm Na+ (Fig. 3, open triangles). The reduced ability of Na+ to drive the E1P → E2P transition backward in the mutant can be explained by assuming that mutation D923N not only interferes with the binding of Na+ from the intracellular side of the membrane but also to some extent with the binding of extracellular Na+. Besides it is worth noting that the model fitting the data does not imply any difference between mutant and wild type with respect to the rate constant of E2P dephosphorylation. The latter increases with increasing Na+ concentration from 0.07 s−1 at 20 mm Na+ to 0.4 s−1 at 600 mm Na+, thus reflecting that Na+ at a high concentration binds in place of K+ and activates E2P dephosphorylation to the same extent in mutant and wild ty"

This study isolated a novel GP-PDE, GDE5, and showed that GDE5 selectively hydrolyzes glycerophosphocholine (GroPCho) and controls skeletal muscle development. We show that GDE5 expression was reduced in atrophied skeletal muscles in mice and that decreasing GDE5 abundance promoted myoblastic differentiation, suggesting that decreased GDE5 expression has a counter-regulatory effect on the progression of skeletal muscle atrophy. Forced expression of full-length GDE5 in cultured myoblasts suppressed myogenic differentiation. Unexpectedly, a truncated GDE5 construct (GDE5ΔC471), which contained a GP-PDE sequence identified in other GP-PDEs but lacked GroPCho phosphodiesterase activity, showed a similar inhibitory effect. Furthermore, transgenic mice specifically expressing GDE5ΔC471 in skeletal muscle showed less skeletal muscle mass, especially type II fiber-rich muscle. These results indicate that GDE5 negatively regulates skeletal muscle development even without GroPCho phosphodiesterase activity, providing novel insight into the biological significance of mammalian GP-PDE function in a non-enzymatic mechanism.

IntroductionThe mass and composition of skeletal muscle are closely associated with its physiological functions, such as exercise, energy expenditure, and glucose metabolism (1Zurlo F. Larson K. Bogardus C. Ravussin E. J. Clin. Investig. 1990; 86: 1423-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 2Berchtold M.W. Brinkmeier H. Müntener M. Physiol.

Progressive muscle loss, frequently caused by diabetes, obesity, and decreased physical activity (sarcopenia), is a major health problem in our aging society (3Proctor D.N Balagopal P Nair K.S J. Nutr. 1998; 128: S351-S355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the search for clues as to the regulation of skeletal muscle mass and composition during physical exercise and muscular atrophy caused by disease and disuse, a number of metabolites have been investigated in adult skeletal muscles. In human and mouse skeletal muscle tissues, deacylated glycerophospholipids, the glycerophosphodiesters (GPs), 3The abbreviations used are: GPglycerophosphodiesterGP-PDEglycerophosphodiester phosphodiesteraseGroPInsglycerophosphoinositolGroPChoglycerophosphocholineESTexpressed sequence tagG3Pglycerol 3-phosphateMBPmaltose-binding protein. were analyzed as phosphate-containing compounds, and interestingly, the amounts of skeletal muscle GPs are reportedly altered in response to physical activity, the environment, and pathological conditions (4Burt C.T.

However, the biological functions of skeletal muscle GPs and the physiological regulation of their levels have not been studied to date.The GPs (primarily glycerophosphoinositol and glycerophosphocholine) are cellular products of phospholipase activities on membrane phospholipids. GP intracellular concentrations vary with oncogenic transformation, cell differentiation, and environmental stimuli, and they are thought to be tightly controlled for the balance between synthesis and degradation (7Baburina I.

Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases (GP-PDEs), GlpQ and UgpQ, were identified as periplasmic and cytosolic proteins that have essential roles in the hydrolysis of GPs to glycerol 3-phosphate and alcohol, which are used as major sources of carbon and phosphate (10Larson T.J.

In contrast, three mammalian GP-PDEs, GDE1, GDE2, and GDE3, were previously identified and presumed to have distinct physiological functions (12Zheng B. Chen D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In initial studies, GDE1 (also known as MIR16) was isolated as a unique membrane protein that interacted with RGS16, a regulator of G-protein signaling (12Zheng B. Chen D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 3999-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and it has been shown to preferentially hydrolyze glycerophosphoinositol (GroPIns) in response to β-adrenergic stimulation (16Zheng B. Berrie C.P. Corda D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 1745-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Studies on GDE2 show that retinoic acid-induced expression of GDE2 has critical roles in neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth of motor neurons (15Rao M. Sockanathan S. Science. 2005; 309: 2212-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Yanaka Y. Nogusa N. Fujioka Y. Yamashita Y. Kato N. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 712-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is reported that GDE3 is regulated during osteoblast development and induces osteoblast differentiation and morphological changes in cultured mammalian cells (13Yanaka N. Imai Y. Kawai E. Akatsuka H. Wakimoto K. Nogusa Y. Kato N. Chiba H. Kotani E. Omori K. Sakurai N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43595-43602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, our recent study demonstrates that GDE3 is a GroPIns phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes GroPIns to glycerol and inositol 1-phosphate, unlike the bacterial GP-PDEs and GDE1 (18Corda D.

In mammalian cells, GroPIns is being increasingly recognized as an important intracellular messenger that is involved in various cellular signaling pathways such as cell proliferation, transformation, and differentiation (9Corda D.

Although these observations strongly suggest a central role of mammalian GP-PDEs in regulating intracellular GP concentrations, previous reports on the existence of proteins that interact with mammalian GP-PDEs, such as RGS16, PRAF2 (also known as JM4), and Prdx1 (12Zheng B.

Cell. 2009; 138: 1209-1221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), have prompted us to consider that GP-PDEs might also act via a non-enzymatic mechanism. Thus, mammalian GP-PDEs are most likely involved in a variety of cellular events (22Yanaka N. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2007; 71: 1811-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, at the molecular level, their potential roles remain unclear, including the control of intracellular GP levels and other possible unknown effects.As the characterization of these unidentified GP-PDEs will be highly informative for understanding their molecular basis, we explored novel mammalian GP-PDE cDNAs using sections of the GP-PDE sequence to locate expressed sequence tags (ESTs). For this study, we focused on a cDNA termed GDE5, showing that GDE5 is a novel glycerophosphocholine (GroPCho) phosphodiesterase and also that GDE5 has an inhibitory role in skeletal muscle differentiation that is carried out independently of its GroPCho enzymatic activity.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have shown that a novel cytosolic GP-PDE, GDE5, selectively hydrolyzes GroPCho. To date, GP-PDEs have been found widely in bacteria, yeast, plants, and mammals. However, different physiological roles among the GP-PDEs have been discussed (10Larson T.J. Ehrmann M. Boos W. J.

Previous studies have examined several types of glycerophosphodiesters (derived from glycerophospholipids) as substrates for bacteria GP-PDEs and demonstrated that the bacterial enzymes show broad substrate specificities toward glycerophosphodiesters (10Larson T.J.

In contrast, an intriguing feature of mammalian GP-PDEs is that these enzymes show restricted substrate specificities, strongly suggesting the physiological roles of mammalian GP-PDEs as a determinant for GroPIns or GroPCho levels in mammalian cells. GroPIns has been shown to be involved in the control of cell proliferation, cell chemotaxis, and cell morphology, affecting in the last case actin cytoskeletal rearrangements through the activation of small GTPases of the Rho family (9Corda D.

Burg M.B. Physiology. 2009; 24: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 36Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1995; 268: F983-F996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Gallazzini M.

A recent study suggests that GDE2 contributes to osmotic regulation as a GroPCho phosphodiesterase (38Gallazzini M. Ferraris J.D. Burg M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 11026-11031Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This study shows that GDE5 can hydrolyze GroPCho preferentially, suggesting that this novel cytosolic GP-PDE has a role in maintaining the intracellular osmotic balance by regulating intracellular GroPCho.In the present study, we have demonstrated that GDE5 inhibits skeletal muscle differentiation. It is puzzling that GDE5 mRNA expression in skeletal muscle was down-regulated in several types of skeletal muscle atrophies. As previous studies have suggested functional adaptations of skeletal muscle during denervation, disuse, and aging (39Evans W.J. Am J. Clin. Nutr. 2010; 91: 1123S-1127SCrossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), the decreased GDE5 expression might represent an adaptation response to counteract the pathology. Further, we have shown that the GDE5 inhibitory role is not due to its GroPCho phosphodiesterase activity. Previous studies using yeast two-hybrid systems have shown that mammalian GP-PDEs have the potential to interact with intracellular proteins (12Zheng B. Chen D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 3999-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20Bachmann A.S. Duennebier F.F. Mocz G. Gene. 2006; 371: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Yan et al. (21Yan Y. Sabharwal P. Rao M. Sockanathan S. Cell. 2009; 138: 1209-1221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) recently described a remarkable characteristic of a mammalian GP-PDE, namely, that GDE2 interacts with the antioxidant scavenger peroxiredoxin1 (Prdx1) and cooperates with Prdx1 to drive neuronal differentiation. These observations suggested that mammalian GP-PDEs coordinate intracellular proteins in the control of cellular events. Further studies, which should include the isolation of molecules that interact with GDE5ΔC471, will be necessary to determine the mechanism of action (and other potential functions) of GDE5.We created transgenic mice specifically expressing GDE5ΔC471 in skeletal muscle and showed that GDE5ΔC471 mice have less type II fiber-rich muscle mass. Previous animal studies have defined the pattern of transcriptional changes in skeletal muscle in pathological and physiological states. Increased mRNA expression of several genes involved in neuromuscular interactions in GDE5ΔC471 skeletal muscle is similar to the multiple types of skeletal muscle atrophy characterized by structural alterations of the neuromuscular junctions (40Kang H. Tian L. Son Y.J. Zuo Y. Procaccino D. Love F. Hayworth C. Trachtenberg J. Mikesh M. Sutton L. Ponomareva O. Mignone J. Enikolopov G. Rimer M. Thompson W. J.

Muscle Nerve. 2008; 38: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Moreover, as shown in Table 3, it is worth noting that the mRNA expression of genes encoding the polyamine biosynthetic enzymes spermine oxidase and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylases was decreased in the GDE5ΔC471 muscle. Previous studies have demonstrated that androgen hormones and/or physical exercise influence polyamine metabolism in skeletal muscle (42Turchanowa L. Rogozkin V.A. Milovic V. Feldkoren B.I. Caspary W.F. Stein J. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 30: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 43MacLean H.E. Chiu W.S. Notini A.J. Axell A.M. Davey R.A. McManus J.F. Ma C. Plant D.R. Lynch G.S. Zajac J.D. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 2676-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that down-regulation of polyamine synthesis is involved in the pathologic process in GDE5ΔC471 skeletal muscle. In most types of skeletal muscle atrophy, such as disuse and denervation, the overall rates of protein synthesis are suppressed and the rates of protein degradation are consistently elevated; this response accounts for the majority of the rapid loss of muscle protein (44Glass D.J.

Cell Physiol. 2004; 287: C834-C843Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). In animal models (e.g. denervation and immobilization), most of the accelerated proteolysis in skeletal muscle appears to be due to an activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, accompanied by significant increases in mRNA levels of the ubiquitin ligase genes Atrogin-1/MAFbx, MuRF-1, and Cbl-b, which are rate-limiting enzymes in the protein-ubiquitin system (46Lecker S.H.

In GDE5ΔC471 mice, mRNA levels for genes encoding enzymes involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and certain proteasome subunits did not differ from the controls, suggesting that protein degradation of skeletal muscle is not involved in the pathology of GDE5ΔC471 muscles. Of interest, this in vivo study demonstrated that the mRNA expression of a variety of secreted proteins, such as antimicrobial α-defensins and Reg members, is up-regulated in GDE5ΔC471 muscle. Recent studies have demonstrated novel biological roles of α-defensins in fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis, via the β-catenin signaling pathway, and in the suppression of hepatic glucose production, through a mechanism distinct from the classical insulin signaling pathway (49Liu H.Y.

Mohammed K.A. Su Y. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 6603-6614Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As noted also, we have shown that white adipose tissue weights of 1-year-old GDE5ΔC471 mice were increased as compared with age-matched controls (supplemental Table S1), suggesting that the secreted proteins from skeletal muscle of the GDE5ΔC471 mice can modulate white adipose tissue functions and mass with aging. Furthermore, Livesey et al. (51Livesey F.J. O'Brien J.A. Li M. Smith A.G. Murphy L.J. Hunt S.P. Nature. 1997; 390: 614-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) showed that Reg2 (regenerating islet-derived 2) is a potent Schwann cell mitogen involved in motor neuron regeneration and development. Thus, GDE5ΔC471 mice not only will contribute to an understanding of the in vivo functions of GDE5 via a non-enzymatic mechanism, but they will also be available as a novel animal model of type II fiber-rich skeletal muscle diseases that can be used to screen for new myokines in skeletal muscles.In summary, this study provides a new insight into the role of mammalian GP-PDEs, independent of their enzymatic activity. It also has prompted us to further consider the evolutionary differences between and biological significance of prokaryotic and mammalian GP-PDEs at the molecular level. IntroductionThe mass and composition of skeletal muscle are closely associated with its physiological functions, such as exercise, energy expenditure, and glucose metabolism (1Zurlo F. Larson K. Bogardus C. Ravussin E. J. Clin. Investig. 1990; 86: 1423-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 2Berchtold M.W. Brinkmeier H. Müntener M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1215-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Progressive muscle loss, frequently caused by diabetes, obesity, and decreased physical activity (sarcopenia), is a major health problem in our aging society (3Proctor D.N Balagopal P Nair K.S J. Nutr. 1998; 128: S351-S355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the search for clues as to the regulation of skeletal muscle mass and composition during physical exercise and muscular atrophy caused by disease and disuse, a number of metabolites have been investigated in adult skeletal muscles. In human and mouse skeletal muscle tissues, deacylated glycerophospholipids, the glycerophosphodiesters (GPs), 3The abbreviations used are: GPglycerophosphodiesterGP-PDEglycerophosphodiester phosphodiesteraseGroPInsglycerophosphoinositolGroPChoglycerophosphocholineESTexpressed sequence tagG3Pglycerol 3-phosphateMBPmaltose-binding protein. were analyzed as phosphate-containing compounds, and interestingly, the amounts of skeletal muscle GPs are reportedly altered in response to physical activity, the environment, and pathological conditions (4Burt C.T. Glonek T. Bárány M. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4850-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 5Younkin D.P. Berman P. Sladky J. Chee C. Bank W. Chance B.

Rheumatology. 2000; 39: 1121-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, the biological functions of skeletal muscle GPs and the physiological regulation of their levels have not been studied to date.The GPs (primarily glycerophosphoinositol and glycerophosphocholine) are cellular products of phospholipase activities on membrane phospholipids. GP intracellular concentrations vary with oncogenic transformation, cell differentiation, and environmental stimuli, and they are thought to be tightly controlled for the balance between synthesis and degradation (7Baburina I.

Life Sci. 2009; 66: 3449-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For GP hydrolysis, two bacterial enzymes have been isolated and studied in depth at the molecular level. Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases (GP-PDEs), GlpQ and UgpQ, were identified as periplasmic and cytosolic proteins that have essential roles in the hydrolysis of GPs to glycerol 3-phosphate and alcohol, which are used as major sources of carbon and phosphate (10Larson T.J.

Mol Gen Genet. 1991; 226: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast, three mammalian GP-PDEs, GDE1, GDE2, and GDE3, were previously identified and presumed to have distinct physiological functions (12Zheng B. Chen D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In initial studies, GDE1 (also known as MIR16) was isolated as a unique membrane protein that interacted with RGS16, a regulator of G-protein signaling (12Zheng B. Chen D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 3999-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and it has been shown to preferentially hydrolyze glycerophosphoinositol (GroPIns) in response to β-adrenergic stimulation (16Zheng B. Berrie C.P. Corda D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 1745-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Studies on GDE2 show that retinoic acid-induced expression of GDE2 has critical roles in neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth of motor neurons (15Rao M. Sockanathan S. Science. 2005; 309: 2212-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Yanaka Y. Nogusa N. Fujioka Y. Yamashita Y. Kato N. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 712-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is reported that GDE3 is regulated during osteoblast development and induces osteoblast differentiation and morphological changes in cultured mammalian cells (13Yanaka N. Imai Y. Kawai E. Akatsuka H. Wakimoto K. Nogusa Y. Kato N. Chiba H. Kotani E. Omori K. Sakurai N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43595-43602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, our recent study demonstrates that GDE3 is a GroPIns phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes GroPIns to glycerol and inositol 1-phosphate, unlike the bacterial GP-PDEs and GDE1 (18Corda D.

In mammalian cells, GroPIns is being increasingly recognized as an important intracellular messenger that is involved in various cellular signaling pathways such as cell proliferation, transformation, and differentiation (9Corda D.

Although these observations strongly suggest a central role of mammalian GP-PDEs in regulating intracellular GP concentrations, previous reports on the existence of proteins that interact with mammalian GP-PDEs, such as RGS16, PRAF2 (also known as JM4), and Prdx1 (12Zheng B. Chen D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 3999-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20Bachmann A.S. Duennebier F.F. Mocz G.

Thus, mammalian GP-PDEs are most likely involved in a variety of cellular events (22Yanaka N. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2007; 71: 1811-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, at the molecular level, their potential roles remain unclear, including the control of intracellular GP levels and other possible unknown effects.As the characterization of these unidentified GP-PDEs will be highly informative for understanding their molecular basis, we explored novel mammalian GP-PDE cDNAs using sections of the GP-PDE sequence to locate expressed sequence tags (ESTs). For this study, we focused on a cDNA termed GDE5, showing that GDE5 is a novel glycerophosphocholine (GroPCho) phosphodiesterase and also that GDE5"

Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) given alone or in combination with other drugs has been used for most IPT programmes. However, SP resistance is increasing in many parts of Africa. Thus, we have investigated whether SP plus AQ, SP plus piperaquine (PQ) and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) plus PQ might be equally safe and effective when used for IPT in children in an area of seasonal transmission. Methods During the 2007 malaria transmission season, 1008 Gambian children were individually randomized to receive SP plus amodiaquine (AQ), SP plus piperaquine (PQ) or dihydroartemisinin (DHA) plus PQ at monthly intervals on three occasions during the peak malaria transmission season. To determine the risk of side effects following drug administration, participants in each treatment group were visited at home three days after the start of each round of drug administration and a side effects questionnaire completed. To help establish whether adverse events were drug related, the same questionnaire was administered to 286 age matched control children recruited from adjacent villages. Morbidity was monitored throughout the malaria transmission season and study children were seen at the end of the malaria transmission season. Results All three treatment regimens showed good safety profiles. No severe adverse event related to IPT was reported. The most frequent adverse events reported were coughing, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain and loss of appetite. Cough was present in 15.2%, 15.4% and 18.7% of study subjects who received SP plus AQ, DHA plus PQ or SP plus PQ respectively, compared to 19.2% in a control group. The incidence of malaria in the DHA plus PQ, SP plus AQ and SP plus PQ groups were 0.10 cases per child year (95% CI: 0.05, 0.22), 0.06 (95% CI: 0.022, 0.16) and 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.15) respectively. The incidence of malaria in the control group was 0.79 cases per child year (0.58, 1.08).

https://openalex.org/W2025066195,"Patients carrying mutations within the amyloid-beta (Abeta) sequence develop severe early-onset cerebral amyloid angiopathy with some of the related variants manifesting primarily with hemorrhagic phenotypes. Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) are typically associated with blood brain barrier disruption and hemorrhagic transformations after ischemic stroke. However, their contribution to cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related hemorrhage remains unclear. Human brain endothelial cells challenged with Abeta synthetic homologues containing mutations known to be associated in vivo with hemorrhagic manifestations (AbetaE22Q and AbetaL34V) showed enhanced production and activation of MMP-2, evaluated via Multiplex MMP antibody arrays, gel zymography, and Western blot, which in turn proteolytically cleaved in situ the Abeta peptides. Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry analysis highlighted the generation of specific C-terminal proteolytic fragments, in particular the accumulation of Abeta-(1-16), a result validated in vitro with recombinant MMP-2 and quantitatively evaluated using deuterium-labeled internal standards. Silencing MMP-2 gene expression resulted in reduced Abeta degradation and enhanced apoptosis. Secretion and activation of MMP-2 as well as susceptibility of the Abeta peptides to MMP-2 degradation were dependent on the peptide conformation, with fibrillar elements of AbetaE22Q exhibiting negligible effects. Our results indicate that MMP-2 release and activation differentially degrades Abeta species, delaying their toxicity for endothelial cells. However, taking into consideration MMP ability to degrade basement membrane components, these protective effects might also undesirably compromise blood brain barrier integrity and precipitate a hemorrhagic phenotype."

However, the mechanisms for the binding of LBR with importin β and the membrane targeting by LBR in NE assembly remain largely unknown. In this report, we show that the amino acids (aa) 69–90 of LBR sequences are required to bind with importin β at aa 45–462, and the binding is essential for the NE membrane precursor vesicle targeting to the chromatin during the NE assembly at the end of mitosis. We also show that this binding is cell cycle-regulated and dependent on the phosphorylation of LBR Ser-71 by p34cdc2 kinase. RNAi knockdown of LBR causes the NE assembly failure and abnormal chromatin decondensation of the daughter cell nuclei, leading to the daughter cell death at early G1 phase by apoptosis. Perturbation of the interaction of LBR with importin β by deleting the LBR N-terminal spanning region or aa 69–73 also induces the NE assembly failure, the abnormal chromatin decondensation, and the daughter cell death. The first transmembrane domain of LBR promotes the NE production and expansion, because overexpressing this domain is sufficient to induce membrane overproduction of the NE. Thus, these results demonstrate that LBR targets the membrane precursor vesicles to chromatin by interacting with importin β in a LBR phosphorylation-dependent manner during the NE assembly at the end of mitosis and that the first transmembrane domain of LBR promotes the LBR-bearing membrane production and the NE expansion in interphase.

Conversion between these two states and the assembly or disassembly of the effector complexes requires the interaction of regulator proteins, the nucleus-based guanine nucleotide exchange factor RCC1 and the cytoplasm-localized GTPase-activating protein RanGAP1 (6Clarke P.R.

The compartmentalization of the regulators produces a high concentration gradient of Ran-GTP in the nucleus and Ran-GDP in the cytoplasm. In mitosis, after the NE breakdown, the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm are mixed; Ran diffuses into the cytoplasm with many other soluble nuclear proteins; RCC1 dynamically binds with the mitotic chromosomes and promotes the establishment of a concentration gradient of Ran-GTP/GDP where it is found at highest near the chromosomes and lowest at the centrosomes. During the NE assembly at the end of mitosis, Ran rebinds the chromatin and regulates the NE assembly, which depends on its GTPase cycle and its regulators (6Clarke P.R. Zhang C. Nat. Rev. Mol.

For example, importin β depletion in Xenopus egg extracts blocks the NE assembly, whereas adding back exogenous importin β rescues the NE formation in an appropriate concentration-dependent manner (8Zhang C.

Moreover, importin β-coated beads alone could induce the NE assembly in Xenopus egg extracts under the regulation of Ran (8Zhang C. Hutchins J.R. Mühlhäusser P. Kutay U. Clarke P.R. Curr.

Galy V. Hannak E. Mattaj I.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4355-4370Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that importin β plays a crucial role in the recruitment of the lamin B receptor (LBR)-bearing NE precursor membrane vesicles to the chromatin surface and the NE assembly through a direct interaction with the N-terminal spanning domain of LBR at amino acids (aa) 45–90 (15Ma Y. Cai S. Lv Q. Jiang Q. Zhang Q. Sodmergen Zhai Z. Zhang C. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 520-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these activities were carried out in a Ran-sensitive and importin α-independent manner (15Ma Y. Cai S. Lv Q. Jiang Q. Zhang Q. Sodmergen Zhai Z. Zhang C. J.

The interaction of LBR with HP1 may not be direct, but is mediated through the core histones H3/H4 (31Polioudaki H. Kourmouli N. Drosou V. Bakou A. Theodoropoulos P.A. Singh P.B. Giannakouros T. Georgatos S.D. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 920-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The N-terminal spanning region of LBR contains a conserved arginine/serine (RS)-rich region, which may be phosphorylated on some serine and threonine residues by multiple RS kinases in a cell-cycle-dependent manner (32Nikolakaki E.

Dreger C.K. Olins A.L. Olins D.E. Shultz L.D. Lucke B. Karl H. Kaps R. Müller D. Vayá A. Aznar J. Ware R.E. Sotelo Cruz N. Lindner T.H. Herrmann H. Reis A. Sperling K. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The large middle part from aa 211–615 of the LBR houses the 8 transmembrane domains. The first transmembrane domain, but not the others, is critical for confining this protein to the inner nuclear membrane (39Smith S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). During the NE assembly at the end of mitosis, it is found that LBR plays a central role in targeting the NE precursor membrane vesicles to the chromatin mediated by importins. Overexpression of LBR in yeast cells induces over-generation of membrane and formation of membrane stacks in the cytoplasm (40Smith S. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 10124-10128Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In sea urchins, LBR is required for targeting the LBR-bearing membrane vesicles to the chromatin and the NE assembly during male pronuclear formation (41Collas P. Courvalin J.C. Poccia D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1715-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In culture cells, LBR fused with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) has been used to follow the dynamics of the NE assembly and the mechanism investigation of the NE membrane precursor targeting to the chromatin (42Ellenberg J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Methods. 1999; 19: 362-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 43Haraguchi T. Koujin T. Hayakawa T. Kaneda T. Tsutsumi C. Imamoto N. Akazawa C. Sukegawa C. Yoneda4 Y. Hiraoka Y. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 779-794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a more recent study we found that, during the NE reassembly, the targeting of the NE membrane precursor vesicles to the chromatin is mediated by the interaction of the N-terminal spanning region with importin β (15Ma Y. Cai S. Lv Q. Jiang Q. Zhang Q. Sodmergen Zhai Z. Zhang C. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 520-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Once meeting with Ran-GTP on the surface of the chromatin generated by RCC1, importin β preferentially binds with Ran-GTP and releases the LBR-bearing vesicles to assemble the NE. With the hydrolysis of the GTP molecule of Ran, the membrane vesicles fuse to form the bi-layered NE and importin β leaves Ran for next cycle (6Clarke P.R. Zhang C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 464-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 15Ma Y. Cai S. Lv Q. Jiang Q. Zhang Q. Sodmergen Zhai Z. Zhang C. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 520-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, how the interaction between importin β and LBR is regulated and why overexpression of LBR causes over-generation of the membrane remain unclear. In this work, we report that the targeting of the LBR-bearing NE precursor membrane vesicles to the chromatin during the NE assembly is mediated by importin β through interaction of its aa 45–462 with the aa 69–90 of LBR. LBR knockdown causes the NE assembly failure and the cell death in early G1 phase. We also show that the phosphorylation status of LBR serine 71 regulates the interaction between LBR and importin β. Deletion of the N-terminal spanning domain or aa 69–73 of LBR reduces the binding strength of LBR to the chromatin in interphase, increases the lateral movement potential of LBR, prevents successful targeting of the LBR-bearing NE precursor membrane vesicles to the chromatin at the end of mitosis, and causes the cell death of the daughter cells in next early G1 phase. We also find that the first transmembrane domain of LBR is responsible for the membrane production. Together, our results demonstrate that LBR performs a crucial role in recruiting the LBR-bearing NE precursor membrane vesicles to the chromatin during the NE assembly mediated by importin β in a phosphorylation-dependent manner in mitosis and that the first transmembrane domain of LBR is responsible for the membrane production and the targeting of this protein to the NE during the nuclear growth and the NE expansion in interphase. Wild-type Xenopus LBR (NCBI Y17842) was cloned from a cDNA library of Xenopus oocytes (Clontech) and inserted into pEGFP-C2 vector (Invitrogen) at the EcoRI and SalI restriction sites. GFP-xLBR1–210 was constructed by inserting the cDNA encoding aa 1–210 into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pEGFP-C2. GFP-xLBRΔ1–210, GFP-xLBR53–210, GFP-xLBR66–210, GFP-xLBR73–210, GFP-xLBR1–210-Δ69–73, GFP-xLBR1–210-Δ73–90, and GFP-xLBR90–210 were subcloned by inserting the cDNA sequence encoding the corresponding amino acids into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pEGFP-C2. GFP-xLBR1–260, GFP-xLBRΔ211–260, GFP-xLBRΔ211–289, GFP-xLBR1–621, GFP-xLBR1–621-S71A, GFP-xLBR1–621-S71D, and GFP-xLBR1–621Δ69–73 were cloned into the PstI and SalI sites of pEGFP-C1. Full-length hLBR and hLBR1–206 were cloned into the EcoRI and SalI restriction sites of pEGFP-C2 by similar methods. GFP-xLBR1–210-S71A and GFP-xLBR1–210-S71D were constructed by a single site mutagenesis method. xLBR1–210, xLBR1–210-S71A, and xLBR1–210-S71D were subcloned into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pET-28a vector. GST-importin β1–876, GST-importin β1–462, GST-importin β45–462, GST-importin β1–380, GST-importin β45–876, GST-importin β71–462, GST-importin β45–380, and GST-importin β71–380 were constructed by cloning into the BamHI site of pGEX-4T-1 vector. Escherichia coli strain BL21 (pLys) was transformed with His-xLBR1–210, His-xLBR1–210-S71A, His-xLBR1–210S71D, GST-importin β1–876, GST-importin β1–462, GST-importin β45–462, GST-importin β1–380, GST-importin β45–876, GST-importin β71–462, GST-importin β45–380, and GST-importin β71–380. To produce the recombinant His-tagged LBR proteins, the bacterial cells were grown to an A600 of ∼1.0. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the cells were incubated at 30 °C for more than 5 h to induce protein expression. To produce recombinant GST-tagged importin β proteins, the bacterial cell cultures were grown to an A600 of ∼0.5. Isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added at a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the cultures were incubated at 17 °C for >6 h to induce the protein expression. The bacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Proteins were purified with either Talon-Resin (BD Bioscience) or Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. HeLa cells were grown in DMEM medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma), on 35-mm diameter Petri dishes at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere and transfected using the calcium precipitation method as described previously (44Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Briefly, the precipitated plasmid DNA was left with the cells in the Petri dishes for 6 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and grown for another 24–48 h before direct observation and fixation for immunofluorescence microscopy. For cell synchronization, HeLa cells were grown in DMEM, treated in thymidine (2.5 mm) for 20 h, released in fresh medium for 4 h, and then treated with nocodazole (50 nm) for 12 h. Almost all the cells were blocked at metaphase. For RNAi, HeLa cells were transfected with LBR-HSS105976, LBR-HSS105977, and LBR-HSS105978 by Lipofectamine 2000. Samples were assayed at 72 h after transfection. HeLa cells were washed once with cold PBS and lysed in cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 10 g/ml aprotinin, and 5 g/ml Pepstatin A) for 20 min on ice and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min to obtain clear cell lysates. For co-immunoprecipitation assays, the clarified cell lysates were incubated with indicated antibodies for 60 min on ice. Then 15 μl of protein A- or G-Sepharose (75% slurry) was added, and the mixtures were rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and harvested by brief centrifugation and finally suspended in gel sample buffer. For GST pulldown assay, 5 μg of soluble GST or GST-fused proteins bound to 15 μl of Glutathione-Sepharose beads (75% slurry) were incubated with lysates from HeLa cells for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer and harvested by brief centrifugation and finally suspended in gel sample buffer. The beads-bound proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed by immunoblotting (IB) with the indicated antibodies. After being separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, the protein samples were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters in the transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol) for 1 h at 100 V. The filters were blocked in TTBS (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl, and 0.3% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature and probed with anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, diluted 1:1000 in TTBS with 5% nonfat milk) or probed with anti-importin β monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction, diluted 1:1000 in TTBS with 5% nonfat milk) overnight at 4 °C. The filters were then washed three times and blocked again for 30 min in TTBS containing 5% nonfat milk and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson, diluted 1:1000 in TTBS with 5% nonfat milk) for 1 h at room temperature. After a thorough wash in TTBS, the filters were developed for visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence (Sigma) and x-ray films. Transfected cells were grown to 60% confluency on 35-mm diameter Petri dishes, washed three times with PBS, and fixed at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 3% BSA for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The antibody against cleaved caspase 3 was from Cell Signaling Technology and diluted at 1:1000. The antibody against hLBR was generated by injecting rabbits and diluted 1:500. The cells were then washed five times in PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 3% BSA (TRITC goat anti-rabbit Ig (DAKO), diluted 1:200) at room temperature for 45 min to 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed five times in PBS and mounted in Mowiol (Sigma) containing DAPI. Samples were viewed under a Zeiss immunofluorescence microscope 200M equipped with a 63× objective. Images were captured using a cooled charged-coupled device AxioCamMRm camera. HeLa cells grown in a glass-bottomed Petri dish in a temperature-controlled chamber at 37 °C with 5% CO2 were transfected with GFP-xLBR 211–621, GFP-xLBR1–621Δ69–73, or full-length GFP-xLBR1–621 (as control). The images of the cells expressing the GFP fusion protein were acquired every 5 min by a cooled charged-coupled device AxioCamMRm camera on an Axiovert 200M microscope. The Axiovert software was used to collect and process the data. Low speed Xenopus egg extracts were prepared as described previously (45Hartl P. Olson E. Dang T. Forbes D.J. J.

The extracts were then frozen and stored in aliquots in liquid nitrogen until use. Sperms were released from testes by gently squeezing in nuclear isolation buffer (NIB, 15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm spermine, and 0.25 m sucrose) and centrifuged at 100 × g for 1 min at 4 °C to remove somatic tissues. Sperm-containing supernatant was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was re-suspended in NIB and incubated in the presence of 0.05% lysolecithin for 8–10 min at 23 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 3 volumes of cold NIB plus 3% BSA. After washing for three times with NIB, the demembraned sperm chromatin were stored in aliquots in liquid nitrogen at 108/ml. Low speed egg extract was mixed with an ATP-regenerating system and the demembraned sperm chromatin. The reaction system contained 20 μl of low speed egg extract, 1 μl of ATP-regenerating system, and ∼2000/μl demembraned sperm chromatin. The proteins His-xLBR1–210, His-xLBR1–210-S71A, His-xLBR1–210-S71D, or EB buffer (extract buffer) alone was added into the reaction system to a final concentration of 10 μm. The samples were removed after incubation at 23 °C for the time indicated and stained on a slide with 3,3-dihexyloxacarbocyanine without fixation. The samples were immediately viewed under a Zeiss 200M immunofluorescence microscope equipped with a 63× objective. Images were captured using a cooled charged-coupled device AxioCamMRm camera. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was performed with a Leica confocal microscope using a 488-nm line of a 400-milliwatt Kr/Ar laser in conjunction with a 100× objective for optimum resolution. For quantitative essay, the framed areas were photobleached at full laser power (100% power and 100% transmission) for 2 s, and recovery of the fluorescence was monitored by scanning the whole cell at low laser power (19% power and 19% transmission) in a 20-s intervals. The scanning laser intensity did not significantly photobleach the specimen over the time course of the experiment. 2 μg of His-hLBR 1–210 was incubated with cyclin B/Cdc2 (New England Biolabs) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm DTT, 100 mm ATP, for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the gels were processed for MS analysis. The targeted gel band was cut and destained by 25 mm NH4HCO3 in 50% acetonitrile. The gel band was dried in 100% acetonitrile and digested in 25 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.0) with modified porcine trypsin (Promega"
https://openalex.org/W2019368087,"The bones of the vertebrate limb form by the process of endochondral ossification, whereby limb mesenchyme condenses to form an intermediate cartilage scaffold that is then replaced by bone. Although Indian hedgehog (IHH) is known to control hypertophic differentiation of chondrocytes during this process, the role of hedgehog signaling in the earlier stages of chondrogenesis is less clear. We have conditionally inactivated the hedgehog receptor Ptc1 in undifferentiated limb mesenchyme of the mouse limb using Prx1-Cre, thus inducing constitutively active ligand-independent hedgehog signaling. In addition to major patterning defects, we observed a marked disruption to the cartilage elements in the limbs of Prx1-Cre:Ptc1(c/c) embryos. Using an in vitro micromass culture system we show that this defect lies downstream of mesenchymal cell condensation and likely upstream of chondrocyte differentiation. Despite early increases in levels of chondrogenic genes, soon after mesenchymal condensation the stromal layer of Prx1-Cre:Ptc1(c/c)-derived micromass cultures is characterized by a loss of cell integrity, which is associated with increased cell death and a striking decrease in Alcian blue staining cartilage nodules. Furthermore, inhibition of the hedgehog pathway activation using cyclopamine was sufficient to essentially overcome this chondrogenic defect in both micromass and ex vivo explant assays of Prx1-Cre:Ptc1(c/c) limbs. These data demonstrate for the first time the inhibitory effect of cell autonomously activated hedgehog signaling on chondrogenesis, and stress the importance of PTC1 in maintaining strict control of signaling levels during this phase of skeletal development."
https://openalex.org/W2028653672,"Despite the profound physiological consequences associated with peripheral membrane protein localization, only a rudimentary understanding of the interactions of proteins with membrane surfaces exists because these questions are inaccessible by commonly used structural techniques. Here, we combine high resolution field-cycling (31)P NMR relaxation methods with spin-labeled proteins to delineate specific interactions of a bacterial phospholipase C with phospholipid vesicles. Unexpectedly, discrete binding sites for both a substrate analogue and a different phospholipid (phosphatidylcholine) known to activate the enzyme are observed. The lifetimes for the occupation of these sites (when the protein is anchored transiently to the membrane) are >1-2 micros (but <1 ms), which represents the first estimate of an off-rate for a lipid dissociating from a specific site on the protein and returning to the bilayer. Furthermore, analyses of the spin-label induced NMR relaxation corroborates the presence of a discrete tyrosine-rich phosphatidylcholine binding site whose location is consistent with that suggested by modeling studies. The methodology illustrated here may be extended to a wide range of peripheral membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2013706945,"In this study, we analyzed the effects of tensile mechanical stress on the gene expression profile of in vitro-maintained human periodontal ligament (PDL) cells. A DNA chip analysis identified 17 up-regulated genes in human PDL cells under the mechanical stress, including HOMER1 (homer homolog 1) and GRIN3A (glutamate receptor ionotropic N-methyl-d-aspartate 3A), which are related to glutamate signaling. RT-PCR and real-time PCR analyses revealed that human PDL cells constitutively expressed glutamate signaling-associated genes and that mechanical stress increased the expression of these mRNAs, leading to release of glutamate from human PDL cells and intracellular glutamate signal transduction. Interestingly, exogenous glutamate increased the mRNAs of cytodifferentiation and mineralization-related genes as well as the ALP (alkaline phosphatase) activities during the cytodifferentiation of the PDL cells. On the other hand, the glutamate signaling inhibitors riluzole and (+)-MK801 maleate suppressed the alkaline phosphatase activities and mineralized nodule formation during the cytodifferentiation and mineralization. Riluzole inhibited the mechanical stress-induced glutamate signaling-associated gene expressions in human PDL cells. Moreover, in situ hybridization analyses showed up-regulation of glutamate signaling-associated gene expressions at tension sites in the PDL under orthodontic tooth movement in a mouse model.

They have increased affinity and specificity toward their targets due to their ability to bind two binding sites simultaneously and are therefore attractive in drug design. However, few studies have addressed the kinetic mechanism of interaction of such bivalent ligands. We have investigated the binding interaction of a recently identified potent plasma-stable dimeric pentapeptide and PDZ1–2 of postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) using protein engineering in combination with fluorescence polarization, isothermal titration calorimetry, and stopped-flow fluorimetry. We demonstrate that binding occurs via a two-step process, where an initial binding to either one of the two PDZ domains is followed by an intramolecular step, which produces the bidentate complex. We have determined all rate constants involved in the binding reaction and found evidence for a conformational transition of the complex. Our data demonstrate the importance of a slow dissociation for a successful dimeric ligand but also highlight the possibility of optimizing the intramolecular association rate. The results may therefore aid the design of dimeric inhibitors in general. Dimeric ligands can be potent inhibitors of protein-protein or enzyme-substrate interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2004578008,"Obesity is characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver and other tissues, leading to insulin resistance. We have previously shown that a specific inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, which inhibits the initial step in the synthesis of glycosphingolipids (GSLs), improved glucose metabolism and decreased hepatic steatosis in both ob/ob and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Here we have determined in the DIO mouse model the efficacy of a related small molecule compound, Genz-112638, which is currently being evaluated clinically for the treatment of Gaucher disease, a lysosomal storage disorder.DIO mice were treated with the Genz-112638 for 12 to 16 weeks by daily oral gavage. Genz-112638 lowered HbA1c levels and increased glucose tolerance. Whole body adiposity was not affected in normal mice, but decreased in drug-treated obese mice. Drug treatment also significantly lowered liver triglyceride levels and reduced the development of hepatic steatosis. We performed hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps on the DIO mice treated with Genz-112638 and showed that insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production increased significantly compared to the placebo treated mice, indicating a marked improvement in hepatic insulin sensitivity.These results indicate that GSL inhibition in obese mice primarily results in an increase in insulin action in the liver, and suggests that GSLs may have an important role in hepatic insulin resistance in conditions of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2073537066,"Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) is one of the major mechanisms for removing Ca(2+) from the cytosol especially in cardiac myocytes and neurons, where their physiological activities are triggered by an influx of Ca(2+). NCX contains a large intracellular loop (NCXIL) that is responsible for regulating NCX activity. Recent evidence has shown that proteins, including kinases and phosphatases, associate with NCX1IL to form a NCX1 macromolecular complex. To search for the molecules that interact with NCX1IL and regulate NCX1 activity, we used the yeast two-hybrid method to screen a human heart cDNA library and found that the C-terminal region of sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase (sMiCK) interacted with NCX1IL. Moreover, both sMiCK and the muscle-type creatine kinase (CKM) coimmunoprecipitated with NCX1 using lysates of cardiacmyocytes and HEK293T cells that transiently expressed NCX1 and various creatine kinases. Both sMiCK and CKM were able to produce a recovery in the decreased NCX1 activity that was lost under energy-compromised conditions. This regulation is mediated through a putative PKC phosphorylation site of sMiCK and CKM. The autophosphorylation and the catalytic activity of sMiCK and CKM are not required for their regulation of NCX1 activity. Our results suggest a novel mechanism for the regulation of NCX1 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2105013791,"The c-fos proto-oncogene is an archetype for rapid and integrative transcriptional activation. Innumerable studies have focused on the canonical promoter, located upstream from the transcriptional start site. However, several regulatory sequences have been found in the first intron.Here we describe an extremely conserved region in c-fos first intron that contains a putative TATA box, and functional TRE and CRE sites. This fragment drives reporter gene activation in fibroblasts, which is enhanced by increasing intracellular calcium and cAMP and by cotransfection of CREB or c-Fos/c-Jun expression vectors. We produced transgenic mice expressing a lacZ reporter controlled by the intronic promoter. Lac Z expression of this promoter is restricted to the developing central nervous system (CNS) and the mesenchyme of developing mammary buds in embryos 12.5 days post-conception, and to brain tissue in adults. RT-QPCR analysis of tissue mRNA, including the anlage of the mammary gland and the CNS, confirms the existence of a novel, nested mRNA initiated in the first intron.Our results provide evidence for a novel, developmentally regulated promoter in the first intron of the c-fos gene."
https://openalex.org/W2040730864,"Background In malaria endemic countries, children who have experienced an episode of severe anaemia are at increased risk of a recurrence of anaemia. There is a need to find ways of protecting these at risk children from malaria and chemoprevention offers a potential way of achieving this objective. Methods During the 2003 and 2004 malaria transmission seasons, 1200 Gambian children with moderate or severe anaemia (Hb concentration <7 g/dL) were randomised to receive either monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) or placebo until the end of the malaria transmission season in which they were enrolled, in a double-blind trial. All study subjects were treated with oral iron for 28 days and morbidity was monitored through surveillance at health centres. The primary endpoint was the proportion of children with moderate or severe anaemia at the end of the transmission season. Secondary endpoints included the incidence of clinical episodes of malaria during the surveillance period, outpatient attendances, the prevalence of parasitaemia and splenomegaly, nutritional status at the end of the malaria transmission season and compliance with the treatment regimen. Results The proportions of children with a Hb concentration of <7 g/dL at the end of the malaria transmission season were similar in the two study groups, 14/464 (3.0%) in children who received at least one dose of SP and 16/471 (3.4%) in those who received placebo, prevalence ratio 0.89 (0.44,1.8) P = 0.742. The protective efficacy of SP against episodes of clinical malaria was 53% (95% CI 37%, 65%). Treatment with SP was safe and well tolerated; no serious adverse events related to SP administration were observed. Mortality following discharge from hospital was low among children who received SP or placebo (6 in the SP group and 9 in the placebo group respectively). Conclusions Intermittent treatment with SP did not reduce the proportion of previously anaemic children with moderate or severe anaemia at the end of the malaria season, although it prevented malaria. The combination of appropriate antimalarial treatment plus one month of iron supplementation and good access to healthcare during follow-up proved effective in restoring haemoglobin to an acceptable level in the Gambian setting.

https://openalex.org/W2096823738,"Myosin VI is an unconventional motor protein and functions in a variety of intracellular processes such as cell migration, vesicular trafficking, and homeostasis of the Golgi complex. Previously, we found that myosin VI is up-regulated in RKO, LS174T, and H1299 cells by DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner and mediates the pro-survival function of p53. Here, we showed that the levels of myosin VI protein were markedly inhibited in MCF7 and LNCaP cells by topoisomerase I-II inhibitors. However, the levels of myosin VI transcript were decreased only by topoisomerase I inhibitors. We also found that the levels of myosin VI protein were markedly inhibited in MCF7 cells by wild-type p53 but not tumor-derived mutant p53. Surprisingly, we found that the level of myosin VI transcript was slightly increased instead of decreased in MCF7 cells by p53, suggesting that a mechanism other than transcriptional repression is involved. Additionally, we found that on the myosin VI promoter, the level of acetylated histone H3 was markedly decreased, whereas that of p53 and acetylated histone H4 was slightly increased in MCF7 cells upon treatment with topoisomerase I-II inhibitors. Finally, we showed that overexpression of myosin VI enhances, whereas knockdown of myosin VI decreases, DNA damage-induced stabilization of p53, and consequently, knockdown of myosin VI de-sensitizes MCF7 cells to DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Taken together, as a mediator of the p53 pro-survival pathway and a marker of malignancy in some tumors, differential regulation of myosin VI in various tumor cells by topoisomerase inhibitors dictates whether knockdown of myosin VI inhibits, rather than enhances, the susceptibility of tumor cells to some therapeutic agents, which might be explored for designing a proper therapeutic strategy."
