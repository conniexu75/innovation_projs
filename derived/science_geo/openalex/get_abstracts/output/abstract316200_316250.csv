https://openalex.org/W2087817950,"An experimental technique is described for simultaneously measuring the static and dynamic interactions of very thin liquid films between two surfaces as they are moved normally or laterally relative to each other. Film thickness can be measured and controlled to 1 angstrom. Initial results are presented of the transition in the physical properties of liquid films only one molecular layer thick to thicker films whose properties are practically indistinguishable from the bulk. In particular, the results show that two molecularly smooth surfaces, when close together in simple liquids, slide (shear) past each other while separated by a discrete number of molecular layers, and that the frictional force is ""quantized"" with the number of layers."

Transfer of the arcelin-1 allele to bean cultivars and addition of purified arcelin to artificial seeds results in high levels of insect resistance. The nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences of the arcelin-1 complementary DNA are very similar to those of genes encoding the bean seed lectin, phytohemagglutinin. The gene or genes encoding arcelin may have evolved from a phytohemagglutinin gene or genes resulting in an effective mechanism for resistance to bean bruchids."
https://openalex.org/W2057478402,"Nonradiative energy transfer between fluorescent labels attached to polymers has been used to characterize polymer miscibility, the interpenetration of chain molecules in solution, micelle formation in graft copolymers, the unfolding of collapsed chain molecules in polymer melts, and the transfer of energy absorbed by a large number of donor labels to a small number of acceptors by an ""antenna effect."" The change in the emission spectrum after ionomer solutions with different fluorescent counterions were mixed provided rate constants for counterion interchange. The fluorescence behavior of dispersions of donor-labeled polymers stabilized by a graft copolymer with acceptor fluorophores in the solution phase led to inferences about the morphology of the dispersed particles."

https://openalex.org/W2045436872,"The discussion of the new triple-digit superconductors at the 1988 meeting of the American Physical Society in New Orleans emphasized several points about these materials. These thallium-based materials have taken the critical temperature for superconductivity up to 125 K. There seems to be a direct correlation between the copper-oxygen layers and the materials' superconductivity, i.e. the higher the number of layers, the higher the critical temperature. The information presented here seems to establish that only copper-oxygen layers and not necessarily copper-oxygen chains are responsible for the superconductivity. Prediction is made of a four-layer thallium compound that would be superconducting at 150 to 160 K."

https://openalex.org/W2061864479,It is argued that the impulsive 100-Hz noise bursts detected with the use of the electric field antenna on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO) have plasma wave charcteristics that can only be explained if they are whistler mode signals of a type that can be produced by atmospheric discharges. It is further argued that these data are evidence for lightning and volcanic activity on Venus. A reply contends that the PVO electric field measurements are unrelated to either the lower atmosphere or the surface of Venus.
