The lay and scientific literature typically claims that humans can discriminate 10,000 odors, but this number has never been empirically validated. We determined the resolution of the human sense of smell by testing the capacity of humans to discriminate odor mixtures with varying numbers of shared components. On the basis of the results of psychophysical testing, we calculated that humans can discriminate at least 1 trillion olfactory stimuli. This is far more than previous estimates of distinguishable olfactory stimuli. It demonstrates that the human olfactory system, with its hundreds of different olfactory receptors, far outperforms the other senses in the number of physically different stimuli it can discriminate."

https://openalex.org/W2060357443,"The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in the midbrain is a key center for serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT)-expressing neurons. Serotonergic neurons in the DRN have been theorized to encode punishment by opposing the reward signaling of dopamine neurons. Here, we show that DRN neurons encode reward, but not punishment, through 5-HT and glutamate. Optogenetic stimulation of DRN Pet-1 neurons reinforces mice to explore the stimulation-coupled spatial region, shifts sucrose preference, drives optical self-stimulation, and directs sensory discrimination learning. DRN Pet-1 neurons increase their firing activity during reward tasks, and this activation can be used to rapidly change neuronal activity patterns in the cortex. Although DRN Pet-1 neurons are often associated with 5-HT, they also release glutamate, and both neurotransmitters contribute to reward signaling. These experiments demonstrate the ability of DRN neurons to organize reward behaviors and might provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of learning facilitation and anhedonia treatment."

The study also shows that such morphological changes can differentially regulate biochemical and electrical compartmentalization of spines and that previous characterizations of dendritic spine subtypes based on static ultrastructural morphologies may not reflect the diversity and plasticity seen in living neurons. Dendritic spines have been proposed to transform synaptic signals through chemical and electrical compartmentalization. However, the quantitative contribution of spine morphology to synapse compartmentalization and its dynamic regulation are still poorly understood. We used time-lapse super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) imaging in combination with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements, two-photon glutamate uncaging, electrophysiology and simulations to investigate the dynamic link between nanoscale anatomy and compartmentalization in live spines of CA1 neurons in mouse brain slices. We report a diversity of spine morphologies that argues against common categorization schemes and establish a close link between compartmentalization and spine morphology, wherein spine neck width is the most critical morphological parameter. We demonstrate that spine necks are plastic structures that become wider and shorter after long-term potentiation. These morphological changes are predicted to lead to a substantial drop in spine head excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) while preserving overall biochemical compartmentalization."

Ruths and Ruths (p. 1373 ; see the Perspective by Onnela ) have developed a theoretical framework for analyzing individual controls within networks based on numbers of sources and sinks for information flow. By this method, the number of controls required by a network can be predicted and direct comparisons for the basis for control across networks of differing size, structure, and function can be made. Although three broad classes of real networks were observed, current, established random models of networks were insufficient to model their control structures."

Martínez-García et al.

Hence, in the Southern Ocean the biological pump was strengthened when dust fluxes were high, which explains a significant part of the difference in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations observed to occur across glacial cycles."
https://openalex.org/W2004647205,"Chickens are major source of food and protein worldwide. Feed conversion and the health of chickens relies on the largely unexplored complex microbial community that inhabits the chicken gut, including the ceca. We have carried out deep microbial community profiling of the microbiota in twenty cecal samples via 16S rRNA gene sequences and an in-depth metagenomics analysis of a single cecal microbiota. We recovered 699 phylotypes, over half of which appear to represent previously unknown species. We obtained 648,251 environmental gene tags (EGTs), the majority of which represent new species. These were binned into over two-dozen draft genomes, which included Campylobacter jejuni and Helicobacter pullorum. We found numerous polysaccharide- and oligosaccharide-degrading enzymes encoding within the metagenome, some of which appeared to be part of polysaccharide utilization systems with genetic evidence for the co-ordination of polysaccharide degradation with sugar transport and utilization. The cecal metagenome encodes several fermentation pathways leading to the production of short-chain fatty acids, including some with novel features. We found a dozen uptake hydrogenases encoded in the metagenome and speculate that these provide major hydrogen sinks within this microbial community and might explain the high abundance of several genera within this microbiome, including Campylobacter, Helicobacter and Megamonas."

However, during natural behavior, animals make decisions in a constantly changing environment. To investigate the neural mechanisms of such dynamic choices, we recorded activity in dorsal premotor (PMd) and primary motor cortex (M1) while monkeys performed a two-choice reaching task in which sensory information about the correct choice was changing within each trial and the decision could be made at any time. During deliberation, activity in both areas did not integrate sensory information but instead tracked it and combined it with a growing urgency signal. Approximately 280 ms before movement onset, PMd activity tuned to the selected target reached a consistent peak while M1 activity tuned to the unselected target was suppressed. We propose that this reflects the resolution of a competition between the potential responses and constitutes the volitional commitment to an action choice.

When buying a house, one is motivated to first collect relevant information and then take time to think about the best choice. Because careful deliberation is important to human behavior, studies of the neural mechanisms of decision making have largely focused on scenarios in which subjects decide about information that is stable over time. For example, perceptual decisions are usually studied using stimuli whose informational content is constant in each trial (Britten et al., 1992Britten K.H. Shadlen M.N. Newsome W.T. Movshon J.A.

Neuronal correlates of a perceptual decision in ventral premotor cortex.Neuron. 2004; 41: 165-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), leading to models of deliberation as the integration of sensory evidence to a threshold (Gold and Shadlen, 2007Gold J.I.

Rev. 1978; 85: 59-108Crossref Scopus (2982) Google Scholar). Likewise, studies of value-based decisions focus on conditions in which the value of options is stable (Padoa-Schioppa, 2011Padoa-Schioppa C. Neurobiology of economic choice: a good-based model.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 34: 333-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, Platt and Glimcher, 1999Platt M.L. Glimcher P.W. Neural correlates of decision variables in parietal cortex.Nature. 1999; 400: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar), leading to serial models in which the costs and benefits are converted into a “common currency,” the decision is made, and the chosen action is then prepared (Padoa-Schioppa, 2011Padoa-Schioppa C. Neurobiology of economic choice: a good-based model.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 34: 333-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). However, the vertebrate brain evolved to guide behavior in a dynamic world, in which decisions are made during ongoing activity, action options and their payoffs are continuously changing, and animals are free to decide when to take time to deliberate and when to commit quickly to their current best guess. Here, we investigate such “embodied” decisions and ask which conclusions from static scenarios generalize to real-time dynamic decisions. In particular, studies of static tasks have suggested that the brain gradually integrates repeated samples of the stimulus, causing neural activity to build up to a threshold (Gold and Shadlen, 2007Gold J.I. Shadlen M.N. The neural basis of decision making.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 535-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar, Ratcliff, 1978Ratcliff R. A theory of memory retrieval.Psychol. Rev. 1978; 85: 59-108Crossref Scopus (2982) Google Scholar). However, if the sensory information can suddenly change, such a process is suboptimal, because integrators are sluggish to respond to changes in input. Recent human studies of dynamic tasks have suggested that instead of integrating the sensory state, the brain quickly tracks it, and activity buildup is caused by a growing urgency to act (Cisek et al., 2009Cisek P.

These models can only be distinguished with dynamic tasks, because they make identical predictions for any static task, at both the behavioral and neural level. Furthermore, many neurophysiological studies have shown that decision making influences activity in the sensorimotor system (Gold and Shadlen, 2000Gold J.I. Shadlen M.N.

In particular, when animals are faced with multiple response options, the brain represents them in parallel within sensorimotor regions (Baumann et al., 2009Baumann M.A. Fluet M.C. Scherberger H.

Deliberation in the motor system: reflex gains track evolving evidence leading to a decision.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 2276-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Such results have led to the proposal that decisions between actions involve processes within the sensorimotor system (Cisek, 2007Cisek P.

Sci. 2007; 362: 1585-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, Hernández et al., 2010Hernández A. Nácher V. Luna R. Zainos A. Lemus L. Alvarez M. Vázquez Y. Camarillo L. Romo R.

MIT press, Cambridge2008: 71-101Crossref Google Scholar). However, it is also possible that they simply reflect information that spills in from upstream regions that are actually responsible for deliberation and commitment. To establish whether the sensorimotor system plays an active role in deliberation, neural activity must be examined well before commitment is made, and this can be accomplished with dynamic tasks. Here, we investigate these questions through neurophysiological recordings in the dorsal premotor (PMd) and primary motor cortex (M1) of monkeys trained to perform two reaching tasks. In the “tokens” task (Figure 1A), monkeys watch a set of 15 tokens jumping every 200 ms from a central target to one of two peripheral targets and must guess which target will ultimately receive the majority of the tokens. Importantly, the decision can be taken at any time, and when a target is reached, the token jumps accelerate, allowing the monkey to save time by taking an early guess. In the “delayed response” (DR) task, only a single peripheral target is presented, and the monkey must withhold movement until the 15 tokens jump into the target simultaneously (GO signal). Our paradigm has two critical properties. First, the sensory evidence in the tokens task is continuously changing, allowing us to dissociate different models of how sensory information is treated. Second, in the tokens task, the monkeys are free to respond at any time, allowing us to distinguish processes related to deliberation from those related to commitment. In particular, by comparing activity during the tokens task with activity during the DR task, in which both the choice and its timing are externally instructed, we can identify the neural phenomena specifically associated with volitional commitment to action. In the tokens task, monkeys’ success rate varied between 64%–87% (mean: 77%; SD: 5%, SE: 0.5%). To analyze how behavior depended upon the specific pattern of token jumps in each trial, we first estimated the total sensory and motor delays using the mean reaction time (mRT) from the DR task (Monkey S: 291 ± 40 ms; Monkey Z: 335 ± 93 ms) and then subtracted this from the reaction time (RT) in the tokens task to estimate the decision time (DT) (Figure 1B). Next, we estimated the success probability at decision time (SPD) using Equation 1 below. We compared these variables in three trial types: easy, ambiguous, and misleading (Figure 1C), classified post hoc from the fully random trials. As expected, both monkeys made decisions significantly earlier in easy than in ambiguous or misleading trials (Kolmogorov-Smirnov [KS] test, p < 0.01) (Figure 1D). They also made decisions at a significantly lower level of success probability in ambiguous and misleading trials than in easy trials (KS test, p < 0.05) (Figure 1E). This is consistent with the hypothesis that to solve the task, monkeys use an accuracy criterion that decreases over time. To test this across all trials, we grouped data according to the number of tokens that moved before DT and calculated an estimate of the accuracy criterion (or “confidence”) for the selected target at that time. This estimate was based on the sum of the log likelihood ratios of individual token jumps (SumLogLR; see Experimental Procedures), which is related to the difference in the number of tokens in the two targets. The result is shown in Figure 1F. Except for fast guesses (<1 s), there is a trend for decisions to be made at a lower level of accuracy as time passes. This demonstrates that both monkeys use a similar strategy as humans to solve the task (Cisek et al., 2009Cisek P. Puskas G.A. El-Murr S. Decisions in changing conditions: the urgency-gating model.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11560-11571Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar)—they decrease their accuracy criterion over time. Previous studies have suggested that this can be implemented by combining sensory information with a growing “urgency signal” (Churchland et al., 2008Churchland A.K. Kiani R. Shadlen M.N.

While monkeys performed the tokens task, neural activity was recorded from 178 cells in the arm area of PMd (135 in monkey S) and 74 cells in M1 (55 in monkey S) excluding the most caudal region in the central sulcus (Figure S1 available online). Among these, 99 cells (68 in PMd and 31 in M1) had a significant directional preference before DT (see Experimental Procedures) and thus reliably predicted whether an arm movement would be made toward or away from the cell’s preferred target (PT). Figure 2A shows the activity of an example PMd neuron, aligned on the start of token jumps and plotted until 300 ms before movement onset, during easy, ambiguous, and misleading trials in which the monkey chose the cell’s PT or the opposite target (OT). In easy trials, activity strongly and quickly increases when the monkey selects the PT and is quickly suppressed when the OT is chosen. In ambiguous trials, activity fluctuates and gradually increases during the first seven token jumps (∼1.4 s), and the cell discriminates between PT and OT only late in the trial. The pattern of activity is again very different in misleading trials. When the PT is ultimately selected, activity is initially low while the first few tokens favor the OT and later switches to predict the PT choice. In contrast, in OT trials the early activity is strong, while tokens favor the PT, and later decreases. Interestingly, we found very similar phenomena in M1, as shown in Figure 2B for an example cell. Like the PMd cell in Figure 2A, this M1 neuron quickly reflected the choice in easy trials, fluctuated during ambiguous trials, and reflected the switch of evidence in misleading trials. Figure 2C illustrates the average activity of all 68 PMd and 31 M1 decision-related neurons. The top panel shows the profile of success probability for each cell’s PT for easy (blue), ambiguous (green), and misleading (red) trials in which the monkey correctly chose the PT (solid) or OT (dashed). Below that, we show the average neural activity of the 68 PMd and 31 M1 cells aligned on the first token jump and plotted until 300 ms before movement initiation (diamonds) during those same trials. About 150 ms after the first token jump, activity increases or decreases in a manner that reflects the sensory evidence and the monkey’s ultimate choice, especially in PMd. In addition to the influence of the changing sensory evidence, there is a trend for activity to increase over time, and this is especially pronounced in M1. To further quantify these observations, we calculated the latency at which activity discriminates between PT and OT for all PMd and M1 decision-related cells in easy or ambiguous trials. The mean discrimination time was significantly shorter in easy than in ambiguous trials both in PMd (280 versus 624 ms; KS test; p < 0.01) and in M1 (341 versus 807 ms; KS test; p < 0.01). Moreover, in both easy and ambiguous trials, discrimination times were shorter in PMd than in M1, although this did not reach significance (KS test; p > 0.05). To quantify the effect of sensory evidence on neural activity across all trials (not just the three types shown in Figure 2), we measured each cell’s firing rate in successive 200 ms epochs following the first token jump. We then plotted this as a function of the sensory evidence (SumLogLR) present during the previous token jump (to allow for sensory delays). The result for example PMd and M1 cells is shown in Figures 3A and 3C, respectively. Both neurons exhibited a clear modulation of activity as a function of the evidence, increasing their firing rate as the evidence in favor of their PT increased (Spearman’s rank test; mean r = 0.93 for the PMd neuron and 0.75 for the M1 neuron). Moreover, this relationship changed as time was passing. In particular, both the baseline and the slope (calculated at the equal evidence point; vertical dashed line) tended to grow over time. These effects also held at the population level in both PMd and M1 (Figures 3B and 3D). Notably, at the population level, the increase of activity over time was primarily due to a baseline shift (Figure S2). The above results raise the question of what computational mechanism transforms sensory information into neural activity and what is responsible for the activity buildup. It has been suggested that during perceptual discrimination, such as deciding about the direction of noisy motion, the sensory signal is integrated over time by repeatedly resampling the stimulus (Bogacz et al., 2006Bogacz R. Brown E. Moehlis J. Holmes P. Cohen J.D. The physics of optimal decision making: a formal analysis of models of performance in two-alternative forced-choice tasks.Psychol. Rev. 2006; 113: 700-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar, Gold and Shadlen, 2007Gold J.I. Shadlen M.N. The neural basis of decision making.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 535-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar). Does a similar mechanism operate during the tokens task? In particular, does the brain temporally integrate the state of the sensory information about which the decision is made (i.e., the distribution of tokens), or does it simply track that sensory state? To distinguish between these two mechanisms, we examined additional trial types, classified post hoc from the fully random set. For example, during “bias-up/down” (BUD) trials (Figure 4A, top, green line) the first three tokens move to the PT, then the next two move toward the OT, and then the rest of the trial resembles an easy trial toward the PT (which is the correct target). In contrast, during “bias-down/up” (BDU) trials, the first two tokens move to the OT and the next three to the PT, and the rest of the trial is similar to BUD. Comparison between these two trial types is critical, because if the sensory state is integrated, then after the fifth token neural activity related to the PT will be higher in BUD than in BDU trials (because an integrator retains a “memory” of previous states). In contrast, if the sensory state is simply tracked, then one would not predict a significant difference between the trial types. Figure 4A illustrates the activity of one PMd neuron recorded during BUD and BDU trials. Importantly, we include only trials in which the monkey made decisions after the initial bias (>800 ms) and truncate activity 300 ms before movement onset. About 200 ms after the first token jump, activity begins to reflect the bias in the two trial types, becoming stronger in BUD than BDU trials. After 800 ms, as sensory evidence converges in both trials, neural activity likewise becomes similar. Therefore, this neuron did not integrate the sensory state during the bias, but instead tracked it quickly (note the rapid increase of activity after 800 ms in BDU trials, clearly visible in the rasters). This observation holds true when activity is averaged across PMd and M1 cells (Figure 4B). To test whether this effect is robust across individual cells, we compared the mean activity of each PMd and M1 decision-related cell in BUD and BDU trials in two epochs: during and after the bias. As predicted by both mechanisms, during the bias, the response is usually stronger in BUD than BDU trials. However, after the bias, most of the cells no longer discharge differently in the two trial types, consistent with a system that simply tracks the sensory state (Figures 4C and 4D). The integration and tracking mechanisms also make very distinct predictions at a behavioral level. In particular, integration predicts faster decisions in BUD than BDU trials, whereas tracking predicts no difference. In agreement with the latter, we found no statistical difference between decision durations in BUD versus BDU trials in both monkeys (Figure 5A, top row). Similar analyses on two other pairs of trial types (Figure 5A, middle and bottom rows) yielded the same conclusion—that choices were not biased by the early evidence, consistent with fast tracking of the sensory state and not with integration. In Figure S3 we show that neural activity in both PMd and M1 also tracks the sensory state in these trial types and exhibits no memory of the sensory state after the initial bias has ended. The observations above suggest that the sensory information is quickly tracked, perhaps through a low-pass filter with a very short time window (i.e., less than the duration between two token jumps [200 ms]). To test this explicitly, we computed the mean neural activity during two 200 ms epochs, from 200–400 ms and from 400–600 ms after the first token jump, and sorted trials according to the pattern of the two first token jumps: in step-for trials, the first token jumps to the cells’ PT, and the second token jumps to the OT. In step-against trials, this pattern is reversed. Accounting for sensory delays, the first epoch of analysis reflects the consequences of the first token jump. Comparison between step-for and step-against trials shows that activity in PMd is significantly higher (KS test; p < 0.05) and shows a similar trend in M1 during that first epoch in step-for than in step-against trials (Figure 5B). However, 200 ms later in the trial, activity is similar between the two conditions, in agreement with fast tracking of sensory information. Because monkeys are allowed to make their decision at any time during the tokens task, we can examine cortical activity for the neural signature of the moment at which commitment to a choice is made. To this end, we aligned activity on movement onset, as shown on Figures 6A and 6B, for one PMd and one M1 neuron. Note that approximately 300 ms before the monkey chooses the cell’s PT, there is a clear peak of activity in both cells, and the amplitude and timing of this peak are similar across the different trial types. As shown in Figure S4, this phenomenon exists at the level of individual trials and is not an artifact of averaging over trials of different lengths. It is also not related to saccades: although analysis of oculomotor behavior in our task will be described in a future publication, it is important to mention here that in most trials (74%–79%), the monkeys were already fixating the chosen target well before the peak in PMd activity. Figure 6C shows the average activity of the 68 PMd and 31 M1 neurons aligned on movement onset. In both areas, neural activity related to the PT shows a striking characteristic regardless of the trial type: between the start of token jumps and movement onset, activity first shows the influence of the mounting sensory evidence, then reaches a peak, and finally decreases prior to movement onset. The approximate timing of that peak (vertical gray line in Figure 6C) as well as its amplitude is very similar across trial types, appearing earlier in PMd than in M1. Importantly, at approximately the same time, activity in M1 related to the unselected OT target becomes rapidly suppressed. This is seen most clearly in ambiguous and misleading trials, in which there was some evidence favoring the OT choice. To further quantify the timing of these phenomena, we first averaged the activity of PMd and M1 neurons across all trials in which the PT was chosen and detected the peak firing rate across 10 ms bins. In PMd, this peak was reached 280 ms before movement onset, whereas in M1 it occurred 140 ms later (Figures 7A and 7D, left). To assess the robustness of this observation, we also calculated the peak timing for each cell separately and computed its mean and median latency across the population (Figures 7A and 7D, right). Except for a few cells whose maximum activity occurs very early, there is a clear trend for the peak to occur approximately 260 ms before movement onset in PMd and 179 ms in M1. Next, we sought to determine whether the latencies of neural activity peaks correlate with RTs and are consistent across trial types. For each cell, we calculated the mean latency of the peak in easy and misleading trials and then plotted these against the RT in those same trials (Figures 7B and 7E). In almost all PMd and M1 neurons, there is a strong relationship with a slope near unity, suggesting that regardless of the history of sensory information during a trial, the timing of PMd and M1 peaks is consistent relative to movement initiation. Here, we will use the earliest of these latency values as our estimate of the timing of commitment: 280 ms before movement onset. Figure 7C shows that the amplitude of the PMd activity at this moment in PT trials is very consistent across trial types, although there is a slight trend for it to be lower in easy trials, in which decisions are shorter. Most interestingly, at this same moment, M1 activity tuned to the unselected target becomes rapidly suppressed (Figure 6C). For each PMd and M1 cell, we quantified the timing of this suppression by examining how activity changed between two consecutive 50 ms bins at different latencies with respect to movement onset (see Figure S5). The distribution of the time of the greatest change between bins is quite broad for PMd, suggesting that there is no specific moment of suppression of cells tuned to the unselected target. In M1, however, the distribution is narrower, and the mean timing across cells (275 ms) roughly corresponds to our estimate of commitment time. In the tokens task, monkeys are free to decide both which target to choose and the time at which they commit to that choice. Figures 6 and 7 suggest that the neural peak in PMd and suppression in M1 signals this moment of free commitment. However, are these phenomena simply th"

We aimed to estimate the associations between pre-eclampsia/eclampsia and its risk factors, and adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. Methods We performed a secondary analysis of the WHO Global Survey on Maternal and Perinatal Health. The survey was a multi-country, facility-based cross-sectional study. A global sample consisting of 24 countries from three regions and 373 health facilities was obtained via a stratified multi-stage cluster sampling design. Maternal and offspring data were extracted from records using standardized questionnaires. Multi-level logistic regression modelling was conducted with random effects at the individual, facility and country levels. Results Data for 276,388 mothers and their infants was analysed. The prevalence of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia in the study population was 10,754 (4%). At the individual level, sociodemographic characteristics of maternal age ≥30 years and low educational attainment were significantly associated with higher risk of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia. As for clinical and obstetric variables, high body mass index (BMI), nulliparity (AOR: 2.04; 95%CI 1.92–2.16), absence of antenatal care (AOR: 1.41; 95%CI 1.26–1.57), chronic hypertension (AOR: 7.75; 95%CI 6.77–8.87), gestational diabetes (AOR: 2.00; 95%CI 1.63–2.45), cardiac or renal disease (AOR: 2.38; 95%CI 1.86–3.05), pyelonephritis or urinary tract infection (AOR: 1.13; 95%CI 1.03–1.24) and severe anemia (AOR: 2.98; 95%CI 2.47–3.61) were found to be significant risk factors, while having >8 visits of antenatal care was protective (AOR: 0.90; 95%CI 0.83–0.98). Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia was found to be a significant risk factor for maternal death, perinatal death, preterm birth and low birthweight. Conclusion Chronic hypertension, obesity and severe anemia were the highest risk factors of preeclampsia/eclampsia. Implementation of effective interventions prioritizing risk factors, provision of quality health services during pre-pregnancy and during pregnancy for joint efforts in the areas of maternal health are recommended."

However, in most cases, the distribution and dynamics of firing patterns of these neurons during behavior are not known. We imaged activity, with cellular resolution, throughout the whole brains of zebrafish performing the optokinetic response. We found a sparse, broadly distributed network that has an elaborate but ordered pattern, with a bilaterally symmetrical organization. Activity patterns fell into distinct clusters reflecting sensory and motor processing. By correlating neuronal responses with an array of sensory and motor variables, we find that the network can be clearly divided into distinct functional modules. Comparing aligned data from multiple fish, we find that the spatiotemporal activity dynamics and functional organization are highly stereotyped across individuals. These experiments systematically reveal the functional architecture of neural circuits underlying a sensorimotor behavior in a vertebrate brain."

https://openalex.org/W1993056315,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may arise from increased ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. Many pharmacological treatments have been tested in ASD, but only limited success has been achieved. Here we report that BTBR T(+)Itpr3(tf)/J (BTBR) mice, a model of idiopathic autism, have reduced spontaneous GABAergic neurotransmission. Treatment with low nonsedating/nonanxiolytic doses of benzodiazepines, which increase inhibitory neurotransmission through positive allosteric modulation of postsynaptic GABAA receptors, improved deficits in social interaction, repetitive behavior, and spatial learning. Moreover, negative allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors impaired social behavior in C57BL/6J and 129SvJ wild-type mice, suggesting that reduced inhibitory neurotransmission may contribute to social and cognitive deficits. The dramatic behavioral improvement after low-dose benzodiazepine treatment was subunit specific-the α2,3-subunit-selective positive allosteric modulator L-838,417 was effective, but the α1-subunit-selective drug zolpidem exacerbated social deficits. Impaired GABAergic neurotransmission may contribute to ASD, and α2,3-subunit-selective positive GABAA receptor modulation may be an effective treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2086074238,"Pluripotent stem cells have distinct metabolic requirements, and reprogramming cells to pluripotency requires a shift from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism. Here, we show that this shift occurs early during reprogramming of human cells and requires hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) in a stage-specific manner. HIF1α and HIF2α are both necessary to initiate this metabolic switch and for the acquisition of pluripotency, and the stabilization of either protein during early phases of reprogramming is sufficient to induce the switch to glycolytic metabolism. In contrast, stabilization of HIF2α during later stages represses reprogramming, partly because of the upregulation of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). TRAIL inhibits induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation by repressing apoptotic caspase 3 activity specifically in cells undergoing reprogramming but not human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and inhibiting TRAIL activity enhances human iPSC generation. These results shed light on the mechanisms underlying the metabolic shifts associated with the acquisition of a pluripotent identity during reprogramming."

https://openalex.org/W2029565084,"Using subcellular patch-clamp axonal recordings in rat hippocampal slices, this study describes the physiological properties of action potential (AP) initiation and propagation in parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic interneurons/basket cells (BCs). Hu and Jonas also show a gradual increase in Na+ conductance along the BC axon away from the soma, and that this differential distribution of sodium conductance along the small-diameter axons can ensure fast and reliable AP propagation to account for the unique functions of these interneurons. Fast-spiking, parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic interneurons, a large proportion of which are basket cells (BCs), have a key role in feedforward and feedback inhibition, gamma oscillations and complex information processing. For these functions, fast propagation of action potentials (APs) from the soma to the presynaptic terminals is important. However, the functional properties of interneuron axons remain elusive. We examined interneuron axons by confocally targeted subcellular patch-clamp recording in rat hippocampal slices. APs were initiated in the proximal axon ∼20 μm from the soma and propagated to the distal axon with high reliability and speed. Subcellular mapping revealed a stepwise increase of Na+ conductance density from the soma to the proximal axon, followed by a further gradual increase in the distal axon. Active cable modeling and experiments with partial channel block revealed that low axonal Na+ conductance density was sufficient for reliability, but high Na+ density was necessary for both speed of propagation and fast-spiking AP phenotype. Our results suggest that a supercritical density of Na+ channels compensates for the morphological properties of interneuron axons (small segmental diameter, extensive branching and high bouton density), ensuring fast AP propagation and high-frequency repetitive firing."

Optimal choices require information to be evaluated appropriately and combined without loss (Ernst and Banks, 2002Ernst M.O. Banks M.S.

For example, an accurate medical diagnosis is made by considering all of the relevant symptoms, weighting each by the reliability with which it predicts a suspected condition. This intuition forms a mainstay of philosophical reflections on decision-making (Peirce, 1878Peirce C.S. The probability of induction.Popular Science Monthly. 1878; 12: 705-718Google Scholar) and is formalized in mathematically optimal models of choice behavior, such as those based on serial integration of likelihoods (Ma et al., 2006Ma W.J.

However, unlike psychophysical judgments of stationary sensory signals, real-world choices (such as those faced by medical practitioners) often require the integration of variable, heterogeneous, or otherwise incommensurable information. Linear integration of highly variable information on an absolute scale poses a challenge for the nervous system, because it requires coding units to represent information across a broad dynamic range. One efficient solution is to encode information relative to the local context by adapting the gain of neuronal firing to the range of information available over the short or long term (Barlow, 1961Barlow H. Possible principles underlying the transformation of sensory messages.in: Rosenblith W.A. Sensory Communication. MIT Press, Cambridge1961Google Scholar, Carandini and Heeger, 2012Carandini M.

For example, the visual system adapts to light levels over the diurnal cycle (Bartlett, 1965Bartlett N.R. Dark and light adaptation.in: Graham C.H. Vision and Visual Perception. John Wiley and Sons, New York1965Google Scholar) or to stimulus contrast over the recent trial history (Greenlee and Heitger, 1988Greenlee M.W. Heitger F. The functional role of contrast adaptation.Vision Res. 1988; 28: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In cortical neurons, adaptation is mediated both by habituation (Carandini and Ferster, 1997Carandini M. Ferster D. A tonic hyperpolarization underlying contrast adaptation in cat visual cortex.Science. 1997; 276: 949-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and by normalization mechanisms that scale the response of a neuron by that of its neighbors (Carandini and Heeger, 2012Carandini M.

Beyond the sensory cortices, adaptive mechanisms may allow relative coding of utility, leaving economic choices vulnerable to the influence of local context (Louie and Glimcher, 2012Louie K.

However, adaptive gain control has been overlooked in canonical models of information integration during perceptual choice (Bogacz et al., 2006Bogacz R. Brown E. Moehlis J. Holmes P. Cohen J.D.

The diffusion decision model: theory and data for two-choice decision tasks.Neural Comput. 2008; 20: 873-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). Here, we describe a serial sampling model of perceptual choice in which the gain of information processing adapts rapidly to the changing statistics of the environment. We used this adaptive gain model to understand the behavior of humans categorizing a rapid stream of visual gratings on the basis of their angle of orientation. Humans performing this task exhibited two suboptimal biases in choice behavior, reflected in the impact that each grating (“sample”) wielded over the eventual decision. First, samples that carried similar decision information to their predecessor wielded greater influence on choice, even independent of their physical appearance (consistency bias). Second, samples that occurred later in the stream were also more diagnostic of choice (recency bias; Tsetsos et al., 2012bTsetsos K. Gao J. McClelland J.L. Usher M. Using Time-Varying Evidence to Test Models of Decision Dynamics: Bounded Diffusion vs. the Leaky Competing Accumulator Model.Front. Neurosci. 2012; 6: 79Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Simulations reveal that these two biases are both predicted by the adaptive gain model. Moreover, the gain of encoding of decision information in pupil diameter and in cortical brain responses followed tightly the predictions of the model. These findings provide evidence for remarkably rapid and flexible gain control during decision making, define limits on the optimality of human judgment, and place a strong constraint on computational models of perceptual choice. Consider a task in which observers view a fixed number of discrete samples of evidence occurring in succession (see Figure 1B), with each sample k characterized by decision update DUk that can vary continuously between −1 and +1. The observers’ task is to judge whether the aggregate information ΣDUk is greater or less than zero. This “expanded judgment” task is sometimes known as the weather prediction task (Poldrack et al., 2001Poldrack R.A. Clark J. Paré-Blagoev E.J. Shohamy D. Creso Moyano J. Myers C. Gluck M.A. Interactive memory systems in the human brain.Nature. 2001; 414: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, Yang and Shadlen, 2007Yang T. Shadlen M.N. Probabilistic reasoning by neurons.Nature. 2007; 447: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In this task, the optimal policy is to integrate the log-likelihood ratio associated with each sample, which is equivalent to basing choices on the sum of decision values ΣDUk. The adaptive gain model proposes that each decision update passes through a nonlinear (sigmoidal) transfer function f:DUˆk=f(DUk|xk−1,σ)(Equation 1) where xk corresponds to the point of maximal gain during processing of sample k and σ corresponds to the shallowness of the nonlinearity (step-like for σ = >0, linear for σ = >∞). A formal description of the transfer function is given in the Supplemental Information available online (Figure S2). In the adaptive gain model, after each sample k, the point of maximal gain xk is updated according to the feature information provided by sample k using a delta rule with learning rate α:xk=xk−1+α⋅(DUk−xk−1)(Equation 2) Thus, after each sample k, the inflection point xk of the transfer function f is progressively adjusted toward the current expectation of the sampling distribution (Figure 1B). Because the gradient of the transfer function is steepest at this point, samples arriving at, or close to, this point will be most diagnostic of choice. One important corollary of this model is that, across samples, observers become most influenced by information with the highest probability of occurrence. Figure S1A displays how the shape of the transfer function adapts for variations in inflection point xk and σ. Finally, the output decision updates are subjected to a noisy sum with signal-to-noise ratio β and compared to a fixed category boundary falling at −β0 (zero for the ideal observer):P(respond>0)=Φ(β⋅∑k=18DUˆk+β0)(Equation 3) where P(respond > 0) corresponds to the model-predicted probability of responding that the sequence is greater than zero and Φ() corresponds to the probit decision rule, i.e., the Gaussian cumulative density function. The choice of this decision rule is motivated by the idea that each sample of evidence DUk is corrupted by additive Gaussian noise whose SD relates inversely to the corresponding β parameter. We generated simulated streams of eight samples of evidence (range: −1:1) and asked the model to classify them. For illustration, we began with an arbitrary set of parameters (β = 1; σ = 0.5; α = 0.5). The point of maximal gain xk was initialized to zero and updated according to Equation 2. When decisions are made on the basis of multiple samples of evidence, decisions may rely more heavily on the information provided by some samples than others. We thus used logistic regression to characterize the impact that each sample had on binary choices made by the model (and, subsequently, humans). Our regression model comprised a total of 15 predictors in addition to an intercept term. The first eight predictors encoded the decision information for each of the eight samples (DUk) in order of occurrence, with the resulting coefficients (we call these “sample” coefficients) wk reflecting the weight that each of the eight successive samples wielded over the choice. The subsequent predictors and resulting coefficients wδk were aimed at identifying how information in samples 2–8 was upweighted or downweighted as a function of its disparity with previous information. To this end, we defined a new quantity δ(DU)k that encoded the absolute dissimilarity in decision information between each sample (excluding the first) and its predecessor (we set δ(DU)0 = 0):δ(DU)k=|DUk−DUk−1|(Equation 4) Predictors 9–15 encoded the interaction between DUk and δ(DU)k. The coefficients associated with these predictors (we call these “consistency” coefficients) would be positive if dissimilarity between successive samples led to upweighting and negative if dissimilarity led to downweighting. Thus, the full regression model, including the two per-sample predictors described above, was defined as follows:P(respond>0)=Φ(∑k=18(wk+wkδ⋅δ(DU)k)⋅DUk+β0)(Equation 5) For the simulated data, the estimated sample coefficients wk, and consistency coefficients wδk are plotted against their corresponding sample k in Figure 2A (left panel). These simulations reveal two clear predictions made by the adaptive gain model. First, although sample coefficients are all positive, indicating that each contributed to the decision, those for later samples are more positive than those for earlier samples—a “recency” bias (Figure 2A, left panel; blue circles). The adaptive gain model thus predicts that later-occurring evidence will carry more weight in the decision. In the model, this occurs because the inflection point of the transfer function takes some time to converge to the mean of the sampling distribution, and so later-occurring samples will, on average, be more likely to fall in zone of maximum gain, where samples are more diagnostic of choice. Second, “consistency” coefficients were all negative (Figure 2A, left panel; green circles). Thus, the model predicts that observers will tend to disregard samples that differ strongly from their predecessor, because on average these will fall further from the inflection point of the adapting likelihood function. We call this a “consistency bias,” as it reflects the difficulty of evaluating successive samples with respect to a common standard. For comparison, in Figure 2A (right panel), we include the predictions of a “static” model, which is identical in all respects except that the learning rate α is set to zero (β = 1; σ = 0.5; α = 0). This model reduces to a standard psychophysical model with a nonlinear transfer function (Naka and Rushton, 1966Naka K.I. Rushton W.A. S-potentials from colour units in the retina of fish (Cyprinidae).J. Physiol. 1966; 185: 536-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). As can be seen, the coefficients wk associated with DUk (encoding the weight given to each sample; blue triangles) are positive but do not increase over time, yielding no recency bias. Moreover, the coefficients wδk associated with DUk ⋅ δ(DU)k (encoding the up- or downweighting of samples 2–8; green triangles) are close to zero, revealing no consistency bias. Thus, the effects described in Figure 2A (left panel) depend on the adaptation of the transfer function across samples. Next, we verified that these predictions are not specific to the parameterization chosen above. In Figure 2C, we summarize these two biases for values of σ and α in the range −1:1, setting the signal-to-noise level (β) to 1 (adding different levels of noise had no qualitative effect on these predictions). In the left panel, we calculate the recency bias as the difference between sample coefficients for late (DU5–8) and early (DU1–4) samples and plot this summary measure for differing values of σ and α. Of note, these are positive for values of α > 0 (red/yellow shading), showing that the recency bias holds whenever the transfer function is updated toward the current expectation. By contrast, they are negative (showing a primacy effect) for values of α < 0, i.e., when the transfer function is updated away from the current expectation. This ability to predict primacy and recency shows the generality of the model and potential to capture a range of different weighting profiles, under distinct parameterizations. In the right panel, we show the average of the seven consistency coefficients under different parameterizations. Similarly, these are all negative for values of α > 0 (blue/cyan shading). The adaptive model displays both recency and consistency biases for a range of σ values, maximal as σ approaches 0 (i.e., when the transfer function is most step-like), whereas the static model fails to display either of these biases (Figure 2B). Together, these simulations show that the recency and consistency biases do not depend on specific values of σ or α (α > 0) and that both biases can be reversed via the introduction of a negative learning rate, which shifts the point of maximum gain away from the expectation of the sampling distribution. We tested the predictions of the adaptive gain model by asking 23 healthy human observers to classify a stream of eight visual gratings (presented at 4 Hz) as more “cardinal” or “diagonal,” providing feedback according to their aggregate decision update value (Figure 1A). The decision update for each sample k (the quantity that we term DUk) depended nonlinearly on angle of orientation, with gratings whose orientation was closer to 0° or 90° providing evidence for one response and those closer to 45° or −45° contributing evidence in favor of the opposite response (Figure S1B; Supplemental Information). This task has the appealing property that decision updates are orthogonal to perceptual information, because very different angles (e.g., 10° and 80°) offer the same decision information, allowing us to distinguish any sequential effects in decision making from low-level perceptual priming (Wyart et al., 2012aWyart V. de Gardelle V. Scholl J. Summerfield C. Rhythmic fluctuations in evidence accumulation during decision making in the human brain.Neuron. 2012; 76: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) (the independence of DUk from perceptual information is shown in Figure S1B). Participants responded with a key press following presentation of all eight samples, allowing us to test (using the regression-based approach described in Equation 5) for the presence of recency and consistency biases predicted by the adaptive gain model. Using the regression approach described above to assess the impact that each sample had on human decisions, coefficients were less positive for early (k < 5) than late (k > 4) samples (Figure 3A, left panel; blue circles; t(22) = 5.38; p < 0.001). Consistency coefficients for items 2–8 were on average negative-going (Figure 3A, left panel; green circles; t(22) = 2.05; p < 0.05). Thus, human participants showed both the recency and consistency biases predicted by the model. Furthermore, the human data also reveal the existence of a “belief compatibility” bias, reflecting the compatibility with the running average of the sequence, which displays the same qualitative pattern as the consistency bias and which is also predicted by the adaptive gain model (see Supplemental Information for details and Figure S3). Additionally, the recency and consistency biases displayed by human participants were present in both early and late periods of the experiment (Figure S3) and did not depend on knowledge of the sequence length, as demonstrated in an additional behavioral experiment (Figure S3). We fit the adaptive gain model to the data by searching for the parameterization that best predicted human choices given the input sequence (values of DUk), i.e., maximizing the model log-likelihood corresponding to the probability of a model using a set of generative parameters β, σ, and α to have produced the observed behavioral data. Details of this Bayesian model fitting approach are described in full in the Supplemental Information. Model choices obtained using the resulting maximum likelihood parameters (β = 0.63; σ = 0.67; and α = 0.26) were then subjected to the same regression analyses as human data and are overlaid on Figure 3A (solid blue and green lines). As can be seen, the model is able to capture the recency and consistency biases both qualitatively and quantitatively. The regression analysis yields 15 parameter estimates (Figure 3A), and model predictions fall within the 95% confidence intervals produced by the human behavioral data for all but four of them. Additionally, we searched exhaustively over different values of the three parameters σ, β, and α for the model parameterization that minimized the difference with the human regression coefficients (dashed blue and green lines in Figure 3A). The resulting parameters (β = 0.7; σ = 0.63; and α = 0.2) provided an equally good fit to the human data. The statistically significant recency and consistency biases in human behavior militate in favor of the adaptive gain model over its static counterparts. However, to compare these models more formally, fitting the static model to the data using the same maximum likelihood criteria described above produced a poorer fit compared to its adaptive model counterpart (shown in Figure S3; Supplemental Information), even when the extra parameter was taken into account by using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) (see Experimental Procedures). In addition, directly comparing the residual mean squared error (MSE) between behavioral parameter estimates for each subject and model predictions, we found that the adaptive model was a significantly better fit to the data than its static counterpart (t(22) = 4.12; p < 0.0005). This comparison shows that the adjustment of the slope of the transfer function alone is not sufficient to account for the biases observed in human choice behavior. The failure of the static model to account for human performance also demonstrates the suboptimality of integration in our task, because the static model describes the performance of a Bayesian ideal observer with or without input noise (Figure S2 and text).

Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) have pointed to pupil diameter as a correlate of the gain of information processing during decision making. Pupil diameter is partly driven by arousal-linked changes in the neural response of the locus coeruleus, which in turn modulates cortical activity via diffuse noradrenergic projections (Usher et al., 1999Usher M. Cohen J.D. Servan-Schreiber D. Rajkowski J. Aston-Jones G. The role of locus coeruleus in the regulation of cognitive performance.Science. 1999; 283: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). We thus turned to pupillometric data recorded during experiment 1 to investigate how moment-by-moment changes in pupil diameter following the presentation of sample k were predicted by its decision information DUk and how this correlation was modulated by consistency between current and previous sample δ(DU)k. Pupil diameter changes slowly in response to cognitive and attentional factors, typically peaking 1 to 2 s poststimulus, but its subsecond fluctuations can be disambiguated using a linear regression approach similar to that often employed to model the sluggish blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response (Nassar et al., 2012Nassar M.R.

Pupil dilation: a fingerprint of temporal selection during the “attentional blink”.Front. Psychol. 2012; 3: 316Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Having successfully recorded pupil diameter from 20 of the 23 participants, we created a regression model in which the pupil response at each time point t following sample k was modeled as a linear combination of |DUk| (reflecting the strength of the current evidence sample, associated with coefficients wk,dt) and |DUk| ⋅ δ(DU)k (reflecting how the neural encoding of evidence strength depends on its consistency with the previous evidence sample, associated with coefficients wk,dt δ):pupil(tk+dt)=(wk,dt+wk,dtδ⋅δ(DU)k)⋅|DUk|+wdtsum⋅|∑j=18DUj|+ϵdt(Equation 6) where pupil(tk + dt) is the normalized and base-lined pupil size at time dt following the onset of sample k (the final term encodes the mean decision information on that trial, ensuring that fluctuations in pupil diameter reflect sample-specific changes in DUk and not the global difficulty of the trial). The coefficients of this regression across time provide the time course of encoding of decision information in pupillometric signals (wk,dt) and the modulation of this encoding by the consistency of decision information contained in consecutive samples (wδk,dt). The evidence contained in the first sample (DU1) was excluded from the analysis to avoid interference from possible transient responses at the beginning of the sequence, unrelated to the decision update. These encoding functions, averaged across samples, are plotted in blue and green, respectively, in Figure 4B. Pupil diameter tended to grow with increasing decision information, with a peak in encoding at 1,140 ms after sample onset (t(19) = 3.5; p < 0.001; blue trace). Critically, however, and consistent with behavioral findings, this encoding was negatively modulated by the difference to the previous sample δ(DU)k—samples whose predecessor provided very different decision information were encoded more weakly in pupillary signals. This is shown by plotting the coefficients (wδk,dt) associated with DUk · δ(DU)k, which diverged negatively from zero (Figure 4B; green trace; maximum significance at 2,000 ms after sample onset; t(19) = 3.0; p < 0.004). In other words, pupillary responses track fluctuations in the strength of decision evidence and the reduced gain of information processing when evidence is inconsistent with its predecessor, that mirror those observed in behavior and are predicted by the adaptive gain model. Demonstrating this effect another way, in Figure 4C, we plotted the encoding of DUk in pupil responses separately for samples with small and large values of δ(DU)k, i.e., that were similar/dissimilar to the previous sample based on a median split. Encoding was stronger when samples were more similar (full blue line) than when they were different (faded blue line). Previous models have accounted for recency effects in perceptual categorization by assuming that integration is leaky, with information dissipating gradually across the choice period ("

In zebrafish, rotational stimuli need to be distinguished from translational stimuli to drive the optokinetic and the optomotor responses, respectively. Here, we systematically characterize the neural circuits responsible for these operations using a combination of optogenetic manipulation and in vivo calcium imaging during optic flow stimulation. By recording the activity of thousands of neurons within the area pretectalis (APT), we find four bilateral pairs of clusters that process horizontal whole-field motion and functionally classify eleven prominent neuron types with highly selective response profiles. APT neurons are prevalently direction selective, either monocularly or binocularly driven, and hierarchically organized to distinguish between rotational and translational optic flow. Our data predict a wiring diagram of a neural circuit tailored to drive behavior that compensates for self-motion."

Here, we used intrinsic connectivity analyses and showed that the brain networks differentially vulnerable to each disease converge to the hippocampus in the healthy brain. As neurodegeneration is thought to spread within preexisting networks, the common hippocampal atrophy in both diseases is likely due to its location at the crossroad between both vulnerable networks. Yet, we showed that in the normal brain, these networks harbor different functions, with episodic memory relying on the AD-vulnerable network only. Overall, disease-associated cognitive deficits seem to reflect the disruption of targeted networks more than atrophy in specific brain regions: in AD, over hippocampal atrophy, episodic memory deficits are likely due to disconnection within a memory-related network."

Here we identify homozygous mutations in the TDP2 gene encoding tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase-2, an enzyme that repairs 'abortive' TOP2-induced DSBs, in individuals with intellectual disability, seizures and ataxia. We show that cells from affected individuals are hypersensitive to TOP2-induced DSBs and that loss of TDP2 inhibits TOP2-dependent gene transcription in cultured human cells and in mouse post-mitotic neurons following abortive TOP2 activity. Notably, TDP2 is also required for normal levels of many gene transcripts in developing mouse brain, including numerous gene transcripts associated with neurological function and/or disease, and for normal interneuron density in mouse cerebellum. Collectively, these data implicate chromosome breakage by TOP2 as an endogenous threat to gene transcription and to normal neuronal development and maintenance."

Similar synaptic modifications of electrical coupling are likely to occur in other brain regions, where rapid modification of the spatiotemporal features of the coupled networks is needed to adequately respond to behavioral demands. Electrical synapses, formed by gap junctions (GJs), enable current flow between neurons (Bennett and Zukin, 2004Bennett M.V. Zukin R.S.

Long M.A. Electrical synapses in the mammalian brain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 393-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Electrical communication occurs in all major regions of the CNS (Condorelli et al., 2003Condorelli D.F. Trovato-Salinaro A. Mudò G. Mirone M.B. Belluardo N.

As oscillations are modulated according to behavioral states, the electrical synapses mediating them should be precisely controlled. Although changes in GJ coupling by neuromodulators has been implicated (Hatton, 1998Hatton G.I. Synaptic modulation of neuronal coupling.Cell Biol. Int. 1998; 22: 765-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), physiological demonstrations of synaptic modulation has only been sporadically reported (Haas et al., 2011Haas J.S. Zavala B.

One of the first examples of GJ communication within the mammalian brain is the IO, which together with the cerebellar cortex and cerebellar nuclei (CN), forms a tripartite loop known as the cerebellar module (Cerminara and Apps, 2011Cerminara N.L.

Neural Circuits. 2012; 6: 91Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The mechanism of IO oscillations is still being debated, with three different schemes being considered. In the first one, IO neurons are intrinsic oscillators and interneuronal communication serves to synchronize the oscillations. In the second scheme, the intrinsic properties of IO neurons support only transient (dampening) oscillations and a stable network oscillation emerges from reciprocal interactions between neurons. Finally, these two possibilities could be combined into a third scheme where the network consists of both types of neurons.

Almost 40 years ago Rodolfo Llinás, inspired by this special arrangement, suggested that the strength of the GJ coupling between IO neurons is modulated by synaptic inputs that act as a shunt, essentially short-circuiting the GJ current (Llinás, 1974Llinás R. Eighteenth Bowditch lecture. Motor aspects of cerebellar control.Physiologist. 1974; 17: 19-46PubMed Google Scholar). Although the GJ conductance is unchanged, the strength of electrical coupling between the neurons (measured as the coupling coefficient [CC]) is reduced. Such modulation of electrical coupling that directly affects synchronicity of IO activity is likely to play a prominent role in conceptual models of cerebellar function. Despite this possibly critical role, uncoupling of IO neurons by NO inputs has never been directly examined. In this study, we transfected NO neurons with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) to examine their role in modulating IO activity. We found that activation of NO axons terminating on distal dendritic sites reduces the strength of GJ coupling between IO neurons and blocks STOs. These observations are in agreement with the hypothesis that GJ coupling and network oscillations within the IO, and thus PN spiking, are modulated by CN activity. To obtain specific expression of ChR2 in the axons of GABAergic NO neurons, a viral vector carrying a cre-inducible ChR2/mCherry fusion gene was injected into the lateral CN in Gad2-Cre mice; in a subset of experiments, a nonspecific ChR2-EYFP was similarly introduced into wild-type mice (see Experimental Procedures). Since we did not find differences in the transfection pattern of NO axons in the IO or in the responses to light stimulation using either of these expression systems, the data were pooled for analysis. As shown in Figures 1A–1C, the viral injection resulted in ChR2 expression in the CN after a transfection period of 4–6 weeks. The transfected neurons were small and globular in shape (Figure 1C), which is well in agreement with previous studies describing the morphology of the GABAergic CN neurons (De Zeeuw et al., 1997De Zeeuw C.I. Van Alphen A.M. Hawkins R.K. Ruigrok T.J.

Examination of the IO at high magnification (Figure 1E) reveals that the labeling is restricted to NO axons. Although labeling was found bilaterally in the IO, it was much sparser on the ipsilateral side (Figure 1F), in line with the crossed arrangement of the NO projection. Importantly, no labeled cell bodies were found on either side of the IO; rather, the IO neurons were seen as dark shapes (asterisks in Figure 1E) surrounded by fluorescent axonal processes. Depending on the extent of transfected region within the CN, distribution of labeled regions within the IO varied (as shown in Figure 1G; n = 16). Without exception, the principal olive was most strongly and consistently labeled (areas marked with bright colors) and thus the experiments were conducted mainly in this region. The subcellular localization of inhibitory inputs is a critical determinant of their physiological significance (Gidon and Segev, 2012Gidon A. Segev I. Principles governing the operation of synaptic inhibition in dendrites.Neuron. 2012; 75: 330-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We examined the location of NO axon swellings (putative NO terminals) on dendrites of IO neurons. Six IO neurons in the virus-injected mice were filled with a green fluorescent marker (Alexa Fluor 488) during patch-clamp experiments. Confocal image stacks were acquired from postfixed slices (Figure 2A) and the IO neurons were reconstructed (Figures 2B and 2C). The high expression level of the ChR2/mCherry in NO axonal terminals permitted their partial reconstruction and estimation of the relative density of NO contacts among dendrites and somata (Figures 2D and 2E). In line with earlier observations (De Zeeuw et al., 1989De Zeeuw C.I. Holstege J.C. Ruigrok T.J. Voogd J.

Comp. Neurol. 1986; 252: 32-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the density of contacts was 5.3 ± 1.0 times higher on the dendrites than on somata (p < 0.01; n = 6 cells; Figures 2D and 2E). In pairs of reconstructed IO neurons, we occasionally found sites where the dendrites of two neurons were extremely close, suggestive of possible GJ sites. Notably, these sites seemed to be contacted by labeled terminals. An example of such case is shown in Figure 2D (top). Using these virus-injected mice, we set to explore the role of the NO connection in the IO and its effects on GJ coupling and STOs. Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) were readily evoked by light stimulation in all 204 recorded neurons situated within the densely labeled IO regions. Light pulses as short as 5 ms were sufficient to elicit a relatively slow hyperpolarizing response (Figure 3A) that reached peak value of 5.7 ± 3.3 mV within 36.6 ± 16.9 ms and decayed with a duration at half-amplitude of 122 ± 32 ms (see Figures 3B–3D). The response was usually followed by a slow depolarizing component, probably resulting from activation of the low-threshold calcium current or the h-current (see also arrow in Figure 4A; Bal and McCormick, 1997Bal T. McCormick D.A. Synchronized oscillations in the inferior olive are controlled by the hyperpolarization-activated cation current I(h).J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 77: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, Choi et al., 2010Choi S. Yu E. Kim D. Urbano F.J. Makarenko V. Shin H.S. Llinás R.R.

Physiol. 2010; 588: 3031-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The IPSPs, which were completely blocked by gabazine and TTX (Figures S1A and S1B available online), depended on both the location and the intensity of the light pulse (Figures S1C and S1D). The IPSPs were unaffected by the duration of the light pulse up to 20 ms (Figure 3A, n = 3), suggesting that they represent the responses to a single light-evoked action potential (AP). Indeed, extracellular recordings from transfected axons in the IO (Figures S2A and S2B) showed that a 5–200 ms light pulse evokes only one AP. Thus, the postsynaptic responses are strictly dependent on presynaptic spiking and cannot be evoked by light-activated depolarization of the presynaptic terminal alone. The relatively wide distribution of the IPSP amplitudes (Figure 3B) is most likely due to the variability in number of light-activated fibers. The prolonged rise time (Figure 3C) probably results from a combination of factors. Among them are the remote location of the synapses, the asynchronous release of GABA from the NO terminals (Best and Regehr, 2009Best A.R. Regehr W.G. Inhibitory regulation of electrically coupled neurons in the inferior olive is mediated by asynchronous release of GABA.Neuron. 2009; 62: 555-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and the asynchronous activation of the NO axons by the light pulse (Figure S2A). The majority of CN neurons are known to be spontaneously active (Uusisaari et al., 2007Uusisaari M. Obata K. Knöpfel T. Morphological and electrophysiological properties of GABAergic and non-GABAergic cells in the deep cerebellar nuclei.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). As there are scarce reports that NO neurons are capable of spontaneous firing, we used trains of light stimulation that possibly are comparable to what occur in vivo. Indeed, the light-activated synaptic responses showed temporal summation (Figure 3E) with individual IPSPs merging into a smooth hyperpolarization when evoked at frequencies of 17–19 Hz. At trains with higher frequencies, the responses reached a peak within 150 ms and then repolarized to lower amplitude (Figure 3E, lowest trace; see also Figure S3C). Therefore, when a train of light pulses was used to examine the effect of the NO input, we adjusted the frequency and duration of the pulses to obtain a smooth steady-state-like response (Figures 3E and 3F). Notably, regardless of stimulation frequency, the response to light decayed within ∼200 ms. As shown in the example in Figure 4A, as the membrane voltage (Vm) was hyperpolarized by somatic current injection, the IPSP amplitude decreased together with an enhancement of the slow depolarizing component (arrow in Figure 4A). However, even at very hyperpolarized membrane potentials (up to −97 mV), the IPSPs did not reverse. Reversal potential (Erev) could not be attained in any of the eight neurons where the voltage dependency of the IPSP was examined. These results, which disagree with both the calculated Cl− equilibrium potential (−88 mV) and our previous measurements of the GABA reversal potential (−58 to −68 mV; Devor et al., 2001Devor A. Fritschy J.M. Yarom Y. Spatial distribution and subunit composition of GABA(A) receptors in the inferior olivary nucleus.J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 85: 1686-1696PubMed Google Scholar), probably reflect the very distal location of the activated synapses. We further examined the IPSP voltage dependence during the spontaneous subthreshold oscillations (STOs). As shown in Figure 4B, the IPSP amplitude depended on Vm during oscillation. The evoked synaptic events were largest and smallest when the light pulse coincided with the peak (top trace) and trough (third trace) of the oscillation, respectively. When the IPSP amplitudes were plotted as a function of Vm (see Experimental Procedures and inset in Figure 4C), we found that these two parameters are linearly correlated, yielding a slope of 1.04 (R2 = 0.85). Importantly, we found that the IPSP amplitude, which is independent of the direction of voltage change, is linearly related to this slope (see Discussion and Figure S3). When normalized by input resistance, the slope also provides an estimate of the light-evoked conductance change (see Experimental Procedures). However, one should bear in mind that the precise input resistance at synaptic sites is unknown. Furthermore, a single NO axon is likely to activate receptors both on dendritic spines and shafts, which are bound to have different input resistance. As our measurements reflect the population response, the estimation of synaptic conductance is an approximation. Using a plausible value for input resistance at dendritic spines (500 MΩ; Harnett et al., 2012Harnett M.T. Makara J.K. Spruston N. Kath W.L. Magee J.C. Synaptic amplification by dendritic spines enhances input cooperativity.Nature. 2012; 491: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), a slope of 1.04 corresponds to a conductance change of 2.1 nS. An average slope of 0.79 ± 0.22 (n = 16 cells) translates to 1.1–2 nS conductance change, in line with values reported in other systems (Person and Raman, 2012Person A.L. Raman I.M. Purkinje neuron synchrony elicits time-locked spiking in the cerebellar nuclei.Nature. 2012; 481: 502-505Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar, Zeng and Tietz, 2000Zeng X.J. Tietz E.I. Role of bicarbonate ion in mediating decreased synaptic conductance in benzodiazepine tolerant hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.Brain Res. 2000; 868: 202-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Extrapolating the IPSP amplitude-to-Vm relationship in Figure 4C gives Erev of −62.3 mV. Measuring the reversal potential in this manner in the 16 cells revealed an average Erev with a narrow variance (−63.6 ± 2.1 mV) that was independent of the IPSP amplitude-to-Vm slope (Figure S3D). Notably, correct measurement of IPSP amplitude during an ongoing Vm oscillation must evade several pitfalls, which we consider in the Discussion. The observation that the Erev measured during somatic current injection and during STOs are different suggests that only part of the somatic current injection reaches the distal NO synaptic sites. This is further supported by the small reduction in input resistance during NO activation (down to 0.92 ± 0.07 of control; p < 0.001; Figures 4D and 4E; n = 45 cells) and its negligible effect on the rebound spike (black arrow in Figure 4D). The electrical coupling between IO neurons and its modulation by NO input was quantified with simultaneous recordings from two IO neurons (see inset in Figure 5A). Current pulses were injected either to cell 1 (left) or cell 2 (right). To examine the effect of the NO input on the CC, we injected a current step during a light-evoked steady-state-like response, recorded the postjunctional response, and subtracted the light-evoked component from the overall response. The CC was calculated as the ratio between the pre- and postjunctional voltage responses to current injection (see Experimental Procedures). Overall, electrical coupling was observed in 26 out of 39 recorded pairs. In agreement with previous reports (Devor and Yarom, 2002aDevor A. Yarom Y.

Wild-type cells are co-opted into new hair growths by β-catenin mutant cells, which non-cell autonomously activate Wnt signaling within the neighboring wild-type cells via Wnt ligands.

Here, we provide a direct demonstration of receptor-mediated strengthening of electrical coupling in mammalian brain. Electrical coupling in the inferior olive of rats was strengthened by activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs), which were found at synaptic loci and at extrasynaptic loci 20-100 nm proximal to gap junctions. Electrical coupling was strengthened by pharmacological and synaptic activation of NMDARs, whereas costimulation of ionotropic non-NMDAR glutamate receptors transiently antagonized the effect of NMDAR activation. NMDAR-dependent strengthening (1) occurred despite increased input conductance, (2) induced Ca(2+)-influx microdomains near dendritic spines, (3) required activation of the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein-kinase II, (4) was restricted to neurons that were weakly coupled, and (5) thus strengthened coupling, mainly between nonadjacent neurons.

(p. 1350 ) found that crow nests containing a cuckoo chick had lower rates of predation because the parasite's chicks secrete a noxious repellent substance.

We demonstrate that this plasticity is not triggered by postsynaptic spiking alone and that it requires calcium entry following synaptic NMDA receptor activation.

The behavior of the linker mutants revealed a correlation between the ability of the C2 domains to penetrate membranes in response to Ca(2+) and to drive evoked neurotransmitter release in cultured mouse neurons, uncovering a step in excitation-secretion coupling. Using atomic force microscopy, we found that the synergy between these C2 domains involved intra-molecular interactions between them. Thus, syt function is markedly affected by changes in the physical nature of the linker that connects its tandem C2 domains. Moreover, the linker mutations uncoupled syt-mediated regulation of evoked and spontaneous release, revealing that syt also acts as a fusion clamp before the Ca(2+) trigger."

This approach, aided by protein design and crystallography, is now used to synthesize an antiretroviral nucleoside analog and surprisingly identifies a new enzyme function. Concatenation of engineered biocatalysts into multistep pathways markedly increases their utility, but the development of generalizable assembly methods remains a major challenge. Herein we evaluate 'bioretrosynthesis', which is an application of the retrograde evolution hypothesis, for biosynthetic pathway construction. To test bioretrosynthesis, we engineered a pathway for synthesis of the antiretroviral nucleoside analog didanosine (2′,3′-dideoxyinosine). Applying both directed evolution– and structure-based approaches, we began pathway construction with a retro-extension from an engineered purine nucleoside phosphorylase and evolved 1,5-phosphopentomutase to accept the substrate 2,3-dideoxyribose 5-phosphate with a 700-fold change in substrate selectivity and threefold increased turnover in cell lysate. A subsequent retrograde pathway extension, via ribokinase engineering, resulted in a didanosine pathway with a 9,500-fold change in nucleoside production selectivity and 50-fold increase in didanosine production. Unexpectedly, the result of this bioretrosynthetic step was not a retro-extension from phosphopentomutase but rather the discovery of a fortuitous pathway-shortening bypass via the engineered ribokinase."
https://openalex.org/W2087399086,"The obesity epidemic has resulted in a large increase in type 2 diabetes (T2D). While some secondary complications of T2D are well recognized and their cellular and molecular mechanisms are defined, the impact of T2D on the musculoskeletal system is less understood. Clinical evidence suggests that tendon strength and repair are compromised. Here, a mouse model of obesity and T2D recapitulates the deleterious effects of this condition on tendon repair.Male C57BL/6J mice at 5 weeks of age were placed on a high fat (HF)(60% kcal) or low fat (10% kcal) diet for 12 weeks. The flexor digitorum longus (FDL) tendon was then injured by puncturing it with a beveled needle. Progression of FDL tendon healing was assessed through biomechanical and histological analysis at 0, 7, 14 and 28 days post-injury.HF-fed mice displayed increased body weight and elevated fasting glucose levels, both consistent with T2D. No differences in biomechanical properties of the uninjured FDL tendon were observed after 12 weeks on HF versus lean diets, but decreased maximum force in uninjured tendons from HF-fed mice was observed at 24 weeks. Following puncture injury, tendons from HF-fed mice displayed impaired biomechanical properties at day 28 post injury. In support of defective repair in the HF-fed mice, histological examination of the injury site showed a smaller area of repair and lower cell content in the repair area of HF-fed mice. Insulin receptors were expressed in most cells at the injury site regardless of diet.The HF-diet mouse model of obesity and T2D reproduces the impaired tendon healing that is observed in this patient population. The exact mechanism is unknown, but we hypothesize that a cellular defect, perhaps involving insulin resistance, leads to decreased proliferation or recruitment to the injury site, and ultimately contributes to defective tendon healing."

Using a pathophysiologically relevant murine model, we here investigated a role for the biological clock - molecular core circadian genes (CCG) in the generation of NAFPD. Design Female C57BL6 mice were fed an obesogenic diet (OD) or standard chow (SC) for 6 weeks, prior to pregnancy and throughout gestation and lactation: resulting offspring were subsequently weaned onto either OD (Ob_Ob and Con_Ob) or standard chow (Ob_Con and Con_Con) for 6 months. Biochemical, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic markers associated with NAFPD were then evaluated and CCG mRNA expression in the pancreas determined. Results Offspring of obese dams weaned on to OD (Ob_Ob) had significantly increased (p≤0.05): bodyweight, pancreatic triglycerides, macrovesicular pancreatic fatty-infiltration, and pancreatic mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-6, α-SMA, TGF-β and increased collagen compared to offspring of control dams weaned on to control chow (Con_Con). Analyses of CCG expression demonstrated a phase shift in CLOCK (−4.818, p<0.01), REV-ERB-α (−1.4,p<0.05) and Per2 (3.27,p<0.05) in association with decreased amplitude in BMAL-1 (−0.914,p<0.05) and PER2 (1.18,p<0.005) in Ob_Ob compared to Con_Con. 2-way ANOVA revealed significant interaction between MO and post-weaning OD in expression of CLOCK (p<0.005), PER1 (p<0.005) and PER2 (p<0.05) whilst MO alone influenced the observed rhythmic variance in expression of all 5 measured CCG.

https://openalex.org/W2027377918,"The structural and functional characterization of human enzymes that are of potential medical and therapeutic interest is of prime significance for translational research. One of the most notable examples of a therapeutic enzyme is l-asparaginase, which has been established as an antileukemic protein drug for more than four decades. Up until now, only bacterial enzymes have been used in therapy despite a plethora of undesired side effects mainly attributed to the bacterial origins of these enzymes. Therefore, the replacement of the currently approved bacterial drugs by human homologs aiming at the elimination of adverse effects is of great importance. Recently, we structurally and biochemically characterized the enzyme human l-asparaginase 3 (hASNase3), which possesses l-asparaginase activity and belongs to the N-terminal nucleophile superfamily of enzymes. Inspired by the necessity for the development of a protein drug of human origin, in the present study, we focused on the characterization of another human l-asparaginase, termed hASNase1. This bacterial-type cytoplasmic l-asparaginase resides in the N-terminal subdomain of an overall 573-residue protein previously reported to function as a lysophospholipase. Our kinetic, mutagenesis, structural modeling, and fluorescence labeling data highlight allosteric features of hASNase1 that are similar to those of its Escherichia coli homolog, EcASNase1. Differential scanning fluorometry and urea denaturation experiments demonstrate the impact of particular mutations on the structural and functional integrity of the l-asparaginase domain and provide a direct comparison of sites critical for the conformational stability of the human and E. coli enzymes. The structural and functional characterization of human enzymes that are of potential medical and therapeutic interest is of prime significance for translational research. One of the most notable examples of a therapeutic enzyme is l-asparaginase, which has been established as an antileukemic protein drug for more than four decades. Up until now, only bacterial enzymes have been used in therapy despite a plethora of undesired side effects mainly attributed to the bacterial origins of these enzymes. Therefore, the replacement of the currently approved bacterial drugs by human homologs aiming at the elimination of adverse effects is of great importance. Recently, we structurally and biochemically characterized the enzyme human l-asparaginase 3 (hASNase3), which possesses l-asparaginase activity and belongs to the N-terminal nucleophile superfamily of enzymes. Inspired by the necessity for the development of a protein drug of human origin, in the present study, we focused on the characterization of another human l-asparaginase, termed hASNase1. This bacterial-type cytoplasmic l-asparaginase resides in the N-terminal subdomain of an overall 573-residue protein previously reported to function as a lysophospholipase. Our kinetic, mutagenesis, structural modeling, and fluorescence labeling data highlight allosteric features of hASNase1 that are similar to those of its Escherichia coli homolog, EcASNase1. Differential scanning fluorometry and urea denaturation experiments demonstrate the impact of particular mutations on the structural and functional integrity of the l-asparaginase domain and provide a direct comparison of sites critical for the conformational stability of the human and E. coli enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1988072245,"Minimally invasive (MI) lumbar decompression became a common approach to treat lumbar stenosis. This approach may potentially mitigate postoperative increases in segmental motion. The goal of this study was to evaluate modifications to segmental motion in the lumbar spine following a MI unilateral approach as compared to traditional facet-sparing and non-facet sparing decompressions. Six human lumbar cadaveric specimens were used. Each specimen was tested in flexion-extension 0 N and 400 N of follower preload), axial rotation, and lateral bending. Each testing condition was evaluated following three separate interventions at L4-L5: 1) Minimally invasive decompression, 2) Facet-sparing, bilateral decompression, and 3) Bilateral decompression with a wide facetectomy. Range of motion following each testing condition was compared to intact specimens. Both MI and traditional decompression procedures create significant increases in ROM in all modes of loading. However, when compared to the MI approach, traditional decompression produces significantly larger increase in ROM in flexion-extension (p<0.005) and axial rotation (p<0.05). It additionally creates increased ROM with lateral bending on the approach side (p<0.05). Lateral bending on the non-approach side is not significantly changed. Lastly, wide medial facet removal (40% to 50%) causes significant hypermobility, especially in axial rotation. While both MI and traditional lumbar decompressions may increase post-operative ROM in all conditions, a MI approach causes significantly smaller increase in ROM. With an MI approach, increased movement with lateral bending is only toward the approach side. Further, non-facet sparing decompression is further destabilizing in all loading modes."
https://openalex.org/W2016924387,"Background MicroRNA-146a (miR-146a) was a key negative regulator of autoimmunity. V-Ets oncogene homolog 1 (Ets-1) was demonstrated to bind to the miR-146a promoter region and markedly affects miR-146a promoter activity. This study aimed to investigate the association of miR-146a and Ets-1 gene polymorphisms with pediatric uveitis in a Han Chinese population. Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 520 patients and 1204 healthy controls were included in the present study. Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), miR-146a/rs2910164, miR-146a/rs57095329, miR-146a/rs6864584, ets-1/rs1128334 and ets-1/rs10893872 were genotyped using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. The expression of Ets-1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from genotyped healthy controls was tested by real-time PCR. Two SNPs (rs2910164 and rs10893872) were associated with pediatric uveitis in this study. The frequencies of the rs2910164 GG genotype and G allele were significantly increased (Pc = 3.11×10−4; Pc = 2.75×10−6) while the CC genotype and C allele were significantly decreased (Pc = 0.001; Pc = 2.75×10−6) in patients compared with normal controls. The frequencies of the rs10893872 CC genotype and C allele were significantly increased (Pc = 3.89×10−4; Pc = 0.01) while the CT genotype and T allele were significantly decreased (Pc = 0.004; Pc = 0.01) in patients compared with normal controls. The SNP rs2910164 GG genotype and G/C allele were also associated with the presence of microvascular leakage as detected by fundus fluorescein angiography in pediatric uveitis (Pc = 0.01; Pc = 0.005, respectively). Ets-1 expression in rs10893872 CC carriers was significantly higher than in CT and TT individuals (Pc = 0.013). There was no association of the other three SNPs with pediatric uveitis. Conclusions This study shows that miR-146a and Ets-1 are both associated with pediatric uveitis in Han Chinese. SNP rs10893872 may affect the genetic predisposition to pediatric uveitis by modulating expression of Ets-1."
https://openalex.org/W2033899945,"DesB, which is derived from Sphingobium sp. SYK-6, is a type II extradiol dioxygenase that catalyzes a ring opening reaction of gallate. While typical extradiol dioxygenases show broad substrate specificity, DesB has strict substrate specificity for gallate. The substrate specificity of DesB seems to be required for the efficient growth of S. sp. SYK-6 using lignin-derived aromatic compounds. Since direct coordination of hydroxyl groups of the substrate to the non-heme iron in the active site is a critical step for the catalytic reaction of the extradiol dioxygenases, the mechanism of the substrate recognition and coordination of DesB was analyzed by biochemical and crystallographic methods. Our study demonstrated that the direct coordination between the non-heme iron and hydroxyl groups of the substrate requires a large shift of the Fe (II) ion in the active site. Mutational analysis revealed that His124 and His192 in the active site are essential to the catalytic reaction of DesB. His124, which interacts with OH (4) of the bound gallate, seems to contribute to proper positioning of the substrate in the active site. His192, which is located close to OH (3) of the gallate, is likely to serve as the catalytic base. Glu377' interacts with OH (5) of the gallate and seems to play a critical role in the substrate specificity. Our biochemical and structural study showed the substrate recognition and catalytic mechanisms of DesB."
https://openalex.org/W1965814176,"The widespread relationship between salt excreting structures (e.g., salt glands) and marine life strongly suggests that the ability to regulate salt balance has been crucial during the transition to marine life in tetrapods. Elevated natremia (plasma sodium) recorded in several marine snakes species suggests that the development of a tolerance toward hypernatremia, in addition to salt gland development, has been a critical feature in the evolution of marine snakes. However, data from intermediate stage (species lacking salt glands but occasionally using salty environments) are lacking to draw a comprehensive picture of the evolution of an euryhaline physiology in these organisms. In this study, we assessed natremia of free-ranging Dice snakes (Natrix tessellata, a predominantly fresh water natricine lacking salt glands) from a coastal population in Bulgaria. Our results show that coastal N. tessellata can display hypernatremia (up to 195.5 mmol.l−1) without any apparent effect on several physiological and behavioural traits (e.g., hematocrit, body condition, foraging). More generally, a review of natremia in species situated along a continuum of habitat use between fresh- and seawater shows that snake species display a concomitant tolerance toward hypernatremia, even in species lacking salt glands. Collectively, these data suggest that a physiological tolerance toward hypernatremia has been critical during the evolution of an euryhaline physiology, and may well have preceded the evolution of salt glands."

https://openalex.org/W2095063113,"Increased expression of angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) induces apoptosis in numerous tumor cell lines, with either Angiotensin II-dependent or Angiotensin II-independent regulation, but its molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we used PCR Array analysis to determine the gene and microRNA expression profiles in human prostate cancer cell lines transduced with AT2R recombinant adenovirus. Our results demonstrated that AT2R over expression leads to up-regulation of 6 apoptosis-related genes (TRAIL-R2, BAG3, BNIPI, HRK, Gadd45a, TP53BP2), 2 cytokine genes (IL6 and IL8) and 1 microRNA, and down-regulation of 1 apoptosis-related gene TNFSF10 and 2 cytokine genes (BMP6, BMP7) in transduced DU145 cells. HRK was identified as an up-regulated gene in AT2R-transduced PC-3 cells by real-time RT-PCR. Next, we utilized siRNAs to silence the up-regulated genes to further determine their roles on AT2R overexpression mediated apoptosis. The results showed downregulation of Gadd45a reduced the apoptotic effect by ∼30% in DU145 cells, downregulation of HRK reduced AT2R-mediated apoptosis by more than 50% in PC-3 cells, while downregulation of TRAIL-R2 enhanced AT2R-mediated apoptosis more than 4 times in DU145 cells. We also found that the effects on AT2R-mediated apoptosis caused by downregulation of Gadd45a, TRAIL-R2 and HRK were independent in activation of p38 MAPK, p44/42 MAPK and p53. Taken together, our results demonstrated that TRAIL-R2, Gadd45a and HRK may be novel target genes for further study of the mechanism of AT2R-mediated apoptosis in prostate cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2042807473,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) can be a consequence of diabetes, hypertension, immunologic disorders, and other exposures, as well as genetic factors that are still largely unknown. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is widely used to measure kidney function, has a heritability ranging from 25% to 75%, but only 1.5% of this heritability is explained by genetic loci that have been identified to date. In this study we tested for associations between GFR and 234 SNPs in 26 genes from pathways of blood pressure regulation in 3,025 rural Chinese participants of the “Genetic Epidemiology Network of Salt Sensitivity” (GenSalt) study. We estimated GFR (eGFR) using baseline serum creatinine measurements obtained prior to dietary intervention. We identified significant associations between eGFR and 12 SNPs in 6 genes (ACE, ADD1, AGT, GRK4, HSD11B1, and SCNN1G). The cumulative effect of the protective alleles was an increase in mean eGFR of 4 mL/min per 1.73 m2, while the cumulative effect of the risk alleles was a decrease in mean eGFR of 3 mL/min per 1.73 m2. In addition, we identified a significant interaction between SNPs in CYP11B1 and ADRB2. We have identified common variants in genes from pathways that regulate blood pressure and influence kidney function as measured by eGFR, providing new insights into the genetic determinants of kidney function. Complex genetic effects on kidney function likely involve interactions among genes as we observed for CYP11B1 and ADRB2."
https://openalex.org/W2102844830,"Objectives Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between HbA1c levels and the complexity of coronary artery lesions among the older patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Methods This retrospective study enrolled a total of 3805 consecutive type 2 DM patients aged 60 years and older who underwent their first elective coronary angiography and had their HbA1c levels measured at the Chinese PLA General Hospital between December 2005 and December 2012.The complexity of the coronary artery lesions was evaluated using the Syntax score, and the subjects were divided into three groups according to their HbA1c levels. Logistic regression and Pearson correlation were used to analyze the association between the measured HbA1c levels and Syntax score. Results The mean age was 72.3±10.6 years. The higher HbA1c levels were significantly associated with higher Syntax score (p<0.001). The unadjusted correlation coefficient of HbA1c levels and the Syntax score was 0. 371 (p<0.001). In addition, the higher HbA1c categories were able to independently predict patients with intermediate or high Syntax score (Syntax score ≥23) after adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia and creatinine levels in the logistic regression analysis. Conclusion HbA1c is significantly associated with the complexity of coronary lesions among older patients with DM. A higher HbA1c value is an independent predictor of the prevalence of complex coronary lesions. Further prospective multi-centre studies are needed to confirm this finding."

Limited data exist on inflammation during pregnancy or postpartum in HIV-infected women, though certain inflammatory markers are associated with adverse health outcomes among HIV-infected persons. We measured hsCRP, D-dimer, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α at 34 weeks gestation and six months postpartum in HIV-infected women from the Botswana Mashi PMTCT trial who were randomized to breastfeeding or formula-feeding. Differences in inflammatory markers between gestation and postpartum periods, and by randomized feeding method, were estimated using generalized estimating equations, adjusting for baseline plasma HIV-1 viral load, CD4 count, calendar time, and antiretroviral treatment status. Additionally, we studied the association between marker concentrations at six months postpartum and major adverse clinical events over the following 4.5 years, using case-cohort sampling and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. In 86 breastfeeding and 75 formula-feeding women, hsCRP and D-dimer decreased significantly between 34 weeks gestation and six months postpartum, while IFN-γ increased. There was no significant association between inflammatory marker change and randomized feeding method after adjusting for multiple comparisons and removing outliers. In univariate analysis, TNF-α, D-dimer, and IFN-γ concentrations at six months postpartum were significant predictors of subsequent clinical events, and TNF-α remained significant in multivariate analysis (HR = 4.16, p = 0.001). In young HIV-infected women in Botswana inflammatory marker concentrations did not differ significantly between women who breast- vs. formula-fed. However, postpartum TNF-α level was predictive of subsequent adverse clinical event."
https://openalex.org/W2084906702,"Specific granule deficiency (SGD) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by recurrent infections. The disease is caused by inactivating mutations of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-ε (C/EBP-ε) gene. As a consequence, specific and gelatinase granules lack most matrix proteins. Furthermore, azurophil granules contain diminished amounts of their most abundant proteins, α-defensins, also known as human neutrophil peptides (HNPs). In accordance with this, in vitro models have demonstrated induction of HNPs by C/EBP-ε. Since mice do not express myeloid defensins, they cannot per se be used to characterize the role of C/EBP-ε in controlling HNP expression in vivo. We therefore crossed a transgenic HNP-1-expressing mouse with the Cebpe-/- mouse to study the in vivo significance of C/EBP-ε for HNP-1 transcription and expression. Surprisingly, neither expression nor processing of HNP-1 was affected by lack of C/EBP-ε in these mice. Transduction of C/EBP-ε into primary bone marrow cells from HNP-1 mice induced some HNP-1 expression, but not to levels comparable to expression human cells. Taken together, our data infer that the HNP-1 of the transgenic mouse does not show an expression pattern equivalent to endogenous secondary granule proteins. This limits the use of these transgenic mice as a model for human conditions."
