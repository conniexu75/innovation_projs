https://openalex.org/W2069171272,"Expansion of a GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat upstream of the C9orf72 coding region is the most common cause of familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTLD/ALS), but the pathomechanisms involved are unknown. As in other FTLD/ALS variants, characteristic intracellular inclusions of misfolded proteins define C9orf72 pathology, but the core proteins of the majority of inclusions are still unknown. Here, we found that most of these characteristic inclusions contain poly-(Gly-Ala) and, to a lesser extent, poly-(Gly-Pro) and poly-(Gly-Arg) dipeptide-repeat proteins presumably generated by non-ATG-initiated translation from the expanded GGGGCC repeat in three reading frames. These findings directly link the FTLD/ALS-associated genetic mutation to the predominant pathology in patients with C9orf72 hexanucleotide expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2004999616,"Methylmercury is a potent neurotoxin produced in natural environments from inorganic mercury by anaerobic bacteria. However, until now the genes and proteins involved have remained unidentified. Here, we report a two-gene cluster, hgcA and hgcB, required for mercury methylation by Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ND132 and Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA. In either bacterium, deletion of hgcA, hgcB, or both genes abolishes mercury methylation. The genes encode a putative corrinoid protein, HgcA, and a 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxin, HgcB, consistent with roles as a methyl carrier and an electron donor required for corrinoid cofactor reduction, respectively. Among bacteria and archaea with sequenced genomes, gene orthologs are present in confirmed methylators but absent in nonmethylators, suggesting a common mercury methylation pathway in all methylating bacteria and archaea sequenced to date."
https://openalex.org/W2012588998,"Mutations in IDH1 and IDH2, the genes coding for isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 and 2, are common in several human cancers, including leukemias, and result in overproduction of the (R)-enantiomer of 2-hydroxyglutarate [(R)-2HG]. Elucidation of the role of IDH mutations and (R)-2HG in leukemogenesis has been hampered by a lack of appropriate cell-based models. Here, we show that a canonical IDH1 mutant, IDH1 R132H, promotes cytokine independence and blocks differentiation in hematopoietic cells. These effects can be recapitulated by (R)-2HG, but not (S)-2HG, despite the fact that (S)-2HG more potently inhibits enzymes, such as the 5′-methylcytosine hydroxylase TET2, that have previously been linked to the pathogenesis of IDH mutant tumors. We provide evidence that this paradox relates to the ability of (S)-2HG, but not (R)-2HG, to inhibit the EglN prolyl hydroxylases. Additionally, we show that transformation by (R)-2HG is reversible."
https://openalex.org/W2117195560,"HSP-100 protein machines, such as ClpB, play an essential role in reactivating protein aggregates that can otherwise be lethal to cells. Although the players involved are known, including the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone system in bacteria, details of the molecular interactions are not well understood. Using methyl-transverse relaxation-optimized nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we present an atomic-resolution model for the ClpB-DnaK complex, which we verified by mutagenesis and functional assays. ClpB and GrpE compete for binding to the DnaK nucleotide binding domain, with GrpE binding inhibiting disaggregation. DnaK, in turn, plays a dual role in both disaggregation and subsequent refolding of polypeptide chains as they emerge from the aggregate. On the basis of a combined structural-biochemical analysis, we propose a model for the mechanism of protein aggregate reactivation by ClpB."
https://openalex.org/W2082250319,"Tryptophan is commonly used to study protein structure and dynamics, such as protein folding, as a donor in fluorescence resonant energy transfer (FRET) studies. By using ultra-broadband ultrafast two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy in the ultraviolet (UV) and transient absorption in the visible range, we have disentangled the excited state decay pathways of the tryptophan amino acid residues in ferric myoglobins (MbCN and metMb). Whereas the more distant tryptophan (Trp7) relaxes by energy transfer to the heme, Trp14 excitation predominantly decays by electron transfer to the heme. The excited Trp14→heme electron transfer occurs in <40 picoseconds with a quantum yield of more than 60%, over an edge-to-edge distance below ~10 angstroms, outcompeting the FRET process. Our results raise the question of whether such electron transfer pathways occur in a larger class of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2089023997,"IgE antibodies to gal-α-1,3-gal-β-1,4-GlcNAc (α-gal) can mediate a novel form of delayed anaphylaxis to red meat. Although IgG antibodies to α-gal (anti-α-gal or anti-Gal) are widely expressed in humans, IgE anti-α-gal is not. We explored the relationship between the IgG and IgE responses to both α-gal and the related blood group B antigen. Contradicting previous reports, antibodies to α-gal were found to be significantly less abundant in individuals with blood group B or AB. Importantly, we established a connection between IgE and IgG responses to α-gal: elevated titers of IgG anti-α-gal were found in IgE-positive subjects. In particular, proportionally more IgG1 anti-α-gal was found in IgE-positive subjects against a background of IgG2 production specific for α-gal. Thus, two types of immune response to α-gal epitopes can be distinguished: a ‘typical’ IgG2 response, presumably in response to gut bacteria, and an ‘atypical’, Th2-like response leading to IgG1 and IgE in addition to IgG2. These results suggest that IgE to a carbohydrate antigen can be formed (probably as part of a glycoprotein or glycolipid) even against a background of bacterial immune stimulation with essentially the same antigen."
https://openalex.org/W2017293137,"Low dietary intake of β-carotene is associated with chronic disease and vitamin A deficiency. β-Carotene is converted to vitamin A in the intestine by the enzyme β-carotene-15,15′-monoxygenase (BCMO1) to support vision, reproduction, immune function, and cell differentiation. Considerable variability for this key step in vitamin A metabolism, as reported in the human population, could be related to genetics and individual vitamin A status, but it is unclear how these factors influence β-carotene metabolism and vitamin A homeostasis. Here we show that the intestine-specific transcription factor ISX binds to the Bcmo1 promoter. Moreover, upon induction by the β-carotene derivative retinoic acid, this ISX binding decreased expression of a luciferase reporter gene in human colonic CaCo-2 cells indicating that ISX acts as a transcriptional repressor of BCMO1 expression. Mice deficient for this transcription factor displayed increased intestinal BCMO1 expression and produced significantly higher amounts of vitamin A from supplemental β-carotene. The ISX binding site in the human BCMO1 promoter contains a common single nucleotide polymorphism that is associated with decreased conversion rates and increased fasting blood levels of β-carotene. Thus, our study establishes ISX as a critical regulator of vitamin A production and provides a mechanistic explanation for how both genetics and diet can affect this process.

Thus, our study establishes ISX as a critical regulator of vitamin A production and provides a mechanistic explanation for how both genetics and diet can affect this process. Vitamin A (all-trans-retinol) is required for mammalian vision, reproduction, immune function, and cell differentiation. In the eye, vitamin A is converted to 11-cis-retinal, the visual chromophore, in a complex pathway known as the retinoid cycle (1von Lintig J. Metabolism of carotenoids and retinoids related to vision.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 1627-1634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Vitamin A can also be oxidized to all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), 2The abbreviations used are: RAall-trans-retinoic acidBCβ,β-caroteneBCMO1β,β-carotene-15,15′-monooxygenase 1ISXintestinal specific homeobox transcription factorRARretinoic acid receptorScarb1/SR-B1scavenger receptor class B type ISNPsingle nucleotide polymorphismqRT-PCRquantitative-real time PCR. a hormone-like compound that binds to a specialized class of nuclear receptors called retinoic acid receptors (RARs) (2Rhinn M. Dollé P. Retinoic acid signalling during development.Development. 2012; 139: 843-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). RARs are ligand-regulated transcription factors, which in conjunction with retinoid X receptors control the activity of genes in diverse cell types (3Mark M. Ghyselinck N.B. Chambon P.

Dietary vitamin A precursors are absorbed in the intestine and delivered systemically in the form of retinyl esters bound to triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Inadequate dietary supply of vitamin A is a major health problem, causing blindness and increased mortality in children and pregnant women, especially in large regions of Asia and Africa (4Sommer A. Vitamin A deficiency and clinical disease. An historical overview.J. Nutr. 2008; 138: 1835-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Carotenoids such as β-carotene (BC) from plant food are the natural precursors of vitamin A in the human diet (5Grune T. Lietz G. Palou A. Ross A.C. Stahl W. Tang G. Thurnham D. Yin S.A. Biesalski H.K. β-Carotene is an important vitamin A source for humans.J. Nutr. 2010; 140: 2268S-2285SCrossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). BC must be absorbed in the intestine before it can be metabolically converted to vitamin A. It has long been assumed that such absorption occurs by passive non-ionic diffusion, but emerging evidence indicates that absorption of carotenoids and other lipid soluble vitamins is actively facilitated by class 2 scavenger receptors such as SCARB1 and CD36 (6Reboul E. Borel P. Proteins involved in uptake, intracellular transport and basolateral secretion of fat-soluble vitamins and carotenoids by mammalian enterocytes.Prog. Lipid Res. 2011; 50: 388-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The subsequent conversion of BC to retinoids is catalyzed by the enzyme β-carotene-15,15′-monoxygenase (BCMO1) in enterocytes of the small intestine (7Wyss A. Wirtz G.M. Woggon W.D. Brugger R. Wyss M. Friedlein A. Riss G. Bachmann H. Hunziker W. Expression pattern and localization of β,β-carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase in different tissues.Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The primary cleavage product of BC, retinaldehyde, is reduced to retinol, which is esterified and incorporated into chylomicrons that are secreted into the lymph for storage in the liver and tissue distribution (8D'Ambrosio D.N. Clugston R.D. Blaner W.S. Vitamin A metabolism. An update.Nutrients. 2011; 3: 63-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the bioavailability of BC from food is considered to be low and influenced by the food matrix and vitamin A status of the host (9Castenmiller J.J. West C.E. Bioavailability and bioconversion of carotenoids.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 19-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Additionally, intervention studies have revealed large individual variations in intestinal BC metabolism, leading to identification of a “low converter” phenotype (10Borel P. Grolier P. Mekki N. Boirie Y. Rochette Y. Le Roy B. Alexandre-Gouabau M.C. Lairon D. Azais-Braesco V. Low and high responders to pharmacological doses of β-carotene. Proportion in the population, mechanisms involved and consequences on β-carotene metabolism.J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2250-2260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these individuals, low conversion efficiency occurs after BC supplementation, reflected by the retinyl ester/BC ratio in the chylomicron fraction (10Borel P. Grolier P. Mekki N. Boirie Y. Rochette Y. Le Roy B. Alexandre-Gouabau M.C. Lairon D. Azais-Braesco V. Low and high responders to pharmacological doses of β-carotene. Proportion in the population, mechanisms involved and consequences on β-carotene metabolism.J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2250-2260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). About 45% of the Western population can be classified as low converters (11Hickenbottom S.J. Follett J.R. Lin Y. Dueker S.R. Burri B.J. Neidlinger T.R. Clifford A.J. Variability in conversion of β-carotene to vitamin A in men as measured by using a double-tracer study design.Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2002; 75: 900-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Lin Y.

Nutr. 2000; 71: 1545-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recent studies provide evidence that genetics may contribute to these differences. A genome-wide study has associated a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs6564851) 7-kb upstream of the BCMO1 gene with increased fasting BC serum levels (13Ferrucci L. Perry J.R. Matteini A. Perola M. Tanaka T. Silander K. Rice N. Melzer D. Murray A. Cluett C. Fried L.P. Albanes D. Corsi A.M. Cherubini A. Guralnik J. Bandinelli S. Singleton A. Virtamo J. Walston J. Semba R.D.

Genet. 2009; 84: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A small intervention study provided evidence that this SNP is associated with reduced intestinal BC conversion (14Lietz G. Oxley A. Leung W. Hesketh J. Single nucleotide polymorphisms upstream from the β-carotene 15,15′-monoxygenase gene influence provitamin A conversion efficiency in female volunteers.J. Nutr. 2012; 142: 161S-165SCrossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Additionally, several lines of evidence indicate that conversion of BC is under negative feedback control of vitamin A (15von Lintig J. Colors with functions. Elucidating the biochemical and molecular basis of carotenoid metabolism.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2010; 30: 35-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 16Lietz G. Lange J. Rimbach G.

Nutr. 2002; 132: 3616-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A recent study suggests that this dietary responsiveness is mediated by the intestine-specific homeobox transcription factor ISX (18Seino Y. Miki T. Kiyonari H. Abe T. Fujimoto W. Kimura K.

Chem. 2008; 283: 4905-4911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). ISX harbors an RAR binding motif in its promoter region and its expression can be induced by the BC metabolite RA (19Lobo G.P. Hessel S. Eichinger A. Noy N. Moise A.R. Wyss A. Palczewski K. von Lintig J. ISX is a retinoic acid-sensitive gatekeeper that controls intestinal β,β-carotene absorption and vitamin A production.FASEB J. 2010; 24: 1656-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Upon induction of this transcription factor, intestinal Bcmo1 mRNA expression decreases (18Seino Y. Miki T. Kiyonari H. Abe T. Fujimoto W. Kimura K. Takeuchi A. Takahashi Y. Oiso Y. Iwanaga T. Seino S. Isx participates in the maintenance of vitamin A metabolism by regulation of β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenase (Bcmo1) expression.J. Biol.

The effects of genetics and diet might hold a key to understand individual variability in intestinal BC metabolism in humans, but molecular details of how intestinal BCMO1 expression is controlled and how this regulation might be affected by genetics require elucidation. Additionally, direct evidence from animal models is lacking to evaluate the concept that ISX controls intestinal vitamin A production. A proper description of this regulatory network would help provide appropriate recommendations for BC intake to combat vitamin A deficiency. Thus, we aimed to characterize how ISX controls BCMO1 promoter activity and to study the role of ISX for vitamin A homeostasis in a mouse model. Platinum Pfx polymerase, Prolong Gold anti-fade mounting medium, MAX efficiency competent cells DH5α, BL21, BL21(DE3), conjugated secondary antibody Alexa 488, and antibiotics were purchased from Invitrogen. Taq DNA polymerase, X-tremeGENE HD transfection reagents, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Restriction endonucleases were obtained from New England BioLabs (Ipswich, MA). DMEM was obtained from Invitrogen. M-PER (mammalian) and B-PER (bacterial) protein extraction reagents, and the BCA protein assay kit were from Pierce Biotechnology Inc. Primary anti-ISX (C-16) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA), loading control anti-α-tubulin was purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Danvers, MA), whereas anti-Bcmo1 antibody was obtained as previously described (20Lampert J.M. Holzschuh J. Hessel S. Driever W. Vogt K. von Lintig J. Provitamin A conversion to retinal via the β,β-carotene-15,15′-oxygenase (bcox) is essential for pattern formation and differentiation during zebrafish embryogenesis.Development. 2003; 130: 2173-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). All primers were synthesized and obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA). Secondary antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Danvers, MA) or Bio-Rad. The pGL3-promoter luciferase vector and relevant reagents for luciferase assays were provided by Promega (Madison, WI). Solvents used for retinoid extraction and chromatography were of HPLC grade (Fisher Scientific). Total RNA was isolated from mouse intestine with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). About 2 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the RNA to cDNA kit as outlined by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Using this cDNA as a template, full-length mouse ISX cDNA was PCR amplified using primer pairs listed in Table 1 and cloned into the pTrcHis2 TOPO TA vector. Murine WT-ISX in the pTrcHis2 TOPO TA vector (pTrcHis2-WT-ISX) was then transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 or XL1 blue cells. We isolated crude protein extracts from three different colonies. Cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium with 100 μg/ml of the appropriate antibiotics at 37 °C overnight. After achieving an A600 of 0.8, cells were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 6 h at 25 °C for ISX expression. Total protein extracts were then prepared as per published protocols (21von Lintig J. Kreusch D. Schröder J. Opine-regulated promoters and LysR-type regulators in the nopaline (noc) and octopine (occ) catabolic regions of Ti plasmids of Agrobacterium tumefaciens.J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 495-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of ISX protein in different supernatant and pellet fractions was determined by immunoblot analysis with an anti-His antibody (Qiagen). Extracts from different colonies yielded similar results in EMSA. As a control protein extract, we isolated crude protein from E. coli transfected with an empty pTrcHis2 vector by the same protocol.TABLE 1Sequences of primers used for PCR-amplification of mouse Bcmo1 promoter fragments and full length mouse ISX cDNAFragmentPosition from ATGVectorForward primerReverse primerProduct sizeMouseBcmo1, fragment1− 1660 to − 2200pTrcHis25′-gagctcttagtgtatcccag-3′5′-ggagggtgagagctgagcag-3′540 bpBcmo1, fragment 2− 1290 to − 1721pTrcHis25′-acagcctgttctagaacgtt-3′5′-cctgctgcctgctgcctgct-3′431 bpBcmo1, fragment 3− 850 to − 1350pTrcHis25′-actgggattgtatacatgca-3′5′-tcgggaacccttcagttcaa-3′500 bpBcmo1, fragment 4− 479 to − 980pTrcHis25′-ctcctggctgagggcgtcac-3′5′-actattgcaagttgtgggct-3′501 bpBcmo1, fragment 5− 180 to − 579pTrcHis25′-ttttaagagtgggaacgaac-3′5′-gctctttgctccttgacatc-3′399 bpBcmo1, fragment 6− 1 to − 340pTrcHis25′-ctcttccgactcagagcgga-3′5′-ggaaccggtgagcggcagca-3′339 bpFull-length Bcmo1, promoter− 1 to − 2200pTrcHis2 and pGL3-promoter5′-gagctcttagtgtatcccag-3′5′-ggaaccggtgagcggcagca-3′2200 bpBcmo1, promoter-F2/F3 fragment− 1290 to − 1350pTrcHis2 and pGL3-promoter5′-cctgcctcaacctcctgag-3′5′-gcctgctgcctgctgcctg-3′60 bpBcmo1, promoter-Hbox− 1309 to − 1357pGL3-promoter5′-cctgcctcaacctcctgag-3′5′-tgcctgctgcatgtataca − 3′48 bpISXFull-length cDNApTRcHis25′-atggcaggccctacgatcca-3′5′-atggcaggccctacgatccacag-3′2163 bpHumanBcmo1, SNP region P1Region − 7943 to − 7893ChiP5′-tgcctactgtattttaag-3′5′-taaacagtgtaaaactgt-3′50 bpBcmo1, SNP region P2Region − 7943 to − 7893ChiP5′-tgcctactgtattttaagca-3′5′-taaacagtgtaaaactgt-3′50 bpMouseBcmo1 region P1Region − 1350 to − 1290ChiP5′-gctaagctggttggccatcag-3′5′-cctgctgcctgctgcctgct119 bpBcmo1 region P2Region − 1350 to − 1290ChiP5′-gttggccatcagctaaggag-3′5′-ctgtctgctgtctgctgcctgc-3′122 bp Open table in a new tab The mouse Bcmo1 promoter (2.2 kb) was subdivided into six overlapping DNA fragments (339–540 bp in length). Each fragment was PCR amplified with genomic DNA isolated from mouse intestine as a template and the oligonucleotide primer pairs listed in Table 1, essentially as described previously (22Nassif N.T. Lobo G.P. Wu X. Henderson C.J. Morrison C.D. Eng C. Jalaludin B. Segelov E. PTEN mutations are common in sporadic microsatellite stable colorectal cancer.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). An aliquot of each PCR product was evaluated on 2% agarose gels to determine its size and relative purity. The six individual Bcmo1 promoter fragments were subsequently cloned into the pTrcHis2 TOPO TA vector according to the manufacturer's protocols (Invitrogen). Appropriate construction and cloning of Bcmo1 promoter fragments were confirmed by direct sequencing of both nucleotide strands. The six individual Bcmo1 promoter fragments cloned into the pTrcHis2 TOPO TA vector were excised with NcoI and EcoRI restriction enzymes. Restricted Bcmo1 promoter fragments were gel-purified (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and eluted in Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer. Following purification, individual fragments were 5′ end labeled with [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Biosciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase. TE buffer (100 μl) was then added to the [α-32P]ATP/Bcmo1 promoter fragment reaction mixtures, which then were further purified on Sephadex G-25 spin columns (GE Healthcare). The radioactivity of individually labeled Bcmo1 promoter fragments was determined by measuring the counts per minute (cpm) of 1 μl of radiolabeled double stranded DNA in a scintillation counter (Beckman-Coulter LS6500). About 12,000 cpm of individually labeled 32P-Bcmo1 promoter fragments were used in the EMSA reactions. EMSAs were carried out according to published procedures (21von Lintig J. Kreusch D. Schröder J. Opine-regulated promoters and LysR-type regulators in the nopaline (noc) and octopine (occ) catabolic regions of Ti plasmids of Agrobacterium tumefaciens.J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 495-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled Bcmo1 promoter fragments (∼12,000 cpm) were incubated for 10 min at room temperature (RT) with crude ISX protein extract from BL21 cells in EMSA buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgC12, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. Protein-DNA complexes then were separated from unbound DNA by gel electrophoresis on 6 or 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. For supershift assays, either 2 μg of anti-ISX antibody or 2 μg of control rabbit IgG antibody were added to the binding reaction and incubated for 10–30 min at RT. In control reactions, radiolabeled Bcmo1 promoter fragments were incubated with an E. coli protein extract without recombinant ISX protein. Gels were dried under vacuum and analyzed by autoradiography. To prevent nonspecific binding of proteins to labeled DNA fragments, the synthetic heteropolymer poly(dI-dC) was added to a concentration of 2 μg/μl in each reaction. To confirm that the observed protein-DNA complexes resulted from specific binding, a 100-fold molar excess of the corresponding unlabeled Bcmo1-promoter fragments also was added to compete with nonspecific protein-DNA binding. All EMSA images in relevant figures are representative of at least two independent experiments. The reporter vector used for transfection into mammalian cells was pGL3 (Promega), which provided a basis for the quantitative analysis of factors potentially regulating mammalian gene expression. Taking advantage of this system, we first generated three Bcmo1 promoter fragments by PCR using primer pairs listed in Table 1: the full-length murine Bcmo1 promoter fragment (nucleotides −1 to −2200, of the ATG start site), the 60-bp murine Bcmo1 promoter fragment (nucleotides −1290 to −1350), and the 60-bp murine Bcmo1 promoter fragment containing the SNP in the human Bcmo1 promoter, the last generated by site-directed mutagenesis. We then cloned these three fragments individually into the pGL3-promoter vector and named them pGL3 Bcmo1-full promoter (2200 bp), pGL3 Bcmo1-promoter-F2/F3 fragment (60 bp), and pGL3 Bcmo1-F2/F3 SNP (60 bp fragment with the G/T SNP), respectively. Postcloning, the recombinant plasmids with inserts were sequenced to confirm the integrity of the inserts in each construct. CaCo-2 (human adenocarcinoma) cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4.5 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml of penicillin/streptomycin. CaCo-2 cells were seeded in 6-well plates (density ∼2.0 × 105 cells per well) in DMEM with 10% (v/v) FBS at 37 °C for 24 h or until reaching 50–60% confluence. Each well then was transfected with either 3 μg of empty pGL3-promoter vector (pGL3-promoter vector) or one of the different pGL3-promoter constructs as indicated in the figures and corresponding legends. Specifically to determine Bcmo1 promoter activities, plasmid DNA was mixed with X-tremeGENE HD (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagent at a ratio of 1 μg of DNA to 3 μl of transfection reagent in OptiMEM (Invitrogen) and incubated for 20 min at RT to initiate formation of complexes (19Lobo G.P.

Forty hours after transfection, cells were harvested with StableGLO cell lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activities were measured as luminescent units (relative light units) and data were normalized to protein concentrations determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). RNA was isolated from animal tissues or cultured cells as described previously (23Lobo G.P. Waite K.A. Planchon S.M. Romigh T. Houghton J.A. Eng C.

Two μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with a RNA to cDNA system (Applied Biosystems). QRT-PCR was carried out with TaqMan chemistry and Assays on Demand probes (Applied Biosystems) for mouse Isx (Mm_01243745m1) and mouse Bcmo1 (Mm01251350_m1). The 18S rRNA (4319413E) probe set (Applied Biosystems) was used as the endogenous control. All real time experiments were performed with the ABI Step One Plus QRT-PCR machine in triplicate and repeated twice, using freshly synthesized cDNA. To evaluate binding of ISX to the Bcmo1 promoter, a ChIP assay was performed with the EZ-ChIP kit (Millipore, Temecula, CA) as previously described (19Lobo G.P. Hessel S. Eichinger A. Noy N.

Specifically, CaCo-2 cells were cultured in 150-cm2 dishes and transfected with 3 μg of pGL3-promoter plasmid containing the 2.2-kb full-length Bcmo1 promoter (pGL3 Bcmo1-promoter-full) from cells at 60% confluence. Forty hours post-transfection, cells were treated with 1 μm RA for 24 h at 37 °C to induce endogenous ISX expression. Cells then were treated with 1% paraformaldehyde at 37 °C with gentle swirling for 10 min to enable cross-linking of nuclear proteins with genomic DNA, followed by sonication to shear and obtain DNA fragment sizes between 300 and 1000 bp in length. Four μg of human ISX antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) was used for immunoprecipitation, whereas 4 μg of IgG was used as a control. Immunoprecipitated DNA was PCR amplified with primer pairs listed in Table 1. Mouse Bcmo1 promoter primers used to PCR amplify the 60-bp putative ISX-Bcmo1 binding region (nucleotides −1290 to −1350) and human BCMO1 promoter primers (nucleotides −7943 to −7893) both relevant to the ATG start site, are listed in Table 1. PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels. Animal experiments were performed in accordance with United States animal protection laws with adherence to guidelines of the institutional animal care and use committee of Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, OH). These also conformed to recommendations of both the American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia and the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research.

Heterozygous offspring from this crossing were further bred to obtain Isx−/− (knock-out) and Isx+/+ (wild-type) mice. Five-week-old mice (n = 5 animal per dietary condition and genotype) were fed for 8 weeks with diets supplemented, respectively, with 4 IU of vitamin A/g or 0.5 mg/g of BC provided as beadlets (DSM, Basel, Switzerland). Individual diets were prepared by Research Diets, Inc. (New Brunswick, NJ) with an AIN-93G formulation. Retinoids were extracted from tissues of WT and ISX-deficient mice (n = 5 per genotype and diet) under a dim red safety light (600 nm) and quantified by HPLC analysis after direct phase chromatography as previously described (25Amengual J.

For quantification of molar amounts of retinoids, the HPLC analyses were previously scaled with appropriate retinoid standards. Mouse intestinal tissue was fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS solution. After 24 h, samples were placed in a 30% sucrose/PBS solution. When fully saturated with sucrose, tissue samples were mounted in OCT medium (Sakura Fine Chemicals, Japan) and cut into 20-μm thick sections with a cryostat (Leica). Sections were collected in phosphate-based saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and stored at 4 °C before immunostaining for ISX expression. For immunostaining, 20 sections for each experimental condition (n = 3 per genotype and diet) were washed twice in PBS containing 0.01% Triton X-100 (PBS-T) for 10 min at RT. Sections were then placed in blocking buffer (5% bovine serum, 1% BSA in PBS) at RT and shaken for 1–2 h in a thermomixer (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY) at 300 rpm, following which they were washed twice with PBS-T for 10 min at RT. Then sections were incubated with shaking in a thermomixer overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibody diluted (1:250) with the blocking buffer used above, and subsequently washed twice with PBS-T for 10 min at RT. Then tissue sections with primary antibody were shaken overnight at 4 °C in a thermomixer along with a 1:250 dilution of secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa 488 (green fluorescence) in the blocking buffer followed by 2 washes in PBS-T for 10 min each at RT. Finally, these washed samples with secondary antibody were exposed to DAPI (1 μg/ml in PBS-T) for 5 min at RT. Sections were finally washed three times for 10 min each, and mounted in mounting medium (Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent) on frost-free glass slides and allowed to dry. Fluorescent images were obtained by a Zeiss LSM 510 UV Meta confocal microscope equipped with an HCX Plan ×63 numerical aperture 1.4 oil-immersion objective lens.

https://openalex.org/W2044118972,"Clinical studies demonstrate that the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, ketamine, induces rapid antidepressant effects in patients with refractive major depressive disorder and bipolar depression. This rapid onset of action makes ketamine a highly attractive drug for patients, particularly those who do not typically respond to therapy. A recent study suggested that glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 may underlie the rapid antidepressant action of ketamine, although the precise mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of ketamine and GSK-3 inhibitor SB216763 in the unpredictable, chronic mild stress (CMS) mouse model of mice.Adult C57/B6 male mice were divided into 2 groups, a non-stressed control group and the unpredictable CMS (35 days) group. Then, either vehicle, ketamine (10 mg/kg), or the established GSK-3 inhibitor, SB216763 (10 mg/kg), were administered into mice in the CMS group, while vehicle was administered to controls. In the open field test, there was no difference between the four groups (control+vehicle, CMS+vehicle, CMS+ketamine, CMS+SB216763). In the sucrose intake test, a 1% sucrose intake drop, seen in CMS mice, was significantly attenuated after a single dose of ketamine, but not SB216763. In the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST), the increased immobility time seen in CMS mice was significantly attenuated by a single dose of ketamine, but not SB216763. Interestingly, the ketamine-induced increase in the sucrose intake test persisted for 8 days after a single dose of ketamine. Furthermore, a single administration of ketamine, but not SB216763, significantly attenuated the immobility time of the TST and FST in the control (non-stressed) mice.These findings suggest that a single administration of ketamine, but not GSK-3 inhibitor SB216763, produces a long-lasting antidepressant action in CMS model mice."
https://openalex.org/W2052966638,"Histone deacetylases 4 (HDAC4), -5, -7, and -9 form class IIa within the HDAC superfamily and regulate diverse physiological and pathological cellular programs. With conserved motifs for phosphorylation-dependent 14-3-3 binding, these deacetylases serve as novel signal transducers that are able to modulate histone acetylation and gene expression in response to extracellular cues. Here, we report that in a PKA-sensitive manner the tumor suppressor kinase LKB1 acts through salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2) and SIK3 to promote nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of class IIa HDACs. Both SIK2 and SIK3 phosphorylate the deacetylases at the conserved motifs and stimulate 14-3-3 binding. SIK2 activates MEF2-dependent transcription and relieves repression of myogenesis by the deacetylases. Distinct from SIK2, SIK3 induces nuclear export of the deacetylases independent of kinase activity and 14-3-3 binding. These findings highlight the difference among members of the SIK family and indicate that LKB1-dependent SIK activation constitutes an important signaling module upstream from class IIa deacetylases for regulating cellular programs controlled by MEF2 and other transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2157439409,"Objective of this study was to examine the impact of executive function (EF) on mathematical and attention problems in very preterm (gestational age ≤ 30 weeks) children. Participants were 200 very preterm (mean age 8.2 ± 2.5 years) and 230 term children (mean age 8.3 ± 2.3 years) without severe disabilities, born between 1996 and 2004. EFs assessed included verbal fluency, verbal working memory, visuospatial span, planning, and impulse control. Mathematics was assessed with the Dutch Pupil Monitoring System and parents and teachers rated attention problems using standardized behavior questionnaires. The impact of EF was calculated over and above processing speed indices and IQ. Interactions with group (very preterm versus term birth status) were examined. Analyses were conducted separately for two subsamples: children in preschool and children in primary school. Very preterm children performed poorer on tests for mathematics and had more parent and teacher rated attention problems than term controls (ß(s)>.11, P(s)<.01). IQ contributed unique variance to mathematics in preschool and in primary school (ß(s)>.16, P(s)<.007). A significant interaction of group with IQ (ß = -. 24, P = .02) showed that IQ contributed unique variance to attention problems as rated by teachers, but that effects were stronger for very preterm than for term infants. Over and above IQ, EF contributed unique variance to mathematics in primary school (ß = .13, P<.001), to parent rated inattention in preschool and in primary school (ß(s)>-.16, P(s)<.04), and to teacher rated inattention in primary school (ß = -.19; ß = .19, P(s)<.009). In conclusion, impaired EF is, over and above impaired IQ, an important predictor for poor mathematics and attention problems following very preterm birth."

https://openalex.org/W1991171508,"Background Little is known about the incidence and risk of seizures after stroke in young adults. Especially in the young seizures might dramatically influence prognosis and quality of life. We therefore investigated the long-term incidence and risk of post-stroke epilepsy in young adults with a transient ischemic attack (TIA), ischemic stroke (IS) or intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Methods and Findings We performed a prospective cohort study among 697 consecutive patients with a first-ever TIA, IS or ICH, aged 18–50 years, admitted to our hospital between 1-1-1980 till 1-11-2010. The occurrence of epilepsy was assessed by standardized questionnaires and verified by a neurologist. Cumulative risks were estimated with Kaplan-Meier analysis. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate relative risks. After mean follow-up of 9.1 years (SD 8.2), 79 (11.3%) patients developed post-stroke epilepsy and 39 patients (5.6%) developed epilepsy with recurrent seizures. Patients with an initial late seizure more often developed recurrent seizures than patients with an initial early seizure. Cumulative risk of epilepsy was 31%, 16% and 5% for patients with an ICH, IS and TIA respectively (Logrank test ICH and IS versus TIA p<0.001). Cumulative risk of epilepsy with recurrent seizures was 23%, 8% and 4% respectively (Logrank ICH versus IS p = 0.05, ICH versus TIA p<0.001, IS versus TIA p = 0.01). In addition a high NIHSS was a significant predictor of both epilepsy and epilepsy with recurrent seizures (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03–1.11 and 1.08, 95% CI 1.02–1.14). Conclusions Post-stroke epilepsy is much more common than previously thought. Especially patients with an ICH and a high NIHSS are at high risk. This calls upon the question whether a subgroup could be identified which benefits from the use of prophylactic antiepileptic medication. Future studies should be executed to investigate risk factors and the effect of post-stroke epilepsy on quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W2013435418,"Ankyrin repeat domain-encoding genes are common in the eukaryotic and viral domains of life, but they are rare in bacteria, the exception being a few obligate or facultative intracellular Proteobacteria species. Despite having a reduced genome, the arthropod strains of the alphaproteobacterium Wolbachia contain an unusually high number of ankyrin repeat domain-encoding genes ranging from 23 in wMel to 60 in wPip strain. This group of genes has attracted considerable attention for their astonishing large number as well as for the fact that ankyrin proteins are known to participate in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that they play a critical role in the molecular mechanism that determines host-Wolbachia symbiotic interactions. We present a comparative evolutionary analysis of the wMel-related ankyrin repeat domain-encoding genes present in different Drosophila-Wolbachia associations. Our results show that the ankyrin repeat domain-encoding genes change in size by expansion and contraction mediated by short directly repeated sequences. We provide examples of intra-genic recombination events and show that these genes are likely to be horizontally transferred between strains with the aid of bacteriophages. These results confirm previous findings that the Wolbachia genomes are evolutionary mosaics and illustrate the potential that these bacteria have to generate diversity in proteins potentially involved in the symbiotic interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1990274230,"AML1-ETO fusion protein (AE) is generated by t(8;21)(q22;q22) chromosomal translocation, which is one of the most frequently observed structural abnormalities in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and displays a pivotal role in leukemogenesis. The histone acetyltransferase p300 promotes self-renewal of leukemia cells by acetylating AE and facilitating its downstream gene expression as a transcriptional coactivator, suggesting that p300 may be a potential therapeutic target for AE-positive AML. However, the effects of p300 inhibitors on leukemia cells and the underlying mechanisms have not been extensively investigated. In the current study, we analyzed the anti-leukemia effects of C646, a selective and competitive p300 inhibitor, on AML cells. Results showed that C646 inhibited cellular proliferation, reduced colony formation, evoked partial cell cycle arrest in G1 phase, and induced apoptosis in AE-positive AML cell lines and primary blasts isolated from leukemic mice and AML patients. Nevertheless, no significant inhibitory effects were observed in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized normal peripheral blood stem cells. Notably, AE-positive AML cells were more sensitive to lower C646 doses than AE-negative ones. And C646-induced growth inhibition on AE-positive AML cells was associated with reduced global histone H3 acetylation and declined c-kit and bcl-2 levels. Therefore, C646 may be a potential candidate for treating AE-positive AML."
https://openalex.org/W2005437246,"Dyslipidemia is highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the relationship between dyslipidemia with renal outcomes in patients with moderate to advanced CKD remains controversial. Hence, our objective is to determine whether dyslipidemia is independently associated with rapid renal progression and progression to renal replacement therapy (RRT) in CKD patients. The study analyzed the association between lipid profile, RRT, and rapid renal progression (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] slope <−6 ml/min/1.73 m2/yr) in 3303 patients with stages 3 to 5 CKD. During a median 2.8-year follow-up, 1080 (32.3%) participants commenced RRT and 841 (25.5%) had rapid renal progression. In the adjusted models, the lowest quintile (hazard ratios [HR], 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 1.49) and the highest two quintiles of total cholesterol (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.52 and HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.65 respectively) increased risks for RRT (vs. quintile 2). Besides, the highest quintile of total cholesterol was independently associated with rapid renal progression (odds ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.83). Our study demonstrated that certain levels of dyslipidemia were independently associated with RRT and rapid renal progression in CKD stage 3–5.

Carcinogenesis is a multifaceted pathological event wherein pro-oncogenic factors and tumor suppressors wrestle for the control of cancer cells. A more malignant phenotype of cancer cells is characterized by the ability to migrate to and colonize in distal sites in a process termed metastasis (1Bogenrieder T. Herlyn M. Axis of evil: molecular mechanisms of cancer metastasis.Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6524-6536Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Patients with metastasized tumors are expected to have a much shorter disease-free survival rate (2Eccles S.A. Welch D.R. Metastasis: recent discoveries and novel treatment strategies.Lancet. 2007; 369: 1742-1757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Hence, the battle between oncoproteins and tumor suppressors may converge on metastasis in which oncoproteins promote, whereas tumor suppressors antagonize, migratory and invasive behavior of cancer cells. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 3The abbreviations used are: EMTepithelial-mesenchymal transitionCCNH/CDK7cyclin H/cyclin-dependent kinase 7CtBP2C-terminal binding protein 2HIPK2homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2. is a biologically conserved process defined by the replacement of an epithelial phenotype by a mesenchymal phenotype (3Scheel C. Weinberg R.A. Phenotypic plasticity and epithelial-mesenchymal transitions in cancer and normal stem cells?.Int. J. Cancer. 2011; 129: 2310-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Once a cancer undergoes EMT, it sheds connections with neighboring cells and the extracellular matrix and becomes more aggressive in migration and invasion, leading to enhanced metastasis. Accompanying EMT, there are changes in gene expression profile within cancer cells characterized by the loss of epithelial-specific markers and the activation of mesenchymal-specific genes (4Zavadil J. Böttinger E.P. TGF-β and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5764-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). By differentially modulating gene expression, a host of transcriptional activators and repressors participate in EMT and by extension cancer metastasis (5Nieto M.A. The ins and outs of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition in health and disease.Annu.

CtBP, an unconventional transcriptional corepressor in development and oncogenesis.Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Among known CtBP2 functions is its ability to promote EMT, which facilitates cancer cell metastasis, by functioning as a transcriptional corepressor of epithelial-specific genes (7Zhang Q. Wang S.Y.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 9029-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Specifically, CtBP2 forms a complex with sequence-specific transcription factors and binds to proximal promoter region of E-cadherin, a prominent epithelial marker, to repress transcription (8Grooteclaes M.L.

Thus, CtBP2 level and/or activity can be deemed as a predicting factor for cancer metastasis. However, the intricate mechanism underlying the regulation of CtBP2 levels during cancer metastasis is not well defined. Here we report that cyclin H/CDK7 complex increases cellular CtBP2 levels by altering its phosphorylation and proteasomal destruction. Therefore, the CCNH/CDK7-CtBP2 axis could potentially serve as a novel target for the development of anti-metastatic interventions.

Cells were passaged with 0.1% trypsin and 0.04% EDTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Cells were transfected at 70–90% confluence, utilizing 2 μl of Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen)/μg of DNA. Lipofectamine and DNA were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 5 min in separate tubes. After incubation, the contents of two tubes were combined, incubated for an additional 15 min, and applied onto cells. HEK293T cells were grown to confluence in 10-cm dishes and transiently transfected with 10 μg of the expression plasmids by using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 48 h after transfection, the growth medium was aspirated, and cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were further lysed in plates by using 1 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 2 mm PMSF, Complete protease inhibitor mixture) and then collected in microcentrifuge tubes, where cell lysates were purged 10 times through the 27-gauge syringe, followed by a 30-min incubation with gentle rotation at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 14,000 × g, the supernatant was used for coimmunoprecipitation with 1 μg of specific antibodies or control IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), shaken for 2 h (4 °C), mixed with 30 μl of protein A/G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), incubated for another 2 h (4 °C), and washed three times with washing buffer. Proteins bound to the beads were boiled in 60 μl of loading buffer followed by Western blotting. The antibodies used for immunodetection were as follows: anti-CtBP2 (BD Biosciences; 1:1000), anti-β-actin (Sigma; 1:10,000). anti-FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich; 1:1000), anti-GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:800), anti-HIPK2 (Abcam; 1: 1000), EMT Antibody Sampler Kit (Cell Signaling). CCNH, CDK7, and CtBP2 sequences were inserted into a pGEX-6P-1 vector and transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL-21/DE3. Proteins were induced by adding 0.2 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) for 6 h (29 °C). GST pulldowns were performed as described previously. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and then resuspended in buffer (PBS, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)) for sonication. After centrifugation of the sonicated lysates, the supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) for purification. Forty-eight hours after transfection with the indicated plasmids, 293T cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and suspended in lysis buffer. The resulting supernatants were divided into three parts. One-tenth of the supernatant was used for input. Equal parts of the remaining supernatant were incubated with GST or GST-fused proteins for 2 h (4 °C). The beads were then washed with washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) three times and boiled in 40 μl of loading buffer for immunoblotting. The wound closure assay was performed as described previously (7Zhang Q. Wang S.Y. Nottke A.C. Rocheleau J.V. Piston D.W. Goodman R.H. Redox sensor CtBP mediates hypoxia-induced tumor cell migration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 9029-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A wound was induced on the confluent monolayer cells by scraping a gap with a micropipette tip, and the speed of wound closure was monitored by light microscopy. Cell migration was measured by the traveling distance from the original wound edge after 20 h of incubation. A 24-well Transwell plate (8-μm pore size, Corning) was used to measure the migratory and invasive ability of each cell line. For Transwell migration assays, 5 × 104 cells were plated in the top chamber, which was lined with a noncoated membrane. For invasion assays, chamber inserts were coated with 200 mg/ml Matrigel and dried overnight under sterile conditions. Then, 1 × 105 cells were plated in the top chamber. The mean values of triplicate assays for each experimental condition were used. Statistical analyses were performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test. All data are expressed as means ± S.E. Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. To search for proteins that could interact with and hence regulate the activity of CtBP2, we employed a yeast two-hybrid screen with CtBP2 as bait. Using this strategy, we were able to identify CCNH/CDK7 as a potential binding partner for CtBP2 (data not shown). To verify this potential interaction, we transfected HEK293T cells with differentially tagged expression constructs for CCNH/CDK7 and CtBP2 followed by immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, anti-GFP antibody brought down FLAG-tagged CCNH or CDK7 along with GFP-tagged CtBP2. To probe the possibility that CCNH/CDK7 could interact directly with CtBP2, we performed a GST pulldown assay using purified proteins. After incubation with FLAG-CCNH/CDK7-transfected 293T cell lysates, the precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody. The results showed that both CCNH and CDK7 bound to GST-CtBP2 but not to GST alone (Fig. 1, C and D). A reciprocal experiment using GST-CCNH/CDK7 and FLAG-CtBP2 gave similar results (Fig. 1, E and F). We then sought to determine whether the CtBP2-CCNH/CDK7 interaction can be detected in vivo. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed on nontransfected MDA-MB-231 cell lysates with anti-CCNH (Fig. 1G) or anti-CtBP2 antibody (Fig. 1H). CtBP2 coimmunoprecipitated specifically with the anti-CCNH antibody, but not in control precipitation, demonstrating a naturally occurring interaction between endogenous CtBP2 and CCNH/CDK7 in vivo. To further delineate the domains with which CtBP2 binds to CCNH/CDK7, we transfected HEK293T cells with either full-length (1–445) or truncated CtBP2 constructs followed by immunoprecipitation. As indicated in Fig. J, CtBP2 interacted with CCNH/CDK7 via its most N terminus between amino acids 1 and 82. Next, to determine how the interaction with CCNH/CDK7 might influence endogenous CtBP2 levels, we depleted cellular CCNH or CDK7 by shRNA mediated knockdown. Two independent shRNA clones targeting CCNH (ps4.1-CCNH-1 and -2) significantly down-regulated cyclin H expression in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2A). Of interest, this was a concomitant decrease in CtBP2 levels. Similarly, silencing CDK7 expression also resulted in a sharp loss of CtBP2 protein (Fig. 2B). We also examined the effect of CCNH/CDK7 elimination on CtBP2 protein levels in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Deletion of either cyclin H (Fig. 2C) or CDK7 (Fig. 2D) led to the down-regulation of CtBP2 protein expression. We then sought to determine whether reduction of CtBP2 protein expression by CCNH/CDK7 removal was a result of impaired protein stability. To this end, we used an inhibitor to eukaryotic translation, cycloheximide to stop translation and measured protein half-life by Western blotting. CtBP2 protein was degraded at a much faster rate when there was an insufficient amount of endogenous cyclin H or CDK7 rendered by shRNA, indicating that CCNH/CDK7 is probably indispensible for shielding CtBP2 from degradation (Fig. 3 A and B). To further test this hypothesis, we treated with cells with a 26S proteasome inhibitor, MG132. Indeed, the addition of MG132 restored CtBP2 protein levels even in the presence of CCNH/CDK7 shRNA (Fig. 3, C and D). Adding yet more support to this assertion is the observation that knockdown of either cyclin H or CDK7 significantly augmented ubiquitination of CtBP2, a prelude to protein degradation (Fig. 3E). Together, these data suggest that CCNH/CDK7 function to protect CtBP2 from proteasomal degradation. Having confirmed that CCNH/CDK7 affords CtBP2 an extended half-life, we next tackled the possible mechanisms. HIPK2 is a known modulator of CtBP2 degradation. It has been demonstrated that HIPK2 commits CtBP2 to proteasomal degradation by directly phosphorylating CtBP2 in cancer cells (13Zhang Q. Nottke A. Goodman R.H. Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 mediates CtBP phosphorylation and degradation in UV-triggered apoptosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2802-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that CCNH/CDK7 could somehow compete for the binding of CtBP2 with HIPK2, thus protecting CtBP2 from HIPK2-mediated degradation. To this end, we assessed the interaction between CtBP2 and HIPK2 in HEK293T cells either in the presence or absence of ectopic cyclin H. As depicted in Fig. 4, there was a significant reduction in the association between HIPK2 and CtBP2 when cyclin H (GFP-CCNH) was overexpressed. Therefore, CCNH/CDK7 stabilizes CtBP2 protein in part by interfering its interaction with HIPK2. We also evaluated other possibilities by which CCNH/CDK7 could impact CtBP2. CtBP2 is a target of post-translational modifications; among them, phosphorylation plays a key role in determining the ubiquitination and degradation of CtBP2 (14Chinnadurai G. The transcriptional corepressor CtBP: a foe of multiple tumor suppressors.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To verify whether CCN/CDK7 could alter the phosphorylation levels of CtBP2, we purified CtBP2 from cells depleted with cyclin H or CDK7 and then probed CtBP2 phosphorylation by Western blotting with a pan-phosphoserine/phosphothreonine antibody. In the absence of CCNH or CDK7, CtBP2 phosphorylation was greatly elevated (Fig. 5, A and B). CtBP2 activity is determined by its oligomerization status; dimerized CtBP2 is preferentially located in the nucleus and actively engaged in transcriptional repression (15Verger A. Quinlan K.G. Crofts L.A. Spanò S. Corda D. Kable E.P. Braet F. Crossley M. Mechanisms directing the nuclear localization of the CtBP family proteins.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4882-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Bhambhani C. Chang J.L. Akey D.L. Cadigan K.M. The oligomeric state of CtBP determines its role as a transcriptional co-activator and co-repressor of Wingless targets.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 2031-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We first verified that CtBP2 indeed formed a dimer in HEK293T cells by coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 5C). shRNA-mediated silencing of cyclin H or CDK7, however, markedly disrupted the formation of a CtBP2 dimer, indicative of compromised repressor activity (Fig. 5, D and E). Collectively, these data demonstrate that CCNH/CDK7 antagonize CtBP2 phosphorylation and promote CtBP2 dimerization, both leading to enhanced CtBP2 activity. Next, we tested the hypothesis that CtBP2 phosphorylation may influence its interaction with CCNH/CDK7. We mutated two key phosphorylation sites (Ser-164 by PKA and Ser-428 by HIPK2) in two forms: a defective form (Ser to Arg) and a constitutively active form (Ser to Asp). Of intrigue, whereas phosphorylation-defective CtBP2 (S164A and S428A) retained its ability to interact with CCNH/CDK7 (Fig. 6 A and B), constitutively phosphorylated CtBP2 (S164D and S428D) was unable to do so (Fig. 6, C and D). In keeping with this observation, phosphorylation-defective CtBP2 exhibited a prolonged half-life compared with wild type CtBP2 (Fig. 7A). We were able to confirm that this extended protein stability of CtBP2 was indeed due to impaired proteasomal degradation (Fig. 7B). In agreement with this observation, SA mutants displayed significantly lower levels of ubiquitination compared with either wild type or SD mutants (Fig. 7C). Thus, CtBP2 phosphorylation may promote its own degradation by blocking the interaction with CCNH/CDK7. CtBP-mediated repression of adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin suggests that CtBP is important in promoting EMT, a step that contributes to the malignant property of tumor cells due to the loss of intercellular adhesion in tumors, acquisition of motile and invasive phenotypes, and resistance to apoptosis (14Chinnadurai G. The transcriptional corepressor CtBP: a foe of multiple tumor suppressors.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To determine whether CtBP2 can affect the expression of endogenous epithelial markers (E-cadherin), Western blot analysis was performed to detect alterations in the E-cadherin protein level after transfection with pS4.1-CtBP2. After CtBP2 knockdown in HEK293T and MDA-MB-231 cells, the expression of E-cadherin was significantly increased and the expression of mesenchymal markers (vimentin and N-cadherin) was markedly decreased (supplemental Fig. S1). Finally, we made an attempt to examine the relevance of the newly identified CCNH/CDK7-CtBP2 axis in the regulation of cell migration and invasion. Overexpression of CtBP2 enhanced, whereas depletion of CtBP2 dampened, the invasion of breast cancer cells in Transwell assay (Fig. 8A). Similarly, cyclin H also conferred enhanced invasive capability to breast cancer cells (Fig. 8B). The ability of CtBP2 to promote cell invasion was impaired by the lack of cyclin H (Fig. 8C), suggesting that activation by the CCNH/CDK7 complex serves as a prerequisite for CtBP2 to exert its pro-metastatic function. We also employed wound healing assay to assess the ability of CtBP2 to influence cell migration and reached a similar conclusion that CtBP2 augmented breast cancer cell migration in a CCNH/CDK7-dependent manner (Fig. 8D). CtBP2 repressors represent potentially attractive cancer drug targets, but are only useful as such if expressed in human tumors. Breast cancer and glioma tissues were thus analyzed for CtBP2 protein level by immunoblotting. Notably, the highly invasive samples contained comparatively high levels of CtBP2 and CCNH/CDK7, but unlike the low ones (supplemental Fig. S2). Mounting evidence has implicated CtBP as a key promoter of carcinogenesis especially cancer metastasis (14Chinnadurai G. The transcriptional corepressor CtBP: a foe of multiple tumor suppressors.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).

Transcription factors involved in development and progression of malignant melanoma.Histol. Histopathol. 2004; 19: 173-188PubMed Google Scholar). The underlying mechanisms responsible for the modulation of CtBP levels during cancer metastasis, however, remain enigmatic. Our data as summarized here provide novel evidence that a CCNH/CDK7-CtBP2 axis controls cancer cell migration and invasion by fine-tuning CtBP2 protein levels in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Through molecular mapping, we demonstrate that CCNH/CDK7 interacts with CtBP2 via its most N-terminal domain (1–81). This apparently leads to the stabilization of CtBP2. One possible explanation is that interaction with CCNH/CDK7 shields CtBP2 from the binding and thus destruction by HIPK2. Indeed, the interaction between CtBP2 and HIPK2 is significantly weakened in the presence of exogenous cyclin H (Fig. 4). Bergman et al. have shown that unlike CtBP1, CtBP2 possesses a unique N-terminal domain that contains a strong nuclear localization signal mapped to amino acids 1–14 (24Bergman L.M. Morris L. Darley M. Mirnezami A.H. Gunatilake S.C. Blaydes J.P. Role of the unique N-terminal domain of CtBP2 in determining the subcellular localisation of CtBP family proteins.BMC Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 35Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, an equally plausible explanation is that by binding to the potential nuclear localization signal of CtBP2, CCNH/CDK7 may promote the nuclear localization of CtBP2 and protect it from proteasomal degradation in the cytoplasm. CtBP2 undergoes extensive post-translational modifications that differentially regulate its subcellular localization, stability, and/or affinity for transcriptional factors (13Zhang Q. Nottke A. Goodman R.H. Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 mediates CtBP phosphorylation and degradation in UV-triggered apoptosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Several phosphorylation sites have been mapped for CtBP2 that are correlated with accelerated degradation. For instance, HIPK2 phosphorylates CtBP2 at serine 428 whereas PKA phosphorylates CtBP2 at 164 although it is likely that these two enzymes may act coordinately (27Liang H. Fekete D.M. Andrisani O.M. CtBP2 down-regulation during neural crest specification induces expression of Mitf and REST, resulting in melanocyte differentiation and sympathoadrenal lineage suppression.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 955-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that CCNH/CDK7 regulates CtBP2 stability by at least in part influencing its phosphorylation status (Fig.5), suggesting that cellular CtBP2 levels lie in the balance between CCNH/CDK7 and the kinases that phosphorylate and target CtBP2 for destruction. In support of this hypothesis, we have found that phosphorylation-defective, rather than default phosphorylated, CtBP2 interacts with CCN/CDK7. Therefore, elevated level of CCNH/CDK7 may decrease the amount of phosphorylatable CtBP2 and enhance CtBP-dependent transcriptional repression. Both cyclin H and CDK7 have been implicated in the regulation of cancer metastasis. By screening a library of >10,000 small interfering RNAs, Collins et al. have reported that CDK7 may potentially promote the migration of ovarian cancer cells in vitro (28Collins C.S. Hong J. Sapinoso L. Zhou Y. Liu Z. Micklash K. Schultz P.G. Hampton G.M. A small interfering RNA screen for modulators of tumor cell motility identifies MAP4K4 as a promigratory kinase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3775-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition, high cyclin H expression is noted in cancers with lymphvascular space invasion (29Kayaselcuk F. Erkanli S. Bolat F. Seydaoglu G. Kuscu E. Demirhan B. Expression of cyclin H in normal and cancerous endometrium, its correlation with other cyclins, and association with clinicopathologic parameters.Int. J. Gynecol. Cancer. 2006; 16: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our data tend to suggest that the ability of CCNH/CDK7 to promote cancer cell migration and invasion can be a function of CtBP2 stability because silencing of CCNH completely abrogates the up-regulation of migration and invasion by CtBP2 (Fig. 8). In an effort to validate the usefulness of CtBP2 as a therapeutic target in human cancer, we have shown that CtBP2 protein is overexpressed in highly invasive breast cancer and glioma tissues, likely due to concomitant CCNH/CDK7 overexpression and increased CtBP2 protein stability. In summary, our data demonstrate for the first time that a cyclin H/CDK7 complex interacts with and regulates CtBP2 stability, thereby invoking enhanced migration and invasion of cancer cells. Given the potential significance of this interaction, the development of a small peptide that can block the interaction would likely be viable in the treatment of metastatic cancers in the future.

https://openalex.org/W2069183238,"Mercury increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and oxidative stress and alters vascular reactivity. This metal elicits endothelial dysfunction causing decreased NO bioavailability via increased oxidative stress and contractile prostanoid production. NADPH oxidase is the major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the vasculature. Our aim was to investigate whether treatment with apocynin, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, prevents the vascular effects caused by chronic intoxication with low concentrations of mercury. Three-month-old male Wistar rats were treated for 30 days with a) intramuscular injections (i.m.) of saline; b) HgCl(2) (i.m. 1(st) dose: 4.6 µg/kg, subsequent doses: 0.07 µg/kg/day); c) Apocynin (1.5 mM in drinking water plus saline i.m.); and d) Apocynin plus HgCl(2). The mercury treatment resulted in 1) an increased aortic vasoconstrictor response to phenylephrine and reduced endothelium-dependent responses to acetylcholine; 2) the increased involvement of ROS and vasoconstrictor prostanoids in response to phenylephrine, whereas the endothelial NO modulation of such responses was reduced; and 3) the reduced activity of aortic superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and increased plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Treatment with apocynin partially prevented the increased phenylephrine responses and reduced the endothelial dysfunction elicited by mercury treatment. In addition, apocynin treatment increased the NO modulation of vasoconstrictor responses and aortic SOD activity and reduced plasma MDA levels without affecting the increased participation of vasoconstrictor prostanoids observed in aortic segments from mercury-treated rats.Mercury increases the vasoconstrictor response to phenylephrine by reducing NO bioavailability and increasing the involvement of ROS and constrictor prostanoids. Apocynin protects the vessel from the deleterious effects caused by NADPH oxidase, but not from those caused by prostanoids, thus demonstrating a two-way action."
https://openalex.org/W1972530934,"Background Human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) is one of the major pathogen responsible for hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). Currently no effective vaccine or antiviral drugs are available. Like poliovirus, EV71 is transmitted mainly by the feco-oral route. To date the majority of the studied EV71 vaccine candidates are administered parenterally. Injectable vaccines induce good systemic immunity but mucosal responses are often unsatisfactory, whereas mucosal vaccines provide both systemic and mucosal immunity. Therefore, oral immunization appears to be an attractive alternative to parenteral immunization. Methodology/Principal Findings In this report, we studied the efficacy of an orally administered vaccine candidate developed using recombinant baculovirus displaying VP1 (Bac-VP1) in a murine model. Gastrointestinal delivery of Bac-VP1 significantly induced VP1-specific humoral (IgG) and mucosal (IgA) immune responses. Further, we studied the efficacy of the Bac-VP1 associated with bilosomes and observed that the Bac-VP1 associated with bilosomes elicited significantly higher immune responses compared to bilosomes non-associated with Bac-VP1. However, mice immunized subcutaneously with live Bac-VP1 had significantly enhanced VP1 specific serum IgG levels and higher neutralizing antibody titers compared with mice orally immunized with live Bac-VP1 alone or associated with bilosomes. Conclusion Bilosomes have been shown to possess inherent adjuvant properties when associated with antigen. Therefore Bac-VP1 with bilosomes could be a promising oral vaccine candidate against EV71 infections. Thus, Bac-VP1 loaded bilosomes may provide a needle free, painless approach for immunization against EV71, thereby increasing patient compliance and consequently increasing vaccination coverage."

Currently, very little is known about its nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. In this study, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) of this organism and its closely related species Pneumocystis carinii and Pneumocystis murina by a combination of sequencing technologies. Our study shows that P. carinii and P. murina mtDNA share a nearly identical number and order of genes in a linear configuration, whereas P. jirovecii has a circular mtDNA containing nearly the same set of genes but in a different order. Detailed studies of the mtDNA terminal structures of P. murina and P. carinii suggest a unique replication mechanism for linear mtDNA. Phylogenetic analysis supports a close association of Pneumocystis species with Taphrina, Saitoella, and Schizosaccharomyces, and divergence within Pneumocystis species, with P. murina and P. carinii being more closely related to each other than either is to P. jirovecii. Comparative analysis of four complete P. jirovecii mtDNA sequences in this study and previously reported mtDNA sequences for diagnosing and genotyping suggests that the current diagnostic and typing methods can be improved using the complete mtDNA data. The availability of the complete P. jirovecii mtDNA also opens the possibility of identifying new therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W1986719288,"Theoretical and computational frameworks for synaptic plasticity and learning have a long and cherished history, with few parallels within the well-established literature for plasticity of voltage-gated ion channels. In this study, we derive rules for plasticity in the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, and assess the synergy between synaptic and HCN channel plasticity in establishing stability during synaptic learning. To do this, we employ a conductance-based model for the hippocampal pyramidal neuron, and incorporate synaptic plasticity through the well-established Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM)-like rule for synaptic plasticity, wherein the direction and strength of the plasticity is dependent on the concentration of calcium influx. Under this framework, we derive a rule for HCN channel plasticity to establish homeostasis in synaptically-driven firing rate, and incorporate such plasticity into our model. In demonstrating that this rule for HCN channel plasticity helps maintain firing rate homeostasis after bidirectional synaptic plasticity, we observe a linear relationship between synaptic plasticity and HCN channel plasticity for maintaining firing rate homeostasis. Motivated by this linear relationship, we derive a calcium-dependent rule for HCN-channel plasticity, and demonstrate that firing rate homeostasis is maintained in the face of synaptic plasticity when moderate and high levels of cytosolic calcium influx induced depression and potentiation of the HCN-channel conductance, respectively. Additionally, we show that such synergy between synaptic and HCN-channel plasticity enhances the stability of synaptic learning through metaplasticity in the BCM-like synaptic plasticity profile. Finally, we demonstrate that the synergistic interaction between synaptic and HCN-channel plasticity preserves robustness of information transfer across the neuron under a rate-coding schema. Our results establish specific physiological roles for experimentally observed plasticity in HCN channels accompanying synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons, and uncover potential links between HCN-channel plasticity and calcium influx, dynamic gain control and stable synaptic learning."

Clinically, there are two main forms of IBD: Crohn disease, which can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, and ulcerative colitis, which is restricted to the colon and the rectum (1Kaser A. Zeissig S. Blumberg R.S. Inflammatory bowel disease.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 28: 573-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar, 2Podolsky D.K. Inflammatory bowel disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar). The precise etiology of IBD remains unclear, but several factors have been identified to play major roles in intestinal homeostasis, including microbial defense, innate/adaptive immunity, and autophagy among others (3Maloy K.J. Powrie F. Intestinal homeostasis and its breakdown in inflammatory bowel disease.Nature. 2011; 474: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar, 4Khor B. Gardet A. Xavier R.J.

Disorders of barrier function and epithelial restitution are the major intrinsic pathogenic factors that are regulated by specific signaling pathways in response to harmful microenvironmental factors. inflammatory bowel disease intestinal stem cell adenomatous polyposis coli dextran sulfate sodium leucine-rich, G protein-coupled receptor immunohistochemistry myeloperoxidase glycogen synthase kinase-3β mammalian target of rapamycin 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. In mammals, intestinal epithelial cells establish tight contacts with numerous adjacent epithelial cells to form a single layer that functions as a physical barrier (5Barker N. van de Wetering M. Clevers H. The intestinal stem cell.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1856-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The intestinal epithelium undergoes constant cell turnover through shedding into the intestinal lumen and is the most vigorously renewing adult tissue. Like other somatic stem cells, multipotent intestinal stem cells (ISCs) constitute a long-lived population of cells that have both self-renewal and differentiation abilities (6Weissman I.L. Stem cells: units of development, units of regeneration, and units in evolution.Cell. 2000; 100: 157-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). Bmi1 and Lgr5 mark two distinct types of ISCs based on their location and cycling properties (7Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M. Cozijnsen M. Haegebarth A. Korving J.

Both of these two populations give rise to all the differentiated cell lineages of the intestinal epithelium, and the interconversion between +4 (quiescent) and crypt base columnar (fast-cycling) stem cells in their niches was reported (7Barker N. van Es J.H.

Interconversion between intestinal stem cell populations in distinct niches.Science. 2011; 334: 1420-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). ISCs and their transit-amplifying daughter cells give rise to enterocytes, goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells that occupy the villi and are renewed about every 3–5 days in mice (5Barker N. van de Wetering M. Clevers H. The intestinal stem cell.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1856-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Paneth cells are terminally differentiated cells that move opposite to the crypt-villus flow and reside in the bottom of crypts for several weeks as a potential niche for ISCs (11Sato T. van Es J.H. Snippert H.J. Stange D.E. Vries R.G. van den Born M. Barker N. Shroyer N.F. van de Wetering M. Clevers H. Paneth cells constitute the niche for Lgr5 stem cells in intestinal crypts.Nature. 2011; 469: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). In addition, Paneth cells secrete numerous antimicrobial peptides, which include lysozymes, defensins, cathelicidins, and RegIIIγ, and play important roles in innate immune defense (12Vaishnava S. Behrendt C.L. Ismail A.S. Eckmann L. Hooper L.V. Paneth cells directly sense gut commensals and maintain homeostasis at the intestinal host-microbial interface.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Several studies on mice deficient in different Crohn disease-associated genes involved in reactive oxygen species (14Glinka A. Dolde C. Kirsch N. Huang Y.L. Kazanskaya O. Ingelfinger D. Boutros M. Cruciat C.M. Niehrs C.

As defective epithelial restitution is an important risk factor for IBD, it is not surprising that dysfunction of genes involved in intestinal development, proliferation, and differentiation will increase susceptibility to IBD. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade is the single most dominant pathway in controlling proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells (17de Lau W. Barker N. Clevers H. WNT signaling in the normal intestine and colorectal cancer.Front. Biosci. 2007; 12: 471-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Genetic variants of TCF4, a Wnt signaling pathway transcription factor that is critical for the maintenance of the crypt progenitor phenotype, have been reported to be associated with Crohn disease (18Koslowski M.J. Kübler I. Chamaillard M. Schaeffeler E. Reinisch W. Wang G. Beisner J. Teml A. Peyrin-Biroulet L. Winter S. Herrlinger K.R. Rutgeerts P. Vermeire S. Cooney R. Fellermann K. Jewell D. Bevins C.L.

However, little is known about how Wnt signaling functions during intestinal inflammation. Lgr4, also known as Gpr48, belongs to the leucine-rich, G protein-coupled receptor (LGR) family (19Hsu S.Y. Kudo M. Chen T. Nakabayashi K. Bhalla A. van der Spek P.J. van Duin M. Hsueh A.J.

Genetically modified mouse models have demonstrated that Lgr4 plays broad roles in embryonic development as well as postnatal physiological processes in multiple organs (20Mazerbourg S. Bouley D.M.

With a gene trap strategy, we obtained an Lgr4 hypomorphic mouse strain, and 40% of Lgr4 hypomorphic mice are viable with no significant reduction of lifespan. Using this unique strain, we demonstrated that Lgr4 plays important roles in various organs, including the liver, reproductive tract, bone, and eye (23Luo J. Zhou W. Zhou X. Li D. Weng J. Yi Z.

Recently, Lgr4 and its homologue Lgr5 have been identified as receptors of R-spondins, secreted Wnt pathway agonists and potentiators of Wnt/β-catenin and Wnt/PCP signaling (14Glinka A. Dolde C.

Lgr5 homologues associate with Wnt receptors and mediate R-spondin signalling.Nature. 2011; 476: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). In the intestine, Lgr4 is required for Paneth cell differentiation (27Mustata R.C. Van Loy T. Lefort A. Libert F. Strollo S. Vassart G. Garcia M.I. Lgr4 is required for Paneth cell differentiation and maintenance of intestinal stem cells ex vivo.EMBO Rep. 2011; 12: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and maintenance of intestinal stem cells (26de Lau W.

Here, we demonstrate that Lgr4-deficient mice are more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis. When Wnt/β-catenin signaling is reactivated by crossing with APCmin/+ mice or by treating with a GSK-3β inhibitor, the decreased number of Paneth cell was partially restored and the mortality caused by DSS-induced IBD was dramatically reduced in Lgr4 mutant mice. Taken together, these results underscore the importance of Lgr4-mediated Wnt signaling in intestinal homeostasis and inflammation. Lgr4−/− mice, initially generated on a mixed 129×C57BL/6 background as described previously (25Weng J. Luo J. Cheng X. Jin C. Zhou X. Qu J. Tu L. Ai D. Li D. Wang J. Martin J.F. Amendt B.A. Liu M. Deletion of G protein-coupled receptor 48 leads to ocular anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD) through down-regulation of Pitx2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6081-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), were backcrossed with C57BL/6 mice for at least six generations at the beginning of this study. Heterozygous mice were intercrossed to generate homozygous Lgr4−/− mice and wild-type littermate controls. Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-creERT2 mice (Stock Number 008875) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. APCmin mice (Stock Number J002020) were obtained from the National Resource Center of Mutant Mice (NRCMM). All experiments conformed to the regulations drafted by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care in Shanghai and were approved by the East China Normal University Center for Animal Research. Acute colitis was induced in mice by the administration of 2.5% (w/v) DSS (molecular mass, 36–50 kDa; MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) in the drinking water for 5 days and then changing to regular drinking water. Entire colons were rolled up and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin/eosin. The degree of colonic injury was assessed by a histology scoring system (28Araki A. Kanai T. Ishikura T. Makita S. Uraushihara K. Iiyama R. Totsuka T. Takeda K. Akira S. Watanabe M. MyD88-deficient mice develop severe intestinal inflammation in dextran sodium sulfate colitis.J. Gastroenterol. 2005; 40: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the score was performed with a combined score of inflammatory cell infiltration (score, 0–3), loss of crypts (score, 0–4), and tissue damage (score, 0–6). The inflammatory cell infiltration score was defined as follows: 0 = inflammatory cells occasionally presenting in the lamina propria, 1 = increased number of inflammatory cells in the lamina propria, 2 = confluence of inflammatory cells, extending into the submucosa, 3 = transmural extension of the infiltrate. Loss of crypts: 0 = no involvement, 1 = <25%, 2 = <50%, 3 = <75%, 4 = <100%. Tissue damage including parameter of mucosal ulceration and depth of injury, for mucosal ulceration: 0 = no injury, 1 = focal injury, 2 = multifocal injury, 3 = diffuse ulceration/infiltration; for the depth of injury: 0 = no injury, 1 = mucosal involvement only, 2 = mucosal and submucosal involvement, 3 = transmural involvement. Wild-type (WT) mice were irradiated with 9 grays, received donor bone marrow (107 cells) by injection from the vein of tail, and then were reconstituted with donor bone marrow for 8 weeks. The success of bone marrow reconstitution was confirmed by PCR. To perform LacZ staining, intestine was washed with ice-cold LacZ fixture buffer (2% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 0.02% Nonidet P-40 in PBS) and then incubated for 2 h in fixing buffer at 4 °C on a shaking platform. After washing in LacZ washing buffer (2 mm MgCl2, 0.01% deoxycholate, 0.02% Nonidet P-40 in PBS, pH 8.0) twice (10 min each time), intestines were incubated in LacZ staining buffer (0.5 mg/ml X-gal dissolved in LacZ wash buffer) overnight at room temperature. Tissues were then fixed and sectioned for histological analysis. The intestine was dissected and flushed gently with cold 2% paraformaldehyde and rolled up into a compact circle and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS at 4 °C in the dark on a rolling platform, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 4-μm sections. Sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in gradient alcohols. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 3% H2O2 in methanol for 20 min, and sections were washed in PBS. Antigen retrieval was performed by boiling slides in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, or 10 mm Tris base, 1 mm EDTA solution, pH 9.0. Sections were blocked with 1% BSA and incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with secondary antibody for 30 min, sections were developed with diaminobenzidine and counterstained with hematoxylin and then dehydrated and mounted in neutral resins. For BrdU staining, a similar procedure was performed with the addition of a 30-min treatment with 2 n HCl after antigen retrieval. Antibodies were as follows: lysozyme (1:2000; Dako), β-catenin (1:100; BD Transduction Laboratories), c-Myc (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), cyclin D1 (1:100; Cell Signaling), phospho-S6 (1:400; Cell Signaling), cleaved caspase3 (1:200; Cell Signaling), Ki67 (1:2000; NeoMarker), and Bmi1 (1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). A standardized 3-cm segment of duodenum was isolated, exposed longitudinally, and washed with cold PBS. Then tissue was chopped into ∼5-mm pieces, washed with cold PBS, and incubated in 5 mm EDTA in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. The tissue fragments were suspended vigorously, and the supernatant, including most villi, was discarded. The sediment was resuspended with 5 mm EDTA in PBS and incubated for 30 min on ice. After vigorous resuspension, the supernatant was filtered through a 70-μm cell mesh (BD Bioscience) and incubated in 1 mg/ml trypsin for 30 min at room temperature. For FACS, dead cells were excluded by scatter characteristics and propidium iodide. Lgr5+ ISCs were identified by their endogenous GFP expression. Small intestine tissue samples were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 100 mm phosphate buffer. Tissue was dehydrated, embedded in epoxy resin, and visualized with a JEOL transmission electron microscope at 120 kV (model JEM-1210). Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically, and quality was assessed by agarose electrophoresis. cDNA was synthesized with the SuperScript RNase H2 reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) using 2.5 mm random hexamers (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green probe with the iCycler IQ5 (Bio-Rad). Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Means of two groups were compared using Student's t test (unpaired, two-tailed). Comparisons between multiple groups were made using one-way analysis of variance followed by a post hoc Bonferroni's correction, and p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Unless indicated in the figure legends, all the experiments were performed at least three times with similar results. To explore the roles of Lgr4 in intestinal inflammation, Lgr4 hypomorphic mice were subjected to the DSS-induced experimental IBD model. Notably, after DSS administration, a more severe colitis developed in Lgr4 mutant mice than in WT sex-matched littermates. Strikingly, following 5 days of treatment with 2.5% DSS, no mortality was observed in WT mice during the experimental period; however, all Lgr4 mutant mice died within 8 days after treatment (Fig. 1A). None of the Lgr4 mutant mice could survive even when we decreased the DSS concentration to 1% (data not shown). Higher body weight loss, a hallmark of intestinal inflammation, was observed from day 4 in Lgr4 mutant mice, concordant with a more severe anemia as reflected by the decreased circulating peripheral blood hematocrit concentration (Fig. 1, B and C). Moreover, an increased daily activity index (as described in Table 1) was observed in Lgr4 mutant mice, indicating more severe clinical symptoms (Fig. 1D). Although the small intestine is not the major target of DSS-induced tissue damage (29Elson C.O. Sartor R.B. Tennyson G.S. Riddell R.H. Experimental models of inflammatory bowel disease.Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1344-1367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar), the relative length reduction after DSS-induced inflammation was significantly increased in the small intestine of Lgr4 mutant mice (Fig. 1E), indicating critical functions of Lgr4 in the small intestine. Histological examination showed dramatically increased signs of colitis, which is characterized by the loss of crypts and the infiltration of leukocytes into the colons of Lgr4 mutant mice (Fig. 2, A and B). Accordingly, we found that almost all crypts throughout the small intestine were lost in Lgr4 mutant mice but remained intact in WT littermates (Fig. 2C). Infiltration of neutrophils in the colon was quantified by the determination of MPO activities. At day 8, MPO levels were significantly higher in Lgr4 mutant mice than in WT mice (Fig. 2D), which is consistent with the increase of leukocytes visualized in H&E-stained sections (Fig. 2A). Additionally, inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL6, and IL1β were significantly increased in Lgr4 mutant mice after DSS administration (Fig. 2E), suggesting a more severe inflammatory response in Lgr4-deficient mice.TABLE 1Scoring of the disease activity indexScoreWeight lossStool consistencyBleeding0NoneNormalNormal11–5%NormalNormal25–10%LooseHemoccult +310–20%LooseHemoccult +4>20%DiarrheaGross bleeding Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2More severe intestine inflammation in DSS-induced Lgr4−/− mice.

Data are means ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the cell populations that are critical for Lgr4-dependent protection against DSS-induced bowel inflammation, bone marrow transplantation was employed to determine the contribution of immune and/or nonimmune cells to the IBD phenotype observed in Lgr4−/− mice. After 8 weeks of bone marrow reconstitution, bowel inflammation was induced by DSS administration. Interestingly, WT mice reconstituted with Lgr4−/− bone marrow did not exhibit an exacerbated inflammation response when compared with WT mice transplanted with WT bone marrow (Fig. 2F). Upon DSS-induced colitis, the body weight was decreased more dramatically in Lgr4−/− recipients than that of WT recipients despite the genotype of transplanted bone marrow. Furthermore, all the Lgr4−/− recipients died in 6 days, but most of the WT recipients survived (Fig. 2F). These results indicate that Lgr4 expression in nonhematopoietic cells is more important for protection against DSS-induced IBD. Lgr4 mutant mice exhibited much more severe disease symptoms and disrupted intestinal integrity in DSS-induced intestinal inflammation, suggesting a potential role of Lgr4 in regulation of epithelial cell behavior. In the DSS-induced IBD model, after 5 days of DSS treatment, the intestinal tissue transits to regeneration process. By IHC against Ki67-positive proliferating cells, we observed significantly decreased cell proliferation in Lgr4 mutant intestines during tissue regeneration (Fig. 3, A–C). However, we observed no significant alteration of apoptosis either in normal condition (Fig. 3, D and F) or in the recovery period between Lgr4 mutant and WT mice (Fig. 3, E and F). These results indicated that Lgr4 is responsible for epithelial cell proliferation but not apoptosis during DSS-induced tissue regeneration. Taking advantage of our gene-trapped mice with the LacZ reporter integrated in the first intron of the Lgr4 locus (25Weng J. Luo J. Cheng X. Jin C. Zhou X. Qu J. Tu L. Ai D. Li D. Wang J. Martin J.F. Amendt B.A. Liu M. Deletion of G protein-coupled receptor 48 leads to ocular anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD) through down-regulation of Pitx2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6081-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we examined the expression pattern of Lgr4 in the intestine by X-gal staining in heterozygous mice. In the small intestine, dense staining signals were observed in Paneth cells, which are easily distinguished by large secretory granules in the cytoplasm. In the colon, Lgr4 was mainly expressed in the zone of transit-amplifying cells (Fig. 4A). By using an unambiguous Paneth cell marker, we observed that the number of Paneth cells was 80–85% lower in Lgr4 mutant mice when compared with WT mice, which is consistent with a previous study (27Mustata R.C. Van Loy T. Lefort A. Libert F. Strollo S. Vassart G. Garcia M.I. Lgr4 is required for Paneth cell differentiation and maintenance of intestinal stem cells ex vivo.EMBO Rep. 2011; 12: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, B and C). Furthermore, the mRNA levels of Paneth-specific antimicrobial genes, such as Lyz2, Mmp7, Defa5, Crs1c, and Crs4c, were also dramatically down-regulated (Fig. 4D). Transmission electron microscopy also confirmed that the ultrastructure of the few remaining Paneth cells in mutant mice was obviously altered, suggesting that the secretory function of the remaining Paneth cells in Lgr4 mutant mice was largely impaired (Fig. 4E). With different strategies, we also confirmed that the number of Lgr5+ ISCs was dramatically reduced (Fig."
https://openalex.org/W2113212587,"Obscurins comprise a family of giant (~870- to 600-kDa) and small (~250- to 55-kDa) proteins that play important roles in myofibrillogenesis, cytoskeletal organization, and cell adhesion and are implicated in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and tumorigenesis. Giant obscurins are composed of tandem structural and signaling motifs, including 2 serine/threonine kinase domains, SK1 and SK2, present at the COOH terminus of giant obscurin-B. Using biochemical and cellular approaches, we show for the first time that both SK1 and SK2 possess enzymatic activities and undergo autophosphorylation. SK2 can phosphorylate the cytoplasmic domain of N-cadherin, a major component of adherens junctions, and SK1 can interact with the extracellular domain of the β1-subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase, which also resides in adherens junctions. Immunostaining of nonpermeabilized myofibers and cardiocytes revealed that some obscurin kinase isoforms localize extracellularly. Quantification of the exofacial expression of obscurin kinase proteins indicated that they occupy ~16 and ~5% of the sarcolemmal surface in myofibers and cardiocytes, respectively. Treatment of heart lysates with peptide-N-glycosidase F revealed that while giant obscurin-B localizes intracellularly, possessing dual kinase activity, a small obscurin kinase isoform that contains SK1 localizes extracellularly, where it undergoes N-glycosylation. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that the obscurin kinase domains are enzymatically active and may be involved in the regulation of cell adhesion.—Hu, L.-Y. R., Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos, A.

https://openalex.org/W2024179124,"Chronic tinnitus, the continuous perception of a phantom sound, is a highly prevalent audiological symptom. A promising approach for the treatment of tinnitus is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as this directly affects tinnitus-related brain activity. Several studies indeed show tinnitus relief after rTMS, however effects are moderate and vary strongly across patients. This may be due to a lack of knowledge regarding how rTMS affects oscillatory activity in tinnitus sufferers and which modulations are associated with tinnitus relief. In the present study we examined the effects of five different stimulation protocols (including sham) by measuring tinnitus loudness and tinnitus-related brain activity with Magnetoencephalography before and after rTMS. Changes in oscillatory activity were analysed for the stimulated auditory cortex as well as for the entire brain regarding certain frequency bands of interest (delta, theta, alpha, gamma). In line with the literature the effects of rTMS on tinnitus loudness varied strongly across patients. This variability was also reflected in the rTMS effects on oscillatory activity. Importantly, strong reductions in tinnitus loudness were associated with increases in alpha power in the stimulated auditory cortex, while an unspecific decrease in gamma and alpha power, particularly in left frontal regions, was linked to an increase in tinnitus loudness. The identification of alpha power increase as main correlate for tinnitus reduction sheds further light on the pathophysiology of tinnitus. This will hopefully stimulate the development of more effective therapy approaches."

These PA variants were individually nontoxic and demonstrated toxicity only when combined with their complementary partner. We then engineered requirements for activation by matrix metalloproteases and urokinase plasminogen activator into two of these variants. The resulting therapeutic toxin specifically targeted cells expressing both tumor associated proteases and completely stopped tumor growth in mice when used at a dose far below that which caused toxicity.

However, the complex intermolecular and intramolecular interactions that regulate FAK activity at the focal adhesion remain unresolved. We have engineered a toolbox of FRET sensors that retain all of the individual FAK domains but modulate a key intramolecular regulatory interaction between the band 4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin (FERM) and kinase domains of FAK. We demonstrate systematic control and quantitative measurement of the FERM-kinase interaction at focal adhesions, which in turn allows us to control cell migration. Using these sensors, we find that Tyr-397 phosphorylation, rather than kinase activity of FAK, is the key determinant of cell migration. Our sensors directly demonstrate, for the first time, a pH-dependent change in a protein-protein interaction at a macromolecular structure in live cells.

A key event in FAK activation is the phosphorylation of residue Tyr-397 (5Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.L. Stimulation of cell migration by overexpression of focal adhesion kinase and its association with Src and Fyn.J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tyr-397 phosphorylation is necessary for Src binding to FAK, an essential step in promoting cell migration (5Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.L. Stimulation of cell migration by overexpression of focal adhesion kinase and its association with Src and Fyn.J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, FAK overexpression and Tyr-397 phosphorylation correlate with an invasive phenotype in tumors (6Zhao J. Guan J.L. Signal transduction by focal adhesion kinase in cancer.Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2009; 28: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The FERM domain of FAK is located N-terminally to its kinase domain and contains the Tyr-397 phosphorylation site (7Lietha D. Cai X. Ceccarelli D.F. Li Y. Schaller M.D. Eck M.J. Structural basis for the autoinhibition of focal adhesion kinase.Cell. 2007; 129: 1177-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). It is suggested that the FERM domain also has an autoinhibitory effect on the kinase domain by masking the kinase active site (7Lietha D. Cai X. Ceccarelli D.F. Li Y. Schaller M.D. Eck M.J.

However, studies using FRET-based sensors to detect the conformational changes in FAK at focal adhesions have provided conflicting results (14Cai X. Lietha D. Ceccarelli D.F. Karginov A.V. Rajfur Z.

Biol. 2008; 28: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) detected a decrease in FRET between the FERM and kinase domains following translocation of FAK to the focal adhesion. In contrast, Papusheva et al. (15Papusheva E. Mello de Queiroz F. Dalous J. Han Y. Esposito A. Jares-Erijmanxa E.A. Jovin T.M. Bunt G. Dynamic conformational changes in the FERM domain of FAK are involved in focal-adhesion behavior during cell spreading and motility.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 656-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) found an increase in FRET with a very similar sensor design. The opposing FRET responses of these sensors have been attributed to changes in fluorophore orientation that stem from small differences in sensor design (15Papusheva E. Mello de Queiroz F. Dalous J.

Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 656-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, the conformation and regulation of FAK at focal adhesions still remains unresolved. In this model of FAK function at focal adhesions, kinase activity and Tyr-397 phosphorylation are considered to be synonymous in cell migration, but their relative importance has not yet been evaluated (7Lietha D.

The need to separate the functional consequences of these two effects is underscored by the emergence of FAK inhibitors that target either kinase activity (16Cabrita M.A. Jones L.M. Quizi J.L.

The problem is further complicated by the fact that although Tyr-397 is structurally associated with the FERM domain (7Lietha D. Cai X. Ceccarelli D.F. Li Y. Schaller M.D. Eck M.J. Structural basis for the autoinhibition of focal adhesion kinase.Cell. 2007; 129: 1177-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), kinase activity is typically measured using an exogenous substrate (e.g. E4Y1) (20Withers B.E.

It has been suggested previously that altered cellular pH gradients, resulting from the altered physiology of cancer cells, could play a role in controlling protein conformation and function, ultimately contributing to a cancerous phenotype (27Webb B.A. Chimenti M. Jacobson M.P. Barber D.L. Dysregulated pH. A perfect storm for cancer progression.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). Alternately, changes in the macromolecular structure of the focal adhesion can alter FAK interactions, in turn influencing Tyr-397 phosphorylation (11Serrels B. Serrels A. Brunton V.G. Holt M. McLean G.W. Gray C.H. Jones G.E. Frame M.C. Focal adhesion kinase controls actin assembly via a FERM-mediated interaction with the Arp2/3 complex.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1046-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Increased knowledge of such mechanisms are likely to lead to better and more specific suppression of Tyr-397 phosphorylation, in turn targeting cell migration in cancer. In this study, we derive insights into these important questions with a toolbox of FAK FRET sensors engineered using a new technique, systematic protein affinity strength modulation (SPASM), that probes specifically for changes in the affinity of interaction between two proteins or protein domains in live cells (28Sivaramakrishnan S. Spudich J.A. Systematic control of protein interaction using a modular ER/K α-helix linker.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 20467-20472Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The SPASM sensors retain all domains of native FAK and control the interaction between the FERM and kinase domains with a genetically encoded ER/K linker, the length of which controls the strength of interaction between the FERM and kinase domains. We report that unlike conventional FRET sensors, the SPASM sensor consistently and quantitatively detects the effects of mutations that are known to alter FAK activity (7Lietha D. Cai X. Ceccarelli D.F. Li Y. Schaller M.D. Eck M.J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 8197-8207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The SPASM sensors are engineered to reverse the relationship between the kinase activity and Tyr-397 phosphorylation compared with native FAK. This design allows us to demonstrate that Tyr-397 phosphorylation, rather than kinase activity, is the important determinant for cell migration. Our SPASM sensors, with matched controls, allow for quantitative measurement of the effects of environmental variables like pH on the FERM-kinase interaction. Using these sensors, we quantitatively demonstrate that the FERM-kinase interaction at focal adhesions is enhanced at acidic pH with concomitant reduction in Tyr-397 phosphorylation. Our findings suggest a potential mechanism by which cancer cells stimulate Tyr-397 phosphorylation, independent of FAK overexpression, to provide enhanced cellular migration, which is a hallmark of tumorigenesis. FAK from Gallus gallus (1053 amino acids) was used as a template to perform PCR on the FERM (amino acids 1–409) and kinase-FAT (amino acids 410–1053) domains and full-length wild-type FAK. All constructs contain an N-terminal FLAG tag immediately followed by mCitrine. In sequence behind the mCitrine are the FERM domain, a TEV-protease site (ENLYFQ), ER/K α-helix linker (or Gly-Ser-Gly linker in the case of FAK 0), mCerulean, and the kinase and FAT domains. All domains and fluorophores are linked with three to four [Gly-Ser-Gly] repeats to allow rotational flexibility and are cloned between unique restriction sites. Mutations were generated by either quick-change PCR or were incorporated in the original PCR primers. Affinity mutations used were Y180A+M183A and R28S+K38A. pH affinity mutations were H58A and E466A. Mutations directly affecting enzyme activity were K454R (kinase-dead) (29Cohen L.A. Guan J.L.

Data were acquired on a FluoroMax-4 fluorometer (Horiba Scientific). FRET spectra were generated by exciting samples at 430 nm (spectral band pass, 8 nm), and emission was scanned from 450–650 nm (band pass, 4 nm). For mCitrine-only measurements, samples were excited at 490 nm (band pass, 8 nm), and emission was scanned from 500–650 nm (band pass, 4 nm). In vitro data were collected using a concentration of ∼50 nm on the basis of mCitrine fluorescence (extinction coefficient, ∼77,000 M/cm). Measurements were taken in 50 mm HEPES with the pH adjusted to the desired level with KOH. All samples also contain 0.05 mg/ml BSA to limit nonspecific surface adsorption of sensor proteins.

Cytom. 2001; (Chapter 9, Unit 9.3)PubMed Google Scholar). Kinase assays were performed in a volume of 120 μl and assayed for activity using a Kinase-Glo Max luminescence assay kit (Promega). Tubes contained a concentration of 0.05 mg/ml BSA to limit nonspecific adsorption of protein to surfaces. The assay buffer was 50 mm HEPES (at either pH 7.5 or 5.85) containing 2 mm MnCl2, a 1:1000 dilution of phosphatase inhibitor mixture II (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. The substrate used was poly(Glu, Tyr) sodium salt (Glu-4:Tyr-1, molecular mass 20,000–50,000 Da, Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 166 μg/ml. ATP was added to start the reaction at a final concentration of 100 μm. Reactions were divided into 30-μl aliquots and halted by the addition of an equal volume of Kinase-Glo reagent. Activity was measured by luciferase activity as read by a 96-well plate reader (Synergy 2, BioTek). For the ATP/phosphatase reactions, phosphorylation was performed in the same buffer as the kinase assay, without phosphatase inhibitors, and with E4Y1 peptide. 10 units of calf intestinal phosphatase (New England Biolabs) were used to abolish phosphorylation. Reactions were performed at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by addition of SDS Laemmli sample buffer. Purified FAK constructs bound to FLAG resin were washed three times into 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) + 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and protease inhibitors (as above). Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with TEV protease in ∼100 μl volume to cleave at the TEV-specific site between the FERM and kinase-FAT domains. 1 ml of 50 mm HEPES at either pH 5.85 or 7.5 was added with NaCl and BSA (as above), and the resin was incubated on ice for 10 min. Samples were washed three times with 50 mm HEPES buffer at the corresponding pH before being eluted by addition of 400 mm NaCl (final, 500 mm NaCl) in a volume of ∼100 μl. Samples were normalized to mCitrine fluorescence on the basis of fluorometer readings of mCitrine excitation. Gels were imaged for fluorescence using a Typhoon gel imager (GE Healthcare) and analyzed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). HeLa cells were cultured in culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 4.5 g/liter D-glucose, 1% Glutamax, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic) and incubated at 37 °C at 5% CO2. Constructs were transfected into HeLa cells using FuGENE HD (Promega) in medium without antibiotics. 3T3 Flp-in and CHO Flp-in cell lines stably expressing the FAK sensors were generated and propagated in accordance with the protocol of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Stable lines were cultured in culture medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen) as the selection reagent. The wound-healing assay was performed as described previously (31Liang C.C. Park A.Y. Guan J.L. In vitro scratch assay. A convenient and inexpensive method for analysis of cell migration in vitro.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (3125) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were transfected as described above. Two days post-transfection, cells were trypsinized, washed in culture medium, and ∼450,000 cells were replated on fibronectin-coated 35-mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek Corp.). Cells were allowed to adhere for ∼2 h before a wound was created with a 10-μl gel-loading pipette tip. Two parallel wounds separated by ∼260 μm were created per plate. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in serum-free culture medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS. Cell migration was imaged ∼8 h after the wound was created. Cell migration was analyzed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) by calculating the average width of the gap (total area of the wound with confluent sides divided by the length of that area). Cells were imaged at ×60 magnification using a Nikon TiE microscope equipped with a mercury arc lamp, ×63 and 100 × 1.4 Numerical Aperture Plan-Apo oil objectives, and a Dual-View filter setup (Photometrics) for simultaneous acquisition of mCerulean and mCitrine fluorescence on an Evolve 512 × 512 EM-Charge-Coupled-Device camera (Photometrics).

The aim of the present analysis is to assess the effects of the endpoint adjudication process on the main findings of the ADVANCE trial (Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00145925).The ADVANCE trial was a multicentre, 2 × 2 factorial randomised controlled trial of blood pressure lowering and intensive blood glucose control in 11140 patients with type 2 diabetes. Primary outcomes were major macrovascular (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke and cardiovascular death) and microvascular (new or worsening nephropathy and retinopathy) events. Suspected primary outcomes were initially reported by the investigators at the 215 sites with subsequent adjudication by the EPAC. The EPAC also adjudicated upon potential events identified directly by ongoing screening of all reported events. Over a median follow-up of 5 years, the site investigators reported one or more primary outcomes among 2443 participants. After adjudication these events were confirmed for 2077 (85%) with 48 further events added through the EPAC-led database screening process. The estimated relative risk reductions (95% confidence intervals) in the primary outcome for the blood pressure lowering comparison were 8% (-1 to 15%) based on the investigator-reported events and 9% (0 to 17%) based on the EPAC-based events (P for homogeneity = 0.70). The corresponding findings for the glucose comparison were 8% (1 to 15%) and 10% (2% to 18%) (P for homogeneity = 0.60). The effect estimates were also highly comparable when studied separately for macrovascular events and microvascular events for both comparisons (all P for homogeneity>0.6).The endpoint adjudication process had no discernible impact on the main findings in ADVANCE. These data highlight the need for careful consideration of the likely impact of an EPAC on the findings and conclusions of clinical trials prior to their establishment."
https://openalex.org/W2004783655,"The ASCTs (alanine, serine, and cysteine transporters) belong to the solute carrier family 1 (SLC1), which also includes the human glutamate transporters (excitatory amino acid transporters, EAATs) and the prokaryotic aspartate transporter GltPh. Despite the high degree of amino acid sequence identity between family members, ASCTs function quite differently from the EAATs and GltPh. The aim of this study was to mutate ASCT1 to generate a transporter with functional properties of the EAATs and GltPh, to further our understanding of the structural basis for the different transport mechanisms of the SLC1 family. We have identified three key residues involved in determining differences between ASCT1, the EAATs and GltPh. ASCT1 transporters containing the mutations A382T, T459R, and Q386E were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and their transport and anion channel functions were investigated. A382T and T459R altered the substrate selectivity of ASCT1 to allow the transport of acidic amino acids, particularly l-aspartate. The combination of A382T and T459R within ASCT1 generates a transporter with a similar profile to that of GltPh, with preference for l-aspartate over l-glutamate. Interestingly, the amplitude of the anion conductance activated by the acidic amino acids does not correlate with rates of transport, highlighting the distinction between these two processes. Q386E impaired the ability of ASCT1 to bind acidic amino acids at pH 5.5; however, this was reversed by the additional mutation A382T. We propose that these residues differences in TM7 and TM8 combine to determine differences in substrate selectivity between members of the SLC1 family."
https://openalex.org/W2071311608,"The human homologue of yeast Rrn3 is an RNA polymerase I-associated transcription factor that is essential for ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription. The generally accepted model is that Rrn3 functions as a bridge between RNA polymerase I and the transcription factors bound to the committed template. In this model Rrn3 would mediate an interaction between the mammalian Rrn3-polymerase I complex and SL1, the rDNA transcription factor that binds to the core promoter element of the rDNA. In the course of studying the role of Rrn3 in recruitment, we found that Rrn3 was in fact a DNA-binding protein. Analysis of the sequence of Rrn3 identified a domain with sequence similarity to the DNA binding domain of heat shock transcription factor 2. Randomization, or deletion, of the amino acids in this region in Rrn3, amino acids 382-400, abrogated its ability to bind DNA, indicating that this domain was an important contributor to DNA binding by Rrn3. Control experiments demonstrated that these mutant Rrn3 constructs were capable of interacting with both rpa43 and SL1, two other activities demonstrated to be essential for Rrn3 function. However, neither of these Rrn3 mutants was capable of functioning in transcription in vitro. Moreover, although wild-type human Rrn3 complemented a yeast rrn3-ts mutant, the DNA-binding site mutant did not. These results demonstrate that DNA binding by Rrn3 is essential for transcription by RNA polymerase I."
https://openalex.org/W2075119822,"Determination of antigen-specific T cell repertoires in human blood has been a challenge. Here, we show a novel integrated approach that permits determination of multiple parameters of antigen-specific T cell repertoires. The approach consists of two assays: the Direct assay and the Cytokine-driven assay. Briefly, human PBMCs are first stimulated with overlapping peptides encoding a given antigen for 48 hours to measure cytokine secretion (Direct assay). Peptide-reactive T cells are further expanded by IL-2 for 5 days; and after overnight starvation, expanded cells are stimulated with the same peptides from the initial culture to analyze cytokine secretion (Cytokine-driven assay). We first applied this integrated approach to determine the type of islet-antigen-specific T cells in healthy adults. Out of ten donors, the Direct assay identified GAD65-specific CD4+ T cells in three adults and zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8)-specific CD4+ T cells in five adults. The intracytoplasmic cytokine staining assay showed that these islet-antigen-specific CD4+ T cells belonged to the CD45RO+ memory compartment. The Cytokine-driven assay further revealed that islet-antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in healthy adults were capable of secreting various types of cytokines including type 1 and type 2 cytokines as well as IL-10. We next applied our integrated assay to determine whether the type of ZnT8-specific CD4+ T cells is different between Type 1 diabetes patients and age/gender/HLA-matched healthy adults. We found that ZnT8-specific CD4+ T cells were skewed towards Th1 cells in T1D patients, while Th2 and IL-10-producing cells were prevalent in healthy adults. In conclusion, the Direct assay and the Cytokine-driven assay complement each other, and the combination of the two assays provides information of antigen-specific T cell repertoires on the breadth, type, and avidity. This strategy is applicable to determine the differences in the quality of antigen-specific T cells between health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2056692956,"The EphA4 receptor tyrosine kinase is a major regulator of axonal growth and astrocyte reactivity and is a possible inflammatory mediator. Given that multiple sclerosis (MS) is primarily an inflammatory demyelinating disease and in mouse models of MS, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), axonal degeneration and reactive gliosis are prominent clinical features, we hypothesised that endogenous EphA4 could play a role in modulating EAE. EAE was induced in EphA4 knockout and wildtype mice using MOG peptide immunisation and clinical severity and histological features of the disease were then compared in lumbar spinal cord sections. EphA4 knockout mice exhibited a markedly less severe clinical course than wildtype mice, with a lower maximum disease grade and a slightly later onset of clinical symptoms. Numbers of infiltrating T cells and macrophages, the number and size of the lesions, and the extent of astrocytic gliosis were similar in both genotypes; however, EphA4 knockout mice appeared to have decreased axonal pathology. Blocking of EphA4 in wildtype mice by administration of soluble EphA4 (EphA4-Fc) as a decoy receptor following induction of EAE produced a delay in onset of clinical symptoms; however, most mice had clinical symptoms of similar severity by 22 days, indicating that EphA4 blocking treatment slowed early EAE disease evolution. Again there were no apparent differences in histopathology. To determine whether the role of EphA4 in modulating EAE was CNS mediated or due to an altered immune response, MOG primed T cells from wildtype and EphA4 knockout mice were passively transferred into naive recipient mice and both were shown to induce disease of equivalent severity. These results are consistent with a non-inflammatory, CNS specific, deleterious effect of EphA4 during neuroinflammation that results in axonal pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2116809337,"Sheep rearing is the main productive activity in Patagonian rangelands, where guanacos are the only native ungulate. Ranchers perceive a decrease in range carrying capacity as guanaco numbers increase, therefore guanaco conservation within private lands becomes a considerable challenge. This issue is particularly evident in the World Natural Heritage Península Valdés (PV), where there is a need to harmonize livestock production and biodiversity conservation. While sheep rearing prevails as the primary land use in the area, some ecotourism initiatives have been implemented to complement livestock production. In order to study how land use affected guanaco distribution, we characterized PV's ranches in terms of land subdivision, primary productivity, stocking-rate and management type, and assess how these variables affected guanaco encounter rates. Smaller ranches were composed of smaller paddocks (mean size 4.8 km(2)), which showed higher values of the remote-sensing derived Enhance Vegetation Index (EVI) (mean 0.14) and held higher sheep densities (mean 108.0 sheep/km(2)), while larger management units (mean size 23.8 km(2)), showed lower EVI values (mean 0.12) and lower stocking-rates (mean 36.7 sheep/km(2)). This pattern suggests that primary productivity has been a decisive factor to determine the minimal paddock size set by ranchers in PV, apparently precluding excessive land-subdivision in less productive areas. Guanaco encounter rate, expressed as number of guanacos per travelled kilometre, was inversely related to EVI and stocking-rate. However, land subdivision was the better predictor of guanaco encounter-rate within only sheep ranches, finding more guanacos per kilometre as paddock size increased. In contrast, in ranches where ecotourism was implemented as a complementary activity, guanaco encounter-rates were greater, regardless of paddock size. Our results suggest that the implementation of an additional activity by which landowners derive benefits from wildlife has prompted a beneficial outcome for guanacos, presumably through a decrease in harassment intensity. Finally, we propose possible mechanisms by which land subdivision may affect guanaco distribution and potential alternatives for the inclusion of wildlife conservation in a context of extensive livestock production."
https://openalex.org/W1987178353,"Allergic inflammation and severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) are important in allergen induced diseases. Bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are ubiquitous and can facilitate allergen induced Th2 immune responses. Phosphatase SHP-1 is critical in regulating immunological homeostasis and in allergen induced Th2 immune responses in the lung. However, the mechanisms underlying the initiation of allergic inflammation and allergen induced anaphylaxis are still not completely elucidated and it is unclear whether SHP-1 plays any role in LPS-induced airway inflammation and in allergen-induced anaphylaxis. In this study we tested the hypothesis that phosphatase SHP-1 plays an important role in allergic inflammation and anaphylaxis and determined whether its effects are through regulation of mast cell functions. SHP-1 deficient (mev/+ and mev/mev) and mast cell deficient (KitW-sh) mice were examined in their responses to LPS airway stimulation and to ovalbumin (OVA) allergen induced systemic anaphylaxis. Compared to wild type mice, mev/+ mice had significantly enhanced LPS induced airway inflammation and OVA induced anaphylactic responses, including hypothermia and clinical symptoms. These changes were mast cell dependent as KitW-sh mice had reduced responses whereas adoptive transfer of mast cells restored the responses. However, T and B cells were not involved and macrophages did not play a significant role in LPS induced airway inflammation. Interestingly, basophil differentiation from SHP-1 deficient bone marrow cells was significantly reduced. These findings provided evidence that through regulation of mast cell functions SHP-1 plays a critical role as a negative regulator in allergic inflammation and in allergen induced anaphylaxis. In addition, SHP-1 seems to be required for normal basophil development."
https://openalex.org/W2132307757,"L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia is a common side effect developed after chronic treatment with 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-l-alanine (l-DOPA) in Parkinson's disease. The biological mechanisms behind this side effect are not fully comprehended although involvement of dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic systems has been suggested. The present study utilizes in vivo amperometry to investigate the impact from unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions and l-DOPA (4 mg/kg, including benserazide 15 mg/kg) -induced dyskinetic behavior on striatal basal extracellular glutamate concentration and potassium-evoked glutamate release in urethane-anesthetized rats. Recordings were performed before and after local L-DOPA application in the striatum. In addition, effects from the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist (2R)-(+)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin hydrobromide (8-OHDPAT; 1 mg/kg) was assessed on glutamate release and on dyskinetic behavior. The results revealed a bilateral ≈ 30% reduction of basal extracellular glutamate concentration and attenuated potassium-evoked glutamate release after a unilateral dopamine-depletion in L-DOPA naïve animals. In dyskinetic subjects, basal glutamate concentration was comparable to normal controls, although potassium-evoked glutamate release was reduced to similar levels as in drug naïve dopamine-lesioned animals. Furthermore, acute striatal L-DOPA administration attenuated glutamate release in all groups, except in the dopamine-lesioned striatum of dyskinetic animals. Co-administration of 8-OHDPAT and L-DOPA decreased dyskinesia in dopamine-lesioned animals, but did not affect potassium-evoked glutamate release, which was seen in normal animals. These findings indicate altered glutamate transmission upon dopamine-depletion and dyskinesia."
https://openalex.org/W2037059653,"Breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1) is a predominantly nuclear protein that suppresses metastasis in multiple human and murine carcinoma cell lines. BRMS1 interacts with several nuclear proteins including SIN3:HDAC chromatin remodeling complexes that are involved in repressing transcription. However, recent reports suggest BRMS1 may function in the cytoplasm. BRMS1 has two predicted nuclear localization sequences (NLS) that are located near the C-terminus (amino acids 198-205 and 238-244, NLS1 and NLS2 respectively). We hypothesized that nuclear localization sequences of BRMS1 were essential for BRMS1 mediated metastasis suppression. Replacement of NLS2 with NLS1 (BRMS1(NLS1,1)), truncation at 238 (BRMS1(ΔNLS2)), or switching the location of NLS1 and NLS2 (BRMS1(NLS2,1)) did not affect nuclear localization; but, replacement of NLS1 with NLS2 (BRMS1(NLS2,2)) or truncation at 197 (BRMS1(ΔNLS) which removes both NLS) promoted cytoplasmic localization. MDA-MB-231 human metastatic breast cancer cells transduced with BRMS1(NLS1,1), BRMS1(NLS2,2) or BRMS1(NLS2,1) were evaluated for metastasis suppression in an experimental xenograft mouse model. Interestingly, while NLS2 was not necessary for nuclear localization, it was found to be important for metastasis suppression since BRMS1(NLS2,2) suppressed metastasis by 85%. In contrast, BRMS1(NLS2,1) and BRMS1(NLS1,1) did not significantly suppress metastasis. Both BRMS1 and BRMS1(NLS2,2) co-immunoprecipitated with SIN3A in the nucleus and cytoplasm; however, BRMS1(NLS1,1) and BRMS1(NLS2,1) were associated with SIN3A in the nucleus only. Moreover, BRMS1 and BRMS1(NLS2,2), but not BRMS1(NLS1,1) and BRMS1(NLS2,1), down-regulated the pro-metastatic microRNA, miR-10b. Together, these data demonstrate an important role for NLS2 in the cytoplasm that is critical for metastasis suppression and is distinct from nuclear localization."

Increased NPM1 export into the cytoplasm probably perturbs multiple cellular pathways by delocalizing the proteins that interact with NPM1. By using a transgenic mouse model expressing the human NPMc+ mutation, it has been shown that NPMc+ confers a proliferative advantage in the myeloid lineage, suggesting that NPM1 mutations can participate in leukemia development (19Grisendi S.

In the present study, we found that wild-type NPM1 (Wt-NPM1) down-regulates, whereas mutated NPM1 (Mt-NPM1) up-regulates, the transcriptional activity of MEF/ELF4 on the human MDM2 (HDM2) promoter. The expression of Mt-NPM1 in MEF/ELF4-overexpressing NIH3T3 cells resulted in enhanced malignant transformation. We also found that HDM2 mRNA expression in primary AML cells with NPM1 mutations is significantly higher compared with AML cells without NPM1 mutations. Taken together, our data suggest that NPM1 mutations may promote transformation by enhancing the oncogenic functions of MEF/ELF4. 293T cells (CRL-11268, ATCC (Manassas, VA)) were maintained at 37 °C in DMEM (Invitrogen) with bovine calf serum. U937 cells (CRL-1593.2, ATCC) were maintained with 10% (v/v) FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Fisher). NIH3T3 cells (CRL-1658, ATCC) were maintained under identical conditions with 10% (v/v) FBS and grown in RPMI 1640 (Fisher) with 10% FCS (HyClone, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. COS7 cells (CRL-1651, ATCC) were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% FCS. The cDNA of MEF/ELF4 was inserted into InterPlay N-terminal mammalian TAP vector (pTAP/MEF/ELF4, Stratagene (San Diego, CA)) comprising two affinity tags (immunoglobulin G (IgG)-binding domain and calmodulin-binding peptide) separated by the cleavage site of tobacco etch virus protease (20Rigaut G.

Transfected cells were collected and lysed in a solution containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with IgG-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare), after which the resin was washed and incubated with tobacco etch virus protease for 2 h at 16 °C. Purification on calmodulin affinity resin (Stratagene) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, resolved with 1× sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and protein bands were cut out. Proteins were eluted with trypsin. The resulting peptides were analyzed with a Procise 49X cLC protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) (20Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M.

NPM1 protein (biotin-NPM1) was in vitro-translated with pTnT-NPM1 and labeled with biotinylated lysine (Transcend tRNA, Promega) by using the TNT Quick Coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). The cDNA of MEF/ELF4 was inserted into pET-3a (Novagen, VWR (Lisbon, Portugal)), which allows the introduction of a His tag into the N terminus of MEF/ELF4 (pET/MEF/ELF4). Overexpression of the recombinant protein (His-MEF/ELF4) was achieved in Escherichia coli BL21Gold (DE3) cells (Stratagene) transformed with the constructed plasmid pET/MEF/ELF4. His-MEF/ELF4 was isolated from cells broken in lysis buffer (STE buffer) with sonication and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C (1Miyazaki Y. Sun X. Uchida H. Zhang J. Nimer S.

Biotin-NPM1 was incubated with His-MEF/ELF4 or His (as a control) proteins at 4 °C for 1 h. The mixture was loaded onto His spin traps (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 500 mm imidazole at pH 7.4. After SDS-PAGE and electroblotting, biotin-NPM1 in purified samples was detected by using the Transcend non-radioactive translation detection system (Promega).

After 48 h, cells were lysed by using the Universal Magnetic co-immunoprecipitation kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions for nuclear extraction. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove the resin. The resulting supernatants were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 5 μg of antibodies against FLAG (Sigma), 5 μg of antibodies against V5 (Invitrogen), or normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoprecipitates were recovered, washed four times with ice-cold co-immunoprecipitation solution (Active Motif), and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were transferred to a membrane. After incubation in blocking buffer, membranes were probed with peroxidase-labeled antibodies against FLAG (Sigma), V5 (Invitrogen), or tag (Invitrogen). Detection was achieved with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL Advance Western blotting detection kit, GE Healthcare). Quantification of Western blotting bands was performed by using AE-6982/C/FC and CS Analyzer version 3.0 software (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). Fusion protein of GST and Wt-NPM1 (GST-NPM1) and GST-NPM1 deletion mutant constructs (Fig. 1C) were generated by PCR with pcDNA/Wt-NPM1 as a template. PCR products were cloned in-frame into bacterial expression vector pGEX-T4. Plasmids that express GST fusion protein (GST-NPM1, GST-NPM1 deletion mutants) and His-MEF/ELF4 protein (pET/MEF/ELF4) or their controls were transfected into E. coli. Bacterial pellets were lysed in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with sonication. His-MEF/ELF4 or His alone was incubated with an equivalent amount of GST, GST-Wt-NPM1, or GST-Wt-NPM1 deletion mutants for 1 h at 4 °C. Proteins were purified by using GST columns (MicroSpin GST Purification Module, GE Healthcare) or His columns. Bound proteins were analyzed by using SDS-PAGE/immunoblot. Recombinant proteins GST, GST-NPM1, His, and His-MEF/ELF4 were collected as described above. Nuclear protein from 293T cells transfected with pcDNA/MEF/ELF4, pcDNA/Wt-NPM1, or pcDNA/Mt-A-NPM1 was extracted with the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. EMSA was performed by using the LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce). Recombinant protein or nuclear extracts were incubated with 20 fmol of biotin 3′-end-labeled oligonucleotides containing APET (an ETS binding site in the IL-3 promoter that was shown to bind to MEF/ELF4) (1Miyazaki Y. Sun X. Uchida H. Zhang J. Nimer S. A novel transcription factor with an Elf-1 like DNA binding domain but distinct transcriptional activating properties.Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1721-1729PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, transfer, and cross-linking, the signal was detected by a peroxidase/luminol system (chemiluminescent nucleic acid detection module, Pierce). To confirm specificity, a 200-fold excess amount of non-labeled oligonucleotides (APET competitor) (1Miyazaki Y. Sun X. Uchida H. Zhang J. Nimer S.

The DNA sequence of the APET oligonucleotide is 5′-CCTCAGTGAGCTGAGTCAGGCTTCCCCTTCCTGCCACAGGG-3′. siRNA for NPM1 was transfected into 293T cells by using the GeneClip U1 hairpin cloning system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The siRNA sequence-targeting NPM1 gene corresponded to nucleotides 103–125 of the coding region relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon, as described previously (22Colombo E. Marine J.C.

Cell lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was determined by using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). NIH3T3 cells were plated on 24-well dishes in soft agar containing DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS after they were transfected with various combinations of empty vector, pcDNA/MEF/ELF4, pcDNA/Wt-NPM1, or pcDNA/Mt-A-NPM1 and cultured for 2 weeks. Images were taken with a Leica DM IRBE inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) with a ×10 objective lens. MEF/ELF4 was cloned into the pGFP-C3 vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) (pGFP-MEF/ELF4). 293T cells were transfected with the empty vector, pGFP-MEF/ELF4, pcDNA/V-Wt-NPM1, or pcDNA/V-Mt-A-NPM1. Cells were harvested 3 days after transfection. Cytospin samples were fixed for 15 min in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed coverslips were washed twice in TBS, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and incubated in Image-iT FX signal enhancer (Invitrogen) for 30 min. Cells were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h and then washed extensively in TBS before incubation with Alexa546-conjugated goat anti-mouse-IgG antibody (dilution 1:2000; Invitrogen) for 1 h. Cells were covered with a drop of ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Fluorescent images were obtained by using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 5 Pascal V3.2, Carl Zeiss). 293T cells were transfected with empty vector, pcDNA/MEF-FLAG, pcDNA/Wt-NPM1, or pcDNA/Mt-A-NPM1 by using a nucleofection kit (Qiagen). After 48 h of culture at 26 °C, cells were fixed by the addition of 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. Chromatin isolation and shearing were performed by using the OneDay ChIP kit (Diagenode, Liege, Belgium) and Shearing-ChIP kit (Diagenode) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation reactions were performed with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or isotype control IgG (BD Biosciences). Samples were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) by using the LightCycler DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science) as specified by the manufacturer. The primer sequences for the HDM2 promoter were 5′-GAACGCTGCGCGTAGTCTGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACTGCAGTTTCGGAACGTGT-3′ (reverse). Informed consent for sample collection was obtained according to protocols approved by the International Review Board of Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan (approval number 33-3). Bone marrow aspirates were collected from 22 AML patients before the initiation of chemotherapy. CD34-positive cells were isolated by using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and magnetic beads (CD34 Isolation Kit, Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) to minimize the confounding effect of MEF/ELF4 and NPM1 expression by mature myeloid cells. For the screening of NPM1 mutations, genomic DNA corresponding to exon 12 was amplified by using forward primer 5′-TTAACTCTCTGGTGGTAGAATGAA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CAAGACTATTTGCCATTCCTAAC-3′, as reported previously. Amplified products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified by using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and directly sequenced by using a DNA sequencer (3100, Applied Biosystems) with the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). When mutations were found by direct sequencing, the fragments were cloned into a pTOPO vector (Invitrogen) and then transfected into the E. coli strain DH5A. At least four recombinant colonies were selected, and plasmid DNA samples were prepared by using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen). Cloned fragments were sequenced to confirm the mutation of the NPM1 gene. Total RNA was harvested from purified CD34-positive cells by using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis was undertaken by using an oligo(dT) primer with the PrimeScript II first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Takara, Shiga, Japan). These cDNA molecules were measured by RQ-PCR with the primers listed under “RQ-PCR.” RQ-PCR was performed by using a LightCycler TaqMan Master kit (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty microliters of Universal ProbeLibrary probes (Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark) were added in the final reaction. Primers designed by using the Universal ProbeLibrary Assay Design Centre (available on the Roche Applied Science Web site) were synthesized by Sigma. PCR amplification was performed by using a LightCycler 350S instrument (Roche Applied Science). Thermal cycling conditions comprised 2 min at 40 °C and 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 45 amplification cycles at 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 s and then a 40 °C cooling cycle for 30 s. Specific primers and probes were as follows: for HDM2, forward (5′-TCTGATAGTATTTCCCTTTCCTTTG-3′), reverse (5′-TGTTCACTTACACCAGCATCAA-3′), and probe (5′-CGCCACTTTTTCTCTGCTGATCCAGG-3′); for human MEF/ELF4, forward (5′-TGGAGACTCTCAGGGTCGAAA-3′), reverse (5′-AAGCAACGGGATGGATGAT-3′), and probe (5′-TCACAGCTGGGAACACAGAG-3′); and for human G6PDH, forward (5′-AAGCAACGGGATGGATGAT-3′), reverse (5′-TCACAGCTGGGAACACAGAG-3′), and probe (5′-CGCCACTTTTTCTCTGCTGATCCAGG-3′). Comparisons of patient characteristics between two groups were performed with the Wilcoxon test. The results of in vivo experiments are presented as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments and compared by using one-way analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's multiple comparison test. A p value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To identify the proteins that bind to MEF/ELF4, we performed the tandem affinity purification (TAP) procedure and analyzed the amino acid sequence of the protein complex, thereby identifying 25 proteins (including NPM1). NPM1 is essential for embryonic development and is frequently translocated or mutated in hematological malignancies (24Grisendi S. Mecucci C. Falini B. Pandolfi P.P. Nucleophosmin and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to focus on the interaction between NPM1 and MEF/ELF4. To determine if Wt-NPM1 interacts with MEF/ELF4 in human cells, we transfected 293T cells with FLAG-MEF/ELF4 and V5-Wt-NPM1 expression plasmids and performed immunoprecipitations with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG or anti-V5 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, FLAG-MEF/ELF4 protein co-precipitated with V5-Wt-NPM1 by the anti-V5 antibody (lane 1) but not by the isotype-matched control (lane 2). In reciprocal experiments, V5-Wt-NPM1 protein co-precipitated with FLAG-MEF/ELF4 protein by the anti-FLAG antibody (lane 3). These results showed the in vivo interaction between Wt-NPM1 and MEF/ELF4. To ascertain whether Wt-NPM1 protein interacted directly with MEF/ELF4, an in vitro association assay with biotin-labeled in vitro-translated Wt-NPM1 and bacterially recombinant His-MEF/ELF4 fusion protein was performed (Fig. 1B). Biotin-labeled Wt-NPM1 bound to His-MEF/ELF4 (lane 1) but not to His alone (lane 2). These results demonstrated that His-MEF/ELF4 bound directly to Wt-NPM1. To characterize the region of Wt-NPM1 that binds MEF/ELF4, five distinct GST-NPM1 proteins were prepared (Fig. 1C). GST pull-down assays (Fig. 1D (a)) and His tag pull-down assays (Fig. 1D (b)) revealed that the N-terminal region of NPM1 (the F1, F2, and F3 fragments that contain the oligomerization domain) bound to His-MEF/ELF4, unlike the C-terminal region of NPM1 (F4 and F5).

These biocides are the active ingredients of a commercial larvicide. Quantitative data on the fate of both Bti and Lsph applied together for the control of mosquitoes in urban drainage structures such as catch basins are lacking. We evaluated the dynamics and persistence of Bti and Lsph spores released through their concomitant application in urban catch basins in southern Switzerland. Detection and quantification of spores over time in water and sludge samples from catch basins were carried out using quantitative real-time PCR targeting both cry4A and cry4B toxin genes for Bti and the binA gene for Lsph. After treatment, Bti and Lsph spores attained concentrations of 3.76 (±0.08) and 4.13 (±0.09) log ml−1 in water, then decreased progressively over time, reaching baseline values. For both Bti and Lsph, spore levels in the order of 105 g−1 were observed in the bottom sludge two days after the treatment and remained constant for the whole test period (275 days). Indigenous Lsph strains were isolated from previously untreated catch basins. A selection of those was genotyped using pulsed field gel electrophoresis of SmaI-digested chromosomal DNA, revealing that a subset of isolates were members of the clonal population of strain 2362. No safety issues related to the use of this biopesticide in the environment have been observed during this study, because no significant increase in the number of spores was seen during the long observation period. The isolation of native Lysinibacillus sphaericus strains belonging to the same clonal population as strain 2362 from catch basins never treated with Lsph-based products indicates that the use of a combination of Bti and Lsph for the control of mosquitoes does not introduce non-indigenous microorganisms in this area."
https://openalex.org/W2130576396,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by persistent inflammation and tissue remodeling and is a leading cause of death in the United States. Increased apoptosis of pulmonary epithelial cells is thought to play a role in COPD development and progression. Identification of signaling pathways resulting in increased apoptosis in COPD can be used in the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Deoxyadenosine (dAdo) is a DNA breakdown product that amplifies lymphocyte apoptosis by being phosphorylated to deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP). dAdo is maintained at low levels by adenosine deaminase (ADA). This study demonstrated that mice lacking ADA developed COPD manifestations in association with elevated dAdo and dATP levels and increased apoptosis in the lung. Deoxycitidine kinase (DCK), a major enzyme for dAdo phosphorylation, was up-regulated in mouse and human airway epithelial cells in association with air-space enlargement. Hypoxia was identified as a novel regulator of DCK, and inhibition of DCK resulted in diminished dAdo-mediated apoptosis in the lungs. Our results suggest that activating the dAdo-DCK-dATP pathway directly results in increased apoptosis in the lungs of mice with air-space enlargement and suggests a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of COPD.—Weng, T., Karmouty-Quintana, H., Garcia-Morales, L.

https://openalex.org/W2041894425,"Mycoplasmas cause chronic respiratory diseases in animals and humans, and to date, development of vaccines have been problematic. Using a murine model of mycoplasma pneumonia, lymphocyte responses, specifically T cells, were shown to confer protection as well as promote immunopathology in mycoplasma disease. Because T cells play such a critical role, it is important to define the role of antigen presenting cells (APC) as these cells may influence either exacerbation of mycoplasma disease pathogenesis or enhancement of protective immunity. The roles of APC, such as dendritic cells and/or macrophages, and their ability to modulate adaptive immunity in mycoplasma disease are currently unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify individual pulmonary APC populations that may contribute to the activation of T cell responses during mycoplasma disease pathogenesis. The present study indeed demonstrates increasing numbers of CD11c− F4/80+ cells, which contain macrophages, and more mature/activated CD11c+ F4/80− cells, containing DC, in the lungs after infection. CD11c− F4/80+ macrophage-enriched cells and CD11c+ F4/80− dendritic cell-enriched populations showed different patterns of cytokine mRNA expression, supporting the idea that these cells have different impacts on immunity in response to infection. In fact, DC containing CD11c+ F4/80− cell populations from the lungs of infected mice were most capable of stimulating mycoplasma-specific CD4+ Th cell responses in vitro. In vivo, these CD11c+F4/80− cells were co-localized with CD4+ Th cells in inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs of mycoplasma-infected mice. Thus, CD11c+F4/80− dendritic cells appear to be the major APC population responsible for pulmonary T cell stimulation in mycoplasma-infected mice, and these dendritic cells likely contribute to responses impacting disease pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2012950793,"The endothelial cell-specific chemotaxis receptor (ECSCR) is a cell-surface protein selectively expressed by endothelial cells (ECs), with roles in EC migration, apoptosis and proliferation. Our previous study (Verma, A., Bhattacharya, R., Remadevi, I., Li, K., Pramanik, K., Samant, G. V., Horswill, M., Chun, C. Z., Zhao, B., Wang, E., Miao, R. Q., Mukhopadhyay, D., Ramchandran, R., and Wilkinson, G. A. (2010) Blood 115, 4614-4622) showed that loss of ECSCR in primary ECs reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2/kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) but not VEGF receptor 1/FLT1. Here, we show that ECSCR biochemically associates with KDR but not FLT1 and that the predicted ECSCR cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions can each confer association with KDR. Stimulation with VEGF165 rapidly and transiently increases ECSCR-KDR complex formation, a process blocked by the KDR tyrosine kinase inhibitor compound SU5416 or inhibitors of endosomal acidification. Triple labeling experiments show VEGF-stimulated KDR(+)/ECSCR(+) intracellular co-localization. Silencing of ECSCR disrupts VEGF-induced KDR activation and AKT and ERK phosphorylation and impairs VEGF-stimulated KDR degradation. In zebrafish, ecscr interacts with kdrl during intersomitic vessel sprouting. Human placenta and infantile hemangioma samples highly express ECSCR protein, suggesting a role for ECSCR-KDR interaction in these tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2073320133,"Separating digestive and urinary outlets is a critical step during mammalian embryogenesis. However, the natural history of these structures is poorly studied, and little is known about their embryonic origin. Here, we show that peri-cloacal mesenchymal (PCM) progenitors are the major source of these structures. Surprisingly, PCM progenitors also contribute to perineum, a structural barrier separating the urinary and digestive tracts, suggesting a potential role of PCM progenitors in establishing independent urinary and digestive outlets. We demonstrate that Six1 and Six2 are complementarily but asymmetrically expressed in the PCM progenitors. Deletion of these genes results in decreased cell survival and proliferation, and consequently in agenesis of the perineum and severe hypoplasia of the genital tubercle. Together, these findings suggest that PCM progenitors are the unexpected source of perineum and genital tubercle, and establish a basic framework for investigating normal and abnormal development of anorectal and genitourinary structures."
https://openalex.org/W2088262268,"Mathematical modeling of biochemical processes significantly contributes to a better understanding of biological functionality and underlying dynamic mechanisms. To support time consuming and costly lab experiments, kinetic reaction equations can be formulated as a set of ordinary differential equations, which in turn allows to simulate and compare hypothetical models in silico. To identify new experimental designs that are able to discriminate between investigated models, the approach used in this work solves a semi-infinite constrained nonlinear optimization problem using derivative based numerical algorithms. The method takes into account parameter variabilities such that new experimental designs are robust against parameter changes while maintaining the optimal potential to discriminate between hypothetical models. In this contribution we present a newly developed software tool that offers a convenient graphical user interface for model discrimination. We demonstrate the beneficial operation of the discrimination approach and the usefulness of the software tool by analyzing a realistic benchmark experiment from literature. New robust optimal designs that allow to discriminate between the investigated model hypotheses of the benchmark experiment are successfully calculated and yield promising results. The involved robustification approach provides maximally discriminating experiments for the worst parameter configurations, which can be used to estimate the meaningfulness of upcoming experiments. A major benefit of the graphical user interface is the ability to interactively investigate the model behavior and the clear arrangement of numerous variables. In addition to a brief theoretical overview of the discrimination method and the functionality of the software tool, the importance of robustness of experimental designs against parameter variability is demonstrated on a biochemical benchmark problem.

https://openalex.org/W2087575594,"Background Serum amyloid P component (SAP) is a glycoprotein that is universally found associated with different types of amyloid deposits. It has been suggested that it stabilizes amyloid fibrils and therefore protects them from proteolytic degradation. Methodology/Principal Findings In this paper, we show that SAP binds not only to mature amyloid fibrils but also to early aggregates of amyloidogenic mutants of the plasma protein transthyretin (TTR). It does not inhibit fibril formation of TTR mutants, which spontaneously form amyloid in vitro at physiological pH. We found that SAP prevents cell death induced by mutant TTR, while several other molecules that are also known to decorate amyloid fibrils do not have such effect. Using a Drosophila model for TTR-associated amyloidosis, we found a new role for SAP as a protective factor in inhibition of TTR-induced toxicity. Overexpression of mutated TTR leads to a neurological phenotype with changes in wing posture. SAP-transgenic flies were crossed with mutated TTR-expressing flies and the results clearly confirmed a protective effect of SAP on TTR-induced phenotype, with an almost complete reduction in abnormal wing posture. Furthermore, we found in vivo that binding of SAP to mutated TTR counteracts the otherwise detrimental effects of aggregation of amyloidogenic TTR on retinal structure. Conclusions/Significance Together, these two approaches firmly establish the protective effect of SAP on TTR-induced cell death and degenerative phenotypes, and suggest a novel role for SAP through which the toxicity of early amyloidogenic aggregates is attenuated."
https://openalex.org/W2075388057,"Autoinhibited p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) can be activated in vitro by the plasma membrane-bound Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 as well as by the lipid phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2). Activator binding is mediated by a GTPase-binding motif and an adjacent phosphoinositide-binding motif. Whether these two classes of activators play alternative, additive, or synergistic roles in Pak1 activation is unknown, as is their contributions to Pak1 activation in vivo. To address these questions, we developed a system to mimic the membrane anchoring of Rho GTPases by creating liposomes containing both PIP2 and a Ni(2+)-NTA modified lipid capable of binding hexahistidine-tagged Cdc42. We find that among all biologically relevant phosphoinositides, only PIP2 is able to synergistically activate Pak1 in concert with Cdc42. Membrane binding of the kinase was highly sensitive to the spatial density of PIP2 and Pak1 demonstrated dramatically enhanced affinity for Cdc42 anchored in a PIP2 environment. To validate these findings in vivo, we utilized an inducible recruitment system to drive the ectopic synthesis of PIP2 on Golgi membranes, which normally have active Cdc42 but lack significant concentrations of PIP2. Pak1 was recruited to PIP2-containing membranes in a manner dependent on the ability of Pak1 to bind to both PIP2 and Cdc42. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the essential role of both phosphoinositides and GTPases in Pak1 recruitment and activation. In contrast, Ack, another Cdc42 effector kinase that lacks an analogous phosphoinositide-binding motif, fails to show the same enhancement of membrane binding and activation by PIP2, thus indicating that regulation by PIP2 and Cdc42 could provide a combinatorial code for activation of different GTPase effectors in different subcellular locations."
https://openalex.org/W1979845898,"CfaE, the tip adhesin of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli colonization factor antigen I fimbriae, initiates binding of this enteropathogen to the small intestine. It comprises stacked β-sandwich adhesin (AD) and pilin (PD) domains, with the putative receptor-binding pocket at one pole and an equatorial interdomain interface. CfaE binding to erythrocytes is enhanced by application of moderate shear stress. A G168D replacement along the AD facing the CfaE interdomain region was previously shown to decrease the dependence on shear by increasing binding at lower shear forces. To elucidate the structural basis for this functional change, we studied the properties of CfaE G168D (with a self-complemented donor strand) and solved its crystal structure at 2.6 Å resolution. Compared with native CfaE, CfaE G168D showed a downward shift in peak erythrocyte binding under shear stress and greater binding under static conditions. The thermal melting transition of CfaE G168D occurred 10 °C below that of CfaE. Compared with CfaE, the atomic structure of CfaE G168D revealed a 36% reduction in the buried surface area at the interdomain interface. Despite the location of this single modification in the AD, CfaE G168D exhibited structural derangements only in the adjoining PD compared with CfaE. In molecular dynamics simulations, the G168D mutation was associated with weakened interdomain interactions under tensile force. Taken together, these findings indicate that the AD and PD of CfaE are conformationally tightly coupled and support the hypothesis that opening of the interface plays a critical modulatory role in the allosteric activation of CfaE."
https://openalex.org/W2046899794,"Heme is a cofactor for proteins participating in many important cellular processes, including respiration, oxygen metabolism and oxygen binding. The key enzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway is ferrochelatase (protohaem ferrolyase, EC 4.99.1.1), which catalyzes the insertion of ferrous iron into protoporphyrin IX. In higher plants, the ferrochelatase enzyme is localized not only in mitochondria, but also in chloroplasts. The plastidic type II ferrochelatase contains a C-terminal chlorophyll a/b (CAB) motif, a conserved hydrophobic stretch homologous to the CAB domain of plant light harvesting proteins and light-harvesting like proteins. This type II ferrochelatase, found in all photosynthetic organisms, is presumed to have evolved from the cyanobacterial ferrochelatase. Here we describe a detailed enzymological study on recombinant, refolded and functionally active type II ferrochelatase (FeCh) from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. A protocol was developed for the functional refolding and purification of the recombinant enzyme from inclusion bodies, without truncation products or soluble aggregates. The refolded FeCh is active in its monomeric form, however, addition of an N-terminal His6-tag has significant effects on its enzyme kinetics. Strikingly, removal of the C-terminal CAB-domain led to a greatly increased turnover number, kcat, compared to the full length protein. While pigments isolated from photosynthetic membranes decrease the activity of FeCh, direct pigment binding to the CAB domain of FeCh was not evident."
