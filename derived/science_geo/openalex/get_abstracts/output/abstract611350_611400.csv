https://openalex.org/W2803416021,"Precise detection of invasive cancer on whole-slide images (WSI) is a critical first step in digital pathology tasks of diagnosis and grading. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is the most popular representation learning method for computer vision tasks, which have been successfully applied in digital pathology, including tumor and mitosis detection. However, CNNs are typically only tenable with relatively small image sizes (200 × 200 pixels). Only recently, Fully convolutional networks (FCN) are able to deal with larger image sizes (500 × 500 pixels) for semantic segmentation. Hence, the direct application of CNNs to WSI is not computationally feasible because for a WSI, a CNN would require billions or trillions of parameters. To alleviate this issue, this paper presents a novel method, High-throughput Adaptive Sampling for whole-slide Histopathology Image analysis (HASHI), which involves: i) a new efficient adaptive sampling method based on probability gradient and quasi-Monte Carlo sampling, and, ii) a powerful representation learning classifier based on CNNs. We applied HASHI to automated detection of invasive breast cancer on WSI. HASHI was trained and validated using three different data cohorts involving near 500 cases and then independently tested on 195 studies from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The results show that (1) the adaptive sampling method is an effective strategy to deal with WSI without compromising prediction accuracy by obtaining comparative results of a dense sampling (∼6 million of samples in 24 hours) with far fewer samples (∼2,000 samples in 1 minute), and (2) on an independent test dataset, HASHI is effective and robust to data from multiple sites, scanners, and platforms, achieving an average Dice coefficient of 76%."
https://openalex.org/W2803648188,"This study investigated the effects of dietary sodium butyrate (SB) supplementation, provided as a specially coated product, on growth performance, intestinal development, morphological structure and function in broilers. In total, 720 one-day-old Arbor Acres male broilers were randomly allocated into six treatment groups with six replicates each and then fed basal diets (control) supplemented with 0, 200, 400, 800 or 1000 mg/kg of SB or with antibiotics (100 mg/kg aureomycin and 20 mg/kg colistin sulfate). The growth trial lasted for 42 days. No differences (P>0.05) in growth performance were detected between groups during the grower period (1-21 d) or over the total (1-42 d) trial period, whereas the addition of SB improved the intestinal structure by stimulating (P<0.05) goblet cells on jejunal and ileal villi accompanied by a trend towards increased (Pdiets<0.10) ileal villus height. In addition, more inerratic leaf-shaped villi and mucus secretion and significantly fewer erosions were demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. Apart from decreased (P<0.05) malondialdehyde (MDA) in the ileal mucosa at 21 d of age, supplemental SB at higher doses (800 mg/kg) led to greater (P<0.05) total antioxidant capacity and depressed (P<0.05) MDA concentrations in the jejunal mucosa. Birds fed with 400 mg/kg and 800 mg/kg SB had higher (P<0.05) acetic acid concentrations at 42 d and higher butyric acid at 21 d in the jejunum chyme. Morever, chicks fed SB diet were found to have higher concentrations of butyric acid (P<0.05) in the ileal chyme. SB additions at 400 mg/kg displayed higher Firmicutes and Proteobacteria levels, while a higher (P<0.05) relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was observed at 800 mg/kg. Furthermore, we found a striking decrease in Enterobacteriaceae and increases in Lachnospiraceae and Rikenellaceae in the cecal lumen of birds fed 800 mg/kg SB as well as a higher proportion of Ruminococcaceae and a noticeable reduction (P<0.05) of Lactobacillaceae in birds treated with 400 mg/kg SB. Taken together, our results support the importance of SB in improving the intestinal development, morphological structure and biological functions of broilers through modulation of the microbial community, which seems to be optimized for gut health at higher doses (800 mg/kg) of SB."
https://openalex.org/W2803289727,"Dietary supplementation with yeast derivatives (YD) contributes to the health and physiology of sows and piglets, but few studies have focused on how it influences gut health and performance of sows and piglets. The goal was therefore to examine whether YD, based on brewer’s yeast hydrolysate added to pregnancy diet, would affect colostrum composition, yield (CY) and gut microbiota of sows and piglets. Sows were allocated to either a control diet (n = 19) or a control diet supplemented with 2g YD/kg (n = 18) during the pregnancy. Piglets suckling belonging to the control sows (n = 114) and supplemented sows (n = 108) were also included in the study. Gut microbiota populations of sows at farrowing and piglets at one and four weeks of age were assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Colostrum samples were examined for nutritional composition and immunoglobulin (Ig) content. All piglets were individually weighed at birth and 24 hours later in order to calculate CY, and later at four weeks to calculate average daily gain (ADG). Protein, lactose and dry matter content of colostrum did not significantly differ between the two groups, while sows fed YD had higher levels of fat in their colostrum (P < 0.05). Immunoglobulin A, IgM and IgG levels in colostrum did not differ between the two groups (P >0.05). Colostrum yield was lower in the control than that in YD group (3701g vs. 4581 g; P <0.05). Although the YD supplementation did not change fecal bacteria diversity in sow, more beneficial and fermentative bacteria (Roseburia, Paraprevotella, Eubacterium) were found in the YD fed group (P <0.01) while, some opportunistic pathogens, including Proteobacteria, especially the genera Desulfovibrio, Escherichia/Shigella and Helicobacter, were suppressed. Piglets at one week of age from sows fed YD had more beneficial microbial populations with significant diversity and fewer opportunistic pathogens. Additionally, we established a Pearson’s correlations between CY, colostrum components, piglet birth weight and fecal microbiota. Therefore, YD added to the sow diet during pregnancy increases colostrum availability and its energy content for neonate piglets, also promoting beneficial maternal microbial sources for neonate."
https://openalex.org/W2803616836,"Smut caused by biotrophic fungus Sporisorium scitamineum is a major disease of cultivated sugarcane that can cause considerable yield losses. It has been suggested in literature that there are at least two types of resistance mechanisms in sugarcane plants: an external resistance, due to chemical or physical barriers in the sugarcane bud, and an internal resistance governed by the interaction of plant and fungus within the plant tissue. Detailed molecular studies interrogating these two different resistance mechanisms in sugarcane are scarce. Here, we use light microscopy and global expression profiling with RNA-seq to investigate these mechanisms in sugarcane cultivar CP74-2005, a cultivar that possibly possesses both internal and external defence mechanisms. A total of 861 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in a comparison between infected and non-infected buds at 48 hours post-inoculation (hpi), with 457 (53%) genes successfully annotated using BLAST2GO software. This includes genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway, cell wall biosynthesis, plant hormone signal transduction and disease resistance genes. Finally, the expression of 13 DEGs with putative roles in S. scitamineum resistance were confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, and the results were consistent with the RNA-seq data. These results highlight that the early sugarcane response to S. scitamineum infection is complex and many of the disease response genes are attenuated in sugarcane cultivar CP74-2005, while others, like genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway, are induced. This may point to the role of the different disease resistance mechanisms that operate in cultivars such as CP74-2005, whereby the early response is dominated by external mechanisms and then as the infection progresses, the internal mechanisms are switched on. Identification of genes underlying resistance in sugarcane will increase our knowledge of the sugarcane-S. scitamineum interaction and facilitate the introgression of new resistance genes into commercial sugarcane cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W2804856344,"Background Abnormal durations of sleep have been associated with risk of diabetes. However, it is not clear if sleep duration is associated with diabetic retinopathy (DR). Methods In a cross-sectional study, we included 1,231 (Malay, n = 395; Indian, n = 836) adults (mean age 64.4 ± 9.0 years, 50.4% female) with diabetes from the second visit of two independent population-based cohort studies (2011–15) in Singapore. Self-reported habitual sleep duration was categorized as short (<6 h), normal (6≤ h <8), and long (≥8 h). Questionnaires were administered to detect risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), excessive daytime sleepiness, and insomnia, all of which may indicate poor quality of sleep. The associations between sleep-related characteristics with moderate DR and vision-threatening DR (VTDR) were analysed using logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders. Results Prevalence of moderate DR and VTDR in the study population were 10.5% and 6.3% respectively. The mean duration of sleep was 6.4 ± 1.5 h. Compared to normal sleep duration, both short and long sleep durations were associated with moderate DR with multivariable odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 1.73 (1.03–2.89) and 2.17 (1.28–3.66) respectively. Long sleep duration (2.37 [1.16–4.89]), high risk of OSA (2.24 [1.09–4.75]), and excessive daytime sleepiness (3.27 [1.02–10.30]) were separately associated with VTDR. Conclusion Sleep duration had a U-shaped association with moderate DR; long sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness and high risk of OSA were positively associated with VTDR."
https://openalex.org/W2803265537,"Selecting optimal host plants is critical for herbivorous insects, such as fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda), an important maize pest in the Americas and Africa. Fall armyworm larvae are presumed to have limited mobility, hence female moths are presumed to be largely responsible for selecting hosts. We addressed host selection by fall armyworm moths and neonate and older (3rd-instar) larvae, as mediated by resistance and herbivory in maize plants. Thus, we compared discrimination among three maize cultivars with varying degrees of resistance to fall armyworm, and between plants subjected or not to two types of herbivory. The cultivars were: (i) susceptible, and deficient in jasmonic acid (JA) production and green leaf volatiles (GLV) emissions (inbred line B73-lox10); (ii) modestly resistant (B73), and; (iii) highly resistant (Mp708). The herbivory types were: (i) ongoing (= fall armyworm larvae present), and; (ii) future (= fall armyworm eggs present). In choice tests, moths laid more eggs on the highly resistant cultivar, and least on the susceptible cultivar, though on those cultivars larvae performed poorest and best, respectively. In the context of herbivory, moths laid more eggs: (i) on plants subject to versus free of future herbivory, regardless of whether plants were deficient or not in JA and GLV production; (ii) on plants subject versus free of ongoing herbivory, and; (iii) on plants not deficient in compared to deficient in JA and GLV production. Neonate larvae dispersed aerially from host plants (i.e. ballooned), and most larvae colonized the modestly resistant cultivar, and fewest the highly resistant cultivar, suggesting quasi-directional, directed aerial descent. Finally, dispersing older larvae did not discriminate among the three maize cultivars, nor between maize plants and (plastic) model maize plants, suggesting random, visually-oriented dispersal. Our results were used to assemble a model of host selection by fall armyworm moths and larvae, including recommendations for future research."
https://openalex.org/W2804420184,"The rapid expansion of oil palm cultivation in the Neotropics has generated great debate around possible biodiversity impacts. Colombia, for example, is the largest producer of oil palm in the Americas, but the effects of oil palm cultivation on native fauna are poorly understood. Here, we compared how richness, abundance and composition of terrestrial mammal species differ between oil palm plantations and riparian forest in the Colombian Llanos region. Further, we determined the relationships and influence of landscape and habitat level variables on those metrics. We found that species richness and composition differed significantly between riparian forest and oil palm, with site level richness inside oil palm plantations 47% lower, on average, than in riparian forest. Within plantations, mammalian species richness was strongly negatively correlated with cattle abundance, and positively correlated with the density of undergrowth vegetation. Forest structure characteristics appeared to have weak and similar effects on determining mammal species richness and composition along riparian forest strips. Composition at the landscape level was significantly influenced by cover type, percentage of remaining forest and the distance to the nearest town, whereas within oil palm sites, understory vegetation, cattle relative abundance, and canopy cover had significant effects on community composition. Species specific abundance responses varied between land cover types, with oil palm having positive effects on mesopredators, insectivores and grazers. Our findings suggest that increasing habitat complexity, avoiding cattle and retaining native riparian forest–regardless of its structure–inside oil palm-dominated landscapes would help support higher native mammal richness and abundance at both local and landscape scales."
https://openalex.org/W2804141217,"We investigated the relationship of neonatal and maternal serum creatinine (nSCr and mSCr, respectively) with various maternal/infant characteristics at different gestational ages (GA). We reviewed medical records of neonates admitted to NICU. We collected data on birth weight, GA, Apgar scores, medications, etc. Spearman’s test was used to analyze the correlation between serum creatinine and continuous variables, and the Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables between groups. The changes in nSCr, mSCr, and nSCr/mSCr ratio because of gestational age and the points in gestational changes in trends were estimated using joinpoint trend analysis. From 614 neonate and mother pairs, we found that nSCr was significantly correlated with GA. However, mSCr at >28 wks decreased with GA. The nSCr/mSCr ratio was correlated with GA. In infants born <29 weeks, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) (p = 0.000, β = 0.20) and mSCr (p = 0.000, β = 0.73) were significantly associated with nSCr. In term infants, maternal magnesium administration (p = 0.000, β = 0.25), respiratory distress syndrome (p = 0.013, β = 0.16), PIH (p = 0.005, β = 0.19), and mSCr (p = 0.000, β = 0.33) were significantly associated with nSCr. nSCr reflected mSCr at all gestational ages. The correlation between nSCr and mSCr in preterm infants (p = 0.000, β = 0.74) was stronger than in term infants (p = 0.000, β = 0.34)."
https://openalex.org/W2803583617,"In this paper we report on an automated procedure to capture and characterize the detailed structure of a crop canopy by means of stereo imaging. We focus attention specifically on the detailed characteristic of canopy height distribution-canopy shoot area as a function of height-which can provide an elaborate picture of canopy growth and health under a given set of conditions. We apply the method to a wheat field trial involving ten Australian wheat varieties that were subjected to two different fertilizer treatments. A novel camera self-calibration approach is proposed which allows the determination of quantitative plant canopy height data (as well as other valuable phenotypic information) by stereo matching. Utilizing the canopy height distribution to provide a measure of canopy height, the results compare favourably with manual measurements of canopy height (resulting in an R2 value of 0.92), and are indeed shown to be more consistent. By comparing canopy height distributions of different varieties and different treatments, the methodology shows that different varieties subjected to the same treatment, and the same variety subjected to different treatments can respond in much more distinctive and quantifiable ways within their respective canopies than can be captured by a simple trait measure such as overall canopy height."
https://openalex.org/W2803941746,"Actinidia arguta is the most basal species in a phylogenetically and economically important genus in the family Actinidiaceae. To better understand the molecular basis of the Actinidia arguta chloroplast (cp), we sequenced the complete cp genome from A. arguta using Illumina and PacBio RS II sequencing technologies. The cp genome from A. arguta was 157,611 bp in length and composed of a pair of 24,232 bp inverted repeats (IRs) separated by a 20,463 bp small single copy region (SSC) and an 88,684 bp large single copy region (LSC). Overall, the cp genome contained 113 unique genes. The cp genomes from A. arguta and three other Actinidia species from GenBank were subjected to a comparative analysis. Indel mutation events and high frequencies of base substitution were identified, and the accD and ycf2 genes showed a high degree of variation within Actinidia. Forty-seven simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 155 repetitive structures were identified, further demonstrating the rapid evolution in Actinidia. The cp genome analysis and the identification of variable loci provide vital information for understanding the evolution and function of the chloroplast and for characterizing Actinidia population genetics."
https://openalex.org/W2804128032,"Objectives Healthcare interventions, and particularly those in public health may affect multiple diseases and significantly prolong life. No consensus currently exists for how to estimate comparable healthcare costs across multiple diseases for use in health and public health cost-effectiveness models. We aim to describe a method for estimating comparable disease specific English healthcare costs as well as future healthcare costs from diseases unrelated to those modelled. Methods We use routine national datasets including programme budgeting data and cost curves from NHS England to estimate annual per person costs for diseases included in the PRIMEtime model as well as age and sex specific costs due to unrelated diseases. Results The 2013/14 annual cost to NHS England per prevalent case varied between £3,074 for pancreatic cancer and £314 for liver disease. Costs due to unrelated diseases increase with age except for a secondary peak at 30–34 years for women reflecting maternity resource use. Conclusions The methodology described allows health and public health economic modellers to estimate comparable English healthcare costs for multiple diseases. This facilitates the direct comparison of different health and public health interventions enabling better decision making."

During preschool years, children show not only rapid improvement in their EFs, but also appear sensitive to developmentally appropriate interventions.EMIL is a training program for German preschool teachers that was developed and implemented to improve the EFs of preschoolers. The aim of the present study was to evaluate its effects on the EFs of children between three and six years old.The teacher training (eight sessions, 28.5 hours) was implemented in four preschools. The EFs of children of the intervention group (n = 72, 32 girls, Mage = 48 months) and the control group of four other matched preschools (n = 61, 27 girls, Mage = 48 months) were tested before, during, and after the intervention using different measures assessing working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility.The intervention group showed significant gains on three out of seven EF tests (behavioral inhibition, visual-spatial working memory, and combined EFs) compared to the control group. Post hoc analyses for children with low initial EFs scores revealed that participation in the intervention led to significant gains in inhibitory control, visual-spatial working memory, and phonological working memory as well as a marginally significant difference for combined EFs. However, effect sizes were rather small.The results suggest that teacher training can lead to significant improvements in preschooler's EFs. Although preliminary, the results could contribute to the discussion on how teacher training can facilitate the improvement of EFs in preschool children."
https://openalex.org/W2804837547,"While bats are often viewed as carriers of infectious disease agents, little research has been conducted on the effects these potential pathogens may have on the bat populations themselves. The southern bent-winged bat (Miniopterus orianae bassanii) is a critically endangered subspecies endemic to south-eastern Australia. Population numbers of this bat have been declining for the past 50 years, but the reasons for this are unclear. As part of a larger study to determine if disease could be a contributing factor to this decline, 351 southern bent-winged bats from four locations were captured, and oral swabs were collected and tested for the presence of potentially pathogenic viruses. Results were compared with those obtained from 116 eastern bent-winged bats (Miniopterus orianae oceanensis) from three different locations. The eastern bent-winged bat is a related but more common and widespread subspecies whose geographical range overlaps partly with southern bent-winged bats. Herpesviruses were detected in bent-winged bats from all seven locations. At least six novel herpesviruses (five betaherpesviruses and one gammaherpesvirus) were identified. The prevalence of herpesvirus infection was higher in eastern bent-winged bats (44%, 51/116), compared to southern bent-winged bats (27%, 95/351), although this varied across the locations and sampling periods. Adenoviruses and a range of different RNA viruses (lyssaviruses, filoviruses, coronaviruses and henipaviruses) were also tested for but not detected. The detected herpesviruses did not appear to be associated with obvious ill health, and may thus not be playing a role in the population decline of the southern bent-winged bat. The detection of multiple novel herpesviruses at a high prevalence of infection is consistent with our understanding of bats as hosts to a rich diversity of viruses."

Keyword-based searchable encryption scheme enables users to quickly find interesting data stored in the cloud server without revealing any information of the searched keywords. In this work, we provide a keyword searchable attribute-based encryption scheme with attribute update for cloud storage, which is a combination of attribute-based encryption scheme and keyword searchable encryption scheme. The new scheme supports the user's attribute update, especially in our new scheme when a user's attribute need to be updated, only the user's secret key related with the attribute need to be updated, while other user's secret key and the ciphertexts related with this attribute need not to be updated with the help of the cloud server. In addition, we outsource the operation with high computation cost to cloud server to reduce the user's computational burden. Moreover, our scheme is proven to be semantic security against chosen ciphertext-policy and chosen plaintext attack in the general bilinear group model. And our scheme is also proven to be semantic security against chosen keyword attack under bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) assumption."
https://openalex.org/W2803799902,"The objective of this work was to perform a comparative analysis of the physiological, biochemical and agronomical parameters of recent and heritage durum wheat cultivars (Triticum durum Desf.) under water-deficit conditions. Five cultivars were grown under irrigated (control) and rainfall (stressed) conditions. Different agro-physiological and biochemical parameters were studied: electrolyte leakage, relative water content, chlorophyll fluorescence, proline, soluble sugars, specific peroxidase activity, yield and drought stress indices. It was revealed that a water deficit increased proline content, electrolyte leakage, soluble sugars and specific peroxidase activity and decreased relative water content, fluorescence and grain yield. According to these parameters and drought stress indices, our investigation indicated that old cultivars are the best-adapted to local conditions and showed characteristics of drought tolerance, while recent cultivars showed more drought susceptibility. Therefore, local cultivars of each country should be kept by farmers and plant breeders to preserve their genetic heritage."
https://openalex.org/W2804412910,"Clustering time series data is of great significance since it could extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics. Especially in biomedical engineering, outstanding clustering algorithms for time series may help improve the health level of people. Considering data scale and time shifts of time series, in this paper, we introduce two incremental fuzzy clustering algorithms based on a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. For recruiting Single-Pass and Online patterns, our algorithms could handle large-scale time series data by splitting it into a set of chunks which are processed sequentially. Besides, our algorithms select DTW to measure distance of pair-wise time series and encourage higher clustering accuracy because DTW could determine an optimal match between any two time series by stretching or compressing segments of temporal data. Our new algorithms are compared to some existing prominent incremental fuzzy clustering algorithms on 12 benchmark time series datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed approaches could yield high quality clusters and were better than all the competitors in terms of clustering accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2804694254,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents (CAs) are chemical compounds that can enhance image contrast on T1- or T2- weighted MR image. We have previously demonstrated the potential of MnCl2, a manganese-based CA, in cellular imaging of breast cancer using T1-weighted MRI. In this work, we examined the potential of another class of manganese-based CAs, manganese porphyrins (MnPs), for sensitive cellular detection of multiple clinical subtypes of breast cancer using quantitative MRI. Using a clinical 3.0-T MRI scanner, the relaxivities of two MnPs, MnTPPS4 and MnTPPS3NH2, and conventional Gd-DTPA (control) were measured in ultrapure water and their T1 contrast enhancement patterns were characterized in multiple clinical subtypes of breast cancer. The toxicity of the three CAs was evaluated in vitro. Compared to Gd-DTPA, both MnTPPS3NH2 and MnTPPS4 enabled a more sensitive multi-subtype detection of four breast cell lines at doses that posed no cytotoxic effects, with MnTPPS3NH2 producing the greatest positive enhancement. The superior T1 enhancement capabilities of MnPs over Gd-DTPA are statistically significant and are likely due to their greater cellular uptake and relaxivities. The results demonstrate that multiple clinical subtypes of breast cancer can be imaged on a 3.0-T MRI scanner using MnPs as T1 cellular CAs."
https://openalex.org/W2804559395,"Background To understand why some people live to advanced age in good health and others do not, it is important to study not only disease, but also long-term good health. The Super-Seniors Study aims to identify factors associated with healthy aging. Methods 480 healthy oldest-old ‘Super-Seniors’ aged 85 to 105 years and never diagnosed with cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, dementia, or major pulmonary disease, were compared to 545 mid-life controls aged 41–54, who represent a group that is unselected for survival from late-life diseases. Health and lifestyle information, personal and family medical history, and blood samples were collected from all participants. Super-Seniors also underwent four geriatric tests. Results Super-Seniors showed high cognitive (Mini-Mental State Exam mean = 28.3) and functional capacity (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale mean = 21.4), as well as high physical function (Timed Up and Go mean = 12.3 seconds) and low levels of depression (Geriatric Depression Scale mean = 1.5). Super-Seniors were less likely to be current smokers than controls, but the frequency of drinking alcohol was the same in both groups. Super-Seniors were more likely to have 4 or more offspring; controls were more likely to have no children. Female Super-Seniors had a mean age of last fertility 1.9 years older than controls, and were 2.3 times more likely to have had a child at ≥ 40 years. The parents of Super-Seniors had mean ages of deaths of 79.3 years for mothers, and 74.5 years for fathers, each exceeding the life expectancy for their era by a decade. Conclusions Super-Seniors are cognitively and physically high functioning individuals who have evaded major age-related chronic diseases into old age, representing the approximately top 1% for healthspan. The familiality of long lifespan of the parents of Super-Seniors supports the hypothesis that heritable factors contribute to this desirable phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2803708093,"The presence of intramuscular fat (IMF) in the cervical spine muscles of patients with whiplash associated disorders (WAD) has been consistently found. The mechanisms underlying IMF are not clear but preliminary evidence implicates a relationship with stress system responses. We hypothesised that if systemic stress system responses do play a role then IMF would be present in muscles remote to the cervical spine. We aimed to investigate if IMF are present in muscle tissue remote (soleus) to the cervical spine in people with chronic WAD. A secondary aim was to investigate associations between IMF and posttraumatic stress symptom levels. Forty-three people with chronic WAD (25 female) and 16 asymptomatic control participants (11 female) participated. Measures of pain, disability and posttraumatic stress symptoms were collected from the WAD participants. Both groups underwent MRI measures of IMF in cervical multifidus and the right soleus muscle. There was significantly greater IMF in cervical multifidus in patients with WAD and moderate/severe disability compared to controls (p = 0.009). There was no difference in multifidus IMF between the mild and moderate/severe disability WAD groups (p = 0.64), or the control and mild WAD groups (p = 0.21). IMF in the right soleus was not different between the groups (p = 0.47). In the WAD group, we found no correlation between PDS symptoms and cervical multifidus IMF or between PDS symptoms and soleus IMF. Global differences in IMF are not a feature of chronic WAD, with differences in IMF limited to the cervical spine musculature. While the mechanisms for the development of IMF in the cervical spine following whiplash injury remain unclear, our data indicate that local factors more likely contribute to these differences."
https://openalex.org/W2803253056,"Wheat stem rust was once the most destructive plant disease, but it has been largely controlled. However, to prevent future problems, the ongoing development of resistant wheat varieties requires knowledge of the changing virulence patterns for Pgt virulence of the fungus that causes wheat stem rust and the detection of new races. Surveys were conducted from 2013-2014 to determine the races of the Pgt present in China. Low levels of stem rust infections were found in China during this investigation and 11 Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) samples were obtained. In addition, 22 Pgt samples collected from the alternate host (Berberis) were obtained and have been reported for the first time. Fifty-three isolates were obtained from all samples. Four race groups, including 13 physiological races, were identified. They included the most prevalent races, 34C3MTGQM and 34C6MRGQM, with 13.2% predominance, followed by 34C0MRGQM at 11.3%. Six new races that were virulent against the resistance genes, Sr5 + Sr11, were found for the first time in China, namely 34C0MRGQM, 34C3MTGQM, 34C3MKGQM, 34C3MKGSM, 34C6MTGSM, and 34C6MRGQM, with a predominance of 11.3, 13.2, 9.4, 9.4, 1.9, and 13.2%, respectively. Most of the genes studied were ineffective against one or more of the tested isolates, except Sr9e, Sr21, Sr26, Sr31, Sr33, Sr38, Sr47, and SrTt3. Genes Sr35, SrTmp, Sr30, Sr37, Sr17, and Sr36 were effective in 92.5, 86.8, 84.9, 84.9, 79.3, and 77.4% of the tested isolates, respectively. In contrast, all of the isolates were virulent against Sr6, Sr7b, Sr9a, Sr9b, Sr9d, Sr9g, and SrMcN. Our results indicate that remarkable differences exist among the categories of the races in this study (i.e., their known virulence gene spectra) and the Pgt races reported previously. In addition, the sexual cycle of Pgt may contribute to its diversity in China."
https://openalex.org/W2803597006,"This study explores the extent to which a one-week nursing rotation for medical students changed the interprofessional attitudes of the participating nurses and students. Third-year medical students worked with nurses before starting clinical rotations. Pre- and post-experience surveys assessing perceptions of mutual respect, nurse-doctor roles, and interprofessional communication and teamwork were given to 55 nurses and 57 students. The surveys consisted of qualitative questions and a Likert scale questionnaire that was analyzed using qualitative and quantitative content analyses. The response rate was 51/57 (89%) students and 44/55 (80%) nurse preceptors. Nurses reported that students met nurses’ expectations by displaying responsibility, respect, effective communication, and an understanding of nursing roles. Medical students’ narratives demonstrated two significant changes. First, their views of nurses changed from that of physician helpers to that of collaborative patient-centred professionals. Second, they began defining nursing not by its tasks, but as a caring- and communication-centred profession. Responses to Likert-scaled questions showed significant differences corresponding to changes described in the narrative. A one-week immersive clinical nursing rotation for medical students was a transformative way of learning interprofessional competencies. Learning in an authentic workplace during a clinical rotation engendered mutual respect between nurses and future doctors. Students’ view of the role of nurses changed from nurses working for doctors with patients, to working with doctors for patients."
https://openalex.org/W2803869274,"We study scale dependence of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectrum in a class of small, single-field models of inflation which lead to a high value of the tensor to scalar ratio. The inflaton potentials that we consider are degree 5 polynomials, for which we precisely calculate the power spectrum, and extract the cosmological parameters: the scalar index ns, the running of the scalar index nrun and the tensor to scalar ratio r. We find that for non-vanishing nrun and for r as small as r = 0.001, the precisely calculated values of ns and nrun deviate significantly from what the standard analytic treatment predicts. We study in detail, and discuss the probable reasons for such deviations. As such, all previously considered models (of this kind) are based upon inaccurate assumptions. We scan the possible values of potential parameters for which the cosmological parameters are within the allowed range by observations. The 5 parameter class is able to reproduce all of the allowed values of ns and nrun for values of r that are as high as 0.001. Subsequently this study at once refutes previous such models built using the analytical Stewart-Lyth term, and revives the small field brand, by building models that do yield an appreciable r while conforming to known CMB observables."
https://openalex.org/W2804541857,"Microbially-mediated soil N mineralization and transformation are crucial to plant growth. However, changes in soil microbial groups and various N components are not clearly understood. To explore the relationship between soil N components and microbial communities, we conducted an in-situ experiment on two typically planted forest species, namely, Sibirica Apricot (SA) and Prunus davidiana Franch (PdF) by using closed-top polyvinyl chloride tubes. Changes in soil inorganic N, organic N (ON) fractions, and levels of microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) were measured bimonthly from April 2012 to April 2013. Microbial PLFAs and the concentrations of easily-available microbial biomass N (MBN; ~60 mg kg-1), soluble ON (SON; ~20 mg kg-1), and inorganic N were similar between the two soils whereas the ON (~900 mg kg-1) and its major part total acid-hydrolyzable N (HTN; ~500 mg kg-1), were significantly different (p < 0.05) in most months (5/6 and 4/6; respectively). The canonical correlation analysis of soil N fractions and microbial parameters indicated that the relationship between total PLFAs (total biomass of living cells) and NH4+-N was the most representative. The relative contributions (indicated by the absolute value of canonical coefficient) of NH4+-N were the largest, followed by NO3--N and MBN. For the HTN component, the relative percentage of hydrolyzable amino acid N and ammonium N decreased markedly in the first half of the year. Canonical variation mainly reflected the relationship between ammonium N and bacterial PLFAs, which were the most sensitive indicators related to soil N changes. The relative contributions of HTN components to the link between soil microbial groups and HTN components were ammonium N > amino acid N > amino sugar N. Observations from our study indicate the sensitivity of soil N mineralization indicators in relation to the temporal variation of soil microbial groups and N fractions."
https://openalex.org/W2803668152,"Coastal fisheries are in decline worldwide, and aquaculture has become an increasingly popular way to meet seafood demand. While finfish aquaculture can have substantial adverse effects on coastal ecosystems due mostly to necessary feed inputs, bivalves graze on natural phytoplankton and are often considered for their positive ecosystem services. We conducted two independent studies to investigate the effects of long-line Crassostrea gigas oyster aquaculture on Zostera marina seagrass beds and associated epibiont communities in Akkeshi-ko estuary, Japan. Results from both studies yielded no evidence of an effect of oyster aquaculture on the morphology, density, or biomass of Z. marina, but significant differences were apparent in the epibiont community. Reference seagrass beds located away from aquaculture had higher seagrass epiphyte loads and higher abundances of amphipods. Conversely, seagrass beds below aquaculture lines had higher sessile polychaete biomass and higher isopod abundances. Our results suggest that the presence of oyster aquaculture may have indirect effects on seagrass by changing epibiont community composition and relative abundances of species. One proposed mechanism is that cultured oysters feed on epiphytic diatoms and epiphyte propagules before they can settle on the seagrass, which reduces epiphyte loads and influences subsequent faunal settlement. If carefully implemented and monitored, long-line oyster aquaculture may be a sustainable option to consider as bivalve aquaculture expands to meet global seafood demand, but further work is needed to fully assess and generalize the community-level effects on seagrass epibionts."
https://openalex.org/W2803679776,"General colonization concepts consent that a slow process of microhabitat formation and subsequent niche realization occurs during early stages after new habitat is released. Subsequently, only few species are able to colonize new habitat in the early onset of succession, while species richness increases steadily over time. Although most colonization studies have been performed in terrestrial ecosystems, running water ecosystems are equally or even more prone to colonization after disturbance due to their dynamic nature. We question how invertebrate succession patterns reconcile with general colonization concepts. With this study we provide insight into the colonization process in newly created lowland stream trajectories and answer how within-stream bio- and functional diversity develops over time. Our results show a rapid influx of species, with a wide range of functional traits, during the first season after water flow commenced. During more than two years of regular monitoring, immigration rates were highest in autumn, marking the effects of seasonality on invertebrate dispersal. Biodiversity increased while abundance peaks of species alternated between seasons. Moreover, also days since start of the experiment explains a considerable part of the variability for taxa as well as traits. However, the relative trait composition remained similar throughout the entire monitoring period and only few specific traits had significantly higher proportions during specific seasons. This indicates that first phase colonization in freshwater streams can be a very rapid process that results in a high biodiversity and a large variety of species functional characteristics from the early onset of succession, contradicting general terrestrial colonization theory."
https://openalex.org/W2804172776,"China's fast economic growth contributes to the rapid development of its urbanization process, and also renders a series of industrial accidents, which often cause loss of life, damage to property and environment, thus requiring the associated risk analysis and safety control measures to be implemented in advance. However, incompleteness of historical failure data before the occurrence of accidents makes it difficult to use traditional risk analysis approaches such as probabilistic risk analysis in many cases. This paper aims to develop a new methodology capable of assessing regional industrial safety (RIS) in an uncertain environment. A hierarchical structure for modelling the risks influencing RIS is first constructed. The hybrid of evidential reasoning (ER) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is then used to assess the risks in a complementary way, in which AHP is hired to evaluate the weight of each risk factor and ER is employed to synthesise the safety evaluations of the investigated region(s) against the risk factors from the bottom to the top level in the hierarchy. The successful application of the hybrid approach in a real case analysis of RIS in several major districts of Beijing (capital of China) demonstrates its feasibility as well as provides risk analysts and safety engineers with useful insights on effective solutions to comprehensive risk assessment of RIS in metropolitan cities. The contribution of this paper is made by the findings on the comparison of risk levels of RIS at different regions against various risk factors so that best practices from the good performer(s) can be used to improve the safety of the others."
https://openalex.org/W2804710366,"In this paper, we develop an ecological, multi-level model that can be used to study the evolution of emerging technology. More specifically, by defining technology as a system composed of a set of interacting components, we can build upon the argument of multi-level density dependence from organizational ecology to develop a distribution-independent model of technological evolution. This allows us to distinguish between different stages of component development, which provides more insight into the emergence of stable component configurations, or dominant designs. We validate our hypotheses in the biotechnology industry by using patent data from the USPTO from 1976 to 2003."
https://openalex.org/W2805027939,"In the present work, we aimed to study the effects of free and polybutylcyanoacrylate nanoparticle-bound thymulin on immune cell activity in mice with chronic inflammation. NF-κB, MAPK, and PKC-θ signaling pathway activity was assessed, alongside Hsp72, Hsp90-α, and TLR4 expression and levels of apoptosis. In addition, plasma cytokines and blood and brain melatonin and serotonin levels were measured. In mice treated with gradually raised doses of lipopolysaccharide, significant increases in the activity of the signaling pathways tested, heat-shock protein and TLR4 expression, lymphocyte apoptosis, and plasma proinflammatory cytokine levels were noted. Moreover, we observed significantly heightened serotonin concentrations in the plasma and especially the brains of mice with inflammation. In contrast, melatonin levels were reduced in the tissues examined, particularly so in the brain. Treatment of these mice with thymulin alleviated fever, reduced apoptosis, increased splenic cell number, and decreased cytokine production, Hsp72, Hsp90, and TLR4 expression, and the activity of the signaling pathways examined. In addition, thymulin partially restored brain and blood serotonin and melatonin levels. Thus, thymulin suppressed the proinflammatory response in LPS-treated mice, indicating the potential of thymulin co-therapy in the treatment of sepsis. Nanoparticle-bound thymulin was more effective in several respects."
https://openalex.org/W2803261360,"Visceral leishmaniasis [VL] is a debilitating parasitic disease which invariably kills untreated patients. The disease is caused by Leishmania (L.) donovani or L. infantum, and transmitted by the bite of female phlebotomine sandflies. VL often remains subclinical but can become symptomatic with an acute/subacute or chronic course. Globally, the Eastern Africa region is one of the main VL endemic areas. The disease is prevalent in numerous foci within Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan South Sudan, and Uganda. In Ethiopia, the Lower Omo plain is one of the many VL endemic regions.The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic visceral leishmaniasisin Hamar and Banna-Tsamai districts of the South Omo plains where VL is becoming an emerging health problem of neglected communities.A community based cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2013 between 25th of July and 14th of August. A total of 1682 individuals living in 404 households were included in the study. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected from each of the participants and venous blood was also collected for the detection of antibodies to visceral leishmaniasis using Direct Agglutination Test. Leishmanin Skin Test was performed to detect the exposure to the parasite.The surveys included 14 villages located in areas where VL had been reported. In a study population of 1682 individuals, the overall positive leishmanian skin test and sero-prevalence rates respectively were 8.6% and 1.8%. A statistically significant variation in the rate of positive LST response was observed in different study sites and age groups. Positive LST response showed an increasing trend with age. The sero-prevalence rate also showed a statistically significant variation among different study sites. Higher rates of sero-prevalence were observed in children and adolescents. The LST and sero-prevalence rates in Hamar District exceeded significantly that of Banna-Tsamai District (10.7% versus 5.8% for LST; and 2.6% versus 0.7% for sero-prevalence).The prevalence of asymptomatic VL infection in Hamar and Banna-Tsamai districts during the study period in 2013 was low compared to rates previously reported in other endemic areas of Ethiopia. This could be due to the fact that the disease is emerging in Hamar and Banna-Tsamai districts. Based on records of a nearby Hospital, increasing numbers of active VL cases have been reported in these districts through the years 2006-2012, especially in Hamar District. Both districts are important destinations of tourism, and thus the importance of surveillance should be emphasized. Detailed epidemiological and entomological studies are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2803787134,"The present study addresses the effect of the eye position in the cockpit on the flight altitude during the final approach to landing. Three groups of participants with different levels of expertise (novices, trainees, and certified pilots) were given a laptop with a flight simulator and they were asked to maintain a 3.71° glide slope while landing. Each participant performed 40 approaches to the runway. During 8 of the approaches, the point of view that the flight simulator used to compute the visual scene was slowly raised or lowered with 4 cm with respect to the cockpit, hence moving the projection of the visible part of the cockpit down or up in the visible scene in a hardly noticeable manner. The increases and decreases in the simulated eye height led to increases and decreases in the altitude of the approach trajectories, for all three groups of participants. On the basis of these results, it is argued that the eye position of pilots during visual approaches is a factor that contributes to the risk of black hole accidents."
https://openalex.org/W2803823895,"HIV infection has been associated with increased diabetes risk, but prior work has mostly focused on insulin resistance, as opposed to beta cell effects, or included patients on antiretroviral therapies (ART) directly linked to metabolic toxicity. In this analysis, we measured markers of glucose homeostasis and beta cell function, stress, and death in fasting sera from a cross section of HIV+ individuals off ART (n = 43), HIV+ individuals on ART (n = 23), and HIV- controls (n = 39). Markers included glucose, HOMA%S, HOMA%B, proinsulin:C-peptide ratio (PI:C ratio), and circulating preproinsulin (INS) DNA. We performed multiple linear regressions with adjustments for age, sex, race, BMI, and smoking status. Compared to HIV- controls, HIV+ participants off ART exhibited similar beta cell function and insulin sensitivity, without increases in markers of beta cell stress or death. Specifically, in HIV+ participants with CD4 counts <350 cells/μL, PI:C ratios were lower than in HIV- controls (p<0.01), suggesting a reduction in intrinsic beta cell stress among this group. By contrast, HIV+ participants on ART had higher fasting glucose (p<0.0001) and lower HOMA%B (p<0.001) compared to HIV- controls. Among the entire HIV+ population, higher HIV RNA correlated with lower fasting glucose (r = -0.57, p<0.001), higher HOMA%B (r = 0.40, p = 0.001), and lower PI:C ratios (r = -0.42, p<0.001), whereas higher CD4 counts correlated with higher PI:C ratios (r = 0.2, p = 0.00499). Our results suggest that HIV seropositivity in the absence of ART does not worsen beta cell function or glucose homeostasis, but immune reconstitution with ART may be associated with worsened beta cell function."
https://openalex.org/W2804732620,"Malignant melanoma is potentially life-threatening but in most cases curable if detected early. Willingness to pay (WTP) is a preference-based construct that reflects burden of disease by assessment of the monetary value for a hypothetical cure from disease. Since WTP (directly as total amount of money) has not been assessed so far in patients with low risk melanoma, it was interesting to gain insights in this patient population and then, in a second step, compare it directly with the WTP of their treating dermato-oncologists. WTP was assessed in 125 patients with low-risk melanoma and additionally in 105 treating physicians, asking for the one-time and continuous payments they would be willing to make for a sustainable cure, both as absolute sums and as percentages of monthly income. The median WTP based on one-time payment was €10,000 for patients and €100,000 for physicians; relative numbers were 100% versus 300% of monthly income. For continuous monthly payments, WTP was €500 for patients and €1000 for physicians, relative numbers 25% and 50% of income, respectively. Even after controlling for income differences, there was a significantly higher WTP in physicians for all four questions. Compared to patients with chronic skin diseases such as vitiligo, rosacea, atopic eczema and psoriasis, patients with low-risk melanoma showed a significantly higher WTP. Our data suggest that there is a relevant burden of disease even in patients with low-risk tumors. Higher WTP of physicians underlines the prevalence of differences in disease perception."
https://openalex.org/W2803110439,"Traditionally, microsecond pulsed electric field was widely used in cell electrofusion technology. However, it was difficult to fuse the cells with different sizes. Because the effect of electroporation based on microsecond pulses was greatly influenced by cell sizes. It had been reported that the differences between cell sizes can be ignored when cells were exposed to nanosecond pulses. However, pores induced by those short nanosecond pulses tended to be very small (0.9 nm) and the pores were more easy to recover. In this work, a finite element method was used to simulate the distribution, radius and density of the pores. The innovative idea of ""cell electrofusion based on nanosecond/microsecond pulses"" was proposed in order to combine the advantages of nanosecond pulses and microsecond pulses. The model consisted of two contact cells with different sizes. Three kinds of pulsed electric fields were made up of two 100-ns, 10-kV/cm pulses; two 10-μs, 1-kV/cm pulses; and a sequence of a 100-ns, 10-kV/cm pulse, followed by a 10-μs, 1-kV/cm pulse. Some obvious advantageous can be found when nanosecond/microsecond pulses were considered. The pore radius was large enough (70nm) and density was high (5×1013m-2) in the cell junction area. Moreover, pores in the non-contact area of the cell membrane were small (1-10 nm) and sparse (109-1012m-2). Areas where the transmembrane voltage was higher than 1V were only concentrated in the cell junction. The transmembrane voltage of other areas were at most 0.6V when we tested the rest of the cell membrane. Cell fusion efficiency can be improved remarkably because electroporation was concentrated in the cell contact area."

However, comparative studies between left-hemisphere lesions (LHL) and RHL are rare, especially regarding reading comprehension. Moreover, further knowledge of the influence of cognition on inferential processing in this task is needed.To compare the performance of patients with RHL and LHL on an inference reading comprehension task. We also aimed to analyze the effects of lesion site and to verify correlations between cognitive functions and performance on the task.Seventy-five subjects were equally divided into the groups RHL, LHL, and control group (CG). The Implicit Management Test was used to evaluate inference comprehension. In this test, subjects read short written passages and subsequently answer five types of questions (explicit, logical, distractor, pragmatic, and other), which require different types of inferential reasoning. The cognitive functional domains of attention, memory, executive functions, language, and visuospatial abilities were assessed using the Cognitive Linguistic Quick Test (CLQT).The LHL and RHL groups presented difficulties in inferential comprehension in comparison with the CG. However, the RHL group presented lower scores than the LHL group on logical, pragmatic and other questions. A covariance analysis did not show any effect of lesion site within the hemispheres. Overall, all cognitive domains were correlated with all the types of questions from the inference test (especially logical, pragmatic, and other). Attention and visuospatial abilities affected the scores of both the RHL and LHL groups, and only memory influenced the performance of the RHL group.Lesions in either hemisphere may cause difficulties in making inferences during reading. However, processing more complex inferences was more difficult for patients with RHL than for those with LHL, which suggests that the right hemisphere plays an important role in tasks with higher comprehension demands. Cognition influences inferential processing during reading in brain-injured subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2803406753,"Metabolic disorders including obesity and type 2 diabetes are known to be associated with chronic inflammation and are obvious risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. Recent evidences concerning obesity and diabetes suggest that the metabolic inflammasome (""metaflammasome"") mediates chronic inflammation. The double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is a central component of the metaflammasome. In wild type (WT) and PKR-/- mice, blood glucose, insulin and lipid levels and the brain expression of the phosphorylated components of the metaflammasome-PKR, JNK, IRS1 and IKKbeta-were studied after the induction of obesity by a high fat diet (HFD). The results showed significant increased levels of activated brain metaflammasome proteins in exposed WT mice but the changes were not significant in PKR-/- mice. In addition, gain weight was observed in WT mice and also in PKR-/- mice exposed to HFD. Increased blood insulin level was more accentuated in PKR -/- mice. The modulation of PKR activity could be an appropriate therapeutic approach, aimed at reducing abnormal brain metabolism and inflammation linked to metabolic disorders in order to reduce the risk of neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2804737777,"This work focuses on the experimental data analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) data, in which multiple sensors are recording oscillatory voltage time series. The EEG data analyzed in this manuscript has been acquired using a low-cost commercial headset, the Emotiv EPOC+. Our goal is to compare different techniques for the optimal estimation of collective rhythms from EEG data. To this end, a traditional method such as the principal component analysis (PCA) is compared to more recent approaches to extract a collective rhythm from phase-synchronized data. Here, we extend the work by Schwabedal and Kantz (PRL 116, 104101 (2016)) evaluating the performance of the Kosambi-Hilbert torsion (KHT) method to extract a collective rhythm from multivariate oscillatory time series and compare it to results obtained from PCA. The KHT method takes advantage of the singular value decomposition algorithm and accounts for possible phase lags among different time series and allows to focus the analysis on a specific spectral band, optimally amplifying the signal-to-noise ratio of a common rhythm. We evaluate the performance of these methods for two particular sets of data: EEG data recorded with closed eyes and EEG data recorded while observing a screen flickering at 15 Hz. We found an improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio of the collective signal for the KHT over the PCA, particularly when random temporal shifts are added to the channels."
https://openalex.org/W2803142539,"Recent studies suggest that aberrant DNA methylation might occur early and commonly in colorectal tumorigenesis. In 111 normal subjects, the mean LINE-1 methylation level of peripheral blood was 81.0 ± 5.7%. Of 143 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, the mean level of LINE-1 methylation was 60.5 ± 12.5%. We defined below 60% as cut-off value of LINE-1 hypomethylation, and 93 cases (65.0%) had LINE-1 hypomethylation in the tumor tissue. LINE-1 hypomethylation was not associated with any other clinical features. There was a trend that LINE-1 hypomethylation tumors were associated with advanced disease, but it did not reach statistical significance. There was no significant association between mutations of 12 genes, MSI-high, EMAST, and LINE-1 hypomethylation level. The median follow-up was 61.2 months. Five-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival curves of patients with LINE-1 hypomethylation tumors were significantly lower than those of patients with normal LINE-1 methylation tumors (p = 0.032 and 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that only TNM staging was an independent prognostic factor for CRC patients including DFS and overall survival (OS). LINE-1 did not impact patients' outcomes in multivariate analysis including DFS and OS. In conclusion, LINE-1 hypomethylation is marginally related to advanced stage CRC and impacts patients' outcomes in univariate analysis."

Ximenia americana L. is a plant occurring in several regions of the world, with well-known and applied medicinal properties. Thus, the aim of this work was to develop and evaluate the physical and physical-chemical quality of tablets produced with X. americana L. extract. The extract was spray-dried from a hydroethanolic extractive solution and characterized as to its phytochemical composition. The chemical marker was determined and quantified using validated chromatographic methods. These methods indicated the presence of gallic acid at a concentration of 1.61 mg g(-1). Formulations were proposed and analyzed for their flow and compaction properties. The best formulation was used to obtain a batch of tablets, which was evaluated for its quality characteristics and showed to be within the pharmacopoeial specifications for average weight, hardness, friability, and disintegration time. The dissolution profile of the tablets produced was obtained, showing the release of about 70% of the vegetable extract content within 30 minutes. Results showed that it was possible to obtain herbal tablets containing a high content of vegetal extract by direct compression, developing a rapid process of formulation and production and guaranteeing the quality characteristics of the final product."
https://openalex.org/W2803325860,"Background Methionine loading test (MLT) has been used primarily to identify defects in transsulfuration of homocysteine in cystathionine beta synthase deficiency. It may not be as useful to evaluate remethylation pathway, in vitamin B-12 and folate deficiencies. Objective We used tracer isotope labelled MLT to interrogate transsulfuration and remethylation independently in vitamin B-12 deficiency. Design We studied vitamin B-12 deficient women with a tracer labelled MLT before and eleven months after treatment with vitamin B-12. The fractional contribution of [13C]homocysteine to breath CO2 was used as a measure of transsulfuration, and difference in the intracellular enrichment of [13C]methionine and that of [C2H3]methionine as a measure of remethylation of homocysteine. Combined pre- and post-treatment results were analyzed to investigate the association between plasma vitamin B-12 concentrations and measures of homocysteine metabolism. Results The subjects were 17 years old, with a BMI of 19.4 kg/m2. Treatment with vitamin B-12, 2µg/day increased plasma B-12 from 93 (78.7, 106.2) [median (25th, 75th centiles)] to 161.5 (125.5, 226.2) pmol/L; 44% were below <150pmol/L after treatment. Fasting homocysteine concentration was significantly lower and that of cysteine higher in subjects with B-12 levels >150pmol/L. The tracer estimated transsulfuration of homocysteine was lower and remethylation higher with B-12 levels >150pmol/L when compared with those <150pmol/L. Conclusions The tracer labelled MLT in combination with fasting parameters is a robust way to estimate parameters of methionine metabolism and can be used in the field where prime-constant rate infusion studies cannot be done efficiently."
https://openalex.org/W2804540271,"Purpose To examine the effect of cannula diameter and conjunctival flap method on bleb survival in rabbits undergoing cannula-based glaucoma filtration surgery (GFS). Methods Twelve New Zealand White rabbits underwent GFS in both eyes. The twenty-four eyes were divided into four groups. Two of the four groups (N = 12) received limbus-based conjunctival flaps (LBCF), and the other two (N = 12) received fornix-based conjunctival flaps (FBCF). Six FBCF rabbit eyes were implanted with 22-gauge drainage tubes, and the other six were implanted with 26-gauge tubes. Likewise, six LBCF rabbits received 22-gauge drainage tubes and six received 26-gauge tubes. Filtration blebs were evaluated every three days by a masked observer. Bleb failure was defined as the primary endpoint in this study and was recorded after two consecutive flat bleb evaluations. Results Group 1 (LBCF, 22- gauge cannula) had a mean bleb survival time (Mean ± SD) of 18.7 ± 2.9 days. Group 2 (LBCF, 26-gauge cannula) also had a mean bleb survival time of 18.7 ± 2.9 days. Group 3 (FBCF, 22-gauge cannula) had a mean bleb survival time of 19.2 ± 3.8 days. Group 4 (FBCF, 26-gauge cannula) had a mean bleb survival time of 19.7 ± 4.1 days. A 2-way analysis of variance showed that neither surgical approach nor cannula gauge made a statistically significant difference in bleb survival time (P = 0.634 and P = 0.874). Additionally, there was no significant interaction between cannula gauge and conjunctival flap approach (P = 0.874), suggesting that there was not a combination of drainage gauge and conjunctival flap method that produced superior bleb survival. Conclusion Limbus and fornix-based conjunctival flaps are equally effective in promoting bleb survival using both 22 and 26-gauge cannulas in the rabbit model. The 26-gauge drainage tube may be preferred because its smaller size facilitates the implantation process, reducing the risk of corneal contact."

Participants watching the resource-oriented film on living with dementia had significantly higher post-film acceptance rates compared to those watching the deficit-oriented negatively framed film. This effect particularly emerges if brief and efficient life-saving interventions with a high likelihood of physical recovery are available (eg, antibiotic treatment for pneumonia).Anticipated decisions regarding life-sustaining measures are negatively influenced by the subjective imagination of living with dementia, which might be shaped by common, unquestioned stereotypes. This bias can be reduced by providing audio-visual information on living with dementia which is not only centred around cognitive and functional losses but also focuses on remaining resources and the apparent quality of life. This is particularly true if the medical threat can be treated efficiently. These findings have implications for the practice of formulating, revising, and supporting advance directives."
https://openalex.org/W2803972304,"There is an urgent need for an improved empirical understanding of the relationship among biodiverse marine resources, human health and development outcomes. Coral reefs are often at this intersection for developing nations in the tropics-an ecosystem targeted for biodiversity conservation and one that provides sustenance and livelihoods for many coastal communities. To explore these relationships, we use the comparative development contexts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic on the island of Hispaniola. We combine child nutrition data from the Demographic Health Survey with coastal proximity and coral reef habitat diversity, and condition to empirically test human benefits of marine natural resources in differing development contexts. Our results indicate that coastal children have a reduced likelihood of severe stunting in Haiti but have increased likelihoods of stunting and reduced dietary diversity in the Dominican Republic. These contrasting results are likely due to the differential in developed infrastructure and market access. Our analyses did not demonstrate an association between more diverse and less degraded coral reefs and better childhood nutrition. The results highlight the complexities of modelling interactions between the health of humans and natural systems, and indicate the next steps needed to support integrated development programming."

We retrospectively examined the treatment outcomes of patients with prostate-specific antigen recurrence who underwent radical prostatectomy at our department.Of the 690 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for local prostate cancer between 1988 and 2011, 129 patients who received androgen deprivation therapy for prostate-specific antigen recurrence were included in this study. Patient characteristics, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist administration, and outcomes were compared between the intermittent androgen deprivation group (n = 66) and the continuous androgen deprivation therapy group (n = 63). The non-recurrence and overall survival rates were compared between groups.Thirty-six patients (27.9%) experienced recurrence after luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist administration. The 5-year non-recurrence rate and 10-year overall survival rate were higher in the intermittent group (92.9%) than in the continuous group (92.9 vs 57.9%, P < 0.001; and 95.9% vs 84.3%, P = 0.047, respectively). Furthermore, 63 patients (48.8%) showed a PSA nadir of less than 0.01 ng/mL after initiation of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist; among these patients, the non-recurrence rate was significantly higher in the intermittent androgen deprivation group (P = 0.003).Intermittent androgen deprivation therapy for prostate specific antigen recurrence after radical prostatectomy contributed to improvement of the non-recurrence rate and overall survival, and can be considered an effective therapy for better prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2804204158,"Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the internal consistency, reliability, convergent validity, known-group comparisons, and structural validity of the Chinese version of Fear of Intimacy with Helping Professionals (C–FIS–HP) scale in Macau. Methods A cross-sectional design was used on a sample of 593 older people in 6 health centers. We used Chinese version of Exercise of Self-Care Agency Scale (C-ESCAS) and Morisky 4-item medication adherence scale to evaluate self-care actions and medication adherence. The internal consistency and reliability of C–FIS–HP were analyzed using the Spearman-Brown split-half reliability, Cronbach’s alpha, and test–retest reliability. Convergent validity was tested the construct of C–FIS–HP and self-care actions. Known-group comparisons differentiated predefined groups in an expected direction. Two separated samples were used to test the structural validity. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) tested the factor structure of C–FISHP using the principal axis factoring. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was further conducted to confirm the factor structure constructed in the prior EFA. Results The C–FIS–HP had a Spearman-Brown split-half coefficient, Cronbach’s alpha, and intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.96, 0.93, and 0.96, respectively. Convergent validity was satisfactory with significantly correlations between the C-FIS-HP and C-ESCAS. C–FIS–HP to differentiate the differences between high-, moderate-, and low- medication adherence groups. EFA demonstrated a two-factor structure among 297 older people. A first-order CFA was performed to confirm the construct dimensionality of C–FIS–HP with satisfactory fit indices (NFI = 0.92; IFI = 0.95; TLI = 0.94; CFI = 0.95 and RMSEA = 0.07) among 296 older people. Conclusions C–FIS–HP is a reliable and valid test for assessing helping relationships in older Chinese people. Health professionals can use C–FIS–HP as a clinical tool to assess the comfort level of patients in a helping relationship, and use this information to develop culturally sensitive therapeutic interventions and treatment plans. Further studies need to be conducted concerning the different psychometric properties, as well as the application of C–FIS–HP in various regions."
https://openalex.org/W2804248776,"Initial studies using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging on the trajectories of the brain network from childhood to adulthood found evidence of functional integration and segregation over time. The comprehension of how healthy individuals' functional integration and segregation occur is crucial to enhance our understanding of possible deviations that may lead to brain disorders. Recent approaches have focused on the framework wherein the functional brain network is organized into spatially distributed modules that have been associated with specific cognitive functions. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the clustering structure of brain networks evolves during development. To address this hypothesis, we defined a measure of how well a brain region is clustered (network fitness index), and developed a method to evaluate its association with age. Then, we applied this method to a functional magnetic resonance imaging data set composed of 397 males under 31 years of age collected as part of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange Consortium. As results, we identified two brain regions for which the clustering change over time, namely, the left middle temporal gyrus and the left putamen. Since the network fitness index is associated with both integration and segregation, our finding suggests that the identified brain region plays a role in the development of brain systems."
https://openalex.org/W2804965235,"Group C serogroup includes members of the Orthobunyavirus genus (family Peribunyaviridae) and comprises 15 arboviruses that can be associated with febrile illness in humans. Although previous studies described the genome characterization of Group C orthobunyavirus, there is a gap in genomic information about the other viruses in this group. Therefore, in this study, complete genomes of members of Group C serogroup were sequenced or re-sequenced and used for genetic characterization, as well as to understand their phylogenetic and evolutionary aspects. Thus, our study reported the genomes of three new members in Group C virus (Apeu strain BeAn848, Itaqui strain BeAn12797 and Nepuyo strain BeAn10709), as well as re-sequencing of original strains of five members: Caraparu (strain BeAn3994), Madrid (strain BT4075), Murucutu (strain BeAn974), Oriboca (strain BeAn17), and Marituba (strain BeAn15). These viruses presented a typical genomic organization related to members of the Orthobunyavirus genus. Interestingly, all viruses of this serogroup showed an open reading frame (ORF) that encodes the putative nonstructural NSs protein that precedes the nucleoprotein ORF, an unprecedented fact in Group C virus. Also, we confirmed the presence of natural reassortment events. This study expands the genomic information of Group C viruses, as well as revalidates the genomic organization of viruses that were previously reported."
https://openalex.org/W2805016739,"The anti-saccade task has been used to measure attentional control related to general anxiety but less so with social anxiety specifically. Previous research has not been conclusive in suggesting that social anxiety may lead to difficulties in inhibiting faces. It is possible that static face paradigms do not convey a sufficient social threat to elicit an inhibitory response in socially anxious individuals. The aim of the current study was twofold. We investigated the effect of social anxiety on performance in an anti-saccade task with neutral or emotional faces preceded either by a social stressor (Experiment 1), or valenced sentence primes designed to increase the social salience of the task (Experiment 2). Our results indicated that latencies were significantly longer for happy than angry faces. Additionally, and surprisingly, high anxious participants made more erroneous anti-saccades to neutral than angry and happy faces, whilst the low anxious groups exhibited a trend in the opposite direction. Results are consistent with a general approach-avoidance response for positive and threatening social information. However increased socio-cognitive load may alter attentional control with high anxious individuals avoiding emotional faces, but finding it more difficult to inhibit ambiguous faces. The effects of social sentence primes on attention appear to be subtle but suggest that the anti-saccade task will only elicit socially relevant responses where the paradigm is more ecologically valid."
https://openalex.org/W2803518333,"Epidemiological transitions are occurring throughout Africa. To inform public health programs and policies, longitudinal cohorts investigating non-communicable diseases are needed. However, loss-to-follow up is a major problem. In preparation for a longitudinal study, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to test communication-based retention strategies (message content and delivery methods) among a pilot cohort of South African healthcare workers (n = 1536; median age = 36; women = 1270). Two messaging formats across three delivery modes were tested. Response rates were analyzed by intervention, survey return date and method using chi-square tests and univariate logistic regression. Sixty-seven of 238 (17.4%) control group participants and 238 of 1152 (24.6%) intervention group participants were retained (OR 1.54: CI 1.15-2.07; P = 0.004). Odds of being retained were 1.68 times greater for participants who received regular contact and themed messages compared to control (CI 1.22-2.32; P = 0.001). Neither health status nor clinical condition affected response rates (P>0.05). Time-to-first contact did not impact response rates (P>0.05). Message content and delivery method influenced response rates compared to the control, however no difference was found between intervention groups. Although greater retention is required for valid cohort studies, these findings are the first to quantitatively assess retention factors in Africa."
