https://openalex.org/W2472420705,"Crossing “safe” limits for biodiversity loss The planetary boundaries framework attempts to set limits for biodiversity loss within which ecological function is relatively unaffected. Newbold et al. present a quantitative global analysis of the extent to which the proposed planetary boundary has been crossed (see the Perspective by Oliver). Using over 2 million records for nearly 40,000 terrestrial species, they modeled the response of biodiversity to land use and related pressures and then estimated, at a spatial resolution of ∼1 km 2 , the extent and spatial patterns of changes in local biodiversity. Across 65% of the terrestrial surface, land use and related pressures have caused biotic intactness to decline beyond 10%, the proposed “safe” planetary boundary. Changes have been most pronounced in grassland biomes and biodiversity hotspots. Science , this issue p. 288 ; see also p. 220"

Here, we report the discovery of the stable in-plane spontaneous polarization in atomic-thick tin telluride (SnTe), down to a 1-unit cell (UC) limit. The ferroelectric transition temperature T(c) of 1-UC SnTe film is greatly enhanced from the bulk value of 98 kelvin and reaches as high as 270 kelvin. Moreover, 2- to 4-UC SnTe films show robust ferroelectricity at room temperature. The interplay between semiconducting properties and ferroelectricity in this two-dimensional material may enable a wide range of applications in nonvolatile high-density memories, nanosensors, and electronics."

Stettler et al. analyzed 119 monoclonal antibodies isolated from four donors that were infected with Zika virus during the present epidemic, including two individuals that had previously been infected with dengue virus, another member of the flavivirus family. Neutralizing antibodies primarily recognized the envelope protein domain III (EDIII) or quaternary epitopes on the intact virus, and an EDIII-targeted antibody protected mice against lethal infection. Some EDI/II-targeting antibodies cross-reacted with dengue virus in vitro and could enhance disease in dengue-infected mice. Whether dengue and Zika virus antibodies cross-react in humans remains to be tested. Science , this issue p. 823"
https://openalex.org/W2462490406,"The epigenome orchestrates genome accessibility, functionality, and three-dimensional structure. Because epigenetic variation can impact transcription and thus phenotypes, it may contribute to adaptation. Here, we report 1,107 high-quality single-base resolution methylomes and 1,203 transcriptomes from the 1001 Genomes collection of Arabidopsis thaliana. Although the genetic basis of methylation variation is highly complex, geographic origin is a major predictor of genome-wide DNA methylation levels and of altered gene expression caused by epialleles. Comparison to cistrome and epicistrome datasets identifies associations between transcription factor binding sites, methylation, nucleotide variation, and co-expression modules. Physical maps for nine of the most diverse genomes reveal how transposons and other structural variants shape the epigenome, with dramatic effects on immunity genes. The 1001 Epigenomes Project provides a comprehensive resource for understanding how variation in DNA methylation contributes to molecular and non-molecular phenotypes in natural populations of the most studied model plant."

Lewis et al. now show that homeostatic mtDNA synthesis in mitochondrial nucleoids in mammalian cells is spatially linked to a small subset of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria contact sites that are specifically destined for mitochondrial division. Successive events of mtDNA replication, mitochondrial division, and mitochondrial motility function together to ensure the accurate distribution of mtDNA in cells. Furthermore, ER-mitochondria contacts coordinate the licensing of mtDNA replication with division to distribute newly replicated nucleoids to daughter mitochondria. Science , this issue p. 261"
https://openalex.org/W2466725324,"Immature HIV-1 assembles at and buds from the plasma membrane before proteolytic cleavage of the viral Gag polyprotein induces structural maturation. Maturation can be blocked by maturation inhibitors (MIs), thereby abolishing infectivity. The CA (capsid) and SP1 (spacer peptide 1) region of Gag is the key regulator of assembly and maturation and is the target of MIs. We applied optimized cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging to resolve this region within assembled immature HIV-1 particles at 3.9 angstrom resolution and built an atomic model. The structure reveals a network of intra- and intermolecular interactions mediating immature HIV-1 assembly. The proteolytic cleavage site between CA and SP1 is inaccessible to protease. We suggest that MIs prevent CA-SP1 cleavage by stabilizing the structure, and MI resistance develops by destabilizing CA-SP1."
https://openalex.org/W2461230718,"Stem-cell differentiation to desired lineages requires navigating alternating developmental paths that often lead to unwanted cell types. Hence, comprehensive developmental roadmaps are crucial to channel stem-cell differentiation toward desired fates. To this end, here, we map bifurcating lineage choices leading from pluripotency to 12 human mesodermal lineages, including bone, muscle, and heart. We defined the extrinsic signals controlling each binary lineage decision, enabling us to logically block differentiation toward unwanted fates and rapidly steer pluripotent stem cells toward 80%-99% pure human mesodermal lineages at most branchpoints. This strategy enabled the generation of human bone and heart progenitors that could engraft in respective in vivo models. Mapping stepwise chromatin and single-cell gene expression changes in mesoderm development uncovered somite segmentation, a previously unobservable human embryonic event transiently marked by HOPX expression. Collectively, this roadmap enables navigation of mesodermal development to produce transplantable human tissue progenitors and uncover developmental processes. VIDEO ABSTRACT."

Cook et al. studied glaciers that drain the Antarctic Peninsula and found a strong correlation between mid-depth ocean temperatures and glacier-front changes along the peninsula's western coastline. Glaciers in the south, which are exposed to warmer waters, have undergone significant retreat, while those in the northwest, which terminate in cooler waters, have not retreated as much or as uniformly. Thus, ocean-induced melting appears to be the main cause of glacial retreat in the region. Science , this issue p. 283"
https://openalex.org/W2469926161,"VAP (VAPA and VAPB) is an evolutionarily conserved endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchored protein that helps generate tethers between the ER and other membranes through which lipids are exchanged across adjacent bilayers. Here, we report that by regulating PI4P levels on endosomes, VAP affects WASH-dependent actin nucleation on these organelles and the function of the retromer, a protein coat responsible for endosome-to-Golgi traffic. VAP is recruited to retromer budding sites on endosomes via an interaction with the retromer SNX2 subunit. Cells lacking VAP accumulate high levels of PI4P, actin comets, and trans-Golgi proteins on endosomes. Such defects are mimicked by downregulation of OSBP, a VAP interactor and PI4P transporter that participates in VAP-dependent ER-endosomes tethers. These results reveal a role of PI4P in retromer-/WASH-dependent budding from endosomes. Collectively, our data show how the ER can control budding dynamics and association with the cytoskeleton of another membrane by direct contacts leading to bilayer lipid modifications."

https://openalex.org/W2466905028,"Driven to collapse Volcanic eruptions occur frequently, but only rarely are they large enough to cause the top of the mountain to collapse and form a caldera. Gudmundsson et al. used a variety of geophysical tools to monitor the caldera formation that accompanied the 2014 Bárdarbunga volcanic eruption in Iceland. The volcanic edifice became unstable as magma from beneath Bárdarbunga spilled out into the nearby Holuhraun lava field. The timing of the gradual collapse revealed that it is the eruption that drives caldera formation and not the other way around. Science , this issue p. 262"
https://openalex.org/W2472109776,"Making the forbidden allowed Spontaneous emission, in which an excited electron lowers its energy by emitting a photon, is a fundamental process in light-matter interactions. In principle, the electron can relax from the excited state to any unoccupied lower energy level. In practice, however, most of these transitions are too slow and so are effectively forbidden. Rivera et al. show theoretically that the plasmonic excitations associated with two-dimensional materials can be used to enhance and control the light-matter interaction. Transitions that were once considered forbidden can thus be accessed, opening up the entire spectrum of an optical emitter. Science , this issue p. 263"
https://openalex.org/W2466317387,"Quiescence is essential for long-term maintenance of adult stem cells. Niche signals regulate the transit of stem cells from dormant to activated states. Here, we show that the E3-ubiquitin ligase Huwe1 (HECT, UBA, and WWE domain-containing 1) is required for proliferating stem cells of the adult mouse hippocampus to return to quiescence. Huwe1 destabilizes proactivation protein Ascl1 (achaete-scute family bHLH transcription factor 1) in proliferating hippocampal stem cells, which prevents accumulation of cyclin Ds and promotes the return to a resting state. When stem cells fail to return to quiescence, the proliferative stem cell pool becomes depleted. Thus, long-term maintenance of hippocampal neurogenesis depends on the return of stem cells to a transient quiescent state through the rapid degradation of a key proactivation factor."

Nascent rRNA that is co-transcriptionally folded and given a particular shape by encapsulation within a dedicated mold-like structure is reminiscent of how polypeptides use chaperone chambers for their protein folding. The biogenesis of the 60S and 40S ribosomal subunits in eukaryotic cells follows a complicated pathway, which requires the assembly of four rRNAs and ∼80 ribosomal proteins (RPs). Ribosome assembly starts in the nucleolus with transcription of a large precursor rRNA (called 35S pre-rRNA in yeast) by RNA polymerase I, from which the mature 18S, 5.8S, and 25S rRNAs are generated (Woolford and Baserga, 2013Woolford Jr., J.L. Baserga S.J. Ribosome biogenesis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2013; 195: 643-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The 5S pre-rRNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase III and incorporated into the nascent pre-ribosome in a subsequent step (Zhang et al., 2007Zhang J. Harnpicharnchai P. Jakovljevic J. Tang L. Guo Y. Oeffinger M. Rout M.P. Hiley S.L. Hughes T. Woolford Jr., J.L. Assembly factors Rpf2 and Rrs1 recruit 5S rRNA and ribosomal proteins rpL5 and rpL11 into nascent ribosomes.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2580-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The 35S pre-rRNA assembles co-transcriptionally with numerous trans-acting factors and early binding ribosomal proteins of the small subunit, forming a huge macromolecular complex, termed either the 90S pre-ribosome or small-subunit (SSU) processome (Dragon et al., 2002Dragon F.

Cell. 2002; 10: 105-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In this first 90S assembly intermediate, the pre-rRNA undergoes extensive site-specific base modifications at conserved sites and cleavage reactions at positions A0, A1, and A2, which are well studied in yeast. These early cleavages result in the separation of the 20S pre-rRNA (precursor to 18S), which remains part of the early pre-40S particle, from the 5′ external transcriptional spacer (5′-ETS) RNA and the 27S pre-rRNA (precursor to 25S and 5.8S) moiety (Turowski and Tollervey, 2015Turowski T.W. Tollervey D. Cotranscriptional events in eukaryotic ribosome synthesis.Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2015; 6: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The removed 5′-ETS is degraded by 3′ (nuclear exosome) and 5′ (XRNs) exonucleolytic activities (Allmang et al., 2000Allmang C. Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Tollervey D.

After dissociation from the 90S pre-ribosome, the pre-40S particle follows a relatively simple maturation route to the cytoplasm, where the final 20S to 18S rRNA processing occurs (Lamanna and Karbstein, 2009Lamanna A.C. Karbstein K. Nob1 binds the single-stranded cleavage site D at the 3′-end of 18S rRNA with its PIN domain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The path from nucleolar 90S to cytoplasmic 40S pre-ribosomes.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1370-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The assembly machinery, which is part of the 90S pre-ribosome/SSU processome, is composed of 60–70 non-ribosomal factors, with most being called U three proteins (Utp), and various small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), the most important one being the box C/D snoRNA U3 (Dragon et al., 2002Dragon F. Gallagher J.E. Compagnone-Post P.A. Mitchell B.M. Porwancher K.A. Wehner K.A. Wormsley S. Settlage R.E. Shabanowitz J. Osheim Y. et al.A large nucleolar U3 ribonucleoprotein required for 18S ribosomal RNA biogenesis.Nature. 2002; 417: 967-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). It has been shown that some of the 90S factors form structurally autonomous subcomplexes (termed UTP-A, UTP-B, UTP-C, Mpp10-Imp3-Imp4, U3 snoRNP, and Bms1-Rcl1 modules), which associate with the nascent pre-rRNA in a sequential and hierarchical fashion (Chaker-Margot et al., 2015Chaker-Margot M. Hunziker M. Barandun J. Dill B.D. Klinge S. Stage-specific assembly events of the 6-MDa small-subunit processome initiate eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Wu C. Cai G. Chen S. Ye K. Stepwise and dynamic assembly of the earliest precursors of small ribosomal subunits in yeast.Genes Dev. 2016; 30: 718-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is thought that the recruitment of these modules around the 5′-end of the nascent 35S pre-rRNA leads to the formation of the terminal knob structures, typically seen in “Miller chromatin spreads” (Mougey et al., 1993Mougey E.B. O’Reilly M. Osheim Y. Miller Jr., O.L. Beyer A. Sollner-Webb B. The terminal balls characteristic of eukaryotic rRNA transcription units in chromatin spreads are rRNA processing complexes.Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1609-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The earliest 90S modules assembling on the pre-rRNA are the two large subcomplexes UTP-A and UTP-B, which predominantly consist of WD40 (β-propeller) domain containing proteins. A significant number of 90S factors are associated with the 5′-ETS of the pre-rRNA (e.g., UTP-A, UTP-B, and Mpp10-Imp3-Imp4), whereas others bind later when the pre-18S rRNA moiety becomes co-transcriptionally available (e.g., UTP-C and Bms1-Rcl1) (Chaker-Margot et al., 2015Chaker-Margot M. Hunziker M. Barandun J. Dill B.D. Klinge S. Stage-specific assembly events of the 6-MDa small-subunit processome initiate eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Stepwise and dynamic assembly of the earliest precursors of small ribosomal subunits in yeast.Genes Dev. 2016; 30: 718-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The U3 snoRNP plays a crucial role in coordinating these first binding events to the nascent 35S pre-rRNA by base-pairing to multiple complementary sites within both the 5′-ETS and 18S rRNA moiety (Dutca et al., 2011Dutca L.M. Gallagher J.E. Baserga S.J.

Shah B.N. Manzo A.J. Walter N.G. Correll C.C. RNA chaperones stimulate formation and yield of the U3 snoRNA-Pre-rRNA duplexes needed for eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 390: 991-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The Rcl1-Bms1 heterodimer has been shown to be involved in the early cleavage at A2 within ITS1 (Horn et al., 2011Horn D.M. Mason S.L. Karbstein K. Rcl1 protein, a novel nuclease for 18 S ribosomal RNA production.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 34082-34087Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Despite the progress made regarding the composition of the 90S pre-ribosome and the role of individual factors in the assembly process, there is no information on the architecture of this huge macromolecular complex. To gain structural insight into this dynamic and flexible ∼5 MDa biogenesis intermediate, we isolated the 90S pre-ribosome from a eukaryotic thermophile and could solve its cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure at an average resolution of 7.3 Å. The cryo-EM map gives insight into the three-dimensional architecture of the 90S pre-ribosomal scaffold, revealing how the individual modules decorate the pre-18S rRNA moiety, thereby orchestrating pre-rRNA folding, processing, and assembly. Our previous studies based on size exclusion chromatography indicated that the pre-ribosomes affinity-purified through the Pwp2 (Utp1) bait protein were composed of 90S particles and a free 530 kDa Pwp2 subcomplex (Grandi et al., 2002Grandi P. Rybin V. Bassler J. Petfalski E. Strauss D. Marzioch M. Schäfer T. Kuster B. Tschochner H. Tollervey D. et al.90S pre-ribosomes include the 35S pre-rRNA, the U3 snoRNP, and 40S subunit processing factors but predominantly lack 60S synthesis factors.Mol.

Cell. 2004; 13: 225-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). To determine how 90S assembly factors from yeast are distributed between the huge 90S and smaller particles, we purified representative proteins and subsequently performed sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. The assembly factor Enp1-Flag-TEV-proteinA (FTpA) was bound to both 90S and derived pre-40S particles as anticipated (Figure S1A). In contrast, affinity-purified Utp22-FTpA as an UTP-C representative was predominantly associated with 90S pre-ribosomes, but also present in a free UTP-C complex (Figure S1A). Pwp2-FTpA (UTP-B factor) and in particular Utp10-FTpA (UTP-A factor) yielded, in addition to the 90S peak and the free UTP complexes, a third peak at the middle of the gradient (estimated Svedberg value of ∼35S; Figures 1A and S1A). The fraction corresponding to this 35S peak contained in addition to UTP-A and UTP-B, also the U3 snoRNP, the Mpp10 subcomplex and four orphan 90S assembly factors (Utp7, Utp11, Utp16, and Sof1), but lacked a number of other factors (e.g., Utp20, Rrp5, Kre33) typically present in the 90S pool (Figure 1B, compare fraction 6 and 9).Figure 1Sucrose Gradient Analysis of UTP-A Module, 90S Pre-ribosome, and Derived 5′-ETS Recycling IntermediateShow full caption(A) Separation of affinity-purified yeast Utp10-FTpA (UTP-A factor) by 15%–40% sucrose gradient centrifugation.

The pre-RNAs that co-enriched with the various purified pre-ribosomal particles were analyzed by northern blotting. When RNA was immediately extracted from IgG-Sepharose bound Utp10-FTpA or Pwp2-FTpA (i.e., during the first purification step), it contained the highest amount of the labile 35S pre-rRNA, which was found to gradually degrade during the subsequent purification steps (Figure S1B; data not shown), especially during the overnight sucrose gradient centrifugation (Figure 1A). In contrast, other shorter co-precipitated RNA species such as 23S and 22/21S forms were more stable during the prolonged isolation procedure, which could explain why we recover predominantly 23S pre-RNA in the extensively purified 90S particles. In vivo, the 23S species has been proposed to arise from aberrant processing at site A3 prior to A0–A2 cleavages within the 35S pre-rRNA (Allmang et al., 2000Allmang C. Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Degradation of ribosomal RNA precursors by the exosome.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1684-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), but there is also the suggestion that the 23S form is physiologically relevant (Granneman and Baserga, 2004Granneman S. Baserga S.J. Ribosome biogenesis: of knobs and RNA processing.Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 296: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). It is also conceivable that some of the 23S RNA associated with the extensively purified 90S particles was generated in vitro from the original 35S pre-RNA by degradation of the unprotected 27S pre-rRNA moiety largely devoid of 60S assembly factors (Grandi et al., 2002Grandi P.

When the RNA of the particle from the middle of the gradient was analyzed, it contained besides the U3 snoRNA only 5′-ETS RNA fragments derived from early SSU processome cleavages, which are destined for degradation (Figures 1A and S1A). Markedly, the free UTP-A complex also carried the 5′-ETS rRNA (Figure 1A). Consistent with this data, in vivo RNA-protein crosslinking showed that the UTP-A factor Utp9 contacts the 5′-ETS RNA at the extreme 5′ end (helix I and II) of the 35S pre-rRNA (Figure 2A), whereas the UTP-B factor Pwp2 was crosslinked “downstream” of the Utp9 binding region, namely at helix V and VI within the 5′-ETS (Figure 2A). Pwp2 could also be UV-crosslinked to U3 snoRNA at the 3′ hinge and box C′ region, suggesting that UTP-B subunits stabilize the 5′-ETS::U3 snoRNA heteroduplex at this site (Figure 2B). To find out whether the 5′-ETS rRNA containing particle is a recycling intermediate formed upon 90S pre-ribosome dismantling, we depleted the Rrp6 exosome factor in the utp18-5xAla mutant that was previously shown to be impaired in 5′-ETS degradation due to impaired exosome recruitment to the 90S pre-ribosome (Thoms et al., 2015Thoms M. Thomson E. Baßler J. Gnädig M. Griesel S. Hurt E. The exosome is recruited to RNA substrates through specific adaptor proteins.Cell. 2015; 162: 1029-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Indeed, a massive buildup of the 5′-ETS particle with exaggerated 5′-ETS RNA accumulation, impaired 40S formation and synthetic growth inhibition was induced in this double mutant (Figures S1C–S1G). These data indicate that the bulk of 90S biogenesis factors including UTP-A, UTP-B, and U3 snoRNP complexes become trapped in a processing intermediate, when exosome-dependent 5′-ETS RNA degradation is inhibited. To gain first structural insight into the 90S pre-ribosome and its derived smaller particles, we performed negative-stain electron microscopy. Two-dimensional class averages indicated that UTP-A and UTP-B modules form somewhat round to elongated 10–15 nm assemblies with globular subdomains (Figure S2A), which could correspond to flexibly joined subunits, presumably β-propeller domains, since most of the UTP-A and UTP-B subunits carry either single or double WD40 domains (Figure S2B). Two-dimensional classes of the 5′-ETS recycling intermediate revealed a significantly larger and elongated structure compared to the subcomplexes, ∼30 nm in length and 25 nm in width (Figure S2A). The 90S pre-ribosome constitutes the largest assembly with an overall size of 40 nm × 35 nm and a cone-shaped bilobal organization (Figure S2A). Reconstruction of low-resolution 3D volumes of the 5′-ETS particle revealed a shallow or bowl-like structure, which in its overall dimension is even larger than the mature 40S subunit (Figure S2C). The form and size of the 5′-ETS particle and the fact that it is a structural component of the 90S pre-ribosome led to the idea that it could serve as a scaffold that engulfs the pre-18S rRNA during co-transcriptional assembly. Next, we carried out cryo-electron microscopy to gain molecular insight into the architecture of the 90S pre-ribosome. The cryo-EM structure of the yeast 90S pre-ribosome was solved at ∼20 Å resolution, which prevented identification of assembly factors or pre-rRNA (Figure 3A). Hence, we sought to analyze 90S pre-ribosomal particles from Chaetomium thermophilum (ct), a eukaryotic thermophile, with the aim of obtaining a higher resolution cryo-EM structure. To test whether 90S pre-ribosomal particles can be directly isolated from this thermophilic fungus, we purified the conserved UTP-A factor ctUtp17-FTpA and subsequently performed sucrose gradient centrifugation. In this way and as in yeast, the free ctUTP-A complex could be separated from the ct90S pre-ribosome fraction, which contained the myriad of 90S factors, previously annotated in yeast (Figures S3A and S3B; Table S2). Thus, it is possible to isolate 90S pre-ribosomes and derived subcomplexes with good yield directly from a eukaryotic thermophile.Figure S3Isolation of 90S Pre-ribosomal Particles from Chaetomium thermophilum, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Separation of Utp17-FTpA (UTP-A factor) eluate affinity-purified directly from Chaetomium thermophilum by 10%–45% sucrose gradient centrifugation.

For cryo-EM analysis, we affinity-purified the ct90S particles via ctUtp6-FTpA (UTP-B factor), which co-enriched predominantly with 90S pre-ribosomes with almost no free UTP-B complex (Figure 3A; data not shown), thus making the Flag-peptide eluate ready-to-use for cryo-EM. As was found for ctUtp17, the ctUtp6-FTpA preparation contained all the known 90S modules including UTP-A, UTP-B, UTP-C, Mpp10-Imp3-Imp4, U3 snoRNP, Bms1-Rcl1, and the huge α-helically predicted protein Utp20 (Figure 3A). Negative-stain EM of this ct90S particle revealed a homogenous preparation (Figure S3C) and subsequent 2D classification showed the typical cone-like structure as previously seen for the yeast 90S particles (Figure S3D). Strikingly, the thermophilic 90S pre-ribosome could be solved at 7.3 Å average resolution by cryo-EM, with close to 4 Å in the core and decreasing resolution toward the periphery (Figures 3B and 3C). The shape of this huge monolithic particle resembles that observed at lower resolution for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae particle and its dimension extends to 36 nm in width and 40 nm in height (Figure 3B). The ct90S particle can be roughly divided into three main parts, a base structure, from which a few finger-like projections protrude, a central body with a massive backpack-like attachment, and a head region with characteristic snake-like features. Notably, the base and head are connected by a long arch-like protein (Figure 4A). Upon using different contour levels for displaying the cryo-EM density, a considerable amount of the mass in the periphery appeared indeed flexible despite the overall rigidity of the core (Figure S4). Strikingly, no region of the ct90S pre-ribosome is yet as compact when compared to its derived mature 40S ribosomal subunit, which is due to a rather perforated structure with numerous cavities and channels in its internal core.Figure S4The ct90S Pre-ribosome Map Displayed at Different Contour Levels, Related to Figure 3Show full captionThree different contour levels (0.015, 0.025 and 0.035) were selected for displaying the ct90S pre-ribosome map (tilted front and top view) with indicated scale bar of 10 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Three different contour levels (0.015, 0.025 and 0.035) were selected for displaying the ct90S pre-ribosome map (tilted front and top"

While micromanipulation or cell sorting followed by cell lysis is already used for subsequent molecular examinations, approaches to directly extract the content of living cells remain a challenging but promising alternative to achieving non-destructive sampling and cell-context preservation. Here, we demonstrate the quantitative extraction from single cells with spatiotemporal control using fluidic force microscopy. We further present a comprehensive analysis of the soluble molecules withdrawn from the cytoplasm or the nucleus, including the detection of enzyme activities and transcript abundances. This approach has uncovered the ability of cells to withstand extraction of up to several picoliters and opens opportunities to study cellular dynamics and cell-cell communication under physiological conditions at the single-cell level."

https://openalex.org/W2471782782,"In cancer research, the accuracy of the technology used for biomarkers detection is remarkably important. In this context, digital PCR represents a highly sensitive and reproducible method that could serve as an appropriate tool for tumor mutational status analysis. In particular, droplet-based digital PCR approaches have been developed for detection of tumor-specific mutated alleles within plasmatic circulating DNA. Such an approach calls for the development and validation of a very significant quantity of assays, which can be extremely costly and time consuming. Herein, we evaluated assays for the detection and quantification of various mutations occurring in three genes often misregulated in cancers: the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) and the Tumoral Protein p53 (TP53) genes. In particular, commercial competitive allele-specific TaqMan® PCR (castPCR™) technology, as well as TaqMan® and ZEN™ assays, have been evaluated for EGFR p.L858R, p.T790M, p.L861Q point mutations and in-frame deletions Del19. Specificity and sensitivity have been determined on cell lines DNA, plasmatic circulating DNA of lung cancer patients or Horizon Diagnostics Reference Standards.

Newly hatched domesticated mallards that were briefly exposed to a pair of objects that were either the same or different in shape or color later preferred to follow pairs of new objects exhibiting the imprinted relation.

https://openalex.org/W2465848062,"Stereotypic behavior is an important indicator of compromised welfare. Zoo elephants are documented to perform stereotypic behavior, but the factors that contribute to performance have not been systematically assessed. We collected behavioral data on 89 elephants (47 African [Loxodonta africana], 42 Asian [Elephas maximus]) at 39 North American zoos during the summer and winter. Elephants were videoed for a median of 12 daytime hours per season. A subset of 32 elephants (19 African, 13 Asian) was also observed live for a median of 10.5 nighttime hours. Percentages of visible behavior scans were calculated from five minute instantaneous samples. Stereotypic behavior was the second most commonly performed behavior (after feeding), making up 15.5% of observations during the daytime and 24.8% at nighttime. Negative binomial regression models fitted with generalized estimating equations were used to determine which social, housing, management, life history, and demographic variables were associated with daytime and nighttime stereotypic behavior rates. Species was a significant risk factor in both models, with Asian elephants at greater risk (daytime: p<0.001, Risk Ratio = 4.087; nighttime: p<0.001, Risk Ratio = 8.015). For both species, spending time housed separately (p<0.001, Risk Ratio = 1.009), and having experienced inter-zoo transfers (p<0.001, Risk Ratio = 1.175), increased the risk of performing higher rates of stereotypy during the day, while spending more time with juvenile elephants (p<0.001, Risk Ratio = 0.985), and engaging with zoo staff reduced this risk (p = 0.018, Risk Ratio = 0.988). At night, spending more time in environments with both indoor and outdoor areas (p = 0.013, Risk Ratio = 0.987) and in larger social groups (p = 0.039, Risk Ratio = 0.752) corresponded with reduced risk of performing higher rates of stereotypy, while having experienced inter-zoo transfers (p = 0.033, Risk Ratio = 1.115) increased this risk. Overall, our results indicate that factors related to the social environment are most influential in predicting elephant stereotypic behavior rates."
https://openalex.org/W2472595233,"As part of a multi-institutional study of zoo elephant welfare, we evaluated female elephants managed by zoos accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and applied epidemiological methods to determine what factors in the zoo environment are associated with reproductive problems, including ovarian acyclicity and hyperprolactinemia. Bi-weekly blood samples were collected from 95 African (Loxodonta africana) and 75 Asian (Elephas maximus) (8-55 years of age) elephants over a 12-month period for analysis of serum progestogens and prolactin. Females were categorized as normal cycling (regular 13- to 17-week cycles), irregular cycling (cycles longer or shorter than normal) or acyclic (baseline progestogens, <0.1 ng/ml throughout), and having Low/Normal (<14 or 18 ng/ml) or High (≥14 or 18 ng/ml) prolactin for Asian and African elephants, respectively. Rates of normal cycling, acyclicity and irregular cycling were 73.2, 22.5 and 4.2% for Asian, and 48.4, 37.9 and 13.7% for African elephants, respectively, all of which differed between species (P < 0.05). For African elephants, univariate assessment found that social isolation decreased and higher enrichment diversity increased the chance a female would cycle normally. The strongest multi-variable models included Age (positive) and Enrichment Diversity (negative) as important factors of acyclicity among African elephants. The Asian elephant data set was not robust enough to support multi-variable analyses of cyclicity status. Additionally, only 3% of Asian elephants were found to be hyperprolactinemic as compared to 28% of Africans, so predictive analyses of prolactin status were conducted on African elephants only. The strongest multi-variable model included Age (positive), Enrichment Diversity (negative), Alternate Feeding Methods (negative) and Social Group Contact (positive) as predictors of hyperprolactinemia. In summary, the incidence of ovarian cycle problems and hyperprolactinemia predominantly affects African elephants, and increases in social stability and feeding and enrichment diversity may have positive influences on hormone status."
https://openalex.org/W2465646024,"Considerable mechanistic insight has been gained into amyloid aggregation; however, a large number of non-amyloid protein aggregates are considered ""amorphous,"" and in most cases, little is known about their mechanisms. Amorphous aggregation of γ-crystallins in the eye lens causes cataract, a widespread disease of aging. We combined simulations and experiments to study the mechanism of aggregation of two γD-crystallin mutants, W42R and W42Q: the former a congenital cataract mutation, and the latter a mimic of age-related oxidative damage. We found that formation of an internal disulfide was necessary and sufficient for aggregation under physiological conditions. Two-chain all-atom simulations predicted that one non-native disulfide in particular, between Cys(32) and Cys(41), was likely to stabilize an unfolding intermediate prone to intermolecular interactions. Mass spectrometry and mutagenesis experiments confirmed the presence of this bond in the aggregates and its necessity for oxidative aggregation under physiological conditions in vitro Mining the simulation data linked formation of this disulfide to extrusion of the N-terminal β-hairpin and rearrangement of the native β-sheet topology. Specific binding between the extruded hairpin and a distal β-sheet, in an intermolecular chain reaction similar to domain swapping, is the most probable mechanism of aggregate propagation."

CD38 expression on MAIT cells was increased in AHCV/HIV patients. MAIT cells were responsive to IFN-α in vitro as evidenced by enhanced frequencies of IFN-γ producing cells. IFN-α-based therapy for CHCV decreased the frequency of IFN-γ+ MAIT cells, which was still observed 24 weeks after successful therapy. Importantly, even after successful IFN-α-based as well as IFN-α-free therapy for CHCV, decreased frequencies of MAIT cells persisted. We show that the frequencies of MAIT cells are reduced in blood of patients with CHCV, HIV and in AHCV/HIV co-infection compared to healthy individuals. Successful therapy for CHCV did not normalize MAIT cell frequencies at 24 weeks follow up. The impact of HIV and HCV infection on the numbers and function of MAIT cells warrant further studies on the impact of viral infections and the antimicrobial function of MAIT cells."

The cell wall core, which is essential for viability, consists of peptidoglycan (PG) 5The abbreviations used are:PGpeptidoglycanAGarabinogalactancAGCorynebacterium AGDec-Pdecaprenyl phosphateMurmuramic acidMurNAcN-acetylmuramic acidMurNAc-6PMurNAc 6-phosphateWTAwall teichoic acidsLCPLytR-Cps2A-PsrTMtransmembraneGPPgeranyl pyrophosphateIPTGisopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranosideTEMtransmission EMMICminimum inhibitory concentrationOADColeic albumin dextrose catalaseADCalbumin dextrose catalaseBHIbrain-heart infusionKankanamycin. in covalent attachment via phosphoryl-N-acetylglucosaminosyl-rhamnosyl linkage units (P-GlcNAc-Rha)with the heteropolysaccharide arabinogalactan (AG); AG is in turn esterified at its non-reducing ends to long-chain (C70–C90) mycolic acids (Fig. 1). The latter form the bulk of the inner leaflet of the outer membrane (also referred to as mycomembrane), with the outer layer consisting of a variety of non-covalently attached (glyco)lipids, polysaccharides, lipoglycans, and proteins (3Daffé M.

A WecA-like transferase encoded by Rv1302 in the genome of M. tuberculosis H37Rv transfers GlcNAc 1-phosphate to Dec-P to form Dec-P-P-GlcNAc (GL-1). This step is followed by the attachment of a rhamnosyl residue from dTDP-Rha to the 3-position of GlcNAc in a reaction catalyzed by WbbL1 to form GL-2 (Dec-P-P-GlcNAc-Rha), the “linker unit” (Fig. 1). The galactan is biosynthesized in the cytoplasm by two bifunctional galactosyltransferases, with the first two Galf residues added to the linker unit by the galactosyltransferase GlfT1 (Rv3782) and the remaining alternating 5- and 6-linked Galf residues added by GlfT2 (Rv3808c). The arabinosylation of AG takes place on the periplasmic side of the plasma membrane catalyzed by membrane-associated decaprenyl phosphate arabinose-dependent glycosyltransferases (7Angala S.K. Belardinelli J.M. Huc-Claustre E. Wheat W.H. Jackson M. The cell envelope glycoconjugates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2014; 49: 361-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It is thought that the GlcNAc of the linker unit of the mature AG next forms a 1-O-phosphoryl linkage with the 6-position of a MurNAc residue of PG (12Yagi T. Mahapatra S. Mikusova K. Crick D.C.

Chem. 2003; 278: 26497-26504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and that this transfer reaction requires newly synthesized PG undergoing concomitant cross-linking (13Hancock I.C. Carman S. Besra G.S. Brennan P.J. Waite E.

The fact that a Corynebacterium glutamicum mutant deficient in the arabinan domain of AG was found to assemble a simplified cell wall consisting of the galactan chain of AG attached to PG suggests, however, that neither the arabinosylation of AG nor its mycolylation are prerequisites for its attachment to PG (14Alderwick L.J.

Despite intensive efforts to identify the ligase(s) responsible for the covalent attachment of AG to PG, no enzymes had yet been categorically implicated in the ligation process. Wall teichoic acids (WTA), in place of AG, are more classically found in covalent attachment to PG in the cell walls of many Gram-positive bacteria (16Swoboda J.G. Campbell J. Meredith T.C. Walker S. Wall teichoic acid function, biosynthesis, and inhibition.Chembiochem. 2010; 11: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Despite the fundamental structural differences that exist between these anionic glycopolymers and AG, the structure of the AG-PG linker shares similarity with that involved in the covalent attachment of WTA to PG (e.g. -N-acetylmannosaminyl-N-acetylglucosaminyl-phosphoryl- in Bacillus subtilis). Much like AG, the biosynthesis of WTA is initiated on a polyisoprenoid carrier (undecaprenyl phosphate) on the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane. The transfer of the two first sugar residues (N-acetylglucosaminyl and N-acetylmannosaminyl) from their nucleotide donors is followed by the assembly of the rest of the linker and the teichoic acid proper, still on the lipid carrier. The WTA precursors are then exported by an ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter to the cell surface, where the WTA are finally transferred from their lipid-linked precursor to the C-6 hydroxyl of MurNAc within PG (16Swoboda J.G. Campbell J. Meredith T.C. Walker S. Wall teichoic acid function, biosynthesis, and inhibition.Chembiochem. 2010; 11: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar).

These reports led us to investigate the possible involvement and therapeutic potential of the three LCP-like proteins encoded by the M. tuberculosis genome in the ligation of AG to PG. Our results highlight the participation of two of these proteins in the phosphotransferase reaction leading to the ligation of AG and PG, a crucial step in the assembly of the entire complex cell wall of M. tuberculosis. LCP proteins share a conserved predicted secondary structure consisting of an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, one to three transmembrane (TM) regions and an extracellular C-terminal region carrying the LytR-Cps2A-Psr domain (17Hübscher J. Lüthy L. Berger-Bachi B. Stutzmann Meier P. Phylogenetic distribution and membrane topology of the LytR-CpsA-Psr protein family.BMC Genomics. 2008; 9: 617Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). LCP-encoding genes further tend to cluster with the biosynthetic genes of the glycopolymers of which they catalyze the transfer (26Chan Y.G. Kim H.K. Schneewind O. Missiakas D. The capsular polysaccharide of Staphylococcus aureus is attached to peptidoglycan by the LytR-CpsA-Psr (LCP) family of enzymes.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 15680-15690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A search for proteins displaying the characteristic secondary structure and signature motif of LCP proteins in the translated genome of M. tuberculosis H37Rv yielded three candidates: Rv0822c, Rv3267 (herein renamed CpsA1), and Rv3484 (herein renamed CpsA2). The three proteins share between 21 and 29% identity (37–50% similarity) with LCP proteins from S. aureus (MsrR, SA0908, and SA2103), Streptococcus pneumoniae (CpsA2), and B. subtilis (TagT, TagU, and TagV) (Fig. 2A). Whereas both CpsA1 and CpsA2 are predicted to display a short (13–24-residue) N-terminal cytoplasmic domain followed by a single TM segment and a periplasmic catalytic domain (Fig. 2B), Rv0822c displays a significantly longer N-terminal domain (175 residues) and lacks a clear TM helix based on TMHMM server version 2.0 predictions. Importantly, cpsA1 maps to an AG biosynthetic gene cluster adjacent to wbbL1 (Rv3265c) and rmlD (Rv3266c) involved, respectively, in the formation of GL-2 and dTDP-Rha. This gene was reported to be induced by ethambutol (an inhibitor of AG synthesis) (30Boshoff H.I. Myers T.G. Copp B.R. McNeil M.R. Wilson M.A. Barry 3rd, C.E. The transcriptional responses of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to inhibitors of metabolism: novel insights into drug mechanisms of action.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40174-40184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) and is also the most conserved candidate across the Mycobacterium genus and other AG-producing Actinobacteria, including C. glutamicum. CpsA2, in contrast, is apparently not well conserved in rapidly growing Mycobacterium species, and Rv0822c is a pseudogene in Mycobacterium leprae. To experimentally validate the transmembrane topology of Rv0822c, CpsA1, and CpsA2, C-terminal GFP fusions were generated for each of the three genes in the pJB(−) and pJB(+) mycobacterial expression plasmids (31Belardinelli J.M. Larrouy-Maumus G. Jones V. Sorio de Carvalho L.P. McNeil M.R. Jackson M. Biosynthesis and translocation of unsulfated acyltrehaloses in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 27952-27965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and used to transform Mycobacterium smegmatis. In pJB(+), the addition of a single transmembrane domain from glycophorin A between the C-terminal fusion point of the protein of interest and the GFP converts membrane proteins with extracellular C-terminal fusions to proteins with intracellular C-terminal fusions (32Hsieh J.M. Besserer G.M. Madej M.G. Bui H.Q. Kwon S. Abramson J. Bridging the gap: a GFP-based strategy for overexpression and purification of membrane proteins with intra and extracellular C-termini.Protein Sci. 2010; 19: 868-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In pJB(−), the GFP fusion is direct and indicates the native topology. Because GFP fluoresces in the cytoplasm but not in the periplasm, a high fluorescence signal in the pJB(−) version and background fluorescence in the pJB(+) version are indicative of the C-terminal fusion of the protein being cytoplasmic. Opposite fluorescence intensities indicate, on the contrary, that the C-terminal fusion of the protein is localized in the periplasm. As shown in Fig. 2C, the LCP domains of all three fusion proteins clearly map to the periplasmic face of the plasma membrane of M. smegmatis. Ideally, topological determination of CpsA1, CpsA2, and Rv0822c would be improved by using more than one reporter to prepare fusion constructs. However, there was precedent in the GFP fusion approach that we followed, and our result was consistent with what has been reported in other studies involving proteins from Mycobacterium and Corynebacterium species (31Belardinelli J.M. Larrouy-Maumus G. Jones V. Sorio de Carvalho L.P. McNeil M.R. Jackson M. Biosynthesis and translocation of unsulfated acyltrehaloses in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.J. Biol.

LCP proteins are thought to catalyze a phosphotransferase reaction in which polyprenyl phosphate-linked glycopolymer intermediates are transferred onto the C-6 hydroxyl of MurNAc residues within PG releasing polyprenyl phosphate. Accordingly, LCP proteins display pyrophosphatase activity (i.e. cleavage of the pyrophosphate group to release free phosphate) on geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP). This activity was shown to be magnesium-dependent, and conserved residues required for the binding of polyprenyl chains, pyrophosphate, and Mg2+ were identified within the primary sequence of these enzymes (19Kawai Y. Marles-Wright J. Cleverley R.M. Emmins R. Ishikawa S. Kuwano M. Heinz N. Bui N.K. Hoyland C.N. Ogasawara N. Lewis R.J. Vollmer W. Daniel R.A. Errington J. A widespread family of bacterial cell wall assembly proteins.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 4931-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These residues are well conserved in CpsA1, CpsA2, and Rv0822c (Fig. 2A). To determine whether the M. tuberculosis LCP candidates are endowed with pyrophosphatase activity, all three proteins (devoid of TM domain) were recombinantly expressed in E. coli, purified (Fig. 3A), and tested for activity on GPP by monitoring phosphate release. All three proteins displayed time-dependent and protein concentration-dependent pyrophosphatase activity on the generic substrate (Fig. 3, B and C). In all cases, activity was inhibited by EDTA, indicative of a requirement of the enzymes for magnesium ions (Fig. 3D). The involvement of M. tuberculosis LCP proteins in the ligation of AG to PG was next assessed genetically by disrupting the genes of interest by allelic replacement and analyzing the consequences of these disruptions on growth and cell wall biosynthesis. As a first approach, the closely related Corynebacterianeae, C. glutamicum ATCC13032, was used as a model in these experiments in light of the known permissiveness of this bacterium to changes affecting its cell wall composition. Also, C. glutamicum displays two putative LCP proteins compared with three in M. tuberculosis. Cg0847 (cps2a) is orthologous to Rv3267 and, like its M. tuberculosis counterpart, maps to the same AG biosynthetic gene cluster in the C. glutamicum genome. Cg0847 and Rv3267 (M. tuberculosis CpsA1) share 50% identity and 63% similarity on a 452-amino acid residue overlap (Fig. 2A). The second putative LCP protein of C. glutamicum, Cg3210, has no clear ortholog in M. tuberculosis but most closely resembles Rv0822c (30% identity and 45% similarity on a 285-amino acid residue overlap). Both Cg0847 and Cg3210 display the conserved predicted secondary structure of LCP proteins consisting of an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (28 and 119 amino acid residues long, respectively), one TM region, and an extracellular C-terminal region carrying the LytR-Cps2A-Psr domain (data not shown). To investigate the putative involvement of Cg0847 and Cg3210 in the assembling of the cell wall core, their encoding genes were disrupted by allelic replacement in C. glutamicum. Whereas Cg3210 disruption was easily achieved (Fig. 4A), the screening of 210 Cg0847 candidate mutants by PCR failed to identify any null mutant, suggesting that Cg0847 may be essential for growth. Evidence for this assumption was obtained by constructing a conditional Cg0847 knockdown mutant, CGLcKD-0847, in which the endogenous Cg0847 gene was disrupted and replaced by a WT copy of this gene expressed from an IPTG-inducible promoter (Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig. 4C, whereas CGLcKD-0847 grew in medium containing IPTG, it totally failed to grow in the absence of inducer. Thus, Cg0847 is essential for C. glutamicum growth, and Cg3210 cannot compensate for a deficiency in Cg0847. The Cg3210 knock-out mutant (CGLΔ3210) grew similarly to the WT parent C. glutamicum strain (Fig. 4C). Preliminary optical microscopic observations revealed that decreasing the concentration of IPTG in the culture medium led to important changes in the morphology of CGLcKD-0847, characterized by the appearance of more voluminous asymmetric cells (representing ∼90% of the cell population shown in Fig. 4D), most of which displayed several septa. To better visualize the effects of silencing Cg0847 on the cell envelope, CGLcKD-0847 cells were analyzed by cryo-TEM. Whereas WT cells were homogeneous and presented a typical C. glutamicum cell envelope with a continuous outer membrane (Fig. 5A), CGLcKD-0847 grown in the presence of a low concentration of IPTG (25 μm) revealed a heterogeneous population of cells, some of them clearly displaying a disrupted outer layer with large fragments detaching from the cell surface (Fig. 5B). Other cells in the CGLcKD-0847 culture presented phenotypes intermediate between that showed in Fig. 5B and that of WT C. glutamicum, possibly reflecting their different metabolic state and level of exposure to IPTG (data not shown). The shedding of material by CGLcKD-0847 was evident from the recovery of a translucent pellet upon ultracentrifugation of culture supernatants whose abundance was inversely proportional to the concentration of IPTG added to the culture medium. Whereas a pellet was clearly visible in CGLcKD-0847 cultures grown in the presence of 0, 12.5, and 25 μm IPTG (Fig. 6A), no pellet was recovered from cultures containing 1 mm IPTG or from WT C. glutamicum cultures. Cryo-TEM analysis of the released material revealed the presence of fragments of different sizes and shapes in the conditional knockdown that were not seen in similarly processed WT C. glutamicum culture supernatants (Fig. 6, B and C). These fragments are reminiscent of those previously observed in a C. glutamicum aftB mutant deficient in the synthesis of the non-reducing arabinan termini of AG (33Bou Raad R. Méniche X. de Sousa-d'Auria C. Chami M. Salmeron C. Tropis M. Labarre C. Daffé M. Houssin C. Bayan N. A deficiency in arabinogalactan biosynthesis affects Corynebacterium glutamicum mycolate outer membrane stability.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 2691-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and are suggestive of the release of cell wall and outer membrane materials by CGLcKD-0847. The finding of sugars, lipids, and proteins typifying the outer membrane and cell wall core of C. glutamicum in the ultracentrifugation pellet shown in Fig. 6A supports this assumption. Indeed, whereas WT C. glutamicum and cg0847 knockdown cells displayed very similar total lipid contents (supplemental Fig. S1), culture supernatants from the latter strain were clearly enriched in trehalose monocorynomycolates (TMCM) and trehalose dicorynomycolates (TDCM), showing only minimal amounts of inner membrane phospholipids (34Bansal-Mutalik R.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 15360-15365Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6D). Likewise, the protein profile of the released fragments resembled that obtained upon SDS treatment of the WT cells, a treatment known to extract cell wall but not inner membrane proteins (33Bou Raad R.

Therefore, plasma coagulation markers may have additional diagnostic relevance in ACS. By using novel coagulation assays this study aims to gain more insight into the relationship between the coagulation system and ACS. Methods We measured plasma thrombin generation, factor XIa and D-dimer levels in plasma from ACS (n = 104) and non-ACS patients (n = 42). Follow-up measurements (n = 73) were performed at 1 and 6 months. Associations between coagulation markers and recurrent cardiovascular events were calculated by logistic regression analysis. Results Thrombin generation was significantly enhanced in ACS compared to non-ACS patients: peak height 148±53 vs. 122±42 nM. There was a significantly diminished ETP reduction (32 vs. 41%) and increased intrinsic coagulation activation (25 vs. 7%) in ACS compared to non-ACS patients. Furthermore, compared to non-ACS patients factor XIa and D-dimer levels were significantly elevated in ACS patients: 1.9±1.1 vs. 1.4±0.7 pM and 495(310–885) vs. 380(235–540) μg/L. Within the ACS spectrum, ST-elevated myocardial infarction patients had the highest prothrombotic profile. During the acute event, thrombin generation was significantly increased compared to 1 and 6 months afterwards: peak height 145±52 vs. 100±44 vs. 98±33 nM. Both peak height and factor XIa levels on admission predicted recurrent cardiovascular events (OR: 4.9 [95%CI 1.2–20.9] and 4.5 [1.1–18.9]). Conclusion ACS patients had an enhanced prothrombotic profile, demonstrated by an increased thrombin generation potential, factor XIa and D-dimer levels. This study is the first to demonstrate the positive association between factor XIa, thrombin generation and recurrent cardiovascular events."
https://openalex.org/W2469075414,"Visual processing is not instantaneous, but instead our conscious perception depends on the integration of sensory input over time. In the case of Continuous Flash Suppression (CFS), masks are flashed to one eye, suppressing awareness of stimuli presented to the other eye. One potential explanation of CFS is that it depends, at least in part, on the flashing mask continually interrupting visual processing before the stimulus reaches awareness. We investigated the temporal features of masks in two ways. First, we measured the suppression effectiveness of a wide range of masking frequencies (0-32Hz), using both complex (faces/houses) and simple (closed/open geometric shapes) stimuli. Second, we varied whether the different frequencies were interleaved within blocks or separated in homogenous blocks, in order to see if suppression was stronger or weaker when the frequency remained constant across trials. We found that break-through contrast differed dramatically between masking frequencies, with mask effectiveness following a skewed-normal curve peaking around 6Hz and little or no masking for low and high temporal frequencies. Peak frequency was similar for trial-randomized and block randomized conditions. In terms of type of stimulus, we found no significant difference in peak frequency between the stimulus groups (complex/simple, face/house, closed/open). These findings suggest that temporal factors play a critical role in perceptual awareness, perhaps due to interactions between mask frequency and the time frame of visual processing."
https://openalex.org/W2465684847,"It is known that periods of intense social interaction result in shared patterns in collaborators' physiological signals. However, applied quantitative research on collaboration is hindered due to scarcity of objective metrics of teamwork effectiveness. Indeed, especially in the domain of productive, ecologically-valid activity such as programming, there is a lack of evidence for the most effective, affordable and reliable measures of collaboration quality. In this study we investigate synchrony in physiological signals between collaborating computer science students performing pair-programming exercises in a class room environment. We recorded electrocardiography over the course of a 60 minute programming session, using lightweight physiological sensors. We employ correlation of heart-rate variability features to study social psychophysiological compliance of the collaborating students. We found evident physiological compliance in collaborating dyads' heart-rate variability signals. Furthermore, dyads' self-reported workload was associated with the physiological compliance. Our results show viability of a novel approach to field measurement using lightweight devices in an uncontrolled environment, and suggest that self-reported collaboration quality can be assessed via physiological signals."
https://openalex.org/W2465150812,"The ubiquitin/proteasome pathway is a well characterized system for degrading intracellular proteins, although many aspects remain poorly understood. There is, for instance, a conspicuous lack of understanding of the site(s) where nuclear proteins are degraded because the subcellular distribution of peptidase activity has not been investigated systematically. Although nuclear proteins could be degraded by importing proteasomes into the nucleus, it is also evident that some nuclear proteins are degraded only after export to cytosolic proteasomes. Proteasomes and substrates are mobile, and consequently, the sites of degradation might not be static. We sought to identify the location of proteasomes to provide more conclusive evidence on the sites of protein degradation. We report that catalytically active proteasomes exist almost exclusively in the cytosol. The resulting lack of nuclear peptidase activity suggests that little, if any, degradation occurs in the nucleus. These and other studies suggest that the export of proteolytic substrates could define an important regulatory step in the degradation of nuclear proteins by cytosolic proteasomes."
https://openalex.org/W2468765848,"Formation of extracellular traps (ETs) capturing and immobilizing pathogens is now a well-established defense mechanism added to the repertoire of vertebrate phagocytes. These ETs are composed of extracellular DNA (extDNA), histones and antimicrobial proteins. Formation of mouse and human ETs depends on enzymes (i) facilitating decondensation of chromatin by citrullination of histones, and (ii) serine proteases degrading histones. In invertebrates, initial reports revealed existence of ETs composed of extDNA and histones, and here we document for the first time that also coelomocytes, immunocompetent cells of an earthworm Eisenia andrei, cast ETs which successfully trap bacteria in a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent and -independent manner. Importantly, the formation of ETs was observed not only when coelomocytes were studied ex vivo, but also in vivo, directly in the earthworm coelom. These ETs were composed of extDNA, heat shock proteins (HSP27) and H3 histones. Furthermore, the formation of E. andrei ETs depended on activity of serine proteases, including elastase-like activity. Moreover, ETs interconnected and hold together aggregating coelomocytes, a processes proceeding encapsulation. In conclusion, the study confirms ET formation by earthworms, and unravels mechanisms leading to ET formation and encapsulation in invertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2468243013,"Theoretical models predict that animals should make foraging decisions after assessing the quality of available habitat, but most models fail to consider the spatio-temporal scales at which animals perceive habitat availability. We tested three foraging strategies that explain how Magellanic woodpeckers (Campephilus magellanicus) assess the relative quality of trees: 1) Woodpeckers with local knowledge select trees based on the available trees in the immediate vicinity. 2) Woodpeckers lacking local knowledge select trees based on their availability at previously visited locations. 3) Woodpeckers using information from long-term memory select trees based on knowledge about trees available within the entire landscape. We observed foraging woodpeckers and used a Brownian Bridge Movement Model to identify trees available to woodpeckers along foraging routes. Woodpeckers selected trees with a later decay stage than available trees. Selection models indicated that preferences of Magellanic woodpeckers were based on clusters of trees near the most recently visited trees, thus suggesting that woodpeckers use visual cues from neighboring trees. In a second analysis, Cox’s proportional hazards models showed that woodpeckers used information consolidated across broader spatial scales to adjust tree residence times. Specifically, woodpeckers spent more time at trees with larger diameters and in a more advanced stage of decay than trees available along their routes. These results suggest that Magellanic woodpeckers make foraging decisions based on the relative quality of trees that they perceive and memorize information at different spatio-temporal scales."
https://openalex.org/W2472556994,"Species are experiencing a suite of novel stressors from anthropogenic activities that have impacts at multiple scales. Vulnerability assessment is one tool to evaluate the likely impacts that these stressors pose to species so that high-vulnerability cases can be identified and prioritized for monitoring, protection, or mitigation. Commonly used semi-quantitative methods lack a framework to explicitly account for differences in exposure to stressors and organism responses across life stages. Here we propose a modification to commonly used spatial vulnerability assessment methods that includes such an approach, using ocean acidification in the California Current as an illustrative case study. Life stage considerations were included by assessing vulnerability of each life stage to ocean acidification and were used to estimate population vulnerability in two ways. We set population vulnerability equal to: (1) the maximum stage vulnerability and (2) a weighted mean across all stages, with weights calculated using Lefkovitch matrix models. Vulnerability was found to vary across life stages for the six species explored in this case study: two krill-Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera, pteropod-Limacina helicina, pink shrimp-Pandalus jordani, Dungeness crab-Metacarcinus magister and Pacific hake-Merluccius productus. The maximum vulnerability estimates ranged from larval to subadult and adult stages with no consistent stage having maximum vulnerability across species. Similarly, integrated vulnerability metrics varied greatly across species. A comparison showed that some species had vulnerabilities that were similar between the two metrics, while other species' vulnerabilities varied substantially between the two metrics. These differences primarily resulted from cases where the most vulnerable stage had a low relative weight. We compare these methods and explore circumstances where each method may be appropriate."
https://openalex.org/W2474310180,"Coats' disease is an uncommon form of retinal telangiectasis, and the identification of novel proteins that contribute to the development of Coats' disease is useful for improving treatment efficacy. Proteomic techniques have been used to study many eye diseases; however, few studies have used proteomics to study the development of Coats' disease.Isobaric tagging for relative and absolute protein quantification (iTRAQ) was employed to screen differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the aqueous humor (AH) between stage 3A patients (n = 8), stage 3B patients (n = 14), stage 4 patients (n = 2) and control patients (n = 20). Differentially co-expressed proteins (DCPs) were present in all three stages of Coats' disease and were considered disease-specific proteins. These proteins were further analyzed using Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotations.A total of 819 proteins were identified in the AH, 222 of which were significantly differentially expressed (fold change > 2 and P < 0.05) in the samples from at least one stage of Coats' disease. Of the DEPs, 46 were found among all three stages of Coats' disease and the controls; therefore, they were considered Coats' disease-specific proteins (DCPs). A GO classification analysis indicated that the DCPs were closely related to structural molecule activity, cell adhesion molecule binding and receptor binding. Western blotting confirmed the expression levels of haptoglobin and apolipoprotein C-I were significantly up-regulated in Coats' disease.The 46 Coats' disease-specific proteins may provide additional insights into the mechanism of Coats' disease and represent potential biomarkers for identifying individuals with Coats' disease."
https://openalex.org/W2472677370,"Magnaporthe oryzae, the causative organism of rice blast, infects cereal crops and grasses at various stages of plant development. A comprehensive understanding of its metabolism and the implications on pathogenesis is necessary for countering this devastating crop disease. We present the role of the CorA magnesium transporters, MoAlr2 and MoMnr2, in development and pathogenicity of M. oryzae. The MoALR2 and MoMNR2 genes individually complement the Mg2+ uptake defects of a S. cerevisiae CorA transporter double mutant. MoALR2 and MoMNR2 respond to extracellular Mg2+ and Ca2+ levels and their expression is elevated under Mg2+ scarce conditions. RNA silencing mediated knockdown of MoALR2 (WT+siALR2, Δmnr2+siALR2 and ALR2+MNR2 simultaneous silencing) drastically alters intracellular cation concentrations and sensitivity to metal ions. MoALR2 silencing is detrimental to vegetative growth and surface hydrophobicity of mycelia, and the transformants display loss of cell wall integrity. MoALR2 is required for conidiogenesis and appressorium development, and is essential for infection. Investigation of knockdown transformants reveal low cAMP levels and altered expression of genes encoding proteins involved in MoMps1 cell wall integrity and cAMP MoPmk1 driven MAP Kinase signaling pathways. In contrast to MoALR2 knockdowns, the MoMNR2 deletion (Δmnr2) shows increased sensitivity to CorA inhibitors as well as altered cation sensitivity, but has limited effect on surface hydrophobicity and severity of plant infection. Interestingly, MoALR2 expression is elevated in Δmnr2. Impairment of development and infectivity of knockdown transformants and altered intracellular cation composition suggest that CorA transporters are essential for Mg2+ homeostasis within the cell, and are crucial to maintaining normal gene expression associated with cell structure, signal transduction and surface hydrophobicity in M. oryzae. We suggest that CorA transporters, and especially MoALR2, constitute an attractive target for the development of antifungal agents against this pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2473893619,"Postnatal blockade of the activin type IIB receptor (ActRIIB) represents a promising therapeutic strategy for counteracting dystrophic muscle wasting. However, its impact on muscle function and bioenergetics remains poorly documented in physiologic conditions. We have investigated totally noninvasively the effect of 8-wk administration of either soluble ActRIIB signaling inhibitor (sActRIIB-Fc) or vehicle PBS (control) on gastrocnemius muscle force-generating capacity, energy metabolism, and anatomy in dystrophic mdx mice using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and dynamic [31P]-MR spectroscopy ([31P]-MRS) in vivo. ActRIIB inhibition increased muscle volume (+33%) without changing fiber-type distribution, and increased basal animal oxygen consumption (+22%) and energy expenditure (+23%). During an in vivo standardized fatiguing exercise, maximum and total absolute contractile forces were larger (+40 and 24%, respectively) in sActRIIB-Fc treated animals, whereas specific force-generating capacity and fatigue resistance remained unaffected. Furthermore, sActRIIB-Fc administration did not alter metabolic fluxes, ATP homeostasis, or contractile efficiency during the fatiguing bout of exercise, although it dramatically reduced the intrinsic mitochondrial capacity for producing ATP. Overall, sActRIIB-Fc treatment increased muscle mass and strength without altering the fundamental weakness characteristic of dystrophic mdx muscle. These data support the clinical interest of ActRIIB blockade for reversing dystrophic muscle wasting..—Béchir, N., Pecchi, E., Vilmen, C., Le Fur, Y., Amthor, H., Bernard, M., Bendahan, D., Giannesini, B.

https://openalex.org/W2463331394,"Fishes use multimodal signals during both inter- and intra-sexual displays to convey information about their sex, reproductive state, and social status. These complex behavioral displays can include visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, and hydrodynamic signals, and the relative role of each sensory channel in these complex multi-sensory interactions is a common focus of neuroethology. The mechanosensory lateral line system of fishes detects near-body water movements and is implicated in a variety of behaviors including schooling, rheotaxis, social communication, and prey detection. Cobalt chloride is commonly used to chemically ablate lateral line neuromasts, thereby eliminating water-movement cues to test for mechanosensory-mediated behavioral functions. However, cobalt acts as a nonspecific calcium channel antagonist and could potentially disrupt function of all superficially located sensory receptor cells, including those for chemosensing. Here, we examined whether CoCl2 treatment used to ablate the lateral line system also impairs olfaction in three freshwater fishes, the African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni, goldfish Carassius auratus, and the Mexican blind cavefish Astyanax mexicanus. To examine the impact of CoCl2 on the activity of peripheral receptors, we quantified DASPEI fluorescence intensity of the olfactory epithelium from fish exposed to control and CoCl2 solutions. In addition, we examined brain activation in olfactory processing regions of A. burtoni immersed in either control or cobalt solutions. All three species exposed to CoCl2 had decreased DASPEI staining of the olfactory epithelium, and in A. burtoni, cobalt treatment caused reduced neural activation in olfactory processing regions of the brain. To our knowledge this is the first empirical evidence demonstrating that the same CoCl2 treatment used to ablate the lateral line system also impairs olfactory function. These data have important implications for the use of CoCl2 in future research and suggest that previous studies using CoCl2 should be reinterpreted in the context of both impaired mechanoreception and olfaction."
https://openalex.org/W2466659589,"Long term synaptic plasticity, such as long term potentiation (LTP), has been widely accepted as a cellular mechanism underlying memory. Recently, it has been unraveled that Shp2 plays a role in synaptic plasticity and memory in Drosophila and mice, revealing significant and conserved effects of Shp2 in cognitive function. However, the exact mechanism underlying this function of Shp2 in synaptic plasticity and memory still remains elusive. Here, we examine the regulation of Shp2 in hippocampal LTP and contextual fear conditioning. We find that Shp2 is rapidly recruited into spines after LTP induction. Furthermore, the phosphorylation level of Shp2 at Tyr-542 is elevated after LTP stimuli either in cultured hippocampal neurons or acute slices. Notably, contextual fear conditioning also regulates the phosphorylation level of Shp2 at Tyr-542, suggesting fine-tuned regulation of Shp2 in LTP and memory formation. By using a Shp2-specific inhibitor and adeno-associated virus-Cre mediated Shp2 knock-out in cultured neurons, we provide evidence that the phosphatase activity of Shp2 is critical for activity-dependent AMPA receptor surface trafficking.

https://openalex.org/W2467595749,"Background Severe sepsis is a potentially deadly illness and always requires intensive care. Do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders remain a debated issue in critical care and limited data exist about its impact on care of septic patients, particularly in East Asia. We sought to assess outcome of severe sepsis patients with regard to DNR status in Taiwan. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted in intensive care units (ICUs) between 2008 and 2010. All severe sepsis patients were included for analysis. Primary outcome was association between DNR orders and ICU mortality. Volume of interventions was used as proxy indicator to indicate aggressiveness of care. Results Sixty-seven (9.4%) of 712 patients had DNR orders on ICU admission, and these patients were older and had higher disease severity compared with patients without DNR orders. Notably, DNR patients experienced high ICU mortality (90%). Multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of DNR orders was independently associated with ICU mortality (odds ratio: 6.13; 95% confidence interval: 2.66–14.10). In propensity score-matched cohort, ICU mortality rate (91%) in the DNR group was statistically higher than that (62%) in the non-DNR group (p <0.001). Regarding ICU interventions, arterial and central venous catheterization were more commonly used in DNR patients than in non-DNR patients. Conclusions From the Asian perspective, septic patients placed on DNR orders on ICU admission had exceptionally high mortality. In contrast to Western reports, DNR patients received more ICU interventions, reflecting more aggressive approach to dealing with this patient population. The findings in some ways reflect differences between East and West cultures and suggest that DNR status is an important confounder in ICU studies involving severely septic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2462556099,"Background The cardiovascular consequences of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) differ by sex. We hypothesized that sex influences the severity of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with OSA. OSA was defined as an apnoea–hypopnoea index (AHI)>15 events·h-1. We evaluated the severity of ACS according to the ejection fraction, Killip class, number of diseased vessels, number of stents implanted and plasma peak troponin level. Methods We included 663 men (mean±SD, AHI 37±18 events·h-1) and 133 women (AHI 35±18 events·h-1) with OSA. Results The men were younger than the women (59±11 versus 66±11 years, p<0.0001), exhibited a higher neck circumference (p<0.0001), and were more likely to be smokers and alcohol users than women (p<0.0001, p = 0.0005, respectively). Body mass index and percentage of hypertensive patients or diabetics were similar between sexes. We observed a slight tendency for a higher Killip classification in women, although it was not statistically significant (p = 0.055). For men, we observed that the number of diseased vessels and the number of stents implanted were higher (p = 0.02, p = 0.001, respectively), and a decrease in the ejection fraction (p = 0.002). Conclusions This study shows that sex in OSA influences the severity of ACS. Men show a lower ejection fraction and an increased number of diseased vessels and number of stents implanted."
https://openalex.org/W2467799297,"This study was designed to improve the explanation for the behavior of the phenomenon of technology convergence. The concepts and measurements of diversity and persistence, as inherent attributes of the phenomenon, were elaborated by reviewing different theories. Diversity was examined by analyzing the degree of capability to absorb heterogeneous technologies, while persistence was investigated by analyzing the degree of continuity in the usage of cumulated technologies. With these two dimensions, an analytic framework was proposed to compare the differences and dynamic patterns of convergence competence by countries at the technology sector level. Three major technology sectors in the United States and South Korea, namely, information and communication technology, biotechnology, and nanotechnology, were explored to explicitly illustrate the differences in technology convergence competence. The results show that although Korea has narrowed the differences of capabilities for technology convergence compared to the US, Korea not only has to continuously pursue the improvement of specialization for all three sectors, but also has to encourage the exploitation of different technology fields. The suggested framework and indicators allow for monitoring of the dynamic patterns of a technology sector and identifying the sources of the gaps. Thus, the framework and indicators are able to ensure the purpose of government innovation policy and to provide strategic directions for redistributing the proper combination of sources to accomplish technology convergence."

Skin biopsies from nine controls (unaffected) and nine OI patients were imaged to generate maps of five separate MR parameters, T1, T2, km, MTR and ADC. Parameter values were calculated over the dermal region and used for univariate and multiparametric classification analysis. A substantial degree of overlap of individual MR parameters was observed between control and OI groups, which limited the sensitivity and specificity of univariate classification. Classification accuracies ranging between 39% and 67% were found depending on the variable of investigation, with T2 yielding the best accuracy of 67%. When several MR parameters were considered simultaneously in a multivariate analysis, the classification accuracies improved up to 89% for specific combinations, including the combination of T2 and km. These results indicate that multiparametric classification by quantitative MRI is able to detect differences between the skin of OI patients and of unaffected individuals, which motivates further study of quantitative MRI for the clinical diagnosis of OI."

SSB binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) rapidly and with very high affinity making it a useful molecular tool to detect free ssDNA in solution. We have labeled SSB from Plasmodium falciparum (Pf-SSB) with the MDCC (7-diethylamino-3-((((2-maleimidyl)ethyl)amino)-carbonyl)coumarin) fluorophore which yields a four-fold increase in fluorescence upon binding to ssDNA. Pf-SSBMDCC binding to DNA is unaffected by NaCl or Mg2+ concentration and does not display salt-dependent changes in DNA binding modes or cooperative binding on long DNA substrates. These features are unique to Pf-SSB, making it an ideal tool to probe the presence of free ssDNA in any biochemical reaction. Using this Pf-SSBMDCC probe as a sensor for free ssDNA, we have investigated the clearing of preformed yeast Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments by the Srs2 helicase during HR. Our studies provide a rate for the disassembly of the Rad51 filament by full length Srs2 on long ssDNA substrates. Mutations in the conserved 2B domain in the homologous bacterial UvrD, Rep and PcrA helicases show an enhancement of DNA unwinding activity, but similar mutations in Srs2 do not affect its DNA unwinding or Rad51 clearing properties.

https://openalex.org/W2417291868,"Representation based classification methods, such as Sparse Representation Classification (SRC) and Linear Regression Classification (LRC) have been developed for face recognition problem successfully. However, most of these methods use the original face images without any preprocessing for recognition. Thus, their performances may be affected by some problematic factors (such as illumination and expression variances) in the face images. In order to overcome this limitation, a novel supervised filter learning algorithm is proposed for representation based face recognition in this paper. The underlying idea of our algorithm is to learn a filter so that the within-class representation residuals of the faces' Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features are minimized and the between-class representation residuals of the faces' LBP features are maximized. Therefore, the LBP features of filtered face images are more discriminative for representation based classifiers. Furthermore, we also extend our algorithm for heterogeneous face recognition problem. Extensive experiments are carried out on five databases and the experimental results verify the efficacy of the proposed algorithm."

To solve these problems, the use of mobile cloud computing assisted by cloud data centers has been proposed. However, cloud data centers are always very far from the mobile requesters. In this paper, we propose an improved multi-objective local mobile cloud model: Compounded Local Mobile Cloud Architecture with Dynamic Priority Queues (LMCpri). This new architecture could briefly store jobs that arrive simultaneously at the cloudlet in different priority positions according to the result of auction processing, and then execute partitioning tasks on capable helpers. In the Scheduling Module, NSGA-II is employed as the scheduling algorithm to shorten processing time and decrease requester cost relative to PSO and sequential scheduling. The simulation results show that the number of iteration times that is defined to 30 is the best choice of the system. In addition, comparing with LMCque, LMCpri is able to effectively accommodate a requester who would like his job to be executed in advance and shorten execution time. Finally, we make a comparing experiment between LMCpri and cloud assisting architecture, and the results reveal that LMCpri presents a better performance advantage than cloud assisting architecture."
