https://openalex.org/W3201962062,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection produces B cell responses that continue to evolve for at least a year. During that time, memory B cells express increasingly broad and potent antibodies that are resistant to mutations found in variants of concern1. As a result, vaccination of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent individuals with currently available mRNA vaccines produces high levels of plasma neutralizing activity against all variants tested1,2. Here we examine memory B cell evolution five months after vaccination with either Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) mRNA vaccine in a cohort of SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals. Between prime and boost, memory B cells produce antibodies that evolve increased neutralizing activity, but there is no further increase in potency or breadth thereafter. Instead, memory B cells that emerge five months after vaccination of naive individuals express antibodies that are similar to those that dominate the initial response. While individual memory antibodies selected over time by natural infection have greater potency and breadth than antibodies elicited by vaccination, the overall neutralizing potency of plasma is greater following vaccination. These results suggest that boosting vaccinated individuals with currently available mRNA vaccines will increase plasma neutralizing activity but may not produce antibodies with equivalent breadth to those obtained by vaccinating convalescent individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3203405076,"Abstract Transposition has a key role in reshaping genomes of all living organisms 1 . Insertion sequences of IS200/IS605 and IS607 families 2 are among the simplest mobile genetic elements and contain only the genes that are required for their transposition and its regulation. These elements encode tnpA transposase, which is essential for mobilization, and often carry an accessory tnpB gene, which is dispensable for transposition. Although the role of TnpA in transposon mobilization of IS200/IS605 is well documented, the function of TnpB has remained largely unknown. It had been suggested that TnpB has a role in the regulation of transposition, although no mechanism for this has been established 3–5 . A bioinformatic analysis indicated that TnpB might be a predecessor of the CRISPR–Cas9/Cas12 nucleases 6–8 . However, no biochemical activities have been ascribed to TnpB. Here we show that TnpB of Deinococcus radiodurans ISDra2 is an RNA-directed nuclease that is guided by an RNA, derived from the right-end element of a transposon, to cleave DNA next to the 5′-TTGAT transposon-associated motif. We also show that TnpB could be reprogrammed to cleave DNA target sites in human cells. Together, this study expands our understanding of transposition mechanisms by highlighting the role of TnpB in transposition, experimentally confirms that TnpB is a functional progenitor of CRISPR–Cas nucleases and establishes TnpB as a prototype of a new system for genome editing."
https://openalex.org/W3203570622,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a chronic liver disease without an approved therapy, is associated with lipotoxicity and insulin resistance and is a major cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Aramchol, a partial inhibitor of hepatic stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) improved steatohepatitis and fibrosis in rodents and reduced steatosis in an early clinical trial. ARREST, a 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial randomized 247 patients with NASH (n = 101, n = 98 and n = 48 in the Aramchol 400 mg, 600 mg and placebo arms, respectively; NCT02279524 ). The primary end point was a decrease in hepatic triglycerides by magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 52 weeks with a dose of 600 mg of Aramchol. Key secondary end points included liver histology and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Aramchol 600 mg produced a placebo-corrected decrease in liver triglycerides without meeting the prespecified significance (-3.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.4 to 0.2, P = 0.066), precluding further formal statistical analysis. NASH resolution without worsening fibrosis was achieved in 16.7% (13 out of 78) of Aramchol 600 mg versus 5% (2 out of 40) of the placebo arm (odds ratio (OR) = 4.74, 95% CI = 0.99 to 22.7) and fibrosis improvement by ≥1 stage without worsening NASH in 29.5% versus 17.5% (OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 0.7 to 5.0), respectively. The placebo-corrected decrease in ALT for 600 mg was -29.1 IU l-1 (95% CI = -41.6 to -16.5). Early termination due to adverse events (AEs) was <5%, and Aramchol 600 and 400 mg were safe, well tolerated and without imbalance in serious or severe AEs between arms. Although the primary end point of a reduction in liver fat did not meet the prespecified significance level with Aramchol 600 mg, the observed safety and changes in liver histology and enzymes provide a rationale for SCD1 modulation as a promising therapy for NASH and fibrosis and are being evaluated in an ongoing phase 3 program."
https://openalex.org/W3203763528,"Germline SAMD9 and SAMD9L mutations (SAMD9/9Lmut) predispose to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with propensity for somatic rescue. In this study, we investigated a clinically annotated pediatric MDS cohort (n = 669) to define the prevalence, genetic landscape, phenotype, therapy outcome and clonal architecture of SAMD9/9L syndromes. In consecutively diagnosed MDS, germline SAMD9/9Lmut accounted for 8% and were mutually exclusive with GATA2 mutations present in 7% of the cohort. Among SAMD9/9Lmut cases, refractory cytopenia was the most prevalent MDS subtype (90%); acquired monosomy 7 was present in 38%; constitutional abnormalities were noted in 57%; and immune dysfunction was present in 28%. The clinical outcome was independent of germline mutations. In total, 67 patients had 58 distinct germline SAMD9/9Lmut clustering to protein middle regions. Despite inconclusive in silico prediction, 94% of SAMD9/9Lmut suppressed HEK293 cell growth, and mutations expressed in CD34+ cells induced overt cell death. Furthermore, we found that 61% of SAMD9/9Lmut patients underwent somatic genetic rescue (SGR) resulting in clonal hematopoiesis, of which 95% was maladaptive (monosomy 7 ± cancer mutations), and 51% had adaptive nature (revertant UPD7q, somatic SAMD9/9Lmut). Finally, bone marrow single-cell DNA sequencing revealed multiple competing SGR events in individual patients. Our findings demonstrate that SGR is common in SAMD9/9Lmut MDS and exemplify the exceptional plasticity of hematopoiesis in children."
https://openalex.org/W3201855617,"Background Telework has been widely discussed in several fields; however, there is a lack of research on the health aspects of teleworking. The current study was conducted to determine the health effects of teleworking during an emergency statement as evidence for future policy development. Method This was a cross-sectional study in which we administered an online questionnaire to 5,214 general workers (response rate = 36.4%) from June 2020 to August 2020. Based on working methods during the pandemic, workers were categorized into the office group (n = 86) and telework group (n = 1597), and we characterized their demographics, changes in lifestyle, telework status, physical symptoms, and mental health. Results The results showed that the workers’ residence, marital status, management positions, and employee status affected the choice of the work method. During the emergency, teleworkers experienced more changes in their habits than office workers. In terms of exercise habits, 67.0% of the individuals belonging to the office-telework (OT) group exercised less. Approximately half of the teleworkers were satisfied with their telework, and those in the OT group were less satisfied with their telework than those in the telework-telework (TT) group, and they reported an increase in both working hours and meeting hours. Work-family conflict was more pronounced in the TT group than in the two other groups. Only 13.2% of individuals did not experience any stress in the past 30 days, and all three groups showed varying degrees of anxiety and depressive tendencies. In addition, all teleworkers experienced adverse physical symptoms before and after the emergency. Conclusion Health issues associated with teleworking should be given adequate attention."
https://openalex.org/W3204510954,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-specific broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are currently under development to treat and prevent HIV-1 infection. We performed a single-center, randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation, placebo-controlled trial of a single administration of the HIV-1 V3-glycan-specific antibody PGT121 at 3, 10 and 30 mg kg-1 in HIV-uninfected adults and HIV-infected adults on antiretroviral therapy (ART), as well as a multicenter, open-label trial of one infusion of PGT121 at 30 mg kg-1 in viremic HIV-infected adults not on ART (no. NCT02960581). The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and antiviral activity in viremic HIV-infected adults not on ART. The secondary endpoints were changes in anti-PGT121 antibody titers and CD4+ T-cell count, and development of HIV-1 sequence variations associated with PGT121 resistance. Among 48 participants enrolled, no treatment-related serious adverse events, potential immune-mediated diseases or Grade 3 or higher adverse events were reported. The most common reactions among PGT121 recipients were intravenous/injection site tenderness, pain and headache. Absolute and relative CD4+ T-cell counts did not change following PGT121 infusion in HIV-infected participants. Neutralizing anti-drug antibodies were not elicited. PGT121 reduced plasma HIV RNA levels by a median of 1.77 log in viremic participants, with a viral load nadir at a median of 8.5 days. Two individuals with low baseline viral loads experienced ART-free viral suppression for ≥168 days following antibody infusion, and rebound viruses in these individuals demonstrated full or partial PGT121 sensitivity. The trial met the prespecified endpoints. These data suggest that further investigation of the potential of antibody-based therapeutic strategies for long-term suppression of HIV is warranted, including in individuals off ART and with low viral load."
https://openalex.org/W3202921434,"In this work we study the characteristics of heart rate variability (HRV) as a function of age and gender. Our analysis covers a wider age range than that studied so far. It includes results previously reported in the literature and reveals behaviours not reported before. We can establish basic scale relationships in different HRV measurements. The mean value of the RR intervals shows a power-law behaviour independent of gender. Magnitudes such as the standard deviation or pNN50 show abrupt changes at around the age of 12 years, and above that age they show gender dependence, which mainly affects short-time (or high frequency) scales. We present a unified analysis for the calculation of the non-linear α and β parameters. Both parameters depend on age; they increase in the extremes of life and reach a minimum at around one year of age. These gender-independent changes occur at low frequencies and in scale ranges that depend on age. The results obtained in this work are discussed in terms of the effects of basal metabolic rate, hormonal regulation, and neuronal activity on heart rate variability. This work finally discusses how these findings influence the interpretation of HRV measurements from records of different lengths."
https://openalex.org/W3202017886,"Lyme disease is on the rise. Caused by a spirochete Borreliella burgdorferi, it affects an estimated 500,000 people in the United States alone. The antibiotics currently used to treat Lyme disease are broad spectrum, damage the microbiome, and select for resistance in non-target bacteria. We therefore sought to identify a compound acting selectively against B. burgdorferi. A screen of soil micro-organisms revealed a compound highly selective against spirochetes, including B. burgdorferi. Unexpectedly, this compound was determined to be hygromycin A, a known antimicrobial produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus. Hygromycin A targets the ribosomes and is taken up by B. burgdorferi, explaining its selectivity. Hygromycin A cleared the B. burgdorferi infection in mice, including animals that ingested the compound in a bait, and was less disruptive to the fecal microbiome than clinically relevant antibiotics. This selective antibiotic holds the promise of providing a better therapeutic for Lyme disease and eradicating it in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W3202642825,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for tumor progression, recurrence, and drug resistance. To identify genetic vulnerabilities of colon cancer, we performed targeted CRISPR dropout screens comprising 657 Drugbank targets and 317 epigenetic regulators on two patient-derived colon CSC-enriched spheroids. Next-generation sequencing of pooled genomic DNAs isolated from surviving cells yielded therapeutic candidates. We unraveled 44 essential genes for colon CSC-enriched spheroids propagation, including key cholesterol biosynthetic genes (HMGCR, FDPS, and GGPS1). Cholesterol biosynthesis was induced in colon cancer tissues, especially CSC-enriched spheroids. The genetic and pharmacological inhibition of HMGCR/FDPS impaired self-renewal capacity and tumorigenic potential of the spheroid models in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, HMGCR or FDPS depletion impaired cancer stemness characteristics by activating TGF-β signaling, which in turn downregulated expression of inhibitors of differentiation (ID) proteins, key regulators of cancer stemness. Cholesterol and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) rescued the growth inhibitory and signaling effect of HMGCR/FDPS blockade, implying a direct role of these metabolites in modulating stemness. Finally, cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors and 5-FU demonstrated antitumor synergy in colon CSC-enriched spheroids, tumor organoids, and xenografts. Taken together, our study unravels novel genetic vulnerabilities of colon CSC-enriched spheroids and suggests cholesterol biosynthesis as a potential target in conjunction with traditional chemotherapy for colon cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3203554524,"Online messaging app Telegram has increased in popularity in recent years surpassing Twitter and Snapchat by the number of active monthly users in late 2020. The messenger has also been crucial to protest movements in several countries in 2019-2020, including Belarus, Russia and Hong Kong. Yet, to date only few studies examined online activities on Telegram and none have analyzed the platform with regard to the protest mobilization. In the present study, we address the existing gap by examining Telegram-based activities related to the 2019 protests in Hong Kong. With this paper we aim to provide an example of methodological tools that can be used to study protest mobilization and coordination on Telegram. We also contribute to the research on computational text analysis in Cantonese—one of the low-resource Asian languages,—as well as to the scholarship on Hong Kong protests and research on social media-based protest mobilization in general. For that, we rely on the data collected through Telegram’s API and a combination of network analysis and computational text analysis. We find that the Telegram-based network was cohesive ensuring efficient spread of protest-related information. Content spread through Telegram predominantly concerned discussions of future actions and protest-related on-site information (i.e., police presence in certain areas). We find that the Telegram network was dominated by different actors each month of the observation suggesting the absence of one single leader. Further, traditional protest leaders—those prominent during the 2014 Umbrella Movement,—such as media and civic organisations were less prominent in the network than local communities. Finally, we observe a cooldown in the level of Telegram activity after the enactment of the harsh National Security Law in July 2020. Further investigation is necessary to assess the persistence of this effect in a long-term perspective."
https://openalex.org/W3203693539,"The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC)-hippocampal network plays a key role in the processing, storage, and recall of spatial information. However, how the spatial code provided by MEC inputs relates to spatial representations generated by principal cell assemblies within hippocampal subfields remains enigmatic. To investigate this coding relationship, we employed two-photon calcium imaging in mice navigating through dissimilar virtual environments. Imaging large MEC bouton populations revealed spatially tuned activity patterns. MEC inputs drastically changed their preferred spatial field locations between environments, whereas hippocampal cells showed lower levels of place field reconfiguration. Decoding analysis indicated that higher place field reliability and larger context-dependent activity-rate differences allow low numbers of principal cells, particularly in the DG and CA1, to provide information about location and context more accurately and rapidly than MEC inputs. Thus, conversion of dynamic MEC inputs into stable spatial hippocampal maps may enable fast encoding and efficient recall of spatio-contextual information."
https://openalex.org/W3203947941,"Background Clinical features and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections diverge in different countries. The aim of this study was to describe clinical characteristics and outcomes in a cohort of patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 in Argentina. Methods Multicenter prospective cohort study of ≥18 years-old patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection consecutively admitted to 19 hospitals in Argentina. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify variables associated with 30-day mortality and admission to intensive care unit (ICU). Results A total of 809 patients were analyzed. Median age was 53 years, 56% were males and 71% had at least one comorbidity. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (32%), obesity (23%) and diabetes (17%). Disease severity at admission was classified as mild 25%, moderate 51%, severe 17%, and critical 7%. Almost half of patients (49%) required supplemental oxygen, 18% ICU, and 12% invasive ventilation. Overall, 30-day mortality was 11%. Factors independently associated with ICU admission were male gender (OR 1.81; 95%CI 1.16–2.81), hypertension (OR 3.21; 95%CI 2.08–4.95), obesity (OR 2.38; 95%CI 1.51–3.7), oxygen saturation ≤93% (OR 6.45; 95%CI 4.20–9.92) and lymphopenia (OR 3.21; 95%CI 2.08–4.95). Factors independently associated with 30-day mortality included age ≥60 years-old (OR 2.68; 95% CI 1.63–4.43), oxygen saturation ≤93% (OR 3.19; 95%CI 1.97–5.16) and lymphopenia (OR 2.65; 95%CI 1.64–4.27). Conclusions This cohort validates crucial clinical data on patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 in Argentina."
https://openalex.org/W3204048523,"The convergent evolution of the fly and mouse olfactory system led us to ask whether the anatomic connectivity and functional logic of olfactory circuits would evolve in artificial neural networks trained to perform olfactory tasks. Artificial networks trained to classify odor identity recapitulate the connectivity inherent in the olfactory system. Input units are driven by a single receptor type, and units driven by the same receptor converge to form a glomerulus. Glomeruli exhibit sparse, unstructured connectivity onto a larger expansion layer of Kenyon cells. When trained to both classify odor identity and to impart innate valence onto odors, the network develops independent pathways for identity and valence classification. Thus, the defining features of fly and mouse olfactory systems also evolved in artificial neural networks trained to perform olfactory tasks. This implies that convergent evolution reflects an underlying logic rather than shared developmental principles."
https://openalex.org/W3204310665,"Introduction Over the past two decades, there have been several global interventions including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), aimed at improving health outcomes. Despite efforts by countries to achieve the SDG targets, mental health challenges remain major public health concerns globally. We examined the prevalence and predictors of depression, anxiety, and stress as well as the comorbidities of these mental health issues among adults. Materials and methods This was a community-based cross-sectional study conducted among 2456 adults in four districts of the Volta Region of Ghana using data from the UHAS-Yonsei University Partnership Project. We analysed the data using frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, correlation, and binary logistic regression. Results Overall, 51.8% of the participants had at least one of the mental health issues examined. The prevalence of a mental health issue was 25.2%, 53.3%, and 9.7% for depression, anxiety, and stress respectively. Participants constituting 8.3% experienced all three mental health issues as comorbidities. Participants’ level of formal education and income significantly predicted depression, anxiety, and stress respectively at the multivariable level. Adults with a tertiary level of education were, for instance, 68% (AOR = 0.32, 95%CI = 0.15–0.66), 65% (AOR = 0.35, 95%CI = 0.17–0.73), and 50% (AOR = 0.50, 95%CI = 0.33–0.76) less likely to experience depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively compared with those who had no formal education. Conclusion The majority of our study participants either experienced depression, anxiety, or stress. There were quite high comorbidities of the mental health issues among the adult population. To accelerate progress towards the achievement of SDG 3.4 target of promoting mental health and wellbeing for all by the year 2030, there is a need for effective implementation of the country’s 2012 Mental Health Act which makes provisions for the establishment of a Mental Health Fund. This could improve the financial circumstances of indigenes as income has been realised in the present study as an important factor influencing depression, anxiety, and stress among the adult population."
https://openalex.org/W3201685658,"The ubiquitously expressed transcription factor interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is critical for the induction of antiviral genes, e.g., type-I IFN. In addition to its transcriptional function, IRF3 also activates a nontranscriptional, proapoptotic signaling pathway. While the proapoptotic function of IRF3 protects against viral infections, it is also involved in harmful immune responses that trigger hepatocyte cell death and promote liver disease. Thus, we hypothesized that a small-molecule inhibitor of the proapoptotic activity of IRF3 could alleviate fatty-acid-induced hepatocyte cell death. We conducted a high-throughput screen, which identified auranofin as a small-molecule inhibitor of the proapoptotic activity of IRF3. In addition to the nontranscriptional apoptotic pathway, auranofin also inhibited the transcriptional activity of IRF3. Using biochemical and genetic tools in human and mouse cells, we uncovered a novel mechanism of action for auranofin, in which it induces cellular autophagy to degrade IRF3 protein, thereby suppressing IRF3 functions. Autophagy-deficient cells were unable to degrade IRF3 upon auranofin treatment, suggesting that the autophagic degradation of IRF3 is a novel approach to regulate IRF3 activities. Using a physiologically relevant in vitro model, we demonstrated that auranofin inhibited fatty-acid-induced apoptotic cell death of hepatocytes. In summary, auranofin is a novel inhibitor of IRF3 functions and may represent a potential therapeutic option in diseases where IRF3 is deleterious."
https://openalex.org/W3202755075,"Agricultural index insurance contracts increasingly use remote sensing data to estimate losses and determine indemnity payouts. Index insurance contracts inevitably make errors, failing to detect losses that occur and issuing payments when no losses occur. The quality of these contracts and the indices on which they are based, need to be evaluated to assess their fitness as insurance, and to provide a guide to choosing the index that best protects the insured. In the remote sensing literature, indices are often evaluated with generic model evaluation statistics such as R 2 or Root Mean Square Error that do not directly consider the effect of errors on the quality of the insurance contract. Economic analysis suggests using measures that capture the impact of insurance on the expected economic well-being of the insured. To bridge the gap between the remote sensing and economic perspectives, we adopt a standard economic measure of expected well-being and transform it into a Relative Insurance Benefit ( RIB ) metric. RIB expresses the welfare benefits derived from an index insurance contract relative to a hypothetical contract that perfectly measures losses. RIB takes on its maximal value of one when the index contract offers the same economic benefits as the perfect contract. When it achieves none of the benefits of insurance it takes on a value of zero, and becomes negative if the contract leaves the insured worse off than having no insurance. Part of our contribution is to decompose this economic well-being measure into an asymmetric loss function. We also argue that the expected well-being measure we use has advantages over other economic measures for the normative purpose of insurance quality ascertainment. Finally, we illustrate the use of the RIB measure with a case study of potential livestock insurance contracts in Northern Kenya. We compared 24 indices that were made with 4 different statistical models and 3 remote sensing data sources. RIB for these indices ranged from 0.09 to 0.5, and R 2 ranged from 0.2 to 0.51. While RIB and R 2 were correlated, the model with the highest RIB did not have the highest R 2 . Our findings suggest that, when designing and evaluating an index insurance program, it is useful to separately consider the quality of a remote sensing-based index with a metric like the RIB instead of a generic goodness-of-fit metric."
https://openalex.org/W3203085757,"Ecological Niche Modeling is a process by which spatiotemporal, climatic, and environmental data are analyzed to predict the distribution of an organism. Using this process, an ensemble ecological niche model for West Nile virus habitat prediction in the state of Florida was developed. This model was created through the weighted averaging of three separate machine learning models-boosted regression tree, random forest, and maximum entropy-developed for this study using sentinel chicken surveillance and remote sensing data. Variable importance differed among the models. The highest variable permutation value included mean dewpoint temperature for the boosted regression tree model, mean temperature for the random forest model, and wetlands focal statistics for the maximum entropy mode. Model validation resulted in area under the receiver curve predictive values ranging from good [0.8728 (95% CI 0.8422-0.8986)] for the maximum entropy model to excellent [0.9996 (95% CI 0.9988-1.0000)] for random forest model, with the ensemble model predictive value also in the excellent range [0.9939 (95% CI 0.9800-0.9979]. This model should allow mosquito control districts to optimize West Nile virus surveillance, improving detection and allowing for a faster, targeted response to reduce West Nile virus transmission potential."
https://openalex.org/W3204225509,"Unique among metazoan repressive histone methyltransferases, G9a and GLP, which chiefly target histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9), require dimerization for productive H3K9 mono (me1)- and dimethylation (me2) in vivo. Intriguingly, even though each enzyme can independently methylate H3K9, the predominant active form in vivo is a heterodimer of G9a and GLP. How dimerization influences the central H3K9 methyl binding (""reading"") and deposition (""writing"") activity of G9a and GLP and why heterodimerization is essential in vivo remains opaque. Here, we examine the H3K9me ""reading"" and ""writing"" activities of defined, recombinantly produced homo- and heterodimers of G9a and GLP. We find that both reading and writing are significantly enhanced in the heterodimer. Compared with the homodimers, the heterodimer has higher recognition of H3K9me2, and a striking ∼10-fold increased turnover rate for nucleosomal substrates under multiple turnover conditions, which is not evident on histone tail peptide substrates. Cross-linking Mass Spectrometry suggests that differences between the homodimers and the unique activity of the heterodimer may be encoded in altered ground state conformations, as each dimer displays different domain contacts. Our results indicate that heterodimerization may be required to relieve autoinhibition of H3K9me reading and chromatin methylation evident in G9a and GLP homodimers. Relieving this inhibition may be particularly important in early differentiation when large tracts of H3K9me2 are typically deposited by G9a-GLP, which may require a more active form of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W3202864521,"As global climate change progresses, wildlife management will benefit from knowledge of demographic responses to climatic variation, particularly for species already endangered by other stressors. In Canada, climate change is expected to increasingly impact populations of threatened woodland caribou ( Rangifer tarandus caribou ) and much focus has been placed on how a warming climate has potentially facilitated the northward expansion of apparent competitors and novel predators. Climate change, however, may also exert more direct effects on caribou populations that are not mediated by predation. These effects include meteorological changes that influence resource availability and energy expenditure. Research on other ungulates suggests that climatic variation may have minimal impact on low-density populations such as woodland caribou because per-capita resources may remain sufficient even in “bad” years. We evaluated this prediction using demographic data from 21 populations in western Canada that were monitored for various intervals between 1994 and 2015. We specifically assessed whether juvenile recruitment and adult female survival were correlated with annual variation in meteorological metrics and plant phenology. Against expectations, we found that both vital rates appeared to be influenced by annual climatic variation. Juvenile recruitment was primarily correlated with variation in phenological conditions in the year prior to birth. Adult female survival was more strongly correlated with meteorological conditions and declined during colder, more variable winters. These responses may be influenced by the life history of woodland caribou, which reside in low-productivity refugia where small climatic changes may result in changes to resources that are sufficient to elicit strong demographic effects. Across all models, explained variation in vital rates was low, suggesting that other factors had greater influence on caribou demography. Nonetheless, given the declining trajectories of many woodland caribou populations, our results highlight the increased relevance of recovery actions when adverse climatic conditions are likely to negatively affect caribou demography."
https://openalex.org/W3204807700,"Humans are constantly exposed to a rich tapestry of visual information in a potentially changing environment. To cope with the computational burden this engenders, our perceptual system must use prior context to simultaneously prioritise stimuli of importance and suppress irrelevant surroundings. This study investigated the influence of prediction and attention in visual perception by investigating event-related potentials (ERPs) often associated with these processes, N170 and N2pc for prediction and attention, respectively. A contextual trajectory paradigm was used which violated visual predictions and neglected to predetermine areas of spatial interest, to account for the potentially unpredictable nature of a real-life visual scene. Participants ( N = 36) viewed a visual display of cued and non-cued shapes rotating in a five-step predictable trajectory, with the fifth and final position of either the cued or non-cued shape occurring in a predictable or unpredictable spatial location. To investigate the predictive coding theory of attention we used factors of attention and prediction, whereby attention was manipulated as either cued or non-cued conditions, and prediction manipulated in either predictable or unpredictable conditions. Results showed both enhanced N170 and N2pc amplitudes to unpredictable compared to predictable stimuli. Stimulus cueing status also increased N170 amplitude, but this did not interact with stimulus predictability. The N2pc amplitude was not affected by stimulus cueing status. In accordance with previous research these results suggest the N170 is in part a visual prediction error response with respect to higher-level visual processes, and furthermore the N2pc may index attention reorientation. The results demonstrate prior context influences the sensitivity of the N170 and N2pc electrophysiological responses. These findings add further support to the role of N170 as a prediction error signal and suggest that the N2pc may reflect attentional reorientation in response to unpredicted stimulus locations."
https://openalex.org/W3201699378,"The objective of the paper is to diagnose organisational culture of selected universities and analyse its impact on the innovation processes within them. The subject matter of the study was organisational culture and innovation at universities. The subjects were four selected universities in Poland, Austria, Germany, and Ukraine. The paper provided a definition of organisational culture and its typology. It further discussed the organisational culture of universities and the relationships between organisational culture and innovativeness. The literature review provided foundations for building a model for the formation of a type of organisational culture at universities that is innovation-friendly, which is the added value of the paper. It offers actions worth taking to shape innovation-friendly culture at universities. It is particularly important during difficult time of changing labour market, when universities greatly impact the attitudes of young people. The knowledge of how to shape innovation-friendly organisational culture at universities is necessary for academia to profile future employees in times of continuous changes. To investigate the relationship between organisational culture and the innovativeness of universities, we designed an original survey questionnaire [S1 File]. Organisational culture was diagnosed with the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument by K.S. Cameron and R.E. Quinn. The analyses were conducted in Dell Statistica v. 13.1 (StatSoft Polska). We normalised data from the Likert rating scale using Kaufman’s and Rousseeuw’s formula. We used Spearman’s correlation coefficient and Kendall’s W to calculate correlations. The research shows that the investigated Polish and Austrian universities are dominated by hierarchy and market cultures. On the other hand, the German and Ukrainian universities host all cultures, but clan and adhocracy dominate there. Moreover, the analyses demonstrated that although the adhocracy culture was the least visible in the investigated organisations, it contributes to university innovativeness the most. The conclusions were used to build a model for promoting innovation-friendly organisational culture at universities. The model contains answers to the research questions. In addition, it offers guidelines for shaping organisational culture to bolster innovation at universities. The research identified relationships between organisational culture and university innovativeness and components that create innovation opportunities at universities as its contribution to management theory. When applied in practice, the guidelines can help form the university’s organisational culture bottom-up."
https://openalex.org/W3202259777,"The global impact of dementia is a key healthcare priority, and although it is possible to live well with dementia, public perception is often negative. Serious digital games are becoming a credible delivery method to educate/train individuals in the business and health sectors and to challenge perceptions. The main objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a digital game prototype on individual attitudes towards dementia. A digital game to improve public knowledge and understanding about dementia ( www.dementiagame.com ) was co-designed with people living with dementia and student nurses. The Game was evaluated using a pretest-posttest design. Participants for the evaluation were recruited via social media in one UK university and completed the Approaches to Dementia Questionnaire (ADQ) before and after playing the game. Overall, 457 individuals completed both pre and post test questionnaires. The total ADQ score demonstrated a significant improvement in positive attitudes (p &lt; 0.001), and both subscales of Hope and Recognition of Personhood also saw significant improvements (p &lt; 0.001). The use of a serious digital game has demonstrated a significant effect on the respondents’ perceptions of dementia. Overall, there was a more positive view of the abilities of people with dementia and what their capabilities were. They were also more likely to be recognised as unique individuals with the same values as any other person. The benefit of using digital gaming to improve perceptions of dementia has been demonstrated, nonetheless further research is required to reach a more diverse population and test as a Randomised Control Trial to provide definitive evidence for use in policy and practice."
https://openalex.org/W3204161642,"Previous studies suggested that cancer cells resemble neural stem/progenitor cells in regulatory network, tumorigenicity, and differentiation potential, and that neural stemness might represent the ground or basal state of differentiation and tumorigenicity. The neural ground state is reflected in the upregulation and enrichment of basic cell machineries and developmental programs, such as cell cycle, ribosomes, proteasomes, and epigenetic factors, in cancers and in embryonic neural or neural stem cells. However, how these machineries are concertedly regulated is unclear. Here, we show that loss of neural stemness in cancer or neural stem cells via muscle-like differentiation or neuronal differentiation, respectively, caused downregulation of ribosome and proteasome components and major epigenetic factors, including PRMT1, EZH2, and LSD1. Furthermore, inhibition of PRMT1, an oncoprotein that is enriched in neural cells during embryogenesis, caused neuronal-like differentiation, downregulation of a similar set of proteins downregulated by differentiation, and alteration of subcellular distribution of ribosome and proteasome components. By contrast, PRMT1 overexpression led to an upregulation of these proteins. PRMT1 interacted with these components and protected them from degradation via recruitment of the deubiquitinase USP7, also known to promote cancer and enriched in embryonic neural cells, thereby maintaining a high level of epigenetic factors that maintain neural stemness, such as EZH2 and LSD1. Taken together, our data indicate that PRMT1 inhibition resulted in repression of cell tumorigenicity. We conclude that PRMT1 coordinates ribosome and proteasome activity to match the needs for high production and homeostasis of proteins that maintain stemness in cancer and neural stem cells."

This was a cross-sectional study. The serological and epidemiological data of 1269 persons were assessed. Participants were selected randomly among primary health care center attendees in Palestine between November 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020. All serum samples were tested for total antibodies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. IgM, IgG, and IgA-specific antibody titers were measured using ELISA. The overall prevalence (with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) of SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies and specific antibodies were estimated. A multivariate regression model was used to assess the predictive factors for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. The overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 24·0% (95% CI, 21·7%-26·5%). Seroprevalence was significantly higher among people living in south West Bank (adjusted Odds ratio [aOR], 2·22; 95% CI: 1·58-3·11), people who had COVID-19 symptoms (aOR, 3·92; 95% CI, 2·83-5·43), people with a COVID-19 contact history (aOR, 1·44; 95% CI, 1·03-2·03), patients with hypertension (aOR, 1·57; 95% CI, 1·06-2·33), and non-smokers (aOR, 0·47; 95% CI, 0·31-0·72). A total of 171 blood samples from SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were chosen at random for additional serological testing. Specific IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies were positive in 14·0% (95% CI, 9·2%-20·2%), 88·3% (82·5%-92·7%), and 42·1% (34·6%-59·9%) of the samples, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were common among PHC center attendees and were significantly associated to sex, smoking, and COVID-19 contact history. However, considering that almost three-quarters of this population remains susceptible, maintaining public health measures and encouraging access to immunization is critical in protecting this population."
https://openalex.org/W3204026406,"Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes that protect the ends of eukaryotic linear chromosomes from degradation and fusions. Telomere dysfunction leads to cell growth arrest, oncogenesis, and premature aging. Telomeric RNAs have been found in all studied species; however, their functions and biogenesis are not clearly understood. We studied the mechanisms of development disorders observed upon overexpression of telomeric repeats in Drosophila . In somatic cells, overexpression of telomeric retrotransposon HeT-A is cytotoxic and leads to the accumulation of HeT-A Gag near centrosomes. We found that RNA and RNA-binding protein Gag encoded by the telomeric retrotransposon HeT-A interact with Polo and Cdk1 mitotic kinases, which are conserved regulators of centrosome biogenesis and cell cycle. The depletion of proteins Spindle E, Ccr4 or Ars2 resulting in HeT-A overexpression in the germline was accompanied by mislocalization of Polo as well as its abnormal stabilization during oogenesis and severe deregulation of centrosome biogenesis leading to maternal-effect embryonic lethality. These data suggest a mechanistic link between telomeric HeT-A ribonucleoproteins and cell cycle regulators that ensures the cell response to telomere dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3204203021,"Setting The organised, population-based breast cancer screening programme in Slovenia began providing biennial mammography screening for women aged 50–69 in 2008. The programme has taken a comprehensive approach to quality assurance as recommended by the European guidelines for quality assurance in breast cancer screening and diagnosis (4th edition), including centralized assessment, training and supervision, and proactive monitoring of performance indicators. This report describes the progress of implementation and rollout from 2003 through 2019. Methods The screening protocol and key quality assurance procedures initiated during the planning from 2003 and rollout from 2008 of the screening programme, including training of the professional staff, are described. The organisational structure, gradual geographical rollout, and coverage by invitation and examination are presented. Results The nationwide programme was up and running in all screening regions by the end of 2017, at which time the nationwide coverage by invitation and examination had reached 70% and 50%, respectively. Nationwide rollout of the population-based programme was complete by the end of 2019. By this time, coverage by invitation and examination had reached 98% and 76%, respectively. The participation rates consistently exceeded 70% from 2014 to 2019. Conclusions The successful implementation of the screening programme can be attributed to an independent central management, external guidance, and strict adherence to quality assurance procedures, all of which contributed to increasing governmental and popular support. The benefits of quality assurance have influenced all aspects of breast care and have provided a successful model for multidisciplinary management of other diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3202095040,"To reduce the problem of sedimentation in open channels, calculating flow velocity is critical. Undesirable operating costs arise due to sedimentation problems. To overcome these problems, the development of machine learning based models may provide reliable results. Recently, numerous studies have been conducted to model sediment transport in non-deposition condition however, the main deficiency of the existing studies is utilization of a limited range of data in model development. To tackle this drawback, six data sets with wide ranges of pipe size, volumetric sediment concentration, channel bed slope, sediment size and flow depth are used for the model development in this study. Moreover, two tree-based algorithms, namely M5 rule tree (M5RT) and M5 regression tree (M5RGT) are implemented, and results are compared to the traditional regression equations available in the literature. The results show that machine learning approaches outperform traditional regression models. The tree-based algorithms, M5RT and M5RGT, provided satisfactory results in contrast to their regression-based alternatives with RMSE = 1.184 and RMSE = 1.071, respectively. In order to recommend a practical solution, the tree structure algorithms are supplied to compute sediment transport in an open channel flow."
https://openalex.org/W3202342216,"Given the growing evidence that a range of lifestyle factors are involved in the etiology of depression, a ‘lifestyle medicine’ approach can be potentially safe and cost-effective to prevent or treat depression. To examine the effects and acceptability of a group-based, integrative lifestyle medicine intervention as a standalone treatment for managing depressive symptoms, a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in a Chinese adult population in 2018. Participants ( n = 31) with PHQ-9 score above the cut-off of ≥ 10, which was indicative of moderate to severe depression, were recruited from the general community in Hong Kong and randomly assigned to lifestyle medicine group (LM group) or care-as-usual group (CAU group) in a ratio of 1:1. Participants in the LM group received 2-hour group sessions once per week for six consecutive weeks, which covered diet, exercise, mindfulness, psychoeducation, and sleep management. Linear mixed-effects model analyses showed that the LM group had a significant reduction in PHQ-9 scores compared to the CAU group at immediate posttreatment and 12-week posttreatment follow-up ( d = 0.69 and 0.73, respectively). Moreover, there were significantly greater improvements in anxiety, stress, and insomnia symptoms (measured by DASS-21 and ISI) at all time points in the LM group ( d = 0.42–1.16). The results suggests that our 6-week group-based, integrative lifestyle intervention program is effective in lowering depressive, anxiety, stress, and insomnia symptoms in the Chinese population. Further studies in clinical populations with a larger sample size and longer follow-up are warranted."

https://openalex.org/W3202694531,"Objectives To determine the diagnostic potential of simultaneous presence of serum anti-SSA/Ro and upregulated salivary protein biomarkers in patients with primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS). Methods Previous proteomics data on the intensity of neutrophil elastase, calreticulin, tripartite motif containing protein 29 (TRIM29), clusterin and vitronectin provided basis for performing extended analysis. Protein data was obtained by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry technique in whole saliva from 24 patients with pSS and 16 patients having symptoms of pSS, but not fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology/European League against Rheumatism classification criteria (non-pSS). Serum anti-SSA/Ro antibody was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) value was calculated for combined biomarkers. Results Simultaneous presence of serum anti-SSA/Ro and upregulated salivary TRIM29 provided the most optimal combination with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.995 (95% CI 0.98–1.00, p = 2.0E-7 and standard error 0.007) and combinations of sensitivity and specificity within the interval of 91–100%. ROC analysis showed that salivary levels of TRIM29 alone enabled differentiation between pSS and non-pSS with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.88 (95%CI 0.77–1.00). All patients with pSS and 3 non-pSS patients were serum anti-SSA/Ro positive. Conclusions Simultaneous presence of serum anti-SSA/Ro and upregulated salivary TRIM29 provided a high diagnostic accuracy exceeding that of currently available tools used in pSS diagnostics. This biomarker combination represents a promising less invasive diagnostic tool for pSS. The clinical applicability of TRIM29 needs further testing in independent cohorts using relevant analytical techniques."
https://openalex.org/W3204231381,"It is necessary in agricultural consulting to take into account the current problems as well as economic and social challenges facing rural areas. Undoubtedly, sustainable economy and energy policy is such a problem in Poland, including the issue of access to energy from renewable sources and financial possibilities of meeting the electricity demand of households and agriculture. Therefore, advisory and information activities in the field of reducing energy poverty and improving air quality are important. The main purpose of the paper was to identify and assess the role of advisory entities in the process of counteracting energy poverty in rural areas in Poland. The basic research method was an expert (survey) study. Research shows that the subject of energy poverty is relatively rarely taken up by consulting institutions as part of training courses, especially issues related to saving electricity in the household/agricultural sector are marginalized; monitoring and analysis of energy consumption; selection of technical devices in terms of energy efficiency. Based on expert research, there were identified consultancy activities that are and may be important in the topic under study. Experts indicated co-financing of activities in the field of energy efficiency as the preferred way to fight energy poverty in agriculture and rural areas. The results may constitute an important direction in the development of consultancy, the basis for building priority programs, which in turn may affect the behaviour and actions of farmers and other inhabitants of rural areas in the context of energy transformation. The performed research may constitute the basis for further, in-depth analyses in other countries and on an international scale."

Disease development was recorded at periodic intervals for a month. In both experiments, Zorvec mixtures were significantly more effective in suppressing the disease than INF or MFX. They delayed the onset of the disease and its progress, regardless the genotype used for inoculation. Among the three Zorvec mixtures, ZZ was least effective and ZE most effective. Sensitivity monitoring assays revealed zero mutants of P . infestans resistant to oxathiapiprolin. The data confirmed good efficacy of Zorvec mixtures, especially ZE, in field-grown potato crops as evident by the very effective control of late blight for one month."
https://openalex.org/W3202290146,"The blink rate increases if a person indulges in a conversation compared to quiet rest. Since various factors were suggested to explain this increase, the present series of studies tested the influence of different motor activities, cognitive processes and auditory input on the blink behavior but at the same time minimized visual stimulation as well as social influences. Our results suggest that neither cognitive demands without verbalization, nor isolated lip, jaw or tongue movements, nor auditory input during vocalization or listening influence our blinking behavior. In three experiments, we provide evidence that complex facial movements during unvoiced speaking are the driving factors that increase blinking. If the complexity of the motor output increased such as during the verbalization of speech, the blink rate rose even more. Similarly, complex facial movements without cognitive demands, such as sucking on a lollipop, increased the blink rate. Such purely motor-related influences on blinking advise caution particularly when using blink rates assessed during patient interviews as a neurological indicator."
https://openalex.org/W3202542152,"The recognition of carbohydrates by lectins plays key roles in diverse cellular processes such as cellular adhesion, proliferation, and apoptosis, which makes it a therapeutic target of significance against cancers. One of the most functionally active lectins, galectin-3 is distinctively known for its specific binding affinity toward β-galactoside. However, despite the prevalence of high-resolution crystallographic structures, the mechanistic basis and more significantly, the dynamic process underlying carbohydrate recognition by galectin-3 are currently elusive. To this end, we employed extensive Molecular Dynamics simulations to unravel the complete binding event of human galectin-3 with its native natural ligand N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) at atomic precision. The simulation trajectory demonstrates that the oligosaccharide diffuses around the protein and eventually identifies and binds to the biologically designated binding site of galectin-3 in real time. The simulated bound pose correlates with the crystallographic pose with atomic-level accuracy and recapitulates the signature stabilizing galectin-3/oligosaccharide interactions. The recognition pathway also reveals a set of transient non-native ligand poses in its course to the receptor. Interestingly, kinetic analysis in combination with a residue-level picture revealed that the key to the efficacy of a more active structural variant of the LacNAc lay in the ligand's resilience against disassociation from galectin-3. By catching the ligand in the act of finding its target, our investigations elucidate the detailed recognition mechanism of the carbohydrate-binding domain of galectin-3 and underscore the importance of ligand-target binary complex residence time in understanding the structure-activity relationship of cognate ligands."

In the present study, we provide the first evidence for the influence of the smartphone on maternal physiological responses and her attention towards the infant during breastfeeding and face-to-face interactions. Twenty breastfeeding mothers and their infants participated in this lab study during which electrodermal activity, cardiograph impedance, and gaze patterns were monitored in breastfeeding and face-to-face interactions with three conditions manipulating the level of maternal smartphone involvement. We report that mothers’ gaze toward their infants decreased when breastfeeding while using the smartphone compared to face-to-face interaction. Further, we show that greater maternal electrodermal activity and cardiac output were related to longer maternal gaze fixation toward the smartphone during breastfeeding. Finally, results indicate that mothers’ smartphone addiction levels were negatively correlated with electrodermal activity during breastfeeding. This study provides an initial basis for much required further research that will explore the influence of smartphone use on maternal biobehavioral responses in this digital age and the consequences for infant cognitive, emotional, and social development."
https://openalex.org/W3202788281,"The aim of this study is to optimize the simulation result of the WOFOST model and explore the possibility of assimilating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery into this model. Field images of wheat during its key growth stages are acquired with a UAV, and the corresponding leaf area index (LAI), biomass, and final yield are experimentally measured. LAI data is retrieved from the UAV imagery and assimilated into a localized WOFOST model using least squares optimization. Sensitive parameters, i.e., specific leaf area (SLATB0, SLATB0.5, SLATB2) and maximum CO 2 assimilation rate (AMAXTB1, AMAXTB1.3) are adjusted to minimize the discrepancy between the LAI obtained from the model simulation and inversion of the UAV data. The results show that the assimilated model provides a better estimation of the growth and development of winter wheat in the study area. The R 2 , RMSE, and NRMSE of winter wheat LAI simulated with the assimilated WOFOST model are 0.8812, 0.49, and 23.5% respectively. The R 2 , RMSE, and NRMSE of the simulated yield are 0.9489, 327.06 kg·hm −2 , and 6.5%. The accuracy in model simulation of winter wheat growth is improved, which demonstrates the feasibility of integrating UAV data into crop models."
https://openalex.org/W3202918135,"Background Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common leukaemia among adults in western countries. Considering the increasing incidence and prevalence of this condition, it is highly relevant to better characterise these patients in Portugal, where data is still scarce. Methods To determine incidence, clinical presentation, survival and second malignancies, a population-based historical cohort study was conducted. Cases of interest were identified through the South Region Cancer Registry database and additional data sources. Patients aged ≥18 years, with a confirmed diagnosis of CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma between January 1 st , 2013 and December 31 st , 2014 were included. Patients were followed‐up until death or cut-off date (December 31 st , 2019). Results A total of 496 patients were included and median follow-up time was 5.46 years. Crude incidence rates were 5.03 and 5.22 per 100,000 inhabitants for 2013 and 2014, respectively, and age-adjusted incidence rates were 3.18:100,000 European population for 2013 and 3.35:100,000 European population for 2014. Median age at diagnosis was 71 years and the male/female ratio was 1.40. The majority of patients had leukemic presentation of the disease (86.09%), was diagnosed in Binet stage A (75.58%) and did not present B symptoms (84.01%), anaemia (haemoglobin ≤10g/dL; 90.63%) nor thrombocytopenia (platelet count ≤100 000/μL; 91.73%). Five-year overall survival (OS) rate was 70.53% (95%CI 66.31–74.34) and age, lactate dehydrogenase, Binet stage and a ≥5 Charlson comorbidity index score were independently associated with OS. Standardised-incidence ratios for any second malignancy and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma were 1.59 (95%CI 1.19–2.08) and 10.15 (95%CI 6.28–15.51), respectively. Conclusion Incidence, clinical presentation and survival of CLL Portuguese patients are similar to those reported for other western countries. The increased risk of second malignancies raises concerns and needs adequate clinical watchfulness."
https://openalex.org/W3203072141,"Previously we have shown that trypsin, a protein typically involved in digestion, is released from gills of both fresh and saltwater fishes into surrounding water under stress or injury. We have also shown that each species produces trypsin with different specific activities. In this report, using zebrafish as a model, we identified that trypsin induces an aversive response in zebrafish larvae and adult zebrafish. Since Protease-Activated Receptor 2 (PAR2) responds to trypsin, we tested whether the aversive response is dependent on the activation of PAR2 located on the zebrafish skin cells. Zebrafish larvae treated separately with neomycin and zinc sulfate also showed aversive response indicating neuromast, and olfactory cells are not involved in this aversion. Cultured keratinocytes from zebrafish showed a response to trypsin. Zebrafish larvae subjected to knockdown of par2a also exhibited reduced escape response. Similarly, par2a -deficient mutant larvae displayed no response to trypsin. Since it has been shown that stress activates PAR2 and sends signals to the brain as shown by the increased c-fos expression, we tested c-fos expression in adult zebrafish brains after trypsin treatment of adults and found enhanced c-fos expression by qRT-PCR. Taken together, our results show that the trypsin activates PAR2 on keratinocytes signaling the brain, and this pathway of trypsin-induced escape response will provide a unique communication mechanism in zebrafish. Furthermore, since PAR2 activation also occurs in pain/pruritus sensing, this model might be useful in elucidating components of signaling pathways in pain/pruritus."
https://openalex.org/W3203592715,"Background The proximal humerus fracture (PHF) is the third most common fragility fracture. Diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are both risks for fragility fractures; however, the interplay of DM and CKD makes treatment outcomes unpredictable. This study aimed to investigate and compare early and late outcomes following proximal humerus fracture fixation surgery in diabetic patients with different renal function conditions. Methods DM patients receiving PHF fixation surgery during 1998–2013 were recruited from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. According to their renal function, patients were divided into three study groups: non-chronic kidney disease (CKD), non-dialysis CKD, and dialysis. Outcomes of interest were early and late perioperative outcomes. Early outcomes included in-hospital newly-onset morbidities. Late outcomes included infection, revision, readmission, and all-cause mortality. Results This study included a total of 10,850 diabetic patients: 2152 had CKD (non-dialysis CKD group), 196 underwent permanent dialysis (dialysis group), and the remaining 8502 did not have CKD (non-CKD group). During a mean follow-up of 5.56 years, the dialysis group showed the highest risk of overall infection, all-cause revision, readmission, and mortality compared to the non-dialysis CKD group and non-CKD group. Furthermore, subgroup analysis showed that CKD patients had a higher risk of surgical infection following PHF surgery than non-CKD patients in cases with a traffic accident or fewer comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index, CCI &lt;3) ( P for interaction: 0.086 and 0.096, respectively). Also, CKD patients had an even higher mortality risk after PHF surgery than non-CKD patients, in females, those living in higher urbanization areas, or with more comorbidities (CCI ≥3) ( P for interaction: 0.011, 0.057, and 0.069, respectively). Conclusion CKD was associated with elevated risks for infection, revision, readmission, and mortality after PHF fixation surgery in diabetic patients. These findings should be taken into consideration when caring for diabetic patients."

In this paper, a quantum signature scheme using amplitude amplification techniques will be proposed. To secure the signature, the proposed scheme uses a partial diffusion operator and a diffusion operator to hide/unhide certain quantum states during communication. The proposed scheme consists of three phases, preparation phase, signature phase and verification phase. To confuse the eavesdropper, the quantum states representing the signature might be hidden, not hidden or encoded in Bell states. It will be shown that the proposed scheme is more secure against eavesdropping when compared with relevant quantum signature schemes."
https://openalex.org/W3202698525,"The COVID-19 global pandemic has caused millions of infections and deaths despite mitigation efforts that involve physical distancing, mask-wearing, avoiding indoor gatherings and increasing indoor ventilation. The purpose of this study was to compare ways to improve indoor ventilation and assess its effect on artificially generated aerosol counts. It was hypothesized that inbuilt kitchen vents would be more effective in reducing indoor aerosol counts than opening windows alone. A fixed amount of saline aerosol was dispersed in the experimental area using a nebulizer under constant temperature and a narrow range of humidity. A laser air quality monitor was used to record small particle counts every 30 minutes from baseline to 120 minutes for four different experimental groups for each combination of kitchen vents and windows. The results of the study demonstrate that aerosol counts were lowest with the kitchen exhaust vents on. This study suggests that liberal use of home exhaust systems like the kitchen vents could achieve significantly more air exchange than open windows alone and may present an effective solution to improving indoor ventilation, especially during the colder months when people tend to congregate indoors in closed spaces. There were no safety concerns involved when conducting this experiment."

https://openalex.org/W3204870650,"Nucleic acid-sensing pathways play critical roles in innate immune activation through the production of type I interferon (IFN-I) and proinflammatory cytokines. These factors are required for effective antitumor immune responses. Pharmacological modulators of the pre-mRNA spliceosome splicing factor 3b subunit 1 (SF3B1) are under clinical investigation as cancer cytotoxic agents. However, potential roles of these agents in aberrant RNA generation and subsequent RNA-sensing pathway activation have not been studied. In this study, we observed that SF3B1 pharmacological modulation using pladienolide B (Plad B) induces production of aberrant RNA species and robust IFN-I responses via engagement of the dsRNA sensor retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and downstream interferon regulatory factor 3. We found that Plad B synergized with canonical RIG-I agonism to induce the IFN-I response. In addition, Plad B induced NF-κB responses and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Finally, we showed that cancer cells bearing the hotspot SF3B1K700E mutation, which leads to global aberrant splicing, had enhanced IFN-I response to canonical RIG-I agonism. Together, these results demonstrate that pharmacological modulation of SF3B1 in cancer cells can induce an enhanced IFN-I response dependent on RIG-I expression. The study suggests that spliceosome modulation may not only induce direct cancer cell cytotoxicity but also initiate an innate immune response via activation of RNA-sensing pathways."

Organizational context is a complex construct to measure and appropriate instruments that can quantify and measure context are needed. The aim of this study was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the Alberta Context Tool (ACT) to Norwegian, and to test the reliability and structural validity among registered nurses (RNs) and licenced practice nurses (LPNs) working in nursing homes. Methods This study was a validation study utilizing a cross-sectional design. The sample consisted of n = 956 healthcare personnel from 28 nursing homes from a municipality in Norway. In the first stage, the ACT was translated before being administered in 28 nursing homes. In the second stage, internal consistency and structural validity were explored using Cronbach’s alpha and confirmatory factor analysis. Results A rigorous forward-and-back translation process was performed including a team of academics, experts, professional translators and the copyright holders, before an acceptable version of the ACT was piloted and finalized. The Norwegian version of the ACT showed good internal consistency with Chronbachs alpha above .75 for all concepts except for Formal interactions where the alpha was .69. Structural validity was acceptable for both RNs and LPNs with factors loadings more than .4 for most items. Conclusions The Norwegian version of the ACT is a valid measure of organizational context in Norwegian nursing homes among RNs and LPNs."

Our data show that, (1) PSGs are enriched in plant hormone signal transduction pathway and the transcription factor family; (2) PSGs are significantly lower expressed than randomly selected non-PSGs; (3) PSGs with tissue specificity are significantly higher expressed in the callus and reproductive tissues (flower and silique) than in vegetable tissues (root, stem and leaf); (4) the proportion of PSGs is positively correlated with the number of retained triplication gene copies, but the expression level of PSGs decay with the increasing of triplication gene copies; (5) the CG and CHG methylation levels of PSGs are significantly higher in introns and UTRs than in the promoter and exon regions; (6) the percent of transposable element is in proportion to the methylation level, and DNA methylation (especially in the CG content) has the tendency to reduce the expression of PSGs. This study provides insights into the characteristics, evolution, function, expression and methylation of PSGs in B . rapa ."
https://openalex.org/W3203999837,"The diversified management ability of the non-family members in the top management teams (TMTs) can significantly increase the research and development (R&amp;D) investment of the family firms. However, existing studies focus on family characteristics. To bridge the gap, this study explored the R&amp;D investment propensity for family firms from the perspective of non-family members’ participation in TMTs. Based on the upper echelons and the socioemotional wealth theory, this paper incorporated the non-economic goals that influence strategic decisions on family firms into the analytical framework. According to the questionnaire data of Chinese private enterprises, the Tobit regression model was used to analyze the influence of family members on R&amp;D investment decisions under non-economic goal orientations. The results indicated that the preference for control and influence among family members weakens the positive effect of non-family managers on R&amp;D investment, while the preferences for status perception and social responsibility strengthen the positive effect."

https://openalex.org/W3204585566,"This study aims to find out whether whole body vibration has an effect on the sprint ability to shorten the time of bobsled-skeleton athletes. Seventeen bobsled-skeleton athletes (male = 11, female = 6) were recruited from Korea Winter Olympics National Team. Participants were randomly assigned to either a sprint immediately after whole body vibration or a sprint without whole body vibration protocol during two separate visits by a period of 3 months. To evaluate the effects of the sprint ability, measurements were performed 60-m sprint recorded test. In males, at the 45m (p&lt;0.05) significant faster sprint section record after WBV more than Non-WBV. In females, at the 15m (p&lt;0.05), 30m (p&lt;0.01), 45m (p&lt;0.05), and 60m (p&lt;0.05) significant faster sprint section record after WBV more than Non-WBV. In males, at the 30m (p&lt;0.05), 45m (p&lt;0.05), and 50m (p&lt;0.05) significant faster sprint cumulative record after WBV more than Non-WBV. In females, at the 15m (p&lt;0.05), 30m (p&lt;0.05), 45m (p&lt;0.01), 50m (p&lt;0.01), and 60m (p&lt;0.01) significant faster sprint cumulative record after WBV more than Non-WBV. This study indicated that significant faster after WBV more than Non-WBV in males and females bobsled-skeleton athletes."
