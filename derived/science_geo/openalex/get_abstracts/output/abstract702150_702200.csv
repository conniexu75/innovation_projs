https://openalex.org/W4304091733,"Multipurpose prevention technologies (MPTs), which prevent sexually transmitted infection(s) and unintended pregnancy, are highly desirable to women. In this randomized, placebo-controlled, phase I study, women used a placebo or tenofovir (TFV) and levonorgestrel (LNG) intravaginal ring (IVR), either continuously or cyclically (three, 28-day cycles with a 3 day interruption in between each cycle), for 90 days. Sixty-eight women were screened; 47 were randomized to 4 arms: TFV/LNG or placebo IVRs used continuously or cyclically (4:4:1:1). Safety was assessed by adverse events and changes from baseline in mucosal histology and immune mediators. TFV concentrations were evaluated in multiple compartments. LNG concentration was determined in serum. Modeled TFV pharmacodynamic antiviral activity was evaluated in vaginal and rectal fluids and cervicovaginal tissue ex vivo . LNG pharmacodynamics was assessed with cervical mucus quality and anovulation. All IVRs were safe with no serious adverse events nor significant changes in genital tract histology, immune cell density or secreted soluble proteins from baseline. Median vaginal fluid TFV concentrations were &gt;500 ng/mg throughout 90d. TFV-diphosphate tissue concentrations exceeded 1,000 fmol/mg within 72hrs of IVR insertion. Mean serum LNG concentrations exceeded 200 pg/mL within 2h of TFV/LNG use, decreasing quickly after IVR removal. Vaginal fluid of women using TFV-containing IVRs had significantly greater inhibitory activity (87–98% versus 10% at baseline; p&lt;0.01) against HIV replication in vitro . There was a &gt;10-fold reduction in HIV p24 antigen production from ectocervical tissues after TFV/LNG exposure. TFV/LNG IVR users had significantly higher rates of anovulation, lower Insler scores and poorer/abnormal cervical mucus sperm penetration. Most TFV/LNG IVR users reported no change in menstrual cycles or fewer days of and/or lighter bleeding. All IVRs were safe. Active rings delivered high TFV concentrations locally. LNG caused changes in cervical mucus, sperm penetration, and ovulation compatible with contraceptive efficacy. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT03279120 ."
https://openalex.org/W4304091815,"Digital technologies facilitate collaboration between citizens and scientists in citizen science (CS) projects. Besides the facilitation of data transmission and access, digital technologies promote novel formats for education in CS by including citizens in the process of collecting, analyzing, and discussing data. It is usually assumed that citizens profit more from CS the more they participate in the different steps of the scientific process. However, it has so far not been analyzed whether citizens actually engage in these steps. Therefore, we investigated citizens' actual engagement in different scientific steps online (i.e., data collection and data analysis) in two field studies of a CS project. We then compared them with other CS projects. We analyzed behavioral engagement patterns of N = 273 participants with activity logs and cluster analyses. Opportunities to engage in different steps of the scientific process increased participants' overall commitment compared to contributory CS projects. Yet, despite their increased commitment, participants' engagement was only more active for data collection but not for data analysis. We discuss how participants' perceived role as data collectors influenced their actual engagement in the scientific steps. To conclude, citizens may need support to change their role from data collectors to data inquirers."
https://openalex.org/W4304087149,"HIV infection is a major public health concern, with a range of negative impacts on People Living with HIV (PLHIV). A qualitative study in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, using in-depth interviews with 26 Women Living with HIV (WLHIV) was conducted to understand HIV risk factors and impact and their access to HIV care services. This paper describes the self-response of WLHIV towards negative HIV-related experiences facing them and adds to the existing literature which tends to focus on HIV impact only, as opposed to strategies that many WLHIV have used to empower and educate themselves and their family/community. Participants were recruited using the snowball sampling technique. Data analysis was guided by a qualitative data analysis framework. Our study highlighted that WLHIV experienced psychological challenges, stigma and discrimination. However, they demonstrated remarkable self-response and capacity in pursuing effective strategies and support to protect themselves, and educating themselves and others around them to rebuild trust and regain respect and acceptance. Our findings indicate that the needs of WLHIV should be addressed through policy and practice to help them cope with HIV-related psychological and social challenges effectively. Family and community members seem to play an important role in those negative challenges against WLHIV, thus there is also a need for HIV education programs for family and community members to enhance their HIV-health literacy and acceptance of PLHIV."
https://openalex.org/W4304091888,"At present, improving the accessibility to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) health resources is an important component of China's health policy. This study evaluated the trends in the disparities and equity of TCM health resource allocation from 2010 to 2020 to inform optimal future local health planning and policy.The data for this study were extracted from the China Health Statistical Yearbook (2011-2021) and China Urban Statistical Yearbook (2020). The equity and rationality of the allocation of TCM health resources at the national and provincial levels were evaluated using the Gini coefficient and the health resource aggregation degree, respectively.The number of TCM-related institutions, beds, health staff, outpatients and admissions increased by 1.97, 2.61, 2.35, 1.72 and 2.41 times, respectively, between 2010 and 2020. The population-based Gini coefficients for health staff, beds and institutions were 0.12, 0.23 and 0.13, respectively, indicating acceptable equity, while the geographical area-based Gini index for health staff, beds and institutions were 0.65, 0.62 and 0.62, respectively, indicating serious inequity. The agglomeration degree as a function of geographical area was as follows: eastern region > central region > western region. Moreover, the institutional and health staff gaps between the geographical areas increased from 2012 to 2020. In addition, there was a relatively balanced agglomeration degree based on the population in these three regions and an increasingly equitable allocation of institutions and health staff.In recent years, China's TCM health resources and services have increased rapidly, but their proportions within the overall health system remain low. The equity and rationality of TCM health allocated by the population was better than that by the geographic area. Regional differences and inequalities, especially for institutions, still exist. A series of policies to promote the balanced development of TCM need to be implemented."
https://openalex.org/W4304092131,"While risk of fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is considered low, there is limited environmental data within households. This January-April 2021 investigation describes frequency and types of surfaces positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) among residences with ≥1 SARS-CoV-2 infection, and associations of household characteristics with surface RT-PCR and viable virus positivity. Of 1232 samples from 124 households, 27.8% (n = 342) were RT-PCR positive with nightstands (44.1%) and pillows (40.9%) most frequently positive. SARS-CoV-2 lineage, documented household transmission, greater number of infected persons, shorter interval between illness onset and sampling, total household symptoms, proportion of infected persons ≤12 years old, and persons exhibiting upper respiratory symptoms or diarrhea were associated with more positive surfaces. Viable virus was isolated from 0.2% (n = 3 samples from one household) of all samples. This investigation suggests that while SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces is common, fomite transmission risk in households is low."
https://openalex.org/W4304092393,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused a worldwide pandemic and has led to over five million deaths. Many cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. obesity or diabetes) are associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes in COVID-19. On the other hand, it has been suggested that medications used to treat cardiometabolic conditions may have protective effects for patients with COVID-19.To determine whether patients taking four classes of cardioprotective medications-aspirin, metformin, renin angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) and statins-have a lower risk of adverse outcomes of COVID-19.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of primary care patients at a large integrated healthcare delivery system who had a positive COVID-19 test between March 2020 and March 2021. We compared outcomes of patients who were taking one of the study medications at the time of the COVID-19 test to patients who took a medication from the same class in the past (to minimize bias by indication). The following outcomes were compared: a) hospitalization; b) ICU admission; c) intubation; and d) death. Multivariable analysis was used to adjust for patient demographics and comorbidities.Among 13,585 study patients, 1,970 (14.5%) were hospitalized; 763 (5.6%) were admitted to an ICU; 373 (2.8%) were intubated and 720 (5.3%) died. In bivariate analyses, patients taking metformin, RAASi and statins had lower risk of hospitalization, ICU admission and death. However, in multivariable analysis, only the lower risk of death remained statistically significant. Patients taking aspirin had a significantly higher risk of hospitalization in both bivariate and multivariable analyses.Cardioprotective medications were not associated with a consistent benefit in COVID-19. As vaccination and effective treatments are not yet universally accessible worldwide, research should continue to determine whether affordable and widely available medications could be utilized to decrease the risks of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W4304091817,"Small RNAs (sRNAs) are an important group of non-coding RNAs that have great potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for treatment of a wide variety of diseases. The portability and affordability of nanopore sequencing technology makes it ideal for point of care and low resource settings. Currently sRNAs can’t be reliably sequenced on the nanopore platform due to the short size of sRNAs and high error rate of the nanopore sequencer. Here, we developed a highly efficient nanopore-based sequencing strategy for sRNAs (SR-Cat-Seq) in which sRNAs are ligated to an adapter, circularized, and undergo rolling circle reverse transcription to generate concatemeric cDNA. After sequencing, the resulting tandem repeat sequences within the individual cDNA can be aligned to generate highly accurate consensus sequences. We compared our sequencing strategy with other sRNA sequencing methods on a short-read sequencing platform and demonstrated that SR-Cat-Seq can obtain low bias and highly accurate sRNA transcriptomes. Therefore, our method could enable nanopore sequencing for sRNA-based diagnostics and other applications."
https://openalex.org/W4304092168,"Verbal and psychological violence against women is considered an important sociological and legal problem and a serious threat within the context of basic human rights. The aim of this study was to detect the factors affecting verbal and psychological violence against women in Turkey, a developing country. The micro data set of the National research on domestic violence against women in Turkey, which was conducted by the Hacettepe University Institute of Population Studies, was employed in this study. The factors affecting women's exposure to verbal and psychological violence by their husbands or partners in Turkey were determined using binary logistic and binary probit regression analyses. Women whose husbands or partners cheated and used alcohol were more exposed to verbal and psychological violence compared to others. In addition, women who were exposed to physical, economic, and sexual violence were more exposed to verbal and psychological violence compared to others. Exposure to violence by first-degree relatives increases the possibility of exposure to verbal and psychological violence. More effective results can be achieved by prioritizing women likelier to be exposed to violence in policies aimed at preventing acts of verbal violence against women in our country. There are few studies on verbal and psychological violence against women. Therefore, it will be useful to conduct relevant studies from different perspectives."
https://openalex.org/W4304092316,"Influenza is a major cause of highly contagious respiratory illness resulting in high mortality and morbidity worldwide. Annual vaccination is an effective way to prevent infection and complication from constantly mutating influenza strains. Vaccination utilizes preemptive inoculation with live virus, live attenuated virus, inactivated virus, or virus segments for optimal immune activation. The route of administration also affects the efficacy of the vaccination. Here, we evaluated the effects of inoculation with ultraviolet (UV)-inactivated or live influenza A virus strains and compared their effectiveness and cross protection when intraperitoneal and intramuscular routes of administration were used in mice. Intramuscular or intraperitoneal inoculation with UV-inactivated Influenza A/WSN/1933 provided some protection against intranasal challenge with a lethal dose of live Influenza A/WSN/1933 but only when a high dose of the virus was used in the inoculation. By contrast, inoculation with a low dose of live virus via either route provided complete protection against the same intranasal challenge. Intraperitoneal inoculation with live or UV-inactivated Influenza A/Philippines/2/1982 and intramuscular inoculation with UV-inactivated Influenza A/Philippines/2/1982 failed to produce cross-reactive antibodies against Influenza A/WSN/1933. Intramuscular inoculation with live Influenza A/Philippines/2/1982 induced small amounts of cross-reactive antibodies but could not suppress the cytokine storm produced upon intranasal challenge with Influenza A/WSN/1993. None of the tested inoculation conditions provided observable cross protection against intranasal challenge with a different influenza strain. Taken together, vaccination efficacy was affected by the state and dose of the vaccine virus and the route of administration. These results provide practical data for the development of effective vaccines against influenza virus."
https://openalex.org/W4304092547,"High rates and racial inequities in U.S. fatal police violence are an urgent area of public health concern and policy attention. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) have been described as experiencing low rates of fatal police violence, yet AAPI subgroups vary widely on nearly every demographic and economic metric. Here, we calculate fatal police violence rates by AAPI regional and national/ethnic background, finding wide variation. We compile a list of AAPI people killed in interactions with police in 2013-2019, then use web searches and surname algorithms to identify decedents' backgrounds. Rates are then calculated by combining this numerator data with population denominators from the American Community Survey and fitting Poisson models. Excluding 18% of deaths with missing regional backgrounds, East and South Asian Americans died at a rate of 0.05 and 0.04 deaths per 100,000 (95% CI: 0.04-0.06 and 0.02-0.08), respectively, less than a third of Southeast Asian Americans' rate (0.16, CI: 0.13-0.19). Pacific Islanders suffered higher rates (0.88, CI: 0.65-1.19), on par with Native and Black Americans. More granularly, Southeast Asian American groups displaced by US war in Southeast Asia suffered higher rates than others from the same region. Traditional racial classifications thus obscure high risks of fatal police violence for AAPI subgroups. Disaggregation is needed to improve responses to fatal police violence and its racial/ethnic inequities."
https://openalex.org/W4304087077,"Mulching film is an important material in ecological restoration, such as desert control, saline alkali land improvement, and slope greening protection. At present, both solid and liquid mulching films are mainly made of man-made materials, which have a great impact on the ecological environment and are expensive. Naturally weathered red-bed soil mud films are being applied in the construction industry because of their advantages of environmental friendliness and low cost. However, at present, film formation needs to occur under pressure, in complex processes, which results in great application limitations, so it is difficult to popularize and apply these natural mud films to the field of ecological restoration. Therefore, exploring high-quality film formation under pressureless conditions is key for the application of naturally weathered red-bed soil mud films in the field of ecological restoration. To solve this problem, this paper takes naturally weathered red-bed soil, without additives; designs and carries out mud film-forming tests of naturally weathered red-bed soil and a comparison test with bentonite under pressureless conditions; tests the influence of mud particle gradation, viscosity and moisture content on the film-forming effect; optimizes the mud film-forming ratio; and further studies the thickness, water resistance, compression resistance. Acid and alkali resistances are tested and compared with international standards. The results show that the naturally weathered red-bed soil can form a mud film under pressureless conditions. The optimal (high-quality) film corresponds to a mud viscosity of 29.6-52.6 Pa·s, water content of 15-35%, and content of particles with particle sizes smaller than 1 mm of 75%-85%. Compared with international standards and bentonite, the naturally weathered red-bed soil mud film meets the ecological restoration standard, has a better water resistance, compression resistance, and acid and alkali resistances than bentonite mud film, and has the advantages of a wide distribution, low cost, simple sample preparation and wide application range. Therefore, weathered red-bed soil mud film is a film technology with obvious comparative advantages that can be introduced into the field of ecological restoration and has broad prospects."
https://openalex.org/W4304087189,"Micro-CT imaging can be used as an effective method for non-destructive testing (NDT) of metal 3D printed parts-including titanium biomedical components fabricated using laser powder-bed-fusion (LPBF). Unfortunately, the cost of commercially available micro-CT scanners renders routine NDT for biomedical applications prohibitively expensive. This study describes the design, manufacturing, and implementation of a cost-effective scanner tailored for NDT of medium-size titanium 3D printed biomedical components. The main elements of the scanner; which include a low-energy (80 kVp) portable x-ray unit, and a low-cost lens-coupled detector; can be acquired with a budget less than $ 11000 USD. The low-cost detector system uses a rare-earth phosphor screen, lens-coupled to a dSLR camera (Nikon D800) in a front-lit tilted configuration. This strategy takes advantage of the improved light-sensitivity of modern full-frame CMOS camera sensors and minimizes source-to-detector distance to maximize x-ray flux. The imaging performance of the system is characterized using a comprehensive CT quality-assurance phantom, and two titanium 3D-printed test specimens. Results show that the cost-effective scanner can survey the porosity and cracks in titanium parts with thicknesses of up to 13 mm of solid metal. Quantitatively, the scanner produced geometrically stable reconstructions, with a voxel size of 118 μm, and noise levels under 55 HU. The cost-effective scanner was able to estimate the porosity of a 17 mm diameter titanium 3D-printed cylindrical lattice structure, with a 0.3% relative error. The proposed scanner will facilitate the implementation of titanium LPBF-printed components for biomedical applications by incorporating routine cost-effective NDT as part of the process control and validation steps of medical-device quality-management systems. By reducing the cost of the x-ray detector and shielding, the scan cost will be commensurate with the overall cost of the validated component."
https://openalex.org/W4304087208,"A collection of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) having regions with the status of intrinsically disordered (IDR) according to the Disprot database was analyzed from the point of view of the structure of hydrophobic core in the structural unit (chain / domain). The analysis includes all the Homo Sapiens as well as Mus Musculus proteins present in the DisProt database for which the structure is available. In the analysis, the fuzzy oil drop modified model (FOD-M) was used, taking into account the external force field, modified by the presence of other factors apart from polar water, influencing protein structuring. The paper presents an alternative to secondary-structure-based classification of intrinsically disordered regions (IDR). The basis of our classification is the ordering of hydrophobic core as calculated by the FOD-M model resulting in FOD-ordered or FOD-unordered IDRs."
https://openalex.org/W4304091732,"Whether infertility treatment predicts severe maternal morbidity in both singleton and twin pregnancies is controversial. We conducted this nationwide population-based cohort study to compare pregnancies conceived through assisted reproductive technology treatments, such as intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilization, with unassisted pregnancies.This study included 269,930 women who experienced childbirth in 2018, using data of the National Health Insurance Service National Delivery Cohort in Korea. The primary outcome was assessed using a severe maternal morbidity algorithm developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. A modified Poisson regression was used to estimate the adjusted risk ratio of severe maternal morbidity.Severe maternal morbidity occurred in 6,333 (2.3%) of 280,612 deliveries investigated. The risk of severe maternal morbidity was approximately 1.5-fold higher among women who received in vitro fertilization (risk ratio: 1.51, 95% confidence interval: 1.36-1.68) than among fertile women. However, no significant association between intrauterine insemination and maternal morbidity was identified. Via subgroup analysis, in vitro fertilization increased the risk of severe maternal morbidity by 1.6- and 1.3-fold in singleton and multiple births, respectively (singleton: risk ratio: 1.62, 95% confidence interval: 1.43-1.83; multiple birth: risk ratio: 1.31, 95% confidence interval: 1.07-1.60).This study suggested that in vitro fertilization was associated with the risk of severe maternal morbidity in both singleton and multiple births. Further research should identify patient- and treatment-specific factors that may mitigate or prevent adverse maternal health risks."

Community-Based Stroke Services (CBSS) have the potential to address these unmet needs, yet there are no comprehensive guidelines to inform the design of CBSS, and they remain an understudied aspect of stroke care. This study aimed to describe the perceived barriers to accessing community-based stroke services, benefits from these programs and opportunities to address unmet needs.This was a qualitative descriptive study with interviews and focus groups conducted with people living with stroke and caregivers. Data were transcribed and analyzed thematically.Eighty-five individuals with stroke and caregivers participated. Four key overarching themes were identified: facilitators and barriers to accessing and participating in community-based stroke services; components of helpful and unhelpful stroke services; perceived benefits of community-based stroke services; and opportunities to address unmet stroke service needs.The findings resonate with and extend prior literature, suggesting a critical need for personalized and tailored stroke services to address persistent unmet needs. We call on relevant stakeholders, such as policymakers, providers, and researchers, to move these insights into action through comprehensive guidelines, practice standards and interventions to personalize and tailor CBSS."

Cocaine use was assessed by self-report, urine screen, and blood benzoylecgonine (BE). Blood samples were collected to assess gut permeability (intestinal fatty acid-binding protein, I-FABP), microbial translocation (lipopolysaccharide, LPS), immune activation (sCD14, sCD27, and sCD163) and markers of inflammation (hs-CRP, TNF-α and IL-6). Multiple linear regression models were used to analyze the relationships of cocaine use.A total of 37 cocaine users and 63 cocaine non-users were evaluated. Cocaine users had higher levels of I-FABP (7.92±0.35 vs. 7.69±0.56 pg/mL, P = 0.029) and LPS (0.76±0.24 vs. 0.54±0.27 EU/mL, P<0.001) than cocaine non-users. Cocaine use was also associated with the levels of LPS (P<0.001), I-FABP (P = 0.033), and sCD163 (P = 0.010) after adjusting for covariates. Cocaine users had 5.15 times higher odds to exhibit higher LPS levels than non-users (OR: 5.15 95% CI: 1.89-13.9; P<0.001). Blood levels of BE were directly correlated with LPS (rho = 0.276, P = 0.028), sCD14 (rho = 0.274, P = 0.031), and sCD163 (rho = 0.250, P = 0.049).Cocaine use was associated with markers of gut permeability, microbial translocation, and immune activation in virally suppressed PLWH. Mitigation of cocaine use may prevent further gastrointestinal damage and immune activation in PLWH."
https://openalex.org/W4304117960,"The use of MRI as a diagnostic tool has gained popularity in the field of orthopedics. Although 3-dimensional (3D) MRI offers more intuitive visualization and can better facilitate treatment planning than 2-dimensional (2D) MRI, manual segmentation for 3D visualization is time-consuming and lacks reproducibility. Recent advancements in deep learning may provide a solution to this problem through the process of automatic segmentation. The purpose of this study was to develop automated semantic segmentation on 2D MRI images of rotator cuff tears by using a convolutional neural network to visualize 3D models of related anatomic structures.MRI scans from 56 patients with rotator cuff tears (T2 Linear Coronal MRI; 3.0T, 512 mm × 512 mm, and 2.5-mm slice thickness) were collected. Segmentation masks for the cuff tendon, muscle, bone, and cartilage were obtained by four orthopedic shoulder surgeons, and these data were revised by a shoulder surgeon with more than 20 years' experience. We performed 2D and 3D segmentation using nnU-Net with secondary labels for reducing false positives. Final validation was performed in an external T2 MRI dataset (10 cases) acquired from other institutions. The Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) was used to validate segmentation quality.The use of 3D nnU-Net with secondary labels to reduce false positives achieved satisfactory results, even with a limited amount of data. The DSCs (mean ± SD) of the cuff tendon, muscle, bone, and cartilage in the internal test set were 80.7% ± 9.7%, 85.8% ± 8.6%, 97.8% ± 0.6%, and 80.8% ± 15.1%, respectively. In external validation, the DSC of the tendon segmentation was 82.74±5.2%.Automated segmentation using 3D U-Net produced acceptable accuracy and reproducibility. This method could provide rapid, intuitive visualization that can significantly facilitate the diagnosis and treatment planning in patients with rotator cuff tears."

Especially in China, the penetration rate of internet use has become more prominent. Nevertheless, the role of internet use in the relationship between occupational status and depression remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to estimate how internet use moderates the relationship between occupational status and depression in a sample of older adults in China.A cross-sectional design was used to assess the relationship between occupational status, internet use and depression. This study employed data from the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) conducted in 2017. The full sample size of this study is 2,403. OLS regression was adopted to explore the correlation between occupational status and depression and the moderating role of internet use. Meanwhile, a heterogeneity analysis based on residence registration was implemented to explore the difference between rural and urban sample groups.The findings suggested that higher occupational status was related to lower depression level. By playing an inhibitory moderating role between the association of occupational status and depression, internet use and occupational status formed a substituting effect. Meanwhile, the above moderating effect was only significant in urban group and insignificant in rural group. Besides, being male and having higher social class were significantly and negatively correlated with depression.This study began with the theory of social stratification and social mobility, added the theory of social capital, constructed an analytical framework of regulatory effect, put forward two basic assumptions, selected measurement indicators taking into account Chinese cultural factors, and conducted empirical tests using authoritative statistical software and national representative data, providing a new theoretical contribution to our understanding of the impact of occupational status and depression in developing countries."

In this study, the length of insertions/deletions variation greater larger than 10 bp from 10 Oryza sativa ssp. indica rice and 10 Oryza sativa ssp. tropical japonica rice were extracted by using the Nipponbare genome as a reference. A total of 118 primer pairs which were almost evenly distributed on each chromosome corresponding to the loci of InDels were designed by the Primer 5 program. We confirmed 85 InDel markers from 60 rice varieties, including indica and tropical japonica , by running polyacrylamide gels. The InDel markers function like SSRs in identifying hybrids, calculating genetic distance, constructing the genetic linkage map, and gene mining. The InDel markers developed in this study might help in genetic studies and to investigate the tropical japonica rice varieties."

This study aimed to measure the potential effect of virtual reality on time and number of steps when performing a locomotor task, in a young adult’s population. Sixty young adults (32W, 28M, mean age 21.55 ± 1.32), who had their first immersive virtual reality experience, performed a locomotor task based on ""Timed Up and Go"" (TUG) task in real, in virtual reality in a stopped train and in virtual reality in a moving train. Time and number of steps variables representing primary locomotion indicators were measured and compared between each condition. Results showed significant increases in time and number of steps in the two virtual reality conditions compared to real but not between the two virtual reality conditions. There was an effect of virtual reality in young adults when performing the locomotor task. It means that technological and digital characteristics of the immersive virtual reality experience led to modify motor strategies employed. Adding a plausible visual optic flow did not appear to affect motor control further when the information is negligible and not essential for performing the task."

Birthweight charts are thus sex specific, but ultrasound fetal weights are often reported by sex neutral standards. We aimed to identify what proportion of infants would be re-classified as SGA if sex-specific charts were used, and if this had a measurable impact on perinatal outcomes.Retrospective cohort study including all infants born in Victoria, Australia, from 2005-2015 (529,261 cases). We applied GROW centiles, either adjusted or not adjusted for fetal sex. We compared overall SGA populations, and the populations of males considered small by sex-specific charts only (SGAsex-only), and females considered small by sex-neutral charts only (SGAunadjust-only).Of those <10th centile by sex-neutral charts, 39.6% were male and 60.5% female, but using sex-specific charts, 50.3% were male and 49.7% female. 19.2% of SGA females were reclassified as average for gestational age (AGA) using sex-specific charts. These female newborns were not at increased risk of stillbirth, combined perinatal mortality, NICU admissions, low Apgars or emergency CS compared with an AGA infant, but were at greater risk of being iatrogenically delivered on suspicion of growth restriction. 25.0% male infants were reclassified as SGA by sex-specific charts. These male newborns, compared to the AGAall infant, were at greater risk of stillbirth (RR 1.94, 95%CI 1.30-2.90), combined perinatal mortality (RR 1.80, 95%CI 1.26-2.57), NICU admissions (RR 1.38, 95%CI 1.12-1.71), Apgars <7 at 5 minutes (RR 1.40, 95%CI 1.25-1.56) and emergency CS (RR 1.12, 95%CI 1.06-1.18).Use of growth centiles not adjusted for fetal sex disproportionately classifies female infants as SGA, increasing their risk of unnecessary intervention, and fails to identify a cohort of male infants at increased risk of adverse outcomes, including stillbirth. Sex-specific charts may help inform decisions and improve outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4304091716,"This paper aims to test whether agricultural insurance significantly impacts farmers' income increase or not. We have used the ordinary least squares method (OLS), panel fixed effects, and system generalized moment estimation (GMM) for the test. The results show that the increase in agricultural insurance density and the increase in agricultural insurance per capita compensation positively impact farmers' income growth significantly. Agricultural insurance density and per capita compensation are the indicators used in this article to measure agricultural insurance development. Therefore, it can be considered that the development of agricultural insurance in Guangdong Province (China) can effectively increase the income level of farmers. Based on the results of theoretical and empirical analysis, combined with the current situation of agricultural insurance development in Guangdong Province, this paper finally puts forward relevant countermeasures and suggestions. It provides some ideas for giving full play to the role of agricultural insurance in promoting farmers' income from the perspectives of pertinent system design, subsidy methods, insurance innovation, service level, and publicity."
https://openalex.org/W4304091813,"Cathelicidin-2 is an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) produced as part of the innate immune system of chickens and might be a new candidate to combat infection and inflammation within the gut-liver axis. Studying the hepatic immune response is of high importance as the liver is primarily exposed to gut-derived pathogen-associated molecular patterns. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of chicken cathelicidin-2 alone or combined with lipoteichoic acid (LTA) or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) on cell viability, immune response and redox homeostasis in a primary hepatocyte—non-parenchymal cell co-culture of chicken origin. Both concentrations of cathelicidin-2 decreased the cellular metabolic activity and increased the extracellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity reflecting reduced membrane integrity. Neither LTA nor PMA affected these parameters, and when combined with LTA, cathelicidin-2 could not influence the LDH activity. Cathelicidin-2 had an increasing effect on the concentration of the proinflammatory CXCLi2 and interferon- (IFN-)γ, and on that of the anti-inflammatory IL-10. Meanwhile, macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), playing a complex role in inflammation, was diminished by the AMP. LTA elevated IFN-γ and decreased M-CSF levels, while PMA only increased the concentration of M-CSF. Both concentrations of cathelicidin-2 increased the H 2 O 2 release of the cells, but the concentration of malondialdehyde as a lipid peroxidation marker was not affected. Our findings give evidence that cathelicidin-2 can also possess anti-inflammatory effects, reflected by the alleviation of the LTA-triggered IFN-γ elevation, and by reducing the M-CSF production induced by PMA. Based on the present results, cathelicidin-2 plays a substantial role in modulating the hepatic immune response with a multifaceted mode of action. It was found to have dose-dependent effects on metabolic activity, membrane integrity, and reactive oxygen species production, indicating that using it in excessively high concentrations can contribute to cell damage. In conclusion, cathelicidin-2 seems to be a promising candidate for future immunomodulating drug development with an attempt to reduce the application of antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W4304091856,"Prey remains found in carnivore scats provide generalised dietary profiles of sampled populations. The profile may be biased if individual diets differ and some individuals are over- or under-represented in the sample. Quantifying individual contributions allows us to recognise these potential biases and better interpret generalised profiles. Knowing the dietary differences or similarity between individuals can help us to understand selection pressures and identify drivers of distribution and abundance. Using the results of individual faecal genotyping, we re-interpreted our previously-published generalised dietary profile of an elusive, neotropical felid, the jaguar (Panthera onca; Foster et al. (2010)). We quantified individual sample sizes, assessed whether the generalised profile was influenced by the inclusion of scats originating from the same individual and prey carcass (pseudo-replication), and quantified the distribution of prey species among individuals. From an original sample of 322 jaguar scats from a high-density jaguar population in Belize, we identified 206 prey items (individual prey animals) in 176 independent scats representing 32 jaguars (26 males, 3 females, 3 unknown sex). The influence of pseudo-replication in the original dietary profile was minimal. The majority of scats (94%) came from male jaguars. Eight males accounted for two-thirds of the prey items, while 24 jaguars each contributed <5% of the prey items. With few exceptions, the jaguars followed the same broad diet, a 2:1:1 ratio of nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus noveminctus), other vertebrates ≤10kg, and ungulates, primarily peccaries (Tayassu pecari and Pecari tajacu). We noted prey switching between wild and domestic ungulates for individuals spanning protected forests and farmland. This first scat-based study exploring individual variation in jaguar diet highlights the importance of armadillos and peccaries for male jaguars in Belize, the need for research on their roles in supporting high-density jaguar populations, and the need for more data on female diet from across the jaguar range."
https://openalex.org/W4304091872,"The serine/threonine protein phosphatases type 2A (PP2A) are involved in several physiological responses in plants, playing important roles in developmental programs, stress responses and hormone signaling. Six PP2A catalytic subunits (StPP2Ac) were identified in cultivated potato. Transgenic potato plants constitutively overexpressing the catalytic subunit StPP2Ac2b (StPP2Ac2b-OE) were developed to determine its physiological roles. The response of StPP2Ac2b-OE plants to the oomycete Phytophthora infestans, the causal agent of late blight, was evaluated. We found that overexpression of StPP2Ac2b enhances susceptibility to the pathogen. Further bioinformatics, biochemical, and molecular analyses revealed that StPP2Ac2b positively regulates developmental and pathogen-induced senescence, and that P. infestans infection promotes senescence, most likely through induction of StPP2Ac2b expression."
https://openalex.org/W4304091948,"Backgrounds and objective Evaluating the tympanic membrane (TM) using an otoendoscope is the first and most important step in various clinical fields. Unfortunately, most lesions of TM have more than one diagnostic name. Therefore, we built a database of otoendoscopic images with multiple diseases and investigated the impact of concurrent diseases on the classification performance of deep learning networks. Study design This retrospective study investigated the impact of concurrent diseases in the tympanic membrane on diagnostic performance using multi-class classification. A customized architecture of EfficientNet-B4 was introduced to predict the primary class (otitis media with effusion (OME), chronic otitis media (COM), and ’None’ without OME and COM) and secondary classes (attic cholesteatoma, myringitis, otomycosis, and ventilating tube). Results Deep-learning classifications accurately predicted the primary class with dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 95.19%, while misidentification between COM and OME rarely occurred. Among the secondary classes, the diagnosis of attic cholesteatoma and myringitis achieved a DSC of 88.37% and 88.28%, respectively. Although concurrent diseases hampered the prediction performance, there was only a 0.44% probability of inaccurately predicting two or more secondary classes (29/6,630). The inference time per image was 2.594 ms on average. Conclusion Deep-learning classification can be used to support clinical decision-making by accurately and reproducibly predicting tympanic membrane changes in real time, even in the presence of multiple concurrent diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4304092012,"Trustworthy educational information for patients is critical for increasing their knowledge base and preparing them for shared decision making with clinicians. As the internet has become an important source of health information for many patients, the purpose of this study was to assess the quality and content of websites with educational content about immune checkpoint inhibitors.We performed an environmental scan of the currently available websites providing educational information for patients about immune checkpoint inhibitors. We used three search engines: Google, Bing, and Yahoo! (9/20/2021). Two independent investigators selected relevant uniform resource locators (URLs), appraised the quality of the websites, and collected their characteristics. We evaluated the accuracy, completeness, technical elements, design and aesthetics, readability, usability, and accessibility of the websites. The user experience was also evaluated.We identified 37 websites for analysis. In 10 websites (27%), it was not possible to know the source of the information provided. Thirty-three (89%) provided a definition with a simple explanation of cancer and treatment and 30 (81%) on complications of immune checkpoint inhibitors; only seven (19%) provided information about the balance between risks and benefits. Thirty-five (95%) provided a statement of purpose. Regarding the design, all 37 (100%) had appropriate visual aspects, typography, and grammar. Thirty-six (97%) were well organized. For most of the websites (n = 35, 95%) the content was easy to find. Only two websites had a readability score of 6, while the others had higher scores. Regarding the user experience, the overall quality of websites was rated as excellent in 16 (43%), good in 14 (38%), and fair in 7 (19%).Our findings reveal that websites with information about immune checkpoint inhibitors mostly have general information about cancer, the treatments, and adverse events. Few websites provide information about the balance between harms and benefits of treatment, costs, the source of the information, or the hierarchy of evidence. These findings identify the gap in the quality and content of websites for patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors and can help website creators and developers."
https://openalex.org/W4304092311,"Smoking is a global health risk for premature death and disease. Recently, addictive behaviors, like smoking, were considered to be guided by explicit and implicit processes. The existence of a dissociation between the two attitudes in nonsmokers and the causes of the differences in implicit attitudes toward smoking have not been fully investigated. We investigated the explicit and implicit attitudes toward smoking via a self-reported scale and the single category implicit association test (SC-IAT), respectively, among undergraduate and graduate health sciences students. In addition, we applied the drift-diffusion model (DDM) on the SC-IAT and examined the behavioral characteristics that caused differences in implicit attitude toward smoking between smokers and nonsmokers. The results showed the existence of a dissociation between explicit and implicit attitudes toward smoking among nonsmokers. In addition, nonsmokers had a higher decision threshold than smokers and a higher drift rate in the condition where negative words were associated with smoking. Nonsmokers engaged in SC-IAT with more cautious attitudes and responded more easily in a negative condition since it was consistent with their true attitudes. Conversely, smokers did not show a significant difference in the drift rate between the conditions. These results suggested that the differences in an implicit attitude between smokers and nonsmokers were caused by differences in evidence accumulation speed between the positive and negative conditions. The existence of dissociation between implicit and explicit attitudes toward smoking may indicate the difficulty of measuring true attitude in nonsmokers in a questionnaire survey. Additionally, the DDM results explained the difference of implicit attitude between smokers and nonsmokers; it may provide information on the mechanisms of addictive behaviors and a basis for therapy. However, whether these results are affected by cultural differences requires further investigation."

In Ethiopia, healthcare services are underutilized due to a lack of resources in the healthcare system. The study aims to identify the individual and community level factors associated with community-based health insurance enrollment of households in Ethiopia.Data from the Ethiopian mini demographic and health survey 2019 were used to identify factors associated with community-based health insurance enrollment of households in Ethiopia. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was used on a nationally representative sample of 8,663 households nested within 305 communities, considering the data's layered structure. We used a p-value<0.05 with a 95% confidence interval for the results.The prevalence of community-based health insurance enrollment in Ethiopia was 20.2%. The enrollment rate of households in the scheme was high in both Amhara (57.9), and Tigray (57.9%) regions and low (3.0%) in the Afar region. At the individual level; the age of household heads, number of children 5 and under, number of household members, has land for agriculture, has a mobile telephone, receiving cash of food from the safety Net Program, Owning livestock, and herds of farm animals, wealth index, and at the community level; the region had a significant association with community-based health insurance enrollment.Both individual and community-level characteristics were significant predictors of community-based health insurance enrollment in households.

https://openalex.org/W4304092518,"The continuity of care throughout pregnancy, birth, and after delivery is an effective strategy to avert maternal and newborn deaths. A low proportion of mothers have achieved the continuum of maternal care in Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess the rate and factors associated with the completion of a continuum of maternal healthcare services in Hadiya Zone, Southern Ethiopia.A community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted over two months (from September to October 2021) in 18 kebeles of the Hadiya zone, southern Ethiopia. Multistage cluster sampling was carried out to select the required study subjects, and data were collected using a structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire. A multilevel binary logistic regression model was used to examine the effects of individual and community-level factors on key elements of the care continuum. The measure of fixed effects was expressed as an odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval (CI).In this study, only 11.3% of women completed all components of the care continuum, which included four or more antenatal visits, skilled birth attendance, and postnatal care. The factors that are significantly associated with the completion of maternal care include higher maternal education [AOR = 4.1; 95%CI: 1.3-12.6], urban residence [AOR = 1.8; 95%CI: 1.1-3.0], time of first antenatal care follow-up [AOR = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.6-4.6], knowledgeability regarding postnatal danger signs [AOR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1-3.3], being in the highest wealth quintile [AOR = 2.8; 95%CI: 1.2-6.6] and primipara [AOR = 3.6; 95%CI: 1.4-9.4].The rate of continuum of maternal healthcare services utilization was low in the study area. The findings indicated that higher maternal education, urban residence, time of first antenatal care follow-up, knowledgeability regarding postnatal danger signs, being in the highest wealth quintile and primipara were the factors associated with the completion of the continuum of maternal care. As a result of this study's findings, program planners and ministry of health and non-governmental organizations working on maternal health should prioritize continued and strengthened health education in order to increase the completion level of the continuum of maternal healthcare services."
https://openalex.org/W4304087052,"Consumers tend to have negative perceptions of service providers that limit their freedom. People might therefore be expected to respond particularly negatively to service providers that physically limit their freedom of movement. Yet, we suggest that physical constraints that a service provider unapologetically imposes with no obvious logical justification (e.g., closing a door and restricting consumers to stay inside a room) may, in fact, boost consumers' evaluations of the service provider. We propose that this effect occurs because consumers perceive such constraints as creating a structured environment, which they inherently value. Six studies lend converging support to these propositions, while ruling out alternative accounts (cognitive dissonance, self-attribution theory). We further show that the positive effect of physical constraints on evaluations is reversed when consumers perceive the constraints as excessively restrictive (rather than mild). These findings suggest that service providers may benefit from creating consumption conditions that mildly restrict consumers' freedom of movement."

This study aimed to clarify the changes in mortality associated with temperature-sensitive diseases in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used data from three major cities (Sapporo City, Tokyo 23 wards, and Osaka City) from 2010 to 2019 to determine disease mortality rates and monthly mean temperatures from April to December. If the pandemic had not occurred in 2020, the results showed that temperature-sensitive disease death counts would have increased from 324 to 980, based on a 95% confidence interval estimated from the past 10 years in Sapporo (19–56% increase in actual deaths from 2020), from 651 to 2,653 in Tokyo (10–39% increase), and from 235 to 1,343 in Osaka (8–48% increase). Analyses of meshed population data during the COVID-19 pandemic indicated that inhibiting people’s behaviour and outdoor mobility, especially in older men, caused a decrease in mortality."

We aim to identify risk factors for negative and positive experiences of caregiving among family caregivers. Design Prospective, nationwide, multi-center cohort study. Setting and participants 110 family caregivers of Singaporeans aged≥55 admitted for unintentional blunt trauma with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) or New Injury Severity Score (NISS)≥10 were assessed for caregiving-related negative (disturbed schedule and poor health, lack of family support, lack of finances) and positive (esteem) experiences using the modified-Caregiver Reaction Assessment (m-CRA) three months post-injury. Methods The association between caregiver and patient factors, and the four m-CRA domains were evaluated via linear regression. Results Caregivers of retired patients and caregivers of functionally dependent patients (post-injury Barthel score &lt;80) reported a worse experience in terms of disturbed schedule and poor health (β-coefficient 0.42 [95% Confidence Interval 0.10, 0.75], p = .01; 0.77 [0.33, 1.21], p = .001), while male caregivers and caregivers who had more people in the household reported a better experience (-0.39 [-0.73, -0.06], p = .02; -0.16 [-0.25, -0.07], p = .001). Caregivers of male patients, retired patients, and patients living in lower socioeconomic housing were more likely to experience lack of family support (0.28, [0.03, -0.53], p = .03; 0.26, [0.01, 0.52], p = .05; 0.34, [0.05, -0.66], p = .02). In the context of lack of finances, caregivers of male patients and caregivers of functionally dependent patients reported higher financial strain (0.74 [0.31, 1.17], p = .001; 0.84 [0.26, 1.43], p = .01). Finally, caregivers of male patients reported higher caregiver esteem (0.36 [0.15, 0.57], p = .001). Conclusions and implications Negative and positive experiences of caregiving among caregivers of older blunt trauma patients are associated with pre-injury disability and certain patient and caregiver demographics. These factors should be considered when planning the post-discharge support of older blunt trauma patients."
https://openalex.org/W4304087141,"What is the effect of declaring a pandemic? This research assesses behavioral and psychological responses to the WHO declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, in Hong Kong, Singapore, and the U.S. We surveyed 3,032 members of the general public in these three regions about the preventative actions they were taking and their worries related to COVID-19. The WHO announcement on March 11th, 2020 created a quasi-experimental test of responses immediately before versus after the announcement. The declaration of the pandemic increased worries about the capacity of the local healthcare system in each region, as well as the proportion of people engaging in preventative actions, including actions not recommended by medical professionals. The number of actions taken correlates positively with anxiety and worries. Declaring the COVID-19 crisis as a pandemic had tangible effects-positive (increased community engagement) and negative (increased generalized anxiety)-which manifested differently across regions in line with expectancy disconfirmation theory."
https://openalex.org/W4304087158,"Allograft bone tissue has a long history of use. There are two main ways of preserving allografts: by cold (freezing), or at room temperature after an additional cleaning treatment using chemicals. These chemicals are considered potentially harmful to humans. The aim of the study was (i) to assess the presence of chemical residues on processed bone allografts and (ii) to compare the in vitro biocompatibility of such allografts with that of frozen allografts. The presence of chemical residues on industrially chemically treated bone was assessed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after extraction. Biocompatibility analysis was performed on primary osteoblast cultures from Wistar rats grown on bone disks, either frozen (F-bone group) or treated with supercritical carbon dioxide with no added chemical (scCO2-bone group) or industrially treated with chemicals (CT-bone group). Cell viability (XTT) was measured after one week of culture. Osteoblastic differentiation was assessed after 1, 7 and 14 days of culture by measuring alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity directly on the bone discs and indirectly on the cell mat in the vicinity of the bone discs. Residues of all the chemicals used were found in the CT-bone group. There was no significant difference in cell viability between the three bone groups. Direct and indirect ALP activities were significantly lower (-40% to -80%) in the CT-bone group after 7 and 14 days of culture (p < 0.05). Residues of chemical substances used in the cleaning of bone allografts cause an in vitro decrease in their biocompatibility. Tissue cleaning processes must be developed that limit or replace these chemicals to favor biocompatibility."
https://openalex.org/W4304087197,"The association between executive function and excess weight is becoming increasingly evident. However, the results of previous studies are still inconclusive, and there is a lack of evidence in early childhood. This study aims to examine the association between executive function, in terms of overall and subscales of executive function (e.g., inhibition, working memory, and shifting), and weight excess in preschoolers. A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted on children aged 2–5 years of age from public and private schools in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Participants’ weights and heights were measured and classified into three weight status groups (i.e., children with normal weight, overweight, and obesity groups). Executive function was assessed using the parent-report Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool (BRIEF-P). Multivariable polynomial regression was performed to analyze the association between executive function and weight status. A total of 1,181 children were included in the study. After adjusting for confounders, impaired overall executive function significantly increased the probability of being overweight (odds ratio [OR] = 2.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.33 to 4.56). A similar trend of association was also found between impaired inhibition and overweight status (OR = 2.33; 95%CI 1.11 to 4.90). Furthermore, poor working memory was associated with both overweight and obesity (OR = 1.87; 95%CI 1.09 to 3.20 and OR = 1.74; 95%CI 1.09 to 2.78, respectively). Our data suggest that deficits in executive function, particularly inhibition and working memory, are associated with weight excess in preschoolers. Early promotion of executive function may be needed at this developmental age to prevent unhealthy weight status."

It is essential to discern the disorders with significant coronary lesions (SCDs) requiring coronary angiography from mimicking disease. We aimed to determine which of all clinical variables were more important using conventional logistic regression (cLR) and machine learning (ML). Materials Of 3382 patients with chest pain/discomfort or dyspnea in whom CAG was performed, 1893 were included. All clinical data were divided as follows (i): Demographics, history, and physical examination; (ii): (i) plus electrocardiography; and (iii): (ii) plus echocardiography, and analyzed by cLR and ML. Results In multivariable analysis via cLR, the AUC and accuracy of the model using the final 20 variables were 0.795 and 72.62%, respectively. In multivariable analysis via ML, the best AUCs in the internal validation were 0.8 with (i), 0.81 with (ii), 0.83 with (iii), and in external validation, the best AUCs were 0.71 with (i), 0.74 with (ii), and 0.79 with (iii). The best AUCs and accuracy of the fittest model including 21 importance variables by ML were 0.81 and 72.48% in internal validation; and 0.75 and 70.5% in external validation, respectively. The importance variables in ML and cLR were similar, but slightly different and the additional discriminators via ML were found. Conclusion The assessment using the fittest importance variables can assist physicians in differentiating mimicking diseases in which coronary angiography may not be required in patients suspected of having acute coronary syndrome in emergency department."
https://openalex.org/W4304091976,"The quality of the dietary habits of older adults is important for increasing healthy life expectancy. As with other physical senses, the senses of taste and olfaction change with age. In contrast to physical sensations that can be visibly compared with those of other people, taste and olfaction are personal sensations, making it challenging to infer associated changes. This study investigated the characteristics of taste and olfaction in healthy older adults and compared them with those of young adults. In the taste assessment, threshold values were measured using the whole-mouth method with a diagnostic assay kit (Tastedisc). The olfactory assessment measured the overall identification ability using a card-type olfactory identification test kit (Open Essence). Additionally, participants' subjective health awareness was measured using a visual analog scale. The taste and olfactory assessments results showed that the older group had lower overall sensory sensitivity than the young group, and that there was no correlation between taste and olfactory sensitivity in the older group, while a trend was observed in the young group. Moreover, there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding subjective health awareness, indicating that participants in our research considered themselves healthy regardless of age. This suggests that the subjective health awareness of older people in the health promotion class is somehow independent from their sensory ability."

How such reasons relate to postoperative outcome is unclear.The aim was to explore Swedish patients' reasons for undergoing bariatric surgery. Also, we wanted to analyze if there were sex and age differences and associations with weight loss and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).This was a single-center study conducted at a university hospital.Data on 688 patients (528 women and 160 men) including a free text response was analyzed inductively and deductively using predefined statements and was merged with data from the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry. All data was analyzed using descriptive and analytic statistics.The most common reason for undergoing bariatric surgery was pain in different body parts. A wish for an improved medical condition was reported by most patients (59%, n = 408), followed by physical limitations making daily life difficult (42%, n = 288). Men and women reported similar reasons. Younger patients were more distressed about physical appearance (p = 0.001) and older patients wanted to improve their medical condition (p = 0.013). Health-related quality of life improved irrespective of reasons for undergoing surgery.The most reported reasons for undergoing bariatric surgery were a wish for improved medical condition and to make daily life easier. Factors associated with the decision for surgery showed that there were few sex differences, but age seemed to be a factor. The HRQoL trajectory showed improvement regardless of reasons for undergoing surgery."

https://openalex.org/W4304092308,"Kiwi are a unique and emblematic group of birds endemic to New Zealand. Deep-time evolutionary relationships among the five extant kiwi species have been difficult to resolve, in part due to the absence of pre-Quaternary fossils to inform speciation events. Here, we utilise single representative nuclear genomes of all five extant kiwi species (great spotted kiwi, little spotted kiwi, Okarito brown kiwi, North Island brown kiwi, and southern brown kiwi) and investigate their evolutionary histories with phylogenomic, genetic diversity, and deep-time (past million years) demographic analyses. We uncover relatively low levels of gene-tree phylogenetic discordance across the genomes, suggesting clear distinction between species. However, we also find indications of post-divergence gene flow, concordant with recent reports of interspecific hybrids. The four species for which unbiased levels of genetic diversity could be calculated, due to the availability of reference assemblies (all species except the southern brown kiwi), show relatively low levels of genetic diversity, which we suggest reflects a combination of older environmental as well as more recent anthropogenic influence. In addition, we suggest hypotheses regarding the impact of known past environmental events, such as volcanic eruptions and glacial periods, on the similarities and differences observed in the demographic histories of the five kiwi species over the past million years."

Retrospective data of 38 male patients with DMD were aged-matched with data of 38 male patients with NF1. Patients of both groups underwent neurocognitive assessment for regular clinical care. Intellectual abilities, sequential and simultaneous processing, verbal memory and sustained attention were evaluated. In addition, parents and teachers completed behavioral questionnaires. Males with DMD exhibited low intellectual abilities and sequential processing problems, but these outcomes not significantly differed from males with NF1. Simultaneous processing, verbal memory and sustained attention outcomes were equal for both groups. Outcomes of questionnaires displayed higher rates of aggressive behavior (13.2%) in DMD, whereas in NF1 higher rates of problems with thinking (15.8%), withdrawn (10.5%) and social behavior (10.5%) were noticed. In the neurogenetic disorders DMD and NF1, on average overlapping cognitive and behavioral problems are noticed, suggesting that these are not only caused by gene mutations resulting in a lack of one specific protein."

Methods We used the Oregon Commission for the Blind registry to determine the number of persons who are legally blind, as well as licensure data to determine the density of eye care providers (optometrists and ophthalmologists) within each county of the State of Oregon. We used geospatial statistics, analysis of variance, and logistic regression to determine the explanatory variables associated with blindness within counties. Results We included 8350 individuals who are legally blind within the state of Oregon in the calendar year 2015. The mean observed prevalence of registered blindness was 0.21% and ranged almost 9-fold from 0.04% to 0.58% among counties (p &lt; .001). In univariate models, higher blindness was associated with increasing median age (p = .027), minority race (p &lt; .001), decreased median household income (p &lt; .001), increased poverty within a county (p &lt; .001), and higher density of ophthalmologists (p = .003). Density of optometrists was not associated with prevalence of blindness (p = .89). The final multivariable model showed higher blindness to be associated with lower median household income, higher proportion of black race, and lower proportion of Hispanic race (p &lt; .001 for all). Conclusion Geospatial analytics identified counties with higher and lower than expected proportions of blindness even when adjusted for sociodemographic factors. Clinicians and researchers may use the methods and results of this study to better understand the distribution of individuals with blindness and the associated factors to help design public health interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4304092439,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver malignancy. Early diagnosis of HCC has always been challenging. This study aims to assess the pathogenicity and the prevalence of IL-6 -174G/C (rs1800795) and TGFβ-1 +29C/T (rs1800470) polymorphisms in HCV-infected HCC patients. Experimental strategies are integrated with computational approaches to analyse the pathogenicity of the TGFβ-1 +29C/T and IL-6-174 G/C polymorphisms in HCV-induced HCC. AliBaba2 was used to predict the effect of IL-6-174 G/C on transcription factor binding site in IL-6 gene. Structural changes in the mutant TGFβ-1 structure were determined through project HOPE. To assess the polymorphic prevalence of IL-6 -174G/C and TGFβ-1 +29C/T genotypes in HCC and control subjects, amplification refractory mutation system PCR (ARMS-PCR) was performed on 213 HCC and 216 control samples. GraphPad Prism version 8.0 was used for the statistical analysis of the results. In-silico analysis revealed the regulatory nature of both IL-6 -174G/C and TGFβ-1 +29C/T polymorphisms. ARMS-PCR results revealed that the individuals carrying TT genotype for TGFβ-1 gene have an increased risk of developing HCC (p<0.0001, OR = 5.403, RR = 2.062) as compared to individuals with CT and CC genotype. Similarly, GC genotype carriers for IL-6 gene exhibit an increased risk of HCC susceptibility (p<0.0001, OR = 2.276, RR = 1.512) as compared to the people carrying the GG genotype. Genotype TT of TGFβ-1 gene and genotype GC of IL-6 gene are found to be associated with HCV-induced HCC. IL-6 polymorphism may alter its transcription that leads to its pathogenicity. TGFβ-1 polymorphism may alter protein structure stability."
https://openalex.org/W4304092443,"A recent study reported that the increase in intramuscular adipose tissue of the quadriceps in older inpatients is related to a decreasing degree of recovery in swallowing ability compared to the loss of muscle mass. However, whether the association remains true in case of aspiration pneumonia is unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the relationship between the degree of recovery in swallowing ability and intramuscular adipose tissue in the quadriceps of older inpatients with aspiration pneumonia.This prospective study included 39 older patients with aspiration pneumonia. Swallowing ability was assessed using the Food Intake Level Scale (FILS). The indicators for the degree of recovery in swallowing ability were FILS at discharge and change in FILS. A greater change in FILS indicates a greater improvement in swallowing ability. Intramuscular adipose tissue and muscle mass of the quadriceps were evaluated at admission using echo intensity and muscle thickness on ultrasound images, respectively. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine whether the echo intensity of the quadriceps was independently and significantly related to FILS at discharge and the change in FILS. Independent variables were age, sex, days from disease onset, echo intensity and muscle thickness of the quadriceps, subcutaneous fat thickness of the thigh, FILS at admission, and number of units of rehabilitation therapy.Echo intensity of the quadriceps (β = -0.363, p = 0.012) and FILS at admission (β = 0.556, p < 0.001) were independently and significantly associated with FILS at discharge (R2 = 0.760, f2 = 3.167, statistical power = 1.000). Similar variables (echo intensity of the quadriceps [β = -0.498, p = 0.012] and FILS at admission [β = -0.635, p < 0.001]) were independently and significantly related to change in FILS (R2 = 0.547, f2 = 1.208, statistical power = 0.998). Quadriceps muscle thickness was not independently and significantly related to FILS at discharge and change in FILS.Our results indicate that intramuscular adipose tissue of the quadriceps in older inpatients with aspiration pneumonia is more strongly related to the degree of recovery in swallowing ability (that is, swallowing ability at discharge and change in swallowing ability) than muscle mass, and patients who have high intramuscular adipose tissue of the quadriceps at admission have a lower degree of recovery in swallowing ability."
https://openalex.org/W4304092506,"This study proposes a neural network framework for modeling the foam effects found in liquid simulation without noise. The position and advection of the foam particles are calculated using the existing screen projection method, and the noise problem that occurs in this process is prevented by using the neural network. A significant problem in the screen projection approach is the noise generated in the projection map during the projecting of momentum onto the discretized screen space. We efficiently solve this problem by utilizing a denoising neural network. Following the selection of the foam generation area using a projection map, the foam particles are generated through the inverse transformation of the 2D space into 3D space. This solves the problem of small-sized foam dissipation that occurs in conventional denoising networks. Furthermore, by integrating the proposed algorithm with the screen-space projection framework, it is able to maintain all the advantages of this approach. In conclusion, the denoising process and clean foam effects enable the proposed network to model the foam effects stably."

https://openalex.org/W4304092563,"PROM1 (CD133, AC133) is a protein that is required for the maintenance of primary cilia. Mutation in the Prom1 gene in humans and animal models are associated with several forms of retinal degeneration. mAB 13A4 is the main reagent used to detect the mouse PROM1 protein. We endeavored to map the epitope of the rat monoclonal antibody mAB 13A4 to the mouse PROM1 protein. Deletion mutagenesis demonstrated that mAB 13A4 recognizes a structural epitope that is stabilized by two of the extracellular domains of PROM1. Furthermore, the affinity of mAB 13A4 to the major PROM1 isoform in photoreceptor cells is significantly reduced due to the inclusion of a photoreceptor-specific alternative exon in the third extracellular domain. Interestingly, a deletion in the photoreceptor specific isoform of six amino acids adjacent to the alternative exon restored the affinity of mAB 13A4 to PROM1. The results of the mutagenesis are consistent with the computationally predicted helical bundle structure of PROM1 and point to the utility of mAB 13A4 for evaluating the effect of mutations on the PROM1 structure. Our results show that the PROM1 isoform composition needs to be considered when interpreting tissue and developmental expression data produced by mAB 13A4."
https://openalex.org/W4304114705,"Echinoderms are marine water invertebrates that are represented by more than 7000 extant species, grouped in five classes and showing diverse morphologies (starfish, sea lilies, feather stars, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, brittle and basket stars). In an effort to further study their diversity, DNA barcodes (DNA fragments of the 5' end of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene, COI) have been used to complement morphological examination in identifying evolutionary lineages. Although divergent clusters of COI sequences were reported to generally match morphological species delineations, they also revealed some discrepancies, suggesting overlooked species, ecophenotypic variation or multiple COI lineages within one species. Here, we sequenced COI fragments of 312 shallow-water echinoderms of the East Coast of South Africa (KwaZulu-Natal Province) and compared morphological identifications with species delimitations obtained with four methods that are exclusively based on COI sequences. We identified a total of 103 morphospecies including 18 that did not exactly match described species. We also report 46 COI sequences that showed large divergences (>5% p-distances) with those available to date and publish the first COI sequences for 30 species. Our analyses also identified discordances between morphological identifications and COI-based species delimitations for a considerable proportion of the morphospecies studied here (49/103). For most of them, further investigation is necessary to keep a sound connection between taxonomy and the growing importance of DNA-based research."
