https://openalex.org/W1984675704,"Salicylic acid (SA) plays a key role in the establishment of resistance to microbial pathogens in many plants. The discovery that SA inhibits catalase from tobacco led us to suggest that H2O2 acts as second messenger to activate plant defenses. Detailed analyses of SA's interaction with tobacco and mammalian catalases indicate that SA acts as an electron donor for the peroxidative cycle of catalase. When H2O2 fluxes were relatively low (1 μM/min or less), SA inhibited catalase, consistent with its suggested signaling function via H2O2. However, significant inhibition was only observed at 100 μM SA or more, a level reached in infected, but not in uninfected, leaves. This inhibition was probably due to siphoning catalase into the slow peroxidative reaction. Surprisingly, SA was also able to protect catalase from inactivation by damaging levels of H2O2 (lower millimolar range), which is generally assumed to reflect accumulation of inactive ferro-oxy intermediates. SA did so by supporting or substituting for the protective function of catalase-bound NADPH. These results add new features to SA's interaction with heme enzymes and its in vivo redox properties. Thus, SA, in addition to its proposed signaling function, may also have an important antioxidant role in containing oxidative processes associated with plant defense responses.

Vertebrate animals possess a novel and highly specific immune system that acts as a defense against disease. Plants react to pathogen attack by activating elaborate defense mechanisms, which are much more poorly characterized than the vertebrate immune system. These defense mechanisms are activated not only at the sites of infection, which are manifested, in part, as necrotic lesions (hypersensitive response; HR), 1The abbreviations used are: HRhypersensitive responseSARsystemic acquired resistancePRpathogenesis-relatedINA2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisSAsalicylic acidASantisense. but also in neighboring and even distal uninfected parts of the plant, leading to systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Both HR and SAR are associated with induction of a large number of defense-related genes. The products of these genes may play important roles in the restriction of pathogen growth and spread either indirectly, by participating in strengthening host cellular structures, or directly, by providing antimicrobial activities (for review see Ryals et al. (58Ryals J. Uknes S. Ward E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 1109-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) and Dempsey and Klessig (11Dempsey D.A. Klessig D.F. Bull. Inst. Pasteur. 1995; 93: 167-186Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar)). During the HR, generation of reactive oxygen species (oxidative burst) precedes formation of necrotic lesions, which result from host cell death (Doke and Ohashi (13Doke N. Ohashi Y. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1988; 32: 163-175Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and Levine et al. (38Levine A. Tenhaken R. Dixon R. Lamb C.

Additionally, defense responses in surrounding cells become activated, which include synthesis of phytoalexins, pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, and cell wall polymers such as lignin (Dempsey and Klessig, 11Dempsey D.A. Klessig D.F. Bull. Inst. Pasteur. 1995; 93: 167-186Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Establishment of SAR results in enhanced and long lasting resistance to secondary challenge by the same or even an unrelated pathogen and is associated with activation of PR genes (Ryals et al., 58Ryals J. Uknes S. Ward E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 1109-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar; Dempsey and Klessig, 11Dempsey D.A. Klessig D.F. Bull. Inst. Pasteur. 1995; 93: 167-186Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The detailed sequence of molecular events required for the initiation and regulation of HR and SAR is unknown, but progress has been made in identifying several components of the signal transduction pathways leading to disease resistance, among them salicylic acid (SA; for review see Staskawicz et al. (65Staskawicz B.J. Ausubel F.M. Baker B.J. Ellis J.G. Jones J.D.G. Science. 1995; 268: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) and Dangl (8Dangl J.L.

SA is present in many plants. While the healing benefits of plants containing high levels of SA have been known since antiquity, the first insights regarding SA's role in plants have emerged only during the past decade. A mounting body of evidence has accumulated that indicates that SA plays an important role in plant defense responses (for review see Ryals et al. (58Ryals J. Uknes S. Ward E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 1109-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar); Dempsey and Klessig (11Dempsey D.A. Klessig D.F. Bull. Inst. Pasteur. 1995; 93: 167-186Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar)). White (68White R.F. Virology. 1979; 99: 410-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) was the first to demonstrate that application of exogenous SA or acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) to tobacco induces PR gene expression and partial resistance to pathogens such as tobacco mosaic virus. Endogenous levels of SA increase dramatically after tobacco mosaic virus inoculation of resistant, but not susceptible, tobacco cultivars and parallel the induction of PR genes (Malamy et al., 41Malamy J. Carr J.P. Klessig D.F. Raskin I. Science. 1990; 250: 1002-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). In addition, SA induces the same set of nine genes that are activated systemically by tobacco mosaic virus infection (Ward et al., 67Ward E.R. Uknes S.J. Williams S.C. Dincher S.S. Wiederhold D.L. Aleander D.C. Al-Goy P. Metraux J.P. Ryals J.A. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1085-1094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cucumber, SA levels rise in the phloem of tobacco necrosis virus-, or Colletotrichum lagenarium-, infected leaves before development of SAR in distal tissues (Métraux et al., 43Métraux J.P. Signer H. Ryals J. Ward E. Wyss-Benz M. Gaudin J. Raschdorf K. Schmid E. Blum W. Inverardi B. Science. 1990; 250: 1004-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis mutants that develop spontaneous lesions and express genes associated with HR and SAR also have elevated levels of SA (Dietrich et al., 12Dietrich R.A. Delaney T.P. Uknes S.J. Ward E.R. Ryals J.A. Dangl J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 565-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar; Greenberg et al., 22Greenberg J.T. Guo A. Klessig D.F. Ausubel F.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 551-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Finally, tobacco mosaic virus-infected transgenic tobacco plants, which express the nahG gene that encodes the SA-metabolizing enzyme salicylate hydroxylase from Pseudomonas putida, accumulate little or no SA, fail to establish SAR, and develop viral lesions that are larger than those produced on wild type plants (Gaffney et al., 19Gaffney T. Friedrich L. Vernooij B. Negrotto D. Nye G. Uknes S. Ward E. Kessmann H. Ryals J. Science. 1993; 261: 754-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar). To investigate how SA might function in plant defense responses, our laboratory has focused on the identification of cellular factors with which SA directly interacts. We have suggested that one mechanism of SA action is to inhibit catalase, thereby elevating endogenous levels of H2O2, which result either from the oxidative burst associated with the HR or from metabolic processes such as photorespiration, photosynthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation (Chen et al., 5Chen Z. Silva H. Klessig D.F. Science. 1993; 262: 1883-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar, 6Chen Z. Malamy J. Hennig J. Conrath U. Sanchez-Casas P. Ricigliano J. Silva H. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4134-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). According to this working hypothesis, the elevated H2O2 or other reactive oxygen species derived from it would activate plant defense-related genes such as the PR-1 genes. This mode of activation of plant defenses has been compared with the induction of genes associated with mammalian immune, inflammatory, and acute phase responses that are mediated through H2O2 activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (Schmidt et al., 62Schmidt K.N. Amstad P. Cerutti P. Baeuerle P.A. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 13-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In support of this model, we have found that (i) 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid (INA; a synthetic inducer of PR genes and enhanced resistance) and its biologically active, but not inactive, analogues also inhibit tobacco catalase in vivo (Conrath et al., 7Conrath U. Chen Z. Ricigliano J.W. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7143-7147Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar); (ii) INA as well as SA and its biologically active analogues inhibit the other major H2O2-scavenging enzyme, ascorbate peroxidase, but not guaiacol peroxidases (Durner and Klessig, 14Durner J. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11312-11316Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), and (iii) antioxidants block the action of SA and INA (Conrath et al., 7Conrath U. Chen Z. Ricigliano J.W. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7143-7147Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, currently there is considerable controversy about the involvement of catalase inhibition by SA and the subsequent increase of H2O2 in plant defense responses. Several recent reports have indicated that H2O2 is unlikely to be involved in PR gene induction or SAR. Inhibition of catalase in leaf extracts requires concentrations of SA far above those observed in uninfected tissues (Bi et al., 2Bi Y.M. Kenton P. Mur L. Darby R. Draper J. Plant J. 1995; 8: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar; Chen et al., 5Chen Z. Silva H. Klessig D.F. Science. 1993; 262: 1883-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). In addition, while H2O2 and H2O2-inducing chemicals activate PR-1 genes in wild type tobacco, there is little or no gene induction in NahG plants. Therefore, it has been concluded that H2O2 induction of SAR genes requires SA rather than the reverse (Neuenschwander et al., 47Neuenschwander U. Vernooij B. Friedrich L. Uknes S. Kessmann H. Ryals J. Plant J. 1995; 8: 227-233Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been shown that very high levels of H2O2 stimulate SA biosynthesis (León et al., 37León J. Lawton M.A. Raskin I. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 1673-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar; Neuenschwander et al., 47Neuenschwander U. Vernooij B. Friedrich L. Uknes S. Kessmann H. Ryals J. Plant J. 1995; 8: 227-233Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar; Summermatter et al., 66Summermatter K. Sticher L. Métraux J.-P. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that H2O2 does not function downstream of SA (i.e. by inhibition of catalase) in the regulation of PR genes. However, catalase is still the subject of many mechanistic investigations. There is increasing evidence that catalase is a major factor in a variety of pathological states such as cancer, diabetes, aging, and oxidative stress (see DeLuca et al. (10DeLuca D.C. Dennis R. Smith W.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); Feuers et al. (17Feuers R.J. Patillo F.M. Osborn C.K. Adams K.L. DeLuca D. Smith W.G. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1993; 15: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)). Inactivation and reactivation of catalase in vivo and in vitro are far from being fully understood. Numerous recent publications suggest new approaches regarding in vitro assays and inhibition studies on catalase (Feuers et al., 17Feuers R.J. Patillo F.M. Osborn C.K. Adams K.L. DeLuca D. Smith W.G.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the present report, we provide new insights into SA's effects on catalase. SA acts as an electron donor for the peroxidative cycle of both plant and animal catalases. As such, it can protect as well as inhibit catalase activity, depending on the concentration of H2O2. It is hypothesized that, in healthy tissue of infected leaves where H2O2 levels are low, SA inhibits catalase, which could lead to activation of defense-related genes. In contrast, in infected cells and in tissue immediately adjacent to necrotizing cells, where high levels of H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species are produced, SA protects catalase from inactivation. This property of SA might serve to contain the oxidative damage associated with spread of the lesion and resembles closely some antioxidative properties of SA in activated HeLa cells or inflamed mammalian tissues, which are unrelated to inhibition of prostaglandin H synthase. Tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi nc) were grown at 22°C in growth chambers programmed for a 14-h light and 10-h dark cycle. 6-8-week-old plants were used for experimentation. SA, SA analogues, simple phenolic compounds, phlorizin (phloretin-2′-β-D-glucoside), and bumetanide (3-n-butylamino-4-phenoxy-5-sulfomoyl-benzoic acid) were purchased from Sigma or Aldrich. INA was kindly provided by Helmut Kessmann of CIBA-Geigy Ltd. (Basel, Switzerland). Catalase (H2O2:H2O2 oxidoreductase; EC 1.11.1.6) from Aspergillus niger, bovine liver, and human erythrocytes were from Sigma. The heme content of the various preparations varied only slightly (A405/A280 was between 0.78 and 0.90). Catalase activity was measured in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.6, at 24°C with a commercial oxygen electrode probe (model 5739; Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH). If not otherwise indicated, the reaction was started by the addition of H2O2 to 10 mM (assuming the absence of any remaining H2O2 after the pretreatment). Enzyme activity (i.e. oxygen production) was followed for 2-4 min. Catalase activity is expressed in units of mmol of H2O2 decomposed/min, based on the catalatic cycle in which two molecules of H2O2 are degraded per molecule of O2 generated. Alternatively, catalatic activity was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the consumption of H2O2 at 240 nm. The molar extinction of H2O2 at 240 nm was taken as 39.4 M−1 cm−1. The amount of enzyme added for the controls (without inhibitor/activator) was such that the decrease in A240 at 24°C occurred at a rate of 0.1 per min. Commercially available catalase enzymes were treated as described previously for horseradish peroxidase (Durner and Klessig, 14Durner J. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11312-11316Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). 1 mg of enzyme was dissolved in 1 ml of 200 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.2, containing 150 mM NaCl. Following a 15-min incubation at room temperature, the enzyme solution was centrifuged (10,000 × g, 10 min). After buffer exchange (NAP-10, Pharmacia Biotech Inc., equilibrated with 25 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.6), the protein concentration was adjusted to 0.5 mg/ml. Since peroxidase substrates such as guaiacol or pyrogallol are poor electron donors for catalase, its peroxidase reaction was measured by the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde, which was determined by the 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolone hydrazone test (Zamocky et al., 71Zamocky M. Herzog Ch. Nykyri L.M. Koller F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad microassay. Tissue homogenization and all precipitation and chromatography steps were performed at 4°C. 1.3 kg of tobacco leaves were homogenized in a blender in 2.6 liters of extraction buffer consisting of 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.6) containing 10% glycerol, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1 μM leupeptin, 10 μM antipain, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was filtered through four layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 15 min. Ammonium sulfate was added to 22% saturation, and the resulting suspension was stirred for an additional 1 h. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 25 min, the ammonium sulfate concentration of the supernatant was brought to 65% saturation. The pellet resulting from centrifugation (14,000 × g, 25 min) was resuspended in extraction buffer containing 25% glycerol and 1 mM dithiothreitol. At this point, the extract could be stored at −80°C until further use without significant loss of catalase activity (4820 mg of protein with a specific catalase activity of 0.098 units/mg, resulting in a total of 481 units). The thawed extract was fractionated with 0.8 volumes of 0°C ethanol/chloroform (3:1, v/v) containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The upper aqueous layer, which contained the catalase activity, was centrifuged at 47,000 × g for 25 min. The supernatant (121 mg of protein, 1.6 units/mg) was diluted 4-fold with 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.6, and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (5 × 12 cm, Pharmacia), equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing with several bed volumes, catalase activity was eluted by a ethylene glycol step (50%, v/v) in 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.6 (11 mg of protein with 16.4 units/mg). Catalase activity was precipitated by the addition of 3 volumes of 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.6, containing 90% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, and centrifugation at 47,000 × g for 25 min. After resuspension and buffer exchange (PD-10, Pharmacia) against 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.6, the sample was applied to a hydroxyapatite column (1 × 5 cm, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing (40 mM potassium phosphate), catalase was eluted with 200 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.6. After the addition of glycerol to a final concentration of 25%, the purified catalase (1.9 mg, 64.3 units/mg) could be stored at −80°C. A Mono P HR 5/20 column (Pharmacia) was connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system and equilibrated with 25 mM triethanolamine, adjusted to pH 8.2 with iminodiacetic acid (start buffer). Prior to application, the sample was exchanged in start buffer using a NAP-5 column (Pharmacia). The composition of the Mono P eluent was Polybuffer 96/Polybuffer 74 (Pharmacia) in a ratio of 3.5/6.5, resulting in a pH of 5.7. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and the fraction size was 0.5 ml. In order to obtain pools of catalase isozymes consisting of either subunit, preparative chromatofocusing with Polybuffer exchanger 94 (1 × 35 cm) was carried out under the conditions described above for the Mono P column. To analyze the redox states of catalase, spectra in the near UV region (Soret region, 360-450 nm) were scanned with a Beckman DU-7 spectrophotometer, using 1-ml semimicro black sidewall quartz cuvettes. The binding of NADPH by tobacco and mammalian catalase was assayed by fluorescence spectroscopy using a LS-3B/R 100A system (Perkin-Elmer) and 0.5-ml fluorescence cells. After excitation at 340 nm, emission spectra from 360-560 nm were recorded. Immediately before the measurements, commercially available enzymes were treated as described under “Enzyme Assays.” SDS-PAGE was performed with 10% (2.7% cross-linker) gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 or with silver nitrate using the Bio-Rad silver stain kit. For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and catalase was detected with a mixture of monoclonal antibodies (MAb3B6 and MAb1F5) made against tobacco catalase and with the ECL detection kit from DuPont (Chen et al., 5Chen Z. Silva H. Klessig D.F. Science. 1993; 262: 1883-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Horizontal isoelectric focusing was carried out on Ampholine gels, pH 5.5-8.5 (Pharmacia), at 50 mA for 1 h (270-1100 V), followed by 1650 V for 1.5 h. The samples were prepared by grinding tissue under liquid nitrogen (0.2 g/ml of extraction buffer as described for the large scale extraction of catalase). After centrifugation for 10 min, the homogenate was desalted (NAP-5) against 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.6. After focusing, gels were negatively stained for catalase activity using horseradish peroxidase and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as described by Mullen and Gifford (46Mullen R.T. Gifford D.J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The discovery that the SA-binding protein from tobacco was a catalase whose activity was inhibited by SA (Chen et al., 5Chen Z. Silva H. Klessig D.F. Science. 1993; 262: 1883-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar) prompted the question as to whether only a subset of the isoforms of this enzyme are sensitive to SA. In contrast to mammals, in plants catalase is encoded by a small gene family (Ni and Trelease, 48Ni W. Trelease R.N. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 737-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Scandalios, 61Scandalios J.G. Foyer C.H. Mullineaux P.M. Causes of Photooxidative Stress and Amelioration of Defense Systems in Plants. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 275-315Google Scholar; Willekens et al., 69Willekens H. Inzé D. Van Montagu M. Van Camp W. Mol. Breeding. 1995; 1: 207-228Crossref Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The active enzyme is a tetramer made up of four identical or similar subunits encoded by the same or different family members, respectively. Therefore, plants contain multiple isoforms of this enzyme. In tobacco, Zelitch et al. (72Zelitch I. Havir E.A. McGonigle B. McHale N.A. Nelson T. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 1592-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) identified at least 6 different isoforms, while Siminis et al. (64Siminis C.I. Kanellis A.K. Roubelakis-Angelakis K.A. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) detected 6-12 isoforms. We have extended this isoform analysis using purified tobacco leaf catalase. When purified tobacco catalase was subjected to analytical chromatofocusing on a Mono P column, multiple peaks were obtained (Fig. 1A). It should be noted that the use of purified catalase allowed for direct detection of the isoforms (absorbance at 280 nm), in contrast to an indirect approach based on an activity profile. At least 10 catalase species eluted between pH 7.6 and 6.0. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the most basic and most acidic isoforms consisted exclusively of larger (57-kDa) and smaller (55-kDa) subunits, respectively, whereas some intermediate isoforms in fractions 15-17 appeared to be heterotetramers (visible in the inset of Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the specific activity of homotetramers consisting only of 57-kDa subunits was much higher (124 units mg−1 for the pooled fractions 8-11, hereafter referred to as pool 1) than that of isoforms containing only the 55-kDa subunits (18.4 units mg−1 for the pooled fractions 19-21, hereafter referred to as pool 2). As a consequence, the elution profile shown in Fig. 1A does not reflect the distribution of catalase activity among the various isoforms (Fig. 1C). The relative catalase activity of selected fractions, as well as their sensitivity to SA is shown in Fig. 1C. Isoforms consisting only of large subunits accounted for 75-80% of the overall catalase activity. Catalase activity throughout the tested fractions was inhibited 36-51% by 1 mM SA. Thus, there appears to be little difference in SA sensitivity between isoforms, regardless of their subunit composition. In addition to degradation of H2O2 to H2O and O2, catalase has a peroxidative activity (see Fig. 3); the ratios of these two activities can differ substantially among isoforms (Havir and McHale, 26Havir E. McHale N.A. Plant Physiol. 1987; 84: 450-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Zamocky et al., 71Zamocky M. Herzog Ch. Nykyri L.M. Koller F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For tobacco leaf catalase, the ratios of the peroxidative activity to the catalatic activity were 0.42 × 10−4 for pool 1 and 4.5 × 10−4 for pool 2. Note that the peroxidative-like activity was measured with ethanol rather than with true peroxidase substrates such as guaiacol or pyrogallol, which are poor electron donors for catalase. When crude extracts from tobacco leaves were subjected to isoelectric focusing on nondenaturing gels followed by activity staining for catalase, 8-10 isoforms were detected (Fig. 2B). Thus, the number of isoforms in the purified catalase preparation closely matched that detected in crude extracts. Furthermore, we investigated the isozyme pattern of transgenic tobacco plants expressing the catalase 1 (cat1) or catalase 2 (cat2) gene in an antisense (AS) orientation (construction of the transgenic plants will be described elsewhere). 2H. Takahashi, Z. Chen, Y. Liu, and D. F. Klessig, unpublished results. ASCAT2 plants were devoid of the smaller (55-kDa) subunit (Fig. 2A) and did not contain the acidic isozymes (Fig. 2B). In ASCAT1 plants, the larger (57-kDa) subunit was absent. As a consequence, the majority of basic and neutral isoforms was missing. In agreement with the isoform pattern shown in Fig. 1, the larger subunit encoded by cat1 assembles into at least five different isoforms. The activity profile of the chromatofocused, purified catalase (Fig. 1C) mimics the catalase activity staining pattern of isoelectric focused crude extracts (Fig. 2B), with the majority of the activity represented by isoforms with neutral or basic isoelectric points and consisting of 57-kDa subunits. Therefore, the majority of the isoforms and their relative abundance appear to have been retained during purification. The first step in the catalase cycle (Fig. 3) involves a two-electron (e−) equivalent reduction of H2O2 to H2O and the corresponding oxidation of ferric enzyme (ferricatalase) to compound I, a spectroscopically distinct and enzymatically active form of catalase (for review see Deisseroth and Dounce (9Deisseroth A. Dounce A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1970; 50: 319-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar); Schonbaum and Chance (63Schonbaum, G. R., Chance, B., (1976) The Enzymes, (Boyer, P. D., ed), 2nd Ed., Vol. 13, pp. 363–408, Academic Press, Inc., New York.Google Scholar)). Compound I is converted back to ferricatalase by a 2e− equivalent reduction and the corresponding oxidation of a second molecule of H2O2 to O2, thus completing the extraordinarily rapid catalatic cycle (Fig. 3, steps 1 and 2). It is this “α activity” that makes catalase one of the fastest enzymes known. However, compound I can be siphoned from the catalatic cycle by its conversion into the inactive (with respect to the catalatic cycle) ferryl intermediate compound II through a 1e− equivalent reduction (Fig. 3, step 3). By a second 1e− equivalent reduction, compound II can be converted back to the ferricatalase (Fig. 3, step 4). Because of the slow turnover number of this peroxidative cycle (β activity), the activity of catalase depends on the relative frequency of conversion of compound I back to ferricatalase versus its conversion to inactive compound II (and the subsequent conversion of compound II to ferricatalase). Thus, any enhancement of the β activity, as described previously for phenolic compounds (Schonbaum and Chance, 63Schonbaum, G. R., Chance, B., (1976) The Enzymes, (Boyer, P. D., ed), 2nd Ed., Vol. 13, pp. 363–408, Academic Press, Inc., New York.Google Scholar), would result in inhibition of catalase activity. The effects of H2O2 and SA on catalase activity were analyzed (Fig. 4). In order to more closely mimic the in vivo situation where H2O2 is almost continuously being produced, low to mo"

(1995) FEBS Lett. 374, 1-5). Two novel bovine congeners have been deduced from cDNA. Their C-terminal sequences of 27 and 28 residues correspond to putative antimicrobial peptides with a cationic N-terminal region predicted to assume an amphipathic α-helical conformation followed by a hydrophobic C-terminal tail. Peptides corresponding to these sequences have been chemically synthesized and shown to exert a potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and fungi. Both peptides are also cytotoxic to human erythrocytes and neutrophils, although at higher than microbicidal concentrations. The target selectivity has been improved by synthesizing truncated analogues, comprising only the 18 N-terminal residues, which show a great reduction in cytotoxic, but not in antimicrobial activity. The involvement of the C-terminal hydrophobic tail in the cytotoxic activity has been further demonstrated by inducing a major loss of activity in an analogue after replacing highly hydrophobic residues with more hydrophilic ones.

Both show a potent and broad spectrum antimicrobial activity in vitro, that includes bacterial and fungal species, and are cytotoxic to human erythrocytes and neutrophils, although at concentrations much higher than those antimicrobial. Cytotoxicity to mammalian, but not microbial cells, is greatly reduced by shortening the two molecules at the C terminus. The cytotoxic effects on mammalian cells are largely mediated by the hydrophobic C-terminal residues, as shown by using a BMAP-28 analogue identical to the parent molecule except in the C-terminal region. We have thus identified two novel and potent antimicrobial peptides, and shown that removal of the C-terminal residues significantly increases their target specificity for microbial cells. These truncated BMAP analogues virtually devoid of cytotoxic activity are good candidates as leads to develop antibacterial and antifungal drugs.

https://openalex.org/W2166179228,"Osteopontin is an adhesive glycoprotein implicated in numerous diseases associated with inflammation and remodeling. There are several structural domains in osteopontin that are of particular interest. The RGD motif is a cell attachment sequence shown to be critical for cell adhesion through αv-containing integrins. In close proximity to the RGD domain is the thrombin cleavage site. Previous observations suggest that thrombin cleavage of osteopontin occurs in vivo and may be physiologically important. To study the functional significance of osteopontin cleavage by thrombin, we made glutathione S-transferase-osteopontin fusion proteins. These proteins contain either the N- or C-terminal domains expected to be formed following thrombin cleavage at the Arg169-Ser170 peptide bond. We compared these osteopontin fragments with native osteopontin in their ability to support adhesion of several different cell lines and identified the receptors mediating these interactions. Our data show that the N-terminal osteopontin fragment, which contains the RGD domain, supports adhesion of a melanoma cell line that is unable to bind native osteopontin. This suggests that osteopontin adhesive interactions may be regulated by thrombin cleavage. We also demonstrate that osteopontin contains a cryptic binding activity, which can be recognized by a novel osteopontin receptor. This receptor has been identified as the α9β1 integrin.

INTRODUCTIONOsteopontin is a multifunctional glycoprotein that promotes cell adhesion and migration. Previous studies have suggested that osteopontin plays a role in bone resorption, tumorigenesis, and metastasis (1Denhardt D.T. Guo X. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). More recently, osteopontin has been implicated in a number of disease states associated with inflammation and tissue remodeling (2Giachelli C.M. Bae N. Almeida M. Denhardt D.T. Alpers C.E.

Integrins are capable of generating signals that control many aspects of cell behavior including differentiation, adhesion, migration, and apoptosis (7Hynes R.O.

Giachelli C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 713-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and human embryonic kidney cells to osteopontin (14Hu D.D. Lin E.C.K. Kovach N.L. Hoyer J.R. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26232-26238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A weak interaction was also demonstrated between α4β1 and osteopontin in the macrophage line, P388D1 (15Nasu K. Ishida T. Setoguchi M. Higuchi Y. Akizuki S. Yamamoto S. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, occupancy of osteopontin with different receptors has distinct functional consequences. For example, in smooth muscle cells, αvβ3, αvβ1, and αvβ5 mediate adhesion, but only αvβ3 can support migration (12Liaw L. Skinner M.P. Raines E.W. Ross R. Cheresh D.A. Schwartz S.M. Giachelli C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 713-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Osteopontin contains several interesting structural domains. The RGD domain is an adhesive motif found in many matrix molecules (7Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar) and is critical for αv integrin-dependent cell adhesion and migration to osteopontin (12Liaw L. Skinner M.P.

Chambers A.F. J. Cell Biochem. 1995; 57: 680-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Osteopontin is also susceptible to proteolytic fragmentation. There are two conserved thrombin cleavage sites in human osteopontin. The major thrombin cleavage site is at residues Arg169-Ser170, which is 6 amino acids C-terminal from the RGD domain. A second potential thrombin-cleavage site is within the RGD domain (Arg160-Gly161) (17Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulos A. Anticancer Res. 1989; 9: 1291-1299PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that osteopontin proteolytic fragments are found in vivo and may have physiological importance (17Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulos A. Anticancer Res. 1989; 9: 1291-1299PubMed Google Scholar, 18Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulos A. Tenen D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 996: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In addition, both osteopontin and thrombin are likely to be localized together at sites of injury, inflammation, angiogenesis, and in tumors. The functional activity of cleaved osteopontin, however, is unclear. One report demonstrated that thrombin cleavage destroyed RGD-mediated cell adhesion (19Xuan J.W. Hota C. Chambers A.F. J. Cell Biochem. 1994; 54: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, a second report showed that thrombin treatment enhanced osteopontin cell adhesive activity (20Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulos-Sergiou A. Van de Water L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). One explanation for the discrepancy is that the interaction with osteopontin fragments may be mediated through distinct receptors in different cell types. A key to understanding the function of osteopontin, therefore, is identifying the receptors that interact with not only the full-length molecule, but with any functional proteolytic fragments.To study the functional significance of osteopontin fragmentation, we performed adhesion experiments using glutathione S-transferase-osteopontin (GST-OPN) 1The abbreviations used are: GSTglutathione S-transferaseOPNosteopontinmAbmonoclonal antibodyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBSAbovine serum albuminPBSphosphate-buffered salineFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorting. fusion proteins. For these studies, we created osteopontin peptides that contain either the N- or C-terminal domains expected to be formed following thrombin cleavage at the Arg169-Ser170 site, which is 6 amino acids C-terminal from the RGD adhesive motif. We compared the osteopontin fragments in their ability to support adhesion of several different cell lines with that of native osteopontin and identified the receptors mediating these interactions. These studies show that the N-terminal fragment of osteopontin contains a functional RGD domain recognized by αvβ3, as well as a cryptic adhesive sequence recognized by the α9β1 integrin.DISCUSSIONThis study examined the potential role of proteolytic fragmentation on osteopontin function. We compared the N- and C-terminal GST-recombinant osteopontin fragments expected to be formed following thrombin cleavage at the Arg169-Ser170 site with native osteopontin in their ability to mediate adhesion of several cell lines. The results demonstrated that: 1) osteopontin adhesive interactions may be regulated by proteolytic fragmentation such as seen with thrombin, 2) two different splice variants of the N-terminal osteopontin fragments have identical adhesive properties, and 3) N-terminal osteopontin fragment contains two distinct integrin-binding activities. One is the RGD-dependent αvβ3-binding activity. The second is a cryptic binding activity for the α9β1 integrin. Thus, proteolytic fragmentation may be a way of controlling or altering osteopontin's receptor specificity and thus its function.Using N- and C-terminal recombinant fragments, we have shown that two splice variants of the N-terminal, but not the C-terminal, domain can support adhesion of bovine aortic endothelial cells and two subpopulations of human melanoma cell lines. The two subpopulations of melanoma cells differ in αv integrin expression. Moαv contains high levels of the αvβ3 integrin. Mo lacks expression of the αv subunit. Because these cells lack αv, they fail to express any of the known osteopontin receptors and do not adhere to native osteopontin. It was therefore surprising to find that the Mo cells could attach to the N-terminal osteopontin fragment. Mo cells also failed to adhere to the human recombinant full-length osteopontin, indicating that the difference in adhesion of Mo cells to native osteopontin and N-terminal recombinant fragment was not simply due to glycosylation or phosphorylation. These results suggested that the adhesion of Mo cells was through a non-αv osteopontin receptor and that a cryptic adhesive activity was exposed in the N-terminal osteopontin peptide fragment.Further analysis demonstrated that the two subpopulations of melanoma cells adhered to the N-terminal fragment with different receptors and bound distinct adhesive domains. Moαv cells adhered to the N-terminal fragment through the αvβ3 integrin. This interaction was RGD-dependent. Mo cells, which lack αv and fail to bind the native protein, adhered to the N-terminal fragment through the α9β1 integrin. In addition, human urinary osteopontin that was cleaved with thrombin in situ also supported α9β1-mediated adhesion of Mo cells. 2L. L. Smith, H.-K. Cheung, L. E. Ling, J. Chen, D. Sheppard, R. Pytela, and C. M. Giachelli, unpublished observations. The interaction of α9β1 with the N-terminal fragment was less effectively blocked by RGD peptides, suggesting there may be an additional adhesive domain distinct from RGD. A non-RGD adhesion function for osteopontin has previously been reported. A fragment from endoproteinase Arg-C-digested rat osteopontin, which lacked the RGD domain, supported adhesion of human fibroblasts (42van Dijk S. D'Errico J.A. Somerman M.J. Farach-Carson M.C. Butler W.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1499-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, in this study, the activity was found in the C-terminal half of the molecule; therefore, this potential adhesive domain must be distinct from the α9β1 site found in the N-terminal half of osteopontin.The only other known ligand for α9β1 is tenascin (41Yokosaki Y. Palmer E.L. Prieto A.L. Crossin K.L. Bourdon M.A. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26691-26696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like osteopontin, the α9β1 binding domain in tenascin appears to be distinct from the RGD adhesion motif (41Yokosaki Y. Palmer E.L. Prieto A.L. Crossin K.L. Bourdon M.A. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26691-26696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, Mo adhesion to the osteopontin fragment is at least partially inhibited by RGD, suggesting that either α9β1 recognizes osteopontin and tenascin by somewhat different mechanisms or that other RGD-dependent receceptors are involved.In normal adult tissue, osteopontin and α9 are expressed on most epithelia and could potentially colocalize (34Palmer E.L. Ruegg C. Ferrando R. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 43Brown L.F. Berse B. Van de Water L. Papadopoulos Sergiou A. Perruzzi C.A.

Cytochem. 1995; 43: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In diseased tissue, osteopontin is highly up-regulated. Abundant osteopontin is found at the interface between malignant and normal tissue and at sites of inflammation and tissue remodeling (5Giachelli C.M. Schwartz S.M. Liaw L. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1995; 5: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 46Senger D.R. Brown L.F. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulos-Sergiou A. Van de Water L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 760: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These are also sites where thrombin and thrombin-cleaved fragments of osteopontin are likely to be found. It would be interesting if α9 is coordinately up-regulated at these sites. If so, the ability of osteopontin to promote adhesion, migration, or other cellular functions may be regulated in the presence of thrombin by exposing the cryptic domain.Cryptic integrin-mediated binding activities have also been identified in other adhesive proteins. For example, laminin contains a cryptic peptide site that becomes functional after proteolysis and supports αvβ3-mediated adhesion of rat osteoclasts (47Horton M.A. Spragg J.H. Bodary S.C. Helfrich M.H. Bone. 1994; 15: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Collagen also contains a cyptic site that is exposed following denaturation. Native type I collagen in its helical conformation supports α1β1-, α2β1-, and α3β1-meditated adhesion. These interactions are disrupted by heating or proteolysis of collagen, revealing a cryptic αvβ3 binding activity (48Montgomery A.M.P. Reisfeld R.A. Cheresh D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8856-8860Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The exposure of novel binding activities following proteolytic fragmentation is particularly relevant in remodeling tissues where proteases are active.Both Mo and Moαv express equal amounts of surface α9 integrin, but only the Mo cells use this receptor for N-terminal osteopontin interactions. There are several possible explanations for this phenomenon. First, the activation state of α9β1 on the two cell lines may differ. It is known that β1 integrins can exist in different activation states, which can affect the affinity of ligand binding (49Kovach N.L. Carlos T.M. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 50Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 228-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Gailit J.

Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 3011-3018PubMed Google Scholar). The second possibility is that α9β1 function could be regulated by the ligation of another integrin. For example, the interaction of αvβ3 with ligand could transmit a signal that inhibits the affinity modulation and/or function of α9β1. This type of “cross-talk” between integrins has previously been reported in several cell types (53Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. LaFlamme S.E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 54Pacifici R. Roman J. Kimble R. Civitelli R. Brownfield C.M. Bizzarri C. J.

Immunol. 1993; 151: 3324-3336PubMed Google Scholar).Two previous reports have examined the functional consequences of osteopontin cleavage with thrombin. One report demonstrated that thrombin cleavage destroyed RGD-mediated adhesion (19Xuan J.W. Hota C. Chambers A.F. J. Cell Biochem. 1994; 54: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, a second report showed that thrombin treatment enhanced osteopontin-mediated adhesion (20Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulos-Sergiou A. Van de Water L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In agreement with the second report, our studies demonstrate that the N-terminal fragment that is expected to be formed following thrombin cleavage can support adhesion. It is clear from these studies as well as others that the interaction of cells with osteopontin and osteopontin fragments is mediated through distinct receptors in different cell types. This could explain the discrepancy between different studies. Another possible explanation is that the conditions used to cleave osteopontin with thrombin may result in partial or complete proteolysis at an additional thrombin cleavage site. A second potential cleavage site is at residues Arg160-Gly161, which is within the RGD domain. If the RGD were destroyed by proteolytic cleavage, it is likely that αvβ3-mediated interactions would not take place.There are several different splice variants of osteopontin. Two of the variants are due to variable usage of exon 5, which contains 14 amino acids. The functional significance of alternative splicing in this gene is not known. In this study we compared the adhesive function of recombinant osteopontin N-terminal fragments of each splice variant. Our results demonstrate that both splice variants had identical adhesive functions. Exon 5 contains the sequence NAVSSEETNDFKQE. The two serine residues are potential sites for phosphorylation or O-linked glycosylation; therefore, our data do not rule out the possibility that there is a functional difference following post-translational modification.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the N-terminal fragment of osteopontin contains two distinct activities. We predict from these results that osteopontin fragmentation by proteases, such as thrombin, are important in the regulation of receptor specificity and, thus, the function of osteopontin. INTRODUCTIONOsteopontin is a multifunctional glycoprotein that promotes cell adhesion and migration. Previous studies have suggested that osteopontin plays a role in bone resorption, tumorigenesis, and metastasis (1Denhardt D.T. Guo X. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). More recently, osteopontin has been implicated in a number of disease states associated with inflammation and tissue remodeling (2Giachelli C.M. Bae N. Almeida M. Denhardt D.T. Alpers C.E.

Integrins are capable of generating signals that control many aspects of cell behavior including differentiation, adhesion, migration, and apoptosis (7Hynes R.O.

Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar) and is critical for αv integrin-dependent cell adhesion and migration to osteopontin (12Liaw L. Skinner M.P.

Chambers A.F. J. Cell Biochem. 1995; 57: 680-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Osteopontin is also susceptible to proteolytic fragmentation. There are two conserved thrombin cleavage sites in human osteopontin. The major thrombin cleavage site is at residues Arg169-Ser170, which is 6 amino acids C-terminal from the RGD domain. A second potential thrombin-cleavage site is within the RGD domain (Arg160-Gly161) (17Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulos A. Anticancer Res. 1989; 9: 1291-1299PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that osteopontin proteolytic fragments are found in vivo and may have physiological importance (17Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulos A. Anticancer Res. 1989; 9: 1291-1299PubMed Google Scholar, 18Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulos A. Tenen D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 996: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In addition, both osteopontin and thrombin are likely to be localized together at sites of injury, inflammation, angiogenesis, and in tumors. The functional activity of cleaved osteopontin, however, is unclear. One report demonstrated that thrombin cleavage destroyed RGD-mediated cell adhesion (19Xuan J.W. Hota C. Chambers A.F. J. Cell Biochem. 1994; 54: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, a second report showed that thrombin treatment enhanced osteopontin cell adhesive activity (20Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulos-Sergiou A. Van de Water L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). One explanation for the discrepancy is that the interaction with osteopontin fragments may be mediated through distinct receptors in different cell types. A key to understanding the function of osteopontin, therefore, is identifying the receptors that interact with not only the full-length molecule, but with any functional proteolytic fragments. To study the functional significance of osteopontin fragmentation, we performed adhesion experiments using glutathione S-transferase-osteopontin (GST-OPN) 1The abbreviations used are: GSTglutathione S-transferaseOPNosteopontinmAbmonoclonal antibodyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBSAbovine serum albuminPBSphosphate-buffered salineFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorting. fusion proteins. For these studies, we created osteopontin peptides that contain either the N- or C-terminal domains expected to be formed following thrombin cleavage at the Arg169-Ser170 site, which is 6 amino acids C-terminal from the RGD adhesive motif. We compared the osteopontin fragments in their ability to support adhesion of several different cell lines with that of native osteopontin and identified the receptors mediating these interactions. These studies show that the N-terminal fragment of osteopontin contains a functional RGD domain recognized by αvβ3, as well as a cryptic adhesive sequence recognized by the α9β1 integrin. glutathione S-transferase osteopontin monoclonal antibody polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis bovine serum albumin phosphate-buffered saline fluorescence-activated cell sorting. DISCUSSIONThis study examined the potential role of proteolytic fragmentation on osteopontin function. We compared the N- and C-terminal GST-recombinant osteopontin fragments expected to be formed following thrombin cleavage at the Arg169-Ser170 site with native osteopontin in their ability to mediate adhesion of several cell lines. The results demonstrated that: 1) osteopontin adhesive interactions may be regulated by proteolytic fragmentation such as seen with thrombin, 2) two different splice variants of the N-terminal osteopontin fragments have identical adhesive properties, and 3) N-terminal osteopontin fragment contains two distinct integrin-binding activities. One is the RGD-dependent αvβ3-binding activity. The second is a cryptic binding activity for the α9β1 integrin. Thus, proteolytic fragmentation may be a way of controlling or altering osteopontin's receptor specificity and thus its function.Using N- and C-terminal recombinant fragments, we have shown that two splice variants of the N-terminal, but not the C-terminal, domain can support adhesion of bovine aortic endothelial cells and two subpopulations of human melanoma cell lines. The two subpopulations of melanoma cells differ in αv integrin expression. Moαv contains high levels of the αvβ3 integrin. Mo lacks expression of the αv subunit. Because these cells lack αv, they fail to express any of the known osteopontin receptors and do not adhere to native osteopontin. It was therefore surprising to find that the Mo cells could attach to the N-terminal osteopontin fragment. Mo cells also failed to adhere to the human recombinant full-length osteopontin, indicating that the difference in adhesion of Mo cells to native osteopontin and N-terminal recombinant fragment was not simply due to glycosylation or phosphorylation. These results suggested that the adhesion of Mo cells was through a non-αv osteopontin receptor and that a cryptic adhesive activity was exposed in the N-terminal osteopontin peptide fragment.Further analysis demonstrated that the two subpopulations of melanoma cells adhered to the N-terminal fragment with different receptors and bound distinct adhesive domains. Moαv cells adhered to the N-terminal fragment through the αvβ3 integrin. This interaction was RGD-dependent. Mo cells, which lack αv and fail to bind the native protein, adhered to the N-terminal fragment through the α9β1 integrin. In addition, human urinary osteopontin that was cleaved with thrombin in situ also supported α9β1-mediated adhesion of Mo cells. 2L. L. Smith, H.-K. Cheung, L. E. Ling, J. Chen, D. Sheppard, R. Pytela, and C. M. Giachelli, unpublished observations. The interaction of α9β1 with the N-terminal fragment was less effectively blocked by RGD peptides, suggesting there may be an additional adhesive domain distinct from RGD. A non-RGD adhesion function for osteopontin has previously been reported. A fragment from endoproteinase Arg-C-digested rat osteopontin, which lacked the RGD domain, supported adhesion of human fibroblasts (42van Dijk S. D'Errico J.A. Somerman M.J. Farach-Carson M.C. Butler W.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1499-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, in this study, the activity was found in the C-terminal half of the molecule; therefore, this potential adhesive domain must be distinct from the α9β1 site found in the N-terminal half of osteopontin.The only other known ligand for α9β1 is tenascin (41Yokosaki Y. Palmer E.L. Prieto A.L. Crossin K.L. Bourdon M.A. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26691-26696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like osteopontin, the α9β1 binding domain in tenascin appears to be distinct from the RGD adhesion motif (41Yokosaki Y. Palmer E.L. Prieto A.L. Crossin K.L. Bourdon M.A. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26691-26696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, Mo adhesion to the osteopontin fragment is at least partially inhibited by RGD, suggesting that either α9β1 recognizes osteopontin and tenascin by somewhat different mechanisms or that other RGD-dependent receceptors are involved.In normal adult tissue, osteopontin and α9 are expressed on most epithelia and could potentially colocalize (34Palmer E.L. Ruegg C. Ferrando R. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 43Brown L.F. Berse B. Van de Water L. Papadopoulos Sergiou A. Perruzzi C.A.

Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 12: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 45Stepp M.A. Zhu L. Sheppard D. Cranfill R.L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In diseased tissue, osteopontin is highly up-regulated. Abundant osteopontin is found at the interface between malignant and normal tissue and at sites of inflammation and tissue remodeling (5Giachelli C.M. Schwartz S.M. Liaw L. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1995; 5: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 46Senger D.R. Brown L.F. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulos-Sergiou A. Van de Water L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 760: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These are also sites where thrombin and thrombin-cleaved fragments of osteopontin are likely to be found. It would be interesting if α9 is coordinately up-regulated at these sites. If so, the ability of osteopontin to promote adhesion, migration, or other cellular functions may be regulated in the presence of thrombin by exposing the cryptic domain.Cryptic integrin-mediated binding activities have also been identified in other adhesive proteins. For example, laminin contains a cryptic peptide site that becomes functional after proteolysis and supports αvβ3-mediated adhesion of rat osteoclasts (47Horton M.A. Spragg J.H. Bodary S.C. Helfrich M.H. Bone. 1994; 15: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Collagen also contains a cyptic site that is exposed following denaturation. Native type I collagen in its helical conformation supports α1β1-, α2β1-, and α3β1-meditated adhesion. These interactions are disrupted by heating or proteolysis of collagen, revealing a cryptic αvβ3 binding activity (48Montgomery A.M.P. Reisfeld R.A. Cheresh D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8856-8860Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The exposure of novel binding activities following proteolytic fragmentation is particularly relevant in remodeling tissues where proteases are active.Both Mo and Moαv express equal amounts of surface α9 integrin, but only the Mo cells use this receptor for N-terminal osteopontin interactions. There are several possible explanations for this phenomenon. First, the activation state of α9β1 on the two cell lines may differ. It is known that β1 integrins can exist in different activation states, which can affect the affinity of ligand binding (49Kovach N.L. Carlos T.M. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 50Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 228-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Gailit J.

Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 3011-3018PubMed Google Scholar). The second possibility is that α9β1 function could be regulated by the ligation of another integrin. For example, the interaction of αvβ3 with ligand could transmit a signal that inhibits the affinity modulation and/or function of α9β1. This type of “cross-talk” between integrins has previously been reported in several cell types (53Blystone S.D. Lindberg F.P. LaFlamme S.E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 54Pacifici R. Roman J. Kimble R. Civitelli R. Brownfield C.M. Bizzarri C. J.

One report demonstrated that thrombin cleavage destroyed RGD-mediated adhesion (19Xuan J.W. Hota C. Chambers A.F. J. Cell Biochem. 1994; 54: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).

In agreement with the second report, our studies demonstrate that the N-terminal fragment that is expected to be formed following thrombin cleavage can support adhesion. It is clear from these studies as well as others that the interaction of cells with osteopontin and osteopontin fragments is mediated through distinct receptors in different cell types. This could explain the discrepancy between different studies. Another possible explanation is that the conditions used to cleave osteopontin with thrombin may result in partial or complete proteolysis at an additional thrombin cleavage site. A second potential cleavage site is at residues Arg160-Gly161, which is within the RGD domain. If the RGD were destroyed by proteolytic cleavage, it is likely that αvβ3-mediated interactions would not take place.There are several different splice variants of osteopontin. Two of the variants are due to variable usage of exon 5, which contains 14 amino acids. The functional significance of alternative splicing in this gene is not known. In this study we compared the adhesive function of recombinant osteopontin N-terminal fragments of each splice variant. Our results demonstrate that both splice variants had identical adhesive functions. Exon 5 contains the sequence NAVSSEETNDFKQE. The two serine residues are potential sites for phosphorylation or O-linked glycosylation; therefore, our data do not rule out the possibility that there is a functional difference following post-translational modification.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the N-terminal fragment of osteopontin contains two distinct activities. We predict from these results that osteopontin fragmentation by proteases, such as thrombin, are important in the regulation of receptor specificity and, thus, the function of osteopontin. This study examined the potential role of proteolytic fragmentation on osteopontin function.

Here, we report on the isolation and initial characterization of the CYP1B1 gene. The CYP1B1 gene maps to human chromosome 2 at 2p21-22 and contains three exons and two introns. The putative open reading frame starts in the second exon and is 1629 base pairs in length. Southern analysis using DNA probes directed to each of the three exons confirmed that CYP1B1 is a single copy gene. Human CYP1B1 differs from its two most closely related members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, in the number of exons (3 versus 7) and chromosome location (2 versus 15). A single transcription initiation site was identified by primer extension analysis and S1 nuclease mapping. Based on nucleotide sequence analysis, the CYP1B1 gene lacks a consensus TATA box in the promoter region and contains nine TCDD-responsive enhancer core binding motifs (5′-GCGTG-3′) located within a 2.5-kilobase pair genomic fragment 5′-ward of the transcription initiation start site. Deletion analysis of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene constructs containing 5′ CYP1B1 genomic fragments indicates that a region from −1022 to −835 containing three of the nine core binding motifs contributes to the TCDD-inducible expression of CYP1B1.

Biol. 1994; 51: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).The cytochrome P450 gene superfamily contains 70 gene families found in bacteria, plants, yeast, insects, and vertebrates (Ref. 16Gonzalez F.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1989; 40: 243-288Google Scholar; GenBank™). There are 14 mammalian families. Of these, five have multiple subfamilies. The P4501 family was previously thought to be composed of two members, designated CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 (16Gonzalez F.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1989; 40: 243-288Google Scholar). These genes are ubiquitous in mammals and have similar catabolic activity toward a variety of xenobiotics. CYP1B1 is the third and newest member of this family, representing a second subfamily (2Sutter T.R. Guzman K. Dold K.M. Greenlee W.F. Science. 1991; 254: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of a 12-kb human genomic DNA fragment that contains the entire CYP1B1 gene and includes both 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences.DISCUSSIONThe results presented here on the sequence, mapping, and regulation of the human CYP1B1 gene confirm and extend our previous analysis on this cytochrome P450 (7Sutter T.R. Tang Y.M. Hayes C.L. Wo Y.-Y.P. Jabs E.W. Li X. Yin H. Cody C.W. Greenlee W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13092-13099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CYP1B1 is likely a single gene subfamily of the CYP1 family (Fig. 2; Ref. 7Sutter T.R. Tang Y.M. Hayes C.L. Wo Y.-Y.P. Jabs E.W. Li X. Yin H. Cody C.W. Greenlee W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13092-13099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although CYP1B1, CYP1A1, and CYP1A2 most likely evolved from the same ancestral gene, CYP1B1 maps to human chromosome 2 (Fig. 3; Ref. 7Sutter T.R. Tang Y.M. Hayes C.L. Wo Y.-Y.P. Jabs E.W. Li X. Yin H. Cody C.W. Greenlee W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13092-13099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 map to human chromosome 15 (11Walker N.J. Gastel J.A. Costa L.T. Clark G.C. Lucier G.W. Sutter T.R. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the CYP1B1 subfamily separated from the CYP1A family approximately 300 million years ago (39Nelson D.R. Strobel H.W. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 572-593PubMed Google Scholar).High resolution chromosome mapping indicates that CYP1B1 is located at 2p21-22 on human chromosome 2 (Fig. 3). It is interesting that genes known to be involved in development, signal transduction, and hormone responsiveness map to this same region. These include holoprosencephaly-2, son of sevenless (homolog 1), calmodulin 2, and luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor. Although the precise location of CYP1B1 relative to these genes is not known at this time, its relative proximity to them in 2p21-22 suggests a possible biological role for this P450 isozyme in the activation or inactivation of endogenous effectors of development, hormone-responsive pathways, or both.The CYP1B1 gene has a single TIS in the absence of a consensus TATA box. For other genes, it has been shown that either a TATA box or a conserved sequence at the transcription start site called an initiator is required for accurate transcription (40Reznikoff W.S. Siegele D.A. Cowing D.W. Groww C.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1985; 19: 335-387Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 41Smale S.T. Schmidt M.C. Berk A.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). For CYP1B1, an initiator sequence (TTGACTCT) flanking the TIS (−3 to +5 bp) can be found that closely matches the conserved initiator sequence (PyPyAn(T/A)PyPy) reported for terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (41Smale S.T. Schmidt M.C. Berk A.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Of 11 Sp1 binding sequences identified in the 5′-flanking region of CYP1B1, 2 are located near the TIS at −68 and −89 (Fig. 5), which is an optimal distance for an Sp1-dependent promoter (41Smale S.T. Schmidt M.C. Berk A.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Each of these functional modalities identified on the basis of nucleotide sequence has been shown to play a role in the accuracy and efficiency of transcription of the CYP1B1 promoter. 3P. Wo, J. Stewart, and W. F. Greenlee, submitted for publication. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 5′-flanking region of the CYP1B1 gene indicates the presence of nine DRE core recognition motifs (GCGTG) between −260 and −2320 (Fig. 5). These DRE core motifs represent potential sites of interaction with the activated AhR/ARNT heterodimer, which mediates the transcriptional activation of certain genes by TCDD (42Whitlock J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 251-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 43Fisher J.M. Wu L. Denison M.S. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9676-9681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the DRE motifs indentified in this region, four were found in the first intron, three were found in the coding region of the second exon, and five were found in the second intron. The significance of intronic DRE motifs and exonic motifs located in transcribed mRNA is not known at this time.In our previous studies (2Sutter T.R. Guzman K. Dold K.M. Greenlee W.F. Science. 1991; 254: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), the treatment of SCC12(c12c2) cells with TCDD resulted in a 2-3-fold increase in the rate of transcription of CYP1B1, as judged from nuclear runoff experiments, and in a >50-fold increase in transcript accumulation. Using a transient transfection assay, we have identified a dioxin-responsive region from −1022 to −835 (relative to the TIS) containing three DREs in the human CYP1B1 gene. The mechanism accounting for the TCDD-dependent enhancement in CAT gene activity contributed from this region is under investigation. It is reasonable to propose that at least one of these three DRE motifs may interact weakly with activated AhR/ARNT complex to confer the observed enhancement of CYP1B1 expression through a synergistic effect with certain transcription factors, such as Sp1. It has been demonstrated that the presence of Sp1 binding sequences in the murine CYP1A1 gene (43Fisher J.M. Wu L. Denison M.S. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9676-9681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) significantly augmented the response to TCDD. Although no consensus Sp1 binding motif (GGGCGG) was found in the TCDD-responsive region for the CYP1B1 gene, three copies of GGGTGG motifs were identified. The GGGTGG motif has been identified as the Sp1-binding site in the promoters of several genes (44Robidoux S. Gosselin P. Harrey M. Leclerc S. Guerin S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3796-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 45Kim S.-J. Onwuta U.S. Lee Y.I. Li R. Botchan M.R. Bobbins P.D. Mol. Cell.

Because the affinity for Sp1 could be increased significantly with multiple repeats of the GGGTGG motif and thus result in high transcriptional activation (43Fisher J.M. Wu L. Denison M.S. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9676-9681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that the three GGGTGG motifs in this region of CYP1B1 might also participate in the TCDD-dependent transcriptional activation.

In contrast, the bacterial sialyltransferases involved in the synthesis of α-2,3-sialylated lacto-N-neotetraose from N. gonorrhoeae or N. meningitidis and the enzyme(s) involved in the sialylation of lipopolysaccharide from C. jejuni have not been purified nor their genes cloned to date. There have been several reports of measurement of the sialyltransferase activity in Neisseria species (3Rest R. Mandrell R.E. Microb. Pathog. 1995; 19: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 5Mandrell R.E. Griffiss J.M. Smith H. Cole J.A. Microb. Pathog. 1993; 14: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the enzyme uses the same sugar nucleotide donor, CMP-Neu5Ac, as all the mammalian enzymes. They also appear to be solubilized by Triton X-100, which suggests a membrane association (5Mandrell R.E. Griffiss J.M. Smith H. Cole J.A. Microb. Pathog. 1993; 14: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Mandrell R.E. Smith H. Jarvis G.A. Griffiss J.M. Cole J.A. Microb. Pathog. 1993; 14: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and to be low abundance proteins that so far have eluded purification to homogeneity. Attempts have been made to clone these prokaryotic sialyltransferases using nucleic acid probes based on the mammalian “sialyl motif” or using complete mammalian genes (Ref. 3Rest R. Mandrell R.E. Microb. Pathog. 1995; 19: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar and references within), but none of these attempts has revealed a sialyltransferase gene. Recently N. gonorrhoeae mutants defective in LOS sialylation have been described (7Bramley J. de Hormaeche R.D. Constantinidou C. Nassif X. Parsons N. Jones P. Smith H. Cole J. Microb. Pathog. 1995; 18: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), but these have not so far enabled the structural gene for the LOS sialyltransferase to be identified. Here we describe the first cloning and characterization of a CMP-Neu5Ac:β-galactoside α-2,3-sialyltransferase from the pathogens N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae achieved by the use of a highly sensitive screening procedure based on the expression of enzyme activity. The following N. meningitidis strains were used in this study: immunotype L3 MC58 (NRCC 4728); immunotype L3 406Y (NRCC 4030); and immunotype L7 M982B (NRCC 4725). DNA from N. gonorrhoeae F62 (ATCC 33084) was a kind gift from Dr. Wendy Johnson (Health Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada). Plasmid DNA isolation, restriction enzyme digestions, purification of DNA fragments for cloning, ligations, and transformations, and DNA sequencing were performed as recommended by the enzyme supplier or the manufacturer of the kit used for the particular procedure. PCR was performed with Pwo polymerase as described by the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim). Restriction and DNA modification enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs Ltd. (Mississauga ON, Canada). Qiaprep columns were from Qiagen Inc. (Chatsworth, CA). DNA sequencing was performed with an Applied Biosystems (Montreal, Canada) model 370A automated DNA sequencer using the manufacturer's cycle sequencing kit. DNA sequence analysis and protein alignments were performed with the Genetics Computer Group suite of programs (Madison, WI). The genomic library was prepared using 3-5-kb fragments from a HaeIII partial digest of the chromosomal DNA of N. meningitidis MC58 into λZAPII (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as the vector (8Jennings M.P. Hood D.W. Peak I.R.A. Virji M. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The λZAPII library was plated at low density, and 3600-well isolated plaques were picked in pools of 100. Phage suspensions were made as described previously (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and used to infect 1.5-ml cultures of E. coli XL1-Blue (in LB medium with 0.2% maltose, 10 mM MgSO4, and 2 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside), which were grown for 4.5 h. Toluene was added to 1%, and the cells were then assayed for sialyltransferase activity as described below. The positive pools were plated, and then plaques were picked in pools of five and analyzed again for activity. Positive pools of five were then used to isolate individual clones expressing sialyltransferase activity. Phagemids carrying the sialyltransferase gene were excised from the positive λZAPII clones using the ExAssist helper phage and the SOLR E. coli strain as described by the supplier Stratagene. The DNA sequence for the 2.0-kb insert of this first plasmid (pNST-01) was determined, and PCR primers based on this sequence were used to amplify the genes from DNA prepared from N. meningitidis 406Y, M982B, and N. gonorrhoeae F62. The primer sequences were 5′ primer SIALM-5F, (nucleotides 540-569 in pNST-01 insert sequence, NdeI site shown in bold italics) 43-mer: 5′-CTTAGGAGGTCATATGTTCAATTTGTCGGAATGGAGTTTTAGG-3′, and 3′ primer SIALM-16R, (nucleotides 1688-1658 of pNST-01 insert sequence, SalI site shown in bold italics) 42-mer: 5′-CCTAGGTCGACTCATTAA TTTTTATCGTCAAATGTCAAAATC-3′. The gene product was detected in E. coli by first constructing a plasmid consisting of the lst open reading frame from pNST-01 and the peptide tag for immunodetection with anti-c-myc antibody as described previously (10MacKenzie C.R. Sharma V. Brummel D. Bilous D. Dubuc G. Sadowska J. Young N.M. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This construct was made using the following primers for PCR amplification, 5′ end primer was the standard M13 “reverse” primer, and 3′ end primer SIALM-18R (SalI site in italics, and the c-myc tag in bold): 5′-CCTAGGTCGACTCATTAGTTCAGGTCTTCTTCGCTGATCAGTTTTTGTTCATTTTTATCGTCAAATGTCAAAATCGGG-3′ 78-mer. The PCR product was cloned in the vector pT7-7 (11Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar), and protein expression was then induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. Western blotting was performed as described previously (10MacKenzie C.R. Sharma V. Brummel D. Bilous D. Dubuc G. Sadowska J. Young N.M. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The sialyltransferase activity from N. meningitidis MC58 L3, 406Y L3, and M982B L7 and E. coli carrying pNST plasmids was measured in toluene-treated cells or cell-free extracts prepared as described previously (12Wakarchuk W.W. Martin A. Jennings M.P. Moxon E.R. Richards J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19166-19173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The sialyltransferase acceptors were derived from aminophenylglycosides reacted with 6(5-fluorescein-carboxamido)-hexanoic acid succimidyl ester (FCHASE) and were prepared as described previously (12Wakarchuk W.W. Martin A. Jennings M.P. Moxon E.R. Richards J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19166-19173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Reactions for the enzyme were performed at 37°C in 20 μl of 50 mM MES buffer, pH 6.0, 10 mM MnCl2, with 0.2 or 1.0 mM labeled acceptor, 0.2 mM CMP-Neu5Ac donor, and various amounts of enzyme, from either crude bacterial extracts or extracts of recombinant E. coli with the cloned gene. The recombinant enzymes were assayed for 10-120 min, whereas extracts from N. meningitidis were incubated 1-15 h. The reactions were terminated by diluting the reaction 1:100 with 10 mM NaOH. These samples were then diluted appropriately in water prior to analysis by capillary electrophoresis. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) was performed with a Beckman (Fullerton, CA) P/ACE 5510 equipped with a 3 mW Argon-ion laser-induced fluorescence detector (λ excitation = 488 nm; λ emission = 520 nm). The capillary was bare silica 75 μm × 47 cm, with the detector at 40 cm. The capillary was conditioned before each run by washing with 0.2 M NaOH for 2 min, water for 2 min, and 25 mM sodium tetraborate, pH 9.4, for 2 min. Samples were introduced by pressure injection for 2-5 s, and the separation was performed at 15 kV, 75 μA. Peak integration was performed with the Beckman System Gold (version 8.1) software. For rapid detection of enzyme activity, samples from the transferase reaction mixtures were examined by thin layer chromatography on silica-60 TLC plates (Merck). A spot of 0.5-1.0 μl from the reaction was air dried, and the plate was developed with ethyl acetate/methanol/water/acetic acid (7:2:1:0.1). After drying, the acceptor and product spots could be seen by illumination of the plate with a 365 nm UV lamp. The product Rf under these conditions was 0.05. Preparative enzyme reactions were performed as coupled enzyme reactions with the cloned N. meningitidis CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase. 2M. Gilbert and W. Wakarchuk, unpublished data. The reactions contained 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, and 10 mM MgCl2, 400 milliunits/ml of CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase, 300 milliunits/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase (Sigma), 1.5 mM CTP, 1.5 mM Neu5Ac, and 50 milliunits of sialyltransferase (based on FCHASE-aminophenyl-LacNAc as the acceptor). The acceptor, FCHASE-aminophenyl-Lac or FCHASE-aminophenyl-LacNAc, was dried down in the tube under vacuum, and the reagents were then added to the tube; the concentration of FCHASE-aminophenylglycoside in these reactions was 1 mM. These reactions were performed at 30°C for 3-5 h. After the reaction, the FCHASE-aminophenylglycoside was bound to a Sep-Pak C18 reverse phase cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA), desalted by washing with water, and then eluted in 50% acetonitrile. The product from a preparative sialyltransferase reaction was examined by NMR. Samples for NMR were prepared by the TLC method and were then freeze dried from D2O three times prior to collection of the spectra. Prior to lyophilization and exchange with D2O, the pH of the sample was adjusted to 7. NMR data collection was performed with a Bruker AMX 600 spectrometer. Spectra were recorded at 300 K in 5-mm tubes at a concentration of 0.5 mg of FCHASE-aminophenylglycoside in 0.6 ml of D2O. Chemical shifts in ppm are relative to the methyl resonance of acetone set at 2.225 ppm for 1H and 31.07 ppm for 13C. All NMR experiments and spectral analysis were performed as described previously (13Pavliak V. Brisson J.-R. Michon F. Uhrin D. Jennings H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14146-14152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initial part of this work was performed with the N. meningitidis strain 406Y L3, which possesses an LOS identical to that of strain MC58 but has a different capsular type. Both of these strains elaborate the L3 immunotype LOS, which consists of a lacto-N-neotetraose branch with an α-2,3-sialic acid on the terminal galactose residue (13Pavliak V. Brisson J.-R. Michon F. Uhrin D. Jennings H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14146-14152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these strains produced easily detectable levels of α-2,3-sialyltransferase when using as little as a single colony (107 cells) with the CE-based assay. Crude extract from N. meningitidis 406Y L3 was used to prepare material for determination of the linkage of the sialoside being synthesized and the enzyme was verified by NMR of its product to be a β-galactoside α-2,3-sialyltransferase. By NMR, the complete 1H assignment of the compounds was performed. It was found that the 1H chemical shifts (Table I) were similar to those of reported structures containing α-NeuAc-(2-3)-Gal (13Pavliak V. Brisson J.-R. Michon F. Uhrin D. Jennings H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14146-14152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also an NOE across the glycosidic bond H3ax-sialic acid to H3-Gal confirmed that the β-galactoside α-NeuAc-(2-3)-Gal linkage was present in the product (Fig. 1).Table INMR chemical shifts for α-D-Neu5Ac-(2-3)-β-D-Galp-(1-4)-β-D-GlcpNAc-aminophenyl-(6-5-(fluorescein-carboxamido)-hexanoic acid amide)SugarPositionHCGlcNAc14.87100.223.8955.633.7173.043.7179.353.4975.663.8860.76′3.71NAc1.9422.8Gal14.52103.423.5970.234.1276.543.9768.353.7376.163.7761.96′3.73Neu5Ac3ax1.8240.63eq2.7743.6969.453.8552.463.6473.573.5669.083.972.693.8863.59′3.71NAc2.0322.8 Open table in a new tab Variation of the reaction conditions showed that the enzyme had a pH optimum of 6.0 and that the activity was stimulated 2-fold by the addition of either 10 mM MgCl2 or 3-fold by 10 mM MnCl2. However, there are no stringent metal requirements because it was active in the presence of 5 mM EDTA. These same conditions were also optimal for the enzyme from crude extracts of MC58, 406Y, and for the recombinant enzymes from MC58. The natural enzyme was mostly associated with the cell membrane fraction (86% in the cell membrane pellet after centrifugation at 100,000 × g). However, no detergent was required for activity, and in fact many common detergents tested inhibited the enzyme, with the exception of Triton X-100 up to 0.2%. Using this method no activity could be detected in M982B L7 cells. Using the CE laser-induced fluorescence assay, we observed sialyltransferase activity one time out of five when we infected a 1.5-ml isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside-induced E. coli XL1-Blue culture with 1000 pfu from the N. meningitidis MC58 genomic library in λZAPII (Fig. 2). Formation of the product peak in the electropherogram required the addition of CMP-Neu5Ac, and it migrated the same as the sialidase-sensitive product peak formed by the natural enzyme. The peak in the CE electropherogram corresponds to 20 attomoles (2 × 10 −17 mol) of product. Single clones expressing the sialyltransferase were obtained by a “divide and conquer” strategy sequentially screening pools of 100 pfu from the λZAPII library of MC58, pools of 5 pfu derived from the first positive pool, and finally individual plaques plated at low density. The initial screening yielded two positive pools of 100 pfu out of 36. From one of these pools we screened 60 pools of 5 pfu and obtained three positive pools. From the positive pools of 5 pfu we obtained many individual positive clones and the pBluescript SK− phagemids excised from them were found to carry a 2.0-kb insert. The 2.0-kb insert was sequenced on both strands (GenBank™ accession number U60660) and a BLASTX search was performed in GenBank™ in order to identify any homology with previously sequenced genes. This analysis revealed two partial open reading frames (nucleotides 1-140 and 1853-2039), located at the opposite ends of the 2.0-kb insert, that were clearly homologous with various bacterial isocitrate dehydrogenases (60-85% identity) and various bacterial cytochrome c′ proteins (43-63% identity), respectively. A third open reading frame (nucleotides 573-1685) was designated lst (lipooligosaccharide sialyltransferase) and revealed significant homology to a Haemophilus influenzae gene designated lsg-ORF2 (GenBank™ accession number M94855). Pair-wise alignment between the translation products of lst and lsg-ORF2 indicated that their amino acid sequences share 29.3% identity and 56.3% similarity (Fig. 3). The lst gene has two potential start codons, and the second of these is more likely to be used because the amino acid sequence immediately following this start codon appears to be a noncleavable leader sequence (14Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), and a potentially very good ribosome binding site (AGGGA) occurs just upstream. Isolation of the genes from N. meningitidis 406Y L3 (GenBank™ accession number U60661), M982B L7 (GenBank™ accession number U60663), and N. gonorrhoeae F62 (GenBank™ accession number U60664) was accomplished with PCR primers based on the gene from MC58 L3 (GenBank™ accession U60660). We found 12 base differences, which results in five amino acid differences between the two genes from the L3 immunotype strains (Fig. 4), 19 differences in the gene from M982B L7 compared with MC58, and 12 differences in the M982B L7 sequence compared with that of 406Y L3. The gene from M982B L7 contains a frameshift mutation at nucleotide 454 and consequently would encode a truncated protein of only 151 amino acids (Fig. 4). The gene from N. gonorrhoeae F62 shows 63 nucleotide differences compared with the N. meningitidis MC58, 62 nucleotide differences compared with the 406Y L3 gene, and 66 nucleotide differences compared with the M982B L7 gene. These differences in the DNA sequence of the N. gonorrhoeae F62 gene result in 16 and 17 amino acid differences in the protein when compared with the MC58 L3 and 406Y L3, respectively (Fig. 4). We could easily detect enzyme activity in E. coli carrying pNST plasmids, and this expression of the lst gene depended on the vector derived lac promoter because there was no detectable enzyme activity when the gene's orientation was inverted. There was at least 30-fold more enzyme activity from the pNST-01 containing clones compared with N. meningitidis L3 strains. However, the expression of the lst gene was not high enough to permit simple detection of an overexpressed protein by SDS-PAGE analysis. A plasmid was therefore constructed to introduce a c-myc immunodetection peptide tag at the COOH-terminal end of the protein. When this plasmid was used to express the lst gene, we could detect an immunoreactive protein with an Mr of 41,000 (Fig. 5), which is slightly shorter than the predicted size of the lst gene product including the c-myc peptide tag (expected Mr 44,000). The natural acceptor for this enzyme is a terminal N-acetyllactosamine sequence on the lacto-N-neotetraose branch of the LOS from L3 immunotypes. We found that the enzyme would use as acceptors the synthetic saccharides: FCHASE-aminophenyl-LacNAc, FCHASE-aminophenyl-Lac, and FCHASE-aminophenyl-Gal. To assess the relative acceptor specificities we assayed for activity using two different substrate concentrations and compared the specific activites of both the native MC58 sialyltransferase and the recombinant form (pNST-01). Comparison of the specific activity reveals a strong preference for the LacNAc containing acceptor (Table II).Table II.Comparison of acceptor specificities of N. meningitidis α-2,3-sialyltransferaseEnzyme sourceN-acetyllactosamineaThe acceptors used in this experiment were all FCHASE-aminophenyl-glycosides.LactoseGalactose0.2 mM1.0 mM0.2 mM1.0 mM0.2 mM1.0 mMMC58 L30.70bThe activity values are in milliunits/mg of protein.1.450.110.450.0060.033pNST-0123.946.84.215.40.170.84a The acceptors used in this experiment were all FCHASE-aminophenyl-glycosides.b The activity values are in milliunits/mg of protein. Open table in a new tab The availability of a highly sensitive enzyme assay was instrumental in successful screening of clones expressing the N. meningitidis α-2,3-sialyltransferase. The assay uses a glycosyltransferase acceptor, which is easy to synthesize, and does not require specially constructed CE equipment as has been previously described for the ultrasensitive detection of glycosyltransferase reaction products (15Zhao J.Y. Dovichi N.J. Hindsgaul O. Gosselin S. Palcic M.M. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The acceptors used in this study were made from widely available glycosides, and fluorophores and the CE equipment used was commercially available. We were able to reliably detect attomole (10−18 mol) quantities of reaction products, which was more than adequate for screening for α-2,3-sialyltransferase expression. The lst gene from MC58 L3 occurs between two genes unrelated to LOS synthesis, isocitrate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c', and is not part of a LOS synthesis operon unlike other N. meningitidis LOS glycosyltransferases (8Jennings M.P. Hood D.W. Peak I.R.A. Virji M. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This is similar to the situation with the E. coli and N. meningitidis α-2,8-polysialyltransferase involved in capsule biosynthesis, although these genes are adjacent to the CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase (16Ganguli S. Zapata G. Wallis T. Reid C. Boulnois G. Vann W.F. Roberts I.S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4583-4589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting to speculate that the lst gene is found on its own as the result of a transposition event, although we have no evidence for insertion elements or transposon-like sequences flanking the gene. Sequence analysis and data base comparisons showed this gene to be distinct from both the mammalian α-2,3-sialyltransferase family, the bacterial α-2,8-sialyltransferase family, and the bacterial 3-deoxy-α-D-manno-octulosonic acid transferases, which transfer a related sugar also from a CMP donor. The lst gene product was, however, shown to be similar to the lsg-ORF2 gene product from H. influenzae. Although lsg-ORF2 has been demonstrated to be involved in LOS biosynthesis, it may not encode an α-2,3-sialyltransferase because it was reported to be involved in the expression of a Gal-GlcNAc LOS epitope (17McLaughlin R. Spinola S.M. Apicella M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6455-6459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the cloning of the N. gonorrhoeae gene, the F62 strain was used because it has been studied in relation to the role LOS sialylation plays in pathogenesis and because many LOS glycosyltransferases have been shown to be common to both species (8Jennings M.P. Hood D.W. Peak I.R.A. Virji M. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). An examination of the gene derived from N. gonorrhoeae F62 shows only a small number of differences, which is similar to other LOS biosynthesis gene comparisons from N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae (8Jennings M.P. Hood D.W. Peak I.R.A. Virji M. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We have observed that the activity from N. meningitidis extracts is associated with the membrane fraction. The protein encoded by the lst gene appears to have an uncleavable signal peptide, and computer aided prediction programs suggest that the sialyltransferase is an integral inner membrane protein (14Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). However, the original papers describing the sialyltransferase activity from both N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae suggest that the sialyltransferase would be an outer membrane protein on the basis that the enzyme activity is extracted from whole cells by Triton X-100 (5Mandrell R.E. Griffiss J.M. Smith H. Cole J.A. Microb. Pathog. 1993; 14: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Mandrell R.E. Smith H. Jarvis G.A. Griffiss J.M. Cole J.A. Microb. Pathog. 1993; 14: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have not yet fully purified the recombinant product, but the predicted size of the immunotagged protein is slighty larger than that we observed by SDS-PAGE. The difference between the observed and the expected Mr is less than 7% and is within the accuracy of SDS-PAGE. However, the possibility exists that the recombinant protein is truncated at the amino-terminal end, which would result in the loss of the predicted noncleavable leader sequence. Experiments are in progress to determine if the lst protein is expressed intact in E. coli. That this gene functions in the sialylation of LOS is inferred from an examination of N. meningitidis M982B L7, which appears to be a natural sialyltransferase mutant. The sialyltransferase gene derived from this L7 strain contains a frameshift mutation at nucleotide 454 that renders it inactive in the recombinant plasmid carrying it, which agrees with our observation that sialyltransferase activity cannot be detected in M982B cells. This frameshift is a deletion of a T residue, which is different from the G-tract frameshift mutations observed in the phase variable lgt genes from N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae (8Jennings M.P. Hood D.W. Peak I.R.A. Virji M. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This strain produces the same lacto-N-neotetraose as the L3 strains do but does not sialylate its LOS. 3H. J. Jennings, personal communication. The acceptor specificity for the L3 enzyme with synthetic acceptors shows a strong preference for N-acetyllactosamine over lactose or galactose (Table II). Also the product of the reaction using enzyme from N. meningitidis and FCHASE-LacNAc acceptor was unequivocally determined by NMR to be FCHASE-α-2,3-sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine. The expression level of the recombinant gene is being optimized, but it should be pointed out that the level of enzyme activity we have produced is approximately 50 units/liter of culture, based on assays with the FCHASE-LacNAc acceptor. Our expression levels are as high as those reported for mammalian sialyltransferases being overexpressed in insect cell cultures (18Williams M.A. Kitagawa H. Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. Jamieson J.C. Glycoconjugate J. 1995; 12: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We anticipate that optimization of expression of the lst gene in E. coli will yield substantially more enzyme activity than is produced with the mammalian gene constructs. This will be an important improvement for large scale chemienzymatic synthesis of α-2,3-sialylated oligosaccharides. We have shown conclusively that we have cloned the α-2,3-sialyltransferase gene from the important mucosal pathogens N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae. The availability of this gene will enable defined mutants to be constructed in both species in order to determine the role that LOS sialylation plays in the pathogenesis of these organisms, and the regulation of this important virulence factor can now be studied. The availability of large amounts of an α-2,3-sialyltransferase for enzymatic synthesis will help elucidate the role of this important modification of many oligosaccharide structures. We thank D. W. Griffith for large scale production of N. meningitidis cells, Kirstin Tisdale for help in preparing samples for NMR, Jean-Robert Brisson for performing the NMR analysis, Joseph Michniewicz for the DNA sequencing, Doris Bilous for oligonucleotide synthesis, and C.

https://openalex.org/W1998495384,"Recombinant αB-crystallin has been shown to exhibit chaperone-like activity, suppressing the thermal aggregation of γ-crystallin and aggregation of the reduced insulin B chain conferring thermotolerance to Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Mutations were made in three specific areas of the αB-crystallin, the N terminus D2G, the conserved phenylalanine-rich region, F24R, F27R, F27A, and the two C-terminal lysines K174L/K175L, K174G/K175G. Biophysical characterization of the mutant αB-crystallins using far-UV CD revealed no change in secondary structural elements. Tryptophan fluorescence demonstrated global structural changes. Heat stability of the mutant αB-crystallins was not significantly affected as indicated by tryptophan fluorescence of heat-treated proteins.Mutations within the phenylalanine-rich region abolish the chaperone-like activity as measured by both in vivo and in vitro assays. Proteins with mutations at the C terminus demonstrated no significant chaperone-like activity, failing to confer thermotolerance on E. coli and demonstrating no significant inhibition of protein aggregation in either γ-crystallin or reduced insulin B chain assays. The N-terminal mutation D2G demonstrated a significant reduction in efficiency of the chaperone-like activity although some thermotolerance was conferred in the E. coli assay. In vitro assays showed that complete inhibition of aggregation was only achieved at 10-fold higher concentrations of D2G than that required by the native αB-crystallin.Consistent changes in the chaperone-like activity of the site-directed mutants were demonstrated by the three assays. The results suggested that both charge-charge and hydrophobic interactions are important in protein binding by αB-crystallin and that the conserved RLFDQFF region is vital for chaperone-like activity. Recombinant αB-crystallin has been shown to exhibit chaperone-like activity, suppressing the thermal aggregation of γ-crystallin and aggregation of the reduced insulin B chain conferring thermotolerance to Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Mutations were made in three specific areas of the αB-crystallin, the N terminus D2G, the conserved phenylalanine-rich region, F24R, F27R, F27A, and the two C-terminal lysines K174L/K175L, K174G/K175G.

Here, we characterize the 322 gene product as an in vivo and in vitro substrate of protein kinase C (PKC). Hence, we named this product SSeCKS (pronounced essex) for Src Suppressed CKinase Substrate. Rabbit polyclonal sera raised against glutathione S-transferase (GST)-SSeCKS recognized a myristylated 280/290-kDa doublet in Rat-6 fibroblasts. SSeCKS levels in src- and ras-transformed Rat-6 cells were 15- and 8-fold less, respectively, than those in untransformed cells. Short-term addition of phorbol ester resulted in a 5-fold increase in SSeCKS phosphorylation which was inhibited by bis-indolylmaleimide. In vitro phosphorylation of GST-SSeCKS by purified rabbit brain PKC-α was enhanced by phosphatidylserine and blocked by excess PKC pseudosubstrate inhibitor peptide. GST-SSeCKS bound purified PKC-α or PKC from Rat-6 lysates in a phosphatidylserine-dependent manner. Four SSeCKS domains containing Lys/Arg-rich motifs similar to the PKC phosphorylation site in MARCKS were phosphorylated in vitro by PKC. Immunofluorescence analysis showed SSeCKS present throughout the cytoplasm with enrichment in podosomes and at the cell edge. Short-term addition of phorbol esters caused the movement of SSeCKS from plasma membrane sites to the perinucleus coincident with a loss of actin stress fibers.

The hydrophobic lipid A portion forms the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. In enteric bacteria, an O-polysaccharide is attached to lipid A via a short core oligosaccharide. The O-polysaccharide extends away from the cell surface to give a hydrophilic surface layer and represents a major surface antigen (O-antigen). It is characterized by a repeat unit structure, with different epitopes arising from variations in the nature, order, and linkage of the sugar monomers in the O-repeat unit and from the addition of side branches and “decorations” such as acetyl, ketal, and glycosyl residues. lipopolysaccharide ATP-binding cassette transporter N-acetylmannosamine open reading frame hydrophobic cluster analysis basic local alignment search tool enterobacterial common antigen N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine kilobase pair(s). Members of the genus Salmonella are serologically diverse. Approximately 50 O-antigens are recognized in Salmonella, and this diversity, combined with variable flagellar antigens, has resulted in the identification of greater than 2,000 serologically distinct Salmonella strains. Strains are assigned to serogroups based on shared expression of major O-antigen epitopes or factors (1Lindberg A.A. Le Minor L. Methods Microbiol. 1984; 14: 1-141Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Synthesis of the O-antigen is directed by the products of the rfb gene cluster, and the structural diversity seen in the LPS O-antigens reflects variation in the rfb gene clusters; this variation is thought to have arisen from repeated lateral gene transfer and recombination events involving rfb genes. Selective pressure from the host immune response is proposed to be the driving force for the continued generation of antigenic diversity (2Reeves P.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 100: 509-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Serogroup O:54 is a heterogeneous group of 13 different Salmonella serovars. It is unique among Salmonella serogroups in that expression of the O:54 antigen requires the presence of a small plasmid. This is the only known plasmid-encoded O-polysaccharide in Salmonella. We have studied the 6.9-kb plasmid pWQ799 from serovar Borreze to determine the role of these plasmids in expression of the O:54 antigen (3Keenleyside W.J. Perry M. MacLean L. Poppe C. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). pWQ799 is a novel ColE1-related plasmid carrying the entire rfbO:54 biosynthetic cluster (4Keenleyside W.J. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5247-5253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is the only reported example of a ColE1-related plasmid carrying genes for the synthesis of cell-surface antigens. The plasmid is mobilized in the presence of an appropriate helper plasmid, providing the first defined mechanism for lateral gene transfer of O-antigen biosynthesis genes in Salmonella enterica. Mobilization of plasmids containing rfbO:54 into strains possessing a chromosomally encoded rfb explains the simultaneous expression of two distinct O-antigens in members of this serogroup (3Keenleyside W.J. Perry M. MacLean L. Poppe C. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) as well as the serotyping results of plasmid-cured O:54 derivatives. Enzymes encoded by the rfbO:54 cluster direct the synthesis of an N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc)-containing O-polysaccharide with the novel disaccharide repeat unit, →4)-β-D-ManpNAc-(1→3)-β-D-ManpNAc-(1-→. O:54 polysaccharide synthesis requires a functional chromosomal rfe gene (3Keenleyside W.J. Perry M. MacLean L. Poppe C. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Rfe transfers GlcpNAc-1-phosphate to undecaprenol-phosphate to form the first lipid intermediate (lipid I) in synthesis of the enterobacterial common antigen (5Meier-Dieter U. Barr K. Starman R. Hatch L. Rick P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 746-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two LPS O-polysaccharide pathways have been described, and Rfe may play a role in either of these two pathways (reviewed in Ref. 6Whitfield C. Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 178-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The O:54 O-polysaccharide shares a number of characteristics with the O-polysaccharides synthesized by the Rfc-independent O-polysaccharide biosynthetic pathway including the following: 1) it is a homopolymer; and 2) Rfe is required for synthesis although GlcNAc does not form part of the repeating unit. The Rfc-independent pathway has so far only been identified for a few homopolymeric O-polysaccharides in Klebsiella O1 (7Clarke B.R. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4614-4621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Clarke B.R. Bronner D. Keenleyside W.J. Severn W.B. Richards J.C. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5411-5418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Escherichia coli O8 and O9 (9Kido N. Torgov V.I. Sugiyama T. Uchiya K. Sugihara H. Komatsu T. Kato N. Jann K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2178-2187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rick P.D. Hubbard G.L. Barr K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2877-2884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Weisgerber C. Jann K. Eur. J.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1544-1553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this pathway, Rfe initiates synthesis by transferring GlcpNAc-1-P to the carrier lipid to form the acceptor upon which the complete O-polysaccharide chain is subsequently polymerized. GlcpNAc therefore does not form part of the repeating unit. O-polysaccharides synthesized by this pathway are polymerized in the cytoplasm (13Bronner D. Clarke B.R. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 505-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and then the completed polymer is transported across the plasma membrane by an rfb-encoded dedicated ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter, prior to ligation to lipid A core. Analysis of rfbO:54 and O:54 expression indicates that transport of the nascent O:54 polysaccharide occurs by a different mechanism. This communication describes the organization of rfbO:54 and the characterization of the two glycosyltransferases that direct the synthesis of the O:54 O-polysaccharide. Our studies indicate that synthesis of O:54 LPS follows a novel mechanism distinct from either of the two characterized O-polysaccharide pathways. Bacterial strains were grown in Luria-Bertani broth supplemented, where appropriate, with antibiotics (ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; kanamycin, 50 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 30 μg/ml; tetracycline, 15 μg/ml). For high level expression of RfbAO:54 and RfbBO:54, 100 mM isopropyl-β-D-galactopyranoside was added to LB broth cultures at a final concentration of 0.5 mM. TnphoA mutants were examined on LB agar plates supplemented with 40 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate toluidine salt. The host for TnphoA mutagenesis was E. coli CS118 (14Manoil C.

The plasmids used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. The construction of plasmids pWQ800 and pWQ802 has been previously reported (3Keenleyside W.J. Perry M. MacLean L. Poppe C. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 4Keenleyside W.J. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5247-5253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pWQ819 contains a 2.3-kb EcoRI-KpnI fragment from pWQ799 cloned in pTrc99A (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). pWQ820 was constructed by cloning the 2.4-kb Mlu1 fragment from pWQ799, after filling in the ends, into the SmaI site of pKK232-8 (Pharmacia), and then removing the insert using the flanking EcoRI and BamHI sites from the vector multiple cloning region. This fragment was cloned into EcoRI-BamHI-digested pGEM-7Zf(+) (Promega) to generate pWQ820. pWQ822 contains the 1.14-kb HincII-SspI fragment of pWQ799 inserted at the SmaI site of the expression vector pKK232-8. Plasmid pWQ823 was constructed by first cloning the 1.14-kb HincII-SspI fragment into the EcoRV site of pGEM-5Zf(+) (Promega) so that the direction of transcription was toward the SP6 promoter. The insert was then removed using the PstI and NcoI sites of the vector and cloning this into NcoI-PstI-digested pTrc99A. Restriction enzyme digestions, ligations, and CaCl2 transformations were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA fragments to be subcloned were gel-purified using the GENECLEAN kit (Bio/Can Scientific, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Plasmids were column purified using QIAGEN spin columns (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, Calif.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nucleotide sequencing procedures are described elsewhere (4Keenleyside W.J. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5247-5253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence data were edited and analyzed using AssemblyLIGN and MacVector software (International Biotechnologies Inc., New Haven, CT). Hydropathic analysis of the predicted protein sequence was done using the algorithm of Rao and Argos (18Rao J.K.M. Argos P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 869: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) with a minimum length for the transmembrane helix of 16. Homology searches of nucleotide and amino acid sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information data bases were done with the BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) server analysis program (19Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69707) Google Scholar). Multiple alignments were performed using Clustal (20Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (2871) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA) was performed using the HCA-Plot program (Doriane Informatique, Le Chesnay, France). This program writes protein sequences on a duplicated α-helical net and circles clusters of hydrophobic amino acids (Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Met, Phe, Gln). The plots are then visually compared for similarity in the hydrophobic cluster patterns, limiting analysis to the predicted globular portions of the proteins. β-Strands and α-helices are deduced based on the observed association of specific hydrophobic cluster shapes with secondary structures (21Gaboriaud C. Bissery B. Benchetrit T. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Plasmid-encoded rfbO:54 genes were mutagenized using TnphoA as described previously by Manoil and Beckwith (14Manoil C. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8129-8133Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Fusions were made in plasmid pWQ800 (3Keenleyside W.J. Perry M. MacLean L. Poppe C. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The precise site of insertion was mapped by sequencing out of the phoA orf using a primer (5′-CAGTAATATCGCCCTGAGCA-3′) that is complementary to the phoA sequence between nucleotides 79 and 98 (22Shuttleworth H. Taylor J. Minton N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8689Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). RNA was purified from a mid-log phase culture of E. coli DH5α (pWQ820) using TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primer extension reactions were done using the oligonucleotide primer TS154 (5′-TTTCATAATGTCGATCTGTTAATCC-3′) that corresponds to the complementary sequence to nucleotides 3676-3700 of plasmid pWQ799. The primer was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim, Laval, Quebec, Canada) and then purified using a QIAquick spin column (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Primer extension experiments were performed using the First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit from Pharmacia (Pharmacia Biotech, Baie D'Urfé, Quebec) following the manufacturer's recommendations. DNA sequencing was done with the Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). LPS samples were prepared either from SDS-proteinase K whole cell lysates, as described by Hitchcock and Brown (23Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or by using a modification of the phenol/water extraction method; LPS was collected from both the aqueous and phenol phases (3Keenleyside W.J. Perry M. MacLean L. Poppe C. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For compositional analysis of the LPS core oligosaccharides, lipid A was removed from phenol-purified LPS by hydrolysis in 1.5% acetic acid at 100°C for 2 h. Precipitated lipid A was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was lyophilized. Samples were resuspended in water to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml, hydrolyzed, and analyzed by high performance anion-exchange chromatography as described previously (24Clarke A.J. Sarabia V. Keenleyside W. MacLachlan P.R. Whitfield C. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). LPS samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using commercially prepared 10-20% gradient Tricine gels from Novex (San Diego, CA). Electrophoresis conditions were those specified by the manufacturer. Gels were silver-stained using the method of Tsai and Frasch (25Tsai G.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar). Previous analysis of the nucleotide sequence and genetic organization of pWQ799 indicated that approximately half of the 6915-base pair plasmid (nucleotides 72-3384) is involved in plasmid replication and mobilization (4Keenleyside W.J. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5247-5253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These regions are related to ColE1 and possess an average G + C content of 50-53% (Fig. 1A). This value is typical of Salmonella genomic DNA (26Reeves P.R. Ghuysen J.-M. Hakenbeck R. Bacterial Cell Wall. Vol. 27. Elsevier Science B.V., New York1994: 281-317Google Scholar). In contrast, the remaining pWQ799 sequences have a uniformly lower average G + C content of 39%, with no detectable homology to any known ColE1-related sequences. The junctions between the high and low G + C regions in pWQ799 coincide with the 5′ and 3′ ends of the plasmid replicon regions. Abnormally low G + C values relative to those typical for the species is a common observation for genes involved in polysaccharide synthesis (27Whitfield C. Valvano M.A. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1993; 35: 135-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These observations therefore suggested that the remaining DNA contained rfbO:54 determinants. Computer analysis for coding regions combined with sequence homology searches in the NCBI data bases (see below) resulted in the identification of three potential open reading frames (Fig. 1B; nucleotides 3547-4364, 4364-5740, and 5740-6873) designated rfbAO:54, rfbBO:54, and rfbCO:54. Each gene is preceded by potential Shine-Dalgarno sequence: AGGA at nucleotides 3532-3535; AAGA at 4356-4359, and AGGA at 5727-5730. The initiation codons of rfbBO:54 and rfbCO:54 each overlap with the end of the preceding gene, suggesting that translation of the three genes is coupled. No consensus −10 and −35 E. coli promoter sequences were detected in the region immediately upstream of rfbAO:54. To localize the rfbO:54 promoter, the 1.14-kb HincII-SspI fragment of pWQ799, containing rfbAO:54 and a 90-base pair 5′-flanking region, was cloned in front of the promoterless cat gene of pKK232-8. When transformed into E. coli K-12, the resulting plasmid (pWQ822; Fig. 1C) conferred chloramphenicol resistance, indicating the presence of an endogenous promoter. The transcription start site was mapped by primer extension of the oligonucleotide TS154 using total cellular RNA from E. coli DH5α (pWQ820; Fig. 1C). A single band was obtained in the resulting autoradiogram (data not shown), identifying the start site as nucleotide G at position 3474, 73 nucleotides upstream of the rfbAO:54 start codon. Previous studies of O:54 O-polysaccharide expression in strains containing pWQ800 (Fig. 1C) revealed a requirement for a functional rffE determinant in an E. coli host (3Keenleyside W.J. Perry M. MacLean L. Poppe C. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This gene is part of the chromosomal enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) biosynthesis cluster and encodes the enzyme UDP-GlcNAc-2-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.14, UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerase) (5Meier-Dieter U. Barr K. Starman R. Hatch L. Rick P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 746-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The epimerase converts UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-ManNAc, an intermediate in the formation of a precursor for ECA biosynthesis. UDP-ManNAc is also the presumed precursor for O:54 synthesis. Sequence analysis of pWQ799 indicated that the EcoRI site used in cloning of pWQ800 maps within rfbCO:54. Subsequent mutant complementation analysis with an rfbCO:54+ subclone has shown that RfbCO:54 is a functional homologue of RffE and is therefore not essential for O:54 synthesis in members of the Enterobacteriaceae, all of which synthesize ECA (28Kuhn H.-M.

The remaining two rfbO:54 gene products, RfbAO:54 and RfbBO:54, are unique and essential for O:54 polysaccharide assembly and their structures and functions are described below. Sequence analysis of rfbAO:54 predicts a 274 amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 31.8 kDa and a pI of 9.76. Hydropathic analyses (18Rao J.K.M. Argos P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 869: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) identified one transmembrane helix at the carboxyl terminus of the protein (residues 227-251). To determine the topology of RfbAO:54, a promoterless leader sequence-deficient TnphoA gene was inserted in-frame at a position corresponding to amino acid 21 of RfbAO:54 (Fig. 1B). E. coli CC118 (pWQ800B6) was O:54-deficient and PhoA-negative on indicator media, indicating that this region of the protein is present in the cytoplasm. This cytoplasmic location is in agreement with the function of RfbAO:54 (see below) and with protein topology predictions by the positive-inside rule. This rule allows the prediction of the topology of a bacterial inner membrane protein based on the observation that positively charged amino acids (Arg + Lys) are more abundant in cytoplasmic loops (i.e. ∼15%) than in periplasmic loops (∼5%) (29von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). The Arg + Lys content of this region was 14%. The translated amino acid sequence of RfbAO:54 shares significant homology with a number of putative bacterial glycosyltransferases (Fig. 2 and Table I). RfbAO:54 shares 32% identity with the predicted product of the rfbEcO7 gene orf275 (30Marolda C.L. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 148-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 26% identity with the hypothetical protein 6 of the lsg locus of Haemophilus influenzae, and 25% identity with the AmsE protein of Erwinia amylovora (31Bugert P. Geider K. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 917-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Analysis of the protein alignments of these predicted products revealed that the sequence conservation was relatively uniform throughout the length of the proteins (Fig. 2). A number of protein sequences in the data bases were also identified with significant levels of homology over the N-terminal 192 amino acids of RfbAO:54. Alignment of this region gave identity levels of 21 and 20%, respectively, with the ExoU and ExoO proteins from Rhizobium meliloti (32Becker A. Kleickmann M. Keller M. Arnold A.P.W. Mol. & Gen.

https://openalex.org/W2147966467,"Rhodopsin receptor activation involves the disruption of a salt bridge constraint between glutamic acid 113 on transmembrane 3 and a lysine 296 in transmembrane 7, which forms a Schiff's base with retinal. Light-induced isomerization of cis-retinal to the all trans form breaks this rhodopsin salt bridge leading to receptor activation. The analogous residues in α1b-adrenergic receptors, aspartic acid 125 and lysine 331, also have the potential of forming a constraining salt bridge holding the receptor to an inactive protein configuration. This α1b-adrenergic receptor salt bridge constraint is then released upon binding by the receptor agonist. To test this hypothesis, site-directed mutagenesis was used to eliminate the positive charge at position 331 by substitution of an alanine. The expressed α1b-adrenergic receptor mutant demonstrated a 6-fold increased epinephrine binding affinity with no alterations of affinity values for selective adrenergic receptor antagonists. Furthermore, an increased epinephrine potency for total soluble inositol phosphate production along with an elevated basal inositol triphosphate level was observed in COS-1 cells transfected with mutant versus wild-type α1b-adrenergic receptors. Similar results were obtained for a lysine to a glutamic acid α1b-adrenergic receptor mutation. In addition, increased basal inositol triphosphate levels were also observed for two aspartic acid 125 α1b-adrenergic receptor mutations, consistent with this residue's role as the counterion of the salt bridge. Taken together, these α1b-adrenergic receptor mutations suggest a molecular mechanism by which the positively charged lysine 331 stabilizes the negatively charged aspartic acid 125 via a salt bridge constraint until bound by the receptor agonist.

The observed physiological response is dependent upon the type of AR expressed in the tissue being innervated. Classification of ARs (α1-, α2-, and β-) is based upon the primary amino acid sequences and potencies of selective AR ligands (1Bylund D.B. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 832-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Further characterizations describing a heterogeneous population of α1-ARs has been accomplished using subtype-selective AR agonists and antagonists (2Minneman K.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 1988; 40: 87-119PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hwa J. Graham R.M. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23189-23195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 4Piascik M.T.

Most of these pharmacologically identified α1-AR subtypes have been cloned and recognized to be unique based on primary amino acid sequences (6Cotecchia S. Schwinn D.A. Randall R.R. Lefkowitz R.J.

In addition, a large amount of data has been catalogued about the cellular biochemistry associated with α1-AR activation (9Ruffolo Jr., R.R. Nichols A.J. Stadel J.M. Hieble J.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 475-505PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hwa J. DeYoung M. Perez D.M. Graham R.M. Shepherd J. Vatner S.F. The Autonomic Nervous System: The Nervous Control of the Heart. Vol. VIII.

However, nothing is known about the agonist-dependent molecular mechanisms of α1-AR stimulation. adrenergic receptor transmembrane wild-type Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (±)-β-([125I]iodo-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylaminomethyltetralone phospholipase C inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate guanyl-5′-yl imidodiphosphate. Recently the activation mechanism for a related G-protein-coupled receptor, rhodopsin, has been described (11Robinson P.R. Cohen G.B. Zhukovsky E.A. Oprian D.D. Neuron. 1992; 9: 719-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Briefly, the visual chromophore, 11-cis-retinal, is covalently bound to the opsin protein by forming a Schiff's base with the basic amino acid lysine at position 296 in transmembrane (TM) 7. This protonated amine is neutralized by forming an interhelical salt bridge with a negatively charged glutamic acid residue at position 113 in TM 3. This constraining salt bridge holds the rhodopsin receptor in a basal conformational configuration that is unable to interact with the G-protein transducin. Exposure of the rhodopsin receptor to light causes an isomerization of the covalently bound chromophore to the all-trans structure. This ligand isomerization breaks the salt bridge between TM 3 and 7, allowing the rhodopsin receptor to adopt an active conformation that can now signal through transducin. A “constraining factor” has also been postulated for the α1b-AR subtype, holding the receptor in a basal configuration until bound by a receptor agonist (12Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1430-1433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis is based upon the characterization of mutant α1b-ARs where the normal alanine at position 293 in the third cytosolic loop was changed to all possible amino acid combinations. Kjelsberg et al. (12Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1430-1433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) observed that any amino acid substituted at position 293 caused the α1b-AR to become constitutively active. This constitutive activity was characterized by higher binding affinity values for AR agonists but not antagonists when compared to the wild-type (WT) α1b-AR. In addition, a higher AR agonist potency for generating intracellular signals was observed, and more importantly, there was an increased second messenger production in the absence of AR agonist. The characteristics for these constitutively active Ala293α1b-AR 2Names of naturally occurring amino acids are designated by the three-letter nomenclature. mutations resulted in a revision of the ternary complex model for receptor G-protein activation (13Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This revised ternary complex model postulates the isomerization of the receptor between the inactive “R” state and an activated “R*” state, before G-protein coupling can occur. In addition, Kjelsberg et al. (12Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1430-1433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that any amino acid change at position 293 of the α1b-AR releases a physical restraint that allows the isomerization of the receptor protein to an active configuration. However, no molecular evidence for this α1b-AR “constraining factor” has been presented. Recently another constitutively active α1b-AR has been characterized in our laboratory (14Perez D.M. Hwa J. Gaivin R. Mathur M. Brown F. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 112-122PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant α1b-AR was generated by changing the natural cysteine at position 128 in TM 3 to a phenylalanine residue. The attributes of this C128F α1b-AR are compatible with the properties of a constitutively active receptor outlined in the revised ternary complex model for G-protein receptor coupling (13Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This phenylalanine mutation is located three amino acids away from a highly conserved aspartic acid at position 125, postulated to interact with the protonated amine of endogenous catecholamines (15Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). In the unbound WT α1b-AR, this Asp125 has the potential of forming a constraining salt bridge with a lysine residue at position 331 in TM 7, equivalent to what has been established for the rhodopsin receptor. In addition, the proximity of the bulky C128F point mutation to Asp125 suggests the potential to disrupt this possible salt bridge and may represent the mechanism of constitutive activity for this mutant α1b-AR. In this report we show that specific amino acid substitutions at position 128 selectively enhanced the constitutively active properties of these α1b-AR mutations when compared to the WT or C128F mutant receptor. This suggested that the mechanism of constitutive activity for these Cys128 mutations could involve the disruption of the potential α1b-AR salt bridge formed by the Asp125 and Lys331 residues. To further investigate this possible mechanism of α1b-AR activation, the natural charges at amino acid positions 331 and 125 were modified using site-directed mutagenesis techniques. The constitutively active properties documented for these mutant receptors substantiated the existence of an interhelical salt bridge that constrains the tertiary protein structure of the α1b-AR. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on a M13mp19 hamster α1b-AR construct utilizing the oligonucleotide-mediated double primer method (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 15.51-15.71Google Scholar). DNA from plaques that hybridize to the mutagenic primer were purified and sequenced by the dideoxy method to verify the mutation. The mutated α1b-AR insert was removed from the phage M13mp19 vector and then subcloned into the eucaryotic expression vector, pMT2′. The full-length plasmid DNA was again sequenced to verify the correct α1b-AR mutation. COS-1 cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. COS-1 cells were plated at a density of 106 cells/60-mm dish for transient transfection of WT and/or various α1b-AR mutants. Parallel expression of purified pMT2′ plasmid cDNAs encoding these α1b-ARs was accomplished using the DEAE-dextran method of transfection (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 15.51-15.71Google Scholar). Concentrations of purified pMT2′ plasmid constructs were adjusted (1-8 μg/106 cells) to achieve similar α1b-AR expression levels for analysis of AR agonist potency. COS-1 cells were harvested for membranes or used in biochemical assays 60 h post-transfection. Transfected COS-1 cell membranes were prepared as described previously (7Perez D.M. Piascik M.T. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 876-883PubMed Google Scholar). The pharmacological profile of expressed α1b-ARs was determined by saturation and/or competition binding experiments using the selective α1-AR antagonist (±)-β-([125I]iodo-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylaminomethyltetralone (125I-HEAT) as the radiolabel. All binding experiments were performed at 25°C in a 0.25-ml total volume of buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.4 mM EGTA, 12.5 mM MgCl2) using 0.1 mM phentolamine to determine nonspecific binding. Binding was stopped after reaching equilibrium by filtering the COS-1 cell membranes though Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters, followed by five 5-ml washes with cold buffer to remove any unbound drug. Quantitation of membrane-bound 125I-HEAT was determined by the cpm remaining on the glass fiber filters. From these results, affinity values of the radiolabel and selective AR ligands were calculated from radioligand binding curves generated using iterative nonlinear regression analysis (17Multulsky H.J. Ransnas L.A. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured using the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Total soluble inositol phosphate production was determined from transfected COS-1 cells that were prelabeled with [3H]inositol (1 μCi/ml) for 16-24 h prior to the assay. On the assay day, these COS-1 cells were washed with serum-free DMEM three times and then incubated in serum-free DMEM plus 10 mM LiCl at 25°C for 20 min. After addition of AR agonist, the COS-1 cells were incubated for an additional 45 min at 37°C. At the end of this incubation period, medium was removed and the transfected COS-1 cells lysed with 1 ml of cold 0.4 M perchloric acid. One-half volume of 0.72 M KOH, 0.6 M KHCO3 was added and the sample centrifuged at 2500 × g for 5 min to pellet the precipitate. The supernatant was applied to a 0.8-ml packed AG1-X8 column (Bio-Rad, 100-200-mesh, formate form) and washed with 8 ml of 0.1 M formic acid. Soluble inositol phosphates were then eluted from the column with 2 ml of 1 M ammonium formate, 0.1 M formic acid. The amount of [3H]inositol phosphate eluted from the column was counted and a concentration-response curve generated using iterative nonlinear regression analysis (17Multulsky H.J. Ransnas L.A. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). From this curve, the EC50 of the AR agonist used to increase total soluble inositol phosphates in transfected COS-1 cells was calculated. In separate and more sensitive studies, basal measurements for phospholipase C (PLC)-dependent inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) production was determined by a [3H]IP3 radioreceptor assay (DuPont) using the same pre-assay condition as described above. The runs test was used to determine if the data differed significantly from a linear relationship (p < 0.05). For each individual experiment, the fitted iterative nonlinear regression curve that best represented the data was determined using a partial f test (p < 0.05). Significance among groups was tested using a paired t test or one-way analysis of variance (p < 0.05). All values are reported as the mean ± S.E. of n experiments, each performed in duplicate. Site-directed mutagenesis of the natural Cys128 in TM 3 to a phenylalanine generated a mutated α1b-AR with documented properties of constitutive activity (14Perez D.M. Hwa J. Gaivin R. Mathur M. Brown F. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 112-122PubMed Google Scholar). To further investigate the molecular mechanism for this constitutive activation, saturation mutagenesis was performed at position 128 of the α1b-AR. These α1b-AR mutations were expressed on COS-1 cell membranes and their constitutively active properties examined. The amount of agonist-independent IP3 produced in these transfected COS-1 cells was quantified and normalized to α1b-AR density (Fig. 1A). The introduction of charged amino acids at position 128 of the α1b-AR generated no PLC-dependent intracellular signal. This most likely was caused by improper protein folding, since the epinephrine binding affinity for these poorly expressed α1b-AR mutations was dramatically reduced (Fig. 1B). In addition, similar inactive α1b-ARs were produced when substitution of amino acids that have β-substituents, such as proline or isoleucine, were introduced at this same position. The inability of these α1b-AR mutations to express functional proteins could be the result of unsuitable TM packing caused by either the early branching of these amino acid side chains or the inability of the TM to accommodate unpaired charges. However, greater amounts of basal IP3 were generated when tyrosine, threonine, leucine, methionine, and tryptophan were substituted at position 128 of the α1b-AR. The amounts of basal IP3 generated for these α1b-AR mutants was greater than the original phenylalanine mutation. This increased agonist-independent second messenger production correlated with a higher epinephrine binding affinity for these same α1b-AR mutations. These results suggest that substitution of long, bulky, or hydrophobic amino acids at position 128 are disturbing an intrinsic “constraining factor” of the α1b-AR. Similar results were noted for the characteristics of rhodopsin receptor activation via mutagenesis of a salt bridge constraint (11Robinson P.R. Cohen G.B. Zhukovsky E.A. Oprian D.D. Neuron. 1992; 9: 719-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). This implies a comparable mechanism may be conserved to the α1b-AR. If an α1b-AR salt bridge exists to hold the receptor protein in a basal conformation, then abolishing this ionic bond would allow the α1b-AR to adopt an active conformation that would have properties of a constitutively active receptor. To test this hypothesis, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to individually eliminate this charged amino acid pair by mutating the Lys331 to a neutral alanine or a negatively charged glutamic acid. Substitution of these amino acids should destroy the association between position 331 and the Asp125 postulated to occur in the WT α1b-AR. If these mutant α1b-ARs are adopting an active protein conformation, then the revised ternary complex model predicts that a higher AR agonist binding affinity would be observed. Therefore, ligand binding experiments using 125I-HEAT as the selective α1-AR radiolabeled antagonist was performed on transiently transfected COS-1 cell membranes. Saturation binding experiments revealed no changes in the affinity of 125I-HEAT for these mutant α1b-ARs compared to WT receptor (Table I). This suggests that no gross changes in the receptor's tertiary structure are caused by these point mutations. Competition binding experiments demonstrated a significantly higher epinephrine binding affinity for the mutant K331A compared with the WT α1b-AR (Table I). A calculated epinephrine Ki of 329 ± 53 nM for the K331A mutation was 6-fold greater than the 1860 ± 227 nM Ki value determined for the WT α1b-AR. This high affinity binding of epinephrine for the K331A α1b-AR was not altered by the presence of 0.1 mM Gpp(NH)p (data not shown). This indicates that the high affinity binding of epinephrine for this mutant α1b-AR is not due to enhanced G-protein precoupling but instead is an intrinsic property of the receptor ligand binding pocket. Significant increases in the norepinephrine and methoxamine binding affinity were also calculated for this same K331A mutation over the WT α1b-AR (Table I). In addition, similar AR agonist binding affinity changes were estimated for the K331E α1b-AR mutation (Table I). However, for both Lys331α1b-AR mutants, no binding affinity differences for selective α1-AR antagonists were noted when compared to the WT α1b-AR (Table I).Table ILigand binding affinity values for wild-type and mutant α1b-adrenergic receptorsWTK331AK331ED125AD125KnMAgonist(−)-Epinephrine1860 ± 227 (11)329 ± 53 (4)*676 ± 193 (4)*5636 ± 963 (3)*6471 ± 1352 (3)*(−)-Norepinephrine2990 ± 402 (7)410 ± 34 (4)*746 ± 143 (4)*NDNDMethoxamine492,000 ± 50,000 (3)165,000 ± 40,000 (3)*NDNDNDAntagonists125I-HEAT0.08 ± 0.02 (10)0.15 ± 0.06 (6)0.23 ±0.07 (7)0.12 ± 0.05 (4)0.07 ± 0.02 (4)Phentolamine52.8 ± 9.3 (2Minneman K.P.

As would be predicted for a constitutively active receptor, the potency of epinephrine to generate soluble [3H] inositol phosphates was significantly greater for the K331A mutant versus the WT α1b-AR (Fig. 2). The concentration of epinephrine needed to cause a half-maximal response was 381 ± 101 nM for the mutant K331A α1b-AR versus 1849 ± 537 nM for the WT receptor. Similar significant leftward shifts of the epinephrine EC50 value were also calculated for the K331E α1b-AR mutation (391 ± 89 nM) when compared to the WT receptor. The 6-fold increased potency of epinephrine to generate soluble inositol phosphates correlated to the 6-fold higher epinephrine binding affinity established for these Lys331α1b-AR mutants. These results are consistent with the agonist-dependent properties that describe constitutive receptor activation. The essential property for a constitutively active receptor is the capacity to generate intracellular second messenger in the absence of bound agonist. Agonist-independent production of IP3 in COS-1 cells transiently transfected with either the WT α1b-AR or one of the Lys331 mutations was quantified by a sensitive radioreceptor assay. This amount of IP3 was determined at various levels of α1b-AR density calculated from parallel saturation binding studies (Fig. 3A). The linear regression lines generated through the data points is an indication for the amount of IP3 produced per α1b-AR. The slope of the regression line calculated from these data points shows a greater increase in the amount of IP3 generated per Lys331 mutant receptor compared to the WT α1b-AR (Fig. 3B). The amount of IP3 produced for the K331A (6.5 ± 0.9 pmol/fmol) and the K331E (8.3 ± 0.8 pmol/fmol) α1b-AR mutations was significantly larger when compared to the WT receptor (2.9 ± 0.2 pmol/fmol). These results demonstrate the central distinctive element of agonist-independent receptor constitutive activity. In addition, these Lys331 mutants strongly suggest the importance of the natural residue for maintaining a basal configuration of the α1b-AR. The pharmacological characteristics of the Lys331α1b-AR mutations described previously suggest that a disassociation with the Asp125 counterion could be the mechanism of constitutive activation. If this hypothesis is correct, then eliminating the negative charge at position 125 should also generate constitutively active α1b-ARs. To investigate this possibility, the Asp125 of the WT α1b-AR was change to a neutral alanine or a positively charged lysine using site-directed mutagenesis. These mutant α1b-ARs were then examined for properties of receptor constitutive activity. Unlike previous studies, where this conserved aspartic acid was mutated in the α2- or β2-ARs, the Asp125α1b-AR mutations did demonstrate specific radioligand binding (19Wang C.-D. Buck M.A. Fraser C.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 168-179PubMed Google Scholar, 20Strader C.D. Gaffney T. Sugg E.E. Candelore M.R. Keys R. Patchett A.A. Dixon R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific radioligand binding has also been shown for similar aspartic acid counterion mutations in the serotonin receptor (21Ho B.Y. Karschin A. Branchek T. Davidson N. Lester H.A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The ligand binding properties for these Asp125α1b-AR mutations showed no significant changes in the Kd of 125I-HEAT when compared to WT receptor (Table I). This implies no gross changes in the structure of the ligand binding pocket for these Asp125α1b-AR mutants. In addition, no significant differences in the Ki of selective α1-AR antagonists were demonstrated (Table I). However, there was a significantly lowered epinephrine affinity for these Asp125 mutant receptors when compared to the WT α1b-AR (Table I). This decrease in the epinephrine binding affinity is likely due to the elimination of the conserved negative charged at position 125, shown in the β-AR system to be responsible for docking with the protonated amine of epinephrine (15Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). However, these data are the first to demonstrate in α1-ARs the significance of this conserved TM 3 aspartic acid as a contact point for epinephrine binding. Since this Asp125 is the counterion necessary for receptor docking with the protonated amine of epinephrine, determining AR agonist affinity and potency changes are no longer valid parameters for assessing the constitutively active properties of these Asp125α1b-AR mutations. The ability of these Asp125α1b-AR mutants to activate PLC in the absence of agonist was examined in transiently transfected COS-1 cells. The amount of IP3 generated in these COS-1 cells was quantified at various levels of α1b-AR density (Fig. 4A). A greater amount of agonist-independent IP3 was generated per Asp125 receptor mutant compared to WT α1b-AR (Fig. 4B). A significantly increased quantity of IP3 was produced by the D125A (15.4 ± 2.1 pmol/fmol) and D125K mutations (36.3 ± 5.0 pmol/fmol) when compared to the WT α1b-AR (2.9 ± 0.2 pmol/fmol). The greatest amount of agonist-independent IP3 generated per receptor was observed for the D125K α1b-AR mutation. The natural Asp125-Lys331α1b-AR salt bridge spans eight bond lengths across the agonist binding pocket. However, for the mutant D125K α1b-AR, both lysines contribute a total of 10 bond lengths into this new Lys125-Lys331 interface. This may cause an increased ionic antagonism due to the greater proximity of opposing positive charges. This increased repulsion caused by the Lys125-Lys331 interface has the greatest effect on agonist-independent properties of constitutive activity. The increased AR agonist binding affinities calculated for the Lys331α1b-AR mutants, as well as the elevated basal activity observed for both Lys331 and Asp125 receptor mutations, could alternately suggest that their apparent constitutive activity might be the result of higher levels of receptor occupancy due to the higher affinity for catecholamines present in the serum-containing culture media. However, two lines of reasoning dismiss this notion. First, the IP3 assays are performed in serum-free media after extensive washing of the transfected COS-1 cells. Second, epinephrine displays a lower binding affinity for these Asp125α1b-AR mutations when compared to WT or the Lys331 receptor mutants. Therefore, the higher basal IP3 activity documented for these Asp125α1b-AR mutations is not dependent upon the possibility of tightly binding to any catecholamines that maybe present. In summary, these results satisfy an important criteria in identifying these Asp125 receptor mutants as constitutively active α1b-ARs. In addition, this constitutively active property of these Asp125 mutations strongly suggests the existence of an Asp125-Lys331 salt bridge in the WT α1b-AR. A molecular mechanism for α1b-AR activation can now be hypothesized based upon the unique pharmacological properties of these salt bridge receptor mutations. When the α1b-AR ligand binding pocket is empty, a salt bridge between Lys331 in TM 7 and the Asp125 in TM 3 constrains the receptor in a basal activation state. This is analogous to what has been described for the rhodopsin receptor in the absence of light. However, unlike rhodopsin the endogenous agonist epinephrine is not covalently bound to the receptor and must dock in the ligand binding pocket. Upon docking, the protonated amine of epinephrine competes with the protonated amine of Lys331 for the Asp125 counterion's negative charge. The neutrality that results from competing with this Asp125 occurs because the basicity of epinephrine's protonated amine (pKa = 10) is similar to the alkaline properties of Lys331 (pKa = 10). Destruction of this salt bridge releases an α1b-AR structural constraint that allows a translational movement of the third TM helix toward the protonated amine of epinephrine. This TM 3 translational movement brings the Asp125 in closer proximity to the protonated amine of epinephrine, promoting the higher binding affinity observed for these α1b-AR salt bridge mutations. In addition, this translational movement of TM 3 enhances α1b-AR/G-protein interactions, causing an increased production of second messengers that leads to a physiological response. This molecular mechanism is also supported by recent work in rhodopsin, where a site-directed spin label study was employed to demonstrate a rigid body movement of the TM 3 helix during receptor activation in relationship to the other six TM bundles (22Farahbakhsh Z.T. Ridge K.D. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8812-8819Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The charged amino acid pairs that make up the rhodopsin and α1b-AR salt bridge are conserved in other G-protein-coupled receptors that are activated by biogenic amines. The negatively charged aspartic acid is highly conserved among all aminergic receptors and is analogous in both position and charge to the glutamic acid residue found in TM 3 of rhodopsin. In addition, the positive counter ion is also preserved between these aminergic and rhodopsin receptors, suggesting that a constraining salt bridge could be a common mechanism among these types of receptors. We also hypothesize that the constitutive activity documented for the C128F α1b-AR mutation is due to an enhanced translational movement of TM 3. Substitution of large, bulky or hydrophobic amino acids for the Cys128 residue were best for constitutively activating the α1b-AR (Fig. 1). For the C128F mutation, the proximity of this phenylalanine residue in the TM domain may be sufficient to physically disrupt the endogenous α1b-AR salt bridge, moving the Asp125 counterion toward the protonated amine of epinephrine. This may result from direct translational movement of TM 3 or could be indirectly due to the increased packing of this substituted phenylalanine against the second TM helix. These data also suggest that the activation mechanism for α1b-ARs may be different than what has been defined for β-ARs. Substituting a serine or asparagine for the conserved Asp113 in TM 3 of the β2-AR resulted in a 10,000-fold decreased affinity value for selective AR agonists and antagonists (15Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Since a 10,000-fold affinity difference equates to a free energy change of 9 kcal/mol, linkage to a single ligand-receptor contact point is unlikely. However, this evidence is used to support the role of the TM 3 aspartic acid in AR agonist binding. The 3-fold decreased epinephrine binding affinity for α1b-AR Asp125 mutations described in this report are not comparable to these β2-AR mutants. This differential affinity loss assigned to the elimination of the ionic bond between the protonated amine of epinephrine and the conserved TM 3 aspartic acid could be masked due to the constitutive activity documented for the Asp125α1b-AR but not the β2-AR mutations. Therefore, a better estimate of the free energy change due to elimination of this ionic bond would be to compare epinephrine's Ki value for the K331A and the D125A α1b-AR mutants. This affinity difference is actually 17-fold (329 ± 53 nM versus 5636 ± 963 nM), which equates more reasonably to a typical salt bridge interaction of 3 kcal/mol that would be formed between Asp125 and the protonated amine of epinephrine. The discrepancies between these analogous AR mutagenesis studies may be explained by the type of amino acids substituted for the conserved aspartic acid counterion. For example, the asparagine or serine substituted for Asp113 of the β2-AR may still hydrogen-bond with Lys305 in TM 7, mimicking the constraining properties of a WT receptor salt bridge. However, in the β2-AR studies, no definitive experiments were performed that would establish any constitutively active properties for these receptor mutants. Recent work has documented important interactions between AR agonists and specific serine residues in TM 5 that cause a functional response in α1a-ARs (23Hwa J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6322-6327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This suggests that a change in the position of TM 5 may also be important for α1-AR activation. Therefore, disruption of the interhelical salt bridge that leads to a translational movement of TM 3 is not the only agonist-dependent mechanism for α1-AR activation. However, disruption of this Asp125-Lys331 salt bridge may represent the first event in α1b-AR activation initiated by docking of the endogenous ligand. This would imply that epinephrine takes an active role to change the conformation of the α1b-AR by unlocking a physical constraint on the receptor structure similar to what is established for rhodopsin. This dynamic function of the AR agonist is in contrast to a postulated passive role that would “trap” a naturally isomerizing α1b-AR in the activated protein configuration (see Ref. 24Kenakin T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 188-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar for review). In addition, this salt bridge also represents the molecular explanation for at least part of the “constraining factor” suggested by others that holds the α1b-AR in a basal configuration until bound by the receptor agonist (12Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1430-1433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability to constitutively activate α1b-ARs, by substituting many types of amino acids at multiple and diversified positions in the protein, suggests the importance of maintaining the basal conformation of the WT receptor (12Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1430-1433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Perez D.M. Hwa J. Gaivin R. Mathur M. Brown F. Graham R.M. Mol.

Epinephrine may in fact be a molecular switch releasing the stored potential energy of the α1b-AR salt bridge constraint. This allows the α1b-AR to adopt the activated “lowest energy” configuration, therefore, suggesting that epinephrine is not involved in stabilizing or selecting for the activated (R*) state of the receptor. The maintenance of basal protein structure by the α1b-AR salt bridge may regulate the physiological response of receptor activation until authorized by chemical signals from the sympathetic nervous system. Hence, the important protein configuration to understand in α1b-AR activation is not the easily attainable “activated state” but instead the highly regulated “inactive state” of the receptor. This understanding would serve to provide insights into receptor structure-function and further investigations in drug development."

Secretory granules from bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells contain a complex mixture of secretory products that include low molecular mass constituents such as catecholamines, ascorbate, nucleotides, calcium, enkephalins, and several water-soluble proteins. Among the latter, dopamine-β-hydroxylase, proenkephalin-A, and the chromogranins/secretogranins have been extensively studied. Chromogranins, which are widely distributed in endocrine and neuroendocrine cells and in neurons, are a family of acidic soluble proteins (1Simon J.P. Aunis D. Biochem.

At the subcellular level, chromogranins are exclusively found in the soluble core of hormone and neurotransmitter storage vesicles and are released during exocytosis.

(40% of total soluble granule proteins) is a single polypeptide chain of 431 residues. The difference between the apparent (70 kDa) and theoretical molecular mass (48 kDa) probably results from post-translational modifications (i.e. glycosylation, phosphorylation, and sulfation) and the abundance of acidic residues (25%), which cause a slower migration during electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (see Ref. 5Dillen L.

The proteolytic processing of CGA is a topic of growing interest as biological activities have been attributed to specific domains of CGA. Several of these CGA-derived peptides act predominantly as inhibitors of hormone and neurotransmitter release, either as autocrine or paracrine controls. For example, CGA is the precursor of pancreastatin (248-293), a peptide that negatively modulates insulin secretion from endocrine pancreatic islets (7Tatemoto K. Efendic S. Mutt V. Makk G.

Greeley G.H. Cohn D.V. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). As early as 1988, it was established that CGA is the precursor of a peptide that inhibits the secretory activity of chromaffin cells (12Simon J.P. Bader M.F. Aunis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A second antibacterial peptide, enkelytin (20Goumon Y. Strub J.M. Moniatte M. Nullans G. Poteur L. Hubert P. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 516-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), derived from proenkephalin (209-237), was then identified among the numerous peptides present in the intragranular matrix. As a continuation of these studies, the present paper reports the antibacterial activity of a large CGA fragment (residues 79-431) generated by natural cleavage at the previously described site 78-79 (6Metz-Boutigue M.H. Garcia-Sablone P. Hogue-Angeletti R. Aunis D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 145: 659-676Crossref Scopus (435) Google Scholar). This CGA fragment was detectable in the intragranular matrix, was released during exocytosis and furthermore inhibited the growth of both Gram-positive (Micrococcus luteus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria. In view of the large size of this antibacterial CGA fragment, the aim of the present paper was to characterize the shortest active peptide derived from this fragment. After proteolysis of the whole CGA molecule, active peptides located in the 79-431 region were analyzed using a combination of microsequencing and mass spectrometry. We isolated several peptides that shared the same 173-194 sequence but differed by glycosylation and phosphorylation modifications. Their sequence has no homology with the previously described sequences of antibacterial peptides. Structural features and more particularly post-translational modifications are discussed in relation with their antibacterial activity. Secretory granules were isolated from bovine adrenal medulla (21Smith A.D. Winkler H. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and soluble proteins were separated from membranes after lysis and centrifugation (22Aunis D. Bouclier M. Pescheloche M. Mandel P. J. Neurochem. 1977; 29: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). CGA was purified by HPLC on a Macherey Nagel Nucleosil 300-5C18 column (4 × 250 mm; particle size: 5 μm and pore size: 100 nm) with the Applied Biosystems HPLC system 140 B as described previously (18Strub J.M. Garcia-Sablone P. Lonning K. Taupenot L. Hubert P. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 356-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Then, CGA (10 nmol) was digested for 2 h at 37°C with endoproteinase Lys-C at a protein-to-proteinase weight ratio of 1000:1 in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3. Generated peptides were then separated on a Macherey Nagel 300-5C18 column. Absorbance was monitored at 214 nm, and the solvent system consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 30% water, 69.9% acetonitrile (solvent B). Material was eluted at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min using successively a gradient of 0-25% B in A over 10 min followed by a gradient of 25-75% over 50 min. Each peak fraction was manually collected and concentrated by evaporation, but not to dryness. The sequence of purified CGA-derived peptides was determined in our laboratory by automatic Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 473 A microsequencer. Samples (100 pmol) were loaded onto polybrene-treated and precycled glass-fiber filters (6Metz-Boutigue M.H. Garcia-Sablone P. Hogue-Angeletti R. Aunis D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 145: 659-676Crossref Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In order to identify phosphorylated residues, samples were modified with ethanethiol according to the method previously described (23Meyer H.E. Hoffmann-Posorke E. Korte H. Heilmeyer L.M.G. FEBS Lett. 1986; 204: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Before sequencing, reagents were removed, using the ProSpin sample preparation cartridge (Applied Biosystems, a division of Perkin-Elmer), and the modified peptide was loaded on the ProBlott polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Applied Biosystems). Determination of mass was carried out on a Brucker BIFLEX™ matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF) equipped with the SCOUT™ high resolution optics with X-Y multisample probe, a gridless reflector and the HIMAS™ linear detector. This instrument has a maximum accelerating potential of 30 kV and may be operated either in the linear or reflector mode. Ionization was accomplished with a 337-nm beam from a nitrogen laser with a repetition rate of 3 Hz. The output signal from the detector was digitized at a sampling rate of 250 MHz in linear mode and 500 MHz in reflector mode using a 1-GHz digital oscilloscope (Lecroy model). The instrument control and data processing were accomplished with software supplied by Bruker using a Sun Sparc workstation. These studies were realized using as the matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid obtained from Sigma and prepared as a saturated solution in acetone. Aliquots (1-2 μl) of the sample matrix solution were deposited onto probe tips and dried by ambient air. After fast spreading and fast evaporation of the solvent, we obtained a thin layer of matrix crystals (24Vorm O. Mann M. J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spec. 1994; 5: 955-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 25Vorm O. Roepstorff P. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 3281-3287Crossref Scopus (644) Google Scholar). A micromolar analyte solution was applied to the matrix and allowed to dry under moderate vacuum. This preparation was washed by applying 1 μl of a 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid in water solution and then flushed after a few seconds. This cleaning procedure often allows an increase in sensitivity and mass accuracy by removing the remaining alkali cations. Carbohydrate analysis was performed using gas chromatography with a silicone OV 101 capillary column (0.32 mm × 25 m). Samples were analyzed after methanolysis (0.5 M hydrochloric acid-methanol for 24 h at 80°C), N-reacetylation, and trimethylsilylation (26Kamerling J.P. Gerwig G.J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Clamp J.R. Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 27Montreuil J. Bouquelet S. Debray H. Fournet B. Spik G. Strecker G. Chaplin M.F. Kennedy J.F. Carbohydrate Analysis, A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1986: 143-204Google Scholar). Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed under reducing conditions on 4-20% gradient polyacrylamide gels (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar) using 10 μg of protein/lane. After migration, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (29Vaessen R.T.M.J. Kreike J. Groot G.S.P. FEBS Lett. 1981; 124: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The different lanes were then separated and treated with polyvinylpyrrolidone (2% in Tris-buffered saline, TBS). Desialylation of one-half of the lanes was performed by treatment with 50 mU/ml of sialidase from Clostridium perfringens in 50 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0, 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% CaCl2 for 16 h at 37°C prior incubation with the digoxigenin-labeled lectins. Two lanes (desialylated and not desialylated) were incubated with each lectin: Amaranthus caudatus (ACA-dig, 2.5 μg/ml in TBS), Maackia amurensis (MAA-dig, 5 μg/ml in TBS), Arachis hypogaea agglutinin (PNA-dig, 2 μg/ml in TBS), and Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA-dig, 2 mg/ml in TBS). Then, the nitrocellulose strips were incubated for 1 h with anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase-labeled Fab fragments (1 μg/ml in TBS). After washing, labeled glycoproteins were revealed by 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate staining. Bacteria were grown aerobically at 37°C in yeast extract-free Luria-Bertani medium (1% Bactotryptone and 0.5% NaCl (m/v), pH 7.5). Antimicrobial activity was determined by measuring growth inhibition of M. luteus (strain A270), Bacillus megaterium (strain M A) and E. coli (strain D22) in Luria-Bertani medium (30Bulet P. Dimarck J.L. Hetru C. Lagueux M. Charlet M. Hegy G. Van Dorsselaer A. Hoffman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14893-14897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of peptide extract (200 pmol; 10 μl) were incubated in microtiter plates with 100 μl of a midlogarithmic phase culture of bacteria with starting absorbance at 620 nm of 0.001. Microbial growth was assessed by the increase of A620 nm after 16 h incubation at 37°C (M. luteus and E. coli) or 20°C (B. megaterium). The A620 nm value of control cultures grown in the absence of peptide (10 μl of water in place of peptide solution) was taken as 100%. Bovine erythrocytes were isolated and the buffy coat removed by centrifugation of freshly collected blood at 1000 × g for 5 min and washing three times with 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 0.9% NaCl (NaCl/Pi). Erythrocytes (45 μl) were incubated at 37°C over 40 min in NaCl/Pi with 4 and 8 μM of a mixture of glycosylated/phosphorylated CGA-derived peptides (5 μl). Then, incubation media were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min and aliquots (30 μl) of supernatant were diluted in water (1 ml). The absorbance of the diluted solution was measured at 420 nm. The absorbance obtained after treating erythrocytes with 2% SDS was taken as 100%. Peptides were synthesized in our laboratory on an Applied Biosystems 432 A peptide synthesizer, SYNERGY, using the stepwise solid-phase synthetic approach and Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) chemistry (31Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2149-2154Crossref Scopus (6651) Google Scholar). All residues were incorporated with double coupling. Peptides were further purified by reverse phase HPLC on a Brownlee Aquapore OD-300 (7 × 250 mm) and lyophilized. Sequence alignment of bovine CGA (173-194) with corresponding fragments of CGA and CGB for different species was performed using the Clustal V multiple sequence alignment program (32Higgins D.G. Bleasby A.J. Fuchs R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 189-191PubMed Google Scholar) using default parameters. Chromogranin sequences were retrieved from the Swiss-Prot data base. Bovine chromaffin granules contain a large number of chromogranin- and proenkephalin-A-derived peptides. When the soluble intragranular material or the secreted fragments from K+-depolarized chromaffin cells were separated by HPLC and their effects on the growth of M. luteus (Gram-positive bacteria) and E. coli (Gram-negative bacteria) tested, antibacterial activity was detected in several fractions. With soluble granule matrix proteins as starting material (Fig. 1A), active fractions inhibiting the growth of both these bacteria were recovered in a group of peaks (a1 in Fig. 1A1), where proenkephalin-A and CGA-derived peptides were identified. After a second purification step by HPLC, an active fraction (a2) corresponding to a fragment with N-terminal end starting on position 79 in CGA sequence was identified. After monodimensional gel electrophoresis, the apparent molecular mass of this fragment was estimated to 63 kDa. This value corresponds to the large CGA fragment 79-431 reported previously (6Metz-Boutigue M.H. Garcia-Sablone P. Hogue-Angeletti R. Aunis D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 145: 659-676Crossref Scopus (435) Google Scholar). We also looked for antibacterial activity in material released from K+-stimulated cultured chromaffin cells (Fig. 1B). The same active CGA 79-431 fragment was isolated (fraction b2). Microsequencing revealed a unique N-terminal end, and electrophoresis separation showed a single component with an apparent molecular mass of 63 kDa. This fragment displays antibacterial activity, inducing a 100% inhibition of bacterial growth at a concentration of 1.5 μM. In order to characterize the shortest active sequence included in this large fragment 79-431, CGA was submitted to proteolysis with endoproteinase Lys-C and after separation by HPLC on a reverse-phase C18 column, the generated fragments were tested for their antibacterial activity, and peptide structure was determined by combination of microsequencing and mass spectrometry analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, peptides inhibiting M. luteus growth were found in three successive peaks numbered 1 to 3. Complete sequencing of material present in peaks 1-3 indicated that it was the same peptide located in position 173-194 (Fig. 2B). This peptide was also recovered in the neighboring peak 4, but no bacterial activity was found in this fraction. The sequence (173-194) of this peptide was included in the large fragment described previously (Fig. 1), and its elution as four different subspecies suggested post-translational modifications. The sequencing of peptides present in peaks 1 and 4 showed unambiguously PTH-(Tyr173, Ser182, and Ser191), whereas in peaks 1 and 2, the PTH-Ser186 was not detectable, thus indicating a possible O-glycosylation on this residue. According to structure analysis reported by Wilson (33Wilson I.B.H. Gavel Y. Von Heijne G. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), the statistically significant patterns PS/T and S/TXXP predict O-glycosylation sites, and the sequence around residue Ser186 (PSQGP) fits with these two characteristic patterns. In addition, Ser182 (KEDSEG) is located in a consensus phosphorylation site by protein kinase C (K/RXXS/T). To further determine the structure of the 173-194 peptide subspecies, mass spectrometry analyses were initiated using the MALDI-TOF technique. The lower mass value (2317 Da) was obtained for the inactive peptide present in fraction 4; this value corresponds to the theoretical mass of the unmodified peptide 173-194. Mass values of 3055, 2974, and 2397 Da were found for peptide species recovered in fractions 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Mass value comparison of predominant peptides present in peaks 1/2 (2974 Da/3055 Da) and in peaks 3/4 (2317 Da/2397 Da) indicated a difference of 80 Da, revealing the presence of a phosphorylated or sulfated residue. Analysis of minor components showed masses of 3070 Da/2763 Da in peak 1 and 2990 Da/2682 Da in peak 2. The differences 3055/2763 and 2974/2682 were similar (292 Da), suggesting that the same moiety has been removed from the two major species in peaks 1 and 2. The difference between the two masses 3070 and 3055 Da in peak 1 and 2990 and 2974 Da in peak 2 was 16 and 15 Da, which corresponds to the oxidation state +1. In addition, the comparison of the masses corresponding to the 3055- and 2974-Da fragments present in peaks 1 and 2 with the masses of 2397 and 2317 Da fragments in peaks 3 and 4, respectively, revealed a similar difference value of 657 Da. The material present in peak 3 (Fig. 2A) was first treated with alkaline phosphatase treatment to verify whether this peptide was phosphorylated (additional mass: 79 Da) or sulfated (additional mass: 80 Da). After mass spectrometry analysis, we observed the removal of a mass of 79 Da, indicating that this peptide was phosphorylated. To identify the amino acid bearing the post-translational phosphorylation, the 173-194 peptide from peak 3 was submitted to the Meyer modification in presence of ethanethiol (23Meyer H.E. Hoffmann-Posorke E. Korte H. Heilmeyer L.M.G. FEBS Lett. 1986; 204: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) prior to sequencing, a method which identified the phosphoserine residue as PTH-S-ethylcysteine. We found that residues Ser182, Ser186, and Ser191 were not phosphorylated whereas the N-terminal residue Tyr173 was modified. However, PTH-Leu was unexpectedly recovered instead of PTH-Tyr. Sequencing of peptide present in peak 4 clearly showed that Tyr173 was unmodified. Similarly, PTH-Leu was obtained as the N-terminal residue when peptide present in peak 1 was submitted to the Meyer modification before sequencing. It is noteworthy that Ser182 residue, which is a putative substrate for protein kinase C, was not phosphorylated in any fraction. The molar carbohydrate composition was performed on the 173-194 peptide isolated from peak 2 using a gas chromatography. The carbohydrates NeuAc, Gal, and GalNAc were detected in a molar ratio of 1:1:1. Using similar experimental conditions, a similar molar ratio was also obtained for the whole purified CGA protein, suggesting a unique structure for the different glycan chains distributed along the protein. To obtain more structural information, the strategy was to electrotransfer purified CGA onto nitrocellulose sheet and to use a panel of lectins, the specificity of which is detailed in Fig. 3A. As shown in Fig. 3B, CGA was not recognized by SNA-dig lectin (lane 1), whereas a 70-kDa band was revealed with MAA-dig lectin (lane 2); the binding of this lectin to CGA is abolished with sialidase treatment (lane 6). This result indicated that sialic acid residues are in a α2-3 linkage and that no α2-6-linked sialic acid residues are present in CGA glycans. In addition, ACA-dig lectin decorated a similar band prior to or after sialidase treatment (lanes 4 and 8, respectively), whereas PNA-dig lectin only bound to the glycoprotein after desialylation (lane 7). The two lectins recognized the T-antigen (Galβ1-3GalNAcα1-O-Ser) with the difference that ACA lectin is also able to bind to the cryptic T-antigen. Desialylation clearly indicated that all the Galβ1-3GalNAcα1-O-Ser sequences in CGA are sialylated. Taken together these data suggest that the different glycosylation sites in CGA are on serine residues and are composed of the trisaccharide NeuAcα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAcα1 O-linked to a serine residue. In the glycopeptide 173-194 this glycan moiety is linked to Ser186. The calculated molecular mass of this glycan is 655 and corresponds to the experimental value determined from mass spectrometry (Fig. 2). In 1991, Wilson reported the structural requirements for the addition of O-linked N-acetylgalactosamine to proteins (33Wilson I.B.H. Gavel Y. Von Heijne G. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar): the most prominent feature in the vicinity of O-glycosylated sites is a significantly increased frequency of proline residues, especially at positions −1 and +3 relative to the glycosylated residue. In the glycopeptide 173-194, a characteristic sequence pattern PSQGP surrounds the Ser186 O-glycosylation site. Table I reports the detailed mass spectra analysis of fractions 1-4 (Fig. 2C): (i) mass spectra analysis of fraction 1 revealed the presence of a major component corresponding to the tyrosine phosphorylated form of the CGA 173-194 glycopeptide carrying in addition the trisaccharide moiety (3055 Da) and that of two minor components corresponding to the loss of NeuAc residue (−291 Da; 2763 Da) for the lighter component and the addition of an oxygen atom (+16 Da; 3070 Da) for the other; (ii) in fraction 2 the predominant component (2974 Da) is the nonphosphorylated CGA 173-194 glycopeptide, while the two minor species corresponded to the loss of NeuAc residue (2682 Da) for one and the addition of an oxygen atom (2990 Da) for the other; (iii) the major peptide in fraction 3 was the phosphorylated form (2397 Da) of the CGA 173-194 peptide devoid of the serine-linked glycan structure; (iv) fraction 4 contained the nonphosphorylated/nonglycosylated fragment (2317 Da) of the CGA 173-194 peptide; (v) in all preparations of CGA digested with endoproteinase Lys-C, the ratio of peaks 2 and 3 appears constant, whereas the ratio of peaks 1 and 4 was more variable between preparations.Table IMolecular masses of peptide material contained in HPLC fractions 1-4Fraction numberMolecular mass (Da)Phosphorylated peptideGlycosylated peptideOxidation state1GP-chromacin3055++03070++12763++ (−291)02G-chromacin2974−+02990−+12682−+ (−292)03P-chromacin2397+−042317−−0 Open table in a new tab As shown in Fig. 4, CGA peptides present in fractions 1-3 inhibited the growth of M. luteus (strain A 270), but were inactive toward E. coli (strain D22). B. megaterium (strain M A) was affected only by the peptide present in fraction 1. Complete inhibition of bacteria growth was reached for a peptide concentration around 1.5 μM. In contrast, unmodified CGA 173-194 from fraction 4 was totally inactive. These results suggest the importance of these post-translational modifications for antibacterial activity. As a control, in order to demonstrate that the antibacterial activity was not due to nonpeptidic material present in the fractions, we digested extract aliquots (10 μl) of the endogenous material present in fraction 1 to proteolysis with trypsin (enzyme/peptide ratio of 1:50) for 24 h at 37°C. The resulting mixture of tryptic peptides (YPGPQAK, EDSEGPSQGPASR, and EK as determined by microsequencing) had no effects on M. luteus and B. megaterium growth (Fig. 4), showing that the N-terminal moiety 173-179 (phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated) and the two C-terminal residues (E, K) are essential for antibacterial activity. Antibacterial peptides corresponding to the phosphorylated/glycosylated forms of CGA 173-194 did not cause hemolysis of bovine erythrocytes. We propose to name these antibacterial peptides chromacin: chromacin-P, chromacin-G, and chromacin-PG, respectively, for phosphorylated, glycosylated, and"

It is palmitoylated and tightly associated with the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane, endosomes, and lysosomes. To localize the acylation site(s) and the putative membrane-targeting domain, a number of deletions were made in the nsp1 gene. Most deletions resulted in the expression of nonpalmitoylated, enzymatically inactive, cytoplasmic protein. Palmitate could be released from Nsp1 with neutral hydroxylamine, indicating a thioester linkage to a cysteine residue. Therefore we mutated the conserved cysteine residues of Nsp1 to alanine. Triple mutation of Cys418, Cys419, and Cys420 resulted in nonpalmitoylated Nsp1, which was enzymatically active and still associated with membranes. However, it could be released from the membranes with 1 M NaCl, whereas 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 12) was required to release wild type Nsp1, suggesting a conversion from an integral to a peripheral membrane protein. Indirect confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed that the nonpalmitoylated Nsp1 colocalized with the plasma membrane marker, concanavalin A. However, it was not detected in filopodia, which were heavily stained in cells expressing wild type Nsp1. These results indicate that the acylation of Nsp1 was not needed for its targeting to the plasma membrane, but it was necessary for the migration to the filopodial extensions of the plasma membrane.

Semliki Forest virus (SFV), 1The abbreviations used are: SFVSemliki Forest viruswtwild typePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. a member of alphaviruses, is an enveloped animal virus with a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity (1Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Replication of alphaviruses occurs in association with modified endosomes and lysosomes (2Grimley P.M. Berezesky I.K.

The viral RNA genome is translated to a large polyprotein, which is autocatalytically processed into four nonstructural proteins, Nsp1-4. Each ns protein is essential for the RNA replication of the virus (1Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of their functions have been elucidated by genetic criteria and by expressing them individually in different host cells. Recent studies have shown that Nsp1 is a guanine-7-methyltransferase and a putative guanylyltransferase (5Mi S. Durbin R.K. Huang H.V. Rice C.M. Stollar V. Virology. 1989; 170: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 6Laakkonen P. Hyvönen M. Peränen J. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7418-7425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ahola T.

Nsp1 is specifically associated with the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane, endosomes, and lysosomes both in transfected and in infected cells. It has been suggested that Nsp1 is responsible for targeting of the replication complex to membranes (8Peränen J. Laakkonen P. Hyvönen M. Kääriäinen L. Virology. 1995; 208: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, Nsp1 is palmitoylated and tightly bound to membranes (8Peränen J. Laakkonen P. Hyvönen M. Kääriäinen L. Virology. 1995; 208: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), although it does not contain any stretches of hydrophobic amino acids that might constitute a membrane-spanning domain, suggesting that palmitate might be responsible for its membrane association. Semliki Forest virus wild type polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein palmitoylation in eukaryotic cells has been widely studied, because a number of cellular and viral proteins are fatty acylated by the addition of palmitate (see Refs. 9McIlhinney R.A.J.

This C16 saturated fatty acid is added post-translationally to proteins through an ester bond. In contrast to other lipid modifications, such as myristoylation and prenylation, palmitoylation is often reversible and the palmitate moiety turns over with a half-time considerably shorter than that of the protein to which it is attached. Palmitoylation is responsible for the membrane association of Ras (13Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), α-subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins (16Wedegaertner P.B. Chu D.H. Wilson P.T. Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25001-25008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a cellular 64-kDa protein (17James G. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20998-21006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work we have localized the palmitate attachment site of SFV Nsp1 to cysteine residues 418-420 and studied the effects of palmitoylation on Nsp1 using a nonpalmitoylated derivative. The absence of palmitate reduced the hydrophobicity of Nsp1 and converted it to a loosely attached peripheral membrane protein. Acylation significantly affected the subcellular distribution of Nsp1, because only the palmitoylated Nsp1 was detected in the filopodial extensions of the plasma membrane. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 100 units/ml of both penicillin and streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The vTF7-3 recombinant vaccinia virus stock was prepared in HeLa cells as described previously (18Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar). DNA manipulations were done according to standard methods (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Deletions were made to plasmids pTSF1 (20Peränen J. Characterization of Semliki Forest Virus Nonstructural Proteins. Ph. D. Thesis, Yliopistopaino, Helsinki1990Google Scholar) and pBAT-Nsp1 (6Laakkonen P. Hyvönen M. Peränen J. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7418-7425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which contain the nsp1 gene under the T7 promoter using appropriate restriction enzymes. Thereafter T4 DNA polymerase/mung bean nuclease was used to chew away or fill in nucleotides to maintain the reading frame. Deleting amino acids 2-64 was done with NcoI and EcoRV, amino acids 121-148 with PstI and BglI, amino acids 141-197 with PmaCI and PflmI, amino acids 189-286 with NheI and SnaBI, amino acids 238-319 with Tth111l, and amino acids 461-488 with StuI and MluI. C-terminal deletions Δ270-537 and Δ430-537 were generated by polymerase chain reaction with a common upstream primer 5′-TATACCATGGCCGCCAAAGTGCATGT-3′ and two downstream primers (i) 5′-ACTAAGCTTAACCTTTCAGGTGGAATACGG-3′ corresponding to nucleotides 788-807 of nsp1 coding region and (ii) 5′-CTCAAGCTTACTTCCTCGTTTTAAATGCCC-3′ corresponding to nucleotides 1265-1284, both with 10 additional nucleotides containing a HindIII recognition site. The conserved cysteine residues in nsp1 gene (see Fig. 1) were changed to alanines in plasmid pTSF1 using the unique site elimination (U.S.E.) mutagenesis kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. The sequence of mutated regions was verified by the dideoxy chain termination method using the T7 sequencing kit (Pharmacia). To determine the enzymatic activities, the mutated proteins were expressed in E. coli as described for wild type (wt) Nsp1 (6Laakkonen P. Hyvönen M. Peränen J. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7418-7425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crude cell lysate of E. coli expressing Nsp1 derivatives was used in these assays. Guanine-7-methyltransferase activity was measured using S-adenosyl[methyl-3H]methionine as the methyl donor and GTP as the acceptor for methyl group as described earlier (6Laakkonen P. Hyvönen M. Peränen J. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7418-7425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assay for covalent complex formation between 7-methyl-GMP and Nsp1, the cell lysate was incubated with [α-32P]GTP and S-adenosylmethionine as described (7Ahola T. Kääriäinen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Transfection of HeLa cells was as described earlier (8Peränen J. Laakkonen P. Hyvönen M. Kääriäinen L. Virology. 1995; 208: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The amount of DNA and lipids used was as follows: for 35-mm dishes, 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 8 μl of lipofectamine (Life Technologies Inc.); for 60-mm dishes, 4 μg of DNA and 25 μl of lipofectamine; and for 100-mm dishes 10 μg of DNA and 50 μl of lipofectamine. Recombinant vaccinia virus (vTF7-3)-infected HeLa cells were transfected with derivatives of pTSF1 containing the desired gene under the T7 promoter. Transfected cells were labeled with 100 μCi/ml of [35S]methione-cysteine (Amersham Corp.) for 60 min starting at 2 h post-transfection in methione- and cysteine-free minimum Eagle's medium, followed by 30 min of chase in minimum Eagle's medium containing 2 mM methionine and cysteine. For [3H]palmitate labeling the cells were incubated with 60 μCi/ml of [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (Amersham Corp.) in minimum Eagle's medium for 3 h starting at 2 h post-transfection. The expression levels of truncated and other mutant proteins were controlled by Western blotting. Postnuclear supernatant was obtained from homogenized HeLa cell lysates by pelleting the nuclei at 500 × g for 10 min. Flotation analysis was done as described previously (8Peränen J. Laakkonen P. Hyvönen M. Kääriäinen L. Virology. 1995; 208: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected from the bottom, and half of each fraction was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Corp.), and immunoprecipitation with anti-Nsp1 antiserum was done as described earlier (6Laakkonen P. Hyvönen M. Peränen J. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7418-7425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Peränen J. Takkinen K. Kalkkinen N. Kääriäinen L. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 2165-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 as described (6Laakkonen P. Hyvönen M. Peränen J. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7418-7425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-human transferrin receptor was used in a 1:20 dilution as described (8Peränen J. Laakkonen P. Hyvönen M. Kääriäinen L. Virology. 1995; 208: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For plasma membrane staining the cells were treated with rhodamine-conjugated concanavalin A (Sigma) in a 1:500 dilution before permeabilization of the cells. Thereafter stained cells were refixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. For double labeling the cells were permeabilized and stained with anti-Nsp1 antiserum in a 1:500 dilution, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated swine anti-rabbit antibody (DAKO). Fluorescence-stained cells were analyzed with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus) and a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss). 1,4-Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) (Sigma) was used as a final concentration of 1% in the mounting mixture (phosphate-buffered saline:glycerol, 1:1) to inhibit the fading of the fluorescence in confocal studies. We have previously shown that SFV Nsp1 is palmitoylated and specifically associated with the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane, endosomes, and lysosomes both in SFV-infected and in nsp1-transfected cells (6Laakkonen P. Hyvönen M. Peränen J. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7418-7425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Peränen J. Laakkonen P. Hyvönen M. Kääriäinen L. Virology. 1995; 208: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A deletion series was prepared using suitable restriction enzymes with the aim to characterize the domain(s) responsible for palmitate attachment and membrane targeting of Nsp1 (Fig. 1). These truncated Nsp1 derivatives were synthesized in HeLa cells using the recombinant vaccinia virus (vTF7-3) expression system (18Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar). Proteins were labeled with [3H]palmitate for 3 h starting at 2 h post-transfection, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-Nsp1 antiserum, and the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The expression levels of the truncated proteins were verified by Western blotting, and they were similar to those of the wt Nsp1 (data not shown). Only one of the mutant proteins, with deletion of amino acid residues 461-488, was labeled with [3H]palmitate to about the same extent as wt Nsp1. Another protein with a C-terminal truncation (Δ430-537) was labeled to a barely detectable extent, whereas no labeling was observed with the rest of the truncated proteins (Fig. 1). The association of the [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled truncated proteins with membranes was studied by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation (8Peränen J. Laakkonen P. Hyvönen M. Kääriäinen L. Virology. 1995; 208: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). None of the proteins with deletions within the N-terminal half of Nsp1 floated with membranes to the top of the gradient. A protein with a minor C-terminal deletion (Δ461-488) floated with the membranes like wt Nsp1 (see Fig. 5A). Larger deletions (Δ430-537 and Δ270-537) resulted in about a 50% decrease in the membrane association (Fig. 1). The intracellular localization of the truncated proteins and wt Nsp1 was studied using indirect immunofluorescence. Cells expressing wt Nsp1 showed bright staining of the plasma membrane with extensive decoration of filopodia-like extensions (Fig. 2A). Identical fluorescence staining was observed with the deletion mutant Δ461-488 (data not shown). All deletion mutants, which had lost their membrane association, showed cytoplasmic fluorescence similar to that demonstrated for mutant Δ121-148 (Fig. 2B). Plasma membrane staining without visible filopodia was seen in cells transfected with the mutant Δ430-537 (Fig. 2C), which was partially membrane-associated according to flotation analysis. In addition, cytoplasmic vesicular structures were stained in cells expressing protein with the large C-terminal deletion (Δ270-537; Fig. 2D).Fig. 2Subcellular distribution of the truncated derivatives of Nsp1. Recombinant vaccinia virus-infected cells were transfected with the desired plasmid. The cells were fixed at 3 h post-transfection with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with Triton X-100 and stained with anti-Nsp1 antiserum, followed by rhodamine-conjugated swine anti-rabbit antibodies.

Hyvönen M. Peränen J. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7418-7425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ahola T. Kääriäinen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The mutant Δ461-488 showed reduced activity in both assays. All the other deletion mutants were completely inactive (Fig. 1). The loss of enzymatic activities and loss of the ability to become palmitoylated was not due to the instability of the proteins because they were detected in Western blots using anti-Nsp1 antibody in amounts similar to the wild type Nsp1. Because our recent work indicated that Nsp1 contains at least one palmitoyl group sensitive to alkaline methanolysis (8Peränen J. Laakkonen P. Hyvönen M. Kääriäinen L. Virology. 1995; 208: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we further investigated the properties of palmitate linkage in Nsp1. Incubation with hydroxylamine at neutral pH leads to hydrolysis of the thioester bond between the palmitate and cysteine, whereas alkaline pH is needed to hydrolyze oxyester bonds between palmitate and serine or threonine (22Pepperberg D.R. Morrison D.F. O'Brien P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 348-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 3, the [3H]palmitate label was released from Nsp1 by hydroxylamine treatment at neutral pH. Coomassie Blue staining of a duplicate gel confirmed that this treatment did not remove Nsp1 from the gel (data not shown). These results indicate that palmitate was linked to Nsp1 via a thioester bond to a cysteine residue. Because deletion analysis did not reveal the region for palmitate attachment, we mutated the cysteine residues of Nsp1 conserved in alphaviruses (Fig. 1) to alanines. Mutant proteins were expressed in HeLa cells to assay for [3H]palmitic acid incorporation. Because the expression levels differed significantly, [3H]palmitate incorporation (Fig. 4A) was normalized by estimating the amount of the respective proteins by laser densitometry of Western blots (Fig. 4B). The mutants C135A and C142A (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4) were always expressed poorly. All mutants, except C418A,C419A,C420A (Fig. 4, lane 11), were labeled with palmitate almost as well as the wt Nsp1 (70-100% of wt level). No labeling of C418A,C419A,C420A could be observed even in 15-fold longer exposures of the gel (data not shown). C418A,C419A,C420A retained 40% of the enzymatic activities of wt Nsp1 when expressed in E. coli (data not shown). Thus, the mutation appeared not to destroy the protein conformation. We conclude that palmitate addition occurred at least on one of the cysteine residues 418-420. To determine to which cysteine palmitate was added, we prepared two more point mutants, C418A,C419A and C420A. Both of these mutant proteins were enzymatically active and could be labeled with [3H]palmitic acid (Fig. 4, lanes 12 and 13), suggesting either that any of the cysteines 418-420 may be palmitoylated or that palmitate is added to several of these cysteines in wild type Nsp1. To assess the role of palmitoylation in the membrane association of Nsp1, the nonpalmitoylated form of Nsp1 (C418A,C419A,C420A) was expressed in HeLa cells, and the post-nuclear supernatant was subjected to flotation analysis in a discontinuous sucrose gradient. About 35-40% of C418A,C419A,C420A and 95-100% of wt Nsp1 floated with membranes (Fig. 5, A and B). To characterize the nature of membrane association, the floated membrane fraction was subjected to various treatments followed by sedimentation of the membranes. The supernatant and pellet fractions were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Nsp1 antiserum, followed by SDS-PAGE and quantitation of the radioactivity of the Nsp1 bands. About 75% of wt Nsp1 was still membrane-associated after treatment with 50 mM NaCO3, pH 11.5. Only when the pH was raised to 12, most of the wt Nsp1 was released from the membranes (Fig. 5C). About two-thirds of the C418A,C419A,C420A protein could be released from the membrane fraction already by treatment with 1 M NaCl (Fig. 5D). The floated membranes were also subjected to Triton X-114 phase separation. Wild type Nsp1 was heavily aggregated (Fig. 6, lane 1), and at least 50% of the nonaggregating Nsp1 partitioned into the detergent phase (Fig. 6, lane 2). In contrast, only a minor fraction of C418A,C419A,C420A protein was detected in rapidly sedimenting aggregates (Fig. 6, lane 4), and the major part partitioned into the aqueous phase (Fig. 6, lane 6). These results show that palmitoylation of wt Nsp1 is responsible for its tight membrane association. To investigate the effect of the loss of palmitate on the subcellular distribution of Nsp1, we used indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Recombinant vaccinia virus-infected HeLa cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding wt Nsp1 or C418A, C419A,C420A. The cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde at 3 h post-transfection and stained with rhodamine-conjugated concanavalin A to visualize the plasma membrane. Thereafter, the cells were permeabilized to reveal Nsp1 by indirect immunofluorescence (fluorescein isothiocyanate label). In wt nsp1- transfected cells colocalization of Nsp1 with the plasma membrane marker was observed (Fig. 7, A and B). Again, the filopodia-like extensions were decorated with both stains. The filopodia of C418A,C419A,C420A-transfected cells were not visible by anti-Nsp1 staining (Fig. 7, C and D). The colocalization of the plasma membrane staining with C418A,C419A,C420A was confirmed using laser scanning confocal microscope to overlay the stains of C418A,C419A,C420A and concanavalin A. A clear colocalization was detected at the cell surface, but not in the filopodia (data not shown). Semliki Forest virus capping enzyme Nsp1 is a palmitoylated membrane protein, tightly associated with the cytoplasmic surface of plasma membrane, endosomes, and lysosomes (8Peränen J. Laakkonen P. Hyvönen M. Kääriäinen L. Virology. 1995; 208: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To define the regions responsible for palmitoylation and membrane association, a series of deletions in nsp1 gene was prepared, and the membrane association of these mutant proteins was studied. Our results suggest that the N-terminal part of Nsp1 is evidently needed for membrane association, because all proteins with N-terminal deletions were cytoplasmic, whereas the N-terminal fragment (Δ270-537) and proteins with C-terminal deletions retained some membrane affinity even in the absence of palmitoylation. However, the results of this analysis have to be taken with caution for the following reasons. All truncated proteins, expect the one with a minor deletion at the C terminus of Nsp1 (Δ461-488), lost their enzymatic activities and were unable to incorporate radioactively labeled palmitate, suggesting that the deletions may have affected the proper folding of Nsp1. These results also give the impression that Nsp1 cannot be divided into separable functional domains. Similar results were recently obtained when the methyltransferase activity of truncated derivatives of Sindbis virus (a related alphavirus) Nsp1 protein was assayed (23Wang H.-L. O'Rear J. Stollar V. Virology. 1996; 217: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Our present results show that palmitate is attached to Nsp1 via a thioester linkage to a cysteine residue, which is the most common way to link palmitate to proteins (24Bizzozero O.A. Tetzloff S.U. Bharadwaj M. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To determine the palmitoylation site, we mutated the cysteine residues conserved in the Nsp1 of the alphavirus family to alanines. The incorporation of radioactively labeled palmitate into the mutated proteins was studied. On the basis of these results we conclude that palmitoyl group was attached to cysteine residues 418-420. To define which of the cysteines were palmitoylated, two more mutants, C418A,C419A and C420A, were generated. Both of these mutant proteins were palmitoylated, suggesting that at least two of the three cysteine residues are accessible to the palmitoyl transferase in the wt Nsp1. At least one cysteine residue is found at that position in all alphaviruses from which sequence data are available. No amino acid sequence motifs have been identified for the prediction of protein palmitoylation, except N-terminal Met-Gly-Cys, found in myristoylated and palmitoylated members of the heterotrimeric G-protein subfamily (12Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In the case of Nsp1, the palmitate is attached to cysteines in the central region of the protein with no obvious sequence homology to the palmitoylation sites of other proteins. Protein palmitoylation seems to have several different functions. It has been shown to be responsible for membrane association of several cytoplasmic proteins: the α-subunits of G-proteins (16Wedegaertner P.B. Chu D.H. Wilson P.T. Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25001-25008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Ras proteins (13Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Because many integral membrane proteins, for example transferrin receptor and the envelope proteins of alpha- and rhabdoviruses (1Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Jing S. Trowbridge I.S. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 27Rose J.K. Adams G.A. Gallione C.J. Proc. Natl.

To date experimental evidence exists to suggest that palmitoylation mediates protein-protein interactions (28O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7564-7569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Shi Y. Veit B. Bækkeskov S. J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 20998-21006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Cadwallader K.A. Paterson H. MacDonald S.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3507-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The subcellular site for palmitoylation of Nsp1 is not known, but because Nsp1 is rapidly associated with membranes (8Peränen J. Laakkonen P. Hyvönen M. Kääriäinen L. Virology. 1995; 208: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and targeted to the plasma membrane also in the absence of palmitate, it seems reasonable to assume that palmitoylation of Nsp1 occurs at the plasma membrane. Recently, a membrane-associated palmitoyltransferase was identified at the plasma membrane, which is able to add palmitate to G-protein α-subunits in vitro (35Dunphy J.T. Greentree W.K. Manahan C.L. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7154-7159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Because the absence of palmitate did not abolish the enzymatic activities of Nsp1, we assume that the conformation of the nonpalmitoylated protein was not changed significantly. Our results show that the absence of palmitate reduced the tightness of membrane association and converted Nsp1 from an integral to a peripheral membrane protein. Similar results have been reported for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), in which palmitoylation was not required for membrane association per se (30Sudo Y. Valenzuela D. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Fishman M.C. Strittmatter S.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2095-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and for p21ras, whose affinity to membranes was increased by palmitoylation (13Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). Many palmitoylated proteins are associated with the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane (36McIlhinney R.A.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 387-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation has been shown to be needed for plasma membrane targeting of H-Ras (33Jung V. Chen L. Hofmann S.L. Wigler M. Powers S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1333-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 34Robbins S.M. Quintrell N.A. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3507-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and p64 (17James G. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20998-21006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The targeting mechanism of Nsp1 seems to be different, because it is transported to the plasma membrane also in the absence of palmitate. A likely model would be that after binding to some receptor molecule at the plasma membrane, subsequent palmitoylation anchors Nsp1 tightly to the membrane. Only after acylation the protein could be transported to the filopodial extensions of the cell. The significance of the difference in plasma membrane distribution of the palmitoylated and nonpalmitoylated Nsp1 is currently unknown. In conclusion, we have located the palmitoylation site of SFV Nsp1 to the C-terminal part of the protein (Cys418-420). Our results show that nonpalmitoylated Nsp1 was membrane-associated, behaving like a peripheral membrane protein, and that it was targeted to the plasma membrane. Palmitoylation anchored Nsp1 tightly to membranes, and only the palmitoylated form of Nsp1 was detected in filopodial extensions. The results are in agreement with recent studies, which suggest additional roles for palmitoylation besides sole membrane association of proteins. We thank Tarja Välimäki for technical assistance.

https://openalex.org/W2096890729,"The 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) mediates several cellular responses to metabolic stress. Rat liver contains at least two isoforms of this enzyme, either α1 or α2 catalytic subunits together with β and γ noncatalytic subunits in a trimeric complex. The α1 isoform is purified using a peptide substrate affinity chromatography column with ADR1 (222-234)P229 (LKKLTRRPSFSAQ), corresponding to the cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site in the yeast transcriptional activator of the ADH2 gene, ADR1. This peptide is phosphorylated at Ser230 by AMPK α1 with a Km of 3.8 μM and a Vmax of 4.8 μmol/min/mg compared to the commonly used rat acetyl-CoA carboxylase (73-87)A77R86-87 peptide substrate, HMRSAMSGLHLVKRR, with a Km of 33.3 μM and a Vmax of 8.1 μmol/min/mg. Thus, the AMPK exhibits some overlapping specificity with the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The rat liver AMPK α1 isoform has a Kcat∼250-fold higher than the AMPK α2 isoform isolated from rat liver. The AMPK α1 isoform readily phosphorylates peptides corresponding to the reported AMPK phosphorylation sites in rat, chicken, and yeast acetyl-CoA carboxylase and rat hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase but not phosphorylase kinase. Based on previous peptide substrate specificity studies (Dale, S., Wilson, W. A., Edelman, A. M., and Hardie, G. (1995) FEBS Lett. 361, 191-195) using partially purified enzyme and variants of the peptide AMARAASAAALARRR, it was proposed that the AMPK preferred the phosphorylation site motif Φ(X, β)XXS/TXXXΦ (Φ, hydrophobic; β, basic). In good AMPK α1 peptide substrates, a hydrophobic residue at the P−5 position is conserved but not at the P+4 position. Oxidation of the Met residues in the rat acetyl-CoA carboxylase (73-87)A77R86-87 peptide increased the Km 6-fold and reduced the Vmax to 4% of the reduced peptide.

T3 reverses these ligand-independent activities and causes up-regulation on positive TREs and down-regulation on negative TREs. Recently, two separate proteins, termed nuclear co-repressors (TRAC), have been identified which interact with the TR in the absence of ligand to mediate ligand-independent repression on positive TREs (19Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 72-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K.

These proteins possess a carboxyl-terminal domain which mediates their interaction with the TR and amino-terminal domains, which presumably interact with the initiation complex to mediate ligand-independent repression. Their role in ligand-independent activation on negative TREs is unknown.Further complexity in thyroid hormone signaling is mediated by the presence of 3 separate TR isoforms (α1, β1, and β2) which activate or repress transcription in the presence of ligand (22Lazar M.A. Endocr.

The TRβ isoforms are alternatively spliced variants which differ only in their amino terminus, while TRα1 is the product of a separate gene but shares strong homology in its DNA and ligand binding domains but differs also in its amino terminus. Recent data from a number of different groups suggest that isoform-specific differences in both ligand-independent and -dependent activities exist on both positive and negative TREs and that these differences involve the separate amino termini which allow the TRs to either bind TREs differently, interact with members of the initiation complex with different affinities, or possess separate activation domains as is the case with the TRβ2 amino terminus (23Hadzic E.

These isoforms are also differentially expressed such that TRβ2 is primarily expressed in the hypothalamus and pituitary, suggesting that its primary role may be in mediating negative regulation by T3.To explore the role of nuclear co-repressors in both negative regulation and isoform specificity, we isolated, using the yeast two-hybrid system (26Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar, 27Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 72-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Horlein et al. (20Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that this portion of NCoR functions as a powerful dominant inhibitor of endogenous cellular co-repressor activity on TREs and substantially increases ligand-dependent negative regulation by the TRβ1 and α1 isoforms. However, this function was isoform-specific in that the ligand-independent and -dependent activity of the β2 isoform was unaffected by the presence of this inhibitor. Gel-mobility shift assays demonstrate that the β2 amino terminus does not impair the ability of TRβ2 to interact physically with NCoR, but a functional interaction is prevented, perhaps by coactivators which interact with the β2 amino terminus (25Sjoberg M. Vennstrom B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4718-4726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONUsing the yeast two-hybrid system, as described above, we isolated a 3.1-kilobase cDNA clone from a human placental library which showed strong nucleic acid and amino acid homology to the carboxyl-terminal region of murine NCoR (20Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Functional analysis of this clone in yeast demonstrated that 1μM T3 could prevent it from interacting with the carboxyl terminus of TRβ. As this original clone contained the interacting domain of NCoR and surrounding amino acids (AA 1539-2453), but lacked the two repressor domains present between AA 1-1120 of murine NCoR, we hypothesized that it would function as a dominant inhibitor of endogenous TRAC activity and thus termed it, NCoRI. The function of this inhibitor in eukaryotic cell lines was then tested on both positive and negative TREs.As demonstrated in Fig. 2A, TRβ1 represses basal transcription on a positive TRE reporter containing two copies of a DR+4 upstream of TK109 in the absence of ligand. Co-transfection of NCoRI, as expected, competes for endogenous co-repressor activity and causes ligand-independent repression to be lost and in the case of the DR+4 reporter leads to partial activation. Ligand-dependent activation was also blocked on the DR+4 reporter (expressed as fold T3 activation) in the presence of NCoRI, primarily because of the loss of ligand-independent repression, suggesting that relief of repression is an important mechanism of thyroid hormone action (data not shown). To rule out an independent activating function of NCoRI, we cloned AA 1539-2453 in-frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and showed that it not alter expression of a UAS-TK Luc reporter construct (data not shown). NCoRI itself also had little effect on basal activity in CV-1 cells or on a cytomegalovirus promoter when co-transfected in isolation.Fig. 2A dominant inhibitor of the nuclear co-repressor family effects ligand-independent activity of the TR in an isoform-specific fashion on positive and negative thyroid hormone response elements. CV-1 cells were co-transfected with 1.67 μg of reporter and 83 ng of pKCR2-TR and/or 83 ng of pKCR2 and/or 83 ng of pKCR2-NCoRI alone to determine ligand-independent activity and -dependent activity. TRΔββ lacks the A/B domain (24Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14274-14280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) while TRE220R and TRAHT contain amino acid changes in the hinge region (20Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar) of TRβ1. A, ligand-independent activity was determined on the DR+4-luciferase reporter using a number of TR isoforms and mutants. The data are quantified as fold repression on the DR+4 reporter (mean ± S.E.) In this case, 1 represents basal activity either in the presence of pKCR2 alone (stippled bars) or pKCR2-NCoRI (black bars). B, ligand-independent activity was determined, as above, on the TRH luciferase promoter. The data are quantified as fold activation on the TRH reporter (mean ± S.E.). In this case, 1 represents basal activity either in the presence of pKCR2 alone (stippled bars) or pKCR2-NCoRI (black bars). C, the TRH-luciferase reporter was transfected in a similar paradigm as above with the three TR isoforms. 24 h after transfection, 10 nM T3 was added. The data are presented as fold basal activity (mean ± S.E.) where 1 (indicated by the arrow) is the basal reporter activity either in the presence of pKCR2 alone (stippled bars) or pKCR2-NCoRI (black bars). The numbering within the graph represents fold repression in the presence of ligand.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As we have demonstrated previously, TRα1 is a more potent ligand-independent repressor than TRβ1 on positive TREs. Yet, as shown in Fig. 2A, co-transfection of NCoRI again competes completely for endogenous co-repressor activity on the DR+4 element in the presence of TRα1. While TRβ2 is relatively weaker than the other two isoforms in ligand-independent activity on positive TREs, its activity is not appreciably changed by NCoRI. In contrast, TRΔββ, which lacks the amino terminus of the TRβ isoforms and is comparable to TRβ2 in ligand-independent activity, becomes a significant activator in the presence of co-transfected NCoRI (3-fold activation). These data indicate that TRΔββ interacts functionally with NCoRI and that the introduction of the TRβ2 amino terminus reverses this functional interaction. In addition, the TRβ1 and TRα1 amino termini permit a functional interaction with NCoRI. Mutagenesis of the hinge region (TRβAHT) also impairs functional interactions with NCoRI based upon its inability to bind NCoR, while TRβE220R fully interacts with NCoRI and is known to bind the wild-type NCoR (20Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar). Similar results with each wild-type and mutant TR isoform were obtained on either an inverted (F2Lys) (36Hsu J.H. Zavacki A.M. Harney J.W. Brent G.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or palindromic TRE (data not shown) demonstrating that the TRβ2 amino terminus blocked functional interactions with NCoRI.To further address the functional role of the co-repressor family on thyroid hormone action, we investigated the effect of co-transfected NCoRI on the negative TREs present in the human TRH promoter. In contrast to its ligand-independent repressive activity on positive TREs, the TR causes ligand-independent activation on negative TREs. As shown in Fig. 2B, basal ligand-independent activation by both TRβ1 and TRα1 is increased dramatically by NCoRI (from 2-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively, to 9-fold). In contrast, the 3-fold ligand-independent activation by TRβ2 is not affected by co-transfected NCoRI, consistent with its isoform-specific effect seen on the positive TREs. Similarly, TRΔββ, which is a poor ligand-independent activator, becomes a potent activator (from 1.2-fold to 10-fold) in the presence of NCoRI, demonstrating that the TRβ2 amino terminus again either impairs NCoR-TR interactions or modulates the function of the repressing domains of the co-repressor family.From these data it also appears that ligand-independent activation is important for negative regulation as increased ligand-independent effects due to co-transfected NCoRI lead to a doubling of fold repression by TRs which interact functionally with NCoRI (see upper and middle panels, Fig. 2C); however, fold repression is only marginally affected by NCoRI in context of TRβ2. Furthermore, as NCoRI can increase both ligand-independent activation and ligand-dependent repression of the TRH reporter construct by the TRα1 and TRβ1 isoforms, the converse indicates that increased levels of endogenous nuclear co-repressor activity could block ligand-independent and -dependent regulation of negative TREs by these isoforms leaving TRβ2 as the only TR isoform capable of mediating negative regulation. This would be consistent with TRβ2 being expressed primarily in the thyrotroph and hypothalamus, tissues where negative regulation by T3 is paramount (37Hodin R.A. Lazar M.A. Wintman B.I. Darling D.S. Koenig R.J. Larsen P.R. Moore D.D. Chin W.W. Science. 1989; 244: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar).As our functional data suggest that isoform-specific interactions occur with the nuclear co-repressor family, we next asked whether the different TR isoforms could interact with NCoRI when bound to DNA. In vitro translation of the NCoRI cDNA generates a primary transcript of approximately 130 kDa consistent with its predicted size (data not shown). Incubation of in vitro translated NCoRI with in vitro translated TRβ1 in the presence of a DR+4 probe generates a slower migrating band (as compared to TR homodimer, lane 4, Fig. 3) and a diminution in the TR homodimer, consistent with a TRβ1-NCoRI interaction. This interaction can be disrupted in the presence of 100 nM T3 (lane 5, Fig. 3). Control lanes demonstrate that NCoRI does not bind the element in the absence of TR (not shown). Furthermore, TRβ2 (Fig. 4A) as well as TRα1 (not shown) also interact with NCoRI as does TRβE220R (Fig. 4B). As expected, TRβAHT does not bind NCoRI well (Fig. 4C). These data indicate that although functional interactions between TRβ2 and NCoRI do not appear to occur, the two proteins can still physically interact on the response element consistent with the ligand-binding domain of the TR being the primary region responsible for physical interaction (20Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar, 21Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). Functionally, however, the TRβ2 amino terminus either through the recruitment of other proteins or through changes in the conformation of the TR prevents the repressing function of the nuclear co-repressor from occurring.Fig. 3The nuclear co-repressor inhibitor binds to TRβ1 in a ligand-independent fashion in the presence of a TRE. Gel-mobility shift assays were carried out using 3-4 μl of in vitro translated proteins from rabbit reticulocyte lysate and a 32P-radiolabeled DR+4 oligonucleotide probe. The concentration of T3 used was 100 nM. The labeled DR+4 probe was incubated with in vitro translated TRβ1, RXRα, and NCoRI or unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate (UP).

A, TRβ2; B, TRE220R; C, TRAHT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Analysis of the interactions between NCoRI and the TR in the gel-mobility shift assay demonstrate that NCoRI appears to principally interact with the TR homodimer or with TR monomer as the TR-RXR complex (lane 6, Fig. 3) is not altered in either intensity or position by NCoRI. Furthermore, the intensity of the TR-NCoRI band is diminished consistent with RXR competing with NCoRI for binding to the TR. To test this possibility, we performed a time course competition between TR-NCoRI and RXR. As Fig. 5 demonstrates, the addition of RXR competes effectively for the TR binding to NCoRI and diminishes the TR-NCoRI complex at every time point. These data imply that the TR-RXR heterodimer does not interact well with NCoRI in the presence of DNA in this assay, and that the interaction between TR homodimer or monomer and NCoR may be important for co-repressor activity.Fig. 5The nuclear co-repressor inhibitor (NCoRI) preferentially binds the TR homodimer. The DR+4 probe was incubated with TRβ1 and NCoRI. At the indicated time points during the 20-min incubation, an equal amount of RXRα was added. The resulting complexes were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing gel acrylamide gel followed by autoradiography. D, homodimer; HD, heterodimer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In summary, we have demonstrated that endogenous nuclear co-repressor activity can be competed for with a dominant negative form of NCoR. This inhibitor, which lacks the two repressing domains, blocked ligand-independent repression by the TR on positive TREs and enhanced ligand-independent activity on negative TREs. However, co-repressor activity appears to be isoform-specific as the ligand-independent function of TRβ2 is not affected by NCoRI. This is most notably demonstrated on negative TREs where ligand-independent activation and repression by TRβ2 is not appreciably changed by NCoRI even though its physical interaction with NCoRI is maintained. Thus, the A/B domain of the TRβ2 can inactivate nuclear co-repressor function through either structural alteration or the recruitment of novel factors which modulate the function of the co-repressor.This study supports the notion that endogenous anti-repressors may exist which could further modulate thyroid hormone and retinoic acid action in a tissue-specific fashion. Recently, an endogenous truncated isoform of the co-repressor SMRT was identified (38Sande S. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This protein appears to function as an antagonist to wild type SMRT. Further studies will be directed at identifying other isoforms of the human NCoR family.

T3 reverses these ligand-independent activities and causes up-regulation on positive TREs and down-regulation on negative TREs. Recently, two separate proteins, termed nuclear co-repressors (TRAC), have been identified which interact with the TR in the absence of ligand to mediate ligand-independent repression on positive TREs (19Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 72-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K.

These proteins possess a carboxyl-terminal domain which mediates their interaction with the TR and amino-terminal domains, which presumably interact with the initiation complex to mediate ligand-independent repression. Their role in ligand-independent activation on negative TREs is unknown.Further complexity in thyroid hormone signaling is mediated by the presence of 3 separate TR isoforms (α1, β1, and β2) which activate or repress transcription in the presence of ligand (22Lazar M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). The TRβ isoforms are alternatively spliced variants which differ only in their amino terminus, while TRα1 is the product of a separate gene but shares strong homology in its DNA and ligand binding domains but differs also in its amino terminus. Recent data from a number of different groups suggest that isoform-specific differences in both ligand-independent and -dependent activities exist on both positive and negative TREs and that these differences involve the separate amino termini which allow the TRs to either bind TREs differently, interact with members of the initiation complex with different affinities, or possess separate activation domains as is the case with the TRβ2 amino terminus (23Hadzic E.

https://openalex.org/W1968807526,"We have cloned and expressed two cDNAs encoding the human lysosomal α-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.24) by RT-PCR of human spleen mRNA. This enzyme is required for the degradation of N-linked carbohydrates during glycoprotein catabolism in eucaryotic cells. The shorter of the two cDNAs (3 kilobases (kb)) was found to encode an open reading frame of 2964 base pairs and, when expressed in Pichia pastoris, was found to encode an enzyme that could cleave high mannose oligosaccharides, oligosaccharides isolated from α-mannosidosis fibroblasts, and p-nitrophenyl-α-D-mannopyranoside substrates. In addition, the Pichia-expressed enzyme was inhibited by swainsonine, and had a pH optimum, Km, and Vmax characteristic of the enzyme purified previously from human liver. The second, larger RT-PCR product (3.6 kb) was found to contain an insertion and a deletion relative to the 3-kb spleen amplimer and encoded a truncated coding region, indicating that it resulted from alternate transcript splicing. No α-mannosidase activity could be detected in Pichia transformants containing this coding region, indicating that it did not encode a functional enzyme. Antiserum raised to the recombinant product of the 3-kb α-mannosidase cDNA immunoprecipitated lysosomal α-mannosidase activity from human fibroblast extracts. Northern blots identified a 3-kb RNA transcript in all human tissues tested, including α-mannosidosis fibroblasts, while minor transcripts of 3.6 kb were also present in several adult tissues. Human chromosome mapping of the mannosidase gene confirmed that the functional gene maps to the MANB locus on chromosome 19. Sequence comparisons were made to previously published human cDNA sequences encoding a putative lysosomal α-mannosidase (Nebes, V. L., and Schmidt, M. C. (1994) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 200, 239-245) and several differences were found relative to the functional lysosomal α-mannosidase encoded by the 3-kb spleen cDNA.

Sequence comparisons were made to previously published human cDNA sequences encoding a putative lysosomal α-mannosidase (Nebes, V. L., and Schmidt, M. C. (1994) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 200, 239-245) and several differences were found relative to the functional lysosomal α-mannosidase encoded by the 3-kb spleen cDNA. The lysosomal catabolism of N-glycans on mammalian glycoproteins occurs through the sequential exoglycosidase digestion of oligosaccharides from the non-reducing terminus down to the carbohydrate-peptide core region (1Aronson Jr., N.N. Kuranda M.J. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2615-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Included among the hydrolytic activities responsible for this oligosaccharide degradation is a broad specificity exo-α-mannosidase activity (EC 3.2.1.24) that catalyzes the hydrolysis of α1,2-, α1,3-, and α1,6-mannoside linkages present in complex, hybrid, and high mannose Asn-linked glycans (2al Daher S. de Gasperi R. Daniel P. Hall N. Warren C.D. Winchester B. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This enzyme is distinguished from other α-mannosidase activities by a combination of a low pH optimum (pH 4.5), a broad natural substrate specificity, activity toward the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenyl-α-mannoside, and sensitivity to inhibition by swainsonine (3Daniel P.F. Winchester B. Warren C.D. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 551-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 4Moremen K.W. Trimble R.B. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). An enzyme activity with these characteristics has been identified and purified from several species sources including Dictyostelium discoideum (5Schatzle J. Bush J. Cardelli J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4000-4007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a variety of mammalian tissues (6Opheim D.J. Touster O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 16556-16563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolic radiolabeling studies have indicated that the human enzyme is initially synthesized as a polypeptide of ∼110 kDa that is subsequently processed into two subunits of 40-46 and 63-67 kDa (12Pohlmann R. Hasilik A. Cheng S. Pemble S. Winchester B. von Figura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 115: 1083-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Proteolytic processing of the precursor appears to be variable in different mammalian species, with reported subunit sizes for the enzyme ranging from 20 to 70 kDa. Even within a single tissue, isozymes of the acidic α-mannosidase, designated A and B, have been isolated by ion exchange chromatography differing only in the degree of proteolytic processing from the common precursor (7Cheng S.H. Malcolm S. Pemble S. Winchester B. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The processing of the lysosomal α-mannosidase from Dictyostelium has been characterized by metabolic radiolabeling (13Mierendorf Jr., R.C. Cardelli J.A. Livi G.P. Dimond R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5878-5884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), NH2-terminal sequencing of the processed subunits, and comparison to the sequence of the α-mannosidase gene (5Schatzle J. Bush J. Cardelli J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4000-4007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies concluded that the Dictyostelium enzyme precursor is processed by the removal of an NH2-terminal signal sequence and two propeptides, one at the NH2 terminus and one in the center of the precursor, resulting in the mature 60- and 58-kDa subunits. A human genetic disease characterized by a deficiency in the lysosomal α-mannosidase, α-mannosidosis, results in varied neural, skeletal, and immune defects, proliferation of lysosomes in most cell types resulting from accumulation of undegraded oligosaccharides, and an elevation of serum and urinary oligosaccharide levels that are characteristics of lysosomal storage diseases (3Daniel P.F. Winchester B. Warren C.D. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 551-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 14Bennet J.K. Dembure P.P. Elsas L.J. Am. J. Med.

The enzymatic deficiency in the lysosomal α-mannosidase in these patients has been long recognized (16Tsay G.C. Dawson G. Matalon R. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 56: 711-718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Taylor H.A. Thomas G.H. Aylsworth A. Stevenson R.E. Reynolds L.W. Clin. Chim.

Res. 1976; 10: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), but the molecular basis for the defect has been hampered by the lack of information on the human MANB gene. The gene encoding lysosomal α-mannosidase has been isolated from D. discoideum (5Schatzle J. Bush J. Cardelli J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4000-4007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and sequence comparisons (4Moremen K.W. Trimble R.B. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) with other mammalian α-mannosidases identified regions similar to the previously cloned Golgi processing enzyme, α-mannosidase II (21Moremen K.W. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and the endoplasmic reticulum/cytosolic α-mannosidase (22Bischoff J. Moremen K. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17110-17117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No sequence similarities were detected with the α1,2-mannosidases involved in early steps of glycoprotein biosynthesis (23Herscovics A. Schneikert J. Athanassiadis A. Moremen K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9864-9871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lal A. Schutzbach J.S. Forsee W.T. Neame P.J. Moremen K.W. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1993; 217: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, a classification of the α-mannosidase sequences was proposed whereby the early processing α1,2-mannosidases were categorized as Class I α-mannosidases, and the Class II α-mannosidases were subdivided into Golgi processing enzymes (i.e. α-mannosidase II), lysosomal catabolic enzymes (i.e. lysosomal α-mannosidase), and the cytosolic/endoplasmic reticulum α-mannosidase (4Moremen K.W. Trimble R.B. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Regions of sequence similarity between the different subgroups of the Class II α-mannosidases allowed the design of degenerate oligonucleotide primers for the isolation of partial murine (27Merkle R.K. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 734Google Scholar) and full-length human (28Nebes V.L. Schmidt M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The human lysosomal α-mannosidase cDNA sequence was derived from overlapping partial clones isolated from human retina and muscle cDNA libraries (28Nebes V.L. Schmidt M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and predicts an open reading frame of 2883 base pairs that is 38% identical to the Dictyostelium lysosomal α-mannosidase sequence. Direct evidence that the human cDNA expresses functional enzyme activity with the characteristics of the purified lysosomal enzyme has not been reported, but recently, partial peptide sequence data from the purified human enzyme was found to match the retina/muscle cDNA sequence (29Emiliani C.

To demonstrate that the published cDNA sequence encodes a functional α-mannosidase enzyme activity and to initiate studies on the molecular basis of the enzyme defect in the lysosomal storage disease, α-mannosidosis, we have isolated cDNA sequences from human spleen and fibroblast cDNA sources by RT-PCR. Heterologous expression of the cDNA in Pichia pastoris and characterization of the expressed enzyme purified from the Pichia culture medium confirmed the authenticity of the cDNA clones as encoding the human lysosomal α-mannosidase. In addition, transcripts encoding the enzyme were detected at variable levels in all human tissues tested, including α-mannosidosis fibroblasts. Significant sequence differences were detected when these spleen cDNAs were compared with the published composite clone from the human retina and muscle cDNA libraries (28Nebes V.L. Schmidt M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These differences include numerous deletions, substitutions, and insertions relative to the published human cDNA sequence. Chromosome mapping confirmed the assignment of the lysosomal α-mannosidase gene to the MANB locus human chromosome 19 (28Nebes V.L. Schmidt M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 30Champion M.J. Shows T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

No pseudogenes were detected, and no amplimer products consistent with the retina/muscle cDNA sequence (28Nebes V.L. Schmidt M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) could be identified. Since the 3-kb spleen cDNA sequence encodes a functional lysosomal α-mannosidase activity, it will provide a basis for further studies on the molecular basis of the defect in hereditary human α-mannosidosis. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs, Boehringer Mannheim, or Promega Inc. Taq polymerase was from Perkin-Elmer. Pfu polymerase was from Stratagene Inc. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) TA cloning kit, FastTrack RNA isolation kit, and the Pichia expression kit were from Invitrogen. Human multiple tissue Northern blots and spleen mRNA were from Clontech Laboratories. Swainsonine was a product of Boehringer Mannheim. [32P]dCTP and the Megaprime labeling system were from Amersham. Superscript preamplification system and tissue culture medium were from Life Technologies, Inc. A normal human fibroblast cell line (B.O.) and three α-mannosidosis fibroblast lines (E.H., D.B., and M.S.) were generously provided by Dr. Peter Daniel (Shriver Center for Mental Retardation, Waltham, MA). BCA protein assay reagent was from Pierce. Pichia culture medium was from Difco. Endoglycosidase Hf (endo H) was from New England Biolabs. All other reagents were at least reagent grade and were obtained from standard suppliers. cDNA synthesis was performed using the Superscript preamplification kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) essentially as described by the manufacturer using 2.5 μg of poly(A+) RNA from the indicated tissue source at 42°C for 1.5 h. After the reaction was completed, the mixture was heated to 90°C for 5 min, followed by the addition of 2 units of RNase H and an additional incubation at 37°C for 20 min. The reaction mixture was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, 25:24:1 (v/v/v), and desalted over a Sephadex G-50 column (Nick column, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in 100 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). This desalted preparation was used directly in the PCR amplification. The amplification of the human lysosomal α-mannosidase was performed in a 25-μl reaction volume containing 3 μl of desalted cDNA, 1.0 mM MgCl2, 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5-10), 7.5 mM (NH4)2SO4, 200 μM each dNTP, 0.5 μM 5′ and 3′ primer, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase, and 1.25 units of Pfu polymerase. The 5′ and 3′ primer sequences were, respectively, 5′-CCCAAGCTTGGGGGCTTCGGGGTCTGCGCTCGCGGCTG-3′ and 5′-CCCTCTAGAGTCTCGGTCTGCCCCCGGAGCAGGAGGCTT-3′. The samples were placed in an DNA thermal cycler 480 (Perkin-Elmer) programmed for a temperature-step cycle of 94°C (45 s), 65°C (45 s), and 72°C (4 min) for 5 cycles. An additional 25 cycles were then performed with an annealing temperature of 55°C (45 s) in place of the 65°C step above. After the final cycle, the reaction was maintained at 72°C for 7 min. The final reaction products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml). Amplification products were purified from the gel using the Sephaglas DNA purification kit (Pharmacia) and subcloned into the pCR II vector (Invitrogen). Recombinant plasmids were isolated from liquid bacterial cultures using Qiagen columns (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) and subjected to DNA sequencing. Lysosomal α-mannosidase cDNA amplimers subcloned into the vector, pCR II, were sequenced by using Taq polymerase in the dideoxy dye-terminator reaction (34Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52503) Google Scholar) using synthetic primers and analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer (Molecular Genetics Instrumentation Facility, University of Georgia) following the standard protocol as described by the manufacturer. DNA sequence data were assembled into a contiguous sequence data base by the method of Staden (35Staden R. Bishop M.J. Rawlings C.J. Nucleic Acid and Protein Sequence Analysis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press Ltd., Oxford1987: 173-217Google Scholar). Statistical analysis of sequence similarity between protein or DNA sequences was determined using the Bestfit and Pileup programs of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (GCG software, version 8.0). Both the 3.0- and 3.6-kb human spleen cDNA fragments that were isolated by RT-PCR and subcloned into the pCR II vector were excised from pCR II by digestion with EcoRI and ligated into the EcoRI site in the Pichia expression vector, pHIL-D2 (Invitrogen). Both expression constructs were transformed into the his4 Pichia host strain, GS115, using transformation procedures and media compositions described in the Pichia expression manual (Invitrogen) and as described previously (36Cregg J.M. Barringer K.J. Hessler A.Y. Madden K.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3376-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 37Tschopp J.F. Brust P.F. Cregg J.M. Stillman C.A. Gingeras T.R.

Ten micrograms of SalI-linearized recombinant vector was used for each transformation. Negative controls using the pHIL-D2 plasmid without an insert or a transformation with no added DNA were included. Positive transformants had presumably undergone a homologous recombination between the his4 locus of the host cells and the HIS4 gene on the pHIL-D2 vector allowing positive auxotrophic selection in His-deficient medium (36Cregg J.M. Barringer K.J. Hessler A.Y. Madden K.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3376-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Ten colonies were picked from each of the transformations for methanol induction (36Cregg J.M. Barringer K.J. Hessler A.Y. Madden K.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3376-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) of the heterologous protein expression. At the end of methanol induction, the clarified culture medium from each of the transformants was collected by centrifugation at 2800 × g for 10 min and assayed for α-mannosidase enzyme activity. The human lysosomal α-mannosidase was assayed using p-nitrophenyl-α-D-mannopyranoside (pNP-Man) as substrate as described previously (6Opheim D.J. Touster O. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1017-1023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme assays of crude culture medium or of purified enzyme preparations were performed in a 50-μl total reaction volume containing 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.5), 4 mM pNP-Man, and 25 μl of enzyme solution at 37°C for 2 h or as specified. The enzyme assays were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of a buffer containing 133 mM glycine, 67 mM NaCl, 83 mM sodium carbonate (pH 10.4) and the absorbance was determined at 405 nm on a microtiter plate reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT). For determination of the pH optimum, the sodium acetate buffer was varied from pH 3.5 to 7. One unit of lysosomal α-mannosidase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that releases 1 μmol of p-nitrophenol in 1 min at 37°C. When used as an inhibitor of the lysosomal α-mannosidase, swainsonine was dissolved in H2O to a concentration of 1.44 mM and added into the reaction mixture at the final concentrations indicated in Fig. 5C. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer using bovine serum albumin as standard. The Pichia transformant, LM9, expressing the highest levels of α-mannosidase activity in the small scale cultures was prepared for induction in a 1-liter shake-flask culture. The culture was initiated by inoculating LM9 into 10 ml of BMGY medium (36Cregg J.M. Barringer K.J. Hessler A.Y. Madden K.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3376-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) and incubating at 30°C for 2 days with vigorous agitation. This culture was used to inoculate a 1-liter shake flask culture in BMGY medium for 2 days at 30°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2800 × g for 30 min and resuspended in 200 ml of BMMY induction medium, followed by incubation at 30°C for 5 days with vigorous shaking (36Cregg J.M. Barringer K.J. Hessler A.Y. Madden K.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3376-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). After 2 days of culture in the BMMY medium, 50% methanol (v/v in H2O) was added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 0.5%, and the culture was supplemented daily with methanol to maintain a concentration of 0.5%. After 5 days of induction in BMMY medium, the medium was harvested by centrifugation at 2800 × g for 30 min, and the clarified supernatant was concentrated to 30 ml by ultrafiltration through a YM-100 membrane (Amicon). The concentrated medium was dialyzed against 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.0) (phosphate buffer), clarified by centrifugation at 16000 × g for 30 min, and applied at a flow rate of 1 ml/min to a Q-Sepharose column (26 mm × 130 mm, Pharmacia) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 50 ml of phosphate buffer, and α-mannosidase activity was eluted with a 170-ml step gradient of 0-1 M NaCl in phosphate buffer (0-0.3 M, 30 ml; 0.3 M for 30 ml, 0.3-0.5 M, 20 ml; 0.5-1 M, 30 ml; 1 M for 60 ml) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (Fig. 3A). Eluted fractions containing the enzyme activity were pooled and concentrated on a YM-100 membrane with repeated concentration and dilution to equilibrate the enzyme preparation in phosphate buffer. The concentrated enzyme sample was adjusted to 1 M ammonium sulfate by the addition of an equal volume of a 2 M ammonium sulfate stock solution and applied at a flow rate of 1 ml/min to a phenyl-Sepharose column (26 mm × 100 mm, Pharmacia) that was pre-equilibrated with 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 M ammonium sulfate. The column was washed with 40 ml of column buffer and eluted with a linear gradient of 1 M ammonium sulfate, 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) to 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) (Fig. 3B). Peak fractions of α-mannosidase activity were concentrated on a YM-100 membrane with repeated concentration and dilution to equilibrate the enzyme preparation in phosphate buffer containing 150 mM NaCl. The equilibrated sample (1 ml) was loaded on a Superdex-200 gel filtration column (16 mm × 600 mm, Pharmacia) pre-equilibrated with the phosphate buffer, 150 mM sodium chloride, and the column was eluted in the same buffer (Fig. 3C). Fractions enriched in α-mannosidase enzyme activity were pooled. Aliquots of the pooled fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206615) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie R-250 to assess the purity of the protein preparation (Fig. 4A).Fig. 4SDS-PAGE of the human lysosomal α-mannosidase expressed and purified from P. pastoris: effect of treatment with endo H. Recombinant human lysosomal α-mannosidase was purified from the culture medium of a Pichia transformant, LM9, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” An aliquot of the purified enzyme was denatured with SDS and β-mercaptoethanol and either mock-treated (panels A and B, lane 1) or treated (panels A and B, lane 2) with endo H as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and either stained with Coomassie R-250 (panel A) or blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stained with Galanthus nivalis agglutinin, a mannose-specific lectin (panel B), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In panel A, 10 μg of purified enzyme was loaded to each lane. In panel B, 2 μg of enzyme was loaded. The Coomassie-stained band in panel A, lane 2, with a size of 70 kDa, is endo Hf. Molecular size markers (in kDa) are indicated on the left of the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Purified human lysosomal α-mannosidase was denatured in a solution of 0.5% SDS and 1%β-mercaptoethanol at 100°C for 10 min and subsequently incubated overnight in 50 mM sodium citrate (pH 5.5) with 3000 units of endo H at 37°C. Endoglycosidase digestion of undenatured lysosomal α-mannosidase was performed in 50 mM sodium citrate (pH 5.5) with 3000 units of endo H at 20°C overnight without heat denaturation in SDS/β-mercaptoethanol. Aliquots of the deglycosylated material were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels or assayed for enzyme activity. Proteins resolved on SDS-PAGE gels were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore) as described previously (40Moremen K.W. Touster O. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16876-16885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lectin detection of glycosylated protein bands on the blot was accomplished using the DIG glycan differentiation kit (Boehringer Mannheim) using a method adapted from the manufacturer's instruction. Following the electrophoretic transfer, the blot was incubated for at least 30 min in blocking solution (0.5% casein in 0.05 M Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl (pH 7.5) (TBS)) and washed twice for 10 min each in TBS and then once with Buffer 1 (1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM MnCl2, 1 mM CaCl2 in TBS) at room temperature. After blocking and washing, the blot was incubated with a digoxigenin-labeled Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) solution (1 μg/ml in Buffer 1) for 1 h at room temperature. Following three washes for 10 min each in TBS, the blot was incubated with a polyclonal sheep anti-digoxigenin Fab fragment conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. After a 1 h incubation at room temperature, the blot was washed three times in TBS. The alkaline phosphatase visualization solution was composed of 7.7 mg of nitro blue tetrazolium, 3.75 mg of X-phosphate in 20 ml of 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 50 mM MgCl2, 0.1 M NaCl. Following the staining reaction, the blot was rinsed in H2O and photographed. The purified human lysosomal (300 μg) was emulsified in an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant was used to immunize a male New Zealand White rabbit. At 3-week intervals additional booster immunizations were given with 300 μg of enzyme and Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Immunoprecipitation studies were performed using either the purified enzyme expressed in Pichia or enzyme activity from crude cell extracts from human fibroblast cultures. Fibroblast extracts were generated from a washed cell pellet (1.2 × 107 cells) by homogenization in a buffer containing 2% Triton X-100, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), followed by centrifugation at 145,000 × g for 30 min.

In Morquio type A syndrome GALNS deficiency causes the accumulation of KS in tissues and results in generalized skeletal dysplasia in affected patients. We show that in normal cells GALNS is in a 1.27-MDa complex with three other lysosomal hydrolases: β-galactosidase, α-neuraminidase, and cathepsin A (protective protein). GALNS copurifies with the complex by different chromatography techniques: affinity chromatography on both cathepsin A-binding and β-galactosidase-binding columns, gel filtration, and chromatofocusing. Anti-human cathepsin A rabbit antiserum coprecipitates GALNS together with cathepsin A, β-galactosidase, and α-neuraminidase in both a purified preparation of the 1.27-MDa complex and crude glycoprotein fraction from human placenta extract. Gel filtration analysis of fibroblast extracts of patients deficient in either β-galactosidase (β-galactosidosis) or cathepsin A (galactosialidosis), which accumulate KS, demonstrates that the 1.27-MDa complex is disrupted and that GALNS is present only in free homodimeric form. The GALNS activity and cross-reacting material are reduced in the fibroblasts of patients affected with galactosialidosis, indicating that the complex with cathepsin A may protect GALNS in the lysosome. We suggest that the 1.27-MDa complex of lysosomal hydrolases is essential for KS catabolism and that the disruption of this complex may be responsible for the KS accumulation in β-galactosidosis and galactosialidosis patients.

Recent studies indicated the importance of the supramolecular association of enzymes catalyzing subsequent metabolic reactions (5Robinson J. Srere P.A. J. Biol.

In lysosomes GAL and α-neuraminidase (NEUR, EC 3.2.1.18), the enzymes catalyzing the two first steps of ganglioside hydrolysis are associated with cathepsin A, also named protective protein (CathA, E.C. 3.4.16.1), into a lysosomal multienzyme complex necessary for both the activation of NEUR and stabilization of GAL within the lysosome (7d'Azzo A.

Recently we proposed the molecular mechanism of GAL protection by CathA and demonstrated that the complex purified from human placenta has a molecular mass of about 1.27 MDa and contains multiple protein components (11Pshezhetsky A.V. Elsliger M.-A. Vinogradova M. Potier M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2431-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 12Pshezhetsky A.V. Potier M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the present work we demonstrate that GALNS is the component of a 1.27-MDa complex, that this association protects GALNS in lysosome, and we explore the hypothesis that the supramolecular organization of lysosomal hydrolases is important for the catabolism of KS. The 1.27-MDa lysosomal complex was purified from human placenta using affinity chromatography on a concanavalin A-Sepharose column followed by affinity chromatography on a p-aminophenyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (PATGAL)-agarose column, which binds GAL, or on a Phe-Leu-agarose column, which binds CathA (12Pshezhetsky A.V. Potier M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 13Pshezhetsky A.V. Potier M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After affinity purification the preparations were dialyzed against 20 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2, containing 0.15 M NaCl and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 (buffer A), concentrated to ∼3 mg of protein/ml, and applied to a FPLC Superose 6 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), eluted with buffer A at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. 0.5-ml fractions were collected and analyzed for NEUR, GAL, CathA, and GALNS activities as well as by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) as described below. Fractions from the peak, corresponding to a molecular mass of 1.27 MDa and containing NEUR, GAL, and CathA activities, were pooled, dialyzed against 25 mM bis-Tris (Sigma Chemical Co.) buffer, pH 6.3, concentrated to 1 ml, and applied to a FPLC Mono P column equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with Polybuffer PB 74 (Pharmacia), previously diluted 10-fold in water and adjusted to pH 4.0 with 1 M HCl in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Fractions containing NEUR, GAL, and CathA activities were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and concentrated to 0.5 ml. The preparation of purified 1.27-MDa complex was frozen and stored at −70°C until used. GAL, NEUR, and HEXA were assayed using the corresponding fluorogenic 4-methylumbelliferyl (Muf)-glycoside derivatives as substrates according to published methods (14Potier M. Mameli L. Belisle M. Dallaire L. Melancon S.B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 15Okada S. O'Brien J.S.

Cell. 1979; 17: 143-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). CathA activity was measured using CBZ-Phe-Leu as a substrate (10Tranchemontagne J. Michaud L. Potier M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). GALNS was assayed either with the tritiated substrate 6-sulfo-N-acetylgalactosamine-glucuronic acid-6-sulfo-N-acetyl-[1-3H]galactosaminitol (GalNAc-6S, HSC Research and Development Ltd., Toronto), as described (17Glossi J. Kresse H. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1978; 88: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or with the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-galactopyranoside 6-sulfate (Muf-Gal-6S, Moscerdam, Amsterdam) using the following procedure. The reaction mixture containing 50 μl of the cellular homogenate, 25 μl of 1 M sodium acetate buffer, and 25 μl of 1 mM Muf-Gal-6S in the same buffer was incubated overnight at 37°C. The GALNS activity was then inhibited by addition of 25 μl of 2 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 4.75, and the mixture was supplemented with 0.5 μg (15-20 milliunits of GAL activity) of purified 680-kDa GAL·CathA lysosomal complex from human placenta (13Pshezhetsky A.V. Potier M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This reaction mixture was incubated further for 2 h at 37°C to convert all the Muf-Gal liberated during the first incubation into Muf (18van Diggelen O.P. Zhao H. Kleijer W.J. Janse H.C. Poorthuis B.J.H.M. van Pelt J. Kamerling J.P. Galjaard H. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1990; 187: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1.85 ml of 0.4 M glycine buffer, pH 10.5, and the concentration of Muf was assayed fluorometrically. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the conversion of 1 μmol of substrate/min. Proteins were assayed according to Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with BSA (Sigma) as standard. The electrophoretic analysis of proteins was performed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (11%, w/v) under reducing conditions according to the method of Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). To increase the sensitivity, the proteins were first stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 (Sigma) and then using the Fast Silver Staining Kit (Bio-Rad). The ratio between the proteins in the complex was estimated by scanning of the stained gels with an Ultroscan XL laser densitometer (LKB). The linearity of the microdensitometer response was established up to 20 μg of protein loaded on the gel. After electrophoretic separation, the proteins were electrotransferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) in a Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad) for 2.5 h at 4°C in 10 mM CAPS buffer, pH 11, 10% (v/v) methanol at a current of 480 mA. After staining with Coomassie Blue R-250 the bands were cut off, and amino acid sequences were determined in an Applied Biosystem 470 A gas phase Sequencer and identified using the BLAST network service at the National Center of Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, MD). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against purified human CathA were prepared as described previously (12Pshezhetsky A.V. Potier M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum against human HEXA was a generous gift of Dr. Roy A. Gravel (McGill University, Montreal). The antibodies against human GALNS were prepared as follows. The preparation of 1.27-MDa lysosomal complex purified as described above was dialyzed against 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5 (buffer B), and applied to a FPLC Mono Q column (Pharmacia). The column was eluted with linear 0-0.4 M gradient of NaCl in buffer B at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The fractions containing GALNS activity were pooled, concentrated to the volume of 0.2 ml, and applied to a Superose 12 column (Pharmacia), eluted with phosphate-buffered saline at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Purified GALNS preparation (45 μg), homogeneous by SDS-PAGE analysis, was emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant and used to immunize a rabbit by subcutaneous injections. 10 and 20 days after the first immunization the rabbit was boosted with another 45 μg of the same GALNS preparation in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The antiserum was used for Western blotting in a dilution of 1:5,000. 10 μg of 1.27-MDa complex purified by FPLC chromatofocusing or 350 μg of glycoprotein fraction purified from human placenta by concanavalin A-Sepharose chromatography (12Pshezhetsky A.V. Potier M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in 100 μl of buffer A was added to 100 μl of 0.15 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 1% (w/v) BSA. Increasing amounts (1-50 μl) of anti-human CathA, anti-HEXA antiserum, or preimmune rabbit serum were added to this mixture. After 1 h of incubation at 4°C, 200 μl of Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem) was added. The samples were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with constant shaking and then centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min; the supernatants were assayed for GAL, CathA, NEUR, GALNS, and HEXA activities as described. Cultured skin fibroblast homogenates (50 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to Immobilon-P membranes as described above. To visualize protein bands, the membrane was stained with 0.1% (w/v) Ponceau S (Sigma) in 5% (v/v) acetic acid. The dye was then washed completely with 5% (v/v) acetic acid, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked by the incubation at 37°C for 2 h in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% (w/v) MgCl2, and 3% (w/v) BSA. The membrane was then incubated at 4°C for 1 h with the anti-GALNS antiserum (1:5,000 dilution) in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% (w/v) MgCl2, and 3% (w/v) BSA, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% (v/v) Tween 30, and incubated with an anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). After washing as above, the GALNS-antibody complex was detected with TMB Blot and Slide reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) using the manufacturer's protocol. The fibroblast lines from normal individuals and from patients affected with galactosialidosis, β-galactosidosis (both GM1-gangliosidosis and Morquio type B), sialidosis, and Morquio type A were obtained from the NIGMS Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (lines GM02921, GM02685, GM05653, GM03251, GM01602, GM01259, GM00958, GM00593, GM00806, GM05076, and GM02438A) and from our cell bank (lines 89.40.11 and 83.29.34). The cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Mediatech, Washington, D. C.), supplemented with 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum and antibiotics in 150-cm2 Falcon flasks up to confluence (2-4 mg of protein/flask). The cells from one flask were harvested by trypsinization, rinsed with saline, sonicated in 1-2 ml of distilled water (5 s at 60 watts, twice), and assayed for enzyme activities as described above. Four days prior to the enzyme assays the purified placental 680-kDa GAL·CathA complex or CathA (12Pshezhetsky A.V. Potier M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 13Pshezhetsky A.V. Potier M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was added to the culture medium in a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. In another set of experiments, leupeptin was added to the medium at a final concentration of 20 μM to inhibit intralysosomal proteolytic degradation. The cells were harvested, and the enzyme activities were determined as described above. Fibroblasts (four T-150 flasks) from normal individuals and galactosialidosis and β-galactosidosis patients were suspended in 0.6 ml of 0.15 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2, containing 0.5 mg BSA/ml and 1% (w/v) Zwitterionic detergent 3-12 (Calbiochem) (8Hoogeveen A.T. Verheijen F.W. Galjaard H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12143-12146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were applied to a FPLC Superose 6 column eluted with 0.1% (w/v) Zwitterionic detergent 3-12 in buffer A at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. 0.5-ml fractions were collected and assayed for GAL, NEUR, CathA, and GALNS activities as described above. The HEXA activity in the fractions was used as an internal control. The molecular masses of the eluted enzymes were determined using the calibration curve obtained with the following molecular mass standards (Pharmacia): blue dextran (∼2,000 kDa), thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), BSA (69 kDa), chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). We purified the 1.27-MDa GAL·CathA·NEUR complex from human placenta using two different affinity chromatography methods: a Phe-Leu-agarose column for CathA binding and a PATGAL-agarose column for GAL binding (12Pshezhetsky A.V. Potier M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 13Pshezhetsky A.V. Potier M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The analysis of the affinity-purified preparations by FPLC gel filtration (Fig. 1, left panels) demonstrated that both contain two oligomeric forms: a 1.27-MDa GAL·CathA·NEUR complex (peak I in Fig. 1, a and b), which contains all NEUR and about 2% of total GAL and CathA activities in human placenta extract, and a 680-kDa GAL·CathA complex (peak II in Fig. 1, a and b), which contains most of GAL and 30% of total CathA. The remaining 70% of CathA in tissue is not associated with GAL and therefore is not retained on PATGAL-agarose affinity column. Free CathA is present in the Phe-Leu-agarose-purified preparation in the form of a 110-kDa dimer (peak III of the gel filtration profile in Fig. 1b). The protein composition of the 1.27-MDa complex was studied by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1, a and b, right panels) and NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing. In both Phe-Leu-agarose and PATGAL-agarose-purified preparations of the 1.27-MDa lysosomal complex we found three new protein components of 46, 40, and 35 kDa, respectively, in addition to the previously described (7d'Azzo A. Hoogeveen A. Reuser A.J. Robinson D. Galjaard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4535-4539Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) 64-kDa subunit of GAL (GAL64 in Fig. 1), and two 32- and 20-kDa subunits of CathA (CathA32 and CathA20 in Fig. 1). A 46-kDa protein had the NH2-terminal sequence (QRMFEIDYSRD) of human GAL (21Morreau H. Galjart N.J. Gillemans N. Willemsen R. van der Horst G.T. d'Azzo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20655-20663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and probably represents the recently reported 46-kDa product of GAL intralysosomal proteolytic digestion (22Okamura-Oho Y. Zhang S.Q. Hilson W. Hinek A. Callahan J.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal residue of the 35-kDa-33-kDa doublet protein (P35 in Fig. 1) was probably blocked, since no amino acid sequence was obtained. Molecular mass and NH2-terminal amino acid sequence (APQPPNILLLLMDDM) of the 40-kDa protein were identical to those (23Tomatsu S. Fukuda S. Masue M. Sukegawa K. Fukao T. Yamagishi A. Hori T. Iwata H. Ogawa T. Nakashima Y. et al.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) of the heavy subunit of human GALNS. We estimated from SDS-PAGE analysis that GALNS represents about 7-10% of the total protein of the 1.27-MDa complex. The relative amount of GALNS present in the preparation did not depend on the purification method, which suggests that GALNS binds to the complex specifically. In agreement with our data it has been reported that a 40-kDa protein with an NH2-terminal sequence homologous to that of human GALNS copurifies with GAL·NEUR·CathA complex from bovine testis (24van der Horst G.T.J. Ph.D. thesis, Erasmus University Press, Amsterdam. 1993; Google Scholar). GALNS activity assay in FPLC gel filtration fractions demonstrated that 50% of total GALNS in human placenta was copurified with the 1.27-MDa complex (peak I in Fig. 1, a and b). The other 50% of GALNS activity eluted as a second peak (peak III in Fig. 1, a and b), consistent with the reported 120-kDa homodimeric form of this enzyme (25Masue M. Sukegava K. Orii T. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem. 1991; 110: 965-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Purified by gel filtration 1.27-MDa complex was subjected to an additional purification step, FPLC chromatofocusing (Fig. 2). GALNS, GAL, CathA, and NEUR coeluted from the column at a pH 4.8 that corresponds to the pI of the whole complex. Under these conditions, only 5-10% of GALNS and CathA are unbound as estimated from the assay of their activities in the fractions eluting at a pH 6.0 and 5.4, corresponding to the pI values of free GALNS and CathA, respectively. The presence of GALNS within the 1.27-MDa complex was also confirmed by immunoprecipitation of the purified 1.27-MDa complex using antibodies against human CathA. The titration curves (Fig. 3a) for GALNS, CathA, GAL, and NEUR showed a proportional decrease of the activity of each of the four enzymes. Similar immunotitration curves were obtained with the crude glycoprotein fraction purified by concanavalin A-Sepharose affinity chromatography from human placenta extract (Fig. 3b). However, in this case about 40% of total GALNS activity in the glycoprotein fraction could not be precipitated by anti-CathA antibodies and probably represents the pool of free 120-kDa GALNS homodimers, which exists in equilibrium with the 1.27-MDa complex (Fig. 1). However, in vivo the ratio between the complex-bound and free GALNS could be sufficiently shifted toward the complex formation because of the extremely high protein concentration inside the lysosome, up to 100 mg of protein/ml (12Pshezhetsky A.V. Potier M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The activity of HEXA that is not part of the complex was unchanged by anti-CathA antibodies (Fig. 3b), and anti-human HEXA antibodies did not precipitate GALNS, CathA, GAL, and NEUR activities in both purified 1.27-MDa complex and crude glycoprotein fraction (Fig. 3, c and d), suggesting that the immunoprecipitation of the 1.27-MDa complex by anti-CathA antibodies is specific. In the lysosome GALNS and GAL catalyze the subsequent reactions of KS hydrolysis; therefore, transfer of the hydrolysis intermediates between the active sites of these enzymes in the 1.27-MDa complex may be an important step in the KS catabolic process. To explore the hypothesis that the association of GALNS with the complex is necessary for the proper intralysosomal KS catabolism we verified whether the complex exists in the cells of patients which accumulate KS. Two autosomal recessive diseases in which KS accumulates in abnormal amounts are known, both of which are associated with a characteristic skeletal dysplasia and corneal clouding in affected patients. The first, Morquio type A syndrome (MPS IV type A), is caused by the primary deficiency of GALNS (2Matalon R. Arbogast B. Justice P. Brandt I.K. Dorfman A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 61: 709-715Google Scholar, 3Singh J. Di Ferrante N. Niebes P. Tavella D. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 57: 1036-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 4Fukuda S. Tomatsu S. Masue M.

The second, Morquio type B syndrome (MPS IV type B) (26Arbisser A.I. Donnelly K.A. Scott C.I. DiFerrante N. Singh J. Stevenson R.E. Aylesworth A.S. Howell R.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1977; 1: 195-205Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar), clinically similar to MPS IV type A, results from GAL deficiency and is also named β-galactosidosis (27Suzuki Y. Sakuraba H. Oshima A. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. Vol. 2. McGraw-Hill, New York1995Google Scholar). Interestingly, a different set of mutations in GAL results in another clinical condition of β-galactosidosis, GM1-gangliosidosis, in which lipid substrate of GAL, GM1-ganglioside, accumulates in brain and viscera, resulting in mental retardation and hepatosplenomegaly. KS accumulation, which occurs in both clinical forms of β-galactosidosis (27Suzuki Y. Sakuraba H. Oshima A. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. Vol. 2. McGraw-Hill, New York1995Google Scholar), is presently explained by the primary deficiency of GAL. However, this hypothesis still does not explain the accumulation of both undersulfated and normally sulfated forms of KS, since normal or low normal levels of GALNS activity are detectable in cultured cells from patients (26Arbisser A.I. Donnelly K.A. Scott C.I. DiFerrante N. Singh J. Stevenson R.E. Aylesworth A.S. Howell R.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1977; 1: 195-205Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27Suzuki Y. Sakuraba H. Oshima A. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. Vol. 2. McGraw-Hill, New York1995Google Scholar). Using FPLC gel filtration on Superose 6 column we analyzed fibroblast extracts of β-galactosidosis patients (both GM1-gangliosidosis and MPS IV type B clinical forms) as well as extracts of control fibroblasts. About 30-40% of the GALNS activity and all of the NEUR activity of normal fibroblasts (Fig. 4a) are associated with the 1.27-MDa complex (peak I). Under these conditions, the 1.27-MDa complex exists in equilibrium with a 680-kDa GAL·CathA binary complex (peak II), GAL tetramers (peak III), and CathA and GALNS dimers (peak IV). This distribution of oligomeric forms is similar to that reported previously for human placenta (12Pshezhetsky A.V. Potier M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In contrast, in fibroblasts from β-galactosidosis patients (MPS IV type B) the 1.27-MDa complex and 680-kDa GAL·CathA complex are not detectable, and GALNS is present only in the 120-kDa homodimeric form (Fig. 4b, peak IV). The elution profiles of the enzyme activities of fibroblast extracts from GM1-gangliosidosis patients (not shown) were similar to those of MPS IV type B fibroblasts. Using the same method, we also analyzed fibroblast extracts from CathA-deficient (galactosialidosis) and NEUR-deficient (sialidosis) patients because in both diseases a deficiency of a single component of the 1.27-MDa complex could result in the disruption of the complex. Gel filtration of galactosialidosis fibroblast extracts (Fig. 4c) demonstrated the absence of the 1.27-MDa complex (previously (8Hoogeveen A.T. Verheijen F.W. Galjaard H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12143-12146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also shown by the ultracentrifugation method) suggesting that patients with galactosialidosis may excrete higher than normal amounts of KS in urine, similar to those described for MPS IV type A and β-galactosidosis patients. Indeed, the KS urinary excretion of a 16-year-old female galactosialidosis patient was elevated at the level of 2.1 mg/24 h, similar to that of MPS IV type A patients (1.8-2.4 mg/24 h; normal < 0.8 mg/24 h). 2Results of the analysis (n = 6) performed over several years at the Service de Génétique Médicale, Hôpital Sainte-Justine. On the other hand, in fibroblasts of NEUR-deficient patients, which do not accumulate KS (28Thomas G.H. Beaudet A.L. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 2. McGraw-Hill, New York1995Google Scholar), the 1.27-MDa complex was present, and the amount of complex-bound GALNS corresponded to those in the control fibroblasts (Fig. 4d, peak I). These results also suggest that the presence of NEUR is not essential for the association of the other enzymes in the 1.27-MDa complex. Interestingly, the disruption of the 1.27-MDa complex in galactosialidosis is also associated with a decreased level of GALNS activity (Fig. 4c). Further assay of GALNS activity in three other fibroblast lines of galactosialidosis patients (Table I) showed that the activity is reduced to 3-21% of normal. Of note, in MPS IV type A fibroblasts, used as a negative control, GALNS residual activity did not exceed 1-2% of normal (Table I). We found that the activity of GALNS, as well as that of GAL and NEUR, could be restored in galactosialidosis fibroblasts (cell line 83.29.34) by the addition of purified CathA or GAL·CathA 680-kDa complex to the culture medium (Table II). GALNS and GAL activities were also increased 3-4-fold by leupeptin inhibition of lysosomal proteases (Table II). These data are consistent with the rapid proteolytic degradation of unbound GALNS within lysosomes similar to that demonstrated for GAL (7d'Azzo A. Hoogeveen A. Reuser A.J. Robinson D. Galjaard H.

Chem. 1983; 258: 12143-12146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the reduced amount of GALNS cross-reacting material was detected by Western blotting in fibroblast homogenate of galactosialidosis patient (Fig. 5, lane 4), compared with control (lane 1), MPS IV type B (lane 2), and sialidosis (lane 3) patients. The leupeptin inhibition of lysosomal proteases resulted in reappearance of GALNS cross-reacting band on gel (lane 5).Table I.Enzyme activities in cultured skin fibroblastsFibroblast lineEnzyme activityaThe enzyme activities as the percents of control values are presented in parentheses.HEXGALCathANEURGALNS (GalNAc-6S)GALNS (Muf-Gal-6S)milliunits/mg proteinSialidosisGM02921109 ± 3 (125)12 ± 2 (45)258 ± 21 (70)0.03 ± 0.01 (1.9)0.034 ± 0.008 (100)0.057 ± 0.001 (89)GM0268568 ± 5 (78)18 ± 4 (67)279 ± 15 (75)ND0.026 ± 0.003 (76)0.044 ± 0.001 (68)β-Galactosidosis (GM1-gangliosidosis)89.40.11144 ± 2 (165)1.2 ± 0.05 (4.6)394 ± 32 (106)1.3 ± 0.2 (81)0.027 ± 0.03 (79)GM0565361 ± 5 (70)0.3 ± 0.03 (1.1)336 ± 40 (91)2.1 ± 0.2 (131)0.012 ± 0.001 (35)0.023 ± 0.001 (36)GM0533584 ± 19 (96)1.6 ± 0.8 (5.9)253 ± 6 (68)1.7 ± 0.1 (106)0.027 ± 0.015 (79)0.022 ± 0.002 (34)β-Galactosidosis (Morquio type B)GM0325149 ± 2 (56)1.1 ± 0.03 (4.1)254 ± 12 (69)1.63 ± 0.2 (102)0.009 ± 0.006 (26Arbisser A.I.

Open table in a new tab On the other hand, GALNS activity is low normal (∼50% of control), and NEUR activity is normal in β-galactosidosis fibroblasts (Table I), in which the complex does not exist. Gel filtration analysis of β-galactosidosis fibroblast extracts (Fig. 4b) demonstrated that NEUR is present as large (>3 MDa) aggregates with CathA which elute in the void volume (V0) of the column (Fig. 4b, peak V). As was demonstrated previously (9van der Horst G.J. Galjart N.J. d'Azzo A. Galjaard H. Verheijen F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1317-1322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the association with CathA only is sufficient for the expression of NEUR activity. It is tempting to speculate that a similar protective mechanism may also apply to GALNS in β-galactosidosis cells, although a GALNS·CathA binary complex has not yet been directly demonstrated. The normal level of GALNS activity in sialidosis fibroblasts (Table I) is in agreement with the presence of the 1.27-MDa complex in these cells (Fig. 4d, peak I). Altogether, our results demonstrate that the majority of GALNS in the lysosome is associated with the 1.27-MDa multienzyme complex, which also includes GAL, CathA, and NEUR. The complex is not present in the cells of β-galactosidosis and galactosialidosis patients which accumulate KS. We suggest that 1.27-MDa multienzyme complex is necessary for proper KS catabolism, which can reflect the importance of supramolecular structure for the hydrolytic function of the lysosome. The recent assays performed with two other fibroblast lines from galactosialidosis patients demonstrated that residual GALNS activity could be higher than that reported in the paper, up to 40% of normal control level."

Far Western analysis and the rebinding interaction with recombinant PP-1C distinguished proteins in the eluates that bound PP-1C from those that bound PP-2AC. In Far Western analysis, 29 distinct proteins were identified to bind PP-1C.

The involvement of PP-1 and PP-2A in all of these important cellular events raises the question as to how all of these processes can be regulated independently of one another. This question is even more apparent when one considers that both PP-1 and PP-2A are expressed at micromolar concentrations in cells and share a 49% sequence homology within their catalytic core (1Ingebritsen T.S.

Significantly many of the PP-1 subunits are the targets of serine/threonine protein kinases activated by insulin or adrenaline. For example, I1 and its close relative DARPP-32, specifically inhibit PP-1 when they are phosphorylated by cyclic A kinase (24Aitkin A. Bilham T. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 126: 246-253Google Scholar, 25Hemmings H.C. Greengard P. Tung H.Y.L. Cohen P. Nature. 1984; 310: 503-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Similarly, the 124-kDa skeletal muscle G (GSK) subunit of PP-1 can be phosphorylated both in vitro and in vivo at two regulatory sites. Phosphorylation at site 2 by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in vitro causes dissociation of PP-1C from the G subunit and the glycogen particle (26Hiraga A. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 28Hubbard M.J. Dent P. Smythe C. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast, phosphorylation of the G subunit at a second site (site 1) by the insulin-stimulated protein kinase ISPK1 selectively increases the activity of PP-1GSK toward glycogen synthase (29Dent P. Lavoinne A. Nakielny S. Caudwell F.B. Watt P. Cohen P. Nature. 1990; 348: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Based on the unique relationship between PP-1C and its G subunit, Cohen and co-workers have proposed a model to explain how insulin and adrenaline might control the synthesis and degradation of glycogen through the association/dissociation of the catalytic subunit with its glycogen targeting subunit (11Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). A liver equivalent to GSK, GL, was also recently purified, which although homologous to GSK is of smaller molecular weight (23Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.

In the case of regulation of smooth muscle contraction, the M110 subunit in conjunction with its M21 regulatory component binds PP-1C to myosin and selectively alters its substrate specificity toward myosin (17Alessi D.

We and others have shown that alterations in the activity of SMPP-1M in vivo profoundly effects the contractile state of smooth muscle. Phosphorylation of M110 and allosteric regulation appear to be two mechanisms by which the activity of SMPP-1M is controlled (31Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V.

Homologous forms of M subunit have also been purified from skeletal muscle, where it has been proposed to play a role in the development and maintenance of muscle tension (35MacKintosh R.W. Dalby K.N. Campbell D.G. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. MacKintosh C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The regulation of glycogen metabolism and muscle contraction by the G and M subunits represent only two cellular events that are known to be regulated by PP-1. Clearly these two subunits alone and the inhibitor proteins cannot account for all the intracellular actions of PP-1. To examine the possibility that other regulatory subunits exist in cells we used biotinylated microcystin LR (MC-biotin) to specifically affinity purify over avidin-Sepharose native PP-1 and PP-2A holoenzyme complexes from skeletal muscle extracts. Following affinity purification, PP-1 and PP-2A could be separated into many distinct holoenzymic forms by anion-exchange chromatography. To specifically identify PP-1C binding proteins from those that interact with PP-2AC a combination of Far Western analysis and rebinding interaction with recombinant PP-1C was utilized. Using these approaches we report the identification of up to 36 novel PP-1C binding proteins in the particulate and cytosolic fractions of skeletal muscle. This finding strongly supports the hypothesis that the catalytic subunit of PP-1 is regulated by multiple targeting subunits that specifically localize the phosphatase intracellularly. MC-Sepharose was prepared following the method of Moorhead et al. (16Moorhead G. MacKintosh R.W. Morrice N. Gallagher T. MacKintosh C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Antibodies to the subunits of PP-2A were a gift from Dr. Marc Mumby (University of Texas, Dallas). Antibodies to PP-1C and the plasmid pTacTac-CS1α for the expression of recombinant PP-1Cα were generous gifts from Dr. Anna DePaoli-Roach (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Indiana). Antibody to the G subunit was a gift from Dr. David Brautigan (Markey Center for Cell Signaling, University of Virginia). Microcystin was purchased from LC services (Boston, MA) or was a gift from Dr. Geoffrey Codd (University of Dundee, Scotland). Iodoacetyl-LC-biotin was purchased from Pierce. The N-methyldehydroalanine residue of MC was derivatized with ethanedithiol (EDT) to form the product EDT-MC using a modification of the reaction conditions described by Moorhead et al. (16Moorhead G. MacKintosh R.W. Morrice N. Gallagher T. MacKintosh C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Approximately 5.0 mg of MC were dissolved in 90 μl of ethanol and mixed with 200 μl of water, 65 μl of 5 M NaOH, 6 μl of 250 mM EDTA, 245 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide, and 15 μl of EDT. All components were gassed thoroughly with nitrogen prior to mixing. After 60 min at 55°C 1.0 ml of 17.4 M glacial acetic acid was added and the mixture diluted 10-fold with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid containing 1 mM Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP). HPLC analysis showed that reaction of MC with EDT resulted in a shift in the retention time of MC from 34.12 min to 28.00, consistent with the formation of the product EDT-MC (Fig. 1, A and B). Quantitation of peak areas showed that conversion of MC to EDT-MC to be 95 ± 1.2% (S.E., n = 3). The products of the reaction were applied to a C18 Sep-Pak (Waters) cartridge equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 1 mM TCEP solution, and EDT-MC-eluted in a minimal volume of acetonitrile. Following evaporation to dryness, the EDT-MC was dissolved in 1.0 ml of 50 mM borate, pH 9.2, 1 mM TCEP and incubated in the dark with 6 μmol of iodoacetyl-LC-biotin/μmol of EDT-MC for 90 min at room temperature. Analysis by HPLC showed that the reaction of EDT-MC with iodoacetyl-LC-biotin resulted in a dramatic shift in retention time of EDT-MC to 40.5 min (Fig. 1C), consistent with the formation of MC-biotin. Spectral analysis of the 40.5-min peak indicated that, in addition to an extinction maximum at 238 nm, the product also showed increased absorbance at 200 nm consistent with the addition of LC-biotin to the free sulfur atom of EDT-MC. This result was further confirmed by mixing the isolated 40.50 peak with avidin-Sepharose which quantitatively bound the product (Fig. 1D). The efficiency of conversion of EDT-MC to MC-biotin was 94 ± 5.6% (S.E., n = 3). MC-biotin was purified by preparative reverse phase HPLC, evaporated to dryness and stored in ethanol at −20°C. The plasmid pTacTac-CS1α (0.5 μg) was transfected into bacterial strain DH5α and individual colonies grown at 30°C in LB (2 liters) containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) until an absorbance of 0.3 was reached at 600 nm. Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (0.25 mM final) and 0.5 mM MnCl2 were added to induce expression and proper folding of the recombinant protein. After 16 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min. Following freezing at −20°C, the cells were thawed and lysed in 20 ml of buffer D (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mM MnCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 6 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM benzamidine) containing 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme. Following complete lysis, Nonidet P-40 (10 μl/liter) was added, and the lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was passed over MC-Sepharose (5 × 10 cm column) and washed extensively with buffer A containing 1 M salt and 0.5 mM MnCl2. The column was incubated for 2 h with 3 M sodium isothiocyanate in buffer A and 0.5 mM MnCl2. The bound phosphatase was eluted in this buffer and dialyzed immediately into buffer A containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.5 mM MnCl2. SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining showed that the eluted phosphatase was essentially 95% pure (Fig. 2). Against [32P]phosphorylase a, the recombinant enzyme had a specific activity of 15 ± 4 μmol/min/mg (n = 3, SE), which is close to the specific activity of native PP-1C purified from rabbit skeletal muscle (36Stewart A.A. Hemmings B.A. Goris J. Merlevede W. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 205: 196-205Google Scholar). For the preparation of PP-1C bound to MC-biotin (PP-1C-MC-biotin), the bacterial extracts were applied to avidin-Sepharose previously saturated with MC-biotin. The column was washed extensively with buffer A containing 1 M NaCl, 0.5 mM MnCl2, and the bound protein was eluted with 1 mM biotin in buffer A. The rectus abdomenus muscle of a single euthanized male Wistar rat (300 g) was removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen muscle was powdered in liquid N2, weighed, and 30 g (wet weight) of tissue were homogenized in 10 ml of buffer A (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 25 mM NaFl, 0.15 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol plus the protease inhibitors 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM benzamidine, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, 10 μg/ml soya bean trypsin inhibitor, and 0.1 μg/ml aprotinin) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was kept (particulate fraction). The supernatant, comprising cytosolic proteins and glycogen particles, was removed and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4°C to isolate the glycogen fraction. The 100,000 × g supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was precleared of endogenous biotinylated proteins by passing over avidin-Sepharose (2 × 5 cm column) equilibrated in buffer A. The precleared extract was mixed with 10 μM MC-biotin and applied to fresh avidin-Sepharose. Note that this concentration of MC-biotin was sufficient to completely inhibit all detectable PP-1 and PP-2A activity present in the extract as determined by phosphorylase phosphatase assay (36Stewart A.A. Hemmings B.A. Goris J. Merlevede W. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 205: 196-205Google Scholar). The avidin column was washed extensively with buffer A containing 1 M salt and then buffer A. The bound proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 1 mM biotin, and the eluate was applied to an AP-1Q 8HR (Waters) anion-exchange column (2.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed extensively and developed with a linear 120 min salt gradient from 0 to 1 M NaCl. Column fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. To characterize the glycogen fraction, a 100,000 × g pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A and recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, and the washed glycogen pellet was resuspended and homogenized in buffer B (buffer A containing 0.5% Triton X-100). The resuspended pellet was digested with 20 μg/ml α-amylase for 120 min at 30°C (11Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), then precleared through avidin-Sepharose. The precleared extract was mixed with MC-biotin (10 μM), reapplied to fresh avidin-Sepharose, and characterized as described above. For characterization of the particulate fraction, the 15,000 × g pellet was homogenized in 25 ml of buffer B and recentrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was decanted, and the pellet was homogenized in 10 ml of buffer C (buffer A containing 0.6 M NaCl and 0.5% Triton X-100). The homogenate was incubated on ice for 30 min, then an equal volume of buffer C was added. Following centrifugation (15,000 × g for 30 min) the supernatant was dialyzed against 20 volumes of buffer A for 6 h, precleared of endogenous biotinylated proteins, then treated with MC-biotin for affinity purification over avidin-Sepharose. For Far Western analysis, the MC-biotin eluates were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) following SDS-PAGE. The blots were first incubated overnight with 100 mg/ml ovalbumin and 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in TBST (150 mM, NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4), then washed three times with TBST. The blots were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 2.5 μg/ml purified recombinant PP-1Cα in TBST containing 0.5 mM MnCl2, washed extensively with TBST, and incubated with antibody to PP-1Cα for 2 h. Following washing, the blots were incubated with anti-rabbit antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase. PP-1C binding proteins were detected by ECL (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For control blots, recombinant PP-1Cα was omitted from the experiment. For Identification of PP-1C binding proteins by rebinding interaction, particulate and cytosolic fractions were prepared and passed separately over a column of MC-Sepharose (5 × 10 cm) equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed extensively with buffer C to disrupt any nonspecific ionic or nonionically bound proteins. The column was incubated for 2 h with 3 M sodium isothiocyanate in buffer A, and the proteins were eluted in this buffer. This procedure was found to separate PP-1C and its associated proteins from PP-2AC which remained bound to the Sepharose. Although, under these conditions the regulatory subunits of PP-2A were eluted from the column. The isothiocyanate eluate was dialyzed into buffer A containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.5 mM MnCl2, and the recombinant PP-1C-MC-biotin complex (10 μM) was added. Incubation of the dialyzed isothiocyanate eluate with PP-1C-MC-biotin served two purposes. First, it ensured optimal reassociation with the eluted PP-1C binding proteins. Second, it reduced the possibility that any PP-2AC that did elute from the MC-Sepharose would be recovered from subsequent application to avidin-Sepharose. The dialyzed mixture was applied to an avidin-Sepharose column (10 × 5 cm) and washed extensively with buffer C and then buffer A. After incubating the column for 2 h with 10 mM biotin in buffer A, the bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The ability of MC-biotin to inhibit purified PP-2AC, PP-1C and SMPP-1M was compared with microcystin (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 shows that MC-biotin displayed similar IC50 values toward PP-1C and PP-2AC (PP-2AC IC50 = 0.630 ± 0.2 nM; PP-1C IC50 = 1.58 ± 0.6 nM S.E., n = 3), although these were approximately 4-5-fold higher than values obtained for free microcystin in the same assay (PP-2AC IC50 = 0.16 ± 0.02 nM; PP-1C IC50 = 0.25 ± 0.01 nM S.E., n = 3). Reduction in the efficiency of MC-biotin binding is consistent with modification of the N-methyldehydroalanine moiety of microcystin, which participates in a covalent bond with conserved cysteine residues in the catalytic clefts of both PP-1C (Cys-273) and PP-2AC (Cys-266) (37Runnegar M. Berndt N. Kong S. Lee E.Y.C. Zhang L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 38Goldberg J. Huang H. Kwon Y. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). In contrast to the free catalytic subunits, when assayed against purified SMPP-1M, MC-biotin displayed similar IC50 values to free microcystin (MC-biotin, IC50 = 5.9 ± 1.3; MC, IC50 = 6.0 ± 0.5 nM S.E., n = 3) (Fig. 3C). The finding that microcystin was generally less potent against SMPP-1M compared with PP-1C may reflect steric hindrance effects due to the presence of its two regulatory subunits, M110 and M20 (17Alessi D.

To test the hypothesis that multiple PP-1 and PP-2A holoenzymic forms exit in cells, we utilized MC-biotin to rapidly affinity purify over avidin-Sepharose active forms of these phosphatases present in the particulate, cytosolic, and glycogen fractions of rat skeletal muscle. Recently, MacKintosh and co-workers (16Moorhead G. MacKintosh R.W. Morrice N. Gallagher T. MacKintosh C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 30Moorhead G.

However, two problems arise with the use of MC-Sepharose. First, denaturing conditions are required to elute PP-2AC from MC-Sepharose. Second, kaotroptic agents are used to elute the bound phosphatases resulting in dissociation of the regulatory subunits from their catalytic subunits. Two major advantages are gained by linking microcystin to biotin. First, mild conditions are used to elute the bound proteins, and second, the holoenzyme complexes remain intact. The entire compliment of active forms of cytosolic and particulate associated PP-1/PP-2A holoenzymes were affinity-purified over avidin-Sepharose and subsequently separated into their various holoenzymic forms by anion-exchange chromatography. SDS-PAGE and silver staining of the column fractions reveals that a complex pattern of proteins associate with PP-1C and PP-2AC in these fractions (Fig. 4). Several lines of evidence indicate that these associations are specific. First, microcystin has been shown to be completely selective for the catalytic subunits of PP-1 and PP-2A (for review, see Ref. 7MacKintosh C. MacKintosh R.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 444-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Second, pretreatment of extracts with a saturating amount of free microcystin (10 μM) completely abolishes all recovery of these proteins including the catalytic subunits of PP-1 and PP-2A (data not shown). Furthermore, stringent column washing conditions are employed throughout (1 M NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100) to break nonspecific ionic and hydrophobic interactions prior to elution of PP-1/PP-2A holoenzymes from avidin-Sepharose with biotin. More direct evidence that MC-biotin selectively recovers PP-1 and PP-2A holoenzymes was obtained following Western analysis of the anion-exchange column fractions with a series of antibodi"

The expression of mouse NtN-amidase in S. cerevisiae nta1Δ was used to verify that NtN-amidase retains its asparagine selectivity in vivo and can implement the asparagine-specific subset of the N-end rule. Further dissection of mouse Ntan1, including its null phenotype analysis, should illuminate the functions of the N-end rule, most of which are still unknown. INTRODUCTIONFeatures of proteins that confer metabolic instability are called degradation signals, or degrons (1Varshavsky A. Cell. 1991; 64: 13-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The essential component of one degradation signal, termed the N-degron, is a destabilizing N-terminal residue of a protein (2Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A.

A set of N-degrons containing different destabilizing residues yields a rule, termed the N-end rule, that relates the in vivo half-life 1The term “half-life” is used in this paper as a rough approximation since the in vivo degradation of many short-lived proteins, including the engineered N-end rule substrates, deviates from a first-order kinetics.

In particular, the N-end rule pathway has been shown to be required for the import of peptides in S. cerevisiae (9Alagramam K. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol.

In eukaryotes such as the yeast S. cerevisiae, Asn and Gln are tertiary destabilizing N-terminal residues (denoted as N-dt) in that they function through their conversion, by N-terminal amidohydrolase (Nt-amidase), into the secondary destabilizing N-terminal residues Asp and Glu (denoted as N-ds), whose destabilizing activity requires their conjugation, by Arg-tRNA-protein transferase (R-transferase), to Arg, one of the primary destabilizing N-terminal residues (denoted as N-dp) (6Bachmair A.

The N-dp residues are bound directly by N-recognin (also called E3), the recognition component of the N-end rule pathway (4Varshavsky A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1996; 60 (and references therein): 461-478Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, N-recognin is a 225-kDa protein (encoded by UBR1) that selects potential N-end rule substrates by binding to their N-dp residue Phe, Leu, Trp, Tyr, Ile, Arg, Lys, or His (29Bartel B.

This binding is followed by the formation of a substrate-linked multi-Ub chain in a reaction mediated by the Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2) Ubc2p, one of at least 11 distinct E2 enzymes in S. cerevisiae (31Madura K.

In contrast to the yeast Nt-amidase (Nta1p), this Nt-amidase, termed NtN-amidase, can deamidate N-terminal Asn but not Gln. Described below is the isolation and characterization of Ntan1, an ∼17-kb gene 4The names of mouse genes are in italics, with the first letter upper-case.

Furthermore, both N-terminal Asn and Gln of test proteins are deamidated in mammalian cell extracts (7Gonda D.K. Bachmair A. Wünning I. Tobias J.W. Lane W.S. Varshavsky A. J. Biol.

Since NtN-amidase deamidates N-terminal Asn but not Gln, there must exist yet another mammalian Nt-amidase, which can deamidate N-terminal Gln. The resulting bifurcation in the structure of the mammalian N-end rule is illustrated in Fig. 1. Ntan1 is the first cloned mammalian gene whose function appears to be confined to the N-end rule pathway.DISCUSSIONStewart et al. (39Stewart A.E. Arfin S.M. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol.

Described in the present paper is a further study of this enzyme, carried out with its mouse counterpart. We report the following results.1) The mouse Ntan1 gene spans ∼17 kb of genomic DNA and contains 10 exons ranging from 54 to 177 bp in length. The ∼1.4-kb Ntan1 mRNA encodes a 310-residue (35 kDa) protein, NTAN1 or NtN-amidase.2) The mapping of Ntan1, carried out using interspecific backcross analysis, located it in the proximal region of mouse chromosome 16, in an area devoid of uncloned mouse mutations.3) The deduced amino acid sequence of mouse NtN-amidase lacks motifs that resemble membrane-spanning regions, signal sequences, or nuclear localization signals. The sequence of mouse NtN-amidase is 88 and 92% identical to the deduced sequences of porcine and human NtN-amidases, respectively. However, there are no significant sequence similarities between NtN-amidases and other known amidotransferases, including the NTA1-encoded Nt-amidase of the yeast S. cerevisiae. The 52-kDa Nta1p protein, a component of the S. cerevisiae N-end rule pathway, can deamidate N-terminal Asn or Gln (27Baker R.T. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12065-12074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), whereas the 35-kDa mammalian NtN-amidase can deamidate N-terminal Asn but not Gln (Fig. 1) (39Stewart A.E. Arfin S.M. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23509-23517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).4) The putative promoter region of Ntan1 is located ∼500 bp upstream of the Ntan1 start codon. In addition to the TATA box and CCAAT consensus sequences, this region contains putative binding sites for many of the known transcription factors, including CP-1, AP-1, AP-2, E2A, c/EBP, SDR, PEA3, NFuE1, NFuE2, HNF-1, Ets1, H-2DIIBP, PU.1, and HC3.5) Northern analyses of the ∼1.4-kb Ntan1 mRNA showed it to be present in roughly equal amounts in all of the mouse tissues examined, including skeletal muscle, brain, and liver. The examined mouse cell lines expressed Ntan1 more strongly than did mouse tissues. While the in vitro differentiation of either Friend or lymphoma cells did not lead to a significant alteration in the amount of Ntan1 mRNA, its level was found to be decreased ∼4-fold upon the conversion of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes.6) An isoelectric focusing assay was used to compare the in vitro enzymatic specificities of the mouse NtN-amidase and the yeast Nt-amidase. These experiments, using 35S-X-DHFR test proteins and extracts from S. cerevisiae nta1Δ that either lacked or expressed mouse NtN-amidase, have shown that NtN-amidase deamidates N-terminal Asn but not Gln.7) The expression of mouse NTAN1 in S. cerevisiae nta1Δ was found to restore the degradation of Asn-βgal but not Gln-βgal, indicating that mouse NtN-amidase can implement the Asn-specific subset of the yeast N-end rule and also showing that the in vitro selectivity of this enzyme for N-terminal Asn is retained in vivo.The hierarchic structure of the N-end rule “disperses” the domains that recognize specific destabilizing N-terminal residues among several proteins such as Nt-amidase, R-transferase, and N-recognin (see the Introduction and Fig. 1). The regulatory possibilities of this arrangement are apparent, but physiological substrates of Nt-amidase and R-transferase remain unknown in both fungi and metazoans. Part of the difficulty in identifying these substrates stems from the fact that although a number of apparently cytosolic or nuclear proteins bear, at least initially, the N-terminal sequence Met-Asn or Met-Gln (39Stewart A.E. Arfin S.M. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23509-23517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the known Met-aminopeptidases are incapable of removing N-terminal Met if it is followed by an Asn or a Gln residue (4Varshavsky A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1996; 60 (and references therein): 461-478Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, at least the Met-Asn sequence is often acetylated at the N-terminal Met residue (83Arfin S.M. Bradshaw R.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7979-7984Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether any of the resulting Ac-Met-Asn-containing N-terminal regions are processed in vivo to yield N-terminal Asn. Recently, certain sequences bearing N-terminal Met-Gln have been found to yield N-terminal Gln in vivo (84Ghislain M. Dohmen R.J. Lévy F. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The corresponding processing protease(s) remains to be identified. The isolation of Ntan1 and the resulting possibility of producing mouse ntan1Δ cells through targeted mutagenesis may provide additional routes to physiological substrates of NtN-amidase, for instance, through a search for proteins whose metabolic stabilities (or isoelectric points) differ between Ntan1 and ntan1Δ cells.The possibility that certain cell types in a multicellular organism may lack NtN-amidase, yielding, in these cells, an N-end rule pathway that spares normally short-lived proteins bearing N-terminal Asn, has been made less likely by the finding that Ntan1 is expressed in all of the mouse tissues and cell lines examined. However, the Northern-based Ntan1 expression assays used thus far (Fig. 5) have been crude, their results being still compatible with the possibility of strong local differences in the levels of Ntan1 expression within specific tissues. Furthermore, if a binding site for NtN-amidase in a targeting complex of the mammalian N-end rule pathway overlaps with a binding site for the postulated NtQ-amidase, the competition between these enzymes for binding to the targeting complex and the likely presence of substrate channeling in the N-end rule pathway (27Baker R.T. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12065-12074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) may strongly influence the degradation of N-end rule substrates bearing N-terminal Asn versus those bearing N-terminal Gln. This hypothesis may account for the paradoxically slow degradation of Gln-βgal (but not Asn-βgal) in C2C12 myoblasts, which exhibited the highest level of Ntan1 mRNA among the tested mouse tissues and cell lines, but contained the postulated NtQ-amidase as well, as indicated by in vitro deamidation tests with extracts from C2C12 cells.5The apparent absence of Ntan1 homologs in the mouse genome (those that can be detected by a low-stringency Southern hybridization) (data not shown) suggests that the postulated NtQ-amidase might be encoded by a differentially spliced mRNA derived from the Ntan1 gene. Indeed, although no differential splicing of mouse Ntan1 pre-mRNA has been detected thus far, the GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank was found to contain partial nucleotide sequences of apparent human NTAN1 cDNAs (accession numbers H27710, H28425, R10897, N98532, H44229, N93132, N80205, and N69930), one of which (H28425), but not the others, lacks exon II of Ntan1 (data not shown). In addition, intron I (Figs. 2B and 3), which abuts exon II, contains noncanonical dinucleotide sequences at both 5′- and 3′-splice sites (see “Results”). This circumstantial evidence for the hypothesis of a single gene encoding both NtN-amidase and NtQ-amidase remains to be verified directly.The hierarchic organization of N-end rules, with their tertiary, secondary, and primary destabilizing residues (N-dt, N-ds, and N-dp, respectively), is a feature that is more conserved in evolution than the Ub dependence of an N-end rule pathway or the identity of enzymatic reactions that mediate the hierarchy of destabilizing residues (4Varshavsky A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1996; 60 (and references therein): 461-478Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For example, in a bacterium such as E. coli, which lacks the Ub system, the N-end rule has both N-ds and N-dp residues (it lacks N-dt residues) (Fig. 1) (5Tobias J.W. Shrader T.E. Rocap G. Varshavsky A. Science. 1991; 254: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 85Shrader T.E. Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4364-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The identities of N-ds residues in E. coli (Arg and Lys) are different from those in eukaryotes (Asp and Glu in yeast; Asp, Glu, and Cys in mammals). Bacterial and eukaryotic enzymes that implement the coupling between N-ds and N-dp residues are also different: Leu/Phe-tRNA-protein transferase in E. coli and R-transferase in eukaryotes. Note, however, that bacterial Leu/Phe-tRNA-protein transferase and eukaryotic R-transferase catalyze reactions of the same type (conjugation of an amino acid to an N-terminal residue of a polypeptide) and use the same source of activated amino acid (aminoacyl-tRNA) (Fig. 1).The apparent confinement of R-transferase to eukaryotes and of Leu/Phe-tRNA-protein transferase to prokaryotes (Fig. 1) suggests that secondary destabilizing residues were recruited late in the evolution of the N-end rule, after the divergence of prokaryotic and eukaryotic lineages. The lack of sequence similarity between the yeast Nt-amidase and the mammalian NtN-amidase and the more narrow specificity of the mammalian enzyme (Fig. 1) suggest that tertiary destabilizing residues (Asn and Gln) became a part of the N-end rule pathway much later yet, possibly after the divergence of metazoan and fungal lineages. If so, the N-end rule pathway may be an especially informative witness of evolution: the ancient origins of this proteolytic system, the simplicity and discreteness of changes in the rule books of N-end rules among different species, and the diversity of proteins that either produce or target the N-degron should facilitate phylogenetic deductions once the components of this pathway become characterized across a broad range of organisms.Although the properties of the Ntan1-encoded mouse NtN-amidase are fully consistent with its being a component of the mouse N-end rule pathway and although mouse NtN-amidase was shown to be capable of implementing the Asn-specific subset of the yeast N-end rule in vivo, a rigorous test of the presumed function of this enzyme requires the production of mouse cell lines and/or whole animals that lack Ntan1. Work in this direction is under way. INTRODUCTIONFeatures of proteins that confer metabolic instability are called degradation signals, or degrons (1Varshavsky A. Cell. 1991; 64: 13-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The essential component of one degradation signal, termed the N-degron, is a destabilizing N-terminal residue of a protein (2Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A.

A set of N-degrons containing different destabilizing residues yields a rule, termed the N-end rule, that relates the in vivo half-life 1The term “half-life” is used in this paper as a rough approximation since the in vivo degradation of many short-lived proteins, including the engineered N-end rule substrates, deviates from a first-order kinetics.

In particular, the N-end rule pathway has been shown to be required for the import of peptides in S. cerevisiae (9Alagramam K. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol.

In eukaryotes such as the yeast S. cerevisiae, Asn and Gln are tertiary destabilizing N-terminal residues (denoted as N-dt) in that they function through their conversion, by N-terminal amidohydrolase (Nt-amidase), into the secondary destabilizing N-terminal residues Asp and Glu (denoted as N-ds), whose destabilizing activity requires their conjugation, by Arg-tRNA-protein transferase (R-transferase), to Arg, one of the primary destabilizing N-terminal residues (denoted as N-dp) (6Bachmair A.

The N-dp residues are bound directly by N-recognin (also called E3), the recognition component of the N-end rule pathway (4Varshavsky A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

In S. cerevisiae, N-recognin is a 225-kDa protein (encoded by UBR1) that selects potential N-end rule substrates by binding to their N-dp residue Phe, Leu, Trp, Tyr, Ile, Arg, Lys, or His (29Bartel B.

Since NtN-amidase deamidates N-terminal Asn but not Gln, there must exist yet another mammalian Nt-amidase, which can deamidate N-terminal Gln. The resulting bifurcation in the structure of the mammalian N-end rule is illustrated in Fig. 1. Ntan1 is the first cloned mammalian gene whose function appears to be confined to the N-end rule pathway."

Effector cell protease receptor (EPR-1) was identified as a novel leukocyte cell surface receptor recognizing the coagulation serine protease Factor Xa but not the precursor Factor X. We now demonstrate that EPR-1 is expressed on vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. Northern blots of endothelial and smooth muscle cells demonstrated three abundant mRNA bands of 3.0, 1.8, and 1.3 kDa. 125I-Labeled Factor Xa bound to endothelial cells in a dose-dependent saturable manner, and the binding was inhibited by antibody to EPR-1. No specific binding was observed with a recombinant mutant Factor X in which the activation site was substituted by Arg196→ Gln to prevent the proteolytic conversion to Xa. EPR-1 was identified immunohistochemically on microvascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Functionally, exposure of smooth muscle cells or endothelial cells to Factor Xa induced a 3-fold and a 2-fold increase in [3H]thymidine uptake, respectively. However, receptor occupancy alone is insufficient for mitogenic signaling because the active site of the enzyme is required for mitogenesis. Thus, EPR-1 represents a site of specific protease-receptor complex assembly, which during local initiation of the coagulation cascade could mediate cellular signaling and responses of the vessel wall.

Thus, EPR-1 represents a site of specific protease-receptor complex assembly, which during local initiation of the coagulation cascade could mediate cellular signaling and responses of the vessel wall. The ordered assembly of proteins of the coagulation cascade on cell surfaces results in greatly enhanced kinetic efficiency of protease function and protease generation as well as protection of proteases from their extracellular inhibitors. Endothelial cells, which constitute the cellular barrier between blood and the smooth muscle cells of the vessel wall, may initiate and assemble functional thrombin-generating cascades following vessel injury. In addition to thrombus generation, proteins in the cascade can directly initiate receptor-coupled cellular signaling and functional responses. In addition to its role in clotting and in the anticoagulation pathways mediated by specific proteolytic conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and thrombomodulin-dependent activation of protein C, thrombin binds to a G-protein coupled cell surface receptor and initiates intracellular signal transduction and cell activation events. In contrast to the thrombin receptor, which is activated by cleavage, EPR-1, 1The abbreviations used are: EPR-1effector protease receptor 1TFtissue factorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered salinemAbmonoclonal antibodyECendothelial cellTAPtick anticoagulant proteinBSAbovine serum albuminPECAMplatelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule. the receptor recognizing the protease Factor Xa, possesses high affinity (1Altieri D.

As a result, the association of the generated proteases with cell surface receptors can initiate such diverse cellular functions as proliferation (3Chen L. Teng N. Buchanan J. Exp.

Anti-Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) mAb OKM1, which inhibits Factor X binding to monocytes, was prepared as described previously (16Altieri D.C. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7007-7015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) antibody, HEC-7, was previously characterized by Muller et al. (17Muller W. Berman M. Newman P. De Lisser H. Albelda S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1401-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The endotoxin content of materials were determined by chromogenic limulus amoebocyte assay QCL-1000 (BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD). Factor X was highly purified from human plasma as described (18Fair D. Plow E. Edgington T. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 64: 884-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) followed by an additional final ultra purification using a Factor X-specific monoclonal antibody as follows. It was considered necessary to remove traces of Factor VII/VIIa, which were uniformly found in all conventionally purified Factor X preparations. The contamination was readily detected when the rate of Factor Xa generation was analyzed in the presence of relipidated recombinant human TF. Typically, 10-50 pM Factor VII was detected in 100 nM Factor X, corresponding to contamination of 1-5:10,000. When further purified, as follows, the contamination with Factor VII was <1:50,000. The pool of Factor X was bound to anti-Factor X monoclonal antibody f21-4.2 immobilized on Ultralink Hydrazide, and the column was washed extensively with 1 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0. The bound Factor X was eluted with 2 M guanidine hydrochloride and immediately dialyzed against 10 mM Tris, 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. Affinity purified Factor X was homogeneous by SDS-PAGE. Factor Xa was produced from the highly purified Factor X by limited proteolytic activation with Russel's viper venom Factor X activator. The Factor Xa product was again purified on benzamidine-Sepharose according to Krishnaswamy et al. (19Krishnaswamy S. Church W. Nesheim M. Mann K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3291-3299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initial full-length cDNA for Factor X was kindly provided by Dr. W. Church (20Messier T. Pittman D. Long G. Kaufman R.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). The coding sequence DNA was subcloned into pED4 (22Kaufman R. Davies M. Wasley L. Michnick D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4485-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and sequenced in its entirety to detect potential unrecognized mutations in the expression plasmid. The plasmid was transfected into the Chinese hamster ovary cell line DG44. Stable transfectants were selected and grown in large scale serum-free cultures as described previously in detail for the expression of the homologous protein factor VII (23Ruf W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11631-11636Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Factor X Arg196→ Gln was isolated from the serum-free culture supernatant by affinity chromatography on immobilized monoclonal antibody f21-4.2, described above. The protein obtained from this purification was homogenous when analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, but under reducing conditions the preparation showed a small amount (5-10%) of unprocessed single chain Factor X. Amino-terminal sequencing of the light chain yielded the sequence predicted from the cDNA, demonstrating proper processing of the signal peptide. The mutant Factor X, upon prolonged incubation with the enzymatic complex of Factor VIIa and TF (TF·VIIa), was not converted to Factor Xa, as determined by chromogenic substrate hydrolysis. The mutant Factor X (Arg196→ Gln) protein competitively inhibited the activation of wild-type plasma derived Factor X consistent with recognition by the enzymatically active TF·VIIa complex. Rat smooth muscle cells were isolated from thoracic aorta explants. Cells were cultivated for up to 12 passages only and were routinely grown in medium 199, 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, 2.5 μg/ml Fungizone® (Amphotericin B), and 2 mM glutamine. Human vascular smooth muscle cells were cultivated up to the third passage only and grown in medium 199, 20% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, and 20 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement. Primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells were prepared by standard methods (24Jaffe E. Nachman R. Becker C. Minick C. J. Clin.

Cells were cultivated up to passage 3 only and grown in medium 199, 20% fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, Fungizone®, 90 μg/ml heparin, and 20 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were plated into gelatinized 96-well plates at a density of 60 × 104 cells/well and cultured for 24 h to allow for maximum adherence. The cell monolayers were washed twice with PBS (0.14 M NaCl, 0.01 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.3), 5 mM EDTA at 4°C. 125I-Labeled Factor Xa (IODO-BEAD method of labeling) (1Altieri D. Edgington T. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 246-253PubMed Google Scholar) was added to cells at serial concentrations from 15 to 120 μg/ml in the presence of medium 199, 0.5% BSA at 4°C for 1 h. The cell monolayers were then washed four times in PBS, 0.2% BSA, solubilized in 0.2 N NaOH, and counted in a γ counter. For the antibody inhibition of binding experiments, a similar protocol was followed with the respective antibodies, which were added in various dilutions for 1.5 h at 4°C at the same time as the addition of the labeled Factor Xa. Endothelial and smooth muscle cell monolayers were washed, scraped into PBS, and homogenized in lysis buffer (1% Triton, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM benzamidine). Lysis continued at 4°C for 30 min, after which the lysate was clarified by centrifugation and protein concentrations were determined. 5 × sample buffer was diluted to 1 ×; samples were run on 7% SDS-PAGE gels applying 220 μg of protein/lane. The protein bands were transferred to Immobilon-P and EPR-1 protein was detected using the ECL protocol and reagents from Amersham Corp. with anti-EPR-1 mAb 9D4 at 4 μg/ml. Cell monolayers were washed once in PBS and lysed in guanidinium isothiocyanate. Total RNA was isolated using ultracentrifugation in a cesium chloride gradient. RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically and loaded on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel at 20 μg/lane. RNA was transferred to Zetaprobe membranes in 10 × SSC buffer (1.5 M NaCl, 0.1 M NaH2PO4, 0.01 M EDTA) by capillary action. RNA was UV cross-linked to the membrane. The cDNA for EPR-1 was labeled with [32P]dCTP using random priming and then purified by centrifugation through a Sephadex G-50 spin column. Blots were prehybridized for 10 min and then hybridized for 16 h at 43°C in 50% formamide, 7% SDS, 120 mM Na2HPO4, 250 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA. Blots were washed at room temperature for 20 min in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, then for 20 min at 65°C in 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and finally for 20 min at 65°C in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. The blots were analyzed by exposure to film for 24 h. Fresh human tonsils obtained at surgery were snap frozen in optimum cutting temperature medium (Miles Laboratories, Naperville, IL). 5-m sections were made on a cryostat, fixed in acetone, mounted on polylysine coated glass slides, and reacted with anti-EPR-1 mAb 9D4 diluted 1:1000. Controls included normal mouse IgG1 and monoclonal anti-human Factor VIII (Dako Corp., Carpenteria, CA) diluted 1:500. The antibodies were detected with ABC-peroxidase (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole chromagen (Dako). Hematoxylin was used as a counterstain. Smooth muscle cells were plated overnight in 96-well plates in medium with 10% serum. The cells were then washed in PBS and allowed to become quiescent in medium 199, 1% ITS for 24 h. Cells were then incubated with serum-free medium with or without reagents. After 18 h, 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added to each well. After 4 h, cells were washed twice in PBS, trypsinized, harvested, and counted in a scintillation counter. Endothelial cell proliferation assays were similar with the following exceptions. Cells were plated in 5% serum for 24 h. The following day, they were placed in medium with 1% serum, with or without reagents. Human endothelial cells were grown to confluence in T-75 cm2 tissue culture flasks, washed once in PBS, and then aliquoted in 2 × 106 cells/100-ml aliquot. Cells were incubated with anti-EPR-1 mAb B6, 2E1, or normal mouse serum for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice in PBS, 1% BSA, and resuspended in PBS, 1% BSA. The fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled second antibody was then added (1:100, v/v), and cells were covered in aluminum foil and rotated at 4°C for 30 min The cells were washed twice in PBS, 1% BSA and then resuspended in 2% paraformaldehyde, PBS. The samples were reconstituted to 1 ml with PBS, 1% BSA, and analyzed on an EPICS XL flow cytometer. Sizing gates were set to include all nucleated cells, and for each sample, at least 104 cells were analyzed. The data were analyzed by ANOVA. Differences with p < 0.05 were considered to be significant. Radiolabeled Factor Xa was reproducibly (n = 6) observed to bind to human endothelial cells in a dose-dependent, saturable, and specific manner (Fig. 1). Zero-order kinetics were achieved at 20 nM Factor Xa. The Kd for the binding was 12.5 nM, and the number of binding sites were calculated (Bmax) to be ∼220,000/endothelial cell (Fig. 1, inset). Binding of Factor Xa was also observed on smooth muscle cells with a Kd of 32 nM and 143,000 binding sites/cell (not shown). A Factor X mutant (Argl96→ Gln), which is not converted to the active serine protease Factor Xa by TF·VIIa, did not exhibit significant binding to endothelial or smooth muscle cells (Fig. 1), thereby providing supplemental data to support the specificity for Factor Xa. In order to identify the endothelial cell receptor for Factor Xa, monoclonal antibodies recognizing the Factor Xa receptor previously identified on leukocytes, namely EPR-1 (1Altieri D. Edgington T. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 246-253PubMed Google Scholar), were tested for their ability to inhibit binding of 125I-Factor Xa to endothelial cell monolayers (Fig. 2). Anti-EPR-1 monoclonal antibody B6 diminished specific binding to endothelial cells by approximately 60%, whereas characterized antibodies to annexin II (12Cesarman G. Guevara C. Hajjar K. J. Biol.

In addition, no significant inhibition of Xa binding to endothelial cells was observed with monoclonal antibody OKM1 to Mac-1, which blocks binding of Factor X to leukocyte surface Mac-1 (16Altieri D.C. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7007-7015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (not shown). To further substantiate endothelial cell surface expression, we demonstrated mAb B6 reactivity with the endothelial cell surface by flow cytometry (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Flow cytometric analysis of EPR-1 surface expression. EC were washed with PBS, 5 mM EDTA, then twice with PBS, 1% BSA, and resuspended (30 min at 4°C) in PBS, 1% BSA with either normal mouse serum or anti-EPR-1 monoclonal antibody B6. The cells were then washed twice in PBS, 1% BSA and resuspended in PBS, 1% BSA with second antibody (anti-mouse IgG) coupled with fluorescein isothiocyanate. The cells were washed, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed by flow cytometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether vascular cells can synthesize and express EPR-1, we first analyzed mRNA transcript levels for EPR-1 in endothelial and smooth muscle cells by Northern blot hybridization (Fig. 4). Three EPR-1 transcripts of approximately 1.3, 1.9, and 3.0 kilobases, in agreement with previous observations in THP-1 cells (9Altieri D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3139-3142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were identified in both cell types. These are in accord with the known differentially spliced transcripts of EPR-1 mRNA (25Altieri D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13848-13855Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis demonstrated a ∼65-kDa protein present in arterial smooth muscle cell lysates (using anti-EPR-1 mAb B6). In endothelial cells a doublet of ∼55 kDa (Fig. 5) was found.Fig. 5Western analysis of EPR-1 in human EC and smooth muscle cells. Endothelial and smooth muscle cells were washed, solubilized in homogenization (lysis) buffer, and centrifuged. Supernatants (220 μg of protein/lane) were analyzed on 7% SDS-PAGE gels. Following transfer to Immobilon-P, the membrane was reacted with anti-EPR-1 monoclonal antibody B6 at 4 μg/ml. Samples were visualized using the ECL detection kit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further substantiate the functional expression of EPR-1 by these vascular cells in vivo, immunohistochemical analysis for EPR-1 was carried out (Fig. 6). Anti-EPR antibody strongly reacted with blood vessels in frozen sections of human tonsil (Fig. 6A). Both vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells were immunoreactive. In contrast control mouse IgG1 did not react (data not shown). To explore the potential functional impact of docking of Factor Xa with vascular cell EPR-1, in vitro mitogenesis experiments were performed. These experiments were designed to exclude proliferative responses that might result from local generation of thrombin. In Fig. 7, we show a representative experiment that demonstrates the ability of Factor Xa at 50 nM, slightly in excess of the 32 nM Kd, to induce 3-fold increased proliferation of arterial smooth muscle cells relative to cells grown in medium alone in an 18-h assay. Factor Xa-induced proliferation was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody (B6) against EPR-1. Notably, addition of the thrombin inhibitor, hirudin, did not diminish Factor Xa-induced mitogenesis, thereby excluding cellular signaling by thrombin via the thrombin receptor. Also, neither very highly repurified Factor X, with Factor VII contamination at <1:50,000, nor a nonactivable mutant Factor X, neither of which bind or react with EPR-1, influenced these cell proliferation assays. To determine if the active site of Factor Xa was required for Factor Xa-induced smooth muscle cell mitogenesis, we performed proliferation assays in the presence of recombinant TAP, which blocks Xa conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, or with Factor Xa, which was inactivated at the active site by reacting with the covalent inhibitor glutamyl-glycyl-arginyl-chloromethylketone. In Fig. 8 we show that Factor Xa (50 nM) increased smooth muscle cell mitogenesis by more than 4-fold relative to untreated cells. However, Factor Xa in the presence of TAP (50 μg/ml) or glutamyl-glycyl-arginyl-chloromethylketone (50 nM) did not significantly increase smooth muscle cell mitogenesis, implying that the intact catalytic active site of Factor Xa is required for EPR-1·Xa vascular cell signaling. The macromolecular assembly of the proteins of the coagulation cascade on cell surfaces can result in a diverse set of effects including conversion of zymogens to highly specific proteases, generation of proteolytic fragments of various substrate proteins, platelet and endothelial cell activation via the thrombin receptor, and formation of the fibrin gel. Assembly of these proteases on cell surface receptors results in receptor-protease complexes with greatly enhanced function such as for assembly of the TF·VIIa initiation complex (10Ruf W. Edgington T. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex (26Le Bonniec B.F. Esmon C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Less well appreciated has been the docking of proteases on cognate cell surface receptors, a molecular mechanism well recognized for the adhesive proteins and their receptors but also evidenced by the docking of Factor X on the integrin Mac-1 (16Altieri D.C.

These receptors as well as the assembly of Factor VIIa on tissue factor not only mediate functional molecular assemblies on the cell surface but possess the capability of cellular signaling via their cytoplasmic domains (2Altieri D.

Here, we demonstrate that vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells express EPR-1, a Factor Xa receptor previously identified only on leukocytes.

In Western analysis, p21 RAS protein was decreased following treatment with the oncogenic Ha-RAS oligo in T24 cells or the c-Ki-RAS oligo in MRC-5 cells, whereas no reductions were observed in J-82 cells with either oligo. The specificity of these oligos was demonstrated in Northern analyses in which both Ha-RAS and Ki-RAS oligo treatment resulted in reduced levels of their respective mRNAs in all three cell lines, whereas the mutant Ha-RAS mRNA in T24 cells was most effectively reduced with the oncogenic Ha-RAS oligo.

This continuum provides an opportunity to examine in vivo the mechanisms by which proliferative status changes as a function of cellular differentiation. Immunohistochemical studies of normal FVB/N mice revealed that as epithelial cells complete their terminal differentiation during a 48-72-h migration up villi, there is a marked and rapid fall in the levels of two important regulators of the G1/S transition, cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 2. However, cellular levels of their partners, cdk4 and cyclin E, remain unchanged as does the level of pRB. Adult FVB/N transgenic mice were studied that contained an intestinal fatty acid binding protein gene promoter (Fabpi) linked to wild type Simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40 TAgWt) or a mutant TAg with Lys for Glu substitutions at residues 107 and 108 (SV40 TAgK107/8) that fails to bind pRB and related pocket proteins. Both transgenes are expressed only in villus enterocytes. SV40 TAgWt causes these terminally differentiated cells to re-enter the cycle. Re-entry is accompanied by a reduction in un/hypophosphorylated pRB, an induction of cyclin D1 and cdk2, but no change in cdk4, cyclin E, or E2F-1. In contrast, SV40 TAgK107/8 fails to induce re-entry and does not produce changes in un/hypophosphorylated pRB, cyclin D1, or cdk2 accumulation. These results suggest that un/hypophosphorylated pRB is an important mediator of the cell cycle arrest that normally occurs as enterocytes exit the crypt and complete their differentiation. Fabpi-directed expression of E2F-1 does not cause villus enterocytes to return to the cell cycle, alter their suppression of cyclin D1 or cdk2, or affect their state of differentiation, emphasizing the insensitivity of these cells to the effects of E2F-1. Analyses of p53−/− and p53+/+ mice containing Fabpi-SV40 TAgWt and Fabpi-SV40 TAgK107/8 established that the proliferation induced by SV40 TAgWt does not require p53 and is associated with increased (p53-independent) apoptosis. The presence of cyclin E and cdk4 in differentiating villus enterocytes emphasizes that these cells retain part of their proliferative heritage expressed 24-72 h earlier in the crypt.

The Kvβ N terminus is thought to act as a “ball peptide” to mimic the N-type inactivation characteristic of Shaker and Kv1.4 (7Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). There are differences between Kvβ-induced and N-type inactivation, however. Whereas N-type inactivation is complete, Kvβ-induced inactivation is generally partial with significant sustained currents remaining at the end of the pulse. Recent biochemical studies have shown that Kvβ1.1 interacts with the N-terminal domains of the Kv1 subfamily α subunits, Kv1.4, Kv1.5, and Shaker, but not Kv2, Kv3, or Kv4 (15Yu W. Xu J. Li M. Neuron. 1996; 16: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 16Sewing S. Roeper J. Pongs O. Neuron. 1996; 16: 455-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). A recently proposed model of Kvα-Kvβ interactions suggests that the inactivation conferred on Kv1 currents by Kvβ subunits is the result of two sequential interactions: 1) physical association of the two subunits through the interaction of the conserved Kvβ1 C terminus with conserved regions in the Kv1α N terminus, and 2) plugging of the Kv1α pore by functional interaction of the Kvβ1 N terminus with its corresponding receptor site on the Kv1α subunit (15Yu W. Xu J. Li M. Neuron. 1996; 16: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 16Sewing S. Roeper J. Pongs O. Neuron. 1996; 16: 455-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). One resulting hypothesis is that all Kv1α subunits would interact with all Kvβ1 subunits but that the functional effects on a particular Kvα might differ depending upon which Kvβ1 N terminus is present. To test this hypothesis, we have studied the interaction of two human Kvβ1 subunits with a variety of Kv channels. hKvβ1.2 and hKvβ1.3 share identical C-terminal domains but have unique, nonhomologous N termini. Our results indicate that both Kvβ1 subunits interact selectively with Kv1α subunits and produce open channel block, but hKvβ1.2 is much more potent than hKvβ1.3. In addition, hKvβ1.2 is sensitive to redox potentials, while hKvβ1.3 is not. The results are consistent with our hypothesis that functional differences originate with distinct Kvβ1 N-terminal domains. 5′-RACE Ready human heart cDNA (Clontech) was used as a template in a nested PCR with antisense oligonucleotides encoding portions of the Kvβ1 subunit C terminus near the N-terminal junction point in combination with the sense oligonucleotide anchor primer supplied with the 5′-RACE Ready cDNA. The first PCR consisted of the β subunit-specific antisense oligonucleotide (R7): 5′-AGCATAGACTTCGGCAGTATC-3′ with the 5′-RACE anchor primer. A small aliquot of the first PCR product was used as template in the second reaction with an internal β subunit-specific antisense oligonucleotide (R6): 5′-TCCAAATGTCACCCATGTTCC-3′ and the anchor primer oligonucleotide. Without purification, the products from the second PCR were cloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen). Resulting clones were sequenced with the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), and compared to hKvβ1.2, Kvβ1.1, Kvβ2, and the Drosophila Kvβ, Hk. This protocol generated several overlapping clones, the longest of which resulted in an open reading frame of 90 amino acids (hKvβ1.3). This clone was identical to hKvβ1.2 in the region between oligonucleotide R6 and the arginine (R) residue marking the junction point between the N and C termini. Since this partial clone did not possess a putative initiating methionine residue, another 5′-RACE was performed to obtain the full N-terminal coding region. The second 5′-RACE reaction was done with the antisense β1.3-5′-RACE oligonucleotide 5′-TGAGGGACTAAGGCTGCTGTC-3′ in combination with the anchor primer, and generated a clone that contained a putative initiating methionine by virtue of two upstream in-frame stop codons. To obtain the full-length hKvβ1.3 sequence from human heart, we performed reverse transcription-PCR with human atrial total RNA using oligonucleotides spanning the proposed initiating methionine of hKvβ1.3 and the C-terminal residues plus stop codon of hKvβ1.2. A single band of approximately 1.3 kilobase pairs was obtained. Sequencing of full-length hKvβ1.3 revealed a unique N terminus identical to what had been obtained from the 5′-RACE protocol and a C terminus identical to hKvβ1.2. Fragments encoding the unique N-terminal 91 amino acids of hKvβ1.3 and 79 amino acids of hKvβ1.2 were prepared by PCR and cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen) to be used as the template to prepare β subunit-specific probes for RNase protection assays. The fragments were sequenced to confirm that no mutations were introduced by PCR, and to determine the orientation in the pCRII vector. Plasmid DNA was purified on Qiagen Midi-prep plasmid purification columns and linearized with HindIII. 32P-Labeled antisense transcripts were prepared from linearized template with T7 RNA polymerase using the MAXIscript transcription kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Full-length antisense transcripts (385 bases for hKvβ1.3; 420 bases for hKvβ1.2) were gel-purified on a denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 M urea and eluted from the gel slices by overnight incubation at 37°C in the following buffer: 0.5 mM ammonium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS. Total RNA from human atrial appendage tissue, right atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle was isolated using RNA-STAT-60 (Tel-Test). The ventricular and right atrial samples were obtained in accordance with Tulane University School of Medicine Institutional guidelines from the explanted heart of a 7-year-old female patient with dilated cardiomyopathy undergoing cardiac transplant. Human atrial appendage tissue was pooled from adult patients undergoing aortocoronary bypass surgery. Total RNA from whole adult human brain was purchased from Clontech (catalog no. 64020-1). The RNase protection experiments were performed using the HybSpeed RPA kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's protocol. Ten μg of brain RNA and 50 μg of each cardiac tissue sample were incubated with 105 cpm of each β subunit probe for 20 min at 68°C. Forty μg of yeast total RNA was added to the brain RNA to keep the same total amount of RNA in each tube. As a control the probes were also incubated with 50 μg of yeast tRNA only. The hybridization mixtures were then digested for 45 min with ribonuclease T1 at 37°C. Following RNase treatment, the protected fragments were precipitated, resuspended in gel loading buffer, and electrophoresed in a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 M urea. The gel was dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film for 5 days at −80°C. Protein-protein interactions were monitored with the yeast Matchmaker two-hybrid system from Clontech. EcoRI and SalI sites were incorporated into the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, of hKvβ1.3 and each α subunit fragment by PCR for cloning in frame to the yeast shuttle vectors, pGBT9 and pGAD424. The following putative cytoplasmic N-terminal Kvα subunit fragments were made: hKv1.4-N (aa 1-305), hKv1.4ΔN2-146 (deletion of amino acids 2-146), hKv1.5-N (aa 1-248), hKv1.2-N (aa 1-124), and hKv1.1 (aa 1-168). The C terminus of hKv1.4, hKv1.4-C (aa 562-654), was also made. The full coding sequences of hKvβ1.3 (aa 1-419) and hKvβ1.2 (aa 1-408) were prepared as yeast fusion proteins. We also subcloned the Kvβ N- and C-terminal regions and tested them for interaction with Kvα subunits separately: hKvβ1.3-N (aa 1-91), hKvβ1.2 (aa 1-79), and Kvβ1-C (the C-terminal 329 amino acids of the Kvβ1 subfamily). Protein-protein interactions were tested in two host yeast strains, SFY526 and HF7C by cotransformation with pairs of pGBT9 and pGAD424 fusion constructs according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transformations in SFY526 were plated on media lacking tryptophan (trp−) and leucine (leu−), and grown for 3-4 days at 30°C. Yeast colonies were lifted to paper filters and tested for β-galactosidase activity. Colonies turning blue within 8 h were scored as positive. Transformations in HF7C were plated on media lacking trp, leu, and histidine (his). Only yeast transformed with interacting fusion proteins should grow as a result of activation of the HIS3 gene, but β-galactosidase assays were performed for confirmation of interaction. hKvβ1.3 and hKvβ1.2 were subcloned into pSP64 (Promega) for oocyte expression. The sources of the Kvα subunit constructs and preparation of cRNA are as described previously (8Majumder K. De Biasi M. Wang Z. Wible B.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The hKv1.4ΔN2-146 construct was prepared by PCR using a sense oligonucleotide incorporating a NotI site, a Kozak consensus sequence for initiation and an initiating ATG linked to 15 bases of Kv1.4 sequence encoding residues 147-151, and an antisense oligonucleotide just 3′ to the internal BstEII site. After cloning into pCRII to verify the correct construction, the NotI/BstEII fragment was subcloned into hKv1.4-A+-pCRII from which the wild-type fragment had been removed. cRNA was prepared with the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion) using either SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase after linearization of the plasmids with EcoRI (for hKvβ1.3 and hKvβ1.2) or HindIII (for hKv1.4ΔN2-146). cRNAs were dissolved in 0.1 M KCl, stored at −80°C, and diluted immediately prior to injection. Stage V-VI Xenopus oocytes were injected with 46 nl of cRNA. Whole-cell macroscopic currents were recorded with conventional two-electrode techniques as described previously (17Kirsch G.E. Drewe J.A. Hartmann H.A. Taglialatela M. De Biasi M. Brown A.M. Joho R.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 499-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Electrodes filled with 3 M KCl had resistance of approximately 0.2-0.8 megohms when measured in the bath solution containing (in mM): NaCl, 100; KCl, 5; CaCl2, 0.3; MgCl2, 2; and HEPES, 10. pH was adjusted to 7.4 with Tris base. Records were digitized at 10 KHz and filtered at 3 KHz. Experiments were conducted at room temperature (20-22°C). Macropatch currents were measured in cell-attached and inside-out configuration by using pipettes made from borosilicate glass with tip openings of ∼10-15 μm. The electrodes were connected to a patch-clamp amplifier (Axopatch1-C, Axon Instrument, Foster City, CA). The pClamp suite of programs was employed for data acquisition and analysis. The bath solution contained (in mM): KCl, 100; MgCl2, 1; and HEPES, 10. The pipette (external) solution contained (in mM): NaCl, 100; KCl, 5; CaCl2, 1.5; MgCl2, 2; and HEPES, 10. pH was titrated to 7.3 with Tris base and readjusted to this value whenever additional components were added to the solution such as glutathione (GSH, 5 mM). H2O2 (0.1%) or GSH was applied to the cytoplasmic surface of the inside-out patches by changing the perfusate. Inside-out patches were positioned in the stream of a large pipette (diameter ∼2 mm) to achieve faster solution exchange (<10 s) (18Kiehn H. Wible B. Ficker E. Taglialatela M. Brown A.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1151-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Data were low pass-filtered at 2 KHz before digitization (−3 dB, 4-pole Bessel filter). To minimize leak current and capacitive transient, on-line subtraction with a P-4 protocol was used in all recordings. Traces at each potential represent an average of 5-10 sweeps. Single channels were recorded in both cell-attached and inside-out patches. Fire-polished and Sylgard-coated electrodes, pulled from borosilicate glass on a horizontal Flaming-Brown micropipette puller, had a tip resistance of ∼10 megohms when filled with the external solution, which had the same composition as the bath solution described for the two-electrode experiments. Here the bath solution contained the following compositions (in mM): NaCl, 5; KCl, 100; CaCl2, 0.3; MgCl2, 2; and HEPES, 10. Data were digitized at 10 KHz and filtered with a 2-KHz cutoff frequency. Junction potentials were zeroed before formation of the membrane-pipette seal. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (∼20-22°C). Chemicals were purchased from Sigma. For whole-cell and macropatch recordings, the peak and steady-state currents were measured as the maximal current amplitude relative to the zero base-line level during a 100-ms pulse or as the current amplitude at the end of the pulse by Clampfit in pClamp. Single-channel data were analyzed with Fetchan in pClamp, and open and closed transitions were detected using a half-amplitude threshold criterion. Group data are presented as mean ± S.E. Student's t tests (paired or unpaired) were used to evaluate the statistical significance of differences between means. A two-tailed probability of 0.5% was taken to indicate statistical significance. For analysis of current kinetics, data points were fitted by Clampfit in pClamp. For other curve-fitting procedures, a nonlinear curve-fitting technique (Marquardt's procedure) was performed using Sigmaplot software (Jandel Scientific). The Kvβ1 subfamily of Kvβ subunits consists of three members, which result from alternative splicing of a single gene: Kvβ1.1 (7Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar), hKvβ1.2 (8Majumder K. De Biasi M. Wang Z. Wible B.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and hKvβ1.3 (11England S.K. Uebele V.N. Kodali J. Bennett P.B. Tamkun M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28531-28534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We originally cloned hKvβ1.2 from human atrium and found that it shared an identical C terminus to rat brain Kvβ1 (subsequently renamed Kvβ1.1). When this study was initiated, only two Kvβ subunits had been cloned: Kvβ1.1 and hKvβ1.2. Anticipating that there might be other members of this family, we searched for distinct Kvβ subunit family members with a common structural plan, i.e. a conserved C-terminal domain with a variable N terminus, by using 5′-RACE on human heart RNA. With this strategy we cloned hKvβ1.3 from human atrium, which proved to be identical to a recently published hKvβ1.3 clone from human ventricle (11England S.K. Uebele V.N. Kodali J. Bennett P.B. Tamkun M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28531-28534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Each Kvβ1 subunit consists of an identical C-terminal domain of 329 amino acids spliced to a unique N-terminal domain. The nonhomologous N termini of the three Kvβ1 subunits are shown in Fig. 1. We examined the expression of hKvβ1.3 in human atrium, ventricle, and brain with RNase protection assays. To distinguish the expression of hKvβ1.3 from other β subunits, a radiolabeled probe covering the unique N terminus of hKvβ1.3 was hybridized to total RNA from human atrium, right ventricle, left ventricle, and brain (Fig. 2, panel A). Compared to heart RNA, 5 times less brain total RNA was used in the assay. Specific protection of a 273-nucleotide (nt) band was observed in all tissues with the strongest signals coming from left ventricle and brain. In addition, a smaller band of approximately 250 nt was observed in all tissues. The source of this second band is unknown, but could represent a second isoform of hKvβ1.3 with sequence divergence at one or the other end of the N-terminal probe. Interestingly, the relative abundance of the 250-nt band increased in atrium such that the 273- and 250-nt bands were present in at least relatively equal proportions, whereas the 250-nt band appeared to be only a minor component in ventricle and brain. For comparison, the expression of hKvβ1.2 was also examined with an N-terminal hKvβ1.2 probe (Fig. 2, panel B). hKvβ1.2 was expressed in all tissues by virtue of the protected 237-nt band seen in all lanes. Expression was highest in ventricle and brain relative to atrium, however. These data are consistent with higher levels of hKvβ1.2 expression in human ventricle compared to atrium using Northern blotting (10England S.K. Uebele V.N. Shear H. Kodali J. Bennett P.B. Tamkun M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6309-6313Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To determine whether there is any specificity in the interaction of hKvβ1.2 and hKvβ1.3 with members of the Kv1 subfamily, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify the Kv1 α subunits to which hKvβ1.2 and hKvβ1.3 bind as well as to map the domains that mediate this interaction. As seen in Fig. 3, hKvβ1.3 interacts with the N terminus of hKv1.4 (aa 1-305) but not the C terminus (aa 562-654), as evidenced by the growth pattern on media lacking histidine. hKvβ1.3 also interacts with the truncated Kv1.4 N terminus, Kv1.4-ΔN2-146, indicating the binding site is within the 159 amino acids immediately preceding the putative S1 transmembrane domain. β-Galactosidase filter assays were also performed on these cotransformants and were positive for the expression of the lacZ reporter gene in those that grew on media lacking histidine (Table I).Table IYeast two-hybrid interactions of hKvβ1.3 and hKvβ1.2 with Kv1 family channel fragmentsGal4-BD hybridInteractionGal4-AD hybridGal4-BD hybridInteractionGal4-AD hybridhKvβ1.3+Kv1.4-NhKvβ1.2+Kv1.4-NKv1.4-N+hKvβ1.3Kv1.4-N+hKvβ1.2hKvβ1.3−Kv1.4-ChKvβ1.2−Kv1.4-CKv1.4-C−hKvβ1.3Kv1.4-C−hKvβ1.2hkvβ1.3+Kv1.4-ΔNhKvβ1.2+Kv1.4-ΔNKv1.5-N+hKvβ1.3Kv1.5-N+hKvβ1.2Kv1.2-N+hKvβ1.3Kv1.2-N+hKvβ1.2hKvβ1.3+Kv1.1-NhKvβ1.2+Kv1.1-NhKvβ1.3−HERG-NhKvβ1.2−HERG-NhKvβ1.3−hIRK-NhKvβ1.2−hIRK-NhKvβ1.3-N−Kv1.4-NhKvβ1.2-N−Kv1.4-NKv1.5-N−hKvβ1.3-NKv1.5-N−hKvβ1.2-NhKvβ1-C+Kv1.4-NKv1.5+hKvβ1-C Open table in a new tab The yeast two-hybrid assay was expanded to include the N-terminal portions of hKv1.5, hKv1.1, and hKv1.2. In these experiments, yeast fusion vectors were cotransformed into the SFY526 yeast strain, and the activation of the lacZ reporter gene was monitored. Table I shows that hKvβ1.3 interacts with the N-terminal sequences of not only Kv1.4, but also Kv1.5 (aa 1-248), Kv1.1 (aa 1-168), and Kv1.2 (aa 1-124). Thus, hKvβ1.3 is able to bind to all four Kv1 α subunits. hKvβ1.2 exhibits the same binding properties. As controls, we observed no interaction with either Kvβ subunit and the N terminus of the unrelated K+ channels, HERG (aa 1-396) and hIRK (aa 1-86). Table I also shows that it is the conserved C-terminal core of the Kvβ subunits which mediates their binding to the Kv1α subunit N terminus. Yeast fusion proteins were constructed with the hKvβ1.2 N terminus (aa 1-79), hKvβ1.3 N terminus (aa 1-91), and the conserved Kvβ C-terminal core region of 329 residues and tested for interaction with the N termini of Kv1.4 and Kv1.5. Only the Kvβ C-terminal core region interacts with the Kv1α N terminus. Since both Kvβ subunits are able to interact with each of the Kv1α N-terminal domains tested, we performed a detailed characterization of the functional effects of hKvβ1.3 and hKvβ1.2 by coexpression in Xenopus oocytes with a variety of Kvα subunits: Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.4, Kv1.5, Kv2.1, and Kv3.1. In order to compare different combinations of Kvα and β subunits, the amounts of α subunit cRNAs injected were controlled to yield steady-state currents of 4-15 μA at a potential of +60 mV when Kvβ subunits were absent. Kvβ subunits were coinjected with Kvα subunits at concentrations resulting in maximal Kvβ effects. When coinjected with hKv1.2, both β subunits introduced rapid but partial inactivation in the currents (Fig. 4A). In the presence of hKvβ1.2, Kv1.2 peak whole cell currents are reduced and inactivation is introduced at potentials above 0 mV. By contrast, at saturating concentrations of hKvβ1.3, there is a smaller reduction in peak currents and the amount of inactivation, which is only apparent at very positive potentials (>+60 mV), is less pronounced. hKvβ1.2 is a more potent modulator of Kv1.2 currents. This is further emphasized in Fig. 4B, in which I-V curves for steady-state Kv1.2 currents, plus and minus Kvβ subunits, are shown. Clearly, hKvβ1.2 reduces Kv1.2 currents over a much larger potential range than hKvβ1.3. The effects of hKvβ1.2 and hKvβ1.3 on other Kv1 channels are presented in Fig. 4C. For each Kvα-Kvβ subunit combination, the percent (%) block, defined as the difference between the peak current and the steady-state current remaining at the end of a pulse to +60 mV, is indicated. For each Kv1 channel examined (hKv1.1, hKv1.2, hKv1.4ΔN2-146, and hKv1.5), hKvβ1.2 produced significantly more block compared to hKvβ1.3. In the most dramatic example, hKvβ1.2 elicited an approximately 6-fold greater block of hKv1.2 than hKvβ1.3 did (60.7 ± 1.2% (n = 9) versus 9.8 ± 1.9% (n = 14), p < 0.01). hKvβ1.2 introduced less inactivation into Kv1.5 (52.0 ± 3.7%; n = 7), Kv1.4ΔN (48.2 ± 1.3%; n = 7), and Kv1.1 currents (31.3 ± 4.5%; n = 6). Interestingly, hKvβ1.3 produced the most marked effects on Kv1.4ΔN (% block = 32.0 ± 2.9; n = 10) and Kv1.5 (30.0 ± 4.5%; n = 7). More modest inactivation was introduced into hKv1.1 (10.6 ± 2.2%; n = 4) and hKv1.2 (see above). For Kv1.4, which exhibits intrinsic rapid inactivation, both Kvβ subunits accelerated the inactivation time course of the currents (data not shown). When intrinsic fast inactivation was removed by deletion of 146 amino acids from the N terminus (hKv1.4ΔN2-146), the channel expressed noninactivating currents that are also sensitive to Kvβ subunits. No significant changes in Kv2.1 or Kv3.1 currents were observed with either Kvβ subunit (data not shown), confirming that hKvβ1.2 and hKvβ1.3 are specific for channels of the Kv1 subfamily. To probe the mechanism by which hKvβ1.2 and hKvβ1.3 introduce inactivation and reduce peak whole-cell currents, we examined the single-channel properties of hKv1.2 with and without coexpressed Kvβ subunits. Kv1.2 currents were chosen for analysis, since the difference in the magnitude of the effects of hKvβ1.2 and hKvβ1.3 was greatest for this channel. Kv1.2 single channels recorded under different conditions from the same patches at a test potential of +70 mV, where both Kvβ subunits introduce inactivation, are presented in Fig. 5.

https://openalex.org/W2094103805,"Increase of glomerular mesangial cells (MCs) is a prominent histopathological finding in many types of glomerulonephritis. We have shown previously that expression of the zinc-finger transcription factor, early growth response gene-1 (egr-1), is closely correlated with the proliferation of cultured MCs. To elucidate whether Egr-1 is required for MC proliferation, we inhibited serum-induced Egr-1 expression by phosphothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides (ODNs). Uptake of antisense ODNs into MCs was demonstrated, and five different egr-1 antisense ODNs were tested for their impact on serum-induced egr-1 mRNA and protein levels and on MC growth. The most potent egr-1 antisense ODN inhibited serum-induced egr-1 mRNA by 68%, protein induction by 58%, and MC replication as measured by [3H]thymidine uptake and cell counts by 78 and 46%, respectively. The effects of antisense ODNs on MC growth correlated closely with their ability to inhibit Egr-1 protein. ODNs acted in a dose-dependent manner, the minimal effective concentration being 1 μM. Control ODNs had no significant effects. In addition, antisense ODNs against egr-1 potently inhibited endothelin-1-induced Egr-1 expression and MC growth. Heparin, a known inhibitor of MC growth, suppressed serum-induced [3H]thymidine uptake by 39% and egr-1 mRNA expression by 44%. We conclude that Egr-1 is an essential part of the mitogenic signal transduction cascade in cultured MCs. Increase of glomerular mesangial cells (MCs) is a prominent histopathological finding in many types of glomerulonephritis. We have shown previously that expression of the zinc-finger transcription factor, early growth response gene-1 (egr-1), is closely correlated with the proliferation of cultured MCs.

Mesangial hypercellularity is a prominent histological characteristic of many types of human glomerular kidney disease, such as IgA nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, focal glomerulosclerosis, and lupus nephritis.

Inadequate control of MC proliferation may be an initial step leading to progressive glomerular alterations and end stage renal disease.

Egr-1, also known as zif 268, Krox 24, TIS 8, and NGFI-A, is rapidly and transiently induced in response to multiple mitogenic signals (7Rupprecht H.D. Dann P. Sukhatme V.P. Sterzel R.B. Coleman D.L.

The induction of Egr-1 occurs mainly at the transcriptional level (9Rupprecht H.D. Sukhatme V.P. Rupprecht A.P. Sterzel R.B. Coleman D.L. J.

It was shown to be essential and restrictive for differentiation of myeloblastic HL60 cells along the macrophage lineage (19Nguyen H.Q. Hoffman Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 197-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Egr-1 has been found to suppress v-sis-dependent transformation of NIH 3T3 cells (20Huang R.P. Darland T. Okamura D. Mercola D. Adamson E.D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1367-1377PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Egr-1 has recently also been shown to be involved in the regulation of proliferation of T lymphocytes (21Perez-Castillo A. Pipaon C. Garcia I. Alemany S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19445-19450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and astrocytes (22Hu R.M. Levin E.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1820-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we observed a very close correlation between the stimulation of MC growth and induction of egr-1 mRNA expression by mitogens such as platelet-derived growth factor, serotonin, and arginine vasopressin. Angiotensin II, which was not mitogenic for cultured rat MCs, failed to induce egr-1 mRNA expression (7Rupprecht H.D. Dann P. Sukhatme V.P. Sterzel R.B. Coleman D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F623-F636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we report that different antisense oligonucleotides directed against egr-1 mRNA block mitogen-induced Egr-1 expression and inhibit proliferation of cultured MCs. This indicates that Egr-1 is an important component of the mitogenic signal transduction cascade in glomerular MCs. Phosphothioate-modified antisense and sense, scrambled, or mismatched control oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) were from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany) and were dissolved in H2O. ODNs were applied 16 h prior to stimulation of MCs. The sequences of the ODNs used and their positions relative to the translational AUG start site were as follows: AS1 (−118 to −99), 5′-GCGGGGTGCAGGGGCACACT-3′; S1, 5′-AGTGTGCCCCTGCACCCCGC-3′; SCR1, 5′-AGGCTGGCTGCCGGGAGCGA-3′; AS2 (−107 to −93), 5′-TTACATGCGGGGTGC3′; AS2M, 5′-TCAGATGTGGGGTCC-3′; AS3 (1Sukhatme V.P.

For visualization of cellular uptake of ODNs, AS2 was labeled with fluorescein at the 5′-end. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) was from Bachem (Heidelberg, Germany), and heparin from bovine lung was from Sigma. Glomeruli from rat kidneys were isolated and glomerular outgrowth and subsequent subculturing of MCs were performed as described previously (7Rupprecht H.D. Dann P. Sukhatme V.P. Sterzel R.B. Coleman D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F623-F636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MCs were used for experiments between passages 12 and 25. MCs were grown in 10-cm dishes until subconfluency and growth arrested for 72 h in medium containing 0.4% FCS. After adequate stimulation with various ligands, total RNA was extracted by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). Ethanol-precipitated RNA was separated on a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel. Size fractionated RNA was transferred onto Hybond nylon membranes (Amersham Intl., Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). The Northern blot was prehybridized with 5 × Denhardt's solution (2% polyvinylpyrollidone, 2% BSA, 2% Ficoll 400,000), 5 × SSC (0.75 M NaCl, 0.075 M sodium citrate), 50% formamide, 50 mM Na3PO4, 0.1% SDS, 0.25 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 65°C for 4 h. DNA hybridization probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primed labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The blots were hybridized in prehybridization solution containing 2 × 106 cpm/ml of probe at 65°C for 20 h and washed twice for 15 min with 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS and then once for 30 min with 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS. Blots were exposed to Eastman Kodak XAR-2 films. MCs were grown in 3.5-cm dishes until subconfluency, growth-arrested for 72 h in medium containing 0.4% FCS, and harvested after adequate stimulation in 100 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodiumdeoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.2, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Twenty μg of total protein samples were separated on a 7.5% denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk powder to block nonspecific binding, washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, and incubated with the primary anti-Egr-1 antibody R5232-2 (1:3000), described in detail elsewhere (5Cao X.M. Koski R.A. Gashler A. McKiernan M. Morris C.F. Gaffney R. Hay R.V. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 1931-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Egr-1 was visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Intl.). MCs were subcultured in 96-well plates in medium supplemented with 10% FCS until subconfluency and growth-arrested for 72 h in medium supplemented with 0.4% FCS. Quiescent MCs were then exposed to fresh medium containing 0.4% FCS with and without agonists or ODNs for the indicated time intervals. MCs were pulsed with 1 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]-thymidine (specific activity, 5 mCi/mmol; ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) from 0 to 24 h when FCS was the stimulus and from 24 to 48 h when ET-1 was used. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with distilled H2O, and harvested onto filter paper by an automated cell harvester (Bibby Dunn, Watertown, MA). Incorporated counts were measured by a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments). MCs were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 3 × 103 cells/well and growth arrested for 72 h in medium supplemented with 0.4% FCS. Stimulation of MCs was performed as for [3H]thymidine uptake. Cell number was determined 72 h after growth stimulation. Monolayers were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and MCs were trypsinized and transferred into 10 ml of Isoton for counting in a cell counter (Coulter, Luton, United Kingdom). Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test for unpaired values. We recently reported a very close correlation between induction of egr-1 mRNA expression and MC growth by several growth-promoting, vasoactive peptides (7Rupprecht H.D. Dann P. Sukhatme V.P. Sterzel R.B. Coleman D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F623-F636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we examined the effects of mitogenic 4% FCS and ET-1 on the expression of Egr-1 protein levels as detected by Western blot analysis. Egr-1 protein, barely detectable in control MCs, was found to be expressed in a dose-dependent manner following stimulation with FCS or ET-1 for 2 h (Fig. 1, lower panel). FCS- and ET-1-stimulated MC growth, as measured by [3H]thymidine uptake, exhibited a very similar dose dependence (Fig. 1, upper panel). To establish that Egr-1 induction is not a mere epiphenomenon but a necessary step in the mitogenic signal transduction cascade in MCs, we tried to prevent Egr-1 induction by the application of phosphothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides directed against egr-1. To demonstrate cellular uptake of oligonucleotides by cultured MCs, 5′-fluorescein-labeled antisense oligonucleotides were applied to nonconfluent MCs for 16 h (Fig. 2). In Fig. 2B, a representative field of the MC culture is shown demonstrating mainly granular cytoplasmic staining for egr-1. In some cells we also observed weak nuclear fluorescence (Fig. 2B, upper right corner). A smaller portion of MCs, as shown in a nonrepresentative field in Fig. 2C, exhibited bright nuclear staining. These findings demonstrate that MCs are capable of incorporating oligonucleotides by endocytosis and that oligonucleotides are released from granular compartments and can enter the nucleus. MCs were incubated with antisense oligonucleotide AS1 (20 μM) or sense control oligonucleotide S1 (20 μM). Northern blot analysis was performed to test whether oligonucleotides directed against egr-1 mRNA effectively suppress egr-1 transcript levels 1 h after stimulation with 4% FCS (Fig. 3). We found that AS1 inhibited serum-induced increase in egr-1 mRNA levels by 68%, whereas the sense oligonucleotide S1 had only marginal effects. To demonstrate that oligonucleotides specifically inhibit egr-1 induction, Northern blots were also probed for the expression of c-fos, another immediate early gene that has been shown to exhibit induction characteristics similar to those of egr-1 (11Lau L.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1182-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 24McMahon A.P. Champion J.E. McMahon J.A. Sukhatme V.P.

Neither AS1 nor S1 oligonucleotides influenced induction of c-fos mRNA expression significantly. Because efficacy of antisense oligonucleotides depends on elimination of the target protein, Western blot analysis was performed. Antisense oligonucleotide AS1 inhibited induction of Egr-1 protein by 58%, whereas application of sense and scrambled oligonucleotides resulted in only a slight reduction (Fig. 4A). Another antisense oligonucleotide, AS4, was less effective and inhibited serum-induced Egr-1 protein levels by 25% (Fig. 4B). Sense and scrambled control oligonucleotides were ineffective.Fig. 4Inhibition of FCS-induced Egr-1 protein expression by antisense oligonucleotides against egr-1. Quiescent MCs were preincubated for 16 h with antisense oligonucleotides or scrambled and sense control oligonucleotides at a concentration of 20 μM. Oligonucleotides used were AS1, SCR1, and S1 (A) and AS4, SCR4, and S4 (B). Total cellular protein was obtained 2 h after stimulation with FCS (4%). Twenty μg of protein per lane were size fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Egr-1 protein was detected using the ECL system (Amersham Intl.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether suppression of egr-1 mRNA and protein induction interfered with MC mitogenesis, we tested the effects of egr-1 antisense oligonucleotides on serum-induced MC proliferation measured by [3H]thymidine uptake (Fig. 5A) and cell counts (Fig. 5B). [3H]Thymidine uptake was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by antisense oligonucleotides AS1, AS2, and AS3 in a concentration range from 1 to 20 μM. The respective control oligonucleotides were without significant effects. Consistent with these results, antisense oligonucleotides AS1, AS2, and AS3 also significantly inhibited 4% FCS-induced increase in MC number (Fig. 5B). Again, control oligonucleotides were ineffective with the exception of inhibition of MC number by S3, which reached statistical significance. A summary of the effects of five different antisense oligonucleotides on 4% FCS-induced Egr-1 protein expression, [3H]thymidine uptake, and increase in MC number is given in Fig. 6. Antisense oligonucleotides that had the strongest effect on Egr-1 protein expression (upper panel) proved to be the most potent inhibitors of MC growth (78 ± 11% inhibition of [3H]thymidine uptake and 46 ± 14% inhibition of MC counts by AS1) (middle and lower panels). Likewise, egr-1 antisense oligonucleotide AS5, which did not affect serum-stimulated Egr-1 protein expression, failed to suppress MC growth.Fig. 6Effects of various antisense oligonucleotides on FCS-stimulated Egr-1 protein expression and MC growth. Quiescent MCs were incubated with the indicated antisense oligonucleotides against egr-1 (20 μM) before stimulation with FCS (4%). Total cellular protein for Western blotting was extracted 2 h after serum stimulation. Egr-1 expression was quantitated by densitometry, and the percent inhibition relative to FCS-stimulated MCs without addition of oligonucleotides is given (upper panel). [3H]Thymidine incorporation (middle panel) was measured during the time interval from 0 to 24 h after serum stimulation, and cell numbers (lower panel) were obtained 72 h after stimulation. Percent inhibition relative to serum-stimulated control values is given. n, number of independent experiments, each consisting of five samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because FCS contains a mixture of MC mitogens, we tested the effect of egr-1 antisense oligonucleotides on Egr-1 protein expression and MC growth induced by the individual mitogen, ET-1 (Fig. 7). Antisense oligonucleotides AS1, AS2, and AS4 (10 μM) markedly inhibited ET-1-mediated induction of Egr-1 protein and MC growth by ET-1. Again, AS1 proved to be the most potent antisense oligonucleotide and almost completely inhibited stimulation of MC [3H]thymidine incorporation and cell counts by ET-1. Control oligonucleotides were without significant effects (data not shown). Having shown that Egr-1 induction is essential for serum- and ET-1-induced MC mitogenesis, we investigated whether heparin (26Castellot Jr., J.J. Hoover R.L. Harper P.A. Karnovsky M.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 120: 427-435PubMed Google Scholar), an agent with reported antiproliferative effects on MCs, would inhibit egr-1 expression. Heparin led to a 39% suppression of 4% FCS-induced [3H]thymidine uptake by MCs at a concentration of 50 units/ml and concomitantly diminished egr-1 mRNA expression by 44% (Fig. 8). Induction of the transcriptional regulator Egr-1 has been demonstrated in diverse biological processes, including development (24McMahon A.P. Champion J.E. McMahon J.A. Sukhatme V.P.

Our own previous studies revealed a very close correlation between the induction of proliferation of cultured glomerular mesangial cells and the induction of egr-1 mRNA by a variety of mitogens. Second messenger systems involved in the proliferative response were also critical for up-regulation of Egr-1 (7Rupprecht H.D. Dann P. Sukhatme V.P. Sterzel R.B. Coleman D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F623-F636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rupprecht H.D. Sukhatme V.P. Lacy J. Sterzel R.B. Coleman D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F351-F360PubMed Google Scholar). Using antisense oligonucleotides directed against egr-1, we demonstrated that induction of Egr-1 is required for the growth of cultured MCs. Because unmodified oligonucleotides have a short half-life (30Fisher T.L. Terhorst T. Cao X. Wagner R.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3857-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), we used phosphorothioated oligonucleotides to increase resistance to exonucleolytic cleavage. Using fluorescein-labeled antisense oligonucleotides, we demonstrated that cultured MCs incorporate oligonucleotides from the culture medium, probably through endocytosis, as suggested by predominant granular cytoplasmic staining. However, oligonucleotides are likely to be released from granular compartments because we observed nuclear staining as well. Because no useful guidelines exist for the selection of the best target sites, we tested five different egr-1 antisense oligonucleotides directed to different regions in the egr-1 mRNA. Several reports suggested that either 5′-untranslated sequences or the AUG start for translation are the most effective target sites (31Chiang M.-Y. Chan H. Zounes M.A. Freier S.M. Lima W.F.

Biochem. 1989; 184: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), whereas in other studies, internal sites were found to be more effective (33Ricker R.D. Kaji A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Lima et al. (34Lima W.F. Monia B.P. Ecker D.J. Freier S.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12055-12061Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) suggest that single-stranded loop structures are promising target sites. Laptev et al. (35Laptev A.V. Lu Z. Colige A. Prockop D.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11033-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), however, identified effective target sites in double-stranded regions of the predicted secondary structure for the mRNA. We found that antisense oligonucleotides located at or slightly upstream of the AUG translational start site (AS1, AS2, and AS3) were more effective than those located at greater distances upstream (AS5) or downstream (AS4) of the AUG codon. The most effective antisense oligonucleotide (AS1) inhibited serum-induced egr-1 mRNA by 68% and protein by 58%. This extent of inhibition is in agreement with reports using antisense oligonucleotides against Tis 8 and collagen 1A1 (22Hu R.M. Levin E.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1820-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 35Laptev A.V. Lu Z. Colige A. Prockop D.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11033-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). One important aspect of the use of antisense oligonucleotides is specificity, because nonspecific binding of oligonucleotides to small molecules and proteins has been described (36Wagner R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). We think that the effects of egr-1 antisense oligonucleotides on MC growth are specific for several reasons: 1) inhibition of egr-1 was shown on mRNA and protein levels; 2) egr-1 mRNA induction but not the induction of another immediate early gene, c-fos, was inhibited; 3) antisense oligonucleotides acted in a dose-dependent manner; 4) sense, scrambled, and mismatched oligonucleotides served as controls for nonspecific effects and had no significant impact on egr-1 mRNA and protein levels or on MC growth; and 5) various egr-1 antisense oligonucleotides were tested and a clear correlation between their ability to inhibit Egr-1 protein and their impact on serum- and ET-1-induced MC growth was apparent. Because several different oligonucleotides were effective, it is highly unlikely that target genes other than egr-1 were responsible for the observed effects. During the course of our studies, nonspecific effects of c-myc and c-myb antisense oligonucleotides containing stretches of four consecutive guanine nucleotides on the proliferation of smooth muscle cells were reported (37Burgess T.L. Fisher E.F. Ross S.L. Bready J.V. Qian Y.X. Bayewitch L.A. Cohen A.M. Herrera C.J. Hu S.S. Kramer T.B. Lott F.D. Martin F.H. Pierce G.F. Simonet L. Farrell C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4051-4055Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides AS1 and AS2, used in our study, contained stretches of four G residues. Based on two findings, we do not believe that the antiproliferative effects of the applied antisense oligonucleotides were predominantly due to non-antisense mechanisms. First, antisense oligonucleotides not containing stretches of four consecutive G residues (AS3 and AS4) were effective in inhibiting egr-1 mRNA and Egr-1 protein as well as MC growth. Second, we used a mismatched control oligonucleotide (AS2M), in which the stretch of four G residues was left in place and the overall nucleotide composition was unchanged. AS2M did not inhibit Egr-1 protein expression (data not shown) and had no significant effects on FCS-induced [3H]thymidine uptake or cell number. Because AS1 and AS2 were slightly stronger inhibitors of MC growth than the other oligonucleotides, we cannot fully exclude the possibility of some additional nonspecific effects. Despite these limitations, our data indicate that Egr-1 is an important regulatory component of the mitogenic signal transduction cascade in MCs and that antisense oligonucleotides directed against egr-1 can be useful tools to inhibit mitogen-elicited MC proliferation in cell culture and in experimental glomerulonephritis. In agreement with the involvement of Egr-1 in proliferative cell responses, demonstrated by our data, are recent studies showing that endothelin-3-induced mitogenesis of astrocytes was inhibited by egr-1 antisense oligonucleotides (22Hu R.M. Levin E.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1820-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and that overexpression of Egr-1 in LLC-PK1 renal cells led to up-regulated transcription of the Gαi-2 proto-oncogene (15Kinane T.B. Finder J.D. Kawashima A. Brown D. Abbate M. Shang C. Fredericks W.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Sukhatme V.P. Ercolani L. J. Biol.

Cell. 1992; 3: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Additionally, Egr-1 was recently shown to delay interleukin-1-inducible tumor growth arrest of melanoma cells (39Sells S.F. Muthukumar S. Sukhatme V.P. Crist S.A. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 682-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally Egr-1 contributes to the regulation of the thymidine kinase promoter at the G0-G1 transition of the cell cycle (40Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). In addition to these studies, our data obtained in glomerular mesangial cells provide further evidence for an important role of Egr-1 in the regulation of cellular growth events. They emphasize the need to identify additional physiologically relevant target genes of this transcriptional regulator in order to elucidate signal transduction events downstream of Egr-1 induction."

https://openalex.org/W1974778979,"Apoptosis has recently been hypothesized to be the result of aberrant cell cycle control. In this study, we have investigated the role of cell cycle-regulatory elements in Fas-induced apoptosis of hematopoietic cells. When HL-60 cells were treated with anti-Fas antibody, rapid activation of growth-associated histone H1 kinase was observed without any change in cell cycle distribution. This was accompanied by the increase in <i>cdc2</i> mRNA expression and Cdc2 kinase activity. Up-regulation of <i>cdc2</i> mRNA was similarly induced in BCL-2-overexpressing HL-60 subline by anti-Fas treatment independently of the appearance of apoptotic phenotypes. Fas-induced apoptosis was completely inhibited by butyrolactone I, a specific inhibitor of Cdc2 kinase. Moreover, the same phenomenon was observed during Fas-induced but not spontaneous apoptosis of postmitotic granulocytes. Finally, we have found that ""Fas-responsive element"" was located between nucleotides −730 and −552 of the <i>cdc2</i> promoter and was responsive for transcriptional activation of the <i>cdc2</i> gene during Fas-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that aberrant activation of Cdc2 is associated with Fas-induced apoptosis of hematopoietic cells, and that the mechanism of <i>cdc2</i> transcription during Fas-induced apoptosis is different from that in normal cell cycle control."

Retinal extracts, as compared to liver, HeLa, and Drosophila embryonic cell extracts, demonstrated preferential activity for the rhodopsin promoter. A template spanning the bovine rhodopsin upstream region from −590 to +15 bp showed significant activation relative to the basal activity seen with a TATA box containing −38 to +15 bp template. Deletion analysis indicated that the region between −85 and −38 bp contained significant positive regulatory activity. This activity was not observed with HeLa extracts, suggesting that it might be retina-specific. Systematic site-directed mutagenesis of the subregion from −64 to −38 bp indicated that sequences between −60 and −58 bp and between −48 and −40 bp harbor critical elements. The former sequence is part of the binding site for the retina-specific transcription factor Nrl, which has been implicated in rhodopsin regulation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the latter sequence (−48 to −40 bp), and flanking DNA, designated Ret 4, is bound by both retina-specific and ubiquitously expressed protein factors.

The transcript that encodes apoB48 is generated by a posttranscriptional RNA editing mechanism that converts cytidine at nucleotide 6666 to uridine, and alters codon 2153 from CAA, which encodes glutamine to UAA, a premature stop codon (2Powell L.M.

A model has been proposed in which the editing enzyme recognizes the mooring sequence and edits an upstream cytidine. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the insertion of the mooring sequence into a heterologous mRNA induced editing of a cytidine 5 nucleotides upstream (9Driscoll D.M. Lakhe-Reddy S.

Estimates of the molecular size of the enzyme have ranged from 120-125 kDa (11Driscoll D.M. Casanova E. J. Biol.

The hypothesis that editing is mediated by a multiprotein complex is supported by the cDNA expression cloning of the catalytic subunit of the enzyme, a 27-kDa protein termed apobec-1 (16Teng B.B. Burant C.F. Davidson N.O. Science. 1993; 260: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar).

Science. 1993; 260: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar).The factors which complement apobec-1 were initially detected in cells that synthesize apoB but lack editing activity (16Teng B.B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21725-21734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the complementing activity is widely expressed in baboon and rabbit tissues. Although the protein that complements apobec-1 has not been characterized, this activity may represent the RNA-binding subunit of the editing enzyme which recognizes the mooring sequence and docks apobec-1 to the editing site. However, there is currently no evidence to support this model.In this study, we report the first characterization of the complementing activity in a mammalian tissue. This activity was partially purified from baboon kidney, a tissue which does not express apoB mRNA or apobec-1. Our studies suggest that the complementing activity is a protein or protein complex of 65 kDa that interacts with apobec-1 in vitro in the absence of apoB mRNA. We also show that this interaction does not require the leucine-rich region at the carboxyl terminus of apobec-1.DISCUSSIONThis study is the first characterization of the complementing activity in a mammalian system. We show that this activity in baboon kidney is a 65-kDa protein or protein complex that interacts with apobec-1 in vitro in the absence of apoB mRNA to generate a catalytically active enzyme. Although it has been difficult to purify the native editing enzyme to homogeneity in the past, this was primarily due to the lack of a high affinity purification step. Our results demonstrate that an apobec-1 affinity column can be used to isolate either a holoenzyme that contains both apobec-1 and the complementing activity, or the complementing activity alone. Apobec-1 is a 27-kDa protein that is known to dimerize, although the functional significance of this dimerization is not known (29Lau P. Zhu H.-J. Baldini A. Charnsangavej C. Chan L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8522-8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It is intriguing that the sum of the sizes of an apobec-1 dimer and the 65-kDa complementing activity is consistent with the minimal molecular size of 125 kDa that was previously reported for the editing complex in baboon (11Driscoll D.M. Casanova E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21401-21403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and rat (14Navaratnam N. Shah R. Patel D. Fay V. Scott J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1993; 90: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) enterocytes. However, our studies have not definitively established that the complementing activity is a subunit of the native editing enzyme.Our in vitro results suggest that the proteins involved in editing have a high affinity for each other, and that a significant lag period is not required for the interaction of apobec-1 and the complementing activity with each other, or with apoB mRNA. This is in contrast to studies by Smith and colleagues who suggested that a long lag period was required for the assembly of higher order complexes, or editosomes, on apoB mRNA (15Smith H.C. Kuo S.-R. Backus J.W. Harris S.G. Sparks C.E. Sparks J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1489-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 30Harris S.G. Sabio I. Mayer E. Steinberg M.F.

The hypothesis that the editing enzyme may be associated with other proteins involved in RNA processing is attractive, since several lines of indirect evidence suggest that editing may occur during the splicing and polyadenylation of apoB mRNA in vivo (2Powell L.M.

However, several laboratories were unable to demonstrate a lag period for the in vitro editing reaction with the native enzyme (11Driscoll D.M. Casanova E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21401-21403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Greeve J. Navaratnam N. Scott J.

Thromb. 1992; 12: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that the enzyme has a buoyant density of pure protein, without a nucleic acid component (12Greeve J. Navaratnam N. Scott J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3569-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may reflect differences in extract preparation, since nuclear, cytosolic S100, and whole cell extracts have all been used as sources of the editing enzyme by various laboratories.Our results also confirm previous studies which demonstrated that apobec-1 and complementing activity need to interact in a defined ratio (18MacGinnitie A.J Anant S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14768-14775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 19Giannoni F. Bonen D.K. Funahashi T. Hadjiagapiou C. Burant C.F Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5932-5936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The decrease in editing efficiency that occurs when apobec-1 or the complementing activity are in excess may be due to the formation of nonfunctional complexes between homologous species, in contrast to a functional heterologous interaction between apobec-1, the complementing activity, and apoB mRNA. The domain in apobec-1 that interacts with the complementing protein appears to be highly conserved, since rat apobec-1 can interact with the complementing activity from baboon (this study), chick (16Teng B.B. Burant C.F. Davidson N.O. Science. 1993; 260: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), and human (16Teng B.B. Burant C.F. Davidson N.O.

Innerarity T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21725-21734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although apobec-1 is not a conservative protein (33Nakamuta M. Oka K. Krushkal J. Kobayashi K. Yamamoto M. Li W.-H. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13042-13056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the leucine-rich region in the carboxyl terminus of apobec-1 is highly conserved across species, and it has been proposed that this sequence may interact with the complementing activity (16Teng B.B.

In this study, we showed that deletion of the leucine-rich region reduced editing efficiency to 0.2% of wild type levels, but that the truncated protein was still able to interact with the complementing activity in in vitro binding assay. These results suggest that the domain for interacting with the complementing activity lies within amino acids 1-170 of apobec-1, and experiments are currently in progress to test this hypothesis. Although the function of the leucine-rich region is not known, it may be involved in RNA-binding (18MacGinnitie A.J Anant S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14768-14775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) or homodimerization (29Lau P. Zhu H.-J. Baldini A. Charnsangavej C. Chan L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

An “enhancement factor” of 49 kDa has been partially purified from chick enterocytes, which stimulated editing when added to the native editing enzyme in rat enterocyte extracts in vitro (34Teng B. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21265-21272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UV cross-linking experiments have identified proteins of 60-66 kDa (p66) and 40-44 kDa (p40) in rat liver and enterocyte extracts, which bind to apoB mRNA downstream from the editing site at nucleotides 6671-6674 (15Smith H.C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5817-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, no direct functional evidence has been presented demonstrating that these binding proteins have complementing activity or that they are involved in editing. Schock et al. (36Schock D. Kuo S.-R. Steinberg M.F. Bolognino M. Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. Smith H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1097-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) identified a 240-kDa protein or protein complex in rat liver extracts that may be required for the efficient editing of apoB mRNA in vitro, but the ability of p240 to complement recombinant apobec-1 was not tested. Several candidate auxiliary proteins in extracts of McArdle cells have also been reported to bind to an apobec-1-affinity resin in two recent preliminary studies (37Yamanaka S. Poksay K.S. Balestra M.E. Innerarity T. Circulation. 1995; 92: I-165Google Scholar, 38Yang Y. Smith H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).The simplest model of the editing enzyme is that it is composed of the catalytic subunit, apobec-1, and an RNA-binding subunit that docks apobec-1 to its target cytidine in apoB mRNA. Although this model is consistent with our data that demonstrate that apobec-1 and the complementing activity interact in vitro, it has not been established that the complementing protein represents the RNA-binding subunit of the enzyme. Recombinant apobec-1 expressed in bacteria has an RNA-binding activity, with a preference for AU-rich sequences (28Navaratnam N. Bhattacharya S. Fujino T. Patel D. Jarmuz A.L. Scott J. Cell. 1995; 81: 187-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 39Anant S. MacGinnitie A.J. Davidson N.O. J. Biol.

Binding was of low specificity, which suggests that the sequence-specific recognition of apoB mRNA may require the complementing activity or the holoenzyme. The widespread expression of the complementing activity in tissues which do not synthesize apoB mRNA or apobec-1 indicates that this activity may have other cellular functions (16Teng B.B. Burant C.F. Davidson N.O. Science. 1993; 260: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 19Giannoni F. Bonen D.K. Funahashi T. Hadjiagapiou C. Burant C.F Davidson N.O. J. Biol.

Although the complementing activity may function as a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein that is also involved in the editing of other mRNAs, this activity may also represent a generic RNA-binding protein which has other roles in RNA metabolism. The complementing activity may serve as an RNA chaperone which facilitates the folding of apoB mRNA into a structure that is a more favorable substrate for the enzyme. The activity may also stimulate the binding of apobec-1 to apoB mRNA, or the dissociation of products after editing has occurred. Similar functions have been reported for the nonspecific RNA-binding proteins, HnRNP A1 and p7 nucleocapsid proteins, which facilitate hammerhead ribozyme catalysis (40Tsuchihashi Z. Khosla M.

Enterocytes in the small intestine secrete apoB48, a 242-kDa protein which is required for the absorption of dietary lipid and the assembly of chylomicrons (1Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25621-25624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). apoB48 represents the amino-terminal 2152 amino acids of apoB100, and both forms of apoB are encoded by a single gene. The transcript that encodes apoB48 is generated by a posttranscriptional RNA editing mechanism that converts cytidine at nucleotide 6666 to uridine, and alters codon 2153 from CAA, which encodes glutamine to UAA, a premature stop codon (2Powell L.M.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 77-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The editing of apoB mRNA involves a site-specific deamination reaction (5Johnson D.F. Poksay K. Innerarity T.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1204-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which is catalyzed by cellular proteins that recognize defined sequence elements flanking the edited base. Mutagenesis studies have shown that editing in vitro requires a minimal cassette of 22-26 nucleotides of apoB mRNA (6Backus J.W. Smith H.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6781-6786Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 7Backus J.W. Smith H.C. Nucleic Acid Res. 1992; 20: 6007-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 8Shah R.R.

The specificity of editing is mediated by an 11-nucleotide “mooring” sequence at nucleotides 6671-6681 downstream of the editing site (8Shah R.R. Knott T.J. Legros J.E. Navaratnam N. Greeve J.C. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16301-16304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A model has been proposed in which the editing enzyme recognizes the mooring sequence and edits an upstream cytidine. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the insertion of the mooring sequence into a heterologous mRNA induced editing of a cytidine 5 nucleotides upstream (9Driscoll D.M. Lakhe-Reddy S. Oleksa L. Martinez D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7288-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 10Backus J.W. Smith H.C. Biochem. Biophys.

The editing enzyme has been partially purified from baboon (11Driscoll D.M. Casanova E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21401-21403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rat (12Greeve J.

Estimates of the molecular size of the enzyme have ranged from 120-125 kDa (11Driscoll D.M. Casanova E. J. Biol.

The hypothesis that editing is mediated by a multiprotein complex is supported by the cDNA expression cloning of the catalytic subunit of the enzyme, a 27-kDa protein termed apobec-1 (16Teng B.B. Burant C.F. Davidson N.O. Science. 1993; 260: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar).

Science. 1993; 260: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar).The factors which complement apobec-1 were initially detected in cells that synthesize apoB but lack editing activity (16Teng B.B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21725-21734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the complementing activity is widely expressed in baboon and rabbit tissues. Although the protein that complements apobec-1 has not been characterized, this activity may represent the RNA-binding subunit of the editing enzyme which recognizes the mooring sequence and docks apobec-1 to the editing site. However, there is currently no evidence to support this model.In this study, we report the first characterization of the complementing activity in a mammalian tissue. This activity was partially purified from baboon kidney, a tissue which does not express apoB mRNA or apobec-1. Our studies suggest that the complementing activity is a protein or protein complex of 65 kDa that interacts with apobec-1 in vitro in the absence of apoB mRNA. We also show that this interaction does not require the leucine-rich region at the carboxyl terminus of apobec-1."

In this study, we have used site-directed mutagenesis of the cytoplasmic domain of TGF-α to define the structural requirements for these protein interactions. Whereas the cytoplasmic domain of TGF-α was not essential for association with transmembrane p106, deletion of the C-terminal 8 amino acids, including a cysteine pair, abolished the interaction with p86 and greatly reduced the kinase activity associated with transmembrane TGF-α. Replacement of these 2 cysteines by serines similarly reduced the association of p86 with transmembrane TGF-α. Using a combination of mutational analysis and direct microsequencing, we have determined that this cysteine pair was palmitoylated. We therefore conclude that these cysteines play a critical role in the interaction of TGF-α with associated proteins and in the function of this protein complex.

Transfer of candidate promoter domains to a heterologous (thymidine kinase) promoter conferred region-specific nicotinic responses onto that promoter. A proximal promoter domain (from −93 to −62 base pairs) was activated in copy number- and distance-dependent fashion, and thus displayed features of a promoter element. Its activation was sufficient to account for the overall positive response to nicotine.

We conclude that secretory stimulation of pheochromocytoma cells also activates the biosynthesis of the major secreted protein (chromogranin A), that the activation is transcriptional, and that a small proximal domain, including the CRE box, is, at least in part, both necessary and sufficient to account for the positive response to nicotine.

The metabolic actions of thyroid hormone (3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3)) 1The abbreviations used are: T33,5,3′-triiodothyronineCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseDRdirect repeatEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayGHgrowth hormoneIPinverted palindromeMBPmaltose-binding proteinPalpalindromeRTHresistance to thyroid hormoneRXRretinoid X receptorTKthymidine kinaseTRT3 receptor; TRv; TR variantTRET3 response element9Hninth heptad. are initiated by the binding of T3 to nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), which are members of a large family of zinc finger transcription factors that includes the receptors for all known steroids, retinoids, and vitamin D (see Refs. 1Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ribeiro R.C.J. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Annu. Rev. Med. 1995; 46: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 3Tsai M. O'Malley B.W. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2699) Google Scholar for recent reviews). Thyroid hormone receptors are transcribed by two genes, TRα and TRβ. TRβ produces two functional TRs (TRβ1 and -β2) that contain identical DNA and ligand binding domains but that possess unique amino-terminal domains (Fig. 1). TRα also produces two proteins (Fig. 1), but only one of them (TRα1) is a functional TR. The alternative splice product TR variant α 2 (TRvα2) contains a unique 122-amino acid sequence in place of the carboxyl-terminal portion of the TRα1 ligand binding domain; hence, TRvα2 is not capable of binding T3 (or any other known ligand). TRvα2 is not a functional TR but, rather, in transfection systems is an inhibitor of thyroid hormone action (4Koenig R.J. Lazar M.A. Hodin R.A. Brent G.A. Larsen P.R. Chin W.W. Moore D.D.

TRvα2 is widely expressed, and in some tissues such as brain its expression greatly exceeds that of the functional TRs, at least at the RNA level (6Lazar M.A. Hodin R.A. Darling D.S. Chin W.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Although the physiological role of TRvα2 is not known, it is plausible that it serves to dampen T3 regulation of gene expression, perhaps in a tissue- or gene-specific manner. 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine chloramphenicol acetyltransferase direct repeat electrophoretic mobility shift assay growth hormone inverted palindrome maltose-binding protein palindrome resistance to thyroid hormone retinoid X receptor thymidine kinase T3 receptor; TRv; TR variant T3 response element ninth heptad. TRs are unusual in that they regulate gene expression from a wide variety of T3 response elements (TREs). TREs usually contain two receptor binding sites (half-sites), which are related to the traditional 6-base pair sequence AGGTCA (7Brent G.A. Harney J.W. Chen Y. Warne R.L. Moore D.D. Larsen P.R. Mol.

In general the functional TRs bind to TREs with highest affinity as heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs), and it is thought that the TR·RXR heterodimer is the biological mediator of T3 action (13Yu V.C. Delsert C. Andersen B. Holloway J.M. Devary O.V. Naar A.M. Kim S.Y. Boutin J.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

RXRs are members of the steroid receptor superfamily, and they also serve as heterodimerization partners for other nuclear receptors, such as those for vitamin D and retinoic acid. It appears that multiple domains within the TR ligand binding domain may be involved in heterodimerization with RXRs (15Rosen E.D. Beninghof E.G. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11534-11541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Au-Fliegner M. Helmer E. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell.

Darling D.S. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8587-8591Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). One such domain, located at amino acids 368-374 of TRα1 (LMKVTDL), is known as the ninth heptad. Mutations in this domain can severely impair or abolish TRα1·RXR heterodimerization (16Au-Fliegner M. Helmer E. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5725-5737Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 17Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15766-15771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting that the alternative splice site for production of TRvα2 is located in the middle of the ninth heptad, between amino acids 370 and 371 (Fig. 1). Since TRvα2 is missing the second half of the ninth heptad, one would predict that it would be unable to heterodimerize with RXR. Indeed, this has been shown to be true on a palindromic or inverted palindromic TRE (19Katz D. Berrodin T.J. Lazar M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 805-814PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24278-24282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, it has been reported that TRvα2·RXR heterodimers do form on a DR TRE (20Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24278-24282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This raises questions about the role of the ninth heptad in TR·RXR heterodimerization, as well as questions about the mechanism of the dominant negative activity of TRvα2. For example, is DNA binding required for the dominant negative activity of TRvα2? Some evidence in the literature supports this (20Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24278-24282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Katz D. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20904-20910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but other data do not (22Liu R.-T. Suzuki S. Miyamoto T. Takeda T. Ozata M. DeGroot L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 86-95PubMed Google Scholar). If DNA binding is required, will the TRvα2 dominant negative activity be confined to those response elements that support TRvα2 heterodimerization with RXR? The goal of these studies was to further evaluate the role of the ninth heptad in TR·RXR heterodimerization, as well as the role of DNA binding in the dominant negative activity of TRvα2. Furthermore, it is clear that the dominant negative activity of TRvα2 is weak relative to that of mutant TRs that are naturally found in patients with resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) (23Chatterjee V.K.K.

Trichloroacetic acid precipitable-protein counts per minute were determined, and the products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Receptors also were produced in Escherichia coli using the vector pMalc2 (New England Biolabs) as described previously (26Subauste J.S. Katz R.W. Koenig R.J. J. Biol.

This vector produces a fusion protein of maltose-binding protein (MBP), followed by a cleavage site for factor Xa and the receptor of interest. The fusion proteins were purified by amylose affinity chromatography and cleaved with factor Xa. The assay was performed as described previously (8Katz R.W. Koenig R.J. J. Biol.

In brief, 4,000 cpm of [3H]leucine-labeled receptors (or, where indicated, 5-10 ng of E. coli-derived receptors) were incubated with 20,000 cpm of Klenow filled-in 32P-labeled DNA for 40 min at room temperature. In some experiments reticulocyte lysate-translated receptors were incubated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (or alkaline phosphatase that had been inactivated by heating at 100°C for 10 min) as described (29Katz D. Reginato M.J. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2341-2348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) prior to the EMSA incubation. The incubation mixtures were electrophoresed through 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by autoradiography.

Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar) or the Promega Altered Sites kit. Mutant products were sequenced to confirm the mutations and to exclude errors. The MBP-RXRα fusion protein was produced in E. coli and adsorbed onto a series of 1-ml amylose resin columns. MBP was similarly adsorbed as a control. The columns were washed with 20 ml of EMSA incubation buffer, and then 1,200,000 cpm of [35S]methionine-labeled TRs were loaded onto the columns. After a 30-min incubation at 4°C, the columns were washed with another 20 ml of EMSA incubation buffer. Radiolabeled TRs that remained bound were eluted with 10 mM maltose and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of aliquots confirmed that the eluted TRs were of the appropriate sizes. JEG-3 human choriocarcinoma cells were maintained and transfected as described previously (31O'Donnell A.L. Koenig R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Receptors were expressed from CDM (32Koenig R.J. Warne R.L. Brent G.A. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Moore D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1989; 339: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) plasmid. Transfections included (as indicated) 10-100 ng of TRα1 vector, 1-3 μg of TRvα2 vector, and 3 μg of RXR vector. Empty vector was added to maintain 6 μg of expression plasmid/60-mm Petri dish transfection. Transfections also included 4 μg of a T3-responsive chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter vector derived from pUTKAT3 (34Moore D.D. Prost E. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The CAT vectors had single copies of the TREs listed in Table I placed 5′ to the basal thymidine kinase promoter. Transfection efficiency was determined using 1 μg of pTKGH/Petri dish, in which the basal thymidine kinase promoter (without TRE) drives expression of human growth hormone (GH). CAT and GH were assayed as described previously (31O'Donnell A.L. Koenig R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). T3 inductions were calculated as (CAT/GH for cells transfected with T3)/(CAT/GH for cells transfected without T3). JEG-3 cells were transfected in 100-mm Petri dishes with plasmid amounts scaled accordingly. Two days after transfection the cells were placed in methionine-free media with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and [35S]methionine, 0.15 mCi/ml (4 ml/Petri dish). The cells were cultured for 4 h. Cell harvesting and immunoprecipitation, using a rabbit antiserum directed against the unique carboxyl terminus of TRvα2, were performed as described (29Katz D. Reginato M.J. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2341-2348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that incubation with the antibody was for 2 h, and the immunoprecipitates were isolated using protein A-agarose. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantified on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Since TRvα2 lacks one-half of the ninth heptad, it was not expected to be able to heterodimerize with RXR on DNA. Although this expectation was confirmed for a palindromic or inverted palindromic TRE (19Katz D. Berrodin T.J. Lazar M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 805-814PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24278-24282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was unexpectedly shown that such heterodimers do form on a DR TRE (20Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24278-24282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We tested TRvα2·RXR heterodimer formation on four DR TREs (Table I), which differ only in whether the half-sites contain the traditional hexamer AGGTCA (7Brent G.A. Harney J.W. Chen Y. Warne R.L. Moore D.D. Larsen P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1996-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) or the extended octamer TR binding site TAAGGTCA (8Katz R.W. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19392-19397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, TRvα2·RXR heterodimers form on the TRE in which both half-sites are octamers (8DR; lane 6), but DNA binding is not detectable when both half-sites are hexamers (6DR; lane 24). Heterodimer formation is barely detectable when just the 5′-half-site is an octamer (86DR; Fig. 2, lane 12) and is somewhat more prominent when just the 3′-half-site is an octamer (68DR; Fig. 2, lane 18). Similar results were obtained using proteins produced in E. coli, except that binding of TRvα2·RXR heterodimers to 8DR was as strong as the binding of TRα1·RXR heterodimers, and TRvα2 monomer binding to DNA was detectable (data not shown). The data indicate that TRvα2·RXR heterodimers can form on DR TREs, but this requires at least one half-site to be an octamer (preferably the 3′-half-site), and strong binding requires both sites to be octamers. The fact that TRvα2·RXR heterodimers can form on some DR TREs but not on Pal or IP TREs suggests that the importance of the ninth heptad for heterodimerization is not the same for all TREs. To address this further, several mutant TR proteins were produced, as shown schematically in Fig. 3. The full ninth heptad was restored in TRvα2 by inserting TRα1 amino acids 371-378 immediately following TRvα2 amino acid 370. This construct is denoted α2+9H. To control for the spacing effect of this insertion, the construct α2+Ala was made in which a series of alanines was placed immediately after TRvα2 amino acid 370. Finally, a substitution mutation was made in TRα1, in which the ninth heptad amino acids 371-376 were replaced by TRvα2 amino acids 371-376 (α1−9H). These mutant proteins were produced in reticulocyte lysate and were then used in a series of EMSAs with TREs in which both half-sites are octamers but the orientations of the half-sites differ (8DR, 8Pal, and 8IP). The results are shown in Fig. 4. As expected, TRα1 forms strong monomer and heterodimer bands on all three TREs (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6). TRvα2 does not form monomer bands and forms a heterodimer only on 8DR (Fig. 4, lanes 7 and 8), suggesting that the full ninth heptad is not critical for heterodimerization on 8DR but is critical on 8Pal and 8IP. This is supported by α2+9H, which forms a strong heterodimer band on all three TREs (Fig. 4, lanes 9 and 10). The need for the specific ninth heptad sequences for heterodimer formation on 8Pal is confirmed by the minimal heterodimerization of α2+Ala (Fig. 4B, lanes 13 and 14). Most surprisingly, however, α2+Ala heterodimerizes strongly on 8IP (Fig. 4C, lanes 13 and 14). This suggests that on 8IP the ninth heptad serves a critical role, but the effect is amino acid sequence independent; therefore, this region is presumably serving as a nonspecific spacer to separate inhibitory sequences in the unique TRvα2 carboxyl terminus from other critical sequences in the protein. The varied importance of the ninth heptad in TRvα2 heterodimerization was consistent with the findings using the TRα1 mutant α1−9H, which heterodimerizes well on 8DR and 8IP but not on 8Pal (Fig. 4C, lanes 11 and 12). Results essentially identical to those of Fig. 4 were obtained using E. coli-derived proteins, except that TRvα2 monomer binding to DNA also was detected (data not shown, but see Fig. 6 for E. coli-derived TRvα2 monomer binding to 8IP).Fig. 6Effect of TRvα2 phosphorylation on binding to 8IP DNA. TRvα2, α2+9H, and α2+Ala were produced in E. coli or reticulocyte lysate (R.L.). The reticulocyte lysate-translated material was, where indicated, pretreated with active alkaline phosphatase (CIP: +) or boiled alkaline phosphatase (CIP: Δ) as a control. These proteins were incubated without or with E. coli-derived RXR as well as radiolabeled 8IP DNA, and protein-DNA complexes were resolved by EMSA.

Furthermore, α2+9H monomer binding to DNA is detectable (Fig. 4B, lane 9), whereas wild type TRvα2 monomer binding is not (Fig. 4B, lane 7). The enhanced α2+9H monomer binding to DNA is more dramatic when using E. coli-derived protein (data not shown, but see Fig. 6 for E. coli-derived α2+9H monomer binding to 8IP). Since the ninth heptad is not thought to contact DNA directly, these results suggest an indirect effect of this region to enhance TR monomer-DNA interactions. Because the ability of TRvα2 and its mutant versions to heterodimerize with RXR differed on the different TREs, we wished to determine whether such heterodimers can form in the absence of DNA. To accomplish this, a MBP-RXR fusion protein was produced in E. coli and adsorbed to an amylose affinity column (MBP was adsorbed as a control). After extensive washing, reticulocyte lysate-translated, radiolabeled TRα1, TRvα2, α2+9H, or α2+Ala was applied to the columns. After further extensive washing, the bound radiolabeled proteins were eluted, and the radioactivity was determined. The results are presented in Fig. 5. TRα1·RXR heterodimers formed easily under these conditions. TRvα2·RXR heterodimers were detectable, but only at ∼6% of the level seen for TRα1·RXR. Heterodimerization was largely restored for α2+9H but not for α2+Ala. The importance of the ninth heptad was confirmed by α1−9H, which heterodimerized poorly relative to wild type TRα1. Thus, heterodimerization in the absence of DNA most closely resembles that seen on the 8Pal TRE. It has been shown that TRvα2 is phosphorylated in its unique carboxyl terminus when translated in reticulocyte lysate, and that this phosphorylation underlies the deficient TRvα2 monomer-TRE binding (29Katz D. Reginato M.J. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2341-2348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A series of EMSAs was performed to determine whether phosphorylation influences the ability of the TRvα2 proteins to heterodimerize. Specifically, we wished to know whether the unexpected ability of reticulocyte lysate-translated α2+Ala to heterodimerize with RXR on 8IP was due to moving the phosphorylated residues away from other critical regions of the TRvα2 protein. The strategy, modeled after that of Katz et al. (29Katz D. Reginato M.J. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2341-2348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was to produce TRvα2 proteins in E. coli, in which case they are not phosphorylated, or to treat the reticulocyte lysate-translated proteins with alkaline phosphatase. If α2+Ala promotes heterodimerization on 8IP by sterically separating the phosphorylated residues from other critical residues, then one would expect that heterodimerization also would be observed with wild type, nonphosphorylated TRvα2 produced in E. coli or phosphatase-treated TRvα2 from reticulocyte lysate. Fig. 6 shows, however, that E. coli-produced TRvα2 does not form detectable heterodimers with RXR on 8IP (lane 4), although heterodimers are seen with α2+9H (lane 12) and α2+Ala (lane 20). Furthermore, heterodimerization with RXR is not induced by dephosphorylation of reticulocyte lysate-translated TRvα2 (lane 10). As expected, however, dephosphorylation does promote binding of monomers of TRvα2 (Fig. 6, lane 9 versus lanes 7 and 5), α2+9H (Fig. 6, lane 17 versus lanes 15 and 13), and α2+Ala (Fig. 6, lane 25 versus lanes 23 and 21), as well as a small amount of homodimer binding (Fig. 6, lanes 9, 17, and 25). The overall conclusion is that the ability of α2+Ala to restore heterodimerization on 8IP is not related to the TRvα2 phosphorylation state. To assess the role of TRvα2·RXR heterodimerization in the dominant negative activity of TRvα2, we first compared this activity on 8DR, 86DR, 68DR, and 6DR by transient transfection (Fig. 7). The percentages of repression of T3 induction by TRvα2 on these response elements were: 8DR, 38 ± 3.9%; 86DR, 30 ± 7.6%; 68DR, 21 ± 3.0%; and 6DR, 29 ± 5.2%. These data roughly parallel the relative binding of TRvα2·RXR to these TREs (Fig. 2) in the sense that binding to 8DR was the strongest. However, the difference in dominant negative activity between 8DR and the other elements was not statistically significant (Dunnett's test). Thus, the lack of a strict parallel between the EMSA and transfection data might suggest that heterodimerization and DNA binding is not critical for the dominant negative activity or that the EMSAs do not reflect the DNA binding within the cell. To help address this question, a TRvα2 protein was produced with a cysteine to alanine mutation within the first zinc finger (C56A). This mutation prevents formation of the zinc finger and abolishes DNA binding of TRvα2·RXR heterodimers on 8DR (Fig. 8). In a transfection system, TRvα2 C56A no longer possesses dominant negative activity on 8DR, 8Pal, or 8IP (Fig. 9). To confirm that this mutant protein is expressed, transfected cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and immunoprecipitation was performed using a TRvα2-specific antibody. The results, quantified by PhosphorImager analysis, indicate that C56A is expressed at 65% of the level of TRvα2 (Fig. 10). It is unlikely that this modest difference in expression could account for the complete loss of dominant negative activity. This suggests that the dominant negative activity of TRvα2 requires DNA binding.Fig. 9Dominant negative activity of TRvα2 versus zinc finger mutant C56A. JEG-3 cells were transfected with a TRα1 expression vector, a T3-responsive CAT reporter (8DR, 8Pal, or 8IP), pTKGH to control for transfection efficiency, and TRvα2, TRvα2 C56A, or empty vector. Results are the mean ± S.E. (bars) for four to six independent transfections per TRE.

https://openalex.org/W2085556560,"It has been believed that when GroEL binds to GroES its apical domain moves upward and outward. To inhibit this “opening” movement, its equatorial and apical domains were cross-linked through a disulfide bond between mutationally introduced cysteine residues at the positions of Asp-83 and Lys-327. To avoid possible undesired cross-linking, we at first prepared a mutant GroEL (GroELNC; Cys-138 → Ser, Cys-458 → Ser, Cys-519 → Ser) in which all cysteine residues in wild-type GroEL were replaced by serine residues. GroELNC was fully functional as a chaperonin. We then introduced the above two point mutations into GroELNC to generate a mutant (GroELAEX; Cys-138 → Ser, Cys-458 → Ser, Cys-519 → Ser and Asp-83 → Cys, Lys-327 → Cys). Oxidized GroELAEX, which is locked in a “closed” conformation by an interdomain disulfide bond, can bind 6-7 mol of ATP, which remain bound without hydrolysis. This ATP-bound, oxidized GroELAEX can bind the stably nonnative substrate protein isopropylmalate dehydrogenase, whereas the nucleotide-free oxidized GroELAEX binds it with a weaker affinity. However, oxidized GroELAEX fails to process further reaction steps such as ATP hydrolysis, binding of GroES, dissociation of substrate protein from GroEL, and facilitating protein folding. When disulfide bonds in oxidized GroELAEX are reduced, GroELAEX exerts the ability to process all the reactions just as GroELNC and wild-type GroEL. Indications from these results are: hydrolysis of ATP may require opening movement of the apical domain; GroES binds to an open form of GroEL; and substrate polypeptide is released from GroEL coupled with either ATP hydrolysis or opening movement of the apical domain.

https://openalex.org/W1984986660,"Abstract Copper incorporation (64Cu(II)) into Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) was studied in human lymphoblasts. Rapid incorporation of copper with a proportionate increase in SOD activity was detected. No copper incorporation or SOD activation was detected when 64Cu(II) was added to cell cytosols rather than to intact cells. Thus, incorporation of 64Cu was not due to isotopic exchange. Cycloheximide had no significant effect on copper incorporation and activation of SOD when the data were corrected for total cell copper. Thus, the data were consistent with copper incorporation into a preexisting apoSOD pool rather than newly synthesized SOD, and no new SOD synthesis was detected over a 15-h incubation period. The size of the apoSOD pool was estimated to be ≈35% of the total SOD in lymphoblasts. When cells were preincubated for 15 h with excess copper (15 μM Cu(II)), the size of the apo pool markedly decreased but was not eliminated, suggesting that the apoSOD was not due to copper deficiency. These experiments also indicated that newly arrived copper was preferentially incorporated into the apoSOD pool, while the function(s) of an apoSOD pool remains unknown. Copper binding to apoSOD may provide a rapid protective response against copper toxicity."

This complex process involves the coordinated actions of more than 20 polypeptides. To facilitate biochemical studies of NER in yeast, we have established a simple protocol for preparing whole cell extracts which perform NER in vitro. As expected, this assay of in vitro repair was dependent on the products of RAD genes such as RAD14, RAD4, and RAD2. Interestingly, it was also dependent upon proteins encoded by the RAD7, RAD16, and RAD23 genes whose precise roles in NER are uncertain, but not the RAD26 gene whose product is believed to participate in coupling NER to transcription. Replication protein A (RPA/Rpa), known to be required for NER in human cell extracts, was also shown by antibody inhibition and immunodepletion experiments to be required for NER in our yeast cell extracts. Moreover, yeast cells with temperature-sensitive mutations in the RFA2 gene, which encodes the 34-kDa subunit of Rpa, had increased sensitivity to UV and yielded extracts defective in NER in vitro.

NER involves the concerted actions of several different enzymatic activities and can be arbitrarily divided into the following steps: damage recognition, incision and excision of the lesion and its flanking DNA, and repair DNA synthesis to fill in the resulting single-stranded gap. Many of the proteins encoded by XP genes and their evolutionarily conserved RAD gene homologs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are now known to function in the early steps of excision repair, participating in the removal of DNA lesions prior to the repair DNA synthesis step. Some of the proteins involved in the repair DNA synthesis step of excision repair also function in the replication of cellular DNA and include proteins such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (6Shivji M.K.K.

Biochemical analyses of NER have depended largely on the availability of cell-free extracts that can support excision repair. The in vitro system developed by Wood and his colleagues (41Wood R.D. Robins P. Lindahl T. Cell. 1988; 53: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) has proven to be instrumental in the dissection of the NER pathway in human cells. On the other hand, understanding excision repair in S. cerevisiae has relied mainly on the genetic analyses of rad mutants. The potential for biochemical analysis of NER in yeast cells has not yet been fully realized owing in part to the lack of a simple in vitro repair system. The only existing cell-free system from S. cerevisiae, that described by Wang et al. (42Wang Z. Wu X. Friedberg E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4907-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 43Wang Z. Buratowski S. Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Kornberg R.D. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2288-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), involves the preparation of separate nuclear and whole cell extracts. Hence, it seemed desirable to develop a simple in vitro preparation from yeast cells capable of NER and applicable for use with a variety of different yeast strains. Here we report the development of such a system using a whole cell extract prepared from S. cerevisiae. We have utilized this in vitro system to demonstrate a requirement for the products of the genes RAD7, RAD16, and RAD23. Furthermore, we have also exploited this in vitro repair system to assess the role of yeast Rpa in NER. In addition, yeast strains with point mutations in the RFA2 gene were constructed and characterized. Taken together, our biochemical and genetic results indicate that, as in human cells, Rpa plays an important role in the process of NER in S. cerevisiae cells. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were BJ2168 (from Dr. J. Segall, University of Toronto), LP2899, a gift of Dr. L. Prakash, and rad mutant strains, MGSC131 (rad4Δ::URA3), MGSC139 (rad14Δ::LEU2), MGSC104 (rad7Δ::LEU2), W303236 (rad16Δ::URA3), MGSC101 (rad23Δ::URA3), MGSC102 (rad26Δ::HIS3) and their isogenic parental strain W303-1B (44Verhage R.A. van Gool A.J. de Groot N.

Brouwer, Leiden University), and EMY75 (rad2Δ::URA3 from L. Prakash). The procedure for the preparation of NER-proficient yeast extract was a modification of protocols originally intended for transcription studies (45Schultz M.C. Choe S.Y. Reeder R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Yeast cultures were grown at 27°C in complete medium (YEPD: 1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-Peptone, 2% glucose) with vigorous shaking. Cells were harvested at an OD600 of 2 by first chilling in ice water and then centrifuging at 4000 rpm for 4 min in a Sorval H-6000A rotor. The cells were then washed once in ice-cold water and once in extraction buffer (0.2 M Tris, pH 7.5, 0.39 M (NH4)2SO4, 10 mM MgSO4, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol) containing various protease inhibitors (phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM; benzamidine hydrochloride, 2 mM; pepstatin A, 3.5 μg/ml; leupeptin, 1 μg/ml; bestatin, 0.35 μg/ml; and aprotinin, 10 μg/ml). The drained cell pellet was scraped into a syringe, then extruded directly into liquid nitrogen and stored at −70°C. Frozen cells were broken by manual grinding under liquid nitrogen using a ceramic mortar and pestle. Grinding continued until the material was reduced to powder. After grinding, the frozen powder of broken cells was mixed with 1 volume of cold extraction buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and allowed to thaw at 4°C. The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 2 h at 4°C. The clear supernatant was recovered and (NH4)2SO4 added to 2.94 M by the addition of 337 mg of solid (NH4)2SO4/ml of lysate over the course of 1 h. The suspension was stirred for another 30 min, and the precipitated protein pelleted by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in a small volume (approximately 50 μl/g of cells) of dialysis buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mM MgSO4, 10 mM EGTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol) plus protease inhibitors. The sample was then dialyzed against the same buffer plus 1 mM phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride for 12-16 h. The dialysate was centrifuged to remove precipitated protein and the resulting supernatant was collected and stored at −70°C until use. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad colorimetric assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. DNA from plasmids pUC18 (2.7 kilobase pairs) and pGEM-3Zf(+) (3.2 kilobase pairs) was isolated by alkaline lysis and CsCl-ethidium bromide equilibrium centrifugation. The pUC18 DNA was treated with N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene (AAAF) and repurified on a 5-20% sucrose gradient as described by Wang et al. (42Wang Z. Wu X. Friedberg E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4907-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained 300 ng of AAAF-treated pUC18 and 300 ng of control pGEM-3Zf(+) DNA, 45 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 70 mM KCl, 7.4 mM MgCl2, 0.9 mM dithiothreitol, 0.4 mM EDTA, 20 μM each of dGTP, dATP, TTP, 8 μM dCTP, 2 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 2 mM ATP, 40 mM disodium phosphocreatine, 2.5 μg of creatine kinase, 3.4% glycerol, 18 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 250 μg of protein as yeast whole cell extract (typically 6-8 μl). Reactions were incubated at 28°C for 2 h. Plasmid DNA was purified from the reaction mixtures, linearized by digestion with HindIII, analyzed on a 1% agarose gel, and autoradiographed as described by Wang et al. (42Wang Z. Wu X. Friedberg E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4907-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To quantitate the extent of repair synthesis, dried gels were exposed to either storage Phosphor screens or autoradiography films. The amount of radioactivity in each band was quantitated by phosphoimaging analysis or densitometry and comparison to known radioactivity standards. For the antibody inhibition experiments shown in Fig. 4, the indicated amount of preimmune or anti-yeast Rpa antiserum was preincubated with the cell extracts for 15 min at 28°C before addition of reaction buffer and plasmid DNAs. The polyclonal antibodies against yeast Rpa used in these studies were raised in a rabbit by injection of recombinant yeast Rpa protein. The depletion of yeast Rpa from whole cell extracts was effected using an immunodepletion procedure described by Adachi and Laemmli (46Adachi Y. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4153-4164Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphate-buffered saline-washed Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B matrix was incubated with equal amounts of preimmune or anti-yeast Rpa serum at room temperature for 2 h. The matrices were washed and incubated with 4 volumes of yeast cell extract in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system (46Adachi Y. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4153-4164Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) at 4°C for 1 h. The Sepharose was then briefly pelleted in an Eppendorf tube and the supernatant was collected as the depleted extract. As estimated by a Western blot, more than 90% of the yeast Rpa protein in the extract was removed (data not shown). Plasmids pJM124, pJM223, and pJM329 contain, respectively, the RFA1 gene, RFA2 cDNA, and the RFA3 gene under the control of the phage T7 promoter of plasmid pET11a (47Studier F. Rosenberg H. Dunn J. Dubendorff J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) and are described in Ref. 19Brill S.J. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar. The T7 promoter, gene, and transcription terminator of these plasmids can be moved as a BamHI/BglII cassette. The 1.2-kilobase pair BamHI/BglII cassette of pJM223 was inserted into the BamHI site of pJM329 to create pJM332. The resulting 1.9-kilobase pair BamHI/BglII cassette of pJM332 was then inserted into the BglII site of pJM124 to create pJM126 containing the three RFA genes on a single plasmid, each with its own T7 promoter. pJM126 was transformed into BL21(DE3) for protein expression. BL21(DE3) cells containing pJM126 were grown in LB containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin at 22-37°C to an OD of 0.5-0.8. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was then added to 0.4 mM and the induction continued for 3 h. Cells were harvested and the bacterial pellet resuspended in one-tenth volume of A buffer (18Brill S.J. Stillman B. Nature. 1989; 342: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) with 50 mM NaCl and 1 mg/ml lysozyme. Following incubation at 4°C for 15 min, Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%. The lysate was subjected to a total of 3 freeze-thaw cycles using dry ice/ethanol and swirling in a 37°C bath. Chromosomal DNA was dispersed by sonication (3 × 1 min) in volumes of approximately 20 ml on ice. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. The extract produced from 1 liter of culture was loaded on a 100-ml phosphocellulose column equilibrated in buffer A with 50 mM NaCl and the column washed with 300 ml of buffer A with 50 mM NaCl. Escherichia coli SSB is found in the flow-through of this column. Rpa was eluted with a 600-ml gradient from 50 to 800 mM NaCl in buffer A and assayed for unwinding activity as described previously (48Tsurimoto T. Fairman M.P. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3839-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Rpa elutes at approximately 200 mM NaCl from this column. Active fractions were pooled, NaCl added to 500 mM, and the sample loaded onto a 5-ml ssDNA-cellulose column equilibrated in buffer A with 500 mM NaCl. This column was washed with 15 ml of buffer A with 500 mM NaCl, 25 ml of buffer A with 750 mM NaCl, and 25 ml of buffer A with 1.5 M NaCl and 50% ethylene glycol. The protein peak from this last step contains approximately 1 mg of recombinant Rpa from a 1-liter culture. Approximately 50 μg of recombinant Rpa was then loaded onto a 5-ml 15-35% glycerol gradient in buffer A containing 100 mM NaCl. A parallel gradient contained a similar amount of Rpa purified from yeast. The gradients were centrifuged in an SW50.1 rotor at 49,000 rpm for 21 h. Fractions (130 μl) were collected from both gradients, 8-μl aliquots assayed for unwinding activity and 14-μl aliquots subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. The unwinding assay was performed essentially as described by Tsurimoto et al. (48Tsurimoto T. Fairman M.P. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3839-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A final reaction volume of 20 μl containing 30 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 7 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 4 mM ATP, 40 mM creatine phosphate, 0.4 μg of creatine phosphokinase, 0.4 μg of bovine serum albumin, 0.08 μg of calf thymus topoisomerase I, 0.3 μg of pSV011 plasmid DNA, 0.5 μg of SV40 T antigen, and the indicated amounts of Rpa was assembled on ice and then placed at 37°C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by placing it on ice. Four μl of a solution of 4% SDS, 40 mM EDTA, and 6 mg/ml Pronase was added and the tubes placed at 37°C for 30 min. The reaction products were then directly resolved by electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed. For experiments employing recombinant Rpa in the in vitro assays of nucleotide excision repair, recombinant Rpa protein was purified through an Affi-Gel Blue column, an hydroxylapatite column, and an ssDNA-cellulose column as described for the purification of human RPA by Henricksen et al. (49Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Details concerning the identification and characterization of rfa2 mutants will be presented elsewhere. 2H. S. Maniar and S. J. Brill, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, the entire RFA2 gene on plasmid pJM215 (19Brill S.J. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) was subjected to 35 cycles of amplification with Taq DNA polymerase in the presence of 1 mM MnCl2 and the universal forward and reverse sequencing primers. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with BamHI and SalI and ligated into the yeast centromeric plasmid pRS415. This library of mutagenized RFA2 plasmid DNA was amplified in bacteria and introduced into strain SBY105 which carries a deletion of the RFA2 gene but is kept alive by plasmid pJM218 (19Brill S.J. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) carrying the RFA2 cloned into the yeast centromeric plasmid YCp50. Transformants were replica-plated to plates containing the drug 5-fluoroorotic acid and placed at 37°C and 25°C. Strains showing no growth after 2 days at 37°C were identified and the RFA2 plasmid rescued from the corresponding 25°C colony by transformation into E. coli. Mutant plasmid DNA was then reintroduced into strain SBY105 (19Brill S.J. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) to confirm that the temperature-sensitive growth defect was plasmid-dependent. Strains passing this test were tested for loss of viability in a liquid culture at 37°C. Typically these ts strains showed 10-20% viability following 4 h exposure to 37°C. Cells were grown at 25°C overnight in YPD medium, diluted in sterile water, and plated in duplicate on YPD plates and immediately irradiated with a Stratalinker UV cross-linker (Stratagene). The plates were then incubated at 25°C for 3 days and surviving colonies were counted. The availability of human cell-free extracts capable of performing nucleotide excision repair (41Wood R.D. Robins P. Lindahl T. Cell. 1988; 53: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) has permitted major advances in our understanding of this pathway of DNA repair. The genetic analysis of the sensitivity to UV of S. cerevisiae has also provided an excellent approach for studying NER in eukaryotes (1Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). However, the full potential of using S. cerevisiae and its many mutant rad strains in studies of NER has not been fully exploited. Biochemical analyses of NER in yeast may have been hampered by the lack of a simple method of preparing yeast extracts capable of repair in vitro. As the human extract system was developed originally for studying in vitro transcription, we tested whether yeast extracts capable of in vitro transcription (45Schultz M.C. Choe S.Y. Reeder R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) would also perform nucleotide excision repair. In this protocol, yeast cells were quickly frozen and then ground in liquid nitrogen. After addition of minimal amounts of buffer, the thawed extract was then clarified by a centrifugation step, further concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, solubilized, and dialyzed (see “Experimental Procedures”). Nucleotide excision repair in the yeast cell extracts was monitored by the incorporation of radiolabeled nucleotides into plasmid DNA during repair DNA synthesis. DNA damage was introduced into plasmid substrates by treatment with AAAF which forms DNA adducts known to be corrected by the excision repair pathway (50Hansson J. Munn M. Rupp W.D. Kahn R. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21788-21792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An untreated plasmid was also included in each reaction to monitor repair-independent nucleotide incorporation. As shown in Fig. 1A, damage-dependent repair synthesis was detected in extracts made from three commonly used laboratory S. cerevisiae strains. The extent of damage-dependent repair synthesis increased with the amount of protein added. An amount of extract corresponding to 250 μg of protein in an assay volume of 50 μl produced good signals above the background level of incorporation of radiolabeled nucleotide into the unt"
https://openalex.org/W2028908063,"Protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) is a zinc metalloenzyme that performs a post-translational modification on many proteins that is critical for their function. The importance of cysteine residues in FTase activity was investigated using cysteine-specific reagents. Zinc-depleted FTase (apo-FTase), but not the holoenzyme, was completely inactivated by treatment with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Similar effects were detected after treatment of the enzyme with iodoacetamide. The addition of zinc to apo-FTase protects it from inactivation by NEM. These findings indicated the presence of specific cysteine residue(s), potentially located at the zinc binding site, that are required for FTase activity. We performed a selective labeling strategy whereby the cysteine residues exposed upon removal of zinc from the enzyme were modified with [3H]NEM. The enzyme so modified was digested with trypsin, and four labeled peptides were identified and sequenced, one peptide being the major site of labeling and the remaining three labeled to lesser extents. The major labeled peptide contained a radiolabeled cysteine residue, Cys299, that is in the β subunit of FTase and is conserved in all known protein prenyltransferases. This cysteine residue was changed to both alanine and serine by site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutant proteins were produced in Escherichia coli and purified. While both mutant proteins retained the ability to bind farnesyl diphosphate, they were found to have lost essentially all catalytic activity and ability to bind zinc. These results indicate that the Cys299 in the β subunit of FTase plays a critical role in catalysis by the enzyme and is likely to be one of the residues that directly coordinate the zinc atom in this enzyme.

A number of farnesylated proteins have been identified in eukaryotes, including Ras proteins, nuclear lamins, and at least two γ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (3Clarke S. Annu. Rev.

The properties of FTase are similar to those of a related enzyme, protein geranylgeranyltransferase Type I (GGTase I), which also recognizes and prenylates proteins with the carboxyl-terminal CaaX motif. However, GGTase I transfers the geranylgeranyl isoprenoid and prefers proteins with leucine at the X position of the CaaX motif (1Schafer W.R. Rine J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 25: 209-238Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 2Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). Known substrates for GGTase I include many Ras-related proteins, such as Rac and Rho, and most γ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (3Clarke S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 355-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 4Cox A.D. Der C.J. Curr. Opinion Cell. Biol. 1992; 4: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Since both FTase and GGTase I recognize proteins and short peptides containing appropriate CaaX motifs at their carboxyl terminus, they are also termed CaaX prenyltransferases (6Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Geranylgeranyltransferase type II (GGTase II, also known as Rab geranylgeranyltransferase), on the other hand, catalyzes geranylgeranylation of proteins that terminate in CC or CXC motifs at their carboxyl terminus (6Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Target proteins of GGTase II belong to the Rab protein family, members of which are involved in protein secretion and endocytosis (2Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar, 4Cox A.D. Der C.J. Curr. Opinion Cell. Biol. 1992; 4: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Purified FTase is a heterodimer consisting of 48-kDa α and 45-kDa β subunit polypeptides (7Reiss Y. Seabra M.C. Armstrong S.A. Slaughter C.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10672-10677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like FTase, GGTase I is also composed of two nonidentical subunits, these being a 48-kDa α and a 43-kDa β subunit (8Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17438-17443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA clones for the subunits of both enzymes have been isolated from rat and human cDNA libraries (9Chen W.-J. Andres D.A. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Cell. 1991; 66: 327-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 10Chen W-J. Andres D.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3175-3180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunological evidence and sequence comparison showed that these two enzymes share the same α subunit and that significant sequence similarity is found between the two β subunits (12Zhang F.L.

Since both enzymes show specificity toward their protein and isoprenoid substrates, the unique β subunits of these enzymes are thought to be responsible for the recognition and binding of both substrates. Consistent with this idea are studies showing that photoreactive isoprenoid analogues cross-link to the β subunits of both FTase and GGTase I (11Omer C.A. Kral A.M. Diehl R.E. Prendergast G.C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 470-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both FTase and GGTase I are zinc metalloenzymes (8Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17438-17443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Reiss Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6403-6408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Atomic absorption analysis of purified recombinant enzymes indicates that they contain one zinc atom per protein dimer (18Chen W.-J. Moomaw J.F. Overton L. Kost T.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9675-9680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zhang F.L. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23465-23470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prolonged dialysis against chelating reagents such as EDTA inactivates the enzymes in a fashion completely reversible by the addition of zinc, suggesting that the zinc is involved in catalytic activity of the enzyme (8Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17438-17443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Reiss Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol.

Additional evidence in this regard comes from cross-linking and direct binding studies that show that binding of the protein substrates to the enzymes is zinc-dependent (16Reiss Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6403-6408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). However, high affinity binding of isoprenoid substrates to zinc-depleted enzymes is similar to that of the native enzymes, indicating that the zinc is not required for binding of these substrates (16Reiss Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6403-6408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Metal substitution studies show that cadmium can functionally substitute for zinc in both FTase and GGTase I (15Yokoyama K. McGeady P. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1344-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 20Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar, 21Zhang F.L. Fu H.-W. Casey P.J. Bishop W.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8166-8171Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but the cadmium-substituted enzymes show altered substrate specificity (20Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar, 21Zhang F.L. Fu H.-W. Casey P.J. Bishop W.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8166-8171Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the metal atom in these enzymes is important in their interaction with substrates. While it is clear that the zinc in CaaX prenyltransferases is critical for their activity, the precise role that this metal plays is not yet known. The zinc could be acting catalytically, for example by increasing the nucleophilicity of the cysteine residue in the CaaX motif of protein substrate and/or activating the diphosphate leaving group, or structurally, perhaps by stabilizing the heterodimeric form of the enzyme. In order to clarify the role of the zinc atom in FTase, we first set out to identify residues that might serve as the ligands of the metal. A common metal ligand in many zinc enzymes is the thiol group of cysteine residues (22Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar, 23Betts L. Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 635-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). We used thiol modifying reagents to identify cysteine residues potentially important in FTase function. Through the use of selective chemical modification in conjunction with peptide sequencing and analysis by site-directed mutagenesis, we herein report the identification of an essential cysteine residue, Cys299 in the β subunit of FTase, that is critical for enzyme activity and, additionally, may serve as a zinc ligand in the enzyme. FTase activity was determined by quantitating the amount of 3H transferred from [3H]FPP into the Ha-Ras protein as described previously (24Casey P.J. Thissen J.A. Moomaw J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8631-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained the following components in a final volume of 50 μl: 50 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, 20 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 μM ZnCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 8 μM Ha-Ras, 1 μM [3H]FPP (8 Ci/mmol), and 50 ng of FTase. Assays were conducted for 15 min at 37°C, and the amount of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable [3H]farnesylated Ha-Ras was determined by filter binding assay. GGTase I activity was also determined as described previously (8Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17438-17443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a reaction mixture that was the same as for FTase except that the protein and isoprenoid substrates were Ras-CVLL (Ha-Ras containing a Leu-for-Ser substitution at the C terminus) and [3H]geranylgeranyl diphosphate ([3H]GGPP), respectively. FPP binding by FTase was determined using a filter binding assay. The standard mixture contained the following components in a final volume of 50 μl: 50 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, 20 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 μM ZnCl2, 2 mM DTT, 1 μM [3H]FPP (8 Ci/mmol), and 1 μg of FTase. The mixture was incubated at 0°C for 15 min, and the amount of [3H]FPP·FTase complex formed was measured by filter binding as described (20Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). To compare the FPP binding ability of NEM-modified and unmodified FTases, both enzymes (∼13 nM) were incubated with increasing concentrations of [3H]FPP (0-80 nM) in 50 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, 100 mM KCl, 5 μM ZnCl2, 0.2% octyl β-glucopyranoside, 2 mM DTT in a final volume of 50 μl at 0°C for 15 min, and bound FPP was determined as above. Except for the mutagenesis studies, which utilize bacterially produced enzymes (see below), the FTase and GGTase I used in this study were recombinant proteins produced by infection of Sf9 cells with recombinant baculoviruses and purified from cell extracts as described previously (18Chen W.-J. Moomaw J.F. Overton L. Kost T.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9675-9680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zhang F.L. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23465-23470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); both enzymes were >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis. To prepare the apo forms of the two enzymes, the appropriate enzyme (about 1 mg) was dialyzed first for 24 h at 4°C against 1 liter of 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, 1 mM DTT, and 5 mM EDTA and then for another 24 h against the same buffer except that the EDTA concentration was reduced to 1 mM. Removal of zinc from the dialyzed proteins was confirmed by assessing the zinc dependence of their activities (8Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17438-17443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Native and zinc-depleted FTase were chromatographed through G-50 Sephadex spin columns that had been equilibrated at 4°C with 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, containing 5 μM ZnCl2 (for native enzyme) or 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, containing 0.1 mM EDTA (for zinc-depleted enzyme), to remove DTT. The DTT-free enzymes were then diluted to a concentration of 14 μM with 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, in the presence or absence of 67 μM FPP. After a 5-min preincubation at room temperature, the inactivation reactions were initiated by the addition of either 250 μM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) or 2 mM iodoacetamide. At various times, aliquots of the reaction mixture were withdrawn, and reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 mM DTT. For the zero time point, NEM or iodoacetamide was preincubated with DTT for 1 min before adding to the aliquot of the preincubated enzyme solution. Treatment of GGTase I by NEM was performed by the same procedure as that of FTase. To prepare NEM-modified FTase for subsequent radiolabeling experiments, DTT-free holo-FTase (20 μM) was incubated with 250 μM NEM in 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, at room temperature for 20 min. The reaction was quenched with 10 mM DTT. The modified enzyme was designated as holo-NEM-FTase. To assess the ability of added zinc to protect apo-FTase from inactivation, the DTT-free enzyme (∼12 μM) was preincubated with increasing concentration of ZnCl2 (0-100 μM) in 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, containing 67 μM EDTA, at room temperature for 5 min. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 250 μM NEM and quenched with 10 mM DTT after a 10-min incubation. For the labeling studies, 120 μl of 5 mM unlabeled NEM in 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, was mixed prior to use with 1 ml of 18 μM [3H]NEM in pentane, and the mixture was placed on ice under a flow of N2 to evaporate the pentane. DTT-free FTase preparations were diluted to 2 μM with 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, containing 0.1 mM EDTA (for the apoenzyme) or 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, containing 5 μM ZnCl2 (for the holoenzyme). The pentane-free [3H]NEM solution (4.5 mM, 3.0 Ci/mmol) was mixed with each enzyme solution to give a final NEM concentration of 150 μM. These reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, stopped by the addition of 10 mM DTT, concentrated by CF-25 Centriflo membrane cones (Amicon, Beverly, MA), and then exchanged into buffer containing 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.2, and 50 mM NaCl by G-50 Sephadex spin chromatography; this treatment also served to remove the unreacted [3H]NEM. The amount of [3H]NEM incorporation into the subunits of FTase was determined by resolving the subunits by SDS-PAGE and subjecting the excised bands to scintillation spectroscopy. To produce peptides for sequence analysis, lyophilized [3H]NEM-labeled FTase (∼1 nmol) was dissolved in 8 M urea prepared in 0.4 M ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0, carboxymethylated with iodoacetamide, diluted 4-fold with water, and digested with trypsin as described (25Stone K.L. Williams K.R. Matsudaira P. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1993: 55Google Scholar). Peptides were isolated by HPLC using a 250 × 46-mm Vydac C18 reversed-phase column. The column was equilibrated with 10% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. After a 5-min wash, a linear gradient was established to 60% acetonitrile over 75 min, and then to 100% acetonitrile in 10 min, followed by a 15-min wash with 100% acetonitrile; the trifluoroacetic acid was kept at a constant 0.1% throughout. Selected peaks were further purified by rechromatography on the same column but using a second solvent system. In this system, the column was equilibrated with 8% acetonitrile and 0.1% ammonium acetate, pH 5.8. After a 5-min wash, a linear gradient was established to 80% acetonitrile over 55 min, followed by a 15-min wash with 80% acetonitrile; the ammonium acetate was kept constant throughout. The eluent was monitored for absorbance at 214 nm, and 1-min (0.5-ml) fractions were collected. Samples (25 μl) of the fractions were removed for radioactivity determination by scintillation spectroscopy. Fractions containing isolated peptides were pooled, solvent was reduced under reduced pressure, and the peptides were subjected to sequence analysis. One of the peptides purified by HPLC (designated under “Results” as that from peak III) was further subjected to cyanogen bromide cleavage in 70% formic acid as described (26Matsudaira P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 610-611Google Scholar) prior to rechromatography in the acetonitrile/ammonium acetate system. To express heterodimeric rat FTase in Escherichia coli, the α and β subunits of FTase were subcloned into two different expression vectors in which expression of both cDNAs was controlled by T7 promoters. Restriction sites for NdeI and NcoI were generated at the start codons of the α and β subunits, respectively, by PCR. For the α subunit, PCR primers designated FTα-N (5′-AAAAGAATTCATATGGCGGCCACTGAGGGGGTCGGGGA-3′) and FTα-B (5′-CTGTCCCTGTACAAGACATAGGTGGG-3′), based on amino-terminal and internal sequences of the α subunit of rat FTase, respectively, were used in a PCR reaction with 12.5 ng of plasmid pUC13-FTA encoding the α subunit of rat FTase. The resulting PCR product was digested with EcoRI-BsrGI and ligated back into the EcoRI-BsrGI-digested pUC13-FTA. For the β subunit, PCR primers designated FTβ-N (5′-AAAAAAGCTTCCATGGCTTCTTCGACTTCCTTCACCTATT-3′) and FTβ-B (5′-CTGTGCAGGATCCAGTAGCAGAGCCA-3′) based on amino-terminal and internal sequences of the β subunit of rat FTase, respectively, were used in a PCR reaction with 12.5 ng of plasmid pUC13-FTB encoding the β subunit of rat FTase. The resulting PCR product was digested with HindIII-BamHI and ligated back into the HindIII-BamHI-digested pUC13-FTB. These resulting plasmids, designated as pUC13-PCRFTα and pUC13-PCRFTβ for the α and β subunits of FTase, respectively, were confirmed by DNA sequencing. A NdeI-HindIII fragment from pUC13-PCRFTα that contained the coding region of the α subunit of FTase was ligated into a NdeI-HindIII-digested pET28a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), and a NcoI fragment from pUC13-PCRFTβ that contained the coding region of the β subunit of FTase was ligated into a NcoI-digested pAlter-Ex2 vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The resulting plasmids, designated as pET28a-FTα and pAlter-Ex2-FTβ, were co-transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli cells; expression of the pET28a-FTα plasmid yielded the α subunit of FTase with an N-terminal extension containing a hexahistidine motif. A 3-liter culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring the appropriate FTase plasmids was grown to an optical density of 0.6, and FTase expression was induced by the addition of 0.4 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside; 0.5 mM ZnSO4 was also added at this time to ensure availability of zinc. After a 4-h induction at 37°C, cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was resuspended in 40 ml of buffer containing 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, 5 mM imidazole, 1 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, and a protease inhibitor mix (27Moomaw J.F. Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the cells were lysed by two passes through a French press. The sample was diluted to 80 ml, NaCl was added to a final concentration of 300 mM, and the extract was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatant was subjected to Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The resin was eluted with a 5-150 mM imidazole gradient in 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, and the protease inhibitor mix. Peak fractions, analyzed by assessing their FTase activity, were pooled and dialyzed twice for 1 h each against 1 liter each of 50 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, 5 μM ZnCl2, and 1 mM DTT. The dialyzed enzyme was applied to a Q-HP 16/10 high resolution anion exchange column (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated in buffer containing 50 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, 5 μM ZnCl2, and 1 mM DTT. The column was washed with the equilibration buffer and then eluted with a linear gradient to 500 mM NaCl in the same buffer. Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated with buffer exchange into the starting buffer using a CentriPrep 30 concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA) to a protein concentration of >1 mg/ml, flash-frozen in aliquots, and stored at −80°C until use. For the mutant enzymes, the purification procedure was the same except that the Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia) was used instead of the Q-HP column, and peak fractions were determined by immunoblot analysis and FPP binding rather than by enzymatic activity. An aliquot of each of the three purified mutant FTases (∼20 pmol, based on FPP binding) was diluted to 60 μl with 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, 1 mM DTT, and 10 μM EDTA. Samples were chromatographed through G-50 Sephadex spin columns that had been equilibrated at 4°C with 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.7, 1 mM DTT, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 μM EDTA and incubated at 30°C for 1 h. A 14 μM solution of 65ZnCl2 (30 Ci/mmol), prepared by diluting the stock reagent with 200 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.5, was added to each of the enzyme samples so that the final concentration of 65ZnCl2 was 2 μM. Following an incubation for 3 h at room temperature and overnight at 0°C, the incubation mixtures were supplemented with FPP to a final concentration of 5 μM (to prevent dissociation of bound zinc) and held for 15 min at room temperature. One-fifth of each reaction mixture was loaded onto a 10% continuous native polyacrylamide gel prepared in 90 mM Tris·HCl (pH 8.2), 80 mM boric acid, and 2.5 mM EDTA, and electrophoresis was performed in 90 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.2, 80 mM boric acid, and 2.5 mM EDTA for 1 h at 200 V. The gel was washed with electrophoresis buffer for 15 min, wrapped in cellophane, and exposed to film. Site-specific mutations were introduced into FTase using the Altered Sites Mutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI). Three mutant enzymes were produced, these being FTαC341A with a mutation in the α subunit of FTase and FTβC299A and FTβC299S with mutations in their β subunits. Each of the mutant cDNAs was mapped with restriction enzymes, and the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Each was then subcloned into the expression vector pET28a (for the α subunit mutant) or pAlter-Ex2 (for the β subunit mutants). Standard molecular biology methods for DNA sequencing and manipulation were used (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.), except that the DNA plasmid pUC13-PCRFTα was sequenced at the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill) Automated DNA Sequencing Facility on a model 373A DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the Taq DyeDeoxy™ Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). Radiolabeled peptides were sequenced by automated Edman degradation on an amino acid sequencer (Applied Biosystems) by C. R. Moomaw at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (Dallas). SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis were performed as described previously (18Chen W.-J. Moomaw J.F. Overton L. Kost T.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9675-9680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antiserum p538, a polyclonal rabbit antibody directed against a peptide corresponding to residues 359-370 of rat FTase-α, was used to detect the α subunit of FTase; antiserum p121, a polyclonal rabbit antibody directed against holo-FTase, was used to detect the β subunit of FTase. Both antisera were affinity-purified on Protein A-Sepharose prior to use. Protein concentration was routinely analyzed by the Bradford method using a commercial dye (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as standard. Recombinant Ha-Ras and Ras-CVLL proteins were purified from bacterial expression systems as described (24Casey P.J. Thissen J.A. Moomaw J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To better understand differentiated epithelial cell growth regulation, we have initiated a study to identify genes which are regulated by the thyrotropin-dependent mitogenic pathway in dog thyroid cells. A thyroid cDNA library was prepared from a methimazole and propylthiouracil-treated dog and differentially screened with probes derived from control or stimulated thyroids. Among 19 clones isolated, 6 encode known proteins (inwardly rectifying potassium channel, nucleosome assembly protein, ribosomal protein L7, elongation factor 1α, non-muscle myosin light chain, and heat shock protein 90β). The 13 others correspond to proteins whose function is unknown. Among them, 5 correspond to mRNAs whose expression was modulated by mitogenic stimulation of thyrocytes in primary culture. A preliminary characterization of two of these cDNAs is reported: clone 5, which might represent a novel, atypical protein kinase, and clone 3, which contains ankyrin-like repeats, suggesting that it might interact with other proteins.

Many of these regulated genes are proto-oncogenes or anti-oncogenes. Most of the known ones belong to two major classes of mitogenic pathways: the growth factors receptors tyrosine protein kinases and the phorbol ester protein kinases C cascades. A third signaling pathway, the cyclic AMP-dependent cascade, considered for a long time to be a general inhibitor of proliferation, stimulates proliferation in several epithelial cell types and in yeast (reviewed in Ref. 12Roger P. Reuse S. Maenhaut C. Dumont J.E. Vitam. Horm. 1995; 51: 59-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In thyroid cells, this pathway is activated by thyrotropin (TSH), 1The abbreviations used are: TSHthyrotropinEGFepidermal growth factorMMmethimazolePTUpropylthiouracilFCSfetal calf serumkbkilobaseHGFhepatocyte growth factorPCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenNAPnucleosome assembly proteinEFelongation factor. which is the main physiological agent regulating the thyroid gland (13Dumont J.E.

TSH and cyclic AMP promote cell proliferation, function, and differentiation while the mitogenic pathways elicited by EGF and tumor promoting phorbol esters are associated with the loss of expression of the differentiation specific genes (15Roger P.

Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 667-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms of this pathway are still largely unknown. We have therefore initiated a study aimed at the identification of genes that are regulated by cyclic AMP in thyroid cells. thyrotropin epidermal growth factor methimazole propylthiouracil fetal calf serum kilobase hepatocyte growth factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen nucleosome assembly protein elongation factor. To identify new genes that might be regulated by the thyroid mitogenic pathways, we prepared a cDNA library from the thyroid of a dog treated in vivo with methimazole and propylthiouracil. The inhibition by these drugs of thyroid hormones synthesis leads to a relief of the inhibitory control of these hormones on the hypophysis, to TSH secretion, and chronic stimulation of the thyroid. By differential screening, we identified 19 clones of which 13 have not been described to date. Among those, five corresponded to mRNA whose expression showed modulation after different mitogenic stimulations of thyroid cells in primary culture. Animal tissues used for this work are the same as those of a previous study conducted in our laboratory (19Maenhaut C. Brabant G. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3000-3007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dogs used in this study were used for cardiological studies, and their thyroids were resected before these experiments. Briefly, dogs were treated by oral administration for 4 weeks of methimazole (MM) (2 × 60 mg/day strumazol) and propylthiouracil (PTU) (2 × 150 mg/day propylthiurit) in order to increase the circulating TSH level. Triiodothyronine and thyroxine concentrations in the serum were followed by radioimmunoassay to ensure that the treatment had been effective. On the day of the experiment, 1 h prior to thyroid resection, the dogs received 50 mg/kg bromodeoxyuridine by intravenous injection. Bromodeoxyuridine labeling analyses were performed as described (20Coclet J. Foureau F. Ketelbant P. Galand P. Dumont J.E. Clin. Endocrinol. 1989; 31: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Tissues for PCNA immunohistochemistry and RNA preparation were obtained from MM/PTU treated and untreated dogs. The immunohistochemical procedure for PCNA immunohistochemistry was used as described previously (21Galand P. Del Bino G. Morret M. Capel P. Degraef C. Fokan D. Feremans W. Leukemia. 1995; 9: 1075-1084PubMed Google Scholar). The method involves methanol fixation of the tissue (previously snap-frozen in this case), followed by embedding in paraffin. Dog thyroid follicles were obtained as detailed previously (22Roger P. Hotimsky A. Moreau C. Dumont J.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1982; 26: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The follicles were seeded in 100-mm Petri dishes and cultured in a control medium consisting of Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), Ham's F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.), MCDB 104 (Life Technologies, Inc.) (2:1:1, v/v/v) supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 40 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B. Fetal calf serum 10% (FCS), TSH 1 milliunit/ml (Armour Pharmaceutical Co., Chicago, IL), forskolin 10−5M (Calbiochem), EGF 25 ng/ml (Sigma), and HGF 50 ng/ml (human recombinant HGF, kindly provided by T. Nakamura) were added when indicated. To purify the RNA, thyroid tissues were ground into a fine powder under liquid nitrogen and homogenized in 4 M guanidinium thiocyanate; thyroid cells were scraped from culture dishes in the same solution. Lysed cells were layered over a cushion of 5.7 M cesium chloride in an SW56 tube and centrifuged at 36,000 rpm at 15°C for 17 h. Total RNA was extracted as described (23Chirgwin J. Przybyla A. MacDonald R. Rutter W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (16610) Google Scholar). After treatment with 60 μg/ml proteinase K in 0.3 M NaCl, 0.1% SDS and phenol/chloroform extractions, the RNA was precipitated and resuspended in water for spectrophotometric quantification. Polyadenylated RNA was purified by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography (Stratagene) or by the PolyATtract system (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. The quality of the poly(A)+ RNA prepared for the construction of the library and for the synthesis of the probes was confirmed by Northern blot analysis, using a thyroglobulin probe, detecting a 8.5-kb mRNA. For tissue distribution analysis, total RNA of various dog tissues was extracted with the TRIzol Reagent kit (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, UK) (24Chomczynski P. Biotechniques. 1993; 15: 532-535PubMed Google Scholar). For the construction of a cDNA library in λZAP II, the poly(A)+ RNA prepared from the thyroid of a MM/PTU-treated dog was used for the construction of an oligo(dT)-primed, directional cDNA library with the ZAP-cDNA synthesis and cloning system of Stratagene, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The resultant library contained approximately 107 primary recombinants with 0.7% non-recombinant phages. The library was amplified once by the plate lysate method to obtain 2.4 × 1010 plaque-forming units/ml. To assess size distribution of inserts in the cDNA library, individual plaques were randomly selected and plate lysate stocks were generated by infection of XL-1 blue Escherichia coli cells. Phage DNA was extracted and restricted by EcoRI/XhoI, and this was then electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels to visualize insert sizes. The mean size of the randomly selected cloned inserts was 2.6 kb. Poly(A)+ RNA from in vivo quiescent or stimulated thyroid tissues was used as template for the synthesis of single-stranded digoxigenin-labeled cDNA probes using hexamers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase following the protocol suggested by the manufacturer (Dog Labeling kit, Boehringer Mannheim). For differential screening, the library was plated at low density (approximately 6000 plaque-forming units/13-cm diameter dish), and duplicate nylon membranes (Qiabrane, Qiagen) lifts were made from each dish. Filters were treated with an alkaline solution, followed by neutralization and nucleic acid was fixed onto the membranes by UV cross-linking (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY1989Google Scholar). Differential hybridization screening of the library was performed according to the procedure of the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim). The first filter was hybridized with the probe derived from quiescent thyroids, and the second one with the probe derived from stimulated thyroids. Following 4 h of prehybridization in 5 × SSC, 1% (w/v) blocking reagent for nucleic acid (Boehringer Mannheim), 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine, 0.02% SDS, the two blots were incubated for 16 h at 68°C in the hybridization solution containing the digoxigenin-labeled cDNA probes (25 ng/ml). Stringency washes were performed for 2 × 10 min at room temperature with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, followed by 2 × 20 min at 65°C with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and 2 × 20 min at 65°C with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. The immunological detection of the digoxigenin-labeled probes was performed by a secondary alkaline phosphatase-labeled antibody complex in combination with a chemiluminescent substrate LumigenPPD. Filters were exposed to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Corp.) for 1-4 h at room temperature. Clones that hybridized differentially with the two probes were replated at low density for a second screening. The remaining positives were picked out, plaque purified, and further analyzed by Northern blotting and sequencing. After in vivo excision of Bluescript phagemid from Uni-ZAP XR vector using the manufacturer's protocol, the resulting plasmid DNA was amplified and purified by the alkaline lysis method (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY1989Google Scholar). Various restriction enzymes were used to map inserts and subfragments were further cloned in both orientations into M13 mp18 and M13 mp19 single-stranded DNA vectors. Sequence determination was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method (26Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) using Taq DNA polymerase and M13 fluorescent primers. Reactions were run on the Applied Biosystems 370A automated DNA sequencer. Approximately 300 base pairs of the extremities or the internal sequences of clones were compared with non-redundant European Molecular Biology Laboratory and GenBank data bases, using the BLAST Network Service. Sequences were also translated and used to search the protein data bases (Protein Identification Resource, SWISSProt, and GenPept) using the BLASTX sequence analysis program. For Northern blot analysis, after denaturation using glyoxal and dimethyl sulfoxide, according to the procedure of McMaster and Carmichael (27McMaster G.K. Carmichael G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4835-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar), equal aliquots (8-10 μg) of total RNA were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7. Acridine orange staining of the gel before blotting ascertained that the amounts of RNA were equal in all samples. Denaturated RNAs were blotted to a nylon membrane (Pall Biodyne B) using SSC × 20 (SSC × 1, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate) as described (28Thomas P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5201-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (5845) Google Scholar). Prehybridization (4 h at 42°C) and hybridization (overnight at 42°C) were carried out in 50% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's (0.1% Ficoll, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone), 5 × SSPE (20 × SSPE, 3.6 M NaCl, 0.2 M sodium phosphate, pH 8.3, 20 mM EDTA), 0.3% SDS, 250 μg/ml denatured salmon testis DNA, and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The hybridization solution contained in addition 10% dextran sulfate (w/v) and the heat-denatured probe. cDNA probes were α-32P-labeled by random primer extension to a specific activity of approximately 109 cpm/μg (29Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16562) Google Scholar). Filters were washed 4 times for 10 min in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and 4 times for 20 min in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60°C. They were then autoradiographed at −70°C using Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Corp.) and Siemens intensifying screens. To construct a TSH-stimulated thyroid cDNA library, a dog was treated with methimazole and propylthiouracil as described (see above). At the time of thyroid resection, the dog was biologically hypothyroid and its thyroid was thus chronically stimulated by TSH. Serum thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels were 0.5 μg/dl and <30 ng/dl, respectively, versus 1.1 ± 0.1 μg/dl and 37 ± 6 ng/dl in control dogs. Histological examination showed markedly a hyperplastic thyroid with almost total absence of colloid in the antithyroid drug-treated animal, and normal follicles containing colloid in the control thyroids. Bromodeoxyuridine labeling analysis demonstrated nuclear labeling in 8.1% of the thyroid cells of the treated dog, whereas the thyroid cells of control animals showed only 0.17 ± 0.07% labeled nuclei (mean ± S.E.). Total RNA was extracted from the thyroid of the MM/PTU-treated dog and the poly(A)+ RNA fraction was isolated. The quality of the poly(A)+ RNA was confirmed by Northern blot analysis, using a thyroglobulin probe, which detected an intact 8.5-kb mRNA (data not shown). This poly(A)+ RNA was used as template for the construction of an oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library in the λZAP II phage vector. The screening of 250,000 plaques, with cDNA probes from control and stimulated thyroids, yielded 19 plaques which, after a second screening, showed consistent differential hybridization. Among these, 11 showed overexpression in the treated thyroid, and 8 showed underexpression. All cDNA inserts were partially sequenced and the sequences were compared to the GenBank and EMBL data bases, using the BLAST program for nucleic acids and proteins (Table I). Six clones were identified as previously characterized genes. These known clones coded for an inwardly rectifying potassium channel (IRK-2), nucleosome assembly protein-1 (NAP-1), ribosomal protein L7, elongation factor 1α (EF-1α), non-muscle myosin light chain (MLC), and heat-shock protein-90 β (hsp90). Four other clones (4, 5, 137, and 169) showed significant similarities to DNA sequences in the data bases but corresponded to proteins whose functions are unknown (accession numbers: 4, >gb/D14812/HUMORF16; 5, >emb/Z45305/HSC2MB121; 137, >emb/Z43809/HSC1LE021; 169, >gb/M85812/M85812). The remaining 9 clones did not match any known gene in the data bases.Table IIdentification of 19 differentially expressed cDNAsCloneInsert sizeIdentification(kb)Overexpressed33?441.8EF-1α510.7?531.9IRK-2591.3?1012.8?1370.8?1640.7MLC1650.6?1672Ribosomal protein L71691.4?Underexpressed21.2?40.8?51?163.2?452.2?1342.5NAP1431.5Hsp 901664.2? Open table in a new tab Total RNA was extracted from the thyroids of several control or MM/PTU-treated dogs and subjected to Northern blot analysis. Acridine orange staining, rather than β-actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, or cyclophilin hybridization, was used to normalize the amount of total RNA transferred onto the filter. Indeed, these three genes are modulated in our system (data not shown). One representative experiment is illustrated in Fig. 1. Clone 3 mRNA is up-regulated in the stimulated dog thyroids. Clone 165 mRNA level was highly variable between dogs, enhanced in some animals or attenuated in others. It was therefore not further characterized. Clones 5, 4, 2, 45, 143 (hsp90), and 134 (NAP) transcript levels were all reduced in stimulated thyroids. No modulation was observed for clone 44 (EF-1α) and clone 169, and no signal was detected for clones 101, 51, and 53 (IRK-2). Hybridization with clones 16, 59, 137, and 166 revealed only a smear, but no discrete transcript. All these data were confirmed in several dogs. Thus, these Northern studies demonstrate the modulation of five unknown genes in stimulated thyroids. The following dog tissues were harvested shortly after sacrifice, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and investigated by Northern blotting: thyroid, spleen, liver, lung, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, adrenal, ovary, testis, stomach, pancreas, large intestine, lymph node, cerebrum, and cerebellum. Clones 2, 3, 4 (Fig. 2), 59, 165, and 169 (Table II) showed no particular tissue distribution pattern. They were detected in most of the tissues analyzed, with a particularly important expression in the adrenal for clone 3, and in the testis, thyroid, and brain for clone 4 (Fig. 2). Clone 5 showed strong thyroid specificity although it could also be clearly seen in both the ovary and cerebrum (Fig. 2). Clones 45 and 51 showed a much higher expression in the thyroid than in the other tissues. Clone 53 (IRK-2) was present only in skeletal muscle, cerebrum, and cerebellum, which was not unexpected (Table II). Clone 101, interestingly, appeared to be confined solely to the liver. To obtain qualitative estimates of the proliferative state of the tissues, those were stained with a monoclonal antibody (PC10) against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The number of PCNA positive nuclei in a tissue is supposed to be closely correlated to that tissue's growth fraction (21Galand P. Del Bino G. Morret M. Capel P. Degraef C. Fokan D. Feremans W. Leukemia. 1995; 9: 1075-1084PubMed Google Scholar). However, the proliferative activity, qualitatively assessed by two observers, suggests no correlation between the tissue mRNA expression level and the level of proliferation (Fig. 2, Table II).Table IISummary of RNA tissue distribution of 5 clonesClone 53Clone 59Clone 101Clone 165Clone 169PCNA labelingThyroid−−−++−Spleen−−−+−+Liver−−++−−±Lung−−−+−−Heart−+−−+−Skeletal muscle+++−+−−Kidney−+−+++Adrenal−−−−+++Ovary−−−−+++Testis−++−+++++Stomach−−−−++++Pancreas−−−−−−Large intestine−+−−+++++Lymph node−−−−−+Cerebrum+++−−++−Cerebellum+++−−++− Open table in a new tab In primary cultures of dog thyroid cells, the thyrocytes were cultured for 4 days without mitogenic agents to allow cells to spread and reach a quiescent state. In the absence of stimulating agents, virtually no labeling of nuclei was observed during the 48 h after the addition of [3H]thymidine to the culture medium. Addition of TSH (1 milliunit/ml), forskolin (10−5M), an adenylate cyclase activator, EGF (25 ng/ml), and FCS (10%) at day 4 induced, after a lag of about 18 h, a progressive increase in the fraction of [3H]thymidine incorporating nuclei (30Roger P. Servais P. Dumont J.E. FEBS Lett. 1983; 157: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The results of Northern blot hybridization analyses are presented Fig. 3, 4, 5, 6, and in Table III.Table III.Summary of in vitro mRNA regulation studiesClonemRNA kbTSHEGFChronicAcuteChronicAcute53.7−↑↓−↑34−↓↑↑↑21.5−↑↑↑41.4; 1.8NTaNT, not tested.↑↑NT453↑↑NT−Hsp-901.9; 2.7↓↓↑↑NTNAP-1<1↓↑↓↑NTNT1695 mRNA−−−NTEF-1α1.8−−−NTa NT, not tested. Open table in a new tab The clone 5 mRNA levels peaked after 20 h incubation in the presence of TSH and decreased after 48 h (Fig. 3). EGF also increased clone 5 mRNA levels after 6-24 h (Table III). Chronic stimulation by EGF and FCS did not change the expression of this clone (Fig. 3). Clone 3 mRNA was down-regulated by forskolin (Fig. 4A) and TSH (not shown) for the first 24 h. It was increased thereafter, but never exceeded the control levels, even after a 7 days stimulation (not shown). EGF led to an up-regulation, with acute (Fig. 4A) as well as with chronic stimulation (Table III). The mRNA content was already enhanced after 8 h of EGF stimulation, and increased further with longer incubation times. The negative effect of forskolin or TSH on mRNA levels was also observed on the EGF stimulation, since the simultaneous addition of EGF and TSH for 48 h led to a lower mRNA level than when EGF was added alone (Fig. 4B). The effects of EGF and EGF + TSH on clone 3 mRNA content were reproduced by HGF (50 ng/ml), another potent mitogenic agent for thyrocytes (31Dremier S. Taton M. Coulonval K. Nakamura T. Matsumoto K. Dumont J.E. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and HGF + TSH. However, the increase observed with HGF was less pronounced, and the TSH inhibition was smaller (Fig. 4B). Clone 2 mRNA levels were slightly increased after TSH treatment whereas a 3-day EGF + FCS treatment led to a clear accumulation (Fig. 5, Table III). Acute stimulation by EGF also enhanced clone 2 mRNA levels (Table III). The mRNA levels of two identified clones (hsp90 and NAP) were also studied (Fig. 6). Treatment with forskolin led first to a decrease of hsp90 and NAP-1 mRNA levels, then after 20 h to an increase. Hsp90 mRNA control levels increased in parallel with the age of the culture; they were further enhanced by chronic treatment with EGF (Table III). Analysis of the data obtained for the other clones presented in Table III shows that clone 4 mRNA expression was enhanced by TSH and EGF, and clone 45 mRNA amounts were increased by TSH, but remained equal after EGF treatment. As in vivo, no modulation was observed for EF-1α and clone 169, no signal was detected for clones 101, 51, and IRK-2, and hybridization with clones 16, 59, 137, and 166 was uninterpretable. Four clones were selected for further characterization: clones 5 and 3 (based on their modulated mRNA levels), clones 45 and 51 (based on their tissue distribution). The complete sequences of clones 5 and 3 were determined. Hydropathicity profile of the predicted 343-amino acid sequence of clone 5 according to the analysis of Kyte and Doolittle (48Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16899) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of a stretch of 20 hydrophobic amino acids, which might represent a potential transmembrane region. Protein sequence comparison of clone 5 with the data bases showed ≈30% identity with the protein kinase family (serine-threonine kinases). However, among the 12 well conserved subdomains of the kinase catalytic domain (32Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar), only two are present in our clone: subdomains VIII and IX, with an homology of ≈80% (Fig. 7a). Clone 3 encodes a 659-amino acid protein containing 6 ankyrin-like repeats (Fig. 7b). The DNA library accession numbers of clones 3 and 5 are, X99145 and X99144, respectively. To identify new genes modulated by the TSH-dependent mitogenic pathway, we performed a differential screening of a thyroid cDNA library from a dog treated in vivo with MM/PTU. The use of an in vivo chronically stimulated thyroid insured, with no a priori assumption, that the real in vivo growth pathway was investigated. This led to the identification of 11 clones showing overexpression and 8 showing underexpression. While 6 clones encode known proteins, the 13 others have not been described to date. Among them, 4 (5, 4, 137, and 169) showed significant similarities to DNA sequences in the data bases but corresponded to proteins whose function is unknown. In vivo mRNA regulation was assessed by Northern blotting to confirm the results of the differential screening. Among the unknown candidates, clone 3 mRNA was up-regulated and clones 5, 4, 2, and 45 mRNAs were down-regulated after antithyroid drug administration. mRNA tissue distribution analysis showed neither a particular tissue distribution for most of the clones studied, nor a parallelism between mRNA expression and proliferation rate. Clones 5 and 45 are more abundantly expressed in the thyroid. Clone 51 appeared to be exclusively present in this tissue, but the signal was very faint. Northern blotting showed that 5 unidentified cDNAs (2, 3, 4, 5, and 45) out of 13, corresponded to mRNA of which levels were modulated by the cAMP-dependent and -independent mitogenic pathways in dog thyrocytes in primary cultures. This could result from modified transcription, degradation, or both. Remarkably, clone 3 mRNA levels were increased in vivo but not in vitro by TSH. This discrepancy suggests that the in vivo situation does not necessarily match the in vitro stimulation. Whereas in vitro the cAMP-dependent pathway alone is directly activated by TSH or forskolin, the situation in vivo appears to be more complex. The presence of EGF and IGF-1 in the thyroid has indeed been described (14Dumont J.E. Lamy F. Roger P. Maenhaut C. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 667-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), and the TSH stimulation induced in vivo by the treatment with the antithyroid drugs could indirectly involve these growth factors or even other, undescribed factors. In other words, the effects observed in vivo could be the result of different interacting signaling components, which is not the case in vitro. To confirm clone 3 mRNA up-regulation by agents acting via tyrosine kinase receptors, we investigated the action of HGF, which is the most potent mitogen for our cells (31Dremier S. Taton M. Coulonval K. Nakamura T. Matsumoto K. Dumont J.E. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). HGF reproduced the effects of EGF, but the increase was less pronounced. As HGF has a weaker dedifferentiating action on thyrocytes than EGF, these results may suggest that clone 3 mRNA expression is inversely related to the differentiation state of the thyrocytes. Among the 19 clones which were apparently differentially expressed in chronically stimulated thyroids, 7 (2, 3, 4, 5, 45, hsp90, and NAP-1) were regulated in vivo, as suggested by the screening, and in vitro by the various mitogenic cascades; three (101, 51, and IRK-2) were not detected by Northern blot analysis, four (16, 59, 137, and 166) led to uninterpretable results, and two (EF-1α, and 169) were not regulated. In our thyrocytes, hsp90 mRNA expression was modulated by chronic treatments: positively by EGF, negatively by TSH and forskolin. As both these agents are mitogenic, it is difficult to relate this expression to proliferation as in some other systems (33Burel C. Mezger V. Pinto M. Rallu M. Trigon S. Morange M. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 34Ferris D. Harel-Bellan A. Morimoto R.I. Welch W.J. Farrar W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 1986; 138: 1298-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). NAP-1 assembles the nucleosomes by mediating the formation of a histone octamer and transferring it to DNA (38Ishimi Y. Yasuda H. Hirosumi J. Hanaoka F. Yamada M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 94: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 39Ishimi Y. Hirosumi J. Sato W. Sugasawa K. Yokota S. Hanaoka F. Yamada M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In our cells, NAP-1 mRNA varied in a cyclical manner in response to TSH. This could correspond to the modulation of the histones, which are well known cell cycle-dependent genes. During the cell cycle of Balb/c 3T3 cells, the content of NAP-1 was found to change in parallel with histone synthesis (40Ishimi Y. Kojima M. Yamada M. Hanaoka F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The modulation of its expression in our cells is compatible with this concept. The expression of a human NAP-related gene also increases rapidly in T cells after induction of cell proliferation, and mitogenesis was inhibited in cells treated with the corresponding antisense oligonucleotide (41Simon H. Mills G. Kozlowski M. Hogg D. Branch D. Ishimi Y. Siminovitch K. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). On the basis of the in vitro mRNA regulation results, we selected first clones 5 and 3 for further characterization. Both were completely sequenced. Clone 5 protein sequence comparison with the data bases revealed ≈30% identity with the protein kinase family. This large superfamily of homologous proteins contains a 250-300-amino acid kinase domain, composed of 12 conserved subdomains that fold into a common catalytic core structure (32Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar). However, our clone lacks most of these consensus motifs: indeed, only subdomains VIII and IX are present (with an identity of ≈80%). Subdomain VIII appears to play a major role in the recognition of peptide substrates, and contains several autophosphorylation sites, required for maximal kinase activity in many protein kinases. No clear ATP-binding site is identified as in the Bcr protein serine/threonine kinase (42Maru Y. Witte O. Cell. 1991; 67: 459-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and in the human A6 tyrosine kinase (43Beeler J.F. Larochelle W.J. Chedid M. Tronick S.R. Aaronson S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 982-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Clone 5 could represent a new example of these atypical kinases, and work is currently in progress to test this hypothesis. Clone 3 protein sequence comparison with the data bases showed that this protein contains 6 ankyrin-like repeats. The ankyrin-like repeat is a 31-33-amino acid motif which consists of a TPLHLA core sequence and 8-10 other well conserved residues. These motifs are found in ankyrin and several other proteins, very heterogeneous with respect to their origin, function, intracellular localization, and number of repeats. These proteins include cell cycle control proteins (e.g. cdc10 gene product of Schizosaccharomyces pombe), putative integral membrane proteins (e.g. Notch gene product of Drosophila melanogaster, involved in cellular differentiation), transcription factors (e.g. NF-κB p105 precursor), and others (e.g. IκB-like molecules, virally-encoded proteins) (44Blank V. Kourilsky P. Israël A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 135-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). More recently, ankyrin repeats have been discovered in INK4 proteins, a family of cell cycle regulators characterized by their selective inhibition of cdk4 and cdk6 (45Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3340) Google Scholar, 46Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1994; 371: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar, 47Hirai H. Roussel M.F. Kato J. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2672-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Ankyrin-like repeats are involved both in interactions between distinct proteins and within a single molecule, and this can serve a variety of functions. The presence of 6 of such motifs in clone 3 protein suggests that it might interact with other proteins, and these putative partners will be sought. We are now studying the possible role of clone 3 and clone 5 proteins in the proliferation and differentiation of the thyroid cell. We thank D. Christophe and G. Vassart for advice and critical reading of this manuscript."

In cells in which αt and α are present in stoichiometric proportion within the GM-CSF-binding complex, we provide evidence that αt is dominant negative over wild type α on the basis of two different functional assays: cell proliferation and foci formation.

This family is characterized by conserved structural features in the extracellular domain, i.e. four conserved cysteine residues, and a typical WSXWS motif in the juxtamembrane region (9D'Andrea A.D.

Furthermore, truncation of the COOH-terminal domain of GMR-α does not affect high affinity GM-CSF binding (19Polotskaya A. Zhao Y. Lilly M.L. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14607-14613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of both chains of human GMR has been shown to confer GM-CSF responsiveness to the murine fibroblast cell line NIH-3T3 and the pro-B cell line BaF3 (16Rajotte D. Sadowski H.B. Haman A. Gopalbhai K. Meloche S. Liu L. Krystal G. Hoang T. Blood. 1996; 88 (in press)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Watanabe S. Mui A.L.-F. Muto A. Chen J.X. Hayashida K. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Arai K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), indicating a conservation of signal transduction pathways.Interestingly, the β chain, referred to as β common or βc, is shared with interleukin-3 and −5 (IL-3 and IL-5), two cytokines that exhibit significant overlap in biological activity with GM-CSF (for review, see Ref. 22Miyajima A. Mui A.L.-F. Ogorochi T. Sakamaki K. Blood. 1993; 82: 1960-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domains of IL-3R, GMR, and IL-5R α chains also share a highly conserved stretch of amino acids just after the transmembrane domain (23Kitamura T. Sato N. Arai K. Miyajima A. Cell. 1991; 66: 1165-1174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In parallel, IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15 have also been shown to associate with their cognate receptors with similar heteromeric dynamics (24Kawahara A. Minami Y. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5433-5440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Giri J.G. Ahdieh M. Eisenman J. Shanabeck K. Grabstein K. Kumaki S. Namen A. Park L.S. Cosman D. Anderson D.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2663-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), each one binding a specific α or β chain and sharing a common γ chain. Finally, another family of cytokines, IL-6, IL-11, oncostatin M, ciliary neutrotrophic factor and leukemia inhibitory factor, also bind to receptors that share common subunits, gp130 or leukemia inhibitory factor receptor α (27; for review see Ref. 28Kishimoto T. Akira S. Taga T. Science. 1992; 258: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Thus, receptor permutation and matching appears to be a recurring theme for cytokines with overlapping biological activities.Our previous work indicates that GMR-α, -βc, and GM-CSF associate in stoichiometric proportion to form a high affinity slowly dissociating ternary complex (13Hoang T. De Léan A. Haman A. Beauchemin V. Kitamura T. Clark S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11881-11887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, IL-6 has been shown to form hexamers in solution with IL-6R and gp130 in the proportion 2:2:2 (27Paonessa G. Graziani R. De Serio A. Savino R. Ciapponi L. Lahm A. Salvati A.L. Toniatti C. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1942-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ectopic expression of βc with a point mutation in the transmembrane domain (V449E) has been shown to confer ligand-independent growth to the hemopoietic cell line FDC-P1 (29Jenkins B.J. D'Andrea R. Gonda T.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4276-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). By analogy with a similar mutation in neu, it is suggested that the V449E mutation triggers constitutive βc homodimerization and, by extrapolation, that wild type (w/t) βc may also be able to form homodimers. There is, however, no direct evidence for a higher order of receptor association.In the present study, affinity cross-linking indicates the presence of both α and βc dimers within the GMR complex. Our data also indicate that α can homodimerize in the presence of ligand, even when βc is absent. Using functional assays, we provide evidence that a GMR-α truncated in its cytoplasmic domain acts as a dominant negative mutant over w/t GMR-α, suggesting higher order association and a functional role for the oligomerization of GMR-α.

Previous works have established the importance of the cytoplasmic domain of GMR-α in signal transduction and biological activity (17Ronco L.V. Silverman S.L. Wong S.G. Slamon D.J. Park L.S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14607-14613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this domain does not seem absolutely necessary under very high concentrations of GM-CSF (20Eder M. Ernst T.J. Ganser A. Jubinsky P.T. Inhorn R. Hoelzer D. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30173-30180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, truncation of the COOH-terminal domain of GMR-α does not affect high affinity GM-CSF binding (19Polotskaya A. Zhao Y. Lilly M.L. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14607-14613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of both chains of human GMR has been shown to confer GM-CSF responsiveness to the murine fibroblast cell line NIH-3T3 and the pro-B cell line BaF3 (16Rajotte D. Sadowski H.B. Haman A. Gopalbhai K. Meloche S. Liu L. Krystal G. Hoang T. Blood. 1996; 88 (in press)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Watanabe S. Mui A.L.-F. Muto A. Chen J.X. Hayashida K. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Arai K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), indicating a conservation of signal transduction pathways. Interestingly, the β chain, referred to as β common or βc, is shared with interleukin-3 and −5 (IL-3 and IL-5), two cytokines that exhibit significant overlap in biological activity with GM-CSF (for review, see Ref. 22Miyajima A. Mui A.L.-F. Ogorochi T. Sakamaki K. Blood. 1993; 82: 1960-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domains of IL-3R, GMR, and IL-5R α chains also share a highly conserved stretch of amino acids just after the transmembrane domain (23Kitamura T. Sato N. Arai K. Miyajima A. Cell. 1991; 66: 1165-1174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In parallel, IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15 have also been shown to associate with their cognate receptors with similar heteromeric dynamics (24Kawahara A. Minami Y. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5433-5440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Giri J.G. Ahdieh M. Eisenman J. Shanabeck K. Grabstein K. Kumaki S. Namen A. Park L.S. Cosman D. Anderson D.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2663-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), each one binding a specific α or β chain and sharing a common γ chain. Finally, another family of cytokines, IL-6, IL-11, oncostatin M, ciliary neutrotrophic factor and leukemia inhibitory factor, also bind to receptors that share common subunits, gp130 or leukemia inhibitory factor receptor α (27; for review see Ref. 28Kishimoto T. Akira S. Taga T. Science. 1992; 258: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Thus, receptor permutation and matching appears to be a recurring theme for cytokines with overlapping biological activities. Our previous work indicates that GMR-α, -βc, and GM-CSF associate in stoichiometric proportion to form a high affinity slowly dissociating ternary complex (13Hoang T. De Léan A. Haman A. Beauchemin V. Kitamura T. Clark S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11881-11887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, IL-6 has been shown to form hexamers in solution with IL-6R and gp130 in the proportion 2:2:2 (27Paonessa G. Graziani R. De Serio A. Savino R. Ciapponi L. Lahm A. Salvati A.L. Toniatti C. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1942-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ectopic expression of βc with a point mutation in the transmembrane domain (V449E) has been shown to confer ligand-independent growth to the hemopoietic cell line FDC-P1 (29Jenkins B.J. D'Andrea R. Gonda T.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4276-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). By analogy with a similar mutation in neu, it is suggested that the V449E mutation triggers constitutive βc homodimerization and, by extrapolation, that wild type (w/t) βc may also be able to form homodimers. There is, however, no direct evidence for a higher order of receptor association. In the present study, affinity cross-linking indicates the presence of both α and βc dimers within the GMR complex. Our data also indicate that α can homodimerize in the presence of ligand, even when βc is absent. Using functional assays, we provide evidence that a GMR-α truncated in its cytoplasmic domain acts as a dominant negative mutant over w/t GMR-α, suggesting higher order association and a functional role for the oligomerization of GMR-α.

Fragments were separated by size using gel chromatography, by charge using ion-exchange chromatography, and by size/charge using electrophoresis and then characterized by stepwise degradations from the nonreducing end by using mercuric acetate to remove all terminal ΔGlyUA, by bacterial glycuronidase to remove the same residue when linked to unsulfated or 6-O-sulfated GalNAc/Gal, by mammalian 4-sulfatase to remove sulfate from terminal GalNAc 4-O-sulfate, by chondro-4-sulfatase to remove 4-O-sulfate from other GalNAc/Gal residues, and by β-galactosidase to remove terminal Gal. Results with CS from bovine nasal cartilage aggrecan show that, in nearly all chains, Xyl and probably also the first Gal are unsubstituted, whereas the second Gal is 4-O-sulfated in one CS chain out of five. The first disaccharide repeat is sulfated at C-4 of GalNAc in one chain out of three and unsulfated in the other two. A sulfated first disaccharide is always joined to an unsulfated GlcUA-Gal-Gal sequence. In contrast, CS from human articular cartilage usually has a sulfated first disaccharide repeat. In CS from young human cartilage, sulfate groups are mostly at C-4 of GalNAc in the major part of the chain, but at C-6 in the nonreducing distal portion. In CS from old cartilage, sulfation at C-6 of GalNAc is a major feature from the nonreducing end down to approximately positions 4 and 5 from the linkage region, where GalNAc 4-O-sulfate is common. Aggrecan-derived chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains, released by β-elimination, were derivatized with p-aminobenzoic acid or p-aminophenol; radioiodinated; and subjected to graded or complete degradations by chondroitin ABC lyase to generate linkage region fragments of the basic structure ΔGlyUA-GalNAc-GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-R (where ΔGlyUA represents 4,5-unsaturated glycuronic acid, and R is the adduct), by chondroitin AC lyase to generate the shorter fragment ΔGlyUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-R, or by chondroitin C lyase to generate the same fragment when it was linked to a 6-O-sulfated or unsulfated GalNAc at the nonreducing end.

Proteoglycans constitute a family of proteins that are characterized by the presence of covalently attached glycosaminoglycan (GAG) 1The abbreviations used are: GAGglycosaminoglycanCSchondroitin sulfateDSdermatan sulfateGlyUAglycuronic (hexuronic) acidΔGlyUA4,5-unsaturated GlyUAIdoUAiduronic acid4S4-O-sulfate6S6-O-sulfate. side chains and are found at cell surfaces, in pericellular matrices, and especially in the extracellular matrix of connective tissues. Proteoglycans are structurally diverse; core proteins may vary in size from 10 to 400 kDa, and they can contain only a single GAG chain or well over 100. The GAG chains have unique biophysical properties that contribute to the bulk effects of proteoglycans, but they also contain a variety of binding sites for various extracellular cytokines, growth factors, enzymes, and inhibitors (for reviews, see Ref. 1Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar, 2Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev.

The GAG chains are linear polymers of repeating disaccharides containing hexosamine and hexuronic acid (or, in the case of keratan sulfate, galactose). Hexuronic acid-containing GAGs are bound to serine residues in the core protein via the common carbohydrate sequence −4GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-, forming the so-called GAG-protein linkage region, which was shown by Rodén and co-workers over 30 years ago (for review, see Ref. 5Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Press, New York1980: 267-355Crossref Google Scholar). This structure serves as the primer for chain elongation to form either (−4GlcUAβ1-4GlcNAcα1-)n, the core polymer in heparan sulfate/heparin, or (−4GlcUAβ1-3GalNAcβ1-)n, the corresponding one in chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS). Subsequent modifications of galactosaminoglycan chains by different kinds of O-sulfation and by C-5 epimerization of GlcUA to IdoUA, all in an incomplete and sporadic manner, generate a bewildering complexity. Theoretically, such sequences can encode considerable information, but it is not known if mechanisms for deciphering this information exist. Sequence analysis of GAGs, as of other oligo- and polysaccharides, is hampered by the fact that the monosaccharides, apart from their ability to assume different ring shapes, can be joined via different types of linkages, varying in anomeric configuration and position. Hence, a general sequencing strategy (as in polynucleotide and polypeptide sequencing) cannot be applied (6Laine R. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). GAGs can only be sequenced by slow and cumbersome biochemical procedures or by technologies, such as NMR or mass spectrometry, that may not be readily available. CS and DS chains are present in both large and small proteoglycans. The large cartilage proteoglycan aggrecan contains CS, whereas the small ubiquitous proteoglycans decorin and biglycan can contain either CS or DS: one chain in decorin and two in biglycan. We have recently developed procedures for sequence analysis of CS/DS that include coupling of an iodinatable compound to the reducing end of released GAG chains, followed by radiolabeling of the adduct and graded degradation of the chains by various specific enzymatic or chemical methods. Fragments extending from the radiolabeled reducing end to the point of cleavage are separated by high-resolution gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and identified after blotting and autoradiography (7Fransson L.-Å. Havsmark B. Silverberg I. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This procedure has been applied to CS from aggrecan (8Cheng F. Yoshida K. Heinegård D. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and to CS/DS from decorin and biglycan (9Cheng F. Heinegård D. Malmström A. Schmidtchen A. Yoshida K. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These analyses revealed nonrandom positioning of 4- and 6-O-sulfated GalNAc in CS and a periodic, wave-like, and tissue-specific distribution pattern for both sulfate- and IdoUA- and GlcUA-containing repeats in DS. Similar strategies have been used by Linhardt and co-workers (10Liu J. Desai U.R. Han X.-J. Toida T. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in their sequence analysis of heparin. The CS-protein linkage region in aggrecan can also contain various types of substitutions. Rat chondrosarcoma aggrecan CS, which has 4-O-sulfated GalNAc moieties, can also carry small amounts of 4-O-sulfate on the second Gal (11Sugahara K. Yamashina I. de Waard P. Van Halbeek H.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6548-6555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also observed that the first disaccharide repeat was mostly unsulfated, and more so if the preceding xylose was phosphorylated. From the CS-substituted trypsin inhibitors of urine and plasma (15Yamada S. Oyama M. Kinugasa H. Nakagawa T. Kawasaki T. Nakasawa S. Khoo K.-H. Morris H.R. Dell A.H. Sugahara K.

Biochem. 1995; 233: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), a uniformly GalNAc 4-O-sulfated and Gal 4-O-sulfated linkage region was obtained. In shark cartilage aggrecan CS, which has mainly 6-O-sulfated GalNAc, the first Gal of the linkage region and sometimes both the first and second Gal can carry 6-O-sulfate (17Sugahara K. Ohi Y.

The significance (if any) of these variations in the substitution pattern of the linkage region, e.g. for regulation of the assembly of GAG chains, is unknown. Simple methods that permit screening of sequence variation are necessary in order to relate structural microheterogeneity in GAGs to various biological parameters. Such a parameter could be age, as old cartilage contains more 6-O-sulfated CS than young cartilage (19Kaplan D. Meyer K. Nature. 1959; 183: 1267-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Mathews M.B. Glagov S. J. Clin. Invest. 1966; 45: 1103-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 21Bayliss M. Davidson C. Woodhouse S.M. Osborne D.J. Acta Orthop. Scand. 1995; 66: 22-25Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In our previous sequencing studies of aggrecan CS (8Cheng F. Yoshida K. Heinegård D. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and decorin DS (9Cheng F. Heinegård D. Malmström A. Schmidtchen A. Yoshida K. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we detected charge variants of the linkage region fragments. In this study, such fragments derived from bovine nasal cartilage aggrecan have been characterized by using various specific exo-degrading enzymes and by chemical means. The fragments have then been used as reference compounds in an analysis of aggrecan CS from young and old human articular cartilage. Aggrecans (A1 or A1-D1) from bovine nasal cartilage or human articular cartilage (newborn and 63-year-old) were prepared by previously established procedures (22Heinegård D. Sommarin Y. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 319-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 23Bayliss M.B. Ali S.Y. Biochem. J. 1978; 176: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).

Phenyl-O-β-D-galactopyranoside, p-aminobenzoic acid, and p-aminophenol were from Fluka, and 125I-labeled p-hydroxyphenyl-O-β-D-xylopyranoside was prepared as described (25Fransson L.-Å. Karlsson P. Schmidtchen A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1137: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The disaccharide ΔGlyUA-GalNAc-4S was generated from CS-4S by exhaustive digestion with chondroitin ABC lyase (see below). Chondroitin ABC (EC 4.2.2.4), AC-I or AC-II (EC 4.2.2.5), and C lyases (no assigned EC number) as well as chondro-4-sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.9) were from Seikagaku Corp., and Escherichia coli β-galactosidase IX (EC 3.2.1.23) was from Sigma. Chondroglycuronidase (no assigned EC number), which acts on terminal ΔGlyUAβ1-3GalNAc linkages, was prepared from Flavobacterium heparinum as described (26Ototani N. Yosizawa Z. Carbohydr. Res. 1987; 159: 25-36Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). One unit of this enzyme cleaves 1 μmol/min ΔGlyUA-GalNAc-6S or ΔGlyUA-GalNAc under specified conditions (see below). The glycuronidase does not cleave ΔGlyUA-GalNAc-4S (27Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3580-3588Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 28Habuchi O. Sugiura K. Kawai N. Suzuki S. J. Biol.

An amount of enzyme preparation corresponding to ∼50 milliunits had no detectable β-galactosidase activity as tested with p-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactoside at pH 7.6 and 37°C for 18 h. Recombinant mammalian N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase was prepared as described (29Anson D.S. Taylor J.A. Bielicki J. Harper G.S. Peters C. Gibson G.J. Hopwood J.J. Biochem.

One μl of a 1:200 dilution hydrolyzed ∼300 pmol of GalNAc-(4S)-GlcUA-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactitol-4S in 1 h under specified conditions (see below). The column media were Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and Bio-Gel P-6 and P-2 (Bio-Rad). Other special chemicals, membranes, and films were the same as described earlier (7Fransson L.-Å. Havsmark B. Silverberg I. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 8Cheng F. Yoshida K. Heinegård D. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The procedures have been described in detail previously (7Fransson L.-Å. Havsmark B. Silverberg I. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 8Cheng F. Yoshida K.

Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Chondroitin sulfate chains were released by alkaline scission of the Xyl-Ser bond, and the reducing terminal Xyl was coupled by reductive amination to either p-aminobenzoic acid or p-aminophenol. Chains derivatized with p-aminobenzoic acid were radioiodinated under acidic conditions (8Cheng F. Yoshida K. Heinegård D. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), whereas the phenol adduct was iodinated at neutral pH (7Fransson L.-Å. Havsmark B. Silverberg I. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Digestions with the chondroitin lyases were carried out as follows. Cleavage of GalNAc-GlyUA bonds was achieved using chondroitin ABC lyase in 10 mM EDTA, 0.1 M Tris-HOAc, pH 7.3, and cleavage of GalNAc-GlcUA bonds was achieved using chondroitin AC-I lyase in the same buffer or using chondroitin AC-II lyase in 50 mM NaOAc, pH 6.0, all at 37°C. GalNAc-GlcUA bonds involving unsulfated or 6-O-sulfated GalNAc were cleaved with chondroitin C lyase in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 50°C. In all cases, digestions were monitored by measurement of absorbance at 232 nm as described by Suzuki (27Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3580-3588Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Nonreducing terminal ΔGlyUA was degraded by treatment with Hg(OAc)2 as described by Ludwigs et al. (30Ludwigs U. Elgavish A. Esko J.D. Meezan E. Rodén L. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Twenty μg of ΔGlyUA-GalNAc-4S disaccharide was added as carrier. Unsulfated, nonreducing terminal ΔGlyUA linked to unsulfated or 6-O-sulfated GalNAc/Gal was removed by treatment with chondroglycuronidase in 0.1 M Tris, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.3. Digestion with bacterial chondro-4-sulfatase acting on ΔGlyUA-GalNAc/Gal-4S was carried out in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, containing 0.01% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. 4-O-Sulfate on nonreducing terminal GalNAc was released by treatment with mammalian N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase in 0.2 M sodium formate, pH 3.5, at 37°C. Removal of nonreducing terminal Gal was achieved using β-galactosidase in 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, at 37°C. Gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of oligosaccharides, blotting, and autoradiography were carried out as described previously (7Fransson L.-Å. Havsmark B. Silverberg I. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Gel chromatography was carried out on columns (10 × 1000 mm) of Bio-Gel P-2 or P-6 as described (8Cheng F. Yoshida K. Heinegård D. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Ion-exchange chromatography was performed on columns (10 × 100 mm) of Q-Sepharose Fast Flow connected to a Pharmacia chromatography system and eluted with a linear 160-min gradient of 0-2 M NH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Column effluents were analyzed for 125I using a 1271 Ria-Gamma counter. CS chains released by β-elimination, derivatized with p-aminobenzoic acid, and radioiodinated were degraded by treatment with chondroitin ABC or AC (type I or II) lyase, followed by gel chromatography on Bio-Gel P-6 (Fig. 1). A nearly complete ABC lyase digest (Fig. 1a) contained saccharides of the general carbohydrate backbone structure ΔGlyUA-(GalNAc-GlcUA)n-Gal-Gal-Xyl-R (where n = 1, 2, 3, etc., and R = radioiodinated reducing terminal adduct). Exhaustive digestions with AC lyase generated a shorter fragment, corresponding to n = 0 in the above structure, in accordance with the known specificity of the enzyme. To separate charge variants of the linkage region saccharides, they were subjected to ion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose (Fig. 2). The saccharide pool ΔGlyUA-GalNAc-GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-R (n = 1) (Fig. 2a) separated into one low-charged (pool A) and one high-charged (pool B) fraction in approximately equal proportions. The saccharide pool ΔGlyUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-R (n = 0) (Fig. 2b) also yielded two fractions (pools A and B), but in a ratio of ∼4:1.Fig. 2Isolation of charge variants of chondroitin sulfate-protein linkage region saccharides from bovine nasal cartilage aggrecan. Saccharides with the carbohydrate backbone ΔGlyUA-GalNAc-GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-R (n = 1) and ΔGlyUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-R (n = 0) were obtained by exhaustive digestions with chondroitin ABC lyase and chondroitin AC lyase (either type I or II), respectively, followed by gel chromatography on Bio-Gel P-6 (as described in the legend to Fig. 1). Material derived from 3 mg of CS and containing 6 × 107 cpm of 125I was used. Separation into charge variants was achieved by ion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose Fast Flow, yielding two major forms (pools A and B) in each case (pooled as indicated by bars and freeze-dried). a, saccharide with n = 1; b, saccharide with n = 0; c, saccharide with n = 0 (pool A) further digested with glycuronidase (1 unit of enzyme in 100 μl of buffer for 72 h at 37°C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The low-charged linkage region tetrasaccharide ΔGlyUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-R (n = 0) (pool A in Fig. 2b) was treated with glycuronidase to remove the charged, nonreducing terminal residue and then rechromatographed on Q-Sepharose (Fig. 2c). It is shown that the saccharide was completely degraded to a component of even lower charge density, which should correspond to Gal-Gal-Xyl-R with one remaining negative charge in R. The structure of the tetrasaccharide was confirmed by stepwise removal of monosaccharides from the nonreducing end, followed by gel chromatography on Bio-Gel P-2. As shown in Fig. 3, the size was gradually diminished by successive treatments with glycuronidase (panel b) and then with β-galactosidase (panel c). The final product, the expected Xyl-R, emerged in the same position as phenyl-O-β-D-galactopyranoside. The various fragments were also subjected to electrophoresis, which separates both according to size and charge (Fig. 4). The intact, low-charged linkage region saccharide ΔGlyUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-R (n = 0) (pool A) is shown in lane 1. After removal of the charged, nonreducing terminal residue ΔGlyUA using glycuronidase, the trisaccharide product Gal-Gal-Xyl-R was obtained (lane 2). Although it is smaller, it migrated more slowly because it had a much lower charge density (−1/3) than the initial tetrasaccharide (−2/4). After further degradation using β-galactosidase (lane 3), the Xyl-R product migrated faster than the previous ones because it both was smaller and had an increased charge density (−1/1).Fig. 4Structure determination of charge variants of the linkage region saccharide ΔGlyUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-R from bovine nasal cartilage aggrecan.

Two minor, even faster moving components were also observed. All high-charged forms of saccharide (n = 0), except the one with the highest charge, were resistant to digestion with glycuronidase (lane 5), suggesting a preponderance of 4-O-sulfate on the second Gal. This was confirmed by treatment with chondro-4-sulfatase (lane 6). All three components lost one charge, and the major one migrated like unsulfated ΔGlyUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-R (see also Ref. 31Sugahara K. Masuda M. Harada T. Yamashina I. de Waard P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The charged, nonreducing terminal residue ΔGlyUA of the high-charged saccharides was removed by treatment with Hg(OAc)2, and products with slightly retarded mobilities were obtained (lane 7). Repeated digestions of the mercury-treated material with excessive amounts of mammalian exo-4-sulfatase (lane 8) generated only trace amounts of Gal-Gal-Xyl-R, suggesting that mammalian exo-4-sulfatase is specific for GalNAc-4S. The linkage region hexasaccharide ΔGlyUA-GalNAc-GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-R (n = 1) obtained after digestion with chondroitin ABC lyase comprised approximately equal proportions of low- and high-charged variants (pools A and B in Fig. 2a). Electrophoretic analysis (Fig. 5) revealed that each pool contained one major, slow-moving (lane 1) or fast-moving (lane 4) component. The slow-moving, low-charged hexasaccharide (lane 1) was sensitive to glycuronidase, and the pentasaccharide product obtained migrated to a more retarded position (lane 2). Apparently, reduction in charge density (from −3/6 to −2/5, i.e. a 20% change) had a greater effect on electrophoretic mobility than reduction in size, which was 16%. The terminal ΔGlyUA-GalNAc disaccharide repeat was removed by treatment with chondroitin AC-II lyase (lane 3), and the tetrasaccharide product obtained migrated to the same position as ΔGlyUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-R (Fig. 4, lane 1). Removal of one charged and one uncharged residue reduces size (by 33%), but does not alter charge density. The conclusion from these experiments is that ∼50% of the linkage region in bovine nasal cartilage aggrecan CS consists of an unsulfated hexasaccharide sequence, -GlcUA-GalNAc-GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl- (Structure I in Table I), and was obtained as the low-charged hexasaccharide pool A in Fig. 2a. The other 50% of the linkage region was obtained in the high-charged hexasaccharide pool B in Fig. 2a (Fig. 5, lane 4). The charged, nonreducing terminal residue ΔGlyUA of the high-charged variants was removed by treatment with Hg(OAc)2, and the resulting pentasaccharide products migrated to more retarded positions (lane 5). The major variant appeared to be monosulfated, either at GalNAc or at the second Gal (see structures on the right in Fig. 5). The pentasaccharides were then treated exhaustively with exo-4-sulfatase, but only a partial effect was obtained (lane 6). We therefore conclude that the original high-charged hexasaccharide pool comprised two major isomers, one with sulfate at C-4 of GalNAc and another with sulfate at C-4 of the second Gal; the former was sensitive to exo-4-sulfatase and generated an unsulfated pentasaccharide, GalNAc-GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-R (see also structures on the right in Fig. 5). Both the high-charged hexasaccharide isomer with GalNAc-4S and the entire pool of unsulfated hexasaccharide (the latter amounted to 50% of total linkage region material) would generate unsulfated tetrasaccharide linkage region fragments after treatment with chondroitin AC lyase (see above). As the unsulfated tetrasaccharide products amounted to 80% of the linkage region material, the two monosulfated hexasaccharide isomers should represent 30% (the GalNAc 4-O-sulfated isomer) and 20% (the Gal 4-O-sulfated isomer) of the total, respectively (Structures II and III in Table I). Di-, tri-, or tetrasulfated hexasaccharides (Structures IV-VI) are rare. As 50% of the linkage region in bovine nasal cartilage aggrecan CS was unsulfated (Structure I), half of the chains should be sensitive to chondroitin C lyase, which cleaves at both unsulfated and 6-O-sulfated GalNAc (32Yoshida K.

However, as shown previously (8Cheng F. Yoshida K. Heinegård D. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), very little linkage region tetrasaccharide (n = 0) is released by C lyase. This suggests that C lyase requires a 6-O-sulfate on the second GalNAc in the sequence -GlcUA-GalNAc-GlcUA-GalNAc-GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl- in order to cleave between an unsulfated first GalNAc and GlcUA linked to Gal.Table I.Yields of various possible chondroitin sulfate-protein linkage region saccharides from bovine nasal cartilage aggrecanStructureTotal%I.

Open table in a new tab To determine if the first Gal and/or Xyl was substituted with charged groups, a different approach was taken. CS chains were coupled to an uncharged iodinatable compound, i.e. p-aminophenol, to avoid repulsion from possible phosphate esters on Xyl. The end-labeled CS was treated with alkaline phosphatase (33Fransson L.-Å. Silverberg I. Carlstedt I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14722-14726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after digestion with chondroitin AC-II lyase. Analysis by electrophoresis (data not shown) indicated that the linkage region saccharides were the same in phosphatase-treated and in untreated samples. The low-charged tetrasaccharide ΔGlyUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-R′, where R′ is now uncharged, was isolated as in Fig. 2b, treated with glycuronidase, and subjected to electrophoresis, followed by direct autoradiography, omitting the transfer-blotting step. The uncharged trisaccharide product migrated only a short distance, and had the same mobility as 125I-labeled p-hydroxyphenyl-O-β-D-xylopyranoside (data not shown). Hence, Xyl and the first Gal in bovine nasal aggrecan CS were mostly unsubstituted (see also Table I). It is possible that phosphorylation of Xyl is required for chain biosynthesis and/or intracellular progression and that it is followed by dephosphorylation just before or shortly after secretion. CS chains derived from aggrecan of young or old cartilage were released by β-elimination, derivatized with p-aminobenzoic acid, radioiodinated, and subjected to degradation by chondroitin AC-I or C lyase, followed by gel chromatography on Bio-Gel P-6 (Fig. 6). AC lyase cleaves hexosaminidic bonds to GlcUA when GalNAc is either 4- or 6-O-sulfated, whereas C lyase cleaves only when GalNAc is unsulfated or 6-O-sulfated (32Yoshida K. Arai M. Kohno Y. Mayema K.-i. Miyazono H. Kikuchi H. Morikawa K. Tawada A. Suzuki S. Scott J.E. Dermatan Sulphate Proteoglycans. Portland Press Ltd., London1993: 55-70Google Scholar). Exhaustive digestion with AC-I lyase generated the linkage region tetrasaccharide ΔGlyUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-R (n = 0) in both cases (Fig. 6, a and c). In contrast, chondroitin C lyase degraded CS from young cartilage less extensively (Fig. 6b) than did AC lyase (Fig. 6a), in keeping with the presence of substantial amounts of GalNAc-4S in CS from young cartilage. CS from old cartilage (Fig. 6d), which contains a greater proportion of 6-O-sulfated GalNAc, was degraded more extensively. The latter results indicated that GalNAc-4S was concentrated to the first three disaccharide repeats of CS from old cartilage (represented by fragments n = 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 6d), whereas 6-O-sulfated (or unsulfated) GalNAc was dominant from the fourth position onward. Charge variants of these linkage region tetrasaccharides were detected by electrophoresis. The tetrasaccharides (n = 0) released by AC-I lyase (Fig. 7a) comprised one dominating component (marked with 0) with the mobility of unsubstituted ΔGlyUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-R (cf. Fig. 4, lane 1) and two to three minor, high-mobility variants, which may contain sulfated Gal as well as other charged substituents. Their relative mobilities suggested that the double band represented isomeric, monosulfated variants and that the fast-moving one was disulfated. In CS from old cartilage, the high-mobility variants were somewhat more prominent. Corresponding tetrasaccharides (n = 0) released by C lyase were almost exclusively of the low-mobility type (Fig. 7b), indicating that sulfated -GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-Ser sequences must be preferentially extended with 4-O-sulfated disaccharide repeats in position 1. Despite exhaustive treatment with AC-I lyase (Fig. 6, a and c), small amounts of the linkage region hexasaccharide ΔGlyUA-GalNAc-GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-R remained undegraded, more so in material from young cartilage. When these were examined by electrophoresis (Fig. 7c), several components were detected. There were two minor, slow-moving components (the top two bands marked with 1) with the mobilities of unsulfated and monosulfated hexasaccharide, respectively (cf. Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 4). These components were also generated by cleavage with C lyase (Fig. 7d), suggesting that they carried 6-O-sulfated GalNAc also in the succeeding disaccharide (position 2). Both components could be the result of incomplete digestion. However, the most prominent components in the linkage region hexasaccharide pool (Fig. 7c) were very fast moving (see, for example, the bottom band marked with 1), suggesting sulfation also on the first GlcUA and a high degree of sulfation in the first disaccharide repeat, both of which may decrease the rate of cleavage by AC-I lyase (32Yoshida K. Arai M. Kohno Y. Mayema K.-i. Miyazono H. Kikuchi H. Morikawa K. Tawada A. Suzuki S. Scott J.E. Dermatan Sulphate Proteoglycans. Portland Press Ltd., London1993: 55-70Google Scholar). Very little high-mobility hexasaccharide was released by C lyase (see the bottom band marked with 1 in Fig. 7d), indicating that an oversulfated linkage region hexasaccharide sequence can be succeeded by largely 4-O-sulfated disaccharides in position 2. When C lyase cleaves between GalNAc-6S and GlcUA, there is no need for 6-O-sulfate in the disaccharide linked at the nonreducing side (32Yoshida K. Arai M. Kohno Y. Mayema K.-i. Miyazono H. Kikuchi H. Morikawa K. Tawada A. Suzuki S. Scott J.E. Dermatan Sulphate Proteoglycans. Portland Press Ltd., London1993: 55-70Google Scholar). Linkage region extended with two consecutive GalNAc 4-O-sulfated disaccharide repeats was analyzed in Fig. 7e, and four to six major components were observed. At least half of them (migrating as the component marked with 2 or faster) must contain oversulfated disaccharides. Analogous results were obtained with saccharides containing three consecutive GlcUA-GalNAc-4S repeats (Fig. 7f). The small amounts of material obtained precluded further detailed analysis. To further examine the linkage region and the first disaccharide repeat in aggrecan CS from old cartilage, we used a chain preparation that was derivatized with the uncharged adduct p-aminophenol, radioiodinated, and then exhaustively degraded with AC-II lyase (to obtain the tetrasaccharide ΔGlyUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-R′) or with ABC lyase (to obtain the hexasaccharide ΔGlyUA-GalNAc-GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-R′). The tetrasaccharide was subjected to ion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose (as in Fig. 2; data not shown), and the major charge variant (90% of total material) migrated as a tetrasaccharide with one negative charge, i.e. the carboxylate on ΔGlyUA (data not shown). This indicates that both the Xyl and Gal residues in aggrecan CS from old cartilage were mostly unsubstituted. The hexasaccharide linkage region fragments that included the first disaccharide repeat comprised one major and a few minor components (data not shown). The major component migrated as a monosulfated hexasaccharide. The minor components included unsulfated, low-mobility hexasaccharide and a couple of presumably oversulfated, high-mobility ones. The nonreducing terminal ΔGlyUA-GalNAc repeat in the major hexasaccharide component was degraded by either Hg(OAc)2 treatment or glycuronidase digestion. Mercury treatment yielded pentasaccharide that migrated to a more retarded position. Digestion with glycuronidase generated two components; one was resistant to the enzyme, and the other was a pentasaccharide (data not shown). The pentasaccharide generated by glycuronidase should be 6-O-sulfated at GalNAc, whereas the resistant hexasaccharide should contain 4-O-sulfated GalNAc. Hence, the first disaccharide repeat in human articular cartilage aggrecan CS is mostly sulfated, either at C-4 or C-6 of GalNAc. The structures proposed for various linkage region fragments obtained from aggrecan CS of young and old human articular cartilage are summarized in Table II. Structures VII-XI represent segments that, upon degradation by C lyase, would generate linkage region fragments extended with no (VII), one (VIII), two (IX), or three (X) 4-O-sulfated disaccharide repeats. From the results obtained in Fig. 6, Fig. 7, the amounts of saccharides derived from these structures were calculated. In CS from young cartilage, Structures VII-IX accounted for 18, 16, and 14% of the linkage region variants, respectively, whereas the majority of the linkage region was recovered in long 4-O-sulfated segments like Structure X (24%) or higher saccharides (28%). In aggrecan CS from old cartilage, the 6-O-sulfated GalNAc moieties were more frequent and dominated from the nonreducing end down to the vicinity of the linkage region. The majority of the linkage region fragments were recovered as Structures VII-X (81%). Small amounts of Structure XI with, most likely, additional sulfate in one of the Gal moieties and possibly also on GlcUA should also be included.Table II.Proposed structures of chondroitin sulfate-protein linkage region saccharides from aggrecan of young and old human articular cartilageStructuresTotalYoungOld%S S 6SVII.

Open table in a new tab By using the different charge variants of linkage region saccharides as reference compounds, we examined the electrophoretic banding patterns obtained from whole graded enzymatic digests of articular cartilage aggrecan CS (Fig. 8). CS from young cartilage was treated with AC-II lyase (Fig. 8a), and as expected, bands representing the shortest fragments, i.e. tetrasaccharides (n = 0), increased in intensity with time. Most of these were unsubstituted (see right side of panels a and b in Fig. 8), but minor bands representing tetrasaccharides with, most likely, one, two, or three sulfate groups were also observed. The saccharide with two sulfates appeared as a double band, probably because there were two isomers. A saccharide with three sulfates must be sulfated on both Gal residues and on GlcUA. Saccharides with n = 1 persisted for up to 4 h of digestion and then disappeared; saccharides with n = 2, 3, etc. disappeared gradually at earlier time points. The electrophoretogram thus revealed the presence of three overlapping series of saccharides. One started with monosulfated ΔGlyUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-R (see right side of panel b in Fig. 8) and included a series of saccharides extended with n = 1, 2, 3, etc. sulfated disaccharide repeats. A second one appeared to be based on monosulfated (or possibly more highly sulfated) ΔGlyUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-R extended with sulfated disaccharides (numbers indicated in brackets). A third one could be an extension of unsulfated ΔGlyUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-R with likewise unsulfated disaccharide repeats (numbers indicated in parentheses). However, the vast majority of the chains must consist of unsulfated ΔGlyUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-R extended with sulfated disaccharide repeats. Similar time course analyses were made with C lyase digests of CS from young (data not shown) or old (Fig. 8b) cartilage. CS from young cartilage was rapidly degraded from the nonreducing end, indicating that 6-O-sulfated GalNAc moieties were concentrated to the peripheral end of the chains. In CS from old cartilage (Fig. 8b), the patterns confirmed the preponderance of 6-O-sulfated disaccharides from positions 4 and 5 onward as well as a high degree of oversulfation in and near the linkage region. The present strategy for sequence analysis of glycosaminoglycan chains should permit screening of glycans obtained from different sources and produced under various biological circumstances. Microheterogeneity due to variable substitution of Xyl with phosphate at C-2, of the Gal residues with sulfate at C-4 or C-6, of the first GlcUA with sulfate at C-2 or C-3, as well as un-, mono-, or disulfation of the first repeating GlcUA-GalNAc disaccharide, can be detected. It should be of interest to examine how (and if) microheterogeneity, especially in segments near the core protein, is related to nonrandom variations in the distal part of a chain.

6-methylguanine (m6dG) lesions by mammalian DNA polymerase β (pol β) during short patch repair may contribute to the cytotoxicity and mutagenesis of m6dG. We have employed in vitro steady state kinetic analysis to investigate the replication of oligonucleotide templates containing site-specific m6dG by human pol β. Our results show that m6dG is a strong but not absolute block to replication by pol β. pol β exhibits mixed kinetic discrimination during overall replication across dG and m6dG. pol β preferentially inserts dTMP rather than dCMP opposite m6dG. However, pol β extends from the dC-m6dG base pair more efficiently than from the dT-m6dG base pair. This is in strong contrast to other polymerases such as the exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (exo−KF) that preferentially extends dT-m6dG by a factor of 10 over dC-m6dG. When both insertion and extension are considered, pol β has a 15-fold overall preference for incorporation of the mutagenic substrate dTTP rather than the nonmutagenic substrate dCTP during replication across m6dG. This suggests that pol β, in concert with the T:G-specific thymine DNA glycosylase, may be intricately involved in the futile cytotoxic repair induced by m6dG. Our results also suggest that replication across m6dG by pol β may contribute to m6dG-induced G → A transition mutations."

The barrel-shaped structure (point group symmetry 32) has major and minor axes of ∼245 × 220 Å, respectively, and consists of two different subunits organized in an α6β6 complex (Mr = 2.5 × 106). Two sets of three β subunits form triangle-shaped caps that enclose the ends of the barrel. The wall of the barrel appears to consist of three N-shaped α subunit pairs each with an over and underlying arch-shaped β subunit. Inside the molecule there are three major interconnected cavities that are tilted ∼20° with respect to its major axis. An axle-shaped structure extends the length of the cavity on the 3-fold axis and is connected to the two ends of the barrel. The cavities are partially divided on the equator of the molecule by three spokes that extend from the axle on the 2-fold axis to the exterior wall. We propose that these six cavities constitute the six equivalent sites of fatty acid synthesis resulting in an extraordinary structure-function relationship with the 42 catalytic sites involved in fatty acid synthesis inside the molecule. The six cavities each have two funnel-shaped openings (∼20 Å in diameter) which may serve to permit the diffusion of substrates and products in and out of these functional units.

We propose that these six cavities constitute the six equivalent sites of fatty acid synthesis resulting in an extraordinary structure-function relationship with the 42 catalytic sites involved in fatty acid synthesis inside the molecule. The six cavities each have two funnel-shaped openings (∼20 Å in diameter) which may serve to permit the diffusion of substrates and products in and out of these functional units. The subunits appear to be arranged in a manner that affords extensive intermolecular interactions contributing to the stability of this macromolecular complex. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae fatty acid synthase is a multienzyme complex (Mr = 2.5 × 106) consisting of six copies each of α (Mr = 207,863) and β (Mr = 220,077) subunits (α6β6) (1Mohamed A.H.

The subunits are multifunctional enzymes since they consist of multiple catalytic domains that comprise the seven catalytic activities associated with fatty acid synthesis. Even though the distribution and the order of their activities from amino to carboxyl termini in the α and β subunits are known (1Mohamed A.H. Chirala S.S. Mody N.H. Huang W.-Y. Wakil S.J. J. Biol.

The molecule has a high protein density band at its equator and protein density on its major axis that appears in the center of the ring-shaped end views of the structure. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that the α subunits are located in a central region of the oval-shaped particle images, and the β subunits are distributed on its two ends (6Wieland F. Siess E.A.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6598-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and the kinetics and stoichiometry of its reaction with the substrate analog p-nitrophenyl thioacetate support the proposal that the molecule comprises six equivalent centers of fatty acid synthesis each with its seven catalytic domains (11Stoops J.K. Singh N. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16971-16977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is not an exaggeration to describe the molecule as a proficient factory for fatty acid synthesis. These remarkable functional characteristics serve to heighten interest in the molecule's structural organization which the above electron microscopy studies cannot address. Moreover, three-dimensional reconstructions of the fatty acid synthase which consisted of one (12Hoppe W. Schramm H.J. Sturm M. Hunsmann N. Gassman J. Z. Naturforsch. A. 1976; 31: 1380-1390Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and eight particles (8Hackenjos W.-A. Schramm H.J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1987; 368: 19-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) have failed to give significant new information regarding its structure because of their low resolution. These efforts were thwarted by the inability to obtain appropriate alignment of a significant number of side projections of the molecules, which have their major axis parallel to the support film and, consequently, present a continuum of views of the structure. We have developed methods to obtain random orientations of the molecules, and it was determined that the end views of the structure could be readily aligned to obtain the average images described above (9Stoops J.K. Kolodziej S.J. Schroeter J.P. Bretaudiere J.-P. Wakil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6585-6589Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we report the 25 Å resolution structure of the yeast fatty acid synthase which reveals an elaborate structural organization of the subunits and a most unusual structure-function relationship in that apparently all of the catalytic domains reside inside this barrel-like structure. S. cerevisiae fatty acid synthase was assayed as described previously (11Stoops J.K. Singh N. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16971-16977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A yeast cake (Red Star, 670 g) was added to phosphate buffer (0.2 M KPi, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM cysteine, 2 mM benzamidine, 1.7 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, pH 6.5) to give a final volume of 1.5 liters. The mixture was blended for 30 s at low speed to disperse the clumps, and the cells were disrupted using the Bead Beater with its container in an ice bath. It was determined that five 30-s pulses with 30-s intervals to permit cooling resulted in the maximum release of the fatty acid synthase activity in the supernatant. Centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C (for 30 min) yielded the supernatant with a lipid cake on top, which was removed in a cold room by filtering through glass wool. All of the following procedures were performed excluding air using an atmosphere of argon. Polyethylene glycol 8000 (Sigma Chemical Co.) was added to the supernatant with stirring to give a 3.5% (w/v) solution. After centrifugation as above, the polyethylene glycol concentration of the supernatant was increased to 10% (w/v) and, after centrifugation, the resulting pellet contained approximately 70% of the activity. The pellet was dissolved in 250 ml of 0.1 M KPi, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM cysteine, and 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, pH 6.5, and calcium phosphate gel in H20 was added until the fatty acid synthase activity remaining in the supernatant was less than 10%. During the addition, the pH was maintained at 6.5 by the addition of acetic acid. The gel was centrifuged as above and suspended in 0.1 M NaPi, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM cysteine, and 1 mM benzamidine, pH 7.5. After adjusting the pH to 7.5 with 1 M NaOH, the gel was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 45 min. The enzyme in the supernatant was precipitated with 10% polyethylene glycol and centrifuged. The pellet was dissolved in 60 ml of 0.1 M NaPi, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM benzamidine, pH 7.2 by gentle stirring overnight. The enzyme was fractionated by gel filtration chromatography on a Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column (5 × 55 cm) using the same buffer. Fractions containing specific activity greater than 300 nmol of NADPH oxidized min−1 mg−1 were pooled to give a specific activity of ∼1,000 for the combined fractions. The enzyme was precipitated by slowly adding powdered ammonium sulfate (ICN, ultrapure) to 50% of saturation while maintaining the pH at 7.0 by the addition of 1 M NaOH. The enzyme, which had a specific activity of ∼2,000, was stored as a suspension containing 10% glycerol at −10°C or purified further by Superose 6 column chromatography (0.8 × 30 cm) using a fast protein liquid chromatography System (Pharmacia). Enzyme containing specific activity greater than 5,000 nmol of NADPH oxidized min−1 mg−1 was used in these studies and was obtained within 48 h after the start of the isolation. This procedure not only reduced the time of isolation from ∼6 to 2 days but also consistently increased the yield from ∼10 to ∼60 mg compared with our previously developed procedure (2Stoops J.K.

Chem. 1990; 265: 16971-16977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fatty acid synthase (5-10 mg) was dissociated as described previously (14Wieland F. Renner L. Verfürth C. Lynen F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 94: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After reacting with dimethylmaleic anhydride for 30 min at 0°C, the inactive enzyme was equilibrated rapidly with 0.1 M Tris·HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, pH 8.1, by gel filtration using a Sephadex G-75 column (1.1 × 17 cm) to promote complete dissociation of the complex and to stabilize the anhydride derivative of the protein. The resulting protein was characterized by ultracentrifugation, gel filtration chromatography, and electron microscopy. Its s20,w of 3.7 S compares with a value of 9.1 S (15Stoops J.K. Ross P. Arslanian M.J. Aune K.C. Wakil S.J. Oliver R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7418-7426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the monomeric rat liver fatty acid synthase (Mr = 240,000), whereas its elution volume on a Superose 6 column was similar to that for the native yeast fatty acid synthase. The sedimentation coefficient was determined with the Beckman model E analytical ultracentrifuge as described previously (15Stoops J.K. Ross P. Arslanian M.J. Aune K.C. Wakil S.J. Oliver R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7418-7426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that the introduction of the negative charge by the maleyl groups results in not only complete dissociation of the complex but also extensive unfolding of the subunits to assume an extended configuration. Stain electron microscopy showed that the protein had a string-like appearance ∼300 Å in length. The α subunit was separated from β using a Mono Q column (Pharmacia) using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia) and a linear NaCl gradient (0-0.5 M NaCl in 0.1 M Tris·HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, pH 8.0). The α subunit eluted at ∼0.1-0.2 M NaCl, and its purity was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The β subunit was separated from α as described previously (16Stoops J.K. Wakil S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 84: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Immediately after the isolation of the subunits, the maleyl groups were removed, and the enzyme was activated as described with the following modifications (14Wieland F. Renner L. Verfürth C. Lynen F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 94: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Solid ammonium sulfate was added to 70% of saturation, then saturated ammonium sulfate (pH lowered to 2 with acetic acid) was added to lower the pH of the protein suspension to 6.0. After 2.5 h, the protein was centrifuged at 36,000 × g and the pellet resuspended in 0.05 M NaPi, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM cysteine, 1 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate, or 10 μg/ml human α2-macroglobulin, 5% glycerol, pH 7.0 (reactivation buffer) so that its final concentration was ∼0.1 mg/ml. Approximately half of the α subunit was degraded within 48 h at 0°C unless one of the proteinase inhibitors was included in the reactivation buffer. The often used phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride was not effective in preventing proteolysis. Removal of the maleyl groups from the enzyme before separation of the subunits and reactivation in the presence of 10 μM FMN as described above resulted in recovery of 90% of its specific activity, and electron microscopy indicated that the α6β6 structure had reformed. A 240-μl sample of yeast fatty acid synthase (10 μg/ml) in 0.25% methylamine tungstate was applied to Butvar 76 film by the spray method (17Stoops J.K. Momany C. Ernst S.R. Oliver R.M. Schroeter J.P. Bretaudiere J.-P. Hackert M.L. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1991; 18: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To minimize shrinkage of the molecules during beam irradiation (18Kolodziej S.J. Schroeter J.P. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the film was carbon coated on one side before application of the protein. A random distribution of the orientations of the particles was achieved by applying the sample on the Butvar side of the carbon-coated Butvar film. Images were recorded at 100 kV using conventional irradiation procedures. An underfocus of ∼1 μm at the center of the stage was used to record the 50° tilted image and 0.5 μm underfocus for the corresponding nontilted image. The images of the α subunit preparation were prepared for electron microscopy and recorded as described above. The β subunits did not have a consistent shape and were judged unsuitable for image analysis. Digitization of the micrographs was performed as described previously (18Kolodziej S.J. Schroeter J.P. Strickland D.K. Stoops J.K. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The micrographs were checked for underfocus, astigmatism, and drift using a digitally generated power spectrum. Initial image analyses were performed using Silicon Graphics 4D25 and Indigo2 workstations using our SUPRIM (19Schroeter J.P. Bretaudiere J.-P. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) image processing software. The individual images that had a ring shape (end views) were collected from the 0° tilt micrograph together with their corresponding 50° tilted images. Correspondence analysis and hierarchical ascendant classification of the average end view image obtained using a model-based alignment (data set n = 2,035) revealed a small group of images (n = 46) which were significantly different from the grand average; they were discarded. The remaining cluster averages were similar to the grand average, indicating a homogeneous data set. After three passes of alignment a spectral signal to noise resolution (20Unser M. Trus B.L. Steven A.C. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 23: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) of 22 Å was obtained. A three-dimensional reconstruction of the tilted end views was performed by the weighted back projection of a random conical tilt series as described previously (21Radermacher M. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1988; 9: 359-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Side view images were also picked (oval shape with a high density band bisecting its major axis (9Stoops J.K. Kolodziej S.J. Schroeter J.P. Bretaudiere J.-P. Wakil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6585-6589Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)), for subsequent refinement of the three-dimensional structure. The refinement of the SUPRIM reconstruction was carried out using the three-dimensional projection alignment method (22Penczek P.A. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1994; 53: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) implemented in the SPIDER system (23Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). A set of projections was generated by tilting the model 0-90° (θ) and rotating it 0-360° (ϕ) about its major axis in 2° increments (22Penczek P.A. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1994; 53: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The candidate images consisted of 50° tilted end views (n = 1,989) used in the original reconstruction. Two passes of refinement were usually sufficient to achieve a stable resolution value. Orthogonal orientations of the molecules (side views) were incorporated in the reconstruction in two steps. (i) A data set of 50° titled images (n = 137) which were judged to have their major axis approximately perpendicular to the tilt axis in the corresponding nontilted field were incorporated in the candidate list above. The refinement was repeated as described, and (ii) the new model was used to incorporate 554 nontilted side views in the reconstruction. Two successive refinements of the combined data sets (2,676 images) achieved a stable resolution value. The resolution of the reconstructions was estimated by randomly dividing the data sets into halves, and two iterative reconstructions were generated using the same number of iterations and parameters of the reconstruction as those for the complete data set. The resolution was estimated (based on the radius of the spherical shell) by differential phase residual (DPR) 1The abbreviation used is: DFRdifferential phase residual. (24Frank J. Verschoor A. Boublik M. Science. 1981; 214: 1353-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and the Fourier ring correlation methods (25Van Heel M. Stöffler-Meilicke M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2389-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) with a ring correlation coefficient of 0.67 (20Unser M. Trus B.L. Steven A.C. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 23: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) after thresholding the reconstructions to a volume that corresponds to the molecular weight of the fatty acid synthase (Mr = 2.5 × 106). differential phase residual. The three-dimensional reconstructions were displayed as shaded solid surface models using SUPRIM rendering. Selected stereo views of the symmetrized, shaded solid surface and wire frame renderings were generated using SYNU (26Hessler D. Young S.J. Carragher B. Martone M. Hinshaw J. Milligan R. Masliah E. Whittaker M. Lamont S. Ellisman M. Lyman C.E. Peachey L.D. Fisher R.M. Microscopy: The Key Research Tool. EMSA, Milwaukee1992: 73-82Google Scholar). A solid representation of the central cavity was created by excising the exterior and inverting the pixel values. The resulting cavity image was filtered and thresholded at values corresponding to those for the reconstruction. The images were produced using a Mitsubishi S3600-30U dye sublimation color printer. The initial three-dimensional reconstruction of the yeast fatty acid synthase was computed by weighted back projection from a conical tilt series employing the 50° tilted end view images (Fig. 1A). Even though the end view projection of the structure (Fig. 1A) shows a good concordance with the corresponding average image (Fig. 1F), its side view projection lacks the prominent band of protein density that bisects the major axis of the molecule (Fig. 1F). This band of high protein density is also a prominent feature of the individual stain (2Stoops J.K. Awad E.S. Arslanian M.J. Gunsberg S. Wakil S.J. Oliver R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4464-4475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wieland F. Siess E.A. Renner L. Verfürth C. Lynen F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1987; 368: 19-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and frozen-hydrated molecular images (9Stoops J.K. Kolodziej S.J. Schroeter J.P. Bretaudiere J.-P. Wakil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6585-6589Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Instead, a vertical high density band is prominent (Fig. 1A), which may be attributed to the missing cone artifact (27Carazo J.M. Wagenknecht T. Frank J. Biophys. J. 1989; 55: 465-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is apparent that significant structural information is lacking in the equator of the reconstruction where the six α subunits are located (see below). Therefore, we have pursued methods to incorporate the orthogonal side views of the molecules into the reconstruction. Refinement (22Penczek P.A. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1994; 53: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) of the reconstruction reduced the surrounding noise but, not surprisingly, did not improve the concordance between the side view projection (Fig. 1B) and the average image (Fig. 1F). The resolution of the refined reconstruction (25 Å, DPR) represented a modest improvement in the initial reconstruction (27 Å), indicating that the end view images utilized consisted primarily of close to on axis projections of the molecules. An effort to incorporate nontilted side views in the reconstruction using the refined reconstruction (Fig. 1B) as a model failed to align these images. However, it was possible to incorporate 137 tilted 50° side view orientations of the molecules. The resulting reconstruction (Fig. 1C) shows no significant improvement in the concordance between the projection and the average image, but the resulting model had sufficient information in the region of the missing cone to align the nontilted side views appropriately. The entire data set consisting of tilted end views, tilted side views, and untitled side views was combined to give the refined reconstruction in Fig. 1D (resolution = 24 Å). Its end view and side view projections show good concordance with the corresponding average images, indicating that the missing cone artifact has been minimized. Further refinement of the reconstruction shown in Fig. 1D resulted in a slight improvement in the resolution, 22 Å DPR and 20 Å Fourier ring (a similar value of the resolution was also obtained by employing a soft mask and no threshold (28Frank J. Three-dimensional Electron Microscopy of Macromolecular Assemblies. Academic Press, New York1996Crossref Google Scholar), 26 Å DPR). Moreover, some of the minor features such as the three protrusions on the two ends of the structure are better defined (compare Figs. 1D and 2A). The reconstruction (Fig. 2) was low pass Fermi filtered (29Frank J. Verschoor A. Wagenknecht T. Wu T.T. New Methodologies in Studies of Protein Conformation. Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York1985: 36-89Google Scholar) to 25 Å to minimize contrast transfer function effects. A reconstruction was also performed consisting of only 50° tilted images: 1,989 and 682 end and side views, respectively. The resulting structure (24 Å resolution) was very similar to the structure in Fig. 1D in which the corresponding 545 nontilted side views were utilized (data not shown). The inclusion of the orthogonal side views, either tilted or nontilted, in the reconstruction improves its resolution and the concordance between its projections and the average images. Consequently, we conclude that the structural information of the molecule is reproduced faithfully by the methods employed to image it. The average image of the side view (Fig. 1F, right) appears slightly longer (∼8%) than the side view projection of the structure (Fig. 1E, right). This difference may result from the larger number of end views (1,989) than side views (682) used in the refinement or may simply reflect differences in the thresholding. The excellent concordance between the 32 symmetrized (Fig. 2) and nonsymmetrized (Fig. 1D) reconstructions indicates that the molecule has point group symmetry 32. It is also interesting to note that the projection of the end view of the symmetrized reconstruction (Fig. 1E) shows additional features not seen in the average image (Fig. 1F) probably because of its higher resolution. Stereo views of the structure viewed on the 3-fold axis (Fig. 2A) and two presentations on the 2-fold axis, front (Fig. 2B) and back (Fig. 2C) show that the structure is barrel-shaped. The molecule has dimensions of ∼245 × 220 Å. It is capped at both ends by triangle-shaped bodies (∼70 Å on a side) in approximately the same orientation (see below) (Fig. 2A). Three narrow extensions are near the base of the cap and are positioned near the vertices of the triangle. Two larger triangle-shaped structures (200 Å on a side) lie underneath the caps in approximately the same orientation. The middle section of the structure (Fig. 2, B and C) is ∼170 Å in length and has 12 openings, six on either side of the equator. Three prominent protrusions on the 2-fold axis extend ∼25 Å from the side of the barrel and are oriented 120° with respect to each other normal to the major axis. These features are responsible for the protrusions on the ring seen in the end view average image (Fig. 1F). The outside wall of the barrel has a zig-zag appearance with the prominent protrusion in the center and four surrounding openings (Fig. 2B). Three of these shapes comprise the side wall of the barrel. Serial sections cut normal to the barrel's major axis show the protein density distribution of the structure and reveal an elaborate internal cavity (Fig. 3). An initial inspection of the slices shows that most of the protein and the highest protein density of the molecule are associated with the middle portion of the structure (compare rows 3-5 with 1, 2, 6, and 7). It is expected that this portion of the structure comprises the activity domains associated with the α and β subunits since the two subunits are most proximal to each other in this region of the molecule (see below). The central slices (rows 3-5) have three approximately round high density patterns that are associated with the prominent triangular protein density in the center slice (4C). Alternating between these strands are three pro"

Northern analysis revealed that the abundance of zif-268 (egr-1), c-fos, and tis-1 (NGF1-B) mRNA was rapidly and transiently increased in normal retinal pigment epithelial cells during rod outer segment phagocytosis but not during phagocytosis of latex particles. No increase in gene expression was found in Royal College of Surgeons-p+ dystrophic retinal pigment epithelial cells challenged with rod outer segments. As shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, a prominent short term increase in the intensity of the gel-shifted band was detected using nuclear protein extracts derived from rod outer segment-challenged, control retinal pigment epithelial cells and zif-268, AP-1, AP-2, or tis-1 consensus oligonucleotides. No such increase was detected when using nuclear factor κB consensus oligonucleotide or when the early response gene prostaglandin H synthase-2 mRNA was measured over the time course studied. The results suggest that in retinal pigment epithelial cells, rod outer segment-specific phagocytosis is accompanied by the selective expression of early response genes coding for transcription factors.

The retina is a part of the central nervous system directly exposed to external environmental stimuli. The outer segments of photoreceptors contain rhodopsin and other molecules that capture light signals and transmit this information through the retinal synaptic circuitry to the brain. The outer segments are damaged by oxidative stress and need to undergo a renewal process during which the tip is shed daily and then phagocytized by the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) 1The abbreviations used are: RPEretinal pigment epitheliumRCSRoyal College of SurgeonsROSrod outer segmentsERGearly response geneMEMminimum essential mediumNPXTnuclear protein extractEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayCPXTcytoplasmic protein extractNFκBnuclear factor κβ. cells.

The ability of RPE to phagocytize the shed discs of outer segments is essential for photoreceptor integrity and function. If this ability is compromised, as in mutant RCS (Royal College of Surgeons) rats, irreversible degeneration of the photoreceptor cells takes place (9Bok D. Hall M.O. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 49: 664-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). RPE cells are the most active phagocytes in the body. In the rat, an RPE cell ingests and degrades 25,000-30,000 membrane outer segment discs each day. Virtually all are degraded efficiently within a few hours after ingestion. In addition, RPE cells sort, process, and retrieve compounds essential for visual cell function, such as vitamin A (1Okajima T.I.K. Pepperberg D.R. Ripps H. Wiggert B. Chader G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The RPE cells then prepare for the next day's cycle of phagocytosis. To perform this task, RPE cells must have tightly regulated intracellular signaling pathways that couple phagocytosis with expression of genes encoding the rod outer segment (ROS)-degradative enzymes, transport proteins, etc. There is no information available on gene expression in RPE cells early during ROS phagocytosis. Even though RPE cells normally phagocytize only the outer segments of photoreceptors, they can also nonspecifically phagocytize particles such as latex beads (10Edwards R.B. Szamier R.B. Science. 1977; 197: 1001-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Phagocytosis of ROS is thought to be mediated by a specific receptor in RPE cells, although identification of this receptor remains elusive, as do the associated signal transduction pathways (11Mayerson P.L. Hall M.O. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 12Boyle D.L. Tien L.F. Cooper N.G. Shepherd V. McLaughlin B.J. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1991; 32: 1464-1470PubMed Google Scholar). The products of early response genes (ERGs) or immediate-early genes are engaged in receptor-mediated transduction events by which extracellular stimuli modulate gene expression. ERGs are a class of genes whose expression is low or undetectable in quiescent cells but whose transcription is activated rapidly after extracellular stimulation, independent of de novo protein synthesis. Several ERGs encode transcription factor proteins that modulate the subsequent opening of gene cascades (13Doucet J.P. Squinto S.P. Bazan N.G. Mol. Neurobiol. 1990; 4: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). c-fos proto-oncogene encodes a component of the AP-1 transcription factor (14Karin M. J. Biol.

Among the external stimuli that turn the expression of c-fos on in mouse peritoneal macrophages is Fc- and C3b-mediated phagocytosis (15Collart M.A. Belin D. Briottet C. Thorens B. Vasalli J.D.

Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 443-450PubMed Google Scholar). We now report that phagocytosis of ROS by RPE cells selectively activates certain early response gene transcription factors. These genes are not activated by nonspecific phagocytosis or in dystrophic RPE cells. Part of these results have appeared in abstract form (25Ershov, A. V., Lukiw, W. J., Bazan, N. G., (1995) Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci., 36, (suppl.) S815.Google Scholar). Long Evans female rats with timed litters (from Harlan Sprague-Dawley) were kept in plastic cages at the LSU Medical Center animal care facility until the pups reached the age of 10 days. The retinal dystrophic RCS-p+ strain and congenic control RCS-rdy+p+ strain of rats (26LaVail M.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1981; 20: 671-675PubMed Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Matthew M. LaVail (University of California, San Francisco). Breeding pairs of these rats were kept in plastic cages in the animal care facility, and births were monitored daily. All rats were kept on the 12-h dark/12-h light cycle. RPE were isolated from 10-day-old rats (27Mayerson P.L. Hall M.O. Clark V. Abrams T. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1985; 26: 1599-1609PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were seeded into six-well plastic tissue culture plates at a density of approximately 105 cells/well or into 60-mm plastic tissue culture dishes (2.5 × 105 cells/dish) and cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml of both penicillin and streptomycin, and 2 mM glutamine. The cells were used when they reached confluence, usually after 7-10 days of growth at 37°C in 95% air, 5% CO2. ROS were isolated from adult Long Evans rats by centrifugation in a continuous sucrose gradient (28Chaitin M.H. Hall M.O. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1983; 24: 812-820PubMed Google Scholar) and were resuspended in MEM without supplements at a final concentration of 2 × 108/ml. The ROS suspension (100 μl) was layered on top of the RPE cell monolayer, and the medium was mixed with gentle rocking. For controls, an equal volume of vehicle (MEM) was added to RPE cells. The cells were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37°C in 5% CO2, 95% air for the time indicated in each experiment before RNA was isolated or nuclear protein extract (NPXT) was prepared. As a morphological control, some cell cultures from the same experiments were double immunostained using anti-ROS antiserum as described before (28Chaitin M.H. Hall M.O. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1983; 24: 812-820PubMed Google Scholar), and phagosomes were visualized with a Odyssey XL confocal laser scanning microscope (Noran Instruments, Middleton, WI). To study the specificity of gene expression for phagocytosis of ROS, Polybead polystyrene latex spheres (1.053-μm outer diameter, Polysciences, Warrington, PA) or fluorescent yellow-green latex microspheres (1.0-μm outer diameter, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), were used in the place of ROS (2 × 108/ml in 100 μl of MEM layered on top of the RPE cell monolayer). In representative cell cultures, phagocytized fluorescent beads were observed directly with the confocal scanning microscope to ensure, as with ROS, that phagocytosis of latex beads took place. After incubation with ROS or latex beads, the plates were put on ice and washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were kept on ice until guanidine-thiocyanate extraction buffer was added to isolate total cell RNA (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Gel electrophoresis of RNA (5 μg/lane) was performed under denaturing conditions on a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel. RNA was transferred to Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Corp.) followed by hybridization at 42°C with [32P]DNA probes for zif-268 (16Milbrandt J.

Autoradiography and quantification of Northern blots were performed using GS-250 Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad) or Instant Imager (Packard, Meriden, CT). NPXTs and cytoplasmic protein extracts (CPXTs) were prepared from RPE cells (33Ceglarek J.A. Revzin A. Electrophoresis. 1989; 10: 360-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 34Lukiw W.J.

NPXT and CPXT concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), using whole histones as standards. To calibrate the EMSA system further, purified transcription factors (AP-1) from Promega were used. Protein-DNA complexes were formed in 10-15 μl at 0-4°C by the tandem addition of 0-10 μg of each NPXT, CPXT, or purified transcription factor into an assembly buffer consisting of 50 mM KCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1-1 μg/μl poly(dI-dC), followed by the addition of 10,000-50,000 cpm of end-radiolabeled sense or mutant oligonucleotide DNA. Samples were incubated for 30 min in 500-μl GeneAmp reaction tubes (Perkin Elmer) at 0-4°C. Protein-DNA complexes were analyzed using two gel systems to detect both weak and strong protein-DNA interactions: a high porosity composite gel type consisting of 4.5% polyacrylamide (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 80:1), 2.5% glycerol using either 0.25 × TBE (1 × TBE = 90 mM Tris, pH 8.4, 90 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA) or TGEM buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 190 mM glycine, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM magnesium acetate) for both gel matrix and running buffer or a low porosity gel type consisting of 5% polyacrylamide (acrylamide:bisacrylamide 40:1) using 0.5 TBE as running buffer. Both gel types were run at 23°C on a Bio-Rad Mini Protean II vertical electrophoresis apparatus. After electrophoresis, gels were overlaid with Saran Wrap (Dow), dried onto Whatman no. 1 filter paper, and exposed to Kodak Biomax autoradiographic film for 0.5-3 h, or they were scanned using either a GS-250 Molecular Imager or Instant Imager. Band shift intensities were quantitated using the analytical package provided with each instrument. Primary cultures of rat RPE cells readily phagocytize freshly isolated rat ROS. This was monitored by direct microscopic observation of immunostained phagosomes inside RPE cells (data not shown). Kinetic studies using ROS, compared with nonspecific latex particles, strongly suggest that RPE cells, in this in vitro system, phagocytize ROS through a specific receptor-mediated mechanism (11Mayerson P.L. Hall M.O. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 38Hall M.O. Abrams T. Exp. Eye Res. 1987; 45: 907-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Resting RPE cells in culture revealed low levels of zif-268 mRNA; c-fos, tis-1, and cox-2 mRNA were undetectable. Because ERGs are extremely sensitive to experimental manipulations, ROS were added in small volumes (100 μl) of serum-free medium because larger volumes (e.g. 1 ml) or the addition of serum enhanced ERG expression. To control for other factors that contributed to nonspecific induction of ERGs (e.g. exposure to room air, shaking, low temperature, and/or high pH due to manipulations carried out outside the CO2 tissue culture incubator), separate six-well plates were used for each time point, three of which received ROS, and the other three wells served as controls. c-fos, zif-268, and tis-1 mRNA abundance in normal Long Evans rat RPE cells was rapidly and transiently increased during ROS phagocytosis (Fig. 1). After 30 min of incubation with ROS, the c-fos, zif-268, and tis-1 mRNA expression was greatly enhanced compared with controls. Maximum mRNA abundance was observed at 30 min for c-fos, at 45 min for zif-268, and at 60 min for tis-1. The amplitude of responses differed: c-fos and tis-1 mRNA accumulation ranged from 6- to 20-fold, whereas ROS induction of zif-268 was smaller, ranging from 2- to 3-fold, which is similar to the relative induction of these genes in cultured rat astrocytes by mitogens (39Arenander A.T. Lim R.W. Varnum B.C. Cole R. de Vellis J. Herschman H.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 23: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). By 2 h, mRNA levels for all three genes decreased but still remained higher than controls. RPE cells from RCS-rdy+p+ rats, which are a normal congenic control for the dystrophic RCS-rdy/rdy+p+ rats, showed similar gene induction during phagocytosis of ROS (data not shown). cox-2 is induced in cells in response to diverse stimuli, such as tetradecanoylphorbolacetate, platelet-derived growth factor, lipopolysaccharide, or platelet-activating factor (40Herschman H.R. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). However, no expression of cox-2 was observed in RPE cells in response to ROS phagocytosis or to platelet-activating factor (100 μM), although both 50 nM tetradecanoylphorbolacetate and 10 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor did induce this gene (Fig. 2a). EMSA using zif-268, AP-1, and TIS-1 consensus oligonucleotides and RPE nuclear extracts showed the appearance of shifted bands during ROS phagocytosis (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, b and c). Most of the zif-268-shifted bands were observed in nuclear extracts compared with extracts prepared with RPE cytosol. There was some enhancement in the shifted band in RPE cytosol 45 min after the addition of ROS. However, this was much lower than the corresponding change observed in nuclear extracts. Using zif-268 mutant oligonucleotides, no shifted bands were observed under these experimental conditions (Fig. 2c), suggesting that the shifted bands specifically recognized the zif-268 consensus sequence. The maximum intensity of gel-shifted bands occurred at 30 min for AP-1, 45 min for zif-268, and 60 min for TIS-1. This suggests that c-fos, zif-268, and tis-1 mRNAs are translated very rapidly into transcription factor proteins. The short half-life of c-fos mRNA (t1/2∼ 15 min) suggests that, indeed, the cellular mechanism for translation of c-fos mRNA into c-FOS gene product was very rapid (41Shyu A.B. Greenberg M.E. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 60-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Detailed analysis of the kinetics of induction of DNA binding activity of transcription factor proteins compared with their respective mRNA levels revealed a seeming disparity between these two patterns of expression. For example, a significant increase in zif-268 protein appears at 15 min after incubation with ROS, well before there is a demonstrable increase in zif-268 protein levels (30 min). Similarly, increased mRNA expression for c-fos and tis-1 is evident after 2 h of ROS phagocytosis, whereas increased AP-1 DNA binding activity can only be seen at 30 min and TIS-1 binding activity at 60 and 75 min. This difference in the kinetics of expression suggests the involvement of post-transcriptional and translational control in the expression of these genes. Since the constitutive level of zif-268 mRNA expression is relatively high in REP cells, regulation of zif-268 protein expression may involve the existence of a translational block. This type of zif-268 modulation has been shown in other cells (42Maass A. Grohe C. Oberdorf S. Sukhatme V.P. Vetter H. Neyses L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1337-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The initial induction of zif-268 by ROS phagocytosis may relieve the translational constraint by specific phagocytosis stimuli and then transcriptionally activate zif-268 mRNA synthesis. The possible involvement of post-transcriptional regulation is even more evident in the case of AP-1 transcription factor. AP-1 is formed as either a homodimer or as a heterodimer by different members of the fos and jun proto-oncogene families. It is well established that AP-1 is not only regulated by transcription of fos and jun genes, but also at the translational level (43Adunyah S.E. Ceesay K.J. Rivero J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The very narrow peak of DNA binding activity of AP-1 protein coexisting with longer induction of c-fos mRNA expression suggests this post-transcriptional regulation in RPE cells. The transcription factor AP-2 was also rapidly and transiently expressed in RPE nuclear extracts during ROS phagocytosis with a prominent peak at 15-30 min after incubation with ROS (Fig. 3). However, using the NFκB consensus oligonucleotide (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ in EMSA, no evidence was found of an enhanced expression in the RPE nuclear extract during phagocytosis (Fig. 3). Tate et al. (45Tate D.J. Miceli M.V. Newsome D.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1995; 36: 1271-1279PubMed Google Scholar) found activation of NFκB DNA binding in cultured human RPE cells after prolonged (4-h) incubation with bovine ROS. This response was not specific for ROS as the same level of induction was found during phagocytosis of latex beads. The foregoing results suggest that initial NFκB induction is not an early event in ROS phagocytosis. Rat RPE cells in primary culture display specificity toward phagocytosis of ROS compared with that of nonspecific particles (11Mayerson P.L. Hall M.O. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, these cells can also ingest large quantities of latex beads (10Edwards R.B. Szamier R.B. Science. 1977; 197: 1001-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 46Seyfried-Williams R. McLaughlin B.J. Cooper N.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 154: 500-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) presumably through a nonspecific mechanism (44Philp N.J. Bernstein M.H. Exp. Eye Res. 1981; 33: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, to see if the induction of ERGs by ROS phagocytosis also occurred with latex bead particles, RPE cultures were fed with either ROS or the same number of latex particles that had a diameter similar to ROS. Even though RPE cells phagocytized large quantities of latex beads (as confirmed by visualization of phagocytized fluorescent latex beads in a confocal scanning microscope; data not shown), only ROS-mediated phagocytosis stimulated expression of c-fos, zif-268, and tis-1 mRNAs (Figs. 2d and 4), as well as AP-1, AP-2, and zif-268 nuclear transcription factor proteins (Fig. 4) in RPE cells. RPE cells are the primary target of a genetic defect in dystrophic RCS rats, which makes them unable to phagocytize ROS effectively. Although mutant RPE cells in culture bind ROS in the same manner as normal RPE cells, only a small fraction of bound ROS will subsequently be ingested (10Edwards R.B. Szamier R.B. Science. 1977; 197: 1001-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 28Chaitin M.H. Hall M.O. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1983; 24: 812-820PubMed Google Scholar). In RCS rat RPE cells, the genetic defect is not yet known but may involve a putative receptor for RPE phagocytosis and/or the signal transduction mechanism activated by this receptor. The hypothesis that ROS-induced activation of ERGs in dystrophic RPE cells is impaired was therefore tested. Our results show that RPE cells from dystrophic RCS rats did not display enhanced expression of c-fos, zif-268, or tis-1 mRNAs with the ROS challenge, nor was there induction of AP-1, AP-2, or zif-268 nuclear transcription factor proteins (Fig. 4). The inability of RPE cells from dystrophic RCS rats to respond to phagocytotic stimuli at the ERG level supports the idea that the defect may involve a signal transduction event associated with a putative RPE membrane receptor for ROS phagocytosis. In conclusion, selective induction of certain immediate-early transcription factors took place at the onset of phagocytosis in the RPE. The expression of the transcription factors followed specific patterns, starting with AP-2 (15 min after the addition of ROS), followed by AP-1 (30 min), zif-268 (45 min), and TIS-1 (60 min). Gene induction was specific for ROS phagocytosis because (a) it occurred only while RPE cells phagocytized outer segments and not when they ingested latex beads; (b) some transcription factors were induced while others were unaffected; and (c) RPE cells from RCS dystrophic rats did not display activation of immediate-early transcription factors upon the addition of ROS. This selective activation of ERGs in RPE cells supports the notion that phagocytosis of ROS by RPE cells is indeed a receptor-mediated process, different from nonspecific phagocytosis of particles such as latex beads. Also, for the first time, this study provides a qualitative assay (ERG expression) to distinguish between specific and nonspecific phagocytosis by RPE cells. During phagocytosis of ROS, a receptor-mediated event may trigger a signal in RPE cells which, in turn, activates certain ERGs in a specific pattern. Gene cascades may then be opened by activating the subsequent expression of genes that encode proteins necessary for the completion of phagocytosis, preparation of the cell for the next cycle, and for the fulfillment of other functions. Furthermore, signals engaged on this receptor-gene activation cascade may be critical for the survival of photoreceptors, particularly in the aging retina, and may be relevant to the understanding of events crucial to senile macular degeneration. We are grateful to Dr. Matthew M. LaVail for the generous gift of RCS rats, and Dr. Michael O. Hall for providing anti-ROS antiserum."
https://openalex.org/W1971059744,"We recently demonstrated that the Autographa californica multinucleocapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus homologous region (hr1) enhances transcription from the viral polyhedrin promoter and also functions as a putative origin of replication (ori). Hr1, carrying five 28-base pair core palindrome units, has also been mapped with respect to its enhancer and ori functions (Habib, S., Pandey, S., Chatterji, U., Burma, S., Ahmad, R., Jain, A., and Hasnain, S. E. (1996) DNA Cell Biol. 15, 737-747). A 38-kDa host factor termed hr1-binding protein (hr1-BP) binds with high specificity and affinity (Kd∼6.5 × 10−11M) to functionally important motifs within hr1. The core palindrome as well as sequences immediately flanking it are required for this interaction. Divalent cations are not essential, and ionic interactions play only a minor role in complex formation. hr1-BP binds through the minor groove of the double helix to multiple sites within hr1, and binding occurs as a function of the number of modules within hr1. Phosphorylation of hr1-BP is important for host factor-hr1 interaction. Hr1-BP differs in several respects from the other host factor, polyhedrin promoter-binding protein, described previously (Burma, S., Mukherjee, B., Jain, A., Habib, S., and Hasnain, S. E. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 2750-2757). When hr1-BP was sequestered out, in vivo, by a plasmid carrying hr1 alone, the hr1-mediated enhancement of reporter expression was abolished, demonstrating that the binding of hr1-BP may be crucial for the enhancer activity of the dual function hr1 element. We recently demonstrated that the Autographa californica multinucleocapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus homologous region (hr1) enhances transcription from the viral polyhedrin promoter and also functions as a putative origin of replication (ori).

The genome of the Autographa californica multinucleocapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus (MNPV) 1The abbreviations used are: MNPVmultinucleocapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virusbpbase pair(s)hr1-BPhr1-binding proteinPPBPpolyhedrin promoter-binding protein. is a double-stranded, covalently closed, circular DNA molecule consisting largely of unique sequences. Eight homologous region sequences or hrs (hr1, hr1a, hr2, hr3, hr4a, hr4b, hr4c, and hr5) are distributed throughout the genome. These hrs vary in length from 150 to 800 bp and contain two to eight imperfect, 30-bp palindromes with an EcoRI site at the center of each palindromic core. The hrs have been demonstrated to be putative origins (oris) of viral DNA replication as well as enhancers of delayed-early gene transcription (3Ahrens C.H. Leisy D.J. Rohrmann G.F.

Virology. 1993; 196: 722-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and preliminary data have suggested its role as an enhancer of the immediate-early ie-n gene and the delayed-early 39K gene (9Guarino L.A. Gonzalez M.A. Summers M.D. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 224-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Guarino L.A. Summers M.D. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 215-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Carson D.D. Summers M.D. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 945-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that it also functions as a position- and orientation-independent enhancer of A. californica MNPV very late polyhedrin gene transcription in transient expression assays and that this enhancement effect is independent of the ori function of hr1 (1Habib S. Pandey S. Chatterji U. Burma S. Ahmad R. Jain A. Hasnain S.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). An intact 28-bp core palindrome together with the palindrome-flanking sequences is essential for enhancement; a palindrome intermediate sequence flanked by two half-palindromes or a palindrome alone is incapable of enhancing polyhedrin promoter-driven transcription. The palindrome alone could, however, function as an infection-dependent ori in transient replication assays (1Habib S. Pandey S. Chatterji U. Burma S. Ahmad R. Jain A. Hasnain S.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). DNA-protein interactions have been previously investigated with hr1a and hr5. The virus-encoded immediate early protein IE-1 binds to sequences within both of these hrs (12Choi J. Guarino L.A. Virology. 1995; 209: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13Choi J. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4548-4551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Leisy D.J. Rasmussen C. Kim H.T. Rohrmann G.F. Virology. 1995; 208: 742-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and potential IE-1 binding sites within these enhancer elements have been delineated (14Leisy D.J. Rasmussen C. Kim H.T. Rohrmann G.F. Virology. 1995; 208: 742-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15Guarino L.A. Dong W. Virology. 1994; 200: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In hr5, approximately half of the direct repeat (DR60) is sufficient for binding, and both the right and the left halves of DR60 bind the protein. Specific binding of IE-1 to the hr1a sequence has been detected for probes containing EcoRI core mutations, indicating that the protein binds to regions flanking the EcoRI core sequence (14Leisy D.J. Rasmussen C. Kim H.T. Rohrmann G.F. Virology. 1995; 208: 742-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It has been recently demonstrated that IE-1 binding to hr5 is optimal when both palindrome half-sites are present and that a dimeric form of IE-1 binds to the hr5 28-mer palindromic core (16Rodems S.M. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5368-5375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ie-1 gene product when translated in rabbit reticulocyte extracts can also bind hr5, thereby demonstrating that this DNA-protein interaction can occur in the absence of insect cell host factors (13Choi J. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4548-4551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there has been no report so far of the involvement of a host-specific cellular factor interacting with any of the hr sequences. In this study we describe a 38-kDa host factor, the hr1-binding protein (hr1-BP), that interacts with the hr1 sequence elements with high specificity and affinity. Analyses of DNA binding characteristics of this factor, its affinity for hr1, and the requirement of phosphorylation for binding are presented. The abolition of hr1-mediated enhancement of reporter gene expression in an in vivo transient expression assay by the presence of a competing hr1 sequence in trans points to the importance of this factor in hr1 function. Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf9) were grown in TNMFH medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum as described by Summers and Smith (17Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; 1555: 10-11Google Scholar). The cells were infected with A. californica MNPV E-2 strain at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units/cell for transient expression studies and for the preparation of nuclear protein extracts. The expression of luciferase in Sf9 cells transfected with reporter plasmids was carried out using Lipofectin (1Habib S. Pandey S. Chatterji U. Burma S. Ahmad R. Jain A. Hasnain S.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 106 cells were seeded in a 35-mm tissue culture plate, washed twice with serum-free TNMFH, and incubated for 2 h at 27°C. Reporter plasmid DNA (15 μg of DNA/2 × 106 cells) dissolved in 35 μl of water and 15 μl of (1 mg/ml) Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) were separately diluted to 500 μl in serum-free TNMFH, mixed, and added to the culture wells. After 8 h at 27°C, cells were washed twice with complete medium, infected with A. californica MNPV at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units/cell for 1 h and incubated in complete medium at 27°C. At 60 h postinfection, cells were dislodged in 400 μl of medium, diluted to 600 μl with 0.1 M Tris acetate (pH 7.75), 2 mM EDTA buffer, and assayed for luciferase in a buffer containing 40 μM luciferin, 14 mM MgCl2, and 14 mM glycine (pH 7.6). Light emission was monitored using a luminometer (model 1250, Bio-Orbit Oy, Turku, Finland) over an integration period of 10 s. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from Sf9 cells using a modification of the method of Dignam et al. (18Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar) as described earlier (2Burma S. Mukherjee B. Jain A. Habib S. Hasnain S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2750-2757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hasnain S.E. Habib S. Jain A. Burma S. Mukherjee B. Adhya S. Methods in Enzymology: RNA Polymerase and Associated Factors. Academic Press, Inc., New York1995: 20-32Google Scholar). All operations were carried out at 4°C. Briefly, the crude nuclear fraction was pelleted from cells lysed in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mM magnesium acetate. The nuclei were purified by centrifugation at 28,000 rpm for 60 min in a Beckman SW41 rotor through a sucrose cushion (10 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 15 mM KCl, 2 M sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM dithiothreitol). The purified nuclei were suspended in protein extraction buffer (10 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 420 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM dithiothreitol). After 30 min, the nuclei were pelleted at 11,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge; the supernatant was dialyzed against a buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 M KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, aliquoted, and stored at −70°C. Binding reactions with nuclear extracts from uninfected and infected cells were carried out by incubating 2 μg of nuclear extract with end-labeled fragments of hr1 (Fig. 1). The binding reaction was carried out in a buffer containing 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and 1 μg (∼1000-fold excess) of poly(dI-dC) at 4°C for 15 min. The reaction was loaded on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel and run at 150 V in TAE buffer. In competition experiments, a 20-fold molar excess of the unlabeled competitor was added to the reaction prior to the addition of the nuclear extract. In the experiment involving competition with oligonucleotides covering overlapping regions of hr1, up to a 200-fold molar excess of competitor was used. The 330-bp hr1 probe was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with varying concentrations of distamycin A (10 μM to 1 mM), actinomycin D (10 μM to 1.4 mM) or methyl green (50 μM to 1.25 mM), drugs that specifically interact with the minor or major groove of the DNA double helix, respectively (20Copenhaver G.P. Putnam C.D. Denton M.L. Pickard C.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 22: 2651-2657Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Kim S.K. Norden B. FEBS. 1993; 315: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The DNA-drug mix was then analyzed for binding in a gel retardation assay by incubation with nuclear extract. All operations were carried out at 4°C unless stated otherwise. Nuclear protein extract (100 μg) was fractionated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris and 190 mM glycine at 30 mA for 16 h. The membrane was incubated with blocking buffer (2% nonfat dry milk, 1% bovine serum albumin, 10 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2, and 16 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA) for 2 h and then incubated with binding buffer (blocking buffer with 0.2% nonfat dry milk) containing 32P-labeled 170-bp hr1 probe for 16 h, washed briefly, and subjected to autoradiography as described earlier (2Burma S. Mukherjee B. Jain A. Habib S. Hasnain S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2750-2757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear protein extract (50 μg) was treated with 200 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) for 4 h at 37°C (2Burma S. Mukherjee B. Jain A. Habib S. Hasnain S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2750-2757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Parthun M.R. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4981-4987Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in a dephosphorylation buffer (1 mM ZnCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3). 200 units of phosphatase boiled for 30 min was used as a negative control. Phosphatase-treated nuclear extracts were assayed by Southwestern analysis as described above except that dry milk was omitted from both the blocking as well as binding buffer and was replaced by 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% bovine serum albumin, respectively (23Papavassiliou A.G. Bohmann K. Bohmann D. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In order to determine the factors involved in hr1 interactions, we carried out gel retardation assays using 32P-labeled hr1 DNA sequences and nuclear extracts prepared from uninfected cells and from A. californica MNPV infected cells 3, 6, 12, 36, and 50 h postinfection. With the 330-bp fragment of hr1 as probe (Fig. 1), a stronger shift of higher mobility (CI) and a weaker shift of lower mobility (CII) were detected at all time points. The intensities of the complexes were also similar at all time points tested (Fig. 2). There was no visible difference in the complexes obtained with extracts from uninfected (lane 2) and infected (lanes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) cells, suggesting the involvement of host factor(s) in hr1 interactions. When the 420-, 330-, 170-, 158-, and 90-bp fragments representing different components of hr1 (Fig. 1) were used as probes in gel retardation assays, three complexes with the 420-bp fragment (Fig. 3A), two complexes with the 330-bp (B) and 170-bp (C) fragments and a single complex each with the 158-bp (D) and 90-bp (E) fragments were visible. However, when a 28-bp synthetic oligonucleotide constituting just the complete palindrome without any flanking sequence was used as probe (Fig. 3F), the DNA-protein complex could not be detected. This suggested that a single palindromic unit alone is not sufficient for binding the host factor and that flanking sequences may play a major role in this DNA-protein interaction. The number of complexes observed corresponded to the number of palindrome-flanking sequences present in each probe. To confirm that the hr1-host factor complex represents a specific DNA-protein interaction, competition experiments were carried out. The addition of an excess of the unlabeled homologous competitor (probe fragment) to the binding reaction competed for complex formation (Fig. 3, A, lane 4, B-E, lane 3), while the complex remained unaffected in the presence of the nonspecific competitor pUC18 (Fig. 3, A, lane 5, B-E, lane 4). These results demonstrated that host factor(s) binds specifically to the hr1 core palindrome along with flanking sequences and not to the palindrome alone. Furthermore, complex formation occurs as a function of this modular binding unit. A series of gel retardation assays were carried out using the 330-, 170-, and 90-bp fragments corresponding to different components of hr1 as probes and challenging the binding with unlabeled fragments of hr1 in a cross-competition assay. The DNA-protein complexes obtained with the 170-bp fragment (Fig. 4A, lane 2) were efficiently competed out with an excess of unlabeled 330-bp (lane 3) and 158-bp (lane 4) fragments but not with a similar excess of unlabeled 28-bp core palindrome alone (lane 5) or a nonspecific competitor pUC18 (lane 6). Similarly, the single complex obtained with the 158-bp fragment (Fig. 4B, lane 2) carrying an intermediate sequence flanked by two half-palindromes as probe disappeared in the presence of a molar excess of the 330-bp (lane 3), 170-bp (lane 4), and 90-bp (lane 5) fragments but was not affected when the 28-bp EcoRI core palindrome (lane 6) or nonspecific pUC18 (lane 7) was used as competitor. These cross-competition analyses clearly demonstrated that the same host factor is involved in interacting with different fragments of hr1. Nine overlapping double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides encompassing different regions of an hr1-palindrome and its 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences (Table I) as well as the CANNTG motif recognized by helix-loop-helix proteins (1Habib S. Pandey S. Chatterji U. Burma S. Ahmad R. Jain A. Hasnain S.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) were used as competitors in a binding reaction with the 170-bp fragment of hr1 (Fig. 5A). None of the oligonucleotides, including those that carried a half or full palindrome with only the 5′- or the 3′-flanking sequence, could compete significantly for binding even when a 200-fold molar excess of the unlabeled competitors was used (Fig. 5A, lanes 3-10). The CANNTG motif was found to be present within the hr1 element (1Habib S. Pandey S. Chatterji U. Burma S. Ahmad R. Jain A. Hasnain S.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); therefore, oligonucleotides were designed to explore the significance of this motif in hr1-BP interaction. The slight decrease in the intensity of the complex seen with respect to competition with the oligonucleotide M+ (lane 9) that carries the CANNTG motif (Table I) was not consistently observed. Competition was, however, clearly seen with the 46-bp oligonucleotide 5P3 that carries the full palindrome along with 9 bp each of the 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences (lane 11). We then used this oligonucleotide as probe and observed two specific shifts in the normal binding reaction. (Fig. 5B, lane 2). The complex could not be competed out with the oligonucleotides P5F (full palindrome with 5′-flanking sequence) (lane 4) and P (full palindrome alone) (lane 5) but was competed out when the oligonucleotide mFP (full palindrome with shuffled 9 bp each of the 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences) (lane 3) and the 170-bp hr1 fragment were used as competitors. Use of the nonspecific competitor pUC18 did not affect complex formation. These results demonstrate that short segments representing both the 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences are required for the hr1-BP interaction. A half-palindrome, a palindrome alone, or flanking sequences without the palindrome are not sufficient for the interaction. Moreover, the fact that an oligonucleotide carrying an intact palindrome with shuffled flanking sequences could act as a competitor indicates promiscuity in the sequence requirement of the 9-bp 5′ and 3′ palindrome-flanking segments. The nucleotide sequence of the flanking segments required for binding of hr1-BP, therefore, does not appear to be precise. The two shifts observed with 5P3 as probe suggest binding of an hr1-BP dimer to this sequence.Table I.Oligodeoxyribonucleotides used to fine map the binding motifOligonucleotide nameDouble-stranded oligonucleotide sequenceaThe palindrome sequences are shown in boldface type, and the CANNTG motif is underlined.

The sequence of the upper strand alone is shown. Open table in a new tab We checked whether the factor binding to hr1 was a protein or whether it also involved an RNA component. Binding of the 32P-labeled 330-bp hr1 fragment was carried out after pretreating the nuclear extract (2 μg) with RNase A (1 μg) or proteinase K (20 μg) at 37°C for 1 h. Complex formation, observed in a gel retardation assay (Fig. 6, lane 1), was abolished when nuclear extracts were treated with proteinase K (lane 3) but remained unaffected after treatment with RNase (lane 2). These results clearly rule out the involvement of any RNA component in the host factor-hr1 interaction. In order to check whether the host factor binding to hr1 was the same as the cellular 30-kDa polyhedrin promoter-binding protein (PPBP) reported earlier (2Burma S. Mukherjee B. Jain A. Habib S. Hasnain S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2750-2757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Mukherjee B. Burma S. Hasnain S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4405-4411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we challenged the complexes obtained with the 330-bp probe with unlabeled domain B, which is a 32-bp synthetic oligonucleotide that carries the AATAAATAAGTATT sequence essential for the PPBP-polyhedrin promoter interaction (2Burma S. Mukherjee B. Jain A. Habib S. Hasnain S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2750-2757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 7A). The two complexes (Fig. 7A, lane 2) remained unaffected in the presence of a 30-fold molar excess of the competitor (lane 3) as well as in the presence of a similar excess of pUC18 (lane 4). In a complementary experiment, in which the domain B-PPBP complex was challenged with an excess of the unlabeled 420-bp fragment, the complex was not competed with an excess of the 420-bp hr1 competitor (Fig. 7B, lane 4) but disappeared in the presence of the homologous B domain oligonucleotide (lane 3). This confirmed that the host factor hr1-BP interacting with hr1 is not the same as the other host factor PPBP, which binds to the AT-rich polyhedrin initiator promoter. Experiments were carried out to determine the interactions involved in hr1-host factor binding. When the binding reaction was carried out using the 170-bp hr1 fragment in the presence of increasing amounts of NaCl, complex formation gradually decreased as a function of salt concentration (Fig. 8A, lanes 2-7) and was abolished only at salt concentrations as high as 2.5 M (lane 8). This suggested that ionic interactions may be only marginally involved in complex formation. When binding was carried out in the presence of different concentrations of EDTA (Fig. 8B), the complex remained unaffected and was stable even at a concentration of 100 mM EDTA (lane 6), demonstrating that divalent cations are not required for the hr1-BP-hr1 interaction. The affinity of the host protein for hr1 was determined by calculating the dissociation constant (Kd) of the complex. The apparent Kd value for the specific DNA-protein interaction was estimated by a method based on the gel retardation assay (2Burma S. Mukherjee B. Jain A. Habib S. Hasnain S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2750-2757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Liao X. Clemens K.R. Tennat L. Wright P.E. Gottesfeld J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 857-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A constant amount of protein (2 μg (Fig. 9A) and 3 μg (Fig. 9B) in two separate determinations) and increasing amounts of the 170-bp radiolabeled hr1 probe were used in separate binding reactions. The extent of complex formation was quantitated by scintillation counting of excised labeled bands obtained in the gel retardation assay. A plot of bound/free versus the bound probe (Fig. 9C) yielded a straight line with the inverse of the slope equal to the dissociation constant. From two separate determinations, the Kd value was estimated to be 6.5 (± 0.2) × 10−11M. The host protein hr1-BP thus interacts with hr1 with very high affinity. Southwestern analysis of the total nuclear extract using the radiolabeled 170-bp fragment as a probe was carried out to determine the molecular mass of the hr1-BP. Nuclear extract from cells very late in infection (50 h postinfection) was fractionated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with the labeled 170-bp fragment (Fig. 10C). A band obtained in the 38-kDa region demonstrated that the apparent molecular mass of the protein was around this value. Hybridization with radiolabeled pUC18, when used as negative control, did not give any signal (Fig. 10A). The 28-bp palindrome that does not bind hr1-BP in gel retardation assays also did not give a band when used as probe in the Southwestern assay (Fig. 10B). These results point to the specificity of the hr1-binding protein detected in the Southwestern blots. Experiments were carried out to determine the effect of dephosphorylation on DNA-binding activity of hr1-BP. Nuclear extracts prepared from infected cells very late in infection (50 h postinfection), when the polyhedrin promoter is hyperactive, were treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase and analyzed for binding by Southwestern blotting using the 170-bp hr1 fragment as a probe. Phosphatase treatment completely abolished DNA binding (Fig. 11, lane P), while binding was unaffected in the untreated extract (lane U) or in the extract treated with boiled phosphatase (lane BP). These results, therefore, demonstrated that phosphorylation of the host factor is essential for binding to the hr1 sequence. Experiments were carried out to determine whether the factor binding to hr1 interacts through the major or the minor groove of the DNA double helix. Binding reactions were carried out in the presence of actinomycin D or methyl green that interact specifically with the minor and the major groove, respectively (20Copenhaver G.P. Putnam C.D. Denton M.L. Pickard C.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 22: 2651-2657Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Kim S.K. Norden B. FEBS. 1993; 315: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Incubation of the radiolabeled 330-bp probe with actinomycin D (lane 2) or methyl green (lane 9) alone did not affect the mobility of the probe. The hr1-protein complex (Fig. 12A, lane 3) was inhibited by actinomycin D in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 4-8) in gel retardation assays. The complex (lane 10) was, however, not affected upon preincubation of the DNA probe with methyl green even when 1.25 mM of the drug was used in the binding reaction. Specific binding of hr1-BP to the minor groove was further confirmed by incubation of the 170-bp probe with distamycin A, another specific minor groove-binding drug (Fig. 12B). Formation of the hr1-host factor complex (lane 1) was also inhibited by distamycin A in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 4-9). Distamycin has sequence-dependent affinity for DNA in the low micromolar range. The requirement of higher concentrations of distamycin for complete inhibition of binding to hr1 suggests that minor groove interactions with the protein may occur at sites with low affinity for distamycin. These results demonstrate that while hr1-BP interacts with hr1 primarily through the minor groove of the DNA double-helix, it is not clear where potential minor groove interactions may be occurring. To provide evidence for the functional role of hr1-BP, we performed in vivo competition by hr1 in transient expression assays using the plasmids pSHluc and pSHluc-hr-U1 (1Habib S. Pandey S. Chatterji U. Burma S. Ahmad R. Jain A. Hasnain S.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The latter carries a copy of the hr1 sequence 730 bp upstream to the polyhedrin promoter-luciferase reporter cassette. We have previously demonstrated that transient expression of luciferase from pSHluc-hr-U1 in infected Sf9 cells is severalfold higher than that from pSHluc. The construct pSHhr1, which carries only the hr1 sequence cloned in pUC18 (1Habib S. Pandey S. Chatterji U. Burma S. Ahmad R. Jain A. Hasnain S.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), was used as a competitor to sequester the hr1-BP present in the cells, thereby making it unavailable for binding to the hr1 sequence in the reporter plasmid. Sf9 cells co-transfected with the reporter construct as well as different amounts of the competitor plasmid were assayed for luciferase expression 60 h postinfection (Fig. 13). As expected, the presence of 10 μg of the competitor pSHhr1 did not have any effect on the expression of pSHluc, which did not carry the hr1 element. The expression from pSHluc-hr-U1, which had been enhanced severalfold by the enhancer effect of hr1, was reduced proportionately as the amount of competitor was increased to 1, 5, and 10 μg. When 10 and 20 μg of competitor was used, the reporter expression level was brought down to that of the basal plasmid pSHluc. This demonstrates that the nonavailability of hr1-BP due to the binding of this factor to an hr1 sequence present in trans abolishes the enhancement effect. The factor is therefore important for mediating the enhancer function of hr1 vis-a-vis the polyhedrin promoter of A. californica MNPV. The enhancer activity for all hrs (9Guarino L.A. Gonzalez M.A. Summers M.D. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 224-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Guarino L.A. Summers M.D. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 215-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and primarily that of hr5 has previously been demonstrated only for the immediate-early and delayed-early genes in transient expression assays (15Guarino L.A. Dong W. Virology. 1994; 200: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26Guarino L.A. Dong W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3676-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that apart from stimulating expression from the immediate early IE-N and delayed early 39K promoter, hr1 can also enhance transcription from the polyhedrin promoter in a position- and orientation-independent manner (1Habib S. Pandey S. Chatterji U. Burma S. Ahmad R. Jain A. Hasnain S.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). hr1 can also enhance transcription from the A. californica MNPV core gene promoter and the heterologous hsp70 promoter from Drosophila melanogaster. 2B. Venkaiah, S. Habib, and S. E. Hasnain, unpublished observation. The 38-kDa cellular factor from Sf9 cells interacts with the hr1 element with high specificity. The sites of this host-factor interaction overlap with functionally important regions within the hr1 enhancer. An intact palindrome together with a short segment each of the 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences is essential for binding to occur. Moreover, the position and intensity of the retarded complex does not change throughout infection, suggesting that either the factor is not modified during the infection cycle or that its DNA-binding activity is not drastically altered by such modification(s). The dephosphorylated protein is incapable of binding hr1, suggesting that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of hr1-BP may play a regulatory role in mediating hr1 function. Characterization of the host factor-hr1 complex revealed some striking features of the interaction. Although there was a slight concentration-dependent decrease in complex formation in the presence of salt, the fact that the complex was observed even at 2 M NaCl suggested that ionic interactions may play a marginal role in complex formation. The host factor-hr1 complex was also not disrupted in the presence of a high concentration of EDTA (up to 100 mM), indicating that divalent cations are not required for binding. hr1-BP also displays unusually high affinity for hr1 with an apparent Kd value of 6.5 (± 0.2) × 10−11M. An extremely low Kd value (∼3.7 × 10−12M) has also been reported (2Burma S. Mukherjee B. Jain A. Habib S. Hasnain S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2750-2757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for another host protein, the 30-kDa host factor PPBP, that interacts with transcriptionally important motifs within the polyhedrin promoter and another A. californica MNPV very late p10 gene promoter (27Jain A. Hasnain S.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 384-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The high affinity of these cellular factors for viral sequences may be crucial for the virus to recruit them from their normal sites of action in the host insect cell. In vitro binding inhibition with the minor groove-binding drugs demonstrates that the insect cellular factor approaches the hr1 element through contact points within the minor groove of the DNA double helix. Some eukaryotic enhancer-binding proteins that interact with the minor groove of DNA induce DNA bending. Examples of such proteins include the lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1, which interacts with the mouse T cell receptor α gene enhancer (28Giese K. Cox J. Grosschedl R. Cell. 1992; 69: 185-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) and the HMG1(Y) protein, which contains a highly charged basic repeat sequence required for its interaction with the AT-rich duplex DNA of the virus-inducible enhancer of the human interferon-β gene (29Du W. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 74: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). A number of viral genes required for DNA replication have been identified (30Lu A. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 975-982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lu A. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6265-6272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The baculovirus immediate-early ie-1 gene product is the only hr-binding factor identified so far. IE-1 binds the DR60 sequence, and sequences flanking the EcoRI core may be important for this interaction (15Guarino L.A. Dong W. Virology. 1994; 200: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Dual palindrome half-sites of hr5 mediate binding of a dimeric form of IE-1. Studies on protein interactions with both hr5 and hr1a have failed to detect a specific host factor-hr interaction although the possibility of host factor(s) interacting with hr1a has not been completely negated (14Leisy D.J. Rasmussen C. Kim H.T. Rohrmann G.F. Virology. 1995; 208: 742-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). There are reports of enhancer-binding cellular proteins in other viruses. At least four different host cellular factors have been found to bind to distinct cis-elements in the U3 region of the long terminal repeats of the Rous sarcoma virus (32Ryden T.A. de Mars M. Beemon K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2862-2870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kandala J.C. Guntaka R.V. Virology. 1994; 198: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The nuclear factor EF-C binds as a dimer to functionally important inverted repeat sequences in the polyoma virus and hepatitis B virus enhancer regions (34Ostapchuk P. Diffley J.F.X. Bruder J.T. Stillman B. Levine A.J. Hearing P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8550-8554Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 35David E. Garcia A.D. Hearing P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8353-8360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We have observed complexes with the uninfected nuclear extract, irrespective of the region of hr1 being used as probe, with the number of complexes being a function of the length of the hr1 probe and the nature of sequences therein. Complex formation does not occur with the 28-bp core palindrome alone, suggesting the requirement of core-flanking sequences for binding. This is confirmed by a series of competitions with overlapping hr1 oligonucleotides. Although short segments of both the 5′ and 3′ palindrome-flanking sequences are essential for the host factor-hr1 interaction, there exists a degeneracy in the sequence requirement, as is evident from the fact that hr1-BP binds even to the oligonucleotide in which the flanking sequences have been shuffled. This may be expected in view of the differences that exist between the sequences flanking the five palindromes of hr1 with which hr1-BP interacts. We previously showed that the replication and enhancer functions of hr1 can be distinguished in a transient expression assay (1Habib S. Pandey S. Chatterji U. Burma S. Ahmad R. Jain A. Hasnain S.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is likely that the two functions (ori- and enhancer-like) are carried out by different sequence elements within hr1. Some of the regions may overlap as suggested by our earlier results that a palindrome alone is sufficient for ori function; for enhancer function, however, a palindrome alone is necessary but not sufficient (1Habib S. Pandey S. Chatterji U. Burma S. Ahmad R. Jain A. Hasnain S.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). That this host factor, present throughout infection, does not bind to the 28-bp core palindrome alone makes it tempting to speculate that our hr1-binding protein may be important for the enhancer function and not for the ori function of hr1. Indeed, sequestering of this factor by competition in vivo abolishes hr1-mediated enhancement in a transient expression assay. The binding of the host factor to hr1 may contribute to low levels of basal transcription relatively early in the infection cycle. Subsequently, as infection proceeds, the host factor may help to create an environment that would make overall transcription more responsive to the presence of yet unidentified inducible host or viral proteins bound to nearby sites in hr1. The interaction of host factors with both the polyhedrin promoter and hr1 enhancer element represents an interesting molecular interaction during baculovirus pathogenesis."

INTRODUCTIONMenkes disease is a fatal, X-linked disease of copper metabolism which affects copper delivery to several copper enzymes, the synthesis of collagen and elastin, and brain development (1Menkes J.H.

Genet. 1993; 3: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar)postulated that the protein encoded by the Menkes gene was within a subcellular membrane. Menkes lymphoblasts are derived by Epstein-Barr virus transformation of lymphocytes from Menkes patients (9Riordan J.R. Jolicoeur-Paquet J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4639-4645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These cells maintain their characteristic phenotype of excess net copper accumulation when incubated with copper (9Riordan J.R. Jolicoeur-Paquet J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4639-4645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are also sensitive to copper toxicity.Normal lymphoblasts were recently found to contain a pool of apoSOD 1Abbreviations used are: SODsuperoxide dismutaseMTmetallothioneinHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographySAHHS-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolaseCCCPcarbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. that was activated when these cells were incubated with copper (10Petrovic N. Comi A. Ettinger M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28331-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The results reported here suggest that the apoSOD pool is nearly copper-saturated in Menkes lymphoblasts when grown in standard culture medium without added copper. Moreover, new SOD synthesis was detected in Menkes lymphoblasts under conditions in which no de novo synthesis of SOD was detected with normal lymphoblasts. Also, CCCP markedly inhibited 64Cu incorporation into SOD in both normal and Menkes lymphoblasts. The results suggest that SOD synthesis is induced in Menkes lymphoblasts to replenish the apoSOD pool in a membrane-bounded compartment as a protective mechanism against potential copper toxicity.DISCUSSIONNormal lymphoblasts were recently found to contain a significant pool of apoSOD, which was estimated to be ≈35% of the total SOD in these cells (10Petrovic N. Comi A. Ettinger M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28331-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Copper was incorporated into this apoSOD pool, and SOD activity increased proportionally when copper was added to normal lymphoblast culture media (10Petrovic N. Comi A. Ettinger M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28331-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The data reported here indicate that the activity of SOD in Menkes lymphoblasts grown under standard conditions without added copper was about the same (≈40% higher) as the maximal possible SOD activity (≈35% higher) in normal lymphoblasts after copper was added (10Petrovic N. Comi A. Ettinger M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28331-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Since Menkes lymphoblasts accumulate and retain higher levels of copper than normal lymphoblasts, the higher SOD activity in Menkes lymphoblasts probably reflects near saturation of the apoSOD pool in Menkes lymphoblasts.A striking abnormal characteristic of Menkes lymphoblasts is significant induction of new synthesis of SOD protein over a ≈15-h incubation period. No significant SOD synthesis was detected under equivalent conditions with normal lymphoblasts (10Petrovic N. Comi A. Ettinger M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28331-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the increased time dependence for copper incorporation into SOD in Menkes lymphoblasts was probably due to the requirement for new SOD synthesis. Curiously, the new holo-SOD synthesis did not appear to significantly contribute to the total SOD activity in Menkes lymphoblasts, because cycloheximide had no significant effect on SOD activity. This is despite the fact that the maximal amount of copper incorporation into newly synthesized SOD in Menkes lymphoblasts was of similar magnitude to the maximal level of copper incorporation into apoSOD in normal lymphoblasts. The lack of a significant effect of cycloheximide on SOD activity in Menkes lymphoblasts suggests that the induction of SOD synthesis and the rate of degradation or removal of SOD may both be regulated to maintain the level of holo-SOD in Menkes lymphoblasts near a maximal possible level. Equal rates of SOD synthesis and removal would also account for the fact that, unlike with normal lymphoblasts (10Petrovic N. Comi A. Ettinger M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28331-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), 64Cu(II) incorporation into SOD was not associated with any significant increase in total SOD activity in Menkes lymphoblasts.Although the function of the apoSOD pool is unknown, the similar possible maximal levels of copper incorporation into apoSOD in normal lymphoblasts and newly synthesized SOD in Menkes lymphoblasts suggests a compensatory response to depletion of the apoSOD pool in Menkes lymphoblasts. Induction of SOD synthesis and removal of SOD to maintain a maximal possible steady-state level of holo-SOD may function as a protective response against potential copper toxicity. Menkes fibroblasts are sensitive to copper toxicity (19Leone A. Pavlakis G.N. Harner D.H. Cell. 1985; 40: 301-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and Menkes lymphoblasts also show increased sensitivity to copper toxicity (unpublished results). Thus, increased SOD synthesis in Menkes lymphoblasts may provide a pool of SOD which can sequester excess copper, which is then rapidly removed to minimize copper toxicity.The fraction of total cellular copper that is in the cytosolic fraction is much higher in Menkes than normal lymphoblasts, 2N. Petrovic, A. Comi, and M. J. Ettinger, unpublished data. and this copper is mostly bound to MT, which is elevated in Menkes lymphoblasts (9Riordan J.R. Jolicoeur-Paquet J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4639-4645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elevated copper in the cytosolic fraction was also reported for animal models of Menkes disease (20Hunt D.M. Port A.E. Life Sci. 1982; 31: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 21Packman S. O'Toole C. Price D.C. Thaler M.M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1983; 19: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This may reflect impairment of copper delivery to, and entry into, various organelles due to impaired function of the Menkes protein and induction of MT in response to the accumulation of nonutilizable copper. The results reported here with normal cells containing elevated levels of MT are consistent with elevated MT being a response to elevated copper rather than elevated MT being a significant contributing factor to impaired utilization of cellular copper in Menkes cells, as elevated MT levels had little or no effect on copper delivery to apoSOD in normal lymphoblasts.The large inhibitory effect of the protonophore, CCCP on copper incorporation into SOD in normal lymphoblasts suggests that the apoSOD pool is within an intracellular, membrane-bounded compartment rather than in the cytoplasm. The fact that copper does not activate the apoSOD when added directly to lymphoblast cytosols rather than to whole cells is also consistent with compartmentalization of the apoSOD pool. Since CCCP had similar effects on copper incorporation into SOD in normal and Menkes lymphoblasts, copper incorporation into SOD in Menkes lymphoblasts may occur in the same cell compartment as in normal lymphoblasts. That is consistent with the hypothesis that new SOD synthesis in Menkes lymphoblasts may represent a cellular response to replenish the apoSOD pool which is apparently depleted in Menkes lymphoblasts, and is also consistent with the similar maximal 64Cu incorporation into apoSOD in normal lymphoblasts and newly synthesized SOD in Menkes lymphoblasts. While SOD has been detected in nuclei and perioxosomes (22Crapo J.D. Oury T. Rabouille C. Slot J.W. Chang L.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Interestingly, the procaryote homologues of the putative Menkes ATPase, copper transporter may be H+-antiport systems (26Tynecka Z. Gos Z. Zajac J. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 313-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The defect in the Menkes gene in the patient whose lymphoblasts were used for our studies was recently reported. A five-base deletion resulting in a frameshift and presumably inactive protein was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (27Das S. Levinson B. Whitney S. Vulpe C. Packman S. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 55: 883-889PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the similar results with CCCP with normal and Menkes lymphoblasts and the high activity of SOD in Menkes lymphoblasts suggests that a subcellular membrane copper transporter other than the Menkes protein is involved in delivery of copper to this SOD pool in lymphoblasts. This putative copper transport protein may be the homologue of the Menkes protein in humans that was recently identified as a candidate for the defect in Wilson's disease (28Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E.

Alternatively, the effect of CCCP may be due to sulfhydryl modification of a specific protein, as previously suggested (18Herd S.M Camakaris J. Christofferson R. Wookey P. Danks D.M. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).The molecular species, pool, and mechanisms involved in copper delivery to SOD remain unknown. The results reported here suggest that MT·Cu is not a major source of SOD copper, and that MT·Cu apparently is not in rapid equilibrium with the cellular copper pool(s) that is a source(s) for SOD-Cu because increased copper on MT had no significant effect on the delivery of copper to apoSOD in normal lymphoblasts. However, increased copper in the Superose copper-binding fraction I was detected in each case in which incorporation of copper into SOD was decreased (10Petrovic N. Comi A. Ettinger M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28331-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the apparent concentration dependence, normalized to maximal possible incorporation, was the same for copper incorporation into SOD and a protein(s) in fraction I in both normal and Menkes lymphoblasts. That suggests that the level of 64Cu binding to a fraction I copper-binding protein is determined, in part, by the degree of saturation of the apoSOD pool. The results with CCCP were particularly striking in that a marked accumulation of copper in fraction I occurred when copper incorporation into SOD was blocked by CCCP. All of these results are consistent with copper bound to a fraction I protein(s), either residing within a copper pool that supplies copper to SOD or being in equilibrium with a pool or species that delivers copper to SOD. A protein that has been identified in the Superose fraction I that has a high affinity for copper is SAHH, and this protein has been proposed to have a role in intracellular copper trafficking (16Bethin K.E.

DISCUSSIONNormal lymphoblasts were recently found to contain a significant pool of apoSOD, which was estimated to be ≈35% of the total SOD in these cells (10Petrovic N. Comi A. Ettinger M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28331-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Copper was incorporated into this apoSOD pool, and SOD activity increased proportionally when copper was added to normal lymphoblast culture media (10Petrovic N. Comi A. Ettinger M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28331-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The data reported here indicate that the activity of SOD in Menkes lymphoblasts grown under standard conditions without added copper was about the same (≈40% higher) as the maximal possible SOD activity (≈35% higher) in normal lymphoblasts after copper was added (10Petrovic N. Comi A. Ettinger M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28331-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Since Menkes lymphoblasts accumulate and retain higher levels of copper than normal lymphoblasts, the higher SOD activity in Menkes lymphoblasts probably reflects near saturation of the apoSOD pool in Menkes lymphoblasts.A striking abnormal characteristic of Menkes lymphoblasts is significant induction of new synthesis of SOD protein over a ≈15-h incubation period. No significant SOD synthesis was detected under equivalent conditions with normal lymphoblasts (10Petrovic N. Comi A. Ettinger M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28331-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the increased time dependence for copper incorporation into SOD in Menkes lymphoblasts was probably due to the requirement for new SOD synthesis. Curiously, the new holo-SOD synthesis did not appear to significantly contribute to the total SOD activity in Menkes lymphoblasts, because cycloheximide had no significant effect on SOD activity. This is despite the fact that the maximal amount of copper incorporation into newly synthesized SOD in Menkes lymphoblasts was of similar magnitude to the maximal level of copper incorporation into apoSOD in normal lymphoblasts. The lack of a significant effect of cycloheximide on SOD activity in Menkes lymphoblasts suggests that the induction of SOD synthesis and the rate of degradation or removal of SOD may both be regulated to maintain the level of holo-SOD in Menkes lymphoblasts near a maximal possible level. Equal rates of SOD synthesis and removal would also account for the fact that, unlike with normal lymphoblasts (10Petrovic N. Comi A. Ettinger M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28331-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), 64Cu(II) incorporation into SOD was not associated with any significant increase in total SOD activity in Menkes lymphoblasts.Although the function of the apoSOD pool is unknown, the similar possible maximal levels of copper incorporation into apoSOD in normal lymphoblasts and newly synthesized SOD in Menkes lymphoblasts suggests a compensatory response to depletion of the apoSOD pool in Menkes lymphoblasts. Induction of SOD synthesis and removal of SOD to maintain a maximal possible steady-state level of holo-SOD may function as a protective response against potential copper toxicity. Menkes fibroblasts are sensitive to copper toxicity (19Leone A. Pavlakis G.N. Harner D.H. Cell. 1985; 40: 301-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and Menkes lymphoblasts also show increased sensitivity to copper toxicity (unpublished results). Thus, increased SOD synthesis in Menkes lymphoblasts may provide a pool of SOD which can sequester excess copper, which is then rapidly removed to minimize copper toxicity.The fraction of total cellular copper that is in the cytosolic fraction is much higher in Menkes than normal lymphoblasts, 2N. Petrovic, A. Comi, and M. J. Ettinger, unpublished data. and this copper is mostly bound to MT, which is elevated in Menkes lymphoblasts (9Riordan J.R. Jolicoeur-Paquet J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4639-4645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elevated copper in the cytosolic fraction was also reported for animal models of Menkes disease (20Hunt D.M. Port A.E. Life Sci. 1982; 31: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 21Packman S. O'Toole C. Price D.C. Thaler M.M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1983; 19: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).

Chem. 1982; 257: 4639-4645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elevated copper in the cytosolic fraction was also reported for animal models of Menkes disease (20Hunt D.M. Port A.E. Life Sci. 1982; 31: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 21Packman S. O'Toole C. Price D.C. Thaler M.M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1983; 19: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This may reflect impairment of copper delivery to, and entry into, various organelles due to impaired function of the Menkes protein and induction of MT in response to the accumulation of nonutilizable copper. The results reported here with normal cells containing elevated levels of MT are consistent with elevated MT being a response to elevated copper rather than elevated MT being a significant contributing factor to impaired utilization of cellular copper in Menkes cells, as elevated MT levels had little or no effect on copper delivery to apoSOD in normal lymphoblasts. The large inhibitory effect of the protonophore, CCCP on copper incorporation into SOD in normal lymphoblasts suggests that the apoSOD pool is within an intracellular, membrane-bounded compartment rather than in the cytoplasm. The fact that copper does not activate the apoSOD when added directly to lymphoblast cytosols rather than to whole cells is also consistent with compartmentalization of the apoSOD pool. Since CCCP had similar effects on copper incorporation into SOD in normal and Menkes lymphoblasts, copper incorporation into SOD in Menkes lymphoblasts may occur in the same cell compartment as in normal lymphoblasts. That is consistent with the hypothesis that new SOD synthesis in Menkes lymphoblasts may represent a cellular response to replenish the apoSOD pool which is apparently depleted in Menkes lymphoblasts, and is also consistent with the similar maximal 64Cu incorporation into apoSOD in normal lymphoblasts and newly synthesized SOD in Menkes lymphoblasts. While SOD has been detected in nuclei and perioxosomes (22Crapo J.D. Oury T. Rabouille C. Slot J.W. Chang L.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10405-10409Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 23Chang L. Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Crapo J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2169-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 24Keller G. Warner T.G. Steimer K.S. Hallewell R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1995; 92: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), the compartment hypothesized for the apoSOD pool in lymphoblasts remains to be determined. As a general protonophore, CCCP may inhibit copper delivery to SOD by dissipating a proton gradient that is required for co-transport of copper into the cellular compartment where copper incorporation into SOD is suggested to occur. Interestingly, the procaryote homologues of the putative Menkes ATPase, copper transporter may be H+-antiport systems (26Tynecka Z. Gos Z. Zajac J. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 313-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The defect in the Menkes gene in the patient whose lymphoblasts were used for our studies was recently reported. A five-base deletion resulting in a frameshift and presumably inactive protein was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (27Das S. Levinson B. Whitney S. Vulpe C. Packman S. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 55: 883-889PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the similar results with CCCP with normal and Menkes lymphoblasts and the high activity of SOD in Menkes lymphoblasts suggests that a subcellular membrane copper transporter other than the Menkes protein is involved in delivery of copper to this SOD pool in lymphoblasts. This putative copper transport protein may be the homologue of the Menkes protein in humans that was recently identified as a candidate for the defect in Wilson's disease (28Yamaguchi Y. Heiny M.E. Gitlin J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 29Bull P.C. Thomas G.R. Rommens J.M. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Nat.

Genet. 1993; 5: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar), or alternatively, another copper transporter that requires proton co-transport. Alternatively, the effect of CCCP may be due to sulfhydryl modification of a specific protein, as previously suggested (18Herd S.M Camakaris J. Christofferson R. Wookey P. Danks D.M. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The molecular species, pool, and mechanisms involved in copper delivery to SOD remain unknown. The results reported here suggest that MT·Cu is not a major source of SOD copper, and that MT·Cu apparently is not in rapid equilibrium with the cellular copper pool(s) that is a source(s) for SOD-Cu because increased copper on MT had no significant effect on the delivery of copper to apoSOD in normal lymphoblasts. However, increased copper in the Superose copper-binding fraction I was detected in each case in which incorporation of copper into SOD was decreased (10Petrovic N. Comi A. Ettinger M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28331-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the apparent concentration dependence, normalized to maximal possible incorporation, was the same for copper incorporation into SOD and a protein(s) in fraction I in both normal and Menkes lymphoblasts. That suggests that the level of 64Cu binding to a fraction I copper-binding protein is determined, in part, by the degree of saturation of the apoSOD pool. The results with CCCP were particularly striking in that a marked accumulation of copper in fraction I occurred when copper incorporation into SOD was blocked by CCCP. All of these results are consistent with copper bound to a fraction I protein(s), either residing within a copper pool that supplies copper to SOD or being in equilibrium with a pool or species that delivers copper to SOD. A protein that has been identified in the Superose fraction I that has a high affinity for copper is SAHH, and this protein has been proposed to have a role in intracellular copper trafficking (16Bethin K.E.

MV contained cytoplasms as confirmed by the presence of mitochondrial DNA but were devoid of chromosomal DNA. Virus binding and vesicle lysis assays revealed that 4-19% (depending upon virus dose) of MV-bound HIV-1 entered the vesicles. HIV-1 internalized in MV was able to initiate and complete viral DNA synthesis as determined by the detection of products of reverse transcription using polymerase chain reaction amplification of viral DNA using regions present in early (strong stop) transcripts and full-length double-stranded molecules. Viral DNA was undetectable in MV exposed to HIV-1 at 0°C, in MV exposed to UV-inactivated virus at 37°C, or after exposure to intact virus at 37°C in the presence of reverse transcriptase inhibitors 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine and a tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-jk](1,4)-benzodiazepin-2-(1H)-thione derivative, indicating that viral DNA detected in HIV-1-exposed MV was synthesized de novo. Kinetic studies revealed that HIV-1 DNA synthesis in MV was very rapid; full-length viral DNA was detected within 15 min of exposure at 37°C, and the DNA levels increased 90-fold after 1 h and declined thereafter. Strong stop viral DNA was 10-fold more abundant than full-length DNA after 1 h at 37°C, indicating that 10% of input viral genomes are fully transcribed in MV within this time frame.

Incorporation of the nucleophile is blocked by prior inhibition of the enzymes, and is not seen when proteolysis occurs in the absence of label, and the protease is then inhibited before the addition of label. Labeling is dependent on the pH, the time of reaction, and the concentrations of the nucleophile and substrate. Labeling of proteins can be readily detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The pattern of elastase-labeled bovine serum albumin bands differs among P1′ Phe, Ala, and Gly, suggesting that nucleophilic attack on acyl enzyme intermediates derived from a large protein may differ from attack on small intermediates. The only observed labeled fragment catalyzed by interleukin 1β-converting enzyme is fragment 28-116 from the interleukin 1β precursor, suggesting that the cleavage between residues 27 and 28 is at least as efficient as between residues 116 and 117. This labeling method does not require organic solvent or nonphysiological pH values and thus may be useful for the discovery of novel protease substrates in cells or other in vivo systems or for diagnostic applications.
