https://openalex.org/W2063589273,"The tumor suppressor protein p53 is ubiquitously expressed as a major isoform of 53 kD, but several forms of lower molecular weight have been observed. Here, we describe a new isoform, ΔN-p53, produced by internal initiation of translation at codon 40 and lacking the N-terminal first transactivation domain. This isoform has impaired transcriptional activation capacity, and does not complex with the p53 regulatory protein Mdm2. Furthermore, ΔN-p53 oligomerizes with full-length p53 (FL-p53) and negatively regulates its transcriptional and growth-suppressive activities. Consistent with the lack of Mdm2 binding, ΔN-p53 does not accumulate in response to DNA-damage, suggesting that this isoform is not involved in the response to genotoxic stress. However, in serum-starved cells expressing wild-type p53, ΔN-p53 becomes the predominant p53 form during the synchronous progression into S phase after serum stimulation. These results suggest that ΔN-p53 may play a role as a transient, negative regulator of p53 during cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W1557467023,"CYR61 (CCN1) is an extracellular matrix-associated protein of the CCN family, which also includes CTGF (CCN2), NOV (CCN3), WISP-1 (CCN4), WISP-2 (CCN5), and WISP-3 (CCN6). Purified CYR61 induces neovascularization in corneal implants, and Cyr61-null mice suffer embryonic death due to vascular defects, thus establishing that CYR61 is an important regulator of angiogenesis. Aberrant expression ofCyr61 is associated with breast cancer, wound healing, and vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and restenosis. In culture, CYR61 functions through integrin-mediated pathways to promote cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. Here we show that CYR61 can also promote cell survival and tubule formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Furthermore, we have dissected the integrin receptor requirements of CYR61 with respect to its pro-angiogenic activities. Thus, CYR61-induced cell adhesion and tubule formation occur through interaction with integrin α6β1 in early passage endothelial cells in which integrins have not been activated. By contrast, in endothelial cells in which integrins are activated by phorbol ester or vascular endothelial growth factor, CYR61-promoted cell adhesion, migration, survival, growth factor-induced mitogenesis, and endothelial tubule formation are all mediated through integrin αvβ3. These findings indicate that CYR61 is an activation-dependent ligand of integrin αvβ3 and an activation-independent ligand of integrin α6β1 and that these integrins differentially mediate the pro-angiogenic activities of CYR61. These findings help to define the mechanisms by which CYR61 acts as an angiogenic regulator, provide a molecular interpretation for the loss of vascular integrity and increased apoptosis of vascular cells inCyr61-null mice, and underscore the importance of CYR61 in the development and homeostasis of the vascular system.

Angiogenesis, the formation of new vessels by sprouting from pre-existing ones, is critical for embryonic development, pregnancy, and placentation as well as wound healing and tissue repair (1Yancopoulos G.D.

Imbalance in angiogenesis can underlie or exacerbate a variety of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic retinopathy, and cancer (2Folkman J. Semin. Oncol. 2001; 28: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis begins with degradation of the basement membrane that surrounds the parental vessel, followed by endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and assembly into tubular structures that convey blood supply to target tissues. These processes are regulated by the coordinated interaction of endothelial cells with both angiogenesis-inducing factors and components of the extracellular matrix (3Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. Curr.

Members of the CCN family are organized into four distinct structural domains with sequence similarities to insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins, von Willebrand factor type C repeat, thrombospondin type I repeat, and carboxyl-terminal domains of extracellular matrix proteins such as von Willebrand factor and mucins. Encoded by a growth factor-inducible immediate-early gene, CYR61 is a cysteine-rich matricellular protein that supports cell adhesion and induces adhesion signaling (10Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P.

Furthermore, CYR61 stimulates endothelial cell migration and enhances growth factor-induced DNA synthesis in culture (10Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and induces angiogenesis in vivo (13Babic A.M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Muntean A.G. Chen C.-C. Stolz D.B. Watkins S.C. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar).Cyr61-null mice suffer embryonic death due to vascular defects that include undervascularization of the placental labyrinth and loss of vascular integrity in the embryo. Large vessels of CYR61-deficient mice show a disorganized basal lamina, paucity of smooth muscle cells that normally comprise the vessel wall, and vascular cells undergoing apoptosis (14Mo F.-E. Muntean A.G. Chen C.-C. Stolz D.B. Watkins S.C. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). Consistent with the angiogenic activity of CYR61, its expression is elevated in healing wounds (15Chen C.-C. Mo F.-E. Lau L.F. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2540-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).Mechanistically, CYR61 acts as a non-RGD-containing ligand of integrin receptors (8Lau L.F. Lam S.C.-T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248 (C.S. C.): 44-57SCrossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Integrins are heterodimeric cell-surface receptors capable of transducing extracellular signals and functions to regulate cell adhesion, motility, proliferation, survival, and differentiation (20Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3785) Google Scholar, 21Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: E65-E68Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Thus, extracellular ligand binding to integrins can transduce “outside-in signaling” similar to a growth factor receptor. Conversely, intracellular molecules that interact with the integrin cytoplasmic domains can also induce “inside-out signaling,” thereby “activating” the integrin to adopt a conformational change that results in enhanced affinity for ligands (22Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that integrin αvβ3, a prominent integrin in angiogenic endothelial cells, can be activated either through serial passage in culture or by stimulation with agonists such as growth factors and phorbol ester tumor promoters. Activation can also be accomplished by binding of monoclonal antibodies or manganese to the extracellular domains of integrins, thereby inducing a conformational change (22Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 23Pampori N. Hato T. Stupack D.G. Aidoudi S. Cheresh D.A. Nemerow G.R. Shattil S.J. J. Biol.

To understand the mechanisms of CYR61 actions, we have identified the integrin receptors mediating each of five pro-angiogenic activities: endothelial cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, survival, and tubule formation. We show that integrin α6β1 mediates CYR61-supported cell adhesion and tubule formation in unactivated endothelial cells. By contrast, when integrins are activated by stimulation of endothelial cells with agonists, CYR61 promotes cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, survival, and tubule formation through integrin αvβ3.DISCUSSIONThe primary findings of this study provide new insights into the angiogenic actions of CYR61, an essential regulator of mammalian vascular development. Functionally, we have documented two novel activities of CYR61, establishing its ability to promote vascular endothelial cell survival and tubule formation. Mechanistically, we have identified the cell-surface receptors mediating each of five pro-angiogenic activities of CYR61. In agonist-stimulated endothelial cells in which integrins are activated, CYR61-promoted cell adhesion, migration, survival, growth factor-induced mitogenesis, and endothelial tubule formation are all mediated through integrin αvβ3. By contrast, CYR61-induced cell adhesion and tubule formation occur through interaction with integrin α6β1 in early passage endothelial cells in which integrins have not been activated. These findings indicate that CYR61 is an activation-dependent ligand of integrin αvβ3 and an activation-independent ligand of integrin α6β1, provide a mechanistic interpretation for certain phenotypes in Cyr61-null mice, and suggest a role for CYR61 in vessel development and maintenance.For new vessels to form, endothelial cells must migrate, proliferate, and differentiate into tubule structures. Consistent with these requisite cellular processes, CYR61 has been shown to promote endothelial cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation in culture (10Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and to induce angiogenesis in corneal implants (13Babic A.M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6355-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Data presented herein show that CYR61 also promotes endothelial cell survival (Fig. 5) and formation of endothelial tubules (Figs. 6 and 7). Together, these findings demonstrate that in a purified form, CYR61 can act directly upon endothelial cells to promote each of the requisite cellular steps of angiogenesis. CYR61 is also known to up-regulate the expression of other potent angiogenic inducers such as VEGF-A and VEGF-C in fibroblasts (15Chen C.-C. Mo F.-E. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47329-47337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Thus, the angiogenic actions of CYR61 can be both direct and indirect.During embryonic development, Cyr61 expression is notable in the cardiovascular system, especially in vascular endothelial cells and in smooth muscle cells surrounding the larger vessels (16Latinkic B.V. Mo F.-E. Greenspan J.A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Lau L.F. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2549-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 33Kireeva M.L. Latinkic B.V. Kolesnikova T.V. Chen C.-C. Yang G.P. Abler A.S. Lau L.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 233: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The importance of CYR61 in vascular development has been established by mutational analysis via gene targeting in mice. Cyr61-null mice suffer undervascularization of the placental labyrinth and loss of vascular integrity in large vessels, resulting in embryonic death (14Mo F.-E. Muntean A.G. Chen C.-C. Stolz D.B. Watkins S.C. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). In particular, large vessels in Cyr61-null embryos display a disorganized basal lamina with vascular cells undergoing apoptosis. This finding is consistent with the observation that by acting as an adhesion substrate, CYR61 can provide an anti-apoptotic function to endothelial cells (Figs. 5). Enhanced cell survival is critical for endothelial cells in the angiogenic process as they undergo migration, mitogenesis, and differentiation. It is interesting to note that WISP-1, a closely related protein of the CCN family, can promote cell survival through activation of the Akt pathway (38Su F. Overholtzer M. Besser D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).CYR61 acts as a non-RGD-containing ligand of integrin receptors, which mediate many of its activities. The utilization of integrins by CYR61 is cell type- and function-specific. For example, cell adhesion to CYR61 in platelets and monocytes is mediated through integrins αIIbβ3 and αMβ2, respectively, whereas cell adhesion and migration in smooth muscle cells are mediated through integrin α6β1 (32Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Lindner V. Chen N. Lam S.C.-T. Lau L.F. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1441-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 39Jedsadayanmata A. Chen C.-C. Kireeva M.L. Lau L.F. Lam S.C.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 (C.S. C.): 24321-24327SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 40Schober J.M. Chen N. Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Emeson E.E. Ugarova T.P. Ye R.D. Lau L.F. Lam S.C.-T. Blood. 2002; 99: 4457-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Remarkably, CYR61 promotes fibroblast adhesion, migration, and proliferation through integrins α6β1, αvβ5, and αvβ3, respectively (31Chen N. Chen C.-C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24953-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 41Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Kirschling D.J. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21943-21950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that CYR61 can selectively utilize either integrin α6β1 or αvβ3 in endothelial cells to mediate cell adhesion, depending on the activation state of the cell. Together, these findings demonstrate that CYR61 interacts with distinct integrins in a cell type-, function-, and activation state-specific manner to mediate disparate biological activities.Integrins are capable of transducing extracellular signals into the cell via ligand binding in outside-in signaling, analogous to signal transduction by growth factor receptors (20Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3785) Google Scholar, 21Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: E65-E68Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). It has been recognized that integrins are also capable of inside-out signaling, whereby interaction of intracellular molecules with the cytoplasmic domains of the integrin subunits can lead to a conformational change in the extracellular domains, resulting in an “activated” conformation with increased ligand binding affinity (22Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Inside-out signaling has been particularly well established for integrins β2 and β3, and these integrins can be activated by either physiological (e.g. growth factors and cytokines) or nonphysiological (e.g. antibodies and Mn2+) agents. In this study, we have shown that CYR61 is another example of an activation-dependent ligand of integrin αvβ3. It is notable that other ligands such as fibrinogen can bind integrin αvβ3 in an activation-independent manner (30Byzova T.V. Plow E.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 2081-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). β1 integrins also undergo activation, as demonstrated by the existence of anti-LIBS antibodies against the β1 subunit (22Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, activation does not appear to alter the affinity of integrin α6β1 for CYR61.A wealth of evidence indicates that integrins play important roles in angiogenesis, and in particular, signaling through αvintegrins has long been implicated in angiogenic events (3Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). A number of angiogenic regulators can bind directly to integrins, which mediate at least some of their activities (43Smyth S.S. Patterson C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). VEGF- and basic fibroblast growth factor-induced angiogenesis has been shown to require integrins αvβ5 and αvβ3, respectively, in angiogenesis assays using rabbit corneal pocket implants and chick chorioallantoic membrane (3Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Furthermore, integrins have been known to associate with growth factor receptors, and cross-talk between the two receptor systems is evident (21Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: E65-E68Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 43Smyth S.S. Patterson C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Notably, VEGF receptors can associate with αv integrins and can function to activate integrin αvβ3strongly (28Byzova T.V. Goldman C.K. Pampori N. Thomas K.A. Bett A. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 851-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Soldi R. Mitola S. Strasly M. Defilippi P. Tarone G. Bussolino F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Thus, it is surprising that extensive vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and organogenesis can occur in mice that lack all αv integrins, indicating that the roles of αv integrins are nonessential in the early phases of mammalian development (45Bader B.L. Rayburn H. Crowley D. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1998; 95: 507-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). All αv-null mice develop normally to embryonic day 9.5, although 80% die in mid-gestation due to deficient placentation, and the remaining 20% are born alive, but suffer intracerebral and intestinal hemorrhages. Interestingly, pathological angiogenesis is clearly abnormal in integrin β3 and β5 knockout mice, suggesting that molecular requirements may differ for developmental versuspathological angiogenesis (46Reynolds L.E. Wyder L. Lively J.C. Taverna D. Robinson S.D. Huang X. Sheppard D. Hynes R.O. Hodivala-Dilke K.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar).Integrin α6β1 is the principal adhesion receptor for CYR61 in unactivated endothelial cells, and CYR61 induces endothelial tubular networks in both collagen gels and Matrigel (Fig. 6) (data not shown). Matrigel, a basement membrane extract, can support a basal level of endothelial tubule formation without additional angiogenic factors and can promote tumor growth in mice when co-injected with tumor cells (47Fridman R. Giaccone G. Kanemoto T. Martin G.R. Gazdar A.F. Mulshine J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6698-6702Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Although the signals that promote tubule formation in Matrigel are not well defined, it was found to be dependent upon integrin α6β1, rather than integrin αvβ3 (48Bauer J. Margolis M. Schreiner C. Edgell C.J. Azizkhan J. Lazarowski E. Juliano R.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 153: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 49Davis G.E. Camarillo C.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 50Dallabrida S.M. De Sousa M.A. Farrell D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32281-32288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Given that CYR61 can induce endothelial tubule formation via integrin α6β1, we explored the possible presence of CCN family members in Matrigel. Interestingly, we found that CTGF can be detected by immunoblotting in the range of 2–5 μg/ml, depending on the batch of Matrigel (data not shown). Inasmuch as the cellular and angiogenic activities of CYR61 and CTGF are very similar (39Jedsadayanmata A. Chen C.-C. Kireeva M.L. Lau L.F. Lam S.C.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 (C.S. C.): 24321-24327SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), this concentration of CTGF is likely close to the active range. Thus, endothelial tubule formation observed in Matrigel in the absence of additional factors may be due, at least in part, to the activities of CTGF acting through integrin α6β1.Although it is notable that β1-null mice fail to develop a vasculature (51Fassler R. Meyer M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1896-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), it is unclear which β1 integrin plays the most critical roles in vascular development. Although the precise role of integrin α6β1 in angiogenesis is currently unknown, our data indicate that integrin α6β1 may participate in the angiogenic process. To date, only a few ligands are known for integrin α6β1; these include laminin, CYR61, CTGF, and a collagen fragment known as tumstatin (11Chen C.-C. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol.

In addition, the bacterial protein invasin and the sperm surface protein fertilin also bind integrin α6β1, although these proteins are not expected to play a role in developmental angiogenesis (53Isberg R.R.

Tumstatin is a 28-kDa fragment of the type IV collagen α3 chain that inhibits angiogenesis, displays both anti-angiogenic and pro-apoptotic activities, and binds both integrins α6β1 and αvβ3(52Maeshima Y. Colorado P.C. Kalluri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23745-23750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Two RGD-independent integrin αvβ3-binding sites in tumstatin confer anti-angiogenic activities, although the role of integrin α6β1 in tumstatin function is unknown (55Maeshima Y. Manfredi M.

Interestingly, whereas short-term stimulation of endothelial cells by angiogenic cytokines such as fibroblast growth factor-β leads to acute activation of integrins, prolonged treatment leads to up-regulation of integrin α6β1 and down-regulation of integrin αvβ3 (42Klein S. Giancotti F.G. Presta M. Albelda S.M. Buck C.A. Rifkin D.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that during the early phase of vessel sprouting, activated endothelial cells may utilize integrin αvβ3 to mediate the angiogenic response. In the late phases of angiogenesis and upon withdrawal of inducing signals, maintenance of vessel integrity may occur via integrin α6β1. The possibility that integrins αvβ3 and α6β1may be selectively utilized to play distinct roles in vessel sprouting and maintenance during different phases of angiogenesis is intriguing and merits further investigation. Angiogenesis, the formation of new vessels by sprouting from pre-existing ones, is critical for embryonic development, pregnancy, and placentation as well as wound healing and tissue repair (1Yancopoulos G.D.

Oncol. 2001; 28: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis begins with degradation of the basement membrane that surrounds the parental vessel, followed by endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and assembly into tubular structures that convey blood supply to target tissues. These processes are regulated by the coordinated interaction of endothelial cells with both angiogenesis-inducing factors and components of the extracellular matrix (3Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. Curr.

https://openalex.org/W2328332463,"Primary B cells from B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) were resistant to the novel selective cytotoxic agent, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Low levels of the death-inducing TRAIL receptors, TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 but not the putative 'decoy' receptors, TRAIL-R3 and TRAIL-R4, were expressed on the surface of B-CLL cells. Resistance to TRAIL was upstream of caspase-8 activation, as little or no caspase-8 was processed in TRAIL-treated B-CLL cells. Low levels of a TRAIL death-inducing signalling complex (DISC) were formed in these cells, accompanied by the recruitment of endogenous FADD, caspase-8 and c-FLIP(L) but not c-FLIP(S). Both caspase-8 and c-FLIP(L) were cleaved to form two stable intermediates of approximately 43 kDa, which remained associated with the DISC. Caspase-8 was not further processed to its active heterotetramer. Thus the resistance of B-CLL cells to TRAIL may be due partly to low surface expression of the death receptors resulting in low levels of DISC formation and also to the high ratio of c-FLIP(L) to caspase-8 within the DISC, which would prevent further activation of caspase-8. Our results highlight the possibility of sensitising B-CLL cells to TRAIL by modulation of c-FLIP levels or by upregulation of surface expression of death receptors."

In this report, we show that treatment of the mouse pancreatic β-cell line MIN6 with GLP1 leads to the glucose-dependent activation of Erk. These effects are mimicked by forskolin, a direct activator of adenylate cyclase, and blocked by H89, an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Additionally, we provide evidence that GLP1-stimulated activation of Erk requires an influx of calcium through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels and the activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.

Additionally, dominant negative forms of Ras(N17) and Rap1(N17) fail to block GLP1-stimulated activation of Erk. In conclusion, our results indicate that, in the presence of stimulatory concentrations of glucose, GLP1 stimulates the activation of Erk through a mechanism dependent on MEK but independent of both Raf and Ras.

Merkel P. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 143: 717-725Google Scholar). A major target for GLP1 action is the pancreatic β-cell, where it exerts multiple effects including the stimulation of β-cell proliferation, differentiation, insulin gene transcription, and the potentiation of glucose dependent insulin secretion (1Perfetti R. Merkel P. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 143: 717-725Google Scholar). These effects are mediated through the binding of GLP1 to its receptor (GLP1-R), a member of the secretin/glucagon/vasoactive intestinal peptide G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily, that can couple to Gαs-containing heterotrimeric G-proteins leading to the activation of adenylate cyclase and the increase in the production of cAMP (1Perfetti R. Merkel P. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 143: 717-725Google Scholar). However, it has also been reported that GLP1-R can also signal through Gαi and Gαqproteins (2Montrose-Rafizadeh C. Avdonin P. Garant M.J. Rodgers B.D. Kole S. Yang H. Levine M.A. Schwindinger W. Bernier M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1132-1140Google Scholar). In pancreatic β-cells, the binding of GLP1 to its receptor not only increases cAMP but also induces a rise in intracellular free Ca2+ levels through the closure of ATP sensitive K+ channels, an increase in Ca2+ influx through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-type VGCC), and Ca2+-dependent calcium release from intracellular stores (3Holz G.G.

Additionally, a number of kinases are activated upon GLP1 binding to their receptor, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and the extracellular regulated kinase, Erk (2Montrose-Rafizadeh C.

In a number of cell types, Erk activation has been shown to be important in many cellular processes including mitosis, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and the modulation of gene expression. Therefore, Erk activation is likely to be important in mediating a number of the effects induced by GLP1 in pancreatic β-cells. However, the mechanism by which GLP1 activates Erk in pancreatic β-cells is poorly understood. Typically, Erk1 and Erk2 are activated upon phosphorylation by the dual specificity tyrosine serine kinases, MEK1 and MEK2, which are themselves activated by one of several Raf isoforms, Raf1 (C-Raf), B-Raf, and A-Raf (8Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Google Scholar). The mechanism of Raf activation is complex and not fully understood; however, its activation is known to require the binding of the small G-proteins Ras or Rap1 in their GTP ligated forms (8Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Google Scholar). In many cell types, drugs or hormones that increase intracellular cAMP inhibit Erk signaling (9Chen J. Iyengar R. Science. 1994; 263: 1278-1281Google Scholar, 10Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Google Scholar, 11Cook S.J. McCormick F.

However, in other cell types, such as neuronal cells, increased intracellular cAMP leads to an increase in Erk activation (13Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Google Scholar, 14Dugan L.L. Kim J.S. Zhang Y. Bart R.D. Sun Y. Holtzman D.M. Gutmann D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25842-25848Google Scholar). cAMP activation or inhibition of Erk is thought to occur through the activation of either cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) or the cAMP-responsive Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Epac (15Stork P.J. Schmitt J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 258-266Google Scholar, 16de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Google Scholar).

Seger R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 91-99Google Scholar). However, in other cells types, the activation of Rap1 leads to the activation of B-Raf, which in turn activates Erk (12Qiu W.

PD098059, KN-93, KN-62, nifedipine, and Bay K8644 were all purchased from Calbiochem. U0126 was purchased from Promega. All other chemicals (unless stated) were obtained from Sigma. In this study, MIN6 cells were used between passages 25 and 35 at ∼80% confluence. MIN6 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin sulfate, and 75 μm β-mercaptoethanol, equilibrated with 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Prior to treatment, the medium was removed and the cells washed twice with HEPES-balanced Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (115 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm NaHCO3, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (KRB buffer). The cells were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in KRB buffer containing 1 mm glucose prior to incubation in KRB buffer containing 2.8 or 16.7 mm glucose and the test substances for the times indicated in the figure legends (details of treatments are provided in the figure legends). When cells were treated with elevated extracellular K+concentration, the K+ concentration in the KRB was increased to 50 mm and the Na+ concentration decreased to 70 mm to maintain isotonicity. In the calcium-free experiments, after preincubation the cells were incubated for 15 min in a calcium-free KRB buffer containing 1 mmEGTA and stimulated in the same buffer. All treatments were stopped by the addition of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% Triton, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm benzamidine HCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm sodium fluoride. The lysates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g. The supernatants were kept, and total protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The protein lysates were stored at −80 °C until further analysis. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described previously (19Herbert T.P. Kilhams G.R. Batty I.H. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11249-11256Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-phospho-Erk1/2 antibody recognizing only the activated forms of Erk was purchased from New England Biolabs. Mouse anti-Ras antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Detection was by horseraddish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit/mouse secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) wild type (+/+) or knock-out for B-Raf(−/−) were used as positive and negative controls for this assay. MEFs were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% (v/v) fetal calf serum for 24 h prior to stimulation by 10 ng/ml EGF for 5 min. Details of the MIN6 cell treatments are provided in the legend to Fig. 5b (and see section above “Cell Culture and Treatment”). Protein lysates were prepared as described by Maraiset al. (20Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Mason C.S. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4378-4383Google Scholar). Raf proteins were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C from 0.1 (for B-Raf) to 1 mg (for C-Raf and A-Raf) of cell extract with 2 μg of anti-Raf-1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories), 4 μg of anti-B-raf rabbit polyclonal antibody (21Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Google Scholar), and 2 μg of anti-A-Raf mouse monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories). The activity of each Raf protein was assessed by using the Raf kinase cascade assay using glutathione S-transferase (GST)-MEK, GST-ERK, and MBP as sequential substrates together with [γ-32P]ATP (20Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Mason C.S. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4378-4383Google Scholar). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min under constant agitation, the kinase reactions were stopped by addition of Laemmli sample buffer and boiled 5 min at 100 °C. The proteins were separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was fixed, dried, and the phosphorylation state of MBP, reflecting the activation state of the upstream kinase Raf, revealed by autoradiography. GST-Raf-1-Ras binding domain was expressed in Escherichia coli, affinity-purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), and then used to measure Ras activation in MIN6 cells and MEF according to the protocol found in the Upstate Biotechnology website, www.upstatebiotech.com (Lake Placid, NY). Briefly, serum-starved MEF or glucose-starved MIN6 cells (see “Cell Culture and Treatment for Details”) were stimulated with different agonists for 5 min and immediately lysed. Equal amounts of supernatant were incubated with Sepharose-coupled GST-Raf-1-Ras binding domain at 4 °C for 30 min. The bound proteins were separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the activated Ras was then visualized by immunoblotting using mouse anti-Ras antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Recombinant adenovirus containing Rap1aN17 (AdRapN17.EGFP) was prepared using the Adeasy system (22He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Google Scholar). The adenoviral and shuttle vectors were provided by Prof. Tong-Chuan He, Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, and the pMT2Ha-RapN17 plasmid was provided by Dr. J. L. Bos, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands. Briefly, the RapN17 sequence was amplified by PCR from the pMT2Ha-RapN17 plasmid as a HindIII/EcoRV fragment and ligated into a shuttle vector, pAd-Track.CMV, under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Co-transformation and recombination of the above construct with the adenoviral vector pAdEasy-1 resulted in a recombinant adenoviral plasmid, pAdRapN17.EGFP. The adenoviral plasmid was then transfected into HEK 293 cells, and adenovirus AdRapN17.EGFP was obtained by extracting the cells 7–10 days after transfection. EGFP expression was used to monitor the production of the virus following several round of amplification into HEK 293 cells. The control adenovirus expressing EGFP (AdEmpty.EGFP, a gift from Dr. J. Carter, University of Leicester) and the recombinant adenovirus AdRasN17 containing RasN17 (a gift from Prof. B. Khan and Dr. C. Sutherland) were amplified in a similar manner. To infect MIN6 cells, AdRapN17.EGFP, AdRasN17, or AdEmpty.EGFP were mixed with culture medium, and cells were exposed to the viruses with 100–200 multiplicity of infection for 24 h prior to perform the experiment. Under these conditions, >90% of cells were infected, as determined by EGFP expression. To investigate the mechanism by which GLP1 activates Erk, we initially characterized the activation of Erk in response to GLP1 in the pancreatic β-cell line MIN6, a cell line that synthesizes and secretes insulin in response to physiologically relevant glucose concentrations (23Ishihara H. Asano T. Tsukuda K. Katagiri H. Inukai K. Anai M. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Miyazaki J.I. Oka Y. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 1139-1145Google Scholar, 24Skelly R.H. Schuppin G.T. Ishihara H. Oka Y. Rhodes C.J. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 37-43Google Scholar). MIN6 cells were preincubated for 1 h in KRB supplemented with 1 mm glucose. The cells were then incubated in 2.8 or 16.7 mm glucose in the presence of absence of either GLP1 or forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase. Samples were taken over a 30-min time course and the activation state of Erk investigated using a phospho-specific antibody against the activated forms of Erk. No activation of Erk was detected when MIN6 cells were incubated in KRB supplemented with 2.8 mmglucose (Fig. 1). However, when MIN6 cells were incubated in KRB supplemented with 2.8 mmglucose in the presence of GLP1, a transient increase in the activation of Erk was detected at 5 min (Fig. 1). Incubation of cells in KRB supplemented with 16.7 mm glucose led to an activation of Erk compared with cells incubated at 2.8 mm glucose (Fig. 1). This is in agreement with previous reports indicating that glucose can activate Erk in MIN6 cells (25Benes C. Roisin M.P. Van Tan H. Creuzet C. Miyazaki J. Fagard R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15507-15513Google Scholar, 26Benes C. Poitout V. Marie J.C. Martin-Perez J. Roisin M.P. Fagard R. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 219-225Google Scholar). However, GLP1 treatment in the presence of 16.7 mm glucose led to a robust, rapid, and sustained increase in Erk activation, with maximal activation between 5 and 15 min. GLP1 stimulation of Erk was mimicked by forskolin at either 2.8 or 16.7 mm glucose (Fig. 1). As GLP1 or forskolin can activate adenylate cyclase, and both activate Erk via a glucose-dependent mechanism, the activation of Erk by GLP1 or forskolin is likely to be mediated through similar pathways. GLP1 or forskolin potentiates glucose-dependent insulin secretion (1Perfetti R. Merkel P. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 143: 717-725Google Scholar), therefore glucose-dependent GLP1 activation of Erk could be mediated by an autocrine effect of insulin. To investigate this possibility, MIN6 cells were incubated in KRB supplemented with 2.8 or 16.7 mm glucose and treated with 1 μm insulin in the presence or absence of GLP1. Insulin treatment did not lead to Erk activation and had no stimulatory effect on GLP1 induced Erk activation. This indicates that GLP1 activation of Erk is not mediated by insulin (results not shown). Since glucose-dependent GLP1 activation of Erk is mimicked by forskolin, it is likely to be mediated through the activation of adenylate cyclase. To determine the role of PKA in GLP1 activation of Erk, MIN6 cells were treated with GLP1 or as a control forskolin, in KRB supplemented with 16.7 mm glucose in either the presence or absence of the PKA inhibitor, H89, at a concentration shown to block forskolin stimulation of Erk. H89 inhibited both GLP1- and forskolin-stimulated Erk activation (Fig. 2). As GLP1-stimulated activation of Erk is mimicked by forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, and inhibited by H89, an inhibitor of PKA, it is probable that GLP1-stimulated activation of Erk is mediated by the activation of adenylate cyclase, leading to an increase in intracellular cAMP and the subsequent activation of PKA. Glucose metabolism in pancreatic β-cells leads to an increase in intracellular calcium through an influx of calcium through L-type VGCC, which is augmented by hormones such as GLP1 (27Holz G.G. Habener J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 388-393Google Scholar, 28Holz G.G. Kuhtreiber W.M. Habener J.F. Nature. 1993; 361: 362-365Google Scholar). This rise in intracellular Ca2+ regulates a number of important pancreatic β-cell functions including insulin secretion (1Perfetti R. Merkel P. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 143: 717-725Google Scholar). To determine whether Ca2+ influx is an important determinant in GLP1-stimulated Erk activation, MIN6 cells were incubated at 16.7 mm glucose in the presence or absence of EGTA to chelate extracellular calcium (Fig. 3a). GLP1 treatment led to the activation of Erk, which was inhibited by the presence EGTA (Fig. 3a). Therefore, GLP1 requires an influx of extracellular calcium to stimulate Erk. To investigate whether an increase in intracellular calcium is sufficient for GLP1-stimulated Erk activation, MIN6 cells were treated with the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, to artificially raise intracellular calcium concentrations, in the presence or absence of GLP1 at 2.8 or 16.7 mm glucose (Fig. 3b). Treatment of MIN6 cells with ionomycin in the presence of 2.8 or 16.7 mm glucose had no effect on Erk activation. Treatment of MIN6 with ionomycin and GLP1 at 2.8 mm glucose also had no effect on Erk activation (Fig. 3b). Additionally, GLP1-stimulated Erk activation in the presence of 16.7 mm glucose was unaffected by the presence of ionomycin (Fig. 3b). These results indicate that an influx of extracellular calcium is not sufficient for GLP1-stimulated Erk activation. However, it is possible that the mode of calcium entry is important in GLP1-stimulated Erk activation and that Ca2+must enter through L-type VGCC to be effective in signaling to Erk. To investigate this possibility, MIN6 cells were treated with GLP1 at 16.7 mm glucose in the presence or absence of nifedipine, an L-type VGCC blocker. GLP1-stimulated activation of Erk was inhibited by the presence of nifedipine (Fig. 3c). Therefore, GLP1 stimulation of Erk is mediated through an influx of extracellular calcium through L-type VGCC. To determine whether Ca2+influx through L-type VGCC was sufficient for Erk activation, cells were incubated in the presence of 1) increased extracellular K+ concentration, which leads to the depolarization of the membrane, the opening of L-type VGCC, and the influx of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 3d) or 2) Bay K8644, an L-type VGCC agonist (Fig. 3e). Incubation of MIN6 cells in 50 mm extracellular K+ led to a strong stimulation of Erk (Fig. 3d). To demonstrate that this was mediated through Ca2+ influx through L-type VGCC, the experiment was also conducted in the presence of nifedipine or EGTA. Both treatments inhibited K+-induced Erk activation (Fig. 3d). This is in agreement with previous reports demonstrating that K+-induced Erk activation in MIN6 cells requires the influx of Ca2+ through L-type VGCC (25Benes C. Roisin M.P. Van Tan H. Creuzet C. Miyazaki J. Fagard R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15507-15513Google Scholar, 26Benes C. Poitout V. Marie J.C. Martin-Perez J. Roisin M.P. Fagard R. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 219-225Google Scholar). Additionally, treatment of MIN6 cells with Bay K8644 alone was sufficient to induce Erk activation (Fig. 3e). Taken together, these results indicate that an influx of Ca2+through L-Type VGCC is sufficient for Erk activation and is necessary for GLP1-stimulated Erk activation. However, it is unclear whether the influx of Ca2+ through L-type VGCC is both necessary and sufficient for GLP1-stimulated Erk activation. Indeed, GLP1 may be providing additional signals, which are important for GLP1-stimulated Erk activation. GLP1 stimulation of Erk requires an influx of extracellular calcium through L-type VGCC. Many of the effects of calcium on intracellular signaling are mediated through Ca2+-binding proteins such as calmodulin. Therefore, we initially investigated the role of calmodulin in GLP1-stimulated Erk activation. MIN6 cells were preincubated for 45 min with W7, a competitive inhibitor of calmodulin, prior to incubation in KRB containing 16.7 mm glucose in the presence of GLP1 (Fig. 4a). Treatment of cells with W7 led to a dose-dependent inhibition of GLP1-stimulated Erk activation indicating that calmodulin is likely to be required for GLP1-stimulated Erk activation (Fig. 4a). Given the important role calmodulin plays in the activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaM kinases) and the role CaM kinase II plays in insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells, we investigated the potential role of CaM kinase II in GLP1-mediated Erk activation using selective inhibitors of CaM kinase II, KN62 and KN93 (29Williams C.L. Phelps S.H. Porter R.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 707-715Google Scholar, 30Fan G.H. Wang L.Z. Qiu H.C. Ma L. Pei G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 39-45Google Scholar). MIN6 cells were incubated with either KN62 or KN93 for 30 min or 1 h, respectively, prior to incubation in KRB supplemented with 16.7 mm glucose and GLP1 (Fig. 4,b and c). Treatment of cells with either KN62 or KN93 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of GLP1-stimulated Erk activation (Fig. 4, b and c). These results indicate that calmodulin and the activation of CaM kinase II may be required for glucose-dependent GLP1 activation of Erk. To further investigate the signaling pathway by which GLP1 stimulates Erk activation, we investigated the role of MEK, the upstream kinase of Erk, using two structurally distinct specific inhibitors of MEK, PD098059 and U0126 (Fig. 5a). MIN6 cells were pretreated with either PD098059 or U0126 prior to treatment with either GLP1 or forskolin in the presence of 16.7 mm glucose, or 1 μm TPA as control. The activation of Erk was monitored using a phospho-specific antibody to Erk (Fig. 5a). Both PD098059 and U0126 inhibited GLP1- and forskolin-stimulated Erk activation, indicating that the activation of MEK is necessary for GLP1- and forskolin-induced Erk activation (Fig. 5a). MEK is phosphorylated and activated by several isoforms of Raf including Raf1 (C-Raf), B-Raf, and A-Raf. Therefore, we measured the activation of all three endogenous isoforms of Raf upon treatment with GLP1 using the immunoprecipitation kinase cascade assay (Fig. 5b) (20Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Mason C.S. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4378-4383Google Scholar). MIN6 cells were treated for the times indicated in Fig. 5b, with 10 nm GLP1 or 10 μm forskolin in the presence of 16.7 mm glucose or 1 μm TPA as control. Protein lysates were prepared, and Raf proteins were immunoprecipitated using antibodies specific to the three Raf isoforms (A-Raf, B-Raf, and C-Raf). The immunoprecipitates were incubated with GST-MEK, GST-ERK, MBP, and [γ-32P]ATP and the activity of Raf assessed by monitoring the phosphorylation state of MBP. MEFs (immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts) wild type (+/+) or knock-out for B-raf (−/−), treated or not with 10 ng/ml EGF, were used as positive and negative controls for this experiment (Fig. 5b) (31Huser M. Luckett J. Chiloeches A. Mercer K. Iwobi M. Giblett S. Sun X.M. Brown J. Marais R. Pritchard C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1940-1951Google Scholar). In agreement with previous studies (31Huser M. Luckett J. Chiloeches A. Mercer K. Iwobi M. Giblett S. Sun X.M. Brown J. Marais R. Pritchard C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1940-1951Google Scholar), B-Raf had elevated basal activity in unstimulated cells, whereas both Raf-1 and A-Raf were inactive (data not shown). As expected, no B-Raf activity was detected in the MEF B-raf(−/−) cells. EGF stimulated the activities of the three Raf isoforms (B-Raf, A-Raf, and C-Raf) in the B-raf(+/+) MEFs and the activities of A-Raf and C-Raf in the B-raf knock-out cells. In the MIN6 cell line, TPA stimulation led to the activation of both A-Raf and C-Raf kinases (Fig. 5b). In contrast, conditions that lead to the activation of Erk, glucose plus GLP-1 or glucose plus forskolin, did not lead to the activation of any of the three Raf isoforms, A-Raf, B-Raf, or C-Raf (Fig. 5b). To further support these findings we investigated the effect of overexpressing dominant negative Rap1(N17) or Ras(N17) on GLP1 stimulation of Erk. MIN6 cells were mock-infected or infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing either empty vector (AdEmpty.EGFP), Rap1N17 (AdRap1N17.EGFP), or RasN17 (AdRasN17). 24 h post-infection, the cells were treated for 5 min with 16.7 mm glucose alone or 16.7 mm glucose plus GLP1 or EGF and the activation status of Erk determined (Fig. 5c). The overexpression of dominant negative Rap1 had no detectable inhibitory effect on the ability of GLP1 or EGF to stimulate Erk activation (Fig. 5c). The overexpression of dominant negative Ras had no detectable inhibitory effect on the ability of GLP1 to stimulate Erk activation but effectively inhibited EGF-stimulated Erk activation (Fig. 5c). Therefore, GLP1-stimulated Erk activation appears to be independent of both Ras and Raf. As an adjunct to the above, we also investigated the activation of Ras in response to agonist stimulation. Ras activation was assayed with a GST-Raf1-Ras binding domain fusion protein, which associates exclusively with the GTP-bound form of Ras, but not with the GDP-bound form of Ras in vitro. Stimulation of MIN6 cells with GLP1 did not lead to an increase in the binding of GTP-bound Ras to GST-Raf1-Ras binding domain compared with cells incubated in 16.7 mm glucose alone (Fig. 5d, panel i). This indicates that Ras is not activated by GLP1 (Fig. 5d,panel i). In contrast, EGF or TPA treatment of MIN6 cells and EGF treatment of wild type MEFs caused a significant increase in the activation of Ras as shown by the increased amount of the GTP-bound form of Ras bound to the GST-Raf1-Ras binding domain (Fig. 5d, panel i). Taken together, these data indicate that glucose-dependent GLP1 stimulation of Erk is independent of the activation of A-Raf, B-Raf, C-Raf, or Ras. In pancreatic β-cells, GLP1 activates the extracellular regulated kinase, Erk (2Montrose-Rafizadeh C. Avdonin P. Garant M.J. Rodgers B.D. Kole S. Yang H. Levine M.A. Schwindinger W. Bernier M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1132-1140Google Scholar, 6Buteau J. Foisy S. Rhodes C.J. Carpenter L. Biden T.J. Prentki M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2237-2243Google Scholar, 7Buteau J. Roduit R. Susini S. Prentki M. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 856-864Google Scholar), via a poorly understood mechanism. In this report, we provide evidence that, in the pancreatic β-cell line MIN6, glucose-dependent GLP1 activation of Erk is mediated by an influx of calcium through L-type VGCC and requires both the activation of PKA and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II). Furthermore, we show that GLP1 stimulates the activation of Erk via a mechanism independent of both Raf and Ras but dependent on the activation of MEK (Fig. 6). Glucose metabolism in pancreatic β-cells leads to an influx of calcium through L-type VGCC, which is augmented by hormones such as GLP1 (27Holz G.G. Habener J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 388-393Google Scholar, 28Holz G.G. Kuhtreiber W.M. Habener J.F. Nature. 1993; 361: 362-365Google Scholar). The rise in intracellular Ca2+ regulates a number of important pancreatic β-cell functions including insulin secretion (1Perfetti R. Merkel P. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 143: 717-725Google Scholar). Glucose-dependent GLP1 stimulation of Erk also requires Ca2+ entry specifically through L-type VGCC (Fig. 3). The entry of Ca2+ through L-type VGCC is also required for glucose- or K+-induced activation of Erk in MIN6 cells (25Benes C. Roisin M.P. Van Tan H. Creuzet C. Miyazaki J. Fagard R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15507-15513Google Scholar, 26Benes C. Poitout V. Marie J.C. Martin-Perez J. Roisin M.P. Fagard R. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 219-225Google Scholar). Indeed, it is both necessary and sufficient for Erk activation, as Bay K8644, an L-type VGCC agonist, activates Erk and nifedipine, an L-type VGCC blocker, inhibits Erk activation induced by an increase in extracellular K+ concentration (Fig. 3,d and e). Since the influx of Ca2+through L-type VGCC alone is sufficient for the activation of Erk, and GLP1 augments glucose-stimulated Ca2+ influx through L-type VGCC (4Holz G.G. Leech C.A. Heller R.S. Castonguay M. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14147-14156Google Scholar), it is possible that the increase influx of calcium is the principle signal by which GLP1 induces glucose-dependent Erk activation. However, it is equally possible that GLP1 activates additional signaling pathways that are important in the activation of Erk. In neurons, the influx of calcium through L-type VGCC also leads to the activation of Erk. This mode of Ca2+ entry is critical in determining which signaling pathway is activated and is thought to be mediated through the local increase in Ca2+concentration around the mouth of the L-type VGCC resulting in the binding of Ca2+/calmodulin to the L-type VGCC and the subsequent activation of Erk (32Dolmetsch R.E. Pajvani U. Fife K. Spotts J.M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2001; 294: 333-339Google Scholar). As the calmodulin agonist W7 blocks GLP1-stimulated Erk activation (Fig. 4a), it is possible that GLP1 stimulates Erk in pancreatic β-cells by a mechanism similar to that in neurons. Selective inhibitors of CaM kinase II, KN62 and KN93, inhibit GLP1-stimulated activation of Erk (Fig. 4, b andc), but these inhibitors have limited specificity and can interfere with both K+ and Ca2+ channel activity (33Bhatt H.S. Conner B.P. Prasanna G. Yorio T. Easom R.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1655-1663Google Scholar). However, it has previously been demonstrated that CaM kinase II is activated by glucose in pancreatic β-cells (34Easom R.A. Filler N.R. Ings E.M. Tarpley J. Landt M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2359-2364Google Scholar) and that the activation of CaM kinase II can mediate Erk activation in other cell types such as aortic and vascular smooth muscle cells (35Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30149-30157Google Scholar, 36Ginnan R. Singer H.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C754-C761Google Scholar). Therefore, it is probable that CaM kinase II mediates GLP1-stimulated Erk activation in MIN6 cells. Whether GLP1 potentiates glucose-stimulated activation of CaM kinase II and that this is both necessary and sufficient for GLP1 activation of Erk or whether glucose activation of CaM kinase II is necessary but GLP1 provides an additional input essential for the activation of Erk is unclear. In vascular smooth muscle cells, Ca2+-dependent activation of Erk requires the activation of CaM kinase II. In this case, Erk activation is dependent on the non-receptor proline-rich tyrosine kinase (PYK2) activation, the transactivation of the EGF receptor, and the subsequent activation of Raf (36Ginnan R. Singer H.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C754-C761Google Scholar). However, in our report we show that GLP1-stimulated Erk activation is independent of Raf, as no activation of all three isoforms of Raf was detected in anin vitro kinase assay (Fig. 5b), and dominant negative forms of Ras or Rap1 had no effect on GLP1-stimulated Erk activation (Fig. 5c). Moreover, GLP1-stimulated Erk activation did not lead to the activation of Ras, as no increase in the association of GTP-bound Ras to Raf was detected upon GLP1 treatment compared with control (Fig. 5d). This Raf-independent activation of Erk does not require the activation of the classical PKCs or PI 3-kinase, as the general classical PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide and inhibitors or PI 3-kinase, wortmannin or LY294002, failed to block GLP1-stimulated activation of Erk (results not shown). GLP1-stimulated Erk activation does require the activation of MEK as it is blocked by two structurally distinct inhibitors of MEK, PD098059 and U0126 (Fig. 5a). It is unlikely that CaM kinase II directly phosphorylates MEK at either Ser-218 or Ser-222, two sites important in MEK activation, as neither of these sites lie within the known optimal substrate recognition motif for CaM kinase II (37White R.R. Kwon Y.G. Taing M. Lawrence D.S. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3166-3172Google Scholar). However, CaM kinase II could phosphorylate an intermediate kinase necessary for MEK activation. One possible mechanism by which Erk could be activated by cAMP in a Raf-independent mechanism is through the regulation of binding of the protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), PTP-SL, STEP, and HePTP to Erk (38Saxena M. Williams S. Tasken K. Mustelin T. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 305-311Google Scholar, 39Blanco-Aparicio C. Torres J. Pulido R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1129-1136Google Scholar). When these protein-tyrosine phosphatases are bound to Erk, Erk is maintained in an inactive state; however, upon their activation by PKA, Erk is released and becomes activated (38Saxena M. Williams S. Tasken K. Mustelin T. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 305-311Google Scholar, 39Blanco-Aparicio C. Torres J. Pulido R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1129-1136Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2023051284,"INrf2 tethering of the transcription factor Nrf2 in the cytosol prevents Nrf2 activation of antioxidant response element (ARE) mediated gene expression. This investigation was undertaken to determine if tethering affected Nrf2 degradation. Data is presented showing that Nrf2 is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Nrf2 co-immunoprecipitated with a HA tagged ubiquitin polymer and accumulated in cells expressing inactive ubiquitin activating enzyme El. Inhibition of proteasome activity resulted in accumulation of Nrf2. The rate of Nrf2 degradation, measured under conditions where the majority of Nrf2 was not tethered, exhibited a T(1/2) of approximately 3 h. Over-expression of human INrf2, KIAA0132, blocked Nrf2 conjugation to the ubiquitin polymer and blocked Nrf2 degradation. These results suggest that association of Nrf2 with INrf2 inhibits ubiquitin-proteasome degradation of Nrf2. Maintaining the majority of Nrf2 in a tethered form, resistant to ubiquitin-proteasome dependent degradation, allows a pool of Nrf2 to be available for rapid Nrf2/ARE-dependent gene transcription following stress mediated release from INrf2. Further, the observation that free Nrf2 is degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway provides a potential mechanism by which ARE-dependent gene transcription is attenuated after induction."

Highly cationic properties of these PLA2 are important for Ca2+-independent binding and cell wall penetration, prerequisites for Ca2+-dependent degradation of membrane phospholipids and bacterial killing. To further delineate charge properties of the bacterial envelope important in Group IIA PLA2 action against S. aureus, we examined the effects of mutations that prevent specific modifications of cell wall (dltA) and cell membrane (mprF) polyanions. In comparison to the parent strain, isogenicdltA − bacteria are ∼30–100× more sensitive to PLA2, whereas mprF − bacteria are <3-fold more sensitive.

A diminished positive charge in PLA2 reduces PLA2 binding and antibacterial activity. In contrast, diminished cell wall negative charge by substitution of (lipo)teichoic acids with d-alanine reduces antibacterial activity of bound PLA2, but not initial PLA2 binding.

It has been shown that the bactericidal activity of inflammatory fluids against Staphylococcus aureus is due mostly to mobilized Group IIA PLA2 (5Weinrauch Y. Abad C. Liang N.S. Lowry S.F. Weiss J.

Elsbach, and J. P. Weiss, manuscript in preparation. In addition, transgenic mice with overexpressed PLA2 show much greater resistance to S. aureus than their non-transgenic littermates, implying a protective role of Group IIA PLA2against S. aureus infections in vivo (9Laine V.J. Grass D.S. Nevalainen T.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7402-7408Google Scholar, 10Laine V.J. Grass D.S. Nevalainen T.J. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 87-92Google Scholar). The ability of Group IIA PLA2 to attack S. aureus and other Gram-positive bacteria reflects the ability of the enzyme to bind to and penetrate the cell wall to gain access to phospholipids (PL) in the cell membrane. At least four steps are involved: binding of the enzyme to the bacterial cell surface, penetration of the enzyme through peptidoglycan layers, degradation of PL in the cell membrane, and activation of bacterial autolysins (11Foreman-Wykert A.K. Weinrauch Y. Elsbach P. Weiss J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 715-721Google Scholar). The phospholipolytic activity of PLA2 and, hence, ultimate bacterial killing requires calcium as a cofactor (8Weinrauch Y. Elsbach P. Madsen L.M. Foreman A. Weiss J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 250-257Google Scholar), but initial PLA2 binding to the cell surface does not. 3N. S. Liang, R. S. Koduri, M. H. Gelb, and J. P. Weiss, manuscript in preparation. Initial binding of PLA2 to the cell surface of S. aureus involves electrostatic interactions3 between PLA2 and the bacterial cell surface. Among the more than 100 structurally related low molecular weight (∼14 kDa) PLA2 that have been characterized to date, the mammalian Group IIA PLA2 are unique in their very high net positive charge ranging from +12 to +17. This very high net basicity is essential for the enzyme's potent bactericidal activity toward Gram-positive bacteria, principally by promoting initial interactions and penetration of the cell wall (12Weiss J.

The susceptibility of S. aureus to many small cationic antibacterial compounds is similarly increased indltA − or mprF − mutants, indicating that both cell wall and cell membrane polyanions are important determinants of bacterial sensitivity to these antibacterial compounds (19Peschel A. Otto M. Jack R.W. Kalbacher H. Jung G. Gotz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8405-8410Google Scholar, 20Peschel A. Jack R.W. Otto M. Collins L.V. Staubitz P. Nicholson G. Kalbacher H. Nieuwenhuizen W.F. Jung G. Tarkowski A. van Kessel K.P. van Strijp J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1067-1076Google Scholar). Because the cationic properties of PLA2seem important in the interactions of the enzyme with the bacterial cell wall but not the cell membrane, we hypothesized thatd-alanylation of cell wall LTA and TA would have a greater effect on bacterial susceptibility to PLA2 thanmprF-dependent modification of the cell membrane PG. The results presented confirm this scenario. We have made use of site-specific mutagenesis of the human Group IIA PLA2 to further demonstrate that the higher susceptibility of thedltA − strain does not depend on either the net charge of the PLA2 or higher initial binding of the enzyme to the bacterial surface of dltA − bacteria. Instead, the absence of d-alanine modification of LTA and TA probably results in pleitropic modifications of the staphylococcal cell wall that promote Ca2+-dependent attack of bacterial PL by bound PLA2.

Strains of S. aureus used were the parent SA113 (22Iordanescu S. Surdeanu M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1976; 96: 277-281Google Scholar), isogenicmprF − , dltA − (AG1) mutants and their corresponding complemented strains (mprF − pRB mprF anddltA −pRB dltA −, respectively; Refs. 19Peschel A.

Bacteria were grown overnight at 37 °C in BM broth (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, 0.1% K2HPO4, 0.1% glucose), washed, and resuspended in fresh medium with a starting OD550 of 0.05 and subcultured for 2–2.5 h until mid-log phase. Recombinant wild type and mutant human secretory Group IIA PLA2, R92E, K38E/K116E (16Koduri R.S. Baker S.F. Snitko Y. Han S.K. Cho W. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32142-32153Google Scholar), and D49S3 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (12Weiss J. Inada M. Elsbach P. Crowl R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26331-26337Google Scholar). Purity of PLA2 was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and by reversed-phase HPLC (12Weiss J. Inada M. Elsbach P. Crowl R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26331-26337Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of [D49S]PLA2 against autoclaved E. coli was ∼0.001% of wt PLA2.3 The effect of various antimicrobial proteins and peptides on bacterial viability was determined by measuring the ability of treated bacteria to form colonies on BM agar. Typical incubation mixtures contained 106 or 107 bacteria/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1% (w/v) BSA, and 1 mm CaCl2 ± indicated protein/peptide. In assays with [Ala8,13,18]Magainin II amide and HBD-3, CaCl2 was omitted, since these peptides are more sensitive to inhibition by added divalent cations than is PLA2. Incubations were carried out at 37 °C for up to 2 h. At each time point, aliquots of bacterial suspensions were serially diluted in sterile physiological saline and plated in 5 ml of molten (50 °C) BM agar. Bacterial viability was measured by counting bacterial colonies (i.e. colony-forming units (CFU)) after 18–24 h incubation at 37 °C. Bacterial PL were radiolableled during growth in subculture as previously described (11Foreman-Wykert A.K. Weinrauch Y. Elsbach P. Weiss J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 715-721Google Scholar). Briefly, bacteria were subcultured at 37 °C to mid-logarithmic phase in BM supplemented with 1 μCi/ml of [1-14C]oleic acid and 0.01% BSA, washed, resuspended in half the volume of fresh BM medium without [1-14C]oleic acid, and incubated for another 20 min at 37 °C. BSA was then added to the medium to a final concentration of 0.5% (w/v), and bacteria were washed to remove remaining free oleic acid. Washed bacteria were resuspended to desired concentrations in incubation medium and used promptly. Samples consisted of 107 bacteria/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1% (w/v) BSA, and 1 mmCaCl2 or in HBSS− supplemented as indicated. PL degradation products generated during PLA2 treatment were quantitatively recovered in the extracellular medium as complexes with BSA (11Foreman-Wykert A.K. Weinrauch Y. Elsbach P. Weiss J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 715-721Google Scholar). Therefore accumulation of radioactive material in extracellular supernatants after sedimentation (14,000 rpm for 4 min) of bacterial suspensions was used to routinely monitor PL degradation. To confirm that released 14C-labeled material corresponded to PL degradation, lipids of S. aureus present in whole cell suspensions and extracellular supernatants, with and without PLA2 incubation, were extracted using the method of Bligh and Dyer (23Bligh E.S. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). Extracted lipids were dried under N2flow, dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and resolved by thin layer chromatography (TLC) in a chloroform/methanol/water/acetic acid (65:25:4:1, v/v/v) solvent system. Lipids were identified by comparison to migration of lipid standards and quantified by phosphorimage analysis using PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences, Molecular Dynamics Division). Intact bacterial PL and PL breakdown products (i.e. lyso-PL and free fatty acids) were quantitatively recovered in the bacterial pellet and extracellular medium, respectively. To maximize detection of lysyl-PG, extracts were collected and analyzed by TLC within 3 h of the end of the incubation. Storage of extracts for longer times before recovery of labeled lipids in the chloroform phase and TLC led to diminished recovery of lysyl-PG, but had no effect on overall recovery of intact PL and PL breakdown products. However, lyso-PG is incompletely recovered in the chloroform phase of lipid extracts because of its increased polarity. PLA2 were radiolabeled with 125I in tubes precoated with IODO-GEN as described previously (12Weiss J. Inada M. Elsbach P. Crowl R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26331-26337Google Scholar, 24Forst S. Weiss J. Maraganore J.M. Heinrikson R.L. Elsbach P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 920: 221-225Google Scholar). Radiolabeled PLA2 was separated from free iodide by chromatography on Sephadex G25 (AmershamBiosciences) equilibrated with 0.2 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0. Recovered radiolabeled material was more than 95% trichloroacetic acid-precipitable. Binding assays were performed with 107 bacteria/ml in HBSS− supplemented with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 0.1% (w/v) BSA. To determine effects of envelope-associated Ca2+ and subsequent Ca2+-dependent envelope damage by PLA2 on PLA2 binding, parallel assays were carried out ± 2 mmMgCl2/2 mm EGTA. Radiolabeled 0.5 ng of125I-PLA2 (wild type or mutant PLA2) was mixed with 5 ng of unlabeled wild type or D49S PLA2 (1:10) before addition to the incubation mixture to ensure exposure of bacteria to similar destructive effects of PLA2 when Ca2+ was present, irrespective of the source of 125I-PLA2. Incubations were carried out in a total volume of 250 μl at 37 °C for 30 min. Bound125I-PLA2 was collected on Whatman glass microfiber GF/C filters that had been presoaked in 0.5% PEI/20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 15 min. Filters were washed five times with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Radioactivity associated with filters was measured in a gamma counter (Cobra IITM, Packard Biosciences Co.). S. aureus was grown as described above until mid-log phase in medium containing [14C]oleate. Metabolically labeled bacteria were harvested and resuspended at a final concentration of 4 × 109 bacteria/ml in Tris-buffered saline osmotically stabilized with 30% (w/v) raffinose. Lysostaphin and DNase I were added to a final concentration of 250 μg/ml and 500 μg/ml, respectively, and bacteria were incubated at a final concentration of 2 × 109 bacteria/ml, shaking slowly at 37 °C for 1 h. Protoplasts were collected by centrifugation at 4,500 rpm for 15 min at room temperature. The supernatant was removed, and protoplasts were gently resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 1% BSA, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mm CaCl2, and 30% raffinose in RPMI 1640. Greater than 80% of [14C]oleate-labeled bacterial PL of intact bacteria were present in the recovered protoplasts. The virtual absence of intact/viable bacteria in the recovered protoplast samples was confirmed by Gram staining and assay of CFU without raffinose. It has been previously shown thatdltA − and mprF − mutants of S. aureus are each ∼10–30-fold more susceptible to killing by small cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAP) than the parentdltA+/mprF+ S. aureus strain (19Peschel A. Otto M. Jack R.W. Kalbacher H. Jung G. Gotz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8405-8410Google Scholar, 20Peschel A. Jack R.W. Otto M. Collins L.V. Staubitz P. Nicholson G. Kalbacher H. Nieuwenhuizen W.F. Jung G. Tarkowski A. van Kessel K.P. van Strijp J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1067-1076Google Scholar). When comparing effects of the Group IIA PLA2 against wild type (wt) and the two mutantdltA − and mprF −strains, we obtained different results. WhereasdltA − bacteria were ∼30–100-fold more sensitive (Fig. 1, A,B, D, and I),mprF − bacteria were ≤3-fold more susceptible than wt S. aureus to PLA2 killing (Fig. 1,A, C, D, and I). In contrast, under the same test conditions, both mutant strains were ∼5× more sensitive to the small CAP [Ala8,13,18]Magainin II amide and HBD-3 (Fig. 1,G and H). Higher susceptibility of the mutantS. aureus strains to PLA2 was reversed by complementation with plasmid-bearing wild type dltA ormprF genes (Fig. 1, E and F). These findings demonstrate that dltA-dependent modifications of wall LTA and TA are much more important in resistance of S. aureus to PLA2 thanmprF-dependent modification of cell membrane PG. Killing of S. aureus by PLA2 depends on rapid degradation of membrane PL due to its catalytic activity and on activation of bacterial autolysins secondary to loss of membrane PL (25Foreman-Wykert A.K. Weiss J. Elsbach P. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1259-1264Google Scholar). To test whether differences in killing by PLA2 of the three S. aureus strains paralleled differences in PL degradation, bacterial lipids were prelabeled during growth with [14C]oleic acid, and extracellular accumulation of radioactive lipid degradation products during PLA2 treatment was measured. Dose-dependent accumulation of extracellular radioactive products during PLA2 treatment was greatest indltA − but similar inmprF − and wt strains, just as was observed in the killing experiments (compare Figs. 1 and2). Release of [14C]lipids in untreated samples (Fig. 2, dashed lines) was also greatest in the dltA − strain compared with the wt and mprF − strains, suggesting greater instability of cell envelope lipids in thedltA − S. aureus strain even in the absence of PLA2 treatment. Increased sensitivity to PLA2 was reversed by complementation of the mutant strains. To verify that release of 14C-labeled lipids during PLA2 treatment corresponds to bacterial PL breakdown radiolabeled bacterial lipids in whole suspensions and extracellular supernatants of PLA2-treated bacteria were extracted and analyzed by TLC (Fig. 3). No significant differences were observed between the profiles of labeled lipids extracted from the untreated wt and dltA −bacteria, whereas the labeled lipid profile ofmprF − bacteria revealed, as expected, the absence of lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (lysyl-PG) (Fig. 3). The predominant species in all strains was PG (Fig. 3). After treatment with 30 ng/ml PLA2, extracts of recovered supernatants contained mainly [14C]lyso-PG and to a lesser extent14C-labeled free fatty acids. At this dose, PLA2 caused almost complete loss of intact prelabeled PL, phosphatidic acid (PA), PG, and CL in the dltA −strain during a 60-min incubation. In contrast, under the same conditions only a limited portion of the intact prelabeled PL species was degraded in mprF − and wt bacteria (Fig. 3,whole cell suspensions). Therefore, PLA2-dependent PL degradation paralleled differences in sensitivity to killing by PLA2:dltA − ≫ mprF − ≥wt. Major [14C]lipids in supernatants upon PLA2treatment were lyso-PL, i.e. lyso-PG. PLA2-independent release of [14C]lipids was also greater in dltA − compared withmprF − and wt bacteria, but [14C]lipids in these supernatants were mainly intact lipids and free fatty acids (Fig. 3). Differences in PL degradation by PLA2 of intact wt, dltA −, andmprF − S. aureus could reflect either greater access of the enzyme to the membrane of more sensitive (i.e. dltA −≫mprF −, wt) bacteria or greater sensitivity of PL within the membrane of these more sensitive bacteria. To distinguish between these two possibilities we prepared bacterial protoplasts from wt, dltA −, andmprF − bacteria and tested their susceptibility to PLA2 hydrolytic activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Recovery of bacterial membranes in the form of protoplasts was ∼80%, as deduced from recovery of14C-labeled material. Contamination with intact bacteria, as assessed by plating protoplasts on BM agar without 30% raffinose, was ≤0.001%. The radiolabeled lipid pattern of protoplasts prior to PLA2 treatment resembled that of intact bacteria (compare Figs. 3 and 4, first lanes in each set). In contrast to intact bacteria, protoplasts of all three strains were equally sensitive to PLA2-dependent PL degradation (Fig. 4). This indicates that neither dltA-dependent modification of cell wall TA and LTA nor mprF-modification of cell membrane PG affects the sensitivity of membrane PL to PLA2, when the cell wall is removed. Comparison of the degradative activity of PLA2 toward intact bacteria and protoplasts (Fig. 5) shows that the resistance conferred by the cell wall in wt andmprF − bacteria is absent in thedltA − strain.Figure 5Comparison of PLA2 activity toward protoplasts versus intact S. aureusfrom wt , dltA− and mprF− strains.Effects of increasing concentrations of PLA2 toward [14C]oleate-labeled bacteria (107/ml) and protoplasts (107 equivalents/ml) where measured as described in the legends to Figs. 2 and 4. Incubations were for 60 min at 37 °C.

All data are expressed as percent of total 14C-labeled lipids.Open symbols represent PL degradation in intact bacteria andclosed symbols represent degradation of PL in protoplasts at different PLA2 concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previous studies indicated that dltA − S. aureusare more sensitive to a wide range of cationic antibacterial compounds (19Peschel A. Otto M. Jack R.W. Kalbacher H. Jung G. Gotz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8405-8410Google Scholar). To test if differences in sensitivity of wild type anddltA − S. aureus are dependent on the net positive charge of the antibacterial compound, we compared the bactericidal potency of the wild type PLA2 and two mutant PLA2, R92E and K38E/K116E (16Koduri R.S. Baker S.F. Snitko Y. Han S.K. Cho W. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32142-32153Google Scholar), against both S. aureus strains. As previously shown in otherdltA+ strains of S. aureus 3 (15Beers S.A. Buckland A.G. Koduri R.S. Cho W. Gelb M.H. Wilton D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1788-1793Google Scholar), the bactericidal potency of R92E and K38E/K116E PLA2 was much less (respectively, 10-fold and 100-fold reduced) than that of the wild type PLA2 (Fig. 6, left panel). Nevertheless, the dltA − mutant strain was ∼30 times more susceptible to killing by each of the PLA2. These results demonstrate that the absence ofdltA-dependent cell wall modifications rendersS. aureus more susceptible to killing, not only by wt PLA2, but also by mutant enzymes with reduced net positive surface charge. Hence, within this range of net charge of the PLA2 (+15 → +11; (Lys+Arg) − (Glu+Asp)), effects ofdltA-dependent modifications of the bacterial cell wall on bacterial sensitivity to PLA2 are independent of the net charge of the PLA2. Because the absence of d-alanylation of LTA and TA is believed to increase the net negative charge of the bacterial surface (18Wecke J. Madela K. Fischer W. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2953-2960Google Scholar, 19Peschel A. Otto M. Jack R.W. Kalbacher H. Jung G. Gotz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8405-8410Google Scholar), the increased sensitivity of thedltA − S. aureus to PLA2could simply reflect greater binding of PLA2 to thedltA − mutant strain. We therefore compared binding of 125I-PLA2 to the two strains. Initial PLA2 binding was measured in Hepes-buffered HBSS− supplemented with 2 mmMgCl2/2 mm EGTA (Mg2+·EGTA) to chelate ambient and cell envelope-associated Ca2+ and thereby preclude Ca2+-dependent envelope disruption by added PLA2 (Fig.7 A). Under these conditions, PLA2 binding to S. aureus declined with reduced net charge of the PLA2 (wt > R92E > K38E/K116E), but there was no significant difference in binding of wt or mutant PLA2 to the parent anddltA − strains. Similar results were obtained using 107 or 108 bacteria (not shown) except that PLA2 binding was higher when more bacteria were present. In contrast, when envelope-associated Ca2+ was retained by carrying out incubations in HBSS− without EGTA, PLA2 binding was much greater to thedltA − bacteria (Fig. 7 B). This increase in PLA2 binding when Ca2+ is present was seen with wt but not with a catalytically inactive mutant D49S PLA2 (Fig. 7 C) indicating that increased PLA2 binding is secondary to Ca2+-dependent envelope damage (which is greater in the dltA − strain; Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that Ca2+-independent initial binding depends on cationic properties of the PLA2 (wt ≥ R92E > K38E/K116E) but is not significantly different than the wild type and dltA − S. aureusstrains. The fact that initial PLA2 binding is not different from wt and dltA − S. aureus implies that the activity of bound PLA2 must be greater toward the dltA − bacteria. To test this hypothesis more directly, we took advantage of the findings described above, namely that in the presence of Mg2+·EGTA, similar amounts of enzyme bound to the two strains. After an initial 30-min incubation of [14C]oleate-prelabeled bacteria with PLA2 in the presence of Mg2+·EGTA, the bacteria were washed and resuspended in HBSS+(i.e. HBSS− supplemented with Ca2+and Mg2+). As expected, in the presence of Mg2+·EGTA, PLA2 was inactive, and there was little or no PLA2-dependent accumulation of extracellular radioactive degradation products from either strain (compare left bars of Fig. 8,A and B). However, after washing the bacteria to remove unbound PLA2 and subsequ"

https://openalex.org/W2138709225,"In the vascular system, nitric oxide is generated by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). NO has pleiotropic effects, most of which are believed to be atheroprotective. Therefore, it has been argued that patients suffering from cardiovascular disease could benefit from an increase in eNOS activity. However, increased NO production can cause oxidative damage, cell toxicity, and apoptosis and hence could be atherogenic rather than beneficial. To study the<i>in vivo</i> effects of increased eNOS activity, we created transgenic mice overexpressing human eNOS. Aortic blood pressure was ∼20 mm Hg lower in the transgenic mice compared with control mice because of lower systemic vascular resistance. The effects of eNOS overexpression on diet-induced atherosclerosis were studied in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. Elevation of eNOS activity decreased blood pressure (∼20 mm Hg) and plasma levels of cholesterol (∼17%), resulting in a reduction in atherosclerotic lesions by 40%. We conclude that an increase in eNOS activity is beneficial and provides protection against atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2313281246,"Genetic linkage data have shown that alterations of the BRCA1 gene are responsible for the majority of hereditary breast-ovarian cancers. However, BRCA1 germline mutations are found much less frequently than expected, especially as standard PCR-based mutation detection approaches focus on point and small gene alterations. In order to estimate the contribution of large gene rearrangements to the BRCA1 mutation spectrum, we have extensively analysed a series of 120 French breast-ovarian cancer cases. Thirty-eight were previously found carrier of a BRCA1 point mutation, 14 of a BRCA2 point mutation and one case has previously been reported as carrier of a large BRCA1 deletion. The remaining 67 cases were studied using the BRCA1 bar code approach on combed DNA which allows a panoramic view of the BRCA1 region. Three additional rearrangements were detected: a recurrent 23.8 kb deletion of exons 8–13, a 17.2 kb duplication of exons 3–8 and a 8.6 kb duplication of exons 18–20. Thus, in our series, BRCA1 large rearrangements accounted for 3.3% (4/120) of breast-ovarian cancer cases and 9.5% (4/42) of the BRCA1 gene mutation spectrum, suggesting that their screening is an important step that should be now systematically included in genetic testing surveys."

Gβ is the prototypical member of a family of proteins known as WD40 repeat proteins, which seem to function as adaptors and enzyme regulators (16Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 17Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Gβ is the only WD40 repeat protein whose three-dimensional structure is known, and it exhibits a toroidal bladed β-propeller structure, with each blade consisting of 4 anti-parallel β-strands (18Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Because the WD repeat motif is a structural element of the β-propeller, all of these proteins are thought to be β-propeller proteins with a variable number of blades. Furthermore, Gβ subunits are known to interact with Gγ subunits, proteins containing a Gγ-like domain (19Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1329-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), a pleckstrin homology domain (20Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a QXXER domain (found in adenylyl cyclases) (21Chen J. DeVivo M. Dingus J. Harry A. Li J. Sui J. Carty D.J. Blank J.L. Exton J.H. Stoffel R.H. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Logothetis D.E. Hildebrandt J.D. Iyengar R.

Lolley R.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15758-15772Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this work we propose that Gβγ also interacts with certain other WD40 repeat proteins. The dynein intermediate chain (DIC) is a WD40 repeat protein that is part of the cytoplasmic dynein multimeric protein complex, which consists of heavy, intermediate, light intermediate, and light chains (23King S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 60-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Dynein is a retrograde microtubule motor protein that is involved in cell division and in intracellular transport (24Karki S. Holzbaur E.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 25Burkhardt J.K. Echeverri C.J. Nilsson T. Vallee R.B. J.

The involvement of dynein in these processes is dictated by its different subunit composition (27Tai A.W. Chuang J.Z. Sung C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1499-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and by its interaction with another multimeric protein complex, dynactin (28Gill S.R. Schroer T.A. Szilak I. Steuer E.R.

This latter interaction occurs through the intermediate chain of the dynein complex and through p150-glued of the dynactin complex (28Gill S.R. Schroer T.A. Szilak I. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P.

The regulation of the interaction between dynein and dynactin is not fully understood; however, phosphorylation plays a part (33Niclas J. Allan V.J. Vale R.D. J.

The RACKs are also WD40 repeat proteins that were originally found by their ability to bind and to localize activated PKC (36Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S.

Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), have also been linked to G protein signaling. In this study, we used a yeast two-hybrid screen to find new Gβγ-interacting proteins and have isolated three proteins with the WD40 motif: RACK1, DIC, and an unknown protein, AAH20044. We confirmed the interaction of Gβγ with RACK1 and DIC through co-immunoprecipitation using an anti-Gβ1 antibody. Further investigation with a GST-RACK1 fusion protein and purified retinal G proteins revealed that RACK1 not only interacts with Gβ1γ1 alone but also binds with an apparent higher affinity to the heterotrimer Gαtβ1γ1. Gαtalone does not bind to GST-RACK1, suggesting that the interaction is mainly through Gβγ. This result was surprising because very few proteins other than receptors are known to interact with the whole heterotrimer, and most known effectors of Gβγ bind at its Gα-interacting face (57Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.S. Iyengar R. Miller R.J. Jan L.Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Hamm H.E.

Mutational analysis of RACK1 shows that G proteins may bind to multiple regions, including one of the βIIPKC-binding sites. Confirming this, Gβ1γ1 and Gαtβ1γ1 compete with the binding of activated βIIPKC to RACK1. Finally, Gβ1γ1, RACK1, and dynamin-1 do not form a trimeric complex, and dynamin-1 competes with the binding of Gβ1γ1 or Gαtβ1γ1 to RACK1. Recombinant dyamin-1 baculovirus was a gift from Dr. Sandra Schmid (Scripps Institute), and pET-His-DIC1A was a gift from Dr. Kevin Vaughan (University of Notre Dame). NIH3T3 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Transducin heterotrimer and individual α and βγ subunits were purified from bovine retina as described (59Mazzoni M.R. Malinski J.A. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14072-14081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Hybrid Hunter Two-hybrid System (Invitrogen) and Matchmaker LexA Two-hybrid System (Clontech, PT3040-1) were employed. The cloning of cDNAs into vectors was done by standard molecular techniques. cDNA corresponding to bovine β1 was cloned into pLexA usingEcoRI/XhoI sites, and the mouse brain library (Clontech) was cloned into pB42AD usingEcoRI/XhoI sites. By using theEcoRI/XhoI sites, bovine γ2 was cloned into pHybLexA/Zeo. The LexA BD (binding domain) of this plasmid was deleted beforehand by incorporating an EcoRI site upstream of the BD (Quick Change Mutation, Stratagene), referred to now as pHyb. The yeast strain EGY48/pSH18-34, which has a LEU2 site integrated in the genome and a lacZ plasmid, was employed. Transformation of the yeast was performed as outlined in the Matchmaker LexA Two-hybrid System User's Manual. Interaction of the proteins was determined by the ability of the yeast to grow on leucine minus (leu−) media and the ability to turn blue in the presence of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). The “positive” clones were sequenced, and a BLASTN search was performed to determine the identity of the proteins (74Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar). A 10-ml LB/amp(100 μg/ml) overnight culture of Escherichia coli BL21 cells containing pET-DIC1A was used to inoculate 500 ml of 2YT/amp. The culture was grown for 2.5 h (A 600 = 0.6) at 37 °C and then induced with isopropylthio-β-galactoside (IPTG) (0.5 mm) for 4 h. Cells were collected and frozen. Cells were thawed at room temperature and resuspended in 15 ml of washing buffer (20 mm imidazole; 0.5 m NaCl; 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9); protease inhibitor cocktail (PIC) (Amersham Biosciences); and 1% Triton X-100). Cells were sonicated on ice and then spun at 50,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and poured over a 2.5-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) column, pre-washed twice with 20 ml of washing buffer. The resin was washed four times with 20 ml of washing buffer and then eluted with 4 ml of elution buffer (1 m imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9)). The eluent was dialyzed into 40% glycerol/PBS with 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and 20 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. His-DIC-1A was approximately 60% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie, and calculations of concentrations used were based on that purity. A 10-ml LB/amp (100 μg/ml) overnight culture of BL21 cells containing pMAL-RACK1 was used to inoculate 500 ml of 2YT-amp (100 μg/ml). The culture was grown for 3 h (OD = 0.6) at 37 °C and then induced with IPTG (0.3 mm) for 3 h. Cells were collected and frozen. Cells were thawed at room temperature and resuspended in 15 ml of column buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5% Igepal, and protease inhibitor mixture). Cells were sonicated on ice and then spun at 35,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and poured over a 2.0-ml amylose resin (New England Biolabs) column, which had been pre-washed twice with 20 ml of column buffer. Resin was washed four times with 20 ml of column buffer, then eluted with 4 ml of elution buffer (column buffer and 10 mm maltose), and then dialyzed into 40% glycerol/column buffer. MBP-RACK1 was >85% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie. Expression and purification were carried out as described (60Warnock D.E. Terlecky L.J. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Dynamin-1 was stored in GTPase buffer (50 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.2), 10 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Dynamin-1 was >95% pure. Proteins were incubated at 4 °C with constant shaking for 30 min in a final volume of 200 μl using PBS for DIC/Gβγ and column buffer for MBP-RACK1/Gβγ. 1 μg of antibody (Santa Cruz) was added and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by the addition of 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads were washed three times with 500 μl of either PBS + 0.1% Igepal or column buffer + 0.1% Igepal, transferred to new tubes on the third wash, boiled in loading buffer, and resolved with SDS-PAGE (10–20%). NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). When stated, cells were serum-starved for 6 h. A 100-mm plate of cells at ∼85% confluency was lysed with 1.5 ml of RIPA buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Igepal, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture) or with Triton buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and PIC) at 4 °C with constant rotation for 30 min. Plates were scraped, and lysates were collected and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and incubated with 2 μg of anti-Gβ antibody overnight at 4 °C with constant shaking. The supernatants were incubated with 40 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C with constant shaking. The resin was washed three times with buffer, transferred to new tubes on the third wash, boiled in loading buffer, and resolved with SDS-PAGE (10Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K.

The Triton-insoluble pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of PBS with 1% SDS and sonicated to disrupt it. 10 μl was added to each lane. The gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a semi-dry apparatus. The membranes were blocked with a 3% milk, PBS, 1% Igepal buffer for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by an overnight incubation with the appropriate antibody (DIC-1A (1:1000) (gift from Prof. Kevin Vaughn, University of Notre Dame); RACK1 (1:5000) and dynamin-1 (1:2000) (Transduction Laboratories); Gβ (1:10,000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); Gαt (1:10,000) (gift from Prof. David Manning, University of Pennsylvania); βIIPKC (1:2000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)). The appropriate secondary antibody, conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, was incubated with the membrane for 1 h at room temperature. Detection was performed with chemiluminescence (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories or Pierce) by either x-ray film or a Fluor-S Imager (Bio-Rad). The mutations N1 (RACK1 amino acids 1–203), C1 (amino acids 203–317), N2 (amino acids 1–111), and C2 (amino acids 113–207) were created using standard molecular cloning techniques. For N1 and C2, we made use of an internal BamHI site of RACK1. The full-length RACK1 in pGEX-4T (Amersham Biosciences) was cut with BamHI (there is a BamHI site in the multiple cloning site of pGEX-4T), which gives a C-terminal fragment, that was ligated into cut pGEX-4T and a pGEX-4-N-terminal RACK1 fragment that was ligated back together. For the N2 and C2 mutants, an EcoRI site was incorporated into pGEX-4T-N1-RACK1 using Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis, which changed alanine 112 to a glutamine. This construct was cut withEcoRI, which gives a C2 fragment and pGEX-4-N2-RACK1 fragment because of an EcoRI site in the multiple cloning site. The N2 fragment was ligated back onto itself, which subsequently incorporates an extra nine amino acids at the C terminus from the other restriction sites in the multiple cloning site. The C2 fragment was ligated into EcoRI-digested pGEX-4T. The correct clones were confirmed by sequencing. 10 ml of BL21 cells containing pGEX4T-RACK1 or one of the mutants were grown overnight in LB/amp (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C with shaking. 500 ml of LB/amp was inoculated with the overnight sample, grown at 37 °C for 4 h (A 600 = 1–1.3), and then induced with 0.2 mm IPTG for 3 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and washed once with PBS. The cells were frozen overnight at −80 °C. The cells were thawed on ice and resuspended in 15 ml of PBS, 1% Triton, 1 unit of PIC, sonicated, rotated for 1 h at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. Glycerol (50%) was added to the Triton-soluble fraction (supernatant), and the lysates were stored at −20 °C. 0.5 ml of assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 12 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1% polyethylene glycol) with 1 unit of PIC was added to the glycerol lysate volume to yield a final concentration of 300 nm GST-RACK in the 200-μl assay (protein concentration was determined by isolating all the GST-RACK1 or mutant from a 1-ml aliquot of the glycerol lysates and using a Bradford protein assay). Glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), 50 μl of a 50% slurry, was added to the diluted lysate. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with rotation. The resin was washed three times with 500 μl of assay buffer. The appropriate amount of G protein was added, and assay buffer was added to a final volume of 200 μl. This was incubated for 30 min at room temperature, washed three times with assay buffer, transferred to new tubes on the third wash, boiled in loading buffer, and resolved with SDS-PAGE. Studies with βIIPKC included an extra incubation for 30 min at room temperature with activated βIIPKC before G protein was added (βIIPKC was activated by incorporating phospholipid vesicles, consisting of diacylglycerol (2 μg/ml) and phosphatidylserine (60 μg/ml), to the assay, then βIIPKC (50 nm), and then 1 mm CaCl2 as described (39Stebbins E.G. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29644-29650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar)). Studies with dynamin-1 included an extra incubation of 30 min at room temperature after the addition of G protein. Bovine Gβ1, fused to the C terminus of the LexA binding domain (BD), was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse brain library. The library consisted of open reading frames ∼1 kbp in length that were amplified from the poly(A) tail and fused to the C terminus of a yeast activation domain (AD). Prior to the screen, we determined that neither LexA-Gβ1 without the activating domain nor LexA-Gβ1 with the activation domain alone gave a positive result in the assay. Because Gβ1 is normally associated with a Gγ subunit, it was important to determine whether LexA-Gβ1 folds properly with endogenous yeast Gγ. When properly folded and exposed to trypsin, Gβ has only one exposed cleavage site (61Thomas T.C. Sladek T. Yi F. Smith T. Neer E.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8628-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A tryptic digest of yeast lysates expressing LexA-Gβ1 found that most of the LexA-Gβ1 is folded properly, suggesting assembly with yeast Gγ; however, there was also some misfolded LexA-Gβ1 protein (not shown). Therefore, we repeated the yeast two-hybrid assay with our positive clones in the presence of bovine Gγ2 expressed from another yeast plasmid, pHyb. Under these conditions, all of the LexA-Gβ1 had only one tryptic cleavage site, indicating proper assembly with bovine Gγ2. Those clones that were positive when Gγ2 was present were further characterized. To eliminate fu"

BRCA1 is a 220-kDa protein that contains a tandem of two BRCA1 C-Terminal (BRCT) domains. Among missense and nonsense BRCA1 mutations responsible for family breast cancer, some are located into the BRCT tandem of BRCA1 coding sequence. In an attempt to understand how BRCT is critical for BRCA1 function, we search for partners of this BRCT tandem of BRCA1. Using a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay with murine cells, we isolated only one major BRCA1-interacting protein, further identified as Acetyl Coenzyme A (CoA) Carboxylase α (ACCA). We showed that this interaction is conserved through murine and human species. We also delineated the minimum interacting region as being the whole tandem of BRCT domains. We demonstrated that BRCA1 interacts in vitro and in vivo with ACCA. This interaction is completely abolished by five distinct germline BRCA1 deleterious mutations affecting the BRCT tandem of BRCA1. Interestingly, ACCA originally known as a rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acids biosynthesis, has been recently shown to be over-expressed in breast cancers and considered as a potential target for anti-neoplastic therapy. Furthermore, our observation is making a bridge between the genetic factors involved in susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancers, and environmental factors such as nutrition considered as key elements in the etiology of those cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2125858585,"The androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that has an essential role in the normal growth, development, and maintenance of the prostate gland. The AR is part of a large family of steroid receptors that also includes the glucocorticoid, progesterone, and mineralocorticoid receptors. Steroid receptor family members share significant homology at their DNA and ligand-binding domains. However, these receptors exhibit a high degree of sequence variability at their NH2-terminal domain, which suggests the possibility of receptor-specific interactions with co-regulator proteins. Transcriptional co-regulators that interact with the AR may have a role in defining AR activity and may be involved in directing AR-specific responses. Here we have identified Ran-binding protein in the microtubule-organizing center (RanBPM) to be a novel AR-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid assay and have confirmed this interaction by glutathione S-transferase- and His-tagged pull-down assays. In addition, transient overexpression of RanBPM in prostate cancer cell lines resulted in enhanced AR activity in a ligand-dependent fashion. Glucocorticoid receptor activity was also enhanced when RanBPM was overexpressed, whereas estrogen receptor activity remained unchanged. These data demonstrate that RanBPM interacts with steroid receptors to selectively modify their activity.

The androgen receptor (AR) 1The abbreviations used are: AR, androgen receptor; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; LBD, ligand-binding domain; DBD, DNA-binding domain; ER, estrogen receptor; AF-1, activation function-1; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; Luc, luciferase; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; ARR, androgen response regions; PSA, prostate-specific antigen; PB, probasin; TK, thymidine kinase; Dex, dexamethasone; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; RanBPM, Ran-binding protein in the microtubule-organizing center; SPRY, repeats in splA and RyR. is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that belongs to a family of steroid receptors along with the glucocorticoid (GR), progesterone, and mineralocorticoid receptors. These steroid receptors share similar domain structures and mechanism of action. Steroid receptors including the AR have three functional domains: a COOH-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD), a central DNA-binding domain (DBD), and an NH2-terminal domain (1Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36863-36864Google Scholar). In the absence of androgens, the AR is localized to the cytoplasm in an inactive complex that includes heat shock proteins (HSP). Upon binding to its cognate ligand, the AR undergoes a conformational change that results in a more compact and stable form of the AR. The activated AR dissociates from HSPs and translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with consensus DNA sequences as a homodimer to influence transcription of downstream genes (2Kuil C.W. Berrevoets C.A. Mulder E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27569-27576Google Scholar). The estrogen receptor (ER) belongs to a different steroid receptor subfamily because it resides predominantly in the nucleus, even in its unliganded form, and does not require translocation across the nuclear membrane following activation (3Greene G.L. Press M.F. J. Steroid Biochem. 1986; 24: 1-7Google Scholar). There are two major transactivation regions in the AR. 1) The activation function-1 (AF-1) domain is found at the NH2 terminus. 2) AF-2 is located in the LBD. AF-2 is a weak transactivator that is dependent on the presence of androgens for its activation. AF-1, on the other hand, is capable of ligand-independent transactivation, and fragments of the AR that contain AF-1 show high levels of transcriptional activity when ectopically expressed in cell lines that are devoid of endogenous AR (4Snoek R. Bruchovsky N. Kasper S. Matusik R.J. Gleave M. Sato N. Mawji N.R. Rennie P.S. Prostate. 1998; 36: 256-263Google Scholar, 5Snoek R. Rennie P.S. Kasper S. Matusik R.J. Bruchovsky N. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 59: 243-250Google Scholar). Upon DNA binding, AR recruits components of the basal transcriptional machinery and influences either the up-regulation or down-regulation of gene expression. The exact mechanism of AR-specific gene expression is not fully understood. Each steroid receptor regulates unique sets of genes. However, in vitro assays have shown that these receptors recognize similar DNA sequences known as steroid response elements. These elements are comprised of a palindrome that contains two half-sites based on the 5′-TGTTCT-3′ motif that are separated by a three nucleotide spacer (6Tsai S.Y. Carlstedt-Duke J. Weigel N.L. Dahlman K. Gustafsson J.A. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 1988; 55: 361-369Google Scholar). Detailed analysis has demonstrated that both GR and AR bind with highest affinity to a steroid response element that has an imperfect palindrome, 5′-GGTACAnnnTGTTCT-3′ (7Nelson C.C. Hendy S.C. Shukin R.J. Cheng H. Bruchovsky N. Koop B.F. Rennie P.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2090-2107Google Scholar). The quandary is that although activated steroid receptors bind to highly homologous response elements on DNA, they still demonstrate an ability to regulate the expression of unique gene sets. There are several mechanisms by which receptors can specifically regulate gene expression. One mechanism suggests that co-regulatory proteins interact with steroid receptors to direct their activity. The search for AR-specific co-regulatory molecules has led to the identification of several AR-interacting proteins. Early studies identified ARA70/ELE1 as a ligand-dependent co-activator of AR (8Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5517-5521Google Scholar). Subsequently, CREB-binding protein/p300, which has histone acetyltransferase activity, was also shown to interact with AR and enhance receptor activity in prostate cells (9Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Google Scholar). More recent AR-interacting proteins that have been identified include β-catenin (10Truica C.I. Byers S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4709-4713Google Scholar), caveolin (11Lu M.L. Schneider M.C. Zheng Y. Zhang X. Richie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13442-13451Google Scholar), BAG-1L (12Froesch B.A. Takayama S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11660-11666Google Scholar), SMAD3 (13Hayes S.A. Zarnegar M. Sharma M. Yang F. Peehl D.M. ten Dijke P. Sun Z. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2112-2118Google Scholar), cyclin D1 (14Petre C.E. Wetherill Y.B. Danielsen M. Knudsen K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2207-2215Google Scholar), and several others. These proteins have been shown to either positively (caveolin and BAG-1L) or negatively (SMAD3 and cyclin D1) affect AR transactivation. Identification of proteins that specifically interact with the AR has been a challenge because the AR and other steroid receptors share a high degree of sequence homology at their DBD and LBD. The DBD of human AR shares as much as 80% homology with that of progesterone receptor and over 70% with GR (15Chang C.S. Kokontis J. Liao S.T. Science. 1988; 240: 324-326Google Scholar). The LBD of the steroid receptors are highly homologous as well with up to 55% similarity at the amino acid level. Therefore, many co-regulatory proteins that interact with the AR at the LBD and DBD are promiscuous in their ability to interact with and influence activity of other steroid receptors. A report by Alenet al. (16Alen P. Claessens F. Schoenmakers E. Swinnen J.V. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Peeters B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 117-128Google Scholar) has demonstrated that ARA70 is not specific to the AR and that this protein interacts with the ER and GR as well. Likewise, the steroid receptor co-activator-1/NCoA1, which is the founding member of the p160 family of transcriptional co-activators, interacts indiscriminately with the LBD of steroid receptors to enhance activity (17Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Google Scholar). Other members of the p160 family such as TIF-2/GRIP-1 enhance AR, GR and ER activity alike (18Ding X.F. Anderson C.M. Ma H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Google Scholar). Nevertheless, steroid receptor family members show the greatest degree of sequence variability at the NH2-terminal domain (<15%). Little is known regarding the role of the NH2-terminal domain in AR transactivation. Therefore, we used an NH2-terminal fragment of the AR, which is devoid of transcriptional activity (AR1–232), as bait in a yeast two-hybrid assay, and RanBPM was identified as an AR-interacting protein. Although RanBPM was initially described as a 55-kDa protein (BPM55), a subsequent report has shown it to be a 90-kDa protein (BPM90) (19Nakamura M. Masuda H. Horii J. Kuma K. Yokoyama N. Ohba T. Nishitani H. Miyata T. Tanaka M. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1041-1052Google Scholar, 20Nishitani H. Hirose E. Uchimura Y. Nakamura M. Umeda M. Nishii K. Mori N. Nishimoto T. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 25-33Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the larger form of RanBPM, BPM90, is able to bind to multiple domains of the AR and that this interaction occurs in vivo. Furthermore, overexpression of RanBPM in prostate cancer cell lines shows that RanBPM can enhance AR transactivation. This property of RanBPM does not appear to be exclusive to the AR because BPM90 also enhances GR activity, although neither ER-α nor ER-β activity is affected. These experiments clearly demonstrate that RanBPM is capable of interacting with and modifying the activity of selective steroid receptors. A 696-bp fragment coding for the first 232 amino acids of the human AR (AR1–232) was cloned into the BamHI site of the pGBT9 vector for expression as a fusion protein with the GAL4 DBD (Clontech). A cDNA library made from normal human prostate tissue that was fused to the transactivation domain of GAL4 in the pACT2 expression vector was used for screening (Clontech). Expression plasmids were transformed into the Y190 yeast strain, and transformants were selected on SD minimal medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. Clones that grew on minimal medium agar plates were subjected to β-galactosidase assays by colony filter-lift according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clones that tested positive for β-galactosidase were sequenced using Big Dye Terminator cycle sequencing reactions (Applied Biosystems) and were then compared with known sequences available in GenBankTM. The full-length RanBPM expression vector, pcDEBΔ-BPM90, and empty vector, pcDEBΔ, were provided by Dr. H. Nishitani (Kyushu University) (20Nishitani H. Hirose E. Uchimura Y. Nakamura M. Umeda M. Nishii K. Mori N. Nishimoto T. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 25-33Google Scholar). The longest RanBPM library clone that was isolated in the yeast two-hybrid assay contained a 2152-bp fragment that coded for amino acids 148–729 of BPM90 and the 3′-untranslated region. This fragment of BPM90, herein referred to as BPML, was cloned into the pRC/cytomegalovirus (CMV) mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) in which transcription is driven by the CMV promoter. BPML was cloned in-frame with an upstream ATG for translation initiation and a Kozak sequence to enhance translation efficiency. The NH2-terminal region of the human AR spanning the NH2-terminal domain and DBD (hAR1–646) was generated by PCR and cloned into the multiple cloning site of pRC/CMV for expression in mammalian cells. The full-length rat AR cDNA was expressed from the pRC/CMV mammalian expression plasmid, pCMV/AR6 (21Rennie P.S. Bruchovsky N. Leco K.J. Sheppard P.C. McQueen S.A. Cheng H. Snoek R. Hamel A. Bock M.E. MacDonald B.S. Nickel B.E. Chang C. Liao S. Cattini P.A. Matusik R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 23-36Google Scholar). The rat glucocorticoid receptor was expressed from the pGR mammalian expression vector as described elsewhere (22Miesfeld R. Rusconi S. Godowski P.J. Maler B.A. Okret S. Wikstrom A.C. Gustafsson J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 389-399Google Scholar). The human ER-α expression vector (pSVMT:wER) has also been described previously (23Smith C.L. Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6120-6124Google Scholar). The pcDNA4/HisMax-hERβ1 vector (a gift from Dr. L. Murphy, University of Manitoba) was used for the expression of human ER-β in mammalian cells. Multiple tissue Northern blots (Clontech) were probed with [32P]dCTP-labeled RanBPM cDNA. Poly(A) RNA was prepared from the LNCaP, PC3, MCF7, and HeLa cell lines using an Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen). For the Northern blot, 5 μg of poly(A) RNA were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel with 30% formaldehyde and transferred to a Biodyne B nylon membrane (Pall Corporation) by capillary action in 10 mm NaOH. The membrane was hybridized with a [32P]dCTP-labeled 1100-bp cDNA fragment coding for RanBPM. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used to normalize the loading of poly(A) RNA. Various NH2-terminal and DBD fragments of the human AR (AR1–232, AR1–559, and AR559–646) and a COOH-terminal fragment of rat AR (ARDBD/LBD) were cloned into the pGEX vector (AmershamBiosciences) for expression as GST fusion proteins. GST fusion proteins were expressed in the BL21 Escherichia coli strain and purified as described previously (5Snoek R. Rennie P.S. Kasper S. Matusik R.J. Bruchovsky N. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 59: 243-250Google Scholar). Radiolabeled RanBPM protein was prepared from the pRC/CMV-BPML vector using the Quick Coupled T7 TnT in vitrotranscription/translation kit (Promega Corporation) in the presence of [35S]Met. Equimolar amounts of GST-AR fusion protein coupled to glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with radiolabeled RanBPM at 4 °C for 2 h in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40). Beads were washed four times with binding buffer, and bound proteins were eluted into protein sample buffer (2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) for analysis by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. A fragment spanning the NH2-terminal domain and DNA-binding domain of the AR (AR1–646) was cloned into the pTrcHisC vector (Invitrogen) for expression with an NH2-terminal His tag, which consists of six histidine residues in tandem. His-tagged proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified using the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). [35S]Met-RanBPM fragments were incubated with His-AR1–646 at 4 °C for 4 h in binding buffer (see above). His-AR1–646 was immunoprecipitated using an anti-His antibody (Qiagen) as described below. PC3, HeLa, and MCF7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The LNCaP prostate carcinoma cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% FBS. For transient transfection, 3 × 105 cells were seeded in six-well plates and were transfected the following day using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (24Sato N. Sadar M.D. Bruchovsky N. Saatcioglu F. Rennie P.S. Sato S. Lange P.H. Gleave M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17485-17494Google Scholar). Transfection occurred for 16 h at 37 °C. Following transfection, cells were re-fed with fresh medium containing 5% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped FBS ± 1 nm R1881, 10 nm dexamethasone (Dex), 10 nm E2 or vehicle alone and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 24 h. After induction with hormone, cells were harvested and lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega Corporation) for luciferase assay and for Western blot analysis. LNCaP cells were grown to 80% confluency in RPMI 1640 medium + 5% FBS. Cells were then cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped FBS for 16 h at 37 °C. The following day, cells were induced in the presence or absence of 10 nmR1881 for 4 h at 37 °C before scraping and lysis in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). Whole cell extracts (1 mg of protein) were incubated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-AR antibody or with normal rabbit IgG as a negative control (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Immunocomplexes were pulled down using protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and washed four times with radioimmune precipitation buffer. After the final wash, proteins were solubilized in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot. Western blots were carried out as described previously (21Rennie P.S. Bruchovsky N. Leco K.J. Sheppard P.C. McQueen S.A. Cheng H. Snoek R. Hamel A. Bock M.E. MacDonald B.S. Nickel B.E. Chang C. Liao S. Cattini P.A. Matusik R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 23-36Google Scholar). Protein samples were resolved on a polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in TBS (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl) with 5% skim milk. Blots were incubated with appropriate primary antibody, diluted to 2 μg/ml in TBS + 5% milk for 4 h at room temperature, washed three times in TBS + 0.5% Tween 20, and then incubated for 45 min in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Blots were developed using the ECL chemiluminescence kit (AmershamBiosciences). AR and GR constructs were co-transfected with the pARR3-tk-Luc reporter construct in which the promoter has three androgen response regions (ARRs) in tandem (5Snoek R. Rennie P.S. Kasper S. Matusik R.J. Bruchovsky N. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 59: 243-250Google Scholar). In addition, the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and probasin (PB) luciferase reporter constructs were used to determine transcriptional activity of the AR (4Snoek R. Bruchovsky N. Kasper S. Matusik R.J. Gleave M. Sato N. Mawji N.R. Rennie P.S. Prostate. 1998; 36: 256-263Google Scholar, 24Sato N. Sadar M.D. Bruchovsky N. Saatcioglu F. Rennie P.S. Sato S. Lange P.H. Gleave M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17485-17494Google Scholar). ER expression vectors were co-transfected with the pERE-Luc reporter plasmid as described previously. The pERE-Luc plasmid contains a single vitellogenin estrogen response element upstream of the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter. 2J. L. Ralph, M. C. Orgebin-Crist, J.-J. Lareyre, and C. C. Nelson, manuscript in preparation. Transfected cells were incubated in the presence or absence of hormone at 37 °C for 24 h prior to analysis. Transfection efficiency was normalized using the Renilla luciferase expression vector, pRL-TK (Promega Corp.). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were assayed with the Dual Luciferase assay kit (Promega Corp.). 20 μl of cell lysate were analyzed for luciferase activity using MicroLumiatPlusluminometer (EG&G Berthold). A fragment coding for the first 232 amino acids of the AR (AR1–232) was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid assay to screen a human prostate library for interacting proteins. Over 3 × 105 transformants were screened on selective media, and positive clones were identified by β-galactosidase assay. Sequence analysis of three independent positive clones revealed a gene that was highly homologous to a known human protein, RanBPM (GenBankTM accession number AB055311) (19Nakamura M. Masuda H. Horii J. Kuma K. Yokoyama N. Ohba T. Nishitani H. Miyata T. Tanaka M. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1041-1052Google Scholar). Both 55- and 90-kDa forms of RanBPM have been reported in the literature and are referred to as BPM55 and BPM90, respectively (19Nakamura M. Masuda H. Horii J. Kuma K. Yokoyama N. Ohba T. Nishitani H. Miyata T. Tanaka M. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1041-1052Google Scholar, 20Nishitani H. Hirose E. Uchimura Y. Nakamura M. Umeda M. Nishii K. Mori N. Nishimoto T. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 25-33Google Scholar). Sequences isolated from the three library clones isolated by the yeast two-hybrid assay had sequences upstream of the published BPM55 translation start codon (Fig. 1). The longest sequence of the three library clones (ARBP1) was 2346 bp in length and coded for a protein from amino acid 148 of BPM90 to the termination codon. This fragment is referred to as BPML. To confirm the interaction between RanBPM and AR that was identified by yeast two-hybrid screening, various AR constructs were expressed as GST fusion proteins and coupled to glutathione-agarose beads for use in GST pull-down assays. The 2346-bp fragment from ARBP1 (BPML) was cloned into pRC/CMV to allow for in vitro transcription/translation from the T7 promoter. [35S]Methionine-labeled BPML protein was allowed to interact with the GST-AR fusion proteins and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. As seen in Fig. 2A, RanBPM interacts with the 232-amino acid fragment that was originally used as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screen (AR1–232) (Fig. 2A,lanes 3 and 4). Equimolar amounts of AR-GST fusion proteins were used to determine relative binding between RanBPM and various domains of AR, and the results show that RanBPM interacts most strongly with the DBD (AR559–646) (Fig. 2A, lane 2). In addition, RanBPM interacts with the AR fragment that spans the DBD and LBD (ARDBD/LBD) (Fig. 2, lane 5). However, presence of the LBD does not enhance interaction, which suggests that the LBD does not have additional domains for RanBPM binding. To assess the relevance of this interaction in vivo, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay using LNCaP cell lysates. The LNCaP prostate carcinoma cell line expresses high levels of functional AR and displays androgen-dependent gene expression activity. Cells were treated for 4 h with 10 nm R1881 or with vehicle alone prior to preparation of protein lysates. Whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with normal rabbit IgG as a negative control (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and5) or with an antibody that recognizes the COOH terminus of the AR (lanes 4 and 6) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Protein complexes were pulled down with protein A/G coupled to agarose beads. Proteins of the AR complex were resolved by SDS-PAGE prior to Western blotting with an anti-BPM90 antibody (provided by Dr. H. Nishitani). A 90-kDa protein that is seen in the input lanes (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2) is BPM90. The results in Fig. 2B show that BPM90 interacts with AR specifically in the presence of hormone (lanes 3–6). We confirmed that AR was pulled-down in this assay by blotting the same membrane with an antibody that recognizes the NH2 terminus of the AR (Affinity BioReagents) (Fig. 2B). RanBPM encodes a putative SPRY domain at the NH2 terminus (Fig. 1) (19Nakamura M. Masuda H. Horii J. Kuma K. Yokoyama N. Ohba T. Nishitani H. Miyata T. Tanaka M. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1041-1052Google Scholar). This domain has been implicated in protein-protein interactions. To determine the importance of the SPRY domain, His-tag pull-down assays were carried out to map the interacting domains between RanBPM and the AR. Radiolabeled COOH-terminal truncations of RanBPM were generated by restriction digest of the pRC/CMV-BPML vector with EcoRI orNdeI followed by in vitrotranscription/translation in the presence of [35S]methionine. The truncated RanBPM proteins (BPM148–408 and BPM148–251) were incubated with purified recombinant His-tagged AR1–646, which includes the NH2-terminal domain and DBD. An antibody that recognizes the His-tag (Qiagen) was used to immunoprecipitate AR and its interacting proteins. After sufficient washing, samples were eluted into protein sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. Fig. 2C, Input lanes, show that radiolabeled proteins have molecular masses of 64, 28, and 11 kDa (BPML, BPM147–408, and BPM147–251, respectively). Both BPML and the truncated peptide generated by EcoRI digest, BPM147–408, interacted with the AR (Fig. 2C,top and middle panels). However, BPM147–251 in which the SPRY domain is disrupted was no longer able to interact with AR (Fig. 2C, bottom panel). This finding agrees with yeast two-hybrid results in which β-galactosidase activity and, therefore, interaction with AR1–232 are lost when an NH2-terminal truncation of RanBPM, which does not have a complete SPRY domain, is used as bait (data not shown). To determine expression levels of RanBPM, a [32P]cDNA probe was generated from the ARBP1 yeast two-hybrid library clone and hybridized to a multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech). This Northern blot allows for analysis of RanBPM expression in several different tissue types. Fig. 3A shows that RanBPM is expressed as a 2.9-kb transcript in multiple different tissue types. High levels of RanBPM message are seen in the prostate and ovaries, and highest levels of expression are observed in the testes (lanes 3, 5, and 4, respectively). RanBPM expression levels were determined for various cancer cell lines by both Northern and Western blots (Fig. 3, B andC). Cell lines that were used included the ovarian carcinoma HeLa cell line from which BPM90 was first identified, two prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and LNCaP, and the MCF7 breast cancer cell line. Both Northern and Western blots show that RanBPM is highly expressed in all of the cell lines. In Fig. 3C, the 90-kDa protein seen in lanes 1–4 is BPM90. Although BPM90 is expressed in all of the cell lines tested, the highest levels were observed in HeLa cells (lane 4). PC3 and MCF7 cells expressed lower levels of BPM90 as compared with the LNCaP cell line (comparelanes 1 and 3 with lane 2). The membrane was probed with an antibody for β-actin (Sigma) to demonstrate that loading efficiency was consistent in all lanes (Fig. 3C). Our results have demonstrated that RanBPM interacts with the androgen receptor at the NH2 terminus and at the DNA-binding domain (Fig. 2A). To determine whether this interaction has a biological impact on AR activity, transcriptional assays were carried out using the PC3 cell line. PC3 cells represent a relatively undifferentiated stage of prostate cancer. These cells express very little to no androgen receptor and do not demonstrate androgen-regulated growth. Cells were transiently transfected with an AR expression vector (pCMV/AR6), the pARR3-tk-Luc reporter plasmid, and increasing amounts of RanBPM (pcDEBΔ-BPM90) and then were induced in the presence or absence of 1 nm R1881 for 24 h prior to harvesting for luciferase assays (Fig. 4A). In the absence of hormone, negligible AR-mediated transcriptional activity was observed from the pARR3-tk-Luc reporter plasmid. An addition of hormone resulted in an ∼9-fold induction of AR activity. In the presence of hormone, the overexpression of BPM90 resulted in an AR activity that was three times greater than in the absence of RanBPM. AR activity in the absence of hormone was unchanged by the addition of RanBPM, even with a 20-fold excess of BPM90 (Fig. 4B). Western blot analysis of cell lysates was carried out to ensure equivalent levels of AR expression in all samples (data not shown). Additional transactivation assays were carried out using an NH2-terminal truncated form of RanBPM (BPML) in which expression is under the control of a CMV promoter (Fig. 4A). The presence of BPMLincreases basal AR activity by 4-fold when androgens are present. BPML did not affect the activity of AR in the absence of ligand when the AR was transcriptionally inactive. Because RanBPM was identified by its interaction with the NH2 terminus of the AR, similar transactivation experiments were carried out with a form of the AR that is deleted for the LBD, pRC/CMV-AR1–646. This region of the AR has the AF-1 site and is capable of ligand-independent transcriptional activity. PC3 cells were transiently transfected with the truncated AR construct and treated with or without 1 nm R1881. AR1–646 is capable of high levels of transcriptional activity both in the presence and absence of ligand (Fig. 4C). Increasing amounts of BPM90 resulted in increased AR1–646 activity up to 2.5-times greater than basal levels. This increase in AR activity was independent of added hormone. The ARR3 promoter of the reporter plasmid is a synthetic highly active promoter that has three ARRs in tandem. The PB and PSA promoters, however, may be more physiologically relevant.

Pss1 and Pss2 are structurally similar (∼32% amino acid identity) but differ in their substrate specificities, with Pss1 using phosphatidylcholine for the serine exchange reaction and Pss2 using phosphatidylethanolamine. Whether Pss1 and Pss2 are both required for mammalian growth and development is not known, and no data exist on the relative contributions of the two enzymes to serine exchange activities in different tissues. To address those issues and also to define the cell type-specific expression of Pss2, we generated Pss2-deficient mice in which a β-galactosidase marker is expressed from Pss2 regulatory sequences. Histologic studies of Pss2-deficient mice revealed very high levels of β-galactosidase expression in Sertoli cells of the testis and high levels of expression in brown fat, neurons, and myometrium. The ability of testis extracts fromPss2-deficient mice to catalyze serine exchange was reduced by more than 95%; reductions of ∼90% were noted in the brain and liver. However, we found no perturbations in the phospholipid content of any of these tissues. As judged by Northern blots, the expression ofPss1 was not up-regulated in Pss2-deficient cells and tissues. Testis weight was reduced inPss2-deficient mice, and some of the male mice were infertile. We conclude that Pss2 is responsible for the majority of serine exchange activity in in vitro assays, but a deficiency in this enzyme does not cause perturbations in phospholipid content or severe developmental abnormalities.

Phosphatidylserine is an aminophospholipid that constitutes 5–10% of mammalian membrane phospholipids (1Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins, and Membranes. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 391-393Google Scholar). In mammals, phosphatidylserine is synthesized by a pair of enzymes, phosphatidylserine synthase 1 (Pss1) 1The abbreviations used are: Pss1, phosphatidylserine synthase 1; Pss2, phosphatidylserine synthase 2; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; β-gal, β-galactosidase; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-dgalactopyranoside 2According to the International Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice, the official gene symbols for phosphatidylserine synthase 1 and phosphatidylserine synthase 2 arePtdss1 and Ptdss2, respectively. In this paper, we have used the names Pss1 and Pss2 because they are less cumbersome. and phosphatidylserine synthase 2 (Pss2) (2Kuge O. Nishijima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 151-156Google Scholar, 3Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Google Scholar, 4Kuge O. Saito K. Nishijima M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 89-97Google Scholar, 6Stone S.J. Cui Z. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7293-7302Google Scholar). The two enzymes are structurally related, with 32% amino acid identity, and both are predicted to contain several transmembrane domains (2Kuge O. Nishijima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 151-156Google Scholar, 3Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Google Scholar, 6Stone S.J. Cui Z. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7293-7302Google Scholar, 7Stone S.J. Vance J.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 57-64Google Scholar). Pss1 and Pss2 generate phosphatidylserine by catalyzing the exchange of serine for the head group of another phospholipid, but the two enzymes differ in their substrate specificities. Pss1 uses phosphatidylcholine for the exchange reaction (8Voelker D.R. Frazier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1002-1008Google Scholar, 9Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Google Scholar), whereas Pss2 uses phosphatidylethanolamine (2Kuge O. Nishijima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 151-156Google Scholar, 3Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Google Scholar, 4Kuge O. Saito K. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19133-19139Google Scholar, 6Stone S.J. Cui Z. Vance J.E. J. Biol.

In vitro, Pss1 is capable of catalyzing the exchange of ethanolamine and choline in addition to serine; Pss2 is capable of catalyzing the exchange of ethanolamine but not choline. However, these ethanolamine and choline exchange reactions are not thought to be physiologically important for the in vivo synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (11Sundler R. Akesson B. Nilsson A. FEBS Lett. 1974; 43: 303-307Google Scholar) or phosphatidylcholine (12Sundler R. Arvidson G. Akesson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 280: 559-568Google Scholar). The physiologic “rationale” for the existence of two different phosphatidylserine synthases is unclear. No one knows whether mammalian growth and development require both enzymes, since no one has yet developed mice lacking either of the two genes. However, two groups have produced Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines lackingPss1 by selecting for cells that required ethanolamine or phosphatidylserine for growth (8Voelker D.R. Frazier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1002-1008Google Scholar, 9Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Google Scholar). Extracts from the mutant CHO cells manifested a ∼50% decrease in serine exchange activity, suggesting that Pss2 accounts for a significant portion of the serine exchange activity in that cell type. Pss1 deficiency did not have a significant impact on cell growth when the cells were grown in the presence of ethanolamine or phospholipids, but the cells grew slowly, and their phospholipid content was perturbed when the cells were grown in the absence of ethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, or phosphatidylethanolamine (7Stone S.J. Vance J.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 57-64Google Scholar, 8Voelker D.R. Frazier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1002-1008Google Scholar, 9Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Google Scholar, 13Kuge O. Saito K. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23844-23849Google Scholar). Thus far, no one has developed cell lines that lack Pss2expression, although a mutant CHO cell line that expressed reduced levels of Pss2 activity was generated (10Saito K. Nishijima M. Kuge O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17199-17205Google Scholar). It is difficult to predict whether or not Pss2-deficient cells would be viable and healthy. On the one hand, one could argue that the existence ofPss1 would make Pss2 expression superfluous. On the other hand, a large fraction of phosphatidylserine synthesis in CHO cells is due to Pss2, and it certainly would not be unreasonable to surmise that Pss2 would be crucial for cellular phospholipid homeostasis. It is also difficult to make a prioripredictions about whether mice lacking Pss2 would be viable and, if so, whether there would be any pathology in tissues expressing high levels of the enzyme. Pss2 is expressed in a variety of different organs as judged by Northern blot analysis (6Stone S.J. Cui Z. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7293-7302Google Scholar, 7Stone S.J. Vance J.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 57-64Google Scholar), but no information exists on which cell types express high levels of the gene. Finally, there are no biochemical data on the contribution of Pss2 to total serine exchange activity in different mammalian tissues. The purpose of this study was to define the physiologic importance ofPss2 in mammals. To address this issue, we producedPss2-deficient mice in which the expression of a marker gene, β-galactosidase (β-gal), was driven by the regulatory elements of the Pss2 gene. The characterization of thePss2-deficient mice allowed us to fill in a number of gaps in our knowledge of Pss2. First, we demonstrated that mice lacking Pss2 survive development and are viable, although males have small testes and occasionally testicular atrophy. We were able to define the impact of Pss2 deficiency on serine exchange activities in different tissues and were able to demonstrate, by β-gal staining, which cell types express high levels ofPss2. Finally, we investigated whether or notPss2 deficiency perturbed the phospholipid composition of tissues and cells. A mouse embryonic stem cell line (KST314, strain 129P2/OlaHsd) containing an insertional mutation in Pss2 was identified in a gene-trapping screen (14Mitchell K.J. Pinson K.I. Kelly O.G. Brennan J. Zupicich J. Scherz P. Leighton P.A. Goodrich L.V. Lu X. Avery B.J. Tate P. Dill K. Pangilinan E. Wakenight P. Tessier-Lavigne M. Skarnes W.C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 241-249Google Scholar). The gene-trapping vector, pGTITMpfs, was designed to interrupt genes that encode proteins with an N-terminal signal sequence and to create an in-frame fusion with the β-geo reporter gene (14Mitchell K.J. Pinson K.I. Kelly O.G. Brennan J. Zupicich J. Scherz P. Leighton P.A. Goodrich L.V. Lu X. Avery B.J. Tate P. Dill K. Pangilinan E. Wakenight P. Tessier-Lavigne M. Skarnes W.C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 241-249Google Scholar). The embryonic stem cell line was used to generate male chimeric mice, which were bred with C57BL/6 mice to establish heterozygous (Pss2+/−) and homozygous (Pss2−/−) knockout mice. Mice were genotyped by quantifying neomycin phosphotransferase II (neo) gene dosage in genomic DNA with a quantitative PCR assay (described on the BayGenomics Web site at baygenomics.ucsf.edu/protocols). Genotyping was also performed by quantifying neo gene dosage with Southern blots; for these studies, BamHI-digested genomic DNA was hybridized with pGTITMpfs that had been linearized with HindIII. All mice described here had a mixed genetic background (∼50% C57BL/6 and ∼50% 129/OlaHsd). The mice were weaned at 21 days of age, housed in a barrier facility with 12-h light/dark cycle, and fed a chow diet containing 4.5% fat (Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO). Pss2−/−, Pss2+/−, and wild-type (Pss2+/+) embryonic fibroblasts were prepared from 13.5-day mouse embryos (15Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B. Ashby M. Shannon K. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8383-8390Google Scholar) and immortalized by serial passaging (15Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B. Ashby M. Shannon K. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8383-8390Google Scholar). Sites of Pss2 andPss1 expression were determined with mouse multiple-tissue poly(A)+ RNA blots (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The protein-coding sequence of the Pss1 cDNA was amplified from a mouse liver cDNA library (CLONTECH) with oligonucleotides 5′-ATGGCGTCCTGCGTGGGGAGCAGG-3′ and 5′-CAGCCGATGAAGAGGATTCTACACC-3′ and cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen). A 1.1-kb Pss1 cDNA probe was produced by removing the insert with EcoRI. A 1.4-kbPss2 cDNA was cloned into pCRII (7Stone S.J. Vance J.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 57-64Google Scholar); the insert was released by EcoRI digestion. Probes were labeled with32P by random hexamer priming. The Northern blots were exposed to x-ray film for 12 h at −80 °C. Northern blots were also produced with total RNA isolated from brain, liver, and testis from Pss2+/+ and Pss2−/− mice. RNA was isolated with the Tri Reagent RNA isolation kit (T9424; Sigma). Total RNA (20 μg) was separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and then transferred to a Nytran SuPerCharge membrane (S00486; Schleicher & Schuell) and hybridized with the 1.4-kbPss2 cDNA probe. The same blots were also probed with the 1.1-kb Pss1 cDNA probe and a neo probe (produced by cleaving pKSloxPNT with HindIII) (16Hanks M. Wurst W. Anson-Cartwright L. Auerbach A.B. Joyner A.L. Science. 1995; 269: 679-682Google Scholar). Tissue samples (∼100 mg) were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mmMgCl2, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 100 mmNaCl. The tissue homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 600 ×g, and the supernatant fluid was used for measurement of serine exchange activity. The reaction mixture (200 μl) contained 160 μl of tissue sample with 300 μg of protein, 20 μl of a buffer (100 mm CaCl2, 40 mm hydroxylamine, and 250 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and 20 μl of the radiolabel (a [14C]serine solution, an [14C]ethanolamine solution, or a [14C]choline solution). The [14C]serine solution contained 100 μl of [14C]serine (CFB72; Amersham Biosciences; 151 μCi/μmol; 50 μCi in a volume of 1.0 ml) and 900 μl of 0.4 mm unlabeled serine (S-8407; Sigma). The [14C]ethanolamine solution contained 10 μl of [14C]ethanolamine (CFA329; Amersham; 55 μCi/μmol; 50 μCi in a volume of 250 μl) and 990 μl of 0.2 mmunlabeled ethanolamine (E-9508; Sigma). The [14C]choline solution contained 10 μl of [14C]choline (CFA424;Amersham Biosciences; 55 μCi/μmol; 50 μCi in a volume of 250 μl) and 990 μl of 0.2 mm unlabeled choline (C-1879; Sigma). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min at 37 °C and was terminated by adding 5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). A total of 1.5 ml of water was then added to each tube, and the tubes were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min. The upper phase was aspirated and discarded. The lower phase was washed three times with 2.0 ml of methanol/water (1:1). The phospholipid products were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (17Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar), and radioactivity was measured. Immortalized fibroblasts from Pss2+/+ andPss2−/− embryos were grown to 80–90% confluence in 60-mm dishes in the presence of 15% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then incubated for up to 6 h with 3 μCi/ml [3-3H]serine. Lipids were extracted by treatment of the cells with isopropyl alcohol/hexane (2:3, v/v) and separated by thin layer chromatography in the solvent system chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/formic acid/water (70:30:12:4:2, v/v/v/v/v). Phospholipids were visualized by exposure to iodine vapor and phosphatidylserine identified by comparison to authentic phosphatidylserine. Radioactivity in phosphatidylserine was determined by scintillation counting. Cryostat sections (10 μm thick) of frozen tissues from mice were collected on Superfrost Plus microscope slides (Fisher). The sections were dried, fixed (2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.2% glutaraldehyde, pH 7.2, for 5 min at room temperature), and rinsed with PBS. The sections were then incubated with an X-gal (Invitrogen) staining solution for 2–6 h at 37 °C. The X-gal staining solution was prepared by mixing 1 ml of a stock solution of X-gal (40 mg/ml in dimethyl sulfoxide) with 40 ml of PBS containing 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide trihydrate, and 2 mm MgCl2. After staining, the slides were rinsed with PBS, washed twice for 2 min with deionized water, and counterstained for 1–2 min with Nuclear Fast Red. The slides were washed again with PBS and deionized water and coverslipped with Gelmount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA). Testes from 3-month-old malePss2−/− mice (n = 30) and littermatePss2+/− and Pss2+/+ controls (n= 27) were dissected free from surrounding tissue and weighed. Fasting serum (100 μl) was obtained from 4-month-old malePss2−/− mice (n = 8) and littermatePss2+/− and Pss2+/+ controls (n= 10), and serum FSH levels were measured with an immunoassay (18Kovacic N. Parlow A.F. Endocrinology. 1972; 91: 910-915Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted from tissue homogenates or fibroblasts by the method of Bligh and Dyer (17Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). The lipid-containing lower fraction was removed and washed three times with methanol/water (1:1, v/v). The lower phase was dried under a flow of nitrogen, and lipids were dissolved in chloroform containing 0.05% (w/v) butylated hydroxytoluene. Lipid composition was determined with a high performance liquid chromatography system (System Gold; Beckman) with a 4.8 × 100-mm silica column (Allsphere Silica; 3 μm; Alltech, Nicholasville, KY) coupled to an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD 2000; Alltech). The mobile phase consisted of isopropyl alcohol/n-hexane/water run as a ternary gradient (58:40:2 to 52:40:8, v/v/v) in 10 min, followed by a stationary phase (52:40:8, v/v/v) for 35 min. Nouveau software (Beckman) was used for instrument control, data acquisition, and data analysis. Calibration curves were obtained for the different phospholipids by injection of known quantities of lipid standards. Livers and testes were removed from Pss2+/+ and Pss2−/− mice and homogenized in a motor-driven Dounce homogenizer in 4 volumes (w/v) of buffer containing 250 mm mannitol, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm EGTA, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Unbroken cells and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (600 × g for 10 min). Mitochondria were then pelleted with a second centrifugation (10,300 × g for 10 min). The supernatant fluid from the second centrifugation was subjected to ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g; the resultant pellet was designated as microsomes. Lipids were extracted from the microsomes (17Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar) and separated by thin layer chromatography in the solvent system chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/formic acid/water (70:30:12:4:2, v/v/v/v/v). Phospholipids were identified by exposure to iodine vapor and comparison with standards. Bands corresponding to phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol were scraped from the plate, and the amount of each phospholipid (nmol/mg of protein) was determined by measurement of lipid phosphorus (19Zhou X. Arthur G. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1233-1236Google Scholar). Pss1 andPss2 are both expressed in a broad and overlapping group of organs, as judged by multiple-tissue Northern blots (Fig.1, A and B).Pss2 is expressed at particularly high levels in the testis, but Pss1 is also expressed there. Pss1 is highly expressed in liver and heart, but Pss2 is also expressed in those tissues. To determine whether normal expression levels of both of the phosphatidylserine synthases are required for mammalian development and for viability of adult mice, we generated Pss2 knockout mice with an embryonic stem cell line containing an insertional mutation in intron 2 of Pss2. The mutation results in the production of a fusion transcript containing Pss2 sequences encoding the first 72 amino acids of the enzyme (including the first transmembrane segment) spliced to the CD4 transmembrane domain and β-geosequences from the gene trap vector (a fusion between Escherichia coli lacZ (encoding β-gal) and neo) (20Friedrich G. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1513-1523Google Scholar, 21Skarnes W.C. Moss J.E. Hurtley S.M. Beddington R.S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6592-6596Google Scholar). The production of the Pss2 -β-geo fusion transcript is under the control of the Pss2 regulatory sequences. Pss2−/− mice develop normally, appear healthy, and grow at the same rate as littermate control mice. The plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospholipid levels were no different than in wild-type littermates (data not shown). Female Pss2−/− mice exhibited normal fertility, as did the majority of the males, but ∼10% of the male Pss2−/− mice (n = 33 examined) were infertile or subfertile. The absence of a severe phenotype was not due to “leakiness” of the insertional mutation (e.g. production of a normal Pss2 transcript from the mutant allele). No normal Pss2 transcript (2.4 kb) was detectable in knockout mice (Fig. 1 C). As expected, a ∼10-kb Pss2-β-geo fusion transcript could be observed on a Northern blot hybridized with a neo probe (Fig. 1 D). The knockout of Pss2 did not result in increasedPss1 mRNA expression, either in fibroblasts cultured from Pss2−/− embryos (Fig. 1 E) or in the testis or brain of adult Pss2−/− mice (Fig. 1 F). To explore the contribution of Pss2 to total phosphatidylserine synthase activity in mammalian tissues, we measured the ability of tissue extracts to catalyze the exchange of radiolabeled serine, radiolabeled ethanolamine, and radiolabeled choline into phospholipids. Serine exchange activity was ∼95% lower in extracts from Pss2−/− testes than in extracts fromPss2+/+ testes (Fig.2 A). Serine exchange was also reduced substantially in the brain, heart, and liver ofPss2−/− mice, although to a lesser degree than in the testes (Fig. 2 A). The ability of tissue extracts fromPss2−/− mice to exchange ethanolamine was also markedly reduced (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, choline exchange, which is indicative of Pss1 activity, was increased by about 2-fold inPss2−/− tissues (Fig. 2 C). Base exchange activities in tissues from Pss2+/− mice were intermediate between those of Pss2+/+ and Pss2−/− mice (data not shown). Pss1 deficiency in CHO cells reduced phosphatidylserine synthase activity, and phospholipid composition of the mutant cells was perturbed when the cells were grown in ethanolamine- or phospholipid-depleted medium (6Stone S.J. Cui Z. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7293-7302Google Scholar, 8Voelker D.R. Frazier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1002-1008Google Scholar, 9Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol.

To determine whether Pss2 deficiency affected tissue phospholipid composition, we measured the phospholipid content of the liver, brain, and testis of Pss2−/− mice and littermatePss2+/+ controls. No significant differences were observed (Fig. 3). We also measured the phospholipid content of microsomes from the liver and testis ofPss2−/− and Pss2+/+ mice. Again, no significant differences were observed (Fig. 4).Figure 4Phospholipid composition of microsomes from liver (A) and testis (B).

Values are means ± S.D. from fourPss2+/+ mice and five Pss2–/– mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We considered the possibility that the normal phospholipid composition of Pss2−/− tissues might have been due to an equilibration of phospholipids at the whole-animal level, perhaps as a result of the delivery of phospholipids to tissues by plasma lipoproteins. To test that possibility, we examined serine exchange activity and phospholipid content of Pss2+/+ and Pss2−/− fibroblasts grown for 72 h in lipoprotein-deficient serum. Serine exchange inPss2−/− fibroblasts was reduced by ∼90% (Fig.5 A); however, no significant perturbation in cellular phospholipid composition was noted (Fig.5 B). To test whether the reduced serine exchange activity in extracts from Pss2−/− fibroblasts corresponded to a decrease in phosphatidylserine synthesis in intact cells, we determined the incorporation of radiolabeled serine into phosphatidylserine. Phosphatidylserine synthesis was reduced in Pss2−/− fibroblasts (Fig. 5 C). The cell types responsible for high levels of Pss2 expression are unknown. To address this issue, we examined β-gal expression (reflecting sites of Pss2 expression) in 20-day mouse Pss2−/− embryos and in adult Pss2−/− mice. In embryos, the highest levels of β-gal expression were in brown adipose tissue over the dorsal thoracic cage (Fig. 6 A,arrowheads) and in peripheral nerves (Fig. 6 A,arrows). As expected, the brown adipose tissue stained intensely with Oil Red O (Fig. 6 B). In adult mice, β-gal staining was intense in the brain, uterus, and testis. In the brain, β-gal expression was confined to neurons and was particularly prominent in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum (Fig. 6, Cand D) and in pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (Fig. 6 E). High levels of β-gal expression were also observed in the myometrium of the uterus (Fig.6 F). In testes of 4–6-month-old Pss2−/− mice (n = 25), we observed two histologic patterns. In the majority of the Pss2−/− mice (n = 22), testis histology appeared normal by light microscopy, with small numbers of Leydig cells in the interstitium, Sertoli cells surrounding the spermatic ducts, and abundant spermatogonia and maturing spermatocytes (Fig. 7 A). In the remaining three Pss2−/− mice, the testes were severely atrophic (∼30% of normal size), and histologic examination revealed hyperplasia of Leydig cells and contracted spermatic ducts with a thick layer of Sertoli cells and no spermatocytes (Fig. 7 B). We never observed atrophic testes in Pss2+/− (n = 9) or Pss2+/+ littermate controls (n = 27). Regardless of whether the histology ofPss2−/− mice was normal or abnormal, β-gal staining of Sertoli cells was intense (Fig. 7, A and B). β-Gal staining was detectable in Sertoli cell projections adjacent to spermatocytes, but no staining of spermatogonia or spermatocytes was observed. Higher power images revealed punctate β-gal staining within Leydig cells, but the staining intensity was invariably lower than in Sertoli cells. The finding of testis atrophy in 3 of 25 Pss2−/− mice but in none of the controls suggested that Pss2 deficiency might cause overt testis pathology but with incomplete penetrance. If this were the case, we hypothesized that a more thorough examination of malePss2−/− mice might uncover subtle abnormalities in testis size or function, even in animals with normal testis histology. To test this possibility, we compared testis weights in malePss2−/− mice (n = 30, all with normal testis histology) and in littermate Pss2+/+ mice (n = 27). These studies revealed a small (∼13%) but highly significant (p < 0.01) reduction in testis weight in Pss2−/− mice (Fig.8 A). Sertoli cells normally produce inhibin B, which negatively regulates serum FSH levels (22Meachem S.J. Nieschlag E. Simoni M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 145: 561-571Google Scholar). Thus, Sertoli cell dysfunction leads to low serum inhibin B levels and high serum FSH levels (22Meachem S.J. Nieschlag E. Simoni M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 145: 561-571Google Scholar). We suspected that subtle Sertoli cell dysfunction in Pss2−/− mice might be accompanied by increased serum FSH levels. Indeed, this was the case; serum FSH levels in Pss2−/− mice were significantly higher than in littermate controls (p < 0.01) (Fig.8 B). Over the past 10 years, a series of biochemical and genetic studies have established that mammals have two different enzymes for generating phosphatidylserine, Pss1 and Pss2 (2Kuge O. Nishijima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 151-156Google Scholar, 3Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Google Scholar, 4Kuge O. Saito K. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19133-19139Google Scholar, 7Stone S.J. Vance J.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 57-64Google Scholar). These two enzymes have significant sequence similarity but differ in their substrate specificities. In this study, we generatedPss2-deficient mice and used those mice and derivative cell lines to address a number of mysteries surrounding the mammalian phosphatidylserine-synthesizing enzymes. Our studies have added important new information to the field. First, it seems clear that both enzymes are not required for development. The observations that homozygous Pss2-deficient mice are viable, grow normally, and maintain normal tissue phospholipid compositions indicate thatPss2 is largely dispensable for development, at least under laboratory conditions. Second, we defined, by β-gal staining, the cell types that express Pss2 at high levels. The highest levels of Pss2 expression were located in the brown fat during development and in the Sertoli cells of the testis in adult mice. Third, we demonstrated that Pss2 accounts for the majority of serine exchange activity in mammalian tissues. Fourth, we demonstrated that Pss2 is not required for the maintenance of normal phosphatidylserine levels in cultured fibroblasts, even when the cells are deprived of ethanolamine and exogenous phospholipids. Testicular atrophy was noted in ∼10% of male Pss2−/− mice, and male mice lacking overt testicular atrophy had smaller testes than littermate controls. We suspect that these testes phenotypes could relate to a borderline capacity to synthesize phosphatidylserine in Sertoli cells, which provide nutritional support to the germ cells within the spermatic ducts (23Griswold M.D. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 211-216Google Scholar, 24Griswold M.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 379-391Google Scholar). Aside from the reduced testis weight, borderline Sertoli cell function was also suggested by the increased serum FSH levels. Interestingly, we could not document any significant perturbations in phospholipid composition in extracts of whole testes, although serine exchange activity was reduced by >95%. It is conceivable that phosphatidylserine levels could be reduced in a subset of the cells in the testes, such as the Sertoli cells, but we suspect that any such reductions would be slight and might well be buried within the variation inherent in measuring phospholipids. Extracts from Pss2-deficient tissues manifested an unequivocal increase in choline exchange activity. Choline exchange is mediated by Pss1 (4Kuge O. Saito K. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19133-19139Google Scholar, 6Stone S.J. Cui Z. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7293-7302Google Scholar, 8Voelker D.R. Frazier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1002-1008Google Scholar). A simple explanation for the finding would have been an increase in Pss1 expression in response to the deficiency in Pss2. However, as judged by Northern blots,Pss1 mRNA expression was entirely normal, both in mouse tissues and in cultured fibroblasts (Fig. 1, E andF). We favor an alternative explanation, that the increased level of choline exchange in Pss2−/− tissues reflects a posttranscriptional increase in Pss1 activity. Kuge et al.(25Kuge O. Hasegawa K. Saito K. Nishijima M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4199-4203Google Scholar) demonstrated that Pss1 activity is reduced by increased levels of phosphatidylserine in membranes, and they even identified a specific amino acid within Pss1 (Arg-95) that is crucial for the end product regulation of the enzyme. Thus, Pss2 deficiency could result in low levels of phosphatidylserine in some regulatory pool (i.e. membranes in the vicinity of Pss1), resulting inincreased Pss1 enzymatic activity and thereby explaining the higher levels of choline exchange activity. Serine exchange activity was reduced by ∼90% inPss2-deficient fibroblasts, but the phospholipid composition was normal, even when the fibroblasts were grown in ethanolamine-free and phospholipid-depleted medium. Serine exchange activities were similarly depressed in brain, testis, and liver, and once again, there were no perturbations in tissue phospholipids. The simplest interpretation of these observations is that the low levels of serine exchange activity in Pss2−/− mice (i.e. due to Pss1) are sufficient to maintain normal levels of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine. However, two additional factors might be relevant in explaining why phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine levels are not altered inPss2-deficient tissues. First, the ∼90% decrease in serine exchange activity in Pss2-deficient tissues was measured with an in vitro enzymatic activity assay, and that type of assay might not accurately reflect the rate of phosphatidylserine synthesis in the cell. The in vitro assay is performed under optimal conditions for which the amount of enzyme is limiting, whereas in the intact cell other factors (e.g. the supply of substrates, the presence of inhibitors, and the concentration of ions) might limit the rate of phosphatidylserine synthesis. Thus, although >90% of serine exchange activity in tissue extracts was eliminated by Pss2 deficiency, we cannot be sure that the rate of phosphatidylserine synthesis was invariably reduced to a comparable degree in each cell type and tissue. Second, and more importantly, a common homeostatic response to an increased rate of phospholipid synthesis is a concomitant increase in the rate of phospholipid degradation (6Stone S.J. Cui Z. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7293-7302Google Scholar, 7Stone S.J. Vance J.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 57-64Google Scholar, 23Griswold M.D. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 211-216Google Scholar, 24Griswold M.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 379-391Google Scholar). Decreasing the rate of phosphatidylserine synthesis could result in a lower rate of phosphatidylserine and/or phosphatidylethanolamine degradation, facilitating the maintenance of constant phospholipid levels. The metabolic labeling experiments in fibroblasts (Fig. 5 C) suggested that the synthesis of phosphatidylserine is reduced byPss2 deficiency, in keeping with the reduction in serine exchange activity. However, caution is advised in interpreting those fibroblast experiments. The cell lines used for those experiments were derived from different embryos (which were not on an inbred background) and had undergone independent immortalization events. In interpreting this experiment, one must consider the possibility that extraneous genetic differences, aside from the Pss2 mutation, could have had an indirect effect on phosphatidylserine synthesis rates. In the future, we believe that it will be essential to perform a comprehensive analysis of phosphatidylserine biosynthesis and turnover rates in multiple independent fibroblast cell lines and in multiple tissues from Pss2-deficient mice. Our current observations contrast with earlier results withPss1-deficient CHO cells (8Voelker D.R. Frazier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1002-1008Google Scholar, 9Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Google Scholar). In the CHO cells, serine exchange activity was reduced by ∼50% (using the same assay), but there were highly significant decreases in phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine levels when the cells were grown in ethanolamine-free and phospholipid-depleted media (7Stone S.J. Vance J.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 57-64Google Scholar, 8Voelker D.R. Frazier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1002-1008Google Scholar, 9Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5795-5798Google Scholar, 13Kuge O. Saito K. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23844-23849Google Scholar). Why is the phenotype of Pss1 deficiency in CHO cells so different? We speculate that the differences might be explained by the different substrate specificities of the two enzymes. We suspect thatPss2 deficiency is well tolerated because Pss1 is still capable of generating phosphatidylserine from phosphatidylcholine. Even when Pss2-deficient cells are deprived of ethanolamine, phosphatidylserine continues to be produced from phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine can still be generated by decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine. In contrast, in the setting of Pss1deficiency, Pss2 can generate phosphatidylserine, but only if phosphatidylethanolamine is available for the exchange reaction. In the absence of exogenous ethanolamine, when phosphatidylethanolamine cannot be generated from the CDP-ethanolamine pathway, there is no way to synthesize significant amounts of phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylethanolamine. In the setting of Pss1 deficiency, phosphatidylethanolamine can only be generated from phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylserine can only be generated from phosphatidylethanolamine. Thus, Pss1-deficient cells are dependent on exogenous ethanolamine to replenish their phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine stores. The availability of Pss2-deficient mice will make it possible to address a host of issues in the future. For example, we are intrigued by the high levels of Pss2 expression in neurons within the brain. Large amounts of phosphatidylserine are normally imported into mitochondria and then converted to phosphatidylethanolamine (26Vance J.E. Shiao Y.J. Anticancer Res. 1996; 16: 1333-1339Google Scholar, 27Stone S.J. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34534-34540Google Scholar, 28Monni M. Corazzi L. Migliorati G. Roberti R. J. Membr.

It would be interesting to determine whether the neurons of Pss2-deficient mice might be more susceptible to injury in response to metabolic conditions that limit the production of energy from mitochondria (e.g. hypoxemia or hypoglycemia). The current studies also raise several other issues for future experimentation. High on the list is how mice would respond to a deficiency in Pss1. For example, we would like to know whether Pss1 is dispensable for embryonic development of mammals, as was the case for Pss2. IfPss1-deficient mice survived development, we would like to determine how they would respond to a diet containing low levels of ethanolamine. We would also be interested in whether a singlePss1 knockout allele would elicit pathologic findings inPss2−/− mice. Answers to these questions will probably emerge over the next few years.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24117-24125Google Scholar), whereas the STT4-encoded PI 4-kinase is a membrane-associated 214.6-kDa enzyme (11Yoshida S. Ohya Y. Goebl M. Nakano A. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1166-1172Google Scholar). No other genes encoding PI 4-kinase enzymes have been identified from yeast. Moreover, the synthesis of PI 4-phosphate and PI 4,5-bisphosphate in a temperature-sensitive pik1 ts stt4 ts double mutant shifted to the restrictive temperature is reduced by 90–95% (13Audhya A. Foti M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2673-2689Google Scholar). Accordingly, it has been suggested that the PIK1-encoded and STT4-encoded enzymes may represent the only PI 4-kinase enzymes in yeast (13Audhya A. Foti M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2673-2689Google Scholar). However, biochemical evidence indicates the presence of additional PI 4-kinase enzymes in S. cerevisiae. Two membrane-associated forms (55- and 45-kDa) of PI 4-kinase have been purified and characterized from yeast (6Carman G.M. Buxeda R.J. Nickels Jr., J.T. Gross R.W. Advances in Lipobiology.

These enzymes have been classified as type II-like PI 4-kinases (3Balla T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 69-85Google Scholar). The deduced protein sequence of LSB6 (Lasseventeen binding), a gene of unknown function in the S. cerevisiae data base, has been identified as a putative member of the novel type II PI 4-kinase family (8Minogue S. Anderson J.S. Waugh M.G. Dos S.M. Corless S. Cramer R. Hsuan J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16635-16640Google Scholar, 9Barylko B. Gerber S.H. Binns D.D. Grichine N. Khvotchev M. Sudhof T.C. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7705-7708Google Scholar). TheLSB6 gene was originally identified in a two-hybrid screen using Las17p/Bee1p as bait (19Madania A. Dumoulin P. Grava S. Kitamoto H. Scharer-Brodbeck C. Soulard A. Moreau V. Winsor B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3521-3538Google Scholar). The Las17p/Bee1p protein plays a role in actin patch assembly and actin polymerization (20Li R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 649-658Google Scholar, 21Lechler T. Li R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 95-103Google Scholar). In this work, we showed that the LSB6 gene encodes a membrane-associated PI 4-kinase. The enzyme, which was not essential for cell growth under common laboratory conditions, could partially suppress the lethal phenotype of a mutant defective in theSTT4-encoded PI 4-kinase. The LSB6-encoded enzyme was localized to the plasma membrane and vacuolar membrane, and possessed enzymological properties similar to that of the membrane-associated 55-kDa PI 4-kinase enzyme.

When the cell density reached an A 600nm of 0.5, the expression of theLSB6 gene was induced by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to the growth medium. After incubation for 6 h, the induced cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Plasmid and genomic DNA preparation, restriction enzyme digestions, and DNA ligations were performed by standard methods (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Conditions for the amplification of DNA by PCR were optimized as described previously (24Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J.

Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was performed as described previously. DNA sequencing reactions were performed by the dideoxy method usingTaq polymerase (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The plasmids used in this work are listed in Table II. The LSB6 gene (locus YJL100W) (NCBI accession number 6322361) was cloned by PCR. A 3.3-kb DNA fragment containing 1 kb of the 5′-untranslated region, the entire protein coding sequence (1.8 kb), and 0.5 kb of the 3′-flanking sequence was obtained by PCR (primers: 5′-CAAGAGCTCGATACCTTCATCCCTTATG-3′ and 5′-TGCTAGACACTCACCAAACTGCCTTTCC-3′) using strain W303-1A genomic DNA as a template. This LSB6 DNA fragment was digested withSacI/DraI and inserted intoSacI/SmaI sites of plasmid YEp351 to generate plasmid pGH301. LSB6 HA contains sequences for an HA epitope tag inserted after the start codon. The LSB6 PCR DNA fragment was used as a template to produce a 5′-fragment ofLSB6 HA (primers: 5′-CAAGAGCTCGATACCTTCATCCCTTATG-3′ and 5′-AGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTACATGCTTTGGTTGGCTTCTTGAAAGTGTCT-3′) and a 3′-fragment of LSB6 HA (primers: 5′-TACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTAGTAACGAAGCTTACCAGCATGATCATACC-3′ and 5′-TGCTAGACACTCACCAAACTGCCTTTCC-3′). The 5′- and 3′-fragments ofLSB6 HA were digested withSacI/AatII and AatII/DraI and inserted into the SacI/SmaI sites of YEp351 to generate plasmid pDH1. LSB6 andLSB6 HA DNA fragments were released from plasmids pGH301 and pDH1 by SacI/PstI digestion and inserted into the same restriction sites of plasmid YEp352 to generate plasmids pGH302 and pGH303, respectively. The 1.8-kb LSB6open reading frame was amplified by PCR using plasmid pGH301 as the template (primers: 5′-CGGGATCCGATGAGTAACGAAGCTTACCAG-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTCAACACCAGGTGAATACGGG-3′). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and inserted into the same restriction site in plasmid pET-15b to generate plasmid pGH304. The correct in-frame fusion was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis. Plasmid constructions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To generate a GFP-tagged form of Lsb6p, the GFP open reading frame was integrated at theLSB6 locus just upstream of the stop codon to generate AAY1179 as described in Longtine et al. (27Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Google Scholar). A 1.7-kb fragment of LSB6 fused to GFP was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA from AAY1179 as the template (primers: 5′-GAGAAACACAGATAGAGGTCTAGACAATTG-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGACTCGACCCATGGAGTCTAGAATTCCACCATATTACCCTGTTATCCCTAGCGGATCTGC-3′). The PCR product was digested with XbaI and inserted into the same restriction site in plasmid pGH301 to generate pJA372. Plasmids pGH301, pDH1, pGH302, pGH303, and pJA372 were transformed into the indicated S. cerevisiae mutants for the overexpression of the LSB6 gene product. Plasmid pGH304 was transformed intoE. coli for the recombinant expression of the His-taggedLSB6 gene product.Table IIPlasmids used in this workPlasmidRelevant characteristicsSource or Ref.YEp351MulticopyE. coli/yeast shuttle vector containingLEU262Hill J.E.

The PCR product was transformed into strain SEY6210 to delete the chromosomal copy of the LSB6 gene by the one-step gene replacement technique (28Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Google Scholar). Transformants were selected for their ability to grow on SC medium without histidine. The deletion of theLSB6 gene was confirmed by PCR amplification of a 1.3-kb genomic DNA fragment using primers for LSB6(5′-CTGCTCGATACCTTCATCCCTTATGTGTTC-3′) and HIS3(5′-CCCTTTAAAGAGATCGCAATCTGA-3′). One of the lsb6Δ mutants that we isolated was designated strain AAY313. The pik1 ts stt4 ts double mutant (strain AAY105) was generated by mating pik1 ts (strain AAY104) andstt4 ts (strain AAY102.1) followed by tetrad dissection. The pik1 ts stt4 ts lsb6Δ triple mutant (strain AAY317) was generated by mating stt4 ts lsb6Δ (strain AAY314) with pik1 ts lsb6Δ (strain AAY315) and subsequent tetrad dissection. The stt4 ts lsb6Δ (strain AAY314) and the pik1 ts lsb6Δ (strain AAY315) double mutants were generated by matingstt4 ts (strain AAY102.1) with lsb6Δ (strain AAY313) and mating pik1 ts (strain AAY104.1) with lsb6Δ (strain AAY313). Thepik1 ts stt4 ts lsb6Δ triple mutant was confirmed by PCR. All steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells grown to exponential phase were harvested by centrifugation and disrupted with glass beads with a Mini-Bead Beater (Biospec Products) in 50 mm Tris-maleate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mmNa2EDTA, 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 5 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin (29Klig L.S. Homann M.J. Carman G.M. Henry S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1135-1141Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1,500 × g to remove glass beads and unbroken cells, and the resulting supernatant was used as the cell extract. The cell extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the soluble (supernatant) and total membrane (pellet) fractions (30Lin Y.-P. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8641-8645Google Scholar). The membranes were suspended in Tris-maleate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 20% glycerol. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Membranes were suspended in Tris-maleate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, and 1 mNaCl at a final protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. The suspension was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the salt-extractable membrane protein fraction (supernatant). Alternatively, membranes were suspended in the same buffer except that 1% Triton X-100 was substituted for NaCl. The suspension was incubated for 1 h on a shaker. After the incubation, the suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the Triton X-100-extractable membrane protein fraction (supernatant). All steps were performed at 4 °C. E. coli cells containing the His-tagged LSB6-encoded PI 4-kinase were washed once in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer and suspended in 30 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 0.5 mNaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were disrupted by a freeze-thaw cycle followed by two passes through a French press at 20,000 pounds/square inch. Unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell extract (supernatant) was gently mixed for 2 h with 2 ml of 50% slurry of Ni-NTA-agarose. The enzyme/Ni-NTA-agarose mixture was packed in a small disposable column. The column was washed with 10 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 0.5m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then with 30 ml of 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 45 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 7 mm2-mercaptoethanol. The His-tagged enzyme was then eluted from the column in 1-ml fractions with a total of 4 ml of 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 7 mm2-mercaptoethanol. SDS-PAGE (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) using 10% slab gels and immunoblotting (33Haid A. Suissa M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 192-205Google Scholar) using polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were performed as described previously. Mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibodies were used at a final protein concentration of 1 μg/ml. Goat anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate was used as a secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:5000. The HA-taggedLSB6-encoded PI 4-kinase was detected on immunoblots using the enhanced chemifluorescence Western blotting detection kit as described by the manufacturer. The HA-tagged protein on immunoblots was acquired by FluorImaging analysis. The relative density of the protein was analyzed using ImageQuant software. Immunoblot signals were in the linear range of detectability. Cell labeling and immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (13Audhya A. Foti M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2673-2689Google Scholar). Briefly, exponential phase cells were concentrated and labeled with Tran35S-Label for 10 min in yeast nitrogen base. Cells were then chased with 5 mm methionine, 2 mmcysteine, and 0.2% yeast extract for the indicated times, and proteins were precipitated with 9% trichloroacetic acid. Lsb6p-GFP was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with anti-GFP antibodies. Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Labeling cells with the vital dye CMAC was performed essentially as described by Stefan et al.(34Stefan C.J. Audhya A. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 542-557Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to early exponential phase in yeast nitrogen base containing appropriate amino acids and concentrated by centrifugation. Cells were then labeled with 100 nm CMAC in YEPD, followed by a chase in YPED without the vital dye for 45 min. Cells were concentrated by centrifugation and visualized by fluorescence microscopy using an Axiovert S1002TV inverted fluorescent microscope. Images were subsequently processed using a Delta Vision deconvolution system. PI 4-kinase activity was measured for 10 min by following the phosphorylation of 0.2 mm PI with 2.5 mm[γ-32P]ATP (10,000 cpm/nmol) in the presence of 50 mm Tris-maleate buffer (pH 7.0), 3.2 mm Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, and enzyme protein in a total volume of 0.1 ml (16Nickels Jr., J.T. Buxeda R.J. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16297-16304Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 0.1 n HCl in methanol. The32P-labeled phospholipid product of the PI 4-kinase reaction was extracted with chloroform (35Carman G.M. Belunis C.J. Nickels Jr., J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 183-189Google Scholar) and analyzed by chromatography on EDTA-treated silica gel plates (36Steiner S. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 81-88Google Scholar) using solvent system A and by chromatography on CDTA-treated silica gel plates (37Walsh J.P. Caldwell K.K. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9184-9187Google Scholar) using solvent system B with PI 4-phosphate and PI 3-phosphate standards. The PI 3-phosphate standard was produced from a PI 3-kinase reaction as described previously (38Stack J.H. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31552-31562Google Scholar). Solvent system A (36Steiner S. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 81-88Google Scholar) contained chloroform, methanol, 2.5 m ammonium hydroxide (9:7:2, v/v) (36Steiner S. Lester R.L. J.

https://openalex.org/W2058811074,"We report the fine structure of a nearly contiguous series of N-glycans from the soil nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans. Five major classes are revealed including high mannose, mammalian-type complex, hybrid, fuco-pausimannosidic (five mannose residues or fewer substituted with fucose), and phosphocholine oligosaccharides. The high mannose, complex, and hybrid N-glycan series show a high degree of conservation with the mammalian biosynthetic pathways. The fuco-pausimannosidic glycans contain a novel terminal fucose substitution of mannose. The phosphocholine oligosaccharides are high mannose type and are multiply substituted with phosphocholine. Although phosphocholine oligosaccharides are known immunomodulators in human nematode and trematode infections, C. elegans is unique as a non-parasitic nematode containing phosphocholineN-glycans. Therefore, studies in C. elegansshould aid in the elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway(s) of this class of biomedically relevant compounds. Results presented here show that C. elegans has a functional orthologue for nearly every known enzyme found to be deficient in congenital disorders of glycosylation types I and II. This nematode is well characterized genetically and developmentally. Therefore, elucidation of itsN-glycome, as shown in this report, may place it among the useful systems used to investigate human disorders of glycoconjugate synthesis such as the congenital disorders of glycosylation syndromes.

The fuco-pausimannosidic glycans contain a novel terminal fucose substitution of mannose. The phosphocholine oligosaccharides are high mannose type and are multiply substituted with phosphocholine. Although phosphocholine oligosaccharides are known immunomodulators in human nematode and trematode infections, C. elegans is unique as a non-parasitic nematode containing phosphocholineN-glycans. Therefore, studies in C. elegansshould aid in the elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway(s) of this class of biomedically relevant compounds. Results presented here show that C. elegans has a functional orthologue for nearly every known enzyme found to be deficient in congenital disorders of glycosylation types I and II. This nematode is well characterized genetically and developmentally. Therefore, elucidation of itsN-glycome, as shown in this report, may place it among the useful systems used to investigate human disorders of glycoconjugate synthesis such as the congenital disorders of glycosylation syndromes. Much of the current understanding of glycosylation processes in eukaryotes has been derived from yeast, mammalian cell lines, and organ tissues. Although these systems have been useful, they are not suited for the analysis of these processes in multicellular organisms as they relate to genetic, developmental, or environmentally interactive processes. Caenorhabditis elegans is a developmentally well characterized model organism. Its genome has been sequenced, and the organism can be genetically manipulated. Several gene ablation services are currently available, and these should increase the rate of genetic and biochemical progress. The wealth of genetic information has allowed the cloning of some glycosyltransferases through reverse genetics (1Chen S. Zhou S. Sarkar M. Spence A.M. Schachter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 288-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,2Hagen F.K. Nehrke K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8268-8277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, the lack of C. elegans N-glycan structural information has made substrate specificity and enzyme activity difficult to identify. Recently, the major O-linked glycan structures were reported (3Guerardel Y. Balanzino L. Maes E. Leroy Y. Coddeville B. Oriol R. Strecker G. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The observation of a novel β1,6Glc substitution facilitated the identification of the elusive activity of the previously cloned enzyme (4Warren C.E. Krizus A. Partridge A.E. Dennis J.W. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: G3-G9Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, the elucidation of theC. elegans N-glycan structures is warranted. Once this system is in place, the effect that aberrant glycan biosynthesis has at the multicellular level can be more clearly understood. Such an effect has been shown by the study of the sqv mutants where metabolic error in chondroitin biosynthesis leads to malformation of the nematode vulva (5Bulik D.A. Wei G. Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Waldrip W.R. Esko J.D. Robbins P.W. Selleck S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10838-10843Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Berninsone P. Hwang H.Y.

This group of diseases has been classified under the general heading congenitaldisorders of glycosylation (CDG) 1The abbreviations used are: CDG, congenital disorders of glycosylation; MALDI-TOF MS matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry, PNGase, peptideN-glycosidase; GP, glycopeptides; HF, hydrofluoric acid; dH2O, distilled water; GC/MS, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; Pc, phosphorylcholine; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HPAEC, high pH anion exchange; PAD, pulse amperometric detection; GNT, N-acetylglucosamine transferase1The abbreviations used are: CDG, congenital disorders of glycosylation; MALDI-TOF MS matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry, PNGase, peptideN-glycosidase; GP, glycopeptides; HF, hydrofluoric acid; dH2O, distilled water; GC/MS, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; Pc, phosphorylcholine; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HPAEC, high pH anion exchange; PAD, pulse amperometric detection; GNT, N-acetylglucosamine transferase (7Aebi M.

However, because yeasts are simple eukaryotes, information provided by yeast systems is only inferential when extrapolated to the multicellular organism. C. elegansmay aid in such investigations because the effects of errors in glycosylation manifest themselves throughout cell lineages and resultant tissue formation. Here we present an overview of the N-glycans produced byC. elegans. From mixed stage worms we have characterized a nearly contiguous series of N-glycans that suggest the majorN-glycosylation pathways in this nematode. Together with the sequenced genome and mapped cell fates of the organism, this information will facilitate understanding the role of glycosylation in development. All chemicals were ACS grade or better. Phosphocholine calcium salt was from Fluka (Fluka Chemie GmbH, Industriestrasse 25, CH-9471 Buchs SG, Switzerland). TEPC-15 antibody and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate were from Sigma, and the chemiluminescence detection kit was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The PNGase F used in this study was the kind gift of Dr. Thomas Plummer. SDS-PAGE and blotting to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes was performed as described previously (9Bollag M.D. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1990: 95-139Google Scholar). Wheat germ agglutinin was purchased from EY (EY Laboratories, Inc., San Mateo, CA) and TEPC-15 from Sigma. Protein loading was normalized to protein concentration. The procedure was monitored by Bearden's protein assay (10Bearden Jr., J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 533: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) and phenol-sulfuric assay for neutral hexose (11Duboius M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Biochem. 1956; 28: 350-356Google Scholar).C. elegans N2 worms (100 g wet weight) were suspended in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, which included 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.3% sodium azide. Worms were disrupted by bead beating with 425–600-μm glass beads in a BioSpec Bead Beater® 6 times for 1 min and were submerged in ice for 5 min between repetitions. Worm homogenate was lyophilized, followed by delipidation by 4000-fold extraction from 10:10:1 chloroform/methanol/water (CMW) and removal of free glycan by extensive solvent extraction from 50% methanol, which was monitored for neutral hexose by phenol-sulfuric assay. No protein was detectable in the methanol extract by Bearden's protein assay, indicating that the detected carbohydrate was not covalently linked to protein. Protein was solubilized in 125 mm Tris chloride, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol buffer (TSB), by boiling for 10 min followed by agitation on a rotary shaker for 3 h and then centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The procedure was performed three times, and the soluble supernatants were combined, dialyzed, and digested with l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) for 4 h at 37 °C in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5. The reaction was stopped by boiling two times for 10 min. An adaptation of the solvent precipitation method for the isolation of oligosaccharides of Verosteket al. (12Verostek M.F. Lubowski C. Trimble R.B. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 278: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was employed. The majority of peptides and glycopeptides (GP) were precipitated in 80% acetone. To recover the remaining peptides in the 80% acetone, the solvent was rotary evaporated to dryness, the residue resuspended in dH2O, and peptides further purified over C-18 Sep-Pak® by step elution using 2 column volumes each of 20, 40, 60, and 100% isopropyl alcohol subsequent to an aqueous wash of dH2O to first remove residual contaminants from the C-18-bound PG. Solvent and C-18-purified GP were combined and glycans released with PNGase F activity. The reaction was adjusted to pH 5.5 with acetic acid, and oligosaccharide was recovered by precipitation in 50% methanol at −20 °C for 4 h followed by centrifugation. The 50% methanol extract was rotary evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in dH2O, and residual peptide/glycopeptides were removed using the same Sep-Pak® C-18 procedure described above. At this step the dH2O eluate contained glycan, and residual GP was recovered in the isopropyl alcohol elution. The recovered GP was rotary evaporated, resuspended in 50 mm pH 5.5 ammonium acetate buffer, and digested with PNGase A at 2.5 milliunits/ml (Roche Diagnostics). The released oligosaccharides and GP were collected using the same procedures as employed for those released by the PNGase F. PNGase A releasedN-glycans with α1,3Fuc linked to the reducing end GlcNAc residue, whose linkages are not accessible to PNGase F. Size exclusion chromatography was performed on a 2.6 × 100-cm Bio-Gel P-4 column calibrated with cytochromec as the void volume marker, Glc0–3[3H]Man5–9GlcNAc2oligosaccharides, and raffinose. HPAEC was performed on a Dionex DX-600 chromatography system equipped with a PA-100 analytical column and PAD detector using methods reported previously (13Townsend R.R. Hardy M.R. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Fractions were collected for off-line MS and NMR analysis (see below). Oligosaccharides were evaporated to dryness and resuspended in 48% hydrofluoric acid (HF) for 48 h. The reaction was stopped by neutralization with saturated LiOH solution. LiF salt precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the hydrolyzed product was evaporated in a Savant® Speed evacuation apparatus. Approximately 0.10–3.0 nmol of each polysaccharide sample was dried in a Savant® speed evacuation apparatus and permethylated using a modification of the Me2SO/NaOH method of Ciucanu and Kerek (14Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3177) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼200 mg of NaOH was added per ml of Me2SO. Dried polysaccharides were resuspended in the NaOH/Me2SO solution (100 μl) and allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 h. One-half volume of iodomethane (Sigma) was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h, at which time an additional volume of NaOH/Me2SO and one-half volume of iodomethane were added. The reactions were allowed to proceed for an additional hour and then were terminated by addition of 2 reaction volumes of dH2O. An equal volume of chloroform was added, and the permethylated sugars, which partition into the hydrophobic phase, were extracted repeatedly against dH2O. The chloroform was evaporated and sample reconstituted in 70% methanol. For the permethylation of HF-treated glycans, the reaction was ended after the 1st h and the chloroform/dH2O wash procedure was performed. The sample was evaporated by speed evacuation and again permethylated for an additional hour followed by reaction termination and processing as above. Monosaccharide composition of glycopeptide/peptide and released glycans was determined by GC/MS on a Finnigan TRACE GC 2000 series coupled to the GCQ plus electron ionization ion trap mass spectrometer. Monosaccharides generated by acid hydrolysis of glycans were trimethylsialylated and analyzed. MALDI-TOF MS was performed on permethylated glycans using either a Finnogan Vision 2000 or Bruker Reflex IV instrument fitted with a nitrogen laser (337 nm, 3-ns pulse width) operated in positive ion linear and/or reflectron mode(s). To acquire branch information on select glycan species, jack bean α-mannosidase digestions were performed using a method published previously (15Berman E. Allerhand A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6657-6662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by permethylation and analysis by MALDI-TOF MS. Targets were spotted in a layered fashion allowing each layer to dry before adding the next. First, 1 μl of 6-aza-2-thiothymine (15 mg/ml in 70% methanol) was spotted. Next, an equal volume of 20 mm NaOAc was layered over the top, and finally 15–30 pmol of the permethylated oligosaccharide mixture in 70% methanol was layered. The TOF MS mass scales were calibrated externally with a mixture of malto-oligosaccharides in the size range of Glc4–10purchased from Sigma. Permethylated authentic Man9GlcNAc2 (Sigma) was also used as external standard. Average masses were reported for spectra collected in linear mode, and monoisotopic values for the 12C peak were reported for those collected in reflectron mode. Mass accuracy was ± 0.1%. Polysaccharide samples were exchanged from 99.9%2H2O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) three times followed by three additional exchanges from 99.96%2H2O (Cambridge Isotopes) three times. The samples were then reconstituted in 99.96% 2H2O and lyophilized for 2 days and stored over P2O5 in vacuo for several days. Samples were reconstituted in 99.996% 2H2O (Cambridge Isotopes) with 5 mm acetone added as internal standard. All spectra were collected on a Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometer. Spectral width for one-dimensional experiments was 3008 Hz collected with 8 K points digitization. Total scans were 1024. The two-dimensional DQF-COSY experiments were performed with spectral widths of 1608 Hz in botht 1 and t 2 dimensions. Digitization was 512 and 4096 points in t 1 andt 2, respectively. Line broadening of 3–5 Hz/Hz was used in both dimensions, and a sine bell squared adiposation function was applied in t 2. One-dimensional spectra were collected at 300 and 318 K and internally referenced to acetone at 2.225 and 2.217 ppm, respectively. DQF-COSY spectra were collected at 300 K and internally referenced to acetone at 2.225 ppm. For resonance intensity integrations, FIDs were collected for ∼5 times t 1 relaxation time. By using wheat germ agglutinin for detection, we found thatC. elegans N-glycans are releasable with PNGase F. Only a trace amount of N-glycan was detectable by 1H NMR analysis of PNGase A released material performed subsequent to PNGase F treatment, suggesting that C. elegans mixed stageN-glycans contain little α1,3-linked core Fuc (data not shown). TEPC-15 IgA detects phosphorylcholine (Pc). A TEPC-15 blot of the glycoprotein of the nematode showed a loss of antibody binding subsequent to PNGase F treatment suggesting that a portion of C. elegans N-glycans contain the Pc functional group. The overall goal of this work was to provide an overview ofN-glycosylation in C. elegans. PNGase F-released glycans were separated by size exclusion Bio-Gel P-4, and detection was by the phenol-sulfuric assay. The glycans were first pooled widely (Fig. 1, pools a–d) and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS to determine major and minor component glycan compositions (Table I). Narrow pooling (Fig. 1, pools A–E) for fine structural determination of major pool isomers was accomplished (Table II, Figs.

Seven μg of oligosaccharide from the included volume of the Bio-Gel P-4 eluate was analyzed by GC/MS. Fuc, Man, and GlcNAc were identified on the basis of their GC retention times and electron ionization mass spectra. It is noteworthy that no sialic acid was seen, a result consistent with the previous report for C. elegans (16Bacic A. Kahane I. Zuckerman B.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1990; 71: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A major concern in this work was the detectability of both abundant and rare glycans. As our glycan source was from mixed stage worms, it was expected that glycans derived from the lower mass larval stages would be under-represented. To address this issue properly, an aliquot of Bio-Gel P-4 separated glycans was pooled widely to include all fractions of the included volume. The glycans were then derivatized by permethylation. We have employed an HF hydrolysis and permethylation strategy in order to aid in providing an overview of glycoconjugates in this study. Permethylation tends to impart similar chemical properties over a wide range of oligosaccharides, which translates into similar detector response with added sensitivity in MALDI-TOF MS analysis. HF treatment has been used in combination with permethylation to aid in characterizing oligosaccharides in complex mixtures, where some components contain Pc (17Haslam S.M. Houston K.M. Harnett W. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Dell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20953-20960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Haslam S.M. Coles G.C. Munn E.A. Smith T.S. Smith H.F. Morris H.R. Dell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30561-30570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). As C. elegans protein extracts bind TEPC-15, we anticipated that some glycoconjugates would contain Pc and therefore used oligosaccharide permethylation, with and without prior hydrolysis with HF, to aid glycan detection. Table I summarizes the MALDI-TOF MS spectra of permethylated and HF-treated and permethylated glycans and their compositions assigned on the basis of observedm/z values (Fig. 1, pools a–d). The compositions indicate the presence of five classes ofN-glycan compounds, which include high mannose, mammalian-type hybrid and complex, fuco-pausimannosidic, and those containing Pc. Permethylation alone produced ions representative of all classes. Complex and hybrid glycans were more numerous than high mannose and fuco-pausimannosidic. HF treatment prior to permethylation produced a change in relative abundance of detected glycan types, where high mannose glycans were most abundant followed by fuco-pausimannosidic and hybrid glycans, and complex glycans were absent. The appearance of an ion at m/z1768.4 was in agreement with Hex5GlcNAc2Pi2, which is consistent with loss of two choline groups and substitution with methyl groups during the permethylation procedure, a modification that has been noted (19Gerdt S. Dennis R.D. Borgonie G. Schnabel R. Geyer R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 952-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). At this point in our investigation the following three lines of evidence pointed toward the presence of Pc oligosaccharides: a Western blot result that was positive for TEPC-15 reactiveN-glycans; a change in glycan class detection upon HF treatment, presumably resulting from a change in surface activity due to release of phosphate esters; and appearance of them/z 1768.4 ion described above. Further investigation of the Pc as well as the other classes ofN-glycans is described below. For a more detailed structural analysis of the major glycans present, the Bio-Gel P-4 eluate was pooled more narrowly as shown in Fig. 1. Permethylation ± HF treatment was performed, and the glycans were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS to estimate pool complexity and relative abundance of glycan species. The narrowly pooled glycans (Fig. 1,pools A–E) contained the major N-glycans from mixed stage C. elegans (see Table I and Supplemental Material Fig. 2). One-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H DQF-COSY NMR spectroscopy of each pool revealed the glycosidic linkage and sequence of the pools A–E and confirmed the monosaccharide components determined previously by GC/MS. Anomeric proton chemical shifts and their relative proton intensities, as integrated from one-dimensional spectra, are shown in Table II. The two-dimensional 1H DQF-COSY experiment allows C1-H/C2-H correlations to be well resolved which, in combination with the library of these chemical shifts and associated coupling constant data, allows the linkage arrangement of oligosaccharides in complex mixtures to be assigned accurately (20–31). The DQF-COSY C1-H/C2-H region of pools A–E is shown in Fig. 8. The C1-H/C2-H correlation of glycan constituents are monosaccharide- and linkage-dependent. The results in Fig. 8 confirm the identities and linkage arrangement of the monosaccharide constituents of the pool. Apportionment of the anomeric resonance intensity of the one-dimensional NMR spectra gave each pool the constituent isomers and relative abundance (see Table II). HPAEC was used to isolate each pool component, and the compositions of individual glycan species were verified by linear mode MALDI-TOF MS analysis (HPAEC + MS) (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Fig. 7), which agreed well with the sequence and abundance of each isomer as determined by NMR analysis (see Tables II and III and Scheme FSII). In Scheme FSI four representative oligosaccharide structures, containing all residue types detected, are presented for the classes of N-glycans found in the high resolution study of narrowly pooled C. elegans glycans. Anomeric chemical shifts, linkage type, and the residue numbering scheme are provided in Scheme FSI. The NMR results will be discussed here along with HPAEC and MALDI-TOF MS results as these data are highly complementary. The isomers that were determined in each pool are shown in Scheme FSII.Table IIIIsomer Distribution by 1H NMR and HPAEC + MSPoolCompositionNMR isomer (pool %)HPAEC + MS PAD abundance%AMan9GlcNAc2A1 (70)61Man8GlcNAc2A2 (26)35Man3GlcNAc3A3 (Tr)Fuc2Man5GlcNAc2A4 (≈3)4BMan7GlcNAc2B1 (53)56Fuc1Man3GlcNAc3B2 (20)13Fuc1Man5GlcNAc2B3 (15)23Fuc1Man5GlcNAc2B4 (12)8CMan6GlcNAc2C1 (26)21Man6GlcNAc2C2 (38)40Man3GlcNAc3C3 (4)4Man3GlcNAc3C4 (12)13Man2GlcNAc3C5 (4)6Man4GlcNAc3C6 (2)2Man5GlcNAc2C7 (4)4Fuc1Man4GlcNAc2C8 (6)6Fuc1Man5GlcNAc2C9 (4)5DMan5GlcNAc2D1 (55)55Pc3Man5GlcNAc2D2 (7)7Fuc1Man5GlcNAc2D3 (13)13Fuc1Man3GlcNAc2D4 (22)25Man3GlcNAc3D5 (3)EFuc1Man3GlcNAc2E1 (96)100Man3GlcNAc2E2 (4) Open table in a new tab The majority (96%) of the pool A components were high mannose glycans. 70% were Man9GlcNAc2 and were identical to the unprocessed form found in the ER prior to mannosidase trimming. Another 26% were Man8GlcNAc2 and differed from the previous glycoform only by the absence of the middle arm α1,2Man residue after, presumably, being trimmed by ER α1,2-mannosidase. Three trace components were detected by HPAEC + MS including two isomers of Fuc2Man5GlcNAc2, eluting at separate positions by HPAEC, and one Man3GlcNAc3 isomer. The trace components were not in sufficient abundance to determine their fine structure. The pool isomers are shown in Scheme FSII. Key NMR proton resonances used in isomer assignments are underlined in TableII. Mass spectrometry, HPAEC + MS, exoglycosidase data, and NMR analyses that resulted isomer assignments are discussed in detail below. HPAEC separation of pool A glycans produced four well resolved peaks, which were centered at 4.6 (2%), 7.4 (2%), 15.1 (35%), and 19.7 (61%) min.

https://openalex.org/W2055307687,"T-lymphocyte activation requires sustained Ca2+ signaling dependent upon capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE). The protein(s) that forms the stores-operated Ca2+ channel (SOCC) responsible for CCE has long been sought but has not been definitively identified. Members of the TRPV family (transient receptor potential superfamily-vanilloid receptor subfamily) of channel genes have been proposed to encode SOCCs responsible for CCE in non-excitable cells. Here we present evidence that a member of the TRPV group, CaT1, is involved in generating ICRAC, the CCE current that is necessary for T-cell activation. CaT1 is expressed in Jurkat T-lymphocytes. When overexpressed in Jurkat cells, CaT1 produces a Ca2+ entry current that mimics the endogenous ICRAC in its dependence on external Ca2+, inactivation by elevated concentration of internal Ca2+, and pharmacological block by capsaicin. Overexpressed CaT1 is partially regulated by the release of internal Ca2+ stores via thapsigargin or receptor-mediated generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. A pore-region mutant of CaT1, TRIA-CaT1, fails to carry Ca2+ currents and associates with co-expressed wild type CaT1 to functionally suppress permeation of Ca2+ ions. Expression of the TRIA-CaT1 mutant in Jurkat cells results in suppression of the endogenous ICRAC. Taken together these results indicate that CaT1 is the channel protein that contributes to T-lymphocyte SOCCs either alone or as a subunit in a heterogeneous channel complex.

Expression of the TRIA-CaT1 mutant in Jurkat cells results in suppression of the endogenous ICRAC. Taken together these results indicate that CaT1 is the channel protein that contributes to T-lymphocyte SOCCs either alone or as a subunit in a heterogeneous channel complex. Capacitative calcium entry (CCE) 1The abbreviations used are: CCE, capacitative calcium entry; SOCC, stores-operated calcium channel; ICRAC, calcium release-activated calcium current; TG, thapsigargin; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; RT, reverse transcriptase; DVF, divalent-free; GFP, green fluorescent protein via stores-operated calcium channels (SOCCs) is a basic mechanism for sustained Ca2+ signaling in a variety of cells (1Putney Jr., J.W. McKay R.R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 38-46Google Scholar, 2Lewis R.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 497-521Google Scholar, 3Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Google Scholar). CCE is activated by depletion of Ca2+ from internal Ca2+ storage sites (endoplasmic reticulum (ER)) after activation of G-protein-coupled receptors or tyrosine kinase-based receptors, that stimulate phospholipase C β or γ. Phospholipase C subsequently hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids to release inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) that binds to the IP3receptor located on the Ca2+ storage sites stimulating rapid release of Ca2+ to the cytoplasm. When the concentration of Ca2+ declines in the lumen of the ER, a signal is transmitted to SOCCs on the cell surface persuading them to open and allow external Ca2+ ions to enter the cell (4Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Google Scholar). The ionic current carried by Ca2+ entering through SOCCs in several cell types has been termed the Ca2+release-activated current (ICRAC) (5Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Google Scholar) or the depletion-activated current (6Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Google Scholar). The electrophysiological properties of the ICRAC have been studied in a variety of cell lines (7Fasolato C. Innocenti B. Pozzan T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 77-83Google Scholar). There are several defining features of the ICRAC as follows: high selectivity for Ca2+; a very small single channel conductance in the presence of divalent cations; large Na+ permeability in the absence of divalent cations; [Ca2+]i-dependent inactivation; and permeation or block by divalent cations (5Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Google Scholar, 6Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Google Scholar, 8McDonald T.V. Premack B.A. Gardner P. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2001; 19: 497-521Google Scholar). The biophysical properties, pharmacology, and regulation of ICRAC in the T-lymphocyte model cell, Jurkat cell, have been investigated by several groups (6Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Google Scholar, 8McDonald T.V. Premack B.A. Gardner P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3889-3896Google Scholar, 9Premack B.A. McDonald T.V. Gardner P. J.

Pfluegers Arch. 2000; 440: 580-587Google Scholar). In Jurkat cells, ICRAC is induced by stores-depletion via stimulation of the T-cell antigen receptor. The role of ICRAC in T-lymphocytes is to sustain calcium signaling and oscillation after immune activation. The sustained calcium signal leads to proliferation and a program of altered gene expression by allowing translocation of the transcription factor NFAT to the nucleus at a critical point in T-lymphocyte activation (18Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Google Scholar, 19Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Google Scholar, 20Li W.-H. Llopis J. Whitney M. Zlokarnik G. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1998; 392: 936-941Google Scholar). The identity of ICRAC proteins, however, has lagged behind advances in physiology due to lack of high affinity ligands or blockers and because most commonly used systems for heterologous expression exhibit some endogenous CCE. Until recently the best candidates for ICRAC have been proteins of the TRP family (21Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M. Vannier B. Brown D. Platano D. Sadeghi H. Stefani E. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15195-15202Google Scholar, 22Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Google Scholar). Members in TRPC subfamily had been shown to gate in response to the state of Ca2+ stores (22Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Google Scholar, 23Montell C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 755-763Google Scholar, 24Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14669-14671Google Scholar, 25Dutta D. J. Biosci. 2000; 25: 397-404Google Scholar); however, in each case complete recapitulation of classical ICRAC was lacking (26Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1069-1072Google Scholar). Two newer members of the TRPV group (27Montell C. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans; 2001/RE1)Google Scholar), ECaC1 and CaT1, have been described with characteristics similar to endogenous ICRAC (28Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W.

Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Google Scholar) performed an in depth electrophysiological analysis of heterologously expressed CaT1 that gave further support for it as a credible molecular candidate for ICRAC. A report from Nilius and co-workers (32Voets T. Prenen J. Fleig A. Vennekens R. Watanabe H. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Penner R. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47767-47770Google Scholar), however, provided evidence that the pore property of CaT1 differed from endogenous ICRAC in RBL cells. More recently, it was reported that despite the difference in permeation properties of CRAC and CaT1, CaT1 was capable of forming store-depletion activated conductances when heterologously expressed in RBL mast cells (33Schindl R. Kahr H. Graz I. Groschner K. Romanin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26950-26958Google Scholar). Clapham and co-workers (31Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Google Scholar) reported that they detected CaT1 by RT-PCR in Jurkat cells (31Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Google Scholar). In this study we further describe the expression of CaT1 in Jurkat cells and provide evidence for its functional contribution to T-lymphocyte ICRAC. The human CaT1 was cloned by RT-PCR using total RNA from human adult placenta (Stratagene). The forward primer for PCR begins at the start codon of CaT1 cDNA (5′- GGGAATTCATGGGTTTGTCACTGCCC), and the reverse primer starts with the stop codon of CaT1 (5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAGATCTGATATTCCCAGC). PCR primers introduced unique EcoRI and XhoI sites that were used for subcloning products into the expression vector pCMV-Tag3A (Stratagene) that provides an N-terminal c-Myc epitope tag and into the vector p3xFLAG (Sigma) to provide an N-terminal FLAG epitope. TRIA-CaT1 was constructed by an overlap extension PCR strategy (34Cui J. Kagan A. Qin D. Mathew J. Melman Y.F. McDonald T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17244-17251Google Scholar). The mutatedKpnI/XhoI fragment was subcloned into myc-CaT1 vector described as above. All PCR fragments were verified by DNA sequence analyses. Northern blot was carried out using the NorthernMax system (Ambion). 10 μg of total RNA from Jurkat cells was electrophoresed in formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nylon membrane. The membrane was probed with 32P-labeled CaT1 cDNA fragment (1392–1719), hybridized at 42 °C overnight, washed with low stringency buffer 2 times for 5 min at room temperature, and then washed with high stringency buffer 2 times for 15 min at 65 °C. Autoradiography was performed at −80 °C for 3 days. The expression of CaT1 mRNA in Jurkat cells, HEK cells, CHO cells, spleen, and placenta was investigated by RT-PCR. cDNA was constructed from the total RNA of placenta and the cell lines using CaT1-specific primers. Primers for CaT1-(1907–2178) are as follows: forward, 5′-GGCAAGATCTCAACCGGCCAGC, and reverse 5′- CCGCTCGAGTCAGATCTGATATTCCCAGC; primers for CaT1-(861–1130) are as follows: forward, 5′-GGATGAGCAGTCCCTGCTGG, and reverse, 5′-GATATCGTCCTTAGGGGTCATG. ECaC1 primers are as follows: forward, 5′-GGGTTGAGAACCACAATGATC, and reverse, 5′-GGTAGACCTCCTCTCCATCCC. GAPDH primers are as follows: forward, 5′-TCACCATCTTCCAGGAGCG, and reverse, 5′-CTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGA. After an initial step for 5 min at 94 °C, amplification was performed for 5 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s; 43 °C for 1 min; 72 °C for 1.5 min followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s; 48 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. Samples were analyzed on a 1.2% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel. Quantitative detection of CaT1 in Jurkat cell was carried out by real time PCR using iCycler Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad). PCRs were performed using gene-specific primers in 15-μl volumes. 7.5 μl of SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 1.5 μl of 5 μmCaT1 primers (forward, 5′-GGATGAGCAGTCCCTGCTG; reverse, 5′-GTACGGCCGCCCGTACCG), and 4.5 μl of 1:10 diluted first-strand cDNA were well mixed into the 96-well 200-μl Thin Wall PCR Plates (Bio-Rad). Data were analyzed by iCyclerTM optical system interface (version 2.3). All the samples were triplicates and were repeated twice. GAPDH primers were used as internal control to normalize the expression of genes. The gene expression was presented as fold change compared with the control sample. CHO cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Gene transfer was performed using 5 μg of Qiagen Midiprep purified plasmid cDNA. Cells were electroporated in a 2-mm gap cuvette using BTX ECM 620 setting at 200 V, 72 ohms, and 1800 microfarads in 400 μl of cytomix media (35Cui J. Melman Y. Palma E. Fishman G.I. McDonald T.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 671-674Google Scholar). Cells were studied 24–72 h after transfection. A plasmid containing the cDNA for GFP was combined with CaT1 plasmids (in a ratio of 1:5 GFP/CaT1) for identification of transfected cells as described previously (34Cui J. Kagan A. Qin D. Mathew J. Melman Y.F. McDonald T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17244-17251Google Scholar). In co-transfection experiments, current amplitudes were normalized each day to a group of cells transfected with CaT1 alone to control for day-to-day variations in transfection efficiency. Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics at 37 °C, 5% CO2. 2 × 107 cells in cytomix media were co-transfected by electroporation at 175 V, 72 ohms, and 1800 microfarads. 4 h after transfection, 1 μg/ml PHA-P and 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate were added to enhance expression of introduced genes. Whole cell patch clamp membrane currents were recorded as described previously (8McDonald T.V. Premack B.A. Gardner P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3889-3896Google Scholar, 36Fischer B.S. Qin D. Kim K. McDonald T.V. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 238-246Google Scholar). The external solution contained 2 mm CaCl2, 145 mm NaCl, 10 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4, osmolality, 320 mm). When we needed external solutions that were nominally Ca2+-free, we substituted MgCl2for CaCl2. Completely divalent-free (DVF) solution contained 115 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm sodium EDTA, and 10 mm glucose. Pipette solution contained 140 mm Cs-aspartate, 2 mmMg-ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm Cs-HEPES (pH 7.2, osmolality, 290 nm). All experiments and solutions were performed at room temperature. Voltage clamp protocols using a holding potential of 0 mV and successive steps from −120 to 50 mV (in 20-mV increments) for 350 ms were used to generate current-voltage relationships. Voltage clamp ramps were generated from a holding potential of 0 mV and ramped between −100 and 50 mV over 300 ms. CHO or HEK cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of cDNA plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection for Western blot analysis. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel. Anti-Myc A-14 polyclonal antibody was used for detection of myc-tagged CaT1 proteins. For co-association of wild type and mutant CaT1 cells were detergent-lysed in NDET (150 mm NaCl, 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.4% deoxycholic acid, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Cell lysates were incubated with 30 μl of rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc antibody and protein G-agarose. Precipitated proteins were then eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies. HEK293 were transiently transfected with wild type CaT1 or TRIA-CaT1. 48 h after transfection, culture media were removed, and cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, rinsed once with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After washing with PBS, cells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. Cells were incubated with anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody in PBS containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 1 h at room temperature. A goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody was added at 1:500 dilution for 1 h in the dark. Images were captured using confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad, Radiance 2000) and analyzed by Adobe Photoshop. 8 × 105 Jurkat cells were co-transfected with 2 μg of cDNA plasmids and 0.5 μg of GFP using LipofectAMINE 2000 in 24-well plate. 24 h after transfection, cells were loaded at 37 °C for 15 min with 2 μm fura-2/AM-ester in culture medium and subsequently washed with Ca2+-free external solution twice. Fura-loaded cells were allowed to adhere to a poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslip chamber on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a 40× Fluor objective (NA 1.3). Cells were alternately illuminated at 340 and 380 nm (Lambda DG-4, Sutter Instrument Co.), and the fluorescence emissions at λ >480 nm were captured with Quantix CCD camera (Photometrics, Ltd.) and digitized and analyzed using an Axon Imaging Workbench system (Axon Instruments). All experiments were conducted at room temperature. Thapsigargin and SKF 96365 were purchased from Calbiochem. Fura-2/AM and goat anti-mouse Alex Fluor 488 were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Anti-Myc A-14 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All reagents for Northern analysis were purchased from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). Other reagents were from Sigma. In all experiments, the data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. In the case of significance (p < 0.05), Student's t test was used to compare individual groups. Human CaT1 cDNA was first cloned from small intestine, and strong expression was found in placenta, kidney, pancreas, and prostate (37Peng J.B. Chen X.Z. Berger U.V. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Vassilev P.M. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 326-332Google Scholar,38Peng J.B. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. Genomics. 2001; 76: 99-109Google Scholar). Although CaT1 mRNA was not initially detected in spleen or thymus by Northern analysis in original studies (29Peng J.B. Chen X.Z. Berger U.V. Vassilev P.M. Tsukaguchi H. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22739-22746Google Scholar, 37Peng J.B. Chen X.Z. Berger U.V. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Vassilev P.M. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 326-332Google Scholar), it was reported later that CaT1 was present in Jurkat T-lymphocytes by RT-PCR (31Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Google Scholar). To investigate CaT1 expression in Jurkat cells, we performed Northern analysis using total RNA from Jurkat cells and an ∼300-bp fragment of CaT1 cDNA as a probe. A clear ∼3-kb band was detected, corresponding to the size of CaT1 cDNA of 2902 bp (Fig.1 A). The probe we used for Northern analysis, however, was highly conserved in CaT1 and another TRPV family member ECaC1. To distinguish specific expression of CaT1 in Jurkat cell, we carried out RT-PCR using specific primer sets for CaT1 and ECaC1, respectively. Two pairs of specific primer for CaT1 were selected. Total RNA from human placenta was used as positive control. As shown in Fig. 1 B, expected PCR products were amplified in Jurkat cell, spleen cDNA library, and placenta using both specific primer sets for CaT1. In addition, ECaC1 transcripts were also detected in placenta and Jurkat cells but with less robust amplification (Fig.1 B). RT-PCR fragments were verified by nucleotide sequence to confirm the specificity of the amplified CaT1 and ECaC1 signals. We were not able to detect CaT1 expression by RT-PCR from either HEK or CHO cells (Fig. 1 C). To estimate the level of CaT1 mRNA in Jurkat cells, we quantified the relative mRNA expression of CaT1 in Jurkat cell and placenta by real time PCR using CaT1-specific primers. mRNA abundance was calculated and normalized by the abundance of internal control GAPDH from Jurkat cell and placenta, respectively. Our results indicate that the mRNA abundance in Jurkat cell is about 40-fold lower than that in placenta (Fig. 1 D). We heterologously expressed Myc-tagged CaT1 cDNA in CHO cells to determine the biophysical properties of our cloned channel. Although only a small background current was detected in mock-transfected cells (Fig.2 A), we observed a large inwardly rectifying current in CaT1-transfected CHO cells (Fig.2 B). As reported previously (31Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Google Scholar, 33Schindl R. Kahr H. Graz I. Groschner K. Romanin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26950-26958Google Scholar, 39Hoenderop J.G. Vennekens R. Muller D. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. Nilius B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 747-761Google Scholar) for CaT1 in heterologous expression systems, upon establishing the whole cell configuration with 10 mm EGTA internally, a large inward Ca2+ current was spontaneously activated and then subsequently inactivated (Fig. 2 B). Direct Ca2+-store depletion can be obtained with thapsigargin (TG), a specific inhibitor of smooth endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pumps resulting in a relatively rapid depletion of intracellular Ca2+ store independent from membrane receptor activation or generation of IP3 (6Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Google Scholar, 9Premack B.A. McDonald T.V. Gardner P. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5226-5240Google Scholar, 40Thastrup O. Dawson A.P. Scharff O. Foder B. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Bjerrum P.J. Christensen S.B. Hanley M.R. Agents Actions. 1989; 27: 17-23Google Scholar). When we depleted intracellular Ca2+ stores with 1 μm TG, we observed a modest enhancement in inward current density (from 4.0 ± 0.49 to 4.6 ± 0.55 pA/pF) (Fig. 2 C). By switching to a nominally Ca2+-free external medium the Ca2+ current nearly disappeared. Re-introduction of 2 mm Ca2+ in the bath solution elicited a dramatic increase in CaT1 current that was even larger than that after break in (Fig. 2, B and C). Our results confirm that the behavior of CaT1 current in response to thapsigargin-induced store depletion in CHO cells is qualitatively similar to ICRAC observed in other cell lines. We observed comparable results when we transfected CaT1 into HEK cells (data not shown). To examine the possible role of CaT1 in ICRAC, we overexpressed CaT1 cDNA within a cellular context containing known ICRAC activity, the Jurkat T-cell. Overexpression of CaT1 in Jurkat cells resulted in a markedly enhanced ICRAC-like inward Ca2+ current density compared with base line (Fig.3, A and B). The biophysical characteristics of CaT1 in Jurkat cells were comparable with those in CHO cells and similar to the endogenous Jurkat current. The current was dependent on external Ca2+; both fast and slow Ca2+-dependent inactivation was seen, and the channels were selective for Ca2+ over Na+ions. In untransfected Jurkat cells thapsigargin is capable of inducing store depletion and activation of ICRAC. In some untransfected cells, just establishing the whole cell patch clamp configuration spontaneously activates endogenous ICRAC. In CaT1-overexpressing Jurkat cells Ca2+ entry currents were usually stimulated spontaneously upon break in to the whole cell mode and slowly relaxed to a partially inactivated state. Addition of thapsigargin resulted in a modest enhancement of the Ca2+entry current density (Fig. 3 D) suggesting that the CaT1 current is partially sensitive to the state of the Ca2+stores. The [Ca2+]o dependence of the CaT1 current was demonstrated in its disappearance in a nominally Ca2+-free external solution. When Ca2+ was reintroduced after a period in Ca2+-free solution, there was a very large enhancement of the inward current beyond the initial values. This enhancement was transient as the current inactivated again to a lesser steady-state amplitude (Fig. 3 D). To examine a more physiological stimulation of CaT1, current experiments were performed in CaT1-transfected JHM1 cells, a Jurkat derivative that stably express type 1 muscarinic receptor (8McDonald T.V. Premack B.A. Gardner P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3889-3896Google Scholar, 41Goldsmith M.A. Desai D.M. Schultz T. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17190-17197Google Scholar, 42Desai D.M. Goldsmith M.A. Weiss A. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 615-620Google Scholar). Upon stimulation of the muscarinic receptor in these cells, phospholipase C was rapidly activated producing IP3, diacylglycerol, Ca2+ release, and subsequent signaling similar to stimulation through the T-cell receptor (41Goldsmith M.A. Desai D.M. Schultz T. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17190-17197Google Scholar, 42Desai D.M. Goldsmith M.A. Weiss A. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 615-620Google Scholar). When we applied 250 μm carbachol to CaT1-transfected JHM1 cells, we observed an enhancement of the inward Ca2+current consistent with a partial Ca2+-stores regulation of the CaT1 current (Fig. 3 E). To evaluate whether CaT1 shares pharmacological features with endogenous ICRAC, we tested the effect of a known SOC inhibitor SKF 96365 (43Chung S.C. McDonald T.V. Gardner P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 113: 861-868Google Scholar, 44Wallace P. Ayman S. McFadzean I. Gibson A. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1999; 360: 368-375Google Scholar) on CaT1. In Jurkat cells, the endogenous ICRAC was inhibited by 50 μm SKF 96365 (Fig.4 A). SKF 96365, however, had no effect on CaT1 expressed in CHO cells (Fig. 4 B). Our result agreed with a previous report (45Nilius B. Prenen J. Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 453-462Google Scholar) that SKF 96365 was ineffective on ECaC1. We next tested capsaicin on CaT1 activity. Capsaicin is a member of the vanilloid family and activates the vanilloid receptor, a member of the TRPV family (46Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Google Scholar, 47Ichikawa H. Sugimoto T. Neuroscience. 2000; 101: 719-725Google Scholar). At micromolar concentrations, however, capsaicin blocks CCE in PC12 cells (48Choi S.Y. Kim K.T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 107-114Google Scholar) and the endogenous ICRAC in Jurkat cells (36Fischer B.S. Qin D. Kim K. McDonald T.V. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 238-246Google Scholar). An analog of capsaicin, capsazepine, that inhibits the activity of capsaicin on the vanilloid receptor can partially block ECaC1 (45Nilius B. Prenen J. Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 453-462Google Scholar) and is effective in blocking ICRAC in Jurkat cells (36Fischer B.S. Qin D. Kim K. McDonald T.V. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 238-246Google Scholar). Capsaicin (250 μm, a concentration that completely blocks endogenous ICRAC in Jurkat cells (36Fischer B.S. Qin D. Kim K. McDonald T.V. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 238-246Google Scholar)) was effective in reversibly blocking Ca2+ entry currents in both Jurkat (Fig. 4 C) and JHMI (Fig. 4 D) cells that were transfected with CaT1. The similar capsaicin sensitivity of Jurkat ICRAC and CaT1 supports the hypothesis that CaT1 contributes to the endogenous current in Jurkat cells. To assess the contribution of CaT1 in Jurkat cell ICRAC, we constructed a mutant CaT1 that would suppress Ca2+ entry currents by assembling with wild type CaT1 subunits to form non-conductive channels. We substituted three alanines for residues 534–536 (FEL) that are conserved in the putative pore-lining region to create the mutant TRIA-CaT1 (Fig.5 A). Expression of TRIA-CaT1 alone in CHO cells produced a small non-selective cationic current that failed to pass Ca2+ ions and showed no regulation by Ca2+-store depletion (Fig. 5 B). Immunofluorescence analysis of Myc-tagged TRIA-CaT1 showed a cellular distribution identical to wild type CaT1 (Fig. 5 C). When expressed in HEK cells CaT1 and TRIA-CaT1 exhibited comparable staining patterns with evidence of surface expression and staining in the Golgi and ER locations typical of transiently transfected membrane proteins. Western analysis of Myc-tagged CaT1 and TRIA-CaT1 showed similar patterns with a major band near 80 kDa (predicted mass by amino acid sequence is 83 kDa) and a higher molecular weight band suggesting varied post-translational processing such as glycosylation and/or phosphorylation (Fig. 5 D). When differentially tagged wild type and mutant constructs were co-transfected, we could successfully detect co-immunoprecipitation indicating the capability of TRIA-CaT1 to associate with wild type CaT1 (Fig. 5 D). To examine the functional effect of TRIA-CaT1 on wild type CaT1, we co-transfected equal amounts of each cDNA in CHO cells. Cells co-transfected with TRIA-CaT1 and CaT1 yielded a Ca2+entry current smaller in magnitude than cells transfected with wild type CaT1 alone (Fig. 5 E). When we examined cells that were transfected with differing ratios of wild type and mutant CaT1, we observed a dose-dependent suppression that approached a nearly completely dominant negative effect for a tetrameric assembly (Fig. 5 F). The reduction in Ca2+-dependent current was seen at steady state and upon cycling between 0 and 2 mm external Ca2+ (Fig. 5 G). Thus, TRIA-CaT1 exerts dominant negative suppression on wild type CaT1 function. We then examined the ability of TRIA-CaT1 to alter the endogenous ICRAC in Jurkat cells. When TRIA-CaT1 was overexpressed in Jurkat cells the base-line current was similar to that of mock-transfected cells (Fig.6 A compared with Fig.3 A). Compared with GFP-transfected Jurkat cells or untransfected cells, those expressing TRIA-CaT1 showed markedly reduced inward Ca2+ current in response to thapsigargin (Fig. 6,B and C). Moreover, the Ca2+ current augmentation that normally occurs after cycling from Ca2+-free to Ca2+-containing external solutions (see Fig. 3 C) was greatly blunted in Jurkat cells transfected with TRIA-CaT1 (Fig. 6, B and C). ICRAC in Jurkat cells can be converted to a large conductance nonspecific cation current when external divalent species are reduced sufficiently (8McDonald T.V. Premack B.A. Gardner P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3889-3896Google Scholar, 13Kerschbaum H.H. Cahalan M.D. Science. 1999; 283: 836-839Google Scholar). When we examined cells in divalent-free external media (DVF), we observed a near-complete suppression in Jurkat cells transfected with TRIA-CaT1 (Fig.6 D). To confirm that overexpression of TRIA-CaT1 in Jurkat cells reduced endogenous CCE, we examined Fura-2-loaded Jurkat cells that were transfected with GFP, CaT1, TRIA-CaT1, or untransfected (Fig.6 E). Thapsigargin was applied to cells in Ca2+-free external solution to deplete the internal Ca2+ stores, and then Ca2+-containing solution (2 mm) was superfused to observe the rate and extent of CCE. The extent of [Ca2+]i elevation in untransfected cells and GFP-transfected cells was comparable, whereas cells transfected with CaT1 accumulated internal Ca2+faster and to a greater extent (Fig. 6 E). Cells transfected with TRIA-CaT1 have significantly slower Ca2+ entry with less total accumulation of Ca2+i. Thus, TRIA-CaT1 expression was capable of suppressing endogenous ICRAC and CCE in Jurkat cells. In summary, the data presented here confirm and quantify the expression of CaT1 mRNA in Jurkat T-lymphocytes and provide pharmacological and functional evidence for the contribution of CaT1 to the endogenous ICRAC. Despite the critical role that CCE plays in T-lymphocyte activation, experimental evidence suggests that resting T-cells express relatively few active channels on the surface with the biophysical estimate at ∼100–400 SOCCs per Jurkat cell (13Kerschbaum H.H. Cahalan M.D. Science. 1999; 283: 836-839Google Scholar). Our demonstration that CaT1 expression is lower in Jurkat cells than in placenta corresponds with this estimate. The biological function of SOCC in the two tissues is also compatible with the relative abundance of the channels; in lymphocytes finely tuned Ca2+ signaling only occurs briefly during immune responses and effects a signal transduction program. In the placenta, however, CaT1 channels are likely required for nutrition with constitutively active absorption of large amounts of Ca2+. When we overexpress CaT1 in Jurkat cells, the resulting current possessed characteristics of the endogenous ICRAC, however with some differences. Of note, the current was usually spontaneously activated upon breaking into a whole cell patch configuration. When high concentrations of Ca2+ chelators are present in the pipette solution, activation of CCE can occur; however, we observed the same activation when pipette solutions contained less chelator (from 10 to 0.5 mm EGTA, data not shown). The CaT1-dependent current was only partially responsive to Ca2+-stores depletion in transfected cells. As discussed by Yue et al. (31Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Google Scholar) this may be due to mismatched numbers of surface channels and the proteins involved in sensing and transmitting the information of the state of Ca2+ stores. It is possible that CCE is composed of a macromolecular complex with a precise stoichiometry that may be disrupted or uncoupled by forced overexpression of one element such as the CaT1 subunit. The [Ca2+]i-dependent fast and slow inactivation of ICRAC (10Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Google Scholar, 11Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14445-14451Google Scholar), however, appears intact in heterologously expressed CaT1. In assaying for molecular candidates responsible for ICRACin Jurkat cells, we also detected the expression of ECaC1, a member of the TRPV family, ∼75% amino acid homology to CaT1. The electrophysiological properties reported for these two channels are also similar (39Hoenderop J.G. Vennekens R. Muller D. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. Nilius B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 747-761Google Scholar). The sequence similarity between CaT1 and ECaC1 is such that the probe we used for Northern analysis may cross-react with ECaC1, which would be indistinguishable from a CaT1 signal; however, primers used for RT-PCR were CaT1-specific. Accordingly, we cannot exclude the possibility that ECaC1 also contributes to ICRAC in Jurkat lymphocytes. The suppression of endogenous ICRAC by mutant TRIA-CaT1 would argue against a functional contribution by ECaC1 unless CaT1 and ECaC1 are capable of forming heterotetrameric channels. We also detected and cloned another member in the TRPV family, VRL1, from Jurkat T-cell RNA (data not shown). Heterologous expression of VRL1 in CHO cells, however, could not produce detectable current at base line or upon thapsigargin treatment despite verified protein expression (at room temperature). Considering that the VRL1 channel is activated by extremes of temperature or pH (46Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Google Scholar) and that it normally supports a relatively non-selective cation current, it seems unlikely that it is responsible for ICRACin Jurkat. As in the case of ECaC1, we cannot exclude the possibility that VRL1 could also participate in a heterogeneous macromolecular complex that enables CCE. The evidence supporting a role for CaT1 in lymphocyte CCE includes its expression in cells, its biophysical similarity to the endogenous current, its partial regulation by Ca2+ stores, and the pharmacological block by capsaicin. The most compelling argument, however, comes from experiments with TRIA-CaT1, the CaT1 mutant with an altered pore region that abolishes Ca2+ conductance. We interpret the ability of TRIA-CaT1 to suppress current from wild type CaT1 as a specific co-assembly of wild type and mutant subunits into tetramers that fail to effectively pass Ca2+ ions. That TRIA-CaT1 also suppresses endogenous ICRAC in Jurkat cells is strong evidence that the mutant is interacting with and dominating CaT1 that is responsible (at least in part) for the native current. That capsaicin blocks both CaT1 and ICRAC but SKF 96365 only blocks the native current suggests that CaT1 might be the direct target of capsaicin, whereas SKF 96365 might indirectly inhibit CCE via the pathway between store-depletion and channel opening (thus explaining the slower kinetics of SKF 96365 action (43Chung S.C. McDonald T.V. Gardner P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 113: 861-868Google Scholar)). The reported discrepancy between pore conductance properties of ICRAC and CaT1 in RBL mast cells (32Voets T. Prenen J. Fleig A. Vennekens R. Watanabe H. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Penner R. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47767-47770Google Scholar) may be due to one of several possibilities. Different cell types and tissues may express unique profiles of proteins to produce CCE, and as such ICRAC in different cells may vary. This may be due to differential expression of channel subunits such as CaT1 or ECAC or other members of the TRP family. Variation due to alternative splicing is another possibility. Another very likely explanation is that heterologous expression of channel subunits frequently fail to completely recapitulate the endogenous phenotype because expression systems often lack additional subunits or accessory proteins that are present in the native tissue. Nonetheless, our results strongly point to CaT1 as a necessary contributing protein in the production of T-lymphocyte CCE. This provides a clear starting point for further identification of all the proteins that are involved in generating the signal cascade that begins with release of Ca2+ stores and results in sustained and complex Ca2+ signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2008388529,"SEDL is an evolutionarily highly conserved protein in eukaryotic organisms. Deletions or point mutations in the SEDL gene are responsible for the genetic disease spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda (SEDT), an X-linked skeletal disorder. SEDL has been identified as a component of the transport protein particle (TRAPP), critically involved in endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi vesicle transport. Herein, we report the 2.4 A resolution structure of SEDL, which reveals an unexpected similarity to the structures of the N-terminal regulatory domain of two SNAREs, Ykt6p and Sec22b, despite no sequence homology to these proteins. The similarity and the presence of unusually many solvent-exposed apolar residues of SEDL suggest that it serves regulatory and/or adaptor functions through multiple protein-protein interactions. Of the four known missense mutations responsible for SEDT, three mutations (S73L, F83S, V130D) map to the protein interior, where the mutations would disrupt the structure, and the fourth (D47Y) on a surface at which the mutation may abrogate functional interactions with a partner protein."

It is known that the cytoplasmic domain of GPIbβ is phosphorylated at Ser166 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). To understand the physiological role of GPIbβ phosphorylation, a GPIb-IX mutant replacing Ser166 of GPIbβ with alanine (S166A) and a deletion mutant lacking residues 166–181 of GPIbβ (Δ165) were constructed. These mutants, expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, showed an enhanced VWF-binding function compared with wild type GPIb-IX. Treatment of CHO cells expressing wild type GPIb-IX with a PKA inhibitor, PKI, reduced Ser166 phosphorylation and also enhanced VWF binding to GPIb-IX. Furthermore, cells expressing S166A or Δ165 mutants showed a significantly enhanced adhesion to immobilized VWF under flow conditions. Consistent with the studies in CHO cells, treatment of platelets with PKI enhanced VWF binding to platelets. In contrast, a PKA stimulator, forskolin, reduced VWF binding and VWF-induced platelet agglutination, which was reversed by PKI.

The GPIb-IX-VWF interaction also initiates an intracellular signaling cascade leading to platelet shape change, spreading, secretion, and aggregation (3De Marco L. Girolami A. Russell S. Ruggeri Z.M.

GPIbα and GPIbβ are covalently linked through a disulfide bond to form GPIb. GPIX is non-covalently associated with GPIb in a 1:1 ratio, and the GPIb-IX complex is non-covalently associated with GPV in a 2:1 ratio (1Ruggeri Z.M. Coller B.S.

Expression of the GPV polypeptide is not required for surface expression or the ligand-binding function of the GPIb-IX complex (9Lopez J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E. J. Biol.

The cytoplasmic domain of GPIbα also contains a binding site for the signaling molecule 14-3-3ζ located between residues 595 and 610 (13Du X. Harris S.J. Tetaz T.J. Ginsberg M.H. Berndt M.C. J. Biol.

Phosphorylation of GPIbα at Ser609 is required for high affinity binding of 14-3-3ζ to GPIbα (15Bodnar R.J. Gu M. Li Z. Englund G.D. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33474-33479Google Scholar). 14-3-3ζ has been shown to be involved in GPIb-IX-mediated activation of the integrin αIIbβ3 (6Gu M. Xi X. Englund G.D. Berndt M.C. Du X. J.

Berndt M.C. Wallace R.W. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15656-15661Google Scholar). It is known that platelet activation (including VWF-induced platelet activation) is inhibited by compounds that increase the intracellular concentration of cAMP such as prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and forskolin (6Gu M. Xi X. Englund G.D. Berndt M.C. Du X. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1085-1096Google Scholar, 22Salzman E.W. New England J. Med. 1972; 286: 358-363Google Scholar, 23Coller B.S. Blood. 1981; 57: 846-855Google Scholar). Elevation of intracellular cAMP levels induces the activation of PKA. The mechanism by which PKA inhibits platelets is not totally understood but is known to involve phosphorylation of multiple intracellular signaling proteins and regulation of multiple signaling pathways. For example, cAMP has been implicated in inhibiting Ca2+ influx (24Hettasch J.M. Le Breton G.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 931: 49-58Google Scholar) and phospholipase C activation (25Ryningen A. Olav Jensen B. Holmsen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1394: 235-248Google Scholar), as well as inhibition of G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways (26Manganello J.M. Djellas Y. Borg C. Antonakis K. Le Breton G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28003-28010Google Scholar). One of the major PKA substrates in platelets is GPIbβ (19Wyler B. Bienz D. Clemetson K.J. Luscher E.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 373-379Google Scholar, 20Fox J.E. Reynolds C.C. Johnson M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12627-12631Google Scholar, 21Wardell M.R. Reynolds C.C. Berndt M.C. Wallace R.W. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15656-15661Google Scholar). cAMP-elevating agents have been shown to induce GPIbβ phosphorylation at Ser166 (21Wardell M.R. Reynolds C.C. Berndt M.C. Wallace R.W. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15656-15661Google Scholar). In a study by Fox and Berndt (27Fox J.E. Berndt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9520-9526Google Scholar), PKA mediated inhibition of actin polymerization during collagen-induced platelet activation in wild type platelets but not in GPIb-IX-deficient platelets from Bernard-Soulier syndrome patients. This suggests that GPIb-IX and possibly PKA-mediated phosphorylation of GPIbβ are important in PKA-mediated inhibition of actin polymerization. However, it is not clear if, and how, PKA-mediated GPIbβ phosphorylation affects GPIb-IX function. In this study, we have examined the role of phosphorylation of GPIbβ at Ser166 in regulating the receptor function of GPIb-IX. We show that wild type GPIb-IX phosphorylated at Ser166poorly interacts with VWF. A point mutation that changes Ser166 of GPIbβ to alanine disrupts Ser166phosphorylation and enhances the VWF-binding function of GPIb-IX. Furthermore, activation of PKA increases GPIbβ phosphorylation in platelets and inhibits VWF binding to GPIb-IX, whereas inhibition of PKA inhibits GPIbβ phosphorylation and enhances VWF binding. Thus, PKA-mediated phosphorylation of GPIbβ at Ser166negatively regulates the VWF-binding function of GPIb-IX.

Botrocetin was also purified as previously described (34Andrews R.K. Booth W.J. Gorman J.J. Castaldi P.A. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8317-8326Google Scholar). Ristocetin, forskolin, and dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) were purchased from Sigma. The membrane-permeable PKA inhibitor, myristoylated PKI, was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Transfection of cDNA into CHO cells was performed according to the LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) protocol. In short, CHO cells were plated at 5.25 × 105 cells/60 mm dish then cultured overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The DNA/LipofectAMINE mixture was added to the CHO cells and incubated for 6 h. at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Stably transfected cell lines were selected using selection media containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 and further selected by cell sorting using the anti-GPIbα monoclonal antibody, SZ2. The following cell lines were used: cells expressing wild type GPIb-IX (1b9) (6Gu M. Xi X. Englund G.D. Berndt M.C. Du X. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1085-1096Google Scholar); GPIb-IX mutants with the cytoplasmic domain of GPIbβ truncated at residue 165, lacking amino acids 166–181 (Δ165); or a serine to alanine point mutation at Ser166 in GPIbβ (S166A). For construction of the GPIbβ mutants Δ165 and S166A, DNA fragments were synthesized by PCR using wild type GPIbβ in the pcDNA3.1(−) vector, as the template. For the construction of the Δ165 GPIbβ mutant, the oligonucleotide GGGTCGGTACCTTACACGCGGGCTGCG was used as the reverse primer and CCCTACCGCGACCTGCGTTG was used as the forward primer. These fragments were digested with NotI and KpnI then ligated with GPIbβ in pcDNA3.1(−) vector digested with the same enzymes. For the construction of the GPIbβ S166A mutant, two DNA fragments were synthesized by PCR using the oligonucleotides CCCTACCGCGACCTGCGTTG as the forward and TCAGTGCCAGCCGGGCTG as the reverse for the 5′-fragment and AGCCCGGCTGGCACTGAC as the forward and TAGAAGGCACAGTCGAGG as the reverse for the 3′-fragment using wild type GPIbβ in the vector pcDNA3.1(−) as template. The two PCR products (containing a 17-base pair overlap) were combined with the oligonucleotides CCCTACCGCGACCTGCGTTG as the forward and TAGAAGGCACAGTCGAGG as the reverse and amplified using the following cycling conditions: 94 °C × 5 min, 45 °C × 1 min, 72 °C × 1 min, 94 °C × 1 min for 5 cycles followed by 55 °C × 1 min, 72 °C × 1 min, 94 °C × 1 min for 25 cycles, and a final cycle of 55 °C × 1 min, 72 °C × 5 min. The final product was digested withNotI and KpnI, then ligated with GPIbβ in pcDNA3.1(−) vector digested with the same enzymes. The mutant GPIbβ was sequenced in both the forward and reverse directions to verify the nucleotide sequence. GPIbβ peptides, RAAARL(pS)LTDPLV (pS indicates phosphorylated serine) and RAAARLSLTDPLV, containing an N-terminal cysteine were synthesized by Chiron Mimotopes (Melbourne, Australia). The anti-phospho-GPIbβ (GPIbβ-P) antibody was raised by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits with the phosphorylated CRAAARLpSLTDPLV peptide conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma) (35Lerner R.A. Green N. Alexander H. Liu F.T. Sutcliffe J.G. Shinnick T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3403-3407Google Scholar). The anti-peptide antibody was affinity purified with the immunizing peptide conjugated to BSA and coupled on a 1:1 column of Affi-Gel 10/15 (Bio-Rad). The antibody was then absorbed with the nonphosphorylated CRAAARLSLTDPLV peptide conjugated to BSA, also coupled on a 1:1 column of Affi-Gel 10/15 (Bio-Rad). The specificity of the anti-GPIbβ-P antibody was verified by dot immunoblots against the CRAAARL(pS)LTDPLV and CRAAARLSLTDPLV peptides conjugated to albumin (1:10 w/w). Antibody reactivity was visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). CHO cells expressing wild type (1b9) and mutant GPIb-IX (Δ165 and S166A) were grown to confluence to synchronize cell growth. The cells were detached using 0.5 mm EDTA in PBS, pH 7.4. Seventy-five percent of the original volume was then resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium growth media and cultured for 18 h. The cells were detached using 0.5 mm EDTA-PBS, pH 7.4, then resuspended in Tyrode's buffer (2.5 mm Hepes, 12.1 mmNaHCO3, 2.36 mm KCl, 0.136 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl, 0.1%d-glucose, pH 7.4) with 1% BSA to a concentration of 2.25 × 106 cells/ml. The cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, then ristocetin (1.25 mg/ml) and purified VWF (35 μg/ml) were added and incubated at 22 °C for 30 min. The cells were washed once with Tyrode's buffer, further incubated in Tyrode's buffer containing 10 μg/ml FITC-labeled SZ-29 (monoclonal antibody against VWF) in the dark at 22 °C for 30 min and then analyzed by flow cytometry. As negative controls, cells were incubated in the presence of VWF alone or ristocetin alone then incubated with FITC-labeled SZ29. Nonspecific fluorescence was identical for either treatment (data not shown). The 1b9 cells were also preincubated with or without 50 μm PKI for 15 min or 2 μm forskolin for 5 min at 22 °C, prior to analysis for VWF binding. The preparation of washed platelets was as described previously (36Du X.P. Plow E.F. Frelinger A.L.I. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1991; 65: 409-416Google Scholar). Briefly, blood was drawn from healthy donors with no medication within 2 weeks, and anti-coagulated with 1/7 volume of ACD (2.5% trisodium citrate (w/v), 2.0% d-Glucose (w/v), 1.5% citric acid (w/v)). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was separated by centrifuging at 300 ×g for 25 min. Platelets were washed two times in CGS buffer (0.123 m NaCl, 0.033 m d-Glucose, 0.013 m trisodium citrate, pH 6.5) and were not exposed to cAMP-enhancing agents such as PGE1 and prostaglandin I2 (PGI2). The washed platelets were resuspended in modified Tyrode's buffer to a concentration of 1.0 × 107 cells/ml and treated with or without 100 μm of PKI at 37 °C for 15 min. The platelets were further incubated with forskolin (2 μm final concentration) or Me2SO (0.1% final concentration, vehicle control) at 22 °C for 10 min, then incubated with 1 mmRGDS peptide (an integrin inhibitor), 5 μg/ml botrocetin, and 35 μg/ml VWF at 22 °C for 30 min. VWF binding was detected as described above for CHO cells. Purified human VWF was diluted to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml with 0.1 mmNaHCO3, pH 8.3, and coated onto glass cover slides (22 × 40−1, Fisher) overnight in a humid environment at 4 °C. The cover slides were washed with PBS to remove unbound VWF, blocked with 5% BSA in PBS at room temperature for 2 h, and installed in a parallel flow chamber (Model RC-30, Warner Instruments Inc., Hamden, CT) with a silicon rubber gasket. The chamber has a depth of 0.075 mm, a width of 3 mm, and a length of 35 mm. The cells suspended in modified Tyrode's buffer containing 5% bovine serum albumin (5 × 106 cells/ml) were perfused by a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus Inc., Holliston, MA) into the flow chamber at various shear rates for 2 min. Transient adhesion (rolling) of cells on the VWF-coated surface was recorded on video tapes. Shear rate was calculated as described by Slack and Turitto (37Slack S.M. Turitto V.T. Thromb. Haemost. 1994; 72: 777-781Google Scholar). Transient adherent cells were counted in 10 randomly selected fields of 0.18 mm2 at randomly selected time points during the perfusion period. Whole blood was anti-colaguated with 0.38% sodium citrate, then centrifuged at 350 × g for 25 min and PRP obtained as previously described (38Englund G.D. Bodnar R.J. Li Z. Ruggeri Z.M. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16952-16959Google Scholar). The PRP was preincubated with RGDS (1 mm) and PKI (100 μm) for 10 min at 22 °C or forskolin (2 μm) at 22 °C for 5 min. VWF-dependent platelet agglutination was induced by the addition of ristocetin (1.25 mg/ml) to the PRP. Platelet agglutination was measured using a turbidometric platelet aggregometer at 37 °C with a stirring speed of 1000 rpm. The preparation of washed platelets was as described above (36Du X.P. Plow E.F. Frelinger A.L.I. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1991; 65: 409-416Google Scholar), and were not exposed to cAMP-enhancing agents such as PGE1 and PGI2. Washed platelets were resuspended in Tyrode's buffer containing 0.1% BSA to a concentration of 1 × 109 cells/ml and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. CHO cells expressing wild type Ib-IX (1b9 cells) were detached with 0.5 mm EDTA-PBS, pH 7.4, then resuspended in Tyrode's buffer containing 0.1% BSA to a concentration of 5.0 × 107 cells/ml. The cells were solubilized with an equal volume of solubilization buffer (0.1 m Tris, 0.01m EGTA, 0.15 m NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) containing 0.2 mm E64 (calpain inhibitor, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (Sigma), and 0.08 units/ml Aprotinin (Sigma) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (100 μl) was incubated with rabbit IgG or purified anti-GPIbβ-P antibody (5 μg) at 4 °C for 30 min then further incubated for 30 min after the addition of 25 μl (50% v/v) of Protein A-conjugated Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were separated from the supernatant by centrifugation. To quantitate the unphosphorylated GPIbβ in the platelet lysate, the phosphorylated GPIbβ was depleted by repeated immunoprecipitation with anti-GPIbβ-P antibody. The immunoprecipitates were combined then washed three times with wash buffer (0.1 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100). Both the platelet lysates depleted of phosphorylated GPIbβ and immunoprecipitates were diluted to an identical final volume with SDS sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and Western blotted with anti-GPIbα antibody, SZ2, to detect the GPIb-IX containing unphosphorylated GPIbβ. The results were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). To investigate the roles of phosphorylation of GPIbβ in regulating the functions of GPIb-IX, a conserved point mutation was made in GPIbβ that replaces Ser166 with alanine (Fig. 1). A truncation mutation was also made that deleted the C-terminal 16 residues of GPIbβ including Ser166. This deletion includes the reported 14-3-3 binding site in GPIbβ (Fig. 1). Each of these mutants was co-transfected with GPIbα and GPIX cDNAs into CHO cells, and stable cell lines expressing these GPIb-IX mutants were established. To determine whether the above mentioned mutations abolished Ser166 phosphorylation in GPIb-IX, and to investigate the phosphorylation of Ser166 in regulating GPIb-IX function, an anti-peptide antibody was developed using a synthetic peptide corresponding to the RAAARL(pS)LTDPLV sequence of the cytoplasmic domain of GPIbβ with Ser166 phosphorylated. This antibody (anti-GPIbβ-P) reacted specifically with the phosphorylated peptide RAAARL(pS)LTDPLV but did not react with the corresponding non-phosphorylated peptide RAAARLSLTDPLV (Fig.2 A), indicating the anti-GPIbβ-P antibody recognizes the GPIbβ cytoplasmic domain sequence only when Ser166 is phosphorylated. To examine whether anti-GPIbβ-P specifically recognizes phosphorylated GPIbβ in platelets, platelets were solubilized and immunoblotted with anti-GPIbβ-P. Anti-GPIbβ-P antibody specifically reacted with a protein of molecular mass, 24 kDa, corresponding to GPIbβ (Fig. 2 B), which is also immunoblotted by a previously characterized antibody specific for the C-terminal domain of GPIbβ (anti-IbβC) (14Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Google Scholar). Furthermore, preincubation of platelets with a specific PKA inhibitor, PKI, dramatically inhibited the reactivity of anti-GPIbβ-P with GPIbβ. In contrast, treatment of platelets with the PKA activator, forskolin, enhanced the binding of anti-GPIbβ-P to GPIbβ (Fig. 2 B). These results demonstrate that anti-GPIbβ-P specifically recognizes GPIbβ only when Ser166 is phosphorylated. To determine whether GPIbβ expressed in CHO cells was phosphorylated, and whether the above described mutants of GPIb-IX are phosphorylation-deficient, the lysates from wild type and mutant GPIb-IX-expressing cells were immunoblotted with anti-GPIbβ-P. Fig 2 C shows that anti-GPIbβ-P reacted with the wild type GPIbβ expressed in 1b9 cells but failed to react with GPIbβ from the S166A or Δ165 mutant cells. Thus, wild type GPIbβ expressed in CHO cells is phosphorylated at Ser166, but the S166A and the Δ165 mutants are phosphorylation-deficient at Ser166. These data also further demonstrate that anti-GPIbβ-P antibody is specific for phosphorylated Ser166. To examine whether phosphorylation at Ser166 of GPIbβ plays a role in regulating the VWF-binding function of GPIb-IX, cells expressing wild type GPIb-IX (1b9) and the S166A mutant were incubated with increasing concentrations of soluble human VWF in the presence of ristocetin, a modulator that induces VWF binding to GPIb-IX. The S166A mutant demonstrated significantly increased VWF binding compared with 1b9 cells (Fig. 3 A). This increased VWF binding to the S166A mutant was not caused by differences in GPIb-IX expression level, as the expression levels of the two cell lines were comparable (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, the VWF binding data shown in Fig. 3 A was corrected relative to the ratio of the expression levels between the two cell lines. Thus, the mutant S166A showed an increased VWF-binding function. We also examined VWF binding to cells expressing the Δ165 mutant (Δ165). The Δ165 mutant, lacking the C-terminal cytoplasmic residues 166–181 of GPIbβ, also showed an increase in ristocetin-induced VWF binding in a manner that is similar to the S166A mutant (Fig.4). Thus, disruption of Ser166 phosphorylation in GPIbβ or deletion of the phosphorylation site of GPIbβ enhanced the VWF-binding function of GPIb-IX.Figure 4VWF-binding to Δ165 mutant of GPIb-IX. CHO cells expressing wild type GPIb-IX (1b9) and mutant Δ165 (lacking residues 166–181) were incubated with 35 μg/ml of human VWF in the presence of 1.25 mg/ml ristocetin or with ristocetin alone. VWF binding was detected with the FITC-labeled anti-VWF monoclonal antibody, SZ29, and analyzed by flow cytometry. The cells were also analyzed for surface expression of GPIb-IX using an anti-GPIbα (SZ2) monoclonal antibody followed by a FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry. The fluorescence intensity (geomean) of VWF binding was corrected for the ratio of the GPIb-IX expression levels between the two cell lines (1b9/Δ165 = 1/1.37). Shown in the figure are the results from 3 separate experiments (mean ± S.D.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In platelets, GPIbβ is phosphorylated by PKA (20Fox J.E. Reynolds C.C. Johnson M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12627-12631Google Scholar, 21Wardell M.R. Reynolds C.C. Berndt M.C. Wallace R.W. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15656-15661Google Scholar). To determine whether PKA in CHO cells is also responsible for phosphorylation of GPIbβ and the negative regulation of VWF-binding function, we examined the effects of a specific PKA inhibitor, PKI, on GPIbβ phosphorylation and on VWF-binding function of GPIb-IX in CHO cells expressing wild type GPIb-IX (1b9). Fig.5 A shows that the phosphorylation level of wild type GPIbβ is reduced by PKI treatment. Coincident with the reduced GPIbβ phosphorylation, VWF binding to 1b9 cells was enhanced by PKI treatment (Fig. 5 B), in a manner similar to the increased VWF binding in the S116A mutant lacking the PKA-phosphorylation site of GPIbβ (Fig. 5 C). The increased VWF binding to the S166A mutant, however, was not inhibited by the PKA activator forskolin (Fig. 5 C). Taken together, these data indicate that VWF-binding function of GPIb-IX is negatively regulated by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of GPIbβ in this CHO cell model. GPIb-IX binding to VWF mediates transient adhesion (or rolling) of platelets on subendothelial-bound VWF under flow conditions. We therefore examined whether the Δ165 and S166A mutants of GPIb-IX also affect GPIb-IX-dependent cell adhesion to VWF under flow conditions. As controls, we also examined adhesion of these cell lines to BSA-coated surfaces. No cells from the mutant GPIb-IX-expressing cell lines or from the wild type GPIb-IX cell line adhered to BSA-coated surface at shear rates above 1080 s−1. As reported previously, wild type GPIb-IX-expressing cells adhered poorly on a VWF-coated surface. At a shear rate of 1080 s−1 or higher, no 1b9 cells were seen to roll on the VWF-coated surface (Fig. 6). In contrast, both the S166A and Δ165 mutant cells showed transient adhesion on the VWF-coated surface (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the truncation mutant Δ165 showed a greater increase in adhesion compared with the S166A mutant at 1080 s−1 shear rate. Although the reason for this difference remains to be investigated, it may be relevant that the Δ165 mutant not only lacks the phosphorylation site at Ser166 but also lacks the entire C-terminal domain containing the reported 14-3-3 binding site in GPIbβ. Thus, phosphorylation at Ser166 of GPIbβ negatively regulates cell adhesion and rolling on immobilized VWF under flow conditions, and in addition to Ser166 phosphorylation, the C-terminal domain of GPIbβ containing the previously reported 14-3-3 binding site may also be important in negatively regulating GPIb-IX function. We showed above that the VWF-binding function of GPIb-IX is negatively regulated by PKA-dependent GPIb-IX phosphorylation at Ser166in CHO cells. To verify whether PKA also negatively regulates the VWF-binding function of GPIb-IX in platelets, platelets were preincubated with PKI or forskolin and then allowed to bind soluble VWF in the presence of botrocetin. The integrin inhibitor, RGDS, was added to all reactions to exclude any role of integrin αIIbβ3 in VWF binding. Treatment of platelets with PKI significantly increased VWF binding to platelets compared with control untreated platelets (Fig.7 A). This increase was not due to the activation of the integrin αIIbβ3because the platelets were preincubated with the integrin inhibitor,"

We isolated a second candidate for core 1 synthase from a Colo205 cDNA library and named it C1Gal-T2. The deduced amino acid sequence of C1Gal-T2, having 26% homology to C1Gal-T1, showed a topology typical of a type II membrane protein. Real time PCR analysis revealed that the expression of C1Gal-T2 transcripts was widespread in many tissues and of relatively high level in salivary gland, stomach, small intestine, kidney, testis, thymus, and spleen. LSC cells, having no core 1 synthase activity, were transfected stably with theC1Gal-T2 gene. Their microsome fraction showed β1,3-galactosyltransferase activity toward GalNAc-α-para-nitrophenyl and GalNAcα1 peptides resulting in the synthesis of the core 1 structure. The core 1 synthesizing activity of C1Gal-T2 was also determined by flow cytometry and lectin blotting using the LSC cells stably expressing C1Gal-T2. Finally, LSC cells, and Jurkat cells that also lack the core 1 synthase activity, were found to have null alleles of C1Gal-T2.

The GalNAc residue attached to the peptide is usually modified with further glycosylation extended by the action of multiple glycosyltransferases. O-Glycans can be classified into several different groups according to their core structure. There are at least eight such core structures as summarized in our previous paper (1Iwai T. Inaba N. Naundorf A. Zhang Y. Gotoh M. Iwasaki H. Kudo T. Togayachi A. Ishizuka Y. Nakanishi H. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12802-12809Google Scholar). Core 1, Galβ1–3GalNAcα1-serine/threonine, is the major constituent ofO-glycan core structures in many cells. The core 1 structure is also called Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (T antigen) in pathological studies. Core 1 β1,3-galactosyltransferases (C1Gal-T, core 1 synthase, EC 2.4.1.122) transfer a galactose from UDP-Gal to a GalNAc residue on proteins with a β1,3-linkage to synthesize the core 1 structure. It was predicted that there are multiple C1Gal-Ts that differentially recognize the peptide sequences (2Brockhausen I. Moller G. Merz G. Adermann K. Paulsen H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10206-10212Google Scholar, 3Granovsky M. Bielfeldt T. Peters S. Paulsen H. Meldal M. Brockhausen J. Brockhausen I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1039-1046Google Scholar). The T antigen is cryptic because it is covalently or structurally masked by more glycosylation and nonimmunoreactive on the surfaces of healthy cells in most tissues. However, it is exposed and becomes immunoreactive on most human cancer cells and T-cell lymphomas (4Springer G.F. Science. 1984; 224: 1198-1206Google Scholar, 5Springer G.F. Desai P.R. Ghazizadeh M. Tegtmeyer H. Cancer Detect. Prev. 1995; 19: 173-182Google Scholar). Interaction between the T antigen and β-galactoside-binding lectins, such as galectins, has been implicated in tumor cell adhesion and tissue invasion (6Glinsky V.V. Glinsky G.V. Rittenhouse-Olson K.

The sialyl Tn (sTn) antigen is synthesized by the action ofN-acetylgalactosamine, α2,6-sialyltransferase (ST6GalNAc I), which transfers a sialic acid to GalNAc residues on proteins with an α2,6-linkage (8Ikehara Y. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Kudo T. Kono M. Nishihara S. Issiki S. Morozumi K. Itzkowitz S. Tsuda T. Nishimura S.I. Tsuji S. Narimatsu H. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1213-1224Google Scholar). These three antigens of theO-glycan core structure, Tn, T, and sTn, have been defined as cancer-associated antigens in many cancer cells (9Brockhausen I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 67-95Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that the expression of these antigens correlated with the clinicopathological parameters and survival probability of cancer patients (9Brockhausen I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 67-95Google Scholar). IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a common disease characterized by polymeric IgA1 deposits in the renal glomerular mesangium (10Conley M.E. Cooper M.D. Michael A.F.

Many reports confirm that theO-glycans in the IgA1 hinge region of IgAN patients are underglycosylated and have incomplete structures, such as asialo- and/or asialoagalacto-O-glycans (12Iwase H. Tanaka A. Hiki Y. Kokubo T. Ishii-Karakasa I. Kobayashi Y. Hotta K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 92-97Google Scholar, 13Hiki Y. Tanaka A. Kokubo T. Iwase H. Nishikido J. Hotta K. Kobayashi Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 577-582Google Scholar, 14Hiki Y. Kokubo T. Iwase H. Masaki Y. Sano T. Tanaka A. Toma K. Hotta K. Kobayashi Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 760-769Google Scholar). Allen et al. (15Allen A.C. Topham P.S. Harper S.J. Feehally J. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1997; 12: 701-706Google Scholar) reported that the activity of C1Gal-T in homogenates of B cells derived from IgAN patients is down-regulated compared with that of healthy individuals. The idiopathic Tn syndrome, a rare hematological disorder, is characterized by the expression of the Tn antigen on all blood lineage cells (16Berger E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 255-268Google Scholar). The aberrant expression of Tn antigen is caused by an unmasking of T antigen due to down-regulation of C1Gal-T activity. Thus, C1Gal-T(s) are important enzymes that are profoundly involved in human diseases. Recently, a C1Gal-T has been purified from rat liver membranes (17Ju T. Cummings R.D. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 169-177Google Scholar) and its cDNA cloned for the first time (18Ju T. Brewer K. D'Souza A. Cummings R.D. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 178-186Google Scholar). The human, mouse,Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans genes orthologous to the rat C1Gal-T gene have also been cloned (18Ju T. Brewer K. D'Souza A. Cummings R.D. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 178-186Google Scholar). We found an EST sequence that encodes a partial cDNA sequence with significant homology to the C1Gal-T1 sequence. In the present study, we successfully cloned a novel gene encoding a second human core 1 β1,3-galactosyltransferase and named it C1Gal-T2. LSC cells were chosen as host cells to be transfected with the C1Gal-T2gene, because they lack C1Gal-T activity endogenously. We analyzed and characterized C1Gal-T2 using microsome fractions of the LSC cells transfected stably with the C1Gal-T2 gene. We performed a BLAST search of the DDBJ data bases containing human cDNA, EST, and genome sequences, and we identified a cDNA homologous to the amino acid sequence of C1Gal-T1 (18Ju T. Brewer K. D'Souza A. Cummings R.D. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 178-186Google Scholar). A number of cDNAs matching part of the sequence of the expected full-length open reading frame (ORF) were found. The partial cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF155582), which encodes a putative catalytic region of a novel candidate, was amplified by RT-PCR from Colo205 cDNA, using a forward primer 5′-GAAGATCTAGAATGCACCACCATGAGCATC-3′ and a reverse primer 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTCAGTCATTGTCAGAACCATTTG-3′. The amplified fragment was used as a probe for hybridization to isolate a full-length cDNA clone. We screened the λ ZAPII Colo205 cDNA library constructed in our previous study (8Ikehara Y. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Kudo T. Kono M. Nishihara S. Issiki S. Morozumi K. Itzkowitz S. Tsuda T. Nishimura S.I. Tsuji S. Narimatsu H. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1213-1224Google Scholar), and we isolated a clone that we named pBS-C1Gal-T2. The 1471-bp insert was subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The fragment of the ORF encoding C1Gal-T2 was amplified by PCR using pBS-C1Gal-T2 as a template. The PCR was performed with Platinum® Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The forward and reverse primer sequences were flanked with attB1 and attB2 sequences, respectively, to create the recombination sites. The forward primer forC1Gal-T2 gene was 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTAGAAGGAGATAGAACCATGCTTTCTGAAAGCAGCTCC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTCAATCATTGTCA- GAACCAT-3′. The C1Gal-T1 gene was amplified by RT-PCR using Colo205 cDNA as a template. The forward primer forC1Gal-T1 gene was 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTAGAAGGAGAT- AGAACC-ATGGCCTCTAAATCCTGGCTG-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTCAAGGATT- TCCTAACTTCAC-3′. The amplified fragment was inserted between the attP1 andattP2 sites of the pDONRTM201 entry vector, and then the insert was transferred into a pDEST12.2 mammalian expression vector using the GATEWAY system (Invitrogen). The plasmids were named pDEST12.2-C1Gal-T1 and pDEST12.2-C1Gal-T2, respectively. The Jurkat and K562 cell lines were purchased from the ATCC. LSB and LSC cells were kindly provided by Dr. Itzkowitz in our previous study (8Ikehara Y. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Kudo T. Kono M. Nishihara S. Issiki S. Morozumi K. Itzkowitz S. Tsuda T. Nishimura S.I. Tsuji S. Narimatsu H. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1213-1224Google Scholar). LSC cells, a human colorectal cancer cell line, were transfected with pDEST12.2-C1Gal-T1 or pDEST12.2-C1Gal-T2 expression plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The cells were selected in the presence of geneticin (0.6 mg/ml) (Invitrogen) in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. After 3 weeks of exposure to geneticin, the cells stably expressing C1Gal-T1 or C1Gal-T2 were subjected to several different assays. For flow cytometry, the cells were incubated with each monoclonal antibody (mAb) or lectin. The anti-Tn mAb, HB T1 (IgM), and anti-sTn mAb, HB STn1 (IgG1), were both purchased from Dako (Kyoto, Japan), whereas fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated peanut agglutinin (PNA) lectin was from EY Laboratories. After incubation with the first antibody, the cells were stained with FITC-conjugated goat anti-moue IgG or IgM (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and then subjected to flow cytometric analysis with a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Galactosyltransferase (Gal-T) activity was assayed in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 14 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), 12.5 mm MgCl2, 250 μmUDP-Gal (Sigma), 175 nCi of UDP-[14C]Gal (AmershamBiosciences), 10 nmol of GalNAc-α-pNp or GalNAc-β-pNp (Calbiochem), and the enzyme source. Cell homogenates were used as an enzyme source for the HPTLC assay. The cells were solubilized in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 154 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100 by brief sonication. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the reaction was terminated by adding 200 μl of water. The enzyme product, [14C]Gal-GalNAc-pNp, was separated from free UDP-[14C]Gal using a Sep-Pak Plus C18cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA) and subjected to HPTLC analysis as described in detail previously (1Iwai T. Inaba N. Naundorf A. Zhang Y. Gotoh M. Iwasaki H. Kudo T. Togayachi A. Ishizuka Y. Nakanishi H. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12802-12809Google Scholar). GalNAc-α-pNp (0.25 mm) was incubated in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mmMES buffer (pH 6.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm UDP-Gal, and cell homogenates. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the supernatant of the reaction mixture was filtrated with Ultrafree-MC (0.22 μm, Millipore Corp.) and then subjected to HPLC on an OSD-80Ts QA column (4.6 × 250 mm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). The reaction products were eluted with 12% acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 40 °C and monitored with an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (absorbance at 210 nm), SPD-10AVP (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The cells were harvested and suspended in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 0.25m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 100 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Suspensions containing 1 × 108 cells were homogenized by a Dounce homogenizer. The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 10 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h. Microsome fractions thus obtained in the pellet were resuspended in 0.25m sucrose and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and used as an enzyme source. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. An acceptor peptide of the human IgA1 hinge region having a GalNAc residue at the 11th serine (11-GalNAc-HP; VPSTPPTPSPS(-GalNAc)TPPTPSPS) was purchased from the Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). 11-GalNAc-HP was labeled with Cy5 according to the supplier's manual (AmershamBiosciences). The Cy5-labeled 11-GalNAc-HP was separated by HPLC (CAPCELL PAK C18 UG120 column (SHISEIDO, Tokyo, Japan), 4.6 × 150 mm, 1.0 ml/min, gradient 15–30% acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, detection excitation at 492 nm and emission at 670 nm). A FITC-labeled GalNAc-Muc1a′ peptide (AHGVT(-GalNAc) SAPDTR) was prepared enzymatically as described in detail previously (1Iwai T. Inaba N. Naundorf A. Zhang Y. Gotoh M. Iwasaki H. Kudo T. Togayachi A. Ishizuka Y. Nakanishi H. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12802-12809Google Scholar). Recombinant β1,3-galactosidase from Bacillus circulans, which specifically digests Galβ1–3GalNAc-linkage (19Fujimoto H. Miyasato M. Ito Y. Sasaki T. Ajisaka K. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 155-160Google Scholar), was a gift from Dr. Ajisaka of Meiji Dairies Co. (Tokyo, Japan). β1,3-Galactosidase digestion of galactosylated GalNAc peptides was carried out in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 5 milliunits of recombinant β1,3-galactosidase. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, each digested product was filtrated with Ultrafree-MC and separated by HPLC. Cell pellets were solubilized in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 154 mmNaCl, and 1% Triton X-100 by brief sonication. Protein separated on SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gel was transferred to a Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences) in a Transblot SD cell (Bio-Rad). The membrane was immersed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with 10 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated PNA lectin (EY Laboratories). The membrane was stained according to the of Konica Immunostain HRP-1000 (Konica, Tokyo, Japan). Complementary DNAs were synthesized with an oligo(dT) primer from total cellular RNA using SuperscriptTM Preamplification Systems for First Strand cDNA Synthesis (Invitrogen). PCR products of the full-length ORF ofC1Gal-T1 and C1Gal-T2 amplified from various cell line cDNAs were analyzed by direct sequencing. The primer set used for amplification and sequencing of C1Gal-T1 cDNA was as follows: the forward primer was 5′-AGAAATACACTTTCGGGAA-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-TGCAGTGCTAGACATATTAC-3′. The primer set for the amplification and sequencing of C1Gal-T2 cDNA was as follows: the forward primer was 5′-GCTTTCCTGTCCCCAAGCCGTTC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GCCCCACAGATTTCTAATGTTC-3′. Additional primers for the sequencing of C1Gal-T1 cDNA were 5′-AGAAGCCTTGAAAAGATTTGTTGATG-3′ and 5′-ATTACCTTTGTTCATTCATGATTTTCT-3′. Additional primers for the sequencing of C1Gal-T2 cDNA were 5′- TCATTCAGTCATTGTCAGAACC-3′ and 5′-TTGCACGCCCCACTACGTTTGC-3′. We employed the real time PCR method for the measurement of C1Gal-T1 and C1Gal-T2 transcripts, as described in detail previously (1Iwai T. Inaba N. Naundorf A. Zhang Y. Gotoh M. Iwasaki H. Kudo T. Togayachi A. Ishizuka Y. Nakanishi H. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12802-12809Google Scholar). Marathon ReadyTMcDNAs derived from various human tissues and cells were purchased from BD Biosciences, Clontech. Standard curves forC1Gal-T1, C1Gal-T2, and an endogenous control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNAs, were generated by serial dilutions of a pDEST12.2 vector containing theC1Gal-T1 or C1Gal-T2 cDNA and a pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) containing the GAPDH cDNA. The primer set and probe for C1Gal-T1 were as follows: the forward primer was 5′-CCTAGAACGTTTTGGTACTGGAATTAC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-ACATAGTGAAAAGAAACTGCAAGATCA-3′; the probe was 5′-CTCCTGTAGAGGGTCCTGGTTGCTGCT-3′ with a minor groove binder (20Kutyavin I.V. Afonina I.A. Mills A. Gorn V.V. Lukhtanov E.A. Belousov E.S. Singer M.J. Walburger D.K. Lokhov S.G. Gall A.A. Dempcy R. Reed M.W. Meyer R.B. Hedgpeth J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 655-661Google Scholar). The primer set and probe for C1Gal-T2 were as follows: the forward primer was 5′-GTTTGCCTGAAATATGCTGGAGTAT-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-CAACAGCCTTCTACTACCTGGTTG-3′; the probe was 5′-CAGAAAATGCAGAAGATGCTGATGGAAAAGATGTA-3′ with a minor groove binder. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” we cloned a novel candidate cDNA for C1Gal-T which has a 1,471-bp insert and encodes a full-length ORF. This cDNA clone, named C1Gal-T2, consisted of a 104-bp 5′-untranslated region (UTR), a 957-bp coding region, and a 410-bp 3′-UTR that did not contain a poly(A) tail (Fig.1 A). A hydropathy profile of the putative amino acid sequence based on Kyte and Doolittle hydrophobicity plots indicates the ORF encodes a typical type II membrane protein, which is consistent with the topology of other glycosyltransferases, with a cytoplasmic tail of 10 amino acids, a transmembrane domain of 20 amino acids, and a large catalytic portion of 288 amino acids (Fig. 1 A). The cDNA sequence of C1Gal-T2 was compared with a draft genome sequence. The same sequence was found in a clone, GenBankTMaccession number AC011890, which is localized on chromosome X at q23. This is the first glycosyltransferase gene to be found on the sex chromosomes. The genomic structure of the C1Gal-T2 gene was determined (Fig. 1 B). The C1Gal-T2 gene contains at least two exons, and the ORF was found to be encoded by a single exon. Exon 2 started 5 bp upstream from A in the ATG start codon, and the intron sequences at the intron-exon junctions complied with the acceptor and donor site sequences of the splicing rule, i.e.GT-AG rule. The amino acid sequence in a putative catalytic region, 288 residues from the C-terminal end of C1Gal-T2, showed only 26% homology to that of human C1Gal-T1; however, all 7 cysteines were conserved in both amino acid sequences (Fig. 2). In a previous study (17Ju T. Cummings R.D. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 169-177Google Scholar, 18Ju T. Brewer K. D'Souza A. Cummings R.D. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 178-186Google Scholar), four motifs that were found by a comparison of C1Gal-T1 with other β3Gal-Ts were proposed. However, the four were not highly conserved between C1Gal-T1 and -T2 (Fig. 2). A possible divalent cation-binding site, the DXD motif, was found at two positions in each C1Gal-T, but the position was not aligned in the two enzymes. LSB and LSC are clonal cell lines, both of which have been derived from LS174T human colonic cancer cells. In a previous study (21Brockhausen I. Yang J. Dickinson N. Ogata S. Itzkowitz S.H. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 595-603Google Scholar), it was demonstrated that LSC cells express only the truncated carbohydrate antigen Tn (GalNAc α1-Ser/Thr) and sTn on their mucin molecules because of a lack of C1Gal-T activity, whereas LSB cells, having C1Gal-T activity, express elongated oligosaccharide chains. We chose LSC cells as host cells to be transfected with theC1Gal-T2 gene. LSC cells stably expressing C1Gal-T1 or C1Gal-T2 were established as described under “Experimental Procedures” and named LSC-C1Gal-T1 or LSC-C1Gal-T2 cells, respectively. Concurrently, mock LSC transfectant cells were prepared and named LSC-mock cells. The galactose transfer activity of the cell homogenates of seven cell lines, i.e. LSB, LSC, LSC-mock, LSC-C1Gal-T1, LSC-C1Gal-T2, K562, and Jurkat, toward GalNAc-α-pNp and GalNAc-β-pNp was analyzed using the HPTLC assay. As seen in Fig.3 A, the homogenates of LSB, as a positive control, showed a positive band toward GalNAc-α-pNp. K562 gave the same positive band as LSB, but Jurkat, LSC, LSC-mock, and LSC-C1Gal-T1 did not. The homogenates of LSC-C1Gal-T2 cells exhibited significant Gal-T activity toward GalNAc-α-pNp, almost equal to that of LSB cells. However, none of the seven cell homogenates exhibited activity toward GalNAc-β-pNp (data not shown). The transcript levels for the two enzymes in the cells were determined by real time PCR. In LSB, LSC, and LSC-mock cells, both transcripts, C1Gal-T1 and -T2, were expressed almost at the same level. The expression of C1Gal-T1 transcript in LSC-C1Gal-T1 cells was increased to ∼2–3 times that of LSB and LSC cells. LSC-C1Gal-T2 cells expressed ∼1.5 times and twice as much C1Gal-T2 transcript as LSB and LSC cells, respectively. The expression level of C1Gal-T2 in the stable transfectant, LSC-C1Gal-T2, was in the physiological range, and there was no overexpression. Two leukemia cell lines, K562 and Jurkat cells, expressed both transcripts at relatively higher levels than LSB and LSC cells. The enzyme reaction was carried out to measure the relative β3Gal-T activity toward GalNAc-α-pNp using equal amounts of homogenates of LSC-C1Gal-T1 and LSC-C1Gal-T2 cells. The reaction products were subjected to HPLC analysis because the HPLC analysis could detect the products more sensitively than HPTLC analysis. A commercially available compound, Galβ1–3GalNAc-α-pNp (core 1-pNp), was used as the standard to estimate the β3-linkage structure (Fig.4 A). The peaks of both enzyme products shifted from the original substrate peak to the position of core 1-pNp (Fig. 4, B and C). Although LSC-C1Gal-T1 showed β3Gal-T activity, its relative activity was only 2% that of LSC-C1Gal-T2. This result demonstrated that C1Gal-T2 expressed in LSC cells exhibits 50 times stronger core 1 synthesizing activity toward GalNAc-α-pNp than C1Gal-T1. The peptides having a GalNAc residue, 11-GalNAc-HP-Cy5 and GalNAc-Muc1a′-FITC, were used as acceptor substrates for the assay of core 1 synthesizing activity. The cell homogenates were inappropriate for this assay, because they contained proteases that degraded the acceptor peptides. Therefore, microsome fractions were separated from the cells and used as an enzyme source to avoid degradation of the acceptor peptides. Representative HPLC profiles of reaction products of C1Gal-T2 are shown in Fig. 5. The retention time of the substrates (peak “S” in Fig. 5), 11-GalNAc-HP-Cy5 and GalNAc-Muc1a′-FITC, was 30.9 and 18.9 min, respectively. As seen in Fig. 5, A and D, the LSC-mock cells produced reaction products with neither 11-GalNAc-HP-Cy5 nor GalNAc-Muc1a′-FITC. LSC-C1Gal-T2 produced a reaction product, as indicated by “P” in Fig. 5, B and E, in the presence of each substrate, 11-GalNAc-HP-Cy5 or GalNAc-Muc1a′-FITC, with a shorter retention time, 29.9 or 18.3 min, respectively. Each reaction product in Fig. 5, B and E, was isolated and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass analysis (data not shown). They were confirmed to be mono-galactosylated GalNAc peptides. The microsome fractions of LSB produced a reaction product in the presence of both substrates that had the same retention time as did the reaction product of LSC-C1Gal-T2 (data not shown). Digestion of the reaction products with a β1,3-linkage-specific galactosidase from B. circulans resulted in the disappearance of P and a shift back to the original position of the substrate. This strongly indicated that C1Gal-T2 transferred Gal to GalNAc with a β1,3-linkage to synthesize the core 1 structure on the peptides (Fig. 5, C and F). LSC-mock, LSC-C1Gal-T1, and C1Ga-T2 cells were stained with PNA lectin, HB-STn1 (anti-sTn), and HB-T1 (anti-Tn) antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 6). LSC-mock cells showed positive profiles for both sTn and Tn antigens but were not recognized by PNA lectin. LSC-C1Gal-T1 cells showed same profiles as LSC-mock cells (data not shown). LSC-C1Gal-T2 cells apparently showed positive staining with PNA lectin compared with the negative staining of LSC-mock cells (Fig. 6 A). LSC-C1Gal-T2 cells showed significantly less reactivity against sTn and Tn antibodies than LSC-mock cells (Fig. 6, B and C). These results strongly indicated the following points. 1) C1Gal-T2 synthesized the core 1 structure which is recognized by PNA lectin. 2) C1Gal-T2 competed with the synthesis of sTn directed by ST6GalNAc(s) to decrease the expression of sTn antigen. 3) Tn antigen was masked by the addition of Gal to GalNAc through the core 1 synthesizing activity of C1Gal-T2. PNA lectin blot analysis was performed to identify the molecular sizes of proteins carrying the core 1 structure. As seen in Fig.7, the homogenates of three cells, LSB, LSC, and LSC-C1Gal-T2, were stained with PNA. LSB cells showed positive staining of smear bands in a range of higher molecular masses, above 100 kDa, in addition to the three discrete bands that were shared by the three cell homogenates. The smear bands of higher molecular weight, probably mucins carrying the core 1 structure, were also detected in LSC-C1Gal-T2 cells but not in LSC cells. Thus, transfection of the C1Gal-T2 gene into LSC cells yielded the PNA-reactive epitope, core 1 epitope, on mucin-like molecules, which are similar to the molecules detected in LSB cells. LSC and Jurkat cells have been reported to lack C1Gal-T activity and to express Tn antigen because of the exposure of GalNAc residues on peptides (21Brockhausen I. Yang J. Dickinson N. Ogata S. Itzkowitz S.H. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 595-603Google Scholar, 22Piller V. Piller F. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9264-9271Google Scholar). Neither cell exhibited C1Gal-T activity toward GalNAc-α-pNp, whereas LSB and K562 cells exhibited the activity, as demonstrated in the previous section of this study (Fig. 3). Complementary DNAs encoding C1Gal-T1 or -T2 were amplified by RT-PCR from K562, LSB, LSC, and Jurkat cells and were directly sequenced. As summarized in Fig.8, the cDNA sequences of C1Gal-T1 from the four cell lines, LSB, LSC, K562, and Jurkat cells, were determined to be identical to the C1Gal-T1 sequence registered by others (18Ju T. Brewer K. D'Souza A. Cummings R.D. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 178-186Google Scholar). The cDNA sequence of C1Gal-T2 from LSB and K562 cells was identical to that of Colo205 cells which was demonstrated to encode an active enzyme in this study. Interestingly, the cDNA sequence of"

Previously, we reported that protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) phosphorylates and interacts with Stat3 in an interleukin (IL)-6-dependent manner. In this study, we further characterized this interaction, and investigated the potential role of such an interaction. We show here that the catalytic domain of PKCδ interacts with the Src homology 2 domain and part of the adjacent C-terminal transactivation domain of Stat3. This interaction, which does not seem to involve a classical phosphotyrosine SH2-mediated binding, however, significantly enhances the interaction of Stat3 and the IL-6 receptor subunit glycoprotein (gp) 130, which is the initial step for Stat3 activation by IL-6. Expression of a dominant negative PKCδ or depletion of the endogenous PKCδ by phorbol 12-myristate 3-acetate treatment abrogates the association of Stat3 with gp130. At the same time, PKCδ is recruited to gp130 via association with Stat3, which may facilitate its phosphorylation on the gp130 receptor. Finally, we identified Thr-890, a putative PKC phosphorylation site on gp130, to be critical for the effect of PKCδ. Our data indicate that PKCδ plays important regulatory roles in IL-6 signaling.

This family of cytokines consists of IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ciliary neurotrophic factor, oncostatin M (OSM), cardiotrophin (CT-1), and neurotrophin-1/B-cell stimulatory factor-3/cardiotrophin-like cytokine (NNT-1/BSF3/CLC), which share glycoprotein (gp) 130 as a common receptor for signal transduction. Binding of the IL-6 family cytokines to their specific receptor subunits leads to homodimerization of gp130 or heterodimerization of gp130 with gp130-related receptors including LIF-receptor β, OSM receptor α, or CT-1 receptor α, which results in the activation of the gp130-associated Janus kinases (JAKs) (3Heinrich P.C.

JAKs subsequently phosphorylate six tyrosine residues located in the cytoplasmic region of gp130 that serve as docking sites for signaling molecules containing the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. The second membrane-proximal tyrosine residue of gp130 (Tyr-756) is required for recruitment of the SH2-containing phosphatase-2 leading to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, whereas any of the four most distal tyrosine residues residing within a YXXQ motif can be used for the Stat3 binding (6Stahl N.

Stat3 was cloned as an acute-phase response factor activated by IL-6 in mouse liver and has been identified to be a major molecule for IL-6 signaling (9Akira S. Nishio Y. Inoue M. Wang X.J. Wei S.

Upon IL-6 stimulation, Stat3 is transiently associated with gp130 via its SH2 domain and is subsequently phosphorylated by JAKs on the tyrosine residue 705 at its C terminus. Phosphorylated Stat3 forms dimers via reciprocal interactions between the SH2 domain and the phosphorylated Tyr-705, enabling it to translocate to the nucleus where it binds to IL-6 response elements in the regulatory region of many acute-phase protein genes, thereby regulating their expression (6Stahl N.

In addition to the Tyr phosphorylation, a serine phosphorylation on Ser-727 has been shown to enhance Stat3 transcriptional activity (12Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). Upon exposure to different stimuli, various serine/threonine kinases have been shown to mediate Ser-727 phosphorylation of Stat3. The MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and its upstream kinase MAPK/Erk kinase kinase-1 (MEKK-1) have been demonstrated to be responsible for the Ser phosphorylation of Stat3 upon epidermal growth factor (EGF) and/or stress such as UV radiation (13Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 14Lim C.P. Cao X. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 21004-21011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the case of IL-6 induction, we have shown that protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) phosphorylates Ser-727 of Stat3 (16Jain N. Zhang T. Kee W.H. Li W. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24392-24400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar).PKCδ is a member of a heterogeneous multifamily of lipid-regulated serine/threonine kinases. The PKC isoenzymes are classified into four groups according to their activator/cofactor requirements. The conventional PKCs (cPKCs: α, β, and γ) require both Ca2+ and diacylglycerol or phorbol esters such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) as cofactors. Novel PKCs (δ, ε, θ, and η) can be stimulated by diacylglycerol or PMA alone, independently of Ca2+, and atypical PKCs (ι, λ, and ζ) and PKC-related kinases (PKCμ/PKD) are independent of both stimuli, and the latter is even structurally different, containing a pleckstrin homology domain (reviewed in Ref. 17Ron D. Kazanietz M.G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1658-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Activated PKCδ was found to be associated with the p60 tumor necrosis factor receptor (18Kilpatrick L.E. Song Y.H. Rossi M.W. Korchak H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C2011-C2018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the insulin receptor (19Braiman L. Alt A. Kuroki T. Ohba M. Bak A. Tennenbaum T. Sampson S.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 565-574PubMed Google Scholar), and the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (20Li W. Jiang Y.X. Zhang J. Soon L. Flechner L. Kapoor V. Pierce J.H. Wang L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5888-5898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), playing important roles in downstream signaling, for instance by down-regulation of surface receptor expression or by mediating receptor redistribution (18Kilpatrick L.E. Song Y.H. Rossi M.W. Korchak H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C2011-C2018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Braiman L. Alt A. Kuroki T. Ohba M. Bak A. Tennenbaum T. Sampson S.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 565-574PubMed Google Scholar).Previously, we have shown that PKCδ not only phosphorylates Stat3 on Ser-727 but also specifically associates with Stat3 in an IL-6-inducible manner in HepG2 cells (16Jain N. Zhang T. Kee W.H. Li W. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24392-24400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To understand further the regulatory role of PKCδ on Stat3, we characterized the interaction of these two proteins. We demonstrate that the catalytic domain of PKCδ interacts with the C-terminal portion of Stat3 including the SH2 domain and the adjacent 27 amino acids of the transactivation domain. The interaction of PKCδ and Stat3 not only strongly enhances Stat3 binding to the IL-6 receptor gp130 but also leads to an association of PKCδ and gp130. Stat3-gp130 interaction is abrogated by a dominant negative mutant of PKCδ or by depletion of PKCδ. Furthermore, PKCδ phosphorylates gp130 in vitro. These data suggest that PKCδ plays important regulatory roles in IL-6 signaling.DISCUSSIONStat3 plays important roles in regulating a multitude of different processes initiated by a variety of extracellular ligands including those of the IL-6 cytokine family and growth factors such as EGF. Its transcriptional activity is regulated by the tyrosine phosphorylation on Tyr-705, as well as an additional phosphorylation on Ser-727. We have previously shown PKCδ as a Ser/Thr kinase responsible for the Ser-727 phosphorylation of Stat3 upon stimulation with IL-6 (16Jain N. Zhang T. Kee W.H. Li W. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24392-24400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, another study found that PKCδ is activated downstream of Rac1 and SEK1/MKK4 to regulate Stat3 phosphorylation on Ser-727 (44Schuringa J.J. Dekker L.V. Vellenga E. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27709-27715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, Uddin et al. (45Uddin S. Sassano A. Deb D.K. Verma A. Majchrzak B. Rahman A. Malik A.B. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14408-14416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) recently described PKCδ as the serine kinase for Stat1 Ser-727 phosphorylation, and also as an interacting protein of Stat1 in an interferon α-inducible manner. These data suggest that PKCδ might play a more widespread role as a Ser/Thr kinase for Stat proteins.In addition to the phosphorylation, we previously observed an interaction between the endogenous Stat3 and PKCδ induced by IL-6, OSM, and LIF, implying that the interaction has physiological effects on the IL-6 family. We therefore further characterized this interaction. Because the interaction is inducible by IL-6, and the time course of the interaction coincides with the kinetics of Stat3 Tyr-705 phosphorylation, we initially postulated that the interaction might depend on the Stat3 Tyr-705 phosphorylation. However, mutation on Tyr-705, as well as on Ser-727, had little effect on PKCδ binding (data not shown). We then delineated the interacting regions in both proteins. We identified that the catalytic domain of PKCδ binds to the SH2 domain of Stat3 (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). The phosphotyrosine residues of PKCδ (Tyr-55, Tyr-155, and Tyr-187), which are reported to be phosphorylated by cytokine or growth factor stimulation, are located outside the catalytic domain and are unlikely to be involved in the interaction with the Stat3 SH2 domain. On the other hand, there are also tyrosine residues that can be phosphorylated in the catalytic domain of PKCδ, but so far only oxidative stress (H2O2) has been shown to induce their phosphorylations (46Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation on the key residue Arg-609 of the SH2 pocket has little or no effect on PKCδ association (Fig.2). Hence, these data suggest that the interaction of Stat3 and PKCδ may not be mediated by a typical interaction between SH2 domain and phosphotyrosine. In agreement with these data, it also has been demonstrated on several occasions that SH2 domains specifically bind to proteins in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner. For example, the binding region of the SH2 domain-interacting proteins in some cases contains phosphoserine or phosphothreonine instead (47Schmandt R. Liu S.K. McGlade C.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1867-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 48Park I. Chung J. Walsh C.T. Yun Y. Strominger J.L. Shin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1991; 66: 161-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). PKCδ has been found to have three Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites in its C terminus including Thr-505 (possibly being phosphorylated by an upstream kinase), Ser-643, and Ser-662, which are autophosphorylated to contribute to the full activity of the enzyme (50Li W. Zhang J. Bottaro D.P. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24550-24555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 51Parekh D. Ziegler W. Yonezawa K. Hara K. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34758-34764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Because we detected constitutive phosphorylation on Ser-643 and Thr-505 after overexpressing PKCδ (data not shown), these phosphorylations might contribute to the binding of PKCδ V5 domain to the SH2 domain of Stat3.Stat proteins are recruited to the cytokine receptors via their SH2 domain (6Stahl N. Farruggella T. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). In agreement with our data described above, we found that instead of competing with Stat3 binding to the IL-6 receptor subunit, gp130, PKCδ significantly enhanced Stat3-gp130 interaction in heterogeneous systems (Fig. 4). Although the mechanism of this effect is not clear, a few possibilities can be considered. For instance, binding of PKCδ might induce a conformational change in Stat3, which enhances the affinity of Stat3 binding to gp130. We recently reported that the binding of Stat3 to the receptor gp130 is regulated by an intramolecular interaction in which the coiled-coil domain of Stat3 interacts with its flexible C-terminal domain and thus retains Stat3 in a conformation with an accessible SH2 domain for receptor binding (24Zhang T. Seow K.T. Ong C.T. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17556-17563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the SH2 domain of Stat3 is known to be among the most divergent SH2 domains in amino acid sequence (52Kuriyan J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nature. 1999; 398 (25): 22-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In contrast to the SH2 domains of other SH2-containing proteins such as Src family kinases, which can bind to their phosphotyrosyl peptides on their own, the SH2 domain alone of Stat3 is not sufficient for receptor binding (23Zhang T. Kee W.H. Seow K.T. Fung W. Cao X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7132-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is also possible that PKCδ stabilizes the intramolecular interaction of Stat3 to promote its receptor binding. Alternatively, since the interaction between endogenous Stat3 and PKCδ is inducible by IL-6, PKCδ may stabilize Stat3-gp130 interaction at the receptor level.Our data also demonstrate that PKCδ is recruited to the gp130 receptor via Stat3. What are the possible physiological consequences for this association? First, PKCδ binding to Stat3 stabilizes the interaction between Stat3 and gp130, which may facilitate Stat3 Tyr phosphorylation to occur by JAKs pre-associated with the box 1 region of gp130. Second, PKCδ binding to gp130 may be required for the Ser phosphorylation of Stat3. We have mapped the binding site of PKCδ on Stat3 within aa 600–720, which is located immediately upstream of Ser-727, the phosphorylation site for PKCδ. Furthermore, Stat3 interacts with the substrate binding site of PKCδ, suggesting that Stat3 is a bona fide substrate for PKCδ. Abe and colleagues (53Abe K. Hirai M. Mizuno K. Higashi N. Sekimoto T. Miki T. Hirano T. Nakajima K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3464-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) recently have also mapped the C-terminal portion (aa 533–711) of Stat3 as the required binding region for an H7-dependent kinase which overlaps the binding site (aa 600–715) that we have mapped in this study, although they could not show the interaction of Stat3 and PKCδ. Interestingly, they indicate that the YXXQ motif in gp130 is not only important for Stat3 binding and its subsequent Tyr phosphorylation but also crucial for the Ser-727 phosphorylation of Stat3 by an unknown mechanism. Our findings reveal that PKCδ associates with gp130 at the YXXQ motif via Stat3, suggesting that this association is necessary for Stat3 Ser phosphorylation by PKCδ in response to IL-6 stimulation, which may provide an explanation for this requirement. Third, PKCδ may phosphorylate and therefore regulate gp130 receptor activity and/or the signaling molecules that are associated with gp130. It has been demonstrated in many instances that transmembrane receptors are regulated in various aspects, such as endocytosis, down-regulation, stabilization, tyrosine kinase activity, or degradation, by means of a Ser/Thr phosphorylation within their cytoplasmic domain (54Dittrich E.

Wicks S.J. Taverner C.J. Chantry A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16168-16173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), PKCs, and more specifically PKCδ, have been shown to be the kinase in several cases (18Kilpatrick L.E. Song Y.H. Rossi M.W. Korchak H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C2011-C2018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Bao J. Alroy I. Waterman H. Schejter E.D. Brodie C. Gruenberg J. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26178-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In our experiments, we detected the phosphorylation of gp130 by PKCδin vitro (Fig. 8 A), but the receptor turnover does not seem to be affected nor can we detect significant changes in the activity of JAK1 (data not shown). Interestingly, we have identified a putative PKC phosphorylation site (Thr-890) on gp130 that is necessary for the PKCδ effect on the Stat3-gp130 interaction. However, whether Thr-890 is phosphorylated by PKCδ in vivo, and the mechanism for this requirement remain to be determined.In summary, our data suggest that there is an effect of PKCδ not only as a Ser/Thr kinase phosphorylating Stat3 but also enhancing the binding of Stat3 to the receptor. This binding of Stat3 to the receptor subunit at the same time facilitates PKCδ function by bringing the kinase into close proximity with the gp130 receptor subunit that further regulates gp130-mediated signaling. It is noteworthy that the complex formation of the endogenous Stat3 and PKCδ is transient in response to IL-6 stimulation (16Jain N. Zhang T. Kee W.H. Li W. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24392-24400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It is possible that PKCδ initially stabilizes Stat3-gp130 interaction to facilitate Tyr and Ser phosphorylation of Stat3, as well as the Thr phosphorylation of gp130. These phosphorylation events may lead to the conformational changes of these proteins and promote the dissociation of this complex to enable the dimer formation and subsequent nuclear translocation of Stat3.

Upon exposure to different stimuli, various serine/threonine kinases have been shown to mediate Ser-727 phosphorylation of Stat3. The MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and its upstream kinase MAPK/Erk kinase kinase-1 (MEKK-1) have been demonstrated to be responsible for the Ser phosphorylation of Stat3 upon epidermal growth factor (EGF) and/or stress such as UV radiation (13Chung J.

In the case of IL-6 induction, we have shown that protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) phosphorylates Ser-727 of Stat3 (16Jain N. Zhang T. Kee W.H. Li W. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24392-24400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). PKCδ is a member of a heterogeneous multifamily of lipid-regulated serine/threonine kinases. The PKC isoenzymes are classified into four groups according to their activator/cofactor requirements. The conventional PKCs (cPKCs: α, β, and γ) require both Ca2+ and diacylglycerol or phorbol esters such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) as cofactors. Novel PKCs (δ, ε, θ, and η) can be stimulated by diacylglycerol or PMA alone"

This effect was shown previously to be due to a dual action of NO, comprising an activation of sphingomyelinases and an inhibition of ceramidase activity. In this study we show that the NO-triggered inhibition of neutral ceramidase activity is paralleled by a down-regulation at the protein level. A complete loss of neutral ceramidase protein is obtained after 24 h of stimulation. Whereas the selective proteasome inhibitor lactacystin blocked NO-evoked ceramidase degradation, several caspase inhibitors were ineffective. Moreover, the NO-induced degradation is reversed by the protein kinase C (PKC) activator, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and also by the physiological PKC activators platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF), angiotensin II and ATP, resulting in a normalization of neutral ceramidase protein as well as activity. In vivophosphorylation studies using 32Pi-labeled mesangial cells revealed that TPA, PDGF, angiotensin II, and ATP trigger an increased phosphorylation of the neutral ceramidase, which is blocked by the broad spectrum PKC inhibitor Ro-31 8220 but not by CGP 41251, which has a preferential action on Ca2+-dependent isoforms, thus suggesting the involvement of a Ca2+-independent PKC isoform. In vitro phosphorylation assays using recombinant PKC isoenzymes and neutral ceramidase immunoprecipitated from unstimulated mesangial cells show that particularly the PKC-δ isoform and to a lesser extent the PKC-α isoform are efficient in directly phosphorylating neutral ceramidase. In summary, our data show that NO is able to induce degradation of neutral ceramidase, thereby promoting accumulation of ceramide in the cell. This effect is reversed by PKC activation, most probably by the PKC-δ isoenzyme, which can directly phosphorylate and thereby prevent neutral ceramidase degradation. These novel regulatory interactions will provide therapeutically valuable information to target neutral ceramidase stability and subsequent ceramide accumulation.

Sphingolipids exert important roles as signaling molecules under various physiological and pathophysiological conditions (1Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Prinetti A. Tettamanti G. Prog.

Particularly ceramide has gained special recognition due to its potential involvement in regulation of programmed cell death, cell growth arrest, and differentiation (1Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R.

The regulatory mechanisms that determine the intracellular ceramide level are still largely unknown. Most studies have focused on the ceramide-generating enzymes,i.e. the acid and neutral sphingomyelinases. However, sphingomyelinases only depict one side of the regulation of ceramide level. Ceramide degradation, which is carried out by ceramidases, depicts the other equally important regulatory part. This key role of ceramidases in determining cellular levels of ceramide, which is a prototypic proapoptotic stimulus, demands a proper understanding of the regulation of these enzymes. Besides an acidic form, which is localized in the lysosomes (5Li C.M. Hong S.B. Kopal G. He X. Linke T. Hou W.S. Koch J. Gatt S. Sandhoff K. Schuchman E.H. Genomics. 1998; 50: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), a neutral ceramidase has been identified recently and cloned (6Tani M. Okino N. Mori K. Tanigawa T. Izu H. Ito M. J. Biol.

It is tempting to speculate that this latter enzyme plays a central role in signal transduction and is counterbalancing ceramide generation by the sphingomyelinases. In recent years, nitric oxide (NO), 1The abbreviations used for: NO, nitric oxide; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium; Gadd45, growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible gene 45; LC, liquid chromatography; MBP, myelin basic protein; MS, mass spectrometry; PDGF-BB, platelet-derived growth factor-BB; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PKC, protein kinase C; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). has become established as a diffusible universal messenger mediating cell-cell communication throughout the body. Excessive and uncontrolled production of NO is associated with severe diseases like septic shock, stroke, neurodegeneration, diabetes mellitus, arthritis, and other forms of acute and chronic inflammation (8Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4155) Google Scholar, 9Knowles R.G. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar, 10Krönke K.-D. Fehsel K.

NO-induced apoptosis has been described for a variety of cell types, but it seems to be a matter of concentration whether NO acts pro- or anti-apoptotic (for review see Refs. 12Brüne B. von Knethen A. Sandau K.B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 351: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar and 13Beck K.F. Eberhardt W. Frank S. Huwiler A. Messmer U.K. Mühl H. Pfeilschifter J. J. Exp. Biol. 1999; 202: 645-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The early and rapid mechanisms of NO signaling depend primarily on post-translational modifications of pre-existing cellular proteins such as guanylate cyclase. However, the late phases that are required to accommodate the microenvironmental changes are mediated by alterations in gene expression (14Pfeilschifter J. Eberhardt W. Beck K.F. Pfluegers Arch. 2001; 442: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 15Pfeilschifter J. Eberhardt W. Huwiler A. Eur. J.

Commun. 1999; 258: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that glomerular cells exposed to NO donors respond with a drastic increase in ceramide formation. This was due to a dual action of NO, on one side by activation of sphingomyelinases and on the other side by inhibition of ceramidase activities. In this study we investigated the mechanism by which NO reduces neutral ceramidase activity in mesangial cells. We show that NO-reduced activity of neutral ceramidase is due to proteasome-mediated degradation of the enzyme. Furthermore, we show that protein kinase C (PKC) is able to prevent degradation of the enzyme via direct phosphorylation.

The detailed characterization is described elsewhere (18Franzen R. Pautz A. Bräutigam L. Geisslinger G. Pfeilschifter J. Huwiler A. J. Biol.

PKC isoenzymes were expressed and purified as described previously (19Geiges D. Meyer T. Marte B. Vanek M. Weissgerber G. Stabel S. Pfeilschifter J. Fabbro D. Huwiler A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Rat mesangial cells were cultivated and characterized as described previously (20Pfeilschifter J. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In a second step, single cells were cloned by limited dilution on 96-well plates. Clones with apparent mesangial cell morphology were characterized by positive staining for the intermediate filaments desmin and vimentin, which is considered to be specific for myogenic cells, positive staining for Thy 1.1 antigen, and negative staining for Factor VIII-related antigen and cytokeratin, excluding endothelial and epithelial contaminations, respectively. For the experiments passages 8–20 were used. Confluent mesangial cells in 60-mm diameter dishes were stimulated for the indicated times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 0.1 mg/ml of fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. To stop the reaction, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were then scraped directly into lysis buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and homogenized by 10 passes through a 26-gauge needle fitted to a 1-ml syringe. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g and the supernatant taken for protein determination. 100 μg of protein were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (21Huwiler A. Wartmann M. van den Bosch H. Pfeilschifter J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) using a polyclonal antibody against the neutral ceramidase at a dilution of 1:500 and a monoclonal antibody against β-actin at a dilution of 1:1000. Confluent mesangial cells in 30-mm diameter dishes were stimulated as indicated. Lipids were extracted (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1953; 37: 911-917Crossref Scopus (42831) Google Scholar), and ceramide was quantitated by liquid chromatography (LC)/MS/MS spectrometry exactly as described previously (18Franzen R. Pautz A.

Confluent mesangial cells were stimulated as described above and homogenized in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0,5% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2,1 mm EDTA, 5 mmd-galactonic acid γ-lactone for the neutral ceramidase. Activity assays were performed according to Mitsutake et al. (23Mitsutake S. Kita K. Okino N. Ito M. Anal.

Confluent mesangial cells in 100-mm diameter dishes were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 48 h in DMEM containing 0.1 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-free DMEM in order to remove all phosphate. Afterwards, the cells were metabolically labeled for 4 h with [32P]orthophosphate (0.5 mCi/plate). After labeling, cells were stimulated at 37 °C for the indicated times with various agents. To stop the reaction, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold buffer containing 20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. Cells were then scraped directly into 1.0 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer and homogenized by 10 passes through a 26-gauge needle fitted to a 1-ml syringe. The homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was taken for immunoprecipitation. The supernatants (containing 2.5 × 106 cpm of labeled proteins) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a polyclonal antiserum against the neutral ceramidase at a dilution of 1:100 and 5% fetal calf serum in lysis buffer. Then 100 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B in PBS was added, and the mixture was rotated for 1 h at room temperature. After centrifugation for 5 min at 3000 × g, immunocomplexes were washed 3 times with a low salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% SDS), 3 times with a high salt buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% SDS), and once with 10 mm Tris. Pellets were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli dissociation buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After fixing in 25% isopropyl alcohol, 10% acetic acid, the gels were dried and exposed to an Imaging System (Fuji). Cell lysate of unstimulated mesangial cells was used for immunoprecipitation of the neutral ceramidase with a polyclonal antiserum at a dilution of 1:100 as described above. The immunocomplexes were tested for direct phosphorylation by using 1 μg of recombinant PKC isoenzymes (19Geiges D. Meyer T. Marte B. Vanek M. Weissgerber G. Stabel S. Pfeilschifter J. Fabbro D. Huwiler A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of calcium. The beads were incubated with 1 μg of the partially purified enzymes in a total volume of 40 μl containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 100 μm Na2ATP, 8 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 250 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 25 μg/ml diolein, 1 μm TPA, and either 100 μmCaCl2 or 100 μm EDTA for 15 min at 32 °C. To show the activities of the PKC isoenzymes, 5 μg of MBP, a well known substrate for PKC (19Geiges D. Meyer T. Marte B. Vanek M. Weissgerber G. Stabel S. Pfeilschifter J. Fabbro D. Huwiler A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), was included. Thereafter, SDS buffer was added to stop the reaction, and the samples were separated on an 8% SDS-PAGE for neutral ceramidase and 13% for MBP. Phosphorylated bands corresponding to neutral ceramidase were analyzed on an Imaging system (Fuji). 32P-Phosphorylated neutral ceramidase that was affinity-purified on an anti-ceramidase-Sepharose column was incubated with or without trypsin (100 μg/ml) in a final volume of 50 μl for 3 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, undigested samples were separated on a Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE (7% acrylamide gel), and trypsin-digested samples were separated on a Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE (10–20% acrylamide gel). Phosphorylated bands were analyzed on an Imaging system. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance. For multiple comparisons with the same control group, the limit of significance was divided by the number of comparisons according to Bonferroni. Previously, we have shown (16Huwiler A. Pfeilschifter J. van den Bosch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7190-7195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) that high levels of nitric oxide caused an increased ceramide formation with subsequent apoptosis of mesangial cells which was due to enhanced sphingomyelinase activity and reduced ceramidase activity. We have now extended these studies and investigated the mechanism by which NO inhibits ceramidase activity. Stimulation of renal mesangial cells with the nitric oxide donor spermine-NO leads to a delayed and time-dependent reduction of neutral ceramidase activity (Fig. 1 A) with a first significant effect after 8 h of treatment. This reduction of activity is paralleled by a decrease of neutral ceramidase protein amount as shown by a Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 B). The effect on neutral ceramidase activity (Fig.2 A) and protein level (Fig.2 B) occurs in a concentration-dependent manner. A maximal reduction to ∼60% of control level is obtained with 0.3 mm spermine-NO, which is not further reduced by increasing the concentration of the NO donor. Interestingly, the protein level of neutral ceramidase is almost completely reduced at 0.3 mmof NO. The total amount of protein was not changed upon NO treatment as shown by staining for the housekeeping enzyme β-actin (Fig.1 B and 2 B, lower panels). To verify that the observed effect of spermine-NO is indeed mediated by released NO and not by an unspecific effect, spermine was used as a control substance. As seen in Fig. 2 C, spermine has no effect on neutral ceramidase protein levels nor on activity (data not shown). Furthermore, Deta-NO, another NO donor which possesses a much longer half-life than spermine-NO, shows the same effect on ceramidase protein degradation (Fig. 2 C).Figure 2Concentration-dependent effect of spermine-NO on neutral ceramidase activity (A) and protein level (B) in rat mesangial cells. Quiescent rat mesangial cells were stimulated for 24 h with the indicated concentrations of spermine-NO (SP-NO; in mm) (A and B); spermine (SP; 0.5 mm) (C) or DETA-NO (0.5 mm) (C). Thereafter, cell lysates containing 100 μg of protein were taken for a neutral ceramidase activity assay (A) or SDS-PAGE (7% acrylamide gel) and subsequent Western blot analysis (B andC) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The generated [14C]sphingosine was separated on thin layer chromatography and evaluated on a Imaging System (Fuji). Data inA are expressed as % of control values and are means ± S.D. (n = 3–4). Neutral ceramidase activity in control cells was 20.8 ± 3.0 pmol/mg/h. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01, statistically significant difference compared with the unstimulated control. Data in Bare representative of three independent experiments giving similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When mesangial cells were exposed to NO donors in the presence of phorbol esters which directly activate PKC, both ceramide accumulation and DNA fragmentation were completely blocked (16Huwiler A. Pfeilschifter J. van den Bosch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7190-7195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effect of PKC on the NO-induced down-regulation of neutral ceramidase. Treatment of mesangial cells with spermine-NO in the presence of TPA dose-dependently reversed the inhibitory action of NO on neutral ceramidase activity (Fig.3 A). In parallel, the protein level of neutral ceramidase also recovered in the presence of TPA (Fig.3 B). Neither short term nor long term stimulation with TPA alone has any effect on neural ceramidase activity or protein level (data not shown). Furthermore, we tested the physiological activators of PKC, like platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), angiotensin II, and the stable ATP analog ATPγS, which all evoke phosphoinositide hydrolysis and generation of 1,2-diacylglycerol, the endogenous activator of PKC (24Pfeilschifter J. Hosang M. Cell. Signal. 1991; 3: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Pfeilschifter J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 203: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Pfeilschifter J. Cell. Signal. 1990; 2: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All these substances mimicked the effect of TPA and reversed the NO-mediated inhibition of neutral ceramidase activity (Fig. 4 A), as well as neutral ceramidase protein level (Fig. 4 B). Consistent with the observed increase of neutral ceramidase protein by all PKC activators, we found a decrease of NO-induced ceramide formation by these substances in intact mesangial cells when performing mass spectrometry of extracted lipids (Fig. 4 C). To investigate how NO down-regulates the protein amount of neutral ceramidase, we used the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (27Ch'ih J.J. Faulkner L.S. Devin T.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1979; 28: 2404-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig.5 A, the presence of cycloheximide does not abrogate the NO-mediated reduction of neutral ceramide protein nor does it affect the reversal by the PKC activators TPA, angiotensin II, or ATPγS, thus suggesting that NO modulates the degradation of neutral ceramidase rather than itsde novo synthesis. To investigate whether one of the caspases is responsible for the NO-induced degradation of neutral ceramidase, the caspase family inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK as well as the specific caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK were tested. However, none of these two inhibitors is able to block NO-induced enzyme degradation at the recommended concentration of 2 μm (data not shown). In contrast, the highly selective proteasome inhibitor lactacystin inhibited the NO-induced degradation of neutral ceramidase (Fig.5 B). To study whether PKC exerts its effect on neutral ceramidase via phosphorylation of the enzyme either directly or indirectly we performed in vivo phosphorylation assays. Mesangial cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate before stimulation. Thereafter, neutral ceramidase was immunoprecipitated, and incorporated 32P was analyzed. As seen in Fig. 6 A, stimulation of cells for 10 min with TPA causes a dose-dependent increase of phosphorylated neutral ceramidase. Similarly, PDGF-BB (Fig.6 A) and angiotensin II (Fig. 6 B) also induce phosphorylation of the enzyme. The TPA-induced phosphorylation is inhibited by the potent PKC inhibitor Ro 318220 (28Wilkinson S.E. Parker P.J. Nixon J.S. Biochem.

Cells were then lysed, and neutral ceramidase was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:100, as described under the “Experimental Procedures.” The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE (7% acrylamide gels) and visualized on a Imaging System (Fuji). Data are representative of two independent experiments giving similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Moreover, we investigated whether PKC directly phosphorylates the neutral ceramidase in an in vitro system. Neutral ceramidase was enriched by immunoprecipitating the enzyme from unstimulated mesangial cell lysates and was then incubated with recombinant PKC of the four subtypes that have been identified in mesangial cells, i.e. PKC-α, -δ, -ε, and -ζ (32Huwiler A.

As seen in Fig. 8, upper panel, the PKC-δ is the most efficient isoform to phosphorylate neutral ceramidase, which appears as a double band at ∼120 kDa. PKC-α and PKC-ζ induce only minor phosphorylation of the neutral ceramidase. In contrast, PKC-ε has no effect. To verify that all PKC isoenzymes used are active enzymes, phosphorylation of MBP, which is a well accepted substrate for PKC isoenzymes (19Geiges D. Meyer T. Marte B. Vanek M. Weissgerber G. Stabel S. Pfeilschifter J. Fabbro D. Huwiler A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), is shown (Fig. 8,lower panel). We further investigated whether the phosphorylation of neutral ceramidase by PKC in vitro occurs at the same phosphorylation sites as in intact cells. For this the phosphorylation pattern of in vivo phosphorylated neutral ceramidase was compared with in vitro phosphorylated ceramidase after trypsin digestion. As seen in Fig.9 A,32P-phosphorylated ceramidase from in vivo andin vitro assays runs at 120 kDa on a 7% Tris-glycine gel system. Upon trypsin digestion, enzyme preparations are both fragmented into an identical pattern of polypeptides. By using a 10–20% gradient Tris-Tricine gel system to allow a better separation of small polypeptides, two radioactive fragments between 15 and 20 kDa can be detected (Fig. 9 B).Figure 9Phosphopeptide mapping of trypsin-digested phosphorylated neutral ceramidase. Neutral ceramidase, either purified from mesangial cells and subjected to in vitrophosphorylation by PKC-δ (A, right lane) or affinity-purified from in vivo Pi-labeled TPA-stimulated mesangial cells (A, left lane), was digested with trypsin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Undigested control samples were separated on a Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE (7% acrylamide gel) (A), whereas trypsin-digested samples were separated on a Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE (10–20% gradient) (B). Gels were analyzed on an Imaging system (Fuji) for radioactive fragments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Mesangial cells have been shown to respond to high amounts of NO with an increased generation of the sphingolipid molecule ceramide, which involves a dual mechanism, the activation of sphingomyelinases, and the concomitant inhibition of ceramidase activities (16Huwiler A. Pfeilschifter J. van den Bosch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7190-7195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the mechanism by which NO reduces neutral ceramidase activity. Our data clearly show that the NO-mediated reduction of neutral ceramidase activity is paralleled by a decrease of the ceramidase protein level. This suggests that either the de novo synthesis of neutral ceramidase is blocked by NO or that NO induces degradation of the enzyme. The experiments performed in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, which does not affect the NO-triggered down-regulation nor the basal level of neutral ceramidase (Fig. 5), rather argues for an increased degradation of the enzyme. This notion is further substantiated by the observation that a specific proteasome inhibitor blocked NO-induced ceramidase degradation, whereas several caspase inhibitors were without effect. Thus ceramidase is targeted by the ubiquitin proteasome machinery in mesangial cells. Interestingly, the NO-mediated degradation of ceramidase can be reversed by PKC-activating agents, like the phorbol ester TPA, and also the physiologically important ligands PDGF, angiotensin II, and ATP. The mechanisms by which PKC prevents degradation are still unclear, but it is tempting to speculate that phosphorylation events play an important role. Phosphorylation is a well known mechanism for regulating protein stability. Thus many proteins are subjected to phosphorylation and as a consequence are degraded more rapidly, like the inhibitor of κB (35Steffan N.M. Bren G.D. Frantz B. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Paya C.V. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4685-4691PubMed Google Scholar), the transcription factor RelB, which is a member of the Rel/NF-κB family of transcription factors (36Marienfeld R. Berberich-Siebelt F.

Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31819-31824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). On the contrary, phosphorylation may also stabilize certain proteins like the epidermal growth factor receptor (38Bao J. Alroy I. Waterman H. Schejter E.D. Brodie C. Gruenberg J. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26178-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene gadd45 (39Leung C.H. Lam W. Zhuang W.J. Wong N.S.

Diaz de la Espina S.M. Papas T.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4700-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and thereby lead to their accumulation. In the case of neutral ceramidase, it seems that phosphorylation of the enzyme by PKC directly or indirectly by alteration of another kinase or phosphatase activity leads to reduced protein degradation. Our data further suggest that in mesangial cells the PKC-δ isoenzyme is the most likely candidate for a direct stabilizing effect. This finding is corroborated by the fact that (i) only the broad spectrum PKC inhibitor Ro-31 8220, but not the inhibitor of the Ca2+-dependent PKC isoenzymes, CGP 41251, is able to block TPA-stimulated phosphorylation of neutral ceramidase and that (ii) recombinant PKC-δ is the most effective isoform to phosphorylate neutral ceramidase in an in vitrosystem. In accordance with our data, Leung et al. (39Leung C.H. Lam W. Zhuang W.J. Wong N.S. Yang M.S. Fong W.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) reported that PKC-δ plays an important role in protein stabilization of Gadd45 in A431 cells. Mechanistically, they showed that epidermal growth factor, by activating PKC-δ, decreased ubiquitination of Gadd45, an effect that was blocked by the PKC-δ-selective inhibitor rottlerin. It is tempting to speculate that PKC-δ also decreases ubiquitination of neutral ceramidase and thus stabilizes the enzyme in mesangial cells. By sequence analysis of neutral ceramidase, nine putative PKC and several casein kinase II consensus phosphorylation sites can be found in the primary sequence (7Mitsutake S. Tani M. Okino N. Mori K. Ichinose S. Omori A. Iida H. Nakamura T. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26249-26259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, site-directed mutagenesis studies of these phosphorylation sites will be required in order to identify which of these putative PKC phosphorylation sites, if any, are indeed relevant for ceramidase stability. Remarkably, phosphorylation of neutral ceramidase per se, either by PKC or another kinase, seems not to be sufficient for activation, since short term stimulation with either TPA, PDGF-BB, or angiotensin II did not change the activity of the enzyme (data not shown). This contrasts to a report by Coroneos et al. (41Coroneos E. Martinez M. McKenna S. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23305-23309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), who found that PDGF activated an alkaline ceramidase in mesangial cells. This activation was under the regulation of a tyrosine phosphatase because activity increased in the presence of vanadate. Whether this alkaline ceramidase is identical to the neutral ceramidase investigated in this study is not clear, since no biochemical characterization of the alkaline enzyme has been reported. Moreover, when we added vanadate to mesangial cells, it had no effect on neutral ceramidase activity (data not shown). One obvious cellular consequence of neutral ceramidase stabilization by PKC is a more efficient elimination of ceramide which in turn may protect the cell from the proapoptotic action of this lipid mediator. There is increasing evidence that PKC can act as a cytoprotective enzyme preventing stress-induced programmed cell death (apoptosis) in various cell types, including mesangial cells (16Huwiler A. Pfeilschifter J. van den Bosch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7190-7195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 42Meinhardt G. Roth J. Totok G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 824-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Jun et al. (43Jun C.D. Oh C.D. Kwak H.J. Pae H.O. Yoo J.C. Choi B.M. Chun J.S. Park R.K. Chung H.T.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3395-3401PubMed Google Scholar) described that overexpression of PKC-βII, -δ, and -η isoenzymes protected 264.7 macrophages from nitric oxide-induced apoptosis by blocking nitric oxide-activating effects on c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase and p38 kinase. Moreover, overexpression of PKC-α in 32D myeloid progenitor cells leads to an increased activation of the protein kinase B/Akt which promotes cell survival (44Li W. Zhang J. Flechner L. Hyun T. Yam A. Franke T.F. Pierce J.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6564-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Obviously, there is a cell type-specific involvement of PKC isoenzymes in cell protection. From our data, we conclude that especially the PKC-δ is a prime candidate for exerting an anti-apoptotic effect in mesangial cells via stabilizing neutral ceramidase. This fits with our previous findings and hypothesis (45Huwiler A. Pfeilschifter J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 113: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) that PKC-δ mediates mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in mesangial cells and promotes proliferation in response to extracellular nucleotides. In this context it is worth noting that ceramide is able to bind directly to PKC-δ in mesangial cells (46Huwiler A. Fabbro D. Pfeilschifter J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14556-14562Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Such a binding leads to a decreased autophosphorylation of PKC-δ probably reflecting an inhibitory effect on the activity of the enzyme. This may constitute an intriguing positive feedback loop, with increased ceramide levels causing inhibition of PKC-δ, which in turn leads to an increased degradation of neutral ceramidase and amplified ceramide accumulation. Powerful negatively acting regulatory pathways are required to terminate amplification loops such as the one suggested here. Noteworthy, ceramide also binds to and triggers PKC-α-mediated feedback inhibition of cytokine-induced ceramide formation (46Huwiler A. Fabbro D. Pfeilschifter J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14556-14562Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 47Kaszkin M. Huwiler A. Scholz K. van den Bosch H. Pfeilschifter J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 48Peilschifter J. Huwiler A. News Physiol. Sci. 1999; 15: 11-15Google Scholar). Can these seemingly disparate results be reconciled? We suggest that ceramide acts as a negative feedback regulator to control its own synthesis in response to cytokine stimulation via PKC-α activation. But as soon as a critical threshold of activation is reached and high amounts of NO are produced by a delayed cytokine-induced expression of the inducible NO synthase, ceramide then functions as a positive feedback modulator to amplify its production via ceramidase destabilization due to inhibition of PKC-δ. This may operate in a switch-like mechanism (49Pfeilschifter J. Beck K.-F. Eberhardt W. Huwiler A. Kidney Int. 2002; 61: 809-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and initiate programmed cell death which is a common phenomenon in acute inflammation as well as resolution of disease (50Savill J. Johnson R.J. Exp. Nephrol. 1995; 3: 149-158PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together the results of this study provide evidence that NO blocks neutral ceramidase activity by inducing degradation of the enzyme and that this effect can be reversed by activating PKC, especially the δ−isoform. The neutral ceramidase may thus represent a novel attractive target to interfere with cellular stress response and to modulate programmed cell death which is a typical feature of many inflammatory diseases."

However, in combination with submitogenic amounts of IGF-I (2 ng/ml), E2 induces cell proliferation. We have previously shown that the synergistic action of E2and IGF-I emanates from the ability of both hormones to induce cyclin D1 expression and that IGF-I action is required to induce activity of the cyclin D1-CDK4 complex, which triggers cell cycle progression. Here, we show that IGF-I (but not E2) is able to induce nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1 by a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent mechanism. Nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1 and cell cycle progression were also observed when LiCl, a known inhibitor of GSK3β, was added to E2-stimulated cells. Thus, inhibition of GSK3β activity appears to trigger nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1 and cell cycle progression. This notion was confirmed by overexpression of constitutively active GSK3β, which blocks IGF-I-induced nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1 as well as S phase transition."

Yet despite these findings, the exact biological functions of the FA proteins have not yet been determined and the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for FA have remained obscure (15Witt E.

These cellular features along with the high susceptibility of FA patients to cancers have lead to the hypothesis that this disorder results from defective DNA repair. However, the absence of recognizable DNA binding sequence motifs in FA genes and the lack of evidence showing direct interaction of FA gene products with DNA cast doubt on the idea that FA proteins directly participate in DNA repair. Recent results demonstrating a connection between the BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumor suppressor and FA proteins suggest that FA proteins may play an essential role in regulating the cellular response to DNA damage (12Howlett N.G.

We found that fibroblasts derived from FA patients of complementation groups A, C, D2, and G were significantly deficient in the repair of both plasmid and chromosome DNA double strand breaks and that this deficiency was corrected by the expression of the respective FA cDNAs in these cells. Furthermore, a similar defect in DNA double strand break repair was seen in cells derived from two rodent models of FA and in wild type cells expressing a dominant negative FANCC allele.DISCUSSIONThe data presented herein support the conclusion that FA fibroblasts have a dramatically reduced ability to rejoin double strand breaks in both introduced plasmids as well as within their chromosomes. These defects were observed in diploid fibroblasts from patients whose cells belong to a number of different FA complementation groups. In all cases tested, the re-introduction of the deficient FA gene into these cells eliminated the aberrant phenotype. An inability to repair restriction enzyme-induced chromosomal double strand breaks was also observed in two different rodent models of FA as well as in a human cell culture model of FA induced by overexpression of a dominant negative allele of the FANCC gene. Taken together, these findings provide robust support for the conclusion that FA fibroblasts have a defect in cellular DNA double strand break repair.The nature of the DNA double strand break repair defect in FA fibroblasts, however, remains obscure. It is known that mammalian cells use both recombinational and non-homologous end-joining pathways to repair DNA double strand breaks. Thus, in principle, either mechanism or conceivably both could be affected in FA fibroblasts. It is not likely that the linearized plasmid substrates utilized in our end-joining assays are repaired via a recombinational mechanism. Thus, we can conclude that FA fibroblasts have a defect in a non-recombinational DNA double strand break repair pathway.

Instead, it appears that the deficiency resides in another currently uncharacterized non-recombinational repair pathway.It is tempting to speculate that the hypersensitivity of FA fibroblasts to restriction enzyme-induced chromosomal double strand breaks is a consequence of deficient non-recombinational repair of these lesions. However, a number of findings suggest that this hypersensitivity could reflect a deficiency in chromosomal homologous recombinational repair.

Thus, it is conceivable that FA cells have a defect in recombinational repair of chromosomal DNA double strand breaks.

A recent report by Taniguchi et al. (25Taniguchi T. Garcia-Higuera I. Xu B. Andeassen P.R. Gregory R.C. Kim S.-T. Lane W.S. Kastan M.B. D'Andrea A.D.

Similarly, BRCA2/FANCD1-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells and BRCA1-deficient cells also display radio-resistant DNA synthesis after exposure to ionizing radiation (46Kraakman-van der Zwet M.

Thus, given the association among FA proteins and BRCA1 and BRCA2 previously outlined, these data indicate that FA cells may have an S phase checkpoint defect. Failed repair of DNA double strand breaks and an inability to regulate an essential checkpoint may result in these FA cells progressing through the cell cycle with unrepaired chromosomal lesions that would ultimately lead to cell death.Regardless of the nature of the defect, the deficiency in DNA double strand break repair observed in FA fibroblasts may provide an attractive explanation for some of the pathologies associated with FA. Although this conclusion is derived from studies performed on fibroblast cells and may not be applicable to all cell types, evidence from lymphoblasts derived from FA patients also indicates a deficiency in DNA double strand break repair (20Escarceller M.

Additionally, an examination of both fibroblasts and lymphoblasts derived from FA patients has revealed no distinct differences in sensitivities to DNA-damaging agents or chromosomal instability, the two main cellular features of FA (16Ishida R.

Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 5399-5404PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the cancer predisposition that characterizes this disorder could result from chromosomal rearrangements is due to defective repair of chromosome double strand breaks that arise spontaneously or are created as intermediates in normal cellular processes. Likewise, just as defective repair of spontaneous DNA double strand breaks caused by oxygen is responsible for the neuronal apoptosis observed in knock-out mice lacking a functional non-homologous end-joining pathway (51Karanjawala Z.E. Murphy N. Hinton D.R. Hsieh C.-L. Lieber M.R. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 397-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), the defective DNA double strand break repair we observe in FA cells could be responsible for bone marrow failure observed in these patients. Therefore, one exciting possibility is that pharmacological approaches may be developed to activate the defective DNA double strand break repair pathway in FA cells. Such therapeutic intervention could potentially halt the inexorable loss of bone marrow stem cells that results in fatal anemia in these patients, thereby extending their life span. Fanconi anemia (FA) 1The abbreviations used for: FA, Fanconi anemia; SRB, sulforhodamine B. 1The abbreviations used for: FA, Fanconi anemia; SRB, sulforhodamine B. is a fatal inherited autosomal recessive disease characterized by progressive bone marrow failure and a significant predisposition toward malignancies, particularly acute myelogenous leukemia (1Auerbach A.D.

Some of the FA genes encode proteins that interact to form a complex in the nucleus. This complex is disrupted in cell lines from complementation groups A, C, E, F, and G (13de Winter J.P. van der Weel L. de Groot J. Stone S. Waisfisz Q. Arwert F. Scheper R.J. Kruyt F.A.E.

Yet despite these findings, the exact biological functions of the FA proteins have not yet been determined and the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for FA have remained obscure (15Witt E. Ashworth A. Science. 2002; 297: 534Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the molecular defect responsible for FA is unclear, it has been well documented that cells from FA patients display elevated levels of spontaneous chromosomal breaks and deletions and have an increased sensitivity to the cytotoxic and clastogenic effects of DNA cross-linking agents (16Ishida R. Buchwald M. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4000-4006PubMed Google Scholar, 17Papadopoulo D. Guillouf C. Mohrenweiser H. Moustacchi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mutat. Res. 1999; 435: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Patient-derived FA lymphoblasts have been shown to have significantly decreased plasmid-rejoining fidelity compared with normal lymphoblasts (20Escarceller M. Rousset S. Moustacchi E. Papadopoulo D. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1997; 23: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Escarceller M. Buchwald M. Singleton B.K. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P. Moustacchi E. Papadopoulo D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Additionally, nuclear extracts from patient-derived FA fibroblasts have substantially decreased plasmid-rejoining activity compared with extracts from normal fibroblasts (22Lundberg R. Mavinakere M. Campbell C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9543-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These cellular features along with the high susceptibility of FA patients to cancers have lead to the hypothesis that this disorder results from defective DNA repair. However, the absence of recognizable DNA binding sequence motifs in FA genes and the lack of evidence showing direct interaction of FA gene products with DNA cast doubt on the idea that FA proteins directly participate in DNA repair. Recent results demonstrating a connection between the BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumor suppressor and FA proteins suggest that FA proteins may play an essential role in regulating the cellular response to DNA damage (12Howlett N.G.

We examined both extra-chromosomal and chromosomal DNA repair in intact FA fibroblasts and retrovirally corrected FA fibroblasts from multiple complementation groups and animal models. We found that fibroblasts derived from FA patients of complementation groups A, C, D2, and G were significantly deficient in the repair of both plasmid and chromosome DNA double strand breaks and that this deficiency was corrected by the expression of the respective FA cDNAs in these cells. Furthermore, a similar defect in DNA double strand break repair was seen in cells derived from two rodent models of FA and in wild type cells expressing a dominant negative FANCC allele. DISCUSSIONThe data presented herein support the conclusion that FA fibroblasts have a dramatically reduced ability to rejoin double strand breaks in both introduced plasmids as well as within their chromosomes. These defects were observed in diploid fibroblasts from patients whose cells belong to a number of different FA complementation groups. In all cases tested, the re-introduction of the deficient FA gene into these cells eliminated the aberrant phenotype. An inability to repair restriction enzyme-induced chromosomal double strand breaks was also observed in two different rodent models of FA as well as in a human cell culture model of FA induced by overexpression of a dominant negative allele of the FANCC gene. Taken together, these findings provide robust support for the conclusion that FA fibroblasts have a defect in cellular DNA double strand break repair.The nature of the DNA double strand break repair defect in FA fibroblasts, however, remains obscure. It is known that mammalian cells use both recombinational and non-homologous end-joining pathways to repair DNA double strand breaks. Thus, in principle, either mechanism or conceivably both could be affected in FA fibroblasts. It is not likely that the linearized plasmid substrates utilized in our end-joining assays are repaired via a recombinational mechanism. Thus, we can conclude that FA fibroblasts have a defect in a non-recombinational DNA double strand break repair pathway. The findings that V(D)J recombination and Ku-dependent non-homologous end-joining are not affected in FA cells (20Escarceller M. Rousset S. Moustacchi E. Papadopoulo D. Somatic Cell Mol.

Rousset S. Moustacchi E. Papadopoulo D. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1997; 23: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Escarceller M. Buchwald M. Singleton B.K. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P.

Toxicol Lett. 1993; 67: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Additionally, an examination of both fibroblasts and lymphoblasts derived from FA patients has revealed no distinct differences in sensitivities to DNA-damaging agents or chromosomal instability, the two main cellular features of FA (16Ishida R. Buchwald M. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4000-4006PubMed Google Scholar, 19Carreau M. Alon N. Bosnoyan-Collins L. Joenje H. Buchwald M. Mutat.

Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 5399-5404PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the cancer predisposition that characterizes this disorder could result from chromosomal rearrangements is due to defective repair of chromosome double strand breaks that arise spontaneously or are created as intermediates in normal cellular processes. Likewise, just as defective repair of spontaneous DNA double strand breaks caused by oxygen is responsible for the neuronal apoptosis observed in knock-out mice lacking a functional non-homologous end-joining pathway (51Karanjawala Z.E. Murphy N. Hinton D.R. Hsieh C.-L. Lieber M.R. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 397-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), the defective DNA double strand break repair we observe in FA cells could be responsible for bone marrow failure observed in these patients. Therefore, one exciting possibility is that pharmacological approaches may be developed to activate the defective DNA double strand break repair pathway in FA cells. Such therapeutic intervention could potentially halt the inexorable loss of bone marrow stem cells that results in fatal anemia in these patients, thereby extending their life span. The data presented herein support the conclusion that FA fibroblasts have a dramatically reduced ability to rejoin double strand breaks in both introduced plasmids as well as within their chromosomes. These defects were observed in diploid fibroblasts from patients whose cells belong to a number of different FA complementation groups. In all cases tested, the re-introduction of the deficient FA gene into these cells eliminated the aberrant phenotype. An inability to repair restriction enzyme-induced chromosomal double strand breaks was also observed in two different rodent models of FA as well as in a human cell culture model of FA induced by overexpression of a dominant negative allele of the FANCC gene. Taken together, these findings provide robust support for the conclusion that FA fibroblasts have a defect in cellular DNA double strand break repair. The nature of the DNA double strand break repair defect in FA fibroblasts, however, remains obscure. It is known that mammalian cells use both recombinational and non-homologous end-joining pathways to repair DNA double strand breaks. Thus, in principle, either mechanism or conceivably both could be affected in FA fibroblasts. It is not likely that the linearized plasmid substrates utilized in our end-joining assays are repaired via a recombinational mechanism. Thus, we can conclude that FA fibroblasts have a defect in a non-recombinational DNA double strand break repair pathway. The findings that V(D)J recombination and Ku-dependent non-homologous end-joining are not affected in FA cells (20Escarceller M. Rousset S. Moustacchi E. Papadopoulo D. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1997; 23: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Escarceller M. Buchwald M. Singleton B.K. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P. Moustacchi E. Papadopoulo D. J. Mol.

Biol. 1998; 281: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) indicate that this observed defect does not involve these pathways. Instead, it appears that the deficiency resides in another currently uncharacterized non-recombinational repair pathway. It is tempting to speculate that the hypersensitivity of FA fibroblasts to restriction enzyme-induced chromosomal double strand breaks is a consequence of deficient non-recombinational repair of these lesions. However, a number of findings suggest that this hypersensitivity could reflect a deficiency in chromosomal homologous recombinational repair. First, the BRCA1 protein, which is required for efficient recombinational repair of chromosome double strand breaks, co-localizes to nuclear foci with the FANCD2 protein in cells following exposure to ionizing radiation (24Garcia-Higuera I.

FANCD2 has also been shown to be phosphorylated in an ATM-dependent manner following induced DNA damage (25Taniguchi T. Garcia-Higuera I. Xu B. Andeassen P.R. Gregory R.C. Kim S.-T. Lane W.S. Kastan M.B. D'Andrea A.D. Cell. 2002; 109: 459-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Second, the FANCB andFANCD1 genes are apparently identical to BRCA2, a gene also required for efficient recombinational repair of chromosome double strand breaks (12Howlett N.G. Taniguchi T. Olson S. Cox B. Waisfisz Q. de Die-Smulders C. Persky N. Grompe M. Joenje H. Pals G. Ikeda H. Fox E.A. D'Andrea A.D. Science. 2002; 297: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 15Witt E.

Cell. 2001; 7: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Third, both the BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins interact with the mammalian RecA homolog Rad51 (39Venkitaraman A.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3591-3598PubMed Google Scholar), and cells deficient in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 have a significant defect in homologous recombination, display chromosomal instability, and are hypersensitive to DNA cross-linking agents as are FA cells (38Moynahan M.E.

Thus, it is conceivable that FA cells have a defect in recombinational repair of chromosomal DNA double strand breaks. It remains to be determined whether the elevated sensitivity of FA cells to restriction enzyme-induced cell death is a consequence of defective non-homologous end-joining, defective recombinational repair, or both. It may be possible to gain insight into this question by studying the repair of double strand breaks induced into engineered chromosomal loci by rare-cutting endonucleases such as the yeast I SceI enzyme. An alternative explanation for the cytotoxicity observed in FA fibroblasts following introduction of restriction enzymes is that cell death may be due to improper checkpoint regulation following chromosomal damage. A recent report by Taniguchi et al. (25Taniguchi T. Garcia-Higuera I. Xu B. Andeassen P.R. Gregory R.C. Kim S.-T. Lane W.S. Kastan M.B. D'Andrea A.D. Cell. 2002; 109: 459-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) shows that FANCD2 fibroblasts have radio-resistant DNA synthesis following induced DNA damage. Similarly, BRCA2/FANCD1-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells and BRCA1-deficient cells also display radio-resistant DNA synthesis after exposure to ionizing radiation (46Kraakman-van der Zwet M. Overkamp W.J.I. van Lange R.E.E. Essers J. van Duijn-Goedhart A. Wiggers I. Swaminathan S. van Buul P.P.W. Errami A. Tan R.T.L. Jaspers N.G.J. Sharan S.K. Kanaar R. Zdzienicka M.Z. Mol. Cell.

Thus, given the association among FA proteins and BRCA1 and BRCA2 previously outlined, these data indicate that FA cells may have an S phase checkpoint defect. Failed repair of DNA double strand breaks and an inability to regulate an essential checkpoint may result in these FA cells progressing through the cell cycle with unrepaired chromosomal lesions that would ultimately lead to cell death. Regardless of the nature of the defect, the deficiency in DNA double strand break repair observed in FA fibroblasts may provide an attractive explanation for some of the pathologies associated with FA.

https://openalex.org/W2322016361,"p95 is a putative signal transduction protein of approximately 95 kDa that contains multiple tyrosine residues that are conserved from yeast to human, a Src phosphorylation consensus sequence and a proline-rich C-terminus that binds SH3-domains. Previous studies have established that mammalian p95 is physically associated with proteins that regulate apoptotic induction and cell transformation; however, it is unclear whether p95 is a positive or negative regulator in these processes. Moreover, a p95 partner protein has been localized at both focal adhesions and actin-cytoskeletons in rat astrocytes. However, there is no evidence that mammalian p95 has roles in regulating cell adhesion or morphology. In this study, we examined the effects of p95 on the anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity of malignant HeLa cells, and on the growth and morphology of non-transformed NIH3T3 cells. In HeLa cells, p95 overexpression promoted detachment-induced apoptosis (anoikis), inhibited detachment of viable cells from substratum and reduced tumorigenicity. In NIH3T3 cells, p95 overexpression promoted flat cell morphology and slowed cell proliferation, whereas p95 downregulation had opposite effects. These findings indicate that the mammalian p95 is a positive regulator in apoptotic signaling and a negative regulator in cell transformation. They also suggest that p95 has roles in regulating cell adhesion and morphology."

https://openalex.org/W2326071755,"We have previously reported the cloning of the Hematopoietic Pbx Interacting Protein (HPIP), a novel protein discovered through its interaction with Pbx1. HPIP is expressed in early hematopoietic precursors, can bind all members of the Pbx family and can inhibit the transcriptional activation of the oncogene E2A-Pbx. To further understand the function of HPIP, we have analysed its cellular localization and characterized its functional localization domains. Using fluorescence microscopy to follow the distribution of different HPIP sequences fused to GFP, we found that HPIP localizes predominantly to cytoskeletal fibers but has the potential ability to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytosol. The cytoskeletal localization of HPIP is mediated by an N-terminal leucine rich region (between aa 190-218) and can be disrupted by the microtubule destabilizing drug vincristine. The HPIP C-terminal domain (aa 443-731) bears a nuclear export activity that is blocked by the CRM1 inhibitor Leptomycin B. In addition, we found two basic amino acid regions located between aa 485-505 and aa 695-720 that contain nuclear import activities attenuated by nuclear export. These observations support a model in which the constitutive attachment of HPIP to the cytoskeleton could be modified by changes in functional domains implicated in nuclear export, import and cytoskeleton binding sequences, allowing the molecule to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W2080735558,"P2X purinergic receptors (P2XRs) differ among themselves with respect to their ligand preferences and channel kinetics during activation, desensitization, and recovery. However, the contributions of distinct receptor subdomains to the subtype-specific behavior have been incompletely characterized. Here we show that homomeric receptors having the extracellular domain of the P2X3 subunit in the P2X2a-based backbone (P2X2a/X3ex) mimicked two intrinsic functions of P2X3R, sensitivity to αβ-methylene ATP and ecto-ATPase-dependent recovery from endogenous desensitization; these two functions were localized to the N- and C-terminal halves of the P2X3 extracellular loop, respectively. The chimeric P2X2aR/X3ex receptors also desensitized with accelerated rates compared with native P2X2aR, and the introduction of P2X2 C-terminal splicing into the chimeric subunit (P2X2b/X3ex) further increased the rate of desensitization. Physical and functional heteromerization of native P2X2a and P2X2bsubunits was also demonstrated. In heteromeric receptors, the ectodomain of P2X3 was a structural determinant for ligand selectivity and recovery from desensitization, and the C terminus of P2X2 was an important factor for the desensitization rate. Furthermore, [γ-32P]8-azido ATP, a photoreactive agonist, was effectively cross-linked to P2X3 subunit in homomeric receptors but not in heteromeric P2X2 + P2X3Rs. These results indicate that heteromeric receptors formed by distinct P2XR subunits develop new functions resulting from integrative effects of the participating extracellular and C-terminal subdomains.

ATP and other purine nucleotides have widespread and potent extracellular actions on excitable and non-excitable membranes. Synaptic and hormonal messenger functions of extracellular purine nucleotides are mediated by two types of cell-surface P2 purinergic receptors (1Burnstock G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 603: 1-17Google Scholar). The P2X receptors (P2XRs) 1The abbreviations used are: P2XRs, ligand-gated purinergic receptor-channels; αβ-meATP, αβ-methylene ATP; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; [Ca2+]i, intracellular free calcium concentration: FL, FLAG are ligand-gated channels selectively permeable to cations, and the P2Y receptors are members of G protein-coupled heptahelical receptor superfamily (2Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492Google Scholar). In addition to the fast excitatory synaptic signaling, P2XRs participate in control of slower biological processes, including smooth and cardiac muscle contraction, exocytosis, and blood cell functions (3Edwards F.A. Gibb A.J. Colquhoun D. Nature. 1992; 359: 144-147Google Scholar, 4Warland J.J. Burnstock G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 92: 871-880Google Scholar, 5Tomic M. Jobin R.M. Vergara L.A. Stojilkovic S.S. J.

These cellular processes depend on calcium ions as a critical intracellular messenger. Activation of P2XRs leads to an increase in intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) indirectly, through depolarization of plasma membrane and activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx, in addition to Ca2+ entry through the pores of P2XRs (7Bean B.P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 87-90Google Scholar). The cation-conducting pore of P2XRs is formed through multimerization of at least three subunits (8Radford K.M. Virginio C. Surprenant A. North R.A. Kawashima E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6529-6533Google Scholar). Versatile expression patterns of seven P2X subunits identified so far (9North R.A. Surprenant A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 563-580Google Scholar) and their combinations through heteromeric multimerization in a single cell account for channel-specific calcium signaling patterns. Further diversity is produced by alternative splicing of primary transcript for some subunits, including P2X2 (10Koshimizu T. Tomic M. Van Goor F. Stojilkovic S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 901-913Google Scholar, 11Brandle U. Spielmanns P. Osteroth R. Sim J. Surprenant A. Buell G. Ruppersberg J.P. Plinkert P.K. Zenner H.P. Glowatzki E.

Finally, the active duration of ATP, a common agonist for P2XR, is under the control of tissue-specific ecto-ATPase activity, and modification of ATP analogs by this enzyme at the triphosphate moiety can severely influence the agonistic potencies (9North R.A. Surprenant A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 563-580Google Scholar). The P2XR subunits are composed of two putative transmembrane domains critical for ion permeability, a large extracellular loop, and with N and C termini in cytoplasmic face (9North R.A. Surprenant A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 563-580Google Scholar). The identification of cDNAs for P2XR subunits in rat vas deferens and PC12 cells was followed by the discovery of additional subunit members and homologs in divergent mammalian species (2Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492Google Scholar, 13Khakh B.S. Burnstock G. Kennedy C. King B.F. North R.A. Seguela P. Voigt M. Humphrey P.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 107-118Google Scholar). Their primary amino acid sequences exhibit a strong degree of conservation, especially within the extracellular regions. Ten cysteines in the extracellular region are well conserved, and sulfhydryl bonds are proposed to connect these cysteines (2Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492Google Scholar). Recently, residues critical for ATP binding were localized in the extracellular loop near the first transmembrane domain of rat P2X2Rs and at the well conserved lysine residue of P2X1R (14Ennion S. Hagan S. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29361-29367Google Scholar, 15Jiang L.H. Rassendren F. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34190-34196Google Scholar). These data confirmed that ATP interacts with the extracellular part of P2XR to induce conformational changes needed for receptor activation. Recombinant P2XRs are divided into two groups according to their relative potency for ATP and its analog αβ-methylene-ATP (αβ-meATP). P2X1R and P2X3R exhibit high sensitivity for both ligands and rapidly desensitize, whereas ATP is more potent than αβ-meATP in other receptors, including P2X2R, P2X4R, and P2X7R, and generates slow or non-desensitizing Ca2+ signals (2Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492Google Scholar, 16Koshimizu T. Van Goor F. Tomic M. Wong A.O. Tanoue A. Tsujimoto G. Stojilkovic S.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 936-945Google Scholar). The heteromeric assembly of two subunits, P2X2 and P2X3, in sensory neurons results in a slow desensitizing channel that is sensitive to αβ-meATP (17Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Google Scholar, 18Chen C.C. Akopian A.N. Sivilotti L. Colquhoun D. Burnstock G. Wood J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 428-431Google Scholar). Heteromultimerization of P2X4/P2X6 subunits and P2X1/P2X5 subunits is also functionally distinguished (19Le K.T. Babinski K. Seguela P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7152-7159Google Scholar, 20Torres G.E. Haines W.R. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 989-993Google Scholar). Furthermore, the intracellular subunit regions have modulatory effects on channel behavior, especially in controlling the rate of receptor desensitization. For example, a C-terminal deletion by alternative splicing and substitution of threonine at the N terminus individually accelerate desensitization of P2X2Rs (11Brandle U. Spielmanns P. Osteroth R. Sim J. Surprenant A. Buell G. Ruppersberg J.P. Plinkert P.K. Zenner H.P. Glowatzki E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 294-298Google Scholar, 12Simon J. Kidd E.J. Smith F.M. Chessell I.P. Murrell-Lagnado R.

However, the contributions of other receptor subdomains to the generation of subtype-specific ligand selectivity and activation/desensitization properties have been incompletely characterized. Also, the effects of mutual interactions among different receptor subdomains on the overall channel activity have not been clarified. Here we studied a functional consequence of altering the C-terminal and extracellular structures of P2XRs, in terms of agonist sensitivity, time course of receptor desensitization, and recovery from desensitization. To this end, we used extracellular chimeric mutants between P2X2 and P2X3 subunits with full-length or spliced P2X2 C terminus. The results of these investigations revealed an additive effect of intracellular and extracellular parts of P2XR subunits in regulating desensitization of homomeric and heteromeric receptors. Domain swapping between P2X2 and P2X3 subunits was conducted using the PCR-based overlap extension method as described by Horton et al. (24Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Google Scholar). To swap the extracellular domains, SacI andEcoRI sites were introduced into the coding sequences of P2X2 and P2X3 subunits. The PCR primers with silent nucleotide substitutions (underlined) are listed as follows: X2EcoL, 5′-AACATCGATTCGAATTCCATAGGCTTTGAT-3′; X3SacU, 5′-ATTGAGAGCTCAGTAGTTACAAAGGTG-3′; X3SacL, 5′-GCTCTCAATGGCGGTGTCCCTCACTTG-3′; X3EcoU, 5′-GGAATTCGCTTTGATGTGCTGGTA-3′; and X3EcoL, 5′-GCGAATTCCAAAAGCCTTCAGGAGTGT-3′. The intrinsic SacI site located in the coding sequence of extracellular domain of P2X2a and P2X2bsubunits was used to facilitate the swapping of the extracellular sequence flanked by EcoRI and SacI sites. By using PCR conditions described previously (22Koshimizu T. Koshimizu M. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37651-37657Google Scholar), the open reading frames for P2X2a, P2X2b, and P2X3receptors were isolated and subcloned into HincII andSmaI sites of a pBluescript vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the SacI site in the multiple cloning sites removed. The extracellular domain of the P2X3 subunit (Val60–Phe301) flanked by EcoRI andSacI sites was excised and used to replace the corresponding region (Ile66–Tyr310) of P2X2a and P2X2b subunits. The chimeric constructs of P2X2a and P2X2b subunits with a P2X3 subunit extracellular domain were designated as P2X2a/X3ex and P2X2b/X3ex, respectively. By using a similar strategy, the extracellular domain of P2X2 subunit (Ile66–Tyr310) was also obtained and used to substitute the corresponding sequence (Val60–Phe301) of P2X3 subunit. The resulting construct encoding a P2X3 subunit with a P2X2 subunit extracellular domain was designated as P2X3/X2ex (Fig. 1). A series of extracellular chimeric mutants were generated using the restriction site-independent method as described previously (25Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 466-475Google Scholar). Briefly, the coding sequences for the extracellular regions of P2X2a and P2X3 subunits were subcloned into a pBluescript vector at SacI/EcoRI andKpnI sites, respectively, in a head-to-tail configuration. Two μg of the construct carrying two extracellular sequences was linearized by digesting it with ClaI and XhoI. The linearized plasmid was then directly used for transformation into competent DH5α Escherichia coli strain (Invitrogen). During transformation and recovery, processes for chimera formation involve partial exonuclease digestion of linearized plasmid and base pairing between exposed ends of two inserts, followed by bacterial repair to a single sequence and ligation to recircularize the chimera plasmid (25Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 466-475Google Scholar). Ampicillin-resistant bacterial colonies containing circular plasmids were screened for a series of chimeric constructs by restriction enzyme digestion and PCR. In these mutant extracellular domains, chimeric junctions were in regions of high sequence conservation between P2X2a and P2X3subunits. The coding sequences of these chimeric constructs were subsequently confirmed with DNA sequencing using a fluorescence-based sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). For functional expression of chimeric receptors, the coding sequences were excised by XhaI andKpnI digestion and subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen). In parallel studies, the coding sequences of the P2X3 receptor and the newly constructed chimeric receptors were also subcloned into the bicistronic vector pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). These pIRES2 constructs contain the internal ribosome entry site of viral origin for constitutive expression of GFP. The fluorescence signal of GFP was used to identify transfected GT1 cells for single cell [Ca2+]i measurement. GT1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (1:1), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfection was performed as described previously (22Koshimizu T. Koshimizu M. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37651-37657Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, 1 million GT1 cells were plated on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine and allowed to attach for 24 h. On the day of transfection, 3 μg of the plasmid DNA was mixed with 15 μl of Plus ReagentTM and 3 μl of LipofectAMINETM(Invitrogen) in 3 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM medium, incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and then applied to cells. After 3 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with fresh culture medium. Single cell Ca2+ recordings were performed 24–48 h after transfection. In co-transfection experiments, equal amounts of two expression constructs were used. GT1 cells transfected with pcDNA 3.1 vector without insert did not show any detectable [Ca2+]i response upon 100 μm ATP application. Single cell [Ca2+]i measurements were performed as described previously (22Koshimizu T. Koshimizu M. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37651-37657Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min with 2 μm fura-2 AM in phenol red- and ATP-free medium 199 with Hanks' salt solution, subsequently washed with assay buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 10 mm glucose, and kept for at least half an hour in this medium prior to measurements. Apyrase (grade I) was purchased from Sigma and used at 10 μg/ml throughout the incubation process. Coverslips with cells were mounted on the stage of an Axiovert 135 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) attached to the Attofluor Digital Fluorescence Microscopy System (Atto Instruments, Rockville, MD). [Ca2+]i responses were examined under a 40× oil immersion objective during the exposure to alternating 340 and 380 nm light beams, and the intensity of light emission at 520 nm was measured. The ratio of light intensities,F 340/F 380, which reflects changes in [Ca2+]i, was simultaneously followed in several single cells. Cells expressing fluorescence protein were optically detected by an emission signal at 520 nm when excited by 488 nm ultraviolet light and were not detectable by 340 or 380 nm excitations. In co-transfection experiments with pIRES vectors, about 75% of fluorescent protein-positive cells responded to agonist stimulation and were considered to be co-transfected. Lower co-transfection efficiency below this level was excluded from further analysis. Oocytes at stage V and VI were isolated from adultX. laevis as described previously (26Beckstead M.J. Weiner J.L. Eger E.I. II Gong D.H. Mihic S.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1199-1205Google Scholar) and placed in modified Barth's saline (MBS) consisting of 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.82 mmMgSO4, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.91 mm CaCl2, and 0.33 mmCa(NO3)2 at pH 7.5. The oocyte nuclei were directly injected with 1.5 ng of expression constructs for P2X2a/X3ex or P2X3/X2ex in 30 nl of injection buffer (88 mm NaCl, 1 mmKCl, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.0). Injected oocytes were maintained for 3 days at 18 °C in sterilized incubation medium containing MBS plus 10 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 2 mm sodium pyruvate. For electrophysiological recording, oocytes were placed in a rectangular chamber of 100 μl volume and perfused with Ba2+-Ringer's solution (115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm BaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at a rate of 2 ml/min. The oocytes were then impaled with two glass electrodes (0.5–10 megohms) filled with 3 m KCl and voltage-clamped at −70 mV using OC-725C Oocyte Clamp Amplifier (Warner Instruments, Inc., Hamden, CT). Currents were digitally recorded with PowerLab/200 and Chart software (ADInstruments, Grand Junction, CO). ATP was first dissolved in distilled water and then diluted in Ba2+-Ringer's solution immediately before use and was applied for 30 s. All measurements were performed at ambient temperature. Hemagglutinin (HA) epitope, YPYDVPDYA, was added to the C-terminal end of P2X2, P2X3, and chimeric subunits, and FLAG (FL) epitope, DYKDDDDK, was added to the N terminus of P2X2a and P2X2b. The 5′-primer sites for HA tagging corresponded to the nucleotide sequence 803–824 of P2X2a (27Brake A.J. Wagenbach M.J. Julius D. Nature. 1994; 371: 519-523Google Scholar) and 525–544 of the P2X3 (17Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Google Scholar). The FL epitope was inserted between the initiative methionine residue and the second amino acid of the P2X2 by PCR. The 5′-primer sequence contained 6 bases of XhoI site, optimized translational sequence (28Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Google Scholar), 3 bases for methionine, 24 bases encoding the 8-amino acid FL-peptide sequence, and 21 bases encoding 7 amino acids next to initiator methionine. The 3′-primer for FL tagging has nucleotide sequence 541–562 of P2X2a. PCR were performed using P2X2SE and P2X3SE as templates, and amplified products were subcloned into pBluescript II vector for sequencing. Correctly tagged fragments were transferred to expression constructs using EcoRI/KpnI andXhoI/NarI for C-terminal and N-terminal substitutions, respectively. Crude membranes were prepared from GT1 cells 24–48 h after transfection as follows. Cultured cells in 60-mm dishes were washed once with ice-cold PBS and collected in TE buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). Cells were homogenized on ice, and membrane fractions were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were then lysed in the TE buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant and antibody for immunoprecipitation were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and additionally for 2 h with protein G. The immunocomplexes were washed four times with the lysis buffer, denatured, and subjected to gel electrophoresis. After separation, protein was electrically transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The blots were incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin in TBS (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl) and then with monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Babco, Richmond, CA) at a dilution of 1:3500 or anti-FL M2 antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) at 1:2000 dilution. For secondary antibody, peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was diluted 1:5000, and signals were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentration in the membrane protein samples was determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay (Pierce). For biotinylation of cell-surface protein, cells were treated with 0.5 mg/ml N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide-LC-biotin (Pierce) in assay buffer for 30 min at ambient temperature. The reaction was terminated by washing cells once with assay buffer containing 50 mmammonium chloride, followed by two washings with assay buffer only. Cells were then lysed with TE buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and subsequently immunoprecipitated with antibody against epitope. Biotinylated protein on the membrane was detected by peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences) at 1:5000 dilutions and visualized. Cells grown in 60-mm dishes were transfected with expression constructs for FL-tagged P2X2a and HA-tagged P2X3 as described above. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate buffer and incubated in assay buffer containing 1 μm [γ-32P]8-azido-ATP (370 GBq/mmol, ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) on ice for 10 min. UV irradiation was performed at 254 nm wavelength with 4 milliwatts/cm2 for 3 min. After washing with phosphate buffer to remove unlabeled ligand, cells were collected in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer and subjected for immunoprecipitation with anti-FL antibody. Equal amounts of protein samples (20 μg) were denatured, loaded onto 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by autoradiography using x-ray film (Eastman Kodak). Where appropriate, the results were expressed as means ± S.E. The time course of [Ca2+]isignaling was fitted to a single exponential function, and dose-response curves obtained by [Ca2+]imeasurements were fitted to three-parameter logistic function using a non-linear curve-fitting program (Igor, WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Significant differences were determined by either Student'st test or one-way analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's test, if applicable, and p < 0.05 was considered as significantly different. To analyze the importance of extracellular P2XR domains in calcium signaling, three native subunits, P2X2a, P2X2b, and P2X3, and two chimeric subunits, P2X2a/X3ex and P2X2b/X3ex (Fig.1), were individually expressed in GT1 cells, and agonist-induced [Ca2+]i responses were monitored in single cells. As shown in Fig.2, A and B, 10 μm αβ-meATP evoked only a small rise in [Ca2+]i in P2X2aR- and P2X2bR-expressing cells, whereas the subsequent stimulation with 100 μm ATP resulted in a rapid and large increase in [Ca2+]i. The declining rates in [Ca2+]i toward steady levels were faster in P2X2bR-expressing cells than in cells expressing P2X2aR. The differences in the macroscopic channel kinetics judged from these single cell [Ca2+]irecordings correlate well with the structural differences of the putative C-terminal regions and are in accord with previously published data (21Koshimizu T. Tomic M. Koshimizu M. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12853-12857Google Scholar) using [Ca2+]i and current measurements. In contrast to P2X2R-expressing cells, ATP and αβ-meATP were unable to elevate the [Ca2+]i in P2X3R-expressing cells when recordings were done under identical experimental conditions. Because neurons frequently secrete ATP, which in turn could desensitize P2XRs, we evaluated this hypothesis by preincubating GT1 cells with 10 μg/ml apyrase, an ecto-ATPase (22Koshimizu T. Koshimizu M. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37651-37657Google Scholar). After the incubation with apyrase, stimulation of P2X3Rs with 10 μm αβ-meATP resulted in a rapid and transient increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig.2 C) (n = 118). To fully regain agonist responsiveness in P2X3R-expressing cells, incubation in ecto-ATPase containing buffer was necessary for at least 20 min. On the other hand, this pretreatment had no apparent effect on P2X2aR and P2X2bR desensitization rates (Fig.2, A and B). The intrinsic characteristics of P2X3Rs, high sensitivity to αβ-meATP and rapid desensitization, were assessed in two extracellular chimeric receptors, P2X2a/X3ex and P2X2b/X3ex, in which the extracellular region of P2X3 subunit was transferred to the analogous parts of P2X2a and P2X2b subunits (Fig. 1). When expressed as homomeric channels, both chimeric receptors responded to application of 10 μm αβ-meATP with a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i, but only after preincubating cells with apyrase (Fig. 3, filled circles versus open circles). In GFP-positive cells transfected with P2X2a/X3ex or P2X2b/X3ex, 92 (n = 65) and 86% (n = 76) of the cells also responded to ATP, respectively, whereas no apparent increase in [Ca2+]i was observed in both cell types without apyrase treatment (82 cells with P2X2a/X3ex and 68 cells with P2X2b/X3ex). Therefore, we considered that these two P2X3R-specific characters are largely dependent on the structure of the ectodomain and could be transferred to the extracellular mutants when expressed as homomeric channels. The desensitization rate of [Ca2+]i signals induced by ATP was significantly accelerated in chimeric receptors compared with native P2X2aRs and P2X2bRs (Fig.4 A). The calculated time constants of signal desensitization from these measurements were as follows (in 10−3/s): 4 ± 0.17 versus12 ± 1.3 for P2X2aRs (n = 41) and P2X2a/X3ex (n = 40), respectively, and 20 ± 2.0 versus 23 ± 7.1 for P2X2bRs (n = 37) and P2X2b/X3ex (n = 47), respectively (Fig. 4 B). Although the desensitization rates for both mutant receptors significantly increased by the substitution of extracellular region in P2X2 subunits, this modification alone was not sufficient to mimic the rapid desensitization rate of homomeric P2X3Rs. This suggests that the other subunit domains, including the transmembrane domains and the C terminus, may also participate in desensitization, as already suggested (21Koshimizu T. Tomic M. Koshimizu M. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12853-12857Google Scholar, 29Werner P. Seward E.P. Buell G.N. North R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15485-15490Google Scholar, 30Zhou Z. Monsma L.R. Hume R.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 541-545Google Scholar). Notably, the modulatory effects of C-terminal splicing and extracellular chimeric mutation on the rate of receptor desensitization were additive; both C-terminal splicing and transfer of extracellular domain increased the desensitization rate seen in P2X2b/X3ex-expressing cells. In general, functional P2X channels are formed by homomeric and heteromeric multimerization, depending on subunits expressed in single cells. In further experiments, we used receptors in heteromultimeric configurations to investigate the interactive effects of extracellular and intracellular domains on agonist potency and receptor desensitization. Co-expression of wild-type P2X2aand chimeric P2X2a/X3ex subunits in single cells increased sensitivity to αβ-meATP compared with the cells expressing homomeric P2X2aRs (Figs. 2 A and5 A). Furthermore, in contrast to homomeric P2X2a/X3exRs, 10 μmαβ-meATP-induced [Ca2+]i response by heteromeric P2X2a/X3ex + P2X2areceptors was not dependent on preincubation of cells with apyrase. Because [Ca2+]i responses induced by 10 μm αβ-meATP were small in cells expressing homomeric P2X2a and not detectable in cells expressing homomeric P2X3R when incubated without apyrase, it was reasonable to conclude that a newly developed feature of αβ-meATP-sensitive but apyrase-insensitive [Ca2+]i response in co-transfected cells was largely due to activation of heteromeric channels. We also compared the pattern of αβ-meATP-induced [Ca2+]i signaling in co-transfected cells with different sets of wild-type and chimeric subunits (Fig.5 A). Heteromeric P2X2a + P2X2a/X3ex receptors showed slow desensitization, whereas the channels formed by P2X2b+ P2X2b/X3ex subunits desensitized in a remarkably strong manner (Fig. 5 B). Physical associations between chimeric and naturally occurring P2X2 subunits were confirmed using a co-immunoprecipitation method (Fig. 5 C). In this and following experiments, the immunological detection of channel molecule was done using the epitope-tagged subunits at either the N or C terminus, a procedure that had no significant effect on agonist-induced [Ca2+]i (TableI) and current (31Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6653-6659Google Scholar) responses. The calculated molecular weight of P2"

However, the mechanism whereby phosphorylation affects enzyme turnover is not well understood. We used a combination of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements and molecular dynamics simulations to explore the conformational free energy landscape of a 10-residue MAP kinase substrate found near the N terminus of the enzyme. This region is believed to be part of an autoregulatory sequence that overlies the active site of the enzyme. FRET was used to measure the effect of phosphorylation on the ensemble of peptide conformations, and molecular dynamics simulations generated free energy profiles for both the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated peptides. We demonstrate how FRET transfer efficiencies can be calculated from molecular dynamics simulations. For both the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated peptides, the calculated FRET efficiencies are in excellent agreement with the experimentally determined values. Moreover, the FRET measurements and molecular simulations suggest that phosphorylation causes the peptide backbone to change direction and fold into a compact structure relative to the unphosphorylated state. These results are consistent with a model of enzyme activation where phosphorylation of the MAP kinase substrate causes the N-terminal region to adopt a compact structure away from the active site. The methods we employ provide a general framework for analyzing the accessible conformational states of peptides and small molecules. Therefore, they are expected to be applicable to a variety of different systems.

The methods we employ provide a general framework for analyzing the accessible conformational states of peptides and small molecules. Therefore, they are expected to be applicable to a variety of different systems. Phosphorylation of specific amino acids near the surface of a protein is an almost universal mechanism of protein activation that has been long appreciated (1Graves J.D. Krebs E.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 111-121Google Scholar, 2Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 596-601Google Scholar). Yet the mechanism whereby phosphorylation modifies the activity of the protein is not well understood (1Graves J.D. Krebs E.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 111-121Google Scholar). Analysis of phosphorylation sites from different enzymes reveals common themes. In eukaryotes, phosphorylation typically occurs at tyrosine, threonine, or serine side chains, and these phosphorylated residues often form a network of hydrogen bonds with adjacent positively charged arginine residues (1Graves J.D. Krebs E.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 111-121Google Scholar, 3Lin K. Rath V. Dai S. Fletterick R. Hwang P. Science. 1996; 273: 1539-1541Google Scholar, 4Johnson L. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2274-2282Google Scholar, 5Russo A. Jeffrey P. Pavletich N.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 696-700Google Scholar, 6Feher V.A. Yih-Ling T. Hoch J.A. Cavanagh J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 1-6Google Scholar). The network of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges that form can then communicate phosphorylation to distant areas of the protein (6Feher V.A. Yih-Ling T. Hoch J.A. Cavanagh J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 1-6Google Scholar). In the case of yeast glycogen phosphorylase, phosphorylation occurs at a threonine residue located near the N terminus, a region that overlies the active site of the enzyme (3Lin K. Rath V. Dai S. Fletterick R. Hwang P. Science. 1996; 273: 1539-1541Google Scholar). The enzyme, which normally exists as a homodimer, contains two active catalytic sites, one in each monomer (3Lin K. Rath V. Dai S. Fletterick R. Hwang P. Science. 1996; 273: 1539-1541Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at this site causes the N-terminal region to fold into a compact structure that wedges between the dimer interface. This structural change helps to reorient the active site in a manner that facilitates enzymatic activation (3Lin K. Rath V. Dai S. Fletterick R. Hwang P. Science. 1996; 273: 1539-1541Google Scholar). Examples such as this suggest that large scale movements of flexible regions within a protein are an important component of phosphorylation-induced protein activation (3Lin K. Rath V. Dai S. Fletterick R. Hwang P. Science. 1996; 273: 1539-1541Google Scholar, 4Johnson L. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2274-2282Google Scholar).The aromatic amino acid hydroxylase superfamily comprises a set of enzymes that require phosphorylation at specific sites to become activated (7Fitzpatrick P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 355-381Google Scholar, 8Kobe B. Jennings I. House C. Michell B. Goodwill K. Santarsiero B. Stevens R. Cotton R. Kemp B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 442-448Google Scholar, 9Jiang G. Yohrling G. Schmitt J. Vrana K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1005-1017Google Scholar). The three enzymes within this class, tryptophan hydroxylase, phenylalanine hydroxylase, and tyrosine hydroxylase, share significant sequence homology within their catalytic domains and are expected to have similar tertiary structures in this region (8Kobe B. Jennings I. House C. Michell B. Goodwill K. Santarsiero B. Stevens R. Cotton R. Kemp B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 442-448Google Scholar, 10Vrana K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 401-402Google Scholar). Unfortunately, complete x-ray crystallographic identification of the structure of all three enzymes has been limited as these compounds are particularly difficult to purify and crystallize (8Kobe B. Jennings I. House C. Michell B. Goodwill K. Santarsiero B. Stevens R. Cotton R. Kemp B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 442-448Google Scholar, 9Jiang G. Yohrling G. Schmitt J. Vrana K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1005-1017Google Scholar). The structure of one member of this superfamily, phenylalanine hydroxylase, was recently presented in both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated state (8Kobe B. Jennings I. House C. Michell B. Goodwill K. Santarsiero B. Stevens R. Cotton R. Kemp B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 442-448Google Scholar). The structure is composed of an N-terminal regulatory domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain (10Vrana K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 401-402Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain contains a 15-residue sequence (residues 19–33) that extends across the active site in the catalytic domain. However, phenylalanine hydroxylase is phosphorylated at Ser-16, and unfortunately, the first 18 residues in the structure were not identified in the electron density in either the phosphorylated or the unphosphorylated structures (8Kobe B. Jennings I. House C. Michell B. Goodwill K. Santarsiero B. Stevens R. Cotton R. Kemp B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 442-448Google Scholar). This suggests that this region does not have a well defined three-dimensional structure in the absence of the substrate, phenylalanine. As a result, the two structures are quite similar. Because the structure of the phosphorylated region remains unknown, the structures of the C-terminal domains do not immediately yield information on the mechanism of phosphorylation-induced enzyme activation.Tyrosine hydroxylase, another member of this superfamily, catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of the catecholamines dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, which are molecules involved in the regulation of heart rate, blood pressure, and behavior (11Wevers R.A. Andel J. Brautigam C. Geurtz B. Heuvel J. Steenbergen-Spanjers G. Smeitink J. Hoffman G. Gabreels F. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1999; 22: 364-373Google Scholar). The structure of the C-terminal catalytic domain has also been solved recently and bears remarkable similarity to the corresponding domain from phenylalanine hydroxylase (10Vrana K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 401-402Google Scholar, 12Goodwill K. Sabatier C. Marks C. Raag R. Fitzpatrick P. Stevens R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 578-585Google Scholar). However, no depiction of the structure of the regulatory domain currently exists. Because all of the phosphorylation sites of the protein are located within the regulatory domain, it is difficult to determine how phosphorylation affects the activity of the enzyme based on an analysis of the catalytic domain alone. In situ, tyrosine hydroxylase is phosphorylated at four distinct serine residues, all located in the N-terminal autoregulatory region (Ser-8, Ser-19, Ser-31, and Ser-40) (13Haycock J. Ahn N. Cobb M. Krebs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2365-2369Google Scholar, 14Haycock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11682-11691Google Scholar). However, only phosphorylation of Ser-19, Ser-31, and Ser-40 has been associated with an increase in enzyme activity (14Haycock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11682-11691Google Scholar, 15Sutherland C. Alterio J. Campbell D. Le Bourdelles B. Mallet J. Haavik J. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 715-722Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-40 results in an increase in activity even in the presence of known feedback inhibitors (16Daubner S.C. Lauriano C. Haycock J.W. Fitzpatrick P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12639-12646Google Scholar). By contrast, recent data (17Bevilaqua L. Graham M.E. Dunkley P.R. Nagy-Felsobuki E. Dickson P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40411-40416Google Scholar) suggest that phosphorylation of Ser-19 affects the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase by facilitating the phosphorylation of Ser-40,i.e. the rate constant for Ser-40 phosphorylation is ∼2–3-fold higher when Ser-19 is phosphorylated first. It has been suggested that upon phosphorylation at Ser-19, tyrosine hydroxylase adopts a more open conformation that enables kinases to have greater access to Ser-40 (17Bevilaqua L. Graham M.E. Dunkley P.R. Nagy-Felsobuki E. Dickson P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40411-40416Google Scholar).Phosphorylation of Ser-19 and Ser-40 are mediated by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and cAMP-dependent protein kinase, respectively (13Haycock J. Ahn N. Cobb M. Krebs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2365-2369Google Scholar, 14Haycock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11682-11691Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Ser-31 is unique in that it is accomplished by the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonylkinases, ERK1 and ERK2 (13Haycock J. Ahn N. Cobb M. Krebs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2365-2369Google Scholar, 18Bobrovskaya L. Odell A. Leal R.B. Dunkley P.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 490-498Google Scholar, 19Lindgren N. Goiny M. Herrera-Marschitz M. Haycock J.W. Hokfelt T. Fisone G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 15: 769-773Google Scholar). Although MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-31 is associated with a modest 2-fold increase in enzyme activity, phosphorylation at this site appears to be a physiologically important mechanism for the stimulation of catecholamine production in a variety of different tissues (18Bobrovskaya L. Odell A. Leal R.B. Dunkley P.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 490-498Google Scholar, 19Lindgren N. Goiny M. Herrera-Marschitz M. Haycock J.W. Hokfelt T. Fisone G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 15: 769-773Google Scholar, 20Mitchell J. Hardie D. Vulliet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 36: 22358-22364Google Scholar). Therefore, deciphering the structural basis of enzyme activation by phosphorylation of Ser-31 is of particular interest.Haycock et al. (13Haycock J. Ahn N. Cobb M. Krebs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2365-2369Google Scholar) have identified a 10-residue peptide from tyrosine hydroxylase that contains the Ser-31 phosphorylation site, i.e. residues 24–33. An analysis of the structure of phenylalanine hydroxylase and its sequence alignment to tyrosine hydroxylase suggests that this peptide sequence forms a flexible region that overlies the catalytic site (13Haycock J. Ahn N. Cobb M. Krebs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2365-2369Google Scholar). Because the structure of the regulatory domain of tyrosine hydroxylase is not known, we explored the structural consequences of phosphorylating this peptide to gain insight into the mechanism of MAP kinase-induced enzyme activation. Comparison with the homologous phenylalanine structure suggests that this peptide forms a disordered region that does not form stable contacts with any other residues within the protein (8Kobe B. Jennings I. House C. Michell B. Goodwill K. Santarsiero B. Stevens R. Cotton R. Kemp B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 442-448Google Scholar). Therefore, an analysis of the accessible conformations of the peptide alone may yield insights into how phosphorylation of this region affects the structure of the protein.In this work we employed a combination of fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) (21Selvin P.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 730-734Google Scholar, 22Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983Google Scholar) experiments and molecular dynamics simulations (25Brooks C. Karplus M. Pettitt B.M. Proteins, A Theoretical Perspective of Dynamics, Structure, and Thermodynamics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988Google Scholar) to determine how phosphorylation affects the accessible conformational states of the peptide. Such an approach has broad appeal because it allows one to obtain the equilibrium distribution of states using FRET without the need to compute and analyze donor decay profiles (26Levin A.D. A FRET-based and Molecular Dynamics Study of Phosphage-induced Conformational Changes in Oligopeptides.M.Sc. thesis. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA2002Google Scholar). Furthermore, the two methods are complementary and yield a wealth of information on the equilibrium distribution of conformations for this biologically relevant peptide.DISCUSSIONThe regulation of cellular function is a complex process. Reversible phosphorylation of specific sites in a given protein is an often-utilized mechanism for short term protein activation and/or deactivation (1Graves J.D. Krebs E.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 111-121Google Scholar). As such, phosphorylation can be thought of as a molecular switch that modifies the function of a protein for as long as the protein remains phosphorylated. Although the mechanism whereby phosphorylation results in protein activation has been elucidated in only a handful of proteins (1Graves J.D. Krebs E.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 111-121Google Scholar, 3Lin K. Rath V. Dai S. Fletterick R. Hwang P. Science. 1996; 273: 1539-1541Google Scholar, 4Johnson L. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2274-2282Google Scholar, 6Feher V.A. Yih-Ling T. Hoch J.A. Cavanagh J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 1-6Google Scholar), it is likely that phosphorylation mediates protein activation by inducing important conformational changes within the tertiary structure of the protein. Such structural modifications can be achieved in a variety of different ways, and one common mechanism involves the phosphorylation of a site located within a flexible, solvent-exposed region of the protein (3Lin K. Rath V. Dai S. Fletterick R. Hwang P. Science. 1996; 273: 1539-1541Google Scholar,4Johnson L. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2274-2282Google Scholar).In this work, changes in the emission spectra of the peptide of interest upon phosphorylation were determined using FRET experiments. These data were supplemented with results obtained from detailed molecular dynamics simulations to determine how phosphorylation affects the accessible conformational states of the peptide. A great body of literature exists on applying FRET to rigid molecules that have well defined structures in solution (22Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983Google Scholar). By contrast, in this work we apply FRET to small peptides that can adopt a number of different conformations in aqueous solvent (25Brooks C. Karplus M. Pettitt B.M. Proteins, A Theoretical Perspective of Dynamics, Structure, and Thermodynamics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). Typically, FRET is used in conjunction with time-resolved donor decay measurements to obtain the distribution of distances between a given donor and acceptor within a flexible macromolecule (32Beechem J. Haas E. Biophys. J. 1989; 55: 1225-1236Google Scholar, 33Gao J. Yao J. Squier T. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1791-1801Google Scholar, 34Tezcan A. Findley W. Crane B.R. Ross S.A. Lyubovitsky J.G. Gray H.B. Winkler J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8626-8630Google Scholar, 35Imperali B. Rickert K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 97-101Google Scholar). This is possible because time-resolved decay spectra are a function, in part, of the donor-acceptor distance distribution (22Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983Google Scholar). However, the interpretation of these spectra is complicated by the fact that different conformational states relax at different rates. Because FRET measures the rate of energy transfer between an energy donor and acceptor that are in relatively close proximity of one another, conformations with small donor-acceptor distances relax at a fast rate relative to conformations with large donor-acceptor distances (32Beechem J. Haas E. Biophys. J. 1989; 55: 1225-1236Google Scholar). This introduces some uncertainty into measurements of the distance distribution because spectroscopic decay experiments record spectra on time scales that are longer than the average decay time of the sample. As a result, only conformations with large donor-acceptor distances will contribute to points on the emission spectra that are obtained at later times (32Beechem J. Haas E. Biophys. J. 1989; 55: 1225-1236Google Scholar), creating a phenomenon that is equivalent to a spectroscopic illusion. Although the equilibrium distribution of conformations does not change, at later time points it appears as if only the states with long donor-acceptor distances are present since these conformations are the only ones that continue to contribute to the decay emission spectra (32Beechem J. Haas E. Biophys. J. 1989; 55: 1225-1236Google Scholar). Therefore, the spectroscopically observed distribution of conformations changes with time although the true equilibrium distribution does not.In previous studies (32Beechem J. Haas E. Biophys. J. 1989; 55: 1225-1236Google Scholar, 35Imperali B. Rickert K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 97-101Google Scholar), this artifact of time-dependent FRET measurements has been accounted for by modeling the spectroscopically observed change in the distribution of states as a diffusive process. However, using this method to obtain the equilibrium distribution of states is problematic because it requires the numerical solution of a complex differential equation (32Beechem J. Haas E. Biophys. J. 1989; 55: 1225-1236Google Scholar, 35Imperali B. Rickert K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 97-101Google Scholar). Given the difficulty in obtaining accurate numerical solutions, one must assume a specific form(s) of the probability distribution of states (32Beechem J. Haas E. Biophys. J. 1989; 55: 1225-1236Google Scholar). By contrast, in this work we employ detailed molecular simulations to derive the distribution of conformational states for the peptides of interest, and we compare these data to the experimentally obtained FRET transfer efficiencies. In addition, we demonstrate how transfer efficiencies can be calculated from the equilibrium distribution of states or, equivalently, the free energy profile. If the calculated transfer efficiency agrees with the experimental result, as in this case, we assume that the calculated potential of mean force is an accurate representation of the free energy landscape of the peptide. In this work, both the fluorescent resonance experiments and the molecular dynamics simulations suggest that phosphorylation induces a dramatic change in the equilibrium distribution of conformational states. The combination of these techniques not only adds to the understanding of this family of enzymes but also may be extended to other as yet undefined problems in structural biochemistry.One limitation of the approach is that it is most useful when the data from the simulations agrees with the spectroscopic measurements. Comparison of FRET emission spectra with data derived from molecular simulations provides a mechanism for the validation of dynamic simulations performed on the system of interest. If the spectroscopic measurements are correct, then discrepancies between the calculated and measured FRET efficiencies can be used to make improvements in the simulation methodology and force field. Conversely, shortcomings in the experimental protocol for measuring FRET efficiencies may be responsible for differences between the calculated and measured result. Discrepancies between the two values should prompt a reexamination of both the experimental protocol and the simulation methodology.In this work, the calculated FRET transfer efficiencies were in excellent agreement with the experimentally determined values. Moreover, the structures obtained from the molecular simulations provide a window into the detailed molecular interactions that are responsible for the shift in the emission spectra. In the unphosphorylated state, a salt bridge forms between the side chain of Arg-11 and Asp-5. At closer end-to-end distances, additional electrostatic interactions are formed that are entropically unfavorable relative to the lowest energy state. By contrast, in the phosphorylated state, the Arg-11 side chain hydrogen-bonds to the side chain of the phosphorylated serine residue in a manner that is similar to what has been observed in other systems (3Lin K. Rath V. Dai S. Fletterick R. Hwang P. Science. 1996; 273: 1539-1541Google Scholar). In its new position, the Arg side chain is removed from its original orientation, and this allows other charged residues to form additional salt bridges. These interactions result in dramatic changes in the conformational free energy landscape of the peptide.An examination of the main chain conformation from both peptides suggests that phosphorylation could result in a dramatic change in the direction of the path of the N-terminal autoregulatory sequence. This change in direction could affect protein activation in a number of ways. First and foremost, since the N-terminal domain is believed to lie over the catalytic site, the new direction of the N-terminal region may remove steric hindrances that would prevent the substrate from entering the catalytic site. Second, since an additional tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylation site, Ser-19, is located within the proximal portion of the N-terminal regulatory domain, this conformational change may help to reorient this residue so that it can interact with other residues near the surface of the protein. Prior work suggests that phosphorylation of Ser-19 promotes phosphorylation of Ser-40 (17Bevilaqua L. Graham M.E. Dunkley P.R. Nagy-Felsobuki E. Dickson P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40411-40416Google Scholar). This raises the interesting possibility that phosphorylation of Ser-31 may actually facilitate the interaction between Ser-19 and Ser-40. This notion is consistent with recent work (19Lindgren N. Goiny M. Herrera-Marschitz M. Haycock J.W. Hokfelt T. Fisone G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 15: 769-773Google Scholar) that suggests that inhibiting MAP kinase-induced phosphorylation of Ser-31 also leads to an increase in Ser-40 phosphorylation.Because the structure of the N-terminal domain of tyrosine hydroxylase is not known, the orientations shown in Fig. 5 remain speculative. We cannot rule out that the N-terminal regulatory domain makes interactions with other residues within the protein in the phosphorylated state. However, the fact that the phosphorylated N-terminal region in the related protein, phenylalanine hydroxylase, is disordered in both the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated structures suggests that, in the absence of the substrate, the phosphorylated autoregulatory region does not interact with any other residues in the molecule. Another possibility is that the phosphorylated autoregulatory region interacts with the substrate, and as a result, this region adopts an unexpected main chain conformation in the phosphorylated state. In this scenario, activation would be a two-step process that involves both phosphorylation of specific sites and the binding of tyrosine to the active site. Similar two-step mechanisms have been proposed for phenylalanine hydroxylase as well as other systems (8Kobe B. Jennings I. House C. Michell B. Goodwill K. Santarsiero B. Stevens R. Cotton R. Kemp B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 442-448Google Scholar,36Stevenson L. Deal M. Hagopian J. Lew J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8528-8534Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the work presented here forms a viable, and testable, model for the structural consequences for MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-31.Both FRET and molecular dynamics simulations are methods that can be used to probe the free energy surface of molecules. In this study, we demonstrated how the two complementary methods could be used to study significant conformational changes in a biologically relevant peptide. These data are used to derive the equilibrium distribution of conformations. Unlike prior methods, this distribution is obtained without measuring donor decay profiles (32Beechem J. Haas E. Biophys. J. 1989; 55: 1225-1236Google Scholar). Furthermore, no assumptions about the particular form of the distribution of states are needed to obtain the free energy profile (32Beechem J. Haas E. Biophys. J. 1989; 55: 1225-1236Google Scholar). Overall, the method presented in this work is a potentially powerful approach for performing detailed conformational analyses on peptides and small molecules of biological interest. Phosphorylation of specific amino acids near the surface of a protein is an almost universal mechanism of protein activation that has been long appreciated (1Graves J.D. Krebs E.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 111-121Google Scholar, 2Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 596-601Google Scholar). Yet the mechanism whereby phosphorylation modifies the activity of the protein is not well understood (1Graves J.D. Krebs E.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 111-121Google Scholar). Analysis of phosphorylation sites from different enzymes reveals common themes. In eukaryotes, phosphorylation typically occurs at tyrosine, threonine, or serine side chains, and these phosphorylated residues often form a network of hydrogen bonds with adjacent positively charged arginine residues (1Graves J.D. Krebs E.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 111-121Google Scholar, 3Lin K. Rath V. Dai S. Fletterick R. Hwang P. Science. 1996; 273: 1539-1541Google Scholar, 4Johnson L. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2274-2282Google Scholar, 5Russo A. Jeffrey P. Pavletich N.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 696-700Google Scholar, 6Feher V.A. Yih-Ling T. Hoch J.A. Cavanagh J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 1-6Google Scholar). The network of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges that form can then communicate phosphorylation to distant areas of the protein (6Feher V.A. Yih-Ling T. Hoch J.A. Cavanagh J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 1-6Google Scholar). In the case of yeast glycogen phosphorylase, phosphorylation occurs at a threonine residue located near the N terminus, a region that overlies the active site of the enzyme (3Lin K. Rath V. Dai S. Fletterick R. Hwang P. Science. 1996; 273: 1539-1541Google Scholar). The enzyme, which normally exists as a homodimer, contains two active catalytic sites, one in each monomer (3Lin K. Rath V. Dai S. Fletterick R. Hwang P. Science. 1996; 273: 1539-1541Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at this site causes the N-terminal region to fold into a compact structure that wedges between the dimer interface. This structural change helps to reorient the active site in a manner that facilitates enzymatic activation (3Lin K. Rath V. Dai S. Fletterick R. Hwang P. Science. 1996; 273: 1539-1541Google Scholar). Examples such as this suggest that large scale movements of flexible regions within a protei"
https://openalex.org/W2047734709,"The human Ink4a/Arf tumor suppressor locus encodes two distinct products: p16(Ink4a) which prevents phosphorylation and inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein and, p14(Arf), a nucleolar protein which activates the function of the tumor suppressor p53 protein in the nucleoplasm in response to oncogenic stimulation through an as yet ill-defined mechanism. Here we show that the level of endogenous p14(Arf) and its balance between the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm in HeLa cells are exquisitely sensitive to changes in cell morphology and to short-lived perturbations in cell cycle and in nucleolar function such as those induced by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, roscovitine, and the casein kinase II and RNA synthesis inhibitor, DRB. Most remarkably, whereas p14(Arf) predominantly concentrates in the nucleolus of interphase cells and transiently disappears between metaphase and early G1 under normal growth conditions, it massively and reversibly accumulates in the nucleoplasm of postmitotic and S-phase cells upon short-term treatment with roscovitine and, at a lesser extent, DRB. In line with the fact that the nuclear level of p53 reaches a peak between mid-G1 and the G1/S border in p53-expressor cells which lack Arf expression, these results provide a clue that, in p53+/Arf+ cells, Arf proteins might serve both to speed and to amplify p53-mediated responses in conditions and cell cycle periods in which the mechanisms involved in p53 stabilization and activation are not fully operational. They further suggest that human endogenous p14(Arf) might activate p53 pathways in physiologic situations by acting inside the nucleoplasm, especially when normal cell cycle progression and nucleolar function are compromised."
https://openalex.org/W2330036938,"Cytokine signaling generally occurs through receptors lacking tyrosine kinase activity. Aggregation of receptors leads to activation of receptor associated Janus kinases (Jaks) which in turn phosphorylate members of a family of transcription factors (STATs) that translocate to the nucleus and regulate gene expression. In the case of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), the consensus for signaling in B lineage cells has been that Jak1, Jak2 and Tyk2 are all phosphorylated upon ligand binding and participate in activation of downstream elements, in particular STAT3. In other cell types, Jak1 has been demonstrated to be absolutely required for IL-6 mediated activation of STAT3. In the present studies, we have identified a series of end stage B cell (plasma cell) lines that fail to express Jak1, but phosphorylate STAT3 in response to IL-6. No evidence was found for a requirement of other Jak family members in the activation of STAT3. STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited in a dose dependent manner by the MEK inhibitor U0126, but not by inhibitors of PI-3K or Src kinases. Moreover, STAT3 phosphorylation was similarly inhibited in lines expressing Jak1 wherein Jak1 was phosphorylated upon IL-6 stimulation and Jak1 phosphorylation was not inhibited by U0126. These results indicate that the MAPK pathway plays a critical role in IL-6 mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and suggests that Jak kinases may not be required in this cascade. Thus, it may be important to re-evaluate the role of Jak kinases in other cytokine signaling pathways as well."

Chem.277, 13673–13681) a functional interaction between the ERG-1 K+ channel and Src tyrosine kinase, which increased the current. We now show that the tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-1, which is present in microglia, is increased after brain damage, and is activated by colony-stimulating factor-1, associates with ERG-1 and regulates the current. Patch clamp recordings from the MLS-9 microglia cells were made with pipette solutions containing a recombinant SHP-1 protein: wild type (SHP-1 wild type (wt)), catalytically active (SHP-1 S6), or the substrate-trapping mutant (SHP-1 Cys → Ser). SHP-1 wt and SHP-1 S6 proteins decreased the current, an effect that was reversed by the phosphatase inhibitor, pervanadate, whereas SHP-1 Cys → Ser increased the current. Moreover, transient transfection with cDNA for SHP-1 wt or SHP-1 S6 decreased the ERG current without decreasing the protein level. Tyrosine phosphorylation of ERG-1 was decreased by transfection with SHP-1 wt and increased by SHP-1 Cys → Ser. The decrease in current by active SHP-1 was partly attributed to changes in the voltage dependence of activation and steady-state conductance, whereas inactivation kinetics and voltage dependence were not affected.

In excitable cells, K+ channels set the membrane potential (Vm), which is crucial for regulating excitability, Ca2+ influx, and secretion. Their roles in non-excitable cells may be even more diverse. In addition to controlling Vm and Ca2+ entry, K+ channels contribute to ion homeostasis, cell cycle, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and to cell volume regulation, which counteracts metabolically generated osmolytes.

(Lond.). 1996; 496: 13-23Google Scholar), although some roles have only been studied in cell lines. We previously identified ERG currents and ERG-1 protein in the brain microglia cell line (MLS-9) that we developed (1Cayabyab F.S. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13673-13681Google Scholar, 14Pennefather P.S. Zhou W. DeCoursey T.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 795-805Google Scholar, 15Zhou W. Cayabyab F.S. Pennefather P.S. Schlichter L.C. DeCoursey T.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 781-794Google Scholar). Because MLS-9 cells lack the Kv1.3 and classical inward-rectifier currents that are prevalent in primary cultured microglia from which they are derived, ERG is expected to perform most roles of K+ channels in these cells. Microglia and other ERG-expressing cells have protein tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling processes. We presented previously (1Cayabyab F.S. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13673-13681Google Scholar) the first report that tyrosine phosphorylation of the ERG protein modulates the ERG current. In MLS-9 cells, ERG-1 protein associates with, and is phosphorylated by, the cytosolic protein tyrosine kinase, Src. Phosphorylation is decreased by protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and several means of inhibiting endogenous Src activity reduce the current. Conversely, activating endogenous Src or transfecting constitutively active v-Src increases the current and alters its voltage dependence and kinetics, producing much more ERG current at negative potentials. The ERG current is then poised to promote microglial functions that require a negative membrane potential. Thus, we wanted to identify protein tyrosine phosphatase(s) that counter-modulate the ERG current. For several reasons, we considered SHP-1, an SH2 (Src homology 2)-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase, as a likely candidate. (i) SHP-1 is expressed predominantly in hematopoietic cells (16Plutzky J. Neel B.G. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1123-1127Google Scholar), including microglia, and is up-regulated in microglia after traumatic brain injury (17Horvat A. Schwaiger F. Hager G. Brocker F. Streif R. Knyazev P. Ullrich A. Kreutzberg G.W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 865-874Google Scholar). (ii) SHP-1 is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation after the mitogen, colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) binds to its receptor (18Yeung Y.G. Berg K.L. Pixley F.J. Angeletti R.H. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23447-23450Google Scholar, 19Chen H.E. Chang S. Trub T. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3685-3697Google Scholar). Microglia proliferation is strongly stimulated by CSF-1 (20Fedoroff S. Berezovskaya O. Maysinger D. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1997; 21: 187-191Google Scholar), a process that was used to produce the cell line, MLS-9 (15Zhou W. Cayabyab F.S. Pennefather P.S. Schlichter L.C. DeCoursey T.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 781-794Google Scholar). (iii) An immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) consensus (Leu-Thr-Tyr(P)829-Cys-Asp-Leu) (21Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 368: 70-73Google Scholar, 22Vély F. Olivero S. Olcese L. Moretta A. Damen J.E. Liu L. Krystal G. Cambier J.C. Daëron Vivier E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1994-2000Google Scholar, 23Blasioli J. Paust S. Thomas M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2303-2307Google Scholar) is present in the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain in the carboxyl terminus of ERG-1. ITIM is an SH2-binding motif that is present in a number of cellular receptors (NK cell inhibitory receptors, antigen receptors, CD22, and interleukin-3 receptors) that are associated with inhibitory signaling within the immune system. (iv) Brains of homozygousmotheaten mice, which are SHP-1 null, have decreased numbers of all subtypes of glia (24Wishcamper C.A. Coffin J.D. Lurie D.I. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 441: 118-133Google Scholar), suggesting that SHP-1 plays an important role in the normal differentiation and distribution of astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. Despite this wealth of information, nothing is known about the actions of SHP-1 on any ion channel. We have now exploited several SHP-1 variants to delineate the role of SHP-1 in modulating the ERG current. Inactive SHP-1 apparently exists in a “closed” state and then undergoes a conformational change to an “open” state on activation (25Pei D. Wang J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1141-1145Google Scholar). By using high pressure liquid chromatography size-exclusion and sucrose density gradient sedimentation analyses, we showed previously that the inactive wild type SHP-1 (SHP-1 wt) is a globular protein (closed state) and the active SHP-1 S6 (lacking the amino-terminal SH2 domain) has an extended conformation (open state) (26Martin A. Tsui H.W. Shulman M.J. Isenman D. Tsui F.W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21725-21734Google Scholar). Mutation of the catalytic cysteine residue (SHP-1 Cys → Ser) from the signature motif eliminates enzymatic activity, while allowing normal substrate binding. It can protect the target protein from dephosphorylation by trapping the substrate (27Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Google Scholar) and thus the SHP-1 Cys → Ser mutant acts in a dominant-negative manner (28Su L. Zhao T. Bouchard P. Banville D. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Shen S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10385-10390Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that SHP-1 protein interacts with and dephosphorylates the native ERG protein in MLS-9 cells. We used the three types of SHP-1 protein (SHP-1 wt, SHP-1 S6, and SHP-1 Cys → Ser) to show that SHP-1 is a negative regulator of ERG current and to identify ERG-1 as bona fidesubstrate for SHP-1. This is the first demonstration that SHP-1 regulates any ion channel. The MLS-9 cell line was derived by treating pure cultures of rat microglia with colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) for several weeks and then harvesting microglia colonies (15Zhou W. Cayabyab F.S. Pennefather P.S. Schlichter L.C. DeCoursey T.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 781-794Google Scholar, 29Schlichter L.C. Sakellaropoulos G. Ballyk B. Pennefather P.S. Phipps D.J. Glia. 1996; 17: 225-236Google Scholar). Like cultured rat microglia, MLS-9 cells stain with isolectin B4 and the antibodies OX-42 and ED-1. They are not labeled with antibodies against the astrocyte marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein, or the fibroblast protein, fibronectin. MLS-9 cultures were grown to 75–80% confluency in endotoxin-free minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 5% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. For harvesting, they were washed twice with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then released from the flask by incubating (10 min, 37 °C) with sodium citrate solution (130 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mmd-glucose, pH 7.4). After adding an equal volume of MEM to the cell suspension, the cells were centrifuged at 700 rpm for 10 min and then resuspended in MEM. All cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings of ERG currents were made as described previously (1Cayabyab F.S. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13673-13681Google Scholar). An Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) was used with on-line compensation for series resistance and capacitance. The signals were filtered at 5 kHz and analyzed using pCLAMP 6.0 software (Axon Instruments). Pipettes with resistances of 3–5 MΩ were made from thin walled borosilicate glass capillaries (WPI, Sarasota, FL). Recordings were from isolated bipolar MLS-9 cells with relatively small series resistances (4–15 MΩ), which were compensated to <5 MΩ, and because the currents were <1000 pA, the maximal voltage error was 5 mV. Only cells exhibiting adequate voltage control were included, as judged by mono-exponential decays for the capacitive current and deactivation at very negative potentials. Curve fitting for kinetics and voltage dependence used non-linear least squares routines in Microcal Origin Version 5.0 (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). MLS-9 cells were plated in MEM on sterile glass coverslips at about 30% confluency, allowed to adhere ≥3 h, and then superfused during recordings with a solution containing (in mm) 130 potassium aspartate, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 40 sucrose, and 5 d-glucose (pH 7.4, 300 mOsm). The pipette solution contained 130 potassium aspartate, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 K2ATP, titrated with KOH to pH 7.2 (290 mOsm). Aspartate was used as the major anion to reduce contamination by Cl− currents (29Schlichter L.C. Sakellaropoulos G. Ballyk B. Pennefather P.S. Phipps D.J. Glia. 1996; 17: 225-236Google Scholar). All recordings were made at 20–23 °C. The HERG blocker, E-4031, was prepared as a 10 mm stock solution in distilled water, stored at −20 °C, and then diluted in bath solution to the final concentration. Previously, we used the specific Src-inhibiting peptide,src40–58, and we showed that the scrambled peptide (src40–58s) was an inactive control (1Cayabyab F.S. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13673-13681Google Scholar). Thus, in the present study, we used cells containing the scrambled peptide,src40–58s, as a negative time-matched control for experiments in which pipette solutions were supplemented with the recombinant proteins, SHP-1 wt, SHP-1 S6, and SHP-1 Cys → Ser. All peptides (synthesized at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada) were prepared as concentrated aqueous stock solutions in 0.1% bovine serum albumin, stored at −80 °C, and then thawed and diluted in pipette solution just before use. The final pipette concentration of each protein was 0.1 mg/ml. Pervanadate was prepared as a 200 mm stock solution in distilled water, stored at −20 °C, and then diluted in bath solution to the final concentration. The properties of the recombinant SHP-1 proteins with differing catalytic activity and the mammalian expression plasmids, pABA-neo (containing SHP-1 wt or SHP-1 S6), p4AD (containing SHP-1 wt), p4AE (containing SHP-1 Cys → Ser), and pRSVβgal have been described (26Martin A. Tsui H.W. Shulman M.J. Isenman D. Tsui F.W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21725-21734Google Scholar, 30Martin A. Tsui H.W. Tsui F.W.L. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 1029-1041Google Scholar). Each dish of MLS-9 cells was transiently transfected with 2 μg/ml of a vector alone (pABA-neo or pRSVβgal) or with SHP-1 wt, SHP-1 S6, or SHP-1 Cys → Ser, along with 1 μg/ml pEGFP cDNA, using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as described previously (31Cayabyab F.S. Khanna R. Jones O.T. Schlichter L.C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 1949-1960Google Scholar). Patch clamp recordings were made from green fluorescent cells 24–48 h after transfection. For biochemical analyses, cells were harvested 24 h after transfection by scraping and then lysed in ice-cold modified RIPA buffer (see below), and the protein concentration of each cell lysate was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). To monitor the tyrosine phosphorylation of native ERG-1, the proteins were immunoprecipitated using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and then Western blots were probed for ERG-1, as follows. MLS-9 cells were lysed in a solubilization buffer (20 min, 4 °C) that contained 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, and the protease inhibitors leupeptin (2 μg/ml), aprotinin (2 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 ×g (15 min, 4 °C) to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was cleared by incubation with protein A/G-agarose (3 mg/ml, 1 h) (Calbiochem) and centrifuged to remove the agarose. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated from 100 μg of total protein by incubating overnight at 4 °C with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20, Medicorp, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) and then incubating for 3 h in protein A/G-agarose, followed by centrifugation. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with ice-cold solubilization buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and then eluted in 50 μl of gel-loading buffer containing 120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 25% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 1 mmNa3VO4. For Western analysis, protein concentrations were measured as above, and then proteins were run on a 6.5% polyacrylamide gel, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose, and blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST). The membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with a polyclonal anti-HERG (human homologue of ERG-1) antibody (1:160; Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel). After four washes with PBST, the membranes were incubated (1 h, room temperature) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:3000; Cedarlane Labs, Hornby, Ontario, Canada). Following another four washes with PBST, labeled proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL,Amersham Biosciences) on XAR-2 film (Eastman Kodak Co.), and the signals were quantified by densitometry (Bio-Rad model GS-670). In parallel, Western blots were prepared using 50 μg of total protein and probed with anti-cyclin D1/D2 (1:500; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and the signals were analyzed by densitometry and used to normalize amounts of tyrosine-phosphorylated ERG-1. In addition, Western analysis was used to analyze the relative phosphotyrosine levels of ERG-1 protein using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or anti-HERG antibody on total cell lysates (20–40 μg) from vector control, SHP-1 wt, and SHP-1 Cys → Ser transfectants. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis was also used to examine interactions between native ERG-1 and SHP-1, between SHP-1 and Src tyrosine kinase, and between ERG-1 and Src. MLS-9 cells were washed in PBS and then lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold modified RIPA buffer, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, aprotinin (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets (2 tablets/100 ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Following a 20-min incubation on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. About 500 μg of solubilized protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal anti-HERG antibody (1:83), monoclonal anti-SHP-1 antibody (1:125; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or a monoclonal anti-Src antibody (1:125; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). The ERG-1, SHP-1, or Src immunoprecipitates were incubated with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of anti-rabbit or anti-mouse-agarose beads, as appropriate, and the mixtures were rotated for 3 h or overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times in modified RIPA buffer, eluted in 50 μl of gel-loading buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE, as described above. They were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HERG (1:160), anti-SHP-1 (1:250), or anti-Src antibody (1:250), with the appropriate secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG) and visualized by ECL. Parallel Western blots labeled with anti-cyclin D1/D2 (1:500; Upstate Biotechnology) were used to normalize the amounts of ERG-1, Src, and SHP-1. Reagents were from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. When appropriate, we used the two-tailed Student's pairedt test or ordinary analysis of variance tests with the Bonferroni corrections multiple-comparison post-test, performed with INSTAT2 software (GraphPad Instat Software, version 2.04, Sunnyvale, CA). In either case, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. There are two main mechanisms whereby SHP-1 might modulate ERG functions. (i) An ITIM consensus sequence is present in the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of the ERG-1 protein (see Introduction). If SHP-1 interacts with ERG-1 via this ITIM motif, we would expect it to down-regulate the ERG current. (ii) We showed previously that in MLS-9 cells, activated c-Src, and transfected, constitutively active v-Src increase the ERG current (1Cayabyab F.S. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13673-13681Google Scholar). It has been reported that SHP-1 relieves the auto-inhibition of c-Src, thereby activating it (32Somani A.-K. Bignon J.S. Mills G.B. Siminovitch K.A. Branch D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21113-21119Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that SHP-1 would increase ERG current by activating c-Src. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used two approaches. To assess the functional role of SHP-1 in regulating the ERG current in MLS-9 cells, we used whole-cell recordings with purified SHP-1 wt or mutant proteins in the pipette or transient transfections with SHP-1 wt, mutant constructs. Recombinant His-tagged SHP-1 wt and mutant SHP-1 S6 and SHP-1 Cys → Ser proteins were purified using Talon® (Clontech) columns (26Martin A. Tsui H.W. Shulman M.J. Isenman D. Tsui F.W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21725-21734Google Scholar). We assessed acute effects of each SHP-1 protein on ERG current by including it in the recording pipette solution. Scrambledsrc40–58 (src40–58s) peptide, which did not affect the ERG current (Fig. 1), was used as a time-matched negative control (1Cayabyab F.S. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13673-13681Google Scholar). The peak currents at 30 min were 374.5 ± 48.5 pA versus 403.6 ± 39 pA with and without src40–58s, respectively (n = 7,p > 0.05). Spontaneous rundown was <10% at 30 min compared with the initial current during the first 5 min of recording. However, with either SHP-1 wt or SHP-1 S6 in the pipette solution, the peak ERG currents decreased significantly and to similar plateau levels (Fig. 1B). With SHP-1 wt, the average decrease was 53%,i.e. 432.4 ± 50.6 pA for the first 5 minversus 203 ± 53 pA at 30 min (n = 7,p < 0.01). With SHP-1 S6, the current decreased by 47%, 551.6 ± 68.3 pA for the first 5 min versus290.8 ± 51 pA at 30 min (n = 6, p= 0.01). Conversely, SHP-1 Cys → Ser, which acts in a dominant-negative manner, increased the ERG current by 97% from 443.6 ± 27.4 pA in the first 5 min to 872.1 ± 101 pA at 30 min (n = 4, p < 0.01). Thus, active SHP-1 phosphatase reduces the native ERG current in MLS-9 cells. Pervanadate, an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases, prevented the action of SHP-1 (Fig. 2). The current was decreased by 52% (from 576 ± 86.8 pA in the first 5 min to 277.1 ± 50.3 pA after 30 min of treatment) by SHP-1 wt or SHP-1 S6 in the pipette (n = 4, p < 0.05). It was restored to the control level after 500 μmpervanadate was added to the bath (455.8 ± 97 pA,n = 4, p > 0.05 versuscontrol cells).Figure 2The tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, pervanadate, reverses the inhibition by SHP-1. The ERG current was recorded as in Fig. 1. A, representative current traces at −120 mV; 0–5 min after beginning the recording (open square) with SHP-1 wt protein in the pipette (0.1 mg/ml), at 25–30 min (closed square), 20 min after adding 500 μm pervanadate to the bath solution (open circle), and 10 min after adding 3 μm E-4031 to the bath (closed circle). B, summary of the current amplitudes after 25–30 min of recordings normalized to the current in the first 0–5 min. Pipettes contained either SHP-1 wt or SHP-1 S6 (n = 2 each) proteins (0.1 mg/ml). Values are mean ± S.E. for the number of cells indicated. *, p < 0.05 compared with the current at 0–5 min; #, p < 0.01 compared with the current without pervanadate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) MLS-9 cells were co-transfected with a construct expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (pEGFP-C1) and an empty vector (control) or a vector containing SHP-1 wt, SHP-1 S6, or SHP-1 Cys → Ser. We confirmed that transfections increased SHP-1 expression. Compared with vector controls, the amount of SHP-1 immunoreactive protein in cell batches increased by 2.1-fold after SHP-1 wt and 2.2-fold after SHP-1 Cys → Ser transfection (Fig. 3). This is a modest underestimate of the increase in protein per cell, because the transfection efficiencies were 60–75%. At 24–48 h after transfection, recordings were made from cells expressing green fluorescent protein (Fig. 4). There was no change in cell size with the different treatments, i.e. the average membrane capacitance was 17.5 ± 1.8 pF (n = 10) in vector control cells, 15.6 ± 0.9 pF (n = 21) in SHP-1 wt, 20.3 ± 1.5 pF (n = 12) in SHP-1 S6, and 16.9 ± 0.8 pF (n = 6) in SHP-1 Cys → Ser-transfected cells (Student's t test with Bonferroni post-hoc test; p > 0.05). However, compared with vector controls (31.3 ± 2.4 pA/pF, n = 10), the peak ERG current density in SHP-1 wt (20.3 ± 1.8 pA/pF,n = 21) and SHP-1 S6 transfectants (20.0 ± 1.9 pA/pF, n = 12) was reduced by 35–40% (p < 0.01 versus vector control). The current in SHP-1 Cys → Ser transfectants was unchanged (29.0 ± 2.4 pA/pF, n = 6). Moreover, the changes in current density were not caused by decreases in channel or Src proteins. Rather, ERG-1 protein increased by 2.1-fold in SHP-1 wt and 1.8-fold in SHP-1 Cys → Ser transfectants (Fig. 3, p < 0.05versus vector controls), and Src levels were not decreased (data not shown).Figure 4Transfected SHP-1 variants modify the ERG current. For all transfectants, peak ERG currents at −120 mV, from a +20 mV holding potential, were monitored 5–10 min after establishing recordings. Left, representative current traces from one cell each transfected with vector (open square), SHP-1 wt (closed square), SHP-1 S6 (closed circle), and SHP-1 Cys → Ser (open circle).Right, currents from same cells, normalized to cell capacitance (current densities). At the end of each recording, currents were blocked with 3 μm E-4031 (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In principle, an SHP-1-induced decrease in ERG current could result from changes in voltage dependence or from faster deactivation or inactivation. We found previously (1Cayabyab F.S. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13673-13681Google Scholar) that ERG channel closing was slower when MLS-9 cells were transfected with an active v-Src tyrosine kinase, and this contributed to the observed increase in current. Therefore, we used transiently transfected MLS-9 cells to assess whether SHP-1 caused changes in biophysical properties of the currents. By using a voltage protocol (Fig. 5A) previously used to study HERG current deactivation (channel closing) (11Barros F. Gómez-Varela D. Vioria C.G. Palomero T. Giráldez T. De La Pena P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 511: 333-346Google Scholar), we found that the average time constants (Fig. 5C) were the same for vector control, SHP-1 wt, and SHP-1 S6 transfectants at all potentials tested. For all transfectants, deactivation was well fitted by a mono-exponential function. At −120 mV, the deactivation time constants were 98.8 ± 25.8 ms for the vector control (n = 8), 98.1 ± 12.3 ms for SHP-1 wt (n = 15), and 87.0 ± 6.0 ms for SHP-1 S6 (n = 17) (p > 0.05 (Student's t test with Bonferroni post hoc test; p > 0.05). The time course of current activation was not assessed because there was no outward activating current under the conditions of our study, i.e.normal internal and high external K+. Current inactivation was examined using a triple-pulse protocol (1Cayabyab F.S. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13673-13681Google Scholar, 8Shi W. Wymore R.S. Wang H.-S. Pan Z. Cohen I.S.

Such a pH change may affect synaptic transmissions in which G-protein-coupled inward rectifier K+ (GIRK) channels play a role.

A decrease in pHo to 6.2 augmented GIRK1/GIRK4 currents by ∼30%. The channel activation was reversible and dependent on pHo levels. This effect was produced by selective augmentation of single channel conductance without change in the open-state probability. To determine which subunit was involved, we took advantage of homomeric expression of GIRK1 and GIRK4 by introducing a single mutation. We found that homomeric GIRK1-F137S and GIRK4-S143T channels were activated at pHo 6.2 by ∼20 and ∼70%, respectively. Such activation was eliminated when a histidine residue in the M1-H5 linker was mutated to a non-titratable glutamine, i.e.H116Q in GIRK1 and H120Q in GIRK4. Both of these histidines were required for pH sensing of the heteromeric channels, because the mutation of one of them diminished but not abolished the pHosensitivity. The pHo sensitivity of the heteromeric channels was completely lost when both were mutated. Thus, these results suggest that the GIRK-mediated synaptic transmission is determined by both neurotransmitter and protons with the transmitter accounting for only 70% of the effect on postsynaptic cell and protons released together with the transmitter contributing to the other 30%.

Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Another potentially important modulator of the GIRK channels is hydrogen ion. Increasing evidence indicates that H+ can act as a messenger modulating multiple cellular functions (24Yuli I. Oplatka A. Science. 1987; 235: 340-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, protons have been shown to modulate synaptic transmission, neuronal plasticity, and membrane excitability (25Kaila K. Ransom B.R. pH and Brain Function. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 3-10Google Scholar). It is known that the pH level in synaptic vesicles is ∼1.5 pH units lower than in cytosol (26Liu Y. Edwards R.H. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 125-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). These protons are released from synaptic vesicles together with neurotransmitters during synaptic transmission, leading to extracellular acidification in the synaptic cleft (27Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar). If the GIRK channels are sensitive to extracellular pH (pHo), such extracellular acidification can have a major impact on synaptic transmission. Indeed, certain unidentified GIRK channels in the brainstem that play a part in the generation and control of central respiratory activity have been suggested being sensitive to hypercapnic acidosis (28Smith J.C.

It is possible that the GIRK channels are pH-sensitive, because several inward rectifier K+ channels are directly gated by intracellular and/or extracellular protons. To test the hypothesis that the GIRK channels are modulated by pHo, we performed experiments on the heteromeric GIRK1/GIRK4 channels. Our results indicate that these channels are augmented by extracellular acidification through an increase in single channel conductance, and such activation relies on a histidine residue in the extracellular loop. Experiments were performed as we described previously (32Zhu G. Chanchevalap S. Cui N. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (London). 1999; 516: 699-710Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 33Qu Z. Zhu G. Yang Z.

Oocytes from Xenopus laevis were used in this study. Frogs were anesthetized by bathing them in 0.3% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. A few lobes of ovaries were removed after a small abdominal incision (∼5 mm). The surgical incision then was closed, and the frogs were allowed to recover from the anesthesia.Xenopus oocytes were treated with 2 mg/ml collagenase (Type IA, Sigma) in the OR2 solution (in mm) as follows: 82 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.4, for 60 min at room temperature. After three washes (10 min each) of the oocytes with the OR2 solution, cDNAs (25–50 ng in 50 nl water) were injected into the oocytes. The oocytes were then incubated at 18 °C in the ND-96 solution containing (in mm) 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, and 2.5 sodium pyruvate with 100 mg/liter Geneticin added, pH 7.4. Rat GIRK1 (Kir3.1) cDNA (GenBankTM accession numberU01071) and rat GIRK4 (Kir3.4) cDNA (GenBankTMaccession number X83584) are gifts from Dr. Norman Davidson (California Institute of Technology). These cDNAs were subcloned into a eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and used forXenopus oocyte expression without in vitro cRNA synthesis. PCR was used to generate GIRK1/GIRK4 dimer. Two PCR fragments encoding the entire length of GIRK1 and GIRK4 were joined with an XbaI restriction site created using primers with the GIRK1 at the 5′ end and then cloned to the pcDNA3.1. Five extra amino acids (RCQQQ) were created between the C terminus of GIRK1 and the N terminus of GIRK4. We did not find any detectable effect of these additional residues on channel expression, current profile, and pH sensitivity. Site-specific mutations were made using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Correct constructions and mutations were confirmed with DNA sequencing. Whole-cell currents were studied on the oocytes 2–4 days after injection. Two-electrode voltage clamp was performed using an amplifier (Geneclamp 500, Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA) at room temperature (∼24 °C). The extracellular solution contained (in mm): 90 KCl, 3 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.4. Extracellular acidification was done by perfusing the oocytes with the extracellular solution containing PIPES buffer, pH 5.2 and 6.2. HEPES buffer was used for extracellular alkalization, pH 8.4. These buffers were chosen because their buffering ranges are suitable for these pH levels and none of them is membrane-permeable as shown in our previous studies (33Qu Z. Zhu G. Yang Z. Cui N. Li Y.

Several control experiments were done in which inward rectifying currents of oocytes receiving an injection of the expression vector or Kir2.1 channel were not affected by these PIPES and HEPES buffers. Currents were also measured at various pH points in oocytes receiving an injection of the expression vector or the pH-insensitive Kir2.1 as controls. Intracellular acidification was produced using 90 mm KHCO3 to replace all KCl (90 mm) in the extracellular solution, which acidified the cytosol to pH 6.6 (see “Results”). This solution was titrated to pH 7.4 immediately before use (33Qu Z. Zhu G. Yang Z. Cui N. Li Y. Chanchevalap S. Sulaiman S. Haynie H. Jiang C. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2000; 183: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). pHo and intracellular pH (pHi) were measured using ion-selective microelectrodes as we detailed previously (34Xu H. Cui N. Yang Z. Wu J. Giwa L.R. Abdulkadir L. Sharma P. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12898-12902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 50Zhu G.Y. Chanchevalap S. Liu C. Xu H. Jiang C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Two single-barreled microelectrodes were employed. One of them (ion-selective) was exposed to hexamethyldisilazan vapor (Fluka Chemie AG, Buchs, Switzerland) for 30 min and then baked at 125 °C for 8 h. The tip of the ion-selective microelectrode was filled with H+ liquid exchanger (Hydrogen Ion Ionophore l-Mixture A, Fluka Chemie AG), and the remainder of the microelectrode was backfilled with phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, for both pHi and pHo measurements. This ionophore is greatly selective for H+ (e.g. H+:K+, Na+ or Ca2+ > 1,000,000:1). The other microelectrode was filled with 3 m KCl. Electrodes were used only if they had high frequency response (90% response time ≤ 5 s) and showed an excellent sensitivity (a voltage change > 55 mV when pH changed from 6.0 to 7.0). A high input-resistance amplifier (Duo773, World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) was used for pH measurements. The ion-selective electrode was connected to the high input-resistance channel (1015ohms), and the KCl electrode was connected to the other (1012 ohm). Voltage was removed by subtracting records between these two channels. Serial calibrations of ion-selective microelectrodes were made with potassium phosphate buffer at pH 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0 (Fisher Scientific). The time profile of current response to pHo was studied using a perfusion chamber with a total volume of 1 ml (RC-3Z, Warner Instruments, New Haven, CT). The current amplitude was plotted against time together with pHo measured using a H+-selective electrode (34Xu H. Cui N. Yang Z. Wu J. Giwa L.R. Abdulkadir L. Sharma P. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12898-12902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 45Xu H. Yang Z. Cui N. Giwa L.R. Abdulkadir L. Patel M. Sharma P. Shan G. Shen W. Jiang C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1464-C1471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pH electrode was positioned in the extracellular solution near the cell. When the extracellular solution was switched to a low pH perfusate, the pHo started to change in ∼1 min and reached a plateau level in ∼3 min. Single channel currents were studied in outside-out patch configuration using solutions containing equal concentrations of K+applied to the bath and recording pipettes. The bath solution contained (in mm): 140 KCl, 10 Na2H2P2O7, 5 NaF, 0.1 Na3VO3, 0.2 ATP, 0.2 GTP, 10 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. The pipette was filled with the same solution (32Zhu G. Chanchevalap S. Cui N. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (London). 1999; 516: 699-710Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The open-state probability (P o) was calculated as we described previously (32Zhu G. Chanchevalap S. Cui N. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (London). 1999; 516: 699-710Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The single channel conductance was measured in negative membrane potential using a ramp command potential (from −100 to 100 mV). To change pHo, the patch membrane was perfused with solutions in different pH levels with no dead space. Data are presented as the means ± S.E. ANOVA or Student'st test was used. The differences of pH effects beforeversus during exposures were considered to be statistically significant if p ≤ 0.05. Whole-cell currents were studied in the two-electrode voltage-clamp mode using an extracellular solution containing 90 mm K+ (see “Materials and Methods”). Depolarizing and hyperpolarizing command pulses were given to the cell in a range from −140 mV (or −160 mV) to 100 mV with a 20-mV increment at a holding potential of 0 mV. Under this condition, inward rectifying currents were observed 2–4 days after coinjection of GIRK1 and GIRK4 cDNAs. The GIRK1/GIRK4 currents showed a clear inward rectification (Fig.1 A) and were sensitive to micromolar concentrations of Ba2+ (data not shown). These currents should be recorded from the heteromeric GIRK1/GIRK4 rather than the homomeric channels, because similar inward rectifying currents were seen following an injection of a tandem dimer of GIRK1/GIRK4 cDNA (data not shown). Exposure of the oocytes to a perfusate of pH 6.2 augmented the heteromeric GIRK/GIRK4 currents (Fig.1 A). Evident increase in the GIRK/GIRK4 currents was seen within 1 min into the exposure and reached the maximal level in 3–4 min (Fig. 1 B). Washout with the pH 7.4 perfusate led to a clear recovery (Fig. 1 A). When the current amplitude was plotted together with pHo against time, the current response curve was almost identical to the pHo profile with only an ∼0.5-min delay (Fig. 1 B). This effect was not produced by a change in pHi, because the perfusate containing membrane-impermeable PIPES buffer does not change pHi as shown in our previous studies (33Qu Z. Zhu G. Yang Z. Cui N. Li Y. Chanchevalap S. Sulaiman S. Haynie H. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13783-13789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 34Xu H. Cui N. Yang Z. Wu J. Giwa L.R. Abdulkadir L. Sharma P. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12898-12902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To strengthen this argument, we selectively reduced pHi to 6.6 without changing pHousing 90 mm bicarbonate as demonstrated previously (34Xu H. Cui N. Yang Z. Wu J. Giwa L.R. Abdulkadir L. Sharma P. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12898-12902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,50Zhu G.Y. Chanchevalap S. Liu C. Xu H. Jiang C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Such intracellular acidification for 10 min did not produce any significant increase in the GIRK1/GIRK4 currents (n = 6, data not shown). Thus, these results indicate that extracellular acidification augments the GIRK1/GIRK4 currents. Fig. 1 C shows concentration dependence of the GIRK/GIRK4 currents on the pHo levels. The currents were moderately stimulated at pHo 6.8 and inhibited at pHo 8.4. The maximal activation occurred at pHo 6.2, whereas a further drop in pHo to 5.2 did not have any additional effect, suggesting that the most sensitive pH range of the GIRK/GIRK4 channels is between pH 7.0 and 7.4. At the maximal activation with pHo 6.2, the amplitude of heteromeric GIRK/GIRK4 currents was enhanced by 33.4 ± 3.6% (n = 11). Similar channel activation was also observed in the tandem-dimeric GIRK1/GIRK4 channel whose amplitude increased by 33.9 ± 3.6% (n = 6). To understand how single channel properties and voltage dependence underlie the change in whole-cell currents, we performed single channel recordings in the outside-out patch configuration. The heteromeric GIRK/GIRK4 channels showed low base-line activity at pH 7.4 in the absence of exogenous G-protein. These currents had single channel conductance of 28.0 ± 0.4 picoSiemens (n = 6) (Fig.2 A). Exposure of external patch membranes to a perfusate of pH 6.2 enhanced the single channel conductance by 29.8 ± 2.9% (n = 6) (Fig.2 B). Unlike the single channel conductance, theP o did not show significant change with pHo 6.2 (p > 0.05, n = 9) (Fig. 2, C–F). In whole-cell recordings, the increase in GIRK1/GIRK4 currents at acidic pHo did not show any voltage dependence in a voltage range from −160 to 0 mV (Fig. 2,G–I). Thus, the increase in whole-cell currents at acidic pHo is likely to be produced by augmentation of the single channel conductance. To elucidate which subunit is responsible for proton sensing, homomeric expression of these GIRK channels was carried out. It is known that the homomeric GIRK1 and GIRK4 produce only small currents with or without Gβγ-subunits, whereas the small currents are probably derived from heteromeric channels formed by Xenopus endogenous GIRK5 with the exogenous GIRK subunits (35Vivaudou M.

Neuron. 1996; 16: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, previous studies have demonstrated that the mutation of a single amino acid residue in the pore-forming sequence (P) allows both GIRK1 and GIRK4 to be expressed homomerically (35Vivaudou M. Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Jan L.Y. Reuveny E. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31553-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This homomeric expression technique has been conducive to elucidating the modulation of GIRK channels by several modulators (11Zhang J. Kong C. Xie H. McPherson P.S. Grinstein S. Trimble W.S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1458-1467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 35Vivaudou M. Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Jan L.Y. Reuveny E. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14855-14860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, we constructed the GIRK1 with Phe-137 mutated to serine (GIRK1-F137S) and GIRK4 with Ser-143 mutated to threonine (GIRK4-S143T) as shown previously by Vivaudou et al. (35Vivaudou M. Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Jan L.Y. Reuveny E. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31553-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Consistent with their results, functional expressions of both these homomeric GIRK1 and GIRK4 channels were seen with the mutations (Fig. 3, A andB). When the channels were challenged with extracellular acidosis (pHo 6.2), the amplitude of the homomeric GIRK1 and GIRK4 currents increased by 21.0 ± 2.9% (n = 9) and 66.7 ± 6.2% (n = 6), respectively (Fig.3 C). These data indicated that both GIRK1 and GIRK4 possess proton-sensing mechanism with the one in GIRK4 more prominent. If these GIRK channels are inherently sensitive to protons, there should be specific protein domain or amino acid residue that is accessible to extracellular protons and responsible for the pHo-induced channel activation. To test this hypothesis, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on potentially titratable histidine residues, an amino acid with its side-chain pK of 6.04 most close to pHolevels for the channel activation. Therefore, we examined amino acid sequences from the first membrane-spanning helix (M1), the P-loop, to the second membrane-spanning sequence (M2) helix and found a histidine in the M1-P linker (Fig. 4 A). The sequence alignment using the BLAST 2 sequences shows that this histidine is conserved in all GIRK channels but not seen in any other Kir channels (Fig. 4 A). Thereafter, we site-specifically mutated this histidine to a neutral polar glutamine. We found that the histidine mutation totally abolished the pHo sensitivity in both homomeric GIRK1-F137S and GIRK4-S143T channels (Figs. 4,B and C, and5 A), indicating that the histidine residue is the proton sensor in these homomeric channels.Figure 5Effects of histidine mutations on homomeric and heteromeric GIRK channels. A, mutation of His-116 and His-120 abolished the pHo sensitivity of homomeric GIRK1 and GIRK4 channels, respectively. These mutant channels responded to pHo 6.2 similarly to Kir2.1 known as a pH-insensitive channel.I, current. B, in the heteromeric GIRK1/GIRK4 channels, mutations of any of these histidine residues alone reduced but not eliminated the pHo sensitivity. The heteromeric channels became pHo-insensitive only when both of these histidines were replaced with a non-titratable residue. Data are presented as the means ± S.E. (n = 4–9).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the homomeric GIRK4-S143T is more sensitive to pHo than the GIRK1-F137S, it is possible that the His-120 in GIRK4 plays a more important role in the pHo sensitivity of the heteromeric GIRK1/GIRK4 channels. To test this hypothesis, we studied the heteromeric channels with the mutation of the histidine residue in GIRK1 and/or GIRK4. We found that heteromeric channels carrying any one of the histidines (GIRK1-H116Q/GIRK4, GIRK1/GIRK4-H120Q) remained pHo-sensitive, although their pHo sensitivity was significantly lower than the wild-type channels. Simultaneous mutations of the histidine in both GIRK1 and GIRK4 (GIRK1H116Q-GIRK4H120Q) completely eliminated the pHo sensitivity of the heteromeric channels (Figs. 5 B and 6). Thus, these results suggest that all four histidine residues in both GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits are involved in proton sensing in their heteromeric channels. This is the first demonstration of the pHo sensitivity in the GIRK channels. We have found that the heteromeric GIRK1/GIRK4 are stimulated by extracellular acidification and inhibited by alkalization. A decrease in pHo to 6.2 enhances the GIRK1/GIRK4 currents by ∼30%, which has been observed in both GIRK1/GIRK4 coexpression and the tandem-dimeric channel. The increase in whole-cell currents is attributed to augmentation of the single-channel conductance without changes in P o and voltage dependence. A histidine residue in the extracellular domain is crucial, a mutation of which eliminates the pH sensitivity of the homomeric channels, whereas the pH sensitivity in the heteromeric GIRK1/GIRK4 channels requires this histidine in both subunits. The GIRK1/GIRK4 channels are activated by extracellular but not intracellular acidification for the following reasons. 1) In our previous studies, we have previously shown that a decrease in extracellular pH does not cause intracellular acidification using the same PIPES buffer (32Zhu G. Chanchevalap S. Cui N. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (London). 1999; 516: 699-710Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 33Qu Z. Zhu G. Yang Z. Cui N. Li Y. Chanchevalap S. Sulaiman S. Haynie H. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13783-13789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 2) Our data indicate that augmentation of these currents is associated with a change in pHo. 3) A decrease in pHi does not enhance the currents. 4) Similar current augmentation was seen in excised patched. Thus, the increase in current amplitude seen in this study should be produced by pHoindeed. Biophysical mechanisms underlying the change of whole-cell currents were examined in this study. Our data indicate that the increase in whole-cell currents is produced by selective augmentation of single-channel conductance without affecting the open-state probability and the voltage dependence. The channel activation is reversible and dependent on pH levels. The linear working range of the GIRK1/GIRK4 heteromeric channels is between pH 7.0 and 7.4, suggesting that the heteromeric GIRK1/GIRK4 channels can detect pH changes in most physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions. Several members of K+ channels in the Kir family are known to be pH-sensitive, such as Kir1.1, Kir1.2, Kir2.3, Kir2.4, Kir4.1, Kir6.1, Kir6.2, and heteromeric Kir4.1-Kir5.1 (34Xu H. Cui N. Yang Z.

In comparison with other Kir channels, the GIRK1/GIRK4 heteromeric channels are characterized by 1) sensitivity to pHo, which make them similar only to the Kir2.3 (32Zhu G. Chanchevalap S. Cui N.

In contrast, most of the Kir channels are inhibited by acidic pH with the proton sensors mostly located on the cytosolic side of the plasma membranes (39Tsai T.D. Shuck M.E. Thompson D.P.

The proton detection in the GIRK1/GIRK4 channels depends on a histidine residue in the extracellular protein domain. The pHo sensitivity of GIRK1 and GIRK4 homomeric channels is lost when this histidine residue is mutated to a non-titratable amino acid. Thus, the pH sensing in these GIRK channels is similar to several other Kir channels as shown previously (46Chanchevalap S. Yang Z. Cui N. Qu Z. Zhu G. Liu C. Giwa L.R. Abdulkadir L. Jiang C. J.

This histidine residue is conserved among all GIRK channels, suggesting that other GIRK subunits (i.e. GIRK2, GIRK3) are probably pH-sensitive as well. Because this histidine does not exist in other Kir channels, these results may explain why most of them, with the exception of Kir2.3 that is inhibited by both intracellular and extracellular acidifications and is also regulated by G-proteins (see Refs. 32Zhu G. Chanchevalap S. Cui N. Jiang C. J. Physiol. (London). 1999; 516: 699-710Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 40Coulter K.L. Perier F. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32301-32305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), are insensitive to pHo. One interesting finding from our current studies is the graded pHo sensitivity of the heteromeric GIRK1/GIRK4 channels with the histidine mutation. We have found that mutation of the histidine in either GIRK1 or GIRK4 leads to a reduction but not elimination of the pHo sensitivity, whereas the heteromeric channel loses the pHo sensitivity only when both histidines in GIRK1 and GIRK4 are simultaneously mutated. Based on this observation, it is possible that the GIRK channel modulation by extracellular protons requires protonation of this histidine residue in all four subunits and perhaps movements of these extracellular protein domains as well. The pHo sensitivity of these GIRK channels has a profound impact on synaptic transmission. In the presynaptic terminals, neurotransmitter uptake relies on ATP-dependent proton pumps whose activity results in acidification inside synaptic vesicles up to 1.5 pH units lower than cytosolic pH (26Liu Y. Edwards R.H. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 125-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Following each action potential at presynaptic terminals, protons are released with neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. This has been shown to lead to significant extracellular acidification in the synaptic cleft (27Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar). As the GIRK channels are major targets of the neurotransmitters on the postsynaptic membranes, the pHo sensitivity provides these channels with an important modulatory mechanism by which they are first activated by neurotransmitters, and subsequently, channel activity is further enhanced by protons released from presynaptic terminals. Such a modulatory mechanism appears to enhance greatly the synaptic efficiency, because according to our data, the neurotransmitter accounts for only 70% of the synaptic transmission and protons released together with the transmitter contribute to the other 30%. How does the pHo sensitivity affect specificity of synaptic transmission? Our results show that extracellular protons do not seem to affect GIRK channel gating, because they act on single channel conductance and augment the GIRK channels by 33% at most. Therefore, the synaptic cleft acidification should have very little effect on the GIRK channels before they are opened by specific neurotransmitters. Such a modulation instead of channel gating may prevent these channels from being activated by protons released with irrelevant neurotransmitters. This is remarkable, because protons released from presynaptic terminals may contribute significantly to the GIRK-mediated synaptic transmission without compromising synaptic specificity. Thus, the demonstration of the modulation of GIRK1/GIRK4 channels by extracellular acidification contributes valuable information to the understanding of these GIRK channels and their function in synaptic transmission.

Suramin, a polysulfonated napthylurea, displaces both forms of calmodulin, leading to an inhibition of activity at low Ca2+ and an enhancement of activity at high Ca2+. Calmodulin binding motifs on RYR1 are also able to directly interact with the carboxy-terminal tail of the transverse tubule dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) (Sencer, S., Papineni, R. V., Halling, D. B., Pate, P., Krol, J., Zhang, J. Z., and Hamilton, S. L. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 38237–38241). Suramin binds directly to a peptide that corresponds to the calmodulin binding site of RYR1 (amino acids 3609–3643) and blocks the interaction of this peptide with both calmodulin and the carboxyl-terminal tail of the DHPR α1-subunit. Suramin, added to the internal solution of voltage-clamped skeletal myotubes, produces a concentration-dependent increase in the maximal magnitude of voltage-gated Ca2+ transients without significantly altering L-channel Ca2+ channel conducting activity. Together, these results suggest that an interaction between the carboxyl-terminal tail of the DHPR α1-subunit with the calmodulin binding region of RYR1 serves to limit sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release during excitation-contraction coupling and that suramin-induced potentiation of voltage-gated Ca2+ release involves a relief of this inhibitory interaction.

Two distinct mechanisms are postulated to contribute to the release of Ca2+ from the SR in skeletal muscle. After sarcolemmal depolarization, SR Ca2+release channels are initially activated via mechanical coupling with DHPRs (or L-type Ca2+ channels) located in the surface membrane (2Beeler Jr., G.W. Reuter H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1970; 207: 191-209Crossref Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, morphological data indicate that only every other SR Ca2+ release channel is directly coupled with sarcolemmal DHPRs (3Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Adjacent, non-DHPR-coupled release channels (4Franzini-Armstrong C. Kish J.W. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) are thought to be activated either by Ca2+ released via the mechanically coupled channels (3Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F.

C3635, located within the putative CaM binding region of RYR1, has been postulated to contribute to oxidation-induced intersubunit cross-linking (14Zhang J.Z. Wu Y. Williams B.Y. Rodney G. Mandel F. Strasburg G.M. Hamilton S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C46-C53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was recently demonstrated to be the site of CaM-dependent NO modulation of RYR1 (15Sun J. Xin C. Eu J. Stamler J.S. Meissner G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11158-11162Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Studies of the interaction of both the DHPR and RYR1 with apoCaM and Ca2+CaM have been primarily carried out with uncoupled channels, raising the question of whether CaM interacts with either channel when the two proteins are mechanically coupled in intact skeletal muscle. Slavik et al. (12Slavik K.J. Wang J.P. Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Mandel F. Malouf N. Hamilton S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1475-C1481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) provided evidence that a sequence within the carboxyl terminus of the DHPR α1-subunit interacts strongly with RYR1. This sequence was later shown to also be a CaM binding motif (13Pate P. Mochca-Morales J. Wu Y. Zhang J.Z. Rodney G.G. Serysheva I.I. Williams B.Y. Anderson M.E. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol.

Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38237-38241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the CaM binding site on RYR1 binds directly to the carboxyl-terminal tail of the DHPR α1-subunit. These findings suggest that the CaM binding motifs on the DHPR and RYR1 proteins may actually function as protein-protein interaction motifs rather than strictly as CaM binding domains. However, the functionally relevant binding partners for these motifs have not yet been identified. If the DHPR and RYR1 proteins utilize CaM binding motifs for binding to one another, then CaM could potentially uncouple the mechanical link formed between the CaM binding site of RYR1 and the carboxyl-terminal tail of the DHPR α1-subunit. However, the functional consequences of such CaM-mediated uncoupling have yet to be evaluated. Suramin, a polysulfonated napthylurea is a potent, reversible activator of the RYR, increasing both conductance and P 0of the channel (16Sitsapesan R. Williams A.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 153: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Klinger et al. (17Klinger M. Bofill-Cardona E. Mayer B. Nanoff C. Freissmuth M. Hohenegger M. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 827-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) found that suramin inhibits the RYR1-CaM interaction, possibly by competing for the CaM binding domain on RYR1. Suko et al. (18Suko J. Hellmann G. Drobny H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 543-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) studied the effects of suramin on the single channel behavior of RYR1 and on [3H]ryanodine binding and found that RYR1 channels reconstituted in planar lipid bilayers are activated by high concentrations (0.3–0.9 mm) of suramin. This effect appeared to be due to an increased affinity of the Ca2+activating site on RYR1 for Ca2+. These authors suggested that the complex functional effects of suramin arise from an allosteric regulation of the channel and not from alterations in the binding of endogenous ligands (e.g. CaM) involved in channel gating. In the current study, we demonstrate that suramin binds directly to a peptide corresponding to the CaM binding motif on RYR1 and that suramin blocks the interaction of this peptide with the carboxyl-terminal region of the DHPR α1-subunit. Moreover, suramin potentiates voltage-gated SR Ca2+ release in whole cell voltage-clamped skeletal myotubes, consistent with the idea that suramin disrupts an intrinsic inhibitory interaction between the DHPR carboxyl terminus and the CaM binding domain on RYR1. Bovine brain CaM, suramin, and dithiothreitol were obtained from Sigma. Tran35S-label (>1000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Irvine, CA). [3H]Ryanodine was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and unlabeled ryanodine was purchased from Calbiochem. A fluorescent derivative of CaM, Alexa Fluor™ 594-conjugated CaM (Alexa CaM), was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The peptides were synthesized in the core facility at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX). SR and transverse tubule-enriched membranes were prepared from rabbit hind leg and back-strap skeletal muscle and purified using sucrose gradient centrifugation (19Hawkes M.J. Diaz-Munoz M. Hamilton S.L. Membr. Biochem. 1989; 8: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated by the method of Lowry using bovine serum albumin as the standard (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mammalian CaM was generously provided by Dr. Ruth Altschuld. Metabolic labeling of calmodulin with Tran35S-label was performed according to a procedure described previously (7Rodney G.G. Williams B.Y. Strasburg G.M. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7807-7812Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled CaM binding to SR membranes (10 μg) was determined as described previously (7Rodney G.G. Williams B.Y. Strasburg G.M. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7807-7812Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The binding buffer contained 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, and 1 mm EGTA with 1.2 mmCaCl2 (high Ca2+ binding buffer, 200 μm free Ca2+) or 1 mm EGTA alone (low Ca2+ binding buffer, 10 nm free Ca2+). Samples were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Bound radioligand was separated from free by filtration through Whatman GF/F filters and washing 5 times with 3 ml of the ice-cold binding buffer. 20-μg SR membranes per assay were incubated with 5 nm [3H]ryanodine at room temperature for 17 h in binding buffer (300 mm NaCl, 50 mmMOPS (pH 7.4), 0.1% CHAPS, and either 1 mm EGTA or 1.2 mm CaCl2). Nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of unlabeled ryanodine (final concentration of 10 μm). Bound [3H]ryanodine was separated from free by filtering through Whatman GF/F glass fiber filters and washing 5 times with 3 ml of ice-cold binding buffer. The radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting. The interaction of suramin and R3609–43 was determined by monitoring the changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of R3609–43. The fluorescence was recorded on a ISS PC1 photon counting spectrophotometer (Champaign, IL). R3609–43 in the presence of different concentrations of suramin was excited at 295 nm (UV-solar pass filter), and emission spectra (320–450 mm) were recorded with a “Cut-on” filter of 309 nm. Suramin inhibition of Alexa-CaM-R3609–43 binding was determined by monitoring the changes in emission of Alexa CaM recorded on an ISS PC1 photon-counting spectrophotometer. Samples of Alexa CaM (1 μm) alone or in the presence of R3609–43 (1 μm) were incubated with 10 μm suramin for 30 min at room temperature. The samples in 100-μl cuvettes (Starna Cells, Atascadero, CA) were excited at 594 nm (Cut-on filter of 550 nm), and the emission at 622 nm was collected as relative fluorescence units with a Cut-on filter of 595 nm. The electrophoretic mobility of CaM was evaluated by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under discontinuous conditions as a modified technique described by Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). Nondenaturing gels (20% polyacrylamide) were separated at 30 mA under high Ca2+conditions (200 μm CaCl2 in the gel buffers). Pull-down assays were performed using a biotinylated R3609–43 peptide and streptavidin beads. Briefly, transverse tubule-enriched membranes (1 mg/ml in 150 mmKCl, 25 mm NaCl, 100 μm CaCl2, 50 mm MOPS (pH7.4)) were solubilized with 1% CHAPS. Aliquots (50 μl) of the solubilized membranes were added to streptavidin beads (50 μl) that had been preincubated for 1 h with 40 μm R3609–43. After gently mixing for 1 h at room temperature the beads were pelleted for 1 min in a low speed centrifuge, and the supernatant was removed. An additional 300 μl of buffer was then added, the sample was vortexed, and the beads were once again pelleted. After the addition of 100 μl of H2O, beads were extracted with SDS and electrophoresed on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and either stained or Western-blotted with the indicated antibodies. Analysis of the interaction between R3609–43 and the recombinantly expressed carboxyl-terminal fragment of DHPR α1-subunit was determined as follows. The cDNA encoding the skeletal DHPR amino acids α1-1393–1527 (D1393–1527) was used to express His-tagged recombinant protein as described by Sencer et al. (1Sencer S. Papineni R.V. Halling D.B. Pate P. Krol J. Zhang J.Z. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38237-38241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The His-tagged protein was coupled to nickel chelate assay plates as recommended by the manufacturer (BD Biosciences). 1 μm biotinylated R3609–43 (150 mm KCl, 25 mm NaCl, 100 μm CaCl2, 50 mm MOPS (pH7.4)) in the presence of various concentrations of suramin was added to the wells, and the plates were mixed at 100 rpm for 1 h at room temperature. The bound biotinylated R3609–43 was calorimetric-assayed using avidin-conjugated alkaline phosphate enzyme (1:1000), andp-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate/chromogen. The reaction was measured at 405 nm on a SpectraMax microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Myotubes were prepared from the skeletal muscle of newborn mice as previously described (22Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D.

Voltage-gated Ca2+ currents and Ca2+ transients were recorded using the whole cell patch clamp technique. The pipette solution for all experiments was 145 mm cesium aspartate, 0.1 mmCs2-EGTA, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MgATP, 0.2 mm K5-Fluo-3, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. For suramin experiments, suramin (5 or 50 μm) was also included in the internal solution. The external solution for all experiments was 145 mmtriethylammonium chloride, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 0.003 mm tetrodotoxin (pH 7.4). Peak l-currents were normalized to cell capacitance (pA/picofarads), plotted as a function of test potential and fitted according to the equation,I=Gmax×(Vm−Vrev)/{1+exp[VG1/2−Vm)/kG]}Equation 1 where G max is the maximal L-channel conductance, V m is test potential,V rev is the extrapolated reversal potential,V G1/2 is the potential for half-maximal activation of G max and, k G is a slope factor. Relative changes in cytosolic Ca2+ were measured using the Ca2+ indicator K5-Fluo-3 as described previously (24Avila G. O'Connell M.S. Groom L. Dirksen R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17732-17738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fluorescence traces were analog-filtered (τ = 0.5 ms) before digitization and expressed as ΔF/F 0, whereF 0 is the base-line fluorescence immediately before depolarization, and ΔF represents the fluorescence change from base line. Fluorescence amplitudes at the end of each test pulse are plotted as a function of test potential and fitted according to the equation,ΔF/F0=(ΔF/Fmax)/{1+exp[VF1/2−Vm)/kF]}Equation 2 where ΔF/F max is the calculated maximal change in fluorescence for each test potential (V m), V F1/2 is the potential for half-maximal activation of ΔF/F max, and k Fis a slope factor. Inhibition of 35S-labeled CaM binding to SR membranes was analyzed by non-linear regression (Sigma Plot 2000; Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) using the equation, y=Bmax/(1+Kd/[L])(1+x/Ki)Equation 3 where B max is the number of binding sites, K d is the apparent dissociation constant for 35S-labeled CaM binding, [L] is the concentration of 35S-CaM, y is the concentration of suramin, x is the amount bound, and K iis the apparent inhibitory constant for suramin. In gel shift assays, densitometry was performed on the peptide-bound CaM band. Optical density data obtained in the presence of suramin were normalized to the optical density of the peptide-CaM band alone and plotted as a function of suramin concentration. The data described are the mean ± S.E. for at least three independent determinations. Both RYR1 and CaM are Ca2+-binding proteins. Our studies comparing the interactions of a Ca2+binding site mutant of CaM and wild type CaM with RYR1 demonstrated that the affinities of both forms of CaM for RYR1 are greater at μm than at nm Ca2+concentrations, indicating that Ca2+ binding to RYR1 increases the affinity for CaM (7Rodney G.G. Williams B.Y. Strasburg G.M. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7807-7812Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Suramin inhibits CaM binding to RYR1 (17Klinger M. Bofill-Cardona E. Mayer B. Nanoff C. Freissmuth M. Hohenegger M. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 827-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To determine the affinity of the interaction of suramin with RYR1 we analyzed the concentration dependence for suramin inhibition of35S-labeled CaM binding to SR membranes at both nm and μm Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 1). K i values for suramin inhibition of CaM binding to RYR1 at 200 μmand <10 nm free Ca2+ concentrations were 1.7 ± 0.1 (n = 3) and 1.3 ± 0.14 μm (n = 3), respectively. These results indicate that suramin inhibits the interaction of both apoCaM and Ca2+-CaM with RYR1 in a manner that is not altered by Ca2+ binding to RYR1. The complete inhibition of35S-labeled CaM binding suggests that suramin binding to RYR1 is competitive with CaM. This is further supported by our finding that the rate of dissociation of 35S-labeled CaM from RYR1 is not altered by suramin (data not shown). The measured dissociation rate constants for 35S-labeled CaM bound to SR membranes are 0.33 ± 0.001 min−1 (n = 3) and 0.35 ± 0.002 min−1 (n = 3) in the absence and presence of suramin, respectively. The studies of Klinger et al. (17Klinger M. Bofill-Cardona E. Mayer B. Nanoff C. Freissmuth M. Hohenegger M. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 827-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) indicated that suramin binds competitively to the CaM binding domain on the RYR. However, Suko et al. (18Suko J. Hellmann G. Drobny H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 543-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) suggested that suramin effects on RYR channel function involve an allosteric mechanism that occurs in the absence of direct effects on endogenous ligands involved in channel gating. To address whether the suramin interaction with RYR1 is competitive or noncompetitive, we examined the ability of suramin to inhibit the interaction of a peptide corresponding to the CaM binding domain of RYR1 (R3609–3643) with CaM at both high and low Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 2). At 200 μm and <10 nm free Ca2+concentrations, suramin displaces CaM from R3609–3643. The inhibition was assessed by the changes in the fluorescence of Alexa CaM in the presence or absence of the peptide (R3609–3643). These results suggest a competitive interaction between suramin and CaM with the R3609–43 region of RYR1. Competitive inhibition by suramin of the interaction of CaM with R3609–43 was confirmed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 3, the ability of R3609–3643 to bind CaM on non-denaturing gels is completely inhibited at suramin concentrations above 10 μm. CaM binding to a peptide (D1665–1685) corresponding to the CaM binding domain of the carboxyl-terminal region of the DHPR α1-subunit (13Pate P. Mochca-Morales J. Wu Y. Zhang J.Z. Rodney G.G. Serysheva I.I. Williams B.Y. Anderson M.E. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39786-39792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) is not affected by suramin (Fig. 3). These results indicate that suramin inhibition of the binding of CaM is relatively selective to the CaM recognition sequence found in RYR1. To demonstrate direct binding between suramin and R3609–3643, we analyzed changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (excitation at 295 nm) of R3609–3643 in the presence and absence of 10 μm suramin (Fig. 4). The addition of suramin to R3609–43 peptide (Fig. 4 A) induced a shift in tryptophan emission spectra (from a peak at ∼350 nm in the absence of suramin to ∼420 nm in the presence of suramin). The suramin-induced shift in emission spectra arises from fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the single tryptophan residue of peptide R3609–43, acting as donor, and the naphthalene rings of suramin as acceptor. The addition of either free tryptophan (data not shown) or a control peptide representing amino acids 135–160 of RYR1 (R135–160) (Fig. 4 B) did not significantly affect suramin emission spectra. These findings further support a model in which suramin binds directly to the CaM binding region of RYR1 (residues 3609–3643). We assessed the ability of suramin to act as a competitive antagonist to Ca2+-CaM and apoCaM modulation of RYR1. [3H]Ryanodine binding is widely used to screen for effects of modulators on RYR activity. ApoCaM, like most RYR activators, increases [3H]ryanodine binding to RYR1, whereas Ca2+-CaM like other channel inhibitors decreases [3H]ryanodine binding to RYR1 (7Rodney G.G. Williams B.Y. Strasburg G.M. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7807-7812Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As expected, a decrease in [3H]ryanodine binding to RYR1 was observed in the presence of Ca2+-CaM (Fig.5 A), whereas apoCaM enhanced [3H]ryanodine binding to RYR1 (Fig. 5 B). These effects of CaM were overcome by increasing concentrations of suramin (from 0.1 to 10 μm), suggesting that suramin competes with CaM for a binding site on RYR1 over this concentration range. Higher suramin concentrations (>100 μm) resulted in both the displacement of endogenous FKBP12 and enhanced [3H]ryanodine binding to RYR independent of the presence of CaM (data not shown). Suramin at concentrations greater than 1 μm increases [3H]ryanodine binding to RYR1 even in the absence of added CaM (Fig. 5 A). The increase in [3H]ryanodine binding is likely due to displacement of endogenous calmodulin in these membranes by suramin. Consistent with this, Western blotting of these membranes with an antibody to calmodulin shows the presence of endogenous calmodulin that is partially displaced by 10 μm suramin (Fig.6 A). Endogenous CaM bound to RYR was, however, completely displaced by 10 μm suramin (Fig. 6 B). This was inferred from the amounts of CaM detected in the proteins extracted from the filters routinely used for binding assays. Moreover, the suramin-induced changes in [3H]ryanodine binding in the absence of added CaM was not observed when SR membranes were pre-washed extensively (Fig.6 C). The CaM binding motif of RYR1 physically interacts with the carboxyl terminus of the DHPR α1-subunit (1Sencer S. Papineni R.V. Halling D.B. Pate P. Krol J. Zhang J.Z. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38237-38241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We analyzed the effect of suramin on this interaction by assessing the ability of R3609–43 to pull down the DHPR from detergent-solubilized T-tubule membranes. In these experiments a biotinylated derivative of R3609–3643 (R3609–3643-biotin) and streptavidin beads was used to pull down DHPRs. Western blotting with anti-α1-DHPR antibodies of the pull-down fractions demonstrated that 50 μm suramin blocked the pull down of the DHPR α1-subunit (Fig.7 A). The effect of suramin on the interaction of R3609–43 and a recombinant protein fragment of carboxyl terminus of the DHPR α1-subunit (His-tagged D1393–1527) expressed in Escherichia coli was also analyzed. The interaction was completely inhibited by 10 μm suramin (Fig. 7 B). The carboxyl terminus of the DHPR α1-subunit (D1393–1527) has been shown to inhibit ryanodine binding to RYR1 (1Sencer S. Papineni R.V. Halling D.B. Pate P. Krol J. Zhang J.Z. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38237-38241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). D1393–1527 was isolated using nickel-chelated beads after thrombin cleavage to determine whether suramin could prevent inhibition of ryanodine binding. The D1393–1527 preparation contained His tag as a contaminant. 10 μm suramin completely attenuated the inhibition of [3H]ryanodine binding by D1393–1527 (Fig.7 C). The His tag by itself has no effect on the [3H]ryanodine binding to RYR1 (data not shown). Together these results indicate that suramin effectively uncouples the physical interaction between the carboxyl terminus of the DHPR α1-subunit and a peptide corresponding to the CaM binding site of RYR1. The results reported here demonstrate that suramin disrupts binding of both CaM and the carboxyl terminus of the DHPR α1-subunit to a peptide corresponding to the CaM binding domain of RYR1. To determine whether these effects alter excitation-contraction coupling in intact skeletal muscle cells, we measured L-type Ca2+ channel currents and voltage-gated SR Ca2+ release in normal myotubes in the presence and absence suramin. Because suramin is not membrane-permeant, 50 μmsuramin was included in the patch pipette internal solution (with buffer alone used as control), and recordings were made 5 min after establishing the whole cell configuration. For these experiments, 50 μm suramin was used because this concentration of suramin was found in biochemical experiments to maximally inhibit CaM binding to RYR1 (Figs. 1 and 3) and would, therefore, be likely to overcome potential limitations with regard to suramin dialysis and accessibility to junctional RYR1 proteins in patch-clamped myotubes. Maximal L-type Ca2+ channel conductance (G max) and the voltage required for half-maximal activation ofG max (V G1/2) were similar in the presence and absence of 50 μm internal suramin (Fig. 8 A and TableI). The lack of an effect of suramin on L-type Ca2+ channel activity is consistent with the finding reported here that suramin does not interact with the CaM binding region of the skeletal muscle DHPR. However, 50 μmsuramin caused a significant increase (67.9 ± 0.2%,n = 13; p < 0.05) in the maximal ΔF/F 0 without altering VF1/2, the voltage required for half-maximal release (Fig.8 B and Table I). The effects of suramin on maximal voltage-gated SR Ca2+ release were concentration-dependent since a smaller increase in maximal ΔF/F 0 was observed at a lower concentration (5 μm suramin: 39.7 ± 0.2%,n = 16; p < 0.05). The increase in maximal voltage-gated Ca2+ release could arise from either a direct stimulatory effect of suramin on activated SR Ca2+release channels or via a suramin-mediated disruption of an inhibitory interaction between the carboxyl-terminal region of the DHPR α1-subunit and the CaM binding domain of RYR1 (see “Discussion”).Table IParameters of I-V and F-V curvesI–VF–VnG max1-anS/nF, nanosiemens nanofarads.V G1/2knΔF/F maxV F1/2knS/nFmVmVmVmVControl12210 ± 1016.1 ± 1.76.1 ± 0.2122.7 ± 0.3−2.9 ± 1.95.2 ± 0.4Suramin13206 ± 2018.9 ± 1.65.3 ± 0.4134.5 ± 0.51-bp< 0.05.1.8 ± 2.05.3 ± 0.81-a nS/nF, nanosiemens nanofarads.1-b p< 0.05. Open table in a new tab Our results indicate that suramin inhibits both Ca2+-CaM and apoCaM binding to RYR1 with nearly identicalK i values (∼1–2 μm), suggesting that inhibition by suramin is independent of Ca2+ binding to both CaM and RYR1. A recent study (17Klinger M. Bofill-Cardona E. Mayer B. Nanoff C. Freissmuth M. Hohenegger M. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 827-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) reported that a suramin IC50 for inhibition of Ca2+-CaM binding to RYR1 be ∼10-fold higher than we are reporting. The reason for the different apparent affinity of suramin for RYR1 is not clear but may be related to the use of 125I-labeled CaM in their studyversus 35S-labeled CaM in the current study. We have previously demonstrated that the iodination of CaM using the Bolton-Hunter reagent can produce substantial artifacts in the analysis of CaM binding to RYR1 (10Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Suramin was found to bind to and competitively inhibit CaM binding to a peptide (R3609–43) that corresponds to the CaM binding region of RYR1. Therefore, suramin would be expected to compete with CaM for binding to RYR1 proteins that are not interacting with the DHPR (e.g.purified RYR1 proteins or adjacent non-coupled RYR1 proteins present within SR-T tubule junctions). At low Ca2+ concentrations, CaM is an activator of RYR1, whereas at high Ca2+concentrations CaM inhibits RYR1 activity. Accordingly, if suramin competes with CaM for binding to RYR1, then suramin would inhibit RYR1 channel activity at low Ca2+ and activate RYR1 channels at high Ca2+. These predictions are consistent with our findings with isolated SR vesicles that suramin reduces [3H]ryanodine binding at nm Ca2+and enhances [3H]ryanodine binding at μmCa2+, with the most pronounced effects at both Ca2+ concentrations observed with added CaM (Fig. 5). Suramin is apparently selective for certain types of CaM binding motifs since it does not inhibit CaM binding to the CaM binding domain of the carboxyl-terminal region of the DHPR α1-subunit (Fig. 3). Because there is considerable difference in the primary sequence of the putative CaM binding domains of these two proteins, it seems likely that these differences form the basis of suramin RYR1 selectivity. This observation is also in agreement with the report by Klinger et al. (17Klinger M. Bofill-Cardona E. Mayer B. Nanoff C. Freissmuth M. Hohenegger M. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 827-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) who found that suramin discriminates among different CaM binding motifs. Our data demonstrate that suramin competes effectively for binding to the CaM binding site on RYR1. We have previously suggested that the CaM binding motif on RYR1 not only binds CaM but also interacts strongly with the carboxyl-terminal tail of the DHPR α1-subunit (1Sencer S. Papineni R.V. Halling D.B. Pate P. Krol J. Zhang J.Z. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38237-38241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the DHPR carboxyl terminus significantly inhibits RYR1 activity as assessed by effects on [3H]ryanodine binding to SR membranes (1Sencer S. Papineni R.V. Halling D.B. Pate P. Krol J. Zhang J.Z. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38237-38241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and on the activity of Ca2+release channels reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers (12Slavik K.J. Wang J.P. Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Mandel F. Malouf N. Hamilton S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1475-C1481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the pull down of the detergent-solubilized DHPRs using biotinylated R3609–43 peptide and streptavidin beads is blocked by suramin. Also, suramin relieves the RYR1 inhibition by the carboxy-terminal tail of the DHPR α1-subunit (Fig.7 C). Combined with our previous findings, these data suggest that suramin may have very different effects on DHPR-coupled and non-DHPR-coupled RYR1s. As outlined above, suramin should block the interaction of uncoupled channels with CaM, resulting in inhibition of activity at low Ca2+ levels and enhancement at high Ca2+. However, because the carboxyl-terminal tail of the DHPR α1-subunit inhibits RYR1 activity at both high and low Ca2+ levels, then suramin would be expected to increase the activity of DHPR-coupled RYR1 channels by relieving inhibition mediated by the DHPR carboxyl terminus. Consistent with this model, suramin significantly augmented maximal voltage-gated SR Ca2+ release in whole cell voltage-clamped mouse myotubes in a manner that occurred in the absence of effects on the Ca2+-conducting activity of the DHPR. This finding supports the model in which suramin acts specifically on modulating RYR1 activity. Two possible explanations exist for suramin potentiation of voltage-gated SR Ca2+ release. First of all, the DHPR carboxyl terminus-RYR1 interaction may act to stabilize a closed/inactivated state of the release channel after membrane depolarization, thus limiting SR Ca2+ release during excitation-contraction coupling. Suramin competition at this site would act to counter this inhibitory interaction and result in increased Ca2+ release channel open probability and a potentiation of SR Ca2+ release. Alternatively, our data cannot rule out a possible direct stimulatory effect of suramin on release channel activity after voltage activation of DHPR-coupled release channels. However, evidence from previous studies using in vitroassays (18Suko J. Hellmann G. Drobny H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 543-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 25Klinger M. Freissmuth M. Nickel P. Stabler-Schwarzbart M. Kassack M. Suko J. Hohenegger M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 462-472PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that very high levels (0.3–1.0 mm) of suramin are required to activate RYR1, concentrations that are 6–20 times greater than that found to alter voltage-gated Ca2+ release in intact skeletal myotubes. Our observation of a potentiation of voltage-gated Ca2+ release by a relatively low concentration of suramin is even more striking considering potential limitations with regard to junctional accessibility of suramin introduced into myotubes via internal dialysis of patch-clamped myotubes. Suramin at concentrations higher than 100 μm displaces FKBP12 bound to RYR1 (data not shown), which may lead to an increase in release channel activity via a mechanism distinct from what has been suggested here. In summary, our studies indicate that suramin inhibits both Ca2+-CaM and apoCaM binding/regulation of RYR1 by competing for the CaM binding sequence on RYR1 (encoded by RYR1 residues 3609–3643). In addition, suramin increases the magnitude of the voltage-gated Ca2+ release in skeletal myotubes, possibly by disrupting an inhibitory interaction between the carboxyl terminus of the DHPR α1-subunit and the CaM binding region of RYR1. Future analysis of the effects of suramin analogs and their binding/regulation of RYR1 is likely to provide better tools for probing the role of CaM in the regulation of RYR1 and for investigating the functional role of the DHPR carboxyl terminus in the regulation of skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling.

With the increasing number of available mouse polymorphic genetic markers, LD can be estimated for the purpose of fine-mapping a given QTL or in the identification of novel QTLs. A whole-genome LD analysis was conducted for mapping mouse lung tumor susceptibility QTLs in 25 strains of mice with known susceptibility to lung cancer using 5638 genetic markers. A total of 63 markers were found to be significantly associated with lung tumor susceptibility, many of which were novel QTLs. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using LD to map QTLs on a whole genome level. Further characterization of the newly identified lung tumor susceptibility QTLs may lead to the identification of genes whose human homologue may predispose some individuals to lung cancer."
