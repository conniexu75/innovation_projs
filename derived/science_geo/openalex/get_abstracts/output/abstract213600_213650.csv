https://openalex.org/W2023849871,"THE mealy bug, P. citri, affords a unique opportunity for analysis of biochemical changes underlying chromosome behaviour. In the male embryos, the entire paternal set, that is, one half the total number of chromosomes, remains condensed in the non-dividing nuclei; this facultative behaviour is similar to that of typical heterochromatic elements such as sex chromosomes1,2. Experiments with tritiated thymidine show that, like heterochromatic elements in other organisms3,4, the paternal set in the males reproduces asynchronously from the maternal, or euchromatic, set5. As measured by dominant lethality2 and mutant genes6, the paternal set is genetically inert in the males, but some ‘residual’ influences can be demonstrated7,8."

https://openalex.org/W2081316202,"USING a method of centrifugation in liquids progressively increasing in specific gravity1, it is possible to separate, from a sample of bone powder, fractions at various degrees of mineralization2. These fractions, which can be recovered quantitatively, can then be analysed by appropriate chemical and biophysical techniques. We used infra-red spectroscopy for the examination of the carbonate present in bone, comparatively for a low specific gravity fraction (1.7 g/c.c.) and a pool of the high specific gravity fractions (1.8–2.3 g/c.c.) derived from diaphyseal bone samples of normal rats. It must be pointed out that less than 0.5 per cent of the samples belonged to the 1.7 gravity fraction. We used a Perkin–Elmer 221 infra-red spectrophotometer equipped with a sodium chloride prism. Potassium bromide pellets were prepared with various concentrations of whole unashed diaphyseal bone after separation."

Indeed, the apparent ineffectiveness of insulin in cell-free preparations was a major clue to the discovery of the insulin stimulation of trans-membrane transport. We have been examining utilization of glucose in human adipose tissue and have observed a distinct stimulation of utilization of glucose by insulin added to homogenates of omentum."

In view of this unusual specificity it seemed important to identify the active agent."

https://openalex.org/W2031438223,"As reported recently1,2, in aged chloroplasts of spinach the decay of the light-induced absorption decrease at 430 mµ becomes biphasic when the system is coupled with ascorbic acid and an appropriate amount of the redox dye phenazine methosulphate. It was further found that the slowly decaying portion becomes saturated at a lower actinic intensity and the rapidly decaying portion starts to appear only when the actinic intensity exceeds the threshold-level. The biphasic decay was attributed to the re-reduction of two separate photo-oxidized species, possibly the chlorophyll complex P700 and cytochrome f."

https://openalex.org/W2015081799,"THE following observations were made during a search for preparations which would permit assays of various enzymes in tissue samples containing glial cells only. Such an opportunity seemed to be provided by the filum terminale which is commonly considered a glial remnant of the fœtal sacral cord1. Tobias, Clark, and Gerard2 measured the respiration of the filum terminale of the cat and concluded that glial tissue had a rather high rate of respiration, comparable to that of neurones. The filum terminale of Rana catesbiena was used in our work because of its unusual size. A smaller material of 8 specimens of Rana pipiens was also examined with the same results."
