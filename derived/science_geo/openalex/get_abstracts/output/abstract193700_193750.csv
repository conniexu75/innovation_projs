https://openalex.org/W2097370510,"RECENT interest in the rodent vaginal epithelium as a target organ for studying the interaction of dietary and endocrine factors1 has led to an investigation of the post-fœtal vaginal epithelium of the rat in tissue culture. Whereas Emmens and Ludford2 were unsuccessful in a similar attempt, quite recently Hardy, Biggers and Claringbold3 were able to culture the mouse vaginal epithelium by the hanging-drop method and demonstrated the sensitivity of this tissue to œstrogenic substances."

https://openalex.org/W1975701611,"EXPERIMENTS with early amphibian embryos, using glycine-1-14C as a tracer and the autoradiographic technique of Doniach and Pelc1, have shown that the nuclei take up this substance into high-molecular weight compounds more rapidly than does the cytoplasm2. Ficq3 has also observed a greater activity in the nuclei, using orotic acid-2-14C as well as glycine-1-14C. She points out that, by the neural-tube stage, incorporation has occurred in all tissues which are actively engaged in morphogenesis; and she has shown that the labelled substances were taken up into nucleic acids as well as protein."

https://openalex.org/W2024756323,"1) Spectra in the ultraviolet and visible regions have been obtained on samples of malononitrile under different conditions. The samples were manufactured by several companies in America and Sweden. 2) The spectral analysis has demonstrated that the compound used by Hydén and Hartelius is not the same as that employed by American investigators. If, however, an aqueous solution of the American product is allowed to stand at room temperature for a long enough time, it develops the same spectral characteristics as the Swedish solution. 3) Future studies will concern themselves with attempts to identify, the active substance and to examine its effect on neuronal nucleoproteins."

In the course of a few days Daphnia can change in tint from almost colourless to red, or the reverse, by the synthesis or breakdown of haemoglobin. This occurs, too, in other branchiopod Crustacea (for example, Estheria, Apus, Artemia). Since a gain of blood-haemoglobin with fall of external oxygen pressure is known also in man at high altitudes and fishes in poorly aerated water, one may ask if it occurs in all animals with haemoglobin."

https://openalex.org/W2059025587,"THE infective larval stage of many nematode parasites is ensheathed in the uncast cuticle of the second stage. The sheath is regarded as having some protective function in a larval stage which is more resistant to environmental fluctuations than the earlier stages. A method has been devised for separating the sheaths from larvae, and it has been found that their protein complement is water-soluble. In this communication, the amino-acid composition of these proteins is discussed."
