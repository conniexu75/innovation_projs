https://openalex.org/W3202518185,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) results from disordered brain-gut interactions. Identifying susceptibility genes could highlight the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. We designed a digestive health questionnaire for UK Biobank and combined identified cases with IBS with independent cohorts. We conducted a genome-wide association study with 53,400 cases and 433,201 controls and replicated significant associations in a 23andMe panel (205,252 cases and 1,384,055 controls). Our study identified and confirmed six genetic susceptibility loci for IBS. Implicated genes included NCAM1, CADM2, PHF2/FAM120A, DOCK9, CKAP2/TPTE2P3 and BAG6. The first four are associated with mood and anxiety disorders, expressed in the nervous system, or both. Mirroring this, we also found strong genome-wide correlation between the risk of IBS and anxiety, neuroticism and depression (rg > 0.5). Additional analyses suggested this arises due to shared pathogenic pathways rather than, for example, anxiety causing abdominal symptoms. Implicated mechanisms require further exploration to help understand the altered brain-gut interactions underlying IBS."
https://openalex.org/W3213488744,"The biogenesis of mammalian autophagosomes remains to be fully defined. Here, we used cellular and in vitro membrane fusion analyses to show that autophagosomes are formed from a hitherto unappreciated hybrid membrane compartment. The autophagic precursors emerge through fusion of FIP200 vesicles, derived from the cis-Golgi, with endosomally derived ATG16L1 membranes to generate a hybrid pre-autophagosomal structure, HyPAS. A previously unrecognized apparatus defined here controls HyPAS biogenesis and mammalian autophagosomal precursor membranes. HyPAS can be modulated by pharmacological agents whereas its formation is inhibited upon severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or by expression of SARS-CoV-2 nsp6. These findings reveal the origin of mammalian autophagosomal membranes, which emerge via convergence of secretory and endosomal pathways, and show that this process is targeted by microbial factors such as coronaviral membrane-modulating proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3210782497,"Human cancers arise from environmental, heritable and somatic factors, but how these mechanisms interact in tumorigenesis is poorly understood. Studying 17,152 prospectively sequenced patients with cancer, we identified pathogenic germline variants in cancer predisposition genes, and assessed their zygosity and co-occurring somatic alterations in the concomitant tumors. Two major routes to tumorigenesis were apparent. In carriers of pathogenic germline variants in high-penetrance genes (5.1% overall), lineage-dependent patterns of biallelic inactivation led to tumors exhibiting mechanism-specific somatic phenotypes and fewer additional somatic oncogenic drivers. Nevertheless, 27% of cancers in these patients, and most tumors in patients with pathogenic germline variants in lower-penetrance genes, lacked particular hallmarks of tumorigenesis associated with the germline allele. The dependence of tumors on pathogenic germline variants is variable and often dictated by both penetrance and lineage, a finding with implications for clinical management. A study of 17,152 patients with cancer identified pathogenic germline variants in cancer predisposition genes. Although tumors showed biallelic inactivation for high-penetrance genes, this was not the case in most patients with pathogenic variants in low-penetrance genes, suggesting alternative routes to tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3212548298,"Information processing is energetically expensive. In the mammalian brain, it is unclear how information coding and energy use are regulated during food scarcity. Using whole-cell recordings and two-photon imaging in layer 2/3 mouse visual cortex, we found that food restriction reduced AMPA receptor conductance, reducing synaptic ATP use by 29%. Neuronal excitability was nonetheless preserved by a compensatory increase in input resistance and a depolarized resting potential. Consequently, neurons spiked at similar rates as controls but spent less ATP on underlying excitatory currents. This energy-saving strategy had a cost because it amplified the variability of visually-evoked subthreshold responses, leading to a 32% broadening of orientation tuning and impaired fine visual discrimination. This reduction in coding precision was associated with reduced levels of the fat mass-regulated hormone leptin and was restored by exogenous leptin supplementation. Our findings reveal that metabolic state dynamically regulates the energy spent on coding precision in neocortex."
https://openalex.org/W3159717096,"A lockdown implies a shift from the public to the private sphere, and from market to non-market production, thereby increasing the volume of unpaid work. Already before the pandemic, unpaid work was disproportionately borne by women. This paper studies the effect of working from home for pay (WFH), due to a lockdown, on the change in the division of housework and childcare within couple households. While previous studies on the effect of WFH on the reconciliation of work and family life and the division of labour within the household suffered from selection bias, we are able to identify this effect by drawing upon the shock of the first COVID-19 lockdown in Austria. The corresponding legal measures left little choice over WFH. In any case, WFH is exogenous, conditional on a small set of individual and household characteristics we control for. We employ data from a survey on the gendered aspects of the lockdown. The dataset includes detailed information on time use during the lockdown and on the quality and experience of WFH. Uniquely, this survey data also includes information on the division, and not only magnitude, of unpaid work within households. Austria is an interesting case in this respect as it is characterized by very conservative gender norms. The results reveal that the probability of men taking on a larger share of housework increases if men are WFH alone or together with their female partner. By contrast, the involvement of men in childcare increased only in the event that the female partner was not able to WFH. Overall, the burden of childcare, and particularly homeschooling, was disproportionately borne by women."
https://openalex.org/W3212271205,"One of the significant challenges in the Internet of Things (IoT) is the provisioning of guaranteed security and privacy, considering the fact that IoT devices are resource-limited. Oftentimes, in IoT applications, remote users need to obtain real-time data, with guaranteed security and privacy, from resource-limited network nodes through the public Internet. For this purpose, the users need to establish a secure link with the network nodes. Though the IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area networks (6LoWPAN) adaptation layer standard offers IPv6 compatibility for resource-limited wireless networks, the fundamental 6LoWPAN structure ignores security and privacy characteristics. Thus, there is a pressing need to design a resource-efficient authenticated key exchange (AKE) scheme for ensuring secure communication in 6LoWPAN-based resource-limited networks. This paper proposes a resource-efficient secure remote user authentication scheme for 6LoWPAN-based IoT networks, called SRUA-IoT. SRUA-IoT achieves the authentication of remote users and enables the users and network entities to establish private session keys between themselves for indecipherable communication. To this end, SRUA-IoT uses a secure hash algorithm, exclusive-OR operation, and symmetric encryption primitive. We prove through informal security analysis that SRUA-IoT is secured against a variety of malicious attacks. We also prove the security strength of SRUA-IoT through formal security analysis conducted by employing the random oracle model. Additionally, we prove through Scyther-based validation that SRUA-IoT is resilient against various attacks. Likewise, we demonstrate that SRUA-IoT reduces the computational cost of the nodes and communication overheads of the network."

In this study, we intended to explore the possible mechanism of improving cognitive function and protecting the neuron effect by electroacupuncture.We applied senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice as AD animal model, used Morris water maze, HE staining, 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing of gut microbiota and ELISA to demonstrate our hypothesis.electroacupuncture improved the learning and memory abilities in SAMP8 mice (P<0.05) and could protect the frontal lobe cortex and hippocampus of SAMP8 mice; electroacupuncture significantly decreased the expression of IL-1β (P<0.01), IL-6 (P<0.01) and TNF-α (P<0.01 in hippocampus, P<0.05 in serum) in serum and hippocampus; electroacupuncture balanced the quantity and composition of gut microbiome, especially of the relative abundance in Delta-proteobacteria (P<0.05) and Epsilon-proteobacteria (P<0.05).electroacupuncture treatment could inhibit the peripheral and central nerve system inflammatory response by balancing the gut microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W3214413391,"Epigenetic mechanisms of paternal inheritance are an emerging area of interest in our efforts to understand fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. In rodent models examining maternal alcohol exposures, different maternal genetic backgrounds protect or sensitize offspring to alcohol-induced teratogenesis. However, whether maternal background can mitigate sperm-inherited alterations in developmental programming and modify the penetrance of growth defects induced by preconception paternal alcohol exposures remains unaddressed. In our previous studies examining pure C57Bl/6J crosses, the offspring of alcohol-exposed sires exhibited fetal growth restriction, enlarged placentas, and decreased placental efficiency. Here, we find that in contrast to our previous studies, the F1 offspring of alcohol-exposed C57Bl/6J sires and CD-1 dams do not exhibit fetal growth restriction, with male fetuses developing smaller placentas and increased placental efficiencies. However, in these hybrid offspring, preconception paternal alcohol exposure induces sex-specific changes in placental morphology. Specifically, the female offspring of alcohol-exposed sires displayed structural changes in the junctional and labyrinth zones, along with increased placental glycogen content. These changes in placental organization are accompanied by female-specific alterations in the expression of imprinted genes Cdkn1c and H19. Although male placentae do not display overt changes in placental histology, using RNA-sequencing, we identified programmed alterations in genes regulating oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial function, and Sirtuin signaling. Collectively, our data reveal that preconception paternal alcohol exposure transmits a stressor to developing offspring, that males and females exhibit distinct patterns of placental adaptation, and that maternal genetic background can modulate the effects of paternal alcohol exposure."
https://openalex.org/W3210235812,"The BarA/UvrY two-component signal transduction system is widely conserved in γ-proteobacteria and provides a link between the metabolic state of the cells and the Csr posttranscriptional regulatory system. In Escherichia coli, the BarA/UvrY system responds to the presence of acetate and other short-chain carboxylic acids by activating transcription of the noncoding RNAs, CsrB and CsrC, which sequester the RNA-binding protein CsrA, a global regulator of gene expression. However, the state of the carboxyl group in the acetate molecule, which serves as the BarA stimulus, and the signal reception site of BarA remain unknown. In this study, we show that the deletion or replacement of the periplasmic domain of BarA and also the substitution of certain hydroxylated and hydrophobic amino acid residues in this region, result in a sensor kinase that remains unresponsive to its physiological stimulus, demonstrating that the periplasmic region of BarA constitutes a functional detector domain. Moreover, we provide evidence that the protonated state of acetate or formate serves as the physiological stimulus of BarA. In addition, modeling of the BarA sensor domain and prediction of the signal-binding site, by blind molecular docking, revealed a calcium channels and chemotaxis receptors domain with a conserved binding pocket, which comprised uncharged polar and hydrophobic amino acid residues. Based on the comparative sequence and phylogenetic analyses, we propose that, at least, two types of BarA orthologues diverged and evolved separately to acquire distinct signal-binding properties, illustrating the wide adaptability of the bacterial sensor kinase proteins."

https://openalex.org/W3211219183,"The innate immune system acts as the first line of defense against infection. One key component of the innate immune response to gram-negative bacterial infections is inflammasome activation. The caspase-11 (CASP11)-nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is activated by cytosolic lipopolysaccharide, a gram-negative bacterial cell wall component, to trigger pyroptosis and host defense during infection. Although several cellular signaling pathways have been shown to regulate CASP11-NLRP3 inflammasome activation in response to lipopolysaccharide, the upstream molecules regulating CASP11 activation during infection with live pathogens remain unclear. Here, we report that the understudied caspase-6 (CASP6) contributes to the activation of the CASP11-NLRP3 inflammasome in response to infections with gram-negative bacteria. Using in vitro cellular systems with bone marrow-derived macrophages and 293T cells, we found that CASP6 can directly process CASP11 by cleaving at Asp59 and Asp285, the CASP11 auto-cleavage sites, which could contribute to the activation of CASP11 during gram-negative bacterial infection. Thus, the loss of CASP6 led to impaired CASP11-NLRP3 inflammasome activation in response to gram-negative bacteria. These results demonstrate that CASP6 potentiates activation of the CASP11-NLRP3 inflammasome to produce inflammatory cytokines during gram-negative bacterial infections."
https://openalex.org/W3214094866,"The region of western Georgia (Imereti) in the Southern Caucasus has been a major geographic corridor for human migrations during the Middle and Upper Paleolithic. Data of recent research and excavations in this region display its importance as a possible route for the dispersal of anatomically modern humans (AMH) into northern Eurasia. Nevertheless, within the local research context, bone-working and personal ornaments have yet contributed but little to the Upper Palaeolithic (UP) regional sequence's characterization. Here we present an archaeozoological, technological and use-wear study of pendants from two local UP assemblages, originating in the Dzudzuana Cave and Satsurblia Cave. The ornaments were made mostly of perforated teeth, though some specimens were made on bone. Both the manufacturing marks made during preparation and use-wear traces indicate that they were personal ornaments, used as pendants or attached to garments. Detailed comparison between ornament assemblages from northern and southern Caucasus reveal that they are quite similar, supporting the observation of cultural bonds between the two regions, demonstrated previously through lithic techno-typological affinities. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance attributed to red deer (Cervus elaphus) by the UP societies of the Caucasus in sharing aesthetic values and/or a symbolic sphere."
https://openalex.org/W3211344206,"Serratia marcescens is a species that belongs to the family of Yersiniaceae. This family comprises taxa representing opportunistic human- and phytopathogens but also plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). This study describes a novel Gram-negative strain (LVF3R) of the species Serratia marcescens. The strain was characterized genomically, morphologically, and physiologically. In addition, the potential of the isolate to act as a host strain to assess the diversity of Serratia associated phages in environmental samples was explored. Average nucleotide identity analysis revealed that LVF3R belongs to the species Serratia marcescens. In silico analysis and ProphageSeq data resulted in the identification of one prophage, which is capable of viral particle formation. Electron microscopy showed cells of a rod-shaped, flagellated morphotype. The cells revealed a length and width of 1-1.6 μm and 0.8 μm, respectively. LVF3R showed optimal growth at 30 C and in the presence of up to 2% (w/v) NaCl. It exhibited resistances to ampicillin, erythromycin, oxacillin, oxytetracycline, rifampicin, tetracycline, and vancomycin. Genome data indicate that strain S. marcescens LVF3R is a potential PGPR strain. It harbors genes coding for indole acetic acid (IAA) biosynthesis, siderophore production, plant polymer degradation enzymes, acetoin synthesis, flagellar proteins, type IV secretion system, chemotaxis, phosphorous solubilization, and biofilm formation."

We sought to investigate the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak that occurred in a highly dense population area in Colombo, Sri Lanka from April to May 2020.We carried out RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV2, assessed the SARS-CoV-2 specific total and neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) in a densely packed, underserved settlement (n = 2722) after identification of the index case on 15th April 2020. 89/2722 individuals were detected as infected by RT-qPCR with a secondary attack rate among close contacts being 0.077 (95% CI 0.063-0.095). Another 30 asymptomatic individuals were found to have had COVID-19 based on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. However, only 61.5% of those who were initially seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 had detectable total antibodies at 120 to 160 days, while only 40.6% had detectable Nabs. 74/89 (83.1%) of RT-qPCR positive individuals were completely asymptomatic and all 15 (16.9%) who experienced symptoms were classified as having a mild illness. 18 (20.2%) were between the ages of 61 to 80. 11/89 (12.4%) had diabetes, 8/89 (9%) had cardiovascular disease and 4 (4.5%) had asthma. Of the two viruses that were sequenced and were of the B.1 and B.4 lineages with one carrying the D614G mutation.Almost all infected individuals developed mild or asymptomatic illness despite the presence of comorbid illnesses. Since the majority of those who were in this underserved settlement were not infected despite circulation of the D614G variant, it would be important to further study environmental and host factors that lead to disease severity and transmission."

https://openalex.org/W4226183814,"Given that fructose consumption has increased by more than 10-fold in recent decades, it is possible that excess maternal fructose consumption causes harmful effects in the next generation. This study attempted to elucidate the mechanism of the harmful effects of excessive maternal fructose intake from the perspective of offspring liver function. Female rats during gestation and lactation were fed water containing fructose, and their offspring were fed normal water. We attempted to elucidate the mechanism of fructose-induced transgenerational toxicity by conducting a longitudinal study focusing on hepatic programming prior to disease onset. Impaired Insulin resistance and decreased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels were observed at 160 days of age. However, metabolic disorders were not observed in 60-day-old offspring. Microarray analysis of 60-day-old offspring livers showed the reduction of hepatic insulin-like growth factor-1 (Igf1) mRNA expression. This reduction continued until the rats were aged 160 days and attenuated Igf1 signaling. Hepatic microRNA-29 (miR-29a) and miR-130a, which target Igf1 mRNA, were also found to be upregulated. Interestingly, these miRNAs were upregulated in the absence of metabolic disorder. In this study, we found that maternal fructose intake resulted in dysregulated expression of Igf1 and its target miRNAs in the offspring liver, and that these offspring were more likely to develop metabolic disorders. Abnormal hepatic programming induced by an imbalanced maternal nutritional environment is maintained throughout life, implying that it may contribute to metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3212066386,"Background For their functions of insulin biosynthesis and glucose- and fatty acid- mediated insulin secretion, Langerhans β-cells require an intracellular milieu rich in oxygen. This requirement makes β-cells, with their constitutively low antioxidative defense, susceptible to the oxidative stress. Although much progress has been made in identifying its molecular basis in experimental systems, whether the oxidative stress due to excessive fatty acids plays a crucial role in the Langerhans cell degeneration in primates is still debated. Methods Focusing on Hsp70.1, which has dual functions as molecular chaperone and lysosomal stabilizer, the mechanism of lipotoxicity to Langerhans cells was studied using macaque monkeys after the consecutive injections of the lipid peroxidation product ‘hydroxynonenal’. Based on the ‘ calpain-cathepsin hypothesis ’ formulated in 1998, calpain activation, Hsp70.1 cleavage, and lysosomal integrity were studied by immunofluorescence histochemistry, electron microscopy, and Western blotting. Results Light microscopy showed more abundant vacuole formation in the hydroxynonenal-treated islet cells than the control cells. Electron microscopy showed that vacuolar changes, which were identified as enlarged rough ER, occurred mainly in β-cells followed by δ-cells. Intriguingly, both cell types showed a marked decrease in insulin and somatostatin granules. Furthermore, they exhibited marked increases in peroxisomes, autophagosomes/autolysosomes, lysosomal and peroxisomal membrane rupture/permeabilization, and mitochondrial degeneration. Disrupted peroxisomes were often localized in the close vicinity of degenerating mitochondria or autolysosomes. Immunofluorescence histochemical analysis showed an increased co-localization of activated μ-calpain and Hsp70.1 with the extralysosomal release of cathepsin B. Western blotting showed increases in μ-calpain activation, Hsp70.1 cleavage, and expression of the hydroxynonenal receptor GPR109A. Conclusions Taken together, these data implicate hydroxynonenal in both oxidation of Hsp70.1 and activation of μ-calpain. The calpain-mediated cleavage of the carbonylated Hsp70.1, may cause lysosomal membrane rupture/permeabilization. The low defense of primate Langerhans cells against hydroxynonenal and peroxisomally-generated hydrogen peroxide, was presumably overwhelmed to facilitate cell degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3212793120,"Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS) is an ultra-rare disease that potentially leads to kidney graft failure due to ongoing Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA). The aim was evaluating the frequency of TMA after kidney transplantation in patients with aHUS in a Brazilian cohort stratified by the use of the specific complement-inhibitor eculizumab.This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study including kidney transplant patients diagnosed with aHUS. We collected data from 118 transplant centers in Brazil concerning aHUS transplanted patients between 01/01/2007 and 12/31/2019. Patients were stratified into three groups: no use of eculizumab (No Eculizumab Group), use of eculizumab for treatment of after transplantation TMA (Therapeutic Group), and use of eculizumab for prophylaxis of aHUS recurrence (Prophylactic Group).Thirty-eight patients with aHUS who received kidney transplantation were enrolled in the study. Patients' mean age was 30 years (24-40), and the majority of participants was women (63% of cases). In the No Eculizumab Group (n = 11), there was a 91% graft loss due to the TMA. The hazard ratio of TMA graft loss was 0.07 [0.01-0.55], p = 0.012 in the eculizumab Prophylactic Group and 0.04 [0.00-0.28], p = 0.002 in the eculizumab Therapeutic Group.The TMA graft loss in the absence of a specific complement-inhibitor was higher among the Brazilian cohort of kidney transplant patients. This finding reinforces the need of eculizumab use for treatment of aHUS kidney transplant patients. Cost optimization analysis and the early access to C5 inhibitors are suggested, especially in low-medium income countries."
https://openalex.org/W4226418185,"Abdominal trauma (AT) is of major global importance, particularly with the increased potential for civil, terroristic, and military trauma. The injury pattern and systemic consequences of blunt abdominal injuries are highly variable and frequently underestimated or even missed, and the pathomechanisms remain still poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the temporal-spatial organ and immune response after a standardized blast-induced blunt AT. Anesthetized mice were exposed to a single blast wave centered on the epigastrium. At 2, 6, or 24 h after trauma, abdominal organ damage was assessed macroscopically, microscopically, and biochemically. A higher degree of trauma severity, determined by a reduction of the distance between the epigastrium and blast inductor, was reflected by a reduced survival rate. The hemodynamic monitoring during the first 120 min after AT revealed a decline in the mean arterial pressure within the first 80 min, whereas the heart rate remained quite stable. AT induced a systemic damage and inflammatory response, evidenced by elevated HMGB-1 and IL-6 plasma levels. The macroscopic injury pattern of the abdominal organs (while complex) was consistent, with the following frequency: liver > pancreas > spleen > left kidney > intestine > right kidney > others > lungs and was reflected by microscopic liver and pancreas damages. Plasma levels of organ dysfunction markers increased during the first 6 h after AT and subsequently declined, indicating an early, temporal impairment of the function on a multi-organ level. The established highly reproducible murine blunt AT, with time- and trauma-severity-dependent organ injury patterns, systemic inflammatory response, and impairment of various organ functions, reflects characteristics of human AT. In the future, this model may help to study the complex immuno-pathophysiological consequences and innovative therapeutic approaches after blunt AT."

Patients were off-loaded with total contact cast and randomized to receive either methylprednisolone (1gm) (group A), zoledronate (5mg) (group B) or placebo (100ml normal saline) (group C) once monthly infusion for three consecutive months. Change in foot BMC was assessed at 6 months or at remission and followed subsequently up to 4 years for the incidence of new-onset fracture, deformities, or CN recurrence.Thirty-six participants (24 male, 12 female) were randomized (11 in group A, 12 group B, 13 group C). The mean age was 57.7± 9.9 years, duration of diabetes 12.3± 5.8 years and symptom duration 6.5± 2.8 weeks. BMC increased by 36% with zoledronate (p = 0.02) but reduced by 13% with methylprednisolone (p = 0.03) and 9% (p = 0.09) with placebo at remission.

https://openalex.org/W3212984575,"Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) play a major role in regulating mammary tumor growth and in directing the responses of tumor infiltrating leukocytes in the microenvironment. However, macrophage-specific mechanisms regulating the interactions of macrophages with tumor cells and other leukocytes that support tumor progression have not been extensively studied. In this study, we show that the activation of the RON receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway specifically in macrophages supports breast cancer growth and metastasis. Using clinically relevant murine models of breast cancer, we demonstrate that loss of macrophage RON expression results in decreases in mammary tumor cell proliferation, survival, cancer stem cell self-renewal, and metastasis. Macrophage RON signaling modulates these phenotypes via direct effects on the tumor proper and indirectly by regulating leukocyte recruitment including macrophages, T-cells, and B-cells in the mammary tumor microenvironment. We further show that macrophage RON expression regulates the macrophage secretome including IL-35 and other immunosuppressive factors. Overall, our studies implicate activation of RON signaling in macrophages as a key player in supporting a thriving mammary pro-tumor microenvironment through novel mechanisms including the augmentation of tumor cell properties through IL-35."
https://openalex.org/W3213001386,"Minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS), also named minimally invasive autopsy is a post-mortem method shown to be an acceptable proxy of the complete diagnostic autopsy. MITS improves the knowledge of causes of death (CoD) in resource-limited settings. Its implementation requires understanding the components of acceptability, including facilitators and barriers in real-case scenarios.We undertook a mixed-methods analysis comparing anticipated (hypothetical scenario) and experienced (real-case scenario) acceptability of MITS among relatives of deceased children in Mozambique. Anticipated acceptability information was obtained from 15 interviews with relatives of deceased children. The interview focus was on whether and why they would allow the procedure on their dead child in a hypothetical scenario. Experienced acceptability data were obtained from outcomes of consent requested to relatives of 114 deceased children during MITS implementation, recorded through observations, clinical records abstraction and follow-up informal conversations with health care professionals and semi-structured interviews with relatives.Ninety-three percent of relatives indicated that they would hypothetically accept MITS on their deceased child. A key reason was knowing the CoD to take preventive actions; whereas the need to conform with the norm of immediate child burial, the secrecy of perinatal deaths, the decision-making complexity, the misalignment between MITS' purpose and traditional values, lack of a credible reason to investigate CoD, and the impotency to resuscitate the deceased were identified as potential points of hesitancy for acceptance. The only refusing respondent linked MITS to a perception that sharing results would constitute a breach of confidentiality and the lack of value attached to CoD determination. Experienced acceptability revealed four different components: actual acceptance, health professionals' hesitancy, relatives' hesitancy and actual refusal, which resulted in 82% of approached relatives to agree with MITS and 79% of cases to undergo MITS. Barriers to acceptability included, among others, health professionals' and facilities' unpreparedness to perform MITS, the threat of not burying the child immediately, financial burden of delays, decision-making complexities and misalignment of MITS' objectives with family values.MITS showed high anticipated and experienced acceptability driven by the opportunity to prevent further deaths. Anticipated acceptability identified secrecy, confidentiality and complex decision-making processes as barriers, while experienced acceptability revealed family- and health facility-level logistics and practical aspects as barriers. Health-system and logistical impediments must also be considered before MITS implementation. Additionally, the multiple components of acceptability must be taken into account to make it more consistent and transferrable."

Further investigation using cluster and network analyses allowed us to propose the first systematically and quantitatively recognized global bioregionalization framework for living brachiopods, consisting of five bioregions and thirteen bioprovinces. No single environmental or ecological variable is accountable for the newly proposed global bioregionalization patterns of living brachiopods. Instead, the combined effects of large-scale ocean gyres, climatic zonation as well as some geohistorical factors (e.g., formation of land bridges and geological recent closure of ancient seaways) are considered as the main drivers at the global scale. At the regional scale, however, the faunal composition, diversity and biogeographical differentiation appear to be mainly controlled by seawater temperature variation, regional ocean currents and coastal upwelling systems."
https://openalex.org/W3160171273,"Pulmonary acini represent the functional gas-exchanging units of the lung. Due to technical limitations, individual acini cannot be identified on microscopic lung sections. To overcome these limitations, we imaged the right lower lobes of instillation-fixed rat lungs from postnatal days P4, P10, P21, and P60 at the TOMCAT beamline of the Swiss Light Source synchrotron facility at a voxel size of 1.48 μm. Individual acini were segmented from the three-dimensional data by closing the airways at the transition from conducting to gas exchanging airways. For a subset of acini (N = 268), we followed the acinar development by stereologically assessing their volume and their number of alveoli. We found that the mean volume of the acini increases 23 times during the observed time-frame. The coefficients of variation dropped from 1.26 to 0.49 and the difference between the mean volumes of the fraction of the 20% smallest to the 20% largest acini decreased from a factor of 27.26 (day 4) to a factor of 4.07 (day 60), i.e. shows a smaller dispersion at later time points. The acinar volumes show a large variation early in lung development and homogenize during maturation of the lung by reducing their size distribution by a factor of 7 until adulthood. The homogenization of the acinar sizes hints at an optimization of the gas-exchange region in the lungs of adult animals and that acini of different size are not evenly distributed in the lungs. This likely leads to more homogeneous ventilation at later stages in lung development."

Here we investigated the effect of WFA on T-cell motility, which is crucial for adaptive immune responses as well as autoimmune reactions. We found that WFA dose-dependently (within the concentration range of 0.3-1.25 μM) inhibited the ability of human T-cells to migrate via cross-linking of the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) integrin with its ligand, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). Coimmunoprecipitation of WFA interacting proteins and subsequent tandem mass spectrometry identified a WFA-interactome consisting of 273 proteins in motile T-cells. In particular, our data revealed significant enrichment of the zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70) and cytoskeletal actin protein interaction networks upon stimulation. Phospho-peptide mapping and kinome analysis substantiated kinase signaling downstream of ZAP70 as a key WFA target, which was further confirmed by bait-pulldown and Western immunoblotting assays. The WFA-ZAP70 interaction was disrupted by a disulfide reducing agent dithiothreitol, suggesting an involvement of cysteine covalent binding interface. In silico docking predicted WFA binding to ZAP70 at cystine 560 and 564 residues. These findings provide a mechanistic insight whereby WFA binds to and inhibits the ZAP70 kinase and impedes T-cell motility. We therefore conclude that WFA may be exploited to pharmacologically control host immune responses and potentially prevent autoimmune-mediated pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W3213527506,"While aneuploidy is a main enabling characteristic of cancers, it also creates specific vulnerabilities. Here we demonstrate that Ran inhibition targets epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) survival through its characteristic aneuploidy. We show that induction of aneuploidy in rare diploid EOC cell lines or normal cells renders them highly dependent on Ran. We also establish an inverse correlation between Ran and the tumor suppressor NR1D1 and reveal the critical role of Ran/NR1D1 axis in aneuploidy-associated endogenous DNA damage repair. Mechanistically, we show that Ran, through the maturation of miR4472, destabilizes the mRNA of NR1D1 impacting several DNA repair pathways. We showed that NR1D1 interacts with both PARP1 and BRCA1 leading to the inhibition of DNA repair. Concordantly, loss of Ran was associated with NR1D1 induction, accumulation of DNA damages, and lethality of aneuploid EOC cells. Our findings suggest a synthetic lethal strategy targeting aneuploid cells based on their dependency to Ran."
https://openalex.org/W3213566803,"Correct certification of cause of death by physicians (i.e. completing the medical certificate of cause of death or MCCOD) and correct coding according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD) rules are essential to produce quality mortality statistics to inform health policy. Despite clear guidelines, errors in medical certification are common. This study objectively measures the impact of different medical certification errors upon the selection of the underlying cause of death.A sample of 1592 error-free MCCODs were selected from the 2017 United States multiple cause of death data. The ten most common types of errors in completing the MCCOD (according to published studies) were individually simulated on the error-free MCCODs. After each simulation, the MCCODs were coded using Iris automated mortality coding software. Chance-corrected concordance (CCC) was used to measure the impact of certification errors on the underlying cause of death. Weights for each error type and Socio-demographic Index (SDI) group (representing different mortality conditions) were calculated from the CCC and categorised (very high, high, medium and low) to describe their effect on cause of death accuracy.The only very high impact error type was reporting an ill-defined condition as the underlying cause of death. High impact errors were found to be reporting competing causes in Part 1 [of the death certificate] and illegibility, with medium impact errors being reporting underlying cause in Part 2 [of the death certificate], incorrect or absent time intervals and reporting contributory causes in Part 1, and low impact errors comprising multiple causes per line and incorrect sequence. There was only small difference in error importance between SDI groups.Reporting an ill-defined condition as the underlying cause of death can seriously affect the coding outcome, while other certification errors were mitigated through the correct application of mortality coding rules. Training of physicians in not reporting ill-defined conditions on the MCCOD and mortality coders in correct coding practices and using Iris should be important components of national strategies to improve cause of death data quality."
https://openalex.org/W3214081256,"In order to achieve rapid detection of thiamethoxam residues in mango, cowpea and water, this study modified the screen printed carbon electrode (SPCE) to make a specific molecular imprinting sensor (Thiamethoxam-MIP/Au/rGO/SPCE) for thiamethoxam. An integrated smartphone platform was also built for thiamethoxam residue analysis. The performance of the complete system was analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The system was then applied for the rapid determination of thiamethoxam residues in water, mango and cowpea samples. The results showed that the molecular sensor showed good linearity in the range 0.5-3.0 μmol/L of thiamethoxam. The detection limit of thiamethoxam was 0.5 μmol/L. Moreover, the sensor had good reproducibility and anti-interference performance. The average recovery rates of the pesticide residues in water, mango and cowpea samples were in the range of 90-110% with relative standard deviations < 5%. The rapid detection system for thiamethoxam residue constructed in this study was simple, reliable, reproducible and had strong anti-interference. It has broad application prospects in the field detection of thiamethoxam residue, and serves as a valuable reference for the further development of rapid detection technology of pesticide residues in the field of environment and food safety."
https://openalex.org/W4225359229,"The Creb-Regulated Transcriptional Coactivator (Crtc) family of transcriptional coregulators drive Creb1-mediated transcription effects on metabolism in many tissues, but the in vivo effects of Crtc2/Creb1 transcription on skeletal muscle metabolism are not known. Skeletal muscle-specific overexpression of Crtc2 (Crtc2 mice) induced greater mitochondrial activity, metabolic flux capacity for both carbohydrates and fats, improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, and increased oxidative capacity, supported by upregulation of key metabolic genes. Crtc2 overexpression led to greater weight loss during alternate day fasting (ADF), selective loss of fat rather than lean mass, maintenance of higher energy expenditure during the fast and reduced binge-eating during the feeding period. ADF downregulated most of the mitochondrial electron transport genes, and other regulators of mitochondrial function, that were substantially reversed by Crtc2-driven transcription. Glucocorticoids acted with AMPK to drive atrophy and mitophagy, which was reversed by Crtc2/Creb1 signaling. Crtc2/Creb1-mediated signaling coordinates metabolic adaptations in skeletal muscle that explain how Crtc2/Creb1 regulates metabolism and weight loss."
https://openalex.org/W3170934469,"We often take people's ability to understand and produce line drawings for granted. But where should we draw lines, and why? We address psychological principles that underlie efficient representations of complex information in line drawings. First, 58 participants with varying degree of artistic experience produced multiple drawings of a small set of scenes by tracing contours on a digital tablet. Second, 37 independent observers ranked the drawings by how representative they are of the original photograph. Matching contours between drawings of the same scene revealed that the most consistently drawn contours tend to be drawn earlier. We generated half-images with the most- versus least-consistently drawn contours and asked 25 observers categorize the quickly presented scenes. Observers performed significantly better for the most compared to the least consistent half-images. The most consistently drawn contours were more likely to depict occlusion boundaries, whereas the least consistently drawn contours frequently depicted surface normals."
https://openalex.org/W3209445994,"Notch2tm1.1Ecan mice, which harbor a mutation replicating that found in Hajdu-Cheney syndrome, exhibit marked osteopenia because of increased osteoclast number and bone resorption. Hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES1) is a Notch target gene and a transcriptional modulator that determines osteoclast cell fate decisions. Transcript levels of Hes1 increase in Notch2tm1.1Ecan bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) as they mature into osteoclasts, suggesting a role in osteoclastogenesis. To determine whether HES1 is responsible for the phenotype of Notch2tm1.1Ecan mice and the skeletal manifestations of Hajdu-Cheney syndrome, Hes1 was inactivated in Ctsk-expressing cells from Notch2tm1.1Ecan mice. Ctsk encodes the protease cathepsin K, which is expressed preferentially by osteoclasts. We found that the osteopenia of Notch2tm1.1Ecan mice was ameliorated, and the enhanced osteoclastogenesis was reversed in the context of the Hes1 inactivation. Microcomputed tomography revealed that the downregulation of Hes1 in Ctsk-expressing cells led to increased bone volume/total volume in female mice. In addition, cultures of BMMs from CtskCre/WT;Hes1Δ/Δ mice displayed a decrease in osteoclast number and size and decreased bone-resorbing capacity. Moreover, activation of HES1 in Ctsk-expressing cells led to osteopenia and enhanced osteoclast number, size, and bone resorptive capacity in BMM cultures. Osteoclast phenotypes and RNA-Seq of cells in which HES1 was activated revealed that HES1 modulates cell-cell fusion and bone-resorbing capacity by supporting sealing zone formation. In conclusion, we demonstrate that HES1 is mechanistically relevant to the skeletal manifestation of Notch2tm1.1Ecan mice and is a novel determinant of osteoclast differentiation and function."
https://openalex.org/W3212121034,"Multivalent polymers are a key structural component of many biocondensates. When interacting with their cognate binding proteins, multivalent polymers such as RNA and modular proteins have been shown to influence the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) boundary to both control condensate formation and to influence condensate dynamics after phase separation. Much is still unknown about the function and formation of these condensed droplets, but changes in their dynamics or phase separation are associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's Disease. Therefore, investigation into how the structure of multivalent polymers relates to changes in biocondensate formation and maturation is essential to understanding and treating these diseases. Here, we use a coarse-grain, Brownian Dynamics simulation with reactive binding that mimics specific interactions in order to investigate the difference between non-specific and specific multivalent binding polymers. We show that non-specific binding interactions can lead to much larger changes in droplet formation at lower protein-polymer interaction energies than their specific, valence-limited counterparts. We also demonstrate the effects of solvent conditions and polymer length on phase separation, and we present how modulating binding energy to the polymer can change the organization of a droplet in a three component system of polymer, binding protein, and solvent. Finally, we compare the effects of surface tension and polymer binding on the condensed phase dynamics, and show that both lower protein solubilities and higher attraction/affinity of the protein to the polymer result in slower droplet dynamics. This research will help to better understand experimental systems and provides additional insight into how multivalent polymers can control LLPS."
https://openalex.org/W3213241123,"Warmblood Fragile Foal syndrome (WFFS) is an autosomal recessive condition that affects the maturation of collagen in affected foals. Foals affected with the disease typically die or are euthanised shortly after birth. WFFS is caused by a single nucleotide change at position 2032 of the equine PLOD1 gene, causing an impairment of the wild-type enzyme. A commercial test for the causative genetic mutation is currently available from companies operating under licence from Cornell University but it has limitations. This test requires amplification of a region of the PLOD1 gene encompassing the site of interest, followed by Sanger sequencing of that region and computational analysis. We describe here the development of an alternative, real-time PCR based assay that rapidly and reliably differentiates between the wild-type and WFFS associated nucleotides without the need for sequencing, thus increasing the potential for high throughput analysis of large numbers of samples in a cost-effective manner."

Increased access to point-of-care-tests (POCTs) could help detect infection and lead to appropriate management of cases and contacts, reducing transmission and development of reproductive health sequelae. Yet diagnostics with good clinical effectiveness evidence can fail to be implemented into routine care. Here we assess values beyond clinical effectiveness for molecular CT/NG POCTs implemented across diverse routine practice settings.We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed primary research and conference abstract publications in Medline and Embase reporting on molecular CT/NG POCT implementation in routine clinical practice until 16th February 2021. Results were extracted into EndNote software and initially screened by title and abstract by one author according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles that met the criteria, or were unclear, were included for full-text assessment by all authors. Results were synthesised to assess the tests against guidance criteria and develop a CT/NG POCT value proposition for multiple stakeholders and settings.The systematic review search returned 440 articles; 28 were included overall. The Cepheid CT/NG GeneXpert was the only molecular CT/NG POCT implemented and evaluated in routine practice. It did not fulfil all test guidance criteria, however, studies of test implementation showed multiple values for test use across various healthcare settings and locations. Our value proposition highlights that the majority of values are setting-specific. Sexual health services and outreach services have the least overlap, with General Practice and other non-sexual health specialist services serving as a ""bridge"" between the two.Those wishing to improve CT/NG diagnosis should be supported to identify the values most relevant to their settings and context, and prioritise implementation of tests that are most closely aligned with those values."

The proteomic profiles of the major salivary glands of the offspring rats were analyzed through mass spectrometry.The offspring rats exposed to MeHg showed significant alterations in the proteomic profiles of the PA, SM, and SL glands. Altered proteins were associated with cytoskeleton components, tissue morphogenesis, and response to stimulus and stress.This original study showed that maternal MeHg exposure significantly modulates the expression of proteins and induces alterations in the proteomic profiles of developing salivary glands."
https://openalex.org/W3211877770,"Versatile video coding (VVC) achieves enormous improvement over the advanced high efficiency video coding (HEVC) standard due to the adoption of the quadtree with nested multi-type tree (QTMT) partition structure and other coding tools. However, the computational complexity increases dramatically as well. To tackle this problem, we propose a decision tree accelerated coding tree units (CTU) partition algorithm for intra prediction in VVC. Firstly, specially designated image features are extracted to characterize the coding unit (CU) complexity. Then, the trained decision tree is employed to predict the partition results. Finally, based on our newly designed intra prediction framework, the partition process is early terminated or redundant partition modes are screened out. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm could achieve around 52% encoding time reduction for various test video sequences on average with only 1.75% Bjontegaard delta bit rate increase compared with the reference test model VTM9.0 of VVC."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of a cognition-targeted exercise versus symptom-targeted exercise for MS fatigue.In this Pilot, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial, sixty participants with multiple sclerosis, were randomly assigned to either a Cognition-Targeted Exercise (CTE) (N = 30, mean age 41) or a Symptom-Targeted Exercise (STE) (N = 30, mean age 42). The participants in the experimental group received eight, 50-minute sessions of weekly Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) in addition to a CTE Program; whereas, participants in the control group received eight, 50-minute sessions of weekly CBT in addition to the standardized physiotherapy program (STE Program). Feasibility was assessed through recruitment rate, participant retention, adherence and safety, in addition to clinical outcome measures, including: (1) Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), (2) Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), (3) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). All outcome measures were assessed at baseline (pretreatment), following completion of the eight visit intervention protocol, and at 3-months follow-up.The recruitment rate was 60% and 93% of participants completed the entire study. The recruited participants complied with 98% of the required visits. No adverse events were recorded. A Generalized Estimation Equation Model revealed a significant difference over time as an interaction term during the post and follow up visit for all clinical outcome measures (p < .001).The addition of CTE to CBT exhibited positive and more lasting influence on MS fatigue outcomes compared to Symptom-Targeted Exercise (STE). Feasibility and efficacy data from this pilot study provide support for a full-scale RCT of CTE as an integral component of Multiple Sclerosis fatigue management."
https://openalex.org/W3212992231,"For functional MRI with a multi-channel receiver RF coil, images are often reconstructed channel by channel, resulting into multiple images per time frame. The final image to analyze usually is the result of the covariance Sum-of-Squares (covSoS) combination across these channels. Although this reconstruction is quasi-optimal in SNR, it is not necessarily the case in terms of temporal SNR (tSNR) of the time series, which is yet a more relevant metric for fMRI data quality. In this work, we investigated tSNR optimality through voxel-wise RF coil combination and its effects on BOLD sensitivity. An analytical solution for an optimal RF coil combination is described, which is somewhat tied to the extended Krueger-Glover model involving both thermal and physiological noise covariance matrices. Compared experimentally to covSOS on four volunteers at 7T, the method yielded great improvement of tSNR but, surprisingly, did not result into higher BOLD sensitivity. Solutions to improve the method such as for example the t-score for the mean recently proposed are also explored, but result into similar observations once the statistics are corrected properly. Overall, the work shows that data-driven RF coil combinations based on tSNR considerations alone should be avoided unless additional and unbiased assumptions can be made."
https://openalex.org/W3213295514,"The popularization of social media has led to the coalescing of user groups around mental health conditions; in particular, depression. Social media offers a rich environment for contextualizing and predicting users' self-reported burden of depression. Modern artificial intelligence (AI) methods are commonly employed in analyzing user-generated sentiment on social media. In the forthcoming systematic review, we will examine the content validity of these computer-based health surveillance models with respect to standard diagnostic frameworks. Drawing from a clinical perspective, we will attempt to establish a normative judgment about the strengths of these modern AI applications in the detection of depression.We will perform a systematic review of English and German language publications from 2010 to 2020 in PubMed, APA PsychInfo, Science Direct, EMBASE Psych, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. The inclusion criteria span cohort, case-control, cross-sectional studies, randomized controlled studies, in addition to reports on conference proceedings. The systematic review will exclude some gray source materials, specifically editorials, newspaper articles, and blog posts. Our primary outcome is self-reported depression, as expressed on social media. Secondary outcomes will be the types of AI methods used for social media depression screen, and the clinical validation procedures accompanying these methods. In a second step, we will utilize the evidence-strengthening Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, Study type (PICOS) tool to refine our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Following the independent assessment of the evidence sources by two authors for the risk of bias, the data extraction process will culminate in a thematic synthesis of reviewed studies.We present the protocol for a systematic review which will consider all existing literature from peer reviewed publication sources relevant to the primary and secondary outcomes. The completed review will discuss depression as a self-reported health outcome in social media material. We will examine the computational methods, including AI and machine learning techniques which are commonly used for online depression surveillance. Furthermore, we will focus on standard clinical assessments, as indicating content validity, in the design of the algorithms. The methodological quality of the clinical construct of the algorithms will be evaluated with the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) framework.

https://openalex.org/W3213961116,"Background The National guidelines of most developed countries suggest a target of 30 minutes of the decision to delivery interval for emergency cesarean section. Such guidelines may not be feasible in poorly resourced countries and busy obstetric settings. It is generally accepted that the decision to delivery interval should be kept to the minimum time achievable to prevent adverse outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the average decision to delivery interval and its effect on perinatal outcomes in emergency cesarean section. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted from May to July 2020 at Bahir Dar City Public Hospitals. A total of 182 participants were enrolled, and data were collected using a structured and pre-tested questionnaire. A systematic sampling technique was applied to select the study subjects. Data were cleaned and entered into Epi-Data version 4.6 and exported to SPSS version 25 software for analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of outcome variables, and variables with a p-value of &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results The average decision to delivery interval was 43.73 ±10.55 minutes. Anesthesia time [AOR = 2.1, 95%CI = (1.3–8.4)], and category of emergency cesarean section [AOR = 3, 95% CI = (2.1–11.5)] were predictors of decision to delivery interval. The prolonged decision to delivery interval had a statistically significant association with composite adverse perinatal outcomes (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = (1.2–6.5). Conclusion The average decision to delivery interval was longer than the recommended time. It should always be considered an important factor contributing to perinatal outcomes. Therefore, to prevent neonatal morbidity and mortality, a time-dependent action is needed."
https://openalex.org/W3214284923,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health problem requiring a reduction in inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. Point-of-Care C-Reactive Protein (POCCRP) tests could distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial causes of fever in malaria-negative patients and thus reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. However, the cost-effectiveness of POCCRP testing is unclear in low-income settings.A decision tree model was used to estimate cost-effectiveness of POCCRP versus current clinical practice at primary healthcare facilities in Afghanistan. Data were analysed from healthcare delivery and societal perspectives. Costs were reported in 2019 USD. Effectiveness was measured as correctly treated febrile malaria-negative patient. Cost, effectiveness and diagnostic accuracy parameters were obtained from primary data from a cost-effectiveness study on malaria rapid diagnostic tests in Afghanistan and supplemented with POCCRP-specific data sourced from the literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) reported the additional cost per additional correctly treated febrile malaria-negative patient over a 28-day time horizon. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses examined the impact of uncertainty of parameter inputs. Scenario analysis included economic cost of AMR per antibiotic prescription.The model predicts that POCCRP intervention would result in 137 fewer antibiotic prescriptions (6%) with a 12% reduction (279 prescriptions) in inappropriate prescriptions compared to current clinical practice. ICERs were $14.33 (healthcare delivery), $11.40 (societal), and $9.78 (scenario analysis) per additional correctly treated case.POCCRP tests could improve antibiotic prescribing among malaria-negative patients in Afghanistan. Cost-effectiveness depends in part on willingness to pay for reductions in inappropriate antibiotic prescribing that will only have modest impact on immediate clinical outcomes but may have long-term benefits in reducing overuse of antibiotics. A reduction in the overuse of antibiotics is needed and POCCRP tests may add to other interventions in achieving this aim. Assessment of willingness to pay among policy makers and donors and undertaking operational trials will help determine cost-effectiveness and assist decision making."
https://openalex.org/W3214387349,"Paracoccus denitrificans is a model organism for the study of oxidative phosphorylation. We demonstrate a very high respiratory capacity compared to mitochondria when normalizing to cytochrome aa3 content even in the absence of alternative terminal oxidases. To gain insight into conserved mechanisms of energy homeostasis, we characterized the metabolic response to K+ reintroduction. A rapid 3-4-fold increase in respiration occurred before substantial cellular K+ accumulation followed by a sustained increase of up to 6-fold that persisted after net K+ uptake stopped. Proton motive force (Δp) was slightly higher upon addition of K+ with ΔpH increasing and compensating for membrane potential (ΔΨ) depolarization. Blocking the F0F1-ATP synthase (Complex V) with venturicidin revealed that the initial K+-dependent respiratory activation was primarily due to K+ influx. However, the ability to sustain an increased respiration rate was partially dependent on Complex V activity. The 6-fold stimulation of respiration by K+ resulted in a small net reduction of most cytochromes, different from the pattern observed with chemical uncoupling and consistent with balanced input and utilization of reducing equivalents. Metabolomics showed increases in glycolytic and TCA cycle intermediates together with a decrease in basic amino acids, suggesting an increased nitrogen mobilization upon K+ replenishment. ATP and GTP concentrations increased after K+ addition, indicating a net increase in cellular potential energy. Thus, K+ stimulates energy generation and utilization resulting in an almost constant Δp and increased high-energy phosphates during large acute and steady state changes in respiration. The specific energy consuming processes and signaling events associated with this simultaneous activation of work and metabolism in P. denitrificans remain unknown. Nevertheless, this homeostatic behavior is very similar to that observed in mitochondria in tissues when cellular energy requirements increase. We conclude that the regulation of energy generation and utilization to maintain homeostasis is conserved across the prokaryote/eukaryote boundary."
https://openalex.org/W3214564403,"On 4th December 2020, a sudden outbreak, with neurological symptoms like seizures, loss of consciousness etc., was reported in a town from south India. By 3rd day about 400 people were involved. A multi disciplinary team from our institute visited the site to investigate the outbreak. Based on the case history and clinical examination of the patients, the team suspected a probable diagnosis of an acute pesticide, heavy metal and/or mycotoxin exposure for which, biological samples (blood, urine) were collected from those who reported the symptoms as well as from a few who did not report symptoms (controls). To identify the source, water and food samples were collected. The samples were subjected to ICP-MS for heavy metal analysis, LC-MS/MS for pesticide analysis, microbiological analysis and ELISA-Kit method for aflatoxins if any. Clinical and dietary details were collected from a total of 112 participants, of which, 103 cases (77 active cases at Hospital and 26 recovered cases from community) and 9 were controls. A total of 109 biological samples, 36 water samples and food samples were collected. The mean age of the study participants was 29.2 years. Among cases, Seizures were seen in 84%, loss of consciousness in 66%, mental confusion in 35%, pinpoint pupil in 11%. Triazophos (organophosphate) pesticide was present in 74% of Blood samples and its metabolites were present in 98% of the urine samples collected from the cases. All the ten heavy metals investigated including lead, mercury and nickel were found to be within permissible limits except for a few samples. No presence of mycotoxins was observed in Food samples. Water samples which included Head pump and reservoir were free from pesticides; however, all water samples from households of cases had triazophos pesticide with a mean concentration of 1.00 ug/L. Thus, it was concluded that, the probable cause of outbreak was Triazophos (Organophosphate) pesticide contamination in water at the Household level. Regular surveillance for the presence of residual pesticides in soil, water and food with heightened vigour is recommended to prevent future outbreaks."

Methods We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility (defined by uptake) of HIVST among FSW in Gaborone, Botswana. FSW age 18 years and above were recruited through a non-governmental organization serving FSW. FSW with unknown or negative HIV status at screening performed HIVST in the study clinic following brief training. FSW testing HIV-negative were each given two test kits to take home: one kit to perform unassisted HIVST and another to share with others. Feasibility (use) of HIVST (and sharing of test kits with others) was assessed in these women at a study visit four months later. Results Two hundred FSW were screened. Their average age was 34 years (range 18–59), and 115 (58%) were HIV-positive. Eighty-five (42%) tested HIV-negative at entry and were eligible to take part in the HIVST pilot study. All 85 (100%) agreed to take home HIVST kits. Sixty-nine (81%) of these 85 participants had a follow-up visit, 56 (81%) of whom reported performing HIVST at a mean of three and half months after the initial visit. All 56 participants who performed HIVST reported negative HIVST results. Fifty (73%) of the 69 participants who took HIVST kits home shared them with others. Of the 50 women sharing HIVST kits, 25 (50%) shared with their non-client partners, 15 with a family member, 8 with friends, and 3 with a client. One participant did not test herself but shared both her test kits. Most participants 53/56 (95%) found oral HIVST very easy to use whilst 3/56 (5%) felt it was fairly easy. Conclusion Oral HIVST is feasible among FSW in Gaborone, Botswana. The majority of FSW used the HIVST kits themselves and also shared extra HIVST kits with other individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3212279027,"We investigated modality differences in the N2 and P3 components of event-related potentials (ERPs) between somatosensory and auditory Go/No-go paradigms in eighteen healthy prepubescent children (mean age: 125.9±4.2 months). We also evaluated the relationship between behavioral responses (reaction time, reaction time variability, and omission and commission error rates) and amplitudes and latencies of N2 and P3 during somatosensory and auditory Go/No-go paradigms. The peak latency of No-go-N2 was significantly shorter than that of Go-N2 during somatosensory paradigms, but not during auditory paradigms. The peak amplitude of P3 was significantly larger during somatosensory than auditory paradigms, and the peak latency of P3 was significantly shorter during somatosensory than auditory paradigms. Correlations between behavioral responses and the P3 component were not found during somatosensory paradigms. On the other hand, in auditory paradigms, correlations were detected between the reaction time and peak amplitude of No-go-P3, and between the reaction time variability and peak latency of No-go-P3. A correlation was noted between commission error and the peak latency of No-go-N2 during somatosensory paradigms. Compared with previous adult studies using both somatosensory and auditory Go/No-go paradigms, the relationships between behavioral responses and ERP components would be weak in prepubescent children. Our data provide findings to advance understanding of the neural development of motor execution and inhibition processing, that is dependent on or independent of the stimulus modality."
https://openalex.org/W3214143322,"Purpose Many people experience unilateral degraded vision, usually owing to a developmental or age-related disorder. There are unresolved questions regarding the extent to which such unilateral visual deficits impact on sensorimotor performance; an important issue as sensorimotor limitations can constrain quality of life by restricting ‘activities of daily living’. Examination of the relationship between visual deficit and sensorimotor performance is essential for determining the functional implications of ophthalmic conditions. This study attempts to explore the effect of unilaterally degraded vision on sensorimotor performance. Methods In Experiment 1 we simulated visual deficits in 30 participants using unilateral and bilateral Bangerter filters to explore whether motor performance was affected in water pouring, peg placing, and aiming tasks. Experiment 2 (n = 74) tested the hypothesis that kinematic measures are associated with visuomotor deficits by measuring the impact of small visual sensitivity decrements created by monocular viewing on sensorimotor interactions with targets presented on a planar surface in aiming, tracking and steering tasks. Results In Experiment 1, the filters caused decreased task performance—confirming that unilateral (and bilateral) visual loss has functional implications. In Experiment 2, kinematic measures were affected by monocular viewing in two of three tasks requiring rapid online visual feedback (aiming and steering). Conclusions Unilateral visual loss has a measurable impact on sensorimotor performance. The benefits of binocular vision may be particularly important for some groups (e.g. older adults) where an inability to complete sensorimotor tasks may necessitate assisted living. There is an urgent need to develop rigorous kinematic approaches to the quantification of the functional impact of unilaterally degraded vision and of the benefits associated with treatments for unilateral ophthalmic conditions to enable informed decisions around treatment."

Methods This article is a retrospective chart review. Patients diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer were divided into two groups. The systemic treatment was compared with the patients who received a full response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST1.1) and those who did not attain CR (progression partial response and stable response) in terms of both PFS and OS data, and the effect of attaining CR to treatment on prognosis was evaluated. Results A total of 222 patients were included in the study. 202 of 222 patients could be evaluated in terms of complete response. All data from their files were tabulated and analyzed retrospectively. The mean age of diagnosis of the study group was 60.13 ± 12.52 years. The total number of patients who attained CR to treatment was 31 (15.3%); 171 (84.6%) patients did not attain CR. Patients who had a CR had longer median PFS times than patients who did not have a CR (15.2 vs. 7.4 months, P&lt;0.001 ). Patients who had CR had longer median survival times than patients who did not have a CR (39.2 vs. 16.9 months, P&lt;0.001 ). In subgroup patients who underwent primary surgery, the number of patients who attained CR was statistically higher compared with the number of patients who did not attain CR ( p&lt;0.001 ). Complete response was less common in the presence of liver metastasis and bone metastasis ( p = 0.041 and p = 0.046 , respectively), had a negative prognostic effect. In other words, 89.1% of patients with liver metastasis, 100.0% of patients with bone metastasis, and 88.7% of those who died did not have a CR to the treatment. According to multivariate analysis, CR to treatment, primary surgery, first-line chemotherapy (combination compared with fluoropyrimidine), and no bone metastasis were found to be predictors for OS. Conclusion Providing CR with systemic treatment in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) contributes to prognosis. The primary resection in our secondary acquisitions from the study, the number of metastatic regions and the combination therapy regimens also contributed to the prognosis."

Our research aimed to analyze the contribution of each item.Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the sample characteristics. The expected item score (EIS) was used to determine how the items contribute to the generic measure of frailty.This study showed that most of the EIS curves increased across the entire range of frailty levels, and most of the items discriminate relatively well over the entire frailty range. Items differentially contributed to the total frailty score and differentially discriminated between frailty levels.Although nearly all items monotonically increased with frailty levels, there were large differences between items in their ability to differentiate between persons being either weakly, moderately or highly frail."

The dietary inflammatory index (DII) designed by Shivappa et al. has been shown to capture the inflammatory potential of dietary behavior in a large number of epidemiological studies. Thus, the DII may serve as future tool to assess someone's nutritional inflammatory capacities and hence, the individual risks for NCD development later in life. The calculation method of the DII, however, can benefit from alternative mathematical steps, particularly regarding the transformation from standardized daily food consumption to percentile scores. Here, we provide novel approaches, the scaling-formula (SF) and scaling-formula with outlier detection (SFOD) methods, with the aim to optimize the DII calculation method proposed by Shivappa and colleagues. We illustrate on simulated data specific limitations of the original DII calculation and show the benefits of the SF/SFOD by using simulated data and data from the prospective TEENDIAB study cohort, which supports the application of SF/SFOD in future epidemiological and clinical studies."

In thyroid cancer, NKX2-1 expression decreases in parallel with declined differentiation. However, the molecular pathways and mechanisms connecting NKX2-1 to thyroid cancer phenotypes are largely unknown. This study aimed to examine the effects of NKX2-1 re-expression on dedifferentiated thyroid cancer cell death and explore the underlying mechanisms. A human papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line lacking NKX2-1 expression was infected with an adenoviral vector containing Nkx2-1. Cell viability decreased after Nkx2-1 transduction and apoptosis and necrosis were detected. Arginase 2 (ARG2), regulator of G protein signaling 4 (RGS4), and RGS5 mRNA expression was greatly increased in Nkx2-1-transducted cells. After suppressing these genes by siRNA, cell death, apoptosis, and necrosis decreased in RGS4 knockdown cells. These findings demonstrated that cell death was induced via apoptosis and necrosis by NKX2-1 re-expression and involves RGS4."
