https://openalex.org/W3198909684,"The independent emergence late in 2020 of the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 lineages of SARS-CoV-2 prompted renewed concerns about the evolutionary capacity of this virus to overcome public health interventions and rising population immunity. Here, by examining patterns of synonymous and non-synonymous mutations that have accumulated in SARS-CoV-2 genomes since the pandemic began, we find that the emergence of these three “501Y lineages” coincided with a major global shift in the selective forces acting on various SARS-CoV-2 genes. Following their emergence, the adaptive evolution of 501Y lineage viruses has involved repeated selectively favored convergent mutations at 35 genome sites, mutations we refer to as the 501Y meta-signature. The ongoing convergence of viruses in many other lineages on this meta-signature suggests that it includes multiple mutation combinations capable of promoting the persistence of diverse SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the face of mounting host immune recognition."
https://openalex.org/W3200461021,"Microglia are resident macrophages in the brain that emerge in early development and respond to the local environment by altering their molecular and phenotypic states. Fundamental questions about microglia diversity and function during development remain unanswered because we lack experimental strategies to interrogate their interactions with other cell types and responses to perturbations ex vivo. We compared human microglia states across culture models, including cultured primary and pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia. We developed a ""report card"" of gene expression signatures across these distinct models to facilitate characterization of their responses across experimental models, perturbations, and disease conditions. Xenotransplantation of human microglia into cerebral organoids allowed us to characterize key transcriptional programs of developing microglia in vitro and reveal that microglia induce transcriptional changes in neural stem cells and decrease interferon signaling response genes. Microglia additionally accelerate the emergence of synchronized oscillatory network activity in brain organoids by modulating synaptic density."

We hypothesized that a community-centered vaccination strategy that included mobilization, vaccination, and “activation” components could successfully reach an underserved Latinx population, utilizing its social networks to boost vaccination coverage. Methods Our community-academic-public health partnership, “Unidos en Salud,” utilized a theory-informed approach to design our “Motivate, Vaccinate, and Activate” COVID-19 vaccination strategy. Our strategy’s design was guided by the PRECEDE Model and sought to address and overcome predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing barriers to COVID-19 vaccination faced by Latinx individuals in San Francisco. We evaluated our prototype outdoor, “neighborhood” vaccination program located in a central commercial and transport hub in the Mission District in San Francisco, using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework during a 16-week period from February 1, 2021 to May 19, 2021. Programmatic data, city-wide COVID-19 surveillance data, and a survey conducted between May 2, 2021 and May 19, 2021 among 997 vaccinated clients ≥16 years old were used in the evaluation. Results There were 20,792 COVID-19 vaccinations administered at the neighborhood site during the 16-week evaluation period. Vaccine recipients had a median age of 43 (IQR 32–56) years, 53.9% were male and 70.5% were Latinx, 14.1% white, 7.7% Asian, 2.4% Black, and 5.3% other. Latinx vaccinated clients were substantially more likely than non-Latinx clients to have an annual household income of less than $50,000 a year (76.1% vs. 33.5%), be a first-generation immigrant (60.2% vs. 30.1%), not have health insurance (47.3% vs. 16.0%), and not have access to primary care provider (62.4% vs. 36.2%). The most frequently reported reasons for choosing vaccination at the site were its neighborhood location (28.6%), easy and convenient scheduling (26.9%) and recommendation by someone they trusted (18.1%); approximately 99% reported having an overall positive experience, regardless of ethnicity. Notably, 58.3% of clients reported that they were able to get vaccinated earlier because of the neighborhood vaccination site, 98.4% of clients completed both vaccine doses, and 90.7% said that they were more likely to recommend COVID-19 vaccination to family and friends after their experience; these findings did not substantially differ according to ethnicity. There were 40.3% of vaccinated clients who said they still knew at least one unvaccinated person (64.6% knew ≥3). Among clients who received both vaccine doses (n = 729), 91.0% said that after their vaccination experience, they had personally reached out to at least one unvaccinated person they knew (61.6% reached out to ≥3) to recommend getting vaccinated; 83.0% of clients reported that one or more friends, and/or family members got vaccinated as a result of their outreach, including 18.9% who reported 6 or more persons got vaccinated as a result of their influence. Conclusions A multi-component, “Motivate, Vaccinate, and Activate” community-based strategy addressing barriers to COVID-19 vaccination for the Latinx population reached the intended population, and vaccinated individuals served as ambassadors to recruit other friends and family members to get vaccinated."
https://openalex.org/W3199208005,"The current COVID-19 public health crisis, caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), has produced a devastating toll both in terms of human life loss and economic disruption. In this paper we present a machine-learning algorithm capable of identifying whether a given patient (actually infected or suspected to be infected) is more likely to survive than to die, or vice-versa. We train this algorithm with historical data, including medical history, demographic data, as well as COVID-19-related information. This is extracted from a database of confirmed and suspected COVID-19 infections in Mexico, constituting the official COVID-19 data compiled and made publicly available by the Mexican Federal Government. We demonstrate that the proposed method can detect high-risk patients with high accuracy, in each of four identified clinical stages, thus improving hospital capacity planning and timely treatment. Furthermore, we show that our method can be extended to provide optimal estimators for hypothesis-testing techniques commonly-used in biological and medical statistics. We believe that our work could be of use in the context of the current pandemic in assisting medical professionals with real-time assessments so as to determine health care priorities."
https://openalex.org/W3199585729,"Certain sulfated glycans, including those from marine sources, can show potential effects against SARS-CoV-2. Here, a new fucosylated chondroitin sulfate (FucCS) from the sea cucumber Pentacta pygmaea (PpFucCS) (MW ∼10-60 kDa) was isolated and structurally characterized by NMR. PpFucCS is composed of {→3)-β-GalNAcX-(1→4)-β-GlcA-[(3→1)Y]-(1→}, where X = 4S (80%), 6S (10%) or nonsulfated (10%), Y = α-Fuc2,4S (40%), α-Fuc2,4S-(1→4)-α-Fuc (30%), or α-Fuc4S (30%), and S = SO3-. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of PpFucCS and those of the FucCS and sulfated fucan isolated from Isostichopus badionotus (IbFucCS and IbSF) were compared with that of heparin. IC50 values demonstrated the activity of the three holothurian sulfated glycans to be ∼12 times more efficient than heparin, with no cytotoxic effects. The dissociation constant (KD) values obtained by surface plasmon resonance of the wildtype SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N501Y mutant RBD in interactions with the heparin-immobilized sensor chip were 94 and 1.8 × 103 nM, respectively. Competitive surface plasmon resonance inhibition analysis of PpFucCS, IbFucCS, and IbSF against heparin binding to wildtype S-protein showed IC50 values (in the nanomolar range) 6, 25, and 6 times more efficient than heparin, respectively. Data from computational simulations suggest an influence of the sulfation patterns of the Fuc units on hydrogen bonding with GlcA and that conformational change of some of the oligosaccharide structures occurs upon S-protein RBD binding. Compared with heparin, negligible anticoagulant action was observed for IbSF. Our results suggest that IbSF may represent a promising molecule for future investigations against SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W3199835653,"Countermeasures against the spread of COVID-19 have become an urgent issue in educational settings, where many group activities are necessary. Educators are key to preventing the spread of COVID-19 in educational settings. Infection prevention behavior requires comprehensive and complex measures such as self-restraint. disinfection care, hand washing, wearing masks and recommendation and implementation of vaccination. Improvement in the knowledge, skills, and preventive actions of educators vis-à-vis COVID-19 could allow for the continued provision of educational services while ensuring safety in educational settings. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore the knowledge and preventive actions of educators regarding COVID-19 and vaccination awareness to provide appropriate support for educators. The study used data collected from 1,000 Japanese educators in January 2021 when the third wave of viral infections spread. Online surveys and multivariate linear regression analysis were used to determine age and whether respondents were being cared for by a doctor. We investigated the effects of factors on educators’ willingness to be vaccinated and changes in their behavior. This study found that factors such as age, gender, whether a respondent was under a physician’s care, and health literacy, affected the willingness of educators to receive vaccinations and engage in preventive actions. The study also suggests that the reliability of national government public relations efforts is lower than the reliability of local government public relations and that of information from family physicians, pharmacies, and mass media. It is therefore necessary to reexamine how information is disseminated by the national government and to increase the degree of trust in that information among the public. The findings of the study also revealed the importance of improving the provision of appropriate information and health literacy for the behavior of educators, not only during the initial outbreak, but also during the subsequent period of pandemic life."

Here, we report five X-ray crystal structures of sybodies (synthetic nanobodies) including those of binary and ternary complexes of Sb16–RBD, Sb45–RBD, Sb14–RBD–Sb68, and Sb45–RBD–Sb68, as well as unliganded Sb16. These structures reveal that Sb14, Sb16, and Sb45 bind the RBD at the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 interface and that the Sb16 interaction is accompanied by a large conformational adjustment of complementarity-determining region 2. In contrast, Sb68 interacts at the periphery of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD–angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 interface. We also determined cryo-EM structures of Sb45 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Superposition of the X-ray structures of sybodies onto the trimeric spike protein cryo-EM map indicates that some sybodies may bind in both “up” and “down” configurations, but others may not. Differences in sybody recognition of several recently identified RBD variants are explained by these structures.

In addition, we report cryo-EM structures of Sb45 complexed with trimeric S and evaluate sybody interactions with several mutant RBDs, representative of newly evolving variants. Sybodies were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified via metal-affinity chromatography to high purity. These sybodies behaved as monomers by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (21Zimmermann I.

As determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), all five sybodies bind to the immobilized RBD with KD values of 6.8 to 62.7 nM, consistent with previous determinations using RBD-YFP or RBD-Fc molecules by related techniques (18Walter J.D.

To gain insight into the precise topology of the interaction of four of these sybodies with the RBD, we determined crystal structures of their complexes: Sb16–RBD and Sb45–RBD, the ternary Sb45–RBD–Sb68 and Sb14–RBD–Sb68, and Sb16 alone.

The Sb16–RBD complex (Figs. 2A and 3A) illustrates that complementarity-determining region 2 (CDR2) (residues 50–60) and complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) (residues 98–106) bestride the saddle-like region of the ACE2-binding surface of the RBD (see sequence alignment in Fig. 2F). Sb16 angulates over the RBD by 83°. However, Sb45 (Figs. 2B and 3B) straddles the RBD saddle in the opposite orientation, at an angle of −36°, and frames the interface with CDR2 (residues 50–59) and CDR3 (residues 97–111). Complementarity-determining region 1 (CDR1) of both sybodies (residues 27–35) lies between the CDR2 and CDR3 loops. Superposition of the two structures, based on the RBD, emphasizes the diametrically opposite orientation of the two (Fig. 2C), revealing that CDR2 of Sb16 and CDR3 of Sb45 recognize the same epitopic regions.Figure 3Interfaces and interactions of sybodies with the RBD.

The refined models revealed that while Sb14 and Sb45 interact with the ACE2 interface of the RBD, Sb68 binds the RBD at a distinct site (Fig. 2, D and E). In the ternary complex, Sb45 binds in an identical orientation to that observed in the binary Sb45–RBD structure (RMSD of superposition, 0.491 Å for 1981 atoms), but Sb68 addresses a completely different face of the RBD, similar to that bound by Fab of CR3022 on the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 (25Huo J.

Of particular interest, whereas Sb45 CDR2 and CDR3 span the RBD saddle as noted above, the distinct contacts of Sb68 to the RBD are through the longer CDR3, with only minor contributions from CDR1 and CDR2. Walter et al. (18Walter J.D. Hutter C.A.J. Garaeva A.A. Scherer M. Zimmermann I. Wyss M. Rheinberger J. Ruedin Y. Earp J. Egloff P. Sorgenfrei M. Hürlimann L.M. Gonda I. Meier G.

Similarly, Sb14, which interacts via distinct sybody residues with the RBD at the ACE2 site (see description below), still permits Sb68 to bind to its epitope as seen in the Sb45–RBD–Sb68 structure (Fig. 2D). Scrutiny of the different interfaces provides insights into the distinct ways each sybody exploits its unique CDR residues for interaction with epitopic residues of the RBD (Fig. 3). (Compilation of the contacting residues for each of the four sybodies to the RBD is provided in Table S1). Both Sb16 and Sb45 use longer CDR2 and CDR3 to straddle the RBD, positioning CDR1 residues over the central crest of the saddle (Figs. 2, A–C and 3, A and B and Table S1). In addition, several non-CDR residues (Y37, E44, and W47 for Sb16), derived from framework 2 (27Wu T.T. Kabat E.A. An analysis of the sequences of the variable regions of Bence Jones proteins and myeloma light chains and their implications for antibody complementarity.J. Exp. Med. 1970; 132: 211-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar), provide additional contacts to the RBD (see Table S1). In contrast with Sb16 and Sb45, Sb14, despite interacting with a large surface area of the RBD, uses both CDR2 and CDR3 on the same side and exploits many non-CDR residues, particularly sheets of β-strand as its binding surface (Fig. 3C and Table S1). The interface of Sb68 with the RBD (Fig. 3D) is quite different, predominantly exploiting nine CDR3, four CDR2, and one CDR1 residues at the interface (see Table S1). To evaluate the structural basis for the ability of these four sybodies to block the interaction of the RBD with ACE2, we superposed each of the three sybody–RBD structures onto the ACE2–RBD structure and examined the steric clashes (Fig. 4A). Sb16 and Sb45 directly impinge on the ACE2 binding site, offering a structural rationale for their viral neutralization capacity (18Walter J.D. Hutter C.A.J. Garaeva A.A. Scherer M. Zimmermann I. Wyss M. Rheinberger J. Ruedin Y. Earp J. Egloff P. Sorgenfrei M. Hürlimann L.M. Gonda I. Meier G. Remm S. et al.Highly potent bispecific sybodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2.bioRxiv. 2020; ([preprint])https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.10.376822Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Sb68, which also blocks viral infectivity, binds to the RBD at a site that appears to be noncompetitive for ACE2 binding. The carbohydrate at ACE2 residues N322 and N546 provides an explanation (Fig. 4A). To compare the epitopic areas captured by these sybodies, we evaluated the buried surface area (BSA) interfaces between the RBD and ACE2 or the sybodies. The BSA at the ACE2–RBD, Sb14–RBD, Sb16–RBD, Sb45–RBD, and Sb68–RBD interfaces is 844 Å2, 1040 Å2, 1003 Å2, 976 Å2, and 640 Å2, respectively (Fig. 3, A–E). Sb16 and Sb45 capture more surface area than ACE2 or other published nanobody or sybody–RBD complexes (see Table S2). The interface with Sb68 is the smallest (640 Å2) (Fig. 3D). The total BSA captured by Sb45 and Sb68 in the ternary complex is 1650 (1010 plus 640) Å2 (Table S2) and is consistent with the view that a linked bispecific sybody, as described by Walter et al. (18Walter J.D. Hutter C.A.J. Garaeva A.A. Scherer M. Zimmermann I. Wyss M. Rheinberger J. Ruedin Y. Earp J. Egloff P. Sorgenfrei M. Hürlimann L.M. Gonda I. Meier G. Remm S. et al.Highly potent bispecific sybodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2.bioRxiv. 2020; ([preprint])https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.10.376822Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar), would exert strong avidity effects. Table S2 summarizes these BSA values and those of other nanobody–RBD interactions. Although Sb68 reveals the smallest BSA with the RBD and binds at a distinct site, it still blocks ACE2 binding. A reasonable explanation for the ability of Sb68 to block the ACE2–RBD interaction arises on inspection of the sites where Sb68, bound to the RBD, might clash with ACE2. Scrutiny of a superposition of Sb68–RBD with ACE2–RBD reveals several areas of steric interference. Sb68 loops 40 to 44 clash with amino acid side chains of ACE2 (residues 318–320 and 548–552), loops 61 to 64 with ACE2 N322 carbohydrate, and loops 87 to 89 (a 310 helix) with ACE2 N546 carbohydrate as well as residues 313 and 316 to 218 (Fig. 4A). ACE2 used in the crystallographic visualization of ACE2–RBD (28Lan J. Ge J. Yu J. Shan S. Zhou H. Fan S. Zhang Q. Shi X. Wang Q. Zhang L. Wang X.

Electron density was observed only for the proximal N-glycans at residues N322 and N546, but larger, complex, nonsialylated, and biantennary carbohydrates have been detected in glycoproteomic analysis of ACE2 in mammalian cells (31Shajahan A.

These carbohydrates are highly flexible, adding greater than 1500 Da at each position and are larger than the single carbohydrate residues visualized in the crystal structure. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations of ACE2–RBD implicated the direct interaction of carbohydrate with the RBD (32Zhao P. Praissman J.L. Grant O.C. Cai Y. Xiao T. Rosenbalm K.E. Aoki K.

Thus, the ability of Sb68 to impinge on ACE2 interaction with the RBD likely involves the steric clash of the N322- and N546-linked glycans. We also obtained a 1.9 Å structure of free Sb16 (Fig. S3). Remarkably, CDR2 of Sb16 shows Y54 in starkly different positions in the unliganded structure as compared with the complex: the Cα carbon is displaced by 6.0 Å, while the Oη oxygen of Y54 is 15.2 Å distant, indicative of dynamic flexibility.

Multivalent interactions between protein low-complexity domains contribute to MLO organization. Previously, we used computational methods to identify structural motifs termed low-complexity amyloid-like reversible kinked segments (LARKS) that promote phase transition to form hydrogels and that are common in human proteins that participate in MLOs. Here, we searched for LARKS in the proteomes of six model organisms: Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, Plasmodium falciparum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Escherichia coli to gain an understanding of the distribution of LARKS in the proteomes of various species. We found that LARKS are abundant in M. tuberculosis, D. melanogaster, and H. sapiens but not in S. cerevisiae or P. falciparum. LARKS have high glycine content, which enables kinks to form as exemplified by the known LARKS-rich amyloidogenic structures of TDP43, FUS, and hnRNPA2, three proteins that are known to participate in MLOs. These results support the idea of LARKS as an evolved structural motif. Based on these results, we also established the LARKSdb Web server, which permits users to search for LARKS in their protein sequences of interest."

However, the function and regulatory mechanism of circRNAs in lower vertebrates are still unclear. Here, we discovered a novel circRNA derived from the gene encoding Bcl-2-like protein 1 (BCL2L1) gene, named circBCL2L1, which was related to the innate immune responses in teleost fish. Results indicated that circBCL2L1 played essential roles in host antiviral immunity and antibacterial immunity. Our study also identified a microRNA, miR-30c-3-3p, which could inhibit the innate immune response by targeting inflammatory mediator TRAF6. And TRAF6 is a key signal transduction factor in innate immune response mediated by TLRs. Moreover, we also found that the antiviral and antibacterial effects inhibited by miR-30c-3-3p could be reversed with the expression of circBCL2L1. Our data revealed that circBCL2L1 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) of TRAF6 by competing for binding with miR-30c-3-3p, leading to activation of the NF-κB/IRF3 inflammatory pathway and then enhancing the innate immune responses. Our results suggest that circRNAs can play an important role in the innate immune response of teleost fish."

By deploying a bundle tube monitoring system in the inlet air side and return air side of the goaf, changes in gas concentration in the goaf are continuously monitored. In addition, the distribution area for spontaneous combustion three-zone in the goaf is divided into heat dissipation zone, oxidized spontaneous combustion zone, and suffocation zone. Simulations from the COMSOL Multiphysics 5.3 software provide insight based on the three zones division standard of spontaneous combustion in the goaf. The gradual deepening of the nitrogen injection position into the goaf affects the lower limit of the oxidized spontaneous combustion zone significantly, but the impact on the upper limit of the oxidized spontaneous combustion zone is not obvious and is negligible. With regard to the width of the oxidized spontaneous combustion zone, it initially decreases followed by a gradual increase. Numerical calculations suggest the optimal nitrogen injection position is 40 m from the roof cutting line, with an oxidized spontaneous combustion zone width of 28 m. Based on the simulation analysis results, nitrogen injection controlling measures have been adopted for spontaneous combustion of residual coal in the goaf of the 1303 fully mechanized coal caving faces, and coal self-ignition in the goaf has been successfully extinguished."

Recent research has shown that these plants contain remarkable and unique substances with high biological activity. Five species of mosses from a large urban ecosystem were identified for present study. In order to determine their biological potential, multifaceted studies were carried out, including: total phenolics content, antioxidant activity, antimicrobial and antifungal study, cytotoxicity evaluation, and scratch assay to assess pro-regenerative effect in the context of their possible use as the ingredients of biologically active cosmetics. Additionally, determination of individual phenolic compounds in selected extracts of the tested mosses was made. Research showed that Ceratodon purpureus and Dryptodon pulvinatus extracts had the greatest potential as antioxidants and antimicrobial activity. The cytotoxicity assessment indicated that the extracts from Dryptodon pulvinatus and Rhytidiadelphus squarossus exerted the strongest negative effect on mouse fibroblast line L929 viability at higher concentrations. While, the extract from Tortulla murali s best stimulated human foreskin fibroblast line HFF-1 proliferation and wound healing. The research on individual phenolic compounds content in the extracts tested indicated over 20 peaks on UPLC chromatograms. The conducted study has shown that mosses, especially so far unexplored species of open ecosystems, and e.g. epilytic habitats, may be a valuable source of biologically active substances and thus may constitute important medical and cosmetic possibilities."
https://openalex.org/W3200551024,"The identification of the use of stone tools through use-wear analysis was one the major methodological advances in Prehistoric Archaeology during the second half of the 20th century. Studies of use-wear analysis have decisively contributed to a better understanding of the cognitive capacities and the socio-economic organization of Prehistoric societies. Among use-wear traces, microwear polish is the most relevant evidence, as it allows the identification of the worked materials (i.e. wood, antler, hide, bone, stone…). This identification is currently carried out through the qualitative and visual comparison of experimental and archaeological tools. During the last decade, confocal microscopy is allowing the quantitative identification of the worked material through the texture analysis of microwear polish. Previous tests have accounted for the variability of use-wear traces as caused by different types of worked material. However, how the intensity of use, which is widely recognized as an important factor conditioning microwear polish characteristics, affects our capacity to identify the worked materials is poorly understood. This research addresses the dynamic nature of microwear polish through confocal microscopy and texture analysis. This research shows that use-wear polishing is a dynamic process and surface texture evolves continuously during the working time. The evolution fits a logarithmic function, so most texture modification takes place during the first phases of work. The way in which polish texture evolves through time differs from one contact material to the other. We demonstrate that, despite the dynamic nature of use-wear polish, different worked materials can be discriminated. However, some overlapping between used and unused surfaces and between worked materials occurs in the first stages of use. Moreover, polishes of similar characteristics (i.e. bone and antler) can show similar texture at advanced stages of use. These problems in identification can be in good measure overcome by creating dynamic models of polish texture in which not only the worked material but also the time of use is considered."

One of the key reasons that influenced mothers’ choice to postpone, or avoid children’s vaccination, is knowledge. This study aimed to assess the level of Cypriot mothers’ knowledge on certain aspects of vaccination of their children, examine the association between vaccination knowledge and selected socio-demographic factors, and lastly assess the association of mothers’ knowledge about vaccination with vaccination coverage and delay, compliance to the recommended schedules, vaccination during pregnancy and mother-pediatrician relationship. Methods An online-based cross-sectional study conducted to collect information about socio-demographic characteristics, child’s characteristics, vaccination, and vaccine knowledge, using a self-administered questionnaire. The survey was conducted between April 2020 and June 2020 and the study population included mothers over 18 years old with at least one child (&lt;18 years old) living in Cyprus. Results A total of 703 Cypriot mothers participated in the study. Most of the participants stated that they vaccined their children (97%) and the most popular source of information about vaccination was their pediatrician (90%). More than half of the participants (57%) have delayed their child/children vaccination with their pediatrician’s suggestion being the main reason. 36% of mothers had low knowledge while the overall correct rate was 13.6% and the median (IQR) knowledge score was 11 (9–12). Having a medium knowledge about vaccination was associated with having a medium or high income, whilst high knowledge compared to low knowledge was associated with completed a higher education and having a high income. Our analysis showed that the correct knowledge by mothers with regards to vaccination increases the probability of vaccinating their children, following the local recommendations for vaccine dosages, and acquiring and trusting vaccination-related information from their children’s pediatrician. Conclusion Our findings show that the majority of mothers in Cyprus had positives perceptions regarding childhood vaccination, as reflected with the high vaccination rate, however, some aspects of mothers’ knowledge of vaccination need to be improved. Public health strategies to promote vaccination, education programs as well as improved communication tools between pediatricians and mothers need to be considered to achieve favorable vaccination attitudes and practices for all mothers in Cyprus."
https://openalex.org/W3199624118,"Objectives To explore the association between changes in personal circumstances and shifts in pregnancy intentions. Study design New start contraceptive clients, who desired to prevent pregnancy for at least one year enrolled in the survey arm of the HER Salt Lake Contraceptive Initiative (September 2015 –March 2017) and responded to the question “What are your future pregnancy plans?” at enrollment and 12-month follow-up. We estimated multivariable binary logistic fixed-effects regressions to examine the association between changes in personal circumstances and a change from never desiring a pregnancy at enrollment to considering one in the future at 12-month follow-up. Results The majority of the 2825 participants (2246, 79%) maintained their pregnancy timing intention over the 12-month study period. Multivariable analyses of the 208 participants who changed from never desiring a pregnancy to considering pregnancy in the future at 12-month follow-up indicated that entering cohabitation (aOR 3.14, 95% CI 1.30–7.58), increased household income (aOR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00–1.13), and changes from unemployment to full-time employment (aOR 5.94, 95% CI 1.29–27.36) are associated with increased the odds of desiring a future pregnancy after never wanting one a year prior. Conclusions Pregnancy intentions are dynamic over twelve months and covary with partner status, household income, and employment status. Pregnancy intentions are linked to changes in life circumstances. Health care providers need to frequently assess pregnancy intentions and resulting contraceptive or preconception needs."

In this paper, the influence of parallel-joint spacing on the size effect and characteristic size of rock uniaxial compressive strength is studied by establishing five types of parallel-joint-spacing simulation schemes. The influence of parallel-joint spacing on the size effect of rock uniaxial compressive strength is explored by analyzing the stress–strain curves of rocks with different parallel-joint spacings and rock sizes. The relationship between the uniaxial compressive strength and the size of the rock with parallel joints and its special mathematical model are obtained, and the particular form of the compressive-strength characteristic size and parallel-joint spacing is obtained."
https://openalex.org/W3200198976,"While research has focused on understanding teachers' attitudes towards the inclusion of children with special educational needs into general education classrooms, there are lacunae that have yet to be addressed. This study examined the association between perceived self-efficacy and attitudes towards inclusion among elementary school teachers. The study also examined the role of teachers' self-efficacy as a mediating variable between knowledge of inclusion policy, perception of school support and teachers' attitudes towards inclusion.Teachers (N = 352) working in general or special education schools completed questionnaires assessing attitudes towards inclusion, sense of self-efficacy, knowledge of current policy, and perception of support for inclusive practices.Higher perceived knowledge of inclusion policy and higher perceived school support of inclusion were both related to higher self-efficacy regarding inclusion, which, in turn, was related to more positive attitudes about inclusion.Our results suggest that point to being knowledgeable regarding local and national policy is important in order to increase feelings of self-efficacy regarding the implementation of effective educational practice. To enhance inclusion, local and national policy must be clearly communicated to teachers. Furthermore, leadership and a supportive school environment are conducive to successful inclusive education."
https://openalex.org/W3134925750,"Emotion dynamics is a framework for measuring how an individual’s emotions change over time. It is a powerful tool for understanding how we behave and interact with the world. In this paper, we introduce a framework to track emotion dynamics through one’s utterances. Specifically we introduce a number of utterance emotion dynamics (UED) metrics inspired by work in Psychology. We use this approach to trace emotional arcs of movie characters. We analyze thousands of such character arcs to test hypotheses that inform our broader understanding of stories. Notably, we show that there is a tendency for characters to use increasingly more negative words and become increasingly emotionally discordant with each other until about 90% of the narrative length. UED also has applications in behavior studies, social sciences, and public health."
https://openalex.org/W3199458848,"A growing number of studies suggest that the frequency of numeracy experiences that parents provide at home may relate to children's mathematical development. However, the relation between home numeracy practices and children's numerical skills is complex and might depend upon both the type and difficulty of activities, as well as the type of math skills. Studies have also argued that this relation may be driven by factors that are not systematically controlled for in the literature, including socio-economic status (SES), parental math skills and children's IQ. Finally, as most prior studies have focused on preschoolers, it remains unclear to what extent there remains a relation between the home numeracy environment and math skills when children are in elementary school. In the present study, we tested an extensive range of math skills in 66 8-year-olds, including non-symbolic quantity processing, symbolic number understanding, transcoding, counting, and mental arithmetic. We also asked parents to complete a questionnaire about their SES, academic expectations, academic attitudes, and the numeracy practices that they provide at home. Finally, we measured their arithmetic fluency as a proxy for parental math skills. Over and above differences in socio-economic status, parental arithmetic fluency, child's IQ, and time spent with the child, we found a positive relation between the frequency of formal numeracy practices that were at or above grade level and two separate measures of mental arithmetic. We further found that the frequency of these advanced formal numeracy practices was related to parents' academic expectations. Therefore, our study shows that home numeracy experiences predict arithmetic skills in elementary school children, but only when those activities are formal and sufficiently challenging for children."
https://openalex.org/W3199725821,"The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have adverse effects on the economy through damage to migration and remittances. We use a unique monthly household panel dataset that covers the period both before and after the outbreak to examine the impacts of COVID-19 on a variety of household welfare outcomes in Tajikistan, where remittance inflows in recent years have exceeded a quarter of annual GDP. We provide several findings. First, after April 2020, the adverse effects of the pandemic on household welfare were significantly observed and were particularly pronounced in the second quarter of 2020. Second, in contrast to expectation, the pandemic had a sharp but only transitory effect on the stock of migrants working abroad in the spring. Some expected migrants were forced to remain in their home country during the border closures, while some incumbent migrants expecting to return were unable to do so and remained employed in their destination countries. Both departures and returns started to increase again from summer. Employment and remittances of the migrants quickly recovered to levels seen in previous years after a sharp decline in April and May. Third, regression analyses reveal that both migration and remittances have helped to mitigate the adverse economic outcomes at home during the “with-COVID-19” period, suggesting that they served as a form of insurance. Overall, the unfavorable effects of the COVID-19 pandemic were severe and temporary right after the outbreak, but households with migrants were more resilient against the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3199802213,"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) catalyze the charging of specific amino acids onto cognate tRNAs, an essential process for protein synthesis. Mutations in ARSs are frequently associated with a variety of human diseases. The human EPRS1 gene encodes a bifunctional glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS) with two catalytic cores and appended domains that contribute to nontranslational functions. In this study, we report compound heterozygous mutations in EPRS1, which lead to amino acid substitutions P14R and E205G in two patients with diabetes and bone diseases. While neither mutation affects tRNA binding or association of EPRS with the multisynthetase complex, E205G in the glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (ERS) region of EPRS is defective in amino acid activation and tRNAGlu charging. The P14R mutation induces a conformational change and altered tRNA charging kinetics in vitro. We propose that the altered catalytic activity and conformational changes in the EPRS variants sensitize patient cells to stress, triggering an increased integrated stress response (ISR) that diminishes cell viability. Indeed, patient-derived cells expressing the compound heterozygous EPRS show heightened induction of the ISR, suggestive of disruptions in protein homeostasis. These results have important implications for understanding ARS-associated human disease mechanisms and development of new therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W3200313915,"Colobine monkeys are known for the anatomical complexity of their stomachs, making them distinct within the primate order. Amongst foregut fermenters, they appear peculiar because of the occurrence of two different stomach types, having either three ('tripartite') or four ('quadripartite', adding the praesaccus) chambers. The functional differences between tri and quadripartite stomachs largely remain to be explained. In this study, we aim to compare the apparent digestibility (aD) in tripartite and quadripartite colobines. Hence, we measured the aD in two colobine species, Nasalis larvatus (quadripartite) and Trachypithecus cristatus (tripartite), in two zoos. We also included existing colobine literature data on the aD and analysed whether the aD of fibre components is different between the stomach types to test the hypothesis of whether quadripartite colobines show higher aD of fibre components than tripartite colobines did. Our captive N. larvatus specimen had a more distinctively varying nutrient intake across seasons with a larger seasonal variation in aD than that of a pair of T. cristatus, which mostly consumed commercial foods with a lower proportion of browse and less seasonal variation. We observed higher aD of dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) in the N. larvatus specimen, suggesting a higher gut capacity of N. larvatus provided by the additional praesaccus forestomach chamber. Based on the analysis of literature data for aD, we also found that quadripartite species achieved higher fibre digestibility at similar dietary fibre levels compared with tripartite species, supporting the hypothesis that the additional gut capacity offered by the praesaccus facilitates a longer retention and hence more thorough microbial fermentation of plant fibre."
https://openalex.org/W3201597998,"Knowledge of the ecology of the fish fauna associated with kelp (primarily Macrocystis pyrifera ) forests in Southern Patagonia is scarce, especially in how abiotic and biotic variables influence their structure, diversity, and distribution. This information is important for the management and conservation of this unique ecosystem, which has minimal anthropogenic impacts at present. We analyzed data from 122 quantitative underwater transects conducted within kelp forests at 61 stations from Chile’s southern Patagonian fjords to the Cape Horn and Diego Ramirez archipelagos and the southern tip of Argentina, including the Mitre Peninsula and Isla de los Estados. In total, 25 fish species belonging to 13 families were observed. Multivariate analysis indicated that there are significant differences in fish assemblage structure among locations and wave exposures, which was driven primarily by Patagonotothen sima and Paranotothenia magellanica , which occurred on exposed and semi-exposed stations. P . cornucola was mainly distributed across sheltered stations of the Kawésqar National Park. Temperature, salinity, depth, and kelp density influenced fish assemblage structure, with the highest diversity in areas with the lowest temperature and greater depth at Isla de los Estados. In contrast, species richness, diversity, abundance, and biomass were all lower in areas with high density of the understory kelp Lessonia spp., which might be driven by the absence of P . tessellata , P . squamiceps and P . cornucola , the most important species in terms of occurrence, abundance, and biomass. Our study provides the first broad-scale description of the fish assemblages associated with kelp forests along the southern cone of South America based on non-invasive visual transects, improving our knowledge of the distribution of fish assemblages across several environmental conditions in this vast and little-studied area."

Using consumer behavior data left on the Internet to predict repurchase behavior is of great significance for companies to achieve precision marketing. This paper proposes an improved deep forest model, and the interactive behavior characteristics of users and goods are added into the original feature model to predict the repurchase behavior of e-commerce consumers. Based on the Alibaba mobile e-commerce platform data set, first construct a feature engineering that includes user characteristics, product characteristics, and interactive behavior characteristics. And then use our proposed model to make predictions. Experiments show that the model’s overall performance with increased interactive behavior features is better and has higher accuracy. Compared with the existing prediction models, the improved deep forest model has certain advantages, which not only improves the prediction accuracy but also reduces the cost of training time."
https://openalex.org/W3200623274,"Background Ineffective linkage to care (LTC) is a known challenge for community HIV testing. To overcome this challenge, a robust linkage to care strategy was adopted by the 2018 Nigeria HIV/AIDS Indicator and Impact Survey (NAIIS). The NAIIS linkage to care strategy was further adapted to improve Nigeria’s programmatic efforts to achieve the 1 st 90 as part of the Nigeria Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) Surge initiative, which also included targeted community testing. In this paper we provide an overview of the NAIIS LTC strategy and describe the impact of this strategy on both the NAIIS and the Surge initiatives. Methods The NAIIS collaborated with community-based organizations (CBOs) and deployed mobile health (mHealth) technology with real-time dashboards to manage and optimize community LTC for people living with HIV (PLHIV) diagnosed during the survey. In NAIIS, CBOs’ role was to facilitate linkage of identified PLHIV in community to facility of their choice. For the ART Surge, we modified the NAIIS LTC strategy by empowering both CBOs and mobile community teams as responsible for not only active LTC but also for community testing, ART initiation, and retention in care. Results Of the 2,739 PLHIV 15 years and above identified in NAIIS, 1,975 (72.1%) were either unaware of their HIV-positive status (N = 1890) or were aware of their HIV-positive status but not receiving treatment (N = 85). Of these, 1,342 (67.9%) were linked to care, of which 952 (70.9%) were initiated on ART. Among 1,890 newly diagnosed PLHIV, 1,278 (67.6%) were linked to care, 33.7% self-linked and 66.3% were linked by CBOs. Among 85 known PLHIV not on treatment, 64 (75.3%) were linked; 32.8% self-linked and 67.2% were linked by a CBO. In the ART Surge, LTC and treatment initiation rates were 98% and 100%, respectively. Three-month retention for monthly treatment initiation cohorts improved from 76% to 90% over 6 months. Conclusions Active LTC strategies by local CBOs and mobile community teams improved LTC and ART initiation in the ART Surge initiative. The use of mHealth technology resulted in timely and accurate documentation of results in NAIIS. By deploying mHealth in addition to active LTC, CBOs and mobile community teams could effectively scale up ART with real-time documentation of client-level outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3200627340,"Syrian refugees in Lebanon have endured increasing hardships since the onset of the Syrian war in 2011, with many resorting to child labor. Working refugee children endure socioeconomic deprivation and harsh working conditions. This study explores the relationship between working conditions and the reporting of injuries among male and female Syrian refugee children in Lebanon and the related gender differences.A cross-sectional survey of Syrian refugee children working in the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon was conducted in 2017. Face-to-face interviews with children (8 to 18 years) collected sociodemographic information and testimonies of their work experiences. Logistic regression tested the association between reporting of injuries and risk factors including school enrolment, field of work, means of transportation to work, age started working, number of working hours, multiple jobs, work pressure and hazards, and abuse. Analyses were stratified by gender. Of the 4090 surveyed working children, the majority reported working in agriculture (75.8%). Around a third (31.4%) reported being injured at work with a higher proportion in males. The most common reported injuries were cuts and wounds (44.9%), with males showing a higher proportion for all types of injuries compared to females. Nearly one fifth of reported injuries (19.8%) required medical attention in a hospital, with males reporting higher proportions than females for most types of injuries. The study findings revealed the association of multiple risk factors with an increased odds of reporting an injury, which included working in more than one job (AOR, 1.71; CI, 1.20-2.43; p = 0.003), working under pressure (AOR, 1.64; CI, 1.36-1.97; p<0.001), the use of sharp or heavy objects (AOR, 1.88; CI, 1.58-2.24; p<0.001), and experiencing physical abuse at work (AOR, 2.46; CI, 1.97-3.08; p<0.001). The odds of reporting an injury increased with every additional hour of work per day (AOR 1.08; CI, 1.02-1.14; p = 0.006). Most of these findings persisted in the male and female stratified models, with few exceptions. Males who went to work in a pickup truck had significantly lower odds of being injured than those who walked (AOR, 0.65; CI, 0.51-0.83; p = 0.001); this finding did not reach significance for females. Having longer work hours per day was significantly linked to higher odds of injury for females (AOR, 1.07; CI, 1.02-1.12; p = 0.008); but not for males. The main limitations of this study were its cross-sectional design and the use of self-reported variables.This study is the first to obtain direct testimony on work-related injuries and working conditions, exploring gender differences, among Syrian refugee children in Lebanon. Results demonstrated the association between the occurrence of injury and multiple risk factors highlighting their strenuous working conditions, with some differences detected between males and females. Many injuries can be prevented through direct safety interventions and proper implementation of child labor policies. Multidimensional interventions are essential to address the complex evolving challenges facing refugees."
https://openalex.org/W3200439633,"The thermal environment of village public space affects the comfort of people ' s outdoor activities, and then affects the willingness of residents to outdoor activities, which has an important impact on the villagers' quality of life. Previously published studies of thermal comfort mostly focused on the evaluation of thermal comfort index, few studies on the application of thermal comfort planning. The study was carried out in Maling Village, Changdai Town, Mengjin County, Luoyang City, Henan Province, China. Square, street, green space were chosen as three typical public spaces where thermal comfort indexes were measured by questionnaire survey and field measurement during summer. Subsequently, the village's microclimate environment was simulated with ArcGIS 10.6 and ENVI-met. The results indicate that during the summer, the influences of temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, and relative humidity on the subjective comfort conditions of the outdoor environment gradually decreased. The spatial form of village has an important influence on thermal comfort. Finally, based on the results, this study put forward the thermal comfort process and planning scheme of the village outdoor space."

We investigated the risk factors for unfavorable outcomes of patients with brain abscess. Methods A retrospective cohort study examined patients with brain abscess seen from May 2005 to December 2018 in a tertiary care hospital in Seoul, South Korea. We reviewed the medical records for clinical findings, therapeutic modalities, and prognostic factors of brain abscess. Unfavorable clinical outcomes were defined as death, moderate to severe disability with neurological deficits, or vegetative state at 1 year or at the time of discharge from outpatient follow-up. Results The study enrolled 135 patients: 65.2% were males; the mean age was 56 years. 35.6% had unfavorable outcomes. In multivariate analysis, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) ( p &lt; 0.001), pre-existing hemiplegia ( p = 0.049), and higher Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) ( p = 0.028) were independently associated with unfavorable outcomes. Conclusions Higher SOFA, pre-existing hemiplegia and higher Charlson comorbidity index were significant risk factors for unfavorable clinical outcomes in patients with brain abscess."
https://openalex.org/W3199537994,"Whereas proteolytic cleavage is crucial for peptide presentation by classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins to T cells, glycolipids presented by CD1 molecules are typically presented in an unmodified form. However, the mycobacterial lipid antigen mannosyl-β1-phosphomycoketide (MPM) may be processed through hydrolysis in antigen presenting cells, forming mannose and phosphomycoketide (PM). To further test the hypothesis that some lipid antigens are processed, and to generate antigens that lead to defined epitopes for future tuberculosis vaccines or diagnostic tests, we aimed to create hydrolysis-resistant MPM variants that retain their antigenicity. Here, we designed and tested three different, versatile synthetic strategies to chemically stabilize MPM analogs. Crystallographic studies of CD1c complexes with these three new MPM analogs showed anchoring of the lipid tail and phosphate group that is highly comparable to nature-identical MPM, with considerable conformational flexibility for the mannose head group. MPM-3, a difluoromethylene-modified version of MPM that is resistant to hydrolysis, showed altered recognition by cells, but not by CD1c proteins, supporting the cellular antigen processing hypothesis. Furthermore, the synthetic analogs elicited T cell responses that were cross-reactive with nature-identical MPM, fulfilling important requirements for future clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W3199905384,"Background &amp; aims Fatty liver is associated with incident diabetes, and the fatty liver index (FLI) is a surrogate marker for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We aimed to determine whether or not FLI was associated with incident diabetes in relation to obesity and prediabetic levels in the general Japanese population. Methods This was a retrospective study using the Japanese health check-up database of one health insurance from FY2015 to FY2018. This study included 28,991 individuals with prediabetes. First, we stratified all participants into two groups: “high-risk,” comprising patients with HbA1c &gt;6.0%, and “standard,” comprising the rest. Subsequently, we divided them into four groups according to FLI (&lt;30 or not) and obesity (BMI &lt;25 kg/m 2 or not). Subsequently, the incidence rate of diabetes was compared among the groups after 3 years of follow-up using multiple logistic regression models after adjusting for potential confounders. Results After 3 years of follow-up, 1,547 new cases of diabetes were found, and the cumulative incidence was 2.96% for the standard group and 26.1% for the high-risk group. In non-obese individuals, odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for FLI ≥30 versus FLI &lt;30 were: 1.44 (1.09–1.92) for the standard group and 1.42 (0.99–2.03) for the high-risk group. In the high-risk group, obesity (BMI ≥25 kg/m 2 ) but FLI &lt;30 was not a risk factor for developing diabetes. Conclusion Although high FLI is generally considered to be a risk factor for developing diabetes, obesity might have been a confounding factor. However, the present study showed that high FLI is a risk factor for the development of diabetes, even in non-obese individuals. Our results include suggestion to develop a screening tool to effectively identify people at high risk of developing diabetes from the population (especially non-obese prediabetes) who are apparently at low health risk and are unlikely to be targeted for health guidance."
https://openalex.org/W3200275235,"Background Oral health is closely related to both physical and psychological well-being, as it enables individuals to eat, speak, and socialize. The number of teeth is the most used indicator of oral health. Several reports document a relationship of dental status with a variety of indicators of general health but longitudinal studies employing standardized physical performance tests are infrequent in the scientific literature. Subjects and methods The Italian elderly participating in the Pro.V.A. longitudinal Study (3099 subjects aged 65+ at baseline, 2196 at the 5-year follow-up 1 and 1641 at the 7-year follow- up 2) underwent detailed interview and extensive clinical and instrumental examination that included validated physical performance measures. Participants were classified into 4 groups according to the number of remaining teeth: 0, 1–7, 8–19, and 20+. To explore the association of the number of remaining teeth with physical function and disability, we performed logistic regression analyses with models progressively adjusted for a wide number of covariates, namely anthropometric (gender, age, BMI), comorbidity (cardio-vascular, osteoarticular, and neurological diseases including depression), muscle strength (assessed for upper and lower limbs), lifestyle (smoking status, alcohol use, leisure time activities) and socioeconomical status (education, income, marital status, loneliness). Results Dental status correlated with most comorbidities, lifestyle, and socio-economic variables at the univariate analysis at baseline and at follow-ups. A good dental status was significantly associated with better physical functioning and lower disability. The presence of 20+ teeth resulted significantly protective (reference group: 0 teeth) versus mobility-related disability (OR = 0.67), disability (OR = 0.54) and inability to perform heavy duties (OR = 0.62), at follow up 1 and low physical performance score (OR = 0.59) at follow up 2. Conversely, the detrimental effect of edentulism, explored in subjects with or without dentures, was present but not as straightforward. Conclusion. The assessment of a geriatric patient should include an oral evaluation as a good dental status is a crucial component of successful aging."
https://openalex.org/W3200357041,"Different forms of photoreceptor degeneration cause blindness. Retinal degeneration-3 protein (RD3) deficiency in photoreceptors leads to recessive congenital blindness. We proposed that aberrant activation of the retinal membrane guanylyl cyclase (RetGC) by its calcium-sensor proteins (guanylyl cyclase-activating protein [GCAP]) causes this retinal degeneration and that RD3 protects photoreceptors by preventing such activation. We here present in vivo evidence that RD3 protects photoreceptors by suppressing activation of both RetGC1 and RetGC2 isozymes. We further suggested that insufficient inhibition of RetGC by RD3 could contribute to some dominant forms of retinal degeneration. The R838S substitution in RetGC1 that causes autosomal-dominant cone-rod dystrophy 6, not only impedes deceleration of RetGC1 activity by Ca2+GCAPs but also elevates this isozyme's resistance to inhibition by RD3. We found that RD3 prolongs the survival of photoreceptors in transgenic mice harboring human R838S RetGC1 (R838S+). Overexpression of GFP-tagged human RD3 did not improve the calcium sensitivity of cGMP production in R838S+ retinas but slowed the progression of retinal blindness and photoreceptor degeneration. Fluorescence of the GFP-tagged RD3 in the retina only partially overlapped with immunofluorescence of RetGC1 or GCAP1, indicating that RD3 separates from the enzyme before the RetGC1:GCAP1 complex is formed in the photoreceptor outer segment. Most importantly, our in vivo results indicate that, in addition to the abnormal Ca2+ sensitivity of R838S RetGC1 in the outer segment, the mutated RetGC1 becomes resistant to inhibition by RD3 in a different cellular compartment(s) and suggest that RD3 overexpression could be utilized to reduce the severity of cone-rod dystrophy 6 pathology."
https://openalex.org/W3200864495,"Background Despite declining HIV infection rates, persistent racial and ethnic disparities remain. Appropriate calculations of diagnosis rates by HIV transmission category, race and ethnicity, and geography are needed to monitor progress towards reducing systematic disparities in health outcomes. We estimated the number of heterosexually active adults (HAAs) by sex and state to calculate appropriate HIV diagnosis rates and disparity measures within subnational regions. Methods The analysis included all HIV diagnoses attributed to heterosexual transmission in 2018 in the United States, in 50 states and the District of Columbia. Logistic regression models estimated the probability of past-year heterosexual activity among adults in three national health surveys, by sex, age group, race and ethnicity, education category, and marital status. Model-based probabilities were applied to estimated counts of HAAs by state, which were synthesized through meta-analysis. HIV diagnoses were overlaid to calculate racial- and ethnic-specific rates, rate differences (RDs), and rate ratios (RRs) among HAAs by sex and state. Results Nationally, HAA women have a two-fold higher HIV diagnosis rate than HAA men (rate per 100,000 HAAs, women: 6.57; men: 3.09). Compared to White non-Hispanic HAAs, Black HAAs have a 20-fold higher HIV diagnosis rate (RR, men: 21.28, women: 19.55; RD, men: 15.40, women: 31.78) and Hispanic HAAs have a 4-fold higher HIV diagnosis rate (RR, men: 4.68, RD, women: 4.15; RD, men: 2.79, RD, women: 5.39). Disparities were ubiquitous across regions, with &gt;75% of states in each region having Black-to-White RR ≥10. Conclusion The racial and ethnic disparities across regions suggests a system-wide failure particularly with respect to preventing HIV among Black and Hispanic women. Pervasive disparities emphasize the role for coordinated federal responses such as the current Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative."

A diet that restricted caffeine consumption for 24 hours was implemented. The participants answered questionnaires (the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory-THI, the Visual Analog Scale-VAS, the profile of mood state-POMS) and underwent examinations (tonal and high frequency audiometry, acufenometry (frequency measure; intensity measure and the minimum level of tinnitus masking), transient otoacoustic emissions-TEOAE and distortion product otoacoustic emissions-DPOAE assessments) at two timepoints: at baseline and after capsule ingestion.There was a significant change in mood (measured by the POMS) after caffeine consumption. The THI and VAS scores were improved at the second timepoint in both groups. The audiometry assessment showed a significant difference in some frequencies between baseline and follow-up measurements in both groups, but these differences were not clinically relevant. Similar findings were observed for the amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio in the TEOAE and DPOAE measurements.Caffeine (300 mg) did not significantly alter the psychoacoustic measures, electroacoustic measures or the tinnitus-related degree of discomfort."

To induce chronic colitis, dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was given to adult rats for 5 days followed by 9 days with normal drinking water for 4 cycles over 8 weeks. Echocardiography was performed to evaluate heart function. DSS-induced colitis led to a significant decrease in ejection fraction, increased left ventricular mass and size, and elevated B-type natriuretic protein. MicroRNA profiling showed a total of 56 miRNAs significantly increased in the heart by colitis, 8 of which are predicted to target brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). RT-qPCR validated the increases of miR-1b, Let-7d, and miR-155. Transient transfection revealed that miR-155 significantly suppresses BDNF in H9c2 cells. Importantly, DSS colitis markedly decreased BDNF in both myocardium and serum. Levels of various proteins critical to cardiac homeostasis were also altered. Functional studies showed that BDNF increases cell viability and mitigates H2O2-induced oxidative damage in H9c2 cells, demonstrating its protective role in the adult heart. Mechanistically, cellular experiments identified IL-1β as the inflammatory mediator upregulating cardiac miR-155; this effect was confirmed in adult rats. Furthermore, IL-1β neutralizing antibody ameliorated the DSS-induced increase in miR-155 and concurrent decrease in BDNF in the adult heart, showing therapeutic potential. Our findings indicate that chronic colitis impairs heart function through an IL-1β→miR-155→BDNF signaling axis."
https://openalex.org/W3199044382,"Background The Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Malaria are meant to guide medical practitioners to enhance optimal management of patients suspected of having malaria which is vital to malarial control and elimination. Medical doctors have the main responsibility for treating patients with malaria so there was need to evaluate the extent to which the medical doctors in Ebonyi state, Nigeria, knew, viewed, and practiced the 2015 National Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Malaria. Methods A cross-sectional survey was carried out in May, 2019 among medical doctors who were involved in the management of malaria patients and selected via convenience sampling. Data was collected using a structured self-administered questionnaire. Each respondent was categorized as having poor, fair, or good knowledge, attitude, and practice respectively based on knowledge, attitude, and practice scores of &lt;50%, 50–75%, and &gt;75%. Associated factors were evaluated through bivariate and multivariate binomial logistic regressions at 5% probability of type one error and the overall test for the effect of each independent factor on practice level was done using the “postestimation test” command in Stata. Results A total of 156 medical doctors were surveyed. Most, 138 (88.5%) were aware there was a national guideline for diagnosis and treatment of malaria. Among the medical doctors, 19 (12.2%) had good knowledge, 110 (70.5%) had fair knowledge, and 27 (17.3%) had poor knowledge; 38 (24.4%) had good attitude, 74 (47.4%) had fair attitude, and 44 (28.2%) had poor attitude; and 59 (37.8%) had good practice, 90 (57.7%) had fair practice, and 7 (4.5%) had poor practice. The attitude level of the medical doctors toward the 2015 National Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Malaria was a predictor of good practice (adjusted p-value of overall effect = 0.0003). Conclusions Although most of the medical doctors in Ebonyi state, Nigeria, were aware of the existence of a national guideline, only just over a third of them had good practice of the 2015 National Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Malaria. Policy interventions should focus on improving the attitude of the medical doctors toward the National Guidelines through training and re-training."
https://openalex.org/W3200201870,"One of the major causes of early pregnancy loss is heat stress. In ruminants, interferon tau (IFNT) is the embryo signal to the mother. Once the interferon signaling pathway is activated, it drives gene expression for interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and alters neutrophils responses. The aim of the present study was to evaluate interferon (IFN) pathway, ISGs and gene expression in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and oxidative stress in dairy cows under heat stress. Pregnant cows had their estrous cycle synchronized and randomly assigned to a comfort or heat stress group. Blood samples were collected at artificial insemination (AI) and on Days 10, 14 and 18 following AI. Pregnant cows were pregnancy checked by ultrasound on Day 30 and confirmed on Day 60 post-AI. Results are presented as mean ± SEM. The corpus luteum (CL) diameter was not different between groups of pregnant cows; concentration of progesterone of pregnant cows on Day 18 following AI was greater in comfort group compared to heat stressed group. Comfort pregnant cows had higher expression of all analyzed genes from interferon pathway, except for IFNAR1 , on both Days 14 and 18. Conversely, heat stressed cows did not show altered expression of IFNT pathway genes and ISGs between Days 10, 14, and 18 after AI. The oxidative stress, determined as malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, was greater in heat stress group on Days 10, 14 and 18, independent of pregnancy status. Heat stress negatively influences expression of ISGs, IFN pathway gene expression in neutrophils, and oxidative stress. Our data suggest that lower conception rates in cows under heat stress are multifactorial, with the association of interferon pathway activation and the unbalanced oxidative stress being main contributing factors."
https://openalex.org/W3199526989,"The current studies (N = 1,709) explore why demographic composition of place matters. First, this work demonstrates that relative level of group representation affects one's experience of place in the form of self-definition (self-categorization), perceptions of place being representative or characteristic of factors that distinguish the group from others (place-prototypicality), and sense of belonging (place-identification; Studies 1a-1e; Studies 2a & 2b). Second, the studies illustrate that group representation within place shapes the way group member's approach (i.e., expectations of group-based treatment and procedural justice; Studies 2a-2c), understand (i.e., attribution for group-based events, Study 2b; responsiveness to bias-reduction intervention, Study 4a; sense of solidarity, Study 4b), and behave (i.e., prejudice, Studies 3a & 3b; collective action, Study 4c). More broadly, I present a Social identity Paradigm for Contextualized Experience (SPACE) that provides an organizing framework for the study of the impact of characteristics of place on social identity-based contextualized experience and (in turn) collective behavior. Taken together, the findings provide evidence of distinct psychological experience and orientation as a function of minority versus majority-group status within place, as well as for a group-based approach to place. Implications for the study of collective and intergroup behavior are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3200310521,"Tournament theory posits that some organizations are modeled after sports tournaments whereby individuals are incentivized to compete and win against other members of the organization. A persistent criticism of tournament theory is that rank-order success of employees is entirely dependent on non-interacting or at least non-cooperating entities. To address what part, if any, cooperation plays in competitive tournaments, this study examines the role of social networks in tournament-style promotion and reward systems. Specifically, we seek to identify the importance of social relationships, such as group dissimilarity, initial tie formation, and tie strength in predicting tournament success. Bringing two largely independent research streams together (one focused on cooperation and one framed around competition), we examine how individuals' performance interacts with their social relationships-their social networks-to influence their chances of winning a tournament. Using the Survivor television series, we analyze the behaviors of 535 interacting contestants across 30 tournaments. In general, the findings help to illustrate how performance and social networks predict tournament advancement. Interestingly, we find that group dissimilarity based on gender, race, and age, largely does not play a role in advancement in the tournaments. Further, the strength of ties fails to mediate between variables such as group dissimilarity and initial tie formation. We conclude by discussing future directions for theoretical and practical exploration of tournament-style promotion systems. Recommendations include continuing to explore and test the role of social dynamics in compensation and promotion systems."
https://openalex.org/W3200368217,"Weatherization of residential homes is a widespread procedure to retrofit older homes to improve the energy efficiency by reducing building leakage. Several studies have evaluated the effect of weatherization on indoor pollutants, such as formaldehyde, radon, and indoor particulates, but few studies have evaluated the effect of weatherization on indoor microbial exposure. Here, we monitored indoor pollutants and bacterial communities during reductions in building leakage for weatherized single-family residential homes in New York State and compared the data to non-weatherized homes. Nine weatherized and eleven non-weatherized single-family homes in Tompkins County, New York were sampled twice: before and after the weatherization procedures for case homes, and at least 3 months apart for control homes that were not weatherized. We found that weatherization efforts led to a significant increase in radon levels, a shift in indoor microbial community, and a warmer and less humid indoor environment. In addition, we found that changes in indoor airborne bacterial load after weatherization were more sensitive to shifts in season, whereas indoor radon levels were more sensitive to ventilation rates."
https://openalex.org/W3200542673,"In daily life, some people are always seen dedicating available resources to support collective activities. In this paper, we call these people who care group goals more than individual goals dedicators. Inspired by this phenomenon, we studied the role of dedicators on the evolution of cooperation in public goods game (PGG) based on a Chinese Folk Spring Festival Gala. Three types of agents were introduced into our PGG model including cooperators, defectors and dedicators. Dedicators tried to donate when the Gala was short of funds. Cooperators and defectors imitated the strategy of the highest-payoff neighbor based on the rational mechanism. And their imitating probability was modified on account of the emotional mechanism for positive effect of the dedicator's donating behavior and negative effect of continuous poor performance. Through numerical simulations, we found that the existence of dedicators can indeed promote cooperation in PGG. It should be noted that dedicators' willingness to donate was more important than their donation quantity in facilitating cooperation. And the stronger the emotional effect intensity of dedicators' donating behavior was, the better. So, the selfless dedication of participants should be praised to promote cooperation by improving their emotional effect intensity. Last but not least, a reasonable activity budget was needed to sustain the highest level of cooperation."
https://openalex.org/W3200696912,"Habitat loss from land-use change is one of the top causes of declines in wildlife species of concern. As such, it is critical to assess and reassess habitat suitability as land cover and anthropogenic features change for both monitoring and developing current information to inform management decisions. However, there are obstacles that must be overcome to develop consistent assessments through time. A range-wide lek habitat suitability model for the lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus), currently under review by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service for potential listing under the Endangered Species Act, was published in 2016. This model was based on lek data from 2002 to 2012, land cover data ranging from 2001 to 2013, and anthropogenic features from circa 2011, and has been used to help guide lesser prairie-chicken management and anthropogenic development actions. We created a second iteration model based on new lek surveys (2015 to 2019) and updated predictors (2016 land cover and cleaned/updated anthropogenic data) to evaluate changes in lek suitability and to quantify current range-wide habitat suitability. Only three of 11 predictor variables were directly comparable between the iterations, making it difficult to directly assess what predicted changes resulted from changes in model inputs versus actual landscape change. The second iteration model showed a similar positive relationship with land cover and negative relationship with anthropogenic features to the first iteration, but exhibited more variation among candidate models. Range-wide, more suitable habitat was predicted in the second iteration. The Shinnery Oak Ecoregion, however, exhibited a loss in predicted suitable habitat that could be due to predictor source changes. Iterated models such as this are important to ensure current information is being used in conservation and development decisions."
https://openalex.org/W3200719478,"As a conserved posttranslational modification, SUMOylation has been shown to play important roles in chromatin-related biological processes including transcription. However, how the SUMOylation machinery associates with chromatin is not clear. Here, we present evidence that multiple SUMOylation machinery components, including SUMO E1 proteins SAE1 and SAE2 and the PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) family SUMO E3 ligases, are primarily associated with the nuclear matrix rather than with chromatin. We show using nuclease digestion that all PIAS family proteins maintain nuclear matrix association in the absence of chromatin. Of importance, we identify multiple histones including H3 and H2A.Z as directly interacting with PIAS1 and demonstrate that this interaction requires the PIAS1 SAP (SAF-A/B, Acinus, and PIAS) domain. We demonstrate that PIAS1 promotes SUMOylation of histones H3 and H2B in both a SAP domain- and an E3 ligase activity-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that PIAS1 binds to heat shock-induced genes and represses their expression and that this function also requires the SAP domain. Altogether, our study reveals for the first time the nuclear matrix as the compartment most enriched in SUMO E1 and PIAS family E3 ligases. Our finding that PIAS1 interacts directly with histone proteins also suggests a molecular mechanism as to how nuclear matrix-associated PIAS1 is able to regulate transcription and other chromatin-related processes."
https://openalex.org/W3200996066,"Despite the exalted status of sputum mycobacterial load for gauging pulmonary tuberculosis treatment and progress, Chest X-rays supplement valuable information for taking instantaneous therapeutic decisions, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though literature on individual parameters is overwhelming, few studies have explored the interaction between radiographic parameters denoting severity with mycobacterial burden signifying infectivity. By using a sophisticated approach of integrating Chest X-ray parameters with sputum mycobacterial characteristics, evaluated at all the three crucial time points of TB treatment namely pre-treatment, end of intensive phase and completion of treatment, utilizing the interactive Cox Proportional Hazards model, we aimed to precisely deduce predictors of unfavorable response to TB treatment.We extracted de-identified data from well characterized clinical trial cohorts that recruited rifampicin-sensitive Pulmonary TB patients without any comorbidities, taking their first spell of anti-tuberculosis therapy under supervision and meticulous follow up for 24 months post treatment completion, to accurately predict TB outcomes. Radiographic data independently obtained, interpreted by two experienced pulmonologists was collated with demographic details and, sputum smear and culture grades of participants by an independent statistician and analyzed using the Cox Proportional Hazards model, to not only adjust for confounding factors including treatment effect, but also explore the interaction between radiological and bacteriological parameters for better therapeutic application.Of 667 TB patients with data available, cavitation, extent of involvement, lower zone involvement, smear and culture grade at baseline were significant parameters predisposing to an unfavorable TB treatment outcome in the univariate analysis. Reduction in radiological lesions in Chest X-ray by at least 50% at 2 months and 75% at the end of treatment helped in averting unfavorable responses. Smear and Culture conversion at the end of 2 months was highly significant as a predictor (p<0.001). In the multivariate analysis, the adjusted hazards ratios (HR) for an unfavorable response to TB therapy for extent of involvement, baseline cavitation and persistence (post treatment) were 1.21 (95% CI: 1.01-1.44), 1.73 (95% CI: 1.05-2.84) and 2.68 (95% CI: 1.4-5.12) respectively. A 3+ smear had an HR of 1.94 (95% CI: 0.81-4.64). Further probing into the interaction, among patients with 3+ and 2+ smears, HRs for cavitation were 3.26 (95% CI: 1.33-8.00) and 1.92 (95% CI: 0.80-4.60) while for >2 zones, were 3.05 (95% CI: 1.12-8.23) and 1.92 (95% CI: 0.72-5.08) respectively. Patients without cavitation, zonal involvement <2, and a smear grade less than 2+ had a better prognosis and constituted minimal disease.Baseline Cavitation, Opacities occupying >2 zones and 3+ smear grade individually and independently forecasted a poorer TB outcome. The interaction model revealed that Zonal involvement confined to 2 zones, without a cavity and smear grade up to 2+, constituting ""minimal disease"", had a better prognosis. Radiological clearance >50% along with smear conversion at the end of intensive phase of treatment, observed to be a reasonable alternative to culture conversion in predicting a successful outcome. These parameters may potentially take up key positions as stratification factors for future trials contemplating on shorter TB regimens."

Methods and results We used this retrospective chart analysis employing an unmatched case-control design to study critically ill diarrheal adults aged ≥18 years treated in ICU of Dhaka hospital, icddr,b between January 2011 to December 2015. Of 8,863 in-patient diarrheal adults, 350 having severe sepsis were cases and an equal number of randomly selected non-septic patients were the controls. Cases died significantly more (14.9% vs 4.6%, p = &lt;0.001) than controls. 69% of the cases progressed to septic shock. In logistic regression analysis, steroid intake, ileus, acute kidney injury (AKI), metabolic acidosis, and hypocalcemia were significantly associated with severe sepsis in diarrheal adults (all, p&lt;0.05). 12% of cases (40/335) had bacteremia. Streptococcus pneumoniae [9 (22.5%)] was the single most common pathogen and gram-negatives [27 (67.5%)] were prevailing as a group. Conclusion Diarrheal adults who had ileus, AKI, metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia, and also took steroids were found to have an association with severe sepsis. Strikingly, gram-negative were the predominant bacteria among the diarrheal adults having severe sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W3199912285,"In rice paddy, the closed chamber method is broadly used to estimate methane (CH4) emission rate. Since rice plants can significantly affect CH4 production, oxidation and emission, rice plantation inside the chamber is standardized in IPCC guidelines. Methane emission rate is calculated using the increased concentration inside the headspace. Biomass growth might decrease the headspace volume, and thus CH4 emission rates might be overestimated. To evaluate the influence of chamber headspace decreased by rice plant development on CH4 emission rates, five Korean rice cultivars were cultivated in a typical rice paddy, and physical volume changes in rice biomass were assayed using water displacement method. The recommended acrylic closed chambers (H. 1.2 m x W. 0.6 m x L. 0.6 m) were installed, and eight rice plants were transplanted inside the chamber with the same space interval with the outside. Biomass growth significantly decreased the headspace volume of the chamber. However, this volume covered only 0.48-0.55% of the closed chamber volume at the maximum growth stage. During the whole cropping period, mean 0.24-0.28% of chamber headspace was allocated by plant biomass, and thus this level of total CH4 emissions was overestimated. However, this overestimation was much smaller than the errors coming from other investigation processes (i.e., chamber closing hour, temperature recording, inconstant flooding level, different soil environments, etc.) and rice physiological changes. In conclusion, the influence of physical biomass volume inside the closed chamber was negligible to make the error in total CH4 emission assessment in rice paddies."
https://openalex.org/W3200227044,"This study aimed to uncover the effect of voided urinary volume on small intestine permeability ratios in healthy children.We assessed small intestine permeability in 155 apparently healthy children, aged 3-5 years old, without any visible symptoms of disease, in a rural, malaria-endemic setting in Nigeria, using a multi-sugar test solution, comprising lactulose, sucrose, mannitol, and rhamnose. Children were categorized into low urinary volume (LV) and high urinary volume (HV), based on the volume of urine voided per kg body weight per hour. LV children voided less than 25th percentile of the total population, while HV children voided greater than 75th percentile of the total population. Urinary volume excreted over a 90-minute period after administration of the test solution was measured, and differences in sugar ratios were compared between children with high (HV) and low urinary volumes (LV), as well as between children who voided (VC) or who were not able to void (NVC) before administration of the test solution.Urinary mannitol and rhamnose recovery were 44% (p = 0.002) and 77% (p<0.001) higher in HV children compared to LV children respectively, while urinary lactulose recovery was 34% lower (p = 0.071). There was no difference in urinary sucrose recovery between groups (p = 0.74). Lactulose-mannitol ratio, lactulose-rhamnose ratio and sucrose-rhamnose ratio were all significantly higher in children in the LV group compared to children in the HV group (p<0.001). In a multiple regression analysis, urinary volume and voiding status combined, explained 13%, 23% and 7% of the variation observed in lactulose-mannitol, lactulose-rhamnose and sucrose-rhamnose ratios, respectively.Sugar permeability ratios vary significantly with total urinary volume in multi-sugar small-intestine permeability tests. Voiding status before sugar administration appears to influence lactulose recovery, lactulose-rhamnose and sucrose-rhamnose ratios independently of total urinary volume. Evidence from this study suggests the need to take urinary volume into account when conducting multi-sugar small-intestine permeability tests."
https://openalex.org/W3200268632,"In Sri Lanka dietary patterns are shifting towards increased consumption of industrially processed foods (IPF). This study aimed to estimate the contribution of IPF to salt and iodine intake and assess the possible impact of salt reduction on iodized salt intake. The assessment was conducted using guidance published by the Iodine Global Network. National nutrition and household income expenditure surveys were used to estimate adult per capita consumption of household salt and commonly consumed salt-containing IPF. Industry and laboratory data were used to quantify salt content of IPF. Modelling estimated the potential and current iodine intake from consumption of household salt and using iodized salt in the identified IPF. Estimates were adjusted to investigate the likely impact on iodine intake of achieving 30% salt reduction. IPF included were bread, dried fish and biscuits, with daily per capita consumption of 32g, 10g and 7g respectively. Daily intake of household salt was estimated to be 8.5g. Potential average national daily iodine intake if all salt in these products was iodized was 166μg. Estimated current daily iodine intake, based on iodization of 78% of household salt and dried fish being made with non-iodized salt, was 111μg nationally, ranging from 90 to 145μg provincially. Estimated potential and current iodine intakes were above the estimated average requirement of 95μg iodine for adults, however, current intake was below the recommended nutrient intake of 150μg. If the 30% salt reduction target is achieved, estimated current iodine intake from household salt, bread and biscuits could decrease to 78μg. The assessment together with data for iodine status suggest that current iodine intake of adults in Sri Lanka is adequate. Recommendations to sustain with reduced salt intake are to strengthen monitoring of population iodine status and of food industry use of iodized salt, and to adjust the salt iodine levels if needed."
https://openalex.org/W3201406102,"The reinforced concrete-filled steel tube (RCFST) column solves several of the problems of the concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) column in practical engineering applications. Moreover, RCFST has a simple joint structure, high bearing capacity, good ductility, and superior fire resistance. From a structural safety perspective, designers prioritize the creep performance of CFST members in structural design. Therefore, the creep behavior of RCFST columns should be thoroughly investigated in practical engineering design. To study the influence of the creep behavior of RCFST columns under axial compression, this work analyzed the mechanical behavior of composite columns based on their mechanical characteristics under axial compression and established a creep formula suitable for RCFST columns under axial compression. A creep analysis program was also developed to obtain the creep strain-time curve, and its correctness was verified by existing tests. On this basis, the effects of the main design parameters, such as the stress level, steel ratio, and reinforcement ratio, on the creep behavior were determined and analyzed. The creep of the tested composite columns increased rapidly in the early stages (28 days) of load action; the growth rate was relatively low after 28 days and tended to stabilize after approximately six months. The stress level had the greatest influence on the creep of RCFST columns under axial compression, followed by the steel ratio. The influence of the reinforcement ratio on the creep behavior was less. The results of this study can provide a reference for engineering practice."
https://openalex.org/W3201495398,"Systematic survey is a crucial component of the archaeological field endeavor. In low visibility areas, systematic subsurface testing is required, most often in the form of shovel test pits or ""STPs"". Decisions about the interval between STPs, and the size of such units, impact significantly both the effectiveness of survey for site location and the efficiency of such prospection efforts, and yet ""cookie-cutter"" survey strategies are often employed without a thorough examination of their costs and benefits. In this work, we present a simulation-based method (DIGSS, Determination of Intervals using Georeferenced Survey Simulation) by which archaeologists can simulate the effectiveness and efficiency of different survey strategies for both prospective and retrospective applications. Beyond permitting the design and implementation of survey strategies that both maximize the possibility of site detection in a given region and that husband precious resources (money and time), this method permits the generation of post hoc correction factors that make direct comparison of previous surveys possible. While DIGSS was designed with archaeological applications (artifacts and sites) in mind, it has potential ramifications in other fields of study where discrete spatial sampling is used as a means of determining the presence, absence, or abundance of discontinuous assemblages materials of interest in a survey region. As such, we can envision potential application in the fields of geology, ecology, and environmental/pollution monitoring."

Prescription of antidepressants, antipsychotics, analgesics including opioids, benzodiazepines and z-hypnotics in persistent AChEI users was studied in a follow-up period from four years before to two years after AChEI initiation in men and women of four age groups: 37-64, 65-72, 73-80 and 81-88 years.Use of antidepressants, antipsychotics and weaker analgesics increased in both sexes during the follow-up period in 11.764 persistent AChEI users. Women with pre-dementia and dementia stages of AD showed a prescription pattern with more use of psychotropics and opioids than men, except for antipsychotics.Female sex showed to have a significant influence on the prescriptions of psychotropics and analgesics in AD patients in a pre-dementia and dementia stage. The exception is for antipsychotics, that men used more than women. The prescription pattern showed a higher extent of polypharmacy of psychotropics and/or opioids in women than in men. The total prescription pattern of analgesics could indicate an undertreatment of pain in pre-dementia and dementia stages, most pronounced in men."
