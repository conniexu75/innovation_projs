https://openalex.org/W2081333145,Analysis of Nile flood stages from A.D. 640 to 1921 reveals major episodes of low Nile discharge during the years 930 to 1070 and 1180 to 1350 and major episodes of high Nile floods during 1070 to 1180 and 1350 to 1470. Examination of Nile flood maxima and minima and comparison with water levels in Lake Chad reveal a correlation between high Nile discharge and greater rainfall in equatorial East Africa. There is also apparently a correlation between low Nile discharge and cold climate in Europe.

Initially a ring core has the characteristics of the Slope Water; it is rich in plants, animals, and nutrients. As a ring decays the Slope Water properties of its core are gradually replaced by those of the Sargasso Sea, where standing crops of plants, animals, and nutrients generally are low. Although the decay rate suggests a rather long lifetime (2 to 4 years), the usual death of a ring comes when it rejoins the Gulf Stream after 6 to 12 months."

An estimated 22 percent of the residues might be utilized, providing a renewable source of high-grade energy with the potential of supplying 1 percent of the current U.S. gasoline consumption as ethanol or 4 percent of the total electrical energy used. These net energy benefits are limited by high energy costs to collect, transport, and process the residues. Environmental threats include soil erosion, water runoff, and nutrient loss."
https://openalex.org/W2076459143,"Partition coefficients can be determined with accuracy by a ""tracerpulse"" method in which the retention volume of a tracer of the respective species is measured. The method is applicable to multicomponent equilibria and can be used at elevated temperature and pressure. A less accurate ""differential"" method not requiring a tracer is also described."
https://openalex.org/W2069481520,Metallic InTe(II) has a NaCl structure with ao = 6.154 A and becomes superconducting below 3.5 degrees K. These results are substantially different from those previously reported. The pressure-temperature diagram to 850 degrees C and 50 kb is presented.
https://openalex.org/W1983417683,Bondy and Harrington have proposed that selective binding of L isomers of amino acids and D isomers of sugars to bentonite is the mechanism by which the chirality of molecules in living cells was originally established. Further experiments indicate that the observations of Bondy and Harrington are better explained in terms of the effects of the binding to bentonite of the products of radiochemical decomposition.

https://openalex.org/W2094258433,"Defense strategists today assume that a single Soviet warhead detonated 200 miles above Nebraska would knock out unprotected communications equipment all across the United States. The reason is electromagnetic pulse (EMP), a by-product of high-altitude nuclear explosions that blankets huge tracts of the earth with peak fields of 50,000 volts per meter. The first installment of this three-part series described how EMP was discovered and why its potentially chaos-producing effects were overlooked for more than a decade. The second part examines the ongoing debate in the Pentagon over how to cope with the EMP threat. The third part will discuss questions EMP raises about waging a limited nuclear war."
https://openalex.org/W2001683973,A repetitive pattern of a triangular luminance profile may be perceived as a triangular-wave grating or as a square-wave grating. This illusion may reflect the operation of cortical phase-selective mechanisms that are biased toward particular phase relations and favor abrupt luminance gradients.
