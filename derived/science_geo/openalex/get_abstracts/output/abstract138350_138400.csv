https://openalex.org/W2042429611,"Oxysterols regulate the expression of genes involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism and serve as intermediates in cholesterol catabolism. Among the most potent of regulatory oxysterols is 25-hydroxycholesterol, whose biosynthetic enzyme has not yet been isolated. Here, we report the cloning of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase cDNAs from the mouse and human. The encoded enzymes are polytopic membrane proteins of 298 and 272 amino acids, respectively, which contain clusters of histidine residues that are essential for catalytic activity. Unlike most other sterol hydroxylases, cholesterol 25-hydroxylase is not a cytochrome P450, but rather it is a member of a small family of enzymes that utilize diiron cofactors to catalyze the hydroxylation of hydrophobic substrates. The cholesterol 25-hydroxylase gene lacks introns, and in the human it is located on chromosome 10q23. The murine gene is expressed at low levels in multiple tissues. Expression of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase in transfected cells reduces the biosynthesis of cholesterol from acetate and suppresses the cleavage of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 and -2. The data suggest that cholesterol 25-hydroxylase has the capacity to play an important role in regulating lipid metabolism by synthesizing a co-repressor that blocks sterol regulatory element binding protein processing and ultimately leads to inhibition of gene transcription.

Oxysterols are formed by the hydroxylation of the side chain of cholesterol. 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: cholesterol, 5-cholesten-3β-ol; SREBP, sterol regulatory element binding protein; CHOP, Chinese hamster ovary polyoma; 25-hydroxycholesterol, cholest-5-ene-3β,25-diol; 24-hydroxycholesterol, cholest-5-ene-3β,24-diol; 27-hydroxycholesterol, cholest-5-ene-3β,27-diol; cholestanol, 5α-cholestan-3β-ol; epicholesterol, 5-cholesten-3α-ol; coprostanol, 5β-cholestan-3β-ol; desmosterol, 5,24-cholestadien-3β-ol; sitosterol, 5-cholesten-24β-ethyl-3β-ol; 25-oxo-27-noncholesterol, 27-nor-25-oxo-5-cholesten-3β-ol; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; bp, base pair; kb, kilobase pair; FISH, fluorescent in situ hybridization; EST, expressed sequence tag; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. This modification renders the sterol more hydrophilic and confers two important biological properties. First, the increased hydrophilicity enhances the ability of the oxysterol to cross membranes and thereby facilitates its movement between intracellular compartments, cells, and tissues. Second, oxysterols delivered in ethanol to cultured cells are potent regulators of the expression of genes involved in sterol and fatty acid metabolism (1Kandutsch A.A. Chen H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6057-6061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7306-7314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enhanced solubility of oxysterols is exploited by the body to maintain cholesterol homeostasis. In several tissues and cell types, including the brain, kidney, endothelium, and macrophages, cholesterol is converted into oxysterols that subsequently traverse the plasma membrane and are transported to the liver (3Björkhem I.

In the liver, they are converted into bile acids by a newly described biosynthetic pathway (6Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Russell D.W. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 1-6Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These bile acids are essential for normal lipid and fat-soluble vitamin metabolism (7Ishibashi S. Schwarz M. Frykman P.K. Herz J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18017-18023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Oxysterols are both positive and negative regulators of gene expression. As positive effectors, they bind to and activate the nuclear receptor LXR (8Janowski B.A. Willy P.J. Devi T.R. Falck J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar), which in turn increases transcription of the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase gene (9Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.T. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Oliver B.B. Su J.-L. Sundseth S.S. Winegar D.A. Blanchard D.E. Spencer T.A. Willson T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3137-3140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). This activation stimulates the conversion of cholesterol into bile acids (10Russell D.W. Setchell K.D.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4737-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Mutation of theLXR gene in mice causes a loss of 7α-hydroxylase gene induction and a build up of cholesterol in the liver (11Peet D.J. Turley S.D. Ma W. Janowski B.A. Lobaccaro J.-M.A. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). As negative regulators, oxysterols suppress the cleavage of two transcription factors known as sterol regulatory element binding proteins-1 and -2 (SREBP-1 and -2) (12Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3002) Google Scholar). These proteins are synthesized as inactive precursors in the membrane compartment of the cell. When intracellular cholesterol levels decline, SREBPs are cleaved to release amino-terminal fragments that migrate to the nucleus and activate the transcription of a network of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and supply (12Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3002) Google Scholar). This activation in turn restores intracellular cholesterol levels. Several oxysterols occur naturally, including 25-hydroxycholesterol (cholest-5-ene-3β,25-diol), 24-hydroxycholesterol (cholest-5-ene-3β,24-diol), and 27-hydroxycholesterol (cholest-5-ene-3β,27-diol) (13Dzeletovic S. Breuer O. Lund E. Diczfalusy U. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Of these three oxysterols, 25-hydroxycholesterol is the most potent regulator of gene transcription when assayed in vitro (1Kandutsch A.A. Chen H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6057-6061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7306-7314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lehmann J.M.

Cell. 1998; 93: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). Despite this potency, it has proven difficult to document the biosynthesis of this oxysterol and thus its role as an in vivo regulator of lipid metabolism has remained questionable. The objectives of the current study were to obtain in vivoevidence for 25-hydroxylation of cholesterol and to identify the gene responsible for this putative activity. We here report the isolation of cDNAs encoding murine and human cholesterol 25-hydroxylases, and we demonstrate that expression of these cDNAs in cultured cells down-regulates cholesterol synthesis and SREBP processing. Total RNA was prepared from 400 mg of an SREBP-1a transgenic mouse liver (14Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) using RNA-Stat 60 (Tel-Test, Inc. Friendswood, TX). Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from total RNA by two cycles of chromatography on oligo(dT) (mRNA Purification Kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A size-fractionated, directional cDNA library with SalI and NotI cohesive ends at the 5′ and 3′ termini, respectively, was constructed from 4 μg of poly(A)+ RNA using a Superscript Plasmid Kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Size-fractionated cDNA (>1.0 kb, 10 ng) was ligated with 50 ng of pCMV6 expression vector (a derivative of pCMV4 (15Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlbäck H. Jörnvall H. Russell D.W. J Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing a NotI site in the polylinker) using a protocol and reagents supplied with the Superscript kit. Prior to ligation, the pCMV6 vector (1.2 μg) was digested for 2 h with 10 units of NotI and SalI, respectively, in 30 μl of 1× SalI restriction buffer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The digested plasmid was purified by phenol/chloroform (1:1, v/v) extraction, electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel, and recovered from the gel using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Germany). Plasmid DNA was purified from the ligation reaction by precipitation with ammonium acetate/ethanol and resuspended in 4 μl of water, of which 1 μl was used to transform 40 μl of ElectromaxEscherichia coli DH10B cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). The transformed bacteria were diluted into 1000 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin. Aliquots of cells were plated on LB ampicillin plates for calculation of the total number of recombinants. The remainder was divided into 400 pools of 2.5 ml each that were grown to saturation overnight at 37 °C. The total number of independent recombinants in the cDNA library was 1.5 × 106, and each pool contained an average of 3800 recombinants. DNA was prepared from individual pools using a Wizard Miniprep Kit (Promega Inc, Madison, WI). The yield of plasmid DNA from each pool was approximately 25 μg. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (ATCC CRL 1573) were plated on day 0 at a density of 7 × 105 cells/60-mm dish in Medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate). On day 1, individual dishes were transfected with a mixture of plasmid DNAs that included pool DNA (5 μg), pCMV-StAR (2 μg), phct1 (2 μg), and pVA-1 (1 μg). The expression plasmid pCMV-StAR contains a full-length cDNA encoding the murine steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR, Ref. 16Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 221-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar) and was a kind gift of Dr. Douglas Stocco, Texas Tech University Medical School, Lubbock, TX. The expression plasmid phct1 contains a full-length cDNA encoding the murine oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase enzyme (17Stapleton G. Steel M. Richardson M. Mason J.O. Rose K.A. Morris R.G.M. Lathe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29739-29745Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 18Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Lathe R. Björkhem I. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23995-24001Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The original hct1 cDNA was a kind gift of Dr. Richard Lathe, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland. The plasmid pVA1 contains the adenovirus type 5VAI gene (19Schneider R.J. Shenk T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 317-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A positive control, in which cells were transfected with 1 ng of a murine sterol 27-hydroxylase expression plasmid diluted into 5 μg of pCMV6 vector alone, was included in every experiment. Aliquots (40 μl) of the transfection lipid pfx-8 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) dissolved in DMEM containing 15 mm HEPES were added to each plasmid mixture. Cells were incubated with the resulting lipid/DNA mixture in 5 ml of DMEM for 4 h at 37 °C, in an atmosphere of 8.8% CO2. Assay of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase activity was thereafter carried out as described below. To subdivide the positive pool containing a cholesterol 25-hydroxylase cDNA, an aliquot (40 μl) of Electromax DH10B cells was transformed with 0.5 ng of DNA from the positive primary pool. A portion (0.5%) of the transformation mixture was diluted into 50 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin and divided into 20 pools, each containing ∼490 recombinants for secondary screening. DNA was prepared from individual pools, and 293 cells were transfected as above, except that 6-well plates were used in place of 60-mm dishes, and amounts of reagents were scaled down accordingly. Tertiary screening was similarly performed except subpools of 50 recombinants were transfected. Quaternary screening was carried out with pools of 10 cDNA isolates derived from a matrix array of individual cDNAs to identify a single cholesterol 25-hydroxylase cDNA. The transfection medium containing the cationic lipid was aspirated and replaced with 3 ml of Medium B (DMEM containing 10% newborn calf lipoprotein-poor serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) supplemented with 5 μl of [4-14C]cholesterol (56.6 mCi/mmol; 0.040 μCi/μl; NEN Life Science Products). Cells were incubated for a further 60 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 8.8% CO2. Media from the transfected cells were collected and extracted with 8 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The organic phase from each sample was taken to dryness under a stream of nitrogen, and residues were dissolved in 40-μl aliquots of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and applied to 20 × 20 cm prescored LK5DF silica gel TLC plates (Whatman, Hillsboro, OR) with preadsorbent layers. The plates were developed in ethyl acetate/toluene (4:6, v/v) and exposed to a Fuji BAS-MP phosphorimager plate overnight. Phosphorimage analysis was then performed on a Fuji BAS1000 apparatus. A 372-base pair expressed sequence tag (EST, GenBankTMaccession number W01328) with high sequence identity to a portion of the murine 25-hydroxylase cDNA was identified by BLAST search. A bacterial stab transformed with a plasmid containing the EST sequence cloned into the pT3T7 vector was obtained from Research Genetics, Inc., Huntsville, AL. Plasmid DNA was prepared, and a 245-base pair fragment was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers of the following sequence: 5′-CTGGGACCACCTGAGGAGCT-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GCCCAATGCAGCAGCGTCAC-3′ (reverse primer). The thermocycler program consisted of 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The amplified cDNA fragment was cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The insert was excised from the plasmid with EcoRI and used for the preparation of a radiolabeled probe by random octamer priming (Megaprime Labeling Kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The probe was used to screen 200,000 plaques of a human lung cDNA library in bacteriophage λgt10 (catalog number HL3004a,CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using standard hybridization procedures (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). One positive clone was isolated whose cDNA insert was subcloned into the EcoRI sites of pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene Corp., La Jolla, CA) and pCMV6, yielding plasmids pBS-h25 and pCMV-h25, respectively. Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase gene sequences were isolated from a murine genomic library prepared from 129SvEv DNA (a kind gift of Dr. Alan Bradley, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) and a human genomic library (catalog number 946204, Stratagene), both in bacteriophage λ FIX II, by screening with full-length cDNA probes corresponding to the murine and human cholesterol 25-hydroxylase cDNAs, respectively, using standard protocols (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Approximately 600,000 murine and 400,000 human recombinants were screened, and one positive clone from each library was identified and purified to homogeneity. The corresponding genomic DNA inserts were excised from the bacteriophage vectors and ligated into the NotI site of pBluescript SK+, yielding plasmids pBS-mg25 and pBS-hg25, respectively. The chromosomal location of the human cholesterol 25-hydroxylase gene was determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and by polymerase chain reaction amplification of somatic cell and radiation hybrid panel DNAs. FISH mapping was performed by See DNA Biotech, Inc. (Downsview, Ontario, Canada). The bacteriophage λ clone harboring the human 25-hydroxylase gene described above was labeled with biotinylated dATP for use as a FISH probe. Of 100 mitotic figures analyzed, 91 showed hybridization signals on paired sister chromatids corresponding to chromosome 10. Comparison of the signal positions with bands generated by staining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole indicated that hybridization occurred at band q23. Radiation and somatic cell hybrid mapping were performed using DNAs in the Somatic Cell Hybrid Mapping Panel 2 (Coriell Institute of Medical Research, Camden, NJ) and the Stanford G-3 radiation hybrid panel (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). The primer pair used for amplification was 5′-CTGGGACCACCTGAGGAGCT-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GCCCAATGCAGCAGCGTCAC-3′ (reverse primer), which, respectively, correspond to nucleotides 79–98 and 333–314 of the human gene sequence (Fig. 6 A). The thermocycler program consisted of 35 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s and 68 °C for 30 s on a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp 9600 machine. Only somatic cell hybrid DNAs containing human chromosome 10 produced a positive amplification signal. Analysis of the radiation hybrid data through the Stanford Genome Center server 2The Stanford Genome Center server is available on-line at the following address:[email protected] indicated linkage of the cholesterol 25-hydroxylase gene to the SHGC-15188 marker (LOD score = 4.4, cR_1000 = 45.76) on chromosome 10 in the vicinity of band q23. DNA sequencing was performed on an ABI Prism 377 sequencer using thermocycler sequencing protocols and fluorescent dye terminators. Contiguous DNA sequences were assembled using MacVector software (IBI-Kodak Corp., New Haven, CT), and sequence alignments were generated using a Lasergene software package (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI). For RNA blotting, a murine multiple tissue RNA blot (CLONTECH, catalog number 7762-1) was hybridized overnight in 50% formamide hybridization buffer at 42 °C with a full-length murine 25-hydroxylase cDNA probe using standard procedures (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The probe was radioactively labeled by random nonamer priming with [32P]CTP. The blot was washed stringently at 65 °C, in 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS before exposure for 5 days to Kodak X-OMAT AR film at −80 °C using an intensifying screen. An antipeptide antibody against the sequence RRYKIHPDFSPSVKQ, representing amino acids 69–83 of the murine cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (Fig. 3 A), was raised in rabbits. This sequence was synthesized as a multiple antigen peptide by Bio-Synthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX). For the initial immunization, 100 μg of peptide was administered intramuscularly as a dispersion in Freund's complete adjuvant to two New Zealand White male rabbits, 3 months of age. Boosts of 100 μg of antigen in Freund's incomplete adjuvant were given on average every 5 weeks, and bleeds were drawn 7 days after each boost. One of the two resulting antisera, U104, was used here after affinity purification on peptide antigen columns (21Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). To construct an epitope-tagged version of the murine cholesterol 25-hydroxylase enzyme, a cDNA fragment spanning the coding region and having BspDI andXbaI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-AAAATCGATGGCTGCTACAACGGTTCGGA-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-AAATCTAGATCAAGTCTGTTTCTTCTTCTGGATCA-3′ (reverse primer). The template was the plasmid pCMV-m25, and the thermocycler program consisted of 35 cycles of 94 °C at 30 s, 57 °C at 15 s, and 72 °C at 60 s. The amplified cDNA fragment was purified on a Centricon-100 column (Amicon Corp., Beverly, MA), digested with BspDI and XbaI, repurified by chromatography on a Centricon-100 column, and ligated into a modified pcDNA3 vector containing a sequence for a c-Myc epitope in front of the BspDI site. The desired recombinant was termed pcDNA3-NH2-myc-m25. This plasmid encodes a fusion protein in which the sequence MEQKLISEEDLNEQKLISEEDLNID containing two tandem copies of a c-Myc epitope is linked to the amino terminus of the murine cholesterol 25-hydroxylase protein lacking the initial methionine residue. A similar strategy was used to place tandem c-Myc epitopes at the amino terminus of the human cholesterol 25-hydroxylase cDNA, producing the plasmid pcDNA3-NH2-myc-h25. A double c-Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDLNEQKLISEEDLN) was placed at the carboxyl terminus of the murine cholesterol 25-hydroxylase cDNA as follows. An oligonucleotide encoding these epitopes with anRsrII cohesive 5′-end and a blunt 3′-end was formed by annealing the phosphorylated oligonucleotide primers 5′-GTCCGCGGAGCAAAAGCTCATTTCTGAAGAGGACTTGAATGAGCAAAAGCTCATTTCTGAAGAGGACTTGAATTAG-3′ and 5′-CTAATTCAAGTCCTCTTCAGAAATGAGCTTTTGCTCATTCAAGTCCTCTTCAGAAATGAGCTTTTGCTCCGCGG-3′ as described (22Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The annealed duplex was ligated into pCMV-m25 that had been digested with Eco47III and RsrII and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The resulting plasmid, pCMV-m25-COOH-myc, encodes a protein comprising amino acids 1–267 of the murine cholesterol 25-hydroxylase fused to the two c-Myc epitope sequences. Site-directed mutagenesis (23Smith M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1985; 9: 423-462Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar) was carried out using a polymerase chain reaction-based kit (Quik-Change, Stratagene) on the plasmid pCMV-m25. The mutagenic oligonucleotide primers (5′-GGCTCACCACGACATGCAACAATCTCAGTTTAACTGC-3′ and 5′-GCAGTTAAACTGAGATTGTTGCATGTCGTGGTGAGCC-3′) were designed to convert histidine codons at positions 242 and 243 of the murine protein to glutamine codons. Mutagenesis was carried out according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. Plasmid DNA products were subjected to DNA sequence analysis to confirm the presence of the substitution mutations and the absence of spurious mutations. The plasmid containing the desired mutations was named pCMV-m25-HH242QQ. On day 0, a derivative of Chinese hamster ovarian cells expressing the polyoma virus middle T antigen (31No D. Yao T.P. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3346-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar) (CHOP cells) was plated at a density of 750,000 cells/100-mm dish in Medium C (1:1 (v/v) DMEM/Ham's F12 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate). On day 1, the cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of pVA-1 and 13.5 μg of pCMV6, pCMV-m25-HH242QQ, or pCMV-m25 per dish for vector, mutant, and wild type 25-hydroxylase transfections, respectively. 60 μl of pfx-8 lipid was used as a transfection reagent as described above. On day 2, cells were incubated for 1 h with 2% (w/v) 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin dissolved in a 1:1 solution of DMEM/Ham's F12 medium. The cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and then harvested in the same buffer using a rubber policeman. After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, the buffer was aspirated, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors (Boehringer Mannheim Complete Mini, EDTA-free, at the concentration recommended by the supplier). A cell lysate was prepared using a Polytron set at 10,000 rpm, with three bursts of 3 s each with 30-s intervals between bursts. Incubations were performed at 37 °C with 140 μg of cell lysate protein in 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm NADPH. [4-14C]Cholesterol was added in 4 μl of 45% (w/v) 2-hydroxypropylcyclodextrin in water to a final concentration of 5 μm. The total volume of the incubation was adjusted to 200 μl. After 2 h, reactions were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and analyzed by thin layer chromatography. Stock cultures of CHO-7 cells, a subline of CHO-K1 cells selected for growth in lipoprotein-deficient serum (25Metherall J.E. Goldstein J.L. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15634-15641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were maintained in Medium D (1:1 (v/v) DMEM/Ham's F12 medium containing 5% newborn calf lipoprotein-poor serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate). On day 0, cells were plated at a density of 7 × 105 cells/60-mm dish. On day 1, transfections were carried out using 4 μg/dish of the indicated plasmid DNA and LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions and with modifications as described (26Rawson R.B.

After transfection, fresh media supplemented with 50 μm mevalonate, 50 μmcompactin, and 0.2% ethanol containing either no sterol or a mixture of sterols (final concentrations of 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol and 10 μg/ml cholesterol) were added. The cells were returned for 20 h to a 37 °C incubator, harvested, and then fractionated into a nuclear extract and a 105 × g membrane pellet as described (27Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X.

Six-well plates of CHOP cells were transfected with pCMV-m25 or with vector alone as described above and incubated for 48 h in Medium D supplemented with 10 μg/ml cholesterol. Thereafter, media were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v; 5 ml/well), and the organic phase was separated and taken to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. Extracts from 6 wells were combined for subsequent procedures. The samples were purified on Isolute Silica columns (International Sorbent Technology, Mid Glamorgan, UK), and hydroxyl groups were converted to trimethylsilyl ethers as described previously (13Dzeletovic S. Breuer O. Lund E. Diczfalusy U. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed on a Varian 3400 gas chromatograph equipped with an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25-μm phase thickness) connected to a Finnigan SSQ700 mass spectrometer. The gas chromatography temperature program was 180 °C for 1 min, followed by a temperature gradient of 10 °C/min to 300 °C, and a final elution at 300 °C for 15 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at an injector valve pressure of 6 pounds/square inch. Injector and transfer line temperatures were set to 280 °C, and the injector was operated in the splitless mode. The machine was operated in the electron ionization mode with electron energy set to 70 eV, and the quadrupole was scanned between m/z 100 and 500 at a rate of 1 scan/1.5 s. To examine the sensitivity of N-linked carbohydrates on cholesterol 25-hydroxylase to endoglycosidase digestion, COS M6 cells were initially plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish in Medium A on Day 0 of the experiment. On Day 1, one dish each was transfected with 4.5 μg of pCMV-m25, pcDNA3-NH2-myc-m25, pCMV-m25-COOH-myc, pCMV-h25, or pcDNA3-NH2-myc-h25 together with 0.5 μg of pVA1"
https://openalex.org/W1994117795,"The human homologue of the Escherichia coli htrA gene product was identified by the differential display analysis of transcripts expressed in osteoarthritic cartilage. This transcript was identified previously as being repressed in SV40-transformed fibroblasts (Zumbrunn, J., and Trueb, B. (1996)FEBS Lett.398, 187–192). Levels of HtrA mRNA were elevated ∼7-fold in cartilage from individuals with osteoarthritis compared with nonarthritic controls. Differential expression of human HtrA protein was confirmed by an immunoblot analysis of cartilage extracts. Human HtrA protein expressed in heterologous systems was secreted and exhibited endoproteolytic activity, including autocatalytic cleavage. Conversion by mutagenesis of the putative active site serine 328 to alanine eliminated the enzymatic activity. Serine 328 was also found to be required for the formation of a stable complex with α1-antitrypsin. We have determined that the HtrA gene is highly conserved among mammalian species: the amino acid sequences encoded by HtrA cDNA clones from cow, rabbit, and guinea pig are 98% identical to human. In E. coli, a functionalhtrA gene product is required for cell survival after heat shock or oxidative stress; its role appears to be the degradation of denatured proteins. We propose that mammalian HtrA, with the addition of a new functionality during evolution, i.e. a mac25 homology domain, plays an important role in cell growth regulation. The human homologue of the Escherichia coli htrA gene product was identified by the differential display analysis of transcripts expressed in osteoarthritic cartilage.

Osteoarthritis (OA),1the most prevalent form of degenerative joint disease, involves chondrocyte loss and the breakdown of extracellular matrix components, leading to cartilage degeneration and the eventual deterioration of joint function (1Howell D.S. Moskowitz R.W. Howell D.S. Goldberg V.M. Mankin H.J. Osteoarthritis Diagnosis and Management. Sanders, Philadelphia1984: 129-146Google Scholar). From a therapeutic perspective, it is important to understand the molecular events triggering the onset of OA and the biochemical pathways responsible for the disease progression that appear to be influenced by a complexity of environmental and genetic factors (2Felson D.T. Rheum. Dis. Clin. N. Am. 1990; 16: 499-512PubMed Google Scholar, 3McAlindon T. Dieppe P. Br. J. Rheumatol. 1990; 29: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4Oddis C.V. Am. J. Med. 1996; 100: 10s-15sAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chondrocytes, the exclusive cell type in cartilage, maintain the integrity of the collagen/proteoglycan network by responding to a variety of stresses, including the normal mechanical load as well as abnormal trauma and injury (5Muir H. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 1039-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The cellular response to stress stimuli occurs through the regulation of a myriad of signal transduction pathways, leading to alterations in gene expression. Analysis of differential gene expression using various molecular biological techniques has been increasingly applied to investigate complex biological phenomena (6Wan J.S. Sharp S.J. Poirier G.M.-C. Wagaman P.C. Chambers J. Pyati J. Hom Y.-L. Galindo J.E. Huvar A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Erlander M.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1685-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As an approach to study the molecular pathobiology of OA, we have used a mRNA differential display (7Liang P. Pardee A. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar) to screen for differences in gene expression between osteoarthritic and nonarthritic cartilage. A major advantage of this methodology is the capability to amplify minute amounts of transcripts and rapidly determine their nucleotide sequences. We have identified over 120 transcripts that appear to be differentially expressed in OA cartilage, only 29 of which correspond to known proteins. 2S-I. Hu and R. M. Crowl, unpublished observations. In this report, we describe the identification and characterization of one transcript (provisionally named ORF480) and its translation product, both of which are expressed at elevated levels in OA cartilage. The nucleotide sequence of ORF480 is identical to a recently described transformation-sensitive cDNA isolated from human fibroblasts (8Zumbrunn J. Trueb B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). ORF480 codes for a protein with distinct domains of homology to human mac25 (9Swisshelm K. Ryan K. Tsuchiya K. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4472-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and to a bacterial serine protease (HtrA) that is critical for the cellular response to thermal and oxidative stress (10Lipinska B. Sharma S. Georgopoulos C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10053-10067Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 11Lipinska B. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1791-1797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This report provides the first evidence that the ORF480-encoded protein (human HtrA) exhibits autocatalytic cleavage as well as endoproteolytic activity against an exogenous substrate, β-casein. When incubated in the presence of serum, HtrA protein binds to and forms a stable complex with α1-antitrypsin. In addition, we have determined that the sequence of the HtrA-related domain of ORF480 is highly conserved among mammalian species. These findings open new avenues of investigation toward an understanding of the biological function(s) of mammalian HtrA. Total RNA from OA and nonarthritic human cartilage was isolated according to published methods (12Amin A.R. Attur M. Patel R.N. Thakker G.D. Marshall P.J. Rediske J. Stuchin S.A. Patel I.R. Abramson S.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and supplied to our laboratories by Drs. I. Patel and A. Amin (Hospital for Joint Diseases, New York University Medical School, New York, NY). Independent biochemical analyses of the isolated cartilage 3R. Goldberg, personal communication. as well as the differential mRNA expression of type II and type III collagens (see “Results”) were consistent with the indicated pathological state of the samples used in this study. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 0.2 μg of total RNA with each of the three anchored oligodeoxythymidylic acid primers from GenHunter Corp. The reaction (20 μl) was carried out at 37 °C for 60 min. For PCR amplification, 1 μl of the cDNA served as the template in a 10-μl reaction mix containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.001% gelatin, 2 μmdeoxynucleotide triphosphates, 0.2 μm 5′ arbitrary primer (AP-49 or AP-58 from the RNA image kits obtained from GenHunter Corp.), 2 μm of the same anchored primer used in the cDNA synthesis, 5 μCi of [α-33P]dATP (2000 Ci/mmol; DuPont New England Nuclear), and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). Samples were subjected to 40 cycles of amplification under the following conditions: denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 40 °C for 2 min, extension at 72 °C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The resulting PCR products were resolved on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel. PCR products of interest were excised from the gel, and the DNA was eluted and reamplified by PCR using the same primers and conditions described above, excluding the labeled nucleotide. PCR products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel, excised, and ligated into cloning vector PCR II 2.1 (TA cloning kit; Invitrogen). Clones of the PCR-generated fragments were obtained by transformation of Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.). DNA sequences were determined for at least three independent clones of each fragment using Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing on an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencing system (Perkin-Elmer). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA isolated from OA and nonarthritic cartilage. 200 ng of total RNA and 10 pmol of primer T30VN (where V = A, C, and G and N = A, C, G, and T) were mixed in a 6-μl volume, heated to 72 °C for 3 min, and quenched on ice for 3 min. Reverse transcription reactions (10 μl) were prepared with final concentrations of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 6 mmMgCl2, 75 mm KCl, 1 mmdeoxynucleotide triphosphates, and 10 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. This mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 1.5 h and at 94 °C for 5 min and quenched on ice. Serial dilutions of cDNA from different individuals were used for PCR amplification with a primer set for actin (forward primer, GGAGTCCTGTGGCATCCACGAAACTAC; reverse primer, CACATCTGCTGGAAGGTGGACAGCG) in a 25-μl reaction volume with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin, 20 μm deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and 1.25 units of AmpliTaq Gold Polymerase (Perkin Elmer). PCR was performed for 32 cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 63 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2 min, and a final incubation at 72 °C for 7 min). Nine μl of the reaction mix were run on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, stained with SYBRTM Green I (Molecular Probes), and quantified using fluorescence imaging and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Concentrations were selected to ensure that the reaction was within the log phase of amplification. These conditions were used for PCR reactions to quantify the relative levels of expression for 49A50/58A5 (ORF480), Hsp60, type II collagen, and type III collagen. Levels of expression were normalized to the levels of actin for each sample. A negative control reaction with no template was carried out for each primer set to verify the absence of contamination. Separate first-strand cDNA syntheses were carried out with 500 ng of total RNA isolated from four OA cartilage samples. Aliquots were combined for the synthesis of double-stranded cDNA with anchors ligated at both ends according to the MarathonTM cDNA system (CLONTECH). An antisense primer derived from the sequence of clones 58A5/49A50 (TGTGCATTGACCTTTGGGTGCTGAC) and an anchor-specific primer were used for 5′ RACE stepdown PCR. The reaction mix contained 15 mm KOAc, 3.5 mm MgOAc, 75 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and KlenTaq-1 DNA polymerase mix (CLONTECH). The reaction times and temperatures were as follows: 94 °C for 5 min; five cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 2 min; five cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 70 °C for 2 min; 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 2 min, and a final incubation at 72 °C for 7 min. Reaction products were run on a 1.4% agarose gel. DNA fragments between 1.5–3 kb and between 1–1.5 kb were isolated from the gel and cloned using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Colonies were screened by PCR with two ORF480-specific primers. The clones with the longest inserts were identified by PCR using T7 and M13 (reverse) primers. Plasmid DNA from clones was prepared and sequenced as described above. The cDNA for ORF480 was generated by PCR using cDNA derived from MRHF fibroblast RNA (human foreskin fibroblasts; BioWhittaker) as the template. Initially, PCR primers AAACGGATCCACCATGCAGATCCCGCGCGCC and AAACGAATTCCTATGGGTCAATTTCTTCGGG corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the coding region of GenBank accession number D87258 were used. PCR was performed with Pfu polymerase for 25 cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min). However, due to the high GC content within a region 5′ of the unique HindIII site, PCR with this pair of primers generated a cDNA fragment with an internal deletion of 380 bp within the GC-rich region. The sequence of the DNA fragment 3′ of the unique HindIII site was correct. Therefore, primers AAACGGATCCAGAGTCGCCATGCAGATC and TTGTCACGATCAGTCCATCT were used to generate a DNA fragment 5′ of the unique HindIII site. PCR conditions were modified to include 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, which allowed the generation of the correctly amplified fragment. The resulting two DNA fragments were joined together at the HindIII site and subcloned into theBamHI/EcoRI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The final cDNA fragment of ORF480 corresponds to nucleotides 38–1491 of D87258. Frozen milled human cartilage (50 mg) was extracted with 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 1m NaCl and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Boehringer Mannheim) at 4 °C. Samples containing approximately 50 μg of total protein were prepared for SDS gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis with anti-HtrA antiserum using the ECL detection system (Amersham). Rabbit antiserum was generated against the human HtrA domain (residues 191–480) expressed in E. coli. 4S-I. Hu and J. Peppard, unpublished observations. This antiserum contains some immunoreactivity to albumin. The S328A mutation was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To avoid difficulty in primer extension with Pfu polymerase through the GC-rich region located 5′ of the uniqueHindIII site of ORF480 cDNA, we cloned a DNA fragment corresponding to amino acid residue 161 to the end of the coding region into pcDNA3 and used it as a template. Primers used for the mutagenesis reaction were CATCAACTATGGAAACGCGGGAGGCCCGTTAG and CTAACGGGCCTCCCGCGTTTCCATAGTTGATG. After confirming by sequence analysis that the correct mutation had been generated, the full-length ORF480 was reassembled into pcDNA3. The resulting plasmid was designated pcDNA3-ORF480-S328A. The translation product of ORF480 was synthesized in vitro using pcDNA3-ORF480 and pcDNA3-ORF480-S328A as templates in the TNT T7 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega), incorporating [35S]methionine. The reaction products were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. At the end of the run, the gel was dried under a vacuum at 80 °C and analyzed on a PhosphorImagerTM (Molecular Dynamics). Human embryonic kidney cells, 293 (American Type Culture Collection), were maintained in Minimal Essential Medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator. Cells were stably transfected with the pcDNA3-ORF480 expression vector using the ProFection Mammalian Transfection System (Promega). Clones were then selected by incubation with G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a concentration of 400 μg/ml and incubated in serum-free medium for expression of ORF480. Sf9 insect cells were maintained as suspension cultures at 28 °C in Sf-900II SF medium. Recombinant baculovirus stocks carrying the ORF480 cDNA were generated utilizing the pFASTBAC1/ORF480 donor plasmid and the BAC-TO-BAC Baculovirus Expression System (Life Technologies, Inc.). Optimal infection conditions were determined by varying the multiplicity of infection and time course. Expression of the secreted ORF480 protein in both heterologous systems was confirmed by the immunoblot blot analysis of culture supernatants using anti-HtrA antiserum as described above. For immunoblot analyses to discern the presence of high molecular weight complexes of HtrA protein (Fig. 6), we used anti-HtrA antiserum that had been depleted of antialbumin cross-reactivity by affinity chromatography. 5J. Peppard, unpublished observations. To monitor the protease activity of ORF480-encoded protein, 75 μl of culture medium were incubated with 50 μg of β-casein (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) for 1 h at 37 °C, and the reaction products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using either standard 12% or 4–20% gradient gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories). A ZOO-BLOT (CLONTECH) membrane filter containingEcoRI-digested genomic DNA from various species was prehybridized for 30 min at 65 °C and then hybridized with a random-primed 32P-labeled BamHI-EcoRI (∼900 bp; HtrA-related domain) fragment of ORF480 in rapid hybridization buffer (Amersham) at 65 °C for 90 min. The hybridized filter was washed with 2× SSC (sodium chloride/sodium citrate)/0.1% SDS for 20 min at room temperature (twice for 10 min at 65 °C and washed once with 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 10 min. The results were visualized using a PhosphorImagerTM(Molecular Dynamics). Cow HtrA was isolated from a lung cDNA phage library (CLONTECH) by hybridization screening using the human cDNA as a probe. HtrA cDNA fragments were isolated by PCR from rabbit and guinea pig liver cDNA using primers designed from the human coding sequence corresponding to regions of maximum amino acid sequence identity withE. coli htrA. The DNA sequences of the derived clones were determined as described above. Additional PCR primers were then designed and used for 5′ and 3′ RACE to obtain extended cDNA clones. In the course of screening for differences in gene expression between osteoarthritic and nonarthritic cartilage by mRNA differential display, two PCR fragments, designated 49A50 and 58A5, were identified using different arbitrary primers (Fig.1). Sequence analysis of 49A50 and 58A5 demonstrated that the two cloned PCR products correspond to the 3′ end of the same mRNA (data not shown). Using the 5′ RACE technique (13Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), a ∼1.4-kb PCR fragment corresponding to 49A50/58A5 was isolated and cloned from OA cartilage-derived cDNA. The DNA sequences of two independent clones derived from RACE products C05 and C13 revealed overlapping open reading frames of 337 and 328 codons, respectively. Because no ATG initiation codon was evident in the 5′ sequences of clones C05 and C13, and Northern blot data indicated a mRNA size of over 2 kb (data not shown), it was evident that these cartilage-derived cDNA clones did not represent the entire transcript. At this point in the study, a BLAST (14Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) search of the GenBank and EST databases identified two 3′ EST sequences (GenBank accession numbers W47107 andW67176) and a 2036-bp cDNA entry (GenBank accession number D87258). The translated sequence of GenBank entry D87258 contains an open reading frame of 480 amino acids (ORF480). The DNA sequence of clone C05 was identical to bases 477–1646 of D87258, except for a 1-bp difference (a probable PCR-generated error). Thus, the cDNA clones isolated from OA cartilage and the D87258 sequence cloned from osteoblasts represent the same gene product. RT-PCR analysis indicated that the mRNA for ORF480 is expressed in human placenta and in normal human dermal fibroblasts (data not shown). Overlapping PCR-generated fragments corresponding to the entire ORF480 were isolated from cDNA derived from fibroblast RNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). The DNA sequence of the fibroblast-derived ORF480 cDNA was determined to be identical to that of GenBank entryD87258. An alignment of the cDNA clones described in this report in relation to those identified from searching the databases is illustrated in Fig. 2. Also shown in Fig.2 are the deduced protein domains within ORF480 as described below.Figure 2Schematic illustration of ORF480 cDNA clones and protein coding domains. GenBank accession numberD87258, which is illustrated as a shaded bar, is a 2036-bp cDNA containing a 480-codon open reading frame (lighter shaded area). Overlapping differential display PCR products (49A50 and 58A5), EST sequences (GenBank accession numbers W47107 and W67176), and cDNA clones from human cartilage (C05 and C13) and normal dermal fibroblasts (pcDNA3/ORF480) are depicted relative toD87258 as horizontal lines drawn to scale. The mac25 and HtrA homology domains within ORF480 are indicated as open rectangles preceded by the secretory signal sequence (S). The Kazal-type inhibitor motif (KI) within the mac25 domain and the PDZ-related sequence within the HtrA domain are depicted as open triangles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) During the course of the work described here, Zumbrunn and Trueb (8Zumbrunn J. Trueb B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) reported the isolation of the same cDNA from human fibroblast; the expression of the corresponding mRNA was repressed in SV40-transformed cells. Their analysis of the sequence encoded by the cDNA revealed a putative signal sequence (codons 1–22), an IGF-binding protein 3 homology domain (codons 1–140), a Kazal-type inhibitor motif (codons 97–155), and the major domain of homology toE. coli HtrA (codons 140–480). In addition, a recent survey of proteins containing the so-called PDZ domains (15Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) includes bacterial HtrA as well as the human HtrA homologue. The location of the PDZ domain within ORF480 (codons 372–466) is indicated schematically in Fig. 2. Our analysis of the ORF480 sequence, although in general agreement, differed somewhat from that of Zumbrunn and Trueb due to differences in searching methods and the scope of the databases used. Using BLASTP to search the GenBank protein sequence data base, we found human mac25, a presumed member of the IGF-binding protein family (9Swisshelm K. Ryan K. Tsuchiya K. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4472-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), to have the highest degree of homology to the amino-terminal domain of ORF480 (Fig.3 A). For instance, thep value for the mac25 alignment with ORF480 residues 107–158 is 1.4 × 10−23, compared withp = 3.8 × 10−8 for insulin-related growth factor-binding protein 3. Interestingly, unlike IGF-binding proteins, the sequence of mac25 within the region homologous to ORF480 contains a conserved Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor motif (Fig.3). Moreover, as pointed out by Kato et al. (16Kato M.V. Sato H. Tsukada T. Ikawa Y. Aizawa S. Nagayoshi M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1361-1364PubMed Google Scholar), mac25 is more closely related to follistatin than to insulin-related growth factor-binding protein, and we find that the sequence of follistatin also contains the Kazal-type inhibitor motif (Fig. 3). To verify the initial differential display results and quantify the relative difference in the mRNA levels of human HtrA (ORF480) in OA cartilage compared with nonarthritic cartilage, oligonucleotide primer pairs specific for a 3′ segment of ORF480 cDNA were used for semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig.4 A) The results of this analysis, using expression levels of β-actin and Hsp60 for comparison, indicate that HtrA mRNA is present at levels that are ∼7-fold higher in OA cartilage than in nonarthritic controls. Also included in Fig. 4 A are data for both type II (COL2A) and type III (COL3A) collagen mRNA, which were also identified in our differential display screening, that show that levels of these transcripts are significantly elevated in the OA-derived samples used in these studies, a finding that is consistent with previous reports of induced collagen synthesis in remodeling OA cartilage (17Aigner T. Bertling W. Stöss H. Weseloh G. von der Mark K. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To confirm the differential expression of human HtrA protein in OA cartilage, high-salt extracts of OA and control cartilage samples were tested by immunoblot analysis using an antiserum prepared against the HtrA domain expressed in E. coli (Fig. 4 B). These data reveal a striking difference in the levels of HtrA protein detected in OA versus nonarthritic cartilage extracts, results that are consistent with the analysis of the mRNA levels. A cDNA segment containing the entire coding region of ORF480 was inserted into expression vector pcDNA3 (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 2). This construct directed the expression of the expected size protein (M r∼50,000) in an in vitro transcription/translation system (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1 and2). Lower molecular weight products (M r ∼40–45,000) were also evident in the gel electrophoresis pattern, a pattern that was remarkably similar to that observed for E. coli HtrA (11Lipinska B. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1791-1797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Skorko-Glonek J. Wawrzynow A. Krzewski K. Kurpierz K. Lipinska B. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 163: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Converting the conserved active site serine 328 in ORF480 to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis resulted in the elimination of the lower molecular weight proteins (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3 and 4). This result, which was previously shown for E. coli HtrA (18Skorko-Glonek J. Wawrzynow A. Krzewski K. Kurpierz K. Lipinska B. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 163: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), demonstrates that the translation product of ORF480, the human HtrA protein, is a serine protease with autocatalytic activity. When ORF480 is expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (Fig.5 B), the primary translation product (M r ∼50,000) is detected by immunoblot analysis using anti-HtrA antiserum in the culture medium by 41 h postinfection. A distinct set of lower molecular weight proteins is evident by immunoblot analysis in samples taken at 65 and 73 h postinfection (Fig. 5 B, top panel), which is consistent with the autocatalytic activity of the ORF480-encoded protein (HtrA) observed in the cell-free expression system described above. As discussed below, a high molecular weight protein is observed by immunoblot analysis in the samples taken at 65 and 73 h postinfection. Incubation of the ORF480-encoded protein (HtrA) with β-casein results in the generation of specific proteolytic cleavage products of this substrate (Fig. 5 B, bottom panel). To examine the expression of ORF480 in mammalian cells, cultures of 293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3/ORF480, resulting in the synthesis and secretion of the M r ∼50,000 HtrA protein as determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5 C, top panel). The media from different isolated clones derived from the transfected culture contain endoprotease activity against β-casein (Fig. 5 C, bottom panel), resulting in at least four distinct fragments of the substrate, which is similar to the pattern observed in the experiment using baculovirus-expressed HtrA shown in Fig.5 B. The level of proteolytic activity in the samples from each clone (Fig. 5 C, bottom panel) correlates with the relative amount of immunoreactive HtrA protein observed in the immunoblot (Fig. 5 C, top panel). The S328A mutant of ORF480 (HtrA) expressed in transfected 293 cells lacks proteolytic activity against β-casein (Fig. 5 D) and does not exhibit autoproteolysis (Fig. 6). In immunoblots showing ORF480 protein (HtrA) expressed in both 293 cells and in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, high molecular weight bands (M r > 120,000) were evident (indicated with asterisks in Fig. 5, B andC). Amino acid sequence analysis (Edman degradation) of the protein isolated from this fraction indicated a 1:1 ratio of HtrA sequence (XAPLAAGXPDRXEPA, residues 30–44) and the amino-terminal sequence of the mature form of α1-antitrypsin (XVLQGHAVXE). Results from additional expression experiments demonstrated that the stable complex observed in cultures incubated in the presence of serum was not detected in serum-free conditions (Fig.6). In addition to the indicated protein band (*) migrating above the 121-kDa standard, an immunoreactive band around 78 kDa appears after 48–72 h of culture incubation, which is probably a degradation product of the complex. The addition of purified α1-antitrypsin to cultures incubated in serum-free medium resulted in the formation of the high molecular weight proteins with the same electrophoretic mobility as those observed in cultures with serum. The formation of the stable HtrA/α1-antitrypsin complex does not occur when the active site serine 328 in HtrA is mutated to alanine (Fig. 6). In anticipation of experiments to study the regulation of ORF480 (HtrA) in animal models of OA, we sought to determine whether the human cDNA could be used as a probe to screen for homologous cDNA clones from other mammalian species. Fig.7 A shows a genomic ZOO-BLOT analysis in which total EcoRI-digested genomic DNA isolated from various mammalian and one avian species was hybridized with32P-labeled human cDNA under relatively high stringency (see “Experimental Procedures”). The results, which show specific hybridization to a limited number of genomic DNA fragments, suggest that the gene sequence coding for the HtrA-related domain of ORF480 is conserved among vertebrate species. This interpretation was confirmed by analysis of the nucleotide sequences of partial ORF480 cDNA clones isolated from cow, guinea pig, and rabbit, which are 91, 89, and 88% identical to the human sequence, respectively (GenBank accession numbers AF097707, AF097706, AF097708, and AF097709). Moreover, the amino acid sequences derived from the respective cDNA sequences of the three mammalian species are 98% identical to the human sequence (Fig. 7 B). As part of an ongoing effort to profile alterations in gene expression in osteoarthritic cartilage, we identified and characterized a cDNA, referred to in this report as ORF480, and its translation product. The data reported here indicate that the levels of ORF480 mRNA and protein are significantly elevated in osteoarthritic cartilage. ORF480 encodes a protein with two distinct domains of homology. The amino-terminal domain of ORF480 is homologous to mac25, a recently characterized gene product related to insulin-related growth factor-binding protein (9Swisshelm K. Ryan K. Tsuchiya K. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4472-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and follistatin (16Kato M.V. Sato H. Tsukada T. Ikawa Y. Aizawa S. Nagayoshi M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1361-1364PubMed Google Scholar). The second domain, comprising the majority of the ORF480 amino acid sequence, is greater than 40% identical to bacterial HtrA serine protease. The evidence presented here demonstrates the in vitro proteolytic activity of the ORF480-encoded protein, which we conclude is the human homologue of bacterial HtrA. In bacteria, HtrA is a critical component of the universal cellular response to stress, which is characterized by the induction of a set of so-called heat shock proteins (19Neidhardt F.C. VanBogelen R.A. Vaughn V. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1984; 18: 295-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In addition to temperature elevation, heat shock proteins are induced by oxidative stress (20Christman M.F. Morgan R.W. Jacobson F.S. Ames B.N. Cell. 1985; 41: 753-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), viral (phage) infection (21Bahl H. Echols H. Straus D.B. Court D. Crowl R. Georgopoulos C.P. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and intracellular expression of aberrant proteins (22Goff S.A. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1985; 41: 587-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). A functional htrA (hightemperature requirement) gene is indispensable for the bacterial cell to survive heat shock (11Lipinska B. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1791-1797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HtrA is identical to DegP (23Strauch K. Johnson K. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), a serine endoprotease originally named “Do” as one of several proteolytic activities purified from E. coli (24Goldberg A.L. Swamy K.H.S. Chung C.H. Larimore F.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 80: 680-702Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Mutation of the active site serine 236 to alanine in HtrA results in a loss of protease activity in vitro and a loss of function, as determined by the inability to suppress the thermosensitivity ofhtrA-null mutants (11Lipinska B. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1791-1797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipinska et al. (11Lipinska B. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1791-1797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the role of HtrA is proteolytic cleavage of toxic denatured proteins in the periplasmic space. Additional experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis has been recently reported by other investigators (25Laskowska E. Kuczynska-Wisnik D. Skorko-Glonek J. Taylor A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 555-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 26Kolomar H. Waller P.R.H. Sauer R.T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5925-5929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the conservation of the HtrA (ORF480) sequence as shown in this report (at the DNA level in mammals and at the amino acid level in bacteria), HtrA function may also be conserved; however, any definitive description of its biological role will require further investigation. Identification of physiologically relevant substrates for the human serine protease encoded by ORF480 will be an important aspect of those studies. Possible substrates of interest include other proteases, extracellular matrix proteins, growth factors, and proteins that modulate growth factors. The autocatalytic cleavage of human HtrA protein that we observed in vitro may reflect a biologically significant mode of regulation in vivo, because at least one processed form of HtrA is detected by immunoblot analysis in OA cartilage. The finding that α1-antitrypsin binds to and forms a stable complex with HtrA suggests that this serine protease inhibitor may play a role in its regulation in vivo. As one would anticipate, the proteolytic activity of human HtrA is inhibited by 1–2 μmα1-antitrypsin. 6R. Ghai, personal communication. Levels of various protease inhibitors, including α1-antitrypsin, are known to be altered in osteoarthritic cartilage (27Walton E.A. Upfold L.I. Stephens R.W. Ghosh P. Taylor T.K.F. Semin. Arthritis Rheum. 1981; 1: 73-74Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Additional experimental evidence will be required to address the intriguing aspects of how human HtrA expression and activation are regulated. The high degree of conservation of mammalian HtrA and the addition of a new functional domain during evolution, namely mac25, suggest a biological role for the ORF480-encoded protein (HtrA) beyond that of processing denatured proteins. Although mac25 was initially described as a member of the IGF-binding protein family (9Swisshelm K. Ryan K. Tsuchiya K. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4472-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), Kato et al. (16Kato M.V. Sato H. Tsukada T. Ikawa Y. Aizawa S. Nagayoshi M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1361-1364PubMed Google Scholar) noted that mac25 is more closely related to follistatin, an activin-binding protein. They demonstrated that its expression in transfected osteosarcoma cells results in clonal growth inhibition. A similar phenomenon was consistently observed during the process of isolating clones of human 293 cells transfected with ORF480 cDNA. 7M. Klein and S-I. Hu, unpublished observations. It is possible that human HtrA is involved in cell growth regulation, perhaps via a modulation of growth factor systems other than IGF, e.g. the activin/inhibin system (28Petraglia F. Placenta. 1997; 18: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The Kazal-type inhibitor motif in ORF480-encoded protein, which is conserved in a diverse group of serine protease inhibitors, also occurs within mac25, follistatin, and agrin. Agrin and agrin-related proteins appear to function as extracellular components that bind to and regulate the activity of growth factors (29Patthy L. Nikolics K. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 76-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recombinant agrin has been shown to inhibit serine proteases of the trypsin class but not the thrombin class (30Biroc S.L. Payan D.G. Fisher J.M. Dev. Brain Res. 1993; 75: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The presence of the protease inhibitor motif in ORF480 suggests that the human HtrA serine protease may be a self-regulating enzyme; however, the alternative explanation – that it may regulate other serine proteases – should not be excluded. The experimental results reported here demonstrating the in vitro activities of human HtrA, together with clues derived from the nature of the various proteins to which it is related, will guide future experimental approaches to reveal the (patho)physiological role of mammalian HtrA. We thank R. Kramer and J. Liebman for comments on the early versions of this manuscript, J. Peppard for preparing antisera against human HtrA, R. Goldberg for the biochemical analyses of the cartilage specimens used in this study, and G. Nye for performing the amino acid sequence analysis."

The multicopy maintenance protein (Mcm) 7 subunit of the replication licensing factor-M was identified as a substrate of the E3-ubiquitin ligase/E6-AP by its interaction with human papillomavirus-18E6. Mcm7 is ubiquitinated in vivo in both an E6-AP-dependent and -independent manner. E6-AP functions in these reactions independently of the viral oncogene E6. We show that recognition of Mcm7 by E6-AP is mediated by a homotypic interaction motif present in both proteins, called the L2G box. These findings served as the basis for the definition of substrate specificity for E6-AP. A small cluster of proteins whose function is intimately associated with the control of cell growth and/or proliferation contains the L2G box and is thereby implicated in an E6-AP and, by default, HPV-E6-dependent ubiquitination pathway.

Selective proteolysis represents a fast and irreversible way for the control of the regulation of transition states in biology and is commonly employed from bacteriophages to human cells (1Murray A. Cell. 1995; 81: 149-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Post-translational modification of a lysine residue from an acceptor protein by ε-amidation with the C-terminal glycine residue of a poly-ubiquitin chain serves as a signal for selective proteolysis by the 26 S proteasome (2Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). This modification is a particularly effective form of regulation for many cellular control processes where a certain unidirectional and irreversible sequential order of events is crucial for the fidelity of a system, such as the regulation of S-phase entry or the anaphase cell cycle transition (3King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J.-M. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is transferred onto substrate proteins by an enzymatic cascade (4Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ubiquitin is first activated as a thiol ester on a ubiquitin-activating enzyme in an ATP-dependent reaction, and the ubiquitin thiols are then transferred to the ubiquitin-conjugating E21 enzyme and finally ligated to the target protein in concert with the E3 specificity factors. These E3 components provide substrate recognition and are thus generally considered to give specificity to the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis system. E6-AP in association with the oncogenic E6 proteins from the human papillomavirus (HPV) resembles an E3 enzyme in that it targets the cellular tumor suppressor p53 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation (5Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar, 6Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Viestra R.D. Howley P.M.

In contrast with other E3 proteins, such as the anaphase-promoting complex (3King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J.-M. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), or the S-phase entry specific SKP1, Cdc53, F box protein complex (8Feldman R.M.R. Correll C.C. Kaplan K.B. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 221-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 9Skowyra D. Craig K.L. Tyers M. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar), E6-AP functions not only as an adapter between a ubiquitin acceptor substrate protein and the E2 enzyme but has intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity. Thus E6-AP is a thiol ubiquitin acceptor from its E2 enzyme, selects substrate, and serves as the ultimate ubiquitin donor that directly couples activated ubiquitin to target proteins (10Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse L.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Besides its E6-associated function, E6-AP mutations have been linked with Angelman syndrome, and this serves as the first example of a genetic disorder associated with the ubiquitination pathway in mammals (11Kishino T. Lalande M. Wagstaff J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 12Albrecht U. Sutcliffe J.S. Cattanach B.M. Beechey C.V. Armstrong D. Eichele G. Beaudet A.L. Nat.

Genet. 1997; 15: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Despite its E6-dependent association with p53 in HPV pathology, the role for the E6-AP ligase function in cell growth and proliferation is poorly understood. Very little is known about other cellular substrates of E6-AP, but the link with Angelman syndrome suggests the existence of additional, essential targets for the E6-AP E3-ligase system. A sequential order of cell cycle transitions ensure that DNA replication takes place only once per cell cycle. This regulation is provided by the replication licensing factor (RLF) that is activated on exit from metaphase, and as a consequence, cells become competent for the initiation of DNA replication. Before replication is ultimately initiated at the G1/S transition, however, a series of checkpoint controls during G1-phase have to ensure the fidelity of the entire cell for duplication. Once started, the competence for the initiation of DNA replication is erased by inactivating RLF (14Chong J.P.J. Thömmes P. Blow J.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 102-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 15Krude T. Jackman M. Pines J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1997; 88: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 16Nurse P. Cell. 1994; 79: 547-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Differential polyethylene glycol precipitations and subsequent purification from Xenopus egg extracts separates RLF into two components, RLF-B and RLF-M (17Chong J.P.J. Mahbubani H.M. Khoo C.-Y. Blow J. Nature. 1995; 375: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). RLF-M represents a hetero-hexamer complex that is conserved in all eukaryotes analyzed so far and consists of six members of the Mcm family of proteins. Mcm proteins are essential for DNA replication initiation (18Kearsey S.E. Maiorano D. Holmes E.C. Todorov I.T. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and were initially isolated as genetically defined mutants fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae by their inability to replicate plasmids containing certain yeast replication origins (19Maine G.T. Sinha P. Tye B.K. Genetics. 1984; 106: 365-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mcm proteins are loaded at the origin of replication and move with the replication fork (20Baker T.A. Bell S.P. Cell. 1998; 92: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar); they show homologies with DNA-dependent ATPases (21Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) and co-fractionate with a helicase activity in vitro (22Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), which taken together suggests that RLF-M is a putative candidate for a eukaryotic hexameric replication fork helicase. In this study we show that Mcm7 interacts, in the context of the entire Mcm complex, with the HPV-18E6 onco-protein, and this discovery led us to identify Mcm7 as a novel E6-AP substrate. We describe that Mcm7 is ubiquitinated in an E6-AP-dependent manner, and we define the substrate recognition sequence for E6-AP in Mcm7. Intriguingly, the E6-AP/Mcm7 interaction is obtained through a novel homotypic motif, and this motif in turn is also used by the HPV-18E6 protein for interaction. We call this motif the L2G box. 2 × 107 yeast transformants from a human lymphocyte library in the vector pACT were screened with selection at 30 μg/ml 3-aminotriazole using pAS1-GAL4 fused in frame to full-length HPV-18E6 as a bait. Positive cells were analyzed for β-galactosidase activity. For confirmation of the screen the plasmids from 3-aminotriazole-resistant and β-galactosidase-positive colonies were rescued in Escherichia coli DH5α and then retransformed into S. cerevisiae. HeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described previously (23Ossipow V. Tassan J.-P. Nigg E.A. Schibler U. Cell. 1995; 83: 137-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown in suspension culture and harvested at mid–logarithmic phase at a cell density of 4–5 × 105 cells/ml. Prior to harvesting the cells were grown in the presence of the peptide aldehyde LLnL (25 μm, Sigma) for 2 h (the addition of the proteasome inhibitors proved to be essential for the isolation of 18E6 as a high molecular component associating with the RLF-M complex). Lysis buffer A contained 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 3.5 mmMgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 20 μml-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 20 μm 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, 50 μm LLnL, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM, Sigma), 0.2 mm NaF, and 30 mm4-nitrophenyl phosphate. Nuclei were isolated and separated at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant was designated cytoplasmic extract. For the peptide assays shown in Fig.2 B, nuclei were first extracted in buffer B (as for A but with 20% glycerol and 100 mm KCl), and after centrifugation at 100,000 × g, the supernatants obtained were designated soluble nuclear extract. The pellet was then extracted in buffer A containing 0.4 m KCl. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g, the supernatant was designated high salt nuclear extract. The remaining pellet contained virtually no Mcm7 nor Mcm3 protein as judged by Western blotting of aliquot fractions. For gel filtration experiments as shown in Fig. 1,A and B, the nuclei were extracted with buffer B containing 0.4 m KCl (NXT), diluted after centrifugation 1:3 in buffer A, and stepwise precipitated with polyethylene glycol employing a 3 and 9% step as described (17Chong J.P.J. Mahbubani H.M. Khoo C.-Y. Blow J. Nature. 1995; 375: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The 9% fraction was immediately loaded onto a Superose 12 column of a fast protein liquid chromatography-Pharmacia system and equilibrated with buffer A containing 150 mm KCl. Loading volume was 100 μl. 1-ml fractions were collected, and the column was standardized with marker proteins as indicated. Fractions obtained were concentrated by 7.5% trichloroacetic acid precipitation in the presence of 0.01% sodium deoxycholate prior to analysis on reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Figure 1Mcm7 interacts with HPV-18E6 in vivo.

Immunoprecipitates were analyzed for Mcm7 by Western blotting.C, co-immunoprecipitation from NXT of Mcm7 and HPV-18E6 withGST, 18E6, and Mcm7 antibodies.

Constructs for deletion analysis were done in the vector bluescribe SK (Stratagene) with the coordinates as indicated in Fig. 1 D. GST constructs have been described previously (24Pim D. Storey A. Thomas M. Massimi P. Banks P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1869-1876PubMed Google Scholar). His6-HPV-18E6- and His6-MCM7-containing vectors were constructed by in-frame ligation of the full-length HPV-18E6 or an Mcm7 fragment (fragment 554–720) into the vector pET2A-(Stratagene) containing the 6-histidine-tag (His)6. The His6-Mcm7 reporter construct for the ubiquitination assays was cloned by ligating aBamHI/SalI fragment from MCM7 (fragment 175–720) in-frame into a His6-containing pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The Mcm7 (Δ640–646) deletion mutation was generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the polymerase chain reaction and ligated into pcDNA3 (pcDNA3-His6-Mcm7ΔL2G). All constructs were verified by dideoxy sequencing. The E6-AP-containing plasmids were done in pcDNA3-E6-AP and pcDNA3-E6-APΔE from human E6-AP DNA isoform 1, originally obtained from M. Scheffner (see Ref. 10Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse L.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). The HA-ubiquitin-containing plasmid pCMV-HA-Ubi was obtained from D. Bohmann (see Ref. 25Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Immobilization of cysteine-containing peptides onto SulfoLink (Pierce) resins and the estimation of the coupling efficiency, as measured with the Ellman's Reagent (Pierce) reaction, were done according to the supplier's instructions. Coupling efficiency was comparable among the peptides used, and resins contained approximately 400 μg of peptide/ml of 50% gel slurry. For the assay, 100 μg of extract in 250 μl of buffer A and 30 μl of 50% peptide containing gel slurry were incubated at 4 °C for 20 min and then intensively washed with buffer A containing 0.4 m KCl. Proteins were eluted at 94 °C in sample solution containing 2% SDS, and aliquots were analyzed in Western blots as indicated. HeLa cell nuclear extracts or Superose 12 fractions were precleared in a mixture of protein A- and protein G-Sepharose prior to incubation with specific antibodies (2 μg/ml) on ice and subsequent purification with a mixture of protein A and protein G-Sepharose (preincubated in 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Precipitations from extracts shown in Fig.1 C and Fig. 2 E were done from 150 μg (NXT) diluted 1:1 in buffer A in the presence of 0.05% SDS and 0.05% sodium deoxycholate. Samples were washed six times in buffer A containing 0.4m KCl and twice in buffer A alone. For Western blots, the resins were boiled in loading buffer containing 2% SDS and 0.1m DTT. Western blots were developed using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence substrates (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Assays were performed with eitherin vitro translated 35S-labeled proteins produced with the TNT kit (Promega) or E. coli expressed proteins at concentrations indicated. Binding reactions were done for 2 h at either 4 °C for the assays containing TNT proteins or at room temperature in buffer A containing 0.9 m(NH4)2SO4 and 0.2 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, and then washed as indicated in Fig. 2 C with the same buffer containing Tween 20 at concentrations indicated. Binding with 35S-labeled proteins was detected by exposure to x-ray films and in Western blots for binding reactions with the recombinantE. coli expressed proteins. E. coli proteins were purified from the strain BL21(DE3) by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography for the GST fusion proteins and Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Quiagen) chromatography for the (His)6-tagged proteins. Antibodies were raised and purified essentially as described (26Edelmann H.M. Kühne C. Petritsch C. Ballou L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 963-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, polyclonal antibodies to His6-18E6 and His6-Mcm7 (554–720) were raised in rabbits. Antibodies used were affinity purified against His6-18E6 or His6-Mcm7 proteins covalently linked to BrCN-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The antibodies to GST were obtained and affinity purified in a similar way. Polyclonal peptide antibodies were raised against the peptide CATLGVGSSGRGTTYQSRPA for Mcm3 and against SAYLENSKGAPNNSC for E6-AP (peptide-E6-AP antibody) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. These antibodies were affinity purified against the peptide coupled to SulfoLink resins (Pierce). Antibodies to GST-E6-AP were a gift from M. Scheffner and purified in batch against a GST-E6-AP protein that was bound to GST-Sepharose and immobilized by cross-linking with dimethyl suberimidate (GST-E6-AP antibody). For the Mcm7 in vivoubiquitination assay, we used the protocol essentially as described (25Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) with minor modifications as follows. The pH 5.8 washing step of the Ni2+-NTA-agarose was omitted, and proteins were eluted with 1.8 ml of 200 mm imidazole. For detection of the HA-ubiquitin we used the 16B12 (Babco) monoclonal anti HA antibody; Mcm7 was detected on parallel blots. HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and transiently transfected at a density of 0.8 × 105/10-cm dish, using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Cells were collected 24 h after transfection. LLnL, if used, was added 2 h prior to harvesting of the cells. For all the experiments shown, supernatants were included in the protein purifications. We used the HPV-18E6 oncoprotein fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid interaction screen (27Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H.

Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), now referred to as the human Mcm7 protein, was isolated in the screen and represented approximately 15% of the positive colonies obtained. Control strains carrying Gal4-p53, Gal4-HPV-16E5, or Gal4-HPV-16E7 baits did not show interaction with Mcm7 in a yeast two-hybrid assay, thus proving specificity for the selection procedure used (not shown). Six different types of Mcm proteins have been described, and together they form a hetero-hexamer complex which is the functional unit (29Burkhart R. Schulte D. Hu D. Musahl C. Gohring F. Knippers R.

From the 9% polyethylene glycol fraction (a fraction that was previously shown to contain RLF-M (17Chong J.P.J. Mahbubani H.M. Khoo C.-Y. Blow J. Nature. 1995; 375: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar)) from high salt nuclear extracts (NXT), HPV-18E6 and Mcm7 co-elute in overlapping fractions on a Superose 12 column with an apparent molecular mass of 400–600 kDa (Fig.1 A), which is within the range reported previously for an active RLF-M fraction (29Burkhart R. Schulte D. Hu D. Musahl C. Gohring F. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 30Kubota Y. Mimura S. Nishimoto S.-I. Masuda T. Nojima H. Takisawa H.

Immunoprecipitations of the relevant peak fractions, using either HPV-18E6 or Mcm7 monospecific antibodies, show precipitation of the Mcm7 protein from these Superose fractions (Fig. 1 B). HPV-18E6 co-precipitates Mcm7 only from the early Mcm7 peak fractions around 600 kDa, whereas immunoprecipitations of Mcm7 show the presence of Mcm7 proteins in fractions ranging from 600 to 400 kDa, thus indicating that HPV-18E6 interacts with a subpopulation of the Mcm complex. In addition, Mcm3 co-precipitates from these extracts with antibodies against both HPV-18E6 and Mcm7 (Fig. 1 C) demonstrating the integrity of the functional Mcm holocomplex. Mcm3 was previously shown to be less tightly associated with the RLF-M hexamer complex and was therefore used as an indicator for the integrity of the entire complex (31Thömmes P. Kubota Y. Takishawa H. Blow J.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3312-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). By having shown that the HPV-18E6/Mcm7 interaction takes place in vivo, we were next interested in determining whether E6 proteins from other HPV types could interact with Mcm7. To do this, the E6 proteins from the low risk types HPV-6 and 11 as well as from the high risk types HPV-16 and 18 were expressed as glutathioneS-transferase-E6 fusion proteins (GST), and binding toin vitro translated 35S-labeled Mcm7 protein was assessed. As can be seen from Fig.2 A, Mcm7 interacts with GST-18E6, GST-16E6, GST-11E6, and GST-6E6 indicating a strong conservation of binding to Mcm7 among both high and low risk HPV types. In order to define the region of Mcm7 bound by the E6 proteins, a deletion analysis of the Mcm7 protein was performed. A region of 78 amino acids was defined that is required for binding to HPV18-E6 (Fig.2 A), and furthermore, a binding assay using purified recombinant His6-Mcm7 (fragment 577–719) and GST-E6 proteins verified that the Mcm7/E6 association is direct (Fig.2 B). As Mcm7 interactions showed a high background with GST protein alone, the nature of specific binding conditions was determined in more detail (Fig. 2 C). This interaction was stabilized in the presence of 0.9 m(NH4)2SO4 or 2 m KCl, whereas for the elution of specific bound proteins the ionic detergent SDS was necessary, conditions that indicate that the interactions observed are specific and hydrophobic in nature (Fig. 2 C and data not shown). Sequence analysis of the Mcm7 region essential for its interaction with HPV-18E6 (Fig. 2 A) defines a stretch of amino acids that has significant homology with a region of the ubiquitin ligase, E6-AP, that was previously shown to be sufficient for interacting with HPV-16E6 in vitro (34Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4918-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A). In addition, this region shows similarity to a sequence recently described as an E6 consensus binding site that was derived from mapping data obtained for the E6-binding protein (E6BP) (35Chen J.J. Hong Y. Rustamzadeh E. Baleja J.D. Androphy E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13537-13544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and from a random peptide library screen (36Elston R.C. Naphtine S. Doorbar J. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This region is not conserved between the different Mcm family paralogues but is nearly identical among the Mcm7 vertebrate orthologues. The corresponding region in E6-AP is not conserved in any of the recently discovered E6-AP/hect domain (37Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 38Schwarz S.E. Rosa J.L. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12148-12154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) containing members of the ubiquitin ligase family. To evaluate the significance of this homology between Mcm7 and E6-AP for the E6 interactions, we used peptides spanning the core of the relevant regions (Fig. 3 A). These peptides were covalently coupled by an additional C-terminal cysteine via iodoacetyl groups to a non-ionic chromatographic “SulfoLink”-agarose matrix and used to test for specific precipitation of the Mcm7 and HPV-18E6 proteins, respectively, from HeLa cell extracts. Cytoplasmic extracts, low salt nuclear fractions, or high salt nuclear fractions (chromatin-bound proteins) were passed through these peptide columns, and after several washes with 0.4m KCl containing buffers, specifically bound proteins were eluted with 2% SDS and analyzed by Western blot for HPV 18E6 and Mcm7. Peptides of the homologous region in the E6-AP protein were able to specifically retain the HPV-18E6 protein from cytoplasmic and nuclear high salt fractions (Fig. 3 B). More strikingly, the E6-AP homology motif-containing peptides are also able to enrich for Mcm7 from cytoplasmic as well as from low and high salt nuclear fractions. Peptides that contain a Thr substitution for the conserved Leu402 show a reduction in both the HPV-18E6 and Mcm7 binding. The Mcm7 peptide columns enrich for HPV-18E6 protein in the chromatin-bound fractions only but do not form homodimers with the Mcm7 protein. In contrast to the data observed for the E6-AP resins, Mcm7 peptides carrying a Thr substitution for the corresponding Leu644 still show binding with HPV-18E6, probably reflecting a different binding affinity for either binding site to HPV-18E6. To investigate the E6-AP/Mcm7 interaction further, an in vitro binding assay was performed using purified GST-E6-AP and purified His-Mcm7 proteins. The results demonstrate that the E6-AP/Mcm7 interaction observed in the peptide assays is direct (Fig.4 A) and argue that no additional bridging or auxiliary factors are required for the E6-AP/Mcm7 interaction. Moreover, in vitro translated Mcm7 proteins deleted for the core E6-AP homology region (Δ640–646) failed to bind GST-E6-AP (Fig. 4 B). To determine whether E6-AP interacts with Mcm7 in mammalian cells, HeLa cell nuclear extracts (Fig. 4 C) were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies to both of the proteins (Mcm7 and E6-AP) and a control antibody (GST) and analyzed in Western blots for cross-immunoprecipitation. A subpopulation of E6-AP as well as of Mcm7 specifically co-precipitate with each other (lanes 2 and3), whereas no co-immunoprecipitation is seen with the control antibodies (lane 1). Again, as was seen for the HPV18-E6/Mcm7 interaction, these complexes were detectable only from log phase nuclear extracts prepared after incubation and in the presence of isopeptidase and proteasome inhibitors (see “Experimental Procedures”, negative results with no inhibitors not shown). Collectively, these data show that the E6-AP and Mcm7 proteins are able to interact in vitro and in vivo and that this interaction is mediated by homotypic motifs which we call the L2G box. In addition, the small region of Mcm7 found to be essential for the Mcm7/E6-AP interaction also represents a specific contact site for HPV-18E6 (Fig. 3 B). In contrast to the E6-AP/Mcm7 interaction, this site would not appear to be the only site on Mcm7 of interaction with HPV-18E6, since the Mcm7 (Δ640–646) deletion mutant still shows HPV-E6 binding in vitro (data not shown). We find Mcm7 associated with both the E6 and the E6-AP proteins, both of which appear to use the same stretch of amino acids in Mcm7 as a platform for direct interaction. A prediction from the E6-AP/Mcm7 interaction would be that Mcm7 is a substrate for ubiquitinati"

We examined this dilemma by comparing the kinetics and pattern of GrB-mediated activation of the executioner caspase-7 in vitro and in vivo. GrB rapidly activates procaspase-7 in vitro by cleaving between the large and small subunits leaving the propeptide intact. During GrB-mediated apoptosis, the caspase-7 propeptide is removed and cleavage occurs between the subunits. Strikingly, caspase-7 is unprocessed in caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells exposed to GrB but is rapidly activated when the cells are solubilized. Transfection with caspase-3 restores the removal of the caspase-7 propeptide and the capacity of GrB to subsequently activate the caspase. The data suggest that GrB activates caspase-3, which then removes the propeptide of caspase-7 allowing activation by GrB. Thus GrB initiates the death pathway by processing the accessible caspase-3, and the caspase-7 propeptide regulates trans-activation of the zymogen by granzyme.

A family of cytosolic cysteine proteases, the caspases, stored in most cells as zymogens play an essential role in the execution of apoptosis.

The caspases are processed to form active heterodimeric enzymes by cleavage at specific Asp residues. Activation is not thought to require removal of the propeptide; cleavage between the large and small subunits is the activating event. The zymogens of apical caspases are recruited by specific adapter molecules, either at the cytosolic face of death receptors (in the case of caspase-8 and -10) (3Muzio M. Stockwell B.R.

The third pathway that activates the caspase cascade is initiated by cytotoxic cells. The immune system utilizes lymphocyte granule-mediated apoptosis to protect the host from intracellular pathogens and tumor cells through perforin/granzyme induced apoptosis where granzyme B (GrB)1 plays a vital role. Our laboratory has proposed that perforin and GrB are internalized to endosomes of the target cell during granule-mediated apoptosis. Perforin then permeabilizes the vesicles delivering the granzyme to the cytosol where GrB rapidly induces cell death by activating a preferred caspase substrate (6Froelich C.J. Orth K. Turbov J.

Given this dilemma, it was argued that the caspase that is processed most rapidly by the granzyme in vitro would be a prime target for initial activation in vivo. Testing the human caspases, GrB was found to have the greatest preference for caspase-7 (21Talanian R.V. Yang X. Turbov J. Seth P. Ghayur T. Casiano C.A. Froelich C.J. J. Exp.

During GrB-mediated apoptosis, however, the propeptide of caspase-7 is removed first.

Remarkably, the removal of propeptide is crucial for the release of caspase-7 from a sequester site so it may then interact with the granzyme. MCF-7 cells were maintained RPMI 1640, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The caspase-3/-10a-deficient MCF-7 line was kindly provided by J. Boothman (University of Wisconsin). The absence of detectable caspase-3 and -10 was verified by immunoblotting with anti-caspase-3 and -10a/b rabbit polyclonal antibodies. The absence of caspase-3 is because of a 47-base pair deletion within exon 3 of the Casp-3 gene. This deletion results in the skipping of exon 3 during pre-mRNA splicing thereby abrogating translation of the caspase-3 mRNA (23Jänicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). The caspase-deficient MCF-7 cells were transfected with the following constructs to generate stable lines: caspase-3 in a retroviral vector (pBabe-puro) (provided by Dr. T. Sladek) and caspase-10a in pCl-neo vector. After the selection with puromycin and geneticin, respectively, stable expression of the particular caspase was verified by immunoblotting. MCF-7 control cell lines were generated by transfecting empty pBabe-puro and pCl-neo vectors. Human GrB was isolated to homogeneity from a human natural killer cell line (YT) (25Hanna W.L. Zhang X. Turbov J. Winkler U. Hudig D. Froelich C.J. Protein Purif. Exp. 1993; 4: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and a nonreplicating strain of adenovirus type 2 was cultured and isolated as described (26Seth P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Active caspase-3, -7, and -10a were expressed in Escherichia coli and isolated as described previously (27Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). The expression constructs for caspase-3 and -7 contained a His6 tag at the C terminus of the full-length protein. Full-length procaspase 7 was obtained by reducing the previously described expression times in the presence of 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 30 min. This protocol has the advantage because it yields the full-length zymogens of both caspases and not the truncated form of procaspase 7 previously described by Zhou and Salvesen (22Zhou Q. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the purified enzymes were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm based on the molar absorption coefficients for the caspases calculated from the Edelhoch relationship: Caspase-3 (e280 = 26,000 m−1 cm−1), caspase-7 (e280 = 24,510 m−1cm−1) and caspase-10 (e280 = 29,140m−1 cm−1). The processing pattern of procaspase 7 by caspases 3 and 7 were determined by incubating 2.65 mm procaspase 7 with caspase 3 at concentration ranging from ∼0.2 to 400 nm or with caspase 7 at concentration ranging from ∼0.2 to 450 nm. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, stopped by boiling in SDS sample buffer for 5 min, and the reaction products separated by SDS-PAGE on an 8–18% gradient gel and visualized by Coomassie staining. Target cells were treated with isolated GrB and AD as described previously (6Froelich C.J. Orth K. Turbov J. Seth P. Babior B.M. Gottlieb R.A. Shah G.M. Bleackley R.C. Dixit V.M. Hanna W.L. J. Biol.

To minimize in vitro processing of caspases in cell lysates before immunoblotting, targets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline 5 min before the end of the assay to remove excess GrB, transferred to a fresh tube, and lysed in buffer containing the GrB-specific anti-protease, anti-GraB (6Froelich C.J.

Detection of processed caspase -3, -7, -8, -9, and -10 was performed as described previously (6Froelich C.J. Orth K. Turbov J. Seth P. Babior B.M. Gottlieb R.A. Shah G.M. Bleackley R.C. Dixit V.M.

Anti-caspase-8, -9, and -10 were supplied by Pharmingen, Inc., D. Green, and A. Srinivasan, respectively. Treated cells (106/ml) were lysed, resolved by SDS-PAGE (10–15%), and transferred to nitrocellulose. Rabbit antisera were used at a dilution of 1:1,000 followed by incubation with anti-rabbit Ig-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a dilution of 1:10,000. Signal was visualized with the ECL kit (Amersham). During apoptotic responses in whole cells, caspase-7 is first processed by removal of the propeptide then full maturation occurs by a cut between the large and small subunits (interdomain linker site) (6Froelich C.J. Orth K. Turbov J. Seth P. Babior B.M. Gottlieb R.A. Shah G.M. Bleackley R.C. Dixit V.M. Hanna W.L. J. Biol.

However, in MCF-7 cells lacking caspase-3 and -10a, processing of caspase-7 does not follow this pattern. Therefore, we predicted that either one or both these caspases are necessary to mature caspase-7 in vivo. Accordingly, recombinant caspase-3 and -10a were tested to determine whether either preferentially removed the propeptide of caspase-7. Caspase-3 was found to efficiently clip the propeptide of procaspase-7, but importantly it was unable to process procaspase-7 to its mature active form (Fig.1 a). The specificity of cleavage mediated by caspase-3 was verified by N-terminal analysis showing the cut was between the Asp and Ala residues in the sequence Asp-Ser-Val-Asp23-Ala-Val (data not shown). Because removal of the propeptide has been postulated to endow caspases with autocatalytic activity, we also examined the pattern of processing that caspase-7 manifested against its own precursor. Active caspase-7 was found to exert only minimal proteolytic activity on procaspase-7 in accordance with previous observations that caspase 7 does not activate the truncated form of procaspase-7 and, thus, does not undergo extensive autocatalytic activation (22Zhou Q. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 b). This suggested that removal of the prodomain does not endow caspase-7 with autocatalytic activity and that another protease beside caspase-3 is required to fully mature caspase-7. Caspase-10 is postulated to be upstream of caspase-3 and -7 (21Talanian R.V. Yang X. Turbov J. Seth P. Ghayur T. Casiano C.A. Froelich C.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1323-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We then examined the rate and pattern of cleavage that caspase-10a generated against the latter family members. Unlike caspase-3, caspase-10 preferred to cleave the zymogen of caspase-7 between the large and small subunits and not release the propeptide (Fig.2 a). N-terminal sequencing verified that the cut made by caspase-10a was between the Asp and Ser residues in the sequence Ile-Gln-Ala-Asp198-Ser-Gly to separate the large and small subunits (data not shown). Consistent with a preference for cleavage after the Ile-X-X-Asp sequence (29Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar), caspase-10a also processed caspase-3 at Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp174-Ser-Gly (Fig. 2 b). Importantly, caspase-10a appeared to more efficiently cleave caspase-3 than caspase-7 at this Ile-X-X-Asp motif (data not shown). Combined with evidence that GrB activates caspase-10a, a pattern emerges in vitro where an active, apical caspase (caspase-10a for example) matures caspase-3. Subsequently, active caspase-3 removes the propeptide of caspase-7 but then caspase-10a (or GrB) is required to complete the maturation of caspase-7. On the basis of this hypothesis, we investigated the processing of caspase-7 in specific MCF-7 cell lines. Using cleavage of the propeptide of caspase-7 as an index of caspase-3 activation, the pattern and rate of processing of caspase-7 was evaluated in a caspase-3/-10a negative MCF-7 line (MCFnull) and in cells with stable expression of caspase-3. When MCFnull cells were induced to undergo GrB-mediated apoptosis, surprisingly little cleavage of procaspase-7 was detected (Fig.3 a) indicating the granzyme was unable to efficiently process this caspase. To ensure that caspase-7 was expressed and could undergo processing in the caspase-3 negative line, proteolysis was examined in a detergent-generated cytosolic extract of the MCFnull. The predicted cleavage between the large and small catalytic subunits was observed indicating that the caspase was available (Fig. 3 b). In contrast to the MCFnull cells, GrB-induced apoptosis of the caspase-3+ MCF-7 cells was associated with removal of the caspase-7 propeptide (Fig.3 c) and followed by substantial cleavage between the large and small catalytic subunits. The onset of processing of caspase-7 coincided with the appearance of cleaved caspase-3 in the transfected line (Fig. 3 d) and in the cytosolic extract (Fig.3 e). Taken together, in targets expressing caspase-3 but lacking caspase-10a, GrB appears to have the capacity to directly activate caspase-3. Caspase-7, although highly preferred by GrBin vitro, is sequestered and cannot be processed directly by the granzyme unless the propeptide is first cleaved by caspase-3. After removal of the propeptide, caspase-7 becomes susceptible to activation by GrB suggesting that a novel two-step mechanism may exist to induce this executioner caspase. The data suggest that GrB directly activates caspase-3 delivered into whole cells deficient in caspase-10a. Nevertheless, based on rates of proteolysis in vitro, GrB might initiate the caspase cascade by activating caspase-10a, which then induces caspase-3 activity. As shown for caspase-7, however, caspase-10a also appears to be inaccessible to the granzyme after delivery into the target cell (Fig.4). Using MCF-7 cells transfected with caspase-10a, we examined the rate of processing during GrB-induced apoptosis and in cytosolic extracts. When GrB was delivered to the caspase-10a + transfectant, no processing was detected (Fig.4 a). For comparison, cleavage of caspase-10a could be readily detected in detergent-generated cytosolic extracts (Fig.4 b). Although caspase-10a is a preferred substrate for GrBin vitro, because of the inability of GrB to access this zymogen in vivo, the granzyme presumably cannot initiate the cascade by activating this protease. It has recently been suggested, based on experiments performed with CTL and purified GrB, that the granzyme could directly activate caspase-8 to trigger the death pathway (30Medema J.P. Toes R.E.M. Scaffidi C. Zheng T.S. Flavell R.A. Melief C.J.M. Peter M.E. Offringa R. Krammer P.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 3492-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although caspase-8 is not a preferred substrate processed by GrB in vitro, the zymogen might be accessible to GrB in vivo. This possibility was examined by evaluating proteolysis of caspase-8 in MCFnull and MCF caspase 3+ cells. Caspase-8 was not processed in MCFnull cells during the time-course studied (Fig.5 a). However, cleavage of caspase-8 was detectable at 2 h in the MCF caspase-3+ line (Fig.5 b). Correspondingly, the onset of processing of caspase-8 in cytosolic extract of MCFnull was apparent at 1 h by a decrease in the intensity of the zymogen band (Fig. 5 c). These results demonstrate that caspase-8 indeed is processed in cells undergoing GrB-mediated apoptosis, but proteolysis occurs only in the presence of activated caspase-3. We also considered the possibility that GrB might activate the cascade through caspase-9 by a direct action on mitochondria, which appears to be an important initiating event in apoptosis triggered, for example, by genotoxic damage (31Reed J.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Using the strategy described above, processing of caspase-9 in the presence and absence of caspase-3 was examined after intracellular delivery of GrB. Although no processing was observed in MCFnull cells during the time-course (Fig.6 a), for cells expressing caspase-3, the zymogen of caspase-9 (48 kDa) was converted to a 36-kDa form at 30 min with the large subunit faintly visible at 1 h (Fig.6 b). The 36-kDa product is consistent with cleavage at Asp330 (D330, caspase-9 numbering) (32Srinivasula S.M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Zangrillia J. Robertson N. Armstrong R.C. Wang L. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27099-27106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Because caspase-9 is a relatively poor substrate for GrB, the caspase-9 zymogen was not cleaved in cytosolic extract derived from MCF-7null cells (Fig.6 c). Therefore, similar to caspase-8, caspase-9 is processed in GrB-treated cells, but proteolysis is dependent on the presence of active caspase-3. Because GrB shares a primary specificity for Asp with caspases, the serine protease might initiate the caspase pathway by signaling activation of an apical caspase, by imitating an apical caspase or by posing as an executioner. We focused on caspase-7 as a point of reference in the cascade, because unlike most family members, the propeptide of the zymogen is removed first in vivo. This signature is readily identified in immunoblotted cells undergoing GrB-induced, as well as Fas receptor-dependent, and tumor necrosis factor-mediated apoptosis. Using recombinant procaspase-7 to examine the role of proteases in the processing of this caspasein vitro and our newly described MCF cell lines to analyze the pattern of cleavage events in vivo, we have been able to test whether caspase-3 and/or caspase-10 were proximal elements of the cascade initiated by the granzyme and to assess the accessibility of procaspase-7 to processing by GrB. The granzyme first activates caspase-3 even though this substrate is not the most preferred member of the death protease family. Caspase-3 then cleaves the N-peptide of procaspase-7 making it accessible to activation by the granzyme. Because GrB processes many different caspases in vitro, the granzyme has been regarded as a polyspecific activator of the caspase cascade in vivo. The inability of the granzyme to directly process caspase-7, -8, -9, and -10, as well as caspase-6 (data not shown) in the absence of caspase-3, was an unexpected finding indicating that a single GrB-induced pathway may exist for cytotoxic cell-mediated activation of this death pathway. We have established that GrB functions like an apical caspase in an undescribed two-step process where accessibility to proteolysis contributes to the sequence in which the two executioner caspases are matured by the granzyme. Our unanticipated observation raises an intriguing question: why is caspase-7 compartmentalized to prevent activation by GrB but is freely activated by caspase-3? Because procaspase-7 is only processed by GrB after detergent extraction of the MCF-7null cells (see Fig. 3 b), the zymogen appears to be located in an inaccessible vesicular compartment. Others have observed, based on cell fractionation studies, that procaspase-7 is compartmentalized to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (33Chandler J.M. Cohen G.M. MacFarlane M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10815-10818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) further supporting a physical separation of apical and executioner caspases. Although it is unclear whether the compartmentalization of caspase-7 is physical and/or biochemical, the sequestration of the executioner caspase-7 provides a previously undefined level of regulation in this enzymatic cascade. As a consequence of this sequestration, two distinct proteases are required for proper maturation of caspase-7. Using the MCF-7 sublines treated with tumor necrosis factor, caspase-8 appears to function similarly to the granzyme (34Stennicke H.R. Jurngensmeier J.M. Shin H. Wolf B. Yang X. Zhou Q. Ellerby H.M. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D.E. Green D.R. Reed J.C. Froelich C.J. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27084-27090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). These results may define a common mechanism shared by the granzyme and apical caspases (-2, -8, -9, and -10) to process the executioners (Fig. 7). Subsequently, uninvolved apical caspases may be activated in a process that serves to amplify the portion of the cascade that converges at caspase-3 underscoring the central role of this protease in producing cell death. Further studies of the proteolytic signal delivered from the apical to executioner caspases must take into account the different locations and intracellular trafficking patterns of the various family members in the cell as well as the efficiency that a particular caspase trans-activates another. We thank Dr. Vishva Dixit for kindly providing the anti-caspase-3 and -7 antibodies plus the construct for caspase-3. We also especially appreciate receipt of the caspase-3/-10-deficient MCF-7 line from Dr. David Boothman."

Circulation. 1997; 95: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) observed that cGMP-elevating agents decreased DNA synthesis and proliferation of epidermal growth factor-stimulated vascular SMC. The effects of cGMP on both DNA synthesis and cell proliferation were inhibited by the selective PKG inhibitor KT5823 (21Yu S.M. Hung L.M. Lin C.C. Circulation. 1997; 95: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These results differ from those of Cornwell et al. (24Cornwell T.L. Arnold E. Boerth N.J. Lincoln T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1405-C1413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who reported that NO and cGMP inhibited proliferation of cultured rat aortic SMC (RASMC) via a mechanism mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and not by PKG. Similarly, the role of NO in the induction of the apoptotic cell death program has been extensively studied (9Pollman M.J. Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Gibbons G.H. Circ.

NO appears to be a bifunctional modulator of cell death capable of either inhibiting or stimulating apoptosis depending on the cell type and the concentration of NO applied. Several investigators reported that high concentrations of NO donor compounds induce apoptosis in vascular SMC (9Pollman M.J. Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Gibbons G.H. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 748-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 10Nishio E. Fukushima K. Shiozaki M. Watanabe Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Acta. 1997; 1359: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, experiments designed to determine the role of cGMP in the activation of programmed SMC death yielded conflicting results (9Pollman M.J. Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Gibbons G.H. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 748-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 10Nishio E. Fukushima K. Shiozaki M. Watanabe Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Acta. 1997; 1359: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because PKG expression rapidly decreases as vascular SMC are passaged in culture (32Lincoln T.M. Komalavilas P. Cornwell T.L. Hypertension (Dallas). 1994; 23: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 33Cornwell T.L. Soff G.A. Traynor A.E. Lincoln T.M. J. Vasc. Res. 1994; 31: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the contribution of PKG to the modulation of vascular SMC proliferation and apoptosis by NO donor compounds and cGMP analogues is likely to be underestimated. To further investigate the role of PKG in the regulation of the balance between SMC proliferation and apoptotic SMC death, we used adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to increase PKG activity in cultured rat pulmonary artery SMC (RPaSMC). We report that augmentation of PKG activity in RPaSMC, using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, inhibited proliferation induced by serum supplementation and increased apoptosis associated with serum deprivation. Moreover, PKG gene transfer increased the sensitivity of vascular SMC to the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of NO and cGMP. These investigations were approved by the Subcommittee for Research Animal Studies at the Massachusetts General Hospital. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma, exceptS-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), which was obtained from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA), and the protein kinase inhibitors KT5823 and KT5720, which were purchased from Calbiochem. A polymerase chain reaction was performed to amplify a PKG cDNA from reverse-transcribed rat brain mRNA using degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to amino acids 1–4 and 105–110 shared by bovine and human PKG-Iβ isoforms: 5′-CCGAATTCAGGAGCATGGGCACCYTGCG-3′ and 5′-CCGGATCCTTTATRAGATCCTTGGA-3′ (34Sambrook J.

FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction product was ligated into pUC18, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. To obtain a human PKG-Iβ cDNA, a λgt11 cDNA library prepared from human placenta (CLONTECH) was screened using a32P-labeled EcoRI-BamHI restriction fragment of the rat PKG-Iβ cDNA. One cDNA insert from a hybridizing bacteriophage contained sequences identical to nucleotides 22–900 of the sequence for human PKG-Iβ (36Sandberg M. Natarajan V. Ronander I. Kalderon D. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. Jahnsen T. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This cDNA was used to re-screen the library, resulting in the isolation of a second cDNA insert containing sequences identical to amino acids 430–3740 of the human PKG-Iβ sequence. The two inserts were ligated atNcoI to produce a human PKG-Iβ cDNA specifying the full-length protein. The PKG-Iβ cDNA was subcloned into pRc/RSV (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The EcoRI-BglII restriction fragment of pRc/RSV.PKG was ligated into the NotI and BamHI sites of the vector pAd.RSV4 (kindly provided by Dr. B. Davidson, University of Iowa), which contains the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat as a promoter and the SV40 polyadenylation signal, using a linker encoding the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) behind a translation start site (5′-GGCCGCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAA-3′ and 5′-AATTTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCCATGC-3′) (37Chubet R.G. Brizzard B.L. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid vector (pAd.RSV4.PKG) was cotransfected into 293 cells with pJM17 (generously provided by Dr. F. Graham, McMaster University) (38McGrory W.J. Bautista D.S. Graham F.L. Virology. 1988; 163: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Homologous recombinants containing the PKG-Iβ cDNA substituted for E1 were detected using RNA blot hybridization. The recombinant adenovirus Ad.PKG was expanded, purified, and titered in 293 cells as described previously (39Graham F.L. Prevec L. Murray E.J. Gene Transfer and Expression Protocols. Humana Press, Inc., Clifton, NJ1991: 109-128Google Scholar). Two additional recombinant adenoviruses were used as controls: Ad.GFP, which specifies the EGFP mutant of the green fluorescent protein (40Hajjar R.J. Schmidt U. Matsui T. Guerrero L. Lee K.H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29969-29977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The titer of viral stocks used for these studies was 2 × 1010 plaque-forming units (pfu)/ml (Ad.PKG), 1 × 1010 pfu/ml (Ad.GFP), and 4 × 1010 pfu/ml (Ad.βgal), with particle/pfu ratios of 35:1, 45:1, and 38:1, respectively. Contamination of viral stocks with replication-competent adenoviruses was excluded by the absence of cytopathic effect after infection of a monolayer of A549 lung carcinoma cells with viral stocks (20 pfu/cell) and by the failure to amplify a 200-base pair fragment of the E1 region using polymerase chain reaction. Primary cultures of RPaSMC were prepared from explants of endothelium- and adventitia-stripped pulmonary arteries of adult Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (42Yu F.S. Lee S.L. Lanzillo J.J. Fanburg B.L. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1989; 138: 1144-1148Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). RPaSMC were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% NuSerum (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA), penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells were used between passages 3 and 10. RPaSMC were plated at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/dish in 60-mm culture dishes and infected with Ad.PKG using multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.) ranging from 50 to 500 pfu/cell for 2 h. After removal of the virus suspension, cells were incubated for 48 h and then harvested in PEM buffer containing protease inhibitors (0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin), 2 mm EDTA, 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mmKH2PO4, pH 6.8. The cell suspension was homogenized and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants of centrifuged cell extracts (15 μg) were fractionated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Micron Separations, Westborough, MA). Filters were blocked at room temperature for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 5% nonfat dry milk (PBS/milk) and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with an anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) diluted in PBS/milk at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. After washing, the blots were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:5000 in PBS/milk. Proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposure to x-ray film. RPaSMC were plated on four-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) and infected with Ad.PKG (m.o.i. = 50–500 pfu/cell). The virus suspension was removed 2 h after infection, and cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium with 0.1% NuSerum. After 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 days, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 5% sucrose for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed in PBS, treated with 1% SDS in PBS, washed in PBS, and incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. After washing in PBS, cells were incubated with the anti-FLAG M2 antibody in PBS (6 μg/ml) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (1 h at room temperature) and subsequently with Cy3-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) diluted in PBS to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. Slides were examined immediately after preparation using a fluorescence photomicroscope. Specificity of the immunostaining was ascertained using uninfected cells and cells infected with Ad.βgal as well as by incubation without the primary antibody. The percentage of cells expressing the transgene at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 days after infection was determined. To assess the biological activity of the transgene product, PKG enzyme activity was measured in RPaSMC infected with Ad.PKG using methods described previously (43Francis S.H. Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 106cells were infected with Ad.PKG (m.o.i. = 50–500 pfu/cell). After 48 h, cells were harvested and homogenized in 0.3 ml of PEM buffer before centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. After determination of the protein concentration using a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad), the supernatants (10 μl) of centrifuged cell extracts were assayed in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 20 μm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 μm ATP, a custom-synthesized peptide RKISASEF (136 μg/ml) (Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc., The Woodlands, TX) (44Colbran J.L.

Assays were conducted in the absence or presence of 10 μm cGMP at 30 °C for 10 min and were terminated by transferring samples onto phosphocellulose P-81 paper (Whatman) and washing in 75 mm phosphoric acid. Papers were then washed once in ethanol and dried. Radiolabeled peptide bound to the phosphocellulose paper was quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. PKG enzyme activity is expressed as nanomoles of peptide phosphorylated per min/mg of cell extract protein. RPaSMC were plated in 96-well plates (103cells/well) and infected with Ad.PKG or Ad.GFP (m.o.i. = 50–200 pfu/cell). After 2 h, the viral suspension was removed, and cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% NuSerum for 48 h to achieve a quiescent state. The culture medium was subsequently replaced with RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1 or 4% NuSerum supplemented with 8-Br-cGMP, GSNO, 8-Br-cAMP, KT5823, or KT5720 or combinations of these reagents. After 24 h, the media and reagents were replaced in each well, and [3H]thymidine (NEN Life Science Products) was added to a final concentration of 1 μCi/ml. After 12 h, cells were dissociated from the culture dishes using trypsin, and radiolabeled DNA was transferred to micro-glass-fiber filters (Cambridge Technology, Inc., Watertown, MA) using a PHD cell harvester (Cambridge Technology Inc.). Filters were then washed and dried, and [3H]thymidine-labeled DNA was quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. For each experiment, 8–12 wells were used for each experimental condition, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured in duplicate for each well. RPaSMC were plated in six-well plates (2 × 104cells/well) and infected with Ad.PKG or Ad.GFP (m.o.i. = 200 pfu/cell). The virus suspension was removed 2 h after infection, and cells were growth-arrested in RPMI 1640 medium with 0.1% NuSerum for 48 h. Cells were then incubated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1 or 4% NuSerum in the absence or presence of 1 mm 8-Br-cGMP. For each experimental condition, cells from three wells were harvested with trypsin and counted with a hemocytometer at days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion, and the number of cells floating in the culture medium was determined daily. The DNA-binding dye Hoechst H33258 was used to define nuclear chromatin morphology as a quantitative index of apoptosis within the cell culture system. RPaSMC were plated on four-well chamber slides (2 × 104 cells/well) and infected with Ad.PKG or Ad.GFP (m.o.i. = 200 pfu/cell). The virus suspension was removed 2 h after infection, and cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% NuSerum during 48 h. The culture medium was replaced and supplemented with 8-Br-cGMP, GSNO, or KT5823 or combinations of these reagents. After 24 h, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 5% sucrose, washed in PBS, incubated in 95% ethanol (3 min), and stained with H33258 (1 μg/ml) before examination by fluorescence microscopy. Apoptosis was defined by the presence of nuclear chromatin condensation or nuclear fragmentation. To quantify apoptosis, 300 nuclei from each of five random microscopic fields were analyzed by an observer blinded as to the treatment group. The percentage of apoptotic nuclei was calculated as the ratio of apoptotic nuclei to total nuclei. To analyze the pattern of DNA fragmentation, RPaSMC were cultured in 10-cm dishes (1 × 106 cells/plate), infected with Ad.PKG or Ad.GFP (m.o.i. = 200 pfu/cell), and incubated under low serum conditions. Forty-eight h after infection, the cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% NuSerum in the absence or presence of 8-Br-cGMP (1 mm) for 24 h. Subsequently, adherent cells were detached from the culture dishes with trypsin and pooled with cells floating in the supernatant. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed in PBS, and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in lysis buffer containing 100 mmTris, pH 8.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 200 mmNaCl, and 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K. The genomic DNA was precipitated with 700 μl of isopropyl alcohol, resuspended in Tris/EDTA buffer, and extracted with phenol and chloroform before precipitation in the presence of 3 m sodium acetate and ethanol. After treatment with RNase (12.5 μg/ml for 1 h at 37 °C), DNA was quantitated by measuring the absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. DNA samples (1 μg) were subsequently labeled using [α-32P]dCTP and Exo− Klenow polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and fractionated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography for 2 h at −70 °C. Each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times. Data are presented as the means ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's t test for post hoc analysis. To compare the rate of proliferation of vascular SMC for each treatment group, logarithmic transformation of cell counts (n) was performed, and the slopes of the linear relationship fitting log(n) as a function of time were compared using analysis of covariance. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. To augment PKG enzyme activity in vascular SMC in culture, we used a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus encoding the human PKG-Iβ isoform. A FLAG epitope was encoded at the amino terminus to facilitate transgene detection. To determine whether increased levels of PKG protein could be achieved in cultured SMC using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, RPaSMC were infected with increasing concentrations of Ad.PKG (m.o.i. = 50, 100, 200, and 500 pfu/cell), and the expression of the recombinant PKG protein was measured by immunoblotting. Forty-eight h after infection, expression of PKG was detectable in cell extracts from RPaSMC infected at m.o.i. = 50 pfu/cell and increased in a m.o.i.-dependent manner (Fig.1). The recombinant protein was detectable as early as 24 h, peaked at 48 h, and persisted for 7 days after infection (data not shown). To confirm that the FLAG peptide did not interfere with the biological activity of the transgene product, PKG activity was measured in cell extracts from RPaSMC infected with Ad.PKG (m.o.i. = 0–500 pfu/cell). As shown in Fig. 1, adenovirus-mediated PKG gene transfer at m.o.i. = 100 resulted in a significant increase in basal PKG activity. cGMP-stimulated activity was markedly increased in cell extracts from RPaSMC infected at m.o.i. ≥ 50. Transduction at m.o.i. = 200 resulted in a cGMP-stimulated PKG activity of ∼4.7 nmol/min/mg of protein, which is similar to the activity measured in extracts of freshly isolated RASMC (45Cornwell T.L. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1146-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in intact rat pulmonary arteries (data not shown). Infection of SMC with a control adenovirus (Ad.βgal) did not affect PKG activity. To identify the m.o.i. required to infect the majority of vascular SMC in culture, RPaSMC were incubated with Ad.PKG at various m.o.i., and 48 h later, the percentage of cells containing PKG was determined by immunocytochemical techniques using an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody. FLAG immunoreactivity was detected in 30, 50, and 100% of RPaSMC infected with Ad.PKG at 50, 100 and 200 pfu"
https://openalex.org/W1971602494,"Nitric oxide (NO) is implicated in apoptosis and has both cytotoxic and cytoprotective effects. Exogenous NO induced the death of PC12 and HeLa cells via a process showing features of both apoptosis and necrosis, with chromatin condensation, nuclear compaction, and mitochondrial swelling. Activation of caspases was not observed during NO-induced cell death. In addition, cell death was not inhibited by peptide caspase inhibitors or by expression ofp35, a baculovirus-encoded caspase inhibitor, indicating that NO-induced cell death was independent of caspases. NO-induced cell death was enhanced by Bax expression in a caspase-independent manner and prevented by the anti-cell death protein Bcl-2.

Med. 1997; 185: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar), common mediators of apoptosis (11Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). So far, more than 10 caspases have been identified in mammals. Apoptosis is also regulated by Bcl-2 family proteins, including anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, and pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bak (12Merry D.E. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 245-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that Bcl-2 acts upstream of caspase activation to prevent apoptosis (13Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2251-2257PubMed Google Scholar,14Chinnaiyan A.M. Orth K. Orouke K. Duan H. Poirier G.G. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4573-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed NO-induced cell death, particularly focusing on the role of caspases as well as the influence of apoptosis-regulating molecules such as Bcl-2 family proteins. Caspase inhibitors and substrates were purchased from Peptide Inc. (Minoh, Japan). Other chemicals were purchased from Wako Chemical Co. (Tokyo, Japan). HeLa cells, a human cervical carcinoma-derived cell line, and PC12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line, were maintained in RPMI 1640 culture medium, as described elsewhere (15Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Itoh Y. Hasegawa J. Yamabe K. Otsuki H. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2161-2166PubMed Google Scholar). A stable transfectant of PC12 cells expressing mouse Bax (designated as PC12-Bax) was obtained by infecting retrovirus that was produced from the packaging cell line Ψ2 transfected with the retroviral vector pBC140 (15Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Itoh Y. Hasegawa J. Yamabe K. Otsuki H. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2161-2166PubMed Google Scholar) containing mouse bax cDNA. A stable transfectant of PC12 cells expressing human Bcl-2 (designated as PC12-Bcl-2) was obtained by transfecting the pUC-CAGGS vector bearing the human bcl-2 cDNA using electroporation (13Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2251-2257PubMed Google Scholar). Empty vector-transduced cells were used as the controls (designated as PC12-pBC-V and PC12-CAGGS-V, respectively). PC12 and HeLa cell derivatives were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm Hepes/Na+ (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 0.05 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were shaded at 2 × 105 cells in a 6-cm plastic dish 1 day before the experiment, and cell death was induced by addition of nitric oxide donor (SNAP) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into media at the indicated concentrations. In experiments using caspase inhibitors, these drugs were added 2 h before the addition of SNAP or H2O2 into medium. For electron microscopy, PC12 cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 30 min at 4 °C. After three rinses with the same buffer containing 7.5% sucrose, cells were postfixed for 1 h with 1% OsO4, and stained with a 2% aqueous solution of uranyl acetate for 1 h. Then cells were dehydrated and embedded in Epon 812. Serial sections were cut using an Ultracut-N (Reichert-Nissei, Hitachi), stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observed under a Hitachi H-7100 electron microscope. For fluorescent microscopy, PC12 cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 (10 μm) and propidium iodide (10 μm) for 10 min and then examined under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BHS-RFL-LSM) with excitation at 360 nm, as described previously (15Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Itoh Y. Hasegawa J. Yamabe K. Otsuki H. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2161-2166PubMed Google Scholar). Cell death was quantitated by counting 1,000 cells. For staining of apoptotic cells by DNA end labeling (TUNEL), cells were fixed in 4% neutral buffered formalin, treated with proteinase K (20 mg/ml) for 15 min at 25 °C, and then stained using ApoptagTM (Oncor). Cell death was also quantitated by counting 1,000 cells. HeLa cells were treated with 500 μm SNAP or 1 mm H2O2and suspended in phosphate buffer at the indicated times. After centrifugation, cell pellets were lysed with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 20 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 100 mm NaCl. After boiling, 40 μg of total protein was analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-human caspase-3 monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories), which reacted with procaspase-3 (p32) and a large subunit of active caspase-3 with prodomain (p20). Caspase activity was measured as described elsewhere (13Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2251-2257PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were suspended in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm EGTA, and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence of 10 mm digitonin. The cleared lysates (containing 40 μg protein) or recombinant caspase-3 and caspase-6 (10 ng protein each) were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 75 nmol of the enzyme substrates YVAD-MCA, DEVD-MCA, and VEID-MCA. The release of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) was measured using a Hitachi F-3000 spectrophotometer with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 460 nm. One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 pmol of AMC per min at 37 °C. His6-tagged caspase-3 and -6 proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain XL/C and purified by affinity chromatography on a nickel column (Invitrogen). Fractions showing proteolytic activity (assessed as described above) were pooled and dialyzed with buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, 0.1 m NaCl, and 10% glycerol (pH 7.5) to remove imidazole. The caspases thus obtained were more than 80% pure, as judged by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Mousebax (5.7-kb), human bcl-2 (6.0-kb), andp35 (5.8-kb) expression plasmids were constructed by inserting the respective cDNA fragment containing the entire coding region into pUC-CAGGS. Using LipofectAMINE, HeLa cells were transfected for 24 h with each expression plasmid (total 1.0 μg) together with 0.3 μg of the 8.5-kb lacZ expression construct. Transfected cells were incubated with or without 500 μm SNAP or 1 mm H2O2 for 12 h. Then the cells were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde for 5 min, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with X-gal buffer for 6 h at 37 °C. The extent of cell death was calculated as the percentage of shrunken blue cells relative to all blue cells (16Hasegawa J. Kamada S. Kamiike W. Shimizu S. Imazu T. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1713-1718PubMed Google Scholar). We first examined the morphological characteristics of NO-induced cell death using fluorescence microscopy after staining with Hoechst 33342 (Ho342) and propidium iodide (PI). As described previously (15Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Itoh Y. Hasegawa J. Yamabe K. Otsuki H. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2161-2166PubMed Google Scholar), viable cells showed round blue nuclei stained with Ho342, necrotic cells showed round pink nuclei stained with both Ho342 and PI, and apoptotic cells showed blue or pink shrunken or fragmented nuclei. Without any treatment, almost all PC12 cells showed round blue nuclei (Fig.1 a), indicating that these cells were viable. After treatment for 24 h with an NO donor, S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine (SNAP; 500 μm), PC12 cells with blue or pink shrunken nuclei emerged (Fig. 1 b). NO-treated but not intact PC12 cells were positively stained with TUNEL assay (Fig. 1, c andd), indicating NO-treated PC12 cells showed apoptotic manifestations. Electron micrographs of NO-treated PC12 cells also showed evidence of apoptosis, such as chromatin condensation and compaction of nuclei, together with features of necrosis such as mitochondrial disruption (Fig. 1 e). Similar morphological findings were also observed in NO-treated HeLa cells (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1, f and g, the proportion of dead PC12 cells increased over time in a concentration-dependent manner as assessed by Hoechst-PI staining and TUNEL assay. Similar results were obtained when HeLa cells were treated with SNAP (Fig. 1, h and i), or were treated with another NO donor, 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) (data not shown). These findings indicated that NO induced the unique form of death of PC12 and HeLa cells that was accompanied by apoptotic and necrotic manifestations. This is in contrast to the previous reports that NO induces apoptosis (17Brockhaus F. Brüne B. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 18Leist M. Volbracht C. Kuhnle S. Fava E. Ferrandy M.E. Nicotera P. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 750-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and as described below, the difference might be because of the cell line used. Caspases play a crucial role in driving apoptosis (11Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). Treatment of PC12 cells with apoptotic stimuli such as H2O2 (Fig.2 a), VP16, and calcium ionophore (data not shown) resulted in the activation of caspase-3-like protease, a major executioner caspase, and addition of 200 μm of a peptide caspase-3 inhibitor (DEVD-CHO) or a broad caspase inhibitor (z-D-CH2-DCB) blocked the activation of caspase-3 and prevented cell death (Fig. 2, a andd), confirming previous observations that caspase-3-like proteases is directly involved in various forms of apoptosis. In contrast, activity of caspase-3 as well as caspase-1 and -6 was undetectable during NO-induced cell death (Fig. 2 a and data not shown). Similar results were also obtained with HeLa cells (Fig.2 b), and, consistently, processing of caspase-3 to the active form was not detected (Fig. 2 c). The lack of significant inhibition of NO-induced cell death by all peptide caspase inhibitors tested (including DEVD-CHO, z-D-CH2-DCB, as described, and YVAD-CHO and VEID-CHO: inhibitors of caspase-1 and caspase-6, respectively, data not shown), indicated that NO-induced cell death was independent of caspases. These findings raised two mutually exclusive possibilities: (1Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar) caspases are not involved in NO-induced cell death, or (2Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar) caspases are involved, but are significantly inhibited by NO as described previously (8Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Effective inhibition of caspase-3 and caspase-6 by NO was confirmed using the respective recombinant caspases (Fig.3).Figure 3Inhibition of caspase activity by NO.Recombinant caspase-3 (a) and -6 (b) proteins were incubated with the substrates DEVD-MCA and VEID-MCA, respectively, for 1 h with SNAP at the indicated concentrations. Then the caspase-3 and -6 activities were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further confirm the absence of caspase activation in NO-induced cell death, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a p35 (a baculovirus broad caspase inhibitory gene) (19Xue D. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1995; 377: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 20Bump N.J. Hackett M. Hugunin M. Seshagiri S. Brady K. Chen P. Ferenz C. Franklin S. Ghayur T. Li P. Licari P.

Science. 1995; 269: 1885-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) expression construct or vector plasmid (as a control) together with the lacZ expression plasmid, and were treated with 500 μm SNAP. Light microscopy of cells stained with X-gal revealed viable cells as flat and blue, whereas apoptotic cells were round and blue. As shown in Fig. 4, a and b,NO-induced cell death was not prevented by transient expression ofp35, although this significantly prevented H2O2-induced apoptosis. These results also suggested that NO-induced cell death was independent of caspase activation. To further characterize NO-induced cell death, we next examined the influence of two Bcl-2 family proteins, Bax and Bcl-2. Several observations have suggested that Bax induces either caspase-dependent or -independent apoptosis (21Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 22Miller T.M. Moulder K.L. Knudson C.M. Creedon D.J. Deshmukh M. Korsmeyer S.J. Johnson Jr, E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Bax-overexpressing PC12 cells (PC12-Bax) showed significantly increased susceptibility to NO-induced cell death (Fig.5 a). No activity of caspases-1, -3, and -6 was observed during NO-induced death (Fig.5 b and data not shown). Furthermore, addition of 200 μm z-D-CH2-DCB could not prevent NO-induced cell death of PC12-Bax cells (Fig. 5 a), indicating that Bax accelerated NO-induced cell death through a mechanism other than caspase activation. To further confirm the absence of caspase activation in the enhancement of NO-induced cell death by Bax, transient transfection with the bax and p35 genes was performed using HeLa cells. In the absence of SNAP, transient expression of bax resulted in apoptosis that was significantly inhibited by coexpression of p35 (Fig.5 d), indicating that p35 preventedbax-induced apoptosis in the absence of SNAP. In contrast, transient expression of bax enhanced NO-induced cell death, and death was not inhibited by coexpression of p35 (Fig. 5,c and d), indicating that the enhancement of NO-induced cell death by Bax occurred via a pathway independent of caspase activation. Because Bcl-2 has been shown to prevent cell death by blocking activation of the caspase cascade (13Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2251-2257PubMed Google Scholar, 14Chinnaiyan A.M. Orth K. Orouke K. Duan H. Poirier G.G. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4573-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), and we found that Bax, a Bcl-2 antagonist, enhanced NO-induced cell death, it was of a great interest to determine whether NO-induced cell death was inhibited by Bcl-2. As shown in Fig.6 a, overexpression of Bcl-2 efficiently prevented NO-induced death of PC12 cells, which did not involve caspase activation as described above. Consistent with this finding, transient expression of bcl-2 also prevented NO-induced cell death (Figs. 6, b and c), whereasp35 expression could not prevent it (Fig. 5 d). These results indicated that Bcl-2 prevented NO-induced cell death independent of the caspase cascade, therefore suggesting that Bcl-2 has a unique activity that prevents cell death through a mechanism distinct from blocking caspase activation. In the present study, we showed that NO induced a unique form of death in PC12 and HeLa cells, that is accompanied by both apoptotic and necrotic manifestations and is independent of caspases. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that other caspases are involved, this is very unlikely because the cell death was not prevented byp35 that is known to inhibit caspase-1, -3, -6, -7, -8, and -10, 2Q. Zhou and G. Salvesen, personal communication. and by z-D-CH2-DCB that inhibits caspases broadly. Our observations are in contrast to the previous reports that NO can induce caspase-dependent apoptosis (17Brockhaus F. Brüne B. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 18Leist M. Volbracht C. Kuhnle S. Fava E. Ferrandy M.E. Nicotera P. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 750-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or inhibit apoptosis (8Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 9Mannick J.B. Asano K. Izumi K. Kieff E. Stamler J.S.

Invest. 1995; 95: 1884-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The discrepancy might be because of the difference in susceptibility of cell lines used to apoptosis as well as caspase-independent cell death. It might be that for cell lines highly susceptible to apoptosis, a small amount of NO that is insufficient to inhibit caspases to trigger apoptosis. In contrast, for cell lines less susceptible to cell death, higher concentrations of NO, which are sufficient to inhibit caspases, might be required to induce a caspase-independent death or might inhibit apoptosis in general through inhibition of caspases. Although apoptotic hallmarks such as chromatin condensation and nuclear compaction were observed in NO-induced cell death, other apoptotic features like nuclear fragmentation and oligonucleosomal cleavage of genomic DNA were not observed (Fig. 1 e and data not shown). The absence of nuclear fragmentation and DNA ladder formation was probably a consequence of direct caspase inhibition, because nuclear fragmentation and DNA laddering are caspase-dependent (23Orth K.

Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2807) Google Scholar). Interestingly, NO-induced cell death described here morphologically resembled Bax-induced apoptosis in the presence of a caspase inhibitor (21Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Given the findings that overexpression of Bax enhanced NO-induced apoptosis without caspase activation (Fig. 5), and previous observations that Bax-induced apoptosis occurs via both caspase-dependent and -independent pathways (21Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 22Miller T.M. Moulder K.L. Knudson C.M. Creedon D.J. Deshmukh M. Korsmeyer S.J. Johnson Jr, E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), NO-induced apoptosis might be mediated by Bax through a mechanism other than the caspase activation pathway. The anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-2 has already been extensively analyzed. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how Bcl-2 prevents apoptosis, including (1Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev.

All these mechanisms suggest that anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 acts upstream of caspases to inhibit their activation. In the present study, we showed that Bcl-2 prevented cell death occurring independently of the caspase cascade, indicating that Bcl-2 may have the ability to block cell death occurring by a mechanism other than those described above. Taken together, our results suggested that NO-induced cell death is mediated via a pathway independent of caspase activation, and that NO-induced apoptosis was enhanced or prevented by Bax or Bcl-2, respectively.

The initiation of chromosomal DNA replication in all free-living organisms is a two-stage process that first involves assembly of the initiation machinery at specific sequences called the origin of DNA replication (see Ref. 1Baker T.A. Bell S.P. Cell. 1998; 92: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar for a recent review). Once formed, the initiation complex then assembles proteins that act at the replication fork for semiconservative DNA synthesis. In the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, origin sequences are targeted by the six-member origin recognition complex (ORC).1 ORC in a prereplication complex is then recognized by Cdc6 protein, Cdc45 protein, and minichromosome maintenance proteins (reviewed in Ref. 2Dutta A. Bell S.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 293-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The initiation complex is somehow activated by cyclin-dependent kinases and Cdc7-Dbf4 protein kinase, leading to the import of required proteins at the replication forks and DNA synthesis. In Escherichia coli, DnaA protein is the functional counterpart to ORC in that it recognizes specific sequences in the replication origin, oriC. Once bound, it directs formation of the initiation complex through a series of discrete steps. First, it induces a local distortion of an AT-rich region near the left boundary of oriC to form an intermediate, the open complex, in an ATP-dependent process that is assisted by either HU or IHF (3Bramhill D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Processive DNA synthesis also requires single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) and DNA gyrase to relieve positive superhelicity ahead of the replication fork. In the above sequence of events, the entry of DnaB protein atoriC is an important step in the initiation process because this protein is required for bidirectional replication fork movement. How this occurs is poorly understood and limited to the following observations. First, DnaB protein does not bind efficiently to single-stranded DNA bound by SSB (10Arai K. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4308-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). At oriC, DnaA protein induces strand opening in the AT-rich region near the left boundary (3Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) and also binds to DnaB (11Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One model is that DnaA somehow directs the entry of DnaB from the DnaB-DnaC complex to the unwound region covered by SSB so that the helicase is appropriately bound for bidirectional fork movement. Recent UV cross-linking studies have shown that DnaC protein can be covalently coupled to ssDNA (12Learn B.A. Um S.J. Huang L. McMacken R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1154-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), suggesting the added participation of DnaC at this step. An important issue is to determine the molecular mechanism whereby DnaB protein enters at oriCto establish the replication forks. This may have relevance to the loading of the replicative helicase at replication origins in the eukaryotic cell. The eukaryotic DnaB counterpart has not been identified. We recently described a large collection of novel dnaAalleles (13Sutton M.D. Kaguni J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 14Sutton M.D. Kaguni J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 546-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Their genetic and biochemical characterization indicates four functionally distinct domains. One is a nucleotide binding domain carrying a phosphate binding loop (P-loop) within a predicted secondary structure reminiscent of a Rossmann fold. The second is a region that we speculate is involved in interaction with pSC101-encoded RepA protein. The third is involved in DNA binding. The fourth functional domain is represented by missense mutations clustered near the N terminus. These alleles encode proteins that are inactive in DNA replication. The function of this region until now was uncertain. We previously thought that the region may participate in oligomerization, because missense mutations that reside in this region were active in DNA binding, but were partially defective in transcriptional repression from the dnaA promoter (14Sutton M.D. Kaguni J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 546-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For DnaA protein to autoregulate its expression, the binding of several protomers to DnaA box sequences in the dnaA regulatory region is required that is speculated to involve oligomerization (15Lee Y.S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 83-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This report examines further the function of the N-terminal domain in initiation of DNA replication. Biochemical characterization of deletion mutants lacking this N-terminal region (DnaAΔ62 and DnaAΔ129 lacking residues 1–62 and 1–129, respectively) revealed that the mutant proteins were active in binding to ATP and to an oriCfragment. The inactivity in DNA replication was due to a defect in forming a replication intermediate termed the prepriming complex. Its formation requires the binding of DnaB from the DnaB-DnaC complex to DnaA protein bound to a DnaA box in a hairpin structure in a single-stranded DNA. The defect was not in the binding to DnaB as measured by surface plasmon resonance. Because several molecules of DnaA protein are bound to a single DnaA box, 2K. M. Carr and J. M. Kaguni, unpublished results. we speculate that DnaA protein monomers assemble at this site to form a unique nucleoprotein structure in which the N-terminal region acts to stabilize DnaB. Monomeric DnaA+, DnaAΔ62, DnaAΔ129 (16Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and DnaAΔ219 (17Sutton M.D. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23017-23024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) were purified as described in the respective references from E. coliHMS174(DE3) recA hsdR (rK-12−mK-12+) Rifr (DE3) (F−) (Novagen, Inc.) transformed, respectively, with pKC596 carrying thednaA + gene, pKCdnaAΔ62, pKCdnaAΔ129, or pKCdnaAΔ219 (17Sutton M.D. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23017-23024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The latter plasmids were derived from pKC596 (16Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and overproduce truncated forms of DnaA protein lacking the N-terminal 62- (DnaAΔ62), 129- (DnaAΔ129), or 219-amino acid residues (DnaAΔ219). Their purity (≥95% for DnaAΔ129) and concentration relative to a standard curve derived from bovine serum albumin were determined by scanning densitometry of a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel using a Gel Doc 1000 unit (Bio-Rad) equipped with the Molecular Analyst software. All preparations of purified DnaAΔ62 contained a smaller polypeptide (∼35% by mass based on automated Edman degradation, data not shown) whose N terminus corresponds to residue 89 and whose size is consistent with the C terminus at residue 467 of DnaA protein. The wild type protein is predicted to be 467 amino acids based on DNA sequence (18Ohmori H. Kimura M. Nagata T. Sakakibara Y. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 28: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19Hansen E.B. Hansen F.G. von Meyenburg K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 7373Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The presence of this polypeptide that we presume arose fromin vivo proteolysis was taken into account in determining the concentration of DnaAΔ62. Bacillus subtilis DnaA protein was a generous gift from Dr. Shigeki Moriya, Nara Institute of Science and Technology (Nara, Japan). Other replication proteins and DNAs have been described (11Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hwang D.S. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10633-10640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurements of the interaction of different forms of DnaA protein with DnaB protein were performed using the BIAcore Biosensor (Biacore AB). DnaB (600 resonance units) was immobilized on a CM5 research-grade sensor chip at 100 μg/ml in 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.8) using the carbodiimide covalent linkage method (Biacore AB). A blank surface was prepared by activating and inactivating a sensor chip without any protein immobilization. Measurements were performed at room temperature in 25 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 150 mM sodium chloride, 15% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.001% Tween 20 with a flow rate of 20 μl/min. All surfaces were washed with 100 mm HCl to remove noncovalently bound proteins. Among a collection of novel dnaA mutations that are defective in DNA replication activity in vivo (13Sutton M.D. Kaguni J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), one class is represented by missense mutations clustered near the N terminus encoding substitutions from amino acids 9–64 (Fig.1). To understand the function of this region, we examined two N-terminal deletions, DnaAΔ62 and DnaAΔ129 (lacking the N-terminal 62 and 129 residues, respectively), in severalin vitro DNA replication assays (Fig.2). Two assays measured replication activity with an oriC-containing plasmid. In one, required replication proteins were present in a crude protein fraction. In the other, purified replication proteins were used in a reconstituted replication system instead. A third assay measured replication activity with a single-stranded DNA bearing a DnaA box in a hairpin structure and purified replication proteins (21Masai H. Nomura N. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15134-15144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Nomura N. Masai H. Inuzuka M. Miyazaki C. Ohtsubo E. Itoh T. Sasamoto S. Matsui M. Ishizaki R. Arai K. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The mutant proteins were found to be inactive in each of the assays, indicating the essential nature of the N-terminal region (Fig. 2). Also, mixing experiments were performed in which mutant proteins were separately added to reactions and then a subsaturating level of wild type DnaA protein was added. In assays dependent on purified replication proteins, inhibition was observed in proportion to the amount of mutant protein added. However, in the assay dependent on the crude protein fraction, the mutant proteins were marginally inhibitory, possibly because of a protease that degrades the mutant protein.Figure 2DnaAΔ62 and DnaAΔ129 are defective in DNA replication. Assays to measure replication activity with the indicated amounts of DnaA+, DnaAΔ62, or DnaAΔ129 were performed with an oriC plasmid (M13oriC2LB5) and purified replication proteins but lacking RNA polymerase, RNase H, and topoisomerase I (panels A and B), with a crude enzyme fraction deficient in DnaA protein (panels C andD) or with M13 A-site ssDNA and purified replication proteins (panels E and F) as described in respective references (11Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Fuller R.S. Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7370-7374Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 53Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 183-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In panels B andD, the indicated amounts of DnaA+, DnaAΔ62, or DnaAΔ129 were added to reactions then incubated for 5 min on ice prior to addition of 0.6 or 0.8 pmol of DnaA+ protein in the respective panels. In panel F, the indicated amounts of mutant protein were added as above prior to addition of 0.1 pmol of DnaA+. DNA synthesis was then measured as trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactivity by liquid scintillation spectrometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Earlier studies identified a phosphate binding loop (P-loop) in DnaA protein that is strictly conserved among 25 dnaA homologs and participates in high affinity ATP binding required for replication activity (16Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 24Kaguni J.M. Mol. Cells. 1997; 7: 145-157PubMed Google Scholar). From a secondary structure prediction algorithm and comparative amino acid sequence analysis, a region in DnaA protein (residues 168–235) is proposed to form a Rossmann fold and also contains conserved sequences that may function to coordinate Mg2+ in Mg2+-ATP (Fig. 1, Ref. 14Sutton M.D. Kaguni J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 546-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This domain is expected to be unaffected by the N-terminal deletions. To demonstrate that the inactivity in DNA replication of the N-terminal truncations was not due to a defect in ATP binding, nitrocellulose filter binding assays were done. We found that the affinity of DnaAΔ129 in binding to ATP (K d of 0.039 μm) was comparable with that of DnaA+ protein (K d of 0.02 μm) (data not shown). Southwestern Analysis of DnaAΔ62 and DnaAΔ129 showed that both bound to a restriction fragment containing oriC with affinities comparable to DnaA+ protein (17Sutton M.D. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23017-23024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as this method does not accurately measure sequence-specific DNA binding activity, gel mobility shift assays were performed (Fig.3). DnaAΔ129 formed discrete complexes at comparable levels as DnaA+; with DnaA+protein, these complexes represent its ordered binding to DnaA boxes oforiC (25Margulies C. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17035-17040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We attribute the slightly faster electrophoretic mobility of DnaAΔ129 complexes compared with DnaA+complexes to the smaller size of DnaAΔ129. These results indicate that the portion of DnaA protein lacking in these deletion mutants does not affect binding to ATP or to oriC. DnaA protein has several other distinct activities that contribute to its function in DNA replication. To identify the specific defect of these mutants, assays were performed that measure the formation of replication intermediates. One assay measures the local unwinding oforiC. To address if the N-terminal region functions in this process, linearization of an oriC plasmid by P1 nuclease that cleaves the unwound single-stranded DNA was measured (Fig.4). In this assay, both mutant proteins were as active as DnaA+ protein. The site of P1 nuclease cleavage was mapped by AflIII restriction to confirm that unwinding was in the AT-rich region (data not shown, Fig. 4 legend). At their highest levels, DnaA+ and DnaAΔ62 were inhibitory but DnaAΔ129 was not. We do not know the reason for this difference. Because the mutants were active in strand opening oforiC, we next measured the production of a highly negatively supercoiled oriC plasmid termed Form 1* (26Baker T.A. Sekimizu K. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. Cell. 1986; 45: 53-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This assay relies on the binding of DnaA protein to DnaA boxes in oriCto result in unwinding of the AT-rich region of oriC (3Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Subsequent binding of DnaB protein to this intermediate and its helicase activity enlarges the unpaired region (27LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Baker T.A. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6877-6885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Positive superhelicity induced by more extensive helicase action can be relieved by DNA gyrase to produce Form 1* that is detectable by agarose gel electrophoresis. We found that both deletion mutations were inactive in Form 1* formation, whereas DnaA+ protein was active (Fig.5). The addition of either DnaAΔ62 or DnaAΔ129 to reactions with DnaA+ protein was inhibitory. This suggests that their inhibitory effect in oriC plasmid replication (Fig. 2, panel B) is due to the formation of mixed inactive complexes with DnaA+protein. The activity of the deletion mutants in unwinding of oriCand inactivity in Form 1* formation indicate that the defect is at the step of loading of DnaB at oriC. To consider the exact defect in DnaB loading, one possibility is that because DnaA and DnaB interact physically (11Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the deletion mutants are defective in this property. A second is that a specific nucleoprotein complex of DnaA protein bound to DnaA box sequences is required for DnaB to bind tooriC. We could exclude a third possibility that the entry of DnaB at oriC simply involves its binding to the unwound ssDNA that is either naked or covered by SSB. This is because the deletion mutants retained the ability to locally unwindoriC, but were inactive in Form 1* formation. We showed earlier that DnaA and DnaB physically interact (11Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leading to the suggestion that this interaction is important for the delivery of DnaB to oriC. If Form 1* formation requires the direct interaction between DnaA and DnaB for entry of the helicase onto the DNA, the inactivity of the N-terminal deletions in this assay may be due to their inability to bind to DnaB. To measure binding, we used a quantitative method of surface plasmon resonance. This method measures the binding between two (or more) molecules by the change in mass near the sensor surface caused by the binding of one protein from the aqueous phase to a second immobilized on the sensor. This change is measured as resonance units with time after injection of the protein or its removal. With this method, the binding of DnaA protein to immobilized DnaB was in proportion to the amount of DnaA protein injected and showed biphasic kinetics (Fig.6, panel A). The biphasic kinetics, most likely due to heterogeneity in how DnaB was immobilized to the sensor chip, precludes a kinetic analysis of the data. At similar concentrations, DnaA+, DnaAΔ62, and DnaAΔ129 bound comparably. No binding was seen with DnaAΔ219, a derivative lacking residues 1–219, or DnaA protein from B. subtilis (Fig. 6, panel B). As a control, bovine serum albumin did not bind to DnaB. We previously described a monoclonal antibody (M7) that inhibits DnaA protein function by hindering the binding of DnaB from the DnaB-DnaC complex at the step of prepriming (11Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This antibody recognizes a conformational epitope within amino acid residues 111–148 (29Marszalek J. Zhang W. Hupp T.R. Margulies C. Carr K.M. Cherry S. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18535-18542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As controls, the inclusion of either M7 antibody or DnaB with DnaA protein in the injected sample reduced the binding of wild type DnaA protein to immobilized DnaB (Fig. 6, panel C). These results support the importance of a region from amino acids 111–148 in the interaction with DnaB. However, this interaction is weak (estimated to be in the micromolar range, see Fig. 6 legend), consistent with the requirement for glutaraldehyde cross-linking to stabilize the complex between DnaA and DnaB measured in a solid phase binding assay (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) (11Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We conclude that the deficiency of the mutants in Form 1* formation is not due to a defect in binding between DnaA and DnaB in the import of DnaB tooriC. Another possible explanation for the inactivity of the N-terminal truncations in the Form 1* assay may be the requirement for a particular nucleoprotein structure formed by the binding of DnaA protein to DnaA box sequences. To test this, we measured the loading of DnaB onto DNA by measuring the ability of the mutant proteins to form a prepriming complex on M13 A-site ssDNA. This single-stranded DNA bears a DnaA box in a hairpin structure (21Masai H. Nomura N. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15134-15144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Nomura N. Masai H. Inuzuka M. Miyazaki C. Ohtsubo E. Itoh T. Sasamoto S. Matsui M. Ishizaki R. Arai K. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We showed previously that DnaA, DnaB, and DnaC are required to form this intermediate that can be isolated by gel filtration chromatography (11Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To measure the loading of DnaB onto the ssDNA, DnaB and DnaC protein in the isolated prepriming complex were detected by immunoblotting (Fig.7). In the negative control involving incubation of proteins in the absence of ssDNA, DnaA+protein was not detected in void volume fractions (data not shown). The low levels of DnaB and DnaC detected in this control represent the background in this analysis (Fig. 7, first row). In the prepriming intermediate formed with DnaA+ protein and M13 A-site ssDNA, DnaB and DnaC were retained. Side-by-side reactions containing DnaAΔ62 or DnaAΔ129 resulted in void volume fractions with background levels of DnaB and DnaC. In these experiments, ATPγS was included to retain DnaC in the prepriming complexes. With ATP instead, its hydrolysis in the DnaB-DnaC complex results in the release of DnaC (6Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2469-2475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2463-2468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3M. D. Sutton, K. M. Carr, M. Vicente, and J. M. Kaguni, unpublished results. Quantitative analysis to determine the stoichiometry of the proteins in isolated prepriming complexes has confirmed that DnaAΔ62 and DnaAΔ129 are defective in retaining DnaB.2 These quantitative studies showed that in isolated prepriming complexes several molecules of DnaA+, DnaAΔ62, or DnaAΔ129 are bound to a single DnaA box in the ssDNA. We propose that monomers of DnaA protein form a nucleoprotein complex in which the N-terminal region stabilizes DnaB on the SSB-coated ssDNA. The mechanism of initiation of DNA replication at oriCinvolves a series of discrete steps. One key event is the entry of DnaB helicase at oriC that results in its proper positioning to advance each replication fork bidirectionally. Once established at each replication fork, DnaB makes contacts with primase in the synthesis of primers for the lagging strand and with the τ subunit of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme to couple the activity of the helicase to DNA polymerization (8Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 643-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 9Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DnaB binds poorly to duplex DNA or to single-stranded DNA covered by SSB (30Arai K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowska D. Bujalowski W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10515-10529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Consequently, a fundamental question is how DnaB is imported onto the DNA atoriC. The experiments described here focus on the role of the N-terminal region of DnaA protein. The functional importance of this region was first appreciated when a large number of novel missense mutations were mapped to amino acid residues from position 9 to 64 (14Sutton M.D. Kaguni J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 546-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To determine the function of this region, we characterized two N-terminal deletion mutants (DnaAΔ62 and DnaAΔ129 lacking the first 62 and 129 amino acid residues, respectively). The mutant proteins were active in binding to ATP and to a DNA fragment bearing oriC. They were also active in unwinding the AT-rich region at the left end oforiC detected by P1 nuclease cleavage, but were defective in assays measuring different intermediates of the initiation process that each require the loading of DnaB. Notably, DnaAΔ62 and DnaAΔ129 were inactive in Form 1* formation that involves both local unwinding of the AT-rich region of oriC and the entry of DnaB protein so that it can act as a helicase. Because DnaA protein binds directly to DnaB (11Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these results suggest that the mutant proteins are defective in this interaction. To test this, experiments measuring prepriming complex formation were done with SSB-coated M13 ssDNA bearing a DnaA box in a hairpin structure. The intermediate formed by the binding of DnaA, DnaB, and DnaC protein is a substrate for primer formation by primase followed by its extension by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. Compared to DnaA+ protein, immunoblot analysis of isolated prepriming complexes revealed that DnaB was poorly retained by either DnaAΔ62 or DnaAΔ129. Normalizing for the amount of ssDNA, quantitative analysis of isolated prepriming complexes has verified these results.2 Because a similar mechanism is likely to occur at oriC, we conclude that the defect of the N-terminal deletions in Form 1* formation is in promoting the stable binding of DnaB to the prepriming complex. Inasmuch as several molecules of DnaA protein (or N-terminal deletion mutant) are bound per ssDNA,2 this suggests that they form a unique nucleoprotein structure that is required for retention of DnaB. Contrary to the above results, the defect is not in the binding of DnaA to DnaB per se. By surface plasmon resonance, not only did wild type DnaA protein bind to DnaB but both N-terminal truncations did as well. As controls, binding was reduced by the inclusion of DnaB or a monoclonal antibody (M7) with DnaA protein in the injected sample. This antibody recognizes a conformational epitope within amino acids 111–148 of DnaA protein to inhibit prepriming complex formation (11Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that two functional domains are involved in the binding of DnaA to DnaB in prepriming. The region of DnaA protein occluded by the antibody is apparently required for the transient (weak) binding of DnaB in its entry into the prepriming complex. In contrast, the N-terminal region lacking in DnaAΔ62 is important for the stable retention of DnaB in the prepriming complex. Because a number of novel dnaA mutations maps within the N-terminal region lacking in DnaAΔ62, the results presented here suggest that these missense mutants are defective in directing the stable binding of DnaB in the prepriming complex. Likewise, thednaA508 allele that encodes a substitution of proline at residue 28 (and threonine at position 80) (32Gotfried F. Wechsler J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 130: 963-964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hansen F.G. von Meyenburg K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 175: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 34Hansen E.B. Atlung T. Hansen F.G. Skovgaard O. von Meyenburg K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 196: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) is expected to share this defect. We found that a mutant substituted at proline 28 with leucine was active in binding to ATP and to a DNA fragment containingoriC by gel mobility shift analysis, but was inactive in Form 1* activity, suggesting a defect in DnaB loading. 4M. D. Sutton and J. M. Kaguni, unpublished results. This interpretation is supported by the observation that B. subtilis DnaA protein failed to bind to DnaB. Comparative amino acid sequence analysis of dnaA homologs reveals that the greatest degree of amino acid sequence variation resides near the N terminus (24Kaguni J.M. Mol.

The initiation process at oriC involves the unwinding of the AT-rich region near the left boundary that may provide an entry site for DnaB from the DnaB-DnaC complex onto the single stranded DNA. Perhaps the most surprising result of this report is that the N-terminal deletions were active in unwinding the AT-rich region but defective in the loading of DnaB in prepriming complex formation. This was with an M13 derivative carrying a DnaA box in a proposed hairpin structure. Apparently, the ssDNA created by unwinding oforiC or already existing in M13 A-site ssDNA is insufficient for the binding of DnaB. These results indicate that the binding of DnaB to the DNA on which it acts must be mediated by sequences in the N-terminal domain of DnaA. Accordingly, these results support the following model (Fig. 8). First, DnaA protein binds to DnaA boxes in oriC in an ordered manner (25Margulies C. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17035-17040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). On binding to ATP, it unwinds a region near the left end oforiC to form the open complex (3Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 23Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). HU or IHF are stimulatory but are not absolutely required at this step (4Skarstad K. Baker T.A. Kornberg A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2341-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23083-23086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interaction of DnaB protein with DnaA protein, first transiently with amino acids from positions 111 to 148 and then with residues within the first 62 amino acids, results in its stable retention. Release of DnaC protein from the DnaB-DnaC complex unmasks the helicase activity of DnaB. On subsequent unwinding of the parental duplex, the transitory interaction with primase results in the synthesis of primers that are then extended by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. How might these results relate to the pathway of initiation in the eukaryotic cell? It is striking that several aspects of the replication process in E. coli and S. cerevisiae are so similar. First, both DnaA and ORC act as sequence-specific DNA binding proteins to target the initiation complex to the replication origin. Second, the binding of these proteins to the replication origin is not sufficient to initiate DNA replication. They are bound at the respective origins at times in the cell cycle when replication does not occur (35Diffley J.F. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A. Cell. 1994; 78: 303-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 36Samitt C.E. Hansen F.G. Miller J.F. Schaechter M.

In the case of DnaA, the sites bound are DnaA boxes R1, R2, and R4. However, the binding of DnaA protein to DnaA box R3 is critical for initiation to occur (25Margulies C. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17035-17040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 37Cassler M.R. Grimwade J.E. Leonard A.C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5833-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Third, processivity of the replicative DNA polymerase (DNA polymerase III core of E. coli or DNA polymerase δ or DNA polymerase ε in eukaryotic cells) is dependent on a sliding clamp bearing a common structure (β subunit of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme in E. coli and proliferating cell nuclear antigen in eukaryotes) and a clamp loader (the DnaX or γ complex in E. coli and replication factor C in eukaryotes) (see Ref. 1Baker T.A. Bell S.P. Cell. 1998; 92: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar for a recent review). Based on these similarities, the finding that DnaA promotes the loading of DnaB atoriC suggests a similar directed mechanism of helicase loading in eukaryotic cells. Considering that hexameric DnaB is a ring-like structure with the ssDNA passing through the central cavity (38Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Jezewska M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31350-31358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Yu X. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. Egelman E.H. J. Mol.

Biol. 1996; 3: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the binding of DnaA to DnaB may result in transient opening of the DnaB ring for ssDNA strand passage and binding to one of the DnaB subunits. In addition to the requirement for DnaB protein in copying the E. coli genome, many plasmids and phage requirednaBfunction for replication. In λ DNA replication, two λ-encoded proteins act in the initial events. λ O protein is the counterpart to DnaA protein in that it recognizes specific sequences in the λ origin (41Tsurimoto T. Matsubara K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 1789-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 42Zahn K. Blattner F.R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3605-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 43Dodson M.

Liss, Inc., New York1983: 819-848Google Scholar) and O and P protein interact, it has been speculated based on analogy that DnaA and DnaC interact. We showed previously that DnaA interacts with DnaB and not with DnaC by a solid phase binding assay (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) (11Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results have been confirmed by surface plasmon resonance measurements. 5M. Vicente and J. M. Kaguni, unpublished results. With DnaA immobilized on the sensor chip, binding was observed with DnaB and not with DnaC as the analyte. Despite the common requirement for DnaB to function as the replicative helicase in the duplication of the genomes of λ and E. coli, the mechanism whereby DnaB is imported to the respective initiation complex appears to be different. Other replicons may have different mechanisms for the entry of DnaB. In the case of R6K, the plasmid-encoded initiator protein (pi) interacts specifically with DnaB (49Ratnakar P.V. Mohanty B.K. Lobert M. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5522-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In pSC101 replication, genetic evidence suggests an interaction between RepA protein and DnaA, possibly to import DnaB onto the plasmid origin (14Sutton M.D. Kaguni J.M. J. Mol.

The calcium receptor (CaR)1 is a G-protein-coupled-receptor (GPCR) involved in extracellular calcium homeostasis by controlling the rate of parathyroid hormone secretion from the parathyroid gland and the rate of calcium reabsorbtion by the kidney (1Brown E.M. Pollak M. Hebert S.C. Annu. Rev. Med. 1998; 49: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that the CaR is also involved in diverse cellular responses to extracellular calcium within microenvironments in other organs such as brain, skin, bone, and intestine (2Chattopadhyay N. Vassilev P.M. Brown E.M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 759-768PubMed Google Scholar). Extracellular calcium ion ([Ca2+]o) activates the CaR, leading to activation of phospholipase-Cβ via the Gqsubfamily of G-proteins; this increases phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, which in turn causes release of calcium from intracellular stores (3Brown E.M.

The remaining two sites are conserved among human, rabbit, and chicken CaRs, but only one of the two (Asn-386 or -400 in the hCaR sequence) is conserved in rat and bovine CaRs, respectively.The carbohydrate moieties of glycoproteins in general are believed to be important for facilitating protein folding, protection from proteolysis, intracellular trafficking, secretion, and cell surface expression (14Helenius A.

They may also be important for maintaining protein conformation, enzymatic activity, and other structural functions (15Opdenakker G. Rudd P.M. Ponting C.P. Dwek R.A.

Among GPCRs, the role of carbohydrate moieties is somewhat less clear, with variable effects on ligand binding, signal transduction, and cell surface expression (17Kaushal S. Ridge K.D. Khorana H.G.

The function ofN-linked glycosylation for the CaR or other members of this unique GPCR subfamily with significantly larger ECDs and a greater number of putative N-linked glycosylation sites has not been studied extensively. Our previous study with tunicamycin indicated that inhibition of N-linked glycosylation blocks normal cell surface expression of the hCaR (24Fan G. Goldsmith P.K. Collins R. Dunn C.K. Krapcho K.J. Rogers K.V. Spiegel A.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1916-1922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this study did not permit determination of the precise number and location of N-linked glycosylation sites, nor did it allow us to define distinctive roles, if any, of specific sites in the processing, cell surface expression, and signal transduction of the hCaR. To address these questions, we mutated the potential N-linked glycosylation sites of the hCaR, substituting glutamine for asparagine to disrupt glycosylation, and transfected the mutant receptor cDNAs into HEK-293 cells to analyze the effects on expression and function.DISCUSSIONThe importance of N-linked glycosylation for expression and function has been extensively studied for many GPCRs but not for the unique subset to which the CaR belongs. Most GPCRs of the large rhodopsin subfamily that includes adrenergic receptors and a number of peptide receptors have relatively short extracellular amino termini with one or two glycosylation sites. In some (17Kaushal S. Ridge K.D. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4024-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 18Ding D.X.-H. Vera J.C. Heaney M.L. Golde D.W. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 467-473PubMed Google Scholar) cases, glycosylation of at least one site is required for efficient cell surface expression. The glycoprotein hormone receptors have a large amino-terminal ECD, approximately two-thirds the size of the CaR, with three (follicle-stimulating hormone) or six (luteinizing hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone) putative glycosylation sites (21Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,23Davis D. Liu X. Segaloff D.L. Mol.

For both the follicle-stimulating hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptors, glycosylation of a specific subset of sites (one of three for follicle-stimulating hormone and two of six for thyroid-stimulating hormone) was shown to be absolutely required for cell surface expression (21Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Davis D. Liu X. Segaloff D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 159-170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor, enzymatic deglycosylation studies of wild type receptor showed that carbohydrate is not, however, essential for hormone binding (23Davis D. Liu X. Segaloff D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 159-170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results for the luteinizing hormone receptor are controversial. One study concluded that glycosylation at two of six sites is required for proper receptor folding but not for hormone binding per se (31Zhang R. Cai H. Fatima N. Buczko E. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21722-21728Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A different study employing tunicamycin to inhibit glycosylation suggested that carbohydrate is not required at all for proper receptor folding and hormone binding (30Davis D.P. Rozell T.G. Liu X. Segaloff D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 550-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Loss of function observed in other mutagenesis studies was attributed to differences in primary sequence rather than disruption of glycosylation.Previous studies on the CaR indicated that it is relatively heavily glycosylated (3Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2344) Google Scholar) and that inhibition of glycosylation with tunicamycin blocks receptor expression at the cell surface (24Fan G. Goldsmith P.K. Collins R. Dunn C.K. Krapcho K.J. Rogers K.V. Spiegel A.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1916-1922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present studies were directed at defining which of the 11 putative glycosylation sites in the ECD are actually used and the role of glycosylation in receptor expression and function. Based on studies of a series of mutants in which glycosylation consensus site asparagines were changed to glutamine singly and in various combinations, we identified eight of the 11 putative sites as containingN-linked sugar. Disruption of any of these eight sites alone caused a slight increase in mobility of the expressed receptor on SDS-PAGE; disruption of tandem sites caused additive changes in mobility. Glycosidase digestion of mutants in which all but one of these eight sites were disrupted confirmed that each of these sites could be glycosylated. The remaining three sites in contrast did not appear to be glycosylated unless the other eight sites were disrupted, suggesting that they are far less efficiently modified. This overall pattern, obtained in HEK-293 cells transiently transfected, may not exactly reflect the pattern of glycosylation of CaRs expressed endogenously in tissues such as parathyroid and kidney, but the similarity in size of bands obtained in immunoblots of membranes from transfected 293 cells and from parathyroid (26Goldsmith P.K. Fan G. Miller J.L. Rogers K.V. Spiegel A.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1780-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) suggests that the glycosylation pattern is likely to be quite similar.The principal functional effect of disruption of CaR glycosylation sites we were able to define is loss of cell surface expression. Elimination of one or two of the employed glycosylation sites did not measurably impair expression. The disease familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is caused by loss of function mutations of the hCaR (1Brown E.M. Pollak M. Hebert S.C. Annu. Rev. Med. 1998; 49: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Many single amino acid mutations have been identified that cause this disease (28Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) but none to date that involve mutation of a consensus glycosylation site, consistent with the lack of significant functional impairment of disruption of single glycosylation sites. Elimination of three or more glycosylation sites caused progressive reduction in cell surface expression. Elimination of five or more sites led to a form of the receptor characterized by a single, Endo H-sensitive band on immunoblots. Previous studies of other CaR mutants have indicated that this band probably represents a form of the CaR that is misfolded, retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, and unable to undergo normal processing in the Golgi needed for cell surface expression (25Ray K. Fan G.-F. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31355-31361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 28Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S.

Immunofluorescence experiments and cell surface protein labeling with biotin confirmed that the Endo-H-sensitive band seen on immunoblots corresponds to an intracellular form of the hCaR.We interpret the present studies to indicate a critical role forN-linked glycosylation of a minimum number of CaR ECD sites in normal folding of the receptor as it is being synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Interestingly, the degree of functional impairment differed with the site of disruption of glycosylation. The N1–5Q mutant showed more severe loss of expression than did the N4–8Q mutant; although five sites are disrupted in both mutants, apparently the loss of more amino-terminal sites has a greater impact on protein folding and retention of the receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum. All of these results must be qualified by the caveat that effects of asparagine to glutamine substitution, although a conservative change, could be due to altered primary sequence rather than disruption of glycosylation. The fact that mutation at single and even double sites did not impair function makes this concern less likely. Also, the ability of tunicamycin to inhibit cell surface expression of the receptor supports a key role for glycosylation in receptor folding and trafficking (24Fan G. Goldsmith P.K. Collins R. Dunn C.K. Krapcho K.J. Rogers K.V. Spiegel A.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1916-1922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Any attempt to study the impact of disruption of glycosylation of the CaR on signal transduction is limited by the lack of a ligand binding assay and the requirement of cell surface expression for measurement of extracellular calcium activation of the receptor in the PI hydrolysis assay. Thus, our studies cannot exclude a role for carbohydrate in calcium binding to and activation of the receptor. Nonetheless, the ability of various glycosylation-deficient mutants to respond to calcium appeared to be impaired in proportion to their reduction in cell surface expression. Mutants such as N1–4Q and N5–8Q when expressed at levels comparable with wild type showed roughly equivalent extracellular calcium-stimulated PI hydrolysis to the wild type CaR, suggesting that a substantial lack of carbohydrate in the ECD does not impair receptor signaling. More definitive studies including enzymatic deglycosylation of purified CaR combined with direct measures of calcium activation will be required to elucidate the role, if any, of ECD carbohydrate in receptor function.The present studies have defined an important role for specific glycosylation sites in CaR processing and cell surface expression. These studies have identified mutant forms of the receptor with multiple glycosylation sites disrupted that nonetheless are able to be expressed as functional receptors at the cell surface. Such mutants may facilitate expression and purification of a form of the CaR ECD useful for x-ray crystallographic studies needed to define the three-dimensional structure of this unique receptor domain. The calcium receptor (CaR)1 is a G-protein-coupled-receptor (GPCR) involved in extracellular calcium homeostasis by controlling the rate of parathyroid hormone secretion from the parathyroid gland and the rate of calcium reabsorbtion by the kidney (1Brown E.M. Pollak M. Hebert S.C. Annu. Rev. Med. 1998; 49: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that the CaR is also involved in diverse cellular responses to extracellular calcium within microenvironments in other organs such as brain, skin, bone, and intestine (2Chattopadhyay N. Vassilev P.M. Brown E.M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 759-768PubMed Google Scholar). Extracellular calcium ion ([Ca2+]o) activates the CaR, leading to activation of phospholipase-Cβ via the Gqsubfamily of G-proteins; this increases phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, which in turn causes release of calcium from intracellular stores (3Brown E.M.

The CaR, metabotropic glutamate receptors (4Nakanishi S.

The remaining two sites are conserved among human, rabbit, and chicken CaRs, but only one of the two (Asn-386 or -400 in the hCaR sequence) is conserved in rat and bovine CaRs, respectively. The carbohydrate moieties of glycoproteins in general are believed to be important for facilitating protein folding, protection from proteolysis, intracellular trafficking, secretion, and cell surface expression (14Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 15Opdenakker G. Rudd P.M. Ponting C.P. Dwek R.A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1330-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). They may also be important for maintaining protein conformation, enzymatic activity, and other structural functions (15Opdenakker G. Rudd P.M. Ponting C.P. Dwek R.A.

Among GPCRs, the role of carbohydrate moieties is somewhat less clear, with variable effects on ligand binding, signal transduction, and cell surface expression (17Kaushal S. Ridge K.D. Khorana H.G.

The function ofN-linked glycosylation for the CaR or other members of this unique GPCR subfamily with significantly larger ECDs and a greater number of putative N-linked glycosylation sites has not been studied extensively. Our previous study with tunicamycin indicated that inhibition of N-linked glycosylation blocks normal cell surface expression of the hCaR (24Fan G. Goldsmith P.K. Collins R. Dunn C.K. Krapcho K.J. Rogers K.V. Spiegel A.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1916-1922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this study did not permit determination of the precise number and location of N-linked glycosylation sites, nor did it allow us to define distinctive roles, if any, of specific sites in the processing, cell surface expression, and signal transduction of the hCaR. To address these questions, we mutated the potential N-linked glycosylation sites of the hCaR, substituting glutamine for asparagine to disrupt glycosylation, and transfected the mutant receptor cDNAs into HEK-293 cells to analyze the effects on expression and function. DISCUSSIONThe importance of N-linked glycosylation for expression and function has been extensively studied for many GPCRs but not for the unique subset to which the CaR belongs. Most GPCRs of the large rhodopsin subfamily that includes adrenergic receptors and a number of peptide receptors have relatively short extracellular amino termini with one or two glycosylation sites. In some (17Kaushal S. Ridge K.D. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4024-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 18Ding D.X.-H. Vera J.C. Heaney M.L. Golde D.W. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 467-473PubMed Google Scholar) cases, glycosylation of at least one site is required for efficient cell surface expression. The glycoprotein hormone receptors have a large amino-terminal ECD, approximately two-thirds the size of the CaR, with three (follicle-stimulating hormone) or six (luteinizing hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone) putative glycosylation sites (21Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,23Davis D. Liu X. Segaloff D.L. Mol.

For both the follicle-stimulating hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptors, glycosylation of a specific subset of sites (one of three for follicle-stimulating hormone and two of six for thyroid-stimulating hormone) was shown to be absolutely required for cell surface expression (21Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Davis D. Liu X. Segaloff D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 159-170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor, enzymatic deglycosylation studies of wild type receptor showed that carbohydrate is not, however, essential for hormone binding (23Davis D. Liu X. Segaloff D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 159-170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results for the luteinizing hormone receptor are controversial. One study concluded that glycosylation at two of six sites is required for proper receptor folding but not for hormone binding per se (31Zhang R. Cai H. Fatima N. Buczko E. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21722-21728Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A different study employing tunicamycin to inhibit glycosylation suggested that carbohydrate is not required at all for proper receptor folding and hormone binding (30Davis D.P. Rozell T.G. Liu X. Segaloff D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 550-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Loss of function observed in other mutagenesis studies was attributed to differences in primary sequence rather than disruption of glycosylation.Previous studies on the CaR indicated that it is relatively heavily glycosylated (3Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2344) Google Scholar) and that inhibition of glycosylation with tunicamycin blocks receptor expression at the cell surface (24Fan G. Goldsmith P.K. Collins R. Dunn C.K. Krapcho K.J. Rogers K.V. Spiegel A.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1916-1922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present studies were directed at defining which of the 11 putative glycosylation sites in the ECD are actually used and the role of glycosylation in receptor expression and function. Based on studies of a series of mutants in which glycosylation consensus site asparagines were changed to glutamine singly and in various combinations, we identified eight of the 11 putative sites as containingN-linked sugar. Disruption of any of these eight sites alone caused a slight increase in mobility of the expressed receptor on SDS-PAGE; disruption of tandem sites caused additive changes in mobility. Glycosidase digestion of mutants in which all but one of these eight sites were disrupted confirmed that each of these sites could be glycosylated. The remaining three sites in contrast did not appear to be glycosylated unless the other eight sites were disrupted, suggesting that they are far less efficiently modified. This overall pattern, obtained in HEK-293 cells transiently transfected, may not exactly reflect the pattern of glycosylation of CaRs expressed endogenously in tissues such as parathyroid and kidney, but the similarity in size of bands obtained in immunoblots of membranes from transfected 293 cells and from parathyroid (26Goldsmith P.K.

Elimination of one or two of the employed glycosylation sites did not measurably impair expression. The disease familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is caused by loss of function mutations of the hCaR (1Brown E.M. Pollak M. Hebert S.C. Annu. Rev. Med. 1998; 49: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Many single amino acid mutations have been identified that cause this disease (28Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S.

Elimination of three or more glycosylation sites caused progressive reduction in cell surface expression. Elimination of five or more sites led to a form of the receptor characterized by a single, Endo H-sensitive band on immunoblots. Previous studies of other CaR mutants have indicated that this band probably represents a form of the CaR that is misfolded, retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, and unable to undergo normal processing in the Golgi needed for cell surface expression (25Ray K.

Nonetheless, the ability of various glycosylation-deficient mutants to respond to calcium appeared to be impaired in proportion to their reduction in cell surface expression.

The fact that mutation at single and even double sites did not impair function makes this concern less likely. Also, the ability of tunicamycin to inhibit cell surface expression of the receptor supports a key role for glycosylation in receptor folding and trafficking (24Fan G. Goldsmith P.K. Collins R. Dunn C.K. Krapcho K.J. Rogers K.V. Spiegel A.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1916-1922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Any attempt to study the impact of disruption of glycosylation of the CaR on signal transduction is limited by the lack of a ligand binding assay and the requirement of cell surface expression for measurement of extracellular calcium activation of the receptor in the PI hydrolysis assay. Thus, our studies cannot exclude a role for carbohydrate in calcium binding to and activation of the receptor. Nonetheless, the ability of various glycosylation-deficient mutants to respond to calcium appeared to be impaired in proportion to their reduction in cell surface expression. Mutants such as N1–4Q and N5–8Q when expressed at levels comparable with wild type showed roughly equivalent extracellular calcium-stimulated PI hydrolysis to the wild type CaR, suggesting that a substantial lack of carbohydrate in the ECD does not impair receptor signaling. More definitive studies including enzymatic deglycosylation of purified CaR combined with direct measures of calcium activation will be required to elucidate the role, if any, of ECD carbohydrate in receptor function. The present studies have defined an important role for specific glycosylation sites in CaR processing and cell surface expression. These studies have identified mutant forms of the receptor with multiple glycosylation sites disrupted that nonetheless are able to be expressed as functional receptors at the cell surface. Such mutants may facilitate expression and purification of a form of the CaR ECD useful for x-ray crystallographic studies needed to define the three-dimensional structure of this unique receptor domain.

Subendothelial collagens are primary platelet agonists and are thereby essential components of the hemostatic system. At sites of vascular damage, platelets adhere to exposed collagen fibers and undergo activation via a tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling pathway. Activation causes an increase in the binding capability of the fibrinogen receptor, integrin αIIbβ3, and the secretion of various mediators that culminate in the formation of an irreversible platelet aggregate, or hemostatic plug. The integrin α2β1 is expressed on the platelet surface and has been shown to support adhesion to collagen, although increasing evidence suggests that a second platelet collagen receptor underlies platelet activation.The collagen receptor that underlies activation comprises the uncharacterized platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI)1 (1Gibbins J.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3897-3902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The FcR γ-chain is a transmembrane protein that is expressed as a homodimer. The cytoplasmic tail of the protein contains a consensus motif termed an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM),which is defined as YXXLX (6–8)YXXL whereX represents any amino acid (9Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). This motif, which is also present in subunits of the T and B cell antigen receptors, becomes phosphorylated on the conserved tyrosine residues on ligand binding, enabling association of members of the Syk/Zap70 family of tyrosine kinases (3Gibbins J.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of ITAMs has been demonstrated to involve the activity of Src-family kinases, and two recent reports indicate that this role is performed by Fyn and/or Lyn on stimulation of GPVI in platelets and megakaryocytes (11Melford S.K.

J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar).The binding of collagen to platelets is believed to cause clustering of GPVI, and this is thought to be responsible for initiating tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain, presumably on the ITAM. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain facilitates the recruitment of the tyrosine kinase Syk to the receptor complex, which binds to the FcR γ-chain via its tandem Src-homology 2 (SH2) domains (3Gibbins J. Asselin J. Farndale R. Barnes M. Law C.L. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18095-18099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Using mice that have been engineered to lack either the FcR γ-chain or Syk, we have demonstrated that both proteins are essential for collagen-stimulated activation of platelets and that activation of Syk is essential for phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2) (13Poole A. Gibbins J.M. Turner M. van Vugt M.J. van de Winkel J.G.J. Saito T. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Watson S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Platelets express a low affinity receptor for IgG, FcγRIIA, and this is believed to signal through the same pathway as for GPVI. Cross-linking of FcγRIIA results in tyrosine phosphorylation of its intrinsic ITAM sequence, leading to activation of Syk and PLCγ2. Chacko et al. (14Chacko G.W. Brandt J.T. Coggeshall K.M. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10775-10781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) propose that FcγRIIA becomes coupled to the p85/110 isoform of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) through Syk, which is recruited to the tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM sequence of the activated receptor. Association of the p85 regulatory subunit with a phosphopeptide containing the ITAM of FcγRIIA was dependent on platelets being activated by FcγRIIA cross-linking, whereas association with Syk was independent of activation. The authors therefore proposed that Syk may function as an adapter protein, indirectly linking p85 to the phosphorylated ITAM.In this report we present data that suggests two potential pathways of regulation of PI3-kinase by GPVI. We demonstrate that the interaction of p85 with the receptor complex is a direct interaction with the tyrosine-phosphorylated FcR γ-chain ITAM through the SH2 domains of p85. In addition, we show that LAT, recently cloned from T cells (15Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar), becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated on stimulation of GPVI and associates with p85.DISCUSSIONPhosphatidylinositol 3-kinases are an important class of signaling enzymes that underlie a variety of cellular responses such as cell motility, cytoskeletal rearrangement, regulation of integrin activation, proliferation, and differentiation (24Kimura K.

The family includes the p85/p110 isoform, which comprises two associated proteins, the p85 regulatory subunit and the catalytic subunit p110. p85 is a 724-amino acid protein that contains two SH2 domains and one SH3 domain (29Escodedo J.A.

The SH2 and SH3 domains of p85 allow interactions with other signaling proteins, resulting in translocation and activation of the p110 catalytic subunit. The consensus phosphotyrosine binding motif for the SH2 domains of p85 have been defined as YXXM (32Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S.

Recruitment of the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase to activated membrane receptors such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor results in translocation of p110 to the vicinity of substrates. The p110 catalytic subunit is a protein of 1068 amino acids that associates with p85 via region between the two SH2 domains. On activation, this enzyme phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate on the 3-position of the myo-inositol ring, resulting in the formation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate is a second messenger which supports membrane binding of proteins with pleckstrin homology domains and the regulation of some protein kinase C isoforms (33Singh S.S. Chauhan A. Brockerhoff H. Chauhan V.P.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).There is increasing evidence indicating that PI3-kinase participates in a number of signaling pathways in platelets. PI3-kinase is involved in activation of integrin αIIbβ3 (26Zhang J. Zhang J. Shattil S.J. Cunningham M.C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol.

Through the use of the structurally distinct PI3-kinase inhibitors LY 294002 (38Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol.

J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar), we have previously shown that this enzyme is required for full activation of PLCγ2 by collagen (40Mountford J.M. Gross B. Watson S.P. Blood. 1997; 10 Suppl. 2: 2993Google Scholar) and convulxin. 2J. M. Gibbins, P. Thompson, and S. P. Watson, unpublished observation. Several publications have reported the involvement of PI3-kinase in signal transduction generated by Fc receptors (41Ibarrola I. Vossebeld P.J.M. Homburg C.H.E. Thelen M. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 42Melendez A.J. Gillooly D.J. Harnett M.M. Aleen J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2169-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In a study of the signal transduction generated by the low affinity IgG receptor (FcγRIIA) in platelets, Chacko et al. (14Chacko G.W. Brandt J.T. Coggeshall K.M. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10775-10781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) show that stimulation of the receptor by cross-linking results in a transient increase in the activity of PI3-kinase, as shown in an in vitro kinase assay. Furthermore, platelet aggregation by stimulation of FcγRIIA is abrogated by pre-treatment with wortmannin. The authors reported that p85 is capable of binding to FcγRIIA-ITAM phosphopeptides in a transient manner and that this was dependent on activation of platelets by cross-linking the receptor. The interaction was therefore proposed to be indirect, possibly mediated via Syk, which also bound to the phosphorylated ITAM peptide.In this study we have investigated mechanisms for the regulation of PI3-kinase following stimulation of the GPVI-FcR γ-chain collagen receptor. Platelets possess several additional proteins or receptors that bind collagen, and their contributions to signal transduction and activation are unclear. We therefore also used a highly potent second platelet agonist convulxin, which selectively binds GPVI (20Polgár J. Clemetson J.M. Kehrel B.E. Wiedemann M. Magnenat E.M. Wells T.N.C. Clemetson K.J.

The importance of the GPVI pathway in signaling stimulated by convulxin was demonstrated in the present study. Using mouse platelets that have been engineered to lack the FcR γ-chain, which is an essential component of the receptor, we demonstrated that functional and biochemical platelet responses to the venom were absent. This indicates that convulxin stimulates platelet activation through binding to, and activation of, the GPVI-FcR γ-chain collagen receptor.We demonstrate two potential mechanisms for the regulation of PI3-kinase on stimulation of the collagen receptor: through binding to the activated receptor and by binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT. Using peptides based on the ITAM sequence of the FcR γ-chain, we show that when tyrosine-phosphorylated, the motif is able to bind to the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase, and the level of protein associated is not affected by stimulation with collagen or the more powerful agonist convulxin. p85 is also able to bind to the tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM of FcγRIIA, and likewise, the levels associated from basal cells are equivalent to those from stimulated platelets. This result contrasts that of Chacko et al. (14Chacko G.W. Brandt J.T. Coggeshall K.M. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10775-10781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), who observe association only in stimulated cells and proposed that this was mediated through interaction with Syk. The explanation for this difference is not known. We also show that Syk from resting platelets associates with both of the tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM peptides at similar levels under resting conditions and following stimulation with collagen or convulxin. The level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk bound to the peptides is increased on stimulation with collagen or convulxin. This is consistent with our previous observations of association between the tandem SH2 domains in Syk and the FcR γ-chain both in vitro and in vivo (3Gibbins J. Asselin J. Farndale R. Barnes M. Law C.L. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18095-18099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These observations strengthen the conclusion that the interaction of p85 with the tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAMs is not via Syk, as the lower amount of p85 that associates with the FcR γ-chain peptide relative to the FcγRIIA peptide is not accompanied by a similar reduction in the amount of Syk. Furthermore, the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk that binds to the peptides following stimulation with collagen or convulxin does not result in an increase in the amount of peptide-associated p85. We were also unable to detect coprecipitation of Syk with PI3-kinase after immunoprecipitation of either protein (not shown). These results suggest that PI3-kinase associates directly with the phosphorylated ITAMS. The FcR γ-chain and FcγRIIA ITAMs do not conform to the consensus binding motif YXXM that has been defined for p85 SH2 domain binding (32Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). A similar observation has been previously made for binding to the phosphorylated peptides of the ITAMs present in the T cell receptor ζ-chain complex (44Exley M. Varticovski L. Peter M. Sancho J. Terhorst C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15140-15146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Jascur T. Gilman J. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14483-14488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The association of p85 with the tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM of the FcR γ-chain provides a potential mechanism that may explain how PI3-kinase is activated on stimulation of the collagen receptor. The FcR γ-chain was found to be present in p85 immunoprecipitates from platelets stimulated with convulxin (and to a lesser degree, collagen), thus confirming the interaction in vivo.The second potential mechanisms for the regulation of PI3-kinase is through the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 38 kDa that was present in p85 immunoprecipitates from platelets stimulated with collagen or convulxin. We have identified this protein to be the recently cloned protein LAT, which is tyrosine-phosphorylated by cross-linking of the T cell receptor (15Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT has been shown to interact with PI3-kinase. LAT was not detected in precipitation experiments with tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM containing peptides from the FcR γ-chain and FcγRIIA, which suggests that a phosphorylated ITAM does not bind p85 and LAT simultaneously. LAT functions as an essential linker between stimulation of the T cell receptor and T cell activation, whereupon it becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and binds multiple signaling proteins (15Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). LAT contains consensus binding motifs for the SH2 domains of PLCγ1 and Grb2, which support association with the protein when phosphorylated. Although no consensus binding motif for the SH2 domains of p85 is present in the protein, LAT has also been shown to associate with p85 in activated T cells (15Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 46Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Panchamoorthy G. Soltoff S. Trub T. Druker B. Cantley L. Shoelson S. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20177-20182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because LAT is believed to be anchored in the plasma membrane through an N-terminal transmembrane domain, the recruitment of PLC and PI3-kinase results in translocation of these proteins to the proximity of lipid substrates. In T cells the Ras activator protein SOS has been shown to co-precipitate with LAT, probably because of its interaction with Grb2 (15Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). A 38-kDa protein has previously been described in platelets that associates with Grb2 (47Robinson A. Gibbins J. Rodriguez-Linares B. Finan P.M. Wilson L. Kellie S. Findell P. Watson S.P. Blood. 1996; 88: 522-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore it is possible that LAT may provide a link between the collagen receptor and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway through SOS. The mechanism that results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT in platelets has not been determined; however, Zhang (15Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) et al. report LAT to be a substrate for Syk and Zap-70. Because Syk is an essential component of the signaling mechanism leading to platelet activation on stimulation with collagen, Syk may also perform this function in collagen-stimulated platelets.We investigated the hypothesis that the interaction of p85 with the FcR γ-chain and LAT is supported by the SH2 domains present in p85. Precipitation experiments were performed using the dual SH2 domains of p85 expressed as GST fusion proteins. Both the FcR γ-chain and LAT were capable of binding to the SH2 domains of p85 following stimulation with collagen or convulxin. Investigation into the kinetics of the interaction following stimulation with convulxin revealed that association of both proteins with the p85 SH2 domain construct was rapid and peaked after 90 s of stimulation, and this was reflected by the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the proteins. We also examined the contributions of individual p85 SH2 domains to the interaction with the FcR γ-chain and LAT. The profiles of proteins that associated with the individual SH2 domains were quite different. The N-terminal domain was able to bind a large range of proteins with a similar profile to those precipitated with the dual SH2 domains. An increase in the levels of a number of proteins was observed on stimulation, and notably these included the FcR γ-chain. A smaller profile of proteins was precipitated with the C-terminal SH2 domain. LAT was present in the adsorbates; however, the FcR γ-chain was not. This suggests that only the N-terminal SH2 domain of p85 is necessary to support the association with the FcR γ-chain and that the C-terminal SH2 domain is sufficient for LAT binding. However, the tandem SH2 domains of PI3-kinase may support a stronger interaction (increased affinity) with the phosphorylated ITAMs in vivoas reported for the interaction between the T cell ζ-chain and PI3-kinase (45Jascur T. Gilman J. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14483-14488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Based on the results of this study, we propose a model for signaling by the GPVI-FcR γ-chain collagen receptor that allows divergence of signals from the receptor into multiple signaling pathways. Binding of collagen to the receptor results in clustering and the tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain ITAM. This results in the recruitment of PI3-kinase and Syk to tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM motifs. By analogy with the interaction of PI3-kinase with various growth factor receptors, binding of PI3-kinase to the FcR γ-chain may result in activation of the enzyme leading to the formation of the biologically active intracellular messenger, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. On binding the FcR γ-chain, Syk becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated, which leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PLCγ2. Stimulation of the GPVI-FcR γ-chain collagen receptor results in tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT, possibly by receptor-associated and -activated Syk. LAT, which is anchored through the plasma membrane, may then recruit a number of signaling molecules including PI3-kinase, thus providing a second potential mechanism for the regulation of the enzyme on stimulation of platelets with collagen. It is likely that Grb2 also binds to LAT in platelets, and thereby via associated SOS, may feed into the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Subendothelial collagens are primary platelet agonists and are thereby essential components of the hemostatic system. At sites of vascular damage, platelets adhere to exposed collagen fibers and undergo activation via a tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling pathway. Activation causes an increase in the binding capability of the fibrinogen receptor, integrin αIIbβ3, and the secretion of various mediators that culminate in the formation of an irreversible platelet aggregate, or hemostatic plug. The integrin α2β1 is expressed on the platelet surface and has been shown to support adhesion to collagen, although increasing evidence suggests that a second platelet collagen receptor underlies platelet activation. The collagen receptor that underlies activation comprises the uncharacterized platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI)1 (1Gibbins J.M. Okuma M. Farndale R. Barnes M. Watson S.P.

We have identified template activating factor (TAF)-I from uninfected HeLa cells as the factor that stimulates replication and transcription from the Ad core. The nuclease sensitivity assays have revealed that TAF-I remodels the Ad core, thereby making transcription and replication apparatus accessible to the template DNA. To examine whether TAF-I remodels the chromatin consisting of histones, the chromatin structure was reconstituted on the DNA fragment with core histones by the salt dialysis method. The transcription from the reconstituted chromatin was completely repressed, while TAF-I remodeled the chromatin and stimulated the transcription. TAF-I was found to interact with histones. Furthermore, it was shown that TAF-I is capable not only of disrupting the chromatin structure but also of preventing the formation of DNA-histone aggregation and transferring histones to naked DNA.

The eukaryotic nucleosome, a unit of chromatin, consists of 146 base pairs (bp)1 of DNA and a histone octamer containing two copies each of histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. It has been thought that some modifications of the chromatin structure would be needed before the initiation of replication or transcription (reviewed in Ref. 1Wu C. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the gene activity is also regulated by enzymatic modification of histone octamer. Each histone possesses sites in its N-terminal region that can be hyperacetylated, and their acetylation and/or deacetylation are closely related to the gene activity (1Wu C. J. Biol.

Nature. 1997; 387: 16-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar).In order to study the molecular mechanism for activation of transcription and replication from chromatin templates, we have been using the adenovirus DNA complexed with the viral basic core proteins (Ad core) as a model system. The Ad genome is a double-stranded DNA of about 36,000 bp and forms the chromatin-like structure in the virion and in the infected cells. About 200 bp of DNA per viral nucleosome is coiled around six copies of the viral core protein VII, and each unit of viral nucleosome is bridged by the core protein V (13Corden J. Engelking H.M. Pearson G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Immediately after infection, early genes are transcribed, and some of their products together with the host factors NFI, II, and III put forward the genome DNA replication (14Hay R.T. Russell W.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 197-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized DNA does not remain naked but transiently forms a complex with the cellular histones (16Tate V.E. Philipson L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 2769-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Late genes are transcribed from the newly replicated DNA, and core proteins and other viral capsid proteins are synthesized. Since histones are not present in the Ad virion, cellular histones on the newly replicated viral DNA are to be removed and replaced with newly synthesized viral core proteins before being packaged into the progeny virus capsid. This type of replacement seems similar to that of histones with protamine during spermatogenesis. Although basic mechanisms for replication and transcription of the Ad genome DNA have been evaluated with in vitro systems using naked DNA templates, in vitro replication and transcription from the Ad core do not take place with the factors needed for these reactions on the naked DNA template (17Leith I.R. Hay R.T. Russell W.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 3235-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 18Matsumoto K. Nagata K. Ui M. Hanaoka F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9645-9650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Since the viral DNA in infected cells is also complexed with either basic viral core proteins or histones to form the chromatin structure, the access oftrans-acting factors involved in replication and transcription to their cognate sites is restricted. Therefore, it is reasonable to presume that the remodeling of the viral chromatin takes place before the initiation of replication and/or transcription.Recently, we have identified from uninfected HeLa cells template activating factor (TAF)-I, which stimulates the replication from the Ad core (18Matsumoto K. Nagata K. Ui M. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10582-10587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TAF-I also stimulates the transcription from the E1A promoter on the Ad core but not effectively from the major late promoter (MLP) (19Matsumoto K. Okuwaki M. Kawase H. Handa H. Hanaoka F. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9645-9650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). There are two subtypes of TAF-I, designated as TAF-Iα and TAF-Iβ, both of which have a common amino acid sequence except that N-terminal 30-amino acid sequences are specific for each subtype. TAF-I has a long acidic tail in its C-terminal region that is required for the activation of the Ad core replication and transcription (20Kawase H. Okuwaki M. Miyaji M. Ohba R. Handa H. Ishimi Y. Fujii-Nakata T. Kikuchi A. Nagata K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21Nagata K. Kawase H. Handa H. Yano K. Yamasaki M. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Matsumoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4279-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The stimulatory activity of TAF-Iβ is higher than that of TAF-Iα. TAF-Iβ is the same as the product of theset gene, which is fused to the can gene by the translocation in an acute undifferentiated leukemia (21Nagata K. Kawase H. Handa H. Yano K. Yamasaki M. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Matsumoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4279-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 22von Lindern M. van Baal S. Wiegant J. Raap A. Hagemeijer A. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 12: 3346-3355Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar). TAF-I shows low but distinct amino acid sequence homology to nucleosome assembly protein (NAP)-I, which was originally identified as the factor involved in chromatin assembly (23Ishimi Y. Hirosumi J. Sato W. Sugasawa K. Yokota S. Hanaoka F. Yamada M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It is indicated that NAP-I can replace for TAF-I in the stimulation of replication and transcription from the Ad core, and that TAF-I has NAP-I activity (20Kawase H. Okuwaki M. Miyaji M. Ohba R. Handa H. Ishimi Y. Fujii-Nakata T. Kikuchi A. Nagata K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21Nagata K. Kawase H. Handa H. Yano K. Yamasaki M. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Matsumoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4279-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Therefore, both proteins are structural and functional homologue of each other.Here we investigate the mechanisms for the stimulation of transcription by TAF-I from both E1A and ML promoters on the Ad core and the reconstituted chromatin consisting of histones. TAF-I stimulates the transcription not only from the E1A promoter on the Ad core but also from the chromatin template reconstituted on the DNA containing the MLP. The nuclease sensitivity assays have revealed that TAF-I stimulates the transcription from these templates by altering core protein-DNA or histone-DNA interaction. Furthermore, the Far Western analyses reveal that TAF-I binds to each core histone and its binding affinity to histone H3/H4 complex is higher than that to H2A/H2B complex. TAF-I binds to core histones through its acidic region and prevents the formation of aggregation between DNA and core histones. Our results lead to the possibility that one of the putative physiological functions of TAF-I may be to suppress the random aggregation of DNA-basic proteins such as DNA-histones. Since other proteins are also identified as histone chaperone, the redundancy of these histone chaperones raises the question how their roles are assigned and cooperated in a cell.DISCUSSIONWe have described the effects of TAF-I on the reconstituted chromatin. TAF-I was originally identified from HeLa cells as the factor that stimulates replication and transcription from the adenovirus DNA-core protein complex in a chromatin-like structure (18Matsumoto K. Nagata K. Ui M. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10582-10587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Matsumoto K. Okuwaki M. Kawase H. Handa H. Hanaoka F. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9645-9650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that TAF-I also stimulates transcription from the reconstituted chromatin consisting of core histones through the structural change of chromatin. Furthermore, it is shown that TAF-I suppresses random aggregation between DNA and histones.TAF-I remodels the Ad core structure on the E1A promoter region, while it does not have such an effect on the MLP region on the Ad core (Fig.1). In contrast, TAF-I is capable of stimulating the transcription and remodeling the structure of the reconstituted chromatin formed on the DNA fragment containing the MLP (Fig. 4). These results suggest that TAF-I would not have any specificity of DNA sequence, although the MLP on the Ad core is not effectively remodeled by TAF-I. The contradiction of these results would be explained by the difference of the Ad core structure between the E1A promoter and MLP regions. The MLP region may be packed more compactly than E1A promoter region and the MLP in the reconstituted nucleosome. In fact, when the Ad core is used as a template for the transcription, the stimulation of the transcription from the MLP is dependent on the genome DNA replication (19Matsumoto K. Okuwaki M. Kawase H. Handa H. Hanaoka F. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9645-9650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It is presumed that the MLP region on the Ad core would be much more insensitive to TAF-I than the E1A promoter region on the Ad core and the MLP in the reconstituted chromatin. Therefore, the structural change of the Ad core within the MLP region coupled with the genome DNA replication would be needed for the transcription from the MLP. In infected cells, the transcription from the MLP is activated dramatically after the onset of the genome DNA replication compared with its transcription activity in early phases of infection. The molecular basis of this transcription switching between early and late phases via replication has not been well clarified. The transcription activation from the MLP by the switch could not be explained simply by the increase of the genome copy number. The Ad genome is complexed with viral basic core proteins in the virion and in the cell during early stages of infection, and newly synthesized DNA would be complexed with histones of host cells and assembled into the chromatin structure following the genome replication (16Tate V.E. Philipson L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 2769-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). When replication occurs, the Ad core structure is drastically disrupted and trans-acting factors could easily gain access to the parental genome template and/or the newly synthesized DNA. It is suggested that the chromatin structure would be reconstituted on the newly synthesized DNA complexed with transcription factors. Workman et al. (30Workman J.L. Roeder R.G. Kingston R.E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1299-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the transcription from chromatin reconstituted on the DNA in the presence of MLTF/USF is active, while the transcription from the chromatin template reconstituted without MLTF/USF is repressed. The mechanism of the transcription activation from the MLP bytrans-acting chromatin remodeling factors is the other possibility as we have demonstrated in this study. More precise studies are needed because the transcription level relieved by TAF-I is only 10–20% of that on the naked DNA. These observations raise the possibility that TAF-I may cooperate with other factors in remodeling the chromatin structure in vivo.SWI/SNF, NURF, and other factors that require ATP hydrolysis are suggested to function together with sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. Recently, Mizuguchi et al. (31Mizuguchi G. Tsukiyama T. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 141-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) demonstrated that NURF complexes remodel the chromatin structure and stimulate the transcription dependent on GAL4 fused to HSF. Because the process of the transcription activation from the MLP involves the binding of promoter specific transcription factors such as MLTF/USF, it is possible that the chromatin structure in the MLP region is remodeled by SWI/SNF or NURF-like complexes. Since the DNA fragment used in this study contains the binding sites described above, our system would be useful to further assign roles of these factors. Furthermore, Orphanides et al. (32Orphanides G. LeRoy G. Chang C.H. Luse D.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1998; 92: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) reported that NTP-hydrolysis independent accessory factor, termed FACT, is needed for the elongation step of the transcription from the chromatin templates, although the detailed mechanism of the reaction mediated by FACT is unknown at present. The functional nature of FACT would be different from that of the factors that function as histone chaperone including TAF-I, since FACT cannot remodel the chromatin structure.TAF-I also suppresses the random aggregation of histones, possibly through complex formation with core histones as shown in Figs. 5 and 6. NAP-I and nucleoplasmin and N1/N2 and CAF-I bind preferentially to histones H2A/H2B and histones H3/H4, respectively (reviewed in Ref.33Ito T. Tyler J.K. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This study showed that TAF-I preferentially interacts with histones H3/H4 rather than H2A/H2B, although more precise experiments under physiological conditions are needed. Since there are a variety of acidic proteins that have the histone binding activity (35Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1479-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the function of each protein and its behavior within a cell should be carefully investigated. In addition, the histone-DNA complex formed by TAF-I would not be a complete chromatin structure. The glycerol gradient assay indicated that the Ad core treated with TAF-I forms the tertiary complex (Fig. 2). Since the mobility of the major nucleoprotein complex in the presence of TAF-I as shown inlane 7 of Fig. 6 was similar to that of the reconstituted chromatin, TAF-I would not be present in the complex. However, it is possible that TAF-I is present in complexes tailing toward the gel origin. It has been reported that NAP-I assembles the chromatin structure cooperatively with ATP-dependent complex (34Ito T. Bulger M. Pazin M.J. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 90: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). It is possible that the nucleoprotein complex formed by TAF-I (Fig. 6) is loosely assembled and another factor would be needed to form the complete chromatin structure. It has been shown that polyanions such as polyglutamic acid and bulk RNA are also able to prevent the random aggregation between DNA and histones, and mediate the histone transfer process (reviewed in Refs. 33Ito T. Tyler J.K. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar and 35Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1479-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The internal deletion mutant of TAF-Iβ, which has the same long acidic tail as wild type TAF-Iβ, loses the stimulatory activity for the replication from the Ad core (20Kawase H. Okuwaki M. Miyaji M. Ohba R. Handa H. Ishimi Y. Fujii-Nakata T. Kikuchi A. Nagata K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), suggesting that not only acidity but also the proper conformation of the acidic region in TAF-I is required for its activity.The function of TAF-I in vivo is unknown. It is reported that components of SWI/SNF complex are enriched in the active chromatin and nuclear matrix fractions (36Reyes J.C. Muchardt C. Yaniv M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). From the fact that TAF-I has been originally purified from cytoplasm fractions, TAF-I seems to leaked out easily from the nucleus, although TAF-I has a nuclear localization signal and it is retained in the nucleus in part through its acidic region (29Nagata K. Saito S. Okuwaki M. Kawase H. Furuya A. Hanai N. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It is an open question how the TAF-I activities for disruption of the chromatin structure and prevention of random aggregation between DNA and histones are controlled in a cell. Since the level of TAF-I proteins are not significantly fluctuated through the cell cycle (29Nagata K. Saito S. Okuwaki M. Kawase H. Furuya A. Hanai N. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), qualitative change rather than quantitative change would be needed. It is tentatively speculated that some modifications may operate in the regulation of the TAF-I activity. Recently, it has been reported that Xenopus TAF-Iβ homologue specifically binds to a B-type cyclin (37Kellogg D.R. Kikuchi A. Fujii-Nakata T. Turck C.W. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Human TAF-I is found to inhibit the activity of protein phosphatase 2A (38Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11059-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) by the multi-protein complex formation (39Adler H.T. Nallaseth F.S. Walter G. Tkachuk D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28407-28414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Based on these facts, the TAF-I activity is possibly regulated during the cell cycle by phosphorylation and/or TAF-I may regulate phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. On this line, TAF-Iβ has shown to be phosphorylated in vivo in its N-terminal region (40Adachi Y. Pavlakis G.N. Copeland T.D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), although a specific kinase(s) that phosphorylates TAF-I is unknown. From these observations, TAF-I would be a multi-functional protein. The eukaryotic nucleosome, a unit of chromatin, consists of 146 base pairs (bp)1 of DNA and a histone octamer containing two copies each of histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. It has been thought that some modifications of the chromatin structure would be needed before the initiation of replication or transcription (reviewed in Ref. 1Wu C. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the gene activity is also regulated by enzymatic modification of histone octamer. Each histone possesses sites in its N-terminal region that can be hyperacetylated, and their acetylation and/or deacetylation are closely related to the gene activity (1Wu C. J. Biol.

In order to study the molecular mechanism for activation of transcription and replication from chromatin templates, we have been using the adenovirus DNA complexed with the viral basic core proteins (Ad core) as a model system. The Ad genome is a double-stranded DNA of about 36,000 bp and forms the chromatin-like structure in the virion and in the infected cells. About 200 bp of DNA per viral nucleosome is coiled around six copies of the viral core protein VII, and each unit of viral nucleosome is bridged by the core protein V (13Corden J. Engelking H.M. Pearson G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Immediately after infection, early genes are transcribed, and some of their products together with the host factors NFI, II, and III put forward the genome DNA replication (14Hay R.T. Russell W.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 197-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized DNA does not remain naked but transiently forms a complex with the cellular histones (16Tate V.E. Philipson L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 2769-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Late genes are transcribed from the newly replicated DNA, and core proteins and other viral capsid proteins are synthesized. Since histones are not present in the Ad virion, cellular histones on the newly replicated viral DNA are to be removed and replaced with newly synthesized viral core proteins before being packaged into the progeny virus capsid. This type of replacement seems similar to that of histones with protamine during spermatogenesis. Although basic mechanisms for replication and transcription of the Ad genome DNA have been evaluated with in vitro systems using naked DNA templates, in vitro replication and transcription from the Ad core do not take place with the factors needed for these reactions on the naked DNA template (17Leith I.R. Hay R.T. Russell W.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 3235-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 18Matsumoto K. Nagata K. Ui M. Hanaoka F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9645-9650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Since the viral DNA in infected cells is also complexed with either basic viral core proteins or histones to form the chromatin structure, the access oftrans-acting factors involved in replication and transcription to their cognate sites is restricted. Therefore, it is reasonable to presume that the remodeling of the viral chromatin takes place before the initiation of replication and/or transcription. Recently, we have identified from uninfected HeLa cells template activating factor (TAF)-I, which stimulates the replication from the Ad core (18Matsumoto K. Nagata K. Ui M. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10582-10587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TAF-I also stimulates the transcription from the E1A promoter on the Ad core but not effectively from the major late promoter (MLP) (19Matsumoto K. Okuwaki M. Kawase H. Handa H. Hanaoka F. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9645-9650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). There are two subtypes of TAF-I, designated as TAF-Iα and TAF-Iβ, both of which have a common amino acid sequence except that N-terminal 30-amino acid sequences are specific for each subtype. TAF-I has a long acidic tail in its C-terminal region that is required for the activation of the Ad core replication and transcription (20Kawase H. Okuwaki M. Miyaji M. Ohba R. Handa H. Ishimi Y.

Matsumoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4279-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The stimulatory activity of TAF-Iβ is higher than that of TAF-Iα. TAF-Iβ is the same as the product of theset gene, which is fused to the can gene by the translocation in an acute undifferentiated leukemia (21Nagata K. Kawase H. Handa H. Yano K. Yamasaki M.

Hagemeijer A. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 12: 3346-3355Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar). TAF-I shows low but distinct amino acid sequence homology to nucleosome assembly protein (NAP)-I, which was originally identified as the factor involved in chromatin assembly (23Ishimi Y. Hirosumi J. Sato W. Sugasawa K. Yokota S. Hanaoka F. Yamada M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It is indicated that NAP-I can replace for TAF-I in the stimulation of replication and transcription from the Ad core, and that TAF-I has NAP-I activity (20Kawase H. Okuwaki M. Miyaji M. Ohba R.

In this paper, we show that a synthetic analog of theMycoplasma fermentans membrane-associated lipopeptide macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2 (MALP-2) induces mRNA synthesis and protein secretion of interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α in human monocytes/macrophages and the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, whereas the nonlipidated counterpart lacks this effect, underscoring the importance of protein acylation for cell activation. Synthetic MALP-2 (sMALP-2) induced the activation of MAPK family members extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and p38 and induced NF-κB and AP-1 transactivation in macrophages. Whereas the specific p38 inhibitor SB203580 abrogated both cytokine synthesis and NF-κB and AP-1 transactivation in response to MALP-2, the selective MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 inhibitor PD-98059 decreased interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α production in response to sMALP-2 without affecting the transactivation of NF-κB or AP-1. These results indicate that activation of MAPKs by sMALP-2 is a crucial event leading to the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Our findings demonstrate that the synthetic analog of MALP-2 reproduces the macrophage stimulation activity found in different fractions of mycoplasmas. Given that MALP-2 has been recently shown to be expressed at the surface of M. fermentans as a molecular entity, sMALP-2 constitutes a valuable surrogate for investigating immunomodulation by these microorganisms and evaluating the role that this activity plays in the development of inflammatory diseases associated with mycoplasma infections. Mycoplasma lipoproteins have been demonstrated to stimulate monocytic cells and induce proinflammatory cytokine secretion. In this paper, we show that a synthetic analog of theMycoplasma fermentans membrane-associated lipopeptide macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2 (MALP-2) induces mRNA synthesis and protein secretion of interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α in human monocytes/macrophages and the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, whereas the nonlipidated counterpart lacks this effect, underscoring the importance of protein acylation for cell activation.

Mycoplasma fermentans, a human pathogen, is a potent activator of monocytes/macrophages. Macrophage activation by M. fermentans results in the secretion of numerous cytokines including interleukin (IL)1-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) (1Rawadi G. Roman-Roman S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 637-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Rawadi G. Roman-Roman S. Castedo M. Dutilleul V. Susin S. Marchetti P. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. J.

Other inflammation mediators such as NO have also been shown to be produced by macrophages in response to mycoplasmas (3Mühlradt P.F. Frisch M. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3801-3807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mycoplasmas, the smallest self-replicating bacteria, are characterized by a wall-less envelope (4$$Google Scholar); thus, they are LPS-free pathogens. We have previously demonstrated that mycoplasma membrane lipoproteins (lipid-associated membrane proteins; LAMPs) are responsible for human and murine macrophage activation (1Rawadi G. Roman-Roman S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 637-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Rawadi G. Roman-Roman S. Castedo M. Dutilleul V. Susin S. Marchetti P. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. J.

Although the signaling pathways triggered in macrophages by both M. fermentans LAMP and Gram-negative bacteria LPS are comparable, unlike LPS, M. fermentans LAMP activity does not require binding to CD14 or serum proteins (5Rawadi G. Ramez V. Lemercier B. Roman-Roman S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1330-1339PubMed Google Scholar). M. fermentans LAMP activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 (5Rawadi G. Ramez V. Lemercier B. Roman-Roman S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1330-1339PubMed Google Scholar). MAPKs have been shown to be involved in M. fermentans LAMP-mediated cytokine induction, since selective inhibitors of these pathways have been shown to impair M. fermentans LAMP-mediated cytokine production by human and murine macrophages. Initial partial biochemical characterization of an M. fermentans-derived high molecular weight material that activates macrophages suggested that it was an amphiphilic lipid-like molecule (3Mühlradt P.F. Frisch M. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3801-3807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies led to the identification of an acylatedS-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cysteine, typical for Braun's murein lipoprotein, in a lipopeptide purified from M. fermentans-derived high molecular weight material (6Mühlradt P.F. Meyer H. Jansen R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7781-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This suggested that this lipopeptide could be the macrophage-activating agent of M. fermentans-derived high molecular weight material. Very recently, the same group has elucidated the structure of this lipopeptide, named MALP-2 (formacrophage-activatinglipopeptide) (7Mühlradt P.F. Kiess M. Meyer H. Sussmuth R. Jung G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). MALP-2 is a 2-kDa free NH2 terminus lipopeptide with the following structure:S-(2,3-bisacyloxyprolyl)cysteine-GNNDESNISFKEK. Interestingly, M. fermentans-derived MALP-2 as well as its synthetic analog induced NO release from murine macrophages and showed an identical dose-dependent effect (7Mühlradt P.F. Kiess M. Meyer H. Sussmuth R. Jung G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have tested the capacity of synthetic MALP-2 (sMALP-2) to stimulate cytokine production by macrophages and activate MAPK pathways. Additionally, we have investigated the activation of NF-κB and AP-1, two transcription factors playing a role in the induction of proinflammatory cytokines, in macrophages challenged with sMALP-2. sMALP-2 stimulatory effects on macrophages were fully comparable with those previously found with M. fermentanslipoproteins, suggesting that lipopeptides derived from mycoplasmas might constitute excellent tools for better understanding the immunomodulation mediated by mycoplasmas and the role of this property in the pathogeny of these microorganisms. PD-98059 and GST-c-Jun-(1–79) were obtained from Biomol Research Laboratories (Philadelphia, PA). SB203580 was from Calbiochem (Nottingham, United Kingdom).

Acylated peptide was resuspended in 25 mm octyl glucoside in phosphate-buffered saline. The detergent had no effects on cells at the final used concentration. Lipopeptide preparation was tested for absence of endotoxin (<60 pg/ml) by Limulus amoebocytelysate assay (Hemachem, St. Louis, MO). The murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) was cultured (37 °C, 5% CO2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. The human monocytic cell line THP-1 (American Type Culture Collection) was cultured (37 °C, 5% CO2) in RPMI culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. Cell lines were tested every 2 weeks by a polymerase chain reaction-based detection assay for mycoplasma contamination (10Rawadi G. Lecaque D. Pirot D. Roman-Roman S. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 4: 147-156Google Scholar). For stimulation experiments, cells were seeded at 106 cells/ml density and then allowed to cultivate overnight. Cells were stimulated with sMALP-2 (at 200 nm) for appropriate time intervals. LPS was used in control experiments at 1 μg/ml to stimulate RAW 264.7 cells and at 100 ng/ml to stimulate THP-1 cells. For phosphotransferase assays, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3VO4. For each 106cells initially seeded, 100 μl of the following lysis buffer was added: 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 75 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Lysis was performed at 4 °C for 20 min with continuous shaking. Cell lysates were centrifuged (10.000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration in cell lysates was determined by a micro-BCA assay (Pierce). Human monocytes/macrophages were prepared from healthy donors' peripheral blood mononuclear cells by Ficoll/Hypaque density gradient centrifugation (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 50 × 106peripheral blood mononuclear cells were adhered to six-well tissue culture plates (Costar) for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% human serum (Centre National de Transfusion Sanguine, Saint Antoine, France), 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. To remove nonadherent cells, wells were washed twice with prewarmed culture medium. Adherent cells (approximately 5 × 106 cells) were cultured (37 °C, 5% CO2) in 5 ml of culture medium with or without stimulus. Chinese hamster ovary cell lines expressing human CD14 (CHO-CD14) and harboring the empty expression vector (CHO-RSV) were gifts from Dr. R. J. Ulevitch (11Kravchenko V.V. Steinemann S. Kline L. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. Shock. 1996; 5: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). CHO-CD14 and CHO-RSV cell lines were grown in RPMI culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, antibiotics, and G418 (500 μg/ml). Cells were stimulated as indicated above for a 24-h period and were lysed by two consecutive cycles of freezing/thawing. Thus, the samples represented the total amount of cytokines produced (both intracellular and released into the supernatant). The cytokine concentration from murine or human macrophages was measured by a corresponding IL-1β and TNFα ELISA kit. The assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were stimulated as described above at the indicated times, and total RNA was extracted from 107 cells using the total RNA isolation kit from Bioprobe (Montreuil, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Using Hybond-N+ filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), slot RNA were performed with 5–10 μg of RNA as described by Sambrook et al. (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and slots were UV-cross-linked. Specific murine IL-1β and TNFα oligonucleotide probes were fromCLONTECH Laboratories (Heidelberg, Germany). The amount of RNA in each sample was normalized by probing for β-actin. All probes were labeled by a 5′-DNA labeling system with [γ-32P]dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Slots were prehybridized in 6× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml of denatured salmon sperm DNA for 2 h at 42 °C. An overnight hybridization was performed at 42 °C in the same buffer containing the probe at 2.5 × 105 cpm/ml. The membrane was then washed twice for 10 min in 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS at room temperature and once in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C. Slots were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and quantitatively assessed by means of ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). ERK1/2 and JNK were immunoprecipitated by incubating 500 μg of cell lysates with 5 μg of anti-ERK1-CT antibody or 2 μg of anti-JNK1 antibody, respectively, at 4 °C for 4 h with continuous rotation. Then 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added, and the incubation was extended for an additional 2 h. The mixtures were then centrifuged (7000 × g for 2 min at room temperature), and protein A-Sepharose beads were washed three times with buffer B (12.5 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 0.5 mmEGTA, 12.5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 7.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing 250 mm NaCl. The beads were resuspended in 50 μl of buffer B containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm MnCl2 for phosphotransferase. For p38 immunoprecipitation, the protocol was slightly modified. 10 μg of anti-p38 antibody was first coupled to A/G-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C and then washed with buffer B and added to 500 μg of cell lysates. Immunoprecipitation was allowed overnight at 4 °C with continuous rotation, and immunoprecipitates were analyzed as described above. ERK and p38 activation was determined in immunoprecipitates by means of measuring radioactively their respective phosphotransferase activities toward a peptide substrate using p42/44MAPK or p38/Mpk2 detection kits. Assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Activity was expressed as [32P]ATP cpm. To measure JNK activation, 2 μg of GST-c-Jun was added to stress-activated protein kinase/JNK immunoprecipitates in the presence 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were conducted at 30 °C for 30 min and then terminated by adding SDS sampler buffer to 1× final concentration. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 12% gels. Gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid and 50% methanol and then embedded in cellophane sheets, dried, and autoradiographed. Cells were stimulated with sMALP-2 at indicated time intervals, nuclear extracts were prepared as described in Ref. 13Stein B. Kramer M. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ponta H. Herrlich P. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4540-4544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and protein content was determined by micro-BCA assay (Pierce). NF-κB and AP-1 binding activity in nuclei of uninduced and induced cells was determined by an electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay (EMSA) as described in Ref. 14$$Google Scholar using 2–4 μg of nuclear proteins. EMSA gels were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and quantitatively assessed by means of ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Supershift experiments were performed by preincubating nuclear extracts with anti-Rel family antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C before carrying out EMSA. The NF-κB, AP-1, and NF-AT (15Baldari C.T. Milia E.

RAW 264.7 cells were grown up to 80% confluence and then transfected with the indicated plasmids by the electroporation method as described by Stacey et al. (17Stacey K.J. Ross I.L. Hume D.A. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 75-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CHO-CD14 and CHO-RSV cells were grown at 80% confluence and transfected with 15 μg of the indicated reporter plasmid by electroporation as described in Ref. 18Taghian D.G. Nickoloff J.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 48: 115-121PubMed Google Scholar. Transfected cells were cultured in growth medium for an overnight period and then stimulated or not stimulated with sMALP-2 (200 nm), LPS (1 μg/ml) for 6 h. In control experiments, transfected cells were stimulated with PMA (50 ng/ml) or PMA (50 ng/ml) plus A23178 (2 μg/ml). Cells were then harvested, and luciferase activity was determined as described by Brasier (19Brasier A.R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing/John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 9.6.1-9.6.14Google Scholar) using an automated luminometer (Lumat LB 9501, EG1G Berthod, Wilbad, Germany). Cell lysates were analyzed for protein content using the micro-BCA assay (Pierce), and luminescence units were normalized for total protein content. Luciferase activities are reported as means of values from four independent experiments, each performed in duplicate. M. fermentans sMALP-2 has been demonstrated to induce NO release from mouse macrophages (7Mühlradt P.F. Kiess M. Meyer H. Sussmuth R. Jung G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). First, we have investigated the potential ability of sMALP-2 to stimulate cytokine production by monocytic cells. The murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was challenged with increased concentration of sMALP-2, and TNFα production level was determined by ELISA. TNFα could be detected in RAW 264.7 supernatant when cells were stimulated with sMALP-2 at concentrations higher then 50 nm; the lowest doses did not stimulate TNFα production (Fig.1 A). In a 100–600 nm concentration range of sMALP-2, the TNFα level secreted by RAW 264.7 cells was found to be dose-dependent. A similar dose-response curve was obtained when measuring IL-1β production by murine macrophages under identical conditions (data not shown). In following experiments, sMALP-2 was used at 200 nm concentration; however, in some inhibition experiments the highest concentrations were applied. sMALP-2 preincubation with polymyxin B (1000 units/ml) for 2 h before its addition to cell cultures had no effect on TNFα production, whereas polymyxin B completely abolished TNFα induction by LPS (data not shown). These data and the results of the Limulus amoebocytelysate assay (see “Experimental procedures”) clearly indicate that the stimulatory effect of sMALP-2 preparations are not to be ascribed to endotoxin contamination. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, sMALP-2 at 200 nm induced the production of a considerable amount of IL-1β and TNFα by murine macrophage RAW 264.7 (Fig. 1 B) and by human monocytes/macrophages as well (Fig. 1 C). Similar results were obtained using the human myelomonocytic cell line THP-1 (data not shown). When human monocytes/macrophages or murine macrophages RAW 264.7 were challenged with LPS, TNFα, and IL-1β secretion levels were comparable with those obtained in response to sMALP-2 (Fig. 1, B and C). The nonlipidated form of MALP-2 failed to induce cytokine production by both human monocytes/macrophages and RAW 264.7 cells. In addition, tripalmitoylS-glycerylcysteine was unable to stimulate cytokine production by these cells (Fig. 1, B and C). These findings demonstrate that lipid modification of MALP-2 peptide is required for macrophage stimulation and cytokine production. We have further examined the levels of cytokine mRNA in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with sMALP-2. Data from RNA slot hybridization, presented in Fig. 1 D, clearly show that sMALP-2 stimulated IL-1β and TNFα mRNA synthesis, with a peak accumulation found at about 4 h after challenge. Previous reports have strongly suggested that mycoplasma-derived membrane fractions stimulate monocytes/macrophages by a mechanism distinct from that of LPS and independent of CD14 and/or serum (1Rawadi G. Roman-Roman S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 637-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Rawadi G. Ramez V. Lemercier B. Roman-Roman S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1330-1339PubMed Google Scholar,20Kostyal D.A. Butler G.H. Beezhold D.H. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3793-3800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have therefore investigated whether sMALP-2 was able to induce NF-κB and AP-1 transactivation in CHO cells expressing human CD14 (11Kravchenko V.V. Steinemann S. Kline L. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. Shock. 1996; 5: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). CHO cells expressing CD14 (CHO-CD14) were transiently transfected with NF-κB or AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmid, and then cells were stimulated with LPS and sMALP-2. CHO cells harboring the empty expression vector (CHO-RSV) were transiently transfected with reporter plasmids and stimulated as described above. As expected, LPS induced an important luciferase activity (4–5-fold increases) in CHO-CD14 cells transfected with either NF-κB or AP-1 reporter plasmids, while no activation could be observed with CHO-RSV under similar conditions (Fig. 2). On the contrary, sMALP-2 induced neither NF-κB nor AP-1 transactivation in transfected CHO-CD14 cells (Fig. 2), even when it was used at higher concentrations (data not shown). Control experiments were performed by stimulating transfected cells with PMA. In both CHO-CD14- and CHO-RSV-transfected cells, PMA stimulated NF-κB and AP-1 transactivation (Fig. 2). These data suggest that, unlike LPS, sMALP-2 does not require CD14 for cell stimulation. MAPKs are key molecules involved in macrophage activation by different bacterial products. We have therefore investigated the activation of the well characterized MAPKs, ERK1/2, p38, and JNK, in RAW 264.7 cells challenged with sMALP-2. Data presented in Fig. 3 clearly indicate that sMALP-2 significantly induced activation of all of the tested kinases. LPS has also been shown to induce activation of MAPKs in murine macrophages (21Sanghera J.S. Weinstein S.L. Aluwalia M. Girn J. Pelech S.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4457-4465PubMed Google Scholar). MAPK activation kinetics in RAW 264.7 stimulated by LPS and sMALP-2 were compared. As shown in Fig. 3, LPS peak activation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK was found at 15 min after stimulation, while peak activation of these kinases occurred at 30 min after challenge with sMALP-2. The kinetics of MAPK activation by sMALP-2 were comparable with those obtained when cells were stimulated with a crude extract of M. fermentans membrane lipoproteins (5Rawadi G. Ramez V. Lemercier B. Roman-Roman S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1330-1339PubMed Google Scholar). A similar pattern of MAPK activation was observed in human monocytes/macrophages and the THP-1 cell line stimulated with sMALP-2 (data not shown). Transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 are involved in the transcription of a variety of genes, including proinflammatory cytokines, during the immune response (22Foletta V.C. Segal D.H. Cohen D.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 23Adcock I.M. Monaldi Arch. Chest Dis. 1997; 52: 178-186PubMed Google Scholar, 24Wulczyn F.G. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 749-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Thus, we have addressed the ability of sMALP-2 to activate nuclear translocation of the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1. Using 32P-labeled oligonucleotides containing consensus NF-κB or AP-1, we have performed EMSAs on nuclear extracts from RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with sMALP-2. As demonstrated in the Fig.4, sMALP-2 was capable of inducing both NF-κB and AP-1 translocation. The specificity of AP-1 and NF-κB DNA biding were verified by competition analysis with an excess of nonradiolabeled probes. NF-κB and AP-1 activation by sMALP-2 was found to be dose-dependent, and transcription factors were detectable starting from 100 nm of sMALP-2 concentration, confirming data presented in Fig. 1 (data not shown). As depicted in Fig. 4 A, similarly to the MAPK activation, LPS-mediated NF-κB translocation was more rapid (with a peak found at 2 h of stimulation) than that observed with sMALP-2 (peak at 4 h). The kinetics of NF-κB activation mediated by LPS reported herein were comparable with those previously described by Tebo et al. (25Tebo J.M. Chaoqun W. Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4713-4720PubMed Google Scholar). We have further investigated by means of EMSA supershift the NF-κB isoforms induced by sMALP-2. The NF-κB p65 and p50 antibodies supershifted the protein complex, whereas c-Rel and RelB antibodies did not modify the pattern (data not shown), indicating that a p65/p50 heterodimer accounts for the NF-κB-translocated form. sMALP-2 also activated AP-1 translocation in RAW 264.7 cells, and peak activity was observed at 4 h of stimulation. Although a basal AP-1 activation could be detected in these cells, PhosphorImager quantification of EMSA gels clearly shows that sMALP-2 induced a 4–5-fold increase in AP-1 DNA binding activity compared with control level (Fig. 4 B). Once again, AP-1 translocation in response to LPS occurred earlier (peak at 2 h) than that induced by sMALP-2 (data not shown). Pursuing the investigation of AP-1 and NF-κB induction by sMALP-2, we have studied the transactivation ability of these factors by means of luciferase reporter plasmids. RAW 264.7 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids containing the AP-1- or NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter gene and then stimulated with sMALP-2, and luciferase activity was determined in cell lysates. As demonstrated in Fig. 5, sMALP-2 induced a 3-fold increase in luciferase activity in cells transfected by either AP-1 or NF-κB reporter plasmid, indicating that the translocated factors can mediate transactivation. sMALP-2 failed to induce transactivation of the T cell-specific transcription factor NF-AT-dependent luciferase reporter gene. As a positive control, stimulation of NF-AT-transfected RAW 264.7 cells with PMA/A23187 (26Mège D. Di Bartolo V. Germain V. Tuosto L. Michel F. Acuto O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32644-32652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) induced a 4-fold increase in specific luciferase activity (data not shown). Comparable levels of NF-κB- and AP-1-mediated luciferase induction were observed in LPS stimulation experiments (Fig. 5). sMALP-2 also induced AP-1- and NF-κB-dependent luciferase expression in THP-1 cells (data not shown). To examine the involvement of MAPK activation in sMALP-2-mediated cytokine production, we have used the specific inhibitors of MAPK pathways, SB203580 and PD-98059 (27Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P.

At the highest used concentration, these two inhibitors, PD-98059 and SB203580, did not induce any cell toxicity as determined by microscopic observation and trypan blue uptake (data not shown).

In this study, we report the partial purification and characterization of the membrane bound, neutral pH optimal, and magnesium-dependent SMase (N-SMase) from rat brain. Proteins from Triton X-100 extract of brain membrane were purified sequentially with DEAE-Sephacel, heparin-Sepharose, ceramic hydroxyapatite, Mono Q, phenyl-Superose, and Superose 12 column chromatography. After eight purification steps, the specific activity of the enzyme increased by 3030-fold over the brain homogenate. The enzyme hydrolyzed sphingomyelin but not phosphatidylcholine and its activity was dependent upon magnesium with an optimal pH of 7.5 and a native pI of 5.2. Delipidation of the enzyme through chromatographic purification or by extraction with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid followed by gel filtration revealed that the enzyme became increasingly dependent on phosphatidylserine (PS). Up to 20-fold stimulation was observed with PS whereas other lipids examined were either ineffective or only mildly stimulatory. The K m of the enzyme for substrate sphingomyelin (3.4 mol %) was not affected by PS. The highly purified enzyme was inhibited by glutathione with a >95% inhibition observed with 3 mm glutathione and with a Hill number calculated at approximately 8.

Sphingomyelinase (SMase)1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of membrane sphingomyelin to generate ceramide and phosphorylcholine. Multiple forms of SMases have been described and they include the lysosomal acidic SMase (A-SMase), the cytosolic Zn2+-dependent acidic SMase, the membrane neutral magenesium-dependent SMase (N-SMase), the cytosolic magnesium-independent N-SMase, and the alkaline SMase (1Liu B. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Activation of SMases, especially the A-SMase and N-SMase, in cells in response to growth factors, cytokines, chemotherapeutic agents, irradiation, nutrient removal, and stress conditions are believed to be involved in regulation of cell growth, differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and programmed cell death (1Liu B.

In the past few years, increased attention has been focused on the neutral magnesium-dependent SMase (N-SMase) for its role in mediating a variety of cellular processes including differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and programmed cell death (apoptosis) through the generation of ceramide (1Liu B.

Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 506-515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lack of information on its biochemical characteristics and especially cellular regulation has significantly handicapped efforts to delineate pathways involving this enzyme. Therefore, it is evident that a great need exists for its purification and biochemical characterization. In this study, we report a significant purification of N-SMase from rat brain membranes, biochemical characteristics of the purified enzyme, its activation by phosphatidylserine, and inhibition by glutathione (GSH).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsFrozen stripped rat brains were purchased from Pel Freez Biologicals (Rogers, AK) and stored at −80 °C. All chromatographic media were obtained from Pharmacia (Piscataway, NJ) unless indicated otherwise. Ceramic hydroxyapatite was from American International Chemical (Natick, MA). Triton X-100 was purchased from Boehringer-Mannheim.N-[methyl- 14C]Sphingomyelin was synthesized as previously described (19Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Domae N. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4070-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine brain sphingomyelin was from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Bovine brainl-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine was from Sigma. Other lipids were from Sigma or Avanti Polar Lipids.MethodsPreparation of Detergent Extract of Rat Brain Membrane ProteinsThe entire purification process was performed at 4 °C. Seven rat brains were thawed and the cerebella and brain stem, which are particularly enriched in acid SMase (20Sperker E.R. Spence M.W. J. Neurochem. 1983; 40: 1182-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), were removed. The remainder of the brain tissues (7 g) were minced and homogenized with a motor-driven Teflon pestle glass homogenizer at highest speed in 5 volumes of homogenizing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium molybdate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A). The brain tissues were homogenized for 3 rounds of 10 passes each, and the crude homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 1,000 × g. The supernatant was designated as the postnuclear supernatant (PNS). The pellet was re-homogenized in 2 volumes of homogenizing buffer and the supernatants were combined. To remove peripheral membrane proteins, the PNS was incubated for 30 min with 0.5 m NaCl and 5 mm EDTA (final concentrations) and the mixture was then centrifuged for 90 min at 105,000 × g. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 50 ml of 1% Triton X-100 in homogenizing buffer and the detergent/membrane mixture was rocked for 60 min. Afterward, the mixture was centrifuged for 90 min at 105,000 ×g. The supernatant was designated as the Triton X-100 solubilized membrane proteins and was used for column chromatography.DEAE SephacelA DEAE-Sephacel column (Pharmacia HR 10/10, 8 ml) was connected to a Pharmacia Automated FPLC system and equilibrated in buffer A consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.005% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and an inhibitor mixture (1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 0.2 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium molybdate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A). The Triton X-100-solublized membrane proteins were diluted with 1 volume of buffer A and loaded onto the DEAE column. After sample loading, the column was washed with 100 ml of buffer A followed by a 15-ml linear gradient of 0–100% buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1m NaCl, 0.005% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and the inhibitor mixture) and then maintained for 100 ml at 100% buffer B. The column was finally eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 100% of buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and the inhibitor mixture) over 100 ml. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/ml, and fractions of 5 ml were collected. Fractions containing N-SMase activities eluted by the Triton X-100 gradient were pooled and buffer exchanged to buffer A using PD-10 columns (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Heparin-Sepharose CL-6BDesalted DEAE fractions were loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (Pharmacia HR16/10, 20 ml) equilibrated in buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and the inhibitor mixture). After sample loading, column was washed with 100 ml of buffer D and then eluted with a 60-ml linear gradient of 0–100% buffer E (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and the inhibitor mixture). The flow rate was 0.25 ml/min and fractions of 4 ml were collected into tubes containing 0.4 ml of 75% glycerol. The flow-through fractions containing N-SMase activity were pooled and concentrated to 5 ml using the Macrosep concentrators (10-kDa cutoff, Pall Filtron, Northborough, MA).HydroxyapatiteThe concentrated heparin fractions were buffer-exchanged using the PD-10 columns to buffer E (10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and the inhibitor mixture) and loaded onto a ceramic hydroxyapatite column (Pharmacia HR 10/10 column, 8 ml) equilibrated in buffer E. After sample loading, the column was washed with 40 ml of buffer E followed by a shallow gradient of 0–25% of buffer F (500 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and the inhibitor mixture) over 140 ml. The column was then eluted by stepping to 100% buffer F over 4 ml and maintaining at 100% buffer F for 40 ml. The flow rate was 0.25 ml/min. Fractions (4 ml) were collected into tubes preloaded with 8 μl each of 0.5 m EDTA and EGTA (1 mm final concentration). Fractions with N-SMase activity were pooled and concentrated to 10 ml with the Macrosep concentrators (10K).Mono QThe concentrated hydroxyapatite fractions were loaded onto a 1-ml Mono Q column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in buffer G (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, and the inhibitor mixture). After sample loading, the column was washed with 10 ml of buffer G followed by a linear gradient of 0–50% of buffer H (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, and the inhibitor mixture) over 40 ml. Afterward, the gradient was stepped to 100% buffer H over 2 ml and maintained at 100% buffer H for 10 ml. The flow rate was 0.2 ml/min and fractions of 1 ml were collected. Fractions containing N-SMase activity were pooled and concentrated to 5 ml with the Macrosep concentrators (10K).Phenyl-SuperoseThe concentrated Mono Q fractions were adjusted to 2 m NaCl with 5 m NaCl (in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA), diluted with 1 volume of buffer I (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and the inhibitor mixture) and then loaded onto a 1-ml phenyl-Superose column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in buffer I. After sample loading, the column was washed with 15 ml of buffer I followed by a linear gradient of 0–100% buffer J (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and the inhibitor mixture) over 15 ml and maintained at 100% buffer J for 20 ml. Afterward, the column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–100% buffer K (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and the inhibitor mixture) over 30 ml. The flow rate was 0.25 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected into tubes containing 0.1 ml of 75% glycerol and 1 μl of leupeptin (5 mg/ml).Superose 12The phenyl-Superose fractions-containing N-SMase activity were pooled and concentrated with the Microsep concentrators (10K) to 0.2 ml and then loaded onto a Superose-12 column (HR 10/30, Pharmacia) equilibrated in buffer L (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and the inhibitor mixture). The column was eluted at 0.2 ml/min with 30 ml of buffer L. Fractions (1 ml) were collected into tubes containing 0.1 ml of 75% glycerol and 1 μl of leupeptin (5 mg/ml).Discontinuous Glycerol GradientTo prepare the gradient, stock solutions of 8–27.8% glycerol (2.2% increment) were prepared from a solution containing 30% glycerol in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A. To a 12-ml polyallomer tube (Sorvall), 1 ml each of the stock solutions was overlaid, starting with the highest concentration from the bottom of the tube. Multiple tubes of the gradients were used for each round of purification and 150 μl of concentrated sample from Superose 12 column was loaded onto each tube. After centrifuging at 200,000 ×g for 40 h at 4 °C, fractions of 250 μl each were removed and assayed for SMase activity.Isoelectric Focusing (IEF) of N-SMasePreparative IEF was performed on a 100-ml Raisin RF-3 apparatus. The electrolytes were 0.1m NaOH and 0.1 m phosphoric acid. The ampholyte solution (105 ml), containing 1.3 ml each of Ampholine 3.5–5 (Pharmacia) and Ampholine 5–7 (1% total solids), 2 mmDTT, 10% glycerol (w/v), and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, was prefocused at 1500 volts prior to injection of the N-SMase sample near the center of pH gradient. The sample was focused at 1000 volts until 30 min after the current stabilized, after which the voltage was set at 500 for another 30 min. After reading the pH of every third fraction, 0.5–1 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was mixed with each fraction. Fractions were stored at −80 °C until analysis for N-SMase activity.SMase Activity AssayThe activities of both N-SMase and A-SMase were determined using radiolabeled substrate in a mixed micelle assay system as described (19Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Domae N. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4070-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Liu B. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16281-16287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). For N-SMase, the reaction mixture contained enzyme preparation in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 nmol of [14C]sphingomyelin (100,000 dpm), 5 nmol of PS, 5 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100 (1.54 mm), and 5 mm magnesium chloride in a final volume of 100 μl. A-SMase activity was measured in a 100-μl reaction mixture consisting of enzyme preparation in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 5 nmol of [14C]sphingomyelin (100,000 dpm), and 0.1% Triton X-100. Typically, [14C]sphingomyelin and bovine brain sphingomyelin were placed in a 13 × 100-mm borosilicate glass tube and dried under nitrogen. To the dried substrate was added the N-SMase assay buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 10 mm magnesium chloride) or the A-SMase assay buffer (200 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and 0.2% Triton X-100). Mixed micelle solution was prepared by sonicating the tube for 1 min in a bath sonicator followed by incubation for 1 min at 37 °C. The substrate solution was always prepared within 10 min before use. Enzyme preparation was loaded into 12 × 75-mm borosilicate glass tubes kept in an ice-water bath and diluted to 50 μl with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (for N-SMase), or 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0 (for A-SMase). Blank tubes contained no enzyme preparation. The enzyme reaction was initiated by addition of 50 μl of substrate solution and the tubes were placed in a 37 °C water bath. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1.5 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) and 0.2 ml of water. After vortexing and phase separation by centrifugation, 0.2 ml of the upper aqueous phase was removed and mixed with 5 ml of scintillation solution for radioactivity counting. All reactions were carried out with quantities of enzyme preparations and for the length of incubation time that gave less than 10% hydrolysis of substrate. The reaction was linear with incubation time up to 120 min. In instances where enzyme preparations carried over various amounts of Triton X-100, the amount of the detergent added to the substrate preparation was adjusted so that the final concentration of Triton X-100 in reaction mixture was maintained at 0.1%. To examine the effects of other lipids, substrate was mixed with these lipids before drying down with nitrogen. One unit of activity is defined as micromoles of SM hydrolyzed per hour.SDS-PAGEProteins in fractions were precipitated with deoxycholate:trichloroacetic acid (22Peterson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 95-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). The protein pellet was dissolved in 15 μl of 2 × SDS sample buffer, titrated to neutral pH with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and boiled for 5 min. The proteins were separated on a 4–15% SDS-PAGE gels (Norvex) The gels were stained with Pro-Blue reagents (Integrated Separation Systems, Natick, MA), silver stained using a kit from Daichi, and dried with the Gel-Dry solutions from Novex following the manufacturer's instructions.Protein AssayProtein concentration was determined with the BCA protein assay reagents from Pierce (Rockford, IL) following deoxycholate:trichloroacetic acid precipitation as described above.All chromatography steps were performed at least 10 times. Other results are representative of at least three independent experiments.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we significantly purified the membrane-associated neutral magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinase from rat brain. The purified enzyme has an optimal pH of 7.4 and a pI of 5.2. The rat brain N-SMase does not hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine. Its activity is totally dependent upon either magnesium or manganese, but the magnesium stimulated activity is potently inhibited by copper or nickel. The enzyme displays highly hydrophobic properties, and its activity is significantly stimulated by anionic lipids, especially phosphatidylserine. On a sizing column, the enzyme migrates as a complex with detergent micelles with a size of approximately 150 kDa. Given the size of a Triton X-100 micelle at around 90 kDa, the actual molecular size of the rat brain membrane N-SMase is estimated at around 60 kDa, presuming that the enzyme associates with the Triton X-100 micelles as a monomer. The highly purified enzyme is significantly stimulated by dithiothreitol and potently inhibited by glutathione with a Hill number of approximately 8.The properties of N-SMase have not been well determined at a biochemical level because the enzyme has not been purified to homogeneity from any source. Over the last three decades, many attempts have been made to purify this enzyme from rat brain (25Maruyama E.N. Arima M. J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 12554-12561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purification efforts so far have not been very successful, probably due to multiple factors. This study defines several of these factors including the nature of the enzyme as a highly hydrophobic integral membrane protein, its dependence on detergent during most if not all of the purification steps, its existence, at least in crude preparations, as a heavily lipidated enzyme, its extreme dependence on PS for activity, and its requirement for reducing agent such as DTT for stability.Very recently, a group reported the cloning of a cDNA for a candidate neutral SMase for human and mouse based on distal sequence homology with bacterial SMases (31Tomiuk S. Hofmann K. Nix M. Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3638-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Biochemical characterization of homogenate from cells overexpressing the candidate murine neutral SMase revealed differences with the enzyme purified from rat brain N-SMase. The candidate murine neutral SMase did not respond to DTT stimulation and was not examined for stimulation by PS. More importantly, the candidate murine neutral SMase had a significant activity toward phosphatidylcholine, in stark contrast to the enzyme described here which has a strict substrate specificity toward SM. In preliminary studies, we have expressed the putative cloned sphingomyelinase in HEK 293 cells. These studies show a number of differences between this protein and the enzyme purified in this study, including response to GSH and effects on sphingomyelin synthesis. Further studies are required to establish the relationship between these two enzymes.N-SMase has been implicated in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions for a wide range of cell types. These include: cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis in response to TNFα (6Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M.

Finally, N-SMase has recently been proposed to act in hepatic regeneration (49Albi E. Magni M.P. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), lung development (50Longo C.A. Tyler D. Mallampalli R.K. Am. J. Resp. Cell Mol.

Blood. 1997; 89: 2139-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). How these diverse signals, stimuli, stresses converge on N-SMase has become somewhat of a puzzle. Indeed, enormous efforts have been devoted to attempt to delineate the signaling pathways leading to activation of N-SMase. For example, it has been proposed that a putative protein (FAN) is linked to N-SMase in TNFα signaling (52Adam-Klages S. Adam D. Wiegmann K. Struve S. Kolanus W. Schneider-Mergener J. Krönke M. Cell. 1996; 86: 937-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The finding that the cellular reducing agent GSH may act to inhibit N-SMase in cells sheds light on one regulatory mechanism for this enzyme. According to this hypothesis, oxidative stress and/or agents that induce a depletion of cellular GSH (such as TNFα and Fas) cause activation of N-SMase by relieving inhibition of the enzyme by GSH. The high cooperativity of inhibition of N-"

Since lactosylceramide (LacCer) accumulates in large quantities in human atherosclerotic plaque, we have explored its role in TNF-α-induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and their consequent adhesion to polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). We found that TNF-α increased LacCer synthesis by way of stimulating the activity of UDP-galactose:glucosylceramide β(1→4)-galactosyltransferase in a time-dependent fashion. The TNF-α-induced expression of ICAM-1 was abrogated byd-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (d-PDMP), an inhibitor of UDP-galactose:glucosylceramide β(1→4)-galactosyltransferase. However, the addition of LacCer reversed the d-PDMP effect on TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Northern hybridization analysis of mRNA levels and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays revealed that LacCer (5 μm) specifically stimulated ICAM-1 at both the transcriptional and translational levels. This was accompanied by the adhesion of PMNs, which was visualized by confocal microscopy. Further studies revealed that LacCer stimulated the endogenous generation of superoxide radicals (O⨪2) about 5-fold compared with the control by specifically activating plasma membrane-associated NADPH-dependent oxidase. This phenomenon was blocked by the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor, diphenylene iodonium. Overexpression of endogeneous CuZn-superoxide dismutase via an adenoviral vector carrying cDNA for CuZn-superoxide dismutase, also inhibited LacCer-induced ICAM-1 expression in endothelial cells. In sum, our findings suggest that LacCer may play the role of a lipid second messenger in TNF-α-induced pathogenesis by activating an oxidant-sensitive transcriptional pathway that leads to the adhesion of PMNs to endothelial cells.

One of the critical events in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic lesion formation is the focal accumulation of lipid-laden foam cells beneath an intact arterial endothelial lining (1Ross R. N. Engl.

Localized attachment of circulating monocytes and lymphocytes to the arterial endothelium appears to precede the formation of early foam cell lesions (1Ross R. N. Engl. J.

Various studies have demonstrated that the intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1),1 E-selectin (endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule; ELAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1) are all inducible on the endothelial surface following stimulation with TNF-α (3Diamond M.S.

Nature. 1990; 346: 425-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (5860) Google Scholar). In vivo studies have suggested that both ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, which are inducible by TNF-α, are expressed in human atherosclerotic lesions (13Cybulsky M. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Science. 1991; 251: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). It is well documented that TNF-α induces the expression of cell adhesion molecules by activating an oxidant-sensitive signal transduction pathway (14Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev.

However, to the best of our knowledge, the role of glycosphingolipids (GSLs), particularly lactosylceramide (LacCer), in this phenomenon has not been explored. LacCer, a ubiquitous GSL, plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of complex glycosphingolipids (16Hakomori S.I. Kanfer J.N. Hakomori S.I. Spingolipid Chemistry.

Plenum Press, New York1983: 52-53Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate that TNF-α stimulates the synthesis of LacCer by stimulating the activity of a UDP-galactose:glucosylceramide β(1→4)-galactosyltransferase (GalT-2). In turn, LacCer, via the generation of superoxide, up-regulates the expression of ICAM-1 on the surface of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) that facilitate the adhesion of neutrophils.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15642-15649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and added to culture medium to achieve the desired concentrations of LacCer. The final Me2SO concentration exposed to cells was 0.01%. DPI stock solutions were also prepared in Me2SO and stored at −20 °C until use. Cells incubated with 0.01% Me2SO served as a control. An aqueous solution of NAC was prepared in the culture medium. The quantitative expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin on the surface of the endothelial cell monolayers was determined by a modified ELISA in 96-well plates (28Wertheimer S.J. Myers C.L. Wallace R.W. Parks T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12030-12035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following incubation with antagonists and agonists, endothelial cell monolayers were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (pH 7.4) containing 0.1ml-lysine monohydrochloride and 0.01m sodium m-periodate for 20 min at 4 °C and then blocked with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1m glycine overnight at 4 °C. The fixed monolayer was then incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-human ICAM-1 or anti-human VCAM-1 or anti-human E-selectin for 1 h at 37 °C. Next it was incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, a developing substrate (0.2% H2O2, 0.4 mg/ml O-phenylenediamine) was added for 5 min, and the reaction was stopped with 2 nH2 SO4. The plates were read on a spectrophotometric plate reader at 520 nm (28Wertheimer S.J. Myers C.L. Wallace R.W. Parks T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12030-12035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ICAM-1 expression was assessed qualitatively in Eahy 926 cells by immunofluorescence staining using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated IgG following fixing of cells incubated with or without LacCer with 3.7% formaldehyde as described above. The activity of GalT-2 in cells incubated with TNF-α was measured employing UDP-[14C]galactose as a nucleotide sugar donor and glucosylceramide as an acceptor as described previously (29Chatterjee S. Castiglione E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 923: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, the GalT-2 assay mixture contained 100 μg of enzyme preparation, 20 μ m of cacodylate buffer (pH 6.8), 1.0 mmMn2+/Mg2+, 0.2 mg/ml Triton X-100-cutscum (1:2, v/v), 30 nmol of GlcCer, and 0.1 mmol of UDP-galactose. Assays without exogenous GlcCer served as blanks and were subtracted from all corresponding data points. The assay was terminated by the addition of 25 μmol of EDTA plus 2.5 μmol of KCl. Chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and 5 μg of human kidney GSL were added, and the products were isolated and separated by Whatman SG-81 paper chromatography by developing in chloroform/methanol/water (60:17:2, v/v/v). Chromatogram areas corresponding in migration with standard LacCer were cut, and radioactivity was measured in a Beckman LS-3800 scintillation spectrometer using the background subtract setting and automatic quench setting. Cultures of HUVECs were incubated in growth medium containing [3H]galactose (5 μCi/ml) for 24 h. Next, the medium was removed, and the monolayer was washed with sterile PBS to remove nonspecifically bound radioactivity. Fresh serum-free medium (5 ml/plate) was added. One set of dishes was incubated with d-PDMP (20 μm) in PBS for 2 h. Next, TNF-α (300 units/ml) was added to cells incubated with or without d-PDMP. At various time points, cells were harvested and washed with PBS and centrifuged. The cell pellet was subjected to extraction of lipids with organic solvents as described (20Chatterjee S. Dey S. Shi W.Y. Thomas K. Hutchins G.M. Glycobiol. 1997; 7: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The total lipid extract was then subjected to silicic acid column chromatography. The mixture of glycosphingolipids was eluted with acetone-methanol (9:1, v/v), and carrier LacCer (10 μg) was added and dried under N2 atmosphere. Glycosphingolipids were separated onto high performance thin layer chromatography plates using chloroform/methanol/water (100:42:6, v/v/v) as the developing solvent. The chromatographic plate was dried in air and stained with iodine vapor. The gel area corresponding to LacCer was scraped, and radioactivity was measured employing “liquiscint” (NEN Life Science Products) as a scintillating fluid. Total cellular RNA was isolated (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) from HUVECs that were preincubated with 15 mm NAC for 30 min, 5 μmdiphenylene iodonium for 30 min, followed by stimulation with the indicated concentrations of LacCer/TNF-α for 2 h. Twenty micrograms of total RNA were separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) formaldehyde), transferred to a ζ-probe blotting membrane (Bio-Rad) and hybridized with a 32P-labeled ICAM-1 cDNA probe as described. The transfer of RNA to membrane and equal amount RNA loading was confirmed by ethidium bromide staining. Lucigenin, an acridylium compound that emits light upon interaction with O⨪2, was used to measure O⨪2production by chemiluminescence (23Bhunia A.K. Han H. Snowden A. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15642-15649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Confluently grown endothelial cells were harvested, and O⨪2 generation from the intact endothelial cell suspension was measured using a 96-well plate containing dark-adapted lucigenin (250 μm) in balanced salt solution, as described by Bhunia et al. (23Bhunia A.K. Han H. Snowden A. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15642-15649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The viability of the suspended cells was >90% as determined by trypan blue exclusion. LacCer or other GSL solutions were added as putative agonists, and the resulting increases in photon emission were measured every 20 s thereafter for 10 min in a scintillation counter (Packard TOP counter). The net increase in O⨪2 generation at each time point was calculated by comparison with a standard curve generated using xanthine/xanthine oxidase. Confluently grown HUVECs were incubated with or without 5 μm LacCer. After various time intervals, the cells were harvested and homogenized, and the membrane and cytosolic fractions were separated by differential centrifugation, as described previously (23Bhunia A.K. Han H. Snowden A. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15642-15649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). NADH and NADPH oxidase activities were measured in both the cytosolic and the membrane fractions by lucigenin chemiluminescence as described above. In some experiments, NADPH oxidase activity was measured in the membrane fraction in the presence of 1 mm rotenone (a mitochondrial poison) (31Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearson E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). Protein content was measured by the method of Lowryet al. (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin serving as a standard. A replication-incompetent adenovirus (Ad-SOD) carrying the cDNA for human CuZn-SOD (33Crawford L.E. Milliken E.E. Irani K. Zweier J.L. Becker L.C. Johnson T.M. Eissa N.T. Crystal R.G. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26863-26867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and a control virus (Ad-β-galactosidase) without the SOD gene but encoding only theEscherichia coli lacZ gene (34Guzman R.J. Hirschowitz E.A. Brody S.L. Crystal R.G. Epstein S.E. Finkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10732-10736Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) were amplified in 293 cells and purified as described by Crawford et al. (33Crawford L.E. Milliken E.E. Irani K. Zweier J.L. Becker L.C. Johnson T.M. Eissa N.T. Crystal R.G. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26863-26867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Confluently grown HUVECs in 96-well plates (1.3 × 104cells/well) were infected with virus containing CuZn-SOD gene in multiplicities of infection (MOI) ranging from 0 to 75. Other plates of endothelial cells were infected with the control virus (Ad-β-galactosidase) at corresponding dilutions. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were washed with PBS to remove uninfecting virus particles. The endothelial cells were then incubated for an additional 48 h in fresh medium. The cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS, and the expression of intracellular SOD was measured by ELISA after permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min. The permeabilized endothelial cells were probed with monoclonal anti-human SOD and then with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. FITC fluorescence was measured on a fluorescence plate reader (CytoFluor 2300) at 480 nm (excitation) and 530 nm (emission). The SOD activities in the cell extracts were measured by the method of McCord and Fridovich (35McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the isolation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), human blood was collected in 10 units/ml heparin from laboratory volunteers by a protocol approved by the Johns Hopkins Joint Committee for Clinical Investigations and centrifuged at 1300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The white blood cell layer was removed and layered over cold Accu-prep gradient and centrifuged at 600 × g for 30 min for the separation of leukocytes. The red blood cell/PMN layer was then resuspended in red blood cell lysing buffer. After incubation at room temperature, the preparation was centrifuged at 1300 × g for 2 min, and this step was repeated until the PMN pellet was free of red blood cells. The PMN pellet was then washed and was found to contain >96% PMNs following modified Wright-Giemsa staining. The PMNs were labeled by incubation with 5 μm fluorescent Cell Tracker dye (green) for 30 min at 37 °C. At the same time, LacCer-stimulated (5 μm, 4 h, 37 °C)/control (0.01% Me2SO) endothelial cell monolayers grown in glass chamber slides were also labeled with 10 μm Cell Tracker dye (orange). The labeled PMNs were incubated with confluently grown fluorescence-labeled endothelial cell monolayers in the glass chamber slides for 30 min at 37 °C. The nonadherent PMNs were then removed by gentle washing with PBS. A drop of 4% glycerol in PBS was added, and a glass coverslip was mounted on the slide and visualized and photographed using confocal microscopy. Endothelial cells, grown in 24-well plates were incubated with various concentrations (0–10 μm) of LacCer for 4 h at 37 °C and washed with PBS. Next, human PMNs labeled with Cell Tracker dye (green) as described above were incubated with the LacCer-stimulated endothelial cells for 30 min. Nonadherent PMNs were removed by gentle washing (three times) with PBS. The residual adherent PMNs were quantified on a fluorescence plate reader (Millipore Corp.) at 480 nm (excitation)/530 nm (emission) as described by Arai et al. (36Arai T. Bhunia A.K. Chatterjee S. Bulkley G.B. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In a parallel experiment, following stimulation with LacCer, endothelial cells were preincubated with ICAM-1 antibody (1:2000 dilution) for 30 min before incubation with labeled PMNs as described above. The number of adherent PMNs was expressed as the number of PMNs/mm2 of endothelial cell monolayer, based on the mean fluorescent intensity of each PMN, determined from a standard curve. To rule out the possibility of nonspecific adhesion stimulated by HUVEC reactivity in some PMN adhesion assays, endothelial monolayers in one half of each 24-well plate were fixed first with 2% buffered formalin for 5 min and then washed three times with PBS. The endothelial cells on the other half of the plate were left unfixed but were similarly washed before use in adhesion assay. We found that TNF-α (both 100 and 300 units/ml) stimulated GalT-2 activity in a time-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). Within 5 min, about 1.5-fold stimulation of GalT-2 activity was observed compared with the control. Thereafter, the activity of GalT-2 continued to rise in cells stimulated with TNF-α. This phenomenon was accompanied by a time-dependent increase in the synthesis of LacCer as evidenced by an increase in the incorporation of [3H]galactose into LacCer in cells stimulated with TNF-α (Fig. 1 B). For example, 5 min after the stimulation with TNF-α, a 1.5-fold increase in LacCer synthesis was observed and continued to increase 60 min after stimulation. Preincubation of cells with d-PDMP decreased the synthesis of LacCer ∼0.4-fold compared with the control. d-PDMP effect was not altered significantly after stimulation of cells with TNF-α. Preincubation of HUVECs withd-PDMP inhibited TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 expression in a concentrationdependent manner (Fig.2 A). Moreover, this inhibition by d-PDMP was reversed upon incubation with exogeneous LacCer but not by exogeneous ceramide or glucosylceramide (Fig.2 B), suggesting the involvement of LacCer in TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 expression. HUVECs were incubated with various GSLs (5 μm) and their constituents. Only LacCer stimulated the expression of ICAM-1. Other GSLs and their constituents or gangliosides did not stimulate ICAM-1 expression (Fig.3 A). LacCer stimulated ICAM-1 expression in a time-dependent (Fig. 3 B) and concentration-dependent (Fig. 3 C) manner. Maximal expression of ICAM-1 (9-fold compared with control) was observed with 5 μm LacCer at 8 h (Fig. 3, B andC). LacCer (5 μm) and TNF-α (100 units/ml) both exerted a time-dependent stimulation of ICAM-1 (Fig.3 B). However, unlike LacCer, TNF-α also stimulated the expression of VCAM-1 and E-selectin in addition to ICAM-1 (Fig. 3,D and E). Moreover, maximum stimulation of ICAM-1 (10-fold), VCAM-1 (9-fold), and E-selectin (10-fold) was observed after 12 h of incubation with TNF-α. Immunofluorescence visualization, using ICAM-1 antibody followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, further confirmed that LacCer induced the stimulation of cell surface ICAM-1 expression in intact Eahy 926 endothelial cells as compared with control (Fig. 3 F). As shown in Fig. 4, LacCer exerted a concentration-dependent increase in the mRNA levels of ICAM-1 in HUVECs. A maximum stimulation of ICAM-1 mRNA level occurred following incubation of cells with 5 μmLacCer for 2 h. Moreover, this phenomenon was abrogated by preincubation of cells with N-acetyl-l-cysteine, an antioxidant and a scavenger of free oxygen radicals, as well as DPI, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase. Interestingly, the magnitude of stimulation of ICAM-1 gene transcription by LacCer was comparable with TNF-α. Since TNF-α induces ICAM-1 expression via redox signaling, i.e. generation of reactive oxygen species, we examined whether LacCer also generates O⨪2 for the induction of ICAM-1 in endothelial cells. Direct measurement of O⨪2 by lucigenin chemiluminescence revealed that LacCer stimulated O⨪2production in HUVECs in a concentration-dependent (Fig.5 A) and time-dependent (Fig. 5 B) manner. Maximum stimulation in the generation of O⨪2 (5-fold), compared with the control, was observed following the incubation of cells with 5 μm LacCer for 5 min. At various time points following stimulation with or without (5 μm) LacCer, NADPH oxidase activity was measured in the membrane preparations (Fig.6). Three-fold stimulation of NADPH oxidase activity was observed at 5 μm LacCer, as compared with nonstimulated cell membrane preparations (Fig. 6 A). Preincubation of LacCer-stimulated/nonstimulated cell membrane preparations with DPI, a potent NADPH oxidase inhibitor (23Bhunia A.K. Han H. Snowden A. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15642-15649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), attenuated the LacCer induced increase in NADPH-dependent oxidase activity in the membrane preparations (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, LacCer did not alter the activity of NADH oxidase activity in stimulated/nonstimulated membrane preparations (Fig. 6 B). Neither NADPH oxidase nor NADH oxidase activity was observed in the LacCer-stimulated/unstimulated cell cytosol (data not shown). On the other hand, allopurinol, a specific inhibitor of xanthine oxidase (23Bhunia A.K. Han H. Snowden A. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15642-15649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), failed to inhibit LacCer-induced O⨪2 generation (data not shown). Since rotenone also failed to inhibit NADPH oxidase activity in the membrane fraction, it appears that plasma membrane-associated NADPH oxidase is the source of LacCer-induced O⨪2 generation in endothelial cells. Preincubation of cells with 5 μmDPI for 30 min failed to respond to the LacCer-mediated increased generation of O⨪2 (Fig.7 A) and ICAM-1 expression (Fig. 7 B). Similarly, preincubation of cells withN-"

The mammalian sperm flagellum consists mainly of cytoskeletal structures, including the axoneme, the outer dense fibers, and the fibrous sheath. The axoneme is formed of microtubles organized in a “nine plus two” arrangement, extends the full length of the flagellum, and functions as the motor of the sperm. It is surrounded by the outer dense fibers throughout most of its length. The outer dense fibers are enclosed by the mitochondrial sheath in the middle piece and by the fibrous sheath in the principal piece of the flagellum (1Eddy E.M. O'Brien D.A. Kobil E. Neill J. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, New York1994: 29-77Google Scholar). The outer dense fibers and the fibrous sheath are believed to stiffen the flagellum and to modulate its bending (2Lindermann C.B. Orlando A. Kanous K.S. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 249-260PubMed Google Scholar, 3Si Y. Okuno M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, several spermatogenic cell-specific glycolytic enzymes are associated with the fibrous sheath (4Bunch D.O. Welch J.E. Magyar P.L. Eddy E.M. O'Brien D.A. Biol.

This structure may be a scaffold for enzymes that produce energy required for hyperactivated motility of sperm at the time of fertilization. Furthermore, cAMP-stimulated protein phosphorylation is essential for initiation or maintenance of sperm motility (7Garbers D.L. Kopf G.S. Greengard P. Robison G.A.

The coordinated regulation of many cellular mechanisms is mediated through cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA).1 There has been much interest in how cAMP can act as a second messenger to regulate different mechanisms at specific sites distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus. One way this is achieved appears to be through diversity of PKA components. PKA is a tetramer of two catalytic (C) and two regulatory (R) subunits, and genes encoding three C subunits and four R subunits have been identified (10Takio K. Smith S.B. Krebs E.G. Walsh K.A.

In addition, protein kinase A anchoring proteins (AKAPs) have been identified that are present in specific subcellular sites. AKAPs have tethering domains for regulatory subunits that place PKA in close proximity to specific organelles or cytoskeletal components to localize phosphorylation events that occur in response to activation signals (14Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Glantz S.B. Amat J.A. Rubin C.S. Mol. Biol.

However, yeast two-hybrid screens recently isolated D-AKAP1 and D-AKAP2 proteins that interact with both RIα and RIIα (20Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8057-8064Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 21Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although D-AKAP1 has a 25-fold lower affinity for RIα than for RIIα, this suggests that RI subunits also may determine the subcellular localization of PKA. Deletion and point mutagenesis approaches have been used with ligand overlay assays to map RII tethering domains on AKAPs. These domains have limited consensus sequences but are predicted to form secondary structures of amphipathic helices that containing acidic amino acids in the hydrophilic region and amino acids with a long aliphatic side chain in the hydrophobic region (14Glantz S.B.

These include three enzymes, glutathione S-transferase (24Fulcher K.D. Welch J.E. Klapper D.G. O'Brien D.A. Eddy E.M. Mol. Reprod.

It is remarkable that three of these are products of genes expressed only in spermatogenic cells (Gstm5, Gapds, and Fsc1), while the other is the product of spermatogenic cell-specific transcripts (Hk1-s). Northern analysis and in situhybridization demonstrated that Fsc1 transcription first occurs in the postmeiotic phase of spermatogenesis when the fibrous sheath is assembled. Other investigators isolated a cDNA encoding a fibrous sheath protein referred to as AKAP82 that is identical to FSC1, except for lacking 9 amino acids at the N terminus (27Carrera A. Gerton G.L. Moss S.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). An important finding was that RII subunits bind to a 14-amino acid region of AKAP82 (28Visconti P.E. Johnson L.R. Oyaski M. Fornés M. Moss S.B. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This region was predicted to form an amphipathic helix, and the binding in the ligand overlay assay was inhibited by a synthetic peptide of the corresponding sequence (28Visconti P.E. Johnson L.R. Oyaski M. Fornés M. Moss S.B. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The studies reported here used the yeast two-hybrid system, deletion mutagenesis, and an in vitro binding assay to demonstrate that two RIα and one RIIα tethering domains are present on FSC1. While RIα and RIIα bound to domain A, only RIα bound to domain B. This suggests that the amphipathic helix formed by domain B has a secondary structure distinct from that required for RII binding. Taken together with the immunocytochemical evidence that RI associates with the fibrous sheath and outer dense fibers (29Moos J. Peknicová J. Geussová G. Philimonenko V. Hozák P. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 50: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), these results suggest that tethering of RIα to FSC1 may provide a mechanism for the subcellular localization of PKA to a region of the flagellum important for sperm motility. The Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrain Y190 (MATa, ura3–52,his3-Δ200, ade2–101, trp1–901,leu2–3, 112, gal4Δgal80Δ,URA::GAL-lacZ,cyh r 2,LYS2::GAL-HIS3) and yeast culture media used in these yeast two-hybrid studies were obtained fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Synthetic dropout (SD) and dropout supplements were used to prepare tryptophan and/or leucine amino acid-deficient media (SD/Trp− Leu−, SD/Trp−, or SD/Leu−). Transactivation ofHis3 was assayed using medium deficient in tryptophan, leucine, and histidine (SD/Trp− Leu−His−) and supplemented with 25 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (Sigma). PCR was used to produce the full-length Fsc1 protein coding sequence (GenBankTM accession number U10341) or various deletion mutants. Forward primers containing NdeI sites and reverse primers containing SalI sites were used to generate PCR products for ligation into the pAS2-1 (CLONTECH) yeast two-hybrid system expression plasmid (TableI). Numbering of the amino acid sequence of FSC1 was that of Fulcher et al. (26Fulcher K.D. Mori C. Welch J.E. O'Brien D.A. Klapper D.G. Eddy E.M. Biol.

Amplification was performed for 30 cycles with a temperature profile of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 4.5 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were digested with NdeI andSalI restriction enzymes, ligated into plasmid pAS2-1 digested with NdeI and SalI, and then transformed in Escherichia coli DH5α competent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). The resulting constructs allowed FSC1 to be expressed in yeast as a fusion protein with GAL4.Table IPCR primer sequences used for construction of expression plasmid for FSC1PositionDirectionPrimer sequence1Forward5′-CCGCATATGATTGCCTACTGTGGTACTACAACG-3′125Forward5′-CCGCATATGCAACATGCATTAAGCCCCTCAGCC-3′202Forward5′-CCGCATATGCAGAGGTCAGTTGCCACTCCTGAG-3′237Forward5′-CCGCATATGAAGGACAAATTGGAAGGTGGAAGC-3′311Forward5′-CCGCATATGGGCGAAAAGCAGCAGATGTGCCCA-3′326Forward5′-CCGCATATGGATTCCATCAGCAAGGGGCTTATGG-3′335Forward5′-CCGCATATGTATGCAAATCAAGTAGCATCTGAC-3′343Forward5′-CCGCATATGATGGTCTCTGTTATGAAAACTTTG-3′359Forward5′-CCGCATATGCCAATTCCGGCTTGTGTGGTCCTG-3′397Forward5′-CCGCATATGACAGACTCAGACTTCGTTTCTGC-3′218Reverse5′-CCGGTCGACGGAAAGGTCGTCCATAGAACATTC-3′247Reverse5′-CCGGTCGACATGGAGACATTTGCTTCCACCTTC-3′311Reverse5′-CCGGTCGACCGCCACACTTGTTCTTGTTACACA-3′325Reverse5′-CCGGTCGACCGCAAATTCTTTGCTGTCTTTTGG-3′334Reverse5′-CCGGTCGACAACCATAAGCCCCTTGCTGATGGA-3′344Reverse5′-CCGGTCGACCATCATGTCAGATGCTACTTGATT-3′361Reverse5′-CCGGTCGACCCGGAATTGGCTTCCCACAGCTGT-3′849Reverse5′-CCGGTCGACAGGGGAGTCAAAGGAATTCTCAGC-3′ Open table in a new tab To produce constructs that expressed FSC1 protein in E. colias a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase, PCR forward primers were used that contained the BamHI sequence to allow ligation into the corresponding site in pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Other conditions for construction of these plasmids were as described above. The coding sequence of Fsc1 was subcloned into pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene), and then used as a template to introduce the point mutation by using the QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Sequencing of the targeted site was carried out using T7 Sequenase version 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PCRs using the appropriate primer set were used to amplify DNA sequences corresponding to mutant FSC1 proteins covering residues 237–361. The products were ligated into pGEX-4T-1 to produce constructs that expressed mutant FSC1 proteins in E. coli as described above. Yeast Y190 competent cells were prepared with the Yeastmaker yeast transformation system (CLONTECH), based on the lithium acetate method described by Gietz et al. (30Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2898) Google Scholar), transformed with plasmid pAS/Fsc/1–849 containing the full-length Fsc1cDNA, and cultured on SD/Trp− agar plates for 4 days at 30 °C. Selected yeast cells containing pAS/Fsc/1–849 were cultured in SD/Trp− medium and used as the carrier of the bait vector for sequential transformation. A mouse testis cDNA library constructed in the pGAD10 vector (CLONTECH) was screened using the yeast two-hybrid procedure. The pAS/Fsc/1–849 and pGAD10 co-transformants were cultured on SD/Trp−Leu− His− agar plates for 7 days at 30 °C. Selected transformants were tested for β-galactosidase activity by the colony lift assay using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as the substrate on ProtranTM nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). To assay binding activity of candidate cDNA clones andFsc1 deletion mutants, lifts of transformants were cultured for 2 days at 30 °C on YPD or SD/Trp− Leu−agar plate, respectively, and then permeabilized and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Membranes were frozen for 10 min at −70 °C and thawed at room temperature to permeabilize yeast cells and then soaked in Z-buffer (0.3 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) for 8 h at 37 °C. Yeast cells were transformed with pAS2–1 deletion mutants of Fsc1 and cultured overnight in 1 ml of SD/Trp− Leu−selection medium at 30 °C. Nine ml of YPD medium then was added, and growth was allowed to proceed to the midlogarithmic phase. Yeast proteins were extracted by the urea/SDS method as described (31Printen J.A. Sprague Jr., G.F. Genetics. 1994; 138: 609-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 250 μl of cracking buffer. Proteins from 5 μl of extract were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10% (w/v) acrylamide gel and transferred onto ImobilonTM nylon membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were soaked in TBST (150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) solution containing 2% (w/v) gelatin for 1 h and then incubated for 1 h with monoclonal antibody (0.5 μg/ml) to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (CLONTECH) in TBST. After extensive washing with TBST, membranes were incubated for 30 min with 10% (v/v) goat serum in TBST. After washing briefly, membranes were incubated for 30 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antiserum to mouse IgG (1:30,000 dilution in TBST) (Sigma) preabsorbed for 30 min with 0.5 mg/ml yeast proteins to eliminate nonspecific antibodies against common yeast proteins. Yeast proteins were prepared from Y190 strain cells sonicated in PBS for 3 min followed by incubation for 30 min with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 to solubilize membrane proteins. After extensive washing of the membrane with TBST solution, FSC1-GAL4 fusion protein was detected using ECLTM reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to procedures recommended by the supplier. E. coli transformed with pGEX-4T-1 plasmid encoding Fsc1were grown to the midlogarithmic phase at 37 °C in LB medium. They were cultured for an additional 90 min at 30 °C in the presence of 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to induce synthesis of the fusion protein. Crude extracts were prepared by sonicating bacteria in PBS for 30 s followed by incubation for 30 min with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Crude extract (15–150 μl) was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.5 ml of PBS, followed by extensive washing with PBS to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. Extracts from testes of 3–5-month-old CD-1 mice were prepared by homogenization in extraction buffer (140 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, supernatant corresponding to 150 μg or 1.5 mg of protein was added to the tube containing GST-FSC1 fusion protein immobilized on resin. The volume was adjusted to 0.5 ml with extraction buffer, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing extensively with PBS, proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS gel-loading buffer, the eluates were divided into three parts, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10% (w/v) acrylamide gels prepared according to Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207461) Google Scholar). Each lane contained that portion of 50 or 500 μg of protein from testis extracts that bound to GST-FSC1, while the positive control lane contained 10 μg (Fig. 3, lane T) or 5 μg (Fig. 5,lane 1) of total testis extract. Regulatory subunits of PKA were detected by Western blotting using rabbit antisera against mouse RIα, RIIα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA; 1:1000 dilution each) or RIβ (1:500 dilution; a gift of Dr. Daniel W. Carr, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR). Secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antiserum to rabbit IgG (1:10,000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Western blotting was performed as described above except that second antibody was not preabsorbed. Other gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to detect proteins. Prestained standard proteins (Bio-Rad) were used to estimate protein mass.Figure 5Disruption of RIα binding activity in FSC1 domain B. Point mutations were introduced into the Fsc1cDNA to disturb the putative amphipathic helix in domain B, and then RIα binding activity was determined by in vitrobinding assays, as in Fig. 3. The proteins that bound truncated FSC1 were analyzed by Western blotting using antiserum to RIα (a). Eluted proteins were visualized by Coomassie staining (b). Lane 1 received testis extract not subjected to the binding assay. Lanes 2 and3–7 received GST fusion proteins containing truncated FSC1 proteins with the intervening region (N) or domain B (B) as in Fig. 3 a, respectively. Lane 3 received fusion protein with wild type domain B. The other lanes received fusion proteins that contained domain B with the following mutations: replacement of serine 327 with proline (S327P) (lane 4); replacement of alanine 340 with proline (A340P) (lane 5); replacement of valine 339 with serine (V339S) (lane 6); exchange of valine 339 and serine 341 (V339S/S341V) (lane 7).

The dots to the left ofa and an open triangle in bidentify the same proteins as in Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The yeast two-hybrid procedure (33Brent R. Ptashne M. Cell. 1985; 43: 729-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) was used to screen a mouse testis cDNA library to identify proteins that interact directly with FSC1. Yeast Y190 cells were transfected with a bait plasmid containing the mouse Fsc1 cDNA protein coding region followed by sequential transformation with library plasmid DNA. Secondary transformants corresponding to 5 × 106 clones were screened for interaction with FSC1 based on growth on medium lacking histidine. Positive clones were tested for transactivation ofLacZ as another marker gene. Of the eight clones positive in both assays, two (FA7 and FC9) were subjected to further analysis in this study. To confirm association with FSC1, plasmids for the FA7 and FC9 clones were rescued from yeast cells, cloned and amplified in E. coli, and then used to retransform yeast cells. Transformants were selected on medium lacking tryptophan and/or leucine, according to the type and combination of plasmid vectors used. Only transformants that received pAS/Fsc/1–849 in combination with plasmids containing pFA7 or pFC9 grew on SD/Trp− Leu− His−, while transformants that received pAS/Fsc/1–849, pFA7, or pFC9 alone did not grow (data not shown). Transformants that received plasmid vector(s) were also cultured on YPD medium and used for colony lift assays to detect β-galactosidase expression (data not shown). This assay gave the same results as the growth selection assay, confirming that transactivation was due to association between FSC1 and proteins encoded by pFA7 and pFC9. These results also suggested that the interaction is direct and that no additional factors are required for association. Sequence analysis demonstrated that both the pFA7 and pFC9 cDNAs encode PKA RIα. The pFC9 cDNA encoded the full-length protein of 381 amino acids, while the pFA7 cDNA encoded 190 residues in the N-terminal half (data not shown). Differences from the previously reported nucleotide sequence (13Clegg C.H. Cadd G.G. McKnight G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3703-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) were found at the third position in five codons, but this did not alter the deduced amino acid sequence (data not shown). Only the pFC9 RIα cDNA was used for further experiments. The region of the FSC1 protein responsible for RIα binding was identified by deletional mutagenesis in the yeast two-hybrid system. The amino acid numbering was based on the FSC1 sequence (26Fulcher K.D. Mori C. Welch J.E. O'Brien D.A. Klapper D.G. Eddy E.M. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A series of deletion mutants were constructed in the pAS2-1 plasmid to allow expression of truncated FSC1 polypeptides in yeast cells. These plasmids were used to retransform primary transformants expressing the full-length RIα protein. Transformants containing plasmids both for deletion mutants ofFsc1 and full-length RIα were selected on SD/Trp− Leu− and examined for β-galactosidase activity by the colony lift assay. The first series examined were sequential deletions from the N terminus of FSC1. The β-galactosidase activity was lost after the deletions reached residue 343 (343–849), while a longer construct (335–849) gave β-galactosidase activity (Fig.1 b). This strongly suggests that the peptide sequence within the 335–342 residue region is required for RIα binding. We next examined another series of deletion mutations that lacked domain A (see below) in the N-terminal region of FSC1. The polypeptide that included residues 237–334 did not result in β-galactosidase activity, while activity was seen with the polypeptide that included residues 237–344 (Fig. 1 b). These results confirm that RIα binding is associated with residues 335–344. We term this region domain B (Fig. 1 c). The second series of mutants involved plasmids with deletions producing truncations from the C terminus of FSC1. It was found that β-galactosidase activity occurred until the deletion reached residue 218 (125–218) (Fig. 1 b). Taken together with other results showing that β-galactosidase activity was present with polypeptide 125–247 and absent with polypeptide 237–334, this indicated that an RIα binding domain lies between residue 219 and 236 in the FSC1 polypeptide (Fig. 1 b). Visconti et al. (28Visconti P.E. Johnson L.R. Oyaski M. Fornés M. Moss S.B. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) recently mapped an RII tethering domain of AKAP82 to a 57-amino acid region that includes a 14-amino acid sequence similar to an RII tethering domain in other AKAPs. This region of AKAP82 corresponds to residues 219–232 of FSC1, and our results strongly suggest that this region is also capable of binding RIα. We term this region domain A (Fig. 1 c). Transactivation of the His3 gene was also examined for all of the deletion mutants (Fig. 1, a and c). Transformants with plasmids encoding deletion mutants of FSC1 and full-length RIα were selected on SD/Trp−Leu− medium and then transferred onto SD/Trp−Leu− His− medium to test for growth. Representative results (Fig. 1 a) show that mutants with deletions up to domain A or B grew on medium lacking histidine (335–849, 237–344, and 125–247), while further deletions resulted in the loss of growth activity (343–849, 237–334, and 125–218). These results were consistent with the β-galactosidase activity assays (Fig. 1, b and c). Yeast homogenates were examined for the presence of fusion proteins to determine if failure to transactivate LacZ andHis3 was due to failure of the vectors to express. However, Western blotting with an antibody to the GAL4 DNA binding domain demonstrated that the truncated FSC1 proteins were expressed in yeast in which transactivation did not occur (Fig.2). Fusion protein was detected in homogenates of transformants in which neither LacZ norHis3 genes were expressed"

Most biological membranes appear to possess a nonrandom distribution of phospholipids between the two leaflets of the bilayer (1Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1163-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). An asymmetric organization of phospholipids, in which phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)1 and phosphatidylserine (PS) are enriched in the inner leaflet facing the cytoplasm, and phosphatidylcholine (PC), sphingomyelin, and glycolipids are predominantly located on the outer leaflet, has been well documented for the plasma membranes of numerous cell types (2Diaz C.

However, the establishment and regulation of this asymmetric distribution as well as its physiological function in single cells are poorly understood.

Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The Na+/K+ATPases, various Ca2+ ATPases of animal cells as well as the H+-ATPases of fungi and plants belong to this family of ion transporters, which share a characteristic set of conserved regions and a similar transmembrane topology (14Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The members of the new subgroup differ from the ion-transporting ATPases in several amino acids within transmembrane segments critically involved in ion translocation. Apart from the bovine cDNA, the yeastDRS2 gene and four related yeast genes (13Catty P. de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. Goffeau A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) as well as sequences from Plasmodium falciparum andCaenorhabditis elegans appear to carry these changes (12Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Science. 1996; 272: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) whereby negatively charged residues have been replaced by bulky, hydrophobic groups. The observation of a defect in fluorescent-labeled PS (P-C6-NBD-PS) internalization in a drs2mutant at low temperature has been interpreted as evidence for the biochemical function of this group of enzymes as aminophospholipid translocases (12Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Science. 1996; 272: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In this report, we examined the potential role of Drs2p in phospholipid transport using fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and TNBS labeling. The deletion of DRS2 had no effect on the uptake or distribution of fluorescent-labeled PS (P-C6-NBD-PS) or PE (M-C6-NBD-PE) detected by fluorescence microscopy. Quantification of the amount of cell-associated NBD fluorescence indicated a significant decrease in the absence of Drs2p, but this decrease was not exclusive to the aminophospholipids (PE and PS) and was dependent on culture conditions. The absence of Drs2p had no effect on the amount of endogenous PE exposed to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane as detected by labeling with TNBS. The steady state pool of Drs2p, which was shown to reside predominantly in the plasma membrane, increased upon shift to low temperature or exposure to various heavy metal cations, conditions that inhibited the growth of a drs2 null mutant. The data presented here call into question the identification of Drs2p as the exclusive or major aminophospholipid translocase in yeast plasma membranes (12Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Science. 1996; 272: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). All yeast strains used in this study were derived from the S288C-related wild-type strain YR98 (MATα ade2 his3-Δ200 leu2–3, 112 lys2-Δ201 ura3–52) isogenic with strain AA255 (15Rudolph H.K. Antebi A.

The drs2–1::URA3strain YR884 was obtained by transformation of YR98 withdrs2–1::URA3 DNA as described below. TheHA::DRS2 strain YR886 carrying an in-frame insertion of 27 base pairs encoding the HA epitope (16Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Conolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) was constructed by transforming YR884 with HA::DRS2 DNA as described below. All media were prepared according to standard protocols (17Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). To construct drs2–1::URA3, the 5.9-kb EcoRI fragment carrying the entire DRS2gene was isolated from a DRS2-containing plasmid (a gift from J. Woolford) and subcloned into pUC19 (18Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene. 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11458) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the 3.5-kb BstEII-HpaI fragment within theDRS2 ORF was replaced with URA3 sequences by inserting the 1.1-kb HindIII fragment of URA3 via blunt-end ligation. DNA from the resulting plasmid was digested withEcoRI and used to transform YR98. The replacement of theDRS2 gene by drs2–1::URA3 DNA was verified in one of the Ura+ transformants (YR884) by Southern blot analysis. To obtain the HA::DRS2 allele, a 27-base pair insertion of HA-encoding DNA (19Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) was introduced into the 1.1-kbEcoRI-XhoI fragment of DRS2 by joining the polymerase chain reaction products of two independent polymerase chain reaction reactions on a DRS2 template via recombinant polymerase chain reaction (20Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). One reaction utilized primers A (5′-ggcggccgGAATTCAGCCAAGAGACGTAAG, capital letters indicate bases pairing with the DRS2 template; the EcoRI site is in italics) and B (5′-AGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTAATTCATGGTAAAATCAGGGAATGAAAGAAC, underlined letters correspond to bases encoding the 9-amino acid HA epitope); the other reaction used primers C (5′-TACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTGACGACAGAGAAACCCCCCCAAAGAGG) and D (5′-CTTATTCCTCGAGTCTAGATA, XhoI site). A mixture of the two reaction products together with primers A and D was used to amplify a recombinantEcoRI-XhoI DRS2 fragment, which carried the HA DNA inserted between the second and third codon of the DRS2 open reading frame. To obtain a full-length HA::DRS2 allele, the recombinant fragment was digested with CelII and XhoI and subcloned to replace the CelI-XhoI fragment within the 5.9 kb of wild-type DRS2 DNA (EcoRI-EcoRI) present in pUC19. For chromosomal integration of HA::DRS2, DNA from the resulting plasmid was cut with EcoRI and transformed intodrs2–1::URA3 cells together with pRS425, aLEU2-containing plasmid. In one of the Leu+transformants (YR886) able to grow at 23 °C like wild type, expression of HA-Drs2p was verified by Western blot analysis. P-C6-NBD-PS, M-C6-NBD-PE, M-C6-NBD-PC, DOPC andN-Rh-DOPE were from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Phospholipids were stored at −20 °C, periodically monitored for purity by thin-layer chromatography, and repurified when necessary. Phospholipid concentrations were determined by a lipid phosphorus assay (21Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare vesicles, lipids were first mixed in desired proportions, and the chloroform solvent was removed by evaporation under nitrogen followed by overnight vacuum desiccation. Desiccated lipids were solubilized in SDC medium, and the mixture was passed eight times through a Lipex Extruder (Lipex Biomembranes Inc, Vancouver, BC, Canada) equipped with 0.1-mm filters to produce vesicles. Total lipid concentration in the stock vesicle preparation was 1 mm. Proportions were 40 mol % NBD-phospholipid, 2 mol %N-Rh-DOPE, 58 mol % DOPC. Cells were grown overnight in SDC at 30 °C, diluted, and allowed to grow to an A 600 of 0.2. Donor vesicles containing 40% P-C6-NBD-PS, M-C6-NBD-PE, or M-C6-NBD-PC, 58% DOPC, and 2% N-Rh-DOPE (50 μm total final lipid concentration) were added to the cells and incubated for 30 min. Cells were washed 3 times with ice-cold SDC/NaN3 before analysis by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope equipped with barrier filters that allowed no detectable crossover of NBD and rhodamine fluorescence. The fluorescence image was enhanced with a VE1000-SIT image-intensifying camera (DAGE-MTI Inc., Michigan City, IN), digitized, and stored. Image manipulation and editing were performed with Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). Flow cytometric analysis of the NBD-phospholipid-labeled cells was performed with a FACScan cytometer (Becton-Dickinson Immunocytochemistry, San Jose, CA) equipped with an argon laser operating at 488 nm. Ten μl of a 50 mg/ml stock solution of propidium iodide was added to approximately 4 × 105 cells in 200 μl of SDC/NaN3 immediately before dilution (∼3×) and flow cytometric analysis. Ten thousand cells were analyzed without gating during acquisition. Analysis was performed with Lysis II (Becton-Dickinson Immunocytochemistry Systems) software. A dot plot of forward scatter versus the red fluorescence channel (propidium iodide) was used to set a gate that excluded dead cells from the analysis. The remaining live cells were plotted on a histogram of green fluorescence (NBD-phospholipid) and analyzed to obtain the average and standard deviation of the distribution of NBD fluorescence per cell. Cells were grown for 18 h at 30 °C to mid-logarithmic phase (A 600 = 0.4–0.7) in SDC containing 500 μCi of [32P]KH2PO4 (specific activity 1 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products). Plasma membrane, outer leaflet PE was labeled with TNBS as described previously (22Marinetti G.V. Love R. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1976; 16: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice in ice-cold 40 mmNaCl, 120 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.4, resuspended in the same buffer containing 5 mm TNBS (Sigma), and immediately placed on ice for 1 h with periodic vortex mixing. After TNBS labeling, cells were washed by centrifugation three times in fresh buffer, pelleted, and disrupted by vortexing with glass beads. Cellular lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1) and separated by two-dimensional TLC (1st solvent: chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide (65:35:5); 2ndsolvent: chloroform/methanol/acetone/acetic acid/water (50:10:20:10:5)). Spots were identified by comparison with known standards. The percentages of PE, PS, trinitrophenylnucleotide-PE and trinitrophenylnucleotide-PS were quantified by phosphorimaging with a PhosphorImager SI scanning instrument (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The percent viability was determined by counting the number of cells labeled after dilution into 0.02% methylene blue with a hemocytometer and did not differ significantly between the two strains. The data are presented in the text as the average percentage of trinitrophenylnucleotide-PE or -PS relative to total cellular PE or PS ±S.D. for four trials. Using a drs2::TRP1 mutant allele, wherein the 1.4-kbBglII-NcoI fragment corresponding to the segment from positions 529 to 1201 within the DRS2 open reading frame (1355 amino acids) was replaced by the yeast TRP1 gene (see Fig. 1), Ripmaster et al.(23Ripmaster T.L. Vaughn G.P. Woolford J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7901-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) show that DRS2 is required for mitotic growth at 23 °C or below. Because these authors also reported that a 2.2-kbEcoRI-BglII fragment encoding the first 528 amino acids at the N terminus of Drs2p was still able to complement a cold-sensitive drs2 mutant, we constructed a newdrs2 mutant allele essentially lacking the entireDRS2 coding sequence. In thisdrs2–1::URA3 null allele, the 3.5-kbBstEII-HpaI fragment encoding amino acids 33 to 1206 of the DRS2 open reading frame was substituted by the yeast URA3 gene. Transformation of a haploid wild-type strain (YR98) with drs2–1::URA3 DNA produced the congenic drs2–1::URA3 strain YR884 used in all subsequent studies. Growth of YR884 was examined on different solid media (yeast extract/peptone/glucose (YPD)), synthetic complete and minimal medium) at 23, 30, and 37 °C. On all media tested, thisdrs2–1::URA3 strain grew well at 37 and 30 °C but was unable to grow at 23 °C (data not shown), as reported for the drs2::TRP1 mutant (23Ripmaster T.L. Vaughn G.P. Woolford J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7901-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The internalization and distribution of the NBD-labeled aminophospholipids, P-C6-NBD-PS and M-C6-NBD-PE, were observed by fluorescence microscopy in the drs2–1::URA3 strain and its isogenicDRS2 parent (Fig. 2). No significant differences were detected between the two strains at 30 °C (permissive for growth) or at 23 °C (nonpermissive for growth). In previous experiments, it was concluded that M-C6-NBD-PE was internalized exclusively by inward-directed transport across the plasma membrane (flip), resulting in its distribution to the nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria (24Kean L.S. Grant A.M. Angeletti C. Mahe Y. Kuchler K. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Internalized M-C6-NBD-PE was not degraded intracellularly, but was readily transported outward across the plasma membrane (flop), where it was degraded by periplasmic phospholipases (24Kean L.S. Grant A.M. Angeletti C. Mahe Y. Kuchler K. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The similar pattern of fluorescence distribution observed for P-C6-NBD-PS and M-C6-NBD-PE (Fig.2) suggests that both of these aminophospholipids are internalized and distributed by similar mechanisms in both thedrs2–1::URA3 and DRS2 strains. To address the possibility that P-C6-NBD-PS was internalized by endocytosis, Tang et al. (12Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Science. 1996; 272: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) labeleddrs2Δ cells with high concentrations of probe solubilized in Me2SO incubated on ice to inhibit endocytosis (12Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Science. 1996; 272: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Using our standard protocol to label cells on ice with P-C6-NBD-PS and M-C6-NBD-PE incorporated into liposomes resulted in no detectable fluorescence internalization using the sensitive SIT camera to capture images on the fluorescence microscope. We therefore followed the Tang et al. protocol for labeling cells on ice using high concentrations of Me2SO-solubilized NBD-lipids. Following this labeling protocol, no P-C6-NBD-PS fluorescence could be detected. However, a very low level of M-C6-NBD-PE fluorescence was detected, but no differences were observed between thedrs2–1::URA3 and DRS2 strains. Although detectable with the SIT camera, the fluorescence was too faint and diffuse to produce publishable images. Thus, for all labeling conditions in which detectable amounts of NBD-aminophospholipids were obtained, the loss of Drs2p had no effect on their internalization and distribution. These observations are inconsistent with the previous study in which P-C6-NBD-PS internalization was abolished in a drs2 mutant strain (12Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Science. 1996; 272: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The previous conclusion by Tang et al. (12Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Science. 1996; 272: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) about the function of Drs2p was based on “back exchange” experiments and was not confirmed by direct observation of internalization and distribution by fluorescence microscopy. In the back exchange measurement, inward-directed transport (flip) is inferred from the amount of NBD-phospholipid that cannot be extracted from the surface of labeled cells by incubation with bovine serum albumin. This technique has been used successfully for many years to assay NBD-phospholipid transport in blood cells and reconstituted vesicles (1Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1163-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 25Schroit A.J. Zwaal R.F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, the report by Tang et al. (12Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Science. 1996; 272: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) was the first use of back exchange to measure flip in yeast, and in the absence of proper controls, differences in the amount of NBD-phospholipid aggregates sticking to the cell wall or trapped in the periplasm or differences in the rate of NBD-phospholipid hydrolysis by periplasmic phospholipases may have been misinterpreted as differences in inward translocation. Direct observation of NBD-phospholipid internalization by fluorescence microscopy is not subject to these artifacts. One of the advantages of labeling cells with liposomes containing trace amounts ofN-Rh-DOPC is that the rhodamine fluorescence can be used to determine the extent of cell-associated NBD fluorescence resulting from stuck vesicles (26Kean L.S. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; : 1403-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24Kean L.S. Grant A.M. Angeletti C. Mahe Y. Kuchler K. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This is not possible when cells are labeled with Me2SO-solubilized NBD-phospholipids. To make a more quantitative evaluation of the results obtained by fluorescence microscopy, cells were labeled with either P-C6-NBD-PS, M-C6-NBD-PE, or M-C6-NBD-PC, and the average cell-associated NBD fluorescence per cell was obtained by flow cytometry. Fluorescent lipid accumulation was measured for drs2–1::URA3 andDRS2 strains grown at 30 °C in two different media (YPAD and SDC). Accumulation of the three NBD- phospholipids was compared at 30° and 23 °C, the nonpermissive growth temperature fordrs2–1::URA3. The ratio of the cell-associated fluorescence in drs2–1::URA3 to that ofDRS2 is presented in Table Ifor the two temperatures and growth media. Similar results were obtained for the two strains and growth media at 30 and 23 °C. However, the results differed dramatically depending on the growth media. For cells grown in YPAD, the NBD fluorescence in the null strainversus its parent was decreased from ∼30 and 50% for the two NBD-aminophospholipids as well as the choline lipid, M-C6-NBD-PC. On the other hand, for cells grown in SDC, the null strains actually accumulated ∼16% more P-C6-NBD-PS but ∼30% less M-C6-NBD-PE. The reduction in P-C6-NBD-PS and M-C6-NBD-PE internalization observed for cells grown in YPAD is consistent with the interpretation that Drs2p is an aminophospholipid translocase responsible for 30 to 50% that of the internalization measured in the parent strain. However, given the similar reduction in M-C6-NBD-PC internalization, one would have to surmise that Drs2p was not functionally homologous to its mammalian counterpart in its ability to discriminate between amino and choline head groups. On the other hand, the observation that P-C6-NBD-PS internalization is actually increased in cells lacking Drs2p grown in SDC does not support the conclusion that Drs2p is an aminophospholipid translocase. It is conceivable that drs2–1::URA3cells grown in SDC up-regulate a functional homologue that overcompensates for P-C6-NBD-PS but not for M-C6-NBD-PE internalization. A more likely interpretation is that the absence of Drs2p indirectly alters the NBD-phospholipid internalization.Table IPercent NBD-phospholipid accumulation of drs2–1::URA3 strain relative to isogenic parentNBD-phospholipidGrowth mediaaCells were grown to early log phase in either YPAD or SDC at 30 °C.Labeling temperaturebCells were labeled by incubation with donor vesicles containing the appropriate NBD-phospholipid for 30 min at the stated temperature before washing 3 times with SDC/NaN3.30 °C23 °CP-C6-NBD-PSYPAD51.3 ± 18.7 (5)53.7 ± 20.8 (5)SDC116.3 ± 15.4 (3)118.6 ± 37.2 (3)M-C6-NBD-PEYPAD70.6 ± 19.6 (5)58.6 ± 17.1 (5)SDC71.4 (1)70.5 (1)M-C6-NBD-PCYPAD66.4 ± 7.8 (2)56.1 ± 8.3 (2)Fluorescence accumulation was measured by flow cytometry.

Furthermore, its accumulation was dramatically reduced in cells allowed to grow to mid-log (optical density >1.0). 3P. K. Hanson and J. Nichols, unpublished observation. Thus, isogenic backgrounds and identical growth conditions are essential for meaningful comparisons between strains to be made. The existence of unidentified regulatory mechanisms that control the extent of NBD-phospholipid internalization provides a means by which the loss ofDRS2 could indirectly decrease NBD-lipid internalization. The amount of endogenous PS and PE in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of drs2–1::URA3 and DRS2strains was measured by TNBS labeling. No significant differences were observed in the percent of total PS or PE exposed to the outer leaflet between the two strains. Very little (<0.5%) of the total cellular PS was exposed to the outer leaflet, making it difficult to detect; however, no measurable differences were observed between the two strains. A readily detectable and reproducible amount of PE was labeled by TNBS. The percentage of total cellular PE exposed to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane was 1.4 ± 0.3 for thedrs2–1::URA3 strain and 1.6 ± 0.4 for the isogenic DRS2 parent strain. Thus, the loss of Drs2p had no significant effect on the amount of PE or PS residing in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. To facilitate detection of the Drs2p protein, we constructed a derivative of theDRS2 gene, HA::DRS2, harboring a 27-base pair sequence encoding the nine amino acid HA epitope (16Wilson I.A.

To examine the functional properties of the β5 subunit, recombinant β5γ2 dimers were purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells using a strategy based on two affinity tags (hexahistidine and FLAG) engineered into the N terminus of the γ2 subunit (γ2HF). The function of the pure β5γ2HF dimers was examined in three assays: activation of pure phospholipase C-β in lipid vesicles; activation of recombinant, type II adenylyl cyclase expressed in Sf9 cell membranes; and coupling of α subunits to the endothelin B (ETB) and M1 muscarinic receptors. In each case, the efficacy of the β5γ2HF dimer was compared with that of the β1γ2HF dimer, which has demonstrated activity in these assays. The β5γ2HF dimer activated phospholipase C-β with a potency and efficacy similar to that of β1γ2 or β1γ2HF; however, it was markedly less effective than the β1γ2HF or β1γ2 dimer in its ability to activate type II adenylyl cyclase (EC50 of ∼700 nm versus 25 nm).

Sci. 1992; 17: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 5Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) and with most cell types expressing multiple isoforms of each category. Many receptors are known to signal through several G proteins. In turn, many effectors receive signals from different isoforms of both the α and βγ subunits of G proteins (5Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 6Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Thus, an important issue in cell signaling is identification of the protein-protein interactions underlying the cellular responses to a particular stimulus. It is clear that a cellular response is the summation of many molecular interactions. A primary determinant of the outcome is selective expression of signaling molecules, as occurs in the rod outer segment of the eye where the visual receptor, rhodopsin, and its G protein transducin are the major signaling proteins in the membrane (7Yau K.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1994; 35: 9-32PubMed Google Scholar). In less specialized cells, compartmentation or targeting of the participants in a signaling cascade may determine the specificity observed in vivo (2Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 8Neubig R.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Indeed, several lines of investigation have suggested specific localization of receptors, G proteins, and effectors within the cell that may lead to selective and efficient interactions between members of a signaling cascade (9Gudermann T. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Pharm. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 429-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Moreover, critical steps in the activation of G proteins, such as the rate of exchange of GTP for GDP on the α subunit, are highly regulated processes wherein receptors, effectors, and accessory proteins such as RGS molecules are all involved in determining the kinetics of GTP/GDP exchange (10Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 11Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). At the G protein-effector level, it has long been recognized that certain α subunits selectively regulate specific effectors (2Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 3Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar, 4Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar), and recently, defined isoforms of βγ dimers have been reported to differentially activate effectors (13Zhang S. Coso O.A. Lee C. Gutkind J.S. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33575-33579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Bayewitch M.L. Avidor-Reiss T. Levy R. Pfeuffer T. Nevo I. Simonds W.F. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2273-2276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Finally, the large diversity in the G protein α and βγ subunits suggests that there are important protein-protein interactions involving the α and βγ subunits of the heterotrimer that determine specificity (4Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 9Gudermann T. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Pharm. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 429-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Indeed, selective interaction of α and βγ isoforms has been observed in vitro between the β5 subunit and α subunits in the Gq family (15Fletcher J.E. Lindorfer M.A. DeFilippo J.M. Yasuda H. Guilmard M. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 636-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As receptors coupled to the αq subunit regulate important functions in most all tissues, this latter finding makes it important to determine the functional properties of βγ dimers containing the β5 subunit. To date, there is no information about the receptors that couple to dimers containing the β5 subunit and release this potentially unique signal. Only limited data are available about the functionality of βγ dimers containing the β5 subunit. However, both the β5 subunit and its splice variant, β5L, have been shown to stimulate PLC-β2 activity when transfected into COS-7 cells with the γ2 subunit (16Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,17Watson A.J. Aragay A.M. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28154-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the β1γ2 dimer markedly activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in COS cells, whereas the β5γ2 dimer does not (13Zhang S. Coso O.A. Lee C. Gutkind J.S. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33575-33579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Moreover, the β1γ2 dimer stimulates type II adenylyl cyclase and inhibits type I adenylyl cyclase when co-transfected into these cells, but the β5γ2 subunit appears to inhibit both type I and type II cyclase activity (14Bayewitch M.L. Avidor-Reiss T. Levy R. Pfeuffer T. Nevo I. Simonds W.F. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2273-2276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that dimers containing the β5 subunit may have different functions in cell signaling from those containing other β subunits. In the experiments reported here, we have taken two approaches toward examining the function of the β5γ2 dimer. Recombinant dimers were purified using two affinity tags (hexahistidine and FLAG) engineered into the N terminus of the γ2subunit (γ2HF). In one approach, we examined the ability of the purified dimer to activate two effectors in vitro,PLC-β and type II adenylyl cyclase. In a second approach, we compared the ability of β5γ2HF and β1γ2HF dimers to support coupling of α subunits with the M1 muscarinic and ETBreceptors. The M1 muscarinic receptor was chosen because it couples selectively to Gq α subunits (18Berstein G. Blank J.L. Smrcka A.V. Higashijima T. Sternweis P.C. Exton J.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8081-8088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Offermanns S. Wieland T. Homann D. Sandmann J. Bombien E. Spicher K. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar) and the ETB receptor because it couples to both the Giand Gq α subunits (20Aramori I. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12468-12474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Elshourbagy N.A. Korman D.R. Wu H. Sylvester D.R. Lee J.A. Nuthalaganti P. Bergsma D.J. Kumar C.S. Nambi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3873-3879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results show that the β5γ2HF dimer is able to fully activate PLC-β but is much less effective at activating type II adenylyl cyclase. The β5γ2HF dimer supports coupling of Gq α subunits to M1 muscarinic and ETB receptors with an efficacy similar to that of the β1γ2HF dimer. However, in keeping with its apparent lower affinity for the Gi α subunit (15Fletcher J.E. Lindorfer M.A. DeFilippo J.M. Yasuda H. Guilmard M. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 636-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the β5γ2HF dimer does not support coupling of the Gi α subunit to the ETB receptor. Overall, the data suggest that the β5γ2dimer couples selectively to αq-linked receptors and may only interact with a limited set of effectors. Thus, in tissues such as brain where it is highly expressed, this dimer may indeed have specialized functions in cellular signaling. A clone encoding the human ETB receptor (GenBankTM accession no. L06623) was the kind gift of Dr. Ponal Nambi at SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals (21Elshourbagy N.A. Korman D.R. Wu H. Sylvester D.R. Lee J.A. Nuthalaganti P. Bergsma D.J. Kumar C.S. Nambi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3873-3879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The receptor cDNA was excised from pBluescript (Stratagene) with SacI and KpnI, further digested with MspI and subcloned into the pCNTR shuttle vector. The ETB coding sequence was excised with BamHI and subcloned into the pVL1393 baculovirus transfer vector. A recombinant baculovirus encoding the receptor was obtained by co-transfecting the transfer vector with linearized viral DNA into Sf9 cells using the Pharmingen BaculoGold® kit (15Fletcher J.E.

The recombinant baculoviruses were purified by one round of plaque purification (22Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; 1555: 1-56Google Scholar). The construction of recombinant baculoviruses coding for the Gi1, Gq, Gs α subunits, the β1, β1HF, β5, γ2 and γ2HF subunits have been described (15Fletcher J.E. Lindorfer M.A. DeFilippo J.M.

Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus encoding the ETB or M1muscarinic receptor at a multiplicity of infection of 3 and the incubation continued for 48–60 h (26Graber S.G. Figler R.A. Garrison J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 212-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Washed cell pellets were resuspended in either ETB membrane homogenization buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1% (w/v) glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 17 μg/ml PMSF, 20 μg/ml benzamidine, and 2 μg/ml of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A) or M1membrane homogenization buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 17 μg/ml PMSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) (27Parker E.M. Kameyama K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 519-527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stored frozen at −70 °C. All subsequent steps were at 4 °C or on ice. Cell pellets were thawed in ice-cold membrane homogenization buffer and burst by N2 cavitation (600 psi, 20 min). The cell lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 750 × g. The low speed supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 28,000 × g. To reduce the level of endogenous Sf9 G proteins, the pelleted membranes were resuspended in membrane resuspension buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mmMgSO4) containing 7 m urea and incubated for 30 min (28Shichi H. Somers R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7040-7046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Debburman S.K. Kunapuli P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. Mol.

The suspension was then centrifuged at 142,000 ×g for 30 min. The stripped membranes were washed twice with membrane resuspension buffer and resuspended in membrane homogenization buffer at 5–15 mg of protein/ml, frozen, and stored at −70 °C. TheB max and K d values of the receptors were measured before and after urea treatment. The binding parameters for recombinant ETB receptors were determined using 125I-endothelin-1 in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin using our published techniques (31Figler R.A. Graber S.G. Lindorfer M.A. Yasuda H. Linden J. Garrison J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1587-1595PubMed Google Scholar) and the conditions described previously (32Elshourbagy N.A. Lee J.A. Korman D.R. Nuthalaganti P. Sylvester D.R. Dilella A.G. Sutiphong J.A. Kumar C.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 465-473PubMed Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined using 10 μm unlabeled endothelin-1 and varied from 13% at 0.01 nm to 90% at 100 nm endothelin-1. Binding of the antagonist ligand [3H]QNB to the M1 muscarinic receptor was performed as described (33Wong S.K. Parker E.M. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6219-6224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a concentration range of 0.5–50 nm [3H]QNB. Nonspecific binding was determined using 10 μm atropine and was less than 10% at 50 nm [3H]QNB. TheB max and K d were determined by fitting the data to a rectangular hyperbola using the nonlinear least squares routines in the GraphPad Prizm® software. The binding parameters of the membranes as determined before and after urea treatment were as follows: ETB receptors (beforeB max, 27 pmol/mg membrane protein;K d 0.05 nm; after Bmax, 100 pmol/mg membrane protein; K d 0.1 nm); M1 muscarinic receptors (beforeB max, 2.6 pmol/mg membrane protein;K d 0.15 nm; afterB max, 2 pmol/mg membrane protein;K d 0.4 nm). These data indicate that urea treatment did not greatly change the affinity for ligand. The recombinant Gi1 α subunit and β1γ2 and β1γ2HFdimers were purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as described previously (26Graber S.G. Figler R.A. Garrison J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 212-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 34Graber S.G. Lindorfer M.A. Garrison J.C. Methods Neurosci. 1996; 29: 207-226Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The purification of Gq α was based on the method of Biddlecome et al. (35Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The Gq α subunit was expressed in Sf9 cells in combination with the β1HFγ2HF dimer at a multiplicity of infection of 3 each. The cells were harvested 48 h after infection, washed three times with insect phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in a few milliliters of Q lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 μm GDP, 17 μg/ml PMSF, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin), frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. All extractions and centrifugation steps were performed at 4 °C or on ice. Cell pellets were thawed in half the original culture volume of Q lysis buffer and lysed by nitrogen cavitation (26Graber S.G. Figler R.A. Garrison J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 212-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The lysate was centrifuged (24,000 ×g, 20 min) and the pellet resuspended in one-fourth the previous volume of Q lysis buffer containing 10 μg/ml DNase and 5 mm MgCl2 with a Dounce homogenizer. After a 15-min incubation period, the suspension was rehomogenized and repelleted. The washed pellet was resuspended in Q extraction buffer (1% cholate, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μm GDP, PMSF, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin) at 5 mg/ml total protein. The suspension was stirred for 1 h and then centrifuged (142,000 × g, 45 min). The cholate extract was frozen and stored at −70 °C. The Q chromatography buffer used to purify the Gq α subunit contained 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 17 μg/ml PMSF, and 2 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin. The cholate extract (∼100 ml) from 1.5 × 109 Sf9 cells was diluted with 400 ml of loading buffer (Q chromatography buffer containing 0.5% (v/v) Genapol C-100 and 10 μm GDP) and applied to a 15-ml Ni2+-NTA superflow agarose resin column equilibrated in loading buffer. The loaded column was washed sequentially with 75-ml volumes of loading buffer, loading buffer containing 0.5 mNaCl, loading buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and 10 mm imidazole, loading buffer containing 1 mNaCl, and loading buffer. The column was warmed to room temperature and subsequent wash and elution buffers were applied at room temperature. The column was washed with 75 ml of loading buffer containing 0.2% cholate and 3 μm GTPγS, 75 ml of Q chromatography buffer containing 0.3% cholate and finally eluted with Q chromatography buffer containing 1% cholate, 10 μm GDP, 20 μm AlCl3, 10 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm NaF. Fractions containing the Gq α subunit were pooled and concentrated on ice using an Amicon ultrafiltration apparatus and a PM10 membrane. The concentrated protein was diluted 10-fold with Q chromatography buffer containing 0.4% (w/v) cholate with 1 mm dithiothreitol substituted for 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and re-concentrated. This procedure was repeated three times. The retentate (∼1 ml) was further concentrated to approximately 100 μl in a spin concentrator (Microcon 10, Amicon). The spin concentrator was pretreated with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at room temperature and rinsed twice by centrifugation with deionized water. Approximately 10 μg of highly purified αq was recovered from 1.5 × 109 cells. The β5γ2HF subunit was generated by infecting Sf9 cells with the β5 and γ2HF viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 3 each (23Graber S.G. Figler R.A. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1271-1278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The washed cell pellet was resuspended in a few milliliters of histag lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 3 mm MgCl2, 17 μg/ml PMSF, 20 μg/ml benzamidine, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin), frozen, and stored at −70 °C. The cell pellet was thawed and lysed by nitrogen cavitation in ice-cold histag lysis buffer (26Graber S.G. Figler R.A. Garrison J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 212-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The cell lysate was centrifuged (10 min, 750 × g) and membranes were pelleted (100,000 × g, 30 min) from the low speed supernatant. The membrane pellet was resuspended in Genapol extraction buffer (histag lysis buffer containing 0.1% (v/v) Genapol C-100) at a ratio of 1 ml of buffer/20 mg of wet pellet weight and stirred on ice for 1 h. The detergent extract was centrifuged (100,000 ×g, 60 min), the supernatant decanted, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Typically, 50 ml of Genapol extract (prepared from 5 gm of cell pellet) was applied to a 5-ml FLAG M2 column equilibrated in Genapol extraction buffer, washed with 30 ml of Genapol extraction buffer, and eluted with 30 ml of 400 μm FLAG peptide in Genapol extraction buffer. This step was repeated with a second aliquot of Genapol extract. The elution fractions were pooled, the Genapol concentration adjusted to 0.5% (v/v) by addition of histag lysis buffer containing 2% Genapol C-100, and the pool applied to a 2.5-ml Ni2+-NTA agarose column equilibrated in histag-loading buffer (histag lysis buffer containing 0.5% (v/v) Genapol). The column was washed with the following buffers: 12.5 ml of histag loading buffer; 12.5 ml of histag-loading buffer plus 350 mm NaCl; 25 ml of histag-loading buffer plus 350 mm NaCl and 10 mm imidazole; 10 ml of histag-loading buffer plus 1 m NaCl; and 10 ml of histag-loading buffer. The bound β5γ2HF was eluted with 10 ml of histag-loading buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The eluted dimers were diluted one-fourth with CHAPS dilution buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 1 mm dithiothreitol), applied to a 1-ml HiTrap Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in the same buffer, washed with 10 ml of buffer and eluted with CHAPS dilution buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. The highly purified β5γ2HF was stored at −70 °C. Approximately 100 μg of the pure β5γ2HFdimer was obtained from a 10-gm Sf9 cell pellet. The purified β5γ2HF dimer was analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry to determine the extent of modification of the carboxyl terminus of its γ subunit (36Lindorfer M.A. Sherman N.E. Woodfork K.A. Fletcher J.E. Hunt D.F. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18582-18587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The deconvoluted mass spectrum of the γ2HF derived from the dimer indicated that the sample contained two molecular weight species. One species, with a molecular mass of 10,014 Da, is consistent with full processing of the γ2HF subunit: removal of the three carboxyl-terminal amino acids (-AIL), addition of a geranylgeranyl lipid to the carboxyl-terminal cysteine, and addition of a carboxylmethyl group to the carboxyl terminus. The other species, with a molecular mass of 10,024 Da, corresponded to a γ2HFsubunit that had undergone no carboxyl-terminal processing. Both species had molecular weights consistent with the removal of the amino-terminal methionine and acetylation of the resulting amino-terminal alanine. Based on analysis of two different β5γ2HF preparations, approximately half of the γ2HF subunits in the sample had a fully processed carboxyl terminus and were therefore capable of high-affinity interactions with α subunits, receptors, and effectors. Urea-treated Sf9 cell membranes expressing recombinant receptors were washed with reconstitution buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin), and resuspended at 0.5–1 mg of protein/ml in reconstitution buffer. Typically, 50 μl of membrane suspension containing 2.7 pmol of recombinant endothelin receptors (measured as125I-endothelin binding sites) or 120 fmol of recombinant M1 muscarinic receptors (measured as [3H]QNB binding sites) was mixed with 400 μl of reconstitution buffer containing 1 μm AMP-PNP and incubated on ice for 15 min. The α subunit was diluted into the mix before addition of the βγ dimer, then concentrated GDP was added to give a final concentration of 50 nm. The final concentration of Gα and βγ added to the membranes was 5–14 nm and 5–47 nm, respectively, and the receptor:G protein ratio was approximately 1:2 for the ETB receptor and 1:40 for the M1muscarinic receptor. The final concentration of CHAPS was held to less than 0.006% (w/v), and in the case of the αqexperiments, the final cholate concentration was held to less than 0.001% (w/v). The receptor:G protein mixture was incubated on ice for 45 min followed by a 10 min equilibration at 25 °C. The assay was begun by the addition of [35S]GTPγS to a final concentration of 7 nm. The ligand was added 8 min later, and membrane aliquots removed for filtration through nitrocellulose filters (Millipore, HAWP-025) every 60 s. The ability of βγ dimers to stimulate PLC-β was measured exactly as described (25Yasuda H. Lindorfer M.A. Myung C.-S. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21958-21965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The ability of the βγ subunits to activate adenylyl cyclase was measured using Sf9 insect cell membranes overexpressing recombinant, rat type II adenylyl cyclase (37Jacobowitz O. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10630-10634Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The assay was performed as described (15Fletcher J.E. Lindorfer M.A. DeFilippo J.M. Yasuda H. Guilmard M.

Using cell-free extracts from sophorose-induced and noninduced mycelia and various fragments of the cbh2 promoter of H. jecorinain electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis and performingin vitro and in vivo footprinting analysis, we detected the nucleotide sequence 5′-ATTGGGTAATA-3′ (consequently namedcbh2-activating element (CAE)) to bind a protein complex with different migration in EMSA of induced and noninduced cell-free extracts. EMSA analysis, employing oligonucleotide fragments containing specifically mutated versions of CAE, revealed that protein binding requires the presence of an intact copy of either one of two adjacent motifs: a CCAAT (=ATTGG) box on the template strand and a GTAATA box on the coding strand, whereas a simultaneous mutation in both completely abolished binding. H. jecorina transformants, containing correspondingly mutated versions of the cbh2 promoter fused to the Escherichia coli hph gene as a reporter, expressed hph in a manner paralleling the efficacy of CAE-protein complex formation in EMSA, suggesting that the presence of either of both motifs is required for induction of cbh2gene transcription. Antibody supershift experiments with anti-HapC antiserum as well as EMSA competition experiments with CCAAT binding promoter fragments of the Aspergillus nidulans amdSpromoter suggest that the H. jecorina CCAAT box binding complex contains a homologue of HapC.

Cellulose is the most abundant renewable carbon source on earth. Its recycling in nature occurs in a variety of habitats by the action of various pro- and eukaryotic microorganisms, which hydrolyse this homopolymer with extracellular enzyme systems (1Gottschalk G. Aubert J.P. Beguin P. Millet J. Biochemistry and Genetics of Cellulose Degradation. Academic Press Ltd., London1988: 3-10Google Scholar). Among the best characterized of these is the cellulase system of the saprophytic Ascomycete Hypocrea jecorina (=Trichoderma reesei, because the teleomorphic form of T. reesei has now been identified by Kuhls et al. (2Kuhls K. Lieckfeldt E. Samuels G.J. Kovacs W. Meyer W. Petrini O. Gams W. Borner T. Kubicek C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

H. jecorina cellulases are not formed during growth on easily metabolizable carbon sources but induced in the presence of cellulose (4Sternberg D. Mandels G. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 761-769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which this extracellular, insoluble polysaccharide triggers the biosynthesis of cellulases has been investigated for decades. Some workers claim a role for low constitutive levels of cellulases in the initial attack on cellulose, thereby releasing the inducer (5El-Gogary S. Leite A. Crivellaro O. Eveleigh D.E. El-Dorry H.

The nature of the actual inducer is still unknown, but depending on the conditions, either the cellulolytic end product cellobiose itself or its transglycosylation product sophorose induce cellulase formation in pregrown mycelia (3Kubicek C.P.

More recently, two laboratories described a nucleotide region, which is located closely upstream of the TATA box, to be necessary to trigger sophorose induction of cbh1(cellobiohydrolase I-encoding) gene transcription (15Ilmen M. Onnela M.L. Klemsdal S. Keränen S. Penttilä M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 303-314PubMed Google Scholar, 16Henrique-Silva F. El-Gogary S. Carle-Urioste J.C. Matheucci Jr., E. Crivellaro O. El-Dorry H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), but neither the binding motif nor the proteins binding to it have as yet been characterized. We have previously identified the area between −361 and −170 in the 5′ regulatory sequences of the cbh2 (cellobiohydrolase II-encoding) gene to be able in vitro to form a sophorose-specific DNA-protein complex (17Stangl H. Gruber F. Kubicek C.P. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Starting from these findings, we will show in this paper that within this area, a 5′-ATTGGGTAATA-3′ undecamer (that we will call “cbh2-activating element” (CAE)1) is responsible for the observed complex formation in vitro and essential forcbh2 gene expression in vivo. Evidence will also be presented that a CCAAT box-binding protein (complex) and another yet unknown protein bind to adjacent sites within this motif. T. reesei(H. jecorina) QM9414 (ATCC 26921) was used throughout this study. T. reesei (H. jecorina) TU-6 (18Gruber F. Visser J. Kubicek C.P. De Graaff L. Curr. Genet. 1990; 18: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), apyr4 negative mutant of QM9414, was used as a recipient strain for pyr4-mediated cotransformation experiments. The strains were maintained on malt agar (containing 5 mmuridine in the case of TU-6). Escherichia coli JM109 (19Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene. 1985; 33: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (11408) Google Scholar) was used for the propagation of vector molecules. Plasmids pFG1 (18Gruber F. Visser J. Kubicek C.P. De Graaff L. Curr. Genet. 1990; 18: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and pRLMex30 (20Mach R.L. Schindler M. Kubicek C.P. Curr. Genet. 1994; 25: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) were obtained from our department stock; plasmid pCR2.1 was obtained from Invitrogen Corp. (San Diego, CA). H. jecorina was grown in 250 ml of the medium described by Mandels and Andreotti (21Mandels M. Andreotti R.E. Proc. Biochem. 1978; 13: 6-13Google Scholar) in 1-liter Erlenmeyer flasks on a rotary shaker (250 rpm) at 28 °C using 108 conidia/liter (final concentration) as inoculum. Carbon sources were added as indicated for the respective experiments. For experiments with soluble inducers, the replacement technique described by Sternberg and Mandels (4Sternberg D. Mandels G. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 761-769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Mycelia, pregrown for 24 h with 1% glycerol as the carbon source were washed and resuspended in minimal medium lacking carbon source to give a final density of 0.7–1.5 g dry weight/liter. Either sophorose (final concentration 2 mm) or glucose (final concentration 1%, w/v) were added, and incubation continued for a further 3 or 5 h, respectively. The pSMZ reporter plasmids were developed from plasmid pLMRex30 and contain the E. coli hph (hygromycin B-phosphotransferase-encoding) gene fused to the H. jecorina cbh2 5′- and 3′-noncoding regions. Primers used are specified in TableI. To construct pSMZ1 (bearing thecbh2 wild-type promoter), primers CKT 006 and P 91635 were used to amplify a 613-bp fragment from the cbh2 5′-noncoding sequences, thereby also generating additional XhoI andXbaI terminal sites. This polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragment was used to replace a XhoI/XbaI fragment of the pki1 promoter in pRLMex30, thereby fusing thecbh2 promoter fragment to the E. coli hph gene, followed by the H. jecorina cbh2 terminator. To yield pSMZ2, pSMZ4, and pSMZ5 (bearing point-mutated cbh2 promoter sequences as shown in Fig.4 A), recombinant PCR as described previously by Higuchi (22Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols, A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar) was applied. For pSMZ2, primer pairs CKT 006/Pcbh2mutR2, and P 91635/Pcbh2mutF2, respectively, were used to amplify the primary PCR products from plasmid pSMZ1 as template. To construct pSMZ4, primer pairs CKT 006/Pcbh2mutR4 and P91635/Pcbh2mutF4, respectively, were used for the primary PCR, and for construction of pSMZ5, primers CKT 006/Pcbh2mutR5 and P916357/Pcbh2mutF5, respectively, were used. For construction of all plasmids (pSMZ2, pSMZ4, and pSMZ5) the secondary PCRs were performed with primers CKT 006 and P 91635, resulting in 613-bp cbh2 promoter fragments bearing point mutations as shown in Fig. 4 A, which were directly cloned in vector pCR 2.1 using the TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). From the resulting plasmids, the cbh2 promoter fragments were excised using restriction enzymes XhoI/XbaI and inserted into pSMZ1, thereby replacing the cbh2 wild-type promoter sequences. All vectors were verified by double strand sequencing by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52227) Google Scholar), and the restriction enzyme sites generated were proven via restriction enzyme analysis.Table IOligonucleotides used throughout this study.NameSequenceCommentsP1c5′-TGA AGC ATC ATC ACG ATG TGG TAT T-3′(from −124 to −148)P2c5′-GTA TTC GGG AGC ACA GGA TAA AGC C-3′(from −144 to −168)P3c5′-GGA GCA CAG GAT AAA GCC CGG AGA GT-3′(from −151 to −176)P1n5′-ATC TCT CTT ATT GCA TTT CTG CCC TT-3′(from −394 to −370)P2n5′-TTC TGC CCT TCC CAC TAA CTC AGG-3′(from −378 to −357)P3n5′-TGC CCT TCC CAC TAA CTC AGG GTG C-3′(from −375 to −353)CKT 0065′-atG AAT TcT CGA GGC TAG GTA TGC GAG GCA CG-3′(from −613 to −586P 916355′-att cta gaG GTG CAA TAC ACA GAG GGT-3′(from −2 to −19)Pcbh2mutF25′-GCT TCT TTA AAG GGT AAT ATA CAG CCA GGC 3′(from −253 to −224)Pcbh2mutR25′-GCC TGG CTG TAT ATT ACC CTT TAA AGA AGC-3′(from −224 to −253)Pcbh2mutF45′-GCT TCT TTA AAG GGTTTT ATA CAG CCA GGC-3′(from −253 to −224Pcbh2mutR45′-GCC TGG CTG TAT AAA ACC CTT TAA AGA AGC-3′(from −224 to −253Pcbh2mutF55′-GCT TCT TTA TTG GGT TTT ATA CAG CCA GGC-3′(from −253 to −224)Pcbh2mutR55′-GCC TGG CTG TAT AAA ACC CAA TAA AGA AGC-3′(from −224 to −253)pcbh2F5′-CAC GCG GAT CCA GGG CAG AC-3′(from −589 to −570)pcbh2R5′-atg gat cCA TCG TGC AAT ACA CAG AGG GTG ATC TTA C-3′(from −0 to −27)CKT 0575′-gat cGC TTC TTT ATT GGG TAA TAT ACA GCC AGG CGG GG-3′(from −253 to −220)CKT 0585′-gat cCC CCG CCT GGC TGT ATA TTA CCC AAT AAA GAA GC-3′(from −220 to −253)CKT 0635′-gat cGC TTC TTT ATT GGG TTT TAT ACA GCC AGG CGG GG-3′(from −253 to −220)CKT 0645′-gat cCC CCG CCT GGC TGT ATA AAA CCC AAT AAA GAA GC-3′(from −220 to −253)CKT 0655′-gat cGC TTC TTT AAA GGG TAA TAT ACA GCC AGG CGG GG-3′(from −253 to −220)CKT 0665′-gat cCC CCG CCT GGC TGT ATA TTA CCCTTT AAA GAA GC-3′(from −220 to −253)CKT 0675′-gat cCA CTC CAC ATG TTA AAG GCG CAT TCA ACC AGC TTC-3′(from −283 to −249)CKT 0685′-gat cGA AGC TGG TTG AAT GCG CCT TTA ACA TGT GGA GTG-3′(from −249 to −283)CKT 0695′-gat cGG GTA ATA TAC AGC CAG GCG GGG ATG AAG CTC ATT AGC C-3′(from −242 to −204)CKT 0705′-gat cGG CTA ATG AGC TTC ATC CCC GCC TGG CTG TAT ATT ACC C-3′(from −204 to −242)CKT 0835′-gat cGC TTC TTT AAA GGG TTT TAT ACA GCC AGG CGG GG-3′(from −253 to −219)CKT 0845′-gat cCC CCG CCT GGC TGT ATA AAA CCC TTT AAA GAA GC-3′(from −219 to −253)OamdS(F)5′-CGT AAA ATT CGG CGA AGC CGC CCA TCA CCA GCT AGG CAC CA-3′(from −160 to −119); (39)OamdS(R)5′-TAG CTG GTG CCT AGC TGG TGA TTG GCT GGC TTC GCC GAA TTT-3′(from −115 to −156)OxlnDwt(F)5′-gat cAA TGC CGG CTA AAT CAT TCA GGC TAA ACC CCC GCG A-3′(from −159 to −124); (33)OxlnDwt(R)5′-gat cTC GCG GGG GTT TAG CCT GAA TGA TTT AGC CGG CAT T-3′(from −124 to −159)OxlnDmut(F)5′-gat cAA TGC CGT CTA AAT CAT TCA GTC TAA ACC CCC GCG A-3′(from −159 to −124); (33)OxlnDmut(R)5′-gat cTC GCG GGG GTT TAG ACT GAA TGA TTT AGA CGG CAT T-3′(from −124 to −159)Positions of the oligonucleotides in the respective promoter are given; lowercase letters indicate bases added for labeling or generating restriction enzyme sites; underlined bases indicate introduced point mutations.

Genomic DNA and mRNA were isolated as described by Gruber et al. (18Gruber F. Visser J. Kubicek C.P. De Graaff L. Curr. Genet. 1990; 18: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and Chomczynski and Sacchi (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62891) Google Scholar), respectively. After electrophoretic separation, RNA was blotted onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized according to standard protocols (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at 42 °C for 20 h. Washing was performed with 2× SSC(1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) + 0.1% SDS at 42 °C(2 × 15 min). Standard methods were used for plasmid isolation, restriction enzyme digestion, random priming and Southern analysis (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All PCR amplifications were performed by the aid of Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) in a Biometra thermocycler. E. coli transformations were carried out according to standard techniques (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transformation ofT. reesei (H. jecorina) TU-6 was carried out as described by Gruber et al. (26Gruber F. Visser J. Kubicek C.P. De Graaff L. Curr. Genet. 1990; 18: 447-451Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) using cotransformation of pFG1 with linear 2.6-kb HindIII/EcoRI fragments of the pSMZ vectors (Fig. 4 A). Southern hybridization was carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA was digested withEcoRI, and hybridization was performed using a 862-bpEcoRI fragment of the vector pSMZ1 bearing 613 bp of thecbh2 promoter and 249 bp of the hph gene labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Signals observed upon fluorography for the single-copy gene cbh2 and for intact, integrated vector copies, respectively, were calculated by imager analysis. Values were corrected by including the length of the labeled probe. The copy numbers were calculated by dividing the values observed by imager analyses through the length of the labeled probe. To confirm the point mutations in the cbh2 promoter (generating a DraI restriction enzyme site) in transformants bearing the pSMZ2 and pSMZ4 plasmids, chromosomal DNA was digested withDraI/XhoII/ClaI, and hybridization was performed with a 2.6-kb XhoI/HindIII fragment of the vector pSMZ1 bearing the cbh2 promoter and terminator sequences and the hph structural gene labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Transformants were analyzed for hygromycin B resistance by means of a plate assay essentially as described previously (27Mach R.L. Strauss J. Zeilinger S. Schindler M. Kubicek C.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). DNA fragments used for EMSA were generated as follows. A cbh2 fragment containing the regulatory nucleotide regions from −263 to −170 was prepared by PCR amplification of a 613-bp fragment of thecbh2 upstream regulatory sequences using primers pcbh2F and pcbh2R and subsequent digestion with DdeI, HhaI, and HpaII. A 94-bp fragment was isolated and end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Sequenase version 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After purification by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, binding was achieved by incubating 100 μg of cell-free extracts with 5 ng of labeled fragment on ice for 10 min. Preparation of cell-free H. jecorina extracts following growth on various carbon sources was carried out as described previously (17Stangl H. Gruber F. Kubicek C.P. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because maximal accumulation of cbh1- andcbh2-mRNA was observed after 5 h of incubation with sophorose, we prepared protein extracts from mycelia harvested after 3 h. The binding assay and acrylamide gel electrophoresis have been described previously (17Stangl H. Gruber F. Kubicek C.P. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For competition experiments, synthetic oligonucleotides were used in a 10-, 50-, or 150-fold molar excess. The oligonucleotides were annealed with the complementary synthetic oligonucleotide as described by Strauss et al. (28Strauss J. Mach R.L. Zeilinger S. Stöffler G. Wolschek M. Hartler G. Kubicek C.P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). After annealing, double strands were filled in using Sequenase version 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Oligonucleotides used for EMSA were also annealed with their complementary oligonucleotides and end-labeled using Sequenase version 2.0 and [α-32P]dCTP as described above. The resulting double-stranded oligonucleotides were purified by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and binding was achieved by incubating 100 μg of cell-free extracts with 25 ng of labeled oligonucleotide. For supershift assays 5 μl of polyclonal anti-HapC antiserum were added to the binding reaction. In vitromethylation protection and hydrazine interference footprinting was performed with a 191-bp DNA fragment containing upstream regulatory sequences of the cbh2 gene from −361 to −171. The fragment was generated by digestion of a 613-bp PCR product withHpaII, and the resulting 233-bp fragment was isolated and end-labeled on the coding strand using Sequenase version 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and [α-32P]dCTP. After labeling, the probe was digested with DdeI, and the resulting 191-bp fragment was purified by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Labeling on the noncoding strand was performed by cleaving the 233-bp HpaII fragment with DdeI and labeling the digestion reaction with [α-32P]dATP using Sequenase version 2.0, and purification of the resulting 191-bp fragment by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. In vitro methylation protection footprinting was performed by incubating 3 × 106 counts of end-labeled DNA fragment with 100 μg of cell-free extract as described above, methylating with dimethylsulfate, and subjecting the mixture to EMSA analysis. After separation by native gel electrophoresis, complexes were visualized by autoradiography, excised, eluted, purified, and cleaved with piperidine (G) or 0.5 m HCl, 0.1 mNaOH, 1 mm EDTA (A/G) as described previously (29Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (5377) Google Scholar). After resuspension in loading buffer, the samples were applied to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 6% sequencing gel as described by Strauss et al. (28Strauss J. Mach R.L. Zeilinger S. Stöffler G. Wolschek M. Hartler G. Kubicek C.P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In vitro hydrazine interference footprinting was performed by incubating 300,000 counts of end-labeled, hydrazine-treated DNA fragment (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with 100 μg of cell-free extract and separating the bound and free probes by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After elution and purification, the samples were cleaved with piperidine, suspended in loading buffer, and loaded on a 6% sequencing gel. T. reesei (H. jecorina) QM9414 was cultivated as described above. Methylation of genomic DNA was performed at 30 °C in a shaking water bath by transferring 18-ml aliquots of the cultures to 100-ml Erlenmeyer flasks at the indicated time points and incubating them with 40 μl of dimethyl sulfate in 2 ml of 200 mm MES buffer (pH 5.5) for 2 min. Methylation was stopped by addition of 50 ml of ice-cold TLEβ buffer (10 mm Tris (pH = 8), 1 mm EDTA, 300 mm LiCl, 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol). Mycelial samples were filtered and washed twice with 50 ml of TLEβ buffer, and genomic DNA was extracted following a standard protocol. The extracted methylated DNA was cleaved at guanine bases by incubation with 20 μl of piperidine for 30 min at 90 °C followed by three sequential ethanol precipitations and was finally dissolved in Tris-EDTA at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml. To cleave guanine as well as adenine bases, extracted methylated DNA was incubated on ice for 2 h with 25 μl of 1 m HCl. After precipitation with ethanol, the DNA was dissolved in 180 μl of bidistilled water and incubated at 90 °C for 30 min with 20 μl of 1 m NaOH, followed by a second precipitation with ethanol. Finally, DNA was dissolved in Tris-EDTA at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml. In vitro methylation and cleavage of genomic DNA was performed as described by Mueller and Wold (30Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Methylated and cleaved DNA was analyzed by ligation-mediated PCR as described by Garrity and Wold (31Garrity P.A. Wold B.J. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and modified by Wolschek et al. (32Wolschek M. Narendja F. Karlseder J. Kubicek C.P. Scazzocchio C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3862-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and primer sets P1c, P2c, and P3c for visualizing the coding strand and P1n, P2n, and P3n for visualizing the noncoding strand (cf. Table I). When H. jecorina is pregrown on a carbon source not inducing cellulase formation (glycerol) and then replaced to a medium containing the inducer sophorose, a transient accumulation of cbh1 andcbh2 mRNA is triggered (Fig.1 A). This pattern of expression is also paralleled by that of transcript formation of other cellulase-encoding genes (e.g. egl1 andegl2; data not shown). Fusion of 613 bp of the upstream regulatory region of the cbh2 gene to the E. colihygromycin B phosphotransferase (hph) gene as a reporter mimicked this induction (Fig. 1 A), thus providing evidence for a sophorose-responding element within these 613 bp. Within these 613 bp, a 191-bp fragment has previously been identified to form a unique complex with proteins isolated from sophorose-induced or glucose-grown mycelia (17Stangl H. Gruber F. Kubicek C.P. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To further delimit this area, we prepared extracts from cultures replaced on glucose or sophorose and subjected them to EMSA with three smaller DNA fragments spanning this area. Hereby, the binding ability was retained by a 94-bp fragment, spanning from −263 to −170 (Fig. 1 B and C). Consequently, this fragment was further analyzed by competition experiments using three synthetic oligonucleotides spanning overlapping parts of this region (Fig. 1, B and C). Competition was only achieved with CKT 057, whereas oligonucleotides CKT 067 and CKT 069 were unable to specifically compete (Fig. 1,B and C), suggesting that the area between −250 and −243 was essential for complex formation. Hence sophorose-specific protein binding seems to be confined to a relatively short motif within the 613 bp. To precisely identify the protein binding sequence, we performed in vitro footprinting with cell-free extracts of H. jecorina: methylation protection demonstrated protein contact with G−241 of the coding strand (Fig. 2 C). In addition, the involvement of T−238, T−239, and T−246 on the template strand was shown by hydrazine interference (Fig. 2, A and C). Interestingly, despite the different mobility of the protein-DNA complexes from induced and noninduced mycelia, essentially the same protection/interference pattern was observed under both conditions. To investigate whether the observed binding in vitroactually reflects the binding conditions in vivo, we performed in vivo genomic footprinting by the aid of ligation-mediated PCR of the respective area of the cbh2upstream regulatory region. To this end, methylated DNA was isolated from mycelia, treated with HCl, and cleaved with NaOH (29Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (5377) Google Scholar) before the respective PCR amplification steps. Thereby, several purine bases on the coding strand within and in the direct neighborhood of the region previously identified in vitro were identified to be involved in protein-DNA contact (Fig. 2 B); on the template strand, no protection of As within the identified motif could be detected. Consistent with the results from in vitrofootprinting, essentially the same protection pattern was observed under all conditions tested. Summarizing the in vitro and in vivo data, we therefore propose that the nucleotide area"

To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of different fragments of the 5′-UTR from human PABP cDNA on the translation of the β-galactosidase (β-Gal) reporter gene. Presence of the A-rich sequence from the 5′-UTR of PABP mRNA inhibited expression of the chimeric β-Gal gene in transfected HeLa cells. The differences in expression of β-Gal polypeptide was due to the translational repression of β-Gal mRNA containing the A-rich 5′-UTR of PABP mRNA. The A-rich region of the 5′-UTR located within nucleotides 58–146 of PABP mRNA was sufficient to mediate translational control of this mRNA expression. We also examined the effect of overexpression of PABP mRNA in HeLa cells. The ectopic PABP mRNA without the A-rich 5′-UTR region was translated efficiently, whereas the translation of the endogenous PABP mRNA was substantially inhibited in the transfected cells. In contrast, the ectopic PABP mRNA containing the A-rich 5′-UTR region did not show similar effect on the translation of the endogenous PABP mRNA in these cells. These results suggest that feedback control of mRNA translation is involved in regulating PABP expression in HeLa cells.

Cellular mRNAs are often complexed with a group of RNA-binding proteins. One of the best studied RNA-binding proteins is the 72-kDa poly(A)-binding protein (PABP),1 that shows specific interaction with the 3′ poly(A) region of all eukaryotic mRNAs (1Sachs A.B. Bond M.W.

The poly(A)-binding region contains 90 amino acid domains (1Sachs A.B. Bond M.W. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1986; 45: 827-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 2Grange T.

Biol. 1989; 9: 2756-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Plants and mammals both contain several related polypeptides with specific affinity toward the poly(A) region of the mRNA. These PABP-related polypeptides show tissue-specific expression and may be regulated by growth conditions (4Belostotsky D.A. Meagher R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6686-6690Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5Yang H. Collins S. Duckett H.J. Lindsten T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6770-6776Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PABP is essential for viability of eukaryotic cells and is involved in regulating mRNA translation and stability. Results of both in vitro (6Bernstein P. Peltz S.W. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and in vivo (7Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) studies suggest that the complex of PABP and poly(A) tail plays an important role in mRNA translation. It is believed that the poly(A)-PABP complex is involved in joining the 60 S subunit to the 48 S preinitiation complex (7Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). PABP also stimulates the binding of 40 S subunits to the mRNA (8Tarun Jr., S.Z. Sachs A.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The ability of PABP to interact with the eIF4G and eIF4B is important for its role in the initiation of mRNA translation (9Tarun Jr., S.Z. Sachs A.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7168-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 10Tarun Jr., S.Z. Wells S.E. Deardoroff J.A. Sachs A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Tanguay R.L. Balasta M.L. Wei C.-C. Browning K.S. Metz A.M. Goss D.J. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16247-16255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not clear whether the free PABP or PABP-poly(A) complex is involved in mRNA translationin vivo. In addition, PABP is also involved in poly(A) tail shortening probably through its interaction with a poly(A)-specific 3′-exonuclease (12Craig A.W.B. Haghighat A. Yu A.T.K. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1998; 392: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 14Ko C.G. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10448-10456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar).Several studies indicated that PABP expression is regulated at the post-transcriptional level during the cell cycle (15Maundrell K.

Bag J. Sells B.H. Biol. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 770-778Google Scholar). In resting cells, the majority of cellular PABP mRNA was found in the non-translated state. Following stimulation of growth by serum, a rapid transition of the mRNA to the translated state occurred in mouse fibroblasts (19Thomas G. Thomas G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2137-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Berger L.C. Bag J. Sells B.H. Biol. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 770-778Google Scholar). In contrast, during differentiation of murine myoblasts growth arrest resulted in the migration of repressed PABP mRNA to the translated state. This process was also accompanied by reduced stability of the PABP mRNA in differentiated myotubes resulting in little change in PABP synthesis (18Adamou J. Bag J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).Translation of a specific mRNA is often regulated by the interaction of regulatory proteins with defined sequences of the mRNA. For instance, feedback control of ribosomal protein L10 synthesis by the level of free L10 protein is mediated by its binding to the 5′-UTR of the L10 mRNA (21Dean D. Yates J.L. Nomura M. Nature. 1981; 289: 89-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Baughman G. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5389-5393Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Similarly, synthesis of ferritin is regulated in vertebrates by the iron level (23Eisenstein R.S. Munro H.N. Enzyme (Basel). 1991; 44: 42-58Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The inhibition of ferritin mRNA translation requires the binding of a 98-kDa translation repressor polypeptide to the conserved 25-nucleotide-long sequence of its 5′-UTR (24Neupert B. Thompson N.A. Meyer C. Kuhn L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 25Dandekar T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1903-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In addition the 3′-UTR of some mRNAs is involved in regulating translation. The translations of protamine (26Braun R.E. Peschon J.J. Behringer R.R. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and myocyte enhancer factor-2a mRNAs are controlled by RNA-binding proteins that interact with sequences located within the 3′-UTR of these mRNA (27Black B.L. Lu J. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2756-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). How the 3′-end of these mRNAs influence ribosome binding at the 5′-end is unknown. It is possible that 3′-UTR binding protein(s) may interfere with the function of poly(A)-PABP complex.In contrast to the examples cited above, regulation of PABP mRNA translation appears to be more subtle. Instead of completely blocking PABP mRNA translation, the distribution of this mRNA between translationally active and inactive populations is modulated. Interestingly, analysis of PABP mRNA sequences in various species showed the presence of conserved highly A-rich sequence in its 5′-UTR. This raises the possibility of negative feedback control of PABP mRNA translation. Previous studies from this and other laboratories have shown that PABP is able to bind to the 5′-UTR A-rich regions and inhibit PABP mRNA translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate cell-free system (28Bag J. Wu J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29de Melo Neto O.P. Standart N. de Sa C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 34: 2198-2205Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and removal of this sequence from the PABP mRNA enhances its translation in vitro. We have also shown that the translation of full-length PABP mRNA, but not the truncated mRNA from which the A-rich region of the 5′-UTR was removed, can be inhibited in a cell-free system by adding purified human PABP. Furthermore, by using UV-mediated cross-linking of RNA and proteins, we have shown that PABP binds to the first 224 nucleotides of the 5′-UTR of PABP mRNA, and this may repress its own expression (28Bag J. Wu J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore in the present study, we extended these investigations to determine whether similar inhibition of mRNA translation occursin vivo by the A-rich 5′-UTR of PABP mRNA. We have also examined if PABP synthesis was regulated in HeLa cells when the attempt was made to increase PABP synthesis by ectopic expression of this mRNA.DISCUSSIONThe presence of approximately 60% adenine base between nucleotides 71 and 131 of the PABP mRNA 5′-UTR offers potential PABP-binding site(s) for autoregulation of its translation. In support of this autoregulation model it was shown that removal of the first 223 nucleotides of its 5′-UTR improves PABP synthesis in vitro(28Bag J. Wu J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29de Melo Neto O.P. Standart N. de Sa C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 34: 2198-2205Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the studies reported here further examination of the influence of this oligo(A)-rich 5′-UTR sequence in cultured HeLa cells also demonstrated the inhibitory effect of PABP on mRNA translation. The presence of the 58–146 nucleotides from PABP mRNA 5′-UTR resulted in inhibition of translation of the reporter β-Gal mRNA in HeLa cells. Although the adenine-rich region was located between nucleotides 71 and 131, we used a slightly larger region (nucleotides 58–146) of the 5′-UTR in our analyses. Due to the predominance of a single base the A-rich region was not clonable without some flanking sequences. The results of our studies did not rule out the possibility of other regulatory sequences existing within the 5′-UTR of PABP mRNA. PABP mRNA translation appeared to be differently regulated in different cells (5Yang H. Collins S. Duckett H.J. Lindsten T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6770-6776Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Ullrich S.J. Appela E. Mercer W.E. Exp. Cell. Res. 1988; 178: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 17Mercer W.E. Jaskulski D. Shields M.T. Exp. Cell. Res. 1989; 181: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 18Adamou J. Bag J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that its translation can be regulated by sequence(s) other than the putative PABP-binding sequence in other cell lines or in a tissue-specific manner. It is conceivable that the presence of cell-specific RNA-binding proteins may be involved in differential regulation of translation of PABP mRNA. However, our major concern was to test the possibility of autoregulation and the potential role of the oligo(A)-rich sequence in mRNA translation in vivo. To test further this model, we examined the effect of ectopic expression of this mRNA on the translation of endogenous mRNA. Our results showed that translation of the endogenous PABP mRNA was repressed when attempts were made to overexpress PABP. These results suggest that the level of PABP and its mRNA may determine how much of the cytoplasmic pool of the PABP mRNA is translated. This checkpoint in PABP expression depends on the presence of the A-rich region of its 5′-UTR.In cells transfected with the PABP expression vectors, the mRNA levels were increased by more than 2-fold. But only a modest increase (25%) in the PABP level was found (Fig. 7). In the cells expressing the unregulated ectopic mRNA, this was achieved by almost completely blocking the translation of endogenous mRNA and translating the ectopic mRNA. On the other hand when the ectopic mRNA had the auto-regulatory sequence (ARS) both endogenous and ectopic mRNAs translation were controlled. However, the translation of the ectopic PABP mRNA with a shorter 5′-UTR and the ARS positioned closer to the initiation codon than in the endogenous mRNA was repressed more than that of the endogenous mRNA. The reason for this difference is not clear but may reflect the influence of other regulatory sequences. As a result of nearly complete inhibition of the ectopic mRNA translation and a small shift of the endogenous PABP mRNA to the non-translated state, the levels of PABP in these cells were reduced by 50%. Thus, there was over-compensation of PABP expression.The precise mechanism of PABP-mediated feedback control of translation is not known. However, the results suggest that 48 S preinitiation complexes were formed but were not efficiently converted to the initiation complex. It is therefore possible that binding of PABP at the ARS may decrease the rate of the 40 S ribosomal subunit movement along the mRNA. According to this model the distance between the initiation codon and the ARS is unlikely to have a major influence on mRNA translation. The distance of the ARS from the 5′-cap region, however, might have stronger influence than that of the ARS and the AUG codon. This is conceivable since the 3′ poly(A)-PABP complex may be involved in the translation initiation through its interaction with the eIF4G. Therefore, formation of a similar complex close to the 5′-capped end may mute their functional interaction. Further studies are required to understand how ARS-PABP complex works.Feedback control of PABP mRNA translation may serve an important purpose in regulating the cellular level of free PABP. Under normal circumstances, cytoplasmic PABP is present in excess over the availability of the poly(A)-binding sites (37Gorlach M. Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The reason for the presence of free PABP is not clear. However, some of this may result from degradation or shortening of the poly(A) tail. Presence of multiple poly(A)-binding domains in PABP (38Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3268-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) potentially contributes to the dynamic nature of its interaction with the 3′ poly(A) tail (39Greenberg J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2923-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This could allow movement of PABP between the 3′ poly(A) tail and other lower affinity PABP binding sequences (37Gorlach M. Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) including the ARS at the 5′ UTR of PABP mRNA. How efficiently PABP would interact with the lower affinity binding sequences may depend on its cellular level.Presumably an optimal level of PABP is required for maintaining an equilibrium between its various functions. Our studies have shown that the presence of the putative PABP-binding site at the 5′-UTR of PABP mRNA reduces by approximately 3-fold the translation of this mRNA both in vitro (28Bag J. Wu J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and in vivo (Fig. 3). Although the presence of a certain excess amount of PABP is tolerated and may even be required for normal cellular function, its expression beyond a threshold could be controlled at the mRNA translation level. Excess PABP beyond the threshold level may detrimentally alter the pattern of protein synthesis in the cell, for example by increasing translation of inherently inefficient mRNAs. In addition stability of some unstable mRNAs may also increase if excess PABP is made. Together, these events could have a dramatic effect on the growth regulation and cellular differentiation. This possibility is supported by the previous observation that overexpression of eIF4E results in cellular transformation (41Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Since the role of PABP in translation is believed to be mediated through its interaction with the cap structure and eIF4G (of which eIF4E is a component), it will be important to control PABP expression through feedback mechanisms. This is further supported by the observation that overexpression of PABP in Xenopus oocytes influenced the deadenylation and translation of maternal mRNAs (42Wormington M. Searfoss A.M. Hurney C.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 900-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cellular mRNAs are often complexed with a group of RNA-binding proteins. One of the best studied RNA-binding proteins is the 72-kDa poly(A)-binding protein (PABP),1 that shows specific interaction with the 3′ poly(A) region of all eukaryotic mRNAs (1Sachs A.B. Bond M.W.

PABP is essential for viability of eukaryotic cells and is involved in regulating mRNA translation and stability. Results of both in vitro (6Bernstein P. Peltz S.W. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and in vivo (7Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) studies suggest that the complex of PABP and poly(A) tail plays an important role in mRNA translation. It is believed that the poly(A)-PABP complex is involved in joining the 60 S subunit to the 48 S preinitiation complex (7Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). PABP also stimulates the binding of 40 S subunits to the mRNA (8Tarun Jr., S.Z. Sachs A.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The ability of PABP to interact with the eIF4G and eIF4B is important for its role in the initiation of mRNA translation (9Tarun Jr., S.Z. Sachs A.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7168-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 10Tarun Jr., S.Z. Wells S.E. Deardoroff J.A. Sachs A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 432-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The interactions between PABP and these initiation factors also take place in absence of poly(A) (11Le H. Tanguay R.L. Balasta M.L. Wei C.-C. Browning K.S. Metz A.M. Goss D.J. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16247-16255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not clear whether the free PABP or PABP-poly(A) complex is involved in mRNA translationin vivo. In addition, PABP is also involved in poly(A) tail shortening probably through its interaction with a poly(A)-specific 3′-exonuclease (12Craig A.W.B. Haghighat A. Yu A.T.K. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1998; 392: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 14Ko C.G. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10448-10456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Several studies indicated that PABP expression is regulated at the post-transcriptional level during the cell cycle (15Maundrell K. Imaizumi-Scherrer M.T. Maxwell E.S. Civeli O. Scherrer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1387-1390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ullrich S.J. Appela E. Mercer W.E. Exp. Cell. Res. 1988; 178: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 17Mercer W.E.

Sells B.H. Biol. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 770-778Google Scholar). In resting cells, the majority of cellular PABP mRNA was found in the non-translated state. Following stimulation of growth by serum, a rapid transition of the mRNA to the translated state occurred in mouse fibroblasts (19Thomas G. Thomas G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2137-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Berger L.C. Bag J. Sells B.H. Biol. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 770-778Google Scholar). In contrast, during differentiation of murine myoblasts growth arrest resulted in the migration of repressed PABP mRNA to the translated state. This process was also accompanied by reduced stability of the PABP mRNA in differentiated myotubes resulting in little change in PABP synthesis (18Adamou J. Bag J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Translation of a specific mRNA is often regulated by the interaction of regulatory proteins with defined sequences of the mRNA. For instance, feedback control of ribosomal protein L10 synthesis by the level of free L10 protein is mediated by its binding to the 5′-UTR of the L10 mRNA (21Dean D. Yates J.L. Nomura M. Nature. 1981; 289: 89-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Baughman G. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5389-5393Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Similarly, synthesis of ferritin is regulated in vertebrates by the iron level (23Eisenstein R.S. Munro H.N. Enzyme (Basel). 1991; 44: 42-58Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The inhibition of ferritin mRNA translation requires the binding of a 98-kDa translation repressor polypeptide to the conserved 25-nucleotide-long sequence of its 5′-UTR (24Neupert B. Thompson N.A. Meyer C. Kuhn L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 25Dandekar T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1903-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In addition the 3′-UTR of some mRNAs is involved in regulating translation. The translations of protamine (26Braun R.E. Peschon J.J. Behringer R.R. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and myocyte enhancer factor-2a mRNAs are controlled by RNA-binding proteins that interact with sequences located within the 3′-UTR of these mRNA (27Black B.L. Lu J. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2756-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). How the 3′-end of these mRNAs influence ribosome binding at the 5′-end is unknown. It is possible that 3′-UTR binding protein(s) may interfere with the function of poly(A)-PABP complex. In contrast to the examples cited above, regulation of PABP mRNA translation appears to be more subtle. Instead of completely blocking PABP mRNA translation, the distribution of this mRNA between translationally active and inactive populations is modulated. Interestingly, analysis of PABP mRNA sequences in various species showed the presence of conserved highly A-rich sequence in its 5′-UTR. This raises the possibility of negative feedback control of PABP mRNA translation. Previous studies from this and other laboratories have shown that PABP is able to bind to the 5′-UTR A-rich regions and inhibit PABP mRNA translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate cell-free system (28Bag J. Wu J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29de Melo Neto O.P. Standart N. de Sa C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 34: 2198-2205Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and removal of this sequence from the PABP mRNA enhances its translation in vitro. We have also shown that the translation of full-length PABP mRNA, but not the truncated mRNA from which the A-rich region of the 5′-UTR was removed, can be inhibited in a cell-free system by adding purified human PABP. Furthermore, by using UV-mediated cross-linking of RNA and proteins, we have shown that PABP binds to the first 224 nucleotides of the 5′-UTR of PABP mRNA, and this may repress its own expression (28Bag J. Wu J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore in the present study, we extended these investigations to determine whether similar inhibition of mRNA translation occursin vivo by the A-rich 5′-UTR of PABP mRNA. We have also examined if PABP synthesis was regulated in HeLa cells when the attempt was made to increase PABP synthesis by ectopic expression of this mRNA. DISCUSSIONThe presence of approximately 60% adenine base between nucleotides 71 and 131 of the PABP mRNA 5′-UTR offers potential PABP-binding site(s) for autoregulation of its translation. In support of this autoregulation model it was shown that removal of the first 223 nucleotides of its 5′-UTR improves PABP synthesis in vitro(28Bag J. Wu J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29de Melo Neto O.P. Standart N. de Sa C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 34: 2198-2205Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the studies reported here further examination of the influence of this oligo(A)-rich 5′-UTR sequence in cultured HeLa cells also demonstrated the inhibitory effect of PABP on mRNA translation. The presence of the 58–146 nucleotides from PABP mRNA 5′-UTR resulted in inhibition of translation of the reporter β-Gal mRNA in HeLa cells. Although the adenine-rich region was located between nucleotides 71 and 131, we used a slightly larger region (nucleotides 58–146) of the 5′-UTR in our analyses. Due to the predominance of a single base the A-rich region was not clonable without some flanking sequences. The results of our studies did not rule out the possibility of other regulatory sequences existing within the 5′-UTR of PABP mRNA. PABP mRNA translation appeared to be differently regulated in different cells (5Yang H. Collins S. Duckett H.J. Lindsten T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6770-6776Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Ullrich S.J. Appela E. Mercer W.E. Exp. Cell. Res. 1988; 178: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 17Mercer W.E. Jaskulski D. Shields M.T. Exp. Cell. Res. 1989; 181: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 18Adamou J. Bag J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that its translation can be regulated by sequence(s) other than the putative PABP-binding sequence in other cell lines or in a tissue-specific manner. It is conceivable that the presence of cell-specific RNA-binding proteins may be involved in differential regulation of translation of PABP mRNA. However, our major concern was to test the possibility of autoregulation and the potential role of the oligo(A)-rich sequence in mRNA translation in vivo. To test further this model, we examined the effect of ectopic expression of this mRNA on the translation of endogenous mRNA. Our results showed that translation of the endogenous PABP mRNA was repressed when attempts were made to overexpress PABP. These results suggest that the level of PABP and its mRNA may determine how much of the cytoplasmic pool of the PABP mRNA is translated. This checkpoint in PABP expression depends on the presence of the A-rich region of its 5′-UTR.In cells transfected with the PABP expression vectors, the mRNA levels were increased by more than 2-fold. But only a modest increase (25%) in the PABP level was found (Fig. 7). In the cells expressing the unregulated ectopic mRNA, this was achieved by almost completely blocking the translation of endogenous mRNA and translating the ectopic mRNA. On the other hand when the ectopic mRNA had the auto-regulatory sequence (ARS) both endogenous and ectopic mRNAs translation were controlled. However, the translation of the ectopic PABP mRNA with a shorter 5′-UTR and the ARS positioned closer to the initiation codon than in the endogenous mRNA was repressed more than that of the endogenous mRNA. The reason for this difference is not clear but may reflect the influence of other regulatory sequences. As a result of nearly complete inhibition of the ectopic mRNA translation and a small shift of the endogenous PABP mRNA to the non-translated state, the levels of PABP in these cells were reduced by 50%. Thus, there was over-compensation of PABP expression.The precise mechanism of PABP-mediated feedback control of translation is not known. However, the results suggest that 48 S preinitiation complexes were formed but were not efficiently converted to the initiation complex. It is therefore possible that binding of PABP at the ARS may decrease the rate of the 40 S ribosomal subunit movement along the mRNA. According to this model the distance between the initiation codon and the ARS is unlikely to have a major influence on mRNA translation. The distance of the ARS from the 5′-cap region, however, might have stronger influence than that of the ARS and the AUG codon. This is conceivable since the 3′ poly(A)-PABP complex may be involved in the translation initiation through its interaction with the eIF4G. Therefore, formation of a similar complex close to the 5′-capped end may mute their functional interaction. Further studies are required to understand how ARS-PABP complex works.Feedback control of PABP mRNA translation may serve an important purpose in regulating the cellular level of free PABP. Under normal circumstances, cytoplasmic PABP is present in excess over the availability of the poly(A)-binding sites (37Gorlach M. Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The reason for the presence of free PABP is not clear. However, some of this may result from degradation or shortening of the poly(A) tail. Presence of multiple poly(A)-binding domains in PABP (38Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3268-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) potentially contributes to the dynamic nature of its interaction with the 3′ poly(A) tail (39Greenberg J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2923-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This could allow movement of PABP between the 3′ poly(A) tail and other lower affinity PABP binding sequences (37Gorlach M. Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) including the ARS at the 5′ UTR of PABP mRNA. How efficiently PABP would interact with the lower affinity binding sequences may depend on its cellular level.Presumably an optimal level of PABP is required for maintaining an equilibrium between its various functions. Our studies have shown that the presence of the putative PABP-binding site at the 5′-UTR of PABP mRNA reduces by approximately 3-fold the translation of this mRNA both in vitro (28Bag J. Wu J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and in vivo (Fig. 3). Although the presence of a certain excess amount of PABP is tolerated and may even be required for normal cellular function, its expression beyond a threshold could be controlled at the mRNA translation level. Excess PABP beyond the threshold level may detrimentally alter the pattern of protein synthesis in the cell, for example by increasing translation of inherently inefficient mRNAs. In addition stability of some unstable mRNAs may also increase if excess PABP is made. Together, these events could have a dramatic effect on the growth regulation and cellular differentiation. This possibility is supported by the previous observation that overexpression of eIF4E results in cellular transformation (41Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Since the role of PABP in translation is believed to be mediated through its interaction with the cap structure and eIF4G (of which eIF4E is a component), it will be important to control PABP expression through feedback mechanisms. This is further supported by the observation that overexpression of PABP in Xenopus oocytes influenced the deadenylation and translation of maternal mRNAs (42Wormington M. Searfoss A.M. Hurney C.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 900-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).

To investigate the hypothesis that increasing cAMP inhibits mTOR, the protein kinase activity of mTOR was measured in an immune complex assay with recombinant PHAS-I as substrate. Both forskolin and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3′-5′-monophosphate (CPT-cAMP) prevented the activation of mTOR by insulin in adipocytes, but neither agent affected mTOR activity when added directly to the immunopurified protein. In contrast, the cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline, inhibited mTOR activity not only when added to intact adipocytes but also when added to immunopurified mTOR in vitro, demonstrating that certain methylxanthines are able to inhibit mTOR independently of increasing cAMP. Forskolin and CPT-cAMP blocked the effect of insulin on increasing mTOR phosphorylation, which was assessed using mTAb1, an antibody whose binding is inhibited by phosphorylation of mTOR. Although the mTAb1 epitope contains a consensus site for protein kinase B, neither agent inhibited the activation of protein kinase B produced by insulin.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18531-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar,4Price D.J. Grove J.R. Calvo V. Avruch J. Bierer B.E. Science. 1992; 257: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), and overexpression of mTOR increases the phosphorylation of both proteins (5Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B.

Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). These and other findings have established that mTOR controls these two regulators of mRNA translation. p70S6K phosphorylates ribosomal protein S6 and increases translation of mRNAs having the polypyrimidine tract (TOP) motif (7Jeffries H.B.J. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The activation of p70S6K is a function of a complex pattern of phosphorylation mediated by three or more protein kinases that phosphorylate at least 10 sites (8Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 9Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 181-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The rapamycin-sensitive sites, which by inference are those regulated by mTOR, include three in which the phosphorylated Ser/Thr is flanked by aromatic residues and one which fits a (Ser/Thr)-Pro motif (10Han J.-W. Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21396-21403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Nonphosphorylated PHAS-I binds tightly to eIF4E (11Lin T.-A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 12Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gringas A.C. Donze O. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PHAS-I leads to the dissociation of the PHAS-I·eIF4E complex (11Lin T.-A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar,12Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gringas A.C. Donze O. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). This allows eIF4E to bind eIF4G to generate the complex that is needed for the efficient binding and/or scanning by the 40 S ribosomal subunit. In rat adipocytes, five (Ser/Thr)-Pro sites in PHAS-I are phosphorylated in response to insulin (14Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Rapamycin attenuates, but does not abolish, the effects of insulin on the phosphorylation of these sites. The failure of rapamycin to inhibit fully the effect of insulin supports the view that an mTOR-independent pathway also contributes to the control of PHAS-I (15Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Significant progress has been made in understanding mechanisms involved in mTOR signaling. mTOR contains an essential COOH-terminal catalytic domain that is homologous to the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase (1Abraham R.T. Wiederrecht G.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 483-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar,2Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1996; 86: 517-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Although the possibility that mTOR functions as a lipid kinase has not been eliminated, mTOR has been shown to phosphorylate PHAS-Iin vitro (6Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 16Brunn G.J. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar), indicating that it is a member of the family of PI 3-kinase-related enzymes that signal as protein kinases. The finding that mTOR phosphorylates PHAS-I is also of practical importance as it has provided a means to assess mTOR activity. Incubating 3T3-L1 adipocytes with insulin was recently found to increase the PHAS-I kinase activity of mTOR (18Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The increase in activity produced by insulin correlated closely with an increase in the phosphorylation of mTOR. Furthermore, the effect of insulin was reversed by incubating mTOR in vitro with protein phosphatase 1, indicating that the effect of insulin was due to phosphorylation of mTOR (18Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). A site potentially responsible for activation is near the COOH terminus of mTOR in a stretch of 20 amino acids that form the epitope for the antibody, mTAb1 (16Brunn G.J. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32547-32550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of mTOR markedly inhibited binding of mTAb1, and incubating mTOR with phosphatase restored binding (18Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The effects of insulin on mTOR in 3T3-L1 adipocytes were abolished by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin. Moreover, selectively activating PKB with tamoxifen in MER-Akt cells, which express a PKB-estrogen receptor fusion protein that is rapidly activated when tamoxifen binds (19Kohn A.D. Barthel A. Kovacina K.S. Boge A. Wallach B. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Scott P.H. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11937-11943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), mimicked insulin by increasing both the phosphorylation and activity of mTOR (18Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that PI 3-kinase and PKB are upstream regulators of mTOR. Pharmacological or genetic disruption of mTOR function may have striking inhibitory effects on mRNA translation and cell proliferation (1Abraham R.T. Wiederrecht G.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 483-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 2Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1996; 86: 517-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Although inhibition of mTOR activity is clearly a potential mechanism for regulation of cellular function, inactivation of mTOR by physiological regulators has not been described. Increasing cAMP has been shown to decrease the phosphorylation of PHAS-I and p70S6K in certain cell types (20Graves L.M. Bornfeldt K.E. Argast G.M. Krebs E.G. Kong X. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C.

In this report, we present evidence that these effects of cAMP result from inactivation of mTOR. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were cultured in 10-cm diameter dishes and used in experiments 8–10 days after removing the differentiation medium (3Lin T.-A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18531-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Except for the32P-labeling experiments (described in the legend to Fig.1), cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2.5 h in HEPES-buffered saline (145 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 1.4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm NaPi, 5 mm glucose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4) and then incubated with insulin and other agents as indicated. To terminate the incubation, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were rinsed and homogenized in 1 ml of Homogenization Buffer, which contained 50 mm NaF, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1 μm microcystin-LR, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm KPi, and 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4. Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatants were retained for analyses. The protein content was determined by using bicinchoninic acid (24Smith P.K. Krohn R.I.

To generate antibodies to PKB, a peptide (CVDSERRPHFPQFSYSASSTA) having a sequence identical to that of the last 21 amino acids in PKBα was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and the peptide-hemocyanin conjugates were used to immunize rabbits as described previously (26Sevetson B.R. Kong X. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10305-10309Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The PKB antibodies were affinity purified by using columns containing resin prepared by coupling the peptide to Sulfolink beads (Pierce). Immunoprecipitations were conducted using either non-immune IgG or the appropriate antibodies coupled to protein A-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, antibodies (5 μg) were incubated for 1 h at 23 °C with protein A-agarose beads (20 μl of a 1:1 suspension) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (150 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The beads were then washed 3 times (1 ml/wash) and suspended in TBS (20 μl). Extract samples (800 μl) were incubated with beads for 90 min at 4 °C and then washed (1 ml buffer/wash). For PHAS-I immunoprecipitations, beads were washed twice with 1 ml of Buffer A (1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), twice with Buffer A plus 0.5m NaCl, and then twice with Buffer A. For mTOR immunoprecipitations, beads were washed twice with Buffer A, twice with Buffer A plus 0.5 m NaCl, and twice with Buffer B (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 μm microcystin-LR, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). For PKB immunoprecipitations, beads were washed twice with Buffer C (0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and twice with Buffer D (10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5). To elute PHAS-I from immune complexes, the beads were rinsed with 1 ml of H2O, suspended in 150 μl of 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and incubated at 95 °C for 15 min. After centrifuging the samples at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was retained for analyses of PHAS-I. When samples of mTOR or PKB were to be subjected to SDS-PAGE, proteins were eluted in SDS-sample buffer (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207479) Google Scholar). When protein kinase activities were to be assessed, beads were suspended in 50 μl of the appropriate reaction mixture. mTOR and PKB activities were measured in the same extract samples. Extracts (800 μl) were first incubated with the mTOR antibody, mTAb2 (16Brunn G.J. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32547-32550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), coupled to protein A-agarose. After centrifuging the samples, the supernatants were retained for measuring PKB activity (described below), and the pellets containing the mTOR immune complexes were washed as described above. To assess mTOR activity, the beads were suspended in 50 μl of mTOR Reaction Mix that contained the following: 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm PKA inhibitory peptide (28Cheng H.-C. Kemp B.E.

Supernatants remaining after removing the mTOR immune complexes were incubated with PKB antibodies coupled to protein A-agarose. The beads were then washed and suspended in a reaction mixture identical to that described previously (30Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), except that histone 2B was substituted for myelin basic protein. mTOR and PKB samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 and 23 °C, respectively, before the reactions were terminated by adding SDS sample buffer. Samples of PHAS-I that had been immunoprecipitated from 32P-labeled 3T3-L1 adipocytes were digested with lysyl endopeptidase C (Wako Pure Chemicals) and chymotrypsin (Boehringer Mannheim) before phosphopeptides were resolved by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described previously for phosphorylation site analysis of rat adipocyte PHAS-I (14Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207479) Google Scholar), and 32P-labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography of the dried gels. mTOR (16Brunn G.J.

Pause A. Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) were detected by immunoblotting. Glutathione S-transferase-FKBP12 was expressed in bacteria and purified as described previously (31Sabers C.J. Martin M.M. Brunn G.J. Williams J.M. Dumont F.J. Wiederrecht G. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 815-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Recombinant human insulin was from Eli Lilly. Forskolin, theophylline, and CPT-cAMP were from Sigma. Rapamycin was from Calbiochem. [γ-32P]ATP was from NEN Life Science Products, and Na32Pi was from ICN Pharmaceuticals. Both rapamycin and increasing cAMP promote dephosphorylation of PHAS-I in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (3Lin T.-A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18531-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 21Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30199-30204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As a step in determining whether rapamycin and cAMP affect a common upstream regulator of PHAS-I, experiments were conducted to determine whether forskolin, an agent that increases intracellular cAMP, affected the same sites in PHAS-I as rapamycin. Peptide mapping followed by amino acid sequence analyses was previously used to identify Thr36, Thr45, Ser64, Thr69, and Ser82 as sites of phosphorylation in PHAS-I in rat adipocytes (14Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These five residues, as well as the sites for cleavage by the proteases used in the previous mapping studies (14Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), are present in 3T3-L1 PHAS-I (3Lin T.-A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J.

A. 1994; 91: 3730-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Indeed, except for peptides containing Ser82, 3T3-L1 PHAS-I would be expected to yield fragments identical to those derived from rat PHAS-I. Thus, we were able to resolve phosphorylation sites in PHAS-I from 3T3-L1 adipocytes by using the strategies developed for analyses of the rat protein. To label sites in PHAS-I, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in medium containing 32Pi. After incubating with the indicated additions, extracts of the cells were prepared. [32P]PHAS-I was then immunoprecipitated and digested with lysyl endopeptidase. The resulting phosphopeptides were subjected to reverse phase-HPLC (Fig. 1 A). Three peaks, designated LE-P1, LE-P2, and LE-P3, eluted in the same position as peaks derived from rat PHAS-I (14Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In view of the near identity of rat (25Hu C. Pang S. Kong X. Velleca M. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3730-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and 3T3-L1 (3Lin T.-A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18531-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) PHAS-I proteins (Fig.1 C), it seems reasonable to assume that the peaks represent the phosphorylation sites identified previously (14Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thus, LE-P1 and LE-P2 are presumed to contain Thr69 and Ser64, respectively. Thr36 and Thr45 are recovered in a fragment eluting in LE-P3. These two sites may be resolved after digesting this fragment with chymotrypsin (14Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and the peaks designated CT-P1 and CT-P2 correspond to peptides containing Thr45 and Thr36, respectively (Fig.1 B). A relatively small third peak containing a peptide with phosphorylated Ser82 was previously detected after digesting LE-P3 from rat adipocyte PHAS-I with chymotrypsin (14Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10240-10247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This peak was absent in samples derived from the 3T3-L1 protein. Thus, Ser82 does not seem to be phosphorylated to a significant level in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The effects of insulin, rapamycin, and forskolin on the phosphorylation of sites was assessed by measuring the 32P contents of the appropriate peak fractions. Insulin increased the amount of32P recovered in peptides containing Thr36, Thr45, Ser64, and Thr69 (Fig.2). Rapamycin and forskolin had relatively small effects on the phosphorylation of PHAS-I in the absence of insulin; however, the two agents inhibited the effect of insulin on increasing the phosphorylation of the four sites. Thus, increasing cAMP with forskolin was associated with a change in the pattern of PHAS-I phosphorylation that was similar to that produced by inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin. The phosphorylation states of all four sites were also decreased by wortmannin, consistent with the effect of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor to block activation of mTOR (18Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). To determine whether increasing cAMP in cells inhibited mTOR, adipocytes were incubated with forskolin, CPT-cAMP, and theophylline before mTOR activity was measured in an immune complex assay with recombinant [H6]PHAS-I as substrate (Fig.3). As previously reported (18Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), insulin increased the [H6] PHAS-I kinase activity of mTOR by approximately 2.5-fold. Forskolin and CPT-cAMP were without effect on mTOR activity when cells were incubated in the absence of insulin, but both agents markedly inhibited the activation of mTOR by insulin. Like forskolin and CPT-cAMP, theophylline prevented the activation of mTOR by insulin; however, theophylline also decreased basal mTOR activity, suggesting that the mechanism of its inhibitory effect differed from that of the other two agents. Further evidence for different mechanisms of action was obtained in a control experiment in which agents were included in the reaction mixture used to measure mTOR activity. Neither forskolin nor CPT-cAMP affected the PHAS-I kinase activity of mTOR immunoprecipitated from either rat brain or 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig.4). This result was expected as the actions of these agents are presumed to require stimulation of cAMP production and/or activation of PKA, which would not occur in thein vitro kinase assay. Including theophylline in the assay markedly decreased the PHAS-I kinase activity of mTOR, indicating that theophylline is capable of inhibiting mTOR by a mechanism that does not involve increased cAMP.Figure 4Effects of incubating immunoprecipitated mTOR with forskolin, CPT-cAMP, and theophylline on mTOR activity. mTOR was immunoprecipitated from extracts of 3T3-L1 adipocytes or rat brain (16Brunn G.J.

Immune complexes were incubated in mTOR Reaction Mix without additions or with 50 μm forskolin, 0.5 mm CPT-cAMP, or 5 mm theophylline.

Thus, we were able to determine whether increasing cAMP prevented phosphorylation of this site by performing immunoblotting experiments with mTAb1. Incubating cells with insulin markedly decreased mTAb1 binding without affecting mTAb2 binding, which serves as an index of the relative amount of mTOR present (Fig.5 A). Forskolin, CPT-cAMP, and theophylline were without effect on mTAb1 binding in the absence of insulin, but all three agents prevented the effect of insulin on decreasing mTAb1 binding (Fig. 5 B). The results support the hypothesis that the agents block the activation of mTOR by preventing the phosphorylation of the protein. We next determined whether increasing cAMP affected the activity of PKB (Fig. 6), an upstream element in the mTOR signaling pathway (18Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation and activation of PKB is associated with a decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of the enzyme when analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Insulin treatment of cells retarded the mobility of approximately half of the PKB, which was detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 6 A). The mobility shift produced by insulin was associated with an increase of approximately 5-fold in PKB activity (Fig. 6 B), assessed in an immune complex assay with histone 2B as substrate (Fig. 6 A). Neither forskolin nor CPT-cAMP decreased PKB activity when added to adipocytes incubated without insulin or when added to cells prior to insulin (Fig.6 B). Consistent with these observations, neither agent affected the electrophoretic mobility of PKB (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, theophylline blocked the gel shift produced by insulin and abolished the stimulatory effect of the hormone on PKB activity. The present results with forskolin and CPT-cAMP indicate that increasing intracellular cAMP leads to attenuation of the effect of insulin on activating mTOR. As mTOR is known to have a central role in the control of both mRNA translation and cell proliferation, an important implication is that inhibition of mTOR is involved in the potent inhibitory effects of cAMP on these processes in certain cell types. Although the control by mTOR may be complex, some of the mechanisms involved have been elucidated and provide at least a partial explanation of how cAMP-dependent inhibition of mTOR could lead to inhibition of protein synthesis and mitogenesis. Based on studies with rapamycin, it is clear that inhibiting mTOR would lead to dephosphorylation of the translational regulators, PHAS-I and p70S6K (9Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 181-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 15Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem.

Decreased phosphorylation of both proteins has been shown to occur in response to increased cAMP, at least in certain cell types (20Graves L.M. Bornfeldt K.E. Argast G.M. Krebs E.G. Kong X. Lin T.-A.

J. 1996; 318: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of the appropriate sites in p70S6K results in inactivation of the kinase, less phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, and reduced synthesis of those messages having the polypyrimidine tract motif (9Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 181-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of PHAS-I results in increased binding of PHAS-I to eIF4E and inhibition of the translation of capped mRNA (15Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Overexpressing eIF4E in cells may have a potent mitogenic effect, suggesting that eIF4E is involved in the control of cell proliferation (32De Benedetti A. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8212-8216Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 33Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Our studies do not directly address this possibility, but it is interesting to speculate that cAMP-induced inhibition of mTOR and the decrease in eIF4E function resulting from dephosphorylation of PHAS-I might contribute to the antiproliferative effects of increased cAMP. Another mechanism through which compromised mTOR signaling could affect cell cycle progression involves p27Kip1, a heat-stable inhibitor of G1 cyclin-Cdk activities. Inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin results in stabilization of p27Kip1, thereby preventing the increase in cyclin-Cdk activities needed for G1 progression (34Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M.-H. Massague J. Crabtree G.R. Roberts J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 35Kato J. Matsuoka M. Polyak K. Massague J. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cAMP has also been shown to increase p27Kip1 (35Kato J. Matsuoka M. Polyak K. Massague J. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), and it is an intriguing hypothesis that the actions of both rapamycin and cAMP on the inhibitor result from inhibition of mTOR. Arguing against this hypothesis is evidence that the mechanisms by which rapamycin and cAMP increase p27Kip1are different (35Kato J. Matsuoka M. Polyak K. Massague J. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Rapamycin appears to decrease the rate at which p27Kip1 is degraded (34Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M.-H. Massague J. Crabtree G.R. Roberts J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar), whereas increased cAMP has been reported to increase the synthesis of the inhibitor (35Kato J. Matsuoka M. Polyak K. Massague J. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). The conclusion that inhibition of mTOR contributes to the effects of increased cAMP on PHAS-I and p70S6K does not imply that cAMP lacks effects on the phosphorylation of these proteins by other mechanisms. The observation that forskolin promoted a greater decrease than rapamycin in the phosphorylation of Thr45 and Thr36 would be consistent with the involvement of an mTOR-independent effect of cAMP on these two sites in PHAS-I. The activation of p70S6K in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is attenuated by the MAP kinase kinase inhibitor, PD 098059, suggesting that one or more members of the MAP kinase family may be involved in the control of p70S6K (36Scott P.H. Lawrence Jr., J.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Increasing cAMP has been shown to inhibit the MAP kinase signaling pathway in several cell types (37Graves L.M. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 43-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of cAMP on MAP kinase activation is not observed in all cells. Likewise, in contrast to our findings in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, neither forskolin nor cAMP derivatives decreased the activation of p70S6K in Swiss 3T3 cells (10Han J.-W. Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21396-21403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 38Frost V. Morley S.J. Mercep L. Meyer T. Fabbro D. Ferrari S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26619-26625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In these cells, the activation of p70S6K was still markedly inhibited by methylxanthine phosphodiesterase inhibitors, even though cAMP levels were not significantly changed. These results support the conclusion that methylxanthines act by a cAMP-independent mechanism to block activation of p70S6K. Based on the fact that methylxanthine phosphodiesterase inhibitors were used to enhance cAMP production in a study of the effect of cAMP on p70S6K(22Monfar M. Lemon K.P. Grammer T.C. Cheatham L. Chung J. Vlahos C.J. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), it was argued that the inhibitory effects on kinase activation were due to the methylxanthine instead of increased cAMP (10Han J.-W. Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21396-21403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 38Frost V. Morley S.J. Mercep L. Meyer T. Fabbro D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26619-26625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This is unlikely to be the case, as experiments in several cell types, including 3T3-L1 adipocytes, have shown that cAMP derivatives and agents that increase cAMP markedly inhibit activation of p70S6K in the absence of methylxanthines (20Graves L.M. Bornfeldt K.E. Argast G.M. Krebs E.G. Kong X. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7222-7226Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 21Lin T.-A.

Plevin R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The most straightforward interpretation is that the inhibitory effects of methylxanthines and increased cAMP are mediated by at least two different mechanisms. Methylxanthines could inhibit activation of mTOR by blocking activation of the upstream effector, PKB (Fig. 6). However, based on the finding that theophylline markedly inhibited mTOR activityin vitro (Fig. 4), we propose that methylxanthines directly inhibit mTOR. Because this direct mechanism would presumably operate in all cells expressing mTOR, it could account for the inhibitory effects of methylxanthines on the phosphorylation of p70S6K and PHAS-I in cells lacking the response to cAMP. As discussed below, increasing cAMP presumably acts by activating PKA, which phosphorylates an upstream regulator of mTOR phosphorylation. The indirect mechanism could explain why the response to cAMP is not observed in all cell types, since factors such as the level of expression of regulatory elements or the presence of opposing pathways could determine whether mTOR activity was decreased. Studies from several laboratories have implicated activation of PKB in the effects of insulin on PHAS-I (19Kohn A.D. Barthel A. Kovacina K.S. Boge A. Wallach B. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Scott P.H.

Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5315-5322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and we have recently obtained evidence implicating PKB in the activation of mTOR by insulin (18Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Therefore, we considered the possibility that increasing cAMP might inhibit activation of mTOR by preventing the activation of PKB. This hypothesis can be eliminated since neither forskolin nor CPT-cAMP affected the activation of PKB in response to insulin (Fig. 6) under conditions in which the agents markedly attenuated the activation of mTOR by the hormone (Fig. 3). The failure to affect PKB activation also indicates that inhibition of upstream signaling from the insulin receptor cannot explain the actions of cAMP. mTOR contains consensus sites for phosphorylation by PKA (42Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we have attempted to test the hypothesis that mTOR is inactivated by PKA. However, we were not able to phosphorylate mTOR in vitro with purified catalytic subunit of PKA or to affect mTOR kinase activity by incubating mTOR immune complexes with the catalytic subunit. 2P. H. Scott and J. C. Lawrence, Jr., unpublished observations. These negative findings do not eliminate the possibility that PKA can phosphorylate mTOR under the appropriate conditions. However, the finding that increased cAMP opposes the effect of insulin on mTOR phosphorylation, as assessed by mTAb1 binding (18Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), provides further support for the interpretation that the effects of cAMP are not mediated by direct phosphorylation of mTOR by PKA. The recent finding that activation of PKB by tamoxifen in MER-Akt cells resulted in activation of mTOR and the loss of mTAb1 binding indicates that activation of PKB is sufficient for the activation of mTOR, at least in some cell types (18Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). As discussed previously (18Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), the mTAb1 epitope contains an almost ideal consensus site for phosphorylation by PKB, but we have not been able to demonstrate direct phosphorylation of this site by PKB. Thus, although there is a strong argument for placing PKB upstream of mTOR in the signaling pathway, PKB may not directly phosphorylate mTOR. In order to understand the action of cAMP, it will be necessary to identify the protein kinase(s) responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of mTOR. As a working hypothesis, we suggest that there is an intervening kinase, designated TORK, between PKB and mTOR. A model in which activation of PKB or PKA resulted in activation or inhibition of TORK would be consistent with the available results pertaining to the regulation of mTOR by insulin and cAMP."

As their native counterparts, Kir1.1 channels are gated by intracellular pH, with acidification leading to channel closure. Although a lysine residue (Lys80) close to the first hydrophobic segment M1 has been identified as the pH sensor, little is known about how opening and closing of the channel is accomplished. Here we investigate the gating process of Kir1.1 channels exploiting their state-dependent modification by water-soluble oxidants and sulfhydryl reagents. Mutagenesis of all intracellular cysteines either alone or in combination revealed two residues targeted by these reagents, one in the N terminus (Cys49) and one in the C terminus (Cys308) of the channel protein. Both sites reacted with the thiol reagents only in the closed state and not in the open state.

Potassium homeostasis is controlled by secretion of K+ions across the apical membrane of cortical collecting duct cells in the kidney. As the channels responsible for K+ secretion, low conductance (35 pS) inwardly rectifying K+ channels with particular high sensitivity to changes in intracellular pH (pHi) were identified (1Wang W.

Intracellular acidification in the physiological range reversibly reduced open probability of these channels and is thought to account for the subsequent decrease in K+ secretion (1Wang W. Schwab A. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F494-F502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the sensitivity of the apical K+ channel to pHi is assumed to play a key role in K+ homeostasis (2Wang W.

Splicing results in variable length of the respective N termini with ROMK2 shortened by 19 amino acids and ROMK3 exhibiting an extension of 7 residues with respect to ROMK1. ROMK channels are members of a superfamily of structurally and functionally related K+ channel proteins (Kirchannels, for review see Refs. 7Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Curr. Opin.

As deduced from the primary structure, these K+ channel subunits are made up of hydrophilic N and C termini that flank a well conserved core region. The latter consists of two hydrophobic segments (M1 and M2) and a putative P region (4Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C.

The common functional property of Kirchannels is their inwardly rectifying current-voltage relation (I-V), which may be weak or strong and which is due to a voltage-dependent block of the channel pore by intracellular polyamines (14Fakler B.

The steady-state current-pHi relation shows a pHi value for half-maximal activation (pH0.5) of 6.9 and a Hill coefficient of around 3, indicating cooperativity of the gating process (19Fakler B.

As the determinant responsible for sensing pHi we have identified a lysine residue (Lys80) close to M1 whose protonation triggers pH-dependent gating (19Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U.

Electrophysiological recordings were performed 3–7 days after injection using the giant patch-clamp recording as described previously (17Fakler B. Brändle U. Glowatzki E. Weidemann S. Zenner H.P. Ruppersberg J.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 149-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Briefly, pipettes were made from thick walled borosilicate glass had resistances of 0.3–0.6 mΩ (tip diameter of 20–30 μm) and were filled with 120 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES and 1.8 mm CaCl2; currents were sampled at 10 kHz and corrected for capacitative transients with an EPC9 amplifier (HEKA electronics, Lamprecht, Germany), with analog filter set to 3 kHz (−3 db). Cytoplasmic solution was applied to excised patches via a multi-barrel pipette and had the following composition: 100 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mmK2EGTA, (total K+ of 120 mm); pH was adjusted to the values indicated by titration with HCl or KOH, respectively. All experiments were performed at room temperature (approximately 23 °C). Fractional recovery of oxidized channels by DTT (relative recovery) was calculated as follows: relative recovery = [I pH8.0(+DTT) −I pH8.0(after)]/[I pH8.0(before) − I pH8.0(after)] whereI pH8.0(+DTT) indicates the steady-state current amplitude at pHi8.0 in the presence of DTT,I pH8.0(after) indicates current amplitude at pHi8.0 after acidification, andI pH8.0(before) indicates current amplitude at pHi8.0 before acidification. The values are presented as mean ± S.D. of n experiments. The pH-dependent gating of Kir1.1 channels as recorded in giant inside-out patches from Xenopus oocytes at a membrane potential of −80 mV (intermittently stepped to 50 mV for 50 ms) is illustrated in Fig. 1. Intracellular acidification (from pHi 8.0 to pHi 6.0) closes channels down, and alkalinization results in reopening (Fig.1 A and Ref. 19Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brändle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Complete recovery from pH inactivation,i.e. reopening of all channels, was seen upon short acidifications (Fig. 1 A, left panel), whereas only a fraction of channels could be recovered after longer periods in pHi 6.0 (Fig. 1 A, right panel). As shown previously (19Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brändle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 27Choe H. Zhou H. Palmer L. Sackin H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F516-F529PubMed Google Scholar), unitary conductance and open probability of single channels did not change during acidification or alkalinization. Because the incomplete recovery was reminiscent of “channel run-down,” a phenomenon well known for Kir channels, Mg-ATP (28McNicholas C.M. Wang W. Ho K. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Proc Natl Acad Sci U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8077-8081Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 29Fakler B. Brändle U. Glowatzki E. Zenner H.-P. Ruppersberg J.P.

Science. 1996; 273: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 26Huang C.-L. Feng S. Hilgeman D. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar,30Sui J. Petit-Jacques J. Logothetis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), both reported to counteract run-down, were tested. As shown in Fig. 1 B, neither reagent was able to restore channel activity. Addition of DTT (100 μm) or reduced glutathione (5 mm) to the pHi 8.0 solution led to complete recovery even after prolonged acidification (n = 12, Fig. 1 C). This suggests that oxidation occurs during acidification, which subsequently prevents channels from recovery from pH inactivation. Redox sensitivity of Kir1.1 channels was further investigated with reagents that differentially interact with sulfhydryl-groups. Cu(II)-1,10-phenantroline (Cu-Phen), which induces formation of disulfide bonds, largely reduced the fraction of channels that spontaneously recovered upon realkalinization (Fig. 2 A). Addition of DTT to the pHi 8.0 solution still resulted in complete recovery from pH inactivation (Fig. 2 A, n = 2). In contrast, when reagents that chemically modify cysteine residues such as MTSES or DTNB were applied at acidic pHi, DTT failed to recover channels from pH inactivation (Fig. 2, B andC, n > 10). The increase in current observed upon realkalinization in the experiments in Fig. 2 (B andC) most likely represented unmodified channels because no recovery was seen when application of DTNB was extended to periods longer than ≈2 min (not shown). These results indicate that Cu-Phen-induced oxidation is reversible, whereas modification by DTNB or MTSES irreversibly locks channels in a closed state. To more closely characterize modification by DTNB and its relation to pH-dependent gating, experiments were performed where DTNB was applied at pHi 8.0 either before or after pH-induced inactivation,i.e. when channels were either in the open or pH-inactivated state. As shown in Fig. 3 (Aand B), DTNB did not affect open channels at pHi8.0, nor did preapplication of DTNB change subsequent pH gating (n = 3). In contrast, when DTNB was applied during DTT-induced recovery from pH inactivation, the recovery process was promptly stopped (Fig.3 C, n = 5). As before (Fig. 3 A), DTNB did not induce inactivation in this experiment. Thus, under identical conditions, channels were only susceptible to chemical modification when they were pH-inactivated prior to DTNB application. This coupling of chemical modification to pH inactivation was confirmed by experiments with a mutation of Kir1.1, Kir1.1(K80M), in which the pH sensor has been removed and which therefore did not exhibit pH-dependent gating (19Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brändle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 (D–F), no effect of DTNB was observed, neither at basic nor at acidic pHi (Fig. 3, D andF, n = 4). The reversible decrease in current amplitude seen at pHi 6.0 reflects a weak pH dependence also known for pH-insensitive Kir2.1 (IRK1) channels and at least in part due to block of channels by hydrogen ions (19Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brändle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that Kir1.1 channels are targeted by DTNB in a state-dependent manner,i.e. channels are modified in the pH-inactivated state but not in the open state. This state dependence together with the fact that DTNB specifically modifies cysteine residues was exploited to see which domains of the Kir1.1 protein move during pH-dependent gating. For this purpose all cysteines in the Kir1.1 sequence were replaced by alanine or serine (Fig.4 A). Mutations in the N and C termini outside the “core region” (hydrophobic domains M1 and M2 and the P region) resulted in functional channels gated by intracellular pH, whereas no currents were observed upon expression of the two Cys → Ala/Ser exchanges in the P region (C121(A/S) and C153(A/S)). The functional mutations were tested for recovery from pH inactivation in the presence of DTT after they were inactivated by a 50-s application of the pHi 6.0 solution either in the absence (control) or presence of DTNB. As shown in Fig. 4 (B andC), all mutants recovered very similar to WT under control conditions, and DTNB modification was not abolished by either of the single C to A/S exchanges. However, the fractional recovery from inactivation after DTNB modification observed in C49A and C308A was significantly larger than for WT or any of the other mutants (Fig.4 B) and led to the assumption that DTNB modification may occur at more than one cysteine. This was indeed verified, because in the double mutant Kir1.1(C49A,C308A) recovery from pH inactivation in the presence of DTT was complete, independent of whether DTNB was added to the inactivation solution (Fig.5). These results show that the cysteine residues modified by sulfhydryl reagents in a state-dependent manner are Cys49in the N terminus and Cys308 in the C terminus of the Kir1.1 protein. Moreover, the results indicate that pH-dependent gating in these channels is accompanied by structural rearrangements in both intracellular N and C termini. The results presented here show that pH-dependent opening and closing of Kir1.1 channels is accompanied by conformational changes of the channel protein involving movement of domains in the intracellular N and C termini. This movement was visualized by state-dependent modification of Cys49 and Cys308, which were susceptible to reaction with DTNB in the pH-inactivated state, whereas no modification was observed for open channels. Besides modification by DTNB or MTSES, channels were also oxidized in a state-dependent manner. Cu-Phen applied at pHi 6.0 prevented channels from recovery from inactivation, an effect that could be fully reversed by application of the reducing agent DTT (Fig.2). But although oxidation and reduction were induced by agents specific for formation and reduction of disulfide bonds, no significant alteration of the redox sensitivity was observed in either of the Cys → Ala/Ser mutations. Moreover, oxidation was also observed in the double-mutant Kir1.1(C49A,C308A), which completely abolished state-dependent modification by DTNB (Fig. 5) as well as in the triple mutants Kir1.1(C308A,C355A,C358A) and Kir1.1(C49A, C175A,C308A). When all cysteines outside the core region were replaced by alanine, no channel activity was detected upon functional expression. Thus, we could not identify the cysteine(s) involved in oxidation nor exclude a role for a protein putatively associated with ROMK. The reducing agents DTT and reduced glutathione were required for complete recovery from pH inactivation in excised inside-out patches. In living cells, however, the redox sensitivity most likely has no physiological implication, because reduced glutathione should be available in millimolar concentrations. Moreover, experiments with nitric oxide (NO, SIN-1, and S-nitrosocysteine as NO donors), which replaced DTNB in activation of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (31Broillet M.-C. Firestein S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 32Broillet M.-C. Firestein S. Neuron. 1997; 18: 951-958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), did not reveal any effect on pH-dependent gating of Kir1.1 channels. The structural rearrangements that occur during pH gating in both N and C termini of Kir1.1 represent the first direct evidence for conformational changes in the Kir channel family. Work on GIRK channels (Kir3.0 subfamily) showed that protein domains in both N and C termini are involved in interaction with G-proteins (33Kubo Y. Iizuka M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 34Huang C.L. Slesinger P.A. Casey P.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

These domains mediate binding of Gβγ or Gαβγ to the Kir subunit. It is not yet known which parts of the molecule move during G-protein-induced channel gating. Gating induced by changes in extracellular pH (pK aaround 2.5) has recently been related to conformational changes in the two-segment type potassium channel from Streptomyces lividans (KscA, (36Schrempf H.

Using EPR spectroscopy, Perozo and co-workers uncovered structural rearrangements at the C-terminal end of the second transmembrane helix (37Perozo E. Cortes D. Cuello L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 38Cuello L. Romero J. Cortes D. Perozo E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3229-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) that were hypothesized to change the width of the inner vestibule and to thus control ion permeation. Whether such a mechanism also underlies gating in Kir1.1 channels with rearrangements in N and C termini as secondary processes or whether these cytoplasmic domains form the actual gate of the channel remains to be elucidated. Furthermore it remains to be elucidated whether the conformational changes resulting from pH-dependent gating may affect processes reported to affect channel activity such as phosphorylation by protein kinase A (39Xu Z.

Binding of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)1 to the extracellular α-subunits of the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) results in autophosphorylation of the cytoplasmic β-subunits (1White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Van Obberghen E. Diabetologia. 1994; 37 Suppl. 2: S125-S134Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This autophosphorylation of the IGF-IR initiates a cascade of cellular signal transduction pathways. One key event is the binding of insulin receptor substrates (IRS) 1 and 2 to phosphotyrosine residues on the receptor β-subunits (3Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). After binding by activated receptors, IRS-1 and -2 are tyrosine phosphorylated and act as docking proteins for downstream signaling molecules containing Src homology 2 domains, such as the 85-kDa regulatory (p85) subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) and the adapter protein Grb2 (reviewed in Refs. 3Myers Jr., M.G.

Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recent reports suggest IRS proteins play important and distinctive roles in IGF and insulin signaling. For example, IRS-1 is essential for IGF-I-stimulated mitogenesis (5Bruning J.C. Winnay J. Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1513-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).

In contrast, IRS-2 is more tightly linked to glucose regulation. Mice that are made IRS-2 deficient have the typical phenotype of type 2 diabetes (8Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J.

Another substrate for activated IGF-IR is Shc, which exists in three isoforms: p66, p52, and p46 (9Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T.

Shc is composed of a C terminus Src homology 2 domain, an N terminus phosphotyrosine binding domain, and a central collagen homologous domain (10Bonfini L. Migliaccio E. Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L.

Stimulation of p21ras leads to activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, which plays an important role in cellular differentiation and growth (19Davis R.J. J. Biol.

Activation of one of the MAP kinases, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), is required for IGF-I-mediated neurite outgrowth in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells (21Kim B. Leventhal P.S. Saltiel A.R. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21268-21273Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). There is continued controversy surrounding the relative importance of Shc compared with the IRS proteins in activation of the MAP kinase pathway. Sasaoka et al. (22Sasaoka T. Draznin B. Leitner J.W. Langlois W.J. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10734-10738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the majority of p21ras guanine nucleotide exchange activity was present in Shc immunoprecipitates, whereas only negligible amounts were found in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates. Studies with mutant insulin receptors show that insulin can mediate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, the association of Shc and Grb2, and p21ras-GTP formation, all without detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 or enhancement of the interaction between IRS-1 and Grb2 (23Ouwens D.M. van der Zon G.C.M.

Taken together, these studies suggest that the Shc-Grb2 complex is the key intermediate in downstream signaling of the MAP kinase pathway. In contrast, several reports implicate a central role for IRS proteins in MAP kinase signaling. SOS can be found in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates (17Baltensperger K. Kozma L.M. Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J. Chawla A. Banarjee U. Czech M.P.

Wands J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutated insulin receptors that tyrosine phosphorylate IRS-1 but not Shc have normal activation of p21ras (25Yonezawa K. Ando A. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R. Kitamura T. Hara K. Nakafuku M. Okabayashi Y. Kadowaki T. Kaziro Y. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4634-4640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These reports suggest that the relative roles of Shc and IRS proteins for mediating insulin and IGF-I signaling depend more on the nature of the signaling molecules and the individual cell types (26Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4427-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Unlike Shc, which seems to associate only with Grb2, IRS proteins can associate with a variety of other downstream signaling molecules, such as PI3K (3Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 4Waters S.B. Pessin J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Among them, PI3K is implicated in insulin- and IGF-I-mediated membrane ruffling. We have demonstrated that IGF-I induces membrane ruffling and growth cone extension in SH-SY5Y cells (27Leventhal P.S.

In parallel, the microinjection of a mutant p85 subunit of PI3K into cells inhibits IRS-1-PI3K association and insulin- and IGF-I-induced membrane ruffling (28Kotani K. Yonezawa K. Hara K. Ueda H.

In the current study, we examined the roles of Shc and IRS-2 in IGF-I signaling in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. IGF-I induced distinct temporal patterns of Shc and IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation. The transfection of a p52 Shc tyrosine mutant, p52 Shc Y239F/Y240F/Y317F, greatly reduced the IGF-I-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK and subsequent neurite outgrowth. In contrast, IRS-2-PI3K was required for IGF-I-mediated membrane ruffling. Finally, immunoreactive Grb2 and IRS-2 were localized to membrane ruffles, whereas Shc displayed a more ubiquitous staining. Our data suggest that the IGF-I-mediated association of Shc and Grb2 plays an important role in ERK activation and neurite outgrowth, whereas the IGF-I activation of the association of IRS-2 with PI3K is necessary for IGF-I-mediated membrane ruffling and growth cone extension. These studies imply distinct roles for Shc and IRS proteins, the two most prominent downstream mediators of IGF-IR signaling. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (PY20; Lexington, KY) and Upstate Biochemicals, Inc. (4G10; Lake Placid, NY).

MAP/ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059 was kindly provided by Dr. A. Saltiel of Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research (Ann Arbor, MI). IGF-I was a gift from Cephalon Corp. (West Chester, PA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose, l-glutamine, and sodium pyruvate was from Life Technologies, Inc. Other reagents were purchased from Sigma or Boehringer Mannheim. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 10% CO2. 18–24 h before the experiments, the media were replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum. For neurite outgrowth experiments, serum-starved cells were incubated in serum-free media for 24 h with or without IGF-I. Processes longer than the cell body were considered as neurites, as described previously (21Kim B. Leventhal P.S. Saltiel A.R. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21268-21273Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The p52 Shc tyrosine mutant construct p52 Shc Y239F/Y240F/Y317F, which has a Myc-tag, has been described previously (38Blaikie P.A. Fournier E. Dilworth S.N. Birnbaum D. Borg J.-P. Margolis B. J.

Randolph A.E. Feldman E.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4522-4529PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was prepared using a plasmid maxi kit from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). SH-SY5Y cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For stable transfection, cells were selected by growing in media containing 0.2 mg/ml G418. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (21Kim B. Leventhal P.S. Saltiel A.R. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21268-21273Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). All experiments were repeated at least twice, and typical representative results are shown in the figures. Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously (27Leventhal P.S. Shelden E.A.

Polyclonal antibodies against IRS-2, Grb2, or Shc and a monoclonal antibody against IGF-IR (α-IR3) were used to study the cellular distribution of these proteins. Actin filaments were stained by incubating fixed, permeabilized cells with 2 units/ml rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). We recently reported that in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, IGF-I induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins including IGF-IR, IRS-2, focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, and ERKs 1 and 2 (21Kim B. Leventhal P.S. Saltiel A.R. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21268-21273Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 27Leventhal P.S. Shelden E.A. Kim B. Feldman E.L. J. Biol.

In agreement with our previous studies (37Kim B. Leventhal P.S. White M.F. Feldman E.L. Endocrinology. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar), 10 nm IGF-I induced a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2, which was maintained for less than 30 min (Fig.1 A). Because it has been reported that Shc is another substrate for the IGF-IR and the insulin receptor (1White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of IGF-I on Shc tyrosine phosphorylation. When SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 10 nmIGF-I, anti-Shc antibody immunoprecipitated three tyrosine phosphorylated proteins ranging between 45 and 70 kDa (Fig.1 B). These correspond to the reported mobilities of three isoforms of Shc, p66, p52, and p46. Anti-Shc immunoblotting confirmed that these proteins were Shc (see Fig. 3 D). Tyrosine phosphorylation of p52 and p66 Shc was detected as early as 5 min after the addition of IGF-I and, unlike IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, was maintained for at least 2 h. p46 Shc showed constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation even in unstimulated cells, and IGF-I treatment had little effect on the level of tyrosine phosphorylation.Figure 3Transfection of the p52 Shc mutant inhibits IGF-I-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2, and the association of IRS-2 with PI3K and IRS-2 with Grb2. Vector- or p52 Shc mutant-transfected SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 10 nmIGF-I for 5 min. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-2 (A and B) or anti-Grb2 (C) antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine (A and C) or anti-p85pan(B) antibodies. Results are representative of at least two different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It has been reported that Grb2 can bind to both IRS-1 and Shc (14Skolnik E.Y. Lee C.-H. Batzer A. Vincentini L.M. Zhou M. Daly R. Myers Jr., M.G. Backer J.M. Ullrich A. White M.F. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1929-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). To study the association of Grb2 with IRS-2 and Shc, we immunoprecipitated cell lysates with anti-Grb2 antibody and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. In agreement with our previous results (37Kim B. Leventhal P.S. White M.F. Feldman E.L. Endocrinology. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar), we observe the transient association of Grb2 with IRS-2 (Fig.1 C). In the same anti-phosphotyrosine blot, we also detect all three Shc proteins, confirming the association of Grb2 with both Shc and IRS-2. Unlike the association of Grb2 with IRS-2, the Grb2-Shc association showed a prolonged time course similar to that of Shc tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1 C). We have reported that IGF-I induces sustained activation of ERK2 (21Kim B. Leventhal P.S. Saltiel A.R. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21268-21273Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The time course of ERK tyrosine phosphorylation more closely resembles the time course of the association of Shc with Grb2 than that of the IRS-2-Grb2 association. To examine whether prolonged tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc is an intrinsic characteristic of SH-SY5Y cells, we treated the cells with 100 nm EGF. In anti-Shc immunoprecipitates, we detect strong tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc proteins after EGF stimulation (Fig. 1 D). Unlike IGF-I stimulation, EGF-induced Shc tyrosine phosphorylation was transient, lasting less than 30 min. We also detect a transient EGF-mediated association between Shc and Grb2 (data not shown). In parallel with EGF-stimulated Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Shc-Grb2 association, EGF-stimulated ERK2 tyrosine phosphorylation was also transient (Fig. 1 E). EGF-stimulated ERK tyrosine phosphorylation was maximal at 5 min and rapidly decreased afterward. Unlike IGF-I (40Cooper M.J. Hutchins G.M. Cohen P.S. Helman L.J. Israel M.A. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1991; 366: 343-350PubMed Google Scholar), EGF did not mediate neurite outgrowth (data not shown). Collectively, these results suggest that IGF-I induces distinct temporal patterns of Shc and IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and their respective association with Grb2. Because the above results suggested the involvement of a Shc-Grb2 association in ERK tyrosine phosphorylation, we examined the role of Shc in the activation of the MAP kinase pathway. Recent reports have identified three major tyrosine residues important for Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Shc-Grb2 association (38Blaikie P.A. Fournier E. Dilworth S.N. Birnbaum D. Borg J.-P.

Sawa T. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9581-9586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We stably transfected the cells with a Myc-tagged p52 Shc construct that has mutations at the three critical tyrosine residues (p52 Shc Y239F/Y240F/Y317F). We detected an increased expression in whole cell lysates of Shc proteins after stable transfection (Fig.2 A). Efficient transfection was confirmed by immunoblotting anti-Shc immunoprecipitates with an anti-Myc antibody. The anti-Myc antibody detected the p52 band from the p52 Shc mutants but not from the cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 2 B). Next we examined the effects of IGF-I on Shc tyrosine phosphorylation in cells transfected with mutant p52 Shc or vector alone. IGF-I treatment of vector-transfected cells resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc proteins (Fig. 2 C). In agreement with a previous report (38Blaikie P.A. Fournier E. Dilworth S.N. Birnbaum D. Borg J.-P. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20671-20677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), transfection with mutant p52 Shc blocked the IGF-I-induced Shc tyrosine phosphorylation of SH-SY5Y cells (Fig.2 C). When the blot was stripped and reprobed with an anti-Shc antibody, the p66, p52, and p46 Shc bands were seen (Fig.2 D). In parallel with Shc tyrosine phosphorylation, IGF-I-mediated association of Shc with Grb2 was also markedly inhibited by transfection with the p52 Shc mutant (Fig. 2 E). These results show the efficient transfection of the p52 Shc mutant and suggest that Shc tyrosine phosphorylation is necessary for IGF-I-mediated Shc-Grb2 association. Because several studies have shown that there are distinct as well as overlapping domains of the IGF-IR and insulin receptor for Shc and IRS-1 binding (42Wolf G. Trüb T. Ottinger E. Groninga L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15639-15643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), we next examined the effects of the Shc mutant on IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation. As expected, treatment with IGF-I induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 in vector-transfected cells (Fig.3 A). Interestingly, transfection of the cells with the p52 Shc mutant reduced IGF-I-stimulated IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation by 40% (measured by densitometry; data not shown). These data suggest that an overexpression of Shc alters the normal binding of IRS-2 to IGF-IR, supporting the contention that these two proteins share IGF-IR binding domains. We have previously reported that IRS-2 transiently binds to Grb2 and the p85 subunit of PI3K after IGF-I stimulation (37Kim B. Leventhal P.S. White M.F. Feldman E.L. Endocrinology. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). In agreement with these results, the treatment of vector-transfected cells with IGF-I resulted in the association of IRS-2 with Grb2 and IRS-2 with p85 (Fig.3, B and C). In parallel with the observed decrease in IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, IGF-I treatment of the Shc mutant-transfected cells resulted in a decreased association of IRS-2 with p85 and Grb2. We have reported that IGF-I mediates ERK activation in SH-SY5Y cells (21Kim B. Leventhal P.S. Saltiel A.R. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21268-21273Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because the association of Shc with Grb2 can lead to activation of the MAP kinase pathway (14Skolnik E.Y. Lee C.-H. Batzer A.

First, we examined the effects of IGF-I treatment of the p52 Shc mutant-transfected cells by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of whole cell lysates. When vector-transfected cells were stimulated with 10 nm IGF-I, we detected prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of a 95-kDa protein (Fig.4 A) that we have confirmed as the IGF-IR (21Kim B. Leventhal P.S. Saltiel A.R. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21268-21273Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Transfection of the Shc mutant did not affect IGF-I-stimulated IGF-IR tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A). IGF-I also induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of an approximately 42-kDa protein in vector-transfected cells (Fig. 4 A). We have shown that this protein represents ERK2 (21Kim B. Leventhal P.S. Saltiel A.R. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21268-21273Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). When the cells were transfected with the p52 Shc mutant, IGF-I-stimulated ERK2 tyrosine phosphorylation was markedly inhibited. We confirmed the decrease in ERK2 activation by reprobing the blot with an antibody specific for activated MAP kinase (Fig. 4 B) and by observing a decrease in MAP kinase activity using the MAP kinase assay kit (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA; data not shown). Because we have previously demonstrated that ERK2 activation is re"

Deleterious mutations produce clinical hyperammonia that, if untreated, results in neurological symptoms or death (ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency). The holoenzyme is trimeric, and as in other transcarbamoylases, each subunit contains an N-terminal domain that binds carbamoyl phosphate and a C-terminal domain that binds l-ornithine. The active site is located in the cleft between domains and contains additional residues from an adjacent subunit. Binding ofN-phosphonacetyl-l-ornithine promotes domain closure. The resolution of the structure enables the role of active site residues in the catalytic mechanism to be critically examined. The side chain of Cys-303 is positioned so as to be able to interact with the δ-amino group of l-ornithine which attacks the carbonyl carbon of carbamoyl phosphate in the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. This sulfhydryl group forms a charge relay system with Asp-263 and the α-amino group of l-ornithine, instead of with His-302 and Glu-310, as previously proposed. In common with other ureotelic ornithine transcarbamoylases, the human enzyme lacks a loop of ∼20 residues between helix H10 and β-strand B10 which is present in prokaryotic ornithine transcarbamoylases but has a C-terminal extension of 10 residues that interacts with the body of the protein but is exposed.

However, all the OTCase structures available to date are of bacterial enzymes and at only moderate resolution. All have significant sequence differences from the human enzyme (Fig.1), and some function anabolically to synthesize arginine. To establish structure-function relationships for the human enzyme with certainty, its crystal structure is required.We report herein the structure of human OTCase complexed with the bisubstrate analog N-phosphonacetyl-l-ornithine (PALO) at 1.8-Å resolution, the highest resolution OTCase crystal structure reported to date. 215 bound solvent molecules, some of which form clusters at the active site, can be identified. The resolution of the structure enables the function of active site residues to be examined with precision and a model of the catalytic mechanism to be proposed.

However, all the OTCase structures available to date are of bacterial enzymes and at only moderate resolution. All have significant sequence differences from the human enzyme (Fig.1), and some function anabolically to synthesize arginine. To establish structure-function relationships for the human enzyme with certainty, its crystal structure is required. We report herein the structure of human OTCase complexed with the bisubstrate analog N-phosphonacetyl-l-ornithine (PALO) at 1.8-Å resolution, the highest resolution OTCase crystal structure reported to date. 215 bound solvent molecules, some of which form clusters at the active site, can be identified. The resolution of the structure enables the function of active site residues to be examined with precision and a model of the catalytic mechanism to be proposed. We compare this structure with those of other transcarbamoylases, discuss possible functions for its unique regions, and describe the structural basis of the clinical effects of some common and/or severe mutations that produce OTCD.

In photosynthetic bacteria, the products of three genes, bchI, bchD, andbchH, are required for magnesium chelatase activity. These genes from Rhodobacter capsulatus were cloned separately into expression plasmids pET3a and pET15b. The pET15b constructs produced NH2-terminally His6-tagged proteins. All proteins were highly expressed and were purified to near homogeneity. The BchI and BchH proteins were soluble. BchD proteins were insoluble, inactive inclusion bodies that were renatured by rapid dilution from 6 m urea. The presence of BchI in the solution into which the urea solution of BchD was diluted increased the yield of active BchD. A molar ratio of 1 BchI:1 BchD was sufficient for maximum renaturation of BchD. All of the proteins were active in the magnesium chelatase assay except His-tagged BchI, which was inactive and inhibited in incubations containing non-His-tagged BchI. Expressed BchH proteins contained tightly bound protoporphyrin IX, and they were susceptible to inactivation by light. Maximum magnesium chelatase activity per mol of BchD occurred at a stoichiometry of 4 BchI:1 BchD. The optimum reaction pH was 8.0.

Magnesium chelatase inserts Mg2+ into protoporphyrin IX in the chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll biosynthetic pathways. This enzyme is at the branch point of the (bacterio)chlorophyll and heme biosynthetic pathways and is believed to have a regulatory role in directing biosynthetic intermediates into the (bacterio)chlorophyll pathway (1Walker C.J. Willows R.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Transposon mutagenesis studies inRhodobacter capsulatus (2Bollivar D.W. Suzuki J.Y. Beatty J.T. Dobrowolski J.M. Bauer C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 622-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and Rhodobacter sphaeroides (3Gorchein A. Gibson L.C.D. Hunter C.N. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 201SCrossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) have shown that the products of three genes,bchI, bchD, and bchH, are required for this insertion. Genes that are homologous to bchI,bchD, and bchH have been reported in plants and photosynthetic bacteria. It has been suggested that the genes be namedbchI, bchD, and bchH when referring to organisms that accumulate bacteriochlorophyll and chlI,chlD, and chlH for the respective homologous genes in organisms that accumulate chlorophyll (1Walker C.J. Willows R.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This nomenclature will be used here. Expression of the three R. sphaeroides genes inEscherichia coli showed that all three gene products, plus ATP, Mg2+, and protoporphyrin IX, were required for magnesium chelatase activity (4Gibson L.C.

Gibson L.C.D. Kannangara C.G. Hunter C.N. von Wettstein D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) that was similar to that reported for the pea magnesium chelatase (6Walker C.J. Weinstein J.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, very low expression of the BchD protein limited further characterization of magnesium chelatase (5Willows R.D. Gibson L.C.D. Kannangara C.G. Hunter C.N. von Wettstein D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Heterologous expression of individual subunits and reconstitution of magnesium chelatase activity has recently been described for tobacco (7Papenbrock J. Gräfe S. Kruse E. Hänel F. Grimm B. Plant J. 1997; 12: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the cyanobacterium Synechocystissp. PCC 6803 (8Jensen P.E. Gibson L.C.D. Henningsen K.W. Hunter C.N. J. Biol.

Henningsen K.W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 699-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) However, characterization of the reaction using recombinant proteins has been limited due to low levels of expression and poor recovery of activity from these systems. We now report the cloning and high level expression of the magnesium chelatase genes from R. capsulatus, the purification of the gene products, and characterization of the reconstituted enzyme. Portions of this work were previously published in abstract form (10Willows R.D. Beale S.I. Plant Physiol. 1997; 111: S155Google Scholar). The plasmid pRPS404 (11Marrs B. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which contains a 44-kilobase pair region of the R. capsulatus photosynthetic gene cluster, was used as a PCR1 template throughout. A modified T-vector was constructed between theEcoRI and BamHI sites of pBluescript (KS) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) essentially as described in Ref. 12Kwak J.-H. Kim M.-Y. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 178-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, and this vector was used to subclone the bchID andbchD genes as described below. The oligonucleotides 5′-GGATCATCTTGCGGAAACTGT-3′ and 5′-ATGACTACCGCCGTCGCTCGACTTCAACCCTCTGCT-3′ were used to amplify thebchID region of the photosynthetic gene cluster by PCR usingTaq DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The 3-kilobase pair PCR product was then cloned directly into the T-vector, yielding plasmid pKSBchID. This cloning created an NdeI restriction site at the bchI translation start site. A region containing thebchI gene and the 5′ portion of bchD was then subcloned between the NdeI and BamHI sites of either pET3a (Novagen, Madison, WI) to create pBchI or pET15b (Novagen) to create pHisBchI. The oligonucleotides 5′-ATGGACCACGAACGCCTGAAGTCGGCCCTTG-3′ and 5′-ACCCTGCGTCGCGCCGCCGCCGACCGATAGG-3′ were used to amplify thebchD gene by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The 1.8-kilobase pair PCR product was cloned into the modified T-vector, yielding plasmid pKSBchD. This cloning created anNdeI restriction site at the bchD translation start site. This plasmid was digested with NdeI andXhoI, and the bchD fragment was subcloned between either the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET3a to create pBchD, or the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET15b to create pHisBchD. The oligonucleotides 5′-AGGCCCCATATGCACGATGAGTCGATGAGC-3′ and 5′-CCCTCCTTTTCGTAGTCGTAGATCTCATTC-3′ were used to amplifybchH by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase. These oligonucleotides introduced NdeI and BglII restriction sites. The PCR product was then either digested and cloned directly into pET3a to create pBchH or into the pCRBlunt (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) vector to create pCRBchH and then subcloned into pET15b to create pHisBchH. The magnesium chelatase genes in these plasmids were sequenced to check for errors using a Dye-Deoxy terminator kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with the Applied Biosystems model 377 sequencer. The first subclone of bchI, which was used to make the expression clones, was sequenced completely, and the finalbchI expression clones were sequenced in from the 5′-end to verify that they were in frame. The first bchD andbchH subclones were sequenced 600 base pairs in from each end, and the final bchD and bchH expression clones were sequenced in from the 5′-end to verify that they were in frame. No errors were detected. E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen) strains containing the expression plasmids were grown at 25 or 37 °C in 1 liter of LB medium (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol until the A 600 of the cultures was 0.8. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 4 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. For the expressed pET3a constructs, the cells from 1 liter of culture were resuspended in 20 ml of 50 mmTricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 15 mm MgCl2, and 4 mm DTT. The suspension was then frozen at –20 °C, thawed once, and then lysed completely by passage through a French pressure cell (SLM, Urbana, IL) at 20,000 p.s.i. For expression from pET15b constructs, the cells from 1 liter of culture were resuspended in 20 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm imidazole. This suspension was frozen at –20 °C, thawed once, and then lysed by passage through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. The BchH protein was purified essentially as described previously for the protein from R. sphaeroides (5Willows R.D. Gibson L.C.D. Kannangara C.G. Hunter C.N. von Wettstein D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The BchD protein was expressed as inclusion bodies, and these were purified as described in the pET system manual (Novagen). The inclusion bodies were then solubilized in 6 m urea, 50 mmTricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 15 mm MgCl2, and 4 mm DTT. The solubilized protein was loaded onto a RESOURCE Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) cation exchange chromatography column that was pre-equilibrated in the same buffer, and then the protein was eluted with this buffer containing a linear gradient of 0–1m NaCl, in 10 column volumes. The BchD protein eluted at 0.4 m NaCl. The BchI expression lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 ×g for 30 min, and then polyethylene glycol-8000 (molecular weight, 8000) was added to the soluble supernatant to a concentration of 10% (w/v). The mixture was placed on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g, the pellet was discarded, and polyethylene glycol-8000 was added to a final concentration of 25% (w/v). After standing for 2 h on ice, the solution was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was washed once with 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol-8000 and then redissolved in 50 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 15 mmMgCl2, and 4 mm DTT. The BchI protein was then purified by cation exchange chromatography as described above for BchD but without urea in the buffers. BchI eluted at 0.3 mNaCl. The HisBchH and HisBchI proteins were purified on a Ni2+-chelating column as described in the pET system manual, except that the eluted proteins were immediately desalted by Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) chromatography into 6% glycerol, 50 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 15 mmMgCl2, and 4 mm DTT. The HisBchD protein was expressed as inclusion bodies, and these were purified as described in the pET system manual (Novagen). The solubilized protein was then further purified on a Ni2+-chelating column under denaturing conditions in 6m urea as described in the pET system manual. After the protein was eluted, the buffer was changed to 6 m urea, 50 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 15 mmMgCl2, and 4 mm DTT. The assay mixture contained, in 50–1000 μl, the following: 50 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 15 mm MgCl2, 4 mm DTT, 4 mm ATP, 20 mm phosphocreatine, 20 units/ml of rabbit muscle creatine phosphokinase, 4 μm protoporphyrin IX, and various amounts of recombinant proteins as described in the figure and table legends. The assay mixtures were incubated for 30 or 60 min at 30 °C and stopped by the addition of 9 ml of acetone:H2O:32% (w/v) NH3 (80:20:1, v/v/v) per ml of incubation mixture and analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy with the excitation wavelength set at 418 nm and the emission wavelength set at 596 nm. The intensity of the emission at 596 nm of standard magnesium-protoporphyrin IX in the same solution was proportional to the concentration within the range of 1 nm to 1 μm. A standard curve was used to determine the amount of magnesium-protoporphyrin IX formed in the assay. Antiserum to HisBchD was raised in a New Zealand White rabbit using standard procedures (14Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The antiserum was cross-absorbed onto an E. colilysate column (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblots were made using standard methods (14Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) with a 1/5000 dilution of antiserum and detection by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and a chemiluminescent substrate. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was done according to the procedure of Fling and Gregerson (15Fling S.P. Gregerson D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) and gels were stained with colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue (16Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2337) Google Scholar). R. capsulatus strains ZY6 and DB350 (2Bollivar D.W. Suzuki J.Y. Beatty J.T. Dobrowolski J.M. Bauer C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 622-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 17Yang Z. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5001-5010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were a gift from C. E. Bauer and D. Bollivar. They were grown in RCV+ medium in the dark at 25 °C as described by Bollivar et al. (2Bollivar D.W. Suzuki J.Y. Beatty J.T. Dobrowolski J.M. Bauer C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 622-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Protoporphyrin IX and magnesium-protoporphyrin IX were purchased from Porphyrin Products, Inc. (Logan, UT). Except where indicated otherwise, all other chemicals were from Fisher, Sigma, or Research Organics (Cleveland, OH). The individual magnesium chelatase recombinant subunits were purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” With the exception of non-His-tagged BchH, they were homogeneous as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). BchH and HisBchH were expressed in soluble form with protoporphyrin IX noncovalently bound, as was found for the R. sphaeroidesBchH protein expressed in E. coli (5Willows R.D. Gibson L.C.D. Kannangara C.G. Hunter C.N. von Wettstein D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The absorption peaks attributed to protoporphyrin IX are visible in the absorption spectrum of purified HisBchH (Fig. 2 A). The fluorescence excitation spectrum (Fig. 2 B) shows a pronounced peak at 280 nm that is not present in the spectrum of free protoporphyrin IX, indicating that one or more protein tryptophan residues are in close proximity to the protoporphyrin IX and can transfer excitation energy to the pigment. The bound protoporphyrin IX caused BchH to become very susceptible to inactivation by light. Under normal laboratory lighting, it was inactivated in 10 min at 0 °C (data not shown). To prevent this light inactivation, all of the BchH expression and purification steps were performed in the dark or under a dim green safelight. In addition, all magnesium chelatase assays were done in the dark. BchD and HisBchD were both expressed as inclusion bodies. As described below, these proteins, after solubilization with urea, reconstituted magnesium chelatase when added to assay buffer containing BchH and BchI. In vitro magnesium chelatase activity was reconstituted only upon the addition of all three expressed proteins, BchI, BchH (or HisBchH), and BchD (or HisBchD) to the incubation mixture (Fig.3). Some product was formed in incubations without added protoporphyrin IX, because the protoporphyrin IX that is bound to purified BchH can be used as substrate. Although both BchI and HisBchI were highly expressed in soluble form, only non-His-tagged BchI was active in the magnesium chelatase assay. HisBchI was inactive, and it inhibited the reaction in incubations containing BchI (Fig. 4). For reconstitution of activity, BchD (or HisBchD), solubilized in 6m urea, was added directly to the assay mixture containing the other two protein components. BchD, therefore, refolded to an active form in the reaction mixture during the incubation, as was recently reported for C. vibrioforme BchD (9Petersen B.L. Jensen P.E. Gibson L.C.D. Stummann B.M. Hunter C.N. Henningsen K.W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 699-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although this method of assaying magnesium chelatase was useful for reconstitution experiments, it was unsatisfactory for enzyme kinetic studies because the proportion of BchD that is in the active form in the assay mixture could not be controlled. The factors that mediate renaturation of BchD were therefore examined as described below. Renatured BchD (or HisBchD) provided a consistent preparation for further study of the magnesium chelatase reaction. Efficient in vitro renaturation of BchD required DTT and ATP (Table I). Moreover, the degree of renaturation was increased by the presence of BchI. A time course of the renaturation of BchD at 0 °C with BchI, ATP, and MgCl2 indicated that BchD was maximally renatured at 90 min (data not shown). The concentration of BchD in the medium did not appear to have an effect on the renaturation efficiency, because approximately equal specific activity was obtained with the three concentrations tested (Table I). The slightly lower activity at higher BchD concentrations was caused by the higher concentrations of urea in the assay medium, which ranged from 30 to 120 mm in this experiment. A BchI:BchD molar ratio of 1:1 was sufficient for maximal recovery of active BchD (Table II). Neither further stimulation or inhibition of the renaturation was observed at higher BchI:BchD ratios. In the R. capsulatuschromosome, bchI is 5′ to bchD and is part of the same transcription unit. This implies that BchI is translated before BchD, and it is proposed that its presence may aid in the folding of BchD to its active form in vivo.Table IRequirements for BchD renaturationRenaturation mediumMg chelatase assay mediumMg chelatase activityaActivity values listed are means and standard deviations of duplicate (Experiments 1–3) or triplicate (Experiment 4) assays.BchIBchDBchI:BchDμgμgmol:molpmol μg−1 BchD% maximumExperiment 1Complete11.811.21.711.57 ± 0.35100+5 μm protoporphyrin IX11.811.21.712.14 ± 0.47105−BchI11.811.21.74.41 ± 0.5338Experiment 2Complete6.22.54.013.80 ± 0.50100−ARS6.22.54.016.50 ± 0.25120−ATP, −ARS6.22.54.02.80 ± 0.1520−ATP, −ARS, −MgCl26.22.54.02.40 ± 0.3017Experiment 3Complete23.622.41.710.60 ± 0.80100−ARS23.622.41.78.45 ± 0.4480−ATP, −ARS23.622.41.72.22 ± 0.3721−DTT23.622.41.70.76 ± 0.127Experiment 4Complete13.65.54.015.30 ± 1.20100Complete28.111.44.014.05 ± 1.2092Complete56.322.84.013.75 ± 1.8090BchD protein was solubilized in 6 m urea, 10 mmTricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, and 2 mm DTT and then renatured by rapid dilution into 20 volumes of renaturation medium and maintained at 0 °C for 60 min.

All assays (100 μl) contained renaturation medium and 4 μm protoporphyrin IX, 11.2 μg of BchD, 33 μg of HisBchH protein, and additional BchI protein to bring the final amount to 42 μg. Assay mixtures were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C. Because BchD was solubilized in 6 m urea and added to assay medium by dilution from the urea solution, it was important to determine the effect of urea on the magnesium chelatase reaction. The reaction was progressively inhibited at increasing urea concentrations, with approximately 20% inhibition at 100 mm, 50% inhibition at 250 mm, and 90% inhibition at 800 mm (Fig. 5). Because the final urea concentration in the magnesium chelatase assays was usually 30–60 mm, its presence in the assay medium had only a minor effect on activity. R. capsulatus mutants ZY6 and DB350 contain insertional disruptions of the bchH and bchIgenes, respectively (2Bollivar D.W. Suzuki J.Y. Beatty J.T. Dobrowolski J.M. Bauer C.E. J. Mol.

Magnesium chelatase activity was absent in extract of either mutant alone, but was present in a mixture of the extracts from the two mutants (TableIII). Activity was reconstituted in extract of ZY6 cells supplemented with recombinant BchH. Neither BchD, BchI, nor a combination of BchD and BchI reconstituted activity of ZY6 extract. Fractionated ZY6 extract from which BchD was removed by high speed centrifugation and ion exchange chromatography required addition of both BchH and BchD to restore activity. Similarly, ZY6 extract from which BchI was partially removed by high speed centrifugation required addition of both BchH and BchI to restore full activity.Table IIIIn vitro complementation of R. capsulatus magnesium chelatase mutantsCell extract(s) addedRecombinant protein(s) addedRelative Mg-protoporphyrin IX formationZY6DB350BchHBchDBchIμgμgμg%Experiment 10030.01.86.010025000.00.00.0003300.00.00.00250030.00.00.018025000.01.80.0025000.00.06.0025000.01.86.0040 (I) + 20 (D)030.00.00.016040 (I)030.00.00.0040 (I)030.01.80.05020 (D)030.00.00.0520 (D)030.00.06.0500Experiment 20010.01.85.21002503300.00.00.050033010.00.00.0003300.01.80.0003300.00.05.2003300.01.85.250Strains ZY6 (bchH −) and DB350 (bchI −) were grown and extracted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Extract of strain ZY6 (3 ml) was centrifuged for 1 h at 190,000 × g, and the glassy pellet was washed once with extraction buffer and resuspended in 0.5 ml of the same buffer to yield the BchD-containing fraction ZY6 (D) (31Kannangara C.G.

Because the various proteins added to the incubation mixture were of different degrees of purification, the tabulated relative product formation values have not been normalized to protein concentration. Magnesium chelatase activity was not restored to extract of strain DB350 by the addition of any single recombinant protein, but activity was partially restored by the addition of both BchD and BchI. The requirement for both proteins is consistent with the absence of the BchD in extracts of strain DB350 (Fig.6). These results suggest that BchI is needed to stabilize BchD in vivo and are consistent with the ability of BchI to enhance the renaturation of urea-denatured BchDin vitro. The pH optimum for magnesium chelatase was approximately 8.0 (Fig.7). Activity dropped to near zero below pH 6 and above pH 10.5. The time course for product accumulation exhibited a small lag phase, followed by approximately constant activity for about 100 min, and lower activity at later times (Fig.8). Preincubation of BchD and BchI in assay mixture for 10 min at 30 °C before starting the reaction by the addition of BchH increased the initial reaction rate but did not eliminate the lag phase.Figure 8Reaction time course.

K., Cui, W., and Michels, C. A. (1996) J. Bacteriol. 178, 2245–2254). Here we report on the role of ubiquitin conjugation in this process. Deletion of DOA4, which causes decreased levels of available ubiquitin, severely decreases the rate of glucose-induced proteolysis, and this is suppressed by the overproduction of ubiquitin. Overexpression of ubiquitin in an endocytosis-deficient end3-ts strain results in the glucose-stimulated accumulation of a larger molecular weight species of maltose permease, which we demonstrate is a ubiquitin-modified form of the protein by utilizing two ubiquitin alleles with different molecular weights. The size of this ubiquitinated species of maltose permease is consistent with monoubiquitination. A promoter mutation that reduces expression ofRSP5/NPI1, a postulated ubiquitin-protein ligase, dramatically reduces the rate of glucose-induced proteolysis of maltose permease. The role of various ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes was investigated using strains carrying mutant alleles ubc1Δubc4Δ, ubc4Δ ubc5Δ,cdc34-ts2/ubc3, and ubc9-ts. Loss of these functions was not shown to effect glucose-induced proteolysis of maltose permease, but loss of Ubc1, -4, and -5 was found to inhibit maltose permease expression at the post-transcriptional level. In Saccharomyces, the addition of glucose induces a rapid degradation of maltose permease that is dependent on endocytosis and vacuolar proteolysis (Medintz, I., Jiang, H., Han, E. K., Cui, W., and Michels, C. A. (1996) J. Bacteriol. 178, 2245–2254). Here we report on the role of ubiquitin conjugation in this process.

Glucose regulates maltose transport in Saccharomyces at several levels. It blocks transcription of the maltose permease gene by multiple mechanisms cumulatively referred to as glucose repression (2Hu Z. Nehlin J.O. Ronne H. Michels C.A. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and it inactivates maltose permease by a process referred to as glucose-induced inactivation or catabolite inactivation (1Medintz I. Jiang H. Han E.K. Cui W. Michels C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lucero P. Lagunas L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 147: 273-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these processes allow for the rapid shift from maltose to glucose fermentation. Previously, we showed that glucose-induced inactivation of maltose permease consists of two apparently independent processes: the proteolysis of maltose permease protein and the rapid inhibition of maltose transport activity, which occurs even faster than can be explained by loss of the protein alone (1Medintz I. Jiang H. Han E.K. Cui W. Michels C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular genetic analysis using mutations in END3, REN1/VPS2,PEP4, and PRE1 and PRE2 demonstrated that the proteolysis of maltose permease is dependent on endocytosis, vesicle sorting, and vacuolar proteolysis and is independent of the proteasome. Studies of a variety of different nutrient transporters suggest that the inactivation and/or degradation of permeases is a generalized mechanism used to respond to changes in nutrient availability from less desirable nutrient sources or starvation conditions to preferred nutrients and rich medium. The general amino acid permease Gap1 protein is inactivated by the addition of ammonium ions to yeast cells growing on proline as the sole nitrogen source (5Stanbrough M. Magasanik B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 94-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Andre B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Inactivation occurs as a 2-fold process with enzymatic inactivation by phosphorylation preceding degradation of the permease (5Stanbrough M. Magasanik B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 94-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Andre B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The high affinity Pho84 phosphate transporter undergoes rapid degradation once the supply of phosphate and/or carbon source is exhausted (7Martinez P. Zvyagilakaya R. Allard P. Persson B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2253-2256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Uracil permease (Fur4p) is phosphorylated on serine residues at the plasma membrane and is rapidly degraded under adverse growth conditions (8Galan J.M. Moreau V. Andre B. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10946-10952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). A common feature of the degradation of the maltose, galactose, uracil, and general amino acid permeases is that all are mediated by endocytosis and subsequent transport to the vacuole, the site of degradation. Ubiquitination has been implicated as the mechanism marking these proteins and several others for rapid endocytosis and selective degradation (4Horak J. Wolf D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1541-1549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Andre B. Mol.

We report here that ubiquitination of the maltose permease occurs in response to glucose and explore the cellular components involved in this process. Ubiquitination of Saccharomyces Ste2 protein, α-factor receptor, is required for its ligand-stimulated endocytosis and vacuolar proteolysis (10Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). END4 mutations inhibit endocytosis of α-factor and stimulate the appearance of multiubiquitinated species. A sequence in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Ste2p, SINNDAKSS (12Rohrer H. Benedetti H. Zanolari B. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), is sufficient to stimulate endocytosis, but mutation of the Lys in this target sequence to Arg inhibits ligand-stimulated ubiquitination and degradation. These results clearly implicate ubiquitination in receptor targeting to endocytosis. Ubiquitination also is required for endocytosis of yeast uracil permease (8Galan J.M. Moreau V. Andre B. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10946-10952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and probably the galactose transporter, Gal2p (4Horak J. Wolf D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1541-1549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies also have implicated ubiquitination as a signal for the endocytosis and vacuolar degradation of other plasma membrane proteins including mammalian peptide hormone receptors (reviewed in Ref. 13Hicke L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The yeast ABC transporter Ste6 accumulates in a ubiquitinated form in the plasma membrane of strains that are deficient in endocytosis (11Kolling R. Hollenberg C.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3261-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In strains that have normal endocytotic functions, this protein is generally found associated with internal membranes. Another protein from this same family of yeast transporters, the multidrug transporter Pdr5, also is ubiquitinated prior to endocytosis and degradation in the vacuole, suggesting that ubiquitination may trigger the endocytosis of this short lived protein (14Egner R. Kuchler K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Similar results have been reported for the human fibroblast growth factor receptor (15Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Govers R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Moreover, many other plasma membrane receptor proteins are found as ubiquitin conjugates including the lymphocyte homing receptor, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, the c-Kit receptor, and the mammalian immunoglobulin E receptor (16Siegelman M. Bond M.W. Gallatin W.M. St. John T. Smith H.T. Fried V.A. Weissman I.L. Science. 1986; 231: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 17Mori S. Heldin C.H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol.

In this study, we used molecular genetic analysis to explore the role of ubiquitin in the glucose-induced inactivation of the maltose permease. Our results indicate that loss of free ubiquitin, via aDOA4 null mutation, impairs the glucose-induced proteolysis of maltose permease and that the effects of the doa4Δ null mutation can be suppressed by the overexpression of ubiquitin. We demonstrate that the maltose permease exists as a ubiquitinated species and that the amount of this ubiquitinated species increases dramatically upon the addition of glucose to maltose fermenting cells. Rsp5/Npi1 ubiquitin-protein ligase is implicated in the proteolysis of maltose permease. Mutations in UBC1, UBC4, andUBC5 encoding ubiquitin conjugation enzymes UBC (ubiquitin carrier proteins; E21enzymes), in combination were found to dramatically decrease the level of maltose permease expressed, apparently by affecting a post-transcriptional process but not glucose-induced proteolysis. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study and their relevant genotypes are listed in Table I. Plasmid pDOA4–8 carries the wild-type allele of DOA4. Plasmid YEp96 (pCUP1-Ub) contains UBI4 encoding ubiquitin expressed from the copper-inducible CUP1 promoter, and YEp105 (pCUP1-mycUb) contains a c-myc-tagged ubiquitin allele also expressed from the CUP1 promoter (20Ecker D.J.

Plasmids pUN90-MAL63, pUN30-MAL63, and YCP50-MAL63 all carry the MAL63 MAL- activator gene, required in many strains for maltose-induced expression of the MAL structural genes. Plasmid pADH1-MAL61 expressing the MAL61/HA gene from the constitutive ADH1 promoter was constructed as follows. Usingin vitro mutagenesis, an XhoI site was introduced into pUN30-MAL61/HA 12 base pairs upstream of the start codon of the permease gene MAL61/HA. The promoter sequence of this gene was removed by digestion withXhoI and SacI and replaced with the 400-base pairADH1 promoter, amplified from plasmid pGAD424 (CLONTECH Inc., Palo Alto, CA) by polymerase chain reaction.

Southern analysis using MAL61-specific probes revealed the presence two maltose permease genes, one at the MAL1 locus (MAL61/HA, derived from CMY1001) and a second (MAL31, derived from PMY270) mapping to the partially functional MAL3 locus encoding MAL31 (maltose permease) and MAL32 (maltase) (25Charron M.J. Dubin R.A. Michels C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3891-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The standard inactivation assay protocol was used as described previously (1Medintz I. Jiang H. Han E.K. Cui W. Michels C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, cells were grown at 30 °C to early log phase (A 6000.1–0.3) in YP (rich) or SM (selection) medium containing 2% maltose, harvested by filtration with cellulose filters, and resuspended in nitrogen starvation medium (1.74 g/liter of yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate) plus 2% (w/v) carbon source, usually glucose. At selected time intervals, cells were harvested by filtration for Western analysis and maltose transport assays. All values depicted in this study are the average of at least two experiments and were carried out in duplicate. Variation was less than 15%. Growth dilution was calculated as the A 600 at time 0 divided by the A 600 at time x. Maltose transport was measured by the uptake of 1 mm[14C]maltose as described previously (1Medintz I. Jiang H.

The intensity of the signal was quantitated by scanning films with a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer, and relative Mal61/HA protein levels were determined by comparison of the area under the curve. Western blots were done in duplicate on all samples for duplicate experimental cultures, and densitometer quantitation of the relative protein levels was carried out twice for each sample lane (1Medintz I. Jiang H. Han E.K. Cui W. Michels C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast DOA4 gene encodes a ubiquitin hydrolase enzyme that functions late in the proteasomal degradation pathway by cleaving and recycling ubiquitin from substrate remnants still bound to protease (24Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 88: 4604-4610Google Scholar). Although Doa4p is only one of several species of ubiquitin hydrolase enzymes found inSaccharomyces, loss of the DOA4 gene product significantly decreases the rate of ubiquitin recycling and severely decreases levels of available ubiquitin. We used a doa4Δnull mutant strain to explore the dependence on ubiquitin of glucose-induced proteolyis of maltose permease. Glucose-induced inactivation of maltose permease was characterized in the doa4Δ null strain, CMY1025, and as a control in strain CMY1025 carrying the wild-type DOA4 gene on a CENplasmid. As is evident from Fig. 1(top two panels), the doa4mutant strain exhibits a dramatically decreased rate of glucose-induced proteolysis of Mal61/HA permease, to the extent that the loss of maltose permease protein parallels the growth of the culture (growth dilution). In comparison, in the DOA4 strain, maltose permease protein is degraded more rapidly than can be expected from growth alone. Table II indicates that the steady state rate of maltose transport in the doa4Δ strain is slightly higher (37%) than that of a strain expressing the wild-type DOA4 gene, which is consistent with the decrease in maltose permease turnover. Interestingly, despite the apparent lack of glucose-induced proteolysis of maltose permease in thedoa4Δ strain, glucose stimulates a decrease in maltose transport activity, indicating that the inhibition of transport activity occurs by a process that is independent of ubiquitin availability.Table IIMaltose transport rates of doa4 and rsp5/npi1 mutant strainsStrainRelevant genotypeTransport ratenmol/mg (dry wt)/minCMY1025 (pCUP1-vector)doa4Δ::LEU21.57aDetermined following a 4-h incubation in 0.1 mm copper sulfate.CMY1025 (pCUP1-Ub)doa4Δ::LEU20.80aDetermined following a 4-h incubation in 0.1 mm copper sulfate.CMY1025 (pUN70)doa4Δ::LEU21.72CMY1025 (pDOA4–8)doa4Δ::LEU21.2623346c (pRS416MAL61/HA)RSP5/NPI13.0327038a (pRS416MAL61/HA)rsp5/npil3.62All strains were grown in rich medium with 2% maltose to early log phase at 30 °C.

All determinations are from two separate cultures, each assayed in duplicate. Variation is less than 15%. In order to test the possibility that the ubiquitin deficiency in thedoa4Δ strain is responsible for the decreased rate of glucose-induced proteolysis of maltose permease, we determined whether overexpression of ubiquitin could overcome the loss of active ubiquitin recycling. Plasmid yEP96 (pCUP1-Ub), carrying the ubiquitin geneUBI4 fused to the copper-responsive promoter fromCUP1, was introduced into the doa4Δ mutant strain CMY1025 (20Ecker D.J. Khan M.I. Marsh J. Butt T.R. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3524-3527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard inactivation assay was carried out, except 0.1 mm copper sulfate was added to the culture medium 4 h prior to the transfer to glucose and the initiation of the inactivation assay (29Ward A.C. Castelli L.A. MaCreadie I.G. Azad A. Yeast. 1994; 10: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 1(bottom two panels), overexpression of ubiquitin in the doa4Δ (pCUP1-Ub) strain suppresses the loss of DOA4, restoring a more rapid rate of glucose-induced proteolysis of maltose permease than that observed in thedoa4Δ (pCUP1-vector) control strain. Table II shows that the steady state transport rate of maltose in a ubiquitin-overexpressing doa4Δ strain, CMY1025 (pCUP1-Ub), is half that seen in the control strain, CMY1025 (pCUP1-vector). This is also consistent with the proposal that ubiquitin is required for rapid turnover of maltose permease. In order to determine whether maltose permease is ubiquitinated directly, we used strain CMY1004, which contains a temperature-sensitive allele of END3 to slow down endocytosis and degradation of maltose permease and thereby enhance the levels of any putative ubiquitinated species (1Medintz I. Jiang H. Han E.K. Cui W. Michels C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). END3 is an early function in the endocytosis process (30Raths S. Rohrer J. Crausaz F. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). We have shown that endocytosis and the subsequent proteolysis of Mal61/HA maltose permease are completely inhibited at the nonpermissive temperature, in end3-ts strains, and that, even at the permissive temperature, maltose permease protein accumulates to higher levels in the plasma membrane (1Medintz I. Jiang H. Han E.K. Cui W. Michels C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pCUP1-mycUb (yEP105), which encodes a c-myc-tagged allele of ubiquitin, was introduced into strain CMY1004. Strain CMY1004 (pCUP1-mycUb) was grown to very early log phase (A 600 0.2–0.3) in selective media plus 2% maltose at room temperature, and 0.1 mm CuSO4was added to induce expression of c-myc-Ub (29Ward A.C. Castelli L.A. MaCreadie I.G. Azad A. Yeast. 1994; 10: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After a 5-h ubiquitin induction period, the culture was transferred to 37 °C to inhibit endocytosis, and then after an additional 1 h glucose was added to a final concentration of 2%. Samples were collected at time points throughout this process, and the level of Mal61/HA protein was determined by Western blotting. Published reports indicate that substrate proteins that are conjugated with a c-myc-tagged allele of ubiquitin are more stable than untagged ubiquitin-substrate protein conjugates and accumulate to a significantly higher level (21Hochstrasser M. Ellison M.J. Chau V. Varshvsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4604-4610Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). As is evident in Fig. 2, overexpression of ubiquitin during the Cu2+ induction period results in the accumulation of a larger molecular weight species of Mal61/HA protein in the end3 strain even prior to the addition of glucose. Thus, it appears that a small amount of a putative ubiquitinated species of maltose permease is present during growth on maltose. The addition of the 2% glucose to the growth medium causes an increase in the abundance of this larger molecular weight band, which peaks at about 30–45 min. In order to confirm that this higher molecular weight species is indeed a ubiquitinated maltose permease, we utilized the modest molecular weight difference produced by conjugation to c-myc-tagged ubiquitin versus untagged ubiquitin. The difference in size between the product encoded by these two alleles, approximately 1.3–1.5 kDa, previously has been used to verify ubiquitinated substrates such as the Matα2 transcriptional regulator (8Galan J.M.

Chau V. Varshvsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4604-4610Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Strain CMY1004 (pCUP1-mycUb) expressing the Cu2+-inducible c-myc-tagged ubiquitin and strain CMY1004 (pCUP1-Ub) expressing the Cu2+-inducible untagged ubiquitin were both grown at room temperature to early log phase, and 0.1 mmCuSO4 was added to the growth media. After 4 h, the cultures were moved to 37 °C for 1 h prior to the addition of 2% glucose. After the glucose was added, cells were allowed to continue growing at 37 °C for ½ h and then harvested for Western analysis of Mal61/HAp. As is seen in Fig. 3, both strains carrying the different alleles of ubiquitin exhibit the higher molecular weight species of Mal61/HA protein described above, but in the strain carrying the c-myc-tagged allele of ubiquitin, this species is slightly larger than the corresponding species in the strain carrying the untagged allele of ubiquitin. The c-myc-tagged ubiquitin-maltose permease conjugate also appears to be significantly more abundant than the corresponding untagged species, consistent with reports that the c-mycubiquitin-conjugated proteins are more stable (21Hochstrasser M. Ellison M.J. Chau V. Varshvsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4604-4610Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). These results confirm that this higher molecular weight species is indeed a ubiquitinated maltose permease. The size of this ubiquitinated species of maltose permease is increased by approximately 6–7 kDa, compared with the major species of Mal61/HAp, and is consistent with a monoubiquitinated maltose permease. RSP5/NPI1 encodes a ubiquitin-protein ligase that participates in the induced degradation of at least two permeases: the general amino acid permease, encoded by GAP1, and the uracil permease, encoded by FUR4 (6Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Andre B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Anrsp5/npi1 mutant allele was isolated based on its nitrogen repression-resistant phenotype (31Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and has since been shown to be a Ty1 insertion into the RSP5 promoter (6Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R.

https://openalex.org/W1995491015,"Based on both in vivo and in vitro studies, we have shown previously that the intracellular domain of a membrane-bound isoform of the growth factor, neuregulin, regulates proteolytic release of its extracellular domain ErbB receptor-activating ligand. To investigate the mechanism(s) involved in this regulation, a series of intracellular domain mutants were constructed and tested for susceptibility to proteolytic processing after transient transfection in COS-7 cells. These studies revealed that regulation of extracellular domain cleavage by the intracellular domain is sequence-specific and involves three distinct 30–60-residue segments. The presence of any two of these three segments is both necessary and sufficient for proteolytic processing, and resistance to proteolysis is not due to an alteration in cellular localization or transport. Evidence was also obtained that regulation of extracellular domain processing involves initial intracellular domain dimerization. Thus, with expression of a construct encoding only the intracellular domain, dimerization could be demonstrated in cross-linking experiments. Furthermore, resistance to proteolytic processing of a construct lacking a large portion of the intracellular domain was rescued with a chimera, in which the intracellular domain was replaced with a spontaneously dimerizing Fc fragment. Taken together these studies indicate that intracellular domain interactions are critically involved in the spacial and temporal control of growth and development by membrane-bound neuregulin isoforms.

Four members of the ErbB superfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases (also called HER) have been characterized extensively. erbB-1 (receptor for epidermal growth factor or EGFR)1 binds several distinct ligands containing an EGF-like domain and mediates proliferation and differentiation of normal cells (1Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W. Lee J. Yarden Y. Libermann T.A. Schlessinger J. Downward J. Mayes E.L.V. Whittle N. Waterfield M.D. Seeberg P.H. Nature. 1984; 309: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar). The second member, ErbB-2, initially characterized as the protooncogene, neu, encodes a 185-kDa protein. This protooncogene is frequently overexpressed in various carcinomas and is associated with a poor prognosis (2Yamamoto T. Ikawa S. Akiyama T. Semba K. Nomura N. Miyajima N. Saito T. Toyoshima K. Nature. 1986; 319: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). The other two members, ErbB-3 and ErbB-4, have been cloned subsequently and identified based on consensus protein-tyrosine kinase domains and homology with the other ErbB members (3Kraus M.H.

Neuregulins (NRGs) isolated from ras-transformed mouse fibroblasts and human breast cancer cells, originally called neu differentiation factor (NDF) or heregulin, were initially identified as putative ErbB receptor ligands based on their ability to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2 (5Wen D.

One is acetylcholine receptor-inducing activity from chicken brain, which induces the synthesis of acetylcholine receptors in skeletal muscle (7Falls D.L. Rosen K.M. Corfas G. Lane W.S. Fischbach G.D. Cell. 1993; 72: 801-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The other is glial growth factor from the bovine brain, which stimulates Schwann cell growth (8Marchionni M.A. Goodearl A.D. Chen M.S. Bermingham-McDonogh O. Kirk C. Hendricks M. Danehy F. Misumi D.

Despite their varied functions, all these homologues are derived from a single gene by alternate splicing or by use of several cell type-specific transcription initiation sites, and all contain an EGF-like domain required for receptor activation (8Marchionni M.A. Goodearl A.D. Chen M.S. Bermingham-McDonogh O. Kirk C. Hendricks M. Danehy F. Misumi D. Sudhalter J. Kobayashi K. Wroblewski D. Lynch C. Baldassare M. Hiles I. Davis J.B. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Otsu M.

Gene inactivation experiments have demonstrated that neuregulins are essential for early heart and central nervous system development. Inactivation of both neuregulin alleles results in embryonic lethality due to maldevelopment of the heart. In these animals, the cardiac trabeculae fail to form normally, and there is a severe defect in endocardial cushion development. In addition, neuregulin null mice display defects of the nervous system including abnormal development of both Schwann cell precursors and cranial ganglia (16Meyer D. Birchmeier C. Nature. 1995; 378: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 17Kramer R. Bucay N. Kane D.J. Martin L.E. Tarpley J.E. Theill L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4833-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The varied biological functions mediated by neuregulins are likely related to differential tissue expression and structural diversity. At least 15 distinct isoforms are expressed in different tissues (18Ben-Baruch N. Yarden Y. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1994; 206: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). They can be classified into two major groups based on their domain structures. One group is comprised of proteins that have an N-terminal signal peptide, but lack transmembrane and intracellular domains. Thus, these isoforms, which are largely expressed only in neural cells, are packaged presumably and subject to regulated release. The other group, expressed in both neural and mesenchymal cells, are membrane-associated. In addition to an extracellular segment (consisting of an Ig-like domain, a glycosylated region, and an EGF-like domain), these isoforms contain a transmembrane and intracellular domain. The extracellular domain of the membrane-associated forms can be proteolytically cleaved to release their ErbB receptor-activating functional peptide (5Wen D. Peles E. Cupples R. Suggs S.V. Bacus S.S. Luo Y. Trail G. Hu S. Silbiger S.M. Levy R.B. Kiski R.A. Lu Hsieng S.L. Yarden Y. Cell. 1992; 69: 559-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Although some NRG isoforms, such as NDF-β4a, are more localized in the plasma membrane, others, such as NDF-α2c, show minimal plasma membrane localization. Both of these are processed predominantly in intracellular organelles (19Burgess T.L. Ross S.L. Qian Y. Brankow D. Hu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19188-19196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase labeling studies indicate that processing occurs within 30 min of translation. Since the cleavage process is regulated in cultured cells by phorbol esters, cleavage may require a signaling event (19Burgess T.L. Ross S.L. Qian Y. Brankow D. Hu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19188-19196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been suggested that the efficiency of proteolytic cleavage is directly proportional to the length of the intracellular domain (20Wen D. Suggs S.V. Karunagaran D. Liu N. Cupples R.L. Luo Y. Janssen A.M. Ben-Baruch N. Trollinger D.B. Jacobsen V.L. Meng S.Y. Lu H.S. Hu S. Chang D. Yang W. Yanigahara D. Koski R.A. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1909-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), which varies among the different isoforms. Membrane-bound NRG isoforms are expressed in mesenchymal cells that are in juxtaposition to cells expressing ErbB receptors (21Marchionni M.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 334-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For example, in the early stage of the developing heart, the membrane-bound forms are expressed in the endocardial lining, whereas their cognate receptors are expressed in cardiac myocytes and in cells forming the endocardial cushion. This suggests that neuregulins function in a paracrine fashion during the early stages of heart development. We have found recently, in both in vivo and in vitro studies, that the NRG intracellular domain is essential for proteolytic release of the NRG extracellular domain and for determination of its subcellular localization (22Liu X. Hwang H. Cao L. Buchland M. Cunningham A. Chen J. Chien K.R. Graham R.M. Zhou M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13024-13029Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this study genetic disruption of only the intracellular domain of the membrane-bound NRG isoforms resulted in a similar phenotype of embryo maldevelopment, to that observed previously with disruption of the entire gene. This indicates that the NRG intracellular domain is critical for NRG signaling and raises the following questions: (i) how do cells cleave the signaling peptide, and (ii) what processes regulate and trigger cleavage/secretion? To further understand the molecular mechanism involved in these process, we have investigated the role of the cytoplasmic tail in regulating proteolytic cleavage/secretion. A series of mutants of the rat NDF-α2c isoform were constructed, in which either the intracellular domain was sequentially deleted from the C terminus, or specific segments of the intracellular domain were deleted. The constructs were then used to evaluate membrane expression and release of the 43-kDa functional peptide into the culture medium after transient expression in COS-7 cells. The results of these studies indicate that discrete segments of the intracellular domain of the NRG isoform, NDF-α2c, regulate cleavage/secretion through a process that likely involves initial intracellular domain-mediated dimer formation. (i) To construct NDF mutants encoding proteins in which 30 residues were sequentially deleted from the C terminus of the intracellular domain, the following primers were synthesized. Five 3′ primers (33-mer) were synthesized based on the coding sequence at the C-terminal region of the intracellular domain minus successive 30-residue segments at residues 392, 362, 332, 302, and 272 of NDF-α2c (20Wen D. Suggs S.V. Karunagaran D. Liu N. Cupples R.L. Luo Y. Janssen A.M. Ben-Baruch N. Trollinger D.B. Jacobsen V.L. Meng S.Y. Lu H.S. Hu S. Chang D. Yang W. Yanigahara D. Koski R.A. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1909-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Since various amino acids at the C terminus of TGF-α have been implicated in the regulation of its proteolytic processing, all NDF mutants were constructed with a codon for cysteine at their 3′-end. Each of the five intracellular domain-deleted cDNAs of NDF was amplified using polymerase chain reaction performed with the 5′ primer (T7) encoding the sequence of pcDNAIII vector (Invitrogen) and one of the 3′ primers, as well as the pcDNAIII-NDF-α2c (NDF-α2c cDNA inserted in the vector) as a template. Sequential internal deletion mutants were constructed using overlapping polymerase chain reaction. (ii) Two NDF cDNA fusion constructs were developed by replacing the region of the NDF-α2c cDNA encoding the C-terminal 150 residues of its intracellular domain (amino acids 272–422) with a GST cDNA fragment (encoding amino acids 5–155 of GST), designated 2c/gst, or by replacing the 120 residues (amino acids 302–422) of the intracellular domain with a human IgG1 Fc gene fragment (encoding 235 residues), designated NDF-α2c/Fc. The GST gene fragment was amplified with primers: 5′-CCAAAGCTTCATGATCGGCTTCGGCAG (5′-end primer with a HindIII site, underlined) and 5′-TGCCTCGAGAAAACCAAGAAGCAGCGGCAG (3′-end primer with aXhoI site, underlined) using pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as the template. The Fc gene fragment was amplified with primers: 5′-AAACTCGAGGTTGAGCCCAAATCTTGT (5′-end primer with a XhoI site) and 5′-CACTCTAGATCATTTACCCGGAGACAG (3′-end primer retaining an XbaI site). (iii) A DNA cassette encoding the FLAG epitope (IBI) was ligated via an N-terminalBamHI site of NDF mutant construct, 2c/gst, to give FLAG-2c/gst or fused to the N-terminal end of the intracellular domain of NDF-α2c (residue 264) to allow expression of a FLAG-fused intracellular domain protein, FLAG-NDF/CT. The FLAG-2 (IBI)vector was used for bacterial expression of the intracellular domain (FLAG-NDF/CT) and the GST cDNA fragment (FLAG-GST/P). The pGEX (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) vector was used to express the full-length GST (GST/F). All other mutant cDNAs were cloned between theEcoRI and XhoI sites in the polylinker of the mammalian expression vector, pcDNAIII, and confirmed by sequencing prior to transfection. COS-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were cultured in Dubecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells (1 × 106) were plated on 100-cm dishes and incubated under 5% CO2 for 15 h before transfection. Transfections were performed with 10 μg of cDNA using the dextran-DEAE (Life Technologies, Inc.) method as described previously (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Before harvesting conditioned medium, Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing CaCl2 (110 mg/ml) was used to replace the Dubecco's modified Eagle's medium/fetal bovine serum, and the cells were then incubated for a further 12 h. Human breast cancer cells MCF-7 (ATCC) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Before being stimulated by the recombinant NDF protein, the cells were starved for 20 h in RPMI 1640 serum-free medium. Transfected 1 × 107 cells were harvested by cold PBS with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and homogenized by 15 passes with a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer, then diluted 10-fold using the PBS. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 1464 × g for 10 min, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in the PBS and diluted to give a 6% (w/v) suspension. A volume (10.4) of this was mixed with 1.4 ml of Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 15-ml Corex tubes and centrifuged at 34,549 × g for 30 min. Two distinct layers close to the top of the tube were evident. These were harvested and washed in 5 volumes of 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in the PBS. Western blotting was performed as reported previously (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.41-16.44Google Scholar) using either plasma membranes prepared as described previously (24Perez D.M. Piascik M.T. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 876-883PubMed Google Scholar) or conditioned medium that was initially filtered through a 0.2-μm pore size sterile filter unit (Costar) and then concentrated up to 50-fold by centrifugation through a Centriplus 10 (Amicon) concentrator. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), and 30 μg of protein were loaded into each well. Affinity-purified anti-NDF extracellular domain antibody (1914) (Amgen) or anti-FLAG M2 antibody (IBI) was used as the primary antibody at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml (1:100 dilution), and anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used as the second antibody (1:3000 dilution). After SDS-PAGE, proteins were electroblotted onto Immobilon-P (Millipore) and detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The conditioned medium from transfected COS-7 cells was filtered through a 0.2-μm pore size sterile filter unit (Costar) and concentrated. The concentrate was added to individual wells of a 12-well plate containing 2 × 105 MCF-7 human breast cancer cells (ATCC) in each well. Following a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, the cells were lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer that contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 40 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium othovanadate and the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and leupeptin (10 μg/ml). The cell lysates were subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody RC-20 at a 1:1000 final dilution (Transduction Laboratories). Cells transfected with NDF-α2c and FLAG-2c/gst were plated in two-well Novex plates (Nunc) and cultured for 24–48 h. After rinsing the cells with PBS they were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde plus 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 30 min. The fixed cells were then blocked with 5% skimmed milk in PBS for 30 min, followed by incubation with anti-NDF intracellular domain antibody F20 (Santa Cruz) or anti-FLAG M2 antibody (IBI) for 45 min at room temperature. After washing, anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Silenus Laboratory, Melbourne, Australia) and anti-mouse IgG-TRITC (Sigma) was added and incubated for another 0.5 h. After washing, cells were mounted with 1% p-phenylenediamine (1 mg/ml, Sigma) in glycerol and then covered and sealed. Cells were examined using a UV fluorescence microscope and photographed with a 40× power objective. The plasmids FLAG-NDF/CT, FLAG-GST/P, and GST/F were transformed into theEscherichia coli strain, DH5α, and expressed by induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm) at room temperature for 3 h. After centrifugation of the culture medium at 5000 rpm for 15 min, the resulting pellet was resuspended in cold PBS with protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and sonicated for 6 min. The sonicated mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min and the supernatant fraction harvested. The supernatant fraction was subjected to cross-linking with 1 mm bis-sulfosuccinimidyl substrate (Pierce) at 4 °C for 1 h and then incubated with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, for 15 min to stop the reaction. COS-7 cells, transfected with FLAG-NDF/CT, were washed twice with cold PBS, scraped into 1 ml of PBS with protease inhibitors, and sonicated for 1 min to prepare the supernatant for cross-linking. The reaction mixture was subjected to Western blotting. The intracellular domain of NDF-α2c is comprised of 159 residues. We have demonstrated previously that a deletion mutant (C5, Fig. 1), which lacks almost the entire intracellular domain (i.e. the C-terminal 150 amino acids), is resistant to extracellular domain proteolytic cleavage. To evaluate if extracellular domain cleavage requires a specific sequence of the cytoplasmic domain or is merely dependent on the length of the C-terminal tail, an additional construct was developed in which the terminal 150 residues were replaced by an unrelated 150-residue stretch of the GST protein (Fig. 1 a). This construct, 2c/gst, the wild-type construct NDF-α2c, and the previously developed C5 construct were then evaluated for cleavage after expression of each construct in COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig.1 b, cleavage of the wild-type protein resulted in the release of a 43-kDa extracellular domain polypeptide into the culture medium. Despite a calculated molecular mass of only 26,000 Da for this ErbB-activating peptide, as reported previously (19Burgess T.L. Ross S.L. Qian Y. Brankow D. Hu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19188-19196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 20Wen D. Suggs S.V. Karunagaran D. Liu N. Cupples R.L. Luo Y. Janssen A.M. Ben-Baruch N. Trollinger D.B. Jacobsen V.L. Meng S.Y. Lu H.S. Hu S. Chang D. Yang W. Yanigahara D. Koski R.A. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1909-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), glycosylation results in its migrating as a molecular mass = 43 kDa species by SDS-PAGE. Unlike the wild-type protein, release of the 43-kDa peptide was not observed with expression of the two other constructs (Fig.1 b). This was not due to poor transfection or degradation of the mutated proteins, since their expression could be readily detected by Western blotting of cell lysates (Fig. 1 b). In keeping with these findings, release of the 43-kDa ErbB receptor-activating ligand from the 2c/gst construct could also not be detected in a functional assay, even though release of the neuregulin ligand from the wild-type NDF-α2c construct was readily apparent with this assay (Fig. 1 c). These data indicate that a specific sequence of the intracellular domain rather than amino acid length, per se, is involved in the proteolytic cleavage. By SDS-PAGE, the migration of the protein expressed by the C5 mutant is consistent with the molecular mass of its peptide backbone (30 kDa). In studies with the inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, tunicamycin, this was shown to be due to a lack of glycosylation of the C5-expressed protein (data not shown). The 2c/gst-encoded protein, however, like the wild-type NDF-α2c, was glycosylated as evidenced by the finding that it migrated at a considerably higher apparent molecular mass (65 kDa) than that calculated for its peptide backbone (46 kDa). Although expression of the cleavage-resistant mutants was apparent in the cell lysates, additional studies were performed to evaluate their subcellular localization in more detail. Plasma membrane expression of the wild-type and 2c/gst constructs was evident from Western blot analysis of purified plasma membrane (Fig.2 a). However, immunofluorescence labeling studies of permeabilized cells indicated that both the wild-type and 2c/gst encoded proteins colocalised predominantly to the same intracellular organelles rather than in the plasma membrane (Fig. 2 b). Similar intracellular localization was observed for all mutant constructs, i.e.C1–C5 (data not shown). Since the proteins expressed by the wild-type and mutant (2c/gst, C1, C2, C3) constructs are glycosylated, their intracellular localization is likely mainly in the Golgi, although some expression in the endoplasmic reticulum cannot be excluded. These findings are in agreement with those reported by Burgess et al. (19Burgess T.L. Ross S.L. Qian Y. Brankow D. Hu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19188-19196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which showed little membrane expression of NDF-α2c compared with another isoform, NDF-β4a. To further define the regions within the cytoplasmic domain that are involved in regulating cleavage, a series of C-terminal intracellular domain deletions of NDF-α2c was constructed, as shown in Fig.3 a. Compared with the full-length construct (NDF-α2c), these deletion mutants were truncated successively by 30 amino acids. Thus, construct C1 lacked 30 residues and construct C5 lacked 150 residues at the C terminus of the intracellular domain. As shown in Fig. 3 b, the proteins expressed in cells transfected with either of the first two deletion mutants, C1 and C2, behaved similarly to the wild-type NDF-α2c protein, since release of the expected 43-kDa functional peptide was readily apparent. In contrast, secretion of the 43-kDa peptide by the C3-, C4-, or C5-encoded protein was either only barely detectable or absent. Since expression of these mutant proteins was evident by Western blotting of cell lysates (Fig. 3 c), it is likely that the various truncations did not alter transcription or translation or reduce transfection efficiency. Taken together, these findings suggest that a 30-amino acid (residues 332–362) segment is required for cleavage. To more precisely identify the segments of the C-terminal tail involved in regulating proteolytic processing, six additional mutant constructs were evaluated (Fig. 4). Construct 2cΔ332–362, in which the 30 residues distinguishing the mutants C2 and C3 were deleted, but the remainder of the C-terminal tail (i.e. residues 362–422) was kept intact, surprisingly showed intact proteolytic cleavage. Thus, the 30-residue segment involving amino acids 332–362 is required for cleavage when the remainder of the C-terminal tail (aa 362–422) is also lacking as is construct, C3. However, cleavage was not observed with two other constructs, 2cΔ272–362 or C2Δ272–332 (constructed based on C2 in Fig. 3). The former retains only the C-terminal 60 amino acids (aa 362–422), whereas the latter lacks the C-terminal tail but retains the 30-residue segment aa 272–332. Thus, although the 30-residue segment, aa 332–362, and the C-terminal tail, aa 362–422, are necessary for cleavage, neither alone is sufficient. Rather an additional cytoplasmic region between aa 272–332 is also required. This conclusion is also evident from studies with two additional mutants, 2cΔ302–362 and C2Δ302–332. In these mutants, the C-terminal tail segment (aa 362–422) or the 30-residue segment (aa 332–362) were separately attached to a construct truncated at residue 302. Since cleavage was evident with both these constructs, the cytoplasmic region defined above (i.e. aa 272–332) as being required for cleavage can be narrowed down to a segment involving only residues 272–302. However, deletion of only these 30 residues (construct 2cΔ272–302) again did not affect cleavage. Taken together, these studies indicate that two of the three cytoplasmic segments, involving residues 272–302, 332–362, and 362–422 are both necessary and sufficient to allow extracellular domain cleavage. To test if these segments regulate cleavage by mediating protein/protein interactions, chemical cross-linking experiments were performed using a construct encoding only the NDF intracellular domain (NDF/CT, aa 272–422) following expression in E. coli. As shown in Fig. 5 a, after treatment with a cross-linking reagent, a protein complex with twice the molecular weight of the intracellular domain was detected by Western blot assay. By contrast, this protein complex was barely detectable in samples not treated with the cross-linking reagent. The same results were observed after expression of the NDF-α2c C-tail in COS-7 cells (Fig. 5 a), and dimer formation was observed with cross-linking even when cells were transfected with lower amounts of the NDF/CT-containing plasmid that resulted in low level expression of the encoded protein (data not shown). These data, therefore, indicate that regulation of extracellular domain cleavage may involve initial dimerization. Although previous studies demonstrated that full-length GST forms stable dimers in vitro (25Ji X. Zhang P. Armstrong R.N. Gilliland G.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10169-110184Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), this may not be the case for the truncated GST protein (residues 5–155) used in the 2c/gst construct, since cleavage/secretion was not observed with expression of this construct (Fig. 1). To confirm this conclusion, a full-length GST construct (GST/F), or the truncated GST sequence (GST/P, residues 5–155) used in the 2c/gst construct (the latter containing an N-terminal FLAG epitope), was expressed in E. coli and the resulting expressed proteins subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis, before and after cross-linking. As shown in Fig.5 b, although dimerization was readily apparent with the cross-linked GST/F protein, the GST/P protein was resistant to dimerization. To further test whether dimerization regulates NRG cleavage/secretion, an additional construct (C4/Fc) was developed (Fig.6 a). In this construct, an Fc fragment from human IgG1 was attached to the C terminus of the deletion mutant, C4, which in the absence of the Fc fragment does not support proteolytic cleavage of extracellular domain. Fc fragments dimerize spontaneously through hydrophobic packing, and under nonreducing conditions, dimerization can be detected due to disulfide bond formation. As shown in Fig. 6, cleavage was observed with expression of the C4/Fc construct but not with the C4 construct, and in vitro dimer stabilization by disulfide bond formation could be demonstrated only for the C4/Fc construct. Members of the EGF family include EGF, TGF-α, heparin-binding EGF, amphiregulin, and viral growth factors (26Massague J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar). These polypeptides are synthesized as precursor proteins consisting of an N-terminal signal peptide, a six-cysteine-containing EGF-like domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. Functional peptides that activate their cognate target receptors can be released from the extracellular domains of these proteins by proteolytic cleavage. Since cleavage/release can be stimulated by the activation of cellular signaling pathways (20Wen D. Suggs S.V. Karunagaran D. Liu N. Cupples R.L. Luo Y. Janssen A.M. Ben-Baruch N. Trollinger D.B. Jacobsen V.L. Meng S.Y. Lu H.S. Hu S. Chang D. Yang W. Yanigahara D. Koski R.A. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1909-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 27Harano T. Mizuno K. J.

Pandiella A. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1157-1165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), it is likely that spatial and temporal control of proteolytic cleavage is an important and common mechanism for regulating growth and development. In the case of TGF-α, there is evidence that the proteolytic cleavage from its membrane-bound precursor is regulated by the cytoplasmic tail, and, in particular, by the nature of the C-terminal amino acid (29Bosenberg M.W. Pandiella A. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1157-1165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 30Briley G.P. Hissong M.A. Chiu M.L. Lee D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 8: 1619-1631Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this study, we systematically analyzed the involvement of the intracellular domain of neuregulins in the regulation of extracellular domain cleavage by constructing a series of NDF-α2c mutants, which were then characterized after transient expression in a model cell culture system. Despite the heterologous nature of this system, it allows proteolytic release of the expected 43-kDa functional peptide from the full-length wild-type precursor neuregulin protein and has been used successfully to evaluate the cleavage/release mechanism of other proteins (27Harano T. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20305-20311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Arribas J. Massague J. J.

Biol. 1997; 8: 1619-1631Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Evidence that the C-terminal domain of NDF-α2c regulates proteolytic cleavage in a sequence-specific manner, is the finding that the 2c/gst fusion protein, which contained an intracellular domain of the same length as the wild type NDF-α2c protein, was resistant to proteolytic cleavage. Furthermore, studies with additional C-terminal truncation mutants indicate that while deletion of the terminal 30 or 60 intracellular domain amino acids is tolerated, deletion of more than 60 residues significantly reduces proteolytic cleavage. Thus, a region of the intracellular domain between amino acids 332 and 362 appears to be critical for correct proteolytic processing of membrane-bound neuregulin precursor proteins. As all constructs contained a C-terminal cysteine, involvement of the intracellular domain of NDF-α2c in the release of its functional peptide differs from that of TGF-α, where the presence of an hydrophobic amino acid appears to be critical for proteolytic cleavage (29Bosenberg M.W. Pandiella A. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1157-1165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This finding is not entirely unexpected, since there are other differences between TGF-α and NRGs. NRGs have a much longer cytoplasmic tail than TGF-α, which is highly conserved between species. In addition to the 332–362 segment, two other regions (residues 272–302 and 362–422) were subsequently shown to also be involved in cleavage/release. Moreover, any two of these three functional regions were shown to be sufficient for cleavage. By evaluating intracellular localization, we also demonstrated that failure to observe proteolysis is not due to impaired intracellular transport. Thus, extracellular proteolytic cleavage of NRG is regulated by its intracellular domain in a sequence-specific manner and may differ for the various NRG isoforms to provide specificity of responses to different biological stimuli. A concern regarding the above results is whether membrane insertion, protein orientation, or intracellular transport is altered with any of the mutants. Since NDF contains a cryptic internal signal sequence (the signal sequence is located within the transmembrane domain), membrane insertion or protein orientation of NDFs is determined by the transmembrane domain and by a limited number of charged residues flanking the transmembrane domain. Since the shortest mutant construct, C5, still contains nine residues C-terminal to the transmembrane-domain, it is unlikely that membrane insertion and orientation were altered with this or other C-terminally deleted constructs. In addition, the identical subcellular localization of both the wild-type NDF-α2c and 2c/gst proteins suggests that altered protein transport cannot account for the impaired cleavage/secretion of these mutants. We further show that regulation of extracellular domain cleavage may involve initial intracellular domain dimerization. Thus, when expressed alone, the NDF intracellular domains can be dimerized by treatment with a cross-linking reagent. In addition, susceptibility to cleavage can be restored by providing a heterologous intracellular domain that dimerizes spontaneously. Taken together, our data suggest that the spatial and temporal control of growth and development by membrane-bound neuregulin isoforms involves proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain and that this cleavage is regulated by initial intracellular domain dimerization. Such intracellular domain interactions may be initiated by activation of cellular signaling pathways to provide a uniqueinside-out signaling system to regulate NDF proteolytic cleavage and, thus, activation of ErbB receptors.

Inhibition of cPLA2 activity and AA-induced Ca2+ influx partly account for the ability of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and/or cGMP-dependent protein kinase to cause relaxation. Their importance resides in their location at the inception of the Ca2+ signaling cascade. phospholipase A 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphothioate, Sp-isomer N-[2(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinoline-sulfonamide hydrochloride (8R,9S,11S)-(−)-9-methoxy-carbamyl-8-methyl-2,3,9,10-tetrahydro-8,11-epoxy-1H,8H,11H,-2,7b,11a-trizadizobenzo(a,g)cycloocta(c,d,e)-trinden-1one protein kinase inhibitor (14Lin L.L.

Phosphorylation by cAMP- or cGMP-dependent protein kinase in vivohas not been characterized. Agonist-induced, G protein-dependent activation of cPLA2 has been demonstrated in dispersed intestinal smooth muscle cells and is the initial trigger for Ca2+mobilization in muscle cells of the longitudinal layer (22Murthy K.S. Kuemmerle J.F. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G93-G102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An initial transient increase in cPLA2 activity occurs only in smooth muscle cells from the intestinal longitudinal layer and coincides with the initial Ca2+ transient. This is followed by a sustained increase in cPLA2 activity, which is partly dependent on activation of protein kinase C. The initial increase in cPLA2 activity in longitudinal muscle leads to arachidonic acid (AA)-induced stimulation of Ca2+ influx, which triggers Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic stores via ryanodine receptor/Ca2+ channels and stimulates the activity of ADP-ribosylcyclase. The resultant increase in cADP ribose enhances Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (22Murthy K.S. Kuemmerle J.F. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G93-G102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kuemmerle J.F. Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 266: C1421-C1431Crossref Google Scholar, 24Kuemmerle J.F. Makhlouf G.M. J.

Unlike longitudinal smooth muscle, agonist-stimulated Ca2+mobilization in smooth muscle of the circular layer is mediated by phospholipase C-β1 and/or -β3, resulting in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-dependent Ca2+ release (25Bitar K.N.

Only small amounts of IP3 are formed in longitudinal smooth muscle, which does not possess high affinity IP3 receptor/Ca2+channels (23Kuemmerle J.F. Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J.

The initial steps in Ca2+ mobilization in vascular and intestinal circular smooth muscle (i.e. activation of PLC-β and stimulation of Ca2+ release) are inhibited by cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases (27Cornwell T.L.

It is not known, however, whether the initial steps in Ca2+mobilization in intestinal longitudinal smooth muscle (i.e.activation of cPLA2 and stimulation of Ca2+influx) are influenced by cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases. In this study, we have examined the initial steps in Ca2+ signaling in longitudinal intestinal smooth muscle to determine the ability of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases (a) to phosphorylate cPLA2 and influence its activity and (b) to modulate AA-induced stimulation of Ca2+ influx. The results provide the first evidence of inhibitory phosphorylation of cPLA2 by both cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases and demonstrate their ability to regulate the initial step in Ca2+ signaling. The next step, i.e. AA-stimulated Ca2+ influx, is selectively inhibited by cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Smooth muscle cells were isolated from the longitudinal muscle layer of rabbit intestine by sequential enzymatic digestion, filtration, and centrifugation as described previously (22Murthy K.S.

Muscle strips were incubated for 30 min at 31 °C in 15 ml of HEPES medium containing 0.1% collagenase (type II) and 0.1% soybean trypsin inhibitor with no added Ca2+. The composition of the medium was 120 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2.6 mmKH2PO4, 0.6 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, 14 mm glucose, and 2.1% Eagle's essential amino acid mixture. The partly digested tissue was washed with 100 ml of enzyme-free medium and reincubated for 30 min to allow spontaneous dispersion of muscle cells. The cells were harvested by filtration through 500-μm Nitex mesh, centrifuged twice for 10 min at 350 × g, and resuspended in HEPES medium containing 2 mm Ca2+. Contraction of dispersed muscle cells was measured by scanning micrometry as described previously (22Murthy K.S. Kuemmerle J.F. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G93-G102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kuemmerle J.F. Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 266: C1421-C1431Crossref Google Scholar, 24Kuemmerle J.F. Makhlouf G.M. J.

An aliquot (0.5 ml) of cells (104 cells/ml) was added to 0.2 ml of medium containing 1 μm AA in the presence of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 μm) and the lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (10 μm). The reaction was terminated after 30 s with acrolein. Inhibition of contraction (i.e. relaxation) was measured in muscle cells maximally contracted for 30 s with AA (1 μm). Relaxation was expressed as the increase in the length of AA-contracted muscle cells (mean resting muscle cell length, 118 ± 5 μm; mean length of AA-contracted muscle cells, 83 ± 2 μm). Ca2+ influx in dispersed muscle cells was measured from the initial uptake of45Ca2+ in the presence of anti-mycin and thapsigargin to prevent uptake into mitochondrial and sarcoplasmic Ca2+ stores. Dispersed muscle cells were suspended in 10 ml of HEPES medium containing 2 mm Ca2+ and45Ca2+ (10 μCi/ml), with thapsigargin (2 μm) and anti-mycin (10 μm). The muscle cells were treated for 60 s with a relaxant agent (Na nitroprusside (SNP) and isoproterenol) or protein kinase activator (cBIMPS and 8-pcCPT-cGMP), followed by addition of 1 μmAA for 2 min. Samples (0.5 ml) were withdrawn at intervals for measurement of 45Ca2+ cell content. The muscle cells were centrifuged and washed twice with HEPES medium, and the45Ca2+ cell content was measured and expressed as cpm/106 cells. Phosphorylation of cPLA2 was measured from the amount of [32P]ATP incorporated into the enzyme after immunoprecipitation with specific cPLA2 antibody. Dispersed smooth muscle cells (10 ml, 4 × 106 cells/ml) were prelabeled with 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h. Samples (0.5 ml) were incubated with various relaxant agents for 60 s in the presence or absence of cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitors (H-89 or myristoylated PKI) or cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor (KT-5823), and the reaction was terminated with an equal volume of lysis buffer (final concentrations, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, 0.75% deoxycholate, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 50 mm NaF, 0.2 mm Na3VO4) and placed on ice for 30 min. The cell lysates were separated from the insoluble material by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, precleared with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, and incubated with polyclonal rabbit cPLA2 antibody for 2 h at 4 °C and with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B for another 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were collected, washed five times with 1 ml of wash buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), extracted with Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 15 min, and separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes,32P-labeled cPLA2 was visualized by autoradiography, and the amount of radioactivity in the band was measured. cPLA2 activity in dispersed muscle cells was measured by an adaptation of the method of Damron et al.(33Damron D.S. Van Wagoner D.R. Moravec C.S. Bond M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27335-27344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (22Murthy K.S. Kuemmerle J.F. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G93-G102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty ml of cell suspension (106 cells/ml) were incubated with [3H]AA (1 μCi/ml) at 31 °C for 3 h. The cells were diluted with 50 ml of HEPES medium, centrifuged at 350 × g for 15 min, and then resuspended in 10 ml of fresh medium containing 10 μm indomethacin and 10 μmnordihydroguaiaretic acid to inhibit AA metabolism via the lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways. Duplicate samples (106cells/0.5 ml) were incubated at 31 °C with 1 nmcholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) for 30 s, and the reaction was terminated with 1.8 ml of chloroform/methanol/HCl (100:200:2, v/v/v). The phases were separated with 0.6 ml of chloroform and 0.6 ml of 2 mm HCl. The organic phase was dried under nitrogen, resuspended in 50 μl of chloroform/methanol (9:1), and spotted on silica gel plates for thin layer chromatography using hexane/ethylether/acetic acid (70:30:3.5). The radioactivity in spots corresponding to AA was counted, and the results were expressed as cpm/106 cells above basal levels. [3H]arachidonic acid (210 Ci/mmol), carrier-free [32P]Pi, and45Ca2+ were obtained from NEN Life Science Products; indomethacin, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, and PKI were from Biomol; polyclonal antibodies to cPLA2 were from Santa Cruz; HEPES was from Research Biochemicals; thapsigargin and H-89 were from Calbiochem; CCK-8 and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) were from Bachem; KT-5823 was from Kamiya Biomedical (Thousand Oaks, CA); 8-pcCPT-cGMP and cBIMPS were from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA); and all other reagents were from Sigma. Selective activators of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (8-pcCPT-cGMP) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cBIMPS) and three relaxant agents were used to determine the ability of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases to phosphorylate cPLA2 in smooth muscle: SNP, which stimulates cGMP and selectively activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase at concentrations <1 μm; isoproterenol, which stimulates cAMP and preferentially activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase at low concentrations (<1 μm) but can cross-activate cGMP-dependent protein kinase at higher concentrations; and VIP, which stimulates both cAMP and cGMP in gastric smooth muscle and activates cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases at all concentrations (32Murthy K.S.

The cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitors H-89 and myristoylated PKI and the cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor KT-5823 were used to evaluate the involvement of each kinase in cPLA2 phosphorylation. Previous studies (32Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C171-C180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase activity in dispersed muscle cells had shown that at concentrations of ≤1 μm, H-89 and KT-5823 were selective inhibitors of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases, respectively. Both 8-pcCPT-cGMP and cBIMPS increased cPLA2phosphorylation in dispersed muscle cells by 406 ± 58% (p < 0.01) and 343 ± 40% (p < 0.01), respectively. Phosphorylation induced by 8-pcCPT-cGMP was abolished by KT-5823 (98 ± 2% inhibition) but was not affected by H-89 or myristoylated PKI, whereas phosphorylation induced by cBIMPS was abolished by H-89 (97 ± 2% inhibition) and myristoylated PKI (99 ± 3% inhibition) but was not affected by KT-5823 (Fig.1). SNP, isoproterenol (1 μm), and VIP also increased cPLA2phosphorylation by 515 ± 67% (p < 0.01), 262 ± 23% (p < 0.01), and 459 ± 52% (p < 0.01), respectively (Fig.2). The phosphorylation induced by SNP was abolished by KT-5823 (98 ± 2% inhibition) but was not affected by H-89 or myristoylated PKI, whereas phosphorylation induced by 1 μm isoproterenol was abolished by H-89 (99 ± 4% inhibition) and myristoylated PKI (98 ± 3% inhibition) but was not significantly affected by KT-5823. Phosphorylation induced by 1 μm VIP was weakly inhibited by myristoylated PKI and H-89 (17 ± 3% inhibition; p < 0.02) but was not affected by KT-5823; however, a combination of H-89 and KT-5823 virtually abolished cPLA2 phosphorylation (87 ± 7% inhibition). Because VIP activates both cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases, minimal inhibition by each kinase inhibitor separately and virtually complete inhibition by a combination of both inhibitors suggest interplay of the two kinases when activated concurrently.Figure 2Phosphorylation of cPLA2 by relaxant agents in smooth muscle. Intestinal smooth muscle cells labeled with 32P were incubated with cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitors H-89 (1 μm) and myristoylated PKI (1 μm) or the cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor KT-5823 (1 μm) for 10 min and treated with isoproterenol (ISOP; 1 μm), SNP (0.1 μm), or VIP (1 μm) for 1 min. Immunoprecipitates using polyclonal cPLA2 antibody were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 32P-labeled cPLA2 was identified by autoradiography (upper panel), and the measured radioactivity was expressed as cpm/mg protein (lower panel).

Inhibition of phosphorylation: ∗∗, p < 0.01; ∗,p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previous studies have shown that activation of cPLA2 by contractile agonists (e.g. CCK-8) is biphasic, with an initial peak of activity during the first minute followed by a sustained phase of activity that is partly mediated by protein kinase C (22Murthy K.S. Kuemmerle J.F. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G93-G102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of cPLA2 was not present during the initial phase (1 min) of cPLA2 activity but increased significantly during the sustained phase (10 min after treatment with CCK-8). Preincubation of the cells with the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C (1 μm) abolished the increase in cPLA2phosphorylation during the sustained phase and, as shown previously (22Murthy K.S. Kuemmerle J.F. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G93-G102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inhibited cPLA2 activity by 40% (Fig.3). The initial peak of cPLA2 activity induced by CCK-8 (431 ± 41 cpm arachidonic acid/106 cells in the presence of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors) was inhibited by 1 μm isoproterenol (36 ± 8% inhibition;p < 0.01) and by the selective cAMP-dependent protein kinase activator cBIMPS (54 ± 2%; p < 0.001). The inhibition of cPLA2activity by either agent was completely reversed by H-89 and PKI but was not affected by KT-5823 (Fig. 4). The initial peak of CCK-stimulated cPLA2 activity was also inhibited by SNP (75 ± 5%, p < 0.01) and the selective cGMP-dependent protein kinase activator 8-pcCPT-cGMP (51 ± 2%, p < 0.001); the inhibition by either agent was completely reversed by KT-5823 but was not affected by H-89 or PKI (Fig. 5). A higher concentration of isoproterenol (100 μm), which activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase and cross-activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase, inhibited CCK-stimulated cPLA2 activity by 83 ± 4% (p < 0.001); the inhibition was partly reversed by H-89 and PKI to 55 ± 3 and 56 ± 6%, respectively, and by KT-5823 to 66 ± 5% and was completely reversed by a combination of KT-5823 with either H-89 or PKI (Fig.6). Similarly, VIP (1 μm), which activates both cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases, inhibited CCK-stimulated cPLA2 activity by 88 ± 4% (p < 0.001); the inhibition was partly reversed by H-89 and PKI to 58 ± 6 and 55 ± 7%, respectively, and to a lesser extent by KT-5823 (73 ± 6%) and was completely reversed by a combination of both inhibitors (Fig. 6).Figure 5Inhibition of agonist-stimulated cPLA2 activity by selective activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase.

Kuemmerle J.F. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G93-G102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the rate of Ca2+ influx was measured from the initial uptake of 45Ca2+ (2869 ± 510 cpm/106 cells) induced by exogenous AA in the presence of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors. AA-induced Ca2+influx was not affected by selective activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with cBIMPS (3115 ± 321 cpm/106 cells) or 1 μm isoproterenol (2816 ± 636 cpm/106 cells). A higher concentration of isoproterenol (100 μm) inhibited AA-induced Ca2+ influx by 84 ± 4% (p < 0.001); the inhibition was completely reversed by KT-5823 but was not affected by H-89 (Fig. 7), implying that inhibition was dependent on cross-activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase by higher concentrations of isoproterenol. Consistent with selective inhibition of Ca2+ influx by cGMP-dependent protein kinase, SNP and 8-pcCPT-cGMP inhibited AA-induced Ca2+ influx by 83 ± 4% (p < 0.001) and 62 ± 8% (p < 0.01), respectively; the inhibition by both SNP and 8-pcCPT-cGMP was completely reversed by KT-5823 but was not affected by H-89 (Fig.8). AA-stimulated Ca2+ influx in intestinal longitudinal smooth muscle cells leads to Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic stores in intestinal longitudinal smooth muscle cells; the resultant increase in [Ca2+]i triggers an initial muscle contraction (22Murthy K.S.

AA-induced muscle contraction (36.2 ± 2.9 μm decrease in muscle cell length) was inhibited by activators of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (SNP and 8-pcCPT-cGMP) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (1 μmisoproterenol and cBIMPS) (Figs. 9 and10). The inhibition of contraction (i.e. relaxation) induced by SNP and 8-pcCPT-cGMP was selectively blocked by KT-5823 (Fig. 9), whereas the inhibition of contraction induced by 1 μm isoproterenol and cBIMPS was selectively blocked by H-89 (Fig. 10). Thus, although cAMP-dependent protein kinase had no effect on AA-induced Ca2+ influx, it inhibited contraction by acting at one or more loci distal to AA-induced Ca2+ influx.Figure 10Blockade of relaxation in dispersed smooth muscle cells by cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitors. Contraction of dispersed intestinal smooth muscle cells treated with AA for 30 s was measured by scanning micrometry. Inhibition of AA-induced contraction (i.e.relaxation) by isoproterenol (1 μm) or cBIMPS (10 μm) measured in the presence and absence of H-89 and/or KT-5823 was expressed as the mean change in muscle cell length (μm).

The kinases act on various molecular targets to inhibit Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic stores and Ca2+ influx into the cell, and to stimulate Ca2+ efflux from the cell. The targets include the effector enzyme PLC-β, the sarcoplasmic IP3receptor/Ca2+ channel, plasmalemmal, and sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase pumps, and plasmalemmal Ca2+ and K+ channels, all of which are affected by both cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases, except for the sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase pump, which is selectively inhibited by cGMP-dependent protein kinase (31Murthy K.S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8701-8707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ mobilization in smooth muscle from the intestinal longitudinal layer, however, differs markedly in that it is initiated by G protein-dependent activation of cPLA2 and generation of arachidonic acid; the latter triggers Ca2+influx and induces Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic stores via ryanodine receptors/Ca2+ channels (22Murthy K.S. Kuemmerle J.F. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G93-G102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kuemmerle J.F. Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 266: C1421-C1431Crossref Google Scholar). Minimal amounts of IP3 are produced in this smooth muscle, which is virtually devoid of IP3 receptors/Ca2+ channels (23Kuemmerle J.F. Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 266: C1421-C1431Crossref Google Scholar, 26Murthy K.S. Grider J.R. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G937-G944PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we show that by analogy with other types of smooth muscle, the initial steps in Ca2+ mobilization in longitudinal smooth muscle, i.e. activation of cPLA2 and arachidonic acid-induced Ca2+ influx, are inhibited by cAMP- or cGMP-dependent protein kinase. It is possible that more distal targets involved in Ca2+mobilization in intestinal longitudinal muscle, such as ryanodine receptors/Ca2+ channels, Ca2+-ATPase pumps, and plasmalemmal Ca2+ and K+ channels, are also susceptible to regulatory phosphorylation by cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases, but these were not examined in the present study. Agonist-induced phosphorylation of cPLA2 in various cell types is accompanied by increase in cPLA2 activity, which appears to be mediated by protein kinase C-dependent and -independent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (19Qui Z.-H.

In the present study we show a delayed, protein kinase C-dependent, stimulatory phosphorylation of cPLA2 induced by the contractile agonist CCK and demonstrate for the first time an inhibitory phosphorylation induced by relaxant agonists (SNP, isoproterenol, and VIP) and activators of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cBIMPS) and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (8-pcCPT-cGMP). The different patterns of phosphorylation by contractile and relaxant agonists suggest that the residues phosphorylated by cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases are distinct from the residues (chiefly Ser505) phosphorylated by protein kinase C-dependent mechanisms (14Lin L.L.

Phosphorylation of cPLA2 induced by relaxant agents that preferentially activated cAMP-dependent protein kinase (i.e. low concentrations of isoproterenol) was blocked by the selective cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitors H-89 and myristoylated PKI, whereas phosphorylation induced by relaxant agents that preferentially activated cGMP-dependent protein kinase (i.e. SNP) was blocked by the selective cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor KT-5823. Phosphorylation induced by agents that activated both cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases (i.e. VIP) was partially blocked by cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitors and abolished by a combination of both inhibitors (32Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C171-C180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pattern of inhibition of cPLA2 activity by cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases paralleled the pattern of phosphorylation of cPLA2, suggesting that inhibition of activity was probably mediated by phosphorylation. The initial peak (1 min) of cPLA2 activity elicited by the contractile agonist CCK-8 was inhibited by both cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases. The inhibition induced by cBIMPS and low concentrations of isoproterenol was selectively blocked by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitors H-89 and myristoylated PKI, whereas the inhibition induced by 8-pcCPT-cGMP and SNP was selectively blocked by the selective cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor KT-5823. Inhibition induced by VIP and high concentrations of isoproterenol, which activate both cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases, was partially blocked by cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitors and completely blocked by a combination of both inhibitors (32Murthy K.S.

The next step in Ca2+ mobilization in intestinal longitudinal smooth muscle, i.e. arachidonic acid-induced Ca2+ influx (22Murthy K.S. Kuemmerle J.F. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J.

The molecular target of cGMP-dependent protein kinase in this instance could be either Cl−channels or voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. Previous studies (46Kuemmerle J.F. Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 28: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have shown that arachidonic acid activates primarily Cl− channels, resulting in membrane depolarization and opening of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. Consistent with this notion, depolarization and Ca2+ influx induced by contractile agonists was abolished by cPLA2 inhibitors and stilbene Cl− channel blockers; nifedipine, on the other hand, abolished Ca2+ influx but only partially inhibited depolarization, implying that Ca2+ influx was only a minor contributor to membrane depolarization. Depolarization and Ca2+ influx induced by nanomolar concentrations of exogenous arachidonic acid was also abolished by stilbene Cl− channel blockers (46Kuemmerle J.F. Murthy K.S. Makhlouf G.M. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 28: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The present study addressed only the initial steps in Ca2+mobilization and showed that inhibition of the effector enzyme cPLA2, which mirrors inhibition of PLC-β in other smooth muscle cell types, was mediated by cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases, whereas inhibition of AA-induced Ca2+influx was exclusively mediated by cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Blockade of either step by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and/or cGMP-dependent protein kinase should lead to a decrease in [Ca2+]i and inhibition of muscle contraction. A decrease in [Ca2+]i, however, could also result from inhibition of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, stimulation of Ca2+ uptake into intracellular stores, and Ca2+ extrusion from the cell. Furthermore, inhibition of muscle contraction could also reflect phosphorylation by cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases of targets distal to those involved in Ca2+ mobilization, such as myosin light chain kinase and/or phosphatase (37Somlyo A.P.

We have recently isolated and characterized the Rab3 regulators, GDP/GTP exchange protein (GEP) and GTPase activating protein (GAP), both of which are specific for the Rab3 subfamily. Rab3 GEP stimulates the conversion of the GDP-bound inactive form to the GTP-bound active form, whereas Rab3 GAP stimulates the reverse reaction. Of the four members of the Rab3 subfamily, evidence is accumulating that Rab3A is involved in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, particularly in neurotransmitter release. We first analyzed the subcellular localization of Rab3 GEP and GAP in rat brain. Subcellular fractionation analysis showed that both Rab3 GEP and GAP were enriched in the synaptic soluble fraction. Immunocytochemical analysis in primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons showed that both Rab3 GEP and GAP were concentrated at the presynaptic nerve terminals. We then examined whether Rab3 GEP and GAP were involved in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis by use of human growth hormone (GH) co-expression assay system of cultured PC12 cells. Overexpression of the deletion mutant of Rab3 GEP possessing the catalytic activity reduced the high K+-induced GH release without affecting the basal GH release, whereas that of the deletion mutant lacking the catalytic activity showed no effect on the high K+-induced GH release. In contrast, overexpression of Rab3 GAP or its deletion mutant possessing the catalytic activity did not affect the high K+-induced GH release or the basal GH release. These results indicate that Rab3 GEP and GAP are colocalized with Rab3A at the synaptic release sites and suggest that they regulate the activity of Rab3A and are involved in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis.

The Rab3 subfamily belongs to this Rab family and consists of four members, Rab3A, -B, -C, and -D (for reviews, see Refs. 4Fisher von Mollard G. Stahl B. Li C. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Trends Biochem.

Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 615-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Of these members, Rab3A and -C are present in cells with Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, particularly abundant in neuron, although Rab3B and -C are also expressed in other types of cells. Evidence is accumulating that Rab3A is involved in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, particularly in neurotransmitter release. Recent knockout mice results indicate that Rab3A is not essential for Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release, but it plays two different roles: one is to efficiently dock synaptic vesicles to the presynaptic plasma membrane (6Geppert M. Bolshakov V.Y. Siegelbaum S.A. Takei K. De-Camilli P. Hammer R.E. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), and the other is to regulate the efficiency of the fusion process (7Geppert M. Goda Y. Stevens C.F. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 810-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that Rab3A is involved in the formation of long term potentiation in hippocampus (8Castillo P.E. Janz R. Südhof T.C. Tzounopoulos T. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The precise mechanisms of Rab3A in the regulation of these docking and fusion processes remain unknown, but Rab3A is regulated by at least three types of regulators: Rab GDI,1 Rab3 GEP, and Rab3 GAP (for reviews, see Refs. 5Takai Y. Sasaki T. Shirataki H. Nakanishi H. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 615-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar and 9Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 519-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Of these regulators, Rab GDI is a general regulator of all the Rab family members including Rab3A, whereas the other two are specific for the Rab3 subfamily. Rab3 GEP is a regulator that stimulates the GDP/GTP exchange reaction and thereby the conversion from the GDP-bound inactive form to the GTP-bound active form (10Wada M. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Hirano H. Obaishi H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3875-3878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and Rab3 GAP stimulates the GTPase activity and thereby the conversion from the GTP-bound form to the GDP-bound form (11Fukui K. Sasaki T. Imazumi K. Matsuura Y. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4655-4658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Rab GDI has three activities. 1) Rab GDI preferentially interacts with the GDP-bound form of Rab family members and keeps them in the GDP-bound form in the cytosol by preventing them from being converted to the GTP-bound form by the action of each Rab GEP and from being associated with each of their target membranes; 2) Rab GDI transports its complexed Rab family members to each of their target membranes where the GDP-bound form dissociates from Rab GDI by the action of each putative Rab GDI displacement factor, followed by conversion to the GTP-bound form by the action of each Rab GEP; and 3) after the GTP-bound form accomplishes its function, it is converted to the GDP-bound form by the action of each Rab GAP. Once the GDP-bound form is produced, Rab GDI forms a complex with it and translocates it to the cytosol. All the three regulators are abundant in brain, but they are ubiquitously expressed (10Wada M.

Sasaki T. Shirataki H. Nakanishi H. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 615-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Recent genetic analysis inCaenorhabditis elegans has shown that Aex-3, aC. elegans homologue of mammalian Rab3 GEP, is involved in Rab3A localization to synaptic vesicles (13Iwasaki K. Staunton J.

Neuron. 1997; 18: 613-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), but it has not been shown whether Rab3 GEP and GAP indeed function in intact cells in mammals. In this study, we first analyzed the localization of Rab3 GEP and GAP in rat brain and primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We then examined whether Rab3 GEP and GAP are involved in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis by use of the GH co-expression assay system in cultured PC12 cells. In this system, expressed GH is known to be stored in dense core vesicles and to be released in response to high K+ in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (14Schweitzer E.S. Kelly R.B. J.

Recombinant rat Rab3 GEP and human Rab3 GAP were purified from the cytosol fraction of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells overexpressing the respective proteins. 2Y. Takai, manuscript in preparation. PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% horse serum at 37 °C in 10% CO2 as described (20Sano K. Kikuchi A. Matsui Y. Teranishi Y. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated against glutathioneS-transferase-fusion proteins of the middle region of rat Rab3 GEP (amino acid residues 863–1431) and the N-terminal region of human Rab3 GAP (amino acid residues 1–303). A mouse anti-Rab3A monoclonal antibody, SG-11–7, was prepared as described (21Mizoguchi A. Kim S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Yorifuji H. Hirokawa N. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11872-11879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibodies against NMDA receptor 2A/B and synaptophysin were purchased from Chemicon and Boehringer Mannheim, respectively. Hybridoma cells expressing the anti-MYC mouse antibody (9E10) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Human GH was expressed using pXGH5, in which GH expression is driven by the mouse metallothionein-I promoter (22Selden R.F. Howie K.B. Rowe M.E. Goodman H.M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3173-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression plasmids pCMV-MYC and pEFBOS-MYC were generated to express fusion proteins with the N-terminal MYC epitope (19Orita S. Sasaki T. Komuro R. Sakaguchi G. Maeda M. Igarashi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7257-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol.

The cDNA fragments encoding rat Rab3 GEP and its deletion mutants were inserted into pCMV-MYC, and the cDNA fragments of human Rab3 GAP, its deletion mutants, and Rab3AQ81L were inserted into pEFBOS-MYC. Subcellular fractionation of rat brain was carried out as described (21Mizoguchi A. Kim S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Yorifuji H. Hirokawa N. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11872-11879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of each subcellular fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with the anti-Rab3 GEP and anti-Rab3 GAP polyclonal antibodies and the anti-Rab3A and anti-NMDA receptor 2A/B monoclonal antibodies. Embryos were obtained from Wistar rats on generation day 20. Hippocampi were isolated, dissociated, plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips (Matsunami Glass, Ind. Ltd., Kishiwada, Japan), and cultured in minimal essential medium with 10% horse serum. After 4 days, the medium was replaced with minimal essential medium supplemented with N2 supplement (24Bottenstein J.E. Sato G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 514-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar), 1 mg/ml ovalbumin, 1 mm pyruvate, and 5 mm cytosine arabinoside. For localization of either Rab3 GEP, Rab3 GAP, Rab3A, or synaptophysin, hippocampal cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. The fixed cells were incubated for 10 min with 50 mm ammonium chloride in PBS and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After being soaked in 10% FBS/PBS for 1 h, the cells were treated with the first antibodies in 10% FBS/PBS for 1 h. The cells were then washed with PBS three times, followed by incubation with the fluorescence-conjugated second antibodies in 10% FBS/PBS for 1 h. After being washed with PBS three times, the cells were examined using a confocal imaging system (MRC1024; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). PC12 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells per 35-mm dish and incubated for 18–24 h. The cells were then co-transfected with 2 μg of pXGH5 and 2 μg of the indicated expression plasmid using LipofectAMINE reagent according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) (19Orita S. Sasaki T. Komuro R. Sakaguchi G. Maeda M. Igarashi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7257-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). GH release experiments were performed 48 h after transfection. PC12 cells were washed with physiological salt solution (PSS; 140 mmNaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 11 mm glucose) and incubated for 10 min with a high K+ solution (PSS containing 60 mm KCl and 85 mm NaCl) or a low K+ solution (PSS containing 4.7 mm KCl and 140 mm NaCl). The amounts of GH released into the medium and retained in the cells were measured using a radioimmunoassay kit (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA). Immunocytochemistry was performed 48 h after transfection. The cells were fixed and stained as described above. Human GH was detected with a rabbit anti-human GH polyclonal antibody (Dako Co., Carpinteria, CA) and a donkey anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to rhodamine (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA). The MYC epitope was detected with a mouse anti-MYC monoclonal antibody and a donkey anti-mouse antibody conjugated to fluorescein (Chemicon). The cells were examined using a confocal imaging system (LSM 410; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). To estimate the expression levels of Rab3 GEP and GAP in PC12 cells, both the proteins were detected with the respective antibodies and a donkey anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to fluorescein (Chemicon). The cells were analyzed using a photometry system (P102; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar, 26Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with bovine serum albumin as a reference protein as described (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Our previous Northern blot analysis showed that Rab3 GEP and GAP were expressed in all the tissues examined (10Wada M. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Hirano H. Obaishi H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3875-3878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11Fukui K. Sasaki T. Imazumi K. Matsuura Y. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4655-4658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of the subcellular fractions of rat brain indicated that the proteins detected with antibodies against Rab3 GEP and GAP were enriched in the synaptic soluble fraction (Fig. 1). In contrast, Rab3A was concentrated in the crude synaptic vesicle fraction and the NMDA receptor 2A/B was concentrated in the crude synaptic membrane fraction, consistent with earlier observations (21Mizoguchi A. Kim S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Yorifuji H. Hirokawa N. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11872-11879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). We stained Rab3 GEP and GAP in primary cultured hippocampal neurons from rat embryo using the respective antibodies. Rab3 GEP and GAP showed a punctate staining pattern along neuritic processes (Fig. 2). This staining pattern was similar to those of Rab3A and synaptophysin, known to be localized on synaptic vesicles (21Mizoguchi A. Kim S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Yorifuji H. Hirokawa N. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11872-11879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Jahn R. Schiebler W. Ouimet C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The punctate staining patterns of Rab3 GEP and GAP indicate that they are also localized in the synaptic release sites. This result is consistent with the result of Fig. 1. The anti-Rab3 GEP and anti-Rab3 GAP antibodies used above were specific for each protein. The anti-Rab3 GEP antibody specifically recognized recombinant rat Rab3 GEP, which was expressed using the insect/baculovirus system (Fig.3 A, lane 1). This antibody recognized only Rab3 GEP with a M r of about 210,000 in the rat brain synaptic soluble fraction and the PC12 cell lysate (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2 and 3). The anti-Rab3 GAP antibody specifically recognized recombinant human Rab3 GAP, which was expressed using the insect/baculovirus system (Fig. 3 B, lane 1). This antibody specifically recognized Rab3 GAP with aM r of about 130,000 in the rat brain synaptic soluble fraction and the PC12 cell lysate and also Rab3 GAP purified from rat brain (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2–4). We then examined whether Rab3 GEP and GAP are involved in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis by use of a GH co-expression assay system in cultured PC12 cells. When the dominant active mutant of Rab3A (pEFBOS-MYC-Rab3AQ81L) was overexpressed in PC12 cells, the high K+-induced GH release was inhibited about 47% (Fig. 4). Under the same conditions, overexpression of the deletion mutant of Rab3 GEP lacking the C-terminal 108 amino acid residues (pCMV-MYC-Rab3 GEPΔC1) inhibited the high K+-induced GH release about 32%. However, the deletion mutant lacking the C-terminal 242 amino acids residues (pCMV-MYC-Rab3 GEPΔC2) did not affect the high K+-induced GH release. Similarly, the deletion mutant lacking the C-terminal 392 amino acids residues (pCMV-MYC-Rab3 GEPΔC3), the N-terminal 607 amino acids residues (pCMV-MYC-Rab3 GEPΔN1), or the N-terminal 1029 amino acids residues (pCMV-MYC-Rab3 GEPΔN2) did not inhibit the high K+-induced GH release. None of these constructs affected the basal GH release. When these MYC-tagged deletion mutants were expressed in COS-7 cells and assayed for the Rab3 GEP activity, the deletion mutant lacking the C-terminal 108 amino acid residues showed GEP activity as full-length Rab3 GEP, whereas other deletion mutants did not show GEP activity, indicating that the GEP activity of Rab3 GEP is necessary for the inhibition of the high K+-induced GH release. In contrast, full-length Rab3 GAP (pEFBOS-MYC-Rab3 GAP) did not affect the high K+-induced GH release (Fig. 4). We have previously shown that the catalytic domain of Rab3 GAP resided in at least 601–981 amino acid residues (11Fukui K. Sasaki T. Imazumi K. Matsuura Y. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4655-4658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The deletion mutant containing the catalytic domain (pEFBOS-MYC-Rab3 GAP-C) did not inhibit the high K+-induced GH release. The deletion mutant lacking the catalytic domain (pEFBOS-MYC-Rab3 GAP-N) did not inhibit the high K+-induced GH release, either. These constructs did not affect the basal GH release. These results indicate that exogenously expressed Rab3 GAP does not inhibit the high K+-induced GH release irrespective of the presence and absence of the GAP activity. The failure of Rab3 GAP to inhibit the high K+-induced GH release was not simply because of its expression level being lower than that of Rab3 GEP in PC12 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, Rab3 GEP and GAP were indeed expressed in PC12 cells, and the contents of Rab3 GEP and GAP were 0.05 and 0.01% of the total protein, respectively. We then examined how much exogenous Rab3 GEP and GAP were expressed in the transfected cells. An epitope tag (MYC) was attached to the N termini of Rab3 GEP and GAP (pCMV-MYC-Rab3 GEPΔC1; pEFBOS-MYC-Rab3 GAP) to detect the transfected cells. Immunocytochemical analyses of the transfected and untransfected cells using the anti-Rab3 GEP and GAP antibodies showed that the expression levels of both of the exogenous proteins were about 20–40 times as much as those of the endogenous proteins (Fig. 5). We furthermore confirmed whether GH and a sample to be tested were co-expressed in the same cells. A plasmid encoding Rab3 GEP, GAP, or each mutant was co-transfected with a plasmid encoding human GH (pXGH5) into PC12 cells. A MYC tag was attached to the N termini of these proteins to detect them in the cells. When MYC-tagged proteins and GH were analyzed by immunocytochemistry using each antibody, both the proteins were detected in the same cells (Fig. 6). About 80% of the GH-expressing cells expressed MYC-tagged proteins. Only full-length Rab3 GEP (pCMV-MYC-Rab3 GEP) and the deletion mutant containing the middle portion of Rab3 GAP (pEFBOS-MYC-Rab3 GAP-M) showed very low expression levels (data not shown), but the expression levels of other proteins were found to be similar (Fig. 6).Figure 6Co-expression of GH and Rab3 GEP, GAP, or their mutants in PC12 cells and their expression levels.

Consistently, we have shown here that Rab3 GEP and GAP are enriched in the synaptic soluble fraction of rat brain. Moreover, in primary cultured hippocampal neurons, Rab3 GEP and GAP are localized at the synaptic release sites. These results indicate that Rab3 GEP and GAP are colocalized with Rab3A at the synaptic release sites and suggest that they regulate the activity of Rab3A and play a role in neurotransmitter release. To obtain evidence supporting this role of Rab3 GEP and GAP, we have taken advantage of the GH co-expression assay system of PC12 cells. By use of this assay system, we have shown here that overexpression of the Rab3 GEP deletion mutant possessing the catalytic activity, but not overexpression of the deletion mutants of Rab3 GEP lacking the catalytic activity, inhibits Ca2+-dependent release of GH. Several previous works have shown that the dominant active mutants of Rab3A, Rab3AN135I and Rab3AQ81L, inhibit Ca2+-dependent exocytosis from PC12 cells and chromaffin cells (16Holz R.W. Brondyk W.H. Senter R.A. Kuizon L. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10229-10234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Johannes L. Lledo P.M. Roa M. Vincent J.D. Henry J.P. Darchen F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2029-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Rab3AN135I has a very high dissociation rate for GDP and GTP, and by analogy with the equivalent Ras mutant, Rab3AN135I may be predominantly the GTP-bound form in the cell (31Brondyk W.H. McKiernan C.J. Burstein E.S. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9410-9415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rab3AQ81L has low GTPase activity and should stabilize the GTP-bound form (31Brondyk W.H. McKiernan C.J. Burstein E.S. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9410-9415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rab3 GEP may show the same effect on the GDP/GTP cycle of Rab3A and accumulate the GTP-bound form in the cell the same as that of these dominant active mutants. The reason why the effect of overexpressed Rab3 GEP was slightly weaker than that of overexpressed Rab3AQ81L might be because overexpressed Rab3 GEP accumulated the GTP-bound form to a lesser extent. Taken together, the present results suggest that Rab3 GEP is involved in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis by regulating the GDP/GTP exchange reaction of Rab3A. It is currently unknown how the accumulation of the GTP-bound form of Rab3A inhibits Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, but it is likely that the GDP/GTP cycle of Rab3A is essential for the function of Rab3A in the docking and fusion processes (5Takai Y. Sasaki T. Shirataki H. Nakanishi H. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 615-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 9Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 519-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the GTP-bound form of Rab3A is associated with synaptic vesicles through interaction with rabphilin3 (32Shirataki H. Yamamoto T. Hagi S. Miura H. Oishi H. Jin-no Y. Senbonmatsu T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32717-32720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although other groups have shown that Rab3A is associated with synaptic vesicles in a manner independent of rabphilin3 (33Li C.

Rabphilin3 is one of the Rab3 downstream targets that are involved in the docking and/or fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane (17Chung S.-H. Takai Y. Holz R.W. J. Biol.

We have shown that Rab3 GAP is not active on the GTP-bound form of Rab3A that is complexed with rabphilin3 (37Kishida S. Shirataki H. Sasaki T. Kato M. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22259-22261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown here that overexpression of full-length Rab3 GAP or its deletion mutant containing the catalytic domain does not affect Ca2+-dependent release of GH from PC12 cells, in contrast to the action of Rab3 GEP, under the conditions where the expression levels of Rab3 GEP and GAP were similar. This reason is likely that overexpressed Rab3 GAP or its catalytic domain does not act on the GTP-bound form of Rab3A associated with rabphilin3 in PC12 cells. It is likely that the inhibitory effect of rabphilin3 on Rab3 GAP is released by some modifications of Rab3A, rabphilin3, and/or Rab3 GAP, or another factor. It is currently unknown at which stage of the neurotransmitter release processes Rab3 GAP shows its activity, but Rab3 GAP should not be activated at least until Rab3A accomplishes its function in the docking and fusion processes. It is important to clarify at which stage of the neurotransmitter release processes Rab3 GAP shows its activity and how Rab3 GAP is activated at that stage."
https://openalex.org/W2082710199,"A previous study on the gene structure of rat pyruvate carboxylase revealed that two tissue-specific promoters are responsible for the production of multiple transcripts with 5′-end heterogeneity (Jitrapakdee, S., Booker, G. W., Cassady, A. I., and Wallace, J. C. (1997) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 272, 20522–20530). Here we report transcription and translation regulation of pyruvate carboxylase (PC) expression during development and in genetically obese rats. The abundance of PC mRNAs was low in fetal liver but increased by 2–4-fold within 7 days after birth, concomitant with an 8-fold increase in the amount of immunoreactive PC and its activity and then decreased during the weaning period. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that the proximal promoter was activated during the suckling period and reduced in activity at weaning. In genetically obese Zucker rats, adipose PC was 4–5-fold increased, concomitant with a 5–6-fold increase in mRNA level. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis also showed that the proximal promoter was activated in the hyperlipogenic condition. Conversely, transcription of the proximal promoter was not detectable in various liver cell lines, suggesting that this promoter was not functional under cell culture conditions. In rat pancreatic islets and insulinoma cells, only transcripts D and E, generated from the distal promoter of the PC gene, were expressed. Glucose increased PC transcripts from the distal promoter when the insulinoma cells were maintained in 10 mm glucose. We conclude that the proximal promoter of the rat PC gene plays a major role in gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis, whereas the distal promoter is necessary for anaplerosis.<i>In vitro</i> translation and <i>in vivo</i> polysome profile analysis indicated that transcripts C and E were translated with similar translational efficiencies that are substantially greater than that of transcript D, suggesting that 5′-untranslated regions play a role in translational control."

However, splice site choice is significantly influenced by the concentration of SR proteins in splicing assays using cellular extracts or overexpression systems (2Zahler A.M. Neugebauer K.M. Lane W.S. Roth M.B. Science. 1993; 260: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar,6Cáceres J. Stamm S. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.R.

Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), suggesting that the control of the local SR protein concentration in the nucleoplasm regulates alternative splicing. SR proteins are enriched in nuclear structures called speckles, to which some (SC35 and SRp20) are targeted by means of the SR domain (9Hedley M.L. Amrein H. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11524-11528Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 10Misteli T. Cáceres J.F. Spector D.L. Nature. 1997; 387: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Speckles are sensitive to kinase and phosphatase inhibitors, and their size responds dynamically to changes in transcriptional activity (10Misteli T. Cáceres J.F. Spector D.L. Nature. 1997; 387: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 11Bregman D.B. Du L. van der Zee S. Warren S. J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 975-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphorylation of splicing components was previously demonstrated to be crucial for the formation of spliceosomes, whereas subsequent dephosphorylation was necessary to complete catalysis (13Mermoud J.E. Cohen P.T.W. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5679-5688Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 14Tazi J. Kornstädt U. Rossi F. Jeanteur P. Cathala G. Brunel C. Lührmann R. Nature. 1993; 363: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that the reversible phosphorylation of speckle components, i.e. SR proteins, controls their release into the nucleoplasm, and the resulting changes in local SR protein concentrations then regulate alternative splicing (10Misteli T. Cáceres J.F. Spector D.L. Nature. 1997; 387: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). A number of SR protein kinases have been described, including a U1 70-kDa associated kinase (15Woppmann A. Will C.L. Kornstadt U. Zuo P. Manley J.L. Lührmann R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2815-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), SRPK1 (16Gui J.-F. Lane W.S. Fu X.-D.

Cathala G. Brunel C. Tazi J. Nature. 1996; 381: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Recently, a member of a family of kinases termed CLK (CDC2-likekinases) or LAMMER kinases was shown to phosphorylate ASF/SF2 in vitro (20Colwill K. Pawson T. Andrews B. Prasad J. Manley J.L. Bell J.C. Duncan P.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 21Colwill K. Feng L.L. Yeakley J.M. Gish G.D. Cáceres J.F. Pawson T. Fu X.-D. J. Biol.

Stamm S. Ullrich A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). CLK proteins contain an SR domain and autophosphorylate on tyrosine, serine, and threonine residues in overexpression systems and in vitro(22Nayler O. Stamm S. Ullrich A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 23Ben-David Y. Letwin K. Tannock L. Bernstein A. Pawson T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27299-27303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). When overexpressed, the catalytically inactive mutant kinases localize to nuclear speckles, whereas the wild-type enzymes distribute throughout the nucleus and cause speckles to dissolve (20Colwill K. Pawson T. Andrews B. Prasad J. Manley J.L. Bell J.C. Duncan P.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). This has led to the current model that CLK family members may regulate SR protein activity and consequently splicing (10Misteli T. Cáceres J.F. Spector D.L. Nature. 1997; 387: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Further support was provided in a recent report that demonstrated the influence of overexpressed CLK1/STY, human CLK2, and human CLK3 on the splicing pattern of an E1A minigene construct (26Duncan P.I. Stojdl D.F. Marius R.M. Bell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5996-6001Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 27Duncan P.J. Stojdl D.F. Marius R.M. Scheit K.H. Bell J.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We have now investigated endogenous CLK2 in Friend murine erythroleukemic cells (F-MEL) and compared some of its properties with previous reports on the overexpressed CLK kinases. Here we demonstrate that endogenous CLK2 is submaximally phosphorylated under physiological conditions and that it is associated with other nuclear proteins. Furthermore, in contrast to the overexpressed protein, endogenous CLK2 displayed undetectable tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo. CLK2 phosphorylation levels were sensitive to okadaic acid and 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) treatment, and our data suggest that CLK2 may be regulated by a number of kinases and phosphatases. Concomitant with decreased phosphorylation levels induced by DRB, we observed that CLK2 and SR proteins translocated from the nucleoplasm to enlarged speckles, and we show that DRB inhibits CLK2 autophosphorylation in vivo. All CLK protein family members contain a highly conserved serine residue within an alternatively spliced exon (22Nayler O. Stamm S. Ullrich A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 26Duncan P.I. Stojdl D.F. Marius R.M. Bell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5996-6001Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 28Hanes J. von der Kammer H. Klaudiny J. Scheit K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We identified this residue as a CLK2 autophosphorylation site (Ser-141) using in vitrokinase assays and demonstrate by site-directed mutagenesis that it participates in the control of CLK2 subnuclear localization. Together, our data suggest that the nuclear localization of CLK2 is regulated in a combined mechanism by an interplay of kinases and phosphatases in conjunction with CLK2 autophosphorylation. This process might thereby influence the interaction of CLK2 with its substrates, the SR proteins, leading to a change in alternative splicing. F-MEL cells were grown in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% fetal calf serum, and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were seeded at 2 × 105/ml (20 ml) and grown for 24 h before treatment and subsequent lysis. Okadaic acid (BIOMOL Research Laboratories Inc.) was dissolved in Me2SO and used at various concentrations for 12–24 h as indicated. Sodium orthovanadate was used at 50 μm for 24 h or at 1 mm for 1 h. Cells were arrested at the G2/M phase with 158 nm demecolcine (Sigma) for 9.5 h or were differentiated in 2% Me2SO for 6 days (29Huet X. Plet A. Vié A. Blanchard J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3789-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). DRB (BIOMOL Research Laboratories Inc.) was used for 1–2 h (12Gama-Carvalho M. Krauss R.D. Chiang L. Valcárcel J. Green M.R. Carmo-Fonseca M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 975-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Actinomycin D (Sigma) was used at the indicated concentrations for 1–4 h. Quercetin (Sigma) was used at the indicated concentrations for 1–2 h. Cells (1 × 107) were centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min and lysed on ice for 30 min in 200 μl of HNTG buffer and 1% Triton X-100 (22Nayler O. Stamm S. Ullrich A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) or in 200 μl of RIPA lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, and freshly added 4 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 units/ml benzonase unless otherwise stated). Lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge for 15 min or 20 min at 100,000 ×g in a Beckman TLA-100 centrifuge (HNTG buffer and RIPA lysis buffer without benzonase). The supernatants were diluted 4-fold in HNTG buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 mm NaF, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin) and 0.1% Triton X-100 (HNTG lysis) or in RIPA rescue buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 1 mm NaF, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm NaCl, and freshly added 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin). Immunoprecipitations were carried out using anti-CLK2 antibodies (22Nayler O. Stamm S. Ullrich A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and protein A-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in HNTG buffer and 0.1% Triton X-100 and resuspended in 30 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. The samples were analyzed using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting as described (22Nayler O. Stamm S. Ullrich A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). GST-CLK2 was expressed in yeast and purified using GSH-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). CLK2 mutagenesis was carried out as described previously (22Nayler O. Stamm S. Ullrich A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A fragment corresponding to the alternatively spliced exon EB (26Duncan P.I. Stojdl D.F. Marius R.M. Bell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5996-6001Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 28Hanes J. von der Kammer H. Klaudiny J. Scheit K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from CLK2, CLK2-S141A, or CLK2-S141E using the EB sense (CGC GAA TTC AGC AGC CGG AGA GCC AAG) and EB antisense (CGC GGA TCC ATA TCG CTC TTG TAG CCA) primers and cloned into a pGEX vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting GST-EB-wt, GST-EB-S141A, and GST-EB-S141E fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using GSH-Sepharose beads. 1 μg of fusion protein and 100 ng of GST-CLK2 were used in in vitro kinase assays as described (22Nayler O. Stamm S. Ullrich A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were grown on gelatin-coated coverslips and transfected using 100 ng of plasmid DNA encoding N-terminal green fluorescent protein-CLK2, CLK2KR, CLK2-S141A, or CLK2-S141E fusion constructs (enhanced GFP-C2,CLONTECH) as described (22Nayler O. Stamm S. Ullrich A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, the cells were incubated with 75 μm DRB for 1 h, washed once in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then treated with 0.5% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min on ice. Coverslips were mounted in Gelmount (Dianova). EGFP-ASF/SF2 and EGFP-SC35 constructs were used to generate stable HEK 293 cell lines. Cells were grown, fixed, and prepared for microscopy as described above. Immunofluorescence was performed using confocal scanning microscopy (Leica). We (22Nayler O. Stamm S. Ullrich A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and others (20Colwill K. Pawson T. Andrews B. Prasad J. Manley J.L. Bell J.C. Duncan P.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) have previously investigated CLK proteins in overexpression systems such as HEK 293 and COS-7 cell lines. There, the kinases were largely found in the soluble fraction of a Triton X-100-based cell lysis buffer, whereas the catalytically inactive mutant kinases were found almost exclusively in the pellet. Furthermore, the overexpressed CLK kinases were autophosphorylated on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues (23Ben-David Y. Letwin K. Tannock L. Bernstein A. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 24Howell B.W. Afar D.E.H. Lew J. Douville E.M.J. Icely P.L.E. Gray D.A. Bell J.C. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21524-21531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To investigate the regulation of CLK2 under more physiological conditions, we chose F-MEL cells. These cells express sufficient amounts of endogenous CLK2 protein (22Nayler O. Stamm S. Ullrich A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) to reevaluate and extend previous overexpression results. To investigate the solubility of endogenous CLK2 protein, equal amounts of F-MEL cells were lysed in HNTG or RIPA buffer, and CLK2 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-CLK2 antibodies. As shown in Fig.1 A, a reduced solubility of endogenous CLK2 was observed in HNTG buffer compared with the harsher RIPA lysis buffer, and only trace amounts of CLK2 were detectable in the pellet fraction following RIPA lysis. Control experiments using recombinant GST-CLK2 revealed no differences in the efficacy of immunoprecipitations between both buffers (data not shown). This reduced solubility of endogenous CLK2 in a Triton X-100-based buffer contradicts the previously described solubility of overexpressed CLK2 or CLK1/STY (20Colwill K. Pawson T. Andrews B. Prasad J. Manley J.L. Bell J.C. Duncan P.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 22Nayler O. Stamm S. Ullrich A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and suggests that a significant amount of CLK2 is associated with other nuclear proteins that are not easily solubilized. Based on these initial experiments, RIPA lysis was employed, although we included benzonase in our standard lysis protocol as it facilitated sample handling. It was recently proposed that CLK proteins could be targets of regulatory kinases influencing their catalytic activity, localization, or substrate affinity (26Duncan P.I. Stojdl D.F. Marius R.M. Bell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5996-6001Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To test this, we treated F-MEL cells with the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid and observed a dose-dependent increase in the molecular mass of immunoprecipitated CLK2 (Fig. 1 B). As phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of proteins is often visualized by a change of apparent molecular mass following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, our results indicated that endogenous CLK2 was submaximally phosphorylated and could be a potential substrate of other kinases. Since okadaic acid can arrest cells at the G2/M phase (31Jaramillo-Babb V.L. Sugarman J.L. Scavetta R. Wang S.-J. Berndt N. Born T.L. Glass C.K. Schönthal A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5988-5992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we investigated cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of CLK2 and compared CLK2 molecular mass shifts from okadaic acid-, sodium orthovanadate-, okadaic acid/sodium orthovanadate-treated and cell cycle-arrested cells. Cells were arrested at the G2/M phase using demecolcine or were arrested in G0 following differentiation for 6 days in 2% Me2SO (29Huet X. Plet A. Vié A. Blanchard J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3789-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 C, a clear increase in molecular mass was observed following okadaic acid treatment, but neither differentiated nor G2/M phase arrested cells showed any visible change in CLK2 mobility. It is noteworthy that the amount of protein was drastically reduced in okadaic acid-treated or differentiated cells and slightly reduced in demecolcine-arrested cells. This suggests that CLK2 is engaged in actively proliferating but not quiescent cells and that CLK2 is not specifically activated during G2/M phase. Overexpressed CLK2 autophosphorylates on tyrosine residues in sodium orthovanadate-treated cells (22Nayler O. Stamm S. Ullrich A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when CLK2 is expressed in yeast and purified, it autophosphorylates on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues in vitro (data not shown). These observations suggested that several CLK2 characteristics resemble the properties described for CLK1/STY (23Ben-David Y. Letwin K. Tannock L. Bernstein A. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 24Howell B.W. Afar D.E.H. Lew J. Douville E.M.J. Icely P.L.E. Gray D.A. Bell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 25Lee K. Du C. Horn M. Rabinow L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27299-27303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 30Duncan P.I. Howell B.W. Marius R.M. Drmanic S. Douville E.M.J. Bell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21524-21531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We therefore assumed that endogenous CLK2 tyrosine phosphorylation could serve as a marker for autophosphorylation. However, when F-MEL cells were incubated with okadaic acid, sodium orthovanadate, or both, no CLK2 tyrosine phosphorylation signal was observed in Western blot experiments using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, even after prolonged ECL exposure (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, usingin vivo labeling experiments with [32P]orthophosphate and phosphoamino acid analysis of immunoprecipitated CLK2, we could not detect an increased tyrosine phosphorylation signal following sodium orthovanadate treatment (data not shown). To investigate whether CLK2 had lost its capability of tyrosine autophosphorylation, CLK2 was immunoprecipitated from F-MEL cells, and in vitro kinase assays were performed in the presence or absence of ATP followed by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 B, CLK2 was considerably shifted in molecular mass and was heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated in the presence of ATP. The tyrosine phosphorylation signal was evident after a few seconds of exposure despite the low amounts of CLK2 used in this experiment. This indicates that CLK2 may not be tyrosine-phosphorylated in vivo, although its autophosphorylation capability is not impaired. Furthermore, the strong shift in molecular mass seen after an in vitro phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated CLK2 supports our view that endogenous CLK2 is hypophosphorylated in vivo. To assess the existence of CLK2 kinases, we incubated F-MEL cells with a variety of known kinase inhibitors and examined the effects on the molecular mass of immunoprecipitated CLK2. The kinase inhibitor DRB, which was previously shown to inhibit casein kinase II (32Zandomeni R. Zandomeni M.C. Shugar D. Weinmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), tightened the CLK2 signal and shifted it to a lower molecular mass in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 A), corresponding to a decrease in the CLK2 phosphorylation level. Since DRB also inhibits transcriptional activity (11Bregman D.B. Du L. van der Zee S. Warren S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), we tested a different transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D, at various concentrations. This treatment did not lead to an equivalent shift in the molecular mass of CLK2 (Fig.3 A), suggesting that the observed effects of DRB were directly linked to a kinase inhibition. We next addressed whether the DRB-inhibited kinase was responsible for the hyperphosphorylation of CLK2 alone and incubated cells with okadaic acid in the presence of DRB. However, the okadaic acid-induced shift in the molecular mass of CLK2 was not fully inhibited by DRB (Fig. 3 B), indicating that other CLK2 kinases or CLK2 autophosphorylation was still active. The inhibition of CLK2 phosphorylation by DRB was fully reversible, as CLK2 regained its normal phosphorylation status within 1.5 h after washing out the inhibitor (data not shown). To examine whether the DRB-induced decrease in phosphorylation was due to the inhibition of CLK2 autophosphorylation, we performed in vivo assays using overexpressed GFP-CLK2 in HEK 293 cells. As it was previously shown that overexpressed CLK2 autophosphorylates on tyrosine residues in the presence of orthovanadate (22Nayler O. Stamm S. Ullrich A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we treated the cells with DRB, orthovanadate, or both. Following immunoprecipitation of CLK2, we analyzed tyrosine phosphorylation using Western blotting and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Fig. 3 C shows that the tyrosine-autophosphorylating activity of CLK2 was significantly reduced by DRB. Furthermore, the tyrosine phosphorylation signal was completely abolished when the cells were pretreated with DRB for 1 h and then incubated with orthovanadate/DRB as described above (data not shown). In addition, GST-CLK2 was also inhibited by 75 μm DRB (data not shown) using previously described in vitro assay conditions (32Zandomeni R. Zandomeni M.C. Shugar D. Weinmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that DRB directly inhibits the autophosphorylation activity of CLK2 in vivo, thereby inducing the observed reduction in the molecular mass of the CLK2 protein. Furthermore, since DRB only partially reduced the observed increase in molecular mass after okadaic acid treatment (see above), we assume that other CLK2 kinases remained active. Recent reports suggested that CLK proteins are regulated by phosphorylation and alternative splicing, and it emerged that all CLK family members contain a conserved, alternatively spliced exon previously termed exon EB (30Duncan P.I. Howell B.W. Marius R.M. Drmanic S. Douville E.M.J. Bell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21524-21531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Omission of exon EB creates a frameshift and causes the expression of truncated, catalytically inactive proteins (28Hanes J. von der Kammer H. Klaudiny J. Scheit K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was recently shown that exon EB splicing of the clk1/sty gene is autoregulated by CLK1 (26Duncan P.I. Stojdl D.F. Marius R.M. Bell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5996-6001Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all CLK family members contain a highly conserved serine residue in exon EB (22Nayler O. Stamm S. Ullrich A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 28Hanes J. von der Kammer H. Klaudiny J. Scheit K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).

First, we mutated serine 141 in CLK2 to alanine (S141A) or glutamate (S141E) and created GST-EB domain fusion proteins, which we used in in vitro kinase assays with GST-CLK2. In these experiments, strong phosphorylation of GST-EB-wt, but not of GST-EB-S141A or GST-EB-S141E (Fig.3 D), was observed, which suggests that Ser-141 of CLK2 is an autophosphorylation site.

However, the distinctive DNA recognition properties of the six major POU subclasses have not been well defined. Here, we have used random oligonucleotide selection and competitive binding assays to determine the optimal DNA recognition elements for the POU-III and POU-VI protein classes, represented by Brn-2 and Brn-5, respectively. The optimal Brn-5 consensus binding sequence GCATAA(T/A)TTAT strongly resembles that previously determined for the POU-IV (Brn-3) class, whereas Brn-2 exhibits highest affinity for non-octamer sites of the form ATG(A/C)AT(A/T)0–2ATTNAT and for octamer sites that contain a full associated heptamer sequence.

The POU-domain transcription factors are a class of homeodomain proteins that interact with DNA via a two-part binding domain, consisting of a POU homeodomain and a POU-specific domain (1Herr W. Cleary M.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). POU proteins have been identified as developmental regulators in diverse invertebrate species, and in mammals they have important roles in the development of the immune, endocrine, and nervous systems (2Ryan A.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes and Dev. 1997; 11: 1207-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Based entirely on structural homology, the POU-domain factors have been divided into six distinct subclasses. In vertebrates, proteins of the POU-III, POU-IV, and POU-VI classes are expressed predominantly in the nervous system. The POU-III class proteins Brn-1, Brn-2, and Brn-4 are expressed in specific hypothalamic nuclei and also in the neocortex (3Alvarez-Bolado G. Rosenfeld M.G. Swanson L.W. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 355: 237-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), whereas SCIP/Tst-1/Oct-6 has a unique role in differentiation of myelinating glia and is also expressed in the neocortex (4Frantz G.D. Bohner A.P. Akers R.M. McConnell S.K. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 472-485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the POU-IV class proteins Brn-3.0, Brn-3.1, and Brn-3.2 is confined almost entirely to the caudal CNS1and sensory system (5Fedtsova N. Turner E.E. Mech. Dev. 1995; 53: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Brn-5 (also known as emb and CNS-1) is significantly diverged from neural POU proteins of the POU-III and POU-IV classes and has been assigned to a separate structural category (POU-VI). Brn-5 is expressed widely in the developing mammalian CNS and has a somewhat lamina-specific pattern in the mature cerebral cortex (6Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Pearse II, R.V. Jenne K. Sugarman J.

It is not currently known whether these proteins play similar regulatory roles in their respective brain regions or instead have distinct transcriptional functions conferred by different DNA binding properties between POU classes or by other unique features of the individual factors. We have previously demonstrated that within the POU-IV class, DNA recognition is highly conserved, and the nearly identical DNA binding domains of the POU-III proteins suggest that DNA recognition will also be conserved within this class. Crystallographic data for the non-neural POU proteins Oct-1 and Pit-1 have shown quite distinct conformations of these proteins on DNA (9Klemm J.D. Rould M.A. Aurora R. Herr W. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1994; 77: 21-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar,10Jacobsen E.M. Li P. Leon-del-Rio A. Rosenfeld M.G. Aggarwal A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 198-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, the distinct structures obtained may be partly due to the very different DNA sequences used for co-crystallization in these studies. In both of these crystal structures and in several NMR studies of POU-DNA interaction (11Dekker N. Cox M. Boelens R. Verrijzer C.P. van der Vliet P.C. Kaptein R. Nature. 1993; 362: 852-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 12Assa-Munt N. Mortishire-Smith R.J. Aurora R. Herr W. Wright P.E.

Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9845-9855Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the amino acids that form the principal DNA contacts are highly conserved throughout the POU family. This suggests that differences in specificity between POU subtypes may result from distinct spacing or orientation of the two tethered POU subdomains, rather than from distinct amino acid-DNA contacts (14Klemm J.D. Pabo C.O. Genes Dev. 1995; 10: 27-36Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar,15van Leeuwen H.C. Strating M.J. Rensen M. de Laat W. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2043-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Random oligonucleotide selection has been used to show that the Oct-1 POU domain recognizes a sequence with an octamer (ATGCAAAT) core, but with strong preferences for certain flanking bases (16Verrijzer C.P. Alkema M.J. vanWeperen W.W. vanLeeuwen H.C. Strating M.J. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4993-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 17Pomerantz J.L. Sharp P.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 36: 10851-10858Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Some progress has been made in determining the DNA recognition properties of the other POU subclasses, but among the POU proteins expressed predominantly in the nervous system, only members of the Brn-3 family have been examined in detail (18Turner E.E. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15097-15101Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 19Gruber C.A. Rhee J.M. Gleiberman A. Turner E.E. Mol. Cell Bio. 1997; 17: 2391-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recently we have shown that the optimal recognition sequence for the POU-IV (Brn-3) class proteins is a highly conserved non-octamer GCATAATTAAT motif (19Gruber C.A. Rhee J.M. Gleiberman A. Turner E.E. Mol. Cell Bio. 1997; 17: 2391-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Here, we show that, like the POU-IV class, the neural POU proteins Brn-2 and Brn-5 show high affinity for distinctive non-octamer recognition sites. On the consensus non-octamer Brn-2 binding site, invertebrate and vertebrate proteins of the POU-III and POU-IV classes exhibit highly cooperative homodimerization, demonstrating that this property is conserved among the neural POU factors. These results suggest new models for DNA binding by neural POU proteins that are consistent with the known Oct-1 and Pit-1 structures and provide the first clear basis for the recognition of POU recognition elements in the regulatory sequences of neural genes. DNA fragments encoding the POU-domain of murine Brn-2, Brn-3.0 and Brn-5 and were generated by polymerase chain reaction from cDNA templates and ligated into a modified pGEX vector containing a FLAG epitope, as described previously for Brn-3.0 (19Gruber C.A. Rhee J.M. Gleiberman A. Turner E.E. Mol. Cell Bio. 1997; 17: 2391-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides for Brn-2, incorporating the FLAG epitope, were GCGCCGGAATTCTAGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGGTCGACGACGAGGACACGCCGACCTCA and GGCCAAGCTTTCACAGAGTCCCTCCGGGAGGGGT, and the oligonucleotides for Brn-5 were GCGCCGGTCGACGAGGACGGGATCAACTTAGAA and GGCCAAGCTTCTAGGGGATCTGAAAGACATT. The resulting constructs were fully sequenced prior to bacterial expression of the glutathioneS-transferase/POU-domain fusion proteins. The GST and FLAG-POU domains of the fusion proteins were separated by thrombin cleavage for all binding studies except the initial random oligonucleotide selection experiments. The Drosophila POU proteins drifter and tI-POU were expressed by in vitrotranslation as described previously (18Turner E.E. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15097-15101Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Full-length Brn-2 and Brn-3.0 proteins were prepared from whole cell extracts of CV-1 epithelial cells (20Scholer H.R. Hatzopoulos A.K. Balling R. Suzuki N. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2543-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) after calcium phosphate-mediated transfection with cDNA constructs contained in the vector pCDNA-1/amp. Random oligonucleotide selection with GST-POU-domain fusion protein was performed as described previously (19Gruber C.A. Rhee J.M. Gleiberman A. Turner E.E. Mol. Cell Bio. 1997; 17: 2391-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), except that an oligonucleotide containing an internal 24-base pair random sequence CCAGGCTCGAGGTCTCN24GTCGGCTCGAGGAGTCC was used, and eight rounds of selection were employed. The polymerase chain reaction primers for amplification of the selected sequences were CCAGGCTCGAGGTCCTC and GGACTCCTCGAGCCGAC. Following eight rounds of selection and amplification, the selected oligonucleotide pool was ligated into the vector pBKSII and transformed into bacteria, and individual colonies were selected for analysis. Inserts from the selected plasmid clones were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and assayed for their ability to compete for POU protein binding in electrophoretic mobility shift assays that were performed as described previously (19Gruber C.A. Rhee J.M. Gleiberman A. Turner E.E. Mol. Cell Bio. 1997; 17: 2391-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Each screening competition assay contained 1.25 × 10−9m32P-labeled IgG octamer-heptamer oligonucleotide (21Poellinger L. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 747-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), sufficient POU protein to gel-shift 10–20% of the labeled DNA, and 6.25 × 10−9m of competitor DNA consisting of the polymerase chain reaction product from one of the selected clones. Consensus binding sequences were derived only from the competitor sequences, which at least half-competed POU protein binding to the octamer-heptamer site. The relative affinity of oligonucleotides containing POU recognition sites was determined in EMSAs containing 5 × 10−11m of the appropriate POU protein, 1.25 × 10−9m32P-radiolabeled oligonucleotide, and a range of competitor oligonucleotide concentrations that yielded at least one value above and below the concentration of competitor required to half-compete binding of the labeled site (I 0.5). The full sequences of the b2s1 oligonucleotides were GATCTGGTCCGAGATGAATTATTCATGAGCCTGGG and GATCCCCAGGCTCATGAATAATTCATCTCGGACCA, with the underlined bases replaced by the variant sequences used, as shown in Fig. 3 B. The full sequences of the b3s1 oligonucleotides were GATCTCTCCTGCATAATTAATTACGCCCGGATC and GATCCGGGCGTAATTAATTATGCAGGAGAGATC. Affinities were determined relative to the Brn-2 and Brn-3.0 complexes with the oligonucleotides b2s1 and b3s1 respectively. Competition EMSAs were quantified on dried gels using a PhosphorImager (ImageQuant, Molecular Dynamics). To determine the optimal DNA recognition sequence for Brn-2, we employed random oligonucleotide selection with a GST-POU domain fusion protein, followed by affinity screening of individual selected sites. The random selection method and the importance of determining the relative affinity of the sites obtained from the random pool have been described in previous work (19Gruber C.A. Rhee J.M. Gleiberman A. Turner E.E. Mol. Cell Bio. 1997; 17: 2391-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The majority of the selected sites exhibited a very similar, novel core sequence that did not contain an octamer motif but instead conformed to the consensus ATG(A/C)AT(A/T)0–2ATTNAT (Fig.1). The preferred base at the N position is C; A and T were also observed at this location, but not G. If the site is considered as two nearly symmetrical half-sites (Fig.2, box), the usual number of A-T base pairs separating the half-sites was one, but zero and two were also observed. This highly conserved 12–14-base pair motif was frequently followed by GAG, although in several cases this was contributed by the invariant flanking sequence.Figure 2Brn-5 recognizes a non-octamer site. A GST-Brn-5 POU-domain fusion protein was used to affinity select oligonucleotides from a random pool. Individual cloned oligonucleotides were then affinity-screened in competition EMSAs as described for Brn-2 above and used to derive a consensus binding sequence. As shown, the Brn-5 consensus recognition sequence strongly resembles that derived for the Brn-3 protein class (19Gruber C.A. Rhee J.M. Gleiberman A. Turner E.E. Mol. Cell Bio. 1997; 17: 2391-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A minority of Brn-2 selected sites instead contained the variant octamer motif ATG(C/T)TAAT within an extended recognition site that was distinct from the non-octamer sites described above. Unlike the octamer element selected by Oct-1 (16Verrijzer C.P. Alkema M.J. vanWeperen W.W. vanLeeuwen H.C. Strating M.J. van der Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4993-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), T and C were found interchangeably in the third position of the Brn-2 octamer, and T, not A, was found exclusively in the fifth position. Also, the octamer element alone was not sufficient for optimal binding. In the octamer-containing sites selected by Brn-2, the octamer motif was always preceded by AT or TT, and the sequence ATGC or GCAT was found within 2–5 base pairs of the extended octamer motif in every Brn-2 selected sequence. The non-octamer Brn-2 consensus recognition site has several notable features. First, the site exhibits imperfect palindromic symmetry. Among the selected sites, the presence of a central A-T base pair usually gives the core recognition site an odd number of residues and thus prevents perfect symmetry, but some selected sites contain a complete 12-base pair palindrome (e.g. site 78). Second, the terminal part of the consensus sequence significantly resembles the heptamer motif, CTCATGA or TCATGAG found in the Oct-1/2 recognition sequences of IgH promoters. Third, the central core of the most frequent length variant of the Brn-2 consensus sequence, AT(T/A)ATTNAT, resembles the optimal binding site for the Brn-3 (POU-IV) protein class, which contains the core motif ATAATTAAT (19Gruber C.A. Rhee J.M. Gleiberman A. Turner E.E. Mol. Cell Bio. 1997; 17: 2391-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To determine the optimal DNA recognition site for Brn-5, we performed oligonucleotide selection and affinity screening with Brn-5 POU-domain protein as described for Brn-2 above. The selected oligonucleotides yielded the consensus sequence GCATAA(T/A)TTAT (Fig. 2). This sequence is very similar to the consensus recognition sequence previously derived for proteins of the Brn-3 class (GCATAA(T/A)TAAT) (19Gruber C.A. Rhee J.M. Gleiberman A. Turner E.E. Mol. Cell Bio. 1997; 17: 2391-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), with the possible exception of a Brn-5 preference for T over A at position 9, where the Brn-3 proteins prefer A but tolerate sequence variability. It has recently been suggested that GST fusions of DNA binding proteins may undergo GST-mediated dimerization, which for some Zn-finger transcription factors interferes with the analysis of DNA-binding specificity (22Lenouvel F. Nikolaev I. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15521-15526Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the present study, no evidence was found for GST-mediated dimerization of POU fusion proteins, and dimerization was only observed as a binding site-specific phenomenon. As shown in Fig.3 A, only single bands representing protein complexes with the monomeric binding site b3s1 were observed in EMSAs over a wide range of GST-Brn-2 concentrations, strongly suggesting exclusively monomeric binding. Monomeric binding is confirmed by the fact that GST-Brn-2 fusion protein (M r = 46 × 103) DNA complexes migrate slightly faster than Brn-2 holoprotein (M r = 44 × 103) or Brn-3 holoprotein (M r = 43 × 103) complexes, and much more slowly than DNA complexes with the Brn-2 POU domain alone (M r = 20 × 103). Although GST-mediated dimerization appears unlikely to be influencing DNA binding for these POU proteins, we have observed some effects of the GST moiety on site specificity. The most profound of these effects is impairment of DNA-dependent dimer formation, most likely due to conformational constraints. For these reasons, all subsequent DNA binding studies described here were performed either with thrombin-cleaved GST fusion proteins, with in vitrotranslated POU domain proteins lacking the GST moiety, or with native POU proteins expressed by transient transfection of cultured mammalian cells. To better understand the significance of the consensus Brn-2 recognition sequence (b2s1), we generated a series of specific variants of this site and determined the relative affinity of these variants based on the relative concentration of competitor oligonucleotide required to half-inhibit binding of Brn-2 POU domain protein to the consensus site (I 0.5, Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that Brn-2 has considerable flexibility in its conformation on DNA. Despite the near symmetry of the consensus site, alteration of the initial AT sequence (positions 1 and 2, b2s3) reduced affinity by only slightly, whereas disruption of the terminal GAG sequence (b2s2) lowered binding 9-fold, and changing the terminal AT residues (positions 12 and 13, b2s6) reduced affinity by over 50-fold, together indicating that the two nearly symmetrical halves of the consensus sequence are not equivalent. Alteration of the core residues of the weaker half-site (b2s5) resulted in a 5-fold loss of affinity. This shows that Brn-2 may interact with a single “half site,” but together with the oligonucleotide selection results, it also demonstrates that the full sequence is required for optimal affinity. Among the selected random sites, we observed variation in the number of A/T pairs separating the highly conserved near-palindromic sequences. For this reason, we systematically tested placement of 0, 1, 2, and 3 T residues between the conserved hexanucleotides (b2s1, b2s7, b2s8, and b2s9). Changing site length in this way had only a modest effect on affinity. To begin to assess differences in DNA site recognition by the POU-domain subclasses, we also examined the affinity of Brn-2 for variants of the octamer/heptamer element. The octamer/heptamer sequence used has been defined as a target of Oct-2 regulation in immunoglobulin gene promoters (21Poellinger L. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 747-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The affinity of Brn-2 for the full 17-base pair octamer/heptamer site was higher than its affinity for the non-octamer consensus Brn-2 site derived by random selection. The unusual length of this sequence may have prevented its selection from a random oligonucleotide pool, although several octamer/heptamer-like sequences were obtained. Alteration of the heptamer element with the preservation of an extended octamer, or “decamer,” motif (ATATGCTAAT, o2s4) resulted in a moderate (10-fold) decrease in Brn-2 affinity, but a minimal octamer sequence (o2s5) bound very poorly. Fundamental differences in the mode of Brn-2 and Oct-1/2 interaction with the octamer/heptamer site are revealed by alteration of the AT residues at positions 7 and 8 of the octamer motif (o2s7). These residues constitute the principal POU homeodomain DNA contacts in structural studies of Oct-1 and Oct-2 and are essential for high affinity Oct-2 binding. However, alteration of these bases had minimal effect on Brn-2 affinity, suggesting that Brn-2 may be able to interact with this site in a fundamentally different way. The basis of site discrimination by Brn-2 and Oct-1/2 is revealed by alignment of the opposite strand of the octamer/heptamer site and the shortest length variant of the Brn-2 site (b2s7), as shown in Fig.3 C. This alignment shows that the complex octamer/heptamer site contains an excellent match for site b2s7. This Brn-2 recognition element within the octamer/heptamer site does not include the A and T residues at positions 7 and 8 of the octamer sequence, which are required for high affinity binding by Oct-1/2 (but not by Brn-2). The other two bases in the octamer/heptamer sequence that deviate from b2s7 occur at octamer positions 3 and 6, which were variable among the Brn-2 selected oligonucleotides. Thus Brn-2 does not require an intact octamer element for high affinity binding to the complex octamer/heptamer site, and must be able to recognize this complex site both in a way analogous to Oct-1/2 (based on its affinity for the decamer site o2s4), and also in an alternative conformation. As expected based on the resemblance between the central bases of the Brn-2 consensus site and the optimal Brn-3 binding site, Brn-2 had high but not optimal affinity for the Brn-3 consensus (b3s1, Fig.3 B). Brn-2 also showed suboptimal but significant affinity for a related site (b2s11), which was previously proposed as a consensus Brn-2/Brn-3 recognition element (23Li P. He X. Gerrero M.R. Mok M. Aggarwal A. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2483-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) but that was subsequently shown to bind Brn-3.0 poorly (19Gruber C.A. Rhee J.M. Gleiberman A. Turner E.E. Mol. Cell Bio. 1997; 17: 2391-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A model for site discrimination by the POU subclasses incorporating the octamer and non-octamer binding data is presented in the discussion. One of the most notable features of the optimal Brn-2 binding site is that it exhibits (imperfect) palindromic symmetry, consisting of an inverted repeat of the sequence ATG(A/C)AT. Repeated or symmetrical DNA elements in transcription factor binding sites are often associated with dimeric binding, and for this reason we wished to examine the stoichiometry of Brn-2 binding to its optimal site and variations of this site. Homodimerization has been reported for some POU proteins, including Pit-1 and Brn-4 on certain sites, but most known POU-DNA interactions are monomeric. The Brn-2 POU domain dimerizes avidly on its optimal recognition site (b2s1, Fig. 4 A), and examination of the stoichiometry of Brn-2 POU-domain binding to several key variant sites revealed the critical features of the consensus Brn-2 site with respect to dimerization. Alteration of the terminal GAG residues at position 14–16 of the consensus site did not impair dimer formation (b2s2, Fig. 4 A). Alteration of the initial AT residues at position 1–2, however, completely eliminated dimer formation, although this change had little effect on binding affinity (Fig. 3 B). The importance of the initial AT residues is confirmed by the failure of Brn-2 to dimerize on the consensus Brn-3.0 recognition site (b3s1), which lacks this initial AT sequence, although the Brn-2 POU-domain monomer also binds b3s1 with high affinity. Alteration of site length also affected dimerization. Separation of the two near-palindromic ATG(A/C)AT elements by zero or one T residues allowed avid dimerization (b2s7 and b2s1, Fig. 4 A). Separation by two T residues (b2s8) impaired dimerization, and three intervening T residues (b2s9) eliminated it. These results could be interpreted to mean that various “spacing” distances between the two nearly symmetrical halves of the consensus site, each occupied by a Brn-2 monomer, may allow or disallow dimerization. However, this model may not be correct, because GST-Brn-2 POU domain fusion protein, which binds only as a monomer, requires the extended ∼16-base pair sequence in b2s1 for optimal affinity (data not shown). This strongly suggests that the two Brn-2 recognition sites in the dimeric complex must significantly overlap. Under “Discussion,” we incorporate these considerations into a model for Brn-2 dimerization. Because the Brn-2 POU domain dimerizes avidly and the GST-POU domain fusion protein does not, it was important to assess the dimerization properties of the native Brn-2 protein, of which only about 40% consists of the POU domain. For these experiments, the full coding sequence of Brn-2 was introduced by transfection into CV-1 cells, and lysates of the transfected cells were used as a source of Brn-2 protein (see under “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig.4 B, Brn-2 holoprotein exhibits avid dimerization on its consensus binding site, and its dimerization properties on several variants of this site corresponded well with the dimerization characteristics of the isolated POU domain. The binding of Brn-2 to its non-octamer consensus site is suggestive of highly cooperative dimerization. This can be observed in the titration of Brn-2 protein on its consensus site in Fig. 4, A andB, in which a significant amount of dimeric complex appears when overall site occupancy is still low. In the cooperative binding of two monomeric proteins to a DNA site, the affinity of the protein for the second site is increased by the occupancy of the first. If there is no cooperativity of binding, occupancy of the second site should occur without regard to whether the first site is occupied. When site occupancy is analyzed by EMSA, the data reveal either free DNA probe, or a monomeric or dimeric protein-DNA complex. In the monomeric complex, it is only possible to determine that exactly one site is occupied, and not which site, because monomeric occupancy of either the first or second site produces a complex with very similar migration properties. If the two monomeric complexes cannot be distinguished by electrophoresis, and the two sites are different in sequence and affinity, it is not possible to quantitate precisely the effect occupancy of one site has on the other. In some cases, variant oligonucleotides in which the first or second site has been specifically altered may allow determination of the individual affinities of the half-sites, and provide a solution to this problem. However, if the sites are overlapping in sequence, as appears to be the case in the dimeric binding of Brn-2 to its consensus site, the alteration of one site will affect the sequence of the other, and determination of the affinity of the protein for separate “half sites” cannot provide a solution. To demonstrate conclusively the cooperativity of Brn-2 homodimerization, we designed a completely symmetrical (palindromic) DNA recognition element that was related as closely as possible to the consensus DNA sequence (b2s10, Fig.5 A). Analysis of DNA binding to this symmetrical site can be simplified by the assumption that the two monomer complexes are identical and do not need to be specifically identified in the EMSA. The overall fraction of site occupancy can be determined from the fraction of oligonucleotide in the dimeric complex, plus one-half of the fraction of the oligonucleotide in the monomeric complex. If there is no positive or negative cooperativity of binding, the ratio of the oligonucleotide that appears as free site, monomeric complex, and dimeric complex can be predicted from the overall fraction of site occupancy (s) according to the following equations: fraction of dimer complex = s 2; fraction of free site = (1 − s)2; fraction of monomer complex = 1 − dimer − free = 1−s 2 − (1 − s)2 = 2s − 2s 2. For example, if the overall site occupan"

After degradation of these compounds in lysosomes, the free monosaccharides are released from the lysosome by a specific membrane transport system. This transport system is deficient in the human hereditary lysosomal sialic acid storage diseases (Salla disease and infantile sialic acid storage disease, OMIM 269920). The lysosomal sialic acid transporter from rat liver has now been purified to apparent homogeneity in a reconstitutively active form by a combination of hydroxyapatite, lectin, and ion exchange chromatography. A 57-kDa protein correlated with transport activity. The transporter recognized structurally different types of acidic monosaccharides, like sialic acid, glucuronic acid, and iduronic acid. Transport of glucuronic acid was inhibited by a number of aliphatic monocarboxylates (i.e. lactate, pyruvate, and valproate), substituted monocarboxylates, and several dicarboxylates.cis-Inhibition, trans-stimulation, and competitive inhibition experiments with radiolabeled glucuronic acid as well as radiolabeled l-lactate demonstrated thatl-lactate is transported by the lysosomal sialic acid transporter. l-Lactate transport was proton gradient-dependent, saturable with a K mof 0.4 mm, and mediated by a single mechanism. These data show striking biochemical and structural similarities of the lysosomal sialic acid transporter with the known monocarboxylate transporters of the plasma membrane (MCT1, MCT2, MCT3, and Mev).

The major function of lysosomes is the degradation of a large variety of intra- and extracellular macromolecules. The release of degradation products from the lysosome is accomplished by specific membrane transport systems. More than 20 lysosomal transporters have been characterized for specific solutes like amino acids, sugars, nucleosides, ions, and vitamins (1Pisoni R.L. Thoene J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 351-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Their fundamental role in biology is illustrated by the occurrence of two human inherited diseases with a defective lysosomal transport function, cystinosis and sialic acid storage diseases (2Gahl W.A. Schneider J.A. Aula P.P. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 3763-3797Google Scholar). Sialic acid storage diseases are autosomal recessive disorders that are characterized by mental retardation and a variable degree of neurodegeneration. Lysosomal accumulation and excessive urinary excretion of free sialic acid are pathognomonic findings. Previously, we have characterized a carrier in the lysosomal membrane with substrate specificity for the acidic monosaccharides sialic acid (Neu5Ac)1, uronic acids, and aldonic acids (3Mancini G.M.S. de Jonge H.R. Galjaard H. Verheijen F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15247-15254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies in our laboratory showed that a defective transport of sialic and glucuronic acid (GlcA) is the primary defect in both clinical variants (4Mancini G.M.S. Beerens C.E.M.T. Aula P.P. Verheijen F.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), Salla disease and infantile sialic acid storage disease. Recently, the gene for these disorders has been localized to the same refined chromosomal area on 6q14-q15 by linkage disequilibrium analysis (5Schleutker J. Leppänen P. Månsson J.E. Erikson A. Weissenbach J. Peltonen L. Aula P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 893-901PubMed Google Scholar). However, the disease gene has not been identified yet. The elucidation of the molecular structure and functional properties of the lysosomal sialic acid transporter is indispensable for further understanding of the molecular defect(s) in the clinical heterogeneous forms of sialic acid storage diseases. Previously, we have developed a functional reconstitution system for the sialic acid transporter that provided the tool to start the purification and functional characterization of the transport protein (6Mancini G.M.S.

In this paper we present the purification of the sialic acid transporter from lysosomal membranes of rat liver to apparent homogeneity. Its functional properties are compared with those of other monocarboxylate transporters present in the plasma membrane of various mammalian cells (7Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Am. J.

Highly purified lysosomal membrane vesicles were isolated from livers of adult Wistar rats (3Mancini G.M.S. de Jonge H.R. Galjaard H. Verheijen F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15247-15254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lysosomal membrane vesicles were suspended at a protein concentration of 8–10 mg/ml in 20 mm NaHepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA and were stored at −70 °C. All chemicals used were obtained from Sigma or as indicated. l-Iduronic acid, sodium salt was obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. (North York, ON, Canada). All the tested carboxylates were titrated with NaOH before use. Reconstitution of the protein eluates into liposomes was performed as described earlier (6Mancini G.M.S. Beerens C.E.M.T. Galjaard H. Verheijen F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6609-6613Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), with the following modification: proteoliposomes were formed by incubating the protein sample, containing detergent and phospholipid (total volume, 170 μl), with 150 μl of Amberlite XAD-2 beads (Fluka) in 20 mm NaHepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl. After 30 min of rotation at room temperature, beads were removed by short centrifugation, and proteoliposomes were used for transport assays. After reconstitution, the carrier activity was assayed by uptake of radiolabeled GlcA in the presence of an inwardly directed proton gradient. Because Neu5Ac and GlcA are transported by the same lysosomal transporter for acidic monosaccharides (3Mancini G.M.S. de Jonge H.R. Galjaard H. Verheijen F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15247-15254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Mancini G.M.S. Beerens C.E.M.T. Aula P.P. Verheijen F.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we have performed all studies using radiolabeled GlcA, which was more readily available. Aliquots of proteoliposomes (25 μl) were incubated at 37 °C with 5 μl of 240 mm Mes (free acid) containing 2 μCi ofd-[1-3H]GlcA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; specific activity, 6.6 Ci/mmol), resulting in an extravesicular pH of 5.5 and a final concentration of 10 μm GlcA. Blank values were determined by incubation of proteoliposomes at 37 °C with 40 mm Mes (free acid), 7 mm unlabeled NaGlcA, pH 5.5, and 2 μCi of d-[1-3H]GlcA and subtracted from all determinations. Previous experiments showed that uptake rates are linear up to 1 min. After 1 min, the reactions were stopped by diluting the sample with 70 μl of ice-cold incubation buffer (17 mm NaHepes, 84 mm KCl, 40 mm Mes (free acid), pH 5.5). The samples were immediately applied to a Sephadex G50 fine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (Pasteur pipettes, 0.5 × 5cm) at 4 °C. Columns were equilibrated in cold incubation buffer, and vesicles were eluted with 1 ml of cold incubation buffer. Vesicle-associated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting in 10 ml of Insta-gel (Packard). cis-Inhibition experiments were performed by incubating the proteoliposomes for 1 min at 37 °C with 2 μCi of [3H]GlcA (final concentration, 10 μm) in 40 mm Mes (free acid), resulting in an inwardly directed proton gradient (pHin = 7.4 > pHout = 5.5), and 7 mm of the tested compound. For trans-stimulation studies, a 60% proteoliposome solution (25 μl) was pre-incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with 17 mm NaHepes, 84 mm KCl, 40 mm Mes acid, pH 5.5, plus 10 μm monensin, 10 μmvalinomycin (Boehringer Mannheim) in the presence or absence of 1 mm unlabeled substrate. The assay was started by adding 75 μl of an equivalent buffer containing 2 μCi of [3H]GlcA at 37 °C with a final concentration of 0.25 mm. When the samples were pre-incubated without unlabeled substrate, the external final concentration was corrected as in the case of preloading (0.25 mm unlabeled compound). After 1 min, the reaction was stopped as described (6Mancini G.M.S. Beerens C.E.M.T. Galjaard H. Verheijen F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6609-6613Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The experiments with [14C]l-lactate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; specific activity, 152 mCi/mmol) were largely performed as described for [3H]GlcA. However, incubation mixtures contained 0.066 μCi of [14C]l-lactate (final concentration, 15 μm) and were performed at 20 °C instead of 37 °C. Blank values were determined by incubation of proteoliposomes with 40 mm Mes (free acid), 7 mm unlabeled sodiuml-lactate and subtracted from all determinations. For protein side chain modification, proteoliposomes (100 μl) were incubated and treated as described (6Mancini G.M.S. Beerens C.E.M.T. Galjaard H. Verheijen F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6609-6613Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For a single purification, lysosomal membrane vesicles prepared from 150 g of rat livers (15 rats) were used. Solubilization of lysosomal membrane proteins was performed by mixing the lysosomal membrane vesicles 1:1 (v/v) with 1% Triton X-100 (especially purified for membrane research, Boehringer Mannheim), 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. After 25 min of incubation at 0 °C, unextracted material was pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 150,000 × g in a Beckman SW 40 rotor for 20 min at 4 °C. The Triton X-100 extract was applied to hydroxyapatite columns (Pasteur pipettes containing 0.5 g of dry material, Biogel HTP, Bio-Rad, packed by 15 s of tapping) at 4 °C, with a maximum of 500 μl solubilized material/column. Each column was washed with 3 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100 (buffer A). Elution was with 3 ml of buffer A, 25 mm Na2HPO4, NaH2PO4, pH 7.4. After pooling all the 3-ml eluates, a 2-ml sample was concentrated in a Centricon 10 device (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) until 100–150 μl and desalted. A 50-μl aliquot was used for the reconstitution assay and a 20-μl aliquot was used for the protein assay. Desalting was performed on a 2-ml Sephadex G50 medium (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated in buffer A (10Penefsky H.S. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The eluates of the different hydroxyapatite columns were pooled and applied to a 2-ml lentil lectin affinity chromatography column (lentil lectin-Sepharose 4B, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated in buffer A. After washing the lentil lectin column with 2 ml of buffer A, the flow-through fraction (unretained material) was applied to a 2-ml DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) anion exchanger pre-equilibrated in buffer A containing 10% glycerol (buffer B). A 2-ml sample of the lentil lectin flow-through fraction was concentrated in a Centricon 10 device to 100–150 μl and desalted (10Penefsky H.S. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). A 50-μl aliquot was used for the reconstitution assay, and a 20-μl aliquot was used for the protein assay. After extensive washing the DEAE-Sephacel column with 20 ml of buffer B and 20 ml of buffer B with 40 mm NaCl, bound material was eluted with 6 ml of buffer B with 100 mm NaCl. This fraction was stored at −70 °C. After the DEAE-eluate was thawed, a 0.5 ml sample was concentrated in a Centricon 10 device until 100 μl and desalted (10Penefsky H.S. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). A 50 μl aliquot was used for the reconstitution assay and a 20 μl aliquot for the protein assay. The 100 mm NaCl DEAE-eluate (5.5 ml) was adjusted to pH 6.0 with 0.5 m Mes (free acid) and applied to a prepacked hydroxyapatite column (1-ml EconoPac HTP cartridge, Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated in 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaMes pH 6.0, 0.1% Triton X-100. Transport activity was eluted with 6 ml of 1 mm Na2HPO4, NaH2PO4, pH 6.0, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100. This eluate was concentrated in Millipore ultrafree-15 centrifugal filters 10K (Millipore Corporation, Bedford) to approximately 300 μl and desalted (10Penefsky H.S. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). A 50-μl aliquot was used for the reconstitution assay, and a 100-μl aliquot was used for the protein assay. The concentrated hydroxyapatite eluate (150 μl) was applied to a 0.10-ml Mono Q anion exchange column attached to a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech SMART system. This column was equilibrated in buffer B, and bound material was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–210 mm NaCl in buffer B. Fractions of 0.1 ml were collected and pooled pairwise, buffer was exchanged for 20 mm NaHepes, 100 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 by the desalting procedure as described above, and a 50-μl aliquot was used for the reconstitution assay. All column procedures were performed at 4 °C. The purity of the various active fractions was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) of methanol/chloroform precipitated samples (12Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3170) Google Scholar), followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or the silver nitrate staining according to Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Protein concentration was determined by the procedure of Lowry et al. as modified by Peterson (13Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 201-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar) for the presence of Triton. Protein concentrations in eluates of the second hydroxyapatite column were determined after methanol/chloroform precipitation (12Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3170) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations in Mono Q eluates were too low to be determined by the above assay and were therefore estimated from silver-stained SDS-PAGE gels. For the endoglycosidase F/N-Glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim) treatment of the purified protein, the Mono Q fractions 19–23 were pooled, concentrated, and incubated with 25 milliunits endoglycosidase F, 100 μl in the presence of 20 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 50 mm EDTA, 2% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol for 2 h at 37 °C. Proteins were precipitated with methanol/chloroform (12Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3170) Google Scholar). The pellet was resuspended in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% gel). Various membrane (transport) proteins have been successfully purified using hydroxyapatite as well as ion exchange chromatography in the presence of detergents (14Palmieri F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 15Kyouden T. Himeno M. Ishikawa T. Ohsumi Y. Kato K. J. Biochem.

In addition, affinity chromatography with oligosaccharide-specific lectins has been used to identify the major heavily glycosylated lysosomal membrane proteins: LAMPs (lysosomal-associated membraneproteins) and LIMPs (lysosomalintegral membrane proteins) (19Carlsson S.R. Roth J. Piller F. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18911-18919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Akasaki K. Yamaguchi Y. Furuno K. Tsuji H. J. Biochem.

Based on the success of these purification methods for membrane proteins we developed a purification protocol for the lysosomal sialic acid transporter. Previously, we have reported a successful reconstitution procedure for the rat liver lysosomal sialic acid transporter that now provided the functional assay to follow fractionation and purification of the solubilized transporter (6Mancini G.M.S. Beerens C.E.M.T. Galjaard H. Verheijen F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6609-6613Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). At all steps of the purification procedure, samples were collected and reconstituted into proteoliposomes, and their transport activities were measured using radiolabeled GlcA as a substrate (TableI).Table IPurification of the sialic acid transporter from rat liver lysosomal membrane vesiclesFractionProteinTotal proteinTotal ActivityYieldSpecific activityFold enhancementμg/mlμgpmol/min%pmol GlcA/mg/minSolubilized lysosomal membrane extract200120002102.4100175.21First hydroxyapatite eluate16.4591441.521747.34Lentil lectin eluate13.6489378.418774.44.4DEAE eluate16.699.5252.3122534.914.5Second hydroxyapatite eluate0.53.042.1214171.480Mono Q eluate0.140.0282.10.175757.6432Lysosomal membrane vesicles (approximately 25 mg of protein) derived from 150 g of rat livers were used as starting material.

Data represent the means of three separate isolations. Open table in a new tab Lysosomal membrane vesicles (approximately 25 mg of protein) derived from 150 g of rat livers were used as starting material. The purification procedure, reconstitution, and transport assay were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Activity is expressed as uptake of [3H]GlcA in 1 min at 37 °C. Data represent the means of three separate isolations. The Triton X-100 solubilized lysosomal membrane proteins were applied to small columns of dry hydroxyapatite material. The columns were washed with equilibration buffer at pH 7.4, and about 20% of the transport activity was eluted with 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. This resulted in a 4-fold purification. The next step consisted of lentil lectin affinity chromatography. Almost all activity of the sialic acid transporter was recovered from the column flow-through. Lentil lectin recognizes α-d-glucose and α-d-mannose residues and therefore binds glycoproteins. Consequently, a number of major lysosomal membrane glycoproteins bound to the column and thus could be separated from the protein preparation containing transport activity. This step was kept in our protocol despite the fact that it did not lead to an increase in specific activity. The lentil lectin flow-through fraction was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel anion exchange column. With 100 mm NaCl, 12% of the total transport activity was eluted. As depicted in Table I, this resulted in a ≈14.5-fold increase in specific activity over the starting material. Analysis of the protein composition of fractions obtained from these initial purification steps is shown in Fig.1. Many different protein bands were still present. The next purification step consisted of chromatography on hydroxyapatite. This time the column was pre-equilibrated at pH 6.0 in the presence of 300 mm NaCl. Under these conditions, acidic proteins are retained and are eluted with low phosphate buffers. This step provided an important purification of the sialic acid transport protein with an 80-fold enrichment in specific activity (Table I). SDS-PAGE protein analysis using silver staining showed at least four distinct protein bands (Fig.2 A). One of these proteins has a molecular mass of 85 kDa and based on its N-terminal amino acid sequence represented one of the major lysosomal membrane glycoproteins, the Lgp85 or LIMP II (23Fujita H. Ezaki J. Noguchi Y. Kono A. Himeno M. Kato K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Another major 67-kDa protein represented the lysosomal membrane-bound subunit of acid phosphatase (24Himeno M. Koutoku H. Ishikawa T. Kato K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The other proteins were considered as candidates for the lysosomal sialic acid transporter. The next purification step consisted of a strong anion exchange Mono Q column attached to the SMART system of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Retained proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0–210 mmNaCl. SDS-PAGE analysis by silver nitrate staining of the eluted proteins showed a predominant protein band with a molecular mass of ≈57 kDa in the fractions 20/21 in which also the highest GlcA transport activity was observed (Fig. 2 B). In addition, quantitative image analysis of the SDS-PAGE protein elution pattern from the Mono Q column demonstrated a correlation between the 57-kDa protein and the transport activity (data not shown). All other visualized proteins could not represent the sialic acid transporter, because they became more prevalent in following fractions, where lower or no transport activity was detected (Fig. 2 B). In the final protein preparations (fractions 20–21 from the Mono Q column) transport activity was 432-fold enriched over the activity in the initial lysosomal membrane extract (Table I). Considering that the lysosomal membrane marker β-glucosidase is about 100-fold enriched in the lysosomal membrane vesicles (used as a starting material), the sialic acid transport protein is about 40,000-fold purified in the final eluate of the Mono Q column. To investigate the glycosylation of the transporter, the final protein preparation was incubated with the enzyme mixture endoglycosidase F/N-glycosidase F. After treatment, the apparent molecular mass of the 57-kDa protein was not decreased. The apparent molecular mass of a control glycoprotein was decreased as a result of cleavage of glycosydic chains (data not shown). This, together with the observation that this protein did not interact with lentil lectin, indicates that the carrier is apparently not glycosylated. Analysis by SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of the thiol-reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol did not show any alteration of the electrophoretic behavior of the purified transport protein (data not shown). This indicates that the transporter is not functional as a (homo)dimer or polymer linked by disulfide bridges. Because the final yield of the highly purified sialic acid transporter was very low, detailed kinetic studies were difficult to perform. Therefore, most kinetic characterization of the lysosomal sialic acid transporter was performed using partially purified preparations (DEAE-Sephacel eluates). Subsequently, some key experiments were repeated in a concise manner with the highly purified transport preparation. In earlier substrate specificity studies with the crude lysosomal sialic acid transporter, we have shown that this transporter recognizes structurally different types of acidic monosaccharides (i.e. the sialic acid Neu5Ac and the uronic acid GlcA) (3Mancini G.M.S. de Jonge H.R.

Invest. 1991; 87: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The uronic acid iduronate (IdoA) represents, like GlcA, a major component of glycosaminoglycans. These are degraded in lysosomes, and thus free IdoA is like GlcA expected to be transported across the lysosomal membrane. The recent commercial availability of free IdoA made it now possible to investigate by cis-inhibition andtrans-stimulation studies whether this uronic acid is also a substrate for the lysosomal sialic acid transporter (TableII). IdoA inhibited [3H]GlcA uptake, although less efficiently than Neu5Ac and GlcA. Furthermore, IdoA was able to induce, like its isomer GlcA, almost a 2-fold trans-stimulation (Table II). These experiments indicate that IdoA is indeed a substrate for the sialic acid transporter.Table IIcis-Inhibition and trans-stimulation of [3H]GlcA uptake by mono-, di-, or tricarboxylic acidsTransport activitytrans-Stimulationpmol/mg/min% of control% of not trans-stimulatedControl2280.5 ± 132.6Acidic monosaccharidesGlcA00200Neu5Ac00IdoA916.1 ± 272.440180MonocarboxylatesOxamate553.0 ± 45.524Pyruvate534.6 ± 46.024l-Lactate195.6 ± 67.881504-OH-butyrate369.4 ± 107.216Mevalonate510.0 ± 24.022109Valproate00DicarboxylatesSuccinate0079Malate366.0 ± 21.816Malonate685.3 ± 37.530Maleate592.5 ± 79.526Fumarate234.3 ± 81.010α-Ketoglutarate1090.2 ± 199.648Glutamate2437.8 ± 195.4107TricarboxylateCitrate1665.9 ± 30.673The partially purified (DEAE-Sephacel eluate) sialic acid transporter was reconstituted, and proteoliposomes were incubated 1 min at 37 °C with 10 μm [3H]GlcA in the presence of an inwardly directed proton gradient and 7 mm of the indicated compounds.

To investigate the role of serine and threonine residues within the carboxyl tail, several mutants were constructed by truncating the carboxyl tail of the hemagglutinin-tagged μ-opioid receptor, thereby removing serines and threonines systematically. Neuro2A cells stably expressing the truncated receptors did not exhibit a significant alteration in the affinity of [3H]diprenorphine or etorphine for the receptor or the potency of etorphine to inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. Chronic etorphine treatment resulted in a time-dependent down-regulation of all the truncated receptors, except MOR1TAG355D, thus revealing the importance of the four amino acids between Ser355 and Glu359 (STIE). Surprisingly, deletion of the STIE sequence resulted in a receptor that down-regulated the same as the wild-type receptor. The involvement of multiple amino acids within the carboxyl tail was demonstrated by combining alanine substitutions of several putative G-protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation sites. Systematic analysis of these receptors indicated that mutation of Ser356 and Ser363 to alanine attenuated agonist-mediated down-regulation. The magnitude of etorphine-induced phosphorylation of this mutant receptor, however, was similar to that of the wild-type μ-opioid receptor.

Prolonged exposure to opioid agonists results in a loss of effector response termed desensitization. It is thought that the overall desensitization of opioid receptors follows that of other G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR),1 where cellular adaptations result in conformational changes that uncouple the receptors from their respective G-proteins. Such molecular changes also lead to an ultimate loss of receptors from the cell surface via internalization and degradation pathways. The mechanisms and specific amino acids which facilitate these processes, however, have not been delineated. While nearly all GPCRs follow this overall process of desensitization, the β-adrenergic receptor has served as a model for characterizing such mechanisms. In the β-adrenergic receptor, agonist-activation initiates receptor phosphorylation by multiple kinases including protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase A (PKA), and G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK). Phosphorylation of the receptor, in turn, enhances the affinity of β-arrestin, an associative protein, which advances receptor internalization leading to receptor degradation (1Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). This paradigm of receptor phosphorylation has been shown to account for the agonist-induced receptor internalization of numerous other members of the GPCR family (2Fukushima Y. Asano T. Takata K. Funaki M. Ogihara T. Anai M. Tsukuda K. Saitoh T. Katagiri H. Aihara M. Matsuhashi N. Oka Y. Yazaki Y. Sugano K. J. Biol.

There is, however, no consensus among the GPCR family as to a common motif for down-regulation, but phosphorylation of the receptor appears to be a prerequisite. Studies have indicated that opioid receptors are rapidly phosphorylated after agonist activation as well. Zhang and colleagues (7Zhang L. Yu Y. Mackin S. Weight F.F. Uhl G.R. Wang J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11449-11454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) demonstrated that both morphine and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a PKC activator, stimulated phosphorylation of the μ-opioid receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells within 5 min of exposure. They then suggested a correlation between the time course of this phosphorylation event with that of the desensitization of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel (GIRK) to opioid agonists inXenopusoocytes expressing both the μ-opioid receptor and channel (7Zhang L. Yu Y. Mackin S. Weight F.F. Uhl G.R. Wang J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11449-11454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These studies in the oocytes were supported by a study with Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing the wild-type and mutant receptors when Pak and colleagues (8Pak Y. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24961-24965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) reported that point mutation of Thr394 to alanine completely blocked desensitization of the receptor to DAMGO after just 1 h of exposure. They proposed that phosphorylation of this specific threonine individually gated the desensitization of the μ-opioid receptor. However, studies by Kovoor and co-workers (9Kovoor A. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) directly contradicted the notion that a phosphorylation event is involved in the desensitization of the μ-opioid receptor. They demonstrated that the rate of desensitization was not altered by staurosporine, a PKC inhibitor, and concluded that the desensitization of the receptor does not involve a phosphorylation dependent mechanism (9Kovoor A. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this study was supported by El-Kouhen and colleagues who recently demonstrated that the loss of adenylyl cyclase to DAMGO had a t 12 of 7 h in HEK 293 cells stably expressing the μ-opioid receptor. 2R. El-Kouhen, O. Maestri-El Kouhen, P-Y. Law, and H. H. Loh, submitted for publication. This loss of response, however, did not correspond with DAMGO-induced phosphorylation which was maximal after just 20 min, suggesting that the phosphorylation of the μ-opioid receptor does not directly induce desensitization of the receptor.2 Despite these discrepancies, phosphorylation has been demonstrated to play a critical role in the down-regulation of the receptor after long-term agonist exposure. The addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate potentiated agonist-induced down-regulation of the δ-opioid receptor, and staurosporine, a PKC inhibitor, blocked down-regulation of the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulated receptors, but not those receiving agonist alone (10Gucker S. Bidlack J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 656-665PubMed Google Scholar), favoring PKC as the mediating kinase. Additionally, dominant negative mutants of β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 and GRK 5 did not block agonist-induced phosphorylation of the δ-receptor, again arguing that phosphorylation occurs through multiple kinases (11Pei G. Kieffer B.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 173-177PubMed Google Scholar). Another study that examined down-regulation of the δ-opioid receptor demonstrated that Thr353 alone mediated agonist-induced down-regulation and argued that phosphorylation was responsible for this event (12Cvejic S. Trapaidze N. Cyr C. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4073-4076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thr353, however, is not a conserved residue for the μ- or κ-receptors. Furthermore, through the use of fluorescently labeled deltorphin I and [Lys7]dermorphine analogs, Gaudriaultet al. (13Gaudriault G. Nouel D. Farra C.D. Beaudet A. Vincent J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2880-2888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the μ- and δ-opioid receptors internalize via different pathways utilizing distinct, yet separate, proteins. This would support the hypothesis that there is a difference in the down-regulation motif of the δ- and μ-opioid receptors. In addition, Capeyrou and colleagues (14Capeyrou R. Riond J. Corbani M. Lepage J-F. Bertin B. Emorine L.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) showed that agonist-induced down-regulation was blocked when all the serine and threonine residues within the third intracellular loop and carboxyl tail of the μ-opioid receptor were exchanged with alanine. The study unfortunately did not evaluate the carboxyl tail and third intracellular loop separately, but the findings suggest a role for phosphorylation in agonist-induced down-regulation of the μ-opioid receptor. The studies presented here investigate whether phosphorylation plays a pivotal role in agonist-induced down-regulation of the μ-opioid receptor. The carboxyl tail of the μ-opioid receptor contains 12 serine and threonine residues which constitute numerous GRK and PKC consensus sites. The importance of this domain in agonist-induced down-regulation was evaluated through the use of (i) truncations of the carboxyl tail; (ii) deletions of specific motifs within the carboxyl tail; and (iii) point mutations of serine and threonine residues within the carboxyl tail. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by an automated DNA synthesizer (Millipore model 8905). Taq polymerase and restriction enzymes were obtained from Boehringer-Mannheim (Indianapolis, IN). Expression vector pcDNA3 and cloning vector pCRII were from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Cell culture reagents, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, minimal essential medium, fetal calf serum, and G418 were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). [3H]Adenine and [3H]diprenorphine were purchased from Amersham and125I-labeled acetylated cAMP was purchased from Linco Research (St. Charles, MO). All opioid peptides and alkaloids, with the exception of naloxone (supplied by Endo Lab) are obtained from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Polyclonal antibodies for the cAMP radioimmunoassay were a generous gift from Dr. T. Gettys (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC). The human influenza virus hemagglutinin epitope-tagged μ-opioid receptor as described previously (15Arvidsson U. Riedl M. Chakrabarti S. Lee J-H. Nakano A. Dado R. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Wessendorf M. Elde R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3328-3341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was utilized in the construction of the truncated μ-opioid receptors. Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were used to truncate the receptor by adding a stop codon after amino acids Ser375, Ser363, Glu359, or Ser355. The PCR reactions contained (final concentration) 25 mm Taps-HCl (pH 9.3), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm upstream and downstream primers, 0.2 mmdNTP, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Boehringer-Mannheim) with the following conditions: 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 25 cycles. All the downstream primers contain the XbaI site used in later subcloning. The resulting products were subcloned into a pCRII plasmid (Invitrogen) and were then sequenced with Sequenase using the dideoxynucleotide termination method to verify the distinct mutations. Fragments isolated from the EcoR47III (nucleotide 1120 in the wild-type receptor)/XbaI restriction digest of the mutants were subcloned into MOR1TAG previously subcloned into pcDNA3(Invitrogen) at the EcoRI/Xba multicloning sites with the fragment between Eco47III and XbaI sites removed. The deletion of the amino acids between Ser356 and Glu359 (MOR1TAG355/359) was also constructed by PCR. The resulting PCR products were subcloned into pCRII, sequenced, and subsequently subcloned into pcDNA3 as described above. Additional point mutations alone or in combination with other point mutations were constructed in multiple steps using the OuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis method as outlined by Strategene (La Jolla, CA). Forward and reverse oligonucleotides with the desired mutation and a designed endonuclease site were synthesized. First using cDNA from the wild-type μ-opioid receptor and then subsequently using cDNA with a desired serine and/or threonine mutation as a template, PCR was performed. The conditions for PCR were as follows: 10 mm KCl, 6 mm(NH4)2SO4, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 44 nmoligonucleotide, 0.1 mm dNTP, 40 ng of template, and 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase in a total volume of 50 μl; denatured at 95 °C for 30 s, annealed at 56–60 °C for 30 s, and extended at 68 °C for 14 min for 18 cycles. After PCR, 10 units ofDpnI endonuclease was added to each reaction and the reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h so as to remove the original templates. Finally, 5 μl of the resulting incubation mixtures were used to transform competent XL-B1 cells. The DNA sequences of the mutants were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide termination reactions using Sequenase II. Stable transfections of wild-type and truncated MOR1TAG into Neuro2A cells were carried out by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described by Chen and Okayama (16Chen Y. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). After 10–14 days of selection with 1 mg/ml geniticin (G-418), colonies were isolated. Clones were initially selected to have similar counts/min/mg of protein and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 250 μg/ml geniticin under humidified atmosphere with 10% carbon dioxide. For transient transfections, HEK 293 cells were also transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method and assays were performed 48–60 h after transfection. The ability of the opioid agonist, etorphine, to inhibit 10 μm forskolin-stimulated intracellular [3H]cAMP production in these Neuro2A clones was determined using [3H]adenine to label intracellular ATP pools as described (17Law P.Y. Hom D.S. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1983; 24: 413-424PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]cAMP was then separated from other radioactive nucleotides by Dowex and Alumina chromatography as described by White and Karr (18White A.A. Karr D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 85: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The IC50 values of the agonists and maximal inhibitory levels were obtained by curve-fitting the dose-response curves using Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific). For HEK 293 cells transiently expressing mutant opioid receptors, inhibition of 5 μm forskolin-stimulated intracellular cAMP was determined by a radioimmunoassay using 125I-labeled acetylated cAMP and rabbit polyclonal antibodies which recognize the acetylated cAMP (19Walseth F.T. Zhang H.-J. Olson L.K. Schroeder W.A. Robertson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21106-21111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For these experiments, the cells were incubated for 15 min in the same reagents described above. Each reaction was terminated with 50 μl of 3.3 n perchloric acid, neutralized with 2m KOH, 1 m Tris, and 60 mm EDTA, and subsequently assayed for the amount of cAMP without further purification. The IC50 values of etorphine were obtained by curve-fitting the dose-response curves using GraphPad Prism. Characterization of the μ-opioid receptor-binding sites in Neuro2A cells expressing wild-type and truncated receptors was carried out with membrane (100,000 × g × 60 min membrane preparations minus nuclei) in 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm MgCl2 at 24 °C for 90 min as described (17Law P.Y. Hom D.S. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1983; 24: 413-424PubMed Google Scholar). The K d and B max values were determined for each clone by computer analysis using the Ligand program (20Rodbard D. Munson P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Competition binding studies measured the ability of increasing concentrations of opioids to compete for the binding of either 0.5 or 1 nm [3H]diprenorphine (as indicated in the legends). The IC50 values of the competition binding studies were then obtained by curve-fitting the dose-response curves using Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific) or the Ligand program. TheK i values were calculated from the IC50values using the Cheng-Prussoff relationship (21Cheng Y.C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 413-424Google Scholar). As for the measurement of opioid receptor down-regulation, cells were pretreated with 100 nm etorphine for the times indicated in the figure legends. The same amount of opioid ligands was added to control cells 5 min prior to harvesting so as to equalize the ligand concentration in all the cells. The cells were then washed by incubating at 37 °C for 15 min 3 times in Kreb-Ringer HEPES buffer (KRHB) (110 mm NaCl, 25 mm glucose, 55 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mmCaCl2) to remove all the bound ligand. Opioid receptor binding was performed using 1 nm[3H]diprenorphine in KRHB, pH 7.5, at room temperature for 90 min (17Law P.Y. Hom D.S. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1983; 24: 413-424PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of HEK 293 cells transiently expressing the μ-opioid receptor was determined as described previously.2 Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium incubated with 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (ICN) for 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Etorphine was added as indicated in the figure legends. Each reaction was terminated on ice, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and subsequently lysed (lysis buffer: 25 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, with 100 μg/ml bacitracin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenlmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 20 μg/ml benzamide as protease inhibitors and with 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium phosphate, and 0.1 mmsodium vandadate). After solubilization, insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation and the receptor was partially purified by wheat germ lectin affinity columns. These purified samples were incubated in the presence of hemagglutinin-monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Boehringer-Mannheim) and prewashed immunopure protein G-agarose beads (Pierce Chemical Co.). The final samples were eluted from the agarose beads and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and the phosphorylated proteins were visualized and quantified by using the PhosphorImager Storm 840 system (Molecular Dynamics). ttests were performed by use of the statistical program Statview. Within the carboxyl tail of the μ-opioid receptor there are 12 serine and threonine residues which pose as potential kinase-mediated phosphorylation sites. However, as defined by the motif of acidic amino acids directly upstream (N terminus) of each phosphorylated amino acid, there are only nine putative GRK sites, Thr354, Ser355, Ser356, Thr357, Ser363, Thr364, Ser375, Ser376, and Thr394 (22Fredricks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To explore the region of the carboxyl tail necessary for agonist-induced down-regulation, truncations of the μ-opioid receptor were performed systematically to remove the 12 serine and threonine residues in groups of four. These truncations were made by the addition of stop codons after amino acids positioned after 375, 363, and 355 (Fig.1) and will be referred to as MOR1TAG375D, MOR1TAG363D, and MOR1TAG355D, respectively. MOR1B, a splice variant of the μ-opioid receptor, has sequence homology with the wild-type receptor up to Glu386 where the sequence then differs by only five amino acids and is ultimately seven amino acids shorter than the wild-type receptor (23Zimprich A. Simon T. Hollt V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). MOR1B was, therefore, utilized in this study of down-regulation to compare these alterations of the carboxyl tail with our truncation mutants. The truncated, splice variant and wild-type receptors, as described in Fig. 1, were stably expressed in murine neuroblastoma cells, Neuro2A, and clones expressing receptors with similar [3H]diprenorphine binding (K d, andB max, Table I) were selected to negate the possibility of receptor density influencing the action of opioid agonists.

The IC50 for etorphine to inhibit 10 μm forskolin-stimulated intracellular [3H]cAMP production was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Receptor down-regulation, a decrease in the total cellular receptor concentration, occurs after prolonged exposure to agonists. This loss of surface receptors is dependent on both time and agonist concentration. Initially to investigate etorphine-induced down-regulation, Neuro2A cells expressing the wild-type receptors were treated with 100 nm etorphine for various times up to 24 h and whole cell binding was carried out with [3H]diprenorphine (Fig. 2). The wild-type receptor maximally down-regulated 64 ± 3.8% after 6 h of etorphine treatment and remained relatively constant for the 24 h. To ensure that truncating the receptor did not delay down-regulation of the receptor, Neuro2A cells expressing either the splice variant, truncated, or wild-type receptors were treated with 100 nm etorphine for a duration of 24 h. After etorphine treatment, MOR1TAG (wild type), MOR1BTAG (splice variant), MOR1TAG375D, and MOR1TAG363D displayed a time-dependent down-regulation of 66 ± 2.4%, 52 ± 1.5%, 52 ± 6.3%, and 52 ± 3.5%, respectively, by 24 h (Fig. 3). MOR1TAG355D, however, did not down-regulate in response to the same concentration of etorphine. This lack of etorphine-induced down-regulation of MOR1TAG355D, however, could not be due to a phenotypic response or time dependence because there was no evidence of etorphine-induced down-regulation in any of the clones examined at all the time points examined from 1 to 24 h (data not shown).Figure 3Etorphine-induced down-regulation in Neuro2A cells expressing the splice variant, truncated, and wild-type μ-opioid receptors. Neuro2A cells expressing the wild-type, MOR1BTAG, MOR1TAG355D, MOR1TAG359D, MOR1TAG363D, and MOR1TAG375D receptors were treated with 100 nm etorphine for 24 h and compared with control cells. The ability to down-regulate was measured by [3H]diprenorphine whole cell binding (see “Experimental Procedures”).

The key to the difference between these two responses may be related to the eight amino acids which lie between the two truncation sites. The original truncations were made to remove serines and threonines in a systematic manner, thereby removing potential phosphorylation sites within the carboxyl tail of the opioid receptor. To pursue the possibility that some or all of the specific amino acids responsible for the down-regulation of the μ-opioid receptor lie within this eight amino acid stretch, another truncation after Glu359, referred to as MOR1TAG359D, was constructed (Fig. 1). MOR1TAG359D was stably expressed in Neuro2A cells and a clone having a similarK d and B max to the other truncated receptors was selected. As shown in Fig. 3, MOR1TAG359D down-regulated 51 ± 9.4% after etorphine treatment. These results are consistent with those of the other truncated receptors and suggest that only four amino acid residues, STIE, between MOR1TAG355D and MOR1TAG359D might be necessary for agonist-induced down-regulation. To further investigate whether this STIE motif mediates agonist-induced down-regulation of the μ-opioid receptor, these four amino acids were deleted while leaving the remaining carboxyl tail intact. The receptor construct referred to as MOR1TAG355/359 (Fig. 1) was transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, HEK 293. [3H]Diprenorphine binding revealed a loss of surface receptors after treatment with 1 μm etorphine for 12 h (Fig. 4). Thus, these data suggested that the STIE motif is not sufficient in determining the ability of the receptor to be down-regulated by agonist. To ensure that the behavior or regulation of the expressed opioid receptors was comparable between HEK 293 and Neuro2A cells, transient transfection of HEK 293 cells with MOR1TAG and MOR1TAG355D were performed in parallel as controls (Fig. 4). Similar to the data previously obtained with Neuro2A cells, etorphine could down-regulate the wild-type receptor, but not MOR1TAG355D. Likewise, HEK 293 cells stably expressing MOR1TAG verified that the rate of down-regulation in response to etorphine was comparable to that in Neuro2Acells (data not shown, Fig. 2). While the deletion of the STIE motif may indicate that this region is not critical in the etorphine-induced down-regulation of the receptor, it may also reveal the complexity of the regulation, suggesting that multiple motifs or amino acids are needed to attenuate down-regulation. The carboxyl tail of the μ-opioid receptor is the primary site of phosphorylation2 and plays an integral role in GRK mediated internalization (24Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Bodduluri S.R. La"

COS-7 cells with the plasmid containing C1199A expressed primarily monomers, suggesting that half-cystine 1199 in the D3-domain is involved in forming mucin multimers. This residue is in the sequence C1199SWRYEPCG, which is highly conserved in the D3-domain of other secreted mucins and human prepro-von Willebrand factor. In contrast, cells with the plasmid containing C1276A expressed trimers like those with unmutated plasmid, suggesting that half-cystine 1276 is not involved in formation of disulfide-bonded multimers. The roles of the half-cystines in the CGLCG motifs in the assembly of disulfide-bonded multimers of mucin were also assessed. Cells with plasmids in which both half-cystines in the motif in the D1- or D3-domain of mucin are replaced by alanine expressed proteins that were poorly secreted, suggesting that these mutations impair normal folding of the expressed proteins. A plasmid with a mutant D1-domain motif expressed monomers, whereas one with a mutant D3-domain motif expressed monomers and trimers. However, the trimers expressed by the latter plasmid were assembled in non-acidic compartments, as judged by expression studies in the presence of monensin, which inhibits trimer formation by unmutated plasmid, but not by the mutant plasmid. These results suggest that the CGLCG motif in the D1-domain is required for multimerization in the trans-Golgi complex. However, the CGLCG motif in the D3-domain appears to prevent formation of mucin multimers in non-acidic compartments of the cell. Plasmids encoding the D1- and D2-domains, the D1- and D3-domains, or only the D3-domain also expressed oligomers in the presence of monensin, suggesting that the three D-domains must be contiguous to avoid multimerization in non-acidic compartments.

Secretory mucins are synthesized by epithelial cells that line the luminal surfaces of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts of vertebrates, where they serve to protect the cells from physical injury, dehydration, and microbial infection. They are also found on the skin of amphibia. All of these glycoproteins have in common a central domain containing multiple, tandemly repeated sequences rich in serine and threonine to which O-linked oligosaccharides are attached. However, the number, length, and amino acid sequences of the repeats vary among different mucins (reviewed in Ref. 1Gendler S.J. Spicer A.P. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14442-14449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with ApaI and SalI between the corresponding sites of plasmid pSMD3H. The new vector encodes a fusion protein containing the mucin signal peptide, the entire D3-domain (residues 925–1280), the complete carboxyl-terminal disulfide-rich domain (residues 13045–13288), and a six-histidine tag at the carboxyl terminus. The nucleotide sequences of all plasmids were verified by restriction analysis, partial DNA sequencing with Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), and in vitro transcription/translation assays with the T7-TNT coupled system (Promega) as directed by the manufacturer. Mutant plasmids were made as described earlier (35Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) using the vector pSMNH (21Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. DeLuca A. Hill R.L. J. Biol.

The mutagenic oligonucleotides (Life Technologies, Inc.) were as follows: C1199A, 5′-GCACCTGGGGAAGCTAGCTGGCGTTATG-3′; C1276A, 5′-GATCCAGGATAACGCCGGGAGAATATGC-3′; C253A/C256A, 5′-CACAAACAATATCCAACTGCAGGTCTTGCTGGTAACTTCAACAATACTCC-3′; and C1058A/C1061A, 5′-TGGAATGGCAAAGTGGCCGGCCTTGCCGGAAACAATAATGGCG-3′. To facilitate screening, all mutagenic oligonucleotides were designed to produce silent mutations that destroy or create restriction sites in the DNA encoding mucin along with the desired codon changes. The nucleotide sequences of mutants were verified by restriction analysis, DNA sequencing, and in vitro transcription/translation assays. COS-7 cells were grown, maintained, and transfected with expression vectors with Fugene-6 (Boehringer Mannheim) as reported earlier (21Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. DeLuca A. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14442-14449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Antiserum 5287 against the amino-terminal region of mucin (residues 1059–1360) was also described earlier (21Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. DeLuca A. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14442-14449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, metabolic labeling of cells with [35S]cysteine (ICN), purification of the recombinant proteins by either immunoprecipitation with antiserum 5287 or absorption on TALON-IMAC beads (CLONTECH), and analysis of the proteins by SDS-gel electrophoresis and autoradiography were as described previously (19Perez-Vilar J.

In some experiments, immunoprecipitates obtained with antiserum 5287 were solubilized with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, and 6 m guanidine HCl, pH 8.0, and absorbed on TALON-IMAC beads as described earlier (28Perez-Vilar J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 33410-33415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 14C-Methylated proteins (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) used as molecular weight standards were myosin (220,000), phosphorylase b (97,000–100,000), bovine serum albumin (66,000), ovalbumin (46,000–50,000), carbonic anhydrase (30,000), and lysozyme (14,300). Half-cystine 1142 (36Dong Z. Thoma R.S. Crimmins D.L. McCourt D.W. Tuley E.A. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6753-6758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and half-cystine 1225 (37Azuma H. Hayashi T. Dent J.A. Ruggeri Z.M. Ware J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2821-2827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been suggested to form interchain disulfide bonds in multimers of human prepro-von Willebrand factor. The corresponding half-cystines in porcine submaxillary mucin are half-cystines 1199 and 1276, which are located in the amino-terminal D3-domain (Fig. 1). The codons for these half-cystines were changed one at a time by site-specific mutagenesis to alanine codons in plasmid pSMNH (21Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. DeLuca A. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14442-14449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which encodes the three D-domains of mucin plus a His tag (Fig. 1). The mutant plasmids (C1199A and C1276A) were then transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, and 48 h after transfection, the cells were incubated in medium containing [35S]cysteine. Radiolabeled proteins from the medium were purified on TALON-IMAC beads and then analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. As shown in Fig.2, both mutant plasmids expressed a single protein with M r ∼ 200,000 on reducing SDS-gel electrophoresis (lanes 2 and3). These proteins were indistinguishable from that expressed by unmutated plasmid (lane 1), which, as shown earlier (21Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. DeLuca A. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14442-14449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), corresponds to reduced N-glycosylated monomers of the amino-terminal region of mucin based on its sensitivity toN-glycanase and tunicamycin. These results show that secretion and likely N-glycosylation of the mucin amino-terminal region were not altered by either mutation.Figure 2Expression and secretion of mutants C1199A and C1276A of the amino-terminal region of mucin. COS-7 cells transfected with the expression vector pSMNH (lanes 1 and 4), C1199A (lanes 2and 5), or C1276A (lanes 3 and6) were metabolically labeled 48 h after transfection with [35S]cysteine for 4 h. Proteins from the medium were purified by absorption on TALON-IMAC beads and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and autoradiography after reduction in 2-mercaptoethanol (lanes 1–3) or without reduction (lanes 4–6). M andT indicate the positions of monomers and trimers, respectively, in unreduced samples. Top is the interface between the stacking and running gels. The molecular weights (MW) of the standards are in thousands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 2 also shows the protein species expressed by cells transfected with the mutant plasmids when analyzed on nonreducing gels. As shown earlier (21Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. DeLuca A. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14442-14449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), unmutated plasmid pSMNH (lane 4) produced monomers (M r ∼ 180,000) and a second, slow migrating disulfide-linked oligomeric form that enters the resolving gel. On SDS-gel electrophoresis, this oligomeric form, also as shown earlier (21Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. DeLuca A. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14442-14449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), has a M r of ∼520,000 and migrates slower than dimeric fibronectin (M r ∼ 450,000) and faster than unreduced thyroglobulin (M r ∼ 660,000), which is consistent with disulfide-linked trimers. Mutant C1199A (lane 5) expressed almost entirely monomers (M r ∼ 180,000) and only small amounts of species the size of trimers. In contrast, mutant C1276A (lane 6) expressed both monomers and trimers similar in size to those produced by unmutated plasmid pSMNH (lane 4). Since multimerization of submaxillary mucin occurs by dimerization of the carboxyl-terminal disulfide-rich domains and subsequent oligomerization through the amino-terminal D-domains (19Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9845-9850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,21Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. DeLuca A. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14442-14449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), these observations suggest that half-cystine 1199, but not half-cystine 1276, is involved in formation of disulfide-linked multimers through the D-domains of the mucin. To determine the role of the three D-domains in mucin multimerization, three different plasmids were prepared and expressed in COS-7 cells. As shown schematically in Fig.1, plasmid pSMD1D2H is devoid of the D3-domain and encodes the D1- and D2-domains with a carboxyl-terminal His tag. Plasmid pSMD1D3H is lacking the D2-domain and encodes a fusion protein containing the complete D1- and D3-domains with a carboxyl-terminal His tag. Plasmid pSMD3H lacks the D1- and D2-domains and encodes the entire D3-domain with a carboxyl-terminal His tag. Each plasmid was transfected into COS-7 cells, and the proteins expressed were isolated from the medium and analyzed under reducing conditions as described for Fig. 2. Fig.3 shows that pSMD1D2H (lane 2) and pSMD1D3H (lane 3) expressed M r∼ 180,000 and 170,000 proteins, respectively, that were poorly secreted into the medium. In contrast, plasmid pSMD3H (lane 4) expressed the D3-domain (M r ∼ 90,000) in amounts similar to those expressed by plasmid pSMNH (lane 1), which encodes the entire amino-terminal region (Fig. 1). Fig. 3 also shows that without prior reduction, plasmid pSMD1D2H (lane 6) secreted, into the medium, monomers in very small amounts and mainly disulfide-linked oligomers that ran slightly faster than high molecular weight aggregates seen at the interface between the stacking and running gels. Plasmid pSMD1D3H (lane 7) expressed disulfide-linked oligomers and aggregates, but not monomers. Plasmid pSMD3H (lane 8) expressed primarily a protein with a size (M r ∼ 240,000) similar to that of myosin (M r ∼ 220,000), consistent with the formation of disulfide-linked trimers along with significant amounts of monomers (M r ∼ 80,000) and very small amounts of disulfide-linked aggregates of the D3-domain. As expected, unmutated plasmid pSMNH (lane 5) expressed monomers and trimers, although the latter barely entered the running gel that was intentionally made with a higher percentage of acrylamide than the gel shown in Fig. 2. Earlier studies (21Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. DeLuca A. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14442-14449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) showed that interchain disulfide bond formation by the D-domains occurs in acidic compartments of the Golgi complex because monensin and other compounds that increase the pH of these compartments inhibit interchain disulfide bond formation. Fig.4 shows the effects of monensin on the proteins expressed by pSMNH and pSMD3H. Confirming earlier studies (21Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. DeLuca A. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14442-14449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), plasmid pSMNH secreted monomers under reducing conditions (lane 1) and monomers and disulfide-linked trimers under nonreducing conditions (lane 5). However, as also expected, in the presence of monensin, only monomers were observed under reducing (lane 2) and nonreducing (lane 6) conditions. In contrast, formation of trimers of the D3-domain by plasmid pSMD3H was unaffected by monensin (lane 8), although no interfacial aggregates were observed. The D3-domain secreted in the presence of monensin migrated slightly faster than that in its absence (lane 7), suggesting that this domain is N-glycosylated and that processing of N-linked oligosaccharides is impaired just as for the entire amino-terminal region (21Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. DeLuca A. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14442-14449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).

Incubation of right side-out renal microsomal vesicles with Cu2+ ions, ascorbate, and H2O2 produces two major cleavages of the α subunit within the extracellular loop between trans-membrane segments M7 and M8 and L7/8. Minor cleavages are also detected in loops L9/10 and L5/6. In the β subunit two cleavages are detected, one before the first S-S bridge and the other between the second and third S-S bridges. Na,K-ATPase and Rb+ occlusion are inactivated after incubation with Cu2+/ascorbate/H2O2. These observations are suggestive of a site-specific mechanism involving cleavage of peptide bonds close to a bound Cu2+ ion. This mechanism allows several inferences on subunit interactions and spatial organization. The two cleavage sites in L7/8 of the α subunit and two cleavage sites of the β subunit identify interacting segments of the subunits. L7/8 is also close to L9/10 and to cation occlusion sites.

A full understanding of the working of P-type cation pumps will require knowledge of molecular structure. The recent cryoelectron microscopy studies of Ca-ATPase and H-ATPase demonstrate the overall shape of these proteins at 8-Å resolution and the presence of 10 trans-membrane α-helical rods, most of which are tilted at an angle to the membrane (2Zhang P. Toyashima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 3Auer M. Scarborough G.A. Kühlbrandt W. Nature. 1998; 392: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Previous work, utilizing a variety of biochemical and molecular techniques, has also indicated the existence of 10 trans-membrane segments in catalytic subunits of the higher type II P-type pumps (4Møller J.V. Juul B. Le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). In addition, unexpected features such thermal instability of the C-terminal domain has been described (5Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D.

Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), direct determination is lacking. Covalent cross-linking experiments are beginning to provide information on proximities between trans-membrane helices (8Rice W.J. Green N.M. Maclennan D.H. J. Biol.

The β subunit stabilizes the α subunit and is required for functional expression of the pump at the plasma membrane (12Geering K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 13Chow D.-C. Forte J.D. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, α-β interactions affect kinetic properties of the pump (e.g. Refs. 14Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.-D. J. Gen.

Site-directed mutagenesis indicates an important role of several extracellular regions or residues of the β subunit (19Noguchi S. Mutoh Y. Kawamura M.

Thus, again, direct information on interacting regions of subunits is necessary. Metal-catalyzed oxidative cleavage is a popular technique for footprinting nucleic acids (22Sigman D.S. Chen C.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 62: 797-821Google Scholar) and is now being used for mapping proteins (23Chou W.-Y. Tsai W.-P. Lin C.-C. Chang G.-C. J. Biol.

Metal-catalyzed cleavage of proteins often involves site-specific mechanisms in which only peptide bonds close to bound metals are cleaved (26Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar, 27Platis I.E. Ermacora M.R. Fox R.A.

Recently we have used this approach to demonstrate specific Fe2+-catalyzed cleavage of the α subunit of Na,K-ATPase (1Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9596-9601Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The experiments indicate that peptide bonds are cleaved with a probability depending on their proximity to a Fe3+ or Fe2+ ion bound at the cytoplasmic surface and provide information on the organization of cytoplasmic domains in E1 and E2 conformations. This paper describes a different application of the technique, namely Cu2+/ascorbate/H2O22-catalyzed oxidative cleavage of Na,K-ATPase at the extracellular surface. These cleavages provide information on interacting regions of α and β subunits, organization of trans-membrane segments, and functional effects. Na,K-ATPase, with specific activities 12–17 units/mg of protein, was prepared from pig kidney (29Jøgensen P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and was stored at −70 °C in a solution of 250 mm sucrose, 25 mmhistidine, pH 7.2, and 1 mm EDTA (Tris). Right side-out renal microsomes were prepared as described (5Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8668-8679Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Before use, the sealed vesicles were dialyzed for 5 h at 20 °C and overnight at 4 °C against a solution containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, in order to remove trapped K+ ions, histidine, and EDTA Suspensions of renal Na,K-ATPase or microsomes (0.1–1 mg/ml) were incubated at 20 °C with freshly prepared solutions of 4–16 mm ascorbate (Tris) plus 4–16 mm H2O2, without or with added CuCl2 or other metals. To arrest the reaction, 5–10 mm EDTA or 5-fold concentrated gel sample buffer with 5 mm EDTA was added. Samples were assayed for Na,K-ATPase activity, Rb+ occlusion, or applied to gels, respectively. Control or cleaved microsomes were washed twice in a medium containing 10 mmTris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. 0.1–1 units of PNGase F per μg of microsomal protein was added, and the mixture incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Sample buffer was then added. Procedures for running of 10% Tricine, SDS-PAGE (25–45 μg of protein per lane), electroblotting to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) paper, and immunoblots have been described (5Goldshleger R.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For quantification of the α subunit, the band was cut out of the gel, and optical density of Coomassie stain was extracted into 1% SDS solution and was measured at 595 nm (1Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9596-9601Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For preparation of anti-β subunit antibodies, we used previously characterized fragments from “19-kDa membranes” (30Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as follows: 1) 16-kDa (Ala5–Arg142anti-N-terminal) and 2) ≈50-kDa fragments (Gly143–Ser302, anti-C-terminal). Bands were cut out of stained gels, extracted, and protein precipitated (32Or E. Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6853-6864Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and aliquots of ∼200 μg were used per injection into rabbits (31Grossman Z. Ram D. Markovics A. Tarrab-Hazdai R.

Na,K-ATPase and Rb+ occlusion activity of microsomes was assayed after demasking with deoxycholate (5Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D.

The medium contained 250 mm sucrose, 25 mm histidine, pH 7.2, and 1 mm EDTA (Tris), 0.25–2 mm RbCl (plus 86Rb), about 100 μg of vesicle protein treated or not treated with 1 mm ouabain, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm Pi(Tris). Rb+ occlusion represents the ouabain-inhibited fraction of 86Rb binding (about 50% at 0.5 mmRbCl). For SDS-PAGE all reagents were electrophoresis-grade from Bio-Rad. Tris (ultra pure) was from Bio-Labs, Jerusalem. l-(+)-Ascorbic acid (catalog number 100127) and 30% H2O2 (catalog number 822287) were from Merck. PNGase F recombinant was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Fig. 1 presents the basic finding that micromolar concentrations of Cu2+ ions, together with ascorbate and H2O2, catalyze specific cleavages of the α subunit at the extracellular surface. The α subunit and its fragments were visualized in immunoblots to detect C-terminal residues (anti-KETYY). As we have described recently (1Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9596-9601Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), incubation of renal Na,K-ATPase with ascorbate plus H2O2produces five specific cleavages of the α subunit, catalyzed by contaminant Fe2+ or Fe3+ ions (Fig.1 A, A/HP, asterisks). Addition of Fe2+ ions amplifies these cleavages (1Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9596-9601Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), but addition of many other metals, including Cu2+ ions, does not affect these cleavages during short incubations. However, we now find (Fig.1 A, A/HP, Cu2+) that longer incubations of renal Na,K-ATPase with ascorbate/H2O2 and added Cu2+ ions (10 μm) produce specific cleavage of the α subunit to two major fragments, 13.6 and 12.3 kDa, and also reduces intensity of the Fe2+-catalyzed fragments (see “Discussion”). Prolonged incubation with ascorbate/H2O2/Cu2+ led to the appearance of a variety of additional minor fragments and general degradation of the protein (see also Fig. 1 B,+DOC). The 13.6- and 12.3-kDa fragments were also detected by Coomassie stain, in addition to the Fe2+-catalyzed cleavage fragments, but attempts to sequence them after transfer to PVDF were unsuccessful (not shown). By comparison with known chymotryptic or tryptic fragments (see Fig.2 A, Chy, and see Ref. 5Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8668-8679Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the N termini of the 13.6- and 12.3-kDa fragments were predicted to lie at the extracellular surface. Therefore, the sidedness of the cleavages was tested directly using right side-out oriented renal microsomes (5Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8668-8679Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), Fig. 1 B. A minor fraction (≈5%) of microsomes was open judged by the effect of deoxycholate in demasking Na,K-ATPase activity. Incubation of intact microsomes (Fig.1 B,−DOC) with ascorbate/H2O2 produced minor cleavages, characteristic of fragments catalyzed by the contaminant Fe3+ ions. Presumably these occurred in the ≈5% of open vesicles. In the presence of 10 μm Cu2+ the prominent 13.6- and 12.3-kDa fragments appeared, showing directly that they are products of extracellular cleavages. Following permeabilization of microsomes with deoxycholate (Fig. 1 B,+DOC), incubation with ascorbate/H2O2 alone led to extensive Fe2+-catalyzed cleavages, showing that these occur at the cytoplasmic surface. Incubation of permeabilized vesicles with ascorbate/H2O2 plus Cu2+ produced the 13.6-kDa fragment but also extensive degradation of the protein due presumably to access of the Cu2+ ions to the cytoplasmic surface and nonspecific Cu2+-catalyzed cleavages.Figure 2Characterization of Cu2+-catalyzed cleavages.

Incubation with ascorbate/H2O2and increasing Cu2+ concentrations led to a roughly parallel increase in the major 13.6- and 12.3-kDa fragments and also to several minor fragments (6.5, 7.8, and 21 kDa and higher molecular masses, see asterisks) and a smear of antibody staining, see Fig. 2 A. By comparison with known chymotryptic fragments (N termini, Arg880, Glu902, Gln939, and Arg972) produced by cleavage at the extracellular surface (Chy, see Ref. 5Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8668-8679Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) the N termini of the 13.6- and 12.3-kDa fragments can be assigned quite closely. Their N termini are located just before and just after that of the chymotryptic fragment with N terminus Glu902, i.e. they lie within a stretch of about 10 residues, Tyr895–Lys905, located within the extracellular loop L7/8. The minor 7.8- and 6.5-kDa fragments are slightly larger or smaller, respectively, than the known chymotryptic fragment (N terminus Arg972) produced by cleavage of the extracellular loop L9/10 (5Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8668-8679Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and thus they too must be the products of cleavage within L9/10. The minor 21-kDa fragment is a product of an extracellular cleavage in L5/6 (see below). The other minor higher molecular weight fragments (asterisks) and the general degradation of the protein are the results of non-selective Cu2+-catalyzed cleavages at the cytoplasmic surface in open vesicles. This inference is based on similar observations of digestion of purified (non-sided) Na,K-ATPase with ascorbate/H2O2 and 10 μmCu2+ mentioned above. Use of other antibodies complements the information provided by anti-KETYY (Fig. 2 B). Anti-Leu815–Gln828, which recognizes a sequence thought to lie within M6 and the cytoplasmic loop L6/7, stains three fragments, the 21-kDa and also 91- and 7.2-kDa fragments. Anti-Leu815–Gln828 does not stain the 13.6-, 12.3-, 7.8-, and 6.5-kDa fragments recognized by anti-KETYY, because their N termini lie downstream of this epitope. Staining of the 21-kDa fragment by anti-Leu815–Gln828 shows that the cleavage site lies upstream of the epitope and, together with the apparent M r value, provides a strong indication that this fragment is a product of an extracellular cleavage between M5 and M6 (L5/6). The 91-kDa fragment(s) stained by anti-Leu815–Gln828 complements the major 13.6- and 12.3-kDa fragments from the N terminus of the α subunit (see “Discussion” for a comment on the 7.2-kDa fragment). Anti-Asn889–Glu902, which recognizes a sequence in L7/8 located just before M8, stains the 21-kDa and major 13.6- and 12.3-kDa fragments, detected with anti-KETYY, but not the 7.8- and 6.5-kDa fragments because their N termini lie downstream of the epitope. Anti-Asn889–Glu902 does not stain the 91-kDa fragment(s), recognized by anti-Leu815–Gln828, because the C terminus lies upstream of the epitope. Fig. 2 C presents a time course with parallel appearance of 13.6- and 12.3-kDa fragments and also detection of the minor 21-, 7.5-, and 6.5 -kDa fragments. Fig.2 D shows that, of the heavy metals ions Cu2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, or Ni2+ added to the medium, only Cu2+ ions were able to catalyze the specific extracellular cleavages. Other experiments showed that the Cu2+-catalyzed cleavages were not significantly affected by OH radical scavengers (formate,t-butyl alcohol, or mannitol at 20 mm). Also no significant differences were found in the presence of Na+, Rb+, Pi + Mg, or Pi + Mg + ouabain (not shown). The findings in Figs. 1 and 2 lead to the hypothesis that Cu2+ ions catalyze cleavage of the α subunit from a specific binding site. As a test of this hypothesis we have examined whether Cu2+ ions induce cleavage of the β subunit, which is known to interact strongly with the α subunit in L7/8 (17Famborough D.M. Lemas M.V. Hamrick M. Renaud K.J. Inman E.M. Hwang B. Takeyasu K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C579-C589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Colonna T.E. Huynh L. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12366-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The experiment in Fig. 3 used antibodies that recognize either the N- or C-terminal halves of the β subunit (Fig. 3). Fragments of the β subunit were visualized better after deglycosylation. Large amounts of PNGase were used, but deglycosylation, although extensive, was usually incomplete, and three bands with none, one, and two remaining sugar chains were usually observed (lanes A/HP). After treatment with Cu2+/ascorbate/H2O2 two fragments were clearly recognized by both sets of antibodies (A/HP, +Cu2+). The Cu2+ concentration dependence and time course of appearance of both fragments were similar to those for cleavages of the α subunit (not shown). M rvalues of the intact deglycosylated β subunit and deglycosylated fragments are presented in Table I. (No significant difference in M r values of fragments was detected in experiments with incomplete deglycosylation (Fig. 3) or complete deglycosylation (Fig. 4).) The 22.3-kDa (N-terminal) plus 11.5-kDa (C-terminal) peptides represent one set and the 10.2- (N-terminal) plus 21.8-kDa (C-terminal) peptides a second set of complementary fragments. Since the apparentM r of the deglycosylated β subunit based on SDS-PAGE (34.7 ± 1.13 kDa) is close to the true value (34.97 kDa), the same is likely to be true for the cleaved fragments. In support of this hypothesis, a tryptic fragment of the β subunit, Ala5–Arg142, with trueM r 16,053, runs with an apparent mass of 16 kDa (30Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, using both sets of values in Table I and sequence data, the first cleavage site can be located between residues 90 and 115, before the first S-S bridge (Cys125–Cys148), and the second cleavage site between residues 194 and 205, between the second (Cys158–Cys174) and third (Cys212–Cys275) S-S bridges. The larger fragment has the same electrophoretic mobility in reducing and non-reducing conditions (not shown). This observation implies that the more C-terminal cleavage is not located within an S-S bridge, and confirms its location between the second and third S-S bridge.Table IApparent Mr values of the deglycosylated β subunit and its fragmentskDa ± S.E.Intact β subunit34.7 ± 1.13 (n = 10)N-terminal fragments10.2 ± 0.5 (n = 4)22.3 ± 0.8 (n = 5)C-terminal fragments21.8 ± 1.1 (n = 5)11.5 ± 0.6 (n = 5) Open table in a new tab Figure 4Effect of thermal denaturation on Cu2+-catalyzed cleavage of α and β subunits.Native microsomes or microsomes heated to 55 °C for 30 min (denatured) were incubated with ascorbate/H2O2without or with 5 μm CuCl2 for 5 min. The blots were probed with anti-KETYY or anti-β (C-terminal) antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Another test for a site-specific mechanism exploited thermal denaturation (Fig. 4). Heating of microsomes to 55 °C inactivates Na,K-ATPase and exposes the cytoplasmic loop L8/9 and also the β subunit to proteases at the extracellular surface (5Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8668-8679Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Site-specific cleavage should be prevented by thermal disorganization, whereas cleavages dependent on random interactions of OH radicals or several sites for Cu2+ ions might be amplified. The experiment utilized anti-KETYY (Fig. 4 A) and the anti-β (C-terminal) antibodies (Fig. 4 B). The experiment using anti-KETYY is complicated by the fact that heating itself exposes L7/8 to an endogenous protease and appearance of a fragment of 14.5 kDa (described in Fig. 9 of Ref. 5Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8668-8679Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, Denatured −Cu). Nevertheless it is clear that, after heating, incubation with ascorbate/H2O2/Cu2+ produced neither the 12.3-kDa nor the 7.8- and 6.5-kDa fragments (Denatured +Cu). The experiment in Fig. 4 B using anti-β is clear cut because the endogenous protease does not digest the β subunit. In this case, after heating to 55 °C, Cu2+-catalyzed cleavage of the β subunit did not occur (compare Native and Denatured +Cu). In short, disorganization of structure prevents specific Cu2+-catalyzed cleavages in L7/8, L9/10, and the β subunit. Fig. 5 A shows that incubation of microsomes with Cu2+/ascorbate/H2O2 inactivated Na,K-ATPase slightly faster than cleavage of the α subunit. A similar phenomenon has been observed for Fe2+-catalyzed cleavage (1Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9596-9601Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 B shows that Rb+ occlusion was also inactivated by ascorbate/H2O2/Cu2+. Inactivation of Rb+ occlusion appeared to be a little less sensitive than inactivation of Na,K-ATPase over this range of Cu2+ concentrations but the difference is within the experimental error. From Fig. 5 B and similar experiments, we estimate K 0.5 for Cu2+ of 1–2 μm for inactivating Na,K-ATPase and Rb+occlusion. Fig. 6 presents a topological model of α and β subunits, positions of Cu2+-catalyzed extracellular cleavages (arrows), and Fe2+-catalyzed cytoplasmic cleavages (asterisks). The proposal of a site-specific mechanism of Cu2+-catalyzed cleavage, which implies proximity of L7/8, L9/10, and the β subunit, is based on the following: (a) the specificity of cleavage of both α and β subunits (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3); (b) sideness of action of Cu2+ ions (Figs. 1 and2); (c) similar time course and Cu2+concentration dependence of appearance of the various fragments (Fig.2); (d) suppression of cleavages in α and β subunits after thermal inactivation (Fig. 4); and (e) insensitivity to OH radical scavengers. This mechanism assumes that the bound Cu2+ ion catalyzes oxidative cleavages of peptide bonds with a probability depending on their spatial arrangement and proximity to the Cu2+ ion. Since the major cleavage sites are located in L7/8, presumably the Cu2+ ion binds primarily within this loop, makes contact with the two interacting regions of the β subunit, and to a lesser extent with L9/10, Cu2+, or Cu+ ions are usually ligated by cysteine, methionine, or histidine residues. Candidate residues at the extracellular surface of the α subunit include His875 (L7/8), Cys911(M8), His912 (M8), Cys964 (M9), and Cys983 (M10). The evidence on L5/6 (open arrow) is less clear cut. The minor 7.2-kDa fragment recognized by anti-Leu815–Gln828 (Fig. 2 B) must be the product of two splits, one in L5/6 and the other in L7/8. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that the split in L5/6 is mediated by a different Cu2+ ion from that which catalyzes all other splits. Site-specific Cu2+-mediated cleavage of peptide bonds may involve a Cu2+-peroxyl intermediate (24Wu J. Perrin D.M. Sigman D. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9186-9190Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) or locally generated OH radicals (27Platis I.E. Ermacora M.R. Fox R.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12761-12767Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 28Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). Cleavage can lead to fragments with C-terminal amide and N-terminal ketoacyl derivatives (α-amidation pathway) (28Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). Blocked N termini preclude sequencing by Edman degradation. Alternatively (diamide pathway), cleavage can produce fragments, with C-terminal diamides and N-terminal isocyanate derivatives that are hydrolyzed to generate free N termini, thus permitting sequencing (23Chou W.-Y. Tsai W.-P. Lin C.-C. Chang G.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25935-25941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Platis I.E. Ermacora M.R. Fox R.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12761-12767Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The fact that the 13.6- and 12.3-kDa fragments gave no sequence is compatible with the α-amidation pathway. Cu2+ ions also catalyze site-specific oxidative modification of side chains without cleavage (26Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar, 28Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). This phenomenon could explain faster rates of enzyme inactivation compared with chain cleavage (see Fig. 5 A and see Ref. 1Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9596-9601Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Sites of oxidative modification and chain cleavage are presumed to be close to each other since both are catalyzed by the bound metal. The two major Cu2+ cleavage sites in L7/8 of the α subunit, within the sequence approximately 895–905, are very close to the residues894SYGQ shown to be crucial for α-β interactions (18Colonna T.E. Huynh L. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12366-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Identification of the two Cu2+ cleavage sites in the β subunit should thus indicate which residues interact with the α subunit. These two points are located within residues approximately 90–115, before the S-S bridge (Cys125—Cys148), and residues approximately 194–205, between the second (Cys158–Cys174) and third (Cys212–Cys275) S-S bridges. The yeast two-hybrid work (18Colonna T.E. Huynh L. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12366-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) also pointed to residues 63–125 of the β subunit as a region of α-β interaction. Recently, similar experiments for H,K-ATPase (33Melle-Milovanovic D. Milovanovic M. Nagpal S. Sachs G. Shin J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11075-11081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have pointed to two regions of interaction of the β subunit (64–126, and 156–188), similar to those found in this work. Note, however, that unlike the two-hybrid system, Cu2+-catalyzed cleavages reveal interacting segments of the native protein. Cleavages in L5/6 and L9/10 (21- or 7.8- and 6.5-kDa fragments, respectively) demonstrate that these loops reach the extracellular surface. Previously an extracellular location of L9/10 has been demonstrated only for denatured protein (5Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8668-8679Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For Na,K-ATPase the location of L5/6 has not been demonstrated, although that of H,K-ATPase has been demonstrated by omeprazole labeling of Cys813 and Cys822 (34Besancon M. Simon A. Sachs G. Shin J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22438-22446Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Comparison of the location of Cu2+- and Fe2+-catalyzed cleavages suggests that the two sets of cleavages demarcate separate domains. One domain includes M1–M6 and major cytoplasmic loops, whereas the other includes M7–M10 of the α subunit and the β subunit. (Reduction of anti-KETYY staining of the Fe2+-catalyzed cleavage fragments by Cu2+-catalyzed cleavages near the C-terminal (Fig. 1) implies that Fe2+- and Cu2+-catalyzed cleavages occur on the same molecule and emphasizes the separateness of the two domains.) A division of structure into two domains has also been proposed on the basis of sequence comparisons of type I heavy metal pumps and the type II higher P-type pumps. Type I pumps contain the equivalent of the first six segments and the conserved cytoplasmic regions (and two extra N-terminal trans-membrane segments), whereas type II pumps contain the extra four C-terminal segments (4Møller J.V. Juul B. Le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 35Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Thus, M1–M6 with the cytoplasmic loops may constitute a core structure for ion transport (M4–M6) and energy transduction, whereas M7/M10 of higher pumps evolved to serve additional functions (4Møller J.V. Juul B. Le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 35Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). A further indication for compact folding of the M7–M10 domain comes from the observation of high resistance to proteolytic digestion of the C-terminal fragment (M7–M10) of Na,K-ATPase (30Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4566-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and H,K-ATPase (36Shin J.M. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8642-8646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the cryoelectron microscope studies of Ca-ATPase and H-ATPase show directly that the organization of the trans-membrane segments is non-uniform (2Zhang P. Toyashima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 3Auer M. Scarborough G.A. Kühlbrandt W. Nature. 1998; 392: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). These indications for a domain organization provide an important constraint on spatial arrangement of trans-membrane segments. For example, compact folding of M7/M10 segments makes it unlikely that M7 and M8 are widely separated, although the relatively long connecting loop (≈40 residues) could, in principle, allow such a separation. Based on this constraint of domain organization, as well as specific evidence on proximity of trans-membrane segments (8Rice W.J. Green N.M. Maclennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31412-31419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 9Or E. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26528-26532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar),1we have recently proposed a model for the approximate spatial organization of the trans-membrane segments of α and β subunits (41Goldshleger R. Bar Shimon M. Or E. Karlish S.J.D. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 163: 89-97Google Scholar). Since L7/8 is by far the major site of Cu2+-catalyzed cleavage (and presumably Cu2+-catalyzed oxidative modification of side chains), inactivation of Rb+ occlusion and Na,K-ATPase can be attributed to structural perturbation in this loop. Cation occlusion sites are located within the membrane, particularly within M4, M5, and M6 (37Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4566-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 38Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13523-13530Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 39Nielsen J.M. Pedersen P.A. Karlish S.J.D. Jøgensen P.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1961-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus our findings imply a close connection between L7/8 and M4, M5, or M6. The interaction could occur at the membrane surface or within the membrane, if L7/8 is a re-entrant loop (7Fiedler B. Scheiner-Bobis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29312-29320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The present findings also supply an economical explanation of inactivation of Na,K-ATPase or Rb+ occlusion by reduction of S-S bridges in the β subunit (11Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.K.

These effects are probably mediated indirectly via perturbation of the α-β interaction in L7/8 and the interaction of L7/8 with M4, M5, and M6. Thus an important role of the β subunit may be to maintain L7/8 in the correct disposition with respect to M4, M5, and M6. We thank Drs. J. Kyte, University of California, San Diego, and J. V.

To facilitate the purification, we have developed an effective scheme that allows human TFIIH and pol II to be isolated from HeLa-derived cell lines that conditionally express the FLAG-tagged p62 subunit of human TFIIH and the RPB9 subunit of human pol II, respectively. An approximate 2000-fold enrichment of FLAG-tagged TFIIH and a 1000-fold enhancement of total pol II are achieved by a one-step immunoaffinity purification. The purified complexes are functional in mediating basal and activated transcription, regardless of whether TATA-binding protein or TFIID is used as the TATA-binding factor. Interestingly, repression of basal transcription by the positive cofactor PC4 is alleviated by increasing amounts of TFIID, TFIIH, and pol II holoenzyme, suggesting that phosphorylation of PC4 by these proteins may cause a conformational change in the structure of PC4 that allows for preinitiation complex formation and initiation of transcription. Furthermore, pol II complexes with different phosphorylation states on the carboxyl-terminal domain of the largest subunit are selectively purified from the inducible pol II cell line, making it possible to dissect the role of carboxyl-terminal domain phosphorylation in the transcription process in a highly defined in vitrotranscription system.

In vitro, RNA polymerase II (pol II)1 in association with general transcription factors (GTFs) TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH are capable of supporting basal transcription from most eukaryotic promoters (1Orphanides G.

The previously defined GTF, TFIIA, has recently been shown to function as a coactivator in a highly purified cell-free transcription system devoid of the pol II-specific TBP-associated factors (TAFIIs) of TFIID, human mediator and other negative cofactors (3Wu S.-Y. Kershnar E. Chiang C.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4478-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The GTFs and pol II can assemble on a class II promoter via the sequential assembly pathway (1Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D.

In the sequential assembly pathway, TFIID, a multiprotein complex comprising TBP and TAFIIs, binds to the TATA box in the promoter region allowing for the recruitment of TFIIB, which then acts as a molecular bridge in recruiting the pol II·TFIIF complex. Next, TFIIE binds to pol II and in turn recruits TFIIH. Although the GTFs and pol II are able to support basal transcription in cell-free transcription systems, many other protein factors are also involved in vivo. These proteins work collectively in defining the efficiency of transcriptional initiation, elongation, and termination of eukaryotic genes transcribed by pol II. pol II is composed of 10–12 polypeptides ranging in size from 220 to 7 kDa, depending on the source of purification (11Young R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 689-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 12Acker J. de Graaff M. Cheynel I. Khazak V. Kedinger C. Vigneron M. J. Biol.

The subunits of human pol II (or RNA polymerase B) have been defined as RPB1 (220 kDa), RPB2 (140 kDa), RPB3 (33 kDa), RPB4 (18 kDa), RPB5 (28 kDa), RPB6 (19 kDa), RPB7 (27 kDa), RPB8 (17 kDa), RPB9 (14.5 kDa), RPB10α (or RPB12, 7.0 kDa), RPB10β (or RPB10, 7.6 kDa), and RPB11 (14 kDa) (3Wu S.-Y.

RPB5, RPB6, RPB8, RPB10α, and RPB10β are shared by all three eukaryotic RNA polymerases, whereas the rest of the RPB components are unique to pol II (11Young R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 689-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 14Treich I. Carles C. Riva M. Sentenac A. Gene Exp. 1992; 2: 31-37PubMed Google Scholar). The two large subunits, RPB1 and RPB2, show sequence similarity with the β′ and β subunits of bacterial RNA polymerase, respectively (11Young R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 689-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), and form an extended DNA-binding channel that surrounds the transcription start site (15Kim T.K. Lagrange T. Wang Y.H.

Edwards A.M. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In humans, RPB3 and RPB5 can each homodimerize and interact with almost all of the other subunits in vitro, suggesting that RPB3 and RPB5 may play a role in the assembly of pol II (12Acker J. de Graaff M. Cheynel I. Khazak V. Kedinger C. Vigneron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16815-16821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, the isolation of an RPB3-deficient yeast pol II indicates that RPB3, which shares sequence similarity with the α subunit of prokaryotic RNA polymerase, is dispensable for complex assembly in vivo(17Svetlov V. Nolan K. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10827-10830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The finding that human RPB5 can functionally interact with the pX protein of the hepatitis B virus and with TFIIB also suggests that RPB5 may act as a bridging factor between pol II and regulatory proteins (18Cheong J. Yi M. Lin Y. Murakami S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 19Haviv I. Shamay M. Doitsh G. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1562-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In yeast, RPB4 and RPB7 form a dissociable subcomplex, which is preferentially incorporated into pol II during stationary phase induced by heat shock or nutrient stress (20Choder M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6984-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Structural comparison and surface plasmon resonance measurements between wild type and RPB4/RPB7-deficient yeast pol II complexes suggest that RPB4 and RPB7 help stabilize the preinitiation complex on the promoter DNA under stress response in vivo (21Jensen G.J. Meredith G. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). RPB9 is required for correct start site selection, as mutations in yeast RPB9 cause a shift in the transcription start site (22Hull M.W. McKune K. Woychik N.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a suppressor mutation in RPB9 is able to compensate for the downstream shift in start site selection associated with TFIIB mutants, indicating that RPB9 can functionally interact with TFIIB in specifying the accurate transcription start site (23Sun Z.W. Tessmer A. Hampsey M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2560-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, RPB9 seems to influence the efficiency of pol II elongation via its recognition of a pause signal on the DNA template (24Awrey D.E. Weilbaecher R.G. Hemming S.A. Orlicky S.M. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14747-14754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although the genes coding for the subunits of pol II from humans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, andSchizosaccharomyces pombe have been cloned, sequenced, and all subunits excluding RPB4 and RPB9 have been shown to be essential in yeast (25Woychik N.A. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2854-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 26Woychik N.A. Lane W.S. Young R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19053-19055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the function of many pol II subunits remains unanswered. Immunoprecipitation of 32P-labeled yeast extracts indicated that three of the pol II subunits, RPB1, RPB2, and RPB6, are phosphorylated in vivo (27Kolodziej P.A. Woychik N. Liao S.M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The largest subunit of pol II, RPB1, contains consensus heptapeptide repeats of Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser in its carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) that occur 26 times in yeast and 52 times in humans (28Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the CTD results in a hyperphosphorylated form of RPB1 (IIo), which is mostly found in actively elongating pol II complexes (28Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 29Dahmus M.E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3279-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The pol II complex containing an unmodified or hypophosphorylated form of RPB1 (IIa) interacts with TBP, TFIIE, and mediator, and is preferentially assembled into a functional preinitiation complex (PIC) on the promoter (28Dahmus M.E.

In addition, a third form of pol II containing RPB1 without the CTD (IIb), presumably due to limited proteolysis, has also been identified (29Dahmus M.E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 143-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the CTD is a necessary step during the transition from the PIC to a stable elongation complex in many but not all promoters (35Serizawa H. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Nature. 1993; 363: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 36O'Brien T. Hardin S. Greenleaf A. Lis J.T. Nature. 1994; 370: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Many protein kinases such as casein kinases I and II, cdc2 kinase, DNA-dependent protein kinase, c-Abl tyrosine kinase, mitogen-activated kinases ERK1 and ERK2, cdk8-cyclin C, P-TEFb, and TFIIH are able to phosphorylate the CTD on different phosphoacceptors (29Dahmus M.E.

Although the exact phosphorylation sites of the CTD are not clear in vivo, the CTD has been shown to be highly phosphorylated mostly at the serines in the second and fifth position, as well as at the tyrosine and threonine residues (29Dahmus M.E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 143-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 38Baskaran R. Dahmus M.E. Wang J.Y.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genetics. 1995; 140: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that substrate specificity and temporal phosphorylation by various CTD kinases may functionally regulate pol II activity to selectively activate or suppress specific gene expression (40Hengartner C.J. Myer V.E. Liao S.-M. Wilson C.J. Koh S.S. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 44Lee D.-K. Lis J.T. Nature. 1998; 393: 389-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). One of the factors responsible for CTD phosphorylation is TFIIH, which preferentially phosphorylates a serine residue located in the fifth position of an oligomerized heptapeptide CTD sequence (39Trigon S. Serizawa H. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Jackson S.P. Morange M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6769-6775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 40Hengartner C.J. Myer V.E. Liao S.-M. Wilson C.J. Koh S.S. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). TFIIH is a large protein complex, composed of at least nine subunits (p89, p80, p62, p52, p44, p40 (cdk7), p36 (cyclin H), p34, and p32 (MAT1)), that has ATP-dependent DNA helicase, ATPase, protein kinase, and nucleotide-excision repair activities (reviewed in Ref.45Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.-M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 346-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The two large subunits of TFIIH, p89 and p80, unwind the DNA in a 3′ → 5′ and 5′ → 3′ direction, respectively, making TFIIH a bidirectional DNA helicase (46Schaeffer L. Moncollin V. Roy R. Staub A. Mezzina M. Sarasin A. Weeda G. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Egly J.-M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2388-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in the yeast homologs of human p89/ERCC3/XPB (SSL2), p80/ERCC2/XPD (RAD3), p62 (TFB1), p52 (TFB2), and p44 (SSL1) also cause a defect in nucleotide excision repair, indicating that TFIIH is involved in the coupling of transcription and DNA repair (reviewed in Refs. 45Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.-M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 346-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 47Sancar A. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19319-19327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of TFIIH resides in the catalytic subunit cdk7, whose activity is modulated by cyclin H, MAT1, and other protein factors such as TFIIE and the mediator complex (reviewed in Ref. 45Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.-M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 346-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). cdk7 also forms a subcomplex, called CAK (cdk-activatingkinase), with cyclin H and MAT1. When associated with the other TFIIH components, CAK more efficiently phosphorylates the CTD, as compared with the free form of CAK (49Yankulov K.Y. Bentley D.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In addition to phosphorylating the CTD, cdk7 is required for mitosis and for the activation of many cdk/cyclin pairs involved in cell cycle progression (50Larochelle S. Pandur J. Fisher R.P. Salz H.K. Suter B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 51Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activities of TFIIH are also involved in the transcription process. The ATP-dependent helicase activity of TFIIH is required for the opening of the promoter DNA surrounding the transcription start site, as well as the maintenance of the open complex (52Jiang Y. Yan M. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27332-27338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 53Holstege F.C.P. Fiedler U. Timmers H.T.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7468-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Formation of the first phosphodiester bond is not necessarily dependent on TFIIH, but is stimulated by its presence (54Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 77: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar,55Kumar K.P. Akoulitchev S. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9767-9772Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, TFIIH and ATP hydrolysis are clearly required for release of pol II from the promoter region (53Holstege F.C.P. Fiedler U. Timmers H.T.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7468-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 54Goodrich J.A. Tjian R.

A. 1997; 94: 9006-9010Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the absence of TFIIH, pol II tends to stall on the promoter-proximal region, leading to abortive transcription products (55Kumar K.P. Akoulitchev S. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The amount of the promoter-stalled pol II complex, nevertheless, is significantly reduced in the presence of TFIIH in an ATP-dependent manner (55Kumar K.P. Akoulitchev S. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9767-9772Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,58Dvir A. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9006-9010Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A stably elongating pol II complex often requires a hyperphosphorylated CTD that occurs subsequent to PIC assembly (28Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The CTD kinase activity of TFIIH can be further stimulated by transcriptional activators that functionally interact with TFIIH (41Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In addition to its central role in the transition from the initiation to the elongation phase, TFIIH can also function as a coactivator in supporting TBP-mediated activation, independent of TAFIIs (3Wu S.-Y. Kershnar E. Chiang C.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4478-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To define the molecular mechanism of pol II and TFIIH in the transcription process and to overcome the difficulty in purifying these two multiprotein complexes by conventional chromatography, we have developed an effective method for the purification of human pol II and TFIIH. By using epitope-tagging and stable cell line approaches, we are able to purify nearly homogeneous preparations of human pol II and TFIIH by a one-step immunoaffinity purification. The purified multiprotein complexes contain all previously defined polypeptides and are devoid of other GTFs commonly copurified with pol II and TFIIH by traditional approaches. In conjunction with other protein factors and cofactors, the immunoaffinity-purified pol II and TFIIH are able to mediate both basal and activator-dependent transcription in a cell-free system reconstituted with either TBP or TFIID. Interestingly, in this highly purified in vitrotranscription system, repression of basal transcription by the positive cofactor PC4 can be alleviated by increasing amounts of TFIIH, TFIID, and a preassembled pol II holoenzyme complex but not by the other GTFs or pol II. We demonstrate that these multisubunit complexes can phosphorylate PC4, indicating that phosphorylation of PC4 by TFIID, TFIIH, or pol II holoenzyme may cause a conformational change in the structure of PC4 that allows for preinitiation complex formation and initiation of transcription. Furthermore, transcriptionally active pol II complexes enriched with either IIo or IIa forms of the CTD can be selectively isolated from the nuclear pellet of the inducible pol II cell line, providing a unique opportunity to dissect the role of CTD phosphorylation in the transcription process in a highly definedin vitro transcription system. A HeLa-derived cell line, F:62(H)-8, that conditionally expresses the FLAG-epitope tagged 62 kDa subunit of human TFIIH has been established (59Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.-M. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and used for the purification of FLAG-tagged human TFIIH. Approximately 125 ml of F:62(H)-8 cells were expanded in Joklik media supplemented with 5% calf serum, and selected with tetracycline (1 μg/ml) and G418 (0.6 mg/ml total weight) for 3 days. After further expansion to 12 liters in tetracycline-containing medium without G418, F:62(H)-8 cells were pelleted at 1000 rpm, washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (four times), and resuspended in 9 liters of Joklik medium containing 5% calf serum. Four days after protein induction, nuclear extracts (∼60 ml) were prepared from F:62(H)-8 cells (∼60 liters) as described (60Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) and loaded onto a 60-ml phosphocellulose column (P11, Whatman) at a flow rate of 1 column volume (CV)/h. The column was washed with 3 CV of BC100 buffer (20% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1.0 mm DTT, and 100 mm KCl) and step eluted with 2.5 CV each of BC300, BC500, and BC850 (61Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffman A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The 0.5 m KCl fraction (termed P.5) containing the majority of FLAG-tagged TFIIH was dialyzed against 4 liters of BC100 for 5 h, and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min to remove insoluble materials. FLAG-tagged TFIIH in the P.5 supernatant was further concentrated by the addition of solid (NH4)2SO4 to 38% saturation (0.23 g/ml) and pelleted at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. The pellet was then resuspended in BC100 (2 ml of BC100 for every 10 ml of P.5 that was precipitated) and dialyzed against 4 liters of BC100 for 5 h to remove residual ammonium sulfate. Immunoaffinity purification of FLAG-tagged TFIIH was then performed by incubating approximately 300 μl of anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody-conjugated agarose beads (Kodak/IBI) with 14 ml of nuclear extracts, 14 ml of the P.5 fraction, or 6 ml of the resuspended ammonium sulfate pellet at 4 °C for 6–12 h with constant rotation. The M2 agarose with bound proteins was sequentially washed five times each with BC300 plus 0.5 murea and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, BC100 (10 ml for each wash), and finally transferred to a 2-ml microcentrifuge spin column (Invitrogen). The bound proteins were incubated with 300 μl of BC100 plus 0.01% Nonidet P-40 containing 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide at 4 °C for 1 h with constant rotation (61Chiang C.-M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffman A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Elutions were repeated for a total of three times. Purified proteins were then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C after snap freezing in liquid nitrogen. To purify FLAG-tagged human pol II, the hRPB9–3 cell line that conditionally expresses the FLAG-tagged RPB9 subunit of human pol II (10Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12492-12498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was expanded to 60 liters with Joklik medium containing 5% calf serum as described above for the F:62(H)-8 cell line. Nuclear extract, cytoplasmic S100 fraction, and nuclear pellet were then prepared from the induced culture following the published protocols (60Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). To purify pol II from the soluble fractions, 60 ml of S100 (or nuclear extracts) was loaded onto a 60-ml phosphocellulose column and sequentially eluted with BC100, BC300, BC500, and BC850 as described above. Immunoaffinity purification of FLAG-tagged pol II was then conducted by incubating 14 ml of the S100 (or nuclear extracts) or P.5 fraction with 400 μl of M2-agarose as outlined above for FLAG-tagged TFIIH purification, except that BC850 plus 1.0 m urea and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 was used for the initial wash. To purify FLAG-tagged pol II from the chromosomal fraction, we adapted a previous procedure for initial pol II isolation (62Reinberg D. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3310-3321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 35 ml of the hRPB9–3 nuclear pellet was slowly agitated with 70 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9 at 4 °C, 25% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF) and then with 11 ml of 3 m(NH4)2SO4 to adjust the ammonium sulfate concentration to 0.3 m. The mixture was stirred for additional 30 min and then sonicated for 5 × 1 min with 20-s intervals. After spinning at 40,000 rpm for 90 min, the supernatant was adjusted to 0.1 m ammonium sulfate concentration by gradually adding 2 volumes of buffer B with syringe. The precipitated material was removed by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 60 min. pol II was then precipitated by adding solid ammonium sulfate to 65% saturation (i.e. 0.42 g/ml of suspension) a"

This reaction has been studied because of its possible role in the in vivo synthesis of psychoactive compounds or neurotoxins and has been characterized biochemically in preparations of rabbit lung. Therefore, we set out to purify rabbit lung INMT, to clone and express its cDNA, and to clone and structurally characterize its gene as steps toward understanding the function and regulation of this enzyme. Rabbit lung INMT was purified and partial amino acid sequence was obtained. A polymerase chain reaction-based approach was then used to clone a rabbit lung INMT cDNA with a 792-base pair open reading frame that encoded a 263-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 29 kDa. When the cDNA was expressed in COS-1 cells, the encoded protein catalyzed the methylation of tryptamine and structurally related compounds, and was inhibited by two products of the reaction,S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy) andN,N-dimethyltryptamine, as well as antimigraine drugs that are structurally related to N,N-dimethyltryptamine. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the presence of 2.0-kilobase mRNA species in rabbit lung, liver and, at lower levels, in brain. The cDNA was then used to clone the rabbit INMT gene. That gene had three exons and was structurally similar to the genes for nicotinamideN-methyltransferase and phenylethanolamineN-methyltransferase in several species.

Methylation is an important reaction in the metabolism of many drugs, other xenobiotics, and endogenous molecules (1Weinshilboum R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 43: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The methylation of tryptamine and structurally related compounds by a cytosolicS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet)1-dependent methyltransferase (MT) was first described in the rabbit lung over 30 years ago (2Axelrod J. Science. 1961; 134: 343Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). That reaction, with tryptamine as a substrate, is shown in Fig. 1. Interest in this reaction originally focused on the possible role of N-methylation in the metabolism of biogenic amines to form psychoactive agents such asN,N-dimethyltryptamine andN,N-dimethyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (2Axelrod J. Science. 1961; 134: 343Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Subsequently, there was also interest in the possibility that the N-methylation of compounds such as the β-carbolines and the isoquinolines might generate neurotoxins (3Naoi M. Matsuura S. Takahashi T. Nagatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 1213-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Collins M.A. Neafsey E.J. Matsubara K. Cobuzzi R.J. Rollema H.

Pietra G.D. J. Biochem. 1979; 10: 919-923Google Scholar) and rabbit liver (10Lyon E.S. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7531-7535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ansher S.S. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3996-4001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these activities have been referred to by a variety of names including rabbit lung MT (2Axelrod J. Science. 1961; 134: 343Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), nonspecific MT (2Axelrod J. Science. 1961; 134: 343Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), aromatic alkylamineN-MT (13Mandell A.J. Knapp S. Hsu L.L. Life Sci. 1974; 14: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), indolamine N-MT (9Porta R. Esposito C. Camardella M. Pietra G.D. J. Biochem. 1979; 10: 919-923Google Scholar, 14Bhikharidas B.

Chem. 1986; 261: 3996-4001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we will refer to the enzyme that we have studied as indolethylamine N-MT (INMT) (11Herman K.S. Bowsher R.R. Henry D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12336-12340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No cDNA for any of these activities or enzymes has been cloned and expressed to make it possible to associate the activity being studied with a single protein. Therefore, it has remained controversial whether tryptamine methylation is catalyzed by a single gene product with a broad substrate specificity or by a series of related enzymes. We set out to purify rabbit lung INMT, clone its cDNA, and clone and structurally characterize its gene to make it possible to study the function of this enzyme and to search for orthologues in other species, including humans. Since tryptamine had been used as a “prototypic” methyl acceptor substrate for most of the original biochemical studies of this activity, tryptamine was used as a substrate in our experiments. We studied the rabbit lung because of its high INMT specific activity and because of the extensive previous biochemical characterization of INMT activity in that tissue. The experimental strategy involved the purification of rabbit lung INMT to obtain partial amino acid sequence, followed by the application of a PCR-based approach to clone the cDNA. Use of that strategy resulted in the cloning of a rabbit lung INMT cDNA, followed by expression and biochemical characterization of the protein encoded by the cDNA. The cDNA was then used to clone the rabbit INMT gene. These results represent important steps toward understanding the function and regulation of INMT and will make it possible to seek orthologues in other species as well as related enzymes in the rabbit.

Dopamine HCl and tyramine HCl were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). SKF 525A was a gift from Dr. Russell Van Dyke (Mayo Clinic). Naratriptan, sumatriptan, and zolmitriptan were gifts from Glaxo Wellcome (Research Triangle Park, NC). The HCl salt of phenylethanolamine was prepared by refluxing with HCl, followed by recrystallization. Frozen rabbit lung tissue was purchased from Pel-Freez Biologicals (Rogers, AR) and was homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3 (1:2, w:v), with an Osterizer blender, followed by homogenization with a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkman Instruments, Inc., Westbury, NY). A 100,000 × g “high-speed supernatant” was then prepared as described previously (15Rini J. Szumlanski C. Guerciolini R. Weinshilboum R.M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1989; 186: 359-374Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The assay used to measure INMT activity during purification of the rabbit lung enzyme was a modification of procedures described by Lyon and Jakoby (10Lyon E.S. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7531-7535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Ansher and Jakoby (12Ansher S.S. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3996-4001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This assay utilized [14C-CH3]AdoMet as a methyl donor and tryptamine as the methyl acceptor substrate. The formation of 14C-methylated tryptamine was determined after incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 200 μl that contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 34 μm[14C-CH3]AdoMet (24 μCi/μmol), and 1 mm tryptamine. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 0.5 m potassium borate, pH 10. The reaction mixture was then added to 5 ml of Econofluor-2 (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT), vortexed, and radioactivity was measured in a Beckman LS6000 SC liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA). Blank samples contained no tryptamine. Activity increased in a linear fashion with both enzyme concentration and time of incubation under these reaction conditions. A modification of this assay was used to characterize substrates for INMT and to perform enzyme inhibition studies. For those experiments, the reaction mixture included 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and the incubation time was extended to 60 min, followed by extraction of the methylated product into 5 ml of 3% isoamyl alcohol in toluene by vortexing. After centrifugation, 3.5 ml of the organic phase was added to 5 ml of BioSafe II (Research Products International Corp., Mount Prospect, IL) prior to the determination of radioactivity. The intra-assay coefficient of variation for this modified assay was less than 2%. All results were corrected for quench and for partitioning of methylated tryptamine into the organic phase (68%). Assays for all substrate and inhibition experiments were performed in triplicate, and values reported are averages of triplicate determinations. Protein concentrations were measured with the dye binding assay of Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Rabbit lung high speed supernatant (284 ml) was subjected to DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B anion exchange chromatography in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, that contained 1 mmEDTA and 0.02% sodium azide. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a KCl gradient that varied from 0 to 0.4 m in the same buffer (Fig. 2 A). 14.5-ml fractions were collected, and the fraction that contained peak INMT activity was concentrated with an Amicon YM-10 membrane (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) and placed on a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column that was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, which contained 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.2 mm EDTA (Fig. 2 B). 15.5-ml fractions were collected from the Sephacryl S-200 column, and the fraction that contained peak INMT activity was concentrated with an Amicon YM-10 membrane prior to photoaffinity labeling. Partially purified rabbit lung INMT was photoaffinity labeled with 33 pmol of [3H-CH3]AdoMet (2.75 μCi) as described by Van Loon et al. (17Van Loon J.A. Szumlanski C.L. Weinshilboum R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 775-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Specifically, the reaction mixture was placed in a 96-well microtiter plate 6 cm below a horizontal 254-nm UV light source and photolysis was performed for 30 min at 4 °C. The sample was then precipitated with −20 °C high performance liquid chromatography grade acetone, centrifuged at 5900 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C, and the protein pellet was resuspended in 75 μl of urea sample buffer that contained 5 μl of creatine phosphokinase carbamylation standard (Pharmacia) prior to the subsequent isoelectric focusing step. This preparation was used to perform isoelectric focussing for 15 h at 750 V as described by O'Farrell (18O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isoelectric focusing tube gel was then placed on a 15% polyacrylamide-SDS gel, and electrophoresis was performed in the second dimension. The resulting gel was either stained with Coomassie Blue and photographed (Fig. 2 C), or was treated with the autoradiogram enhancer RESOLUTION™ (EM Corp, Chestnut Hill, MA) and was dried prior to autoradiography (Fig. 2 D). In some cases, gels were stained with the method of Rosenfeld et al. (19Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar) prior to proteolytic digestion and partial N-terminal amino acid sequencing which was performed in the Mayo Research Resource Protein Core Laboratory. The strategy used to clone a rabbit lung INMT cDNA is depicted schematically in Fig.3. Rabbit lung INMT amino acid sequences PEAEMLK and RNREELA were used to design degenerate forward (DF1) and reverse (DR1) primers for the PCR, respectively (Fig. 3, Step 1). The sequences of these and other oligonucleotide primers described subsequently are listed in Table I. The template for the initial amplification reaction was a rabbit lung 5′-STRETCH cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), and the reaction was performed with Thermus aquaticus (Taq) DNA polymerase in a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp PCR System 2400 thermal cycler (Foster City, CA). A 191-bp amplification product was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA), and sequenced after cloning into pCR2.1. Either the rabbit lung cDNA library or cDNA made from rabbit lung poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH) with Superscript II reverse transcriptase was then used to perform 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (20Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar) with rabbit lung INMT-specific primers paired with appropriate anchor primers (5′λgt, 3′λgt, dT25d(A/C/G), or dC15-adaptor) (Table I and Fig. 3, Steps 2–4). 5′-RACE experiments were also performed using cDNA with an anchor generated by the terminal transferase catalyzed addition of guanine nucleotides to the first strand cDNA. In this case, the anchor primer was the dC15-adaptor primer (Fig. 3, Step 4). Finally, the entire ORF, the 5′-UTR, and a portion of the 3′-UTR were amplified withrTth, XL DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) using F(−15) and R1391 as primers (Fig. 3, Step 5). This amplification product was sequenced on both strands.

Rabbit brain, liver, and lung poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH), approximately 2 μg per lane, was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Micron Separations Inc., Westboro, MA), and probed with the initial 350 bp of the rabbit lung INMT cDNA ORF that had been radioactively labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming performed with the Oligolabeling kit (Pharmacia). The Northern blot was then stripped and probed with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled human β-actin cDNA to make it possible to compare the loading of each lane. The rabbit lung INMT cDNA ORF was amplified by the use of cloned Pyrococcus furius(Pfu) DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with primer pair F1 and R792, and rabbit lung cDNA as a template. The amplification product obtained was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCR3.1, and the insert in the expression construct was sequenced on both strands to assure that no alterations in sequence had been introduced during PCR amplification. Two to four μg of expression construct DNA was then used to transfect COS-1 cells using the DEAE-dextran method (21McCutchan J.H. Pagano J.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1968; 41: 351-357PubMed Google Scholar) as described elsewhere (22Aksoy S. Szumlanski C.L. Weinshilboum R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14835-14840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were harvested and a high speed supernatant was prepared (22Aksoy S. Szumlanski C.L. Weinshilboum R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14835-14840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant rabbit INMT in these preparations was then used to perform substrate kinetic and inhibition experiments. All compounds tested were dissolved in water or 5 mm Tris, pH 8.5, with the exception of N,N-dimethyltryptamine, melatonin, α-methyltryptamine,N-methyltryptamine, and zolmitriptan, which were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. A rabbit genomic DNA cosmid library donated by Dr. R. G. Mage, Laboratory of Immunology, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (23Chen H.T. Alexander C.B. Mage R.G. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6365-6371PubMed Google Scholar), was screened with the same 350-bp rabbit INMT cDNA probe that had been used to perform the Northern blot analysis. DNA from a positive clone (clone 3-D) was purified with the QIAGEN Plasmid Midi kit. The sequence of the gene was determined by designing primers based on the rabbit lung INMT cDNA to directly sequence cosmid DNA with BigDye™ terminator chemistry (24Lee L.G. Spurgeon S.L. Heiner C.R.

The University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (GCG) software package Version 8.0 (25Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11534) Google Scholar) was used to analyze DNA and protein sequences. The TFSITES data base in GCG was used to search for sequence motifs that might be involved in transcription initiation or regulation. Apparent K m values were calculated by the method of Wilkinson (26Wilkinson G.N. Biochem. J. 1961; 80: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2722) Google Scholar) with a computer program written by Cleland (27Cleland W.W. Nature (Lond.). 1963; 198: 463-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The GraphPAD InPlot Program (GraphPAD Software, San Diego, CA) was used to calculate IC50 values. The rabbit lung INMT cDNA cloning strategy began with purification of the rabbit lung enzyme. The purified protein was then used to obtain partial amino acid sequence, which made it possible to utilize a PCR-based approach to clone the cDNA. Specifically, rabbit lung INMT was partially purified by sequential DEAE anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig.2, A and B). The enzyme was purified approximately 159-fold after these two steps. The final step in the purification was two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig.2 C). INMT was identified on the gel by photoaffinity labeling with [3H-CH3]AdoMet, the methyl donor for the reaction (Fig. 2 D). INMT had an apparent molecular mass value of approximately 29 kDa as determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The gel also showed a less intense radioactive signal with an identical molecular mass, but a more basic isoelectric point (Fig. 2 D). However, because of very low protein concentration in that region of the gel, no amino acid sequence could be obtained. When the major protein isolated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was sequenced, nine sequence fragments were obtained that varied from 3 to 32 amino acids in length. Each of those sequences was later found to be present within the amino acid sequence encoded by the rabbit lung cDNA, and, taken together, the sequence encoded by these fragments extended from the N terminus of the protein to amino acid 129. The next step in cDNA cloning involved the design of two degenerate PCR primers, DF1 and DR1 (Table I), on the basis of the partial amino acid sequence of the purified protein. When the PCR was performed with these degenerate primers and a rabbit lung cDNA library as template, a 191-bp product was amplified (Fig.3, Step 1). The sequence of this amplification product was then used to design INMT-specific primers which were paired with a series of anchor primers to perform 5′- and 3′-RACE with a rabbit lung cDNA library or with rabbit lung cDNA as template to obtain the remaining sequence of the cDNA (Fig. 3, Steps 2 and 3). The rabbit lung cDNA amplified in this fashion included a 792-bp ORF that encoded a 263-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 29 kDa. The 5′-UTR was 15 bp, and the 3′-UTR was 1094 bp in length. The length of the 5′-UTR was determined by 5′-RACE, and the length of the 3′-UTR was determined by 3′-RACE. The initial ATG in the cDNA was located within a “Kozak consensus sequence” for translation initiation (28Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4161) Google Scholar). A polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) was located 22 bp upstream of the poly(A) tract. The rabbit lung INMT cDNA ORF was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCR3.1, and this expression construct was used to transfect COS-1 cells. The COS-1 cells expressed virtually no endogenous “INMT-like activity” under the assay conditions used. Recombinant rabbit INMT expressed in the COS-1 cells catalyzed the methylation of tryptamine, and the biochemical properties of the recombinant enzyme were very similar to those of both purified rabbit lung INMT and INMT activity in rabbit lung cytosol preparations. For example, when 6 concentrations of tryptamine that varied from 0.03 to 1 mm were used to determine apparent K m values for INMT with rabbit lung high speed supernatant, purified rabbit lung INMT, and the recombinant enzyme, all of those apparent K m values were very similar (Table II). Similar results were found when 5 concentrations of AdoMet that varied from 0.8 to 25 μm were studied and apparent K mvalues were determined with the same three sources of enzyme (TableII). A series of compounds was then studied as possible substrates or inhibitors for the recombinant enzyme. These compounds were selected either on the basis of previous reports that they were substrates for methylation or because of their structural similarity to reported methylation substrates. The compounds tested included indolethylamines (α-methyltryptamine, N-methyltryptamine,N,N-dimethyltryptamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, melatonin, and antimigraine drugs structurally related toN,N-dimethyltryptamine (sumatriptan, naratriptan, and zolmitriptan)), β-carbolines (norharmane, harmane-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarboxylic acid, harmaline, harmalol, and harmol), isoquinolines (1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline and (±)-salsolinol), other biogenic amines (dopamine, (±)-norepinephrine, epinephrine, epinine, histamine, phenylethanolamine, β-phenylethylamine, (±)-octopamine, tyramine), and tricyclic antidepressants (desipramine and nortriptyline) among others. To determine whether these compounds were substrates for the enzyme, a single concentration that had proven optimal for the assay of tryptamine (1 mm) was tested initially (TableIII), and selected compounds were subsequently studied with a series of concentrations. Obviously, the reaction conditions used to perform these assays were optimal for tryptamine methylation, but they were not necessarily optimal for the other compounds studied. Therefore, the values shown in Table III can only be compared directly with data obtained under similar assay conditions.

This study has focused on hydrophobic transmembrane segments M5 and M6 of the H+-ATPase. In particular, a conserved aspartate residue near the middle of M6 has been found to play a critical role in the structure and biogenesis of the ATPase. Site-directed mutants in which Asp-730 was replaced by an uncharged residue (Asn or Val) were abnormally sensitive to trypsin, consistent with the idea that the proteins were poorly folded, and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy showed them to be arrested in the endoplasmic reticulum. Similar defects are known to occur when either Arg-695 or His-701 in M5 is replaced by a neutral residue (Dutra, M. B., Ambesi, A., and Slayman, C. W. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, 17411–17417). To search for possible charge-charge interactions between Asp-730 and Arg-695 or His-701, double mutants were constructed in which positively and negatively charged residues were swapped or eliminated.

The past few years have seen steady progress toward understanding the structure and function of P2-type cation-transporting ATPases, including the plasma-membrane H+-ATPases ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae and Neurospora crassaand the Na+,K+-, H+,K+-, and Ca2+-ATPases of mammalian cells (1Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In particular, it now seems clear that the 100-kDa ATPase polypeptides are embedded in the lipid bilayer by 10 transmembrane segments, four at the amino-terminal end and six at the carboxyl-terminal end of the molecule. Evidence for this view came initially from a combination of indirect approaches including hydropathy analysis, gene fusions (2Smith D.L. Tao T. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22469-22479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), tryptic digestion (3Besancon M. Shin J.M. Mercier F. Munson K. Miller M. Hersey S. Sachs G.

More recently, cryo-electron microscopy of two-dimensional crystals at 8-Å resolution has provided direct images of 10 membrane-spanning α-helices in the plasma-membrane H+-ATPase of N. crassa (8Auer M. Scarborough G.A. Kuhlbrandt W. Nature. 1998; 392: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (9Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Among the various membrane segments, there is particular interest in M5 and M6, which are generally connected by a hydrophilic loop of only five or six amino acid residues and thus are likely to form a hairpin in the membrane. In the mammalian P2-ATPases, mutagenesis studies have identified amino acid residues within M5 and M6 that appear to play a direct role in cation translocation, including Glu-771 (M5) and Asn-796, Thr-799, and Asp-800 (M6) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (10Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 11Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1998; 37: 1961-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It was therefore intriguing when Lutsenko et al. (15Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) detected a change in the state of the M5-M6 hairpin, depending upon the presence or absence of the transported cation. This finding was based on previous work by Shainskaya and Karlish (16Shainskaya A. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10780-10789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who demonstrated that most of the extramembranous regions of the Na+,K+-ATPase could be removed by proteolytic digestion in the presence of K+ or Rb+, leaving a preparation still capable of occluding K+. Subsequently, Lutsenko et al. (15Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) showed that proteolytic digestion in the absence of K+ was accompanied by the disappearance of M5 and M6 from the membrane, and went on to speculate that the hairpin may move in and out of the bilayer as a normal part of the ATPase reaction cycle. Based on recent evidence from site-directed mutagenesis, M5 and M6 are also structurally and functionally important in the Pma1 H+-ATPase of S. cerevisiae. Several residues in both membrane segments are required for normal biogenesis of the ATPase, and others play a role in the conformational changes that accompany the reaction cycle (17Dutra M.B. Ambesi A. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17411-17417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Padmanabha K.P. Pardo J.P. Petrov V.V. Sen Gupta S. Slayman C.W. Folia Microbiol. 1997; 42: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Asp-730, located near the middle of M6, appears to be especially critical, since replacement by Asn or Val leads to a complete failure of newly synthesized ATPase to reach the secretory vesicles responsible for delivering it to the plasma membrane (18Padmanabha K.P. Pardo J.P. Petrov V.V. Sen Gupta S. Slayman C.W. Folia Microbiol. 1997; 42: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To investigate this finding in greater detail, we have examined the effect of the D730N and D730V mutations on the folding and subcellular localization of the ATPase, and have gone on to search for compensatory mutations in M5. The results point to the presence of a salt bridge between Arg-695 in M5 and Asp-730 in M6, the first clearcut example of such an interaction in any of the P-type ATPases. S. cerevisiae strains SY4 (MATa; ura3-52; leu2-3, 112;his 4-619; sec 6-4ts;GAL2;pma1::YIpGAL-PMA1::URA3) and NY605 (MAT a; ura3-52; leu2-3, 112;GAL2) were used in these studies. SY4 has been described in detail by Nakamoto et al. (19Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol.

Mutations were introduced with the ChameleonTM Double Stranded Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and verified by automated DNA sequencing. After the BglII-SalI fragment was subcloned into plasmid pPMA1.2 (19Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the 3.77-kilobaseHindIII-SacI fragment containing the entire ATPase gene was moved into the expression vector YCp2HSE to bring the gene under heat-shock control. Plasmids were transformed into SY4 cells by the method of Ito et al. (22Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SY4 cells were grown to mid-exponential phase (A 600 ∼ 1) at 23 °C in minimal medium supplemented with 2% (w/v) galactose. The cells were then shifted to minimal medium containing 2% (w/v) glucose for 3 h, and subsequently transferred to 39 °C for an additional 2 h. The cells were harvested, washed, and lysed, and secretory vesicles were isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (23Ambesi A. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 127-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To assay the level of Pma1 protein expressed in secretory vesicles, isolated vesicles (5–20 μg) were subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting (19Nakamoto R.K. Rao R.

To determine the total amount of ATPase synthesized by the cell, SY4 cells were shifted from galactose medium at 23 °C to glucose medium at 39 °C as described above, and labeled for varying lengths of time (15, 30, 60, and 90 min) with [35S]methionine (26Nakamoto R.K.

To determine the subcellular localization of mutant ATPases, NY605 cells were transformed with a centromeric plasmid carrying the PMA1 gene that had been tagged with c-Myc epitope in a position corresponding to the NH2 terminus of the ATPase and placed under control of theGAL1 promoter (27DeWitt N.D.

Membranes (5 μg) were added to 10 μl of 20 mm Tris, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0, and after a 2-min preincubation at 30 °C, tosyl-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ) was added to give the desired trypsin:protein ratio in a final volume of 20 μl. After incubation for 0 to 10 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 2 mmdiisopropyl fluorophosphate. Reaction products were analyzed by immunoprecipitation (25Petrov V.V. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28535-28540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 26Nakamoto R.K. Verjovski-Almeida S. Allen K.E. Ambesi A. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J.

NY605 cells transformed with GAL-pma1 plasmids were grown at 30 °C in synthetic medium lacking uracil and containing 2% (w/v) glucose (27DeWitt N.D. Tourinho dos Santos F. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21744-21751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The cells were then diluted to 1 A 600/ml in sterile deionized water and plated in 5-μl droplets onto synthetic medium, lacking uracil and containing either 2% (w/v) glucose (chromosomal PMA1 gene expressed) or 2% (w/v) galactose (both chromosomal and plasmid-borne genes expressed). The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h and photographed. ATP hydrolysis was assayed at 30 °C in buffer containing 50 mmMES,2 pH 5.7, 5 mm NaN3, 5 mm Na2ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and an ATP regenerating system composed of 5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 50 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, as described by Ambesi et al. (30Ambesi A. Pan R.L. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The specific activity was measured as the difference between hydrolysis in the presence and absence of 100 μm orthovanadate. For the determination of K m values, the Na2ATP concentration was varied from 0.15 to 5 mm and the actual concentration of MgATP was calculated by the method of Fabiato and Fabiato (31Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). For the determination of K i values, the concentration of orthovanadate was varied from 0 to 100 μm. The pH optimum was determined by varying the pH from 5.0 to 8.0 with Tris base. Proton transport was assayed as the initial rate of acridine orange fluorescence quenching in 0.6 m sorbitol, 0.1 m KCl, 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 6.7, Na2ATP (0.3–3.0 mm), and MgCl2 (5 mm excess over ATP concentration), as described by Ambesi et al. (30Ambesi A. Pan R.L. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Parallel measurements were made of ATP hydrolysis under the same conditions. Protein concentrations were measured by the method of Lowry et al. (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as modified by Ambesi et al. (30Ambesi A. Pan R.L. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The starting point for this study was the finding that certain mutations of Asp-730 cause a virtual arrest of ATPase biogenesis. In the experiment of Fig.1 A, D730E, D730N, and D730V were expressed in the secretory vesicle system of Nakamoto et al. (19Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which uses a temperature-sensitive allele of thesec6 gene to block the last step in the delivery of newly synthesized proteins to the plasma membrane. Shifting the cells from 23 to 39 °C led to the accumulation of secretory vesicles, which were isolated (23Ambesi A. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 127-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and assayed by immunoblotting with anti-Pma1 polyclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 A, an appreciable amount of ATPase carrying the conservative D730E mutation reached the vesicles, but neither D730N nor D730V could be detected there by the antibody. To verify that the D730N and D730V polypeptides were synthesized and to explore their stability, the cells were incubated with [35S]methionine for varying lengths of time (15, 30, 60, and 90 min) at 39 °C. A total membrane fraction was then isolated, and the ATPase was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-Pma1 antiserum. Both the wild-type (Fig. 1 B) and D730E polypeptides (Fig. 1 C) appeared as prominently labeled 100-kDa bands by 15 min. The wild-type polypeptide remained stable over the entire labeling time course and D730E was nearly as stable, with only traces of a lower molecular weight band appearing over time. By contrast, D730N (Fig. 1 D) was readily visible at 15 min but decreased markedly at 60 and 90 min, and D730V (Fig. 1 E) became labeled more slowly, reaching a maximum at 60 min and tapering off again at 90 min. Thus, the D730N and D730V polypeptides were clearly made, but they appeared to be less stable than the wild-type and D730E ATPases. To pinpoint the subcellular compartment in which the mutant ATPases were arrested, the D730N and D730V genes were tagged with c-Myc epitope, placed under control of the GAL1promoter on a centromeric plasmid, and transformed into wild-type strain NY605, which lacks the sec6ts mutation and should allow newly synthesized ATPase to move all the way to the plasma membrane. The cells were grown on raffinose, shifted to galactose to induce expression of the plasmid-borne gene, and examined by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. In the experiment of Fig.2, double labeling was carried out with c-Myc antibody to detect the epitope-tagged ATPase and Kar2 antibody to serve as a marker for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (29Rose M.D. Misra L.M. Vogel J.P. Cell. 1989; 57: 1211-1222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). As expected, control cells expressing wild-type ATPase showed c-Myc labeling (red) at the cell surface, while Kar2 labeling (green) appeared in structures surrounding the nucleus and at the cell periphery, typical of the yeast ER (33Preuss D. Mulholland J. Kaiser C.A. Orlean P. Albright C. Rose M.D. Robbins P.W. Botstein D. Yeast. 1991; 7: 891-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The c-Myc and Kar2 patterns were largely distinct from one another as illustrated by the merged image in the top righthand panel, except for a slight overlap (yellow) where the peripheral ER was in close juxtaposition to the plasma membrane. By contrast, in cells expressing the D730N and D730V ATPases (middle and bottom panels), the c-Myc and Kar2 patterns could be superimposed with one another in prominent ER-like structures. In a recent study of Ala substitutions throughout the phosphorylation domain of the Pma1 ATPase, a close correlation was observed between protein misfolding (as assayed by limited trypsinolysis) and retention in the ER (27DeWitt N.D. Tourinho dos Santos F. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21744-21751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To examine the folding states of the D730N and D730V ATPases,35S-labeled total membranes were incubated at a trypsin:protein ratio of 1:20 for varying amounts of time and then immunoprecipitated with anti-Pma1 antibody (Fig.3). As expected, the 100-kDa wild-type polypeptide was relatively little affected by trypsin under these conditions, most of it remaining intact after 20 min of digestion (WT). By contrast, D730N was largely degraded (D730N) and D730V was barely detectable (D730V) after only 0.5 min of digestion. Previous work has shown that the wild-type Pma1 ATPase can be digested by higher concentrations of trypsin but that it can be protected by ligands such as MgADP, MgATP, and vanadate, producing distinctive patterns of fragments that correspond to the E1 and E2 conformational states of the enzyme (e.g.Refs. 30Ambesi A. Pan R.L. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar and 34Perlin D.S. Brown C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6788-6794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These patterns are illustrated in Fig.4 A, where the wild-type ATPase was treated with trypsin (1:4) for 10 min. A conspicuous 97-kDa fragment remained in the presence of 20 mm MgADP (ADP) or 20 mm MgATP (ATP), and fragments of 97 and 80 kDa, in the presence of 100 μm vanadate (VO4). To ask whether the D730N and D730V ATPases might be similarly protected (Fig.4, B and C), the trypsin:protein ratio was decreased to 1:50 to give a comparable amount of digestion in the absence of ligands. Under these conditions, there was no sign of protection by vanadate (VO4), but bands of 100, 90, and 80 kDa could be seen in the presence of MgADP (ADP) and MgATP (ATP). Thus, unlike mutants bearing substitutions at the catalytic phosphorylation site of the ATPase (D378N and D378V; Ref. 26Nakamoto R.K. Verjovski-Almeida S. Allen K.E. Ambesi A. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7338-7344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), D730N and D730V appeared able to bind adenine nucleotides, even though they were less well protected than the wild-type enzyme and their overall conformation was clearly abnormal. Consistent with the fact that D730N and D730V could be distinguished from D378N and D378V (26Nakamoto R.K. Verjovski-Almeida S. Allen K.E. Ambesi A. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7338-7344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in the ligand protection assay, they also appeared less severely affected in a genetic test. This set of experiments made use of NY605 cells that had been transformed with centromeric plasmids carrying each of the four mutant alleles under control of the GAL1 promoter (27DeWitt N.D. Tourinho dos Santos F. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21744-21751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); thus, only the chromosomal wild-type gene was expressed on glucose-containing medium, while the wild-type and mutant genes were co-expressed on galactose-containing medium. When the test was carried out using minimal medium, there was no difference among the four mutants; all behaved in a dominant negative fashion, completely inhibiting growth in the presence of galactose (not shown). But when the test was performed with a rich synthetic medium, D730N and D730V were recessive, allowing growth on galactose (Fig. 5). Two other mutants (R695A and H701A; see below) behaved similarly on synthetic medium, while D378A, D378N, and D378V still acted as dominant negatives. In considering the structural defects that result when Asp-730 is replaced with a neutral amino acid such as Asn or Val, one possible explanation is that the negative charge of the Asp residue may interact with a nearby positive charge to stabilize the ATPase during folding and biogenesis. If so, a logical place to look for the positive charge is in M5, which is connected to M6 by a short loop of only five amino acids. Indeed, M5 contains two such residues, Arg-695 and His-701, which have themselves been shown to be required for proper biogenesis. In a recent study, when Dutra et al. (17Dutra M.B. Ambesi A. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17411-17417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) substituted either the Arg or His by Ala, the ATPase became highly sensitive to trypsin and was unable to reach the secretory vesicles. To look for a possible interaction between M5 and M6, double mutants were constructed in which the positive and negative charges were swapped (R695D/D730R; H701D/D730H) or eliminated altogether (R695A/D730A; H701A/D730A). The double mutants and corresponding single mutants were transformed into strain SY4 on a centromeric plasmid under control of the heat-shock promoter, as described in the first section under “Results,” and after the cells were shifted from galactose medium at 23 °C to glucose medium at 39 °C, secretory vesicles were isolated and assayed for ATPase expression and ATP hydrolysis. As summarized in Table I, the double substitutions H701D/D730H and H701A/D730A, like all of the single substitutions of Arg-695, His-701, and Asp-730, gave undetectable amounts of ATPase in the secretory vesicles. Strikingly, however, the R695D/D730R and R695A/D730A ATPases reached the vesicles at 50 and 85% of the level seen in the wild-type control (Table I Fig.6), and after correction for the level of expression, were capable of nearly normal ATP hydrolysis (84 and 135%; Table I).Table IEffect of Arg-695, His-701, and Asp-730 mutations on expression in secretory vesicles, ATP hydrolysis, and H+ transportMutationExpressionaCalculated from yields of mutant and wild-type ATPase protein per mg of total secretory vesicle protein as determined by quantitative immunoblotting.

According to the SNARE1 model, docking of synaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane is a critical step that involves the formation of a ternary complex by the v-SNARE synaptobrevin (also known as vesicle-associated membrane protein, or VAMP), and two t-SNAREs: SNAP-25 and syntaxin (7Sollner T.

Reconstitution of the v-SNARE synaptobrevin into lipid vesicles and the two t-SNAREs, SNAP-25 and syntaxin, into a distinct vesicle pool has provided evidence that the formation of a ternary complex is sufficient to join the independent vesicle pools and lead to fusion of the apposed bilayer membranes (10Weber T.

Understanding the interactions between the proteins of the trimeric complex in a simplified model may outline new ways to control its assembly and dissociation or to modulate the conformational changes that are presumably necessary for the progression from the docking step to the subsequent phases in the secretory process. The structural domains that appear to be implicated in the protein-protein interactions between SNAP-25, synaptobrevin, and syntaxin show a high propensity for the formation of α-helices (11Zhong P.

To investigate the postulated coiled-coil interactions between the proteins that constitute the docking complex in a minimal model, we have applied the principles involved in the formation of stable coiled-coils (16O'Shea E.K. Lumb K.J. Kim P.S. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 658-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) to design three peptides corresponding to predicted coiled-coil-forming domains in SNAP-25, synaptobrevin-2, and syntaxin-1A. We have used CD spectroscopy to determine the secondary structure of these peptides and their interactions in binary and tertiary mixtures. Our findings are consistent with the assembly of the predicted ternary complex. HPLC grade trifluoroacetic acid, trifluoroethanol (TFE), ethanedithiol, thioanisol, phenol, and acetonitrile were purchased from Aldrich. Methyl tert-butyl ether was from Fisher. HPLC columns were from Vydac (Hesperia, CA).l-Amino acids and protected derivatives used for peptide synthesis were made by Calbiochem. Benzoic anhydride was obtained from Sigma. All other reagents for peptide synthesis and resins were from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Peptides SN (human brain SNAP-25-(181–206)), SB (human brain synaptobrevin-2-(40–67)), ST (human brain syntaxin-1A-(191–218)), and SNRD (scrambled SN peptide sequence: ESDNDTRAIKITQAGSMKRMGLNAKE) were produced using solid phase peptide synthesis. Synthesis started with ap-hydroxymethyl phenoxy methyl polysterene resin and was carried out using the Fastmoc® Fmoc strategy on an Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizer model 431A (Foster City, CA) according to a single coupling plus capping protocol. Cleavage from the resin and removal of all protecting groups was accomplished by using trifluoroacetic acid cleavage as described (17King D.S. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 36: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Crude peptides were precipitated from the trifluoroacetic acid mixture in cold methyltert-butyl ether and centrifuged, the supernatant was discarded, and the remaining methyl tert-butyl ether was removed under high vacuum at 0 °C for 3 h. Samples of crude peptide (10–20 mg) were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, applied to a semipreparatory column (Vydac, C-18), and eluted at a flow rate of 3 ml/min with a linear gradient of 90% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Eluted peaks were monitored by absorbance measurements at 214 nm, pooled, and lyophilized. Peptide purity was assessed by RP-HPLC in an analytical column (Vydac, C-18). Propensities of peptides to adopt a coiled-coil structure were estimated using two different programs: Coils and Paircoil. The Coils program uses the Lupas algorithm (18Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar, 19Lupas A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 513-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences were compared with an unweighted MTIDK matrix (18Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar) using 14- and 28-residue scanning windows. The second program uses the Berger algorithm (20Berger B. Wilson D.B. Wolf E. Tonchev T. Milla M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8259-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), which is more stringent. Both methods are based on the relative frequency of occurrence of amino acids at each position (a–g) of the coiled-coil heptad repeat. Secondary structure predictions were performed using the SOPMA method (21Geourjon C. Deleage G. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 22Geourjon C. Deleage G.

The original Pockel cell and Cary linear polarizer in the Cary 61 were replaced with a 50-kHz photoelastic modulator (Hinds International, FS-5/PEM-80) and a MgF2 linear polarizer (AVIV Inc.). The phase-detected output of the original end-on photomultiplier and preamplifier were integrated using an Egg Princeton Applied Research model 128A lock-in amplifier. System automation and multiple scan averaging were accomplished with an IBM PC-compatible computer interfaced directly to both the Cary 61 and the 128A amplifier. Constant N2 flushing was employed. Spectra were measured at 195–250 nm using a 0.05-cm cell, a 1-nm bandwidth, a 0.3-ms time constant, and a cell temperature of 25 °C. All recordings were performed in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, with or without TFE, unless otherwise indicated. Twenty scans were averaged for every spectrum. Base line subtraction, conversion of measured rotations to mean residue ellipticity [θ] (deg·cm2·dmol−1) (25Schmid F.X. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 251-286Google Scholar), and filtering of the spectra using a fast fourier transform filter were performed using the Microcal Origin 3.5 program. The percentage of α-helical content was estimated directly from the molar residue ellipticity at 222 nm as described by Chen et al. (26Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). Percentages of secondary structures were also estimated using the neural network-based K2 algorithm (27Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). To evaluate the spectral changes induced by peptide-peptide interactions in mixtures, the noninteracting spectra were calculated from the individual spectra using the equation, [θ]theo=∑​(ci·ni·[θ]i)/∑​(ci·ni)Equation 1 where c i denotes the molar peptide concentrations, n i represents the peptide lengths in number of residues, and [θ]i values are observed mean residue ellipticities. The sequences of the peptides synthesized from selected regions from human SNAP-25 (peptide SN), synaptobrevin-2 (peptide SB), and syntaxin-1A (peptide ST) are shown in Fig. 1 A. Sequence selection was based on six criteria: 1) information about the minimal domains of SNAP-25, synaptobrevin, and syntaxin involved in protein-protein interactions in the core complex (1Calakos N.

Nature. 1992; 356: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The region of SNAP-25 interacting with synaptobrevin-2 has been localized between residue 41 and the C-terminal residue (2Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kee Y. Lin R.C. Hsu S.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 991-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The segment from residue 181 to the C terminus is necessary for the SNAP-25-synaptobrevin interaction (3Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Peptides corresponding to the 20 and 26 C-terminal residues, the latter analogous to the SNAP-25 segment released after cleavage by BoNT E, inhibit neurotransmitter release with IC50 values of 10 and 0.25 μm, presumably by preventing the docking of synaptic vesicles (40Gutierrez L.M. Viniegra S. Rueda J. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Canaves J.M. Montal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 2634-2639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 43Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Gutierrez L.M. Apland J.P. Canaves J.M. Gil A. Viniegra S. Adler M. Montal M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of SNAP-25 delimited by residues 169 and 206 displays a high propensity (99%) to form coiled-coil structures. Two distinct domains are predicted: one from position 166 to 187 (62%), and the second from position 189 to the C terminus (55%). Accordingly, the 26-residue peptide corresponding to the C-terminal segment of SNAP-25, hereafter designated as SN, was selected based on the fact that it is nearly 4 heptads long, it exhibits high propensity to form coiled-coils, and it is an efficient inhibitor of neurotransmitter release (Fig. 1 A, Peptide SN). Similar considerations were used in the design of a potentially coiled-coil-forming peptide from syntaxin-1A. The region between positions 194 and 261 is necessary for the interaction with synaptobrevin-2 and SNAP-25 (2Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The segment necessary for interaction with SNAP-25 has been located between residues 199 and 267 (1Calakos N. Bennet M.K. Peterson K.E. Scheller R.H. Science. 1994; 263: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and further delimited to residues 199–220 (4Kee Y. Lin R.C. Hsu S.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 991-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). All of these studies confine the SNAP-25 binding region on syntaxin to the N-terminal portion of the H3 domain (residues 191–266) (2Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kee Y. Lin R.C. Hsu S.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 991-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and a putative minimal SNAP-25 binding domain (residues 189–220) has been identified (11Zhong P. Chen Y.A. Tam D. Chung D. Scheller R.H. Miljanich G.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4317-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 44Kee Y. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1975-1981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coiled-coil predictions using the sequence of human syntaxin revealed a region between positions 199 and 214 with high probability (78%) of coiled-coil formation. Syntaxin-1A mutants containing point mutations (4Kee Y. Lin R.C. Hsu S.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 991-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 11Zhong P. Chen Y.A. Tam D.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1975-1981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at thea and d repeats of a predicted coiled-coil show reduced SNAP-25 binding, supporting the involvement of this region in the interaction with SNAP-25 (Fig. 1 B). Peptides corresponding to the predicted coiled-coil-forming region of syntaxin-1A have also been shown to inhibit neurotransmitter release (11Zhong P. Chen Y.A. Tam D. Chung D. Scheller R.H. Miljanich G.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4317-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 42Martin F. Salinas E. Vazquez J. Soria B. Reig J.A. Biochem.

Given these considerations, the selected 4-heptad synthetic peptide corresponding to human syntaxin spanned from residue 191 to 218 (Fig. 1 A, Peptide ST). The region of synaptobrevin-2 between positions 27 and 96 interacts with both SNAP-25 and syntaxin-1A in the core complex (3Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 28Archer III, B.T. Ozcelik T. Jahn R. Francke U. Sudhof T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17267-17273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synaptobrevin-2 contains a conserved domain between residues 57 and 88, with high propensity (95%) to form coiled-coils, and two distinct subdomains (28–42 and 52–72). Deletion of the region spanning from residue 41 to 50 abolishes endocytosis (45Grote E. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and mutants lacking the segments 41–50 or 51–60 do not to bind to SNAP-25 and syntaxin-1A. The mutants with deletion of segment 31–38 show weak binding to t-SNAREs, whereas the deletion of segments 61–70 or 71–80 results in poor binding to syntaxin while maintaining the interactions with SNAP-25 (47Regazzi R. Sadoul K. Meda P. Kelly R.B. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6951-6959Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Moreover, a single mutation (M46A) inhibits endocytosis by 80% and reduces binding to syntaxin-1A and SNAP-25 (45Grote E. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 46Hao J.C. Salem N. Peng X.R. Kelly R.B. Bennet M.K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1596-1603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, this information suggests that the region delimited by positions 40 and 60 is involved in the ternary interactions that result in the assembly of the docking complex; therefore, the peptide synthesized encompassed 4 heptads from position 40 (Fig. 1 A, Peptide ST). A control peptide corresponding to the scrambled sequence of the selected SNAP-25 peptide was also synthesized. Randomized sequences were generated, their secondary structures were predicted using the SOPMA method, and the sequences with an α-helical content similar to the original sequence were run against the Prosite data base. A peptide with the same functional sites but without the heptad periodicity was synthesized (sequence shown under “Experimental Procedures”), and it was shown to be pharmacologically inactive. The SNRDpeptide, at variance to SN, did not affect Ca2+-dependent release in chromaffin cells. Secondary structure predictions using the SOPMA method (21Geourjon C. Deleage G. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 22Geourjon C. Deleage G. Comp. Appl. Biosci. 1995; 11: 681-684PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that all three peptides may form stable α-helices in the context of a whole protein structure. Predicted helicities for SN, SB, and ST peptides were 62, 96, and 86%, respectively, when considered integrated in the protein, in contrast to 42, 57, and 67% as isolated peptides. The behavior of the isolated peptides in an aqueous environment was predicted by using the AGADIR algorithm (23Munoz V. Serrano L. Biopolymers. 1997; 41: 495-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This program uses statistical mechanics to consider short range interactions between residues at different pH and temperature. Given the size of our peptides, they are predicted to be unstructured (4% for SN, 3% for SB, and 2% for ST peptide, respectively) under aqueous conditions. Thus, considering both sets of data, we infer that these peptides can adopt α-helical structures only in the context of the intact protein and, therefore, that the presence of helicity-inducing conditions may be necessary to mimic the secondary structure of the peptides in the cytosol. TFE, a hydrophilic and hydrogen-bonding solvent, has been widely used to stabilize marginally stable α-helical structures in potentially α-helical peptides (48Hodges R.S. Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Semchuk P.D. Peptide Res. 1990; 3: 123-137PubMed Google Scholar, 50Nelson J.W. Kallenbach N.R. Proteins. 1986; 1: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 51Nelson J.W. Kallenbach N.R.

Biol. 1992; 226: 819-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). TFE is not limited to promoting helix formation, since it has also been shown to stabilize β-turns and even β-strands (54Blanco J.F. Serrano L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 634-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 55Narayanan U. Keiderling T.A. Bonora G.M. Toniolo C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 2431-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding, TFE-induced α-helical conformation in fragments of proteins known to be β-sheet in the native context has been documented (56Dong A. Matsuura J. Manning M.C. Carpenter J.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 57Arunkumar A.I. Kumar T.K.S. Yu C. Biochim. Biophys.

Therefore, caution must be exercised in inferring structure from CD data of peptides in the presence of TFE, particularly with regard to the extent that it represents the native structure in the context of the intact protein from which the peptide sequences were selected. A model of one of the trimeric conformers of the selected peptides forming a coiled-coil structure is shown in Fig. 1 B. Given the helical wheel representation, residues at the a- and d-positions stabilize the structure by hydrophobic interchain interactions. Acco"

The genome of N. coriiceps contains ∼15 distinct DNA fragments complementary to α-tubulin cDNA probes, which suggests that the α-tubulins of this cold-adapted fish are encoded by a substantial multigene family. From an N. coriicepstesticular DNA library, we isolated a 13.8-kilobase pair genomic clone that contains a tightly linked cluster of three α-tubulin genes, designated NcGTbαa, NcGTbαb, andNcGTbαc. Two of these genes, NcGTbαa andNcGTbαb, are linked in head-to-head (5′ to 5′) orientation with ∼500 bp separating their start codons, whereasNcGTbαa and NcGTbαc are linked tail-to-tail (3′ to 3′) with ∼2.5 kilobase pairs between their stop codons. The exons, introns, and untranslated regions of the three α-tubulin genes are strikingly similar in sequence, and the intergenic region between the αa and αbgenes is significantly palindromic. Thus, this cluster probably evolved by duplication, inversion, and divergence of a common ancestral α-tubulin gene. Expression of the NcGTbαc gene is cosmopolitan, with its mRNA most abundant in hematopoietic, neural, and testicular tissues, whereas NcGTbαa andNcGTbαb transcripts accumulate primarily in brain. The differential expression of the three genes is consistent with distinct suites of putative promoter and enhancer elements. We propose that cold adaptation of the microtubule system of Antarctic fishes is based in part on expansion of the α- and β-tubulin gene families to ensure efficient synthesis of tubulin polypeptides.

Subjected to an increasingly severe thermal environment as the Southern Ocean began to cool approximately 25–40 million years ago (mya)1 (1Eastman J.T. Antarctic Fish Biology: Evolution in a Unique Environment. Academic Press, San Diego1993Google Scholar), the coastal fishes of the Antarctic diverged from temperate fishes (2DeWitt H.H. Bushnell V.C. Antarctic Map Folio Series, Folio 15. American Geographical Society, New York1971: 1-10Google Scholar) and evolved compensatory molecular, cellular, and physiological adaptations that maintain metabolic efficiency and preserve macromolecular function in their now chronically cold marine environment (−1.86 to approximately 1 °C). The translational machinery of these fishes, for example, shows clear evidence of cold adaptation (3Smith M.A.K. Haschemeyer A.E.V. Physiol. Zool. 1980; 53: 373-382Crossref Google Scholar, 4Haschemeyer A.E.V. Mathews R.W. Biol. Bull. 1982; 162: 18-27Crossref Google Scholar), with rates of polypeptide chain elongation more than 10-fold greater than those measured in temperate fishes cooled to comparable temperatures. Similarly, the polymerization energetics of the actins of Antarctic fishes (5Swezey R.R. Somero G.N. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4496-4503Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and the ATPase activities of their skeletal myosins (6Johnston I.A. Walesby N.J. J. Comp.

Our goal is to determine the molecular adaptations, both qualitative and quantitative, that maintain the efficient expression of the tubulin genes and the polymerization capacity of the tubulin polypeptides of these extreme psychrophiles. We and others (7Williams Jr., R.C. Correia J.J. DeVries A.L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2790-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 8Detrich III, H.W. Johnson K.A. Marchese-Ragona S.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 10085-10093Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have shown previously that the critical concentration for microtubule formation by the brain tubulins of Antarctic fishes (∼1 mg/ml) is comparable to those of temperate poikilotherms and homeotherms at their much higher body temperatures. Conservation of the critical concentration by Antarctic fishes probably results from structural changes, both in primary sequences and in posttranslational modifications, intrinsic to their α- and β-tubulin subunits (9Detrich III, H.W.

The primary sequence of class II β-tubulin from the yellowbelly rockcod Notothenia coriiceps, for example, contains unique residue substitutions that increase both the hydrophobicity and the flexibility of the polypeptide chain (12Detrich III, H.W. Parker S.P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 24: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13Detrich III, H.W. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1997; 118: 501-513Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), two factors that should favor microtubule formation in an energy-poor environment. Similar alterations have been observed in other α- and β-tubulin chains of this species. 2Detailed analysis of the structural changes unique to Antarctic fish tubulins will be presented elsewhere (S. K. Parker, E. Nogales, K. H. Downing, and H. W. Detrich III, manuscript in preparation). A second, related challenge confronting Antarctic fishes is the synthesis of sufficient quantities of the α- and β-tubulins to attain the critical concentration of tubulin dimers in their cells. The abundant expression of tubulin in the brains of Antarctic fishes is likely to require compensatory adjustments in gene transcription to offset the rate-depressing effects of low temperature. Potential adaptations include increases in tubulin gene number, organization of tubulin genes into efficient transcription units, evolution of more efficient gene promoters, enhancers, transcription factors, and/or RNA polymerases, and enhancement of mRNA stabilization. To evaluate these possibilities, we have initiated analysis of the structure, genomic organization, and expression of the tubulin genes of N. coriiceps. Our results suggest that several of these modes of adaptation may be exploited by these cold-living vertebrates. In higher vertebrates, the α- and β-tubulins are encoded by small gene families (∼6–7 functional genes for α and a similar number for β), each member of which yields a structurally distinct polypeptide (14Sullivan K.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 687-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 15Murphy D.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Ludueña R.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). These genes are generally thought to be unlinked and dispersed throughout the genome (17Cleveland D.W. Hughes S.H. Stubblefield E. Kirschner M.W. Varmus H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3130-3134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a study of the chicken α-tubulin gene family, for example, Pratt and Cleveland (18Pratt L.F. Cleveland D.W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) found that four of five genomic clones contained single α-tubulin genes; the fifth contained two α-tubulin genes, one functional and the second a pseudogene. The genomes of lower, nonvertebrate eukaryotes, by contrast, frequently contain tightly linked tubulin genes. Protozoan parasites possess tubulin gene ensembles, either as separate tandem groupings of α- or β-tubulin genes (Leishmania spp. (19Landfear S.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Wirth D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1070-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,20Huang P.L. Roberts B.E. McMahaon Pratt D. David J.R. Miller J.S. Mol. Cell.

Gene (Amst.). 1985; 35: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Thomashow LS. Milhausen M. Rutter W.J. Agabian N. Cell. 1983; 32: 35-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar)). Similarly, some of the tubulin genes of the sea urchinLytechinus pictus are organized in distinct α or β clusters (23Alexandraki D. Ruderman J.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 1125-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of tubulin gene expression occurs at both transcriptional and translational levels. The tissue-specific and hormonally regulated expression of the β-tubulin genes ofDrosophila is controlled both by upstream promoter elements and by negative and positive regulatory elements (silencers and enhancers) generally located within the first introns (24Michiels F. Wolk A. Renkawitz-Pohl R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4515-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 25Bruhat A. Tourmente S. Chapel S. Sobrier M.L. Couderc J.L. Dastugue B.

Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 721-727PubMed Google Scholar). Less is known regarding regulation of tubulin gene expression in vertebrates. TATA boxes are generally present in vertebrate α- and β-tubulin promoters (29Sullivan K.F. Machlin P.S. Ratrie III, H. Cleveland D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13317-13322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Hair A. Morgan G.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7925-7934Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and high level expression of a Xenopusα-tubulin gene, XαT14, in oocytes is regulated by three CCAAT boxes, a “heat-shock-like” element (all located 60–200 bp upstream of the transcription start site), and their corresponding transcription factors (31Middleton K.M. Morgan G.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5041-5055Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cotranslational regulation of tubulin mRNA stability also contributes to control of cellular tubulin levels (32Cleveland D.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 339-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). When the pool of tubulin dimers is high, β-tubulin mRNAs are targeted for degradation by binding of a cellular factor to the ribosome-bound amino-terminal β-tubulin tetrapeptide (33Yen T.J. Machlin P.S. Cleveland D.W. Nature. 1988; 334: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar,34Theodorakis N.G. Cleveland D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 791-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report the first example of clustered tubulin genes in a vertebrate, the Antarctic rockcod N. coriiceps. Three α-tubulin genes, designated NcGTbαa,NcGTbαb, and NcGTbαc, are tightly linked in an ∼10-kb segment of DNA, with αa and αblinked head-to-head (5′ to 5′) and αa and αctail-to-tail (3′ to 3′). The similarity of the nucleotide sequences of these genes, strikingly illustrated by an ∼480-bp palindrome linkingαa and αb, suggests that the cluster evolved approximately 7–31 million years ago by duplication, inversion, and divergence of a common ancestral α-tubulin gene. The neurally restricted expression of the αa/αb gene pair and the widespread expression of αc appear to be governed by distinct sets of promoter and enhancer elements. We have also identified a 285-bp element from the αa/αcintergenic region that is distributed widely in notothenioid genomes. We propose that expansion of the number of α-tubulin genes in theN. coriiceps genome facilitates the synthesis of α-tubulin chains at low temperature by providing additional templates for mRNA synthesis. The selective pressure favoring this expansion was probably the cooling of the Southern Ocean beginning ∼25–40 mya. A preliminary report of some of this work has appeared (35Parker S.K. Detrich III, H.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 75: 45aGoogle Scholar). Specimens of the Antarctic yellowbelly rockcod, N. coriiceps, were collected by bottom trawling from the R/V Hero or from the R/V Polar Duke near Low and Brabant Islands in the Palmer Archipelago. They were transported alive to Palmer Station, Antarctica, where they were maintained in seawater aquaria at −1.5 to 1 °C. Tissues (testis, brain, gill, liver, spleen, blood, and muscle) were dissected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and maintained at −70 °C until use. Frozen testis tissue from the New Zealand black cod, Notothenia angustata, was generously provided by Dr. Arthur DeVries (University of Illinois, Urbana). High molecular weight genomic DNA was purified (36Blin N. Stafford D.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 2303-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2335) Google Scholar) from the testis tissue of one N. coriiceps male, and Southern blots (37Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (21490) Google Scholar) of restriction endonuclease-digested DNA samples were prepared as described previously (12Detrich III, H.W. Parker S.P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 24: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The Southern replicas were probed for α-tubulin gene sequences by hybridization to 32P-labeled (12Detrich III, H.W. Parker S.P. Cell Motil.

Biol. 1985; 5: 2389-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Prehybridization and hybridization of the membranes were performed at moderate stringency (3× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 m trisodium citrate), 5× Denhardt's solution (41Denhardt D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 23: 641-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar), 50 μg/ml sonicated, denatured Escherichia coli DNA, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 68 °C) for 1 and 18–20 h, respectively, and the membranes were washed to high stringency (0.1× SSC, 25 °C, 1 h). The membranes were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 X-Omat film at −70 °C with intensification (DuPont Cronex Lightning Plus screens). A genomic library of N. coriiceps testicular DNA was constructed in the λ vector Charon 35 (42Loenen W.A.M. Blattner F.R. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 26: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). High molecular weight DNA was digested partially with MboI, and fragments of 15–20-kb, obtained by sucrose gradient centrifugation, were ligated to the BamHI sites of the vector arms. Recombinant phage DNA was packaged in vitro (Packagene; Promega). The unamplified library was screened for clones encoding α-tubulin genes by hybridization (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) of nitrocellulose replicas of bacteriophage plaque DNA to the32P-labeled chicken cDNA. Prehybridization and hybridization of the membranes were performed at moderate stringency (see “Southern Analysis of Genomic DNA”) for 1 and 18–20 h, respectively. Positive plaques were detected autoradiographically as described above. One hundred twenty candidate α-tubulin genomic isolates, obtained from a primary screen of 500,000 recombinant phage, were classified as strongly, moderately, or weakly hybridizing. One strongly hybridizing isolate, designated S2, was carried through two additional rounds of plaque purification and screening, and single plaques were picked for clone stock preparation. By using testicular DNA from N. angustata, we constructed a genomic library of 15–20-kb fragments in the vector LambdaGEM-11 (Promega). DNA was digested partially with MboI; fragments were ligated to phage arms containing XhoI half-sites, and recombinant phage DNA was packaged in vitro (Packagene; Promega). The library (titer = 1 × 106) was screened for candidate α-tubulin clones by hybridization to anN. coriiceps α-tubulin cDNA, NcTbα1, essentially as described for α-globin genes by Zhao et al. (43Zhao Y. Ratnayake-Lecamwasam M. Parker S.K. Cocca E. Camardella L. di Prisco G. Detrich III, H.W. J. Biol.

Twelve candidate α-tubulin genomic isolates were obtained from a primary screen of 200,000 recombinant phage. Six of these isolates were carried through two additional rounds of plaque purification and screening, and single plaques were picked for clone stock preparation. Total RNA was isolated from brain tissues of N. coriiceps (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 44Puissant C. Houdebine L.-M. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 148-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and poly(A)+ RNA was selected by oligo(dT)-cellulose affinity chromatography (45Aviv H. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (5183) Google Scholar). Two different libraries were made. Oligo(dT)-primed cDNA synthesis and construction of the first library in λgt10 followed the procedures described by Huynh et al. (46Huynh T.V. Young R.A. Davis R.W. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1985: 49-78Google Scholar). The second library was constructed in λZAP II (Stratagene); cDNA synthesis was primed with a mixture of random hexanucleotides (75%) and oligo(dT) (25%). The libraries were screened for recombinant clones bearing α-tubulin coding sequences by hybridization of nitrocellulose or nylon (MagnaLift, MSI, Westboro, MA) replicas of bacteriophage plaque DNA to the probe,32P-labeled by nick translation (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or by random priming (47Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). In early screens cα1 was used as probe, whereas in later screens α-tubulin cDNAs from N. coriiceps were employed. Hybridization and washing of the membranes were performed as described (12Detrich III, H.W. Parker S.P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 24: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and positive plaques were detected autoradiographically. A total of 159 candidate α-tubulin cDNA isolates were obtained from three screens (632,000 total recombinant phage) of the two libraries, and 80 of these were carried through tertiary plaque purification/screening. Three cDNA clones (designated NcTbα2, NcTbα7, and NcTbα8) from the second library that corresponded to the three α-tubulin genes (αb,αa, and αc, respectively) of the genomic cluster (Fig. 1) were sequenced (see below). The nucleotide sequence of NcTbα2 downstream of codon 168 was used to complete the sequence of the partial αb gene. Two cDNAs (NcTbα1 and NcTbα3) from the first library were also characterized. Parental clones and restriction fragment or deletion (48Henikoff S. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar) subclones were sequenced manually on both strands by use of the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (49Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) and T4 DNA polymerase (Sequenase II; U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Portions of the sequence were established by use of the PRISM Ready Reaction Dye Deoxy Termination Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems), and the products were electrophoresed on an Applied Biosystems 373A automated DNA sequencer (University of Maine DNA Sequencing Facility). Nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyses of the N. coriiceps α-tubulin genes, cDNAs, and their encoded proteins were performed by use of the Clustal method provided by DNASTAR MegAlign. DNA sequence relatedness was calculated as the similarity index of Dayhoff (50Dayhoff M.O. Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure. National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington, D. C.1979Google Scholar) as implemented by DNASTAR Align. The sequence of the N. coriiceps α-tubulin gene cluster reported in this paper has been deposited in the GenBankTM data base under the accession number AF082027. The sequence of the cluster has been scanned against the GenBankTM data base using the BLASTN program (National Center for Biotechnology Information) to identify sequences with significant relatedness. Related sequences, and their accession numbers, are presented under “Results.” Total RNAs from testis, brain, gill, liver, spleen, blood, and muscle were isolated from tissues by a modification (44Puissant C. Houdebine L.-M. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 148-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (51Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). RNAs (5 μg/slot) were applied to nylon membranes (MagnaGraph, MSI) by vacuum aspiration using a Bio-Rad Bio-Dot slot-blot apparatus. Sets of seven RNA samples were hybridized to PCR-generated, 32P-labeled probes specific for the 3′-UTRs of the cDNAs NcTbα2 (αb gene), NcTbα3, NcTbα7 (αa gene), or NcTbα8 (αcgene). To estimate the total α-tubulin mRNA in each tissue, a control set of RNA samples was hybridized to a fragment of NcTbα1 encoding amino acid residues 1–430. Prehybridization and hybridization of the membranes were performed in 5× SSPE (1× SSPE = 0.18m NaCl, 0.01 mNa2HPO4·7H2O, 0.001 mEDTA), 5× Denhardt's solution (41Denhardt D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 23: 641-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar), 50% formamide, 0.2% SDS at 42 °C for 2 and 18–20 h, respectively, after which the membranes were washed sequentially with buffers of increasing stringency (final wash conditions = 0.1× SSPE, 42 °C, 15 min). The membranes were exposed to Fuji RX x-ray film at −70 °C with intensification. To determine the potential linkage of α-tubulin genes in the N. angustata genome, we employed a PCR-based strategy using as template phage DNAs purified from the six tertiary genomic clones (see “Genomic Library Construction and Screening”). Nondegenerate primers corresponding to highly conserved regions of the primary sequence of the N. coriiceps α-tubulins were synthesized as follows: 1) sense primer, 5′ CAGTTTGTGGACTGGTGC 3′ (residues 341–347, N-Gln-Phe-Val-Asp-Trp-Cys-C); 2) antisense primer, 5′ AGCTCCAGTCTCACTGAAG 3′ (reverse complement of coding sequence for residues 53–58; N-Phe-Ser-Glu-Thr-Gly-Ala-C). The primers were used in three combinations as follows: 1) sense alone to amplify tail-to-tail-linked genes; 2) antisense alone to amplify head-to-head-linked genes; and 3) sense plus antisense to establish head-to-tail linkage by difference (i.e. PCR products not shared with sense alone and antisense alone reactions). Each PCR reaction contained 3–5 ng of template DNA, 1.6 μmprimers (0.8 μm of each primer when different), andCLONTECH AdvantageTM KlenTaq polymerase mix (optimized for long distance PCR) (52Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2216-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Touchdown PCR (53Don R.H. Cox P.T. Wainwright B.J. Baker K. Mattick J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (2250) Google Scholar) was performed for 29 cycles using the following parameters: 1) denaturation steps, 94 °C, 30 s; 2) annealing steps, first 9 cycles ramping the temperature from 70 to 62 °C in 1° increments followed by 20 cycles at 62 °C; and 3) extension steps, 68 °C, 6 min. PCR products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels containing 1× TBE (0.089m Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and 0.0005% ethidium bromide. The ends of the PCR products were sequenced by the automated procedure to establish α-tubulin gene orientation. During characterization of the N. coriicepsα-tubulin gene cluster, we discovered a 285-bp repetitive element. To determine the abundance, organization, and species distribution of this fragment, we hybridized it to Southern replicas ofHindIII-digested genomic DNAs from Antarctic and temperate notothenioids, other temperate fishes, an amphibian, and a reptile. Restriction endonuclease digestion, electrophoresis, and transfer of DNAs were performed as described previously (12Detrich III, H.W. Parker S.P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 24: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Prehybridization of the membrane and subsequent hybridization to the 285-bp probe (labeled with 32P by random priming (47Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar)) were performed as described by Detrich and Parker (12Detrich III, H.W. Parker S.P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 24: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with the following exceptions: 1) prehybridization was for 2 h; 2) the prehybridization/hybridization temperature was 63 °C; and 3) the membranes were washed to final stringencies of 0.1–1× SSC, 63 °C, for 15–40 min. The membranes were exposed to Fuji RX x-ray film as described above. Genomic DNA from the zebrafish (Danio rerio) was prepared from total body tissues (36Blin N. Stafford D.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 2303-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2335) Google Scholar). Samples of genomic DNAs from the African lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus), the clearnose skate (Raja eglanteria), the goldfish (Carassius auratus), the horned shark (Heterdontus francisci), the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), the spotted ratfish (Hydrolagus colliei), the sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), the clawed frog (Xenopus mulleri), and the snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) were generously provided by Dr. Chris Amemiya (Boston University School of Medicine). To estimate the number of α-tubulin genes possessed by N. coriiceps, we probed its genome for sequences complementary to α-tubulin cDNAs from the chicken (cα1) and fromChlamydomonas (α10–2). Fig.1 shows that the α-tubulin probes hybridized to 10–15 different fragments in each restriction digest of the fish DNA. Furthermore, the hybridization patterns generated by the two heterologous cDNAs were virtually identical. These results suggest that the α-tubulins of N. coriiceps, like its β-tubulins (12Detrich III, H.W. Parker S.P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 24: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), are encoded by a multigene family that is larger than those of higher vertebrates (14Sullivan K.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 687-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 16Ludueña R.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 39Cleveland D.W. Lopata M.A. MacDonald R.J. Cowan N.J. Rutter W.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1980; 20: 95-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). Of particular note, the strong hybridization signals observed for some of the fragments raised the possibility that they contain multiple, linked α-tubulin genes. To investigate the organization of the α-tubulin genes of N. coriiceps, we selected a strongly hybridizing clone, S2, that carried an insert of ∼13.8 kb. Preliminary restriction mapping and Southern hybridization analysis suggested that the insert contained two or more α-tubulin genes in a segment of ∼10 kb. Subsequent sequence analysis revealed that S2 contains two complete α-tubulin genes, designated NcGTbαa and NcGTbαc, and one partial gene, NcGTbαb, that abuts one end of the genomic fragment. Fig. 2 presents the organization and salient features of this gene complex. Two of the genes, αa and αb, a"

Using site-directed mutagenesis, six mutant RTs were constructed bearing the mutations Y318H, Y318K, Y318L, Y318C, Y318W, and Y318F. We found that only the Y318W and Y318F mutant RTs retained substantial RT activity, whereas the catalytic activities of the Y318K, Y318C, Y318H, and Y318L RT mutants were less than 5% of the wild-type activity. The Y318F mutant RT retained substantial sensitivity to the majority of NNRTIs tested, whereas the Y318W mutant RT showed varying degrees of resistance to NNRTIs. Subunit-specific site-directed mutagenesis revealed that there was no difference in the catalytic activity or resistance/sensitivity spectrum toward NNRTIs regardless of whether the Tyr-318 mutation was introduced in both subunits or only in the p66 subunit of RT. Recombinant viruses harboring the Y318F or Y318W mutation in the RT showed a similar resistance/sensitivity pattern to NNRTIs as their corresponding 318 mutant recombinant RTs. Our findings stress a functional or structural role for Tyr-318 in wild-type RT and argue for the design of novel NNRTIs that interact more closely with this amino acid in the NNRTI-specific pocket of human immunodeficiency virus type I RT. The highly conserved Tyr-318 is part of the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-specific lipophilic pocket of human immunodeficiency virus type I reverse transcriptase (RT) and makes contact within 4 Å with the NNRTIs in all reported RT/NNRTI complexes. Using site-directed mutagenesis, six mutant RTs were constructed bearing the mutations Y318H, Y318K, Y318L, Y318C, Y318W, and Y318F. We found that only the Y318W and Y318F mutant RTs retained substantial RT activity, whereas the catalytic activities of the Y318K, Y318C, Y318H, and Y318L RT mutants were less than 5% of the wild-type activity. The Y318F mutant RT retained substantial sensitivity to the majority of NNRTIs tested, whereas the Y318W mutant RT showed varying degrees of resistance to NNRTIs. Subunit-specific site-directed mutagenesis revealed that there was no difference in the catalytic activity or resistance/sensitivity spectrum toward NNRTIs regardless of whether the Tyr-318 mutation was introduced in both subunits or only in the p66 subunit of RT. Recombinant viruses harboring the Y318F or Y318W mutation in the RT showed a similar resistance/sensitivity pattern to NNRTIs as their corresponding 318 mutant recombinant RTs. Our findings stress a functional or structural role for Tyr-318 in wild-type RT and argue for the design of novel NNRTIs that interact more closely with this amino acid in the NNRTI-specific pocket of human immunodeficiency virus type I RT. non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor reverse transcriptase human immunodeficiency virus [2′,5′-bis-O-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-β-d-ribofuranosyl]-3′-spiro-5“-(4”-amino-1“,2”-oxathiole-2“,2”-dioxide) derivatives of N 3-methylthymine tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-thione zidovudine triphosphate. The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)1 form a large and chemically diverse group of compounds. Although the NNRTIs are very potent and selective inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-I) with low toxicity, their use for anti-AIDS therapy is severely limited by the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viruses (1De Clercq E. Rev. Med. Virol. 1996; 6: 97-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structural studies from Kohlstaedt et al. (2Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar) to Esnoufet al. (3Esnouf R.M. Ren J. Hopkins A.L. Ross C.K. Jones E.Y. Stammers D. Stuart D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3984-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) have shown that NNRTIs bind in a common internal lipophilic pocket within the HIV-I RT and cause inhibition of the enzyme activity by distortion of the polymerase active site (4Esnouf R. Ren J. Ross C. Jones Y. Stammers D. Stuart D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Virtually all mutations conferring resistance to NNRTIs (for an overview, see Ref. 5Schinazi R.F. Larder B.A. Mellors J.W. Int. Antiviral News. 1997; 5: 129-142Google Scholar) correspond to amino acid residues lining this internal pocket (Fig. 1). Mutations have been reported for almost all of the pocket-lining residues, with the only exceptions being Leu-234 and Tyr-318. Tyr-318 makes contact (within 4 Å, mainly involving the Cε, Cξ, and Oη atoms) with the NNRTIs in all reported RT/NNRTI complexes, and the most extensive contacts are with delavirdine (BHAP U-90152; Fig.2; Ref. 3Esnouf R.M. Ren J. Hopkins A.L. Ross C.K. Jones E.Y. Stammers D. Stuart D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3984-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This implies that mutations at Tyr-318 might confer resistance to NNRTIs. When searching for mutations in RTs, sequencing is generally limited to the first 750 base pairs of the RT gene corresponding to residues 1–250 of the RT. Thus, it cannot be excluded that Tyr-318 mutant RTs may have been selected under NNRTI pressure but may not have been properly identified. To examine the potential role of Tyr-318 in resistance development and HIV-I RT activity, Tyr-318 mutant RTs were created by site-directed mutagenesis and evaluated for both catalytic activity and resistance/sensitivity toward a variety of NNRTIs including delavirdine, a potent NNRTI for which structural studies have suggested a significant interaction with Tyr-318 (Fig. 1; Ref. 3Esnouf R.M.

We have also constructed a number of recombinant viruses harboring mutations at position 318 in their RT gene and examined their replication competence and resistance/sensitivity spectrum toward NNRTIs. [2′,5′-Bis-O-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-β-d-ribofuranosyl]-3′-spiro-5“-(4”-amino-1“,2”-oxathiole-2“,2”-dioxide) derivatives of N 3-methylthymine (TSAO-m3T) were obtained from Dr. M.-J. Camarasa (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientı́ficas, Madrid, Spain). Nevirapine (BI-RG-587; dipyridodiazepinone) was kindly provided by Dr. P. Ganong (Boehringer Ingelheim, Ridgefield, CT).

Bisheteroarylpiperazine U-90152 (delavirdine) and quinoxaline HBY 097 ((S)-4-isopropoxycarbonyl-6-methoxy-3-(methylthiomethyl)-3,4-dihydroquinoxaline-2(1H)-thione) were provided by Dr. R. Kirsch (Hoechst AG, Frankfurt, Germany). The 1-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]-6-(phenylthio)thymine derivative MKC-442 was kindly provided by Dr. M. Baba (Fukushima Medical College, Fukushima, Japan). The thiocarboxanilide derivative UC-781 (N-[4-chloro-3-(3-methyl-2-butenyloxy)phenyl]-2-methyl-3-furan-carbothioamide) was obtained from Uniroyal Chemical Ltd. (Middlebury, CT; Guelph, Ontario, Canada). Zidovudine (AZT), 2′,3′-dideoxyguanosine, and 2′,3′-dideoxyguanosine-5′-triphosphate (ddGTP) were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). AZT-TP and d4T-TP were provided by Dr. P. Herdewijn (Rega Institute, Leuven, Belgium). CEM cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). MT4 cells were provided by Dr. N. Yamamoto (Tokyo Medical School and Dental University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan). CEM cells were suspended at approximately 200,000 cells/ml culture medium and infected with wild-type recombinant HIV-I or position 318 mutated recombinant HIV-I strains. 100 μl of the infected cell suspensions were then added to 200-μl microtiter plate wells containing 100 μl of an appropriate dilution of the test compounds. After 4 days of incubation at 37 °C, the cell cultures were microscopically examined for syncytium formation. The EC50 (50% effective concentration) was determined as the compound concentration required to inhibit syncytium formation by 50%. All mutant enzymes used in this study were derived from the RT sequence cloned in pKRT2 (6D'Aquila R.T. Summers W.C. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 1989; 2: 579-587PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, Westburg, Leusden, Netherlands). Briefly, supercoiled double-stranded pKRT2 DNA and two synthetic oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation at position 318 and a silent mutation that creates a uniqueDraIII restriction site were used. The two primers, each of which was complementary to opposite strands of the vector, were extended during temperature cycling by means of Pfu DNA polymerase, leading to a mutated plasmid containing staggered nicks. After temperature cycling, the product was treated withDpnI. The DpnI endonuclease is specific for methylated and hemimethylated DNA and is used to digest the parental DNA template and to select for mutation-containing synthesized DNA. The nicked vector DNA containing the desired mutations was then transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue. The presence of the desired mutations was determined by restriction with DraIII and confirmed by sequencing the complete RT gene on an ABI Prism 310 sequencer (Perkin Elmer) using the dRhodamine terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Perkin Elmer). For the purpose of easy purification, a (His)6 tag was introduced at the amino terminus of the p66 subunit of the RT. AnEcoRI-NcoI fragment located just before the RT coding region of pKRT2 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction withULTma DNA polymerase and primers HJ20 (5′-GGATCCGGAATTCTCATGTTTGACAGC-3′) and HJ22 (5′-CGTACCATGGCGTGAT GGTGATGGTGATGGAGCATGGTCTGTTTCCTGTGTG-3′). In this way, theNcoI restriction site containing the start codon of the RT sequence was altered, and a new NcoI site was created after the (His)6 residues, which were in frame with the RT gene. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested withEcoRI and NcoI and ligated into pKRT2 digested with EcoRI and NcoI to create pKRT2His. The Tyr-318 mutations created in pKRT2 were cloned into pKRT2His by exchanging the NcoI-HindIII fragment that contained the RT gene. Recombinant HIV-I RT enzymes were expressed from a two-plasmid co-expression system, which was described earlier by Jonckheereet al. (7Jonckheere H. De Vreese K. Debyser Z. Vandekerckhove J. Balzarini J. Desmyter J. De Clercq E. Anné J. J. Virol. Methods. 1996; 61: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The p66 subunit of RT is expressed from pACYC66His, and the p51 subunit is expressed from pKRT51. To construct wild-type or position 318 mutated pACYC66His, wild-type or position 318 mutated pKRT2His was digested with MstI andEcoRI, and the RT-containing fragment was ligated into pACYC184 digested with ScaI and EcoRI. 800 ml of LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 10 μg/ml tetracycline were inoculated with an overnight culture of E. coli JM109 transformed with both plasmids of the expression system, wild-type or position 318 mutated pACYC66His and pKRT51. The culture was started at A 600 of 0.1 and incubated at 37 °C with vigorous shaking until the late logarithmic phase (A 600 about 1). Expression of recombinant RT was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. After 4 h, the cells were harvested, washed, and kept frozen overnight at −20 °C. Cell lysis was accomplished by mechanical pressure in an X-press (LKB; Pharmacia-Amersham, Roosendaal, Netherlands). The cell paste was resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 100 mm NaCl, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.9% glucose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10% glycerol) and subsequently placed in the X-press device, which was frozen at −30 °C. After lysis, the cell lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 rpm in a Sorval SS34. The supernatant was incubated with 4 ml of pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA-resin (QIAgen, Westburg, Netherlands) at 4 °C while rotating for at least 30 min. After sedimentation of the Ni-NTA-resin with the bound (His)6-tagged proteins, the column was formed and washed with 20 ml of wash buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 0.5 m NaCl, 25 mm imidazole, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol). The RT was eluted with 10 ml of the phosphate buffer containing 125 mm imidazole. The imidazole-containing buffer was exchanged by the heparin buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.05m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol), and the eluate was concentrated to 2 ml using Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filtration devices (Millipore, Brussels, Belgium). The (His)6-tagged RT was further purified to about 98% purity over a heparin column (Hitrap Heparin column; Pharmacia-Amersham). After the binding of the RT to the heparin column, elution was accomplished by a linear salt gradient of 0.05–1m NaCl. Heterodimer RT eluted at approximately 0.3m NaCl, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the eluted peak fractions. All fractions containing heterodimer RT were pooled and stored in a 50% glycerol buffer at −20 °C. Protein concentrations in the stock solutions were determined with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay using bovine serum albumin (Bio-Rad) as a standard. 25 ml of LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin were inoculated with an overnight culture ofE. coli XL1-Blue transformed with wild-type or position 318 mutated pKRT2His at an A 600 of 0.1. The culture was grown at 37 °C, induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for the expression of the p66 form of RT, and stored as described in the previous section. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and 10% glycerol) and sonicated. The lysate was centrifuged (12,000 rpm, 20 min), and the supernatant was stored at −80 °C in aliquots of 100 μl. For determination of the IC50 of the test compounds, the RT assay was performed as described previously (8Balzarini J. Perez-Perez M.-J. San-Felix A. Camarasa M.-J. Bathurst I.C. Barr P.J. De Clercq E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11831-11838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A fixed concentration of the labeled substrate [2,8-3H]dGTP (specific radioactivity, 3.6 Ci/mmol; 5.6 μm; 1 μCi) or [methyl-3H]dTTP (specific radioactivity, 51 Ci/mmol; 0.40 μm; 1 μCi) and a fixed concentration of the template primer poly(rC)·oligo(dG)12–18 (0.1 mm), poly(rA)·oligo(dT)12–18 (15 μm poly(rA) and 3.75 μm oligo(dT)12–18), or poly(dC)·oligo(dG)12–18 (0.1 mm) was used. The IC50 of the test compounds was determined as the compound concentration that inhibited recombinant RT activity by 50%. Recombinant viruses were obtained as described by Kellam and Larder (9Kellam P. Larder B.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant viruses were obtained through homologous recombination of RT with RT-deleted proviral DNA that was propagated in pHIVΔRTBstEII. The RT used in the recombination was the NcoI-HindIII fragment from pKRT2. MT4 cells were electroporated with ∼2 μg of RT DNA and ∼10 μg of pHIVΔRTBstEII DNA. Upon successful homologous recombination, viable recombinant virus could be recovered from the cell culture. The presence of the Tyr-318 mutations was verified by sequencing of the virus DNA samples in an automated laser fluorescent DNA sequencer using the Autoread T7 Sequencing kit from Pharmacia as described previously (10Pelemans H. Esnouf R. Dunkler A. Parniak M.A. Vandamme A.-M. Karlsson A. De Clercq E. Kleim J.-P. Balzarini J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8195-8203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Pelemans H. Esnouf R.

Using site-directed mutagenesis, we constructed six recombinant RTs replacing the wild-type amino acid residue Tyr-318 with Phe, Trp, His, Leu, Cys, and Lys. Phe, Trp, and His have aromatic side chains, but Phe is a neutral residue, whereas His is a positively charged residue, and Trp is a polar residue. Cys has a small polar side chain, Leu contains an aliphatic residue, and Lys has a positively charged function. The analysis of the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity revealed severely impaired RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities for four of the six recombinant RTs mutated at position 318 (Fig.3). Indeed, the Y318H, Y318K, Y318L, and Y318C mutant RTs displayed enzymatic activities ranging from 1.6 to 4.4% of wild-type RT. The Y318W mutant RT retained 73% of wild-type polymerase activity, whereas the Y318F mutant RT retained wild-type activity. The DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities showed a pattern similar to that of the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities; the Y318F and Y318W mutant RTs retained substantial DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity (54 and 95% of the wild-type activity, respectively), whereas the Y318H, Y318K, Y318L, and Y318C showed severely impaired DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities (Fig. 3). The two most active mutant RTs, Y318F and Y318W, were evaluated for their sensitivities to a variety of NNRTIs, to ddGTP (with [3H]dGTP as the radiolabeled substrate and poly(rC)·oligo(dG) as the template/primer), and to AZT-TP and d4T-TP (with [3H]dTTP as the radiolabeled substrate and poly(rA)·oligo(dT) as the template/primer) (TableI). The Y318F mutant RT retained substantial sensitivity to all of the NNRTIs tested. Of these NNRTIs, quinoxaline HBY 097 and UC-781 were the most inhibitory to both the wild-type and the Y318F mutant. MKC-442 and delavirdine were 6- to 9-fold less active against the Y318F mutant than against the wild-type enzyme (Table I). The nucleoside RT inhibitors ddGTP, AZT-TP, and d4T-TP retained full inhibitory activity against both the Y318F and Y318W mutant RTs. In contrast to the Y318F RT, the Y318W mutant RT showed a high level of resistance against tivirapine (73-fold) and loviride (35-fold). The thiocarboxanilide derivative UC-781, nevirapine, and MKC-442 were 6- to 16-fold less inhibitory against the Y318W mutant RT than against the wild-type RT. Quinoxaline HBY 097, TSAO-m3T, and delavirdine retained full inhibitory activity against Y318W RT (Table I).Table IInhibitory effects of NNRTIs against wild-type Tyr-318, and Y318F and Y318W mutant recombinant reverse transcriptasesTemplate/primerIC50 (μm)Tyr-318aThe IC50 of the compounds against the HIV-I RTs was determined using E. coli extracts as the source of the wild-type and mutant RTs.

Open table in a new tab In the two-plasmid co-expression system, the sequence of the p66 subunit of RT is cloned into pACYC184, whereas the sequence of the smaller p51 subunit is located on pKRT51 (7Jonckheere H. De Vreese K. Debyser Z. Vandekerckhove J. Balzarini J. Desmyter J. De Clercq E. Anné J. J. Virol. Methods. 1996; 61: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Tyr-318 in the p51 subunit has a role in resistance development, the position 318 mutations were introduced only in the p66 subunit of the p66/p51 heterodimer RT by cloning the MstI-EcoRI fragment of the position 318 mutated pKRT2His in pACYC184, whereas the p51 subunit was expressed by the pKRT51 plasmid containing wild-type Tyr-318. The catalytic activities of all single-mutated p66/p51 RTs (containing the mutations solely in p66) and the double-mutated p66/p66 RTs (containing the mutations in both p66 subunits) were then determined (data not shown). The same pattern of polymerase activity was seen for the double-mutated p66/p66 mutant RTs and the single-mutated p66/p51 RTs, namely, the Y318F and Y318W mutants were catalytically active, whereas the Y318C, Y318K, Y318H, and Y318L RT mutants were virtually inactive. The sensitivity of p66(Y318F)/p66(Y318F), p66(Y318F)/p51(Tyr-318), p66(Y318W)/p66(Y318W), and p66(Y318W)/p51(Tyr-318) recombinant RTs toward a variety of NNRTIs (i.e. UC-781, delavirdine, loviride, and tivirapine) and ddGTP was also determined (Fig.4). Each of the RT inhibitors displayed similar IC50 values, regardless of whether the position 318 mutation was present solely in the p66 subunit of the p66/p51 heterodimer or present in both p66 subunits of the p66/p66 homodimer (Fig. 4). An attempt was made to construct recombinant viruses harboring the Y318W, Y318F, Y318H, Y318L, Y318C, or Y318K mutations in their RT gene. Interestingly, only the Y318W and the Y318F mutant recombinant viruses could be recovered from the transfected cell cultures. Several attempts to construct viable recombinant viruses that contained Y318H, Y318C, Y318L, or Y318K mutant RT failed. The resistance profile of the Y318W and Y318F mutant recombinant viruses was determined against the same variety of NNRTIs as used above for the Y318W and Y318F mutant recombinant RTs (TableII). For the Y318W recombinant virus, the highest levels of resistance were noted for nevirapine (54-fold), loviride (26-fold), MKC-442 (20-fold), and tivirapine (18-fold). UC-781 and HBY 097 were only 5.5- and 3-fold less effective, respectively, and TSAO-m3T retained its full activity against the Y318W mutant virus (Table II). The Y318F mutant virus was, in general, less resistant to the NNRTIs than the Y318W mutant virus. MKC-442 showed the highest degree of resistance (30-fold), followed by delavirdine (17-fold), nevirapine (8-fold), and HBY 097 (7-fold). UC-781, tivirapine, and loviride remained highly active against the Y318F mutant virus and lost less than 4-fold of their activity. Thus, in agreement with our findings for mutant RTs, the resistance of the Y318F mutant virus against the NNRTIs was much less pronounced than that of the Y318W mutant virus.Table IISensitivity of wild-type and mutant recombinant HIV-I strains to NNRTIs and ddG in CEM cell culturesCompoundEC50 (μm) for recombinant mutant HIV-I strainsaEC50, 50% effective concentration or the compound concentration required to inhibit HIV-I-induced cytopathicity in CEM cell cultures by 50%.HIV-I/Tyr-318HIV-I/Y318FHIV-I/Y318WUC-7810.003 ± 0.00.010 ± 0.0040.016 ± 0.007TSAO-m3T0.035 ± 0.0030.21 ± 0.020.03 ± 0.02Nevirapine0.027 ± 0.00.21 ± 0.21.45 ± 0.8Delavirdine0.041 ± 0.020.71 ± 0.470.011 ± 0.001HBY 0970.0014 ± 0.0010.01 ± 0.010.0048 ± 0.0Loviride0.010 ± 0.0040.02 ± 0.0040.26 ± 0.13MKC-4420.003 ± 0.0020.091 ± 0.0050.06 ± 0.03Tivirapine0.018 ± 0.0040.05 ± 0.030.32 ± 0.01ddG8 ± 1016 ± 67 ± 5a EC50, 50% effective concentration or the compound concentration required to inhibit HIV-I-induced cytopathicity in CEM cell cultures by 50%. Open table in a new tab X-ray crystallographic analyses of HIV-I RTs complexed with NNRTIs and computer-assisted modeling studies of NNRTIs in the HIV-I RT have identified a number of amino acids that line the NNRTI-specific lipophilic pocket and consequently may play a role in the interaction with NNRTIs (Fig. 1). One of these amino acids is Tyr-318, whose functional hydroxyphenyl group points into the pocket, forming a hydrogen bond to the main chain of either His-235 or Lys-238. Tyr-318 is highly conserved among all HIV-I, HIV-II, and simian immunodeficiency virus strains that have been characterized thus far. There is only one HIV-I strain (i.e. ETH2220) reported that had a Phe instead of a Tyr at position 318 (12Korber B. Hahn B. Foley B. Mellors J.W. Leitner T. Myers G. McCutchan F. Kuiken C. Human Retroviruses and AIDS. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM1997Google Scholar). No functional and/or structural role has yet been identified for Tyr-318. Several NNRTIs interact relatively closely with Tyr-318 (3Esnouf R.M. Ren J. Hopkins A.L. Ross C.K. Jones E.Y. Stammers D. Stuart D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that only the mutant RTs bearing the conservative changes Y318F and Y318W show significant catalytic RT activity (i.e. 106 and 73%, respectively). Nonconservative mutations such as Y318L, Y318K, and Y318C showed only marginal RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities (<4% of the wild-type activity). The poor activity of the Y318H mutant RT was surprising because it retains an aromatic side chain, albeit a charged one. With these mutants, there may be a structural change resulting in a loss of viability of the enzyme. However, because the Y318W mutation can be accommodated in the RT without much loss of activity, it is tempting to suggest a functional role for an uncharged aromatic side chain at residue 318 of HIV-I RT. We have also demonstrated that the introduction of the Y318L, Y318K, Y318H, and Y318C mutations solely in the p66 subunit resulted in virtually inactive mutant enzymes. This observation is in full agreement with the crystallographic studies that revealed that amino acid residue 318 in the p66 subunit is part of the NNRTI characteristic pocket, whereas in the p51 subunit, it is part of a solvent-exposed loop distant from the enzyme active site. Because we have not introduced the lethal amino acids (i.e. Leu, Lys, His, and Cys) at position 318 solely in the p51 subunit, we cannot unambiguously exclude a potential role of Tyr-318 in the p51 enzymatic activity, although it is highly unlikely. Both the Y318W and Y318F mutant RTs showed low-level resistance against MKC-442 and no resistance against quinoxaline HBY 097 or TSAO-m3T. Delavirdine lost some of its inhibitory activity against the Y318F mutant RT but remained active against the Y318W mutant RT, whereas the other NNRTIs (tivirapine, loviride, nevirapine, and UC-781) lost inhibitory activity against Y318W mutant RT but remained markedly active against Y318F mutant RT. Crystallographic data have shown that certain NNRTIs interact with the aromatic ring of Tyr-318, and these interactions may be preserved with the Y318F mutant RT. The presence of a bulkier side chain, as in the Y318W mutant, gives greater resistance to several NNRTIs but confers a marginal sensitization to delavirdine. Based on the crystal structures of wild-type RT complexed with NNRTIs, we can suggest three possible mechanisms for the resistance of the Y318W mutant to NNRTIs: (a) there may simply be a destabilization of the RT/NNRTI complex due to a change in the direct interactions between the inhibitor and Y318W; (b) the extra bulk of Y318W may cause a slight repositioning of Leu-100, a residue that forms extensive contacts with all NNRTIs; and (c) the Y318W mutation may change the pattern of hydrogen bonding involving the side chain of residue 318. In the structure of the unliganded wild-type RT (4Esnouf R. Ren J. Ross C. Jones Y. Stammers D. Stuart D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), there are hydrogen bonds from the Oη of Tyr-318 to the main chain oxygen of Lys-238 and a weak one to the main chain nitrogen of His-235 that are broken upon complex formation with the drug. Y318W RT may instead contain a hydrogen bond between the Nε1 atom of Y318W and the main chain oxygen atom of His-235, affecting the ability of Pro-236 to act as a “trap door” (14Hopkins A.L. Ren J. Esnouf R.M. Willcox B.E. Jones E.Y. Ross C. Miyasaka T. Walker R.T. Tanaka H. Stammers D.K. Stuart D.I. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) that closes in behind the inhibitors once they are in the NNRTI binding pocket. This effect may, in turn, lead to a decreased sensitivity of NNRTIs against the mutant RT. Changes affecting residue Pro-236 might be expected to have an anomalous effect on delavirdine (3Esnouf R.M. Ren J. Hopkins A.L. Ross C.K. Jones E.Y. Stammers D. Stuart D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3984-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), which is in agreement with our present data. To assess the impact of a mutational change at position 318 in HIV-I, we attempted to construct recombinant viruses bearing mutations at residue 318 in their RT genes. We were repeatedly unsuccessful in making recombinant viruses harboring mutations Y318H, Y318L, Y318K, and Y318C. We demonstrated that the corresponding RTs have unusually low DNA polymerase activities, and this may explain the failure to construct mutant HIV-I strains containing mutations at position 318 that severely compromise the catalytic activity of the RT. Only the Y318F and Y318W RT mutant viruses could be constructed, with their corresponding RT possessing wild-type (Y318F) or moderately decreased (Y318W) catalytic activities. When CEM cell cultures were infected with wild-type and the Y318F and Y318W RT recombinant virus strains at an identical p24 input, we could not find striking differences in virus replication based on the appearance of p24 in the cell culture supernatants (data not shown). Obviously, the (moderately) lower catalytic RT activity found for the Y318W RT enzyme was not rate limiting and was not low enough to affect the replication capacity of the mutant virus strain in CEM cells. The position 318 mutated recombinant viruses showed a resistance/sensitivity profile similar to that of the corresponding position 318 mutated RTs for the majority of the compounds. When all of the compounds listed in Tables I and II were taken together, strong correlations were found between the EC50s of the NNRTIs for the mutant HIV-I strains and the IC50s of the NNRTIs for the corresponding mutant RTs (correlation coefficient r= 0.88 for wild-type virus and enzyme, correlation coefficientr = 0.92 for Y318F mutant virus and enzyme, and correlation coefficient r = 0.98 for Y318W mutant virus and enzyme). However, in a few cases, differences were observed between the RT and the virus assays with regard to the sensitivity/resistance spectrum of the drugs (e.g. tivirapine). Indeed, the antiviral activity of tivirapine against Y318W mutated virus was much less pronounced than expected from the RT sensitivity data. We do not have a clear-cut understanding of this phenomenon. A plausible explanation, however, is that the RT experiments were performed under artificial conditions using poly(rC)·oligo(dG) as the template/primer instead of the endogenous natural template of the virus. It is likely that the conformation of the NNRTI pocket and the interaction of the mutant enzyme with the template/primer may differ, depending on the nature of the mutation in the enzyme. Therefore, the interaction of the drug (e.g. tivirapine) with the mutant enzyme (e.g. Y318W) in the presence of the artificial template/primer may not be as optimal as that for the other drugs. Thus, it cannot be excluded that the RT assay system using poly(rC)·oligo(dG) as the template/primer is suboptimal for some compounds under our experimental conditions, resulting in an underestimation or overestimation of their anti-RT activity. The lower RT catalytic activity of the Y318W RT mutant virus most likely has no major impact on the sensitivity of the mutant virus to the NNRTIs. We found that a 5-fold difference in multiplicity of infection did not significantly affect the sensitivity of the virus to the NNRTIs HBY 097, UC-781, MKC-442, and nevirapine. The EC50 values for high and low multiplicity of infection were 0.003 and 0.002 μm for HBY097, 0.003 and 0.001 μm for UC-781, 0.007 and 0.004 μm for MKC-442, and 0.061 and 0.034 μm for nevirapine, respectively. Thus, it is unlikely that – if the lower catalytic activity of the Y318W RT enzyme should result in lower replication efficiency - this would markedly affect the sensitivity of the mutant virus for the NNRTIs. Although interactions between several NNRTIs and residue 318 are observed in RT/NNRTI complexes, optimizing these interactions has not been a primary goal for drug design. By identifying the importance of Tyr-318 for enzyme viability, this study now suggests that targeting Tyr-318, particularly the aromatic ring, should be a good strategy. With this in mind, we have reexamined the crystal structures of RT/NNRTI complexes. The RT/delavirdine complex (3Esnouf R.M. Ren J. Hopkins A.L. Ross C.K. Jones E.Y. Stammers D. Stuart D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3984-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) shows the closest interactions involving Tyr-318 (Fig. 2), leaving very little room for alterations. However, attaching a hydroxymethyl group to position 3 of the indole ring may facilitate hydrogen bonding with Tyr-318, and a methyl group added at position 2 of the piperazine ring may interact well with the aromatic ring of residue 318. The RT/9-chloro-TIBO complex (15Ren J. Esnouf R. Hopkins A. Ross C. Jones Y. Stammers D. Stuart D. Structure. 1995; 3: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) shows that substituents on position 10 of the TIBO ring would be well positioned to interact with the face of the Tyr-318 ring. Whereas a hydroxyl substituent may give the optimum interaction, it is interesting to note that 9,10-chloro-TIBO (R85255) has been found to be similarly active (IC50 = 25 nm; Ref. 16Pauwels R. Adams J. Merluzzi V.J. The Search for Antiviral Drugs: Case Histories from Concept to Clinic. Birkhauser, Boston, MA1993: 71-104Crossref Google Scholar) to 9-chloro-TIBO (IC50 = 33 nm). With other NNRTIs, the geometry of the binding site makes it difficult to fully exploit Tyr-318. Nevirapine (and close analogues) may benefit from a 7-hydroxyl group, which might be able to hydrogen bond to Tyr-318. For the 1-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]-6-(phenylthio)thymine (HEPT) derivatives, the oxygen at position 2 comes very close to the ring of Tyr-318, suggesting that a replacement with sulfur or more drastic changes to the thymine ring to allow an amine or hydroxy group in the equivalent position are worth exploring. The RT/loviride complex structure (13Ren J. Esnouf R. Garman E. Somers D. Ross C. Kirby I. Keeling J. Darby G. Jones Y. Stuart D. Stammers D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) offers little hope for targeting Tyr-318. In conclusion, Tyr-318 represents a highly conserved amino acid among all known HIV-I, HIV-II, and simian immunodeficiency virus RTs. Its functionality is severely compromised upon mutation to other nonaromatic amino acids. Mutations at this amino acid site of RT either led to a virtually inactive enzyme (i.e. Y318L, Y318K, Y318C, and Y318H) or to a viable enzyme (i.e. Y318F and Y318W) that shows little, if any, resistance against several NNRTIs, including HBY 097 and UC-781. Therefore, it is unlikely that mutations at position 318 will appear under selective pressure of these drugs in cell culture or in HIV-I-infected individuals, because they virtually suppress the mutant viruses and RT enzymes to a similar extent as the wild-type virus and RT enzyme. However, it cannot be excluded that Y318F or Y318W RT mutant HIV-I might emerge under selective pressure of other NNRTIs that showed a more pronounced loss of antiviral activity (i.e. delavirdine and MKC-442 for Y318F RT mutant virus and nevirapine, loviride, MKC-442, and tivirapine for Y318W RT mutant virus). Thus, our site-directed mutagenesis data and recombinant mutant virus constructs indicate that the amino acid residue Tyr-318 could be a suitable target for novel NNRTIs with improved potency and increased ability to suppress virus drug resistance development.

Three residues (Ala-83, Gln-86, and Ala-92) in human lysozyme are characteristically mutated to Lys, Asp, and Asp, respectively, in natural Ca2+ binding lysozymes and α-lactalbumins. The effects of these mutations on the stability and Ca2+ binding properties of human lysozyme were investigated using calorimetry and were interpreted with crystal structures. The double mutant, in which Glu-86 and Ala-92 were replaced with Asp, clearly showed Ca2+ binding affinity, whereas neither point mutant showed Ca2+ affinity, indicating that both residues are essential. The further mutation of Ala-83 → Lys did not affect the Ca2+ binding of the double mutant. The point mutations Ala-83 → Lys and Glu-86 → Asp did not affect the stability, whereas the mutation Ala-92 → Asp was about 1.3 kcal/mol less stable. Structural analyses showed that both Asp-86 and Lys-83 were exposed to solvent. Side chains of Asp-86 and Asp-91 were rotated in opposite directions about χ1 angle, as if to reduce the electrostatic repulsion.

Calcium binding proteins are known to take part in several important functions in biological systems (1Levine B.A. Williams R.J.P. Cheung W.-Y. Calcium and Cell Function. II. Academic Press, New York1982: 1-38Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding sometimes accompanies conformational changes, which are considered to be responsible for biological functions such as signal transduction and the formation of macromolecular complexes. Ca2+ binding sites usually consist of several acidic residues chelating to bound Ca2+ in a pentagonal bipyramidal manner (2Strynadka N.C.J. James M.N.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 905-914Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The close locations of acidic residues in a Ca2+ binding site should negatively affect protein stability due to charge repulsion between the acidic residues. How does the introduction of charged residues within a calcium binding site affect the stability and Ca2+ binding behavior? There are some reports describing the effect of mutations within Ca2+ binding sites on the stability of the protein (3Kuroki R. Kawakita H. Nakamura H. Yutani K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our approach in this paper is to introduce the minimum perturbation by amino acid replacement and determine the effect of these mutations on the stability and the Ca2+ binding function using calorimetry. Furthermore, these effects are interpreted in terms of the structural information from x-ray crystallography. For this purpose, we chose human lysozyme because lysozymes are known to be a suitable model for studying protein function and stability (3Kuroki R. Kawakita H. Nakamura H. Yutani K. Proc. Natl.

More than 90 sequences of chicken type lysozymes and α-lactalbumins are in the sequence data base. Among these lysozymes, several have been found to have Ca2+ binding ability (8Nitta K. Tsuge H.

Three residues (Ala-83, Gln-86, and Ala-92) in human lysozyme are usually mutated to Lys, Asp, and Asp, respectively, in natural Ca2+ binding lysozymes and α-lactalbumins as shown in Fig.1. We have already found that only the double mutation (Gln-86 → Asp and Ala-92 → Asp) in human lysozyme resulted in the formation of a Ca2+ binding site (5Kuroki R. Taniyama Y. Seko C. Nakamura H.

Blake C.C.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 152: 737-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and Ca2+binding mutant (13Inaka K. Kuroki R. Kikuchi M. Matsushima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20666-20671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) lysozymes from x-ray crystallography are available. Here we show the effect of the subsequent mutations (Gln-86 → Asp, Ala-92 → Asp, and Ala-83 → Lys) on the Ca2+ binding properties, conformational stabilities, and tertiary structures of these mutants. It was found that both aspartic acids (Asp-86 and Asp-86) are essential for Ca2+ binding. The introduction of an aspartic acid at the Ala-92 position resulted in destabilization of lysozyme, whereas the introduction of an aspartic acid at the Gln-86 position or the introduction of positive charge the Ala-83 position did not affect the stability. The observed instability with the Ala-92 → Asp mutation is proposed to result from the difference in the hydration effect.DISCUSSIONSeveral acidic residues accompanying some basic residues are characteristically associated to make a Ca2+ binding site in Ca2+ binding proteins. Acidic residues are found to directly chelate to Ca2+ in a pentagonal bipyramidal manner (2Strynadka N.C.J. James M.N.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 905-914Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13Inaka K. Kuroki R. Kikuchi M. Matsushima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20666-20671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and some basic residues located in the vicinity of Ca2+ binding sites appear to provide a counter ion charge to the chelating residues. Three chelating aspartic acids, Asp-86, Asp-91, and Asp-92 and the positively charged Lys-83 are conserved in Ca2+ binding lysozymes and α-lactalbumins. Because Asp-91 already exists in wild type human lysozyme (Fig. 1), the effect of the three mutations, Gln-86 → Asp, Ala-92 → Asp, and Ala-83 → Lys on the stability and affinity of Ca2+ was investigated using calorimetry. In Table V, the effect of the mutations on the stability is summarized, in which ΔΔG at 80 °C was calculated according to Becktel and Shellman (27Becktel W.J. Schellman J.A. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1859-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar) by assuming that ΔS and ΔC p values of Ca2+ bound and unbound mutants are the same as those of the holo-Q86D/A92D and the wild type lysozymes, respectively, as reported previously (3Kuroki R. Kawakita H. Nakamura H. Yutani K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6803-6807Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the presence of 10 mm Ca2+, the mutant A83K/Q86D/A92D showed about 3.6 kcal/mol stabilization, which is similar to that of Q86D/A92D lysozyme. Other mutants, Q86D and A92D lysozymes, did not show any stabilization in the presence of Ca2+. According to Schellman (28Schellman J.A. Biopolymers. 1975; 14: 999-1018Crossref Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 29Schellman J.A. Biopolymers. 1976; 15: 999-1000Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the existence of ligand binding sites, such as a Ca2+ binding site, should improve the stability of the protein in the presence of Ca2+. Therefore, the addition of 10 mmCaCl2, which is about 100 times in excess of the protein concentration, should result in stabilization of the protein. In both Q86D and A92D mutant lysozymes, however, no stabilization was observed in the presence of Ca2+ (unlike the mutants Q86D/A92D and A83K/Q86D/A92D). This indicates that both the Q86D and A92D mutants do not have Ca2+ affinity, which is consistent with the results of the binding experiments as listed in Table III. This also indicates that both acidic residues Asp-86 and Asp-92 are essential for Ca2+ binding in the mutant human lysozyme. In the absence of Ca2+, we can evaluate the effect of the mutation on the stability of lysozyme. The stability of Q86D lysozyme was almost the same as that of the wild type lysozyme, indicating no affect of the mutation from Gln-86 to Asp. The A92D lysozyme was about 1.3 kcal/mol less stable than the wild type, which is similar to the apo-Q86D/A92D and apo-A83K/Q86D/A92D lysozymes, indicating that the mutation Ala-83 to Lys did not affect the stability but the mutation Ala-92 to Asp resulted in 1.3 kcal/mol destabilization.Table VThermodynamic parameters for the unfolding of the mutant human lysozymes (A83K/Q86D/A92D, Q86D, and A92D)Lysozyme[Ca2+]T dΔT dΔΔG bΔΔG values were extrapolated to 80 °C.

Open table in a new tab To interpret the stability in terms of the structural information, high resolution structural data were obtained from x-ray crystallography. Although these aspartic side chains are located within 5 Å distance to chelate Ca2+ (holo-Q86D/A92D and holo-A83K/Q86D/A92D lysozymes in Figs. 2 c and 3), the introduction of aspartic acid at position 86 resulted in a shift of the side chain conformation toward the outside of the site as if to reduce the charge repulsion to Asp-91 (Q86D lysozyme in Fig. 3). The charged groups of Asp-86, Asp-92, and Lys-83 are now located 7.5, 6.6, and 10 Å apart from Asp-91 in the wild type lysozyme, the mutations Gln-86 → Asp or Ala-83 → Lys did not affect the stability. It indicates that a charged cluster formed when constructing a Ca2+ binding site does not always decrease the protein stability. Only a small rotation of the side chain may be enough to reduce the repulsion between the charges because of the solvent shielding. It has been reported that an ion pair located on the surface of a protein does not always affect the stability of the protein (30Sun D.P. Sauer U. Nicholson H. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7142-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a destabilization was observed for the mutation Ala-92 → Asp. One explanation for this destabilization is the difference in hydration between the Ala and Asp side chains upon unfolding. The tertiary structure of the mutant A92D indicated that the side chain of Asp-92 is almost buried and the side chain conformation was quite similar to those of the apo-and holo-Q86D/A92D lysozyme (Fig.3). According to Oobatake and Ooi (31Oobatake M. Ooi T. J. Biochemistry. 1989; 104: 433-439Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 32Oobatake M. Ooi T. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 59: 237-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), the difference in hydration free energy between alanine and aspartate is calculated to be about 2.5 kcal/mol at 80 °C. Because Asp-92 in the mutant and Ala-92 in the wild type structures are almost buried with the accessible surface areas of these amino acids calculated to be less than 3 Å2, the difference in hydration is considered to be the major part of the instability (1–2 kcal/mol in Table V) observed in the mutants having Asp-92. The smaller than expected effect on stability may be caused by the weak binding of Na+ ion to Asp-92 in the native state as seen in the crystal structures of the A92D and apo-Q86D/A92D lysozyme. Calcium binding proteins are known to take part in several important functions in biological systems (1Levine B.A. Williams R.J.P. Cheung W.-Y. Calcium and Cell Function. II. Academic Press, New York1982: 1-38Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding sometimes accompanies conformational changes, which are considered to be responsible for biological functions such as signal transduction and the formation of macromolecular complexes. Ca2+ binding sites usually consist of several acidic residues chelating to bound Ca2+ in a pentagonal bipyramidal manner (2Strynadka N.C.J. James M.N.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 905-914Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The close locations of acidic residues in a Ca2+ binding site should negatively affect protein stability due to charge repulsion between the acidic residues. How does the introduction of charged residues within a calcium binding site affect the stability and Ca2+ binding behavior? There are some reports describing the effect of mutations within Ca2+ binding sites on the stability of the protein (3Kuroki R. Kawakita H. Nakamura H. Yutani K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6803-6807Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Haezebrouck P. De Baetselier A. Joniau M. Van Deal H. Rosenberg S. Hanssens I. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our approach in this paper is to introduce the minimum perturbation by amino acid replacement and determine the effect of these mutations on the stability and the Ca2+ binding function using calorimetry. Furthermore, these effects are interpreted in terms of the structural information from x-ray crystallography. For this purpose, we chose human lysozyme because lysozymes are known to be a suitable model for studying protein function and stability (3Kuroki R. Kawakita H. Nakamura H. Yutani K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6803-6807Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 5Kuroki R. Taniyama Y. Seko C. Nakamura H. Kikuchi M. Ikehara M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

More than 90 sequences of chicken type lysozymes and α-lactalbumins are in the sequence data base. Among these lysozymes, several have been found to have Ca2+ binding ability (8Nitta K. Tsuge H. Sugai S. Shimazaki K. FEBS Lett. 1987; 223: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 9Nitta K. Tsuge H. Shimazaki K. Sugai S. Biol. Chem.

Three residues (Ala-83, Gln-86, and Ala-92) in human lysozyme are usually mutated to Lys, Asp, and Asp, respectively, in natural Ca2+ binding lysozymes and α-lactalbumins as shown in Fig.1. We have already found that only the double mutation (Gln-86 → Asp and Ala-92 → Asp) in human lysozyme resulted in the formation of a Ca2+ binding site (5Kuroki R. Taniyama Y. Seko C. Nakamura H. Kikuchi M. Ikehara M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6903-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The precise analyses of the stability (3Kuroki R. Kawakita H. Nakamura H.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24297-24301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using calorimetry have also been performed, and the high resolution structural data of the wild type (12Artymiuk P.J. Blake C.C.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 152: 737-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and Ca2+binding mutant (13Inaka K. Kuroki R. Kikuchi M. Matsushima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20666-20671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) lysozymes from x-ray crystallography are available. Here we show the effect of the subsequent mutations (Gln-86 → Asp, Ala-92 → Asp, and Ala-83 → Lys) on the Ca2+ binding properties, conformational stabilities, and tertiary structures of these mutants. It was found that both aspartic acids (Asp-86 and Asp-86) are essential for Ca2+ binding. The introduction of an aspartic acid at the Ala-92 position resulted in destabilization of lysozyme, whereas the introduction of an aspartic acid at the Gln-86 position or the introduction of positive charge the Ala-83 position did not affect the stability. The observed instability with the Ala-92 → Asp mutation is proposed to result from the difference in the hydration effect. DISCUSSIONSeveral acidic residues accompanying some basic residues are characteristically associated to make a Ca2+ binding site in Ca2+ binding proteins. Acidic residues are found to directly chelate to Ca2+ in a pentagonal bipyramidal manner (2Strynadka N.C.J. James M.N.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 905-914Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13Inaka K. Kuroki R. Kikuchi M. Matsushima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20666-20671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and some basic residues located in the vicinity of Ca2+ binding sites appear to provide a counter ion charge to the chelating residues. Three chelating aspartic acids, Asp-86, Asp-91, and Asp-92 and the positively charged Lys-83 are conserved in Ca2+ binding lysozymes and α-lactalbumins. Because Asp-91 already exists in wild type human lysozyme (Fig. 1), the effect of the three mutations, Gln-86 → Asp, Ala-92 → Asp, and Ala-83 → Lys on the stability and affinity of Ca2+ was investigated using calorimetry. In Table V, the effect of the mutations on the stability is summarized, in which ΔΔG at 80 °C was calculated according to Becktel and Shellman (27Becktel W.J. Schellman J.A. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1859-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar) by assuming that ΔS and ΔC p values of Ca2+ bound and unbound mutants are the same as those of the holo-Q86D/A92D and the wild type lysozymes, respectively, as reported previously (3Kuroki R. Kawakita H. Nakamura H. Yutani K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6803-6807Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the presence of 10 mm Ca2+, the mutant A83K/Q86D/A92D showed about 3.6 kcal/mol stabilization, which is similar to that of Q86D/A92D lysozyme. Other mutants, Q86D and A92D lysozymes, did not show any stabilization in the presence of Ca2+. According to Schellman (28Schellman J.A. Biopolymers. 1975; 14: 999-1018Crossref Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 29Schellman J.A. Biopolymers. 1976; 15: 999-1000Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the existence of ligand binding sites, such as a Ca2+ binding site, should improve the stability of the protein in the presence of Ca2+. Therefore, the addition of 10 mmCaCl2, which is about 100 times in excess of the protein concentration, should result in stabilization of the protein. In both Q86D and A92D mutant lysozymes, however, no stabilization was observed in the presence of Ca2+ (unlike the mutants Q86D/A92D and A83K/Q86D/A92D). This indicates that both the Q86D and A92D mutants do not have Ca2+ affinity, which is consistent with the results of the binding experiments as listed in Table III. This also indicates that both acidic residues Asp-86 and Asp-92 are essential for Ca2+ binding in the mutant human lysozyme. In the absence of Ca2+, we can evaluate the effect of the mutation on the stability of lysozyme. The stability of Q86D lysozyme was almost the same as that of the wild type lysozyme, indicating no affect of the mutation from Gln-86 to Asp. The A92D lysozyme was about 1.3 kcal/mol less stable than the wild type, which is similar to the apo-Q86D/A92D and apo-A83K/Q86D/A92D lysozymes, indicating that the mutation Ala-83 to Lys did not affect the stability but the mutation Ala-92 to Asp resulted in 1.3 kcal/mol destabilization.Table VThermodynamic parameters for the unfolding of the mutant human lysozymes (A83K/Q86D/A92D, Q86D, and A92D)Lysozyme[Ca2+]T dΔT dΔΔG bΔΔG values were extrapolated to 80 °C.

Open table in a new tab To interpret the stability in terms of the structural information, high resolution structural data were obtained from x-ray crystallography. Although these aspartic side chains are located within 5 Å distance to chelate Ca2+ (holo-Q86D/A92D and holo-A83K/Q86D/A92D lysozymes in Figs. 2 c and 3), the introduction of aspartic acid at position 86 resulted in a shift of the side chain conformation toward the outside of the site as if to reduce the charge repulsion to Asp-91 (Q86D lysozyme in Fig. 3). The charged groups of Asp-86, Asp-92, and Lys-83 are now located 7.5, 6.6, and 10 Å apart from Asp-91 in the wild type lysozyme, the mutations Gln-86 → Asp or Ala-83 → Lys did not affect the stability. It indicates that a charged cluster formed when constructing a Ca2+ binding site does not always decrease the protein stability. Only a small rotation of the side chain may be enough to reduce the repulsion between the charges because of the solvent shielding. It has been reported that an ion pair located on the surface of a protein does not always affect the stability of the protein (30Sun D.P. Sauer U. Nicholson H. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7142-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a destabilization was observed for the mutation Ala-92 → Asp. One explanation for this destabilization is the difference in hydration between the Ala and Asp side chains upon unfolding. The tertiary structure of the mutant A92D indicated that the side chain of Asp-92 is almost buried and the side chain conformation was quite similar to those of the apo-and holo-Q86D/A92D lysozyme (Fig.3).

Raven Press, New York1990: 1197-1216Google Scholar) which is a major component of the placenta-specific renin-angiotensin system, predominant in amniotic fluid (9Tewksbury D.A. Tryon E.S. Burrill R.E. Dart R.A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1986; 158: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Tewksbury D.A. Tryon E.S. Am. J. Hypertens. 1989; 2: 411-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and in extracts of placental tissue (11Lenz T. Sealey J.E. Tewksbury D.A. Placenta. 1993; 14: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The plasma of men and menstruating women contains around 5% of the total angiotensinogen as HMW angiotensinogen (12Tewksbury D.A. Dart R.A. Hypertension. 1981; 4: 729-734Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Shionoiri H. Eggena P. Barrett J.D. Thananopavarn C. Golub M.S. Eggena R. Nakamura R. Judd H.L. Sambhi M.P. Biochem.

Endocrinol. 1985; 109: 257-262Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and this can reach 9.6% in women on estrogen contraceptive (12Tewksbury D.A. Dart R.A. Hypertension. 1981; 4: 729-734Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The percentage of the HMW form increases to 16% in normal pregnancy, and can reach 25–28% in pregnancy-induced hypertension (12Tewksbury D.A. Dart R.A. Hypertension. 1981; 4: 729-734Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies have shown that renin produces angiotensin I (Ang I) 1.9 times faster from monomeric than from HMW angiotensinogen at physiological pH (15Tryon E.S. Tewksbury D.A. Hypertens. Pregnancy. 1995; 14: 327-338Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Previous studies using disulfide bridge reduction (16Sato Y. Hiwada K. Kokubu T. Life Sci. 1985; 37: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and immunoreactivity analysis (17Campbell D.J. Bouhnik J. Coezy E. Ménard J. Corvol P. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1880-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have suggested that the HMW angiotensinogen could be a covalent complex of monomeric angiotensinogen with other angiotensinogen molecules, or other proteins. Recently, the purification of the proform of the human eosinophil major basic protein (proMBP) from the serum of pregnant women revealed two circulating heterodimeric complexes of angiotensinogen and proMBP covalently linked by disulfide bonds. These complexes were a 2:2 complex of angiotensinogen and proMBP, or a 2:2:2 complex of angiotensinogen, proMBP and complement C3dg (18Oxvig C. Haaning J. Kristensen L. Wagner J.M. Rubin I. Stigbrand T. Gleich G.J. Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13645-13651Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). They could contribute, at least in part, to HMW angiotensinogen. The sequence of human angiotensinogen contains four cysteine residues at amino acid positions 18, 138, 232, and 308. Only the Cys18 and Cys138 are present in all four mammalian species cloned so far (19Okhubo H. Kageyama R. Ujihara M. Hirose T. Inayama S. Nakanishi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2196-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 20Kageyama R. Okhubo H. Nakanishi S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3603-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 21Clouston W.M.

Biotech. Biochem. 1994; 58: 1884-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Nothing is known about the possible presence of a disulfide bond in angiotensinogen, and consequently which cysteine could interact with proMBP. This study was done to identify cysteine residue of human angiotensinogen involved in a disulfide bridge with proMBP and to study the formation and the function of the angiotensinogen·proMBP complex in vitro. We carried out site-directed mutagenesis of single cysteine residues and combinations of them in 8 mutants of human angiotensinogen. Analysis of these mutants, and of a fully deglycosylated human angiotensinogen, indicated a disulfide bond between Cys18 and Cys138. We produced a recombinant angiotensinogen·proMBP complex and demonstrated that Cys232 is needed for the formation of this complex which is influenced by the M235T substitution. Finally, human renin hydrolyzed this complex 7 times slower than the monomeric recombinant human angiotensinogen. Pure human recombinant renin was a gift from Hoffman-La Roche (Basel, Switzerland). The full-length cDNA of human eosinophil granule MBP cloned into the EcoRI site of pUC 12 was kindly provided by Dr. Gerald Gleich (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) and the J163-15E specific proMBP monoclonal antibody was a gift from Dr. Lars Sottrup-Jensen (University of Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark). Cell culture reagents and fetal calf serum were obtained from Boehringer-Mannheim (Meylan, France). Chemicals were purchased from Sigma and chromatography columns from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals (Uppsala, Sweden). Molecular masses were estimated by comparison with prestained SDS-PAGE molecular mass markers from Bio-Rad or with14C-methylated proteins from Amersham. Large scale production and non-denaturing purification methods of recombinant wild-type human angiotensinogen will be described elsewhere. 2J. Célérier, G. Schmid, A-P. Gimenez-Roqueplo, P. Corvol, and X. Jeunemaitre, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, pure Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line overproducing wild-type human angiotensinogen (23Gimenez-Roqueplo A-P. Leconte I. Cohen P. Simon D. Guyene T.T. Célérier J. Pau B. Corvol P. Clauser E. Jeunemaitre X. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9838-9844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was expanded into cell factories and depleted into serum-free medium in order to produce 50 to 80 mg of recombinant protein. The non-denaturing purification of recombinant angiotensinogen was performed by a three-step procedure which included the following: chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose, concanavalin A-Sepharose, and Mono Q. The final product exhibited the theoretical specific activity: 26 μg of Ang I/mg of protein. Free cysteines were detected by incubating purified recombinant human angiotensinogen (100 μg) in 500 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.6, 6 m guanidium chloride with 1 μCi of iodo[14C]acetic acid (Amersham) for 60 min in the dark at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding an excess of cold iodoacetic acid (80 mm). The radiolabeled angiotensinogen was desalted on a PD10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and concentrated by ultrafiltration through a 30-kDa cut-off membrane (Millipore). It was analyzed by 9% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Negative controls were performed with the same amount of angiotensinogen incubated directly with iodo[14C]acetic acid and a large excess of cold iodoacetic acid (80 mm). A 3-fold concentrate of CHO cell supernatant containing fullyN-deglycosylated angiotensinogen protein (∼15 pmol) previously characterized (24Gimenez-Roqueplo A-P. Célérier J. Lucarelli G. Corvol P. Jeunemaitre X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE in non-reducing and reducing conditions (+dithiothreitol (DTT) 10 mm) after denaturation (4 min at 94 °C). The gel was immediately stained using the colloidal blue stain kit (Novex). A piece of gel containing a 48-kDa band (which was not present in the untransfected CHO cell supernatant used as a control) was excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) according to Ref. 25Fountoulakis M. Langen H. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar. The disulfide bond in purified recombinant angiotensinogen (10 μg) was reduced by incubating with 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, containing 1% (v/v) glycerol and 10−2 to 10 mm DTT at 50 °C for 10 min. The newly generated free sulfhydryl groups were alkylated by adding 10 mm iodoacetic acid for 30 min at room temperature. Traces of reducing and alkylating agents were removed by extensive dialysis. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting for their reaction with an antibody directed against the NH2-terminal part of Ang I called N1345 (diluted 1/1000). This anti-Ang I antibody was made using a synthetic peptide containing the NH2-terminal part of Ang I sequence (hAGT(1–6-Cys7): NH2-Asp1-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His6-Cys-COOH). The cysteine residue was added to direct the antibody against the NH2-terminal region. The peptide was covalently S-S coupled to keyhole limpel hemocyanin as carrier protein and injected into rabbits. The antibodies against this peptide were characterized by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (specific titer: 1/4000) (ANAWA Trading SA, Biomedicals Services and Products, Zurich). The specificity of the reaction against whole angiotensinogen was checked by negative controls with preimmune serum from the same rabbit, competition with peptide concentrations of 10 nm to 1 μm, and reaction with the des-Ang I-angiotensinogen. Samples were also analyzed for their ability to generate Ang I after hydrolysis with human renin (1.25 nm) by enzymatic assay (23Gimenez-Roqueplo A-P. Leconte I. Cohen P. Simon D. Guyene T.T.

Results are expressed as the ratio between the amount of Ang I generated in each reduced condition and the amount of Ang I generated without DTT and with alkylating agent (100%). The human angiotensinogen cDNA (26Gaillard I. Clauser E. Corvol P. DNA (N. Y.). 1989; 8: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) codes for a Met in position 235 and contains four cysteine residues at positions 18, 138, 232, and 308. It has been subcloned into the eucaryotic expression vector pECE (23Gimenez-Roqueplo A-P. Leconte I. Cohen P. Simon D. Guyene T.T. Célérier J. Pau B. Corvol P. Clauser E. Jeunemaitre X. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9838-9844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of Met235 to Thr and of each Cys (at positions 18, 138, 232, and 308) to Ala was performed with the same procedure previously described (24Gimenez-Roqueplo A-P. Célérier J. Lucarelli G. Corvol P. Jeunemaitre X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). One of the following antisense mutagenesis oligonucleotide was used: (Met235-Thr) 5′-GTCCACACTGGCTCCCGTCAGGGAGCAGCCAGT-3′; (Cys18-Ala) 5′-CGCGAGCTGCTCAGCGGTACTCTCATT-3′; (Cys138-Ala) 5′-CAGCCGGGAGGTGGCGTTCTTGTCCTT-3′; (Cys232-Ala) 5′-TCCCATCAGGGAGGCGCCAGTCTTGGA-3′; (Cys308-Ala) 5′-GATCAGCAGCAGGGCGGCGCTCTCAGT-3′. Five single mutant hAGT cDNAs were produced: M235T, C18A, C138A, C232A, and C308A and used for a second and third round of mutagenesis to obtain the following double mutants: C232A/M235T (using oligonucleotide: 5′-TCCCGTCAGGGAGGCGCCAGTCTTGGA-3′), C18A/C138A and C18A/C308A and the triple mutant: C18A/C138A/C308A (see Fig. 3 A). The eight mutant hAGT cDNAs and the wild-type hAGT cDNA were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells using the DEAE-dextran method (27Thibonnier M. Auzan C. Madhun Z. Wilkins P. Berti-Mattera L. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3304-3310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were transferred to serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium) 2 days after transfection and incubated for 48 h. The resulting supernatants containing recombinant proteins were analyzed on 9% SDS-PAGE with or without 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol and Western blotting (24Gimenez-Roqueplo A-P. Célérier J. Lucarelli G. Corvol P. Jeunemaitre X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Angiotensinogen recombinants were detected with the anti-human angiotensinogen polyclonal antibody:HCL (diluted 1:6000) (28Genain C. Bouhnik J. Tewksbury D. Corvol P. Ménard J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1984; 59: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Pure CHO-K1 cell lines overproducing Thr235 and Ala232/Thr235 mutant proteins were established, as reported elsewhere (23Gimenez-Roqueplo A-P. Leconte I. Cohen P. Simon D. Guyene T.T. Célérier J. Pau B. Corvol P. Clauser E. Jeunemaitre X. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9838-9844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The MBP cDNA contains the entire sequence (117 amino acids) of human MBP and is translated as a preprotein, which it is co-translationally modified to proMBP and post-translationally modified to MBP (29Barker R.L. Gleich G.J. Pease L.R. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1493-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The MBP cDNA was released from pUC 12 by digestion with EcoRI andBglII and inserted into pECE at the same restriction sites, to give the plasmid pE proMBP. This plasmid was used to transiently transfect CHO-K1 cells producing Met235 or Thr235 or Ala232/Thr235angiotensinogen by the calcium phosphate procedure (30Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-340PubMed Google Scholar), co-transfect COS-7 cells with the cysteine mutant hAGT cDNAs using the DEAE-dextran method, and to establish CHO cell line overproducing proMBP protein. The proMBP protein in the culture medium was checked by Western blotting. The membrane was saturated with 5% (w/v) fat-free milk, incubated overnight with primary antibody J163-15E, an anti-proMBP monoclonal antibody (31Popken-Harris P. Thomas L. Oxvig C. Sottrup-Jensen L. Kubo H. Klein J.S. Gleich G.J. J. Allergy Clin. Immun. 1994; 94: 1282-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), diluted 1:2000 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected by their alkaline phosphatase activity after biotin-streptavidin enhancement. The angiotensinogen·proMBP complex was produced in vitroby co-culture of CHO cells overproducing proMBP (selected by Western blotting) and CHO cells overproducing wild-type (genotype Met235, the most common Caucasian variant), or Thr235 angiotensinogen proteins. The Met235 or Thr235 angiotensinogen-producing cells secreted recombinant angiotensinogen with the same production rate: 1.5 μg of recombinant protein/ml corresponding to the 24-h production in serum-free medium for 30 × 106 cells. To produce large amounts of complex, we have tested several co-culture conditions (10–90% of proMBP producing or angiotensinogen-producing CHO cells). The selected condition was 10% angiotensinogen-producing cells plus 90% proMBP-producing cells. All the proMBP proteins were complexed with angiotensinogen molecules under these conditions. Complex was produced in 225 cm2 culture flasks. Cells were plated and grown in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 500 μg/ml Geneticin® (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere for 24 h. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and transferred to serum-free medium (UltraCHO. BioWhittaker) for 96 h. Complex was analyzed by Western blotting with human angiotensinogen polyclonal HCL and proMBP monoclonal J163-15E antibodies, to detect angiotensinogen and proMBP, respectively. Untransfected CHO cells were used as negative controls to angiotensinogen-producing cells or proMBP-producing cells. No complex was produced in the absence of proMBP proteins and the production of monomeric angiotensinogen was equivalent: 607 ng/ml/96 h for Met235 angiotensinogen and 548 ng/ml/96 h for Thr235 angiotensinogen. Conditioned medium from CHO cell containing angiotensinogen·proMBP complex (angiotensinogen concentration: 3 μg/ml) was concentrated 10 times at 4 °C by ultrafiltration (30-kDa cut-off membrane, Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter; Millipore). An aliquot (0.5 ml) was analyzed on a Superose 12 column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, at 20 °C. Fractions (0.4 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The column was calibrated in the same buffer using ferritin (440,000 Da), catalase (232,000 Da), aldolase (158,000 Da), bovine serum albumin (67,000 Da), chymotrypsinogen A (25,000 Da), and ribonuclease A (13,700 Da) from the HMW/LMW gel filtration calibration kits (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweeden). Experiments were performed in duplicate for Met235 angiotensinogen·proMBP and for Thr235angiotensinogen·pro-MBP complexes using medium from two co-culture experiments. Each fraction was analyzed for its angiotensinogen content, measured in triplicate by enzymatic assay using a large excess (12.5 nm) of recombinant human renin and by Western blotting using HCL antibody. The area under the curve of Ang I generation were calculated using FPLC Director Software 1.1 (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden). The human renin concentration required for maximal production of Ang I from the angiotensinogen·proMBP complex was determined with four renin concentrations and the amount of Ang I peptide produced in 1 h at 37 °C at pH 5.7 was measured. Fractions containing angiotensinogen·proMBP complex (fractions 23–25) or monomeric angiotensinogen (fractions 31–33) were pooled. Aliquots (50 μl) were incubated in 100 mm citric acid/ Na2HPO4, 3 mm EDTA buffer, pH 5.7, with 125 pm, 1.25 nm, 12.5 nm, or 125 nm human recombinant renin (32Mathews S. Döbeli H. Pruschy M. Bosser R. D'Arcy A. Oefner C. Zulauf M. Gentz R. Breu V. Matile H. Schlaeger J. Fischli W. Protein Exp. Purif. 1996; 7: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) at 37 °C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by raising the pH to 9.2 with 20 μl of 4m Tris base and chilling. The Ang I generated was measured at each time in triplicate by a specific radioimmunoassay (33Ménard J. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1972; 90: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Samples containing 80 ng of angiotensinogen, measured by enzymatic assay with 12.5 nm human renin of angiotensinogen·pro-MBP complex (fractions 23–25), or monomeric angiotensinogen (fractions 31–33), was incubated in 100 mmcitric acid/Na2HPO4, 3 mm EDTA buffer, pH 5.7, with a nonsaturating concentration (20 pm) of recombinant human renin at 37 °C for 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min. The reaction was stopped by raising the pH to 9.2 with 20 μl of 4 m Tris base and chilling. The quantities of Ang I generated were determined in triplicate by Ang I radioimmunoassay. This experiment was performed in duplicate for Met235angiotensinogen·proMBP and Thr235angiotensinogen·proMBP. Purified recombinant human angiotensinogen after migration on SDS-PAGE was detected by the anti-human angiotensinogen polyclonal antibody as a large fuzzy band around 60 kDa due to itsN-glycosylation (24Gimenez-Roqueplo A-P. Célérier J. Lucarelli G. Corvol P. Jeunemaitre X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B). The purity of the preparation was ≥95% as judged by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig.1 C) and NH2-terminal sequence analysis.2 Pure recombinant angiotensinogen incubated with iodo[14C]acetic acid gave a radiolabeled heterogeneous 60-kDa band which disappeared when the reaction was performed with excess of cold iodoacetic acid (Fig. 1 A), demonstrating the presence of free cysteine residues in human angiotensinogen. As the Asn14 and Asn137, which are close to the cysteine residues, Cys18 and Cys138, are naturallyN-glycosylated (24Gimenez-Roqueplo A-P. Célérier J. Lucarelli G. Corvol P. Jeunemaitre X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the wild-type protein is unsuitable for mass spectrometric analysis of generated peptides. We therefore used a fully deglycosylated recombinant angiotensinogen (N-4, in which the Asn at positions 14, 137, 271, and 295 are mutated to Gln) (24Gimenez-Roqueplo A-P. Célérier J. Lucarelli G. Corvol P. Jeunemaitre X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recombinant deglycosylated angiotensinogen was run on SDS-PAGE without and with reducing agent (10 mm DTT), and digested with trypsin in-gel. The resulting peptides were analyzed and compared by MALDI-MS (Table I). A 3083.1-Da peptide was generated in the absence of reducing agent and a peptide with a lower molecular mass (2492.2 Da) was produced in the presence of reducing agent. Their masses fitted exactly with the expected molecular mass of peptides containing Cys18 and Cys138 as S-S linked (Val3-(Cys18)-Lys23/Glu137-(Cys138)-Arg141) under non-reducing conditions and unlinked (Val3-(Cys18)-Lys23) after reduction. This is evidence for a disulfide bond between Cys18 and Cys138. Purified wild-type angiotensinogen was similarly treated and the two peptides were not detected, because N-glycosylation made them too heavy. Peptides from glycosylated purified angiotensinogen and from the fully deglycosylated mutant covered the human angiotensinogen sequence from Leu62 to Arg404. These results confirmed that the peptides from the deglycosylated protein belonged to the NH2-terminal part of the human angiotensinogen.Table IThe masses of peptides identified by MALDI-MS following in-gel tryptic digestion of the fully N-deglycosylated angiotensinogen run in nonreducing and reducing conditionsPeptideMolecular mass (MH+, monoisotopic)Non-reduced (−DTT)Reduced (+DTT 10 mm)ObservedCalculatedObservedCalculatedDaDaVal3–Lys23/Glu137–Arg1413083.123084.55Val3–Lys232492.192492.28Glu137–Arg141—aIndicates undetected peptides.594.27Val388–Arg404bIndicates the peptides also obtained from purified recombinant human angiotensinogen under the same conditions.1966.991966.981966.941966.98Glu188–Arg204bIndicates the peptides also obtained from purified recombinant human angiotensinogen under the same conditions.1898.111898.091898.061898.09Val147–Arg163bIndicates the peptides also obtained from purified recombinant human angiotensinogen under the same conditions.1723.081723.021723.021723.02Ala70–Arg83bIndicates the peptides also obtained from purified recombinant human angiotensinogen under the same conditions.1497.771497.771497.751497.77Leu62–Arg691124.601124.681124.651124.68Phe221–Lys229bIndicates the peptides also obtained from purified recombinant human angiotensinogen under the same conditions.1067.511067.531067.501067.53a Indicates undetected peptides.b Indicates the peptides also obtained from purified recombinant human angiotensinogen under the same conditions. Open table in a new tab Purified recombinant human angiotensinogen was reduced with a range of DTT concentrations, alkylated, and analyzed by Western blotting with a polyclonal antibody against the NH2-terminal part of Ang I (Fig.2 A) and for its ability to produce Ang I (Fig. 2 B). The Ang I extremity of angiotensinogen was much better recognized after reduction. Increasing the DTT concentration from 10−3 to 10 mmconsiderably increased recognition of angiotensinogen by the NH2-terminal antibody, which suggests that cleavage of Cys18-Cys138 disulfide bond caused a conformational change making the Ang I part of the protein accessible to antibody (Fig. 2 A). However, high concentration of reducing agent did not change significantly the hydrolysis of the human angiotensiogen by human renin (Fig. 2 B). The role of cysteine residues in the production of angiotensinogen was examined using wild-type hAGT cDNA and 8 cysteine mutant cDNAs to transfect COS-7 cells (Fig.3 A). The mutant proteins secreted in the medium were studied by Western blotting under reducing (+β mercaptoethanol) and non-reducing (−β-mercaptoethanol) conditions (Fig. 3 B). Wild-type angiotensinogen produced a fuzzy band between 50 and 70 kDa (16% of the molecular mass is due to the N-glycosylation of the protein; see Ref. 24Gimenez-Roqueplo A-P. Célérier J.

Mutation of Cys18 to Ala (C18A mutant) decreased the molecular weight of the secreted protein by 2–3 kDa, suggesting that the first N-glycosylation site (Asn14-Glu15-Ser16) was not glycosylated. The C138A mutant protein gave an extra minor band of lower molecular weight (−2 kDa) after migration in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol. This band was also produced by the C18A/C138A double mutant. Hence, the 18-138 disulfide bon"
https://openalex.org/W2091382675,"The G protein α subunit (Gα) is composed of two distinct folding domains: a GTP-binding Ras-like domain and an α helical domain (HD). We have recently reported that the helical domain (HDt) of the vertebrate visual transducin α subunit (Gαt) synergizes activation of retinal cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) by activated Gαt (Liu, W., and Northup, J.

Here, we examine the molecular basis for this HD-based signaling regulation, and we provide a new model for the activation of the target effector. The HD proteins derived from visual transducin or taste gustducin α subunits, but no other Gα HD proteins, each attenuate the PDE catalytic core (Pαβ) and synergize Gαt stimulation of the holoPDE (Pαβγ2) with similar apparent affinities. The data from studies of both HDt-mediated attenuation and stimulation indicate that the HDt and the PDE inhibitory subunit (Pγ) interact with PDE at independent sites and that Pαβ contains the binding sites for HD. The saturation of both processes by HDt displays positive cooperativity with Hill coefficients of 1.5 for the attenuation of Pαβ activity and 2.1 for synergism of holoPDE activation. Our data suggest the that Gαt-HDtregulates PDE by allosterically decreasing the affinity of Pαβ for Pγ and thus simultaneously facilitating the interaction of the activated Gαt-Ras-like domain with Pγ. Thus, we propose a new model for the high efficiency of PDE activation as well as deactivation, and, overall, a novel mechanism for controlling fidelity, sensitivity, and efficacy of G protein signaling. The G protein α subunit (Gα) is composed of two distinct folding domains: a GTP-binding Ras-like domain and an α helical domain (HD). We have recently reported that the helical domain (HDt) of the vertebrate visual transducin α subunit (Gαt) synergizes activation of retinal cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) by activated Gαt (Liu, W., and Northup, J. K., (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.95, 12878–12883). Here, we examine the molecular basis for this HD-based signaling regulation, and we provide a new model for the activation of the target effector.

G proteins (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins) play a central role in many cell-signaling processes. Among the α, β, and γ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, the α subunit (Gα) has received the most attention because most of the known structural determinants for receptor-G protein or effector-G protein interactions reside in Gα proteins (1Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 631-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 2Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 3Hamm H.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 66: 669-672Google Scholar). During signaling, the active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound G protein α subunits function as conformational switches that couple the extensive superfamily of cell-surface receptors to diverse intracellular effectors, including cyclic GMP phosphodiesterases, adenylyl cyclases, receptor kinases, phospholipases, and ion channels (3Hamm H.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 66: 669-672Google Scholar). Solutions for the crystal structures of the α subunits of transducin (Gt) and Gi reveal that these proteins essentially fold into two separate domains termed the GTPase or Ras-like domain (RasD)1 and an α helical domain (HD) (4Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 5Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.E. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). To date, all sites for Gα subunit interactions with receptors and effectors have been mapped to the RasD and the N-terminal segment (2Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev.

The HD is unique to the heterotrimeric G proteins, whereas the RasD is present in all members of the GTPase superfamily. Comparison of the amino acid sequences reveals that diversity in the HD is remarkably greater than in the RasD among Gα families (5Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.E. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G.

These observations implicate the HD as a determinant of the selectivity of Gα interaction with G protein-coupled components. The divergent sequences of HD have led to the proposal that it may serve as an effector recognition domain (10Masters S.B. Stroud R.M. Bourne H.R. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Various roles of the HD have been postulated, including increasing the affinity of GTP binding (11Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), acting as a tethered intrinsic GAP (GTPase activating protein) (12Markby D.W. Onrust R. Bourne H.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29339-29342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and even Gα multimerization (17Rodbell M. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1992; 32: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Mixon M.B. Lee E. Coleman A.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1995; 270: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). We used the retinal signal transduction model to investigate the potential function of the HD of transducin α subunit (Gαt), and we found that HD synergistically activated bovine retinal cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) in the presence of activated Gαt.2 Although activation of the PDE has been examined extensively (19Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1986; 9: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), several mechanistic details of the regulation remain unclear. During signaling, Gαt functions as a conformational switch to control a signal flow from the photoexcited rhodopsin to PDE enzyme. The nonactivated PDE consists of a catalytic core (Pαβ) and two inhibitory subunits (Pγ) (20Hurley J.B. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11094-11099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Baehr W. Devlin M.J. Applebury M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11669-11677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Pαβγ2(holoPDE) remains inactive until it is activated by GTP-bound Gαt (GαtGTP). It has been widely accepted that during the activation process, the GαtGTP-Pγ interaction competes against the Pαβ-Pγ interaction. Consequently, this relieves the inhibitory constraint imposed by Pγ on Pαβ and results in a fully activated enzyme (for review, see Refs. 22Hurley J.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1987; 49: 793-812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 23Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10711-10714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this kinetic model is in conflict with the almost 1000-fold higher affinity of Pγ for Pαβ than for GαtGTP (24Wensel T.G. Stryer L. Protein Struct. Funct. Genet. 1986; 1: 90-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Also, the dissociation of Pγ from Pαβ must be rate-limiting in this model, a process that is exceedingly slow for isolated PDE (19Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1986; 9: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Therefore, an additional as-yet-unidentified mechanism(s) must be operative. Evidence for the cooperative regulation of bovine retinal PDE by the activated Gαt has previously been reported (25Whalen M.M. Bitensky M.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 26Bruckert F. Catty P. Deterre P. Pfister C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12625-12634Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Bennett N. Clerc A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7418-7424Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A mechanistic basis for these observations has remained obscure. Using the purified HD proteins from the main G protein families, we have observed an enhancement of the GαtGTPγS-elicited PDE activation that is HD-selective and cooperative.2 In this report, we examine the kinetics of two related regulatory effects of HD proteins on PDE: the synergistic activation of PDE in concert with activated Gαt and attenuation of activity of the PDE catalytic core. In addition, we present the first evidence demonstrating that HD facilitates Pγ dissociation from Pαβ and thereby synergizes the RasD (in the activated Gαt) stimulation of PDE. The HD constructs were designed as described previously.2 The HDg (rat) expression plasmid was constructed first, and its construct intermediate served as a basis for engineering the other HD constructs. The strategy was as follows. First, to introduce new sites for excising HD from the corresponding cDNA sequence (28McLaughlin S.K. Mckinnon P.J. Margolskee R.F. Nature. 1992; 357: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), a unique SnaBI site in the gustducin-containing cloning vector located within the region equivalent to transducin linker I (4Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 12Markby D.W. Onrust R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1895-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) was created by polymerase chain reaction with primers 5′-GGGGTACCGCTGATCAACTGCCCGTCCTCTAA CAG-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCGATGCATTCTTGTTTTACGTAACCATTCTTGTGGATG-3′. Second, to introduce a stop codon into the 3′-end of the HD sequence, the HD region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with primers 5′-CGGGAT CCATGGCAAACACACTAGAAGATGGT-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGATCAACCAGTGGTTTTCA CACGGGAATGTAGAACGTCT-3′ and then subcloned into pSE420 (Invitrogen). Third, the HD constructs were tagged with hemagglutinin of influenza virus at their N termini by inserting the 9-amino acid epitope (YPYDVPDYA) intoNcoI/SnaBI sites of expression plasmid pSE420 using Klenow-mediated 5′ → 3′ polynucleotide synthesis with the oligonucleotides 5′-CATGCCATGGGATACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACG-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTACGTAAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTATC-3′. The resultant plasmid, termed pSEHA, served as the vector for generating the other HD constructs as well. Finally, the HD-coding sequence was excised withSnaBI and ligated to the SnaBI fragment of pSEHA to create hemagglutinin-tagged HDg. For the HDt (mouse) (29Raport C.J. Dere B. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7122-7128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), HDq (mouse) (30Strathmann M.P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9113-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and HDi1 (rat) (31Jones D.T. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14241-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) constructs, the DNA sequences corresponding to the HD between Linker I and II (4Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 12Markby D.W. Onrust R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1895-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers 5′-ATTATCCACCAGGACGGGTACGTACTGGAGGAATGCCTCGAGTTC-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTCAACCAGTGGTTTTGACACGAGAACG-3′ (HDt), primers 5′-CACGGGTCGG GCTACGTAGACGAAGACAAGCGCGGCTTC-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTTACCCTGTAG TGGGGACTCGAAC-3′(HDq), and primers 5′-GAGGCTGGCTACGTAGAGGAA GAGTGTAAGCAG-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTTATCCCGTGGTTTTCACTCTAGTTCTG-3′(HDi1). TheSnaBI/EcoRI fragment was subcloned into pSEHA. For the HDs-L (rat) construct, the HD sequence (32Itoh H. Kozasa T. Nagata S.N. Katada T. Ui M. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3776-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers 5′-TCCCCCGGGTTTAACGGAGAGGGCGGCG-3′ and 5′-GGACTAGTTTATCCAGAGGTCAGGACGCGGCAG-3′, and then theSmaI/SpeI fragment was subcloned into pSEHA. The hexahistidine-tagged His6-Gαi1 construct was derived from pQE9 (Qiagen). All of the HD constructs and the cloning region of His6-Gαi1 were confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the corresponding expressed proteins were confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The proteins HDg, HDi1, HDq, and HDs were expressed in strain M15 (pREP4) (Qiagen), and HDt and His6-Gαi1 were expressed in strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen), and isolated according to the modified procedure (33Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Briefly, the host cells were grown in the enriched media at 30 °C, and IPTG-induction was initiated whenA 600 was about 0.5 as described (33Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). After ∼17 h (A 600 > 1.8), cells were harvested, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 110 of the culture volume with a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.1, 3 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm AEBSF followed by ultrasonication using Sonicator XL2020 with Probe 201 (Misonix Inc.) to disrupt cells. The isolation of all the HD proteins followed the same procedure as described previously.2Typically, the centrifugation-cleared cell extract was first chromatographed on DEAE-Sephadex A-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) eluted with 50–700 mm NaCl gradient in solution A (50 mm MOPS, pH 6.9, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmDTT, and 0.1 mm AEBSF). The distribution of the HD protein was determined by immunoblotting using anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Boehringer Mannheim) for this and all subsequent chromatographic steps. The HD-containing fractions were lyophilized, dissolved in water, and then fractionated with size-exclusion ACA 54 column (IBF Biotechnic) using solution B (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, I mm DTT, 0.1 mmAEBSF) and 100 mm NaCl. This was followed by FPLC MonoQ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech H/R 5/5) chromatography eluted with a linear gradient from 100–500 mm NaCl in solution B. Finally, HD protein was subjected to fast protein liquid size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75 HR 10/30 from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) eluted with solution C (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 70 mm NaCl). The HD-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated in an Amicon pressure cell on YM10 membranes, and stored at −80 °C. The chemical identities of the purified HD proteins were confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and fast atom bombardment/mass spectroscopy. The proper folding structures were verified by circular dichroism spectrometry. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. His6-Gαi1GDP was purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography according to manufacturer's procedure. The His6-Gαi1 was eluted with a 5-bed volume gradient of 10–400 mm imidazole gradient in solution D (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 50 μm GDP, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm AEBSF, and 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). The eluted His6-Gαi1was concentrated and subjected to fast protein liquid size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75 [HR 10/30], Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in solution D. The concentration of Gαi1 was determined by [35S]GTPγS binding. Bovine retinal PDE was isolated from the rod outer segment (21Baehr W. Devlin M.J. Applebury M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11669-11677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and further purified as described previously.2 The tPDE and the inhibitory Pγ subunits were prepared as described previously.2 The enzymatic activity of freshly prepared tPDE was confirmed to display no further GαtGTPγS stimulation for each independent experiment. Phosphodiesterase activity was quantified as inorganic phosphate released by 5′-nucleotidase digestion of GMP measured by molybdate-dependent absorbance at 790 nm. The assay followed the modified procedure (34Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 773-781PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, the enzyme reactions were performed at 30 °C for 15 min in a final volume of 40 μl containing 2 mm cGMP, 0.2–1 nm PDE (as indicated for each experiment), and 2 μl of 0.1 unit/μl of 5′-nucleotidase, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reaction was terminated by addition of 57 μl of 28% perchloric acid followed by adding 700 μl of 0.25% ammonium molybdate and 80 μl of 10% ascorbic acid and was heated for 5 min at 100 °C to develop a color that was read at 790 nm. Under this condition, 5′-GMP formation was found to be linear with time and with PDE concentration under all conditions reported in this study and up to 87 nmol of cGMP hydrolyzed. Circular dichroic spectra were obtained on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. The spectra were measured from 190 to 240 nm with a time constant of 0.25 s and a scan speed of 10–50 nm/min. Signals were averaged 12 times. The sample concentrations were between 0.3 and 3.0 μm prepared in a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mm NaCl. Solution-only baselines were subtracted from all spectra, and spectra were not smoothed. The GαtGDP was purified as described (35Fawzi A.B. Northup J.K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3804-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The GαtGTPγS was prepared from the purified GαtGDP, and GTPγS binding assay was according to the modified method (36Fawzi A. Fay D.S. Murphy E.A. Tamir H. Erdos J.J. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12194-12200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting for hemagglutinin-tagged HD was performed using monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Boehringer Mannheim) and ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Curve fitting of the experimental data was performed with nonlinear least squares criteria using GraphPad Prism software. To assess low degree cooperativity, the data were transformed using Eadie-Hofstee equation: v = (V max −v·K d)/[activator] (37Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady State Enzyme Systems. Wiley Interscience, New York1975: 367-371Google Scholar); here, velocity (v) is independent of the substrate of PDE, andK d is the apparent dissociation equilibrium constant. Design of HD expression constructs was based on the crystallographic data (4Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 11Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) for the Gαt/Gαi1 chimera complexed with GTPγS·Mg 2+ and that with GDP as described previously.2 All the engineered helical domains from Gαs, Gαq, Gαi1, Gαt, and Gαg properly folded as stable and soluble proteins. Fig. 1 Apresents an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the homogeneity of the purified HD proteins from the members of Gαi family: HDt, HDg, and HDi1. Their characteristic α-helical conformations were confirmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy as depicted in Fig.1 B. All measured HD proteins displayed negative ellipiticity at 222 nm (characteristic of α-helix) as well as 208 nm and a positive ellipiticity at 190, indicating a strong preference of the proteins to fold into predominantly helical conformation in solution. We have qualitatively characterized a selective interaction of HDt and HDg with the retinal cyclic GMP PDE.2 The quantitative analysis of the HDt attenuation of activity of the PDE catalytic core (Pαβ) is presented in Fig. 2. The catalytic heterodimer Pαβ is produced by proteolysis of inhibitory Pγ subunits by limited trypsinization, which results in maximally activated enzyme (tPDE) (38Deterre P. Bigay J. Forquet F. Robert M. Chabre M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). HDt and HDgattenuate Pαβ activity to the same extent: maximally, about 60% of control. The two related structures differ somewhat in apparentK i values of 0.37 μm (± 0.02 μm, S.D.) and 0.52 μm (± 0.01 μm, S.D.) for HDt and HDg, respectively (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with our prior report,2 the HDi1 (Gαi1 helical domain) that is closely related to HDt exhibits no reactivity toward Pαβ even at the elevated concentration of 10 μm (Fig. 2 A). Nor does the chemically modified HDt, NHS-HDt attenuate Pαβ activity, indicating that the attenuation effect is selective and conformation-dependent. To test for the function of the HD moiety in the intact Gα, we quantitatively examined the attenuation of Pαβ activity by GαtGDP. In agreement with previous observations (39Kroll S. Phillips W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4490-4497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),2 like the HDt, GαtGDP attenuates the Pαβ activity by ∼60% (Fig.2 B). The saturation analysis of GαtGDP-Pαβ interaction yields an apparent dissociation constant of 0.43 μm (± 0.03 μm, S.D.) comparable to that of 0.37 μm (± 0.02 μm, S.D.) for the HDt-Pαβ reaction. This kinetic similarity between HDt and GαtGDP suggests that the GαtGDP reactivity toward the PDE core enzyme is due to the HD moiety. In contrast, like the HDi1 protein, the Gαi1GDP shows no interaction with the enzyme, even at the elevated concentration of 10 μm (Fig. 2 B). Together, these data strongly suggest that selectivity for the Gα-Pαβ interaction has been encoded at an interface between the HD and the enzyme catalytic core. We suggest that this highly selective and conformation-dependent HD-Pαβ interface is the molecular basis for the HD-modulated allosteric activation of PDE described below. The maximal attenuations of activity of heterodimer enzyme Pαβ by HDt or GαtGDP were 59% (± 3%; n = 21) and 62% (± 4%; n = 3), respectively, suggesting a possible allosteric mechanism for this attenuation effect. To examine the HD interacting sites, we subjected the data of Fig. 2 B to two transformations to analyze cooperative regulation of enzymatic activity. First, the data from Fig.2 A were subjected to graphical analysis utilizing the Eadie-Hofstee equation for evaluation of low degree cooperativity. This transformation of the saturation data resulted in a nonlinear convex plot indicative of a positive cooperativity (Fig. 2 C). The relationship between the Hill coefficient (n) andY m, the position of the maximum in the Eadie-Scatchard plot, is n = 1/(1 −Y m) (40Dahlquist F.W. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 48: 270-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The Y m value of Fig.2 C is ∼1.5. The same data were subjected to the Hill transformation in order to confirm the cooperativity (Fig. 2 C, inset.). This analysis also yields a Hill coefficient ofn ≈ 1.5. The Hill coefficient (n) represents a lower limit on the number of HD binding sites per Pαβ heterodimer. Thus, we suggest that PDE catalytic core is an enzyme allosterically modulated by the HDt moiety and that there are at least two sites on Pαβ with unequal affinities for HDt binding. However, our data cannot distinguish whether a preferential occupancy of Pα or Pβ by the HDt is involved in this allostery. Unlike GαtGDP, GαtGTPγS appears not to attenuate Pαβ activity even at concentrations up to 4 μm (Fig. 2 B), demonstrating a conformationally selective Gαt interaction with Pαβ. The HD moiety of Gαt does not undergo a dramatic structural rearrangement from the GDP-state to the GTPγS states 3Upon comparison of the crystallographic data of GDP-bound Gαt with those of GTPγS-bound Gαt (4Lambright D.G.

Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), we have found a switch (switch IV) in the αD-αE loop of HDt that undergoes obvious structural rearrangement. compared with the RasD (18Mixon M.B. Lee E. Coleman A.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1995; 270: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This would suggest that the HD of GαtGTPγS might present similar but nonmodulating contacts with Pαβ. To test this proposition, a competition experiment was performed as presented in Fig. 3. The addition of GαtGTPγS, which alone shows little influence on Pαβ activity, diminishes the attenuation by GαtGDP (Fig. 3). An identical competition was found between HDt and GαtGTPγS (Fig. 3). These attenuations do not display competitive kinetics. Although the apparent K i for GαtGDP is increased in the presence of GαtGTPγS, the maximal inhibition is also decreased. These data indicate that although both the inactive (GDP-state) and the active (GTPγS-state) conformations of Gαt bind to Pαβ, they interact with either distinct sites or states of the enzyme. It should be noted that the consequence of this competition cannot be attributed to an overlay of the intrinsic ability of GαtGTPγS to stimulate PDE, because no stimulation of tPDE enzyme activity was observed. Because the potent inhibition of Pαβ by Pγ accounts for the major control of enzyme activity, we conducted experiments designed to examine the interactions of Pαβ with HD and Pγ. At near-saturating concentrations, neither HDt nor HDg affected the maximal intrinsic inhibition of Pαβ by Pγ (Fig.4). However, both HD proteins decreased the apparent affinity of Pγ for Pαβ by about 2-fold. The apparentK d values are 16 pm (± 2;n = 4) for Pγ inhibition of the core enzyme and 37 (± 3; n = 4) and 52 pm (± 2;n = 3) for the same reactions but in the presence of the HDt and the HDg, respectively. It has recently been reported that Pγ inhibits Pαβ by occluding access of cGMP to the PDE catalytic site (41Granovsky A.F. Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11686-11689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). If the helical domains were to occupy the same or overlapping sites for Pγ-Pαβ contact, at saturation, HD would competitively abrogate the Pγ inhibition of the core enzyme. Our data show no diminution of inhibition, excluding the possibility that the HDt exerts its effect on Pαβ by interfering with the cGMP binding. These data argue that there at least are the two classes of interacting sites within Pαβ: a site(s) for HDt and a site(s) for Pγ subunits. We thus suggest that the HD is an allosteric modulator of Pγ binding rather than a competitor. The HD is an effector-interacting domain within the Gα subunit. Fig. 5 A shows that the subsaturating concentrations of 1 μm of the HDt and HDg each markedly enhanced the activator GαtGTPγS-elicited PDE activation by decreasing the apparent K d values over 150-fold (from 460 to 3 nm) and 100-fold (from 460 to 4.5 nm), respectively. To gain insight into the mechanism of this synergy, we examined the HDt influence on the saturation of PDE activation by GαtGTPγS. Most notable is the sigmoidal steepness of the Pαβ with HDtconcentration-response curve measured at a subsaturating level of the activator GαtGTPγS (Fig. 5 B). These data yield a Hill coefficient of 2.1, establishing two HD binding sites per regulated PDE complex. The selectivity of HD synergy is also presented in Fig. 5 B; neither HDq, HDs, nor HDi1 at up to 10 μm is able to enhance PDE activation. These data reiterate the selectivity found for the HD attenuation of Pαβ activity by HD proteins (Fig. 2 A) and by the HD moiety of intact Gαt (Fig. 2 B). Like the HDt attenuation of Pαβ, the HDtsynergy o"

The abundance of HIV-1 mRNAs is determined by the efficiencies with which its different 5′ and 3′ splice sites are used. Three splice sites (A4c, A4a, and A4b) are upstream of the rev initiator AUG. RNAs spliced at A4c, A4a, and A4b are used as mRNAs for Rev. Another 3′ splice site (A5) is immediately downstream of the revinitiator. RNAs spliced at A5 are used as mRNAs for Env and Nef. In this report, primer extension analysis of splicing intermediates was used to show that there are eight branch points in this region, all of which map to adenosine residues. In addition, cis elements recognized by the cellular splicing machinery overlap; the two most 3′ branch points overlap with the AG dinucleotides at rev 3′ splice sites A4a and A4b. Competition of the overlapping cis sites for different splicing factors may play a role in maintaining the appropriate balance of mRNAs in HIV-1-infected cells. In support of this possibility, mutations at rev 3′ splice site A4b AG dinucleotide dramatically increased splicing of the env/nef3′ splice site A5. This correlated with increased usage of the four most 3′ branch points, which include those within the rev3′ splice site AG dinucleotides. Consistent with these results, analysis of a mutant in which three of the four env/nefbranch points were inactivated indicated that use of splice site A5 was inhibited and splicing was shifted predominantly to the most 5′rev 3′ splice site A4c with preferential use of the two most 5′ branch points.

Splicing of mRNA precursors in the nucleus of metazoan cells occurs by the cleavage and joining of 5′ and 3′ splice sites. This is mediated by recognition of conserved cis-acting sequences near the two splice sites that removes the intron between these splice sites. The splicing process is catalyzed by the cellular splicing machinery within spliceosome complexes (for reviews, see Refs. 1Moore M.J. Query C.C. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.R. The RNA World.

Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). The assembly of spliceosomes involves an initial interaction with U1 snRNP1 at the 5′ splice site. The 3′ splice site is then recognized by factor U2AF binding to a greater than 12-nt polypyrimidine tract upstream of the AG dinucleotide, which borders the site of 3′ cleavage. Another cis element, the branch point sequence, is located 18–40 nt upstream of the AG dinucleotide with the loosely conserved consensus sequence YNYURAY (the underlined residue is the branch point). The branch point sequence is recognized by U2 snRNP, whose binding is facilitated by the protein U2AF. This step is followed by binding of U5 and U4/U6 snRNPs as a triple snRNP to form the complete spliceosome. The splicing process for most cellular mRNA precursors is normally efficient. However, processing of some pre-mRNAs occurs by tissue-specific or developmentally regulated alternative splicing pathways, resulting in multiple mRNAs produced for a single pre-mRNA. This involves the use of alternative 5′ or 3′ splice sites, exon skipping, intron inclusion, and mutually exclusive exons. Such regulated splicing results in the production of different proteins from the same gene and is an important mechanism for expanding the repertoire of cellular gene expression (1Moore M.J. Query C.C. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.R. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 303-357Google Scholar). HIV-1 uses the cellular splicing machinery to express its genes. Over 30 different HIV-1 mRNAs are derived by alternative splicing from a single RNA precursor. In addition, approximately half of the RNA transcripts remain unspliced. These primary transcripts are packaged into progeny virions and are used as mRNA for the gagand pol gene products. It has been shown that HIV-1 RNA splicing efficiency is primarily determined by the relative strengths of the various 3′ splice sites in the viral RNA (4O'Reilly M.M. McNally M.T. Beemon K.L. Virology. 1995; 213: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Staffa A. Cochrane A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3071-3079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Si Z.-H. Amendt B.A. Stoltzfus C.M.

These include suboptimal splice sites (polypyrimidine tracts and branch point sequences) as well as enhancer and silencer elements mapping within the exons downstream of the splice sites (4O'Reilly M.M.

Several alternative 3′ splice sites are present in a 300-nt region in the middle of the HIV genome (splice sites A3, A4a, A4b, A4c, and A5; Fig. 1). In addition, a 5′ splice site (D4) downstream of these alternative 3′ splice sites is spliced to 3′ splice site A7 within the env coding sequence (Fig. 1). When both splicing events occur, multiply spliced mRNAs are created.tat mRNAs are spliced at site A3, whereas revmRNAs are spliced at either A4a, A4b, or A4c. Most envand nef mRNAs are spliced at site A5; however,env mRNA remains single-spliced (13Purcell D.F.J. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6365-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Splicing between sites D4 and A7 creates a noncoding exon upstream of the nefreading frame. In addition to alternative splicing, the levels of single-spliced and unspliced RNA are also selectively regulated by the HIV-1 Rev protein (for a review see Ref. 14Cullen B.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 219-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This small basic protein binds to an RNA element in the env gene called the Rev-responsive element within the env gene and facilitates transport of the unspliced and single-spliced RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. We have previously shown that the efficiency of splicing at splice site A3, which is primarily used for synthesis of tat mRNA, is determined by both a suboptimal polypyrimidine tract and by an exon-splicing silencer element (ESS) (6Si Z.-H. Amendt B.A. Stoltzfus C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the ESS, which maps approximately 60 nt downstream of the tat splice site, does not significantly inhibit splicing at the rev andenv splice sites A4a, A4b, A4c, and A5, which are downstream of the ESS (10Amendt B.A. Si Z.-H. Stoltzfus C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Splicing at these latter closely spaced 3′ splice sites, which are utilized for approximately 90% of the spliced mRNAs in HIV-1-infected cells (13Purcell D.F.J. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6365-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), may involve the assembly of a single spliceosome complex upstream of the A4c splice site followed by scanning to the four different AGs. The relative usage of the different splice sites would then be determined by competition between the AGs based on their position and sequence context (15Smith C.W.J. Porro E.B. Patton J.G. Nadal-Ginard B. Nature. 1989; 342: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 16Smith C.W.J. Chu T.T. Nadal-Ginard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4939-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This predicts that only one branch point sequence or one set of branch point sequences would be recognized by the U2 snRNP. Alternatively, separate spliceosomes may form upstream of each AG. This model predicts that different branch points or sets of branch points corresponding to different binding sites for U2 snRNP would be used for splicing at each of these AGs. To distinguish these models, we identified branch points in the 80-nt region containing the four 3′ splice sites by primer extension analysis. Our results indicate that separate spliceosomes form and that there is overlap of the cis splicing sequences recognized by the cellular splicing machinery. Plasmid pHS1-X (9Amendt B.A. Hesslein D. Chang L.-J. Stoltzfus C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3960-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which contains HIV-1 sequences derived from the infectious clone pNL4–3 (GenBankTMaccession no. M19921), was used to construct plasmids as templates to synthesize RNA substrates for splicing (Fig. 1). In order to facilitate cloning, plasmid pHS1-ΔSac was constructed in which a SacI site in the vector sequence of pHS1-X was removed by blunt end ligation to create a unique SacI site at nt 5999 of the pNL4–3 sequence. Mutant plasmids 4B-S, 4B-/5-, and 5-, which inactivate splice acceptors A4b and/or A5, were created by replacing the region between the Bsu36I (nt 5954 in HIV-1) and SacI (nt 5999 in HIV-1) restriction enzyme sites with hybridized oligonucleotides. The following oligonucleotides were used (changes from wild type are underlined): mutant 4B-S (sense, 5′-TTACGCATCTCCTATGGCAGGAAGAAGCGGAGACAGCGACGAAGAGCT-3′; antisense, 5′-CTTCGTCGCTGTCTCCGCTTCTTCCTGCCATAGGAGATGCG-3′); mutant 4B-/5- (sense, 5′-TTACGCATCTCCTATGGCCGTAAGAAGCGGAGACAGCGACGAAGAGCT-3′; antisense, 5′-CTTCGTCGCTGTCTCCGCTTCTTACGGCCATAGGAGATGCG-3′); mutant 5- (sense, 5′-TTAGGCATCTCCTATGGCCGTAAGAAGCGGAGACAGCGACGAAGAGCT-3′; antisense, 5′-CTTCGTCGCTGTCTCCGCTTCTTACGGCCATAGGAGATGCC-3′). pNL4–3 plasmids with mutations in splice acceptor A4b (pNLΔSA4b (13Purcell D.F.J. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6365-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and p4BSAM (17Riggs N.L. Little S.J. Richman D.D. Guatelli J.C. Virology. 1994; 202: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)) were generously provided by D. Purcell (Macfarlane Burnet Center for Medical Research; Fairfield, Victoria, Australia) and J. Guatelli (University of California, San Diego), respectively. Plasmids 4B-G and 4B-P containing mutations AG↓G → GG↓G and AG↓G → GA↓G, respectively, were constructed by ligating theEcoRI to SacI fragment of p4BSAM and theEcoRI to HindIII fragment of pNL4ΔSA4b to the appropriate vector fragments derived from PHS1-ΔSac. Plasmid EB124, which inactivates branch points 5, 6, and 8, was created with sense primer ESSEQ (5′-TAGTATGGGCAAGCAGGGAG-3′) and antisense primer NOBRNCH (5′-TCTGATGAGCTCTTCGTCGCTGTCTCCGCTTCTTCCTGCCATAGGAGATGCCCAAGGCTTTTGACACGA-3′) and used to amplify the 4B-G DNA template by polymerase chain reaction. The resulting 300-nt polymerase chain reaction product was cleaved withAccI and SacI and ligated together with the 3.24-kb AccI/SacI restriction digest fragment of pHS1-ΔSac. A similar strategy was used to construct mutant plasmid 4B-W (containing mutation AG↓G to CG↓G in 3′ splice site A4b) with sense primer ESSEQ and antisense primer FWS (5′-TCTGATGAGCTCTTCGTCGCTGTCTCCGCTTCTTCCTGCCATAGGAGATGCCGAAGG-3′) to amplify the polymerase chain reaction product. The expected changes in the plasmids used as templates for splicing were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid pSP64-HβΔ6 containing human β-globin downstream of an SP6 RNA polymerase promoter has been previously described (18Krainer A.R. Maniatis T. Ruskin B. Green M.R. Cell. 1984; 36: 993-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). In vitro run-off RNA transcripts labeled with [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were carried out essentially as described (9Amendt B.A. Hesslein D. Chang L.-J. Stoltzfus C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3960-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To prepare templates, pHS1-ΔSac and its derivatives were linearized withXhoI, and pSP64-HβΔ6 was linearized withBamHI. In vitro transcription reactions (20 μl) were carried out in a reaction mixture containing 40 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mmspermidine, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 40 units of RNAguard RNase inhibitor (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 500 μm rATP, 500 μm rCTP, 250 μmrUTP, 50 μm rGTP, 500 μm diguanosine triphosphate, 80 μCi of [α-32P]UTP, 40 units of T3 or SP6 RNA polymerase, and approximately 1 μg of DNA template. Splicing reactions were carried out essentially as described previously (9Amendt B.A. Hesslein D. Chang L.-J. Stoltzfus C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3960-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In brief, a 25-μl reaction mixture consisting of 60% (v/v) nuclear extract in Dignam's buffer D (19Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar), 20 mm creatine phosphate, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.8 mm ATP, and 2.6% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol was incubated with approximately 8 fmol of radiolabeled RNA substrate for 2 h at 30 °C. In order to increase the yield of branched lariat intermediate product for subsequent primer extension analysis, the splicing reaction was stopped at 1 h, and approximately 100 fmol of RNA substrate was used. Except where noted, RNA splicing products were electrophoresed on 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels for 19 h at 300 V. Primer extension analysis was carried out essentially as described previously (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Branched lariat intermediate and unspliced RNA bands were excised from the in vitrosplicing gels and eluted in a solution containing 0.2% (w/v) SDS and 0.3 m NaOAc (pH 5.2) at 4 °C. For pHS1-ΔSac and derivatives, primer PED133 (5′-TCGAGTACTACTTACTGCTTTGATAGAGA-3′) at a concentration of 1 μm was 5′-end-labeled in a 10-μl reaction containing 70 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase, and 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. End-labeled PED133 was purified by CentriflexTM-AG cartridges (EdgeBiosystems, Gaithersburg, MD). 32P-Labeled PED133 was hybridized to RNA overnight at 30 °C in a solution containing 40 mm PIPES (pH 6.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.4 m NaCl, 80% (v/v) formamide. Primer extension to the branch point sites was carried out in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 40 units RNAguard RNase inhibitor, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm spermidine, a 0.8 mm concentration of each dNTP, and 50 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI). 32P-Labeled PED133 was also used for fmol ® DNA cycle sequencing (Promega). The extended products were loaded on a 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide, 7m urea gel for 3.5 h at 2000 V. Dideoxynucleotide sequencing of DNA corresponding to the splice site region using the PED133 primer was carried out on the gel in order to map the locations of the branch points. Primer extension analysis of β-globin pSP64-HβΔ6 was carried out using the exact conditions described above, except that primer ABLOB (5′-AGGAGTGGACAGATCCCCAAAGGACTCAA-3′) was used instead of primer PED133. We first performed primer extension analysis to identify branch points in the 80-nt region containing the fourrev and env 3′ splice sites (A4a, A4b, A4c, and A5). The products of a splicing reaction of an RNA substrate transcribed from minigene template pHS1-ΔSac (see Fig.1 B) were separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (Fig.2 A). Branched lariat-exon intermediates were isolated and a primer, complementary to the exon (PED 133) was used to extend a DNA product to the branch points using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. As a control for the specificity of the stops, we isolated linear RNA precursor, annealed it to the same primer, and used it as substrate for reverse transcriptase. As a positive control, we carried out a similar primer extension analysis to determine the branch point site used in the splicing of exons 1 and 2 of minigene substrate SPβΔ6 derived from the human β-globin gene (Figs. 1 D and 2 B). As expected, based on previous results (21Ruskin B. Krainer A.R. Maniatis T. Green M.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 317-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), the branch point mapped to an adenosine within the sequence (CACUGAC), 37 nucleotides upstream from the 3′ splice site. In the case of the HIV-1 substrate, specific stops corresponding to eight branch points were detected, and all of these branch points were mapped to adenosine residues (Figs. 1 Cand 2 C). Examination of the sequences containing these branch points indicated that there was a correspondence to the mammalian consensus branch point sequence YNYURAC ranging from three out of seven to six out of seven nucleotides (TableI). Interestingly, the most 3′ branch point (branch point 8) mapped to the adenosine residue within the AG dinucleotide of the rev A4b 3′ splice site. In addition, a minor amount of branching occurred at the rev A4a 3′ splice site (branch point 7).Table IBranch point sequences in the region of HIV-1 rev and env/nef 3′ splice sitesBranch pointSequenceaNucleotide numbers (nt) in NL4–3 sequence are shown on the left and right.Consensus matchbY, pyrimidine; N, any nucleotide; R, purine; numbers of matches are shown in parentheses.Consensusnt-YNYURAC-ntYNYURAC (7/7)15901-UUGCUAU-5907YN—A- (3/7)25907-UUGUAAA-5913YN-URA- (5/7)35922-CUUUCAU-5928YNYU-A- (5/7)45928-UUGCCAA-5934YN—A- (3/7)55939-GUUUCAU-5945-NYU-A- (4/7)65942-UCAUGAC-5948YN-URAC (6/7)75947-ACAAAAG-5953-N–RA- (3/7)85953-GCCUUAG-5959-NYU-A- (4/7)a Nucleotide numbers (nt) in NL4–3 sequence are shown on the left and right.b Y, pyrimidine; N, any nucleotide; R, purine; numbers of matches are shown in parentheses. Open table in a new tab The fact that branch points 7 and 8 overlapped with the rev AG dinucleotides strongly suggested that these branch points were used in splicing at theenv/nef 3′ splice site A5. To further test this possiblity, we correlated the use of the different branch points with the use of specific splice sites. It has been previously reported that certain mutations of the rev A4b AG dinucleotide cause a significant inhibition of virus replication and reduced usage of tat and the remaining rev 3′ splice sites (17Riggs N.L. Little S.J. Richman D.D. Guatelli J.C. Virology. 1994; 202: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We tested four different mutant substrates: AG↓G → GG↓G (mutant 4B-G), AG↓G → AC↓G (mutant 4B-S), AG↓G → GA↓G (mutant 4B-P), and AG↓G → CG↓C (mutant 4B-W). Fig. 3 shows that, as expected, splicing at 3′ splice site A4b was blocked with all mutant substrates. Splicing at 3′ splice site A5 of substrates with AG to GG, AC, and CG mutations was dramatically increased compared with wild type. On the other hand, splicing of the AG to GA mutant substrate was elevated only slightly compared with wild type. In each case, there was a reduction in splicing at the rev A4a 3′ splice site; this was most pronounced for the 4B-S substrate. Concomitant with the increase in splicing at A5 there was a shift in the distribution of lariats and lariat-exon intermediates to the slowest migrating bands (Fig. 3). This shift occurred to a lesser extent with the AG to GA mutant. Since RNA intermediates containing larger lariats would be expected to migrate more slowly on such gels, this result suggested that the branch points used for splicing at the env/nef 3′ splice site A5 are farther downstream than those that are used for splicing at the rev 3′ splice sites A4a, A4b, and A4c. To determine the locations of the branch points used in splicing of therev A4b mutants, we carried out primer extension analysis of the mutant lariat-exon intermediates. It can be seen in Fig.4 that enhanced splicing at the A5 3′ splice site was correlated with a relative increase in lariat-exon intermediate products of the four most 3′ branch point sites (branch points 5–8) in substrate 4B-S and three of the four distal branch point sites (branch points 5–7) in substrates 4B-G and 4B-W. The 4B-G and 4B-W substrates, in which the AG dinucleotide was mutated to GG and CG, respectively, did not branch at the mutated A4b 3′ splice site (branch point 8). Branching did occur at this site with mutant substrate 4B-S, in which the AG dinucleotide was mutated to AC. Thus, the presence of the AG adenosine is necessary for branch point formation at the A4b 3′ splice site. The increase in the use of branch points 5–8 relative to the use of branch points 1–4 correlated with increased use of 3′ splice site A5, suggesting that these branch points are used for splicing at this site. On the other hand, with the 4B-P mutant in which the AG dinucleotide was mutated to GA, the shift to splicing at A5 was less pronounced (see Fig. 3), and there was a more uniform usage of all eight branch points. The strong correlation that existed between the enhanced splicing to the A5 splice site of the A4b mutants and the increased use of downstream branch points in the lariat-exon intermediates suggested that the four most 3′ branch points were used for splicing to A5. To further confirm the role of the branch points identified above in A5 splicing, we used substrate EB124 in which the candidate branch points for A5 were mutated from adenosine to other nucleotides. EB124 combines the mutation present in substrate 4B-G (with the A4b and branch point 8 mutation AG↓G → GG↓G) with mutations of the remaining two major A5 branch points (branch points 5 and 6). The minor branch point 7 within the A4a AG dinucleotide was not changed. If these three branch points were necessary for splicing to the A5 3′ splice site, we expected that the splicing pattern of substrate EB124 should resemble that of a substrate in which bothrev A4b and env/nef A5 3′ splice sites were inactivated (mutant 4B-/5-). As shown in Fig.5 A, the splicing pattern of 4B-/5- was indeed similar to that of EB124 substrate. Interestingly, mutant substrates EB124 and 4B-/5- both showed an increased amount of product spliced at rev splice site A4c compared with wild type. As shown in Fig. 5 B for EB124, this correlated with a relative increase in the usage of branch points 1 and 2. This result suggested that these branch points may be used preferentially for splicing at A4c. There was also a residual amount of splicing at 3′ splice site A5 (Fig. 5 A), and this was correlated with a small amount of branching at the rev A4a 3′ splice site (branch point 7), which remains intact in EB124 (Fig. 5 B). The shift to increased splicing at A4c required mutations of both the A4b AG dinucleotide and either the A5 AG dinucleotide or the A5 branch points. Mutation of the A5 AG dinucleotide alone (mutant 5-) did not show the preferential use of the A4c 3′ splice site. The AG to GG mutation at A4b caused the expected increase in splicing at A5 (Fig.5 A). In this study, we showed that different sets of branch points are used for splicing at the different HIV-1 rev andenv/nef 3′ splice sites. This implies that separate spliceosome complexes used for splicing at the rev and theenv/nef mRNAs form upstream of the different AG dinucleotides. It further implies that there are a number of different binding sites for U2 snRNPs. From the locations of the branch points, we can deduce the locations of the polypyrimidine tracts used for assembling spliceosomes at the different 3′ splice sites (Fig.6). The polypyrimidine tract is positioned downstream of the branch points used for splicing at a given site. Thus, the polypyrimidine tract used for the env/nef 3′ splice site A5 at nt 5975 is almost certainly the sequence spanning nt 5963–5970 (5′-UCUCCUAU-3′). Consistent with this, branch points 5–8, which are used for splicing at site A5, are all upstream of this sequence. A second polypyrimidine tract located between nt 5922 and 5929 (5′-UUGCUUUC-3′) is upstream of branch points 3 and 4 but downstream of branch points 1 and 2. Thus, branch points 1 and 2 may be used for splicing at rev 3′ splice site A4c. This is in agreement with the data shown in Fig. 5, since an increase in product spliced at site A4c correlated with the increased use of branch points 1 and 2. It is likely that the rev 3′ splice sites A4a and A4b use a common set of branch points, since mutation of the A4a AG in the context of HIV-1 infection has been shown to result in a compensatory increase in splicing at the A4b splice site but with little or no change in splicing at A5 (17Riggs N.L. Little S.J. Richman D.D. Guatelli J.C. Virology. 1994; 202: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It follows that a likely polypyrimidine tract for rev 3′ splice sites A4a and A4b is the sequence from nt 5936 to 5944 (5′-UUUGUUUC-3′), which is downstream of branch points 1–4 but upstream of branch points 5–8. Interestingly, all of these potential polypyrimidine tracts are shorter than the eukaryotic consensus (greater than 12 pyrimidines) and have interspersed purine residues. Thus, as has been shown with other HIV 3′ splice sites, the polypyrimidine tracts of the rev andenv/nef splice sites also appear to be suboptimal (4O'Reilly M.M. McNally M.T. Beemon K.L. Virology. 1995; 213: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Staffa A. Cochrane A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3071-3079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Si Z.-H. Amendt B.A. Stoltzfus C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We also showed in this study that, although most of the branch point sequences differ significantly from the metazoan consensus sequence, all of the branch points in the region of the HIV-1 rev andenv/nef 3′ splice sites map to adenosine residues. Previous studies of several other HIV-1 branch points showed that nucleotides other than adenosine residues are used. Dyhr-Mikkelsen and Kjems found that the major branch point for the tat/rev 3′ splice site A7 maps to a uridine residue within the sequence 5′-UACUUUC-3′ (11Dyhr-Mikkelsen H. Kjems J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24060-24066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Damier et al. mapped the branch point for 3′ splice site A2 to a guanosine residue within the sequence 5′-UAGCAGA-3′ (12Damier L. Domenjoud L. Brantlant C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Our results show that the use of nonadenosine branch points is not universal for all HIV-1 3′ splice sites. Interestingly, the adenosine residues within the AG dinucleotides of the rev 3′ splice sites A4a and A4b also both serve as branch points for splicing at env/nef 3′ splice site A5. To our knowledge, there is no precedent for overlap of these two essential cis elements within two adjacent alternative 3′ splice sites. We also showed that each of the HIV-1 splice sites appears to use multiple branch points. This has previously been shown for a number of other alternatively spliced viral and cellular mRNAs (22Noble J.C. Prives C. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1460-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Gattoni R. Schmitt P. Stevenin J.

Noble J. Colgan J. Manley J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3338-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We showed above that substrates with different mutations of therev A4b AG dinucleotide behave differently. Mutations in which the AG was changed to GG, AC, or CG resulted in dramatic increases in splicing at the env/nef 3′ splice site A5, whereas a mutation in which the AG was changed to GA does not show this increase. Interestingly, these differences in splicing can be correlated with previous results in which the effects of these mutations were studied in the context of HIV-1 infection. Two of these mutants (AG to GG and AG to CG) are Rev-deficient and replication-defective (17Riggs N.L. Little S.J. Richman D.D. Guatelli J.C. Virology. 1994; 202: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 26Sadaie M.R. Rappaport J. Benter T. Josephs S.F. Willis R. Wong-Staal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9224-9228Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the case of the AG to GG mutant, this was shown to involve a relative decrease in levels of mRNAs spliced at the remaining rev 3′ splice sites as well as thetat 3′ splice site A3 (17Riggs N.L. Little S.J. Richman D.D. Guatelli J.C. Virology. 1994; 202: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In contrast, the AG to GA mutant has wild type Rev function and is replication-competent (13Purcell D.F.J. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6365-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the Rev-deficient HIV-1 phenotypes may be caused by an unbalanced splicing of the viral RNA, resulting in an increase in splicing at the env/nef 3′ splice site A5 and a consequent failure to splice efficiently at the remaining rev 3′ splice sites. In the in vitro system, the 3′ splice site A4b mutations do not exhibit the same inhibitory effect on revand tat splicing as they do in the context of virus infection. We do not yet understand this difference in the effects in the two systems. One possibility is that in infected cells the alternative 3′ splice sites may compete for limiting splicing factors. An increase in splicing efficiency at the env/nef 3′ splice site may cause a diminution in splicing at the tat andrev 3′ splice sites. In the in vitro splicing system, these factors may not be limiting. Further studies comparing splicing in vivo and in vitro will be necessary to resolve this issue. Our results suggest that the rev A4b 3′ splice site AG dinucleotide contributes to the maintenance of balanced HIV-1 RNA splicing by inhibiting splicing at the env/nef 3′ splice site A5. The only A4b mutation tested that blocks splicing but fails to significantly increase splicing at 3′ splice site A5 is AG↓G to GA↓G. In both this mutant and the AG↓G to AC↓G mutant,env/nef branch point 8 adenosine was used (see Fig. 4), indicating that the ability to branch within this AG dinucleotide is not correlated with repression of splicing at 3′ splice site A5. Furthermore, the use of branch point 8 was abolished by the AG↓G to GG↓G and AG↓G to CG↓G mutations, yet the inhibition of splicing at 3′ splice site A5 was relieved. Interestingly, the AG↓G to GA↓G mutation is unique in that a new AG dinucleotide is created one nucleotide downstream. Several different protein factors that interact with the AG dinucleotide both early and late in spliceosome assembly have been identified by UV cross-linking experiments (27Chiara M.D. Gozani O. Bennett M. Champion-Arnaud P. Palandjian L. Reed R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3317-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 28Wu S. Green M.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4421-4432Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that factors bound at or near the rev A4b 3′ splice site may interfere with assembly of spliceosomes, leading to splicing at env/nef 3′ splice site A5. Alternatively, the three A4b AG mutations that activate 3′ splice site A5 splicing may elicit a change in the RNA secondary structure that allows more efficient formation of spliceosomes at the A5 splice site.

Sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH)1 is a zinc-containing enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of sorbitol to fructose using NAD+ as cofactor. Together with aldose reductase, SDH is a constituent of the polyol pathway, an important bypass of glycolysis (cf. Ref. 1Jeffery J. Jörnvall H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 901-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Overloading of this pathway can lead to accumulation of sorbitol, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications (2Gabbay K.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1973; 288: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). However, inhibitors of sorbitol dehydrogenase also have been reported to alleviate diabetic complications (3Geisen K. Utz R. Grötsch H. Lang H.J. Nimmesgern H. Arzneim. Forsch. Drug Res. 1994; 44: 1032-1043PubMed Google Scholar, 4Tilton R.G. Chang K. Nyengaard J.R. Van den Enden M. Ido Y. Williamson J.R. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 234-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and sorbitol accumulation is perhaps therefore not as decisive a step in the development of the complications as frequently believed. SDH is a zinc enzyme (5Jeffery J. Chesters J. Mills C. Sadler P.J. Jörnvall H. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and belongs to the medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase protein family (MDR), which also includes the well known mammalian alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) (6Jörnvall H. von Bahr-Lindström H.

Despite distinct structural and mechanistic relationships, SDH and ADH differ in zinc content, SDH has only one zinc atom per subunit, at the catalytic site, whereas ADH has two per subunit. In addition, the enzymes differ in quaternary structure, SDH is tetrameric whereas mammalian ADH is dimeric. SDH and ADH do not share substrates, SDH catalyzes the oxidation of polyols such as sorbitol, xylitol,d-mannitol, and l-iditol but has no activity toward primary alcohols. The SDH enzyme has been characterized from a few sources, including sheep (8Jeffery J. Cederlund E. Jörnvall H. Eur. J.

Two allelic variants of Sdh have been observed in fish, toads, and mouse whereas an Sdhpseudogene, which lacks exon 1 and shows a premature stop codon in exon 8, has been characterized in human (24Carr I.M. Markham A.F. Coletta P.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Three different SDH activities of Drosophila melanogasterwere described earlier: soluble NAD+-dependent SDH, a mitochondrial NAD+-dependent SDH, and a soluble NADP+-dependent SDH (25Bischoff W.L. Biochem. Genet. 1976; 14: 1019-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which were assumed to be encoded by three different genes. The structural gene for the cytosolic NAD+-dependent Sdh was mapped at 91B-93F on the third chromosome of D. melanogaster. To date, only another member of the MDR family, class III ADH, has been characterized in Drosophila at the protein (26Danielsson O. Atrian S. Luque T. Hjelmqvist L. Gonzàlez-Duarte R. Jörnvall H.

We find two similar genes, Sdh-1 and Sdh-2 (80% nucleotide identity in the coding regions), and have characterized them and their transcription products. The major enzyme purified was found to be SDH-1, and this form was enzymatically characterized and conformationally modeled, allowing further interpretations of the active site relationships. D. melanogaster genomic DNA (1 μg) was purified according to a modification of the guanidine thiocyanate method (28Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar) and amplified using two degenerate oligonucleotides, designed from species-conserved SDH regions (22Iwata T.

The reaction conditions were as follows. First, a denaturing step of 1 min 30 s at 94 °C and then 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C and 30 s at 65 °C (polymerase from Dynazyme). The product of this amplification was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products) using a random primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). It was then used as a probe to screen 1.5–2 × 105 phages of a λDASH-2 genomic library of D. melanogaster (27Luque T. Atrian S. Danielsson O. Jörnvall H. Gonzàlez-Duarte R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The same probe was used to screen 3–4 × 105 phages of a λgt10 cDNA library from adult D. melanogaster (29Poole S.J. Kauvar L.M. Drees B. Kornberg T. Cell. 1985; 40: 37-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). DNA from positive recombinant phages was isolated according to Ref. 30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar. Positive clones were characterized by restriction mapping (enzymes from Boehringer Mannheim and Promega). Regions homologous to Sdh were identified after Southern blot analysis and subcloned into the Bluescript phagemid (Stratagene). DNA sequencing was performed on double-stranded DNA by the dideoxy method (31Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar) with [35S]dATP (NEN Life Science Products) and a T7 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or with ABIPRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Perkin-Elmer). A set of internal primers was used, and each nucleotide was sequenced at least three times. Total cellular RNA and poly(A)-rich mRNA from adults were obtained as described (27Luque T. Atrian S. Danielsson O. Jörnvall H. Gonzàlez-Duarte R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The 5′ ends of the transcripts were characterized using the 5′-Amplifinder RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) Kit (CLONTECH), using the primers 5′-TCATGGGCTTAGTGAGCAC-3′ (position 61–56 of the amino acid sequence) for cDNA synthesis and 5′-CCTCGATGCCGTGGAGAACAGC-3′ (position 13–7 of the amino acid sequence) for nested PCR. RACE products were subcloned using the SureClone ligation kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and sequenced with the M13 universal primer. Total cellular RNA from larvae, pupae, and adult D. melanogasterwas isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate method (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), separated by 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for hybridization with the same probe as that used for the library screening. A control rehybridization was performed with a D. melanogaster actin gene probe. Sdh expression was studied by reverse transcriptase-PCR from larval, pupal, and adult RNA. PCR was performed with internalSdh oligonucleotides, and gfd/odh was amplified as a control. Polytene chromosome squashes were prepared from D. melanogasterlarval salivary glands using standard techniques. They were screened with a gene fragment amplified from genomic DNA clones using the oligonucleotides corresponding to positions 45–50 and 350–344 of the amino acid sequence. The PCR product was random primed and labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim). The hybridized probe was detected with antidigoxigenin-peroxidase and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as substrate (Boehringer Mannheim). Polytene chromosomes were stained with 5% Giemsa in 50 mm sodium phosphate and then with 2% orcein in 60% acetic acid. Genomic DNA, 4 to 8 μg, purified from adults of D. melanogaster, was digested with EcoRI, BamHI, and HindIII, resolved in 0.6% agarose gel, and transferred by Southern blotting (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

The probe used and the hybridization conditions were the same as those for library screening. D. melanogaster Adh Fadults were bred and harvested following conventional procedures. After homogenization (about 40 g of flies) in 2 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5 (about 150 ml), and centrifugation, protamine sulfate (2%) and ammonium sulfate fractionations (0–35% and 35–75%) were carried out. Sephadex G-25 exclusion chromatography was used to desalt the sample. SDH activity was detected by a standard assay (33Lindstad R.I. Hermansen L.F. McKinley-McKee J.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The enzyme was purified to get rid of short chain Drosophila ADH by affinity chromatography on Blue-Sepharose equilibrated with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, washed with 0.15 m NaCl in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and washed with 1 mmNAD+. SDH activity was eluted with 1.5 m NaCl in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The material was then submitted to fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) on Mono S in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.2, with a gradient of 0–1m NaCl. The SDH activity eluted at 0.2 m and was submitted to exclusion chromatography on Superdex-200 (FPLC). Total protein during purification was determined by the Bradford method (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried through with a Phast system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The pI was determined by isoelectric focusing on Phast IEF 3–9 gels and staining with silver nitrate. Activity staining was performed with nitro blue tetrazolium/phenazine methosulfate (26Danielsson O. Atrian S. Luque T. Hjelmqvist L. Gonzàlez-Duarte R. Jörnvall H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4980-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For structural analysis, the pure protein was reduced and carboxymethylated, followed by proteolytic digestion with Lys-C protease, peptide purification by HPLC, sequence analysis, and peptide mass determinations, as described (35Hjelmqvist L. Shafqat J. Siddiqi A.R. Jörnvall H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Activity with polyols, isopropyl alcohol, and fructose was tested in solution and via activity staining after isoelectric focusing. K m andk cat values were determined with alcohols at pH 10.0 in 0.1 m glycine/NaOH with 10 mmNAD+ and with fructose at pH 7.1 in 0.05 msodium phosphate buffer with 1 mm NAD+.K m for NAD+ was analyzed with 50 mm sorbitol. Enzymatic activities were determined at 25 °C by monitoring the change in absorbance at 340 nm with a Beckman DU 68 or 64 spectrophotometer. Primary structures were aligned using the program CLUSTAL W (36Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56003) Google Scholar), and alignments were visualized using the program PRALIN. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with the program CLUSTAL W. Positions with gaps were excluded, and correction was made for multiple substitutions. Bootstrap analysis (37Felsenstein J. Evolution. 1985; 39: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for confidence evaluation. Three-dimensional models of Drosophila and human SDH were obtained by adopting their amino acid sequences into the known fold of the human class I β ADH subunit (38Hurley T.D. Bosron W.F. Stone C.L. Amzel L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 415-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) using the program ICM (version 2.7, Molsoft LLC, Metuchen, NJ) as described (39Moreno A. Farrés J. Parés X. Jörnvall H. Persson B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). With ICM, docking of sorbitol to the enzyme model was performed using a non-rigid procedure, allowing free movement of the substrate, the rotatable bonds of the substrate, and the χ angles of the ADH molecule and with an additional distance restraint of 2.0–2.4 Å between the sorbitol hydroxyl oxygen (O2) and the catalytic zinc. For comparisons the sheep liver SDH model (12Eklund H. Horjales E. Jörnvall H. Brändén C.-I. Jeffery J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8005-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) also was used. A genomic DNA fragment was amplified with degenerate oligonucleotides. Its size, 164 bp, corresponds to the expected length of an intronless genomic region coding for the selected part of the SDH enzyme. The amino acid sequence, deduced from the sequenced DNA, agrees with that expected from reports of the enzyme from other species. The fragment obtained was used to screen a D. melanogaster genomic library. Several positive clones were isolated and analyzed. Restriction analysis of more than 10 positive clones allowed us to distinguish two different patterns (Fig. 1), namedSdh-1 and Sdh-2. By genomic restriction mapping, the Sdh-2 gene was located adjacent to thegfd/odh gene, the first member of the medium chain ADH family reported in Drosophila (27Luque T. Atrian S. Danielsson O. Jörnvall H. Gonzàlez-Duarte R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Despite the close juxtaposition, the two genes, Sdh-2 and gfd/odh,have an opposite transcriptional orientation. Screening of a cDNA library yielded several positive clones that correspond to theSdh-1 or Sdh-2 genes. The nucleotide sequences of the coding region of Sdh-1 andSdh-2 exhibit 80% identities and their deduced amino acid sequences 90% identities. The genomic sequence of Sdh-1 is deposited under the GenBankTM accession number AF002212 and that of Sdh-2 under AF002213. Both genes consist of 6 exons and 5 introns, which are located at equivalent positions. The cDNA sequences further corroborate the intron locations. Introns follow the GT-AG rule, and their lengths differ between the two genes (Fig.2). Compared with the averageDrosophila intron length (60–70 bp), the size of the second intron of both genes (386 bp in Sdh-1 and 306 bp inSdh-2) and that of the third intron ofSdh-1 (with 264 bp) is large. Regulatory signals were identified in the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of both genes. Sdh-1 shows a conventional TATA box at position 98, and Sdh-2 shows one at position 250. Other consensus sequences for different transcription factors were detected in both genes (Fig. 3). The cDNA sequences are long enough to allow us to determine the length of the trailer (43 bp in Sdh-1 and 21 bp in Sdh-2). A polyadenylation signal with 1 nucleotide mismatch in relation to the consensus is present in both of the two Sdh genes (Fig.3). A single RACE extension product using adult RNA was detected for each Sdh gene. Cloning and sequencing of the RACE fragments confirmed that the transcriptional start site was 67 and 71 bp upstream from the ATG initiator codon inSdh-1 and Sdh-2, respectively (Fig. 3). Thus, the TATA boxes detected in the Sdh-1 and Sdh-2 genomic sequences appear too far away from the transcriptional start sites to be functional. Northern blot analysis showed a single transcript, whose length, 1.3 kb, was in agreement with theSdh coding region. Sdh transcripts were observed in the larval and the adult stage but not in pupae (Fig.4). Since transcript lengths forSdh-1 and Sdh-2 have almost the same size, it was not possible to assess whether the single band resolved on the Northern blot corresponded to one or two genes. Then, reverse transcriptase-PCR analyses were carried out with larval, pupal, and adult RNA, using specific oligonucleotides for Sdh-1 and Sdh-2 genes. Both transcriptional products were amplified at the three stages analyzed, even in pupae where no expression had been detected by Northern blot analysis. At all stages, the Sdh-1 transcript was more abundant than that of Sdh-2, in agreement with results from the protein purification (below). The gfd/odhtranscriptional product was amplified and used as control. Two different hybridization signals were observed (Fig.5) on the R arm of chromosome 3 ofD. melanogaster when hybridized with an Sdh PCR probe. One gene signal mapped at division 486D, at the same site known to harbor the gfd/odh gene. From the genomic restriction map analysis, we could assign the Sdh-2 gene to this position. The second signal mapped at division 84E-F, and it corresponds toSdh-1. DNA of D. melanogaster was digested with EcoRI, BamHI, and HindIII and hybridized with an Sdh probe, which had no restriction site for these enzymes. Two bands were obtained in all digests in agreement with the two Sdh genes (Fig. 6). SDH was purified in batches from 40 g of whole flies by a 5-step method utilizing two precipitation steps and three chromatographies. The preparation obtained had a specific activity of 35 units/mg after a minimally 500-fold to some 1000-fold purification (non-SDH activity in initial steps makes purification-fold difficult to estimate). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated an apparently homogeneous preparation with the presence of a single band positioned identically to that of the sheep liver enzyme (Fig.7) and corresponding to a subunit molecular mass of about 38 kDa. Isoelectric focusing showed a band at pI 9, positive with sorbitol in the activity test with nitro blue tetrazolium and phenazine methosulfate. Tests with sorbitol at pH 5–11 demonstrated an activity optimum at pH 10.0 where the activity with sorbitol was about 1.5-fold that with xylitol, which in turn was about 2-fold that with ribitol. With the most active preparation, values at pH 10.0 for sorbitol were:K m 23 mm, k cat6700 min−1, andk cat/K m 290 mm−1 min−1. Corresponding values for the human enzyme at pH 10 are K m 0.67 mm, k cat 312 min−1, andk cat/K m 466 mm−1 min−1 (9Maret W. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1622-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). TheK m value for NAD+ was found to vary considerably with pH and was about 20-fold lower at pH 7.1 (0.064 mm) than at 10.0 (1.5 mm). To identify the protein prepared versus the two isozyme structures deduced from the DNA, the protein was carboxymethylated and digested with Lys-C protease. Peptides were separated by HPLC and submitted to MALDI-TOF mass analysis or sequencer analysis. Six pure peptides were analyzed and found to correspond to the DNA-deduced primary structure at positions 83–102 (experimental mass 2358versus calculated mass 2357), 106–129 (2902versus 2903), 138–161 (2603 versus 2604), 210–220 (1195 versus 1195), 221–234 (1587versus 1588), and 316–325 (1266 versus 1266). They correspond to isozyme-unique regions which all identified the preparation as SDH-1. To determine the quaternary structure, the native enzyme was submitted to FPLC exclusion chromatography on Superdex-200, which was calibrated with ovalbumin (43 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and catalase (232 kDa). Correlation with the elution position of the SDH preparation gave a value of ∼145 kDa, corresponding to a tetrameric structure with subunits of ∼38 kDa. Combined, these results identify the protein as a sorbitol dehydrogenase with an activity profile and quaternary structure like those of the mammalian enzymes and with constituent peptide regions corresponding to Sdh-1 of the two genes identified. Since previous conformational and zinc ligand assignments of mammalian SDHs versus the related ADHs have involved shifts and reinterpretations in a gap-rich central segment, we decided to model also the Drosophila SDH toward the crystallographically analyzed human class I β1 ADH (38Hurley T.D. Bosron W.F. Stone C.L. Amzel L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 415-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) of the same MDR protein family. We tested an alignment in this central region based on Glu149/Glu150(numbering system of the human enzyme) as the third active site zinc ligand in agreement with results from site-directed mutagenesis (13Karlsson C. Höög J.-O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,16Karlsson C. Jörnvall H. Höög J.-O. Weiner H. Holmes R.S. Wermuth B. Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism. 5. Plenum Press, New York1995: 397-406Google Scholar), and one based on Glu155 as that ligand in agreement with a previous modeling (12Eklund H. Horjales E. Jörnvall H. Brändén C.-I. Jeffery J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8005-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The tests showed thatDrosophila SDH could be modeled into the crystallographically determined human β1 ADH subunit with both alignments. However, the alignment centering on Glu149-Glu150 as the third zinc ligand gave three larger differences toward the mammalian SDH than the previous alignment. One is a shortcut in SDH (Drosophila positions 109/112) down chain from the structural zinc in ADH, the second an insertion at residues 158–162 increasing a loop, and the third a gap corresponding to Phe116 in the sheep SDH model. This gap would involve the wall of the substrate binding site (12Eklund H. Horjales E. Jörnvall H. Brändén C.-I. Jeffery J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8005-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and make the substrate pocket slightly larger. This new alignment was therefore not further pursued since the enzymology now suggests an unalteredk cat/K m ratio compatible with a lack of large differences. Also, recent crystallography of homologous tetrameric ADH forms appear compatible with Glu155 as the third ligand in SDH (17Korkhin Y. Kalb(Gilboa) A.J. Peretz M. Bogin O. Burstein Y. Frolow F. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 967-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Hence we used that alignment for theDrosophila SDH modeling. We also modeled in the same alignment the human SDH subunit, such that the human/Drosophila SDH relationships can be evaluated both in relation to enzymology and to differences with ADH. The results show that the SDH sequences can be modeled into an ADH-related fold (Fig. 9), giving structures overall similar to that obtained for sheep SDH (12Eklund H. Horjales E. Jörnvall H. Brändén C.-I. Jeffery J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8005-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The Drosophila SDH structure is found to have all the Cys residues (Drosophila positions 95, 98, 101, 109; Fig. 8) that correspond to the Cys ligands at the second zinc atom of ADH (ADH positions 97, 100, 103, 111). This is also a feature with the B. mori, Saccharomyces pombe, B. subtilis, and Escherichia coli SDHs, but with no other SDH. Nevertheless, the SDHs with these Cys residues still appear not to have the second zinc atom, as proven for the B. subtilis enzyme (11Ng K. Ye R. Wu X.-C. Wong S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24989-24994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore they resemble the one-zinc (5Jeffery J. Chesters J. Mills C. Sadler P.J. Jörnvall H.

Facile enzymatic reductions of carboxylic acids to aldehydes by aryl-aldehyde oxidoreductases are typically ATP- and NADPH-dependent (Fig. 1) and involve putative acyl-AMP intermediates (10Gross G.G.

Earlier aqueous solvent-based syntheses generally gave low product yields, presented significant difficulties during reaction work up, and gave acyl-AMP derivatives that were poorly characterized. Most commonly, the condensation of AMP and carboxylic acids has involved initial coupling of carboxylic acids withN,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) (13Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 608-611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in alkaline medium. Ethylchloroformate was used as a carboxylic acid coupling reagent in the synthesis of relatively impure, N-protected aminoacyl-adenylates (14Michelson A.M. Letters R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 80: 242-246PubMed Google Scholar). Racemic isobutyl chloroformate was later used instead to afford acyl-adenylates that were characterized by elemental analysis and IR and low-field 1H-NMR spectroscopies. Isobutyl chloroformate is not widely used because syntheses are complicated by the presence of an unwanted chiral center in the coupling reagent. The availability of highly pure and well characterized carbonyl-AMP derivatives is essential when attempting to clarify enzyme mechanisms involving such intermediates. For example, a poorly defined synthetic acyl-AMP derivative led to incorrect conclusions that biotin activation was not involved in holocarboxylase synthesis from apocarboxylase (18Kosow D.P. Huang S.C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3633-3639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Siegel L. Foote J.L. Christine J.E. Coon M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1963; 13: 307-312Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). N,N′-Carbonyldiimidazole has been used to selectively activate carboxyl groups, even in the presence of potentially reactive functional groups like phenols (20Staab H.A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1962; 1: 351-367Crossref Google Scholar). In an effort to elucidate the nature of intermediates involved in the enzymatic reduction of carboxylic acids to aldehydes (7Dieckmann R. Pavela-Vrancic M. Pfeifer E. von Döhren H. Kleinkauf H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1074-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we sought to develop a simpler, nonaqueous-based synthesis of carbonyl-AMP by usingN,N′-carbonyldiimidazole as a coupling reagent. We report the first complete structure elucidation of benzoyl-AMP. Furthermore, carboxy-13C-benzoyl-AMP was synthesized and used in a 13C-NMR study of Nocardiaaryl-aldehyde oxidoreductase to confirm the involvement of benzoyl-AMP in the enzymatic reduction of benzoic acid to benzaldehyde. 13C- (90.6 MHz) and31P-NMR(145.7 MHz) spectra were obtained with a Bruker WM 360 spectrometer. 1H, heteroatom multiple bond correlation, and heteroatom multiple quantum correlation (HMQC) (21Bax A.

All samples were dissolved in D2O/DCl (5% DCl), and 2-13C-acetic acid was used as the internal standard for13C (δ = 20.08) NMR. Neat phosphoric acid was used as the external standard for 31P-NMR. NMR chemical shifts (δ) are reported in parts per million (ppm), and the coupling constants (J values) are in Hertz (Hz). NMR abbreviations are s = singlets, d = doublets, dd = doublets of doublets, t = triplets, and m = multiplets. High resolution fast atom bombardment MS was performed at the University of Iowa, high resolution mass spectrometry core facility using a VG analytical ZAB instrument with polyethylene glycol 600/NaI/3-nitrobenzyl alcohol as the carrier. Ultraviolet spectra for benzoyl-AMP and AMP were determined in triplicate in water solutions using a Shimadzu Model UV-2101PC scanning spectrophotometer. Thin layer chromatography (TLC)1 was carried out on 0.25-mm thick layers of silica gel GF254 developed with solvent system A, benzene:acetone (80:20 v/v) containing 1% formic acid, or solvent system B, acetic acid:water:butanol (2:3:5 v/v/v). With solvent system A, benzoic acid and benzoylimidazole gaveRf values of 0.58 and 0.28, respectively. With solvent system B, benzoyl-AMP and AMP gave Rfvalues of 0.50 and 0.25, respectively. Developed TLC plates were visualized under 254-nm UV light or by spraying plates with Von's reagent (24 g of ammonium molybdate, 1 g of cerric ammonium sulfate, and 31 ml of H2SO4 in 500 ml of water). Benzoyl-AMP was prepared by the reaction sequence outlined in Fig. 2. In a typical reaction, 36 mg of benzoic acid (0.30 mmol) was reacted with 51 mg of N,N′-carbonyldiimidazole (0.31 mmol) in 10 ml of anhydrous DMF (Aldrich, Sure/Seal containers under N2) at room temperature for 2 h, at which time the reaction was essentially quantitative. Then, 105 mg of 5′-AMP (0.30 mmol, free acid, dried over P2O5, Sigma), 20 ml of anhydrous DMF, and 0.5% pyridine (Aldrich, Sure/Seal container under N2) in 0.1 ml of DMF were added to the reaction mixture, which was stirred at room temperature for an additional 72 h. TLC analysis showed that the reaction was complete with only one spot at Rf 0.50 for benzoyl-AMP (estimated 90% yield). All chromatographic procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The reaction mixture was diluted with 200 ml of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2, and loaded onto a DE52 ion exchange column (2.6 × 20 cm, chloride form). Benzoyl-AMP was eluted with a gradient of NaCl from 0 to 150 mm in the starting buffer (700 ml). The fractions (8.5 ml each) containing benzoyl-AMP (fraction 55–76) were combined and lyophilized. The lyophilized preparation was then dissolved in 15 ml of 1 mm HCl and passed over a Bio-Gel P-2 column (5 × 100 cm). The benzoyl-AMP-containing fractions were pooled and lyophilized to give 760 mg of dry powder containing 108 mg of sodium benzoyl-AMP (0.228 mmol, 76% yield). The final preparation was stored at −20 °C. This product was completely characterized by MS and1H-, 13C-, and 31P-NMR spectral analyses. The content of benzoyl-AMP in the lyophilized powder was determined both by enzyme analysis and by hydrolysis of benzoyl-AMP and UV quantitation of the resulting AMP product. For enzymatic quantitation, the reaction mixture contained 0.15 mm NADPH and 0.01 unit of purified carboxylic acid oxidoreductase in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5. The amount of benzoyl-AMP was determined by measuring the Δ340 as NADPH was oxidized to NADP+. For hydrolysis, 10-mg samples of benzoyl-AMP preparations were dissolved in 100 ml of 0.1 N NaOH and hydrolyzed at room temperature for 5 h. The AMP content of the reaction mixture was determined by comparing optical densities of the hydrolyzed solutions at 259 nm to absorbances for standards of AMP in NaOH. A sample of 36 mg of carboxy-13C- benzoic acid (99 atom %, Isotech, Miamisburg, OH) was used to synthesize 13C-carboxy-labeled benzoyl-AMP by the same method. The purified product, 0.216 mmol, 72% yield, was characterized by TLC, MS, and with 13C- and31P- NMR. The enzyme was produced and purified from cells of Nocardia sp. NRRL 5646 and characterized by our methods (7Dieckmann R. Pavela-Vrancic M. Pfeifer E. von Döhren H. Kleinkauf H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1074-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The enzyme preparation used in this work had a specific activity of 6.5 units/mg of protein. One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of 1 μmol of benzoic acid to benzaldehyde per minute at 25 °C. Enzyme reactions were incubated for 40 min in 0.6 ml of 50 mm, pH 7.5, Tris-HCl with 0.05 unit of enzyme in a 5-mm NMR tube. Each reaction received 50 μl of D2O, which was added as a locking reagent, and 5 μl of dioxane as the internal standard (δ = 67.4 ppm). For the benzoyl-AMP trapping reaction, the reaction mixture contained 3 m, salt-free hydroxylamine (23Loftfield R.B. Eigner E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 130: 426-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), 2.5 mm carboxy-13C-benzoic acid, 1 mmATP, and 10 mm MgCl2. For 13C-NMR observation of benzoyl-AMP reduction by NADPH, the reaction contained 0.1 mm carboxy-13C-benzoyl-AMP and 0.15 mm NADPH. For benzoate reduction, 2.5 mmcarboxy-13C-benzoic acid, 0.15 mm NADPH, 1 mm ATP, and 10 mm MgCl2 were included. All 13C-NMR spectral signals were identified by comparison with those for authentic compounds. All 13C-NMR spectral signals in enzyme reactions were obtained by accumulations of 760 pulses. Benzoyl-AMP was prepared in a simple, two-step sequence. In the first step, based on TLC analysis, the reaction between benzoic acid and N,N′-carbonyldiimidazole was quantitative within 2 h at room temperature. The coupling of AMP to the benzoyl group in the second step was enhanced by the inclusion of 0.5% pyridine. After 72 h, the reaction mixture contained one product, benzoyl-AMP (Rf = 0.5) and small amounts of AMP (Rf = 0.25). The final product gave a single TLC spot at Rf = 0.50, and the purity was confirmed to be greater than 98% by NMR spectroscopy. Benzoyl-AMP gave a high resolution fast atom bombardment MS molecular ion at 474.0778 for C17H18N5PO8Na (calculated, 474.0787). The UV spectrum showed λmaxvalues at 237 nm (ε = 15,900) and 260 nm (ε = 12,900). These absorptions were comparable with that for AMP, which shows λmax at 260 nm (ε = 13,200). Proton-carbon NMR spectral correlations of benzoyl-AMP were established by HMQC (22Bax A. Summers M.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 2093-2094Crossref Scopus (3258) Google Scholar), and these assignments were further confirmed by heteroatom multiple bond correlation spectroscopy (21Bax A. Griffey R.H. Hawkins B.L. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 55: 301-315Google Scholar) as shown in TableI. For example, the proton signal for H-1′ at δ 6.01 is attached to C-1′ (by HMQC) and is two-bond correlated with C-2′, three-bond correlated with C-4, 8, 3′, and 4′ to unambiguously confirm this assignment. Benzoyl-AMP preparations were estimated to be >98% pure because no AMP containing impurities could be detected by 13C- and 31P-NMR. The signal for the carbonyl-carbon of benzoyl-AMP was a doublet at δ 162.25 (J = 8.4 Hz) because of coupling with the31P nucleus.Table IProton, carbon, and phosphorus NMR assignments of benzoyl-AMPCarbonδC (JCP = Hz)aSplit by coupling with 31P.δH(J = Hz)HMBCbHeteroatom multiple bond correlation signals are listed by order of intensity.2150.28.09 (1H, s)C6, C44146.85116.56152.98137.78.29 (1H, s)C5, C41′85.06.01 (1H, d, J = 5.6)C8, C4, C3′, C4′, C2′2′71.54.9 (1H, t, J = 5.5)C4′, C1′3′68.54.64 (1H, dd, J = 5.1, 4.2)C1′, C5′4′81.8 (d, J = 6.6)4.48–4.51 (2H, m)C2′, C1′5′64.6 (d, J = 6.2)4.48–4.51 (2H, m)C2′, C1′4.39–4.43 (1H, m)C3′1“126.2 (d, J = 7.7)2“, 6”127.57.61 (2H, dd, J = 8.2, 1.1)C5“, C1”, C3“, C4”3“, 5”126.37.2 (2H, t, J = 7.8)C2“, C4”, C1“4“132.27.47 (1H, t, J = 7.5)C3“7“162.2 (d, J = 8.1)a Split by coupling with 31P.b Heteroatom multiple bond correlation signals are listed by order of intensity. Open table in a new tab Carboxy-13C-benzoyl-AMP was prepared by the same method. Carboxy-13C-benzoyl-AMP gave a carboxy carbon signal at δ 162.25 (d, J = 8.4 Hz) by 13C-NMR and gave a phosphorus signal at δ −6.52 ppm (d, J = 8.4 Hz) by 31P-NMR, clearly demonstrating the anhydride coupling between the 13C and 31P nuclei. The complete assignments of signals and 13C-31P coupling results were essential to show that the carbonyl-phosphate anhydride exists, versus other undesirable isomers in which, for example, the benzoyl group was linked to AMP through either the amino group, or a ribose oxygen atom of the adenyl moiety. To be detected as a free metabolite such as valproyl-AMP (3Mao L-F. Millington D.S. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3143-3146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), carbonyl-AMP derivatives require reasonable aqueous stability. For a 0.5 mm solution of benzoyl-AMP in 50 mm, Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 25 °C, the pseudo first-order rate constant was determined to be 1.92 × 10−2 ± 3.3 × 10−4 h−1. This indicates that benzoyl-AMP is sufficiently stable for use as a substrate in enzyme kinetic and mechanism studies. Lyophilized benzoyl-AMP is stable for at least 6 months at −20 °C. NMR Spectroscopy was used to obtain direct structural information for the involvement of benzoyl-AMP in the aryl-aldehyde oxidoreductase catalyzed reduction of benzoic acid to benzaldehyde. To enhance NMR spectral analyses of putative intermediates and products, we utilized both 13C-carboxy-enriched benzoic acid and benzoyl-AMP as substrates for purified aryl-aldehyde oxidoreductase, ATP-, and NADPH-dependent reductions conducted in NMR tubes. Use of isotopically enriched substrates permitted the ready acquisition of spectra in enzyme reactions. Three types of enzyme reactions were examined, each containing in addition to enzyme: ATP and hydroxylamine together with labeled benzoic acid (Fig.3 A), NADPH with labeled benzoyl-AMP (Fig. 3 B), and NADPH and ATP with labeled benzoic acid (Fig. 3 C). After 40-min incubations at room temperature, all were analyzed to give the13C-NMR spectral results shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3, spectrum A contains carbonyl signals at both δ 176.4 and δ 169 for unutilized benzoic acid substrate and the benzoyl-hydroxamate derivative, showing that the benzoyl-AMP intermediate is formed during the enzymatic reduction reaction.Spectrum B shows a single signal at δ 202.8 for the carbonyl carbon atom of benzaldehyde, the product formed when benzoyl-AMP is reduced by the enzyme with NADPH. Spectrum Cshows signals at δ 176.4 and δ 200.8 for residual, unreacted benzoic acid substrate and product benzaldehyde, respectively. N,N′-Carbonyldiimidazole is a useful, general carboxylic acid activating reagent because it selectively reacts with carboxylic acids even in the presence of hydroxy or phenolic functional groups (20Staab H.A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1962; 1: 351-367Crossref Google Scholar). In this study, carbonyldiimidazole was used to obtain unambiguous coupling of AMP and benzoic acid to give benzoyl-AMP in high yield and facilitated the chromatographic purification of the product. Benzoyl-AMP was fully characterized by spectral analysis for the first time. All proton and carbon signals were clearly assigned by the use of standard proton-carbon correlation spectroscopies and by carbon-phosphorus couplings. In previous studies, Armstrong et al. (15Armstrong D.W. Seguin R. Saburi M. Fendler J.H. J. Mol. Evol. 1979; 13: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) used the P-O-C infrared stretch between 1040–1090 cm−1 as partial spectral evidence for the existence of a mixed acyl-phosphoanhydride. Low field1H-NMR spectroscopy showed H-8 as a broad doublet, a spectral observation that cannot be explained for a single acyl-AMP isomer. The precise elaboration of all carbon NMR signals for benzoyl-AMP (Table I) was an essential step prior to the use of13C-carbonyl-enriched benzoic acid or benzoyl-AMP as substrates for NMR experiments designed to identify the in situ formation of intermediates in the aryl-aldehyde oxidoreductase reaction. Furthermore, the half-life of 36 h for dilute solutions of benzoyl-AMP in Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 25 °C ensured its stability as a substrate in mechanism studies. Previous studies which implicated carbonyl-AMP intermediates during enzymatic carboxylic acid reduction (1Vignais P.V. Zabin I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1958; 29: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 2Christner J.E. Schlesinger M.J. Coon M.J. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1972; 31: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) relied primarily on the use of radiolabeled precursors and chromatographic (TLC, gas chromatography) analyses to identify metabolites. With an enzyme fromNeurospora crassa, Gross (10Gross G.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 31: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) trapped14C-labeled benzoyl-AMP as a hydroxamate derivative that was identified by TLC. 14C-labeled benzaldehyde was chromatographically identified as the product obtained when14COOH-labeled benzoate was used as substrate. Although Kato et al. (24Kato N. Joung E-H. Yang H-C. Masuda M. Shimao M. Yanase H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 757-762Google Scholar) implicated benzoyl-AMP as an intermediate in benzoic acid reduction by an enzyme from Nocardia asteroides, it was not characterized. NMR analyses of the enzymatic reductions of benzoic acid with ATP only (Fig. 3 A), with benzoyl-AMP plus NADPH (Fig. 3 B), or with ATP plus NADPH (Fig. 3 C) provided direct evidence for the involvement of benzoyl-AMP in the reduction reaction. Attempts to measure benzoyl-AMP directly as an intermediate in the conversion of benzoic acid to benzaldehyde were unsuccessful. Because benzoyl-AMP is likely a transient intermediate present only in low steady-state concentrations, others have indirectly measured benzoyl-AMP formed in similar enzyme reactions by use of hydroxylamine. Hydroxymate derivatives can only be formed with acyl-adenylates and not with benzoic acid. In previous studies, such hydroxymates have been detected with thin layer chromatography (10Gross G.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 31: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Loftfield R.B. Eigner E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 130: 426-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). When hydroxylamine was used as a “trapping” reagent in our experiment (Fig. 3 A), the signal for the carboxyl group of unutilized 13C-labeled benzoic acid appeared at 176.4 ppm, whereas the hydroxymate derivative appeared at 169 ppm. No reaction was observed when benzoic acid, ATP, and the carboxylic acid reductase were reacted together in control incubations. The precise kinetic mechanism by which benzoic acid is reduced to benzaldehyde remains to be established. Whether benzoyl-AMP is actually released from the enzyme active site during catalysis is not known. Benzoyl-AMP, has a significantly lower (67-fold) apparentK m (9.66 ± 0.71 μm), a higher (1.3-fold) V max (7.50 ± 0.18 μmol min−1 mg−1) than those for benzoic acid (7Dieckmann R. Pavela-Vrancic M. Pfeifer E. von Döhren H. Kleinkauf H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1074-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These results indicate that steady-state levels of benzoyl-AMP are low during the course of the reduction of benzoic acid to benzaldehyde. The results of this study, together with our previous work in which benzaldehyde was isolated and characterized spectrally, clearly demonstrate that the mechanism for benzoic acid reduction to benzaldehyde by purified Nocardia sp. NRRL 5646 aryl-aldehyde oxidoreductase, involves benzoyl-AMP as an intermediate. We are grateful to John Snyder for help with NMR instruments."

(1993)Gene (Amst.) 131, 129–134). Previously, we showed that this activator can remodel chromatin in yeast in a hormone-dependent manner. In this work, we show that a weakened VP16 activation domain in GAL4·ER·VP16 still allows hormone-dependent chromatin remodeling, but mutations in the AF-2 domain that abolish activity in the native ER also eliminate the ability of GAL4·ER·VP16 to activate transcription and to remodel chromatin. These findings suggest that an important role of the AF-2 domain in the native ER is to mask the activation potential of the AF-1 activation domain in the unliganded state; upon ligand activation, a conformational change releases AF-2-mediated repression and transcriptional activation ensues. We also show that the AF-2 domain, although inactive at simple promoters on its own in yeast, can enhance transcription by the MCM1 activator in hormone-dependent manner, consistent with its having a role in activation as well as repression in the native ER.

The estrogen receptor (ER)1 is a member of a superfamily of nuclear receptors, which are ligand-activated transcription factors. These proteins have independent modular domains capable of DNA binding, ligand binding (LBD), and transcriptional activation (1Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Two distinct domains have transactivation capacity: a hormone-independent transactivation function (AF-1) resides in the N terminus, while the hormone-dependent AF-2 lies within the hormone-binding domain (2Webster N.J.G. Green S. Jin J.R. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 54: 199-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 3Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). These domains appear to interact functionally and probably physically. For example, when expressed as separate peptides in mammalian cells, the two domains synergize to activate a reporter plasmid only in the presence of hormone (4Kraus W.L. McInerney E.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12314-12318Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The AF-1 domain displays constitutive activity in some cells (3Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar) and is active in yeast cells, and both the AF-1 and the AF-2 domains can behave as transcriptional activators when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain (5Pham T.A. Hwung Y.-P. Santiso-Mere D. McDonnell D.P. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1043-1050PubMed Google Scholar, 6Metzger D. Losson R. Bornert J.-M. Lemoine Y. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2813-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Additionally, coactivators for nuclear receptors interact with AF-2 in mammalian cells (7Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). With the determination of the partial crystal structure (LBD) of four nuclear receptors, including the liganded estrogen receptor (8Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T.

Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar), the mechanism of action of this superfamily is coming into focus. The ligand-binding domain of nuclear receptors appears to act as a switch or a “mouse-trap.” The ligand binds to a pocket in the receptor, tripping a conformational change that rearranges helix 12 to form a “lid” over the agonist. Helix 12 contains the AF-2 core, and Wurtzet al. (12Wurtz J.-M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.-P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar) suggest that realignment may create a new surface for interactions with co-activators and/or break connections with repressors. Brzozowski et al. (8Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engström O. Öhman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.-A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar) have shown that an estrogen antagonist prevents the alignment of helix 12, providing further evidence that activation requires this new surface. However, it is still not clear how tripping the mouse-trap of the LBD leads to activation of the receptor. It is certain that the AF-2 core is vital for productive interaction with agonist. Danielian et al. (13Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) demonstrated that mutations in this core significantly reduce ligand-dependent transcription, without affecting steroid or DNA binding. The co-activators RIP 140 and TIF2 likewise require AF-2 core activity to interact with nuclear receptors (14Joyeux A. Cavailles V. Balaguer B. Nicolas J.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S. Zechel C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar), while SRC-1 also requires a lysine residue in helix 3 (16Henttu P.M.A. Kalkhoven E. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1832-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Experiments utilizing the modular domains of nuclear receptors are instructional in elucidating the mechanisms of receptor activation and transcription. Previously, using a chimeric transcription factor, GAL4·ER·VP16, we demonstrated that disruption of chromatin structure required an unmasked activation domain (17Stafford G.A. Morse R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11526-11534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). GAL4·ER·VP16 is composed of the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain, the human estrogen receptor hormone binding/AF-2 domain, and the viral VP16 activation domain (18Louvion J.-F. Havaux-Copf B. Picard D. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This hormone-dependent transcriptional activator perturbed chromatin in a yeast episome, outside of the context of a bona fide promoter, only when both hormone and the VP16 activation domain were present. Likewise, the yeast GAL4 protein significantly disrupted chromatin structure only when in an active form. Here, we further show that a weakened VP16 domain in GAL4·ER·VP16 does not abrogate its ability to disrupt chromatin. Conversely, mutations that abolish AF-2 activity without compromising hormone binding or binding to DNA in the intact estrogen receptor (13Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) also eliminate the ability of GAL4·ER·VP16 to activate a lacZreporter and disrupt chromatin structure without interfering with the ability of the chimeric receptor to bind hormone or to bind to DNA. These results suggest that the AF-2 domain has a repressive function in the unliganded ER, which can act even on a heterologous activation domain, and that mutations in the AF-2 domain can prevent ligand from “unlocking” this configuration. Additionally, these results support the tight correlation between an intact activation domain and chromatin remodeling observed previously (17Stafford G.A. Morse R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11526-11534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Axelrod J.D. Reagan M.S. Majors J.

Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3158-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We also show that, while eliminating the VP16 moiety results in a factor incapable of independently activating transcription or remodeling our chromatin reporter, GAL4·ER can still synergize with a proximal activator. The plasmid TALS was transformed into yeast following digestion withHindIII and religation to remove pUC19 sequences (22Roth S.Y. Dean A. Simpson R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2247-2260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GAL4·ER·VP16 was expressed from the plasmid pHCA (generously provided by D. Picard; Ref. 18Louvion J.-F. Havaux-Copf B. Picard D. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Mutations in GAL4·ER·VP16 were introduced by polymerase chain reaction. GAL4·ER·VP16 mutants were subcloned into pRS414 following digestion with ClaI andSpeI. The coding sequence for the VP16 activation domain was removed by SacI digestion of the parent GAL4·ER·VP16 construct, followed by religation. The β-galactosidase reporter plasmid pRS314–17Δ80lacZ contains a single GAL4 binding site upstream of the bacterial lacZ gene (23Ryan M.P. Jones R. Morse R.H. Mol. Cell.

The GAL4 binding site is 315 bp upstream of the transcription start site for lacZ in this plasmid, and the edge to edge distance between the GAL4 and MCM1 binding sites is 71 bp. LexA·ER·VP16 was made by replacing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in pHCA with the bacterial LexA DNA-binding domain. The reporter plasmid pSH18–34 contains eight LexA binding sites driving the lacZgene. 2S. Hanes, unpublished results. Plasmids were transformed into yeast cells by a standard LiOAc method (27Hill J.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3033-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and digested with varying concentrations of micrococcal nuclease (MNase) (Worthington) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cleavage patterns were consistent over a range of 0–50 units/ml. Naked DNA controls were purified from nuclei preparations prior to digestion with MNase. Cleavage patterns were visualized by indirect end labeling (31Nedospasov S.A. Georgiev G.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 92: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 32Wu C. Nature. 1980; 286: 854-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Following clean-up with phenol and chloroform, aliquots were treated with RNase and digested with EcoRV. The samples were electrophoresed along with HaeIII-digested ΦX markers in a 1.2% agarose gel at 4 V/cm for 5–5.5 h. The DNA was transferred to nylon membranes (Duralon UV, Stratagene) and Southern analysis performed. Probes wereEcoRV to XbaI fragments from TALS prepared by polymerase chain reaction. Indirect end label analysis was done in two independent experiments for each of the AF-2 mutants examined here, as well as for the parent F442P receptor. DNA was prepared by pelleting 10 ml of cell cultures grown to A 600 = 0.6–1.2, resuspending in 500 μl of 10 mm Tris, 1 mmEDTA, and rapidly lysing with glass beads in the presence of 100 μl of 5% SDS, 5 mg/ml proteinase K. Purified DNA was separated on 1.5% agarose gels with 40 μg/ml chloroquine diphosphate (Sigma) in both gel and buffer at 2.5 V/cm for 18–20 h. The gel was blotted and probed as above. Quantitation of topoisomers was performed by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics) and the Gaussian centers of distribution calculated. We previously used the chimeric transcription factor GAL4·ER·VP16 to demonstrate activation domain-dependent chromatin disruption in the yeast episome TALS, which contains a strong binding site for GAL4 within a positioned nucleosome (17Stafford G.A. Morse R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11526-11534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Since it has been reported that the DNA binding activity of the intact estrogen receptor is affected by hormone addition (33Gilbert D.M. Losson R. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4525-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 34Kladde M.P. Xu M. Simpson R.T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11384-11391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we wished to separate possible effects of the hormone-binding domain of GAL4·ER·VP16 on its DNA-binding domain from those due to unmasking of the activation domain. We first examined the effect of reducing the activation potential of GAL4·ER·VP16 by introducing a point mutation into the VP16 activation domain, F442P, which reduces activity of GAL4-VP16 at aCYC1-lacZ reporter driven by theGAL1–10 UAS by two-thirds (36Berger S.L. Piña B. Silverman N. Marcus G.A. Agapite J. Regier J.L. Triezenberg S.J. Guarente L. Cell. 1992; 70: 251-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Transcription was monitored using a lacZ construct containing a single strong GAL4 binding site (UAS17) in the presence and absence of hormone. Transcription by the mutant GAL4·ER·VP16(F442P) showed a modest reduction, to about 60% of the activity induced by GAL4·ER·VP16 (Fig. 1). (Although the standard errors for these measurements were fairly large, we consistently observed lower activity of the mutant than of the parental GAL4·ER·VP16 when the two were measured simultaneously. Furthermore, Student's t test yields p < 0.001 for the null hypothesis that the two activators are equally active.) We next assessed the ability of GAL4·ER·VP16(F442P) to remodel chromatin structure in the TALS reporter plasmid. The TALS minichromosome is packaged into strongly positioned nucleosomes in yeast α cells by the α2·MCM1 protein complex in conjunction with Ssn6p and Tup1p (37Cooper J.P. Roth S.Y. Simpson R.T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1400-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We assayed chromatin remodeling in TALS by following hormone-dependent changes in MNase cleavage patterns in the presence of GAL4·ER·VP16(F442P). Isolated nuclei were subjected to different concentrations of MNase for 10 min, followed by indirect end label analysis (31Nedospasov S.A. Georgiev G.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 92: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 32Wu C. Nature. 1980; 286: 854-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). The pattern of MNase cleavages in TALS chromatin induced by GAL4·ER·VP16(F442P) changed upon the addition of β-estradiol (Fig.2, left panel). Thelowest arrowhead marks a site of enhanced cleavage seen when cells are grown with hormone. The upper two arrowheads mark cleavage sites seen only in the presence of hormone. These hormone-dependent alterations in TALS chromatin demonstrate perturbation of nucleosome IV, which contains the GAL4 binding site, and the adjacent nucleosome III, and are indistinguishable from those seen previously with GAL4·ER·VP16 (17Stafford G.A. Morse R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11526-11534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Perturbation of chromatin structure in a closed circular minichromosome can result in a change in the distribution of supercoiled topoisomers, since each nucleosome in the plasmid constrains one negative supercoil (38Germond J.E. Hirt B. Oudet P. Gross-Bellard M. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1843-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of GAL4·ER·VP16(F442P) on TALS topology, DNA from cells expressing the chimeric factor was rapidly harvested and treated to inactivate topoisomerases (so that the distribution of supercoiled plasmids reflected the in vivodistribution). We previously demonstrated that GAL4·ER·VP16 in the absence of β-estradiol did not alter plasmid topology as compared with DNA from cells lacking GAL4·ER·VP16. Cells harboring GAL4·ER·VP16 and grown in the presence of hormone exhibited a shift in the center of distribution of the topoisomers equivalent to the loss of almost one negative turn (17Stafford G.A. Morse R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11526-11534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Hormone induction of GAL4·ER·VP16(F442P) likewise resulted in the loss of negative supercoiling in TALS (Fig. 3,lanes 1 and 2). These topoisomer distributions conform to Gaussian distributions, which allows their centers to be measured precisely from the relative intensities of individual topoisomers (39Morse R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Consequently, differences in topology can also be measured with precision. Quantitation yielded a value for the loss of negative supercoiling in TALS in the presence of hormone-activated GAL4·ER·VP16(F442P) of 0.6 ± 0.2 (TableI), similar to the value seen with GAL4·ER·VP16 (0.7 ± 0.1) (17Stafford G.A. Morse R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11526-11534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, the modest reduction in activation potential caused by the F442P mutation did not detectably diminish the ability of GAL4·ER·VP16 to remodel TALS chromatin.Table IAlterations in linking number of TALS minichromosomes by parent and mutant GAL4·ER·VP16(F442P) receptorsAF-2 domainWTL539A/L540AM543A/L544ALinking number shift0.6 ± 0.2 (3)0.07 ± 0.14 (4)0.03 ± 0.02 (3)Values shown were obtained by taking the differences between the centers of the Gaussian distributions of TALS topoisomers in the presence and absence of 100 nm β-estradiol for each of the indicated GAL4·ER·VP16(F442P) receptors.

The number of independent measurements used to determine each value is given in parentheses. The hormone-binding domain of the estrogen receptor also contains an activation domain (AF-2). The AF-2 domain can activate transcription in the absence of the AF-1 or any other transcriptional activation domain in mammalian cells (2Webster N.J.G. Green S. Jin J.R. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 54: 199-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In yeast, the AF-2 domain apparently lacks a universal ability to activate transcription on its own; although it can activate transcription from a complex promoter, it does not activate trancription from a simple promoter lacking binding site(s) for other activators (6Metzger D. Losson R. Bornert J.-M. Lemoine Y. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2813-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 17Stafford G.A. Morse R.H. J. Biol.

Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Either of two pairs of mutations within AF-2 (L539A/L540A and M543A/L544A of the human ER) almost totally abolishes transcriptional activation by the estrogen receptor in mammalian cells, without affecting DNA or ligand binding (13Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). In order to assess the requirements for AF-2 activity in the context of the chimeric activator, we introduced these mutations into GAL4·ER·VP16(F442P) and expressed the resulting mutant proteins in yeast. To demonstrate that the mutant GAL4·ER·VP16 receptors still effectively bound hormone, we first attempted binding assays using radiolabeled β-estradiol with both intact yeast cells (40Shiau S.-P. Glasebrook A. Harkikar S.D. Yang N.N. Hershberger C.L. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or yeast cellular extracts (41Lyttle C.R. Damian-Matsumura P. Juul H. Butt T.R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 42: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, although binding was easily measured and could be competed with unlabeled β-estradiol, identical results were obtained whether or not the yeast cells expressed GAL4·ER·VP16. As an alternative, we therefore performed an in vivo competition assay. YJ0 cells harboring an expression vector for LexA·ER·VP16 and a β-galactosidase reporter containing eight LexA binding sites were transformed with expression plasmids for mutant and wild type GAL4·ER·VP16(F442P) or an empty vector control. LexA·ER·VP16 is identical to GAL4·ER·VP16, except it contains the LexA DNA-binding domain in place of that for GAL4, and functions as a hormone-dependent transcriptional activator via LexA binding sites. 3B. Balasubramanian and R. H. Morse, unpublished results. At limiting hormone concentrations, we expected that the GAL4·ER·VP16 chimeras might compete with LexA·ER·VP16 for the available β-estradiol and hence decrease transcription of the β-galactosidase reporter gene. As shown in Table II, β-galactosidase activity induced by LexA·ER·VP16 in the presence of 2.5 nm β-estradiol was indeed reduced by about 40% in cells harboring pRS414GAL4·ER·VP16(F442P) compared with cells harboring the empty vector pRS414. Similarly, the chimeric GAL4·ER·VP16(F442P) receptors containing mutated AF-2 domains also reduced β-galactosidase activity induced by LexA·ER·VP16 by about 50% (Table II). In contrast, β-galactosidase activity induced by LexA·ER·VP16 was reduced only slightly by either the wild type or mutant GAL4·ER·VP16(F442P) receptors at 250 nmβ-estradiol (Table II), supporting the interpretation of the results at 2.5 nm β-estradiol as being due to competition for limiting hormone. Thus, these results indicate that, as for the intact ER (13Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), the L539A/L540A and M543A/L544A mutations in the AF-2 domain do not affect hormone binding in the GAL4·ER·VP16 chimeras.Table IICompetition for limiting β-estradiol by GAL4·ER·VP16(F442P) receptors reduces transcription of a β-galactosidase reporter gene by LexA·ER·VP16AF-2 domainNoneWTL539A/L540AM543A/L544A2.5 nmβ-estradiol1.000.62 ± 0.040.55 ± 0.050.46 ± 0.07250 nmβ-estradiol1.000.90 ± 0.030.82 ± 0.030.79 ± 0.03A β-galactosidase reporter gene driven by LexA·ER·VP16 via eight LexA binding sites was induced with the indicated concentrations of β-estradiol in the presence of the wild type or mutant GAL4·ER·VP16(F442P) receptors indicated. β-Galactosidase activities were measured and normalized to those obtained in the presence of the empty vector pRS414 (defined as 1.00 in the first column). Each value is derived from six independent measurements. WT, wild type. Open table in a new tab A β-galactosidase reporter gene driven by LexA·ER·VP16 via eight LexA binding sites was induced with the indicated concentrations of β-estradiol in the presence of the wild type or mutant GAL4·ER·VP16(F442P) receptors indicated. β-Galactosidase activities were measured and normalized to those obtained in the presence of the empty vector pRS414 (defined as 1.00 in the first column). Each value is derived from six independent measurements. WT, wild type. When GAL4·ER·VP16(F442P) harboring either the L539A/L540A or M543A/L544A mutation were assayed for transcriptional activity using the UAS17-lacZ reporter, both were found to be completely inactive (Fig. 1). The L539A/L540A and M543A/L544A mutations also result in nearly complete inactivation of GAL4·ER·VP16 (i.e. with completely active VP16) (Fig. 1 and data not shown). The data of Table II suggest that the mutated proteins were expressed at levels comparable to the parent GAL4·ER·VP16(F442P). To provide further evidence for their expression and to show that the AF-2 mutants were capable of binding to a GAL4 binding site, we examined the ability of unliganded GAL4·ER·VP16, GAL4·ER·VP16(F442P), and the AF-2 mutants derived from the latter to interfere with transcriptional activation by native GAL4 in cells grown in galactose-containing media (Fig.4). Both unliganded mutant and wild-type receptors interfered with activation by GAL4, indicating that they occupy the UAS17 to similar extents. As a control, we examined transcription of a LexA-lacZ reporter by a fusion protein containing the LexA DNA-binding domain and the GAL4 activation domain and found that transcription was unaffected by the presence of unliganded GAL4·ER·VP16 (data not shown). Thus, even in the context of a heterologous activation domain [VP16 or VP16(F442P)], the chimeric receptor requires an active AF-2 function to activate transcription. We next assessed the effect of the AF-2 mutation on the ability of the chimeric activator to remodel chromatin. In contrast to GAL4·ER·VP16(F442P), GAL4·ER(L539A;L540A)·VP16(F442P) does not alter the MNase cleavage pattern of TALS chromatin upon addition of β-estradiol (Fig. 2). Consistent with this result, the distribution of supercoiled TALS topoisomers is not affected by hormone induction in the presence of the AF-2 mutants (Fig. 3, lanes 3and 4; Table I). We conclude that the AF-2 mutations, which do not affect DNA binding or hormone binding (13Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), abolish the ability of GAL4·ER·VP16(F442P) both to activate transcription and to remodel chromatin. To investigate the effect of a non-activating GAL4·ER·VP16 derivative with an intact regulatory (ER) domain, we excised the VP16 moiety to recover GAL4·ER. GAL4·ER is unable to activate transcription from the UAS17-lacZ reporter in our assay (Fig. 1 and Ref. 17Stafford G.A. Morse R.H. J. Biol.

The differentiation and maintenance of phenotype in eukaryotic cells depends on the regulated expression of selected genes, most of which relies on interaction of specific regulatory protein(s) (transcription factor) and its cognate cis-acting DNA elements including a promoter and enhancer(s). A cis-acting element has been shown to be involved in the control of the expression of pancreas-specific genes, such as mouse α-amylase 2, elastase 2, trypsin, rat elastase I, and chymotrypsin B.

Thus, the expression of pancreas-specific secretory proteins in acinar cells has been thought to employ essentially the same cis-acting regulatory elements. Pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI), consisting of 56 amino acids (molecular mass 6.2 kDa) (12Greene L.J. Pubols M.H. Bartelt D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), was first isolated from bovine pancreas in 1948 by Kazal et al. (13Kazal L.A. Spicer D.S. Brahinski R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1948; 70: 3034-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and has been thought to be the cognate inactivation factor for preventing intra-pancreatic trypsin activity. In mammals, it is secreted from pancreatic acinar cells into the pancreatic juice, and naturally, this gene expression control was expected to involve the pancreas-specific common cis-acting regulatory sequence. However, the structure of the genomic PSTI gene, as determined by Horii et al. (14Horii A. Kobayashi T. Tomita N. Yamamoto T. Fukushige S. Murotsu T. Ogawa M. Mori T. Matsubara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), has neither the consensus sequence nor the typical TATA nor CAAT promoter sequence. Therefore, we initiated an analysis of the 5′-sequences flanking the human PSTI gene for identifying the cis-acting elements involved in this pancreas-specific expression through deletion studies and protein binding studies. We show here that the PSTI gene expression control involves two novel 5′ cis-acting elements defined by their effect on transcription and their interaction with a protein(s) from pancreatic cells. In addition, competition binding assays showed that one of the core sequences of the two elements is CAATCAATAAC, which is unique and can interact with another protein(s) from nonpancreatic cells; this interaction is likely to repress the expression of PSTI gene in nonpancreatic cells. These results suggest that this unique sequence (CAATCAATAAC) functions as a positively acting element in pancreatic cells and a negatively acting element in nonpancreatic cells in the control of the expression of the human PSTI gene. A 27-kbp human PSTI genomic DNA that contains 8.3 kbp of the 5′-flanking sequence has been cloned into pWE16 by Horii et al. (14Horii A. Kobayashi T. Tomita N. Yamamoto T. Fukushige S. Murotsu T.

The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 500 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C under a 5% CO2atmosphere. The XC cells were similarly cultured, except for supplementation with 1% nonessential amino acids. We constructed a reporter plasmid carrying the control region of the PSTI gene linked to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) as follows. The CAT coding fragment was excised from PSV2CAT (21Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar) using HindIII and DraII and inserted into Bluescript II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to make pBS0CAT. PSTI(AccI)CAT (22Yasuda T. Ogawa M. Murata A. Ohmachi Y. Yasuda T. Mori T. Matsubara K. Gene. 1993; 131: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which carries a fragment containing from about −4.8 kbp to −1 bp of the 5′-flanking region of the human PSTI gene, served as the parental plasmid for the following clones. PSTI(1.0)CAT, PSTI(320)CAT, PSTI(179)CAT, PSTI(134)CAT, PSTI(77)CAT, and PSTI(34)CAT, containing the nucleotides −1 to about −1.0 kbp, −320, −179, −134, −77, and −34, respectively, were constructed by exonuclease III digestion from the AccI restriction site of PSTI(AccI)CAT. Other 5′-deletion clones, PSTI(245)CAT, PSTI(159)CAT, PSTI(141)CAT, PSTI(115)CAT, and PSTI(98)CAT, were constructed by inserting polymerase chain reaction products from −245, −159, −141, −115, and −98 to −1, respectively, into pBS0CAT as follows. SacI andSmaI restriction sites were linked at the 5′ termini of forward and reverse primers for polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Each fragment amplified with these primers was inserted into the SacI-SmaI restriction site of pBS0CAT after digestion with SacI and SmaI. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The polymerase chain reaction forward primer sequences were 5′-CGAGCTCGCCTGACAGAATCTTTGCCTTGC for PSTI(245)CAT, 5′-CGAGCTCGGACACAGAGTCAATCAATAACCAG for PSTI(159)CAT, 5′-CGAGCTCGAACCAGGGAGATCTGTGATATAGC for PSTI(141)CAT, 5′-CGAGCTCGAGTAGGTGGGGCCTTGCTGCC for PSTI(115)CAT, and 5′-CGAGCTCGTGCCATCTGCCATATGACCCTTC for PSTI(98)CAT. We used one reverse primer: 5′-ATCGAATTCCTGCAGCCCGGGCTGAAGTTCTG. PSTIdel(103-78)CAT was constructed as follows. The −159/−104 and the −77/−1 fragments of the 5′-flanking region of human PSTI gene were produced by polymerase chain reaction. A BamHI restriction site was linked at the 5′ terminus of the reverse primer for the −159/−104 fragment and the forward primer for the −77/−1 fragment. These fragments were ligated at BamHI sites. In addition,XbaI and SmaI restriction sites were linked at the 5′ terminus of the forward primer for the −159/−104 fragment and the reverse primer for the −77/−1 fragment. The fragment ligated atBamHI was inserted in between XbaI andSmaI of pBS0CAT. The forward primer sequence for the −159/−104 fragment was the same as that for PSTI(159)CAT, and the reverse primer was 5′-CGGGATCCCGGCCCCACCTACTGGGCTATA. The forward primer sequence for the −77/−1 fragment was 5′-CGGGATCCCGTCCAGTCCCAGGCTTCTGAA, and the reverse primer was the same as that for PSTI(159)CAT. RSV CAT was constructed by inserting 524 bp of the Rous sarcoma virus 3′ long terminal repeat, substituting for the fragment between theAccI and HindIII sites of PSV0CAT (23Gorman C.M. Merlino G.T.

AR42j cells (2.5 ml of 5 × 105 cells/ml) were plated in 6-cm diameter dishes 24 h before transfection. Four μg of CAT reporter plasmid and 2.5 μg of pCH110, a lacZ expression plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were cotransfected by liposome-mediated transfection (24Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Eighteen h later, the cells were washed twice and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Sixty h later, the cells were collected, and CAT activity was assayed according to the procedure of Gorman et al. (21Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture containing 70 μl of 100 μl of AR42j cell extract, 10 μl of acetyl CoA, and 1 μl of [14C]chloramphenicol was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, then another 10 μl of acetyl CoA was added, and the mixture was incubated for a further 10 h. XC and RAT2 cells (2.5 ml of 1 × 105 cells/ml) were plated in 6-cm diameter dishes 12 h before transfection. One and a half μg of CAT reporter plasmid and 2.5 μg of pCH110 (25Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) were cotransfected in triplicate by 5 and 10 μl of Lipofectin for 18 h in XC and RAT2 cells, respectively. Forty h after transfection, the cells were similarly assayed, except that 60 μl of cell extracts was incubated with 4 μl of acetyl CoA and 2 μl of [14C]chloramphenicol at 37 °C. Another 1 μl of acetyl CoA was added after 2 h, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 2 h. The conversion ratio of [14C]chloramphenicol was measured with an image analyzer (BAS2000; Fujix, Tokyo, Japan) and normalized by β-galactosidase activity (25Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Crude nuclear extracts from AR42j and XC cells were prepared essentially as described by Dignamet al. (26Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar). All steps were performed at 4 °C. The cells (3 to 5 × 108) were collected from monolayer cultures, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 700 × g. The cell pellets were resuspended in washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 8 mmMgCl2) to a final volume of 5 times that of the packed cells. The cells were precipitated by centrifugation for 5 min at 700 × g and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), to a final volume of 3 times that of the original packed cells and were allowed to swell for 10 min on ice. The swollen cells were transferred to a glass Dounce homogenizer and disrupted slowly by 20 strokes. The nuclei were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 700 × g. The nuclear pellets were resuspended in an equal volume of extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 500 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1.3 μg/ml spermidine), stirred gently for 1 h, then precipitated by centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 30 min in a swing-out rotor. The supernatant was collected as the nuclear extract and dialyzed against binding buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF) for 12 h. After the pellets were removed by centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was collected as the nuclear extract, concentrated with polyethylene glycol 20000 to 5 mg/ml, and stored at −80 °C. A probe containing the nucleotides −179 to −1 of the human PSTI gene was excised from PSTI(179)CAT by digestion with HindIII (for a coding strand) or BssHII (a noncoding strand), end-labeled with [α32P]dCTP by the Klenow fragment, then digested again with BssHII or HindIII. The single end-labeled DNA probe was run in a 5% polyacrylamide gel, and the band was eluted by the crush and soak method described by Maxam and Gilbert (27Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (5386) Google Scholar). The end-labeled fragment (3 fmol; specific activity, 3 × 105 cpm) was incubated with 20 ng of nuclear protein for 30 min at room temperature in a volume of 50 μl in the presence of 12 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 0.12 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 12% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF with 1 or 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). The MgCl2 concentration was raised to 3 mm, DNase I was added to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml, and the mixture was digested for 1 min at room temperature. Digestion was terminated by stop buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 25 μg/ml calf thymus DNA). Samples were digested with 50 μg/ml proteinase K for 30 min at 37 °C and extracted with phenol/chloroform; nucleic acids were then precipitated with ethanol. DNase I-resistant material was dissolved in 6 μl of sequencing dye and analyzed on 6% sequencing gels after heating at 90 °C for 5 min. The dried gel was autoradiographed at −70 °C. Nucleotide sequence markers (G + A) were prepared by the Maxam-Gilbert reaction (27Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (5386) Google Scholar). Wild-type and individual 10-bp substitution mutant probes (−161/−116) were prepared as follows. Oligonucleotides (33-mer) were synthesized from the 5′-end of coding and noncoding strands, using a DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA). Labeled double-stranded DNA probes were formed by annealing these synthesized oligonucleotides in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and 5 mm MgCl2, then filling in the 3′-recessed termini using Sequenase (Sequenase® Ver 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) in the presence of 1 mm dNTP and [α32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol). The products were purified by electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide gel. Wild-type and individual 10-bp substitution mutant probes (−103/−74) were prepared as follows. Oligonucleotides of coding and noncoding strands were synthesized and then end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) using bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase. Double-stranded DNA probes were formed by annealing as described above. The PTF1 binding sequence probes of mouse α-amylase (−158/−122) and trypsina (-128/-96) genes (5Cockell M. Stevenson B.J. Strubin M. Hagenbüchle O. Wellauer P.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2464-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) were prepared by annealing each pair of synthesized complementary oligonucleotides. The labeled probe (specific activity: 15,000 cpm) and 10 μg of crude nuclear extract containing 4 μg of poly(dI-dC) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 22 μl of binding buffer (12 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 0.12 mm EDTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 12% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF) in the presence of 4 μg of poly(dI-dC). The DNA-protein complex was resolved by electrophoresis in a 4% polyacrylamide gel using 0.5 × Tris borate/EDTA buffer at constant current of 25 mA at 4 °C after a pre-run at a constant voltage of 150 V for 90 min. The dried gel was autoradiographed at −70 °C. Transgenic mice were prepared by introducing a human PSTI gene containing the 8.3 kbp of the 5′-flanking sequence (Fig. 1 A). One line that contains the full-length of the introduced DNA was named 11–4L. Along with this line, we obtained lines 12 and 24 that had integrated truncated sequences, 4.5 and 1.0 kbp respectively, in the 5′-flanking region. The DNA integrated in these animals are shown in Fig.1 B. Aside from the truncation in the distal portion of the 5′ region, the other regions of the gene were intact. The human PSTI gene, as examined by Northern blots, was expressed in the pancreas of the three transgenic mouse lines despite the differences in the 5′-flanking region. The 11–4L mice, which had integrated the intact DNA, expressed the PSTI gene at an extremely high level in the pancreas (Fig. 1 C). The low level expression detected in the stomach, kidney, and lung reflected that seen in human orgens (28Matsuda K. Ogawa M. Murata A. Kitahara T. Kosaki G. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1983; 40: 301-305PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). With the mouse lines 12 and 24, the expression of this gene, whose levels were lower than that of 11–4L, was detected only in the pancreas (Fig. 1 C and 1 D). These data show that the human PSTI gene expression is regulated in the mouse pancreas at the transcriptional level and that its control element(s) is conserved even in the line 24 mouse, which contains only 1.0 kbp of the 5′-flanking sequence hooked to the 7.5 kbp of the coding sequence followed by 11.2 kbp of the 3′-flanking sequence. The genes of pancreas secretory proteins such as amylase, trypsin, elastase I, and chymotrypsin have a similar cis-acting DNA element in the 5′-flanking region, and this sequence has been known to be responsible for their pancreas-specific expressions (1Walker M.D. Edlund T. Boulet A.M. Rutter W.J. Nature. 1983; 306: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 2Ornitz D.M. Palmiter R.D. Hammer R.E. Brinster R.L. Swift G.H. MacDonald R.J.

To see whether the 1.0-kbp 5′ sequence of human PSTI gene were able to drive expression of a reporter gene, as shown in the transgenic mouse line 24 (Fig.1 D), a construct of PSTI(1.0)CAT was made in promoterless plasmid pBS0CAT vector with 1.0 kbp of the 5′ sequence from genomic fragment of the PSTI gene. The AR42j cell line (a rat pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma) expressing amylase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin genes (29Stratowa C. Rutter W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4292-4296Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was confirmed to be able to express RNAs for rat PSTI gene before transfection studies (data not shown). PSTI(1.0)CAT showed preferential expression in AR42j cells, as shown in TableI. The promoterless pBS0CAT was used as a negative control, and the CAT activities were normalized to the activity of Rous sarcoma virus CAT (RSVCAT) directed by the Rous sarcoma virus promoter to correct the differences in transfection efficiency. As controls, the same set of experiments was done with rat fibroblast cell lines XC and RAT2 not expressing the PSTI gene. As expected, Rous sarcoma virus CAT was highly expressed in all of these cell lines, and pBS0CAT showed the lack of expression in all of them. PSTI(1.0)CAT was active in AR42j cells but was inactive in XC and RAT2 cells. The cell-type specificity was 27-fold in AR42j. Thus, both the studies with transgenic mouse line 24 and this transfection study demonstrated the presence of the control region for the pancreas-specific expression of the human PSTI gene in the 1.0-kbp region of the 5′-flanking sequence.Table IRelative CAT activities directed by DNA containing the 5′-flanking sequence from human PSTI geneRelative CAT activityCell-type specificity (AR42j/XC)XCRAT2AR42jpBSOCAT0.240.320.180.75RSVCAT1001001001.0PSTI(1.0)CAT0.360.539.7527.1For each cell, activity is expressed as a percentage of the activity observed with Rous sarcoma virus CAT (RSVCAT).

Results represent averages of three independent determinations. AR42j is a rat pancreas acinar cell carcinoma cell line; XC and Rat2 are rat fibroblast cell lines. Cell-type specificity represents the CAT activity obtained in AR42j relative to that in XC. To examine the functionally significant sequences in the 5′-flanking region of the human PSTI gene, we constructed a set of deletion derivatives from PSTI(1.0)CAT by stepwise elimination of the 5′ border and transfected them into AR42j cells. The results are shown in Fig. 2. PSTI(320)CAT, which possesses 320 bp of the 5′-flanking sequence, showed activity identical to that of the starting plasmid (data not shown), demonstrating that the specific regulatory element(s) must be located downstream of the −320 site. Deletions extending to −159 showed no measurable effect (activity of around 80-fold that of the vector plasmid), whereas deletions that extended to −141 and −134 resulted in a significant reduction of activity. Thus, the 5′ border of the positively acting cis-element lies between −159 and −141. Upon further deletion to −115, the activity was restored (activity of about 70-fold), but this augmenting activity was negated when a region covering between −134 and −115 was added or a deletion extended further to −98. However, some weak activities (around 10-fold), which seem to be basal level activities, remained. These observations suggest that there is a negatively acting element within −134 and −115 and another positively acting element downstream of −115, the effect of which is eliminated with the −98 construct. Deletion to −77 resulted in a further loss of activity from 10- to 3-fold, and with the deletion extended to −34, the activity was completely eliminated. Thus, the loss of activities with −77 and −34 constructs can be regarded as the loss of an element regulating basal level activity and the promoter for transcription initiation, respectively, because the human PSTI gene lacks a CAAT box or TATA box and has multiple transcription start points (14Horii A. Kobayashi T. Tomita N. Yamamoto T. Fukushige S. Murotsu T. Ogawa M. Mori T. Matsubara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), but the major site for transcription is at −60 (16Tomita N. Horii A. Yamamoto T. Ogawa M. Mori T. Matsubara K. FEBS Lett. 1987; 225: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Altogether, these results suggest that the 5′ sequence downstream of −179 is crucial for human PSTI gene expression in AR42j cells and contains an upstream positively acting element followed (or overlapped) by a negatively acting element and then a downstream positively acting element and a basal activity-regulating element just in front of the promoter for transcription initiator. To examine trans-acting factors in the 5′ region of the human PSTI CAT genes, we carried out in vitroDNase 1 footprinting assays using nuclear extracts from the PSTI-expressing AR42j cells or nonexpressing XC cells. The assays were done with both coding and noncoding strands. With the coding strand, three protected regions appeared in a dose-dependent fashion in AR42j nuclear extracts (Fig.3 A) and one protected region appeared in XC nuclear extracts (Fig. 3 B): Region I (−161/−116), Region II (−103/−74), Region III (−65/−42) in AR42j, and Region IV (−154/−137) in XC. With the noncoding strand, the binding profile was similar with Regions I and IV but weak with Region II and none with Region III (Fig. 3 B). Comparing the protection profiles of AR42j and XC, both Regions I and II are AR42j-specific, and Region IV is XC-specific, because they show the cell-type-specific protection. Region III is also AR42j-specific but is likely to be the promoter region, judging from the results of the transfection assays and the transcription start point of the PST"

Products were obtained from two nonallelic <i>Xenopus</i> genes (xFEN-1a and xFEN-1b) that differ from each other by 4.5% in amino acid sequence. Both are 80% identical to mammalian FEN-1 proteins and 55% identical to the yeast homologues. When expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, the<i>Xenopus</i> enzymes showed flap endonuclease activity, a unique feature of this class of nucleases. In addition, expression from the<i>Xenopus</i> cDNAs complemented the temperature and methyl methanesulfonate sensitivity of a yeast <i>rad27</i> deletion, which eliminates the endogenous FEN-1 gene product. Antiserum raised against xFEN-1 was used to show that the protein accumulates during the middle and late stages of oogenesis, in parallel with other DNA metabolic activities, and that it is localized to the oocyte nucleus. Flap endonuclease activity was demonstrated in oocyte nuclear extracts, and this was inhibited by the anti-xFEN-1 antiserum. The antiserum did not inhibit the major oocyte 5′ → 3′ exonuclease activity. DNA synthesis in oocyte extracts was blocked by the antiserum, and the nature of this inhibition suggests that xFEN-1 may be part of a large complex of replication factors. Chromatographic evidence was obtained for the existence of a complex that forms during DNA synthesis and includes proliferating cell nuclear antigen in addition to xFEN-1. These observations support a critical role for xFEN-1 in DNA replication, but indicate that another enzyme must be responsible for the exonuclease function required for homologous recombination in<i>Xenopus</i> oocytes."

By using stable transfection of wild-type or cytoplasmic deletion mutants of LIFRα together with full-length gp130 into Ba/F3 cells, we found that cells expressing gp130 and an extensively deleted mutant LIFRα containing only the box-1 region were capable of proliferating in response to LIF, although LIF-dependent long term growth of these cells was seriously impaired. Using a similar strategy to generate WEHI-3BD+ cells expressing gp130 and wild-type or truncation mutants of LIFRα, studies revealed that the box-1 region of the LIFRα was also sufficient for LIF-dependent induction of different aspects of differentiation, including up-regulation of macrophage surface marker expression, morphological change, and cell migration in agar culture. However, the C-terminal region of the LIFRα, although not essential for intracellular signaling, was important for efficient receptor-mediated ligand internalization.

Recently, an alternative OSM receptor component (OSMR β-chain) was identified, which can form a unique functional receptor complex for OSM by heterodimerization with gp130 (17Mosley B. Imus C.D.

After ligand binding to the cell-surface receptor, LIFRα dimerizes with gp130, which results in tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of members of the Jak family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. The activated Jaks in turn phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domains of both gp130 and LIFRα, which leads to recruitment of substrates containing Src homology 2 domains (SH2-domain) and a cascade of downstream signal transduction events and eventually alteration in cellular behavior (12Kishimoto T.

In both rat and human hepatoma cells, transfection of LIFRα was able to activate cytokine-mediated transcription of acute-phase plasma protein genes in the context of LIFRα/gp130 heterodimer (26Baumann H. Ziegler S.F. Mosley B. Morella K. Pajovic S. Gearing D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8414-8417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Baumann H. Symes A.J. Comeau M.R. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Friend D. Ziegler S.F. Fink J.S. Gearing D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 138-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A mutant LIFRα lacking the cytoplasmic domain, when expressed in the same cell line, however, was inactive (26Baumann H. Ziegler S.F. Mosley B. Morella K. Pajovic S. Gearing D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8414-8417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The separate contribution of the LIFRα and gp130 cytoplasmic domains to LIF-induced signal transduction has been investigated using chimeric receptors in which the LIFRα cytoplasmic domain was connected to the extracellular domain of the G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR-LIFR). It was found that the G-CSFR-LIFRα chimeras when expressed in embryonic stem cells were capable of suppressing differentiation in the presence of G-CSF, independent of gp130 activation, but the same chimeric receptors when expressed in either Ba/F3 or M1 cells were unable to signal after G-CSF stimulation (28Starr R. Novak U. Willson T.A. Inglese M. Murphy V. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Ernst M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19982-19986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This suggests that, although the chimeric receptors were able to form homodimers driven by G-CSF binding, the signal transduction potential of the LIFRα cytoplasmic domain was dependent on the type of tissues or cells stimulated. In addition, analysis of deletion mutants of the cytoplasmic domain of the chimeric receptors (G-CSFR-LIFRα) has shown that the membrane-proximal region containing box-1, box-2, and box-3 of the LIFRα cytoplasmic domain is required for G-CSF-mediated transcriptional activation in both hepatoma and neuroblastoma cell lines (27Baumann H. Symes A.J. Comeau M.R. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Friend D. Ziegler S.F. Fink J.S. Gearing D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 138-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Studies of ligand-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling molecules in COS7 cells expressing chimeric receptors comprised of either wild-type or cytoplasmic deletion mutants of the LIFRα cytoplasmic domain and the extracellular and transmembrane regions of the epidermal growth factor receptor demonstrated that the membrane proximal region containing box-1 and box-2 was required for tyrosine phosphorylation of receptor components, Jak kinases, and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-3) (29Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). A similar region of the LIFRα cytoplasmic domain when expressed in hepatoma cells as a G-CSFR-LIFRα chimera was able to activate STAT3, STAT1, and STAT5b in both gp130-dependent and -independent receptor systems (30Kuropatwinski K.K. Imus C.D. Gearing D. Baumann H. Mosley B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15135-15144Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the cytoplasmic domain of the LIFRα plays a role in LIF-induced signal transduction although the contribution of each receptor component, LIFRα and gp130, might not be equivalent.Although activation of the Jak-STAT biochemical signaling pathway mapped to specific regions of the cytoplasmic domain of the LIFRα, there is very little known about the capacity of specific regions of the LIFRα cytoplasmic domain to mediate different types of biological activities, particularly in hemopoietic cells and in the context of a LIFRα/gp130 heterodimer. In the present study, we investigated the signal transduction capacity of the LIFRα cytoplasmic domain in LIF-induced cellular proliferation and differentiation in hemopoietic cells. We have defined the membrane proximal box-1 region in the LIFRα cytoplasmic domain as essential for LIF-dependent proliferation and differentiation in hemopoietic cells and the membrane-proximal box-1 and box-2 regions as being required for LIF-dependent long term cell survival, in the context of a heterodimer with gp130. The C-terminal membrane distal region of the LIFRα cytoplasmic domain, although not essential for altering cell behavior, was important for efficient receptor-mediated ligand internalization.DISCUSSIONUnlike the related cytokines IL-6 and IL-11 which utilize gp130 homodimerization for functional cell signaling, LIF, CNTF, OSM, and CT-1 utilize heterodimerization of gp130 and LIFR (24Hilton D.J. Hilton A.A. Raicevic A. Rakar S. Harrison-Smith M. Gough N.M. Begley C.G. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Willson T.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4765-4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 25Gearing D.P.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4855-4863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Indeed the stoichiometry of a solution complex of LIF, LIFR, and gp130 appears to be 1:1:1, suggesting that heterodimerization of the cytoplasmic domains of these two receptor subunits may be sufficient to initiate LIF signal transduction (50Zhang J.G. Owczarek C.M. Ward L.D. Howlett G.J. Fabri L.J. Roberts B.A. Nicola N.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, because of the ubiquity of expression of both gp130 and LIFRα and the requirement for receptor heterodimerization, it has been difficult to study the separate contribution of each receptor subunit to LIF signal transduction.Previous studies attempted to overcome these problems by generating receptor chimeras that contain a G-CSF receptor extracellular domain and a series of deletion mutants of the LIFRα cytoplasmic domain. In these experiments homodimerization of the LIFR cytoplasmic domains was driven by G-CSF-induced homodimerization of the extracellular domains. However, by using this system it was found that homodimerization of even full-length LIFRα cytoplasmic domain did not permit proliferative signaling in Ba/F3 cells or differentiative signaling in M1 myeloid leukemic cells, although it did permit signaling in embryonic stem cells (differentiation suppression) and in hepatic and neuronal cell lines (induction of gene expression) (25Gearing D.P.

In contrast, enforced homodimerization of gp130 cytoplasmic domains or activation of LIFRα/gp130 heterodimerization by LIF in each of these cell lines initiated appropriate functional signaling. These experiments suggest that analysis of the contribution of the LIFRα cytoplasmic domain to intracellular signaling is only meaningful in the context of a LIFRα/gp130 heterodimer.In the present study we have introduced the wild-type or mutants of LIFRα along with full-length gp130 into cell lines, which do not express endogenous LIFRα but are able to gain full responsiveness to LIF in terms of cell proliferation and cell survival (Ba/F3 cells) or cell differentiation (WEHI-3BD+ cells). This has allowed us to determine the contribution of different LIFRα cytoplasmic domains to LIF-induced functional signaling in the context of full-length gp130 in a heterodimeric complex.Ba/F3 cells that were stably transfected with a full-length gp130 cDNA along with wild-type or various mutants of LIFRα truncated up to a form containing only the box-1 of the LIFRα cytoplasmic domain acquired LIF-induced proliferative responsiveness, as determined by counting viable cell numbers or measuring DNA synthesis levels. However, LIF-dependent long term cell survival of transfected Ba/F3 cells required downstream regions including box-2. Similar results obtained in studies of GM-CSF-stimulated signal transduction indicated that the box-1 region of the cytoplasmic domain of the GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptor common β-chain is essential for GM-CSF-induced proliferative signaling in Ba/F3 and CTLL-2 cells (51Sakamaki K. Miyajima I. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3541-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), but downstream regions including box-2 were also important, particularly for GM-CSF-dependent long term proliferation and cell survival (46Smith A. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 52Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar).LIF-induced differentiation of M1 cells is characterized by the formation of dispersed colonies with profound clonal suppression of proliferative capacity in agar cultures (40Metcalf D. Leukemia (Balt.). 1989; 3: 349-355PubMed Google Scholar). Tomida (53Tomida M. Blood. 1995; 85: 217-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) had previously found that induction of differentiation by LIF in WEHI-3BD+ cells transfected with LIFRα cDNA was accompanied by suppression of cell proliferation, as determined by measuring their ability to reduce nitro blue tetrazolium. In the present study, LIF-induced differentiation was investigated in WEHI-3BD+ cells transfected with gp130 together with wild-type or mutant forms of LIFRα. In semi-solid agar culture, LIF-stimulated, transfected WEHI-3BD+ colonies were characterized by their large size, unreduced numbers, and a substantial halo of migrating cells, suggesting a differentiated phenotype accompanied by persistent proliferation (i.e. no clonal suppression). Previous studies (46Smith A. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) on GM-CSF-induced differentiation in myeloid leukemic cells (M1 and WEHI-3BD+ cells) revealed that distinct regions of the cytoplasmic domain of the common β-chain of GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptors are required for different signaling pathways, which cooperate to generate a fully differentiated phenotype characterized by the formation of dispersed colonies in agar as a measure of macrophage migratory activity, the induction of macrophage cell-surface marker expression, and morphological differentiation. Our results demonstrated that, in WEHI-3BD+ cells, the box-1 region of the LIFRα cytoplasmic domain was sufficient for LIF-dependent induction of most aspects of differentiation, including the up-regulation of macrophage surface marker expression, the morphological change of blast cells into macrophages, and cell migration in agar culture, indicating that differentiative signaling stimulated by LIF requires a smaller region of the LIFRα cytoplasmic domain than is required of the common β-chain of GM-CSF receptors for GM-CSF-induced differentiative signaling.It has been found previously that overexpression of dominant negative forms of STAT3 in M1 myeloid cells completely blocks terminal myeloid cell differentiation and growth arrest induced by LIF or IL-6 (54Minami M. Inoue M. Wei S. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3963-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The present study showed a tight correlation of the induction of STAT3 and STAT1 DNA binding activities with the induction of WEHI-3BD+ myeloid cell differentiation, indicating that the activation of both STAT3 and STAT1 might be involved in WEHI-3BD+ cell differentiation in response to LIF. The differences in LIF-induced myeloid differentiation between M1 cells (differentiation accompanied by clonal suppression) and WEHI-3BD+ cells (differentiation accompanied by persistent proliferation) suggest that other signaling pathway(s) may be required for continuous proliferation of WEHI-3BD+ cells during myeloid differentiation.Internalization of ligand-activated receptors is likely to be an important mechanism for achieving tight control of cellular growth. Internalized receptors may be recycled to the cell surface or may be targeted to lysosomes for degradation that is thought to attenuate growth factor-stimulated signaling. Most growth factor receptors are internalized much more effectively after activation by ligand binding, which is the first step in ligand-induced signal transduction, and are subsequently degraded to terminate signaling (55Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Fay F.S. Corvera S. Science. 1994; 263: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 56Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Corvera S. J. Biol.

Our results from the receptor-mediated 125I-hLIF internalization experiments with both hemopoietic cell lines demonstrated that, in the context of a heterodimer of LIFRα/gp130, the C-terminal region of the LIFRα cytoplasmic domain is important for efficient internalization of LIF-receptor complexes but not essential for LIF-induced cellular signaling in terms of proliferation and differentiation. This suggests that the C-terminal region of LIFRα contains motifs that provide docking sites to recruit proteins involved in receptor endocytosis which, however, are signal-independent. This is consistent with a finding recently made by Thiel et al. (60Thiel S. Behrmann I. Dittrich E. Muys L. Tavernier J. Wijdenes J. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that ligand-induced gp130 internalization does not require the activation of the Jak/STAT pathway, which plays an essential role in gp130-mediated signal transduction.In several cytokine and growth factor receptor cytoplasmic domains dileucine motifs have been implicated in receptor internalization, and these may constitutively signal or, more commonly for growth factor receptors, be activated by nearby phosphorylation on serine residues (61Geisler C.

Such a motif has been defined for gp130 and shown to be important for receptor internalization (62Dittrich E. Haft C.R. Muys L. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5487-5494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, in our studies gp130 contributed only about one-third to the internalization rate constant of bound LIF with LIFRα having a major contribution. The LIFRα does not contain a canonical dileucine internalization motif, but other cytokine receptors have been shown to mediate internalization by different mechanisms, including ubiquitination sites (63Govers R. van Kerkhof P. Schwartz A.L. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16426-16433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and tyrosine-based motifs (61Geisler C. Dietrich J. Nielsen B.L.

Supino-Rosin L. Yoshimura A. Watowich S.S. Neumann D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 65Subtil A. Dautry-Varsat A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The human LIFRα contains only one tyrosine in the critical region required for internalization (YRPQ), but it remains to be determined if this motif contributes to receptor internalization.The results indicated that in the context of heterodimerization with gp130, only the box-1 region of the LIFRα cytoplasmic domain was essential for cell proliferation and for the induction of the differentiated phenotype. However, downstream regions were required for long term cell survival (to box-2) and for efficient receptor-mediated LIF internalization in both cell types (C-terminal region of the LIFRα). These data are in partial disagreement with Baumann et al. (27Baumann H. Symes A.J. Comeau M.R. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Friend D. Ziegler S.F. Fink J.S. Gearing D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 138-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who found that, using enforced LIFRα homodimers, box-1, box-2, and box-3 (150 amino acid residues in the LIFRα cytoplasmic domain) were all needed for transcriptional activation of a reporter gene in hepatic and neuronal cells. These differences could be due to cell line differences or analysis of different functions or, more likely, to the analysis of LIFRα homodimers rather than heterodimers. The correlation of LIF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of LIFRα and gp130 and the activation of STAT3 and STAT1 with cell proliferation and differentiation functions in response to LIF suggests that, in the context of LIFRα/gp130 heterodimers, the truncated LIFR(34) was able to interact with Jak(s) that could be activated by ligand-induced receptor heterodimerization and phosphorylate tyrosine residues of gp130 as well as LIFRα. The full-length gp130 cytoplasmic domain, when phosphorylated, may provide docking sites for signaling molecules (such as STAT3), initiating the gp130-mediated cellular functions.Despite the dominance of the box-1 region of the LIFRα for LIF-induced signaling, we did obtain evidence that other regions of the LIFRα cytoplasmic domain are needed for different functions (cell survival and receptor internalization). This is consistent with studies on other hemopoietic receptor cytoplasmic domains that have revealed a modular design in intracellular signaling pathways (12Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T.
