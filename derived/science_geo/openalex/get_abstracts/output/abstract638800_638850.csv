https://openalex.org/W2970433948,"A synthetic history of human land use Humans began to leave lasting impacts on Earth's surface starting 10,000 to 8000 years ago. Through a synthetic collaboration with archaeologists around the globe, Stephens et al. compiled a comprehensive picture of the trajectory of human land use worldwide during the Holocene (see the Perspective by Roberts). Hunter-gatherers, farmers, and pastoralists transformed the face of Earth earlier and to a greater extent than has been widely appreciated, a transformation that was essentially global by 3000 years before the present.

Previous searches for the specific genes involved have been underpowered and thus unable to detect genetic signals. Ganna et al. perform a genome-wide association study on 493,001 participants from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Sweden to study genes associated with sexual orientation (see the Perspective by Mills). They find multiple loci implicated in same-sex sexual behavior indicating that, like other behavioral traits, nonheterosexual behavior is polygenic.

MAIT cells recognize microbial small molecules presented by the major histocompatibility complex class Ib molecule MR1. MAIT cells are absent in germ-free mice, and the mechanisms by which microbiota control MAIT cell development are unknown (see the Perspective by Oh and Unutmaz). Legoux et al. show that, in mice, development of MAIT cells within the thymus is governed by the bacterial product 5-(2-oxopropylideneamino)-6- d -ribitylaminouracil, which rapidly traffics from the mucosa to the thymus, where it is captured by MR1 and presented to developing MAIT cells. Constantinides et al. report that MAIT cell induction only occurs during a limited, early-life window and requires exposure to defined microbes that produce riboflavin derivatives. Continual interactions between MAIT cells and commensals in the skin modulates tissue repair functions. Together, these papers highlight how the microbiota can direct immune cell development and subsequent function at mucosal sites by secreting compounds that act like self-antigens.

https://openalex.org/W2970702579,"Displacing OH groups catalytically The Mitsunobu reaction is widely used to invert the configuration of alcohols. However, its major drawback is the need to activate the alcohol with a full equivalent of phosphine, thereby generating a phosphine oxide co-product. Beddoe et al. report a phosphine oxide compound that achieves the same result catalytically (see the Perspective by Longwitz and Werner). The key is a phenol substituent that can reversibly bond through its oxygen to phosphorus, forming a ring that the alcohol opens. The phosphorus thus remains in the +5 oxidation state throughout the reaction, and water is the only by-product. Science , this issue p. 910 ; see also p. 866"
https://openalex.org/W2969967332,"Neural computation involves diverse types of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons that are integrated with excitatory (E) neurons into precisely structured circuits. To understand how each neuron type shapes sensory representations, we measured firing patterns of defined types of neurons in the barrel cortex while mice performed an active, whisker-dependent object localization task. Touch excited fast-spiking (FS) interneurons at short latency, followed by activation of E neurons and somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons. Touch only weakly modulated vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing (VIP) interneurons. Voluntary whisker movement activated FS neurons in the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) target layers, a subset of SST neurons and a majority of VIP neurons. Together, FS neurons track thalamic input, mediating feedforward inhibition. SST neurons monitor local excitation, providing feedback inhibition. VIP neurons are activated by non-sensory inputs, disinhibiting E and FS neurons. Our data reveal rules of recruitment for interneuron types during behavior, providing foundations for understanding computation in cortical microcircuits."
https://openalex.org/W3098529725,"Electron energy bands of crystalline solids generically exhibit degeneracies called band-structure nodes. Here, we introduce non-Abelian topological charges that characterize line nodes inside the momentum space of crystalline metals with space-time inversion ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry and with weak spinorbit coupling. We show that these are quaternion charges, similar to those describing disclinations in biaxial nematics. Starting from two-band considerations, we develop the complete many-band description of nodes in the presence of $\mathcal{PT}$ and mirror symmetries, which allows us to investigate the topological stability of nodal chains in metals. The non-Abelian charges put strict constraints on the possible nodal-line configurations. Our analysis goes beyond the standard approach to band topology and implies the existence of one-dimensional topological phases not present in existing classifications."

It is thought that CDW competes with superconductivity, but whether it has bearing on the mechanism of superconductivity remains unclear. Arpaia et al. undertook a comprehensive study of charge density fluctuations in a cuprate family, varying doping and temperature. They found that short-range dynamic charge fluctuations were present in a large portion of the phase diagram, at temperatures considerably higher than those at which the CDW order disappears.

https://openalex.org/W3100624638,"Filling a dating hole The periodic nature of Earth's orbit around the Sun produces cycles of insolation reflected in climate records. Conversely, these climate records can be used to infer changes in the dynamics of the Solar System, which is inherently chaotic and not always similarly periodic. A particular obstacle is the lack of well-defined planetary orbital constraints between 50 and 60 million years ago. Zeebe and Lourens found an astronomical solution for that interval showing that the Solar System experienced a specific resonance transition pattern. These data provide a measure of the duration of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. Science , this issue p. 926"

After formation of Earth's iron core, the mantle became several orders of magnitude more oxidized. Armstrong et al. conducted a set of experiments looking at the redox state of silicate melt representative of Earth's early magma oceans. They found that at some depth, iron oxide disproportionates into iron(III) oxide and metallic iron. The reduced iron sinks to the core, leaving an oxidized rocky mantle that emits carbon dioxide and water instead of more reduced species. Science , this issue p. 903"
https://openalex.org/W2970332547,"Actin, spectrin, and related molecules form a membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS) in neurons. The function of the MPS, however, remains poorly understood. Using super-resolution imaging, we observed that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and related signaling molecules were recruited to the MPS in response to extracellular stimuli, resulting in colocalization of these molecules and RTK transactivation by GPCRs and CAMs, giving rise to extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. Disruption of the MPS prevented such molecular colocalizations and downstream ERK signaling. ERK signaling in turn caused calpain-dependent MPS degradation, providing a negative feedback that modulates signaling strength. These results reveal an important functional role of the MPS and establish it as a dynamically regulated platform for GPCR- and CAM-mediated RTK signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2970561844,"Making males in a fruit fly pest The Mediterranean fruit fly or Medfly ( Ceratitis capitata ) is a global and highly destructive fruit pest. Meccariello et al. identified the master gene for male sex determination on the Y chromosome of Medfly and named it Maleness-on-the-Y ( MoY ) (see the Perspective by Makki and Meller). Flies of each sex were transformed into the other sex by genetic manipulation, and crosses of transformed files generated male and female progeny. MoY is functionally conserved in the olive fruit fly and in the invasive oriental fruit fly. This discovery has potential for insect genetic control based on mass release of sterile males and future strategies based on gene drive. Science , this issue p. 1457 ; see also p. 1380"
https://openalex.org/W2970919192,"The requirement for next-generation antimalarials to be both curative and transmission-blocking necessitates the identification of previously undiscovered druggable molecular pathways. We identified a selective inhibitor of the Plasmodium falciparum protein kinase PfCLK3, which we used in combination with chemogenetics to validate PfCLK3 as a drug target acting at multiple parasite life stages. Consistent with a role for PfCLK3 in RNA splicing, inhibition resulted in the down-regulation of more than 400 essential parasite genes. Inhibition of PfCLK3 mediated rapid killing of asexual liver- and blood-stage P. falciparum and blockade of gametocyte development, thereby preventing transmission, and also showed parasiticidal activity against P. berghei and P. knowlesi Hence, our data establish PfCLK3 as a target for drugs, with the potential to offer a cure-to be prophylactic and transmission blocking in malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2971131590,"Introduction Dietary diversity score (DDS) is a proxy indicator for measuring nutrient adequacy. In this study, we aimed to identify the nutritional statuses and current patterns of DDS among children between 6–59 months old and their associations with different individual and household level factors in rural Bangladesh. Methods The Nobokoli programme of World Vision Bangladesh was implemented in Mymensingh, Sherpur, Rangpur, Dinajpur, Thakurgaon, Panchagar, and Nilphamari districts of Bangladesh between 2014 and 2017. A cross-sectional community household survey was administered between July and October 2014 to collect baseline data to evaluate the Nobokoli programme. A total of 6,468 children between 6–59 months old were included in the final analysis. Anthropometric data was collected following WHO guidelines on using wooden height and digital weight scales. We collected food intake information for the past 24 hours of the survey. The WHO’s child growth standard medians were used to identify the nutritional indices of stunting, wasting, and underweight. Food items consumed were categorized into nine food groups and the DDS was constructed by counting the consumption of food items across these groups during the preceding 24 hour period. The association of DDS and nutritional status (stunting, wasting and underweight) with sociodemographic factors and household food security status were examined using multivariable models; linear regression and logistics regression respectively. Results The prevalence of stunting, wasting and underweight among children aged 6-59months were 36.8%, 18.2% and 37.7% respectively. Our findings revealed that almost all children ate any form of starch followed by consumption of milk or milk products (76%) and fleshy meat /fish (61%) respectively. The mean DDS among children was 3.93(sd 1.47). Forty percent of the children obtained a DDS score less than 4. Multivariable analysis suggested that children whose mothers had higher educational attainment and are skilled workers had higher DDS (15% and 48% respectively) compared to their counterparts. The DDS showed strong positive association with household wealth status. Children from food secure households had 26% higher DDS compared to children from food insecure households. Similarly, increasing maternal education and household wealth were found to be protective against childhood stunting and undernutrition. Discussion Our findings reiterate the need for improving household socioeconomic factors and household food security status for improving dietary diversity practices and nutritional status of children. Evidence-based solutions are needed to be implemented and expanded at scale to ensure appropriate dietary practices and improve nutritional status of the children in local context."

Wang et al. created a method to fragment the E. coli genome into independent chromosomes that can be modified, rearranged, and recombined. The efficient fission of the unmodified E. coli genome into two defined, stable pairs of synthetic chromosomes provides common intermediates for large-scale genome manipulations such as inversion and translocation. Fusion of synthetic chromosomes from distinct cells generated a single genome in a target cell. Precise, rapid, large-scale genome engineering operations are useful tools for creating diverse synthetic genomes. Science , this issue p. 922"
https://openalex.org/W2970257627,"Many different treatments may affect the serum lipid profiles of breast cancer patients. This study analyzed serum lipid levels at different periods during treatment to observe the changes in lipid profiles during and after chemotherapy and to compare the different effects of different chemotherapy regimens on serum lipid profiles. A total of 805 patients were included in this study. We measured the lipid profiles of patients who received surgery without chemotherapy prior to the operation and at 3, 6 and 12 months after operation. In addition, in patients who underwent chemotherapy, the lipid profiles were measured prior to chemotherapy, prior to the last cycle of chemotherapy and 6 months after chemotherapy. Lipid profile measurements included total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), homocysteine (HCY), and uric acid (UA). (Neo)Adjuvant chemotherapy exerted an adverse temporary effect on lipid levels (manifested as increased TG and LDL-C levels, and decreased HDL-C levels, particularly in the adjuvant chemotherapy group) during the chemotherapy periods. However, this influence was not sustained, as the lipid profiles levels were generally restored to baseline levels 6 months after chemotherapy completion. Different age groups showed different changes in lipid levels that were influenced by chemotherapy. The younger group (20–40 years old) showed a greater increase in TC and LDL-C levels during chemotherapy than the 41-65-year-old group. Chemotherapy exerts an adverse temporary effect, and the effects of different regimens on lipid levels are similar. Furthermore, lipid profiles in younger women may be more sensitive to chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2970888915,"Background Although eating difficulties are known to be common in children on the autism spectrum, there is a lack of research on whether these behaviours persist or change into adulthood. Emerging evidence suggests that autistic adults may experience higher levels of disordered eating than the general population, indicating the impact of autism on eating in this adult population warrants further exploration. Method This study interviewed 12 autistic adults about their eating habits, with a focus on the continuing or changing presence of behaviours often seen in autistic children such as sensory sensitivity or a preference for routines. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. Results Overall, participants suggested that autism did continue to impact their eating into adulthood, particularly in the areas of sensory sensitivity, medical difficulties, executive functioning difficulties, and rigidity, but that they had learned to adapt so that these issues no longer represented a problem. However, a minority of participants did feel that their autism had a negative effect on their eating, particularly those diagnosed with eating disorders. Additionally, eating behaviours associated with autism were identified as potentially contributing to having an unhealthy body weight. Conclusions Certain traits associated with autism, such as cognitive rigidity and sensory sensitivity, could potentially continue to influence the eating behaviours of autistic adults. These traits are typically experienced as differences which can be adapted around and managed, rather than specific problems. However, these traits can potentially contribute to difficulties such as disordered eating and weight gain, and the implications of these should be explored by future research."
https://openalex.org/W2971222846,"Carrion resources sustain a complex and diverse community of both vertebrate and invertebrate scavengers, either obligate or facultative. However, although carrion ecology has received increasing scientific attention in recent years, our understanding of carrion partitioning in natural conditions is severely limited as most studies are restricted either to the vertebrate or the insect scavenger communities. Moreover, carnivore carcasses have been traditionally neglected as study model. Here, we provide the first data on the partitioning between vertebrate and invertebrate scavengers of medium-sized carnivore carcasses, red fox (Vulpes vulpes (Linnaeus)), in two mountainous Mediterranean areas of south-eastern Spain. Carcasses were visited by several mammalian and avian scavengers, but only one carcass was partially consumed by golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos (Linnaeus). These results provide additional support to the carnivore carrion-avoidance hypothesis, which suggests that mammalian carnivores avoid the consumption of carnivore carcasses to prevent disease transmission risk. In turn, the absence of vertebrate scavengers at carnivore carcasses enabled a diverse and well-structured successional community of insects to colonise the carcasses. The observed richness and abundance of the most frequent families was more influenced by the decomposition time than by the study area. Overall, our study encourages further research on carrion resource partitioning in natural conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2971096236,"Diet is a primary driver of the composition of gut microbiota and is considered one of the main routes of microbial colonization. Prey identification is fundamental for correlating the diet with the presence of particular microbial groups. The present study examined how diet influenced the composition and function of the gut microbiota of the Pacific harbor seal (Phoca vitulina richardii) in order to better understand the role of prey consumption in shaping its microbiota. This species is a good indicator of the quality of the local environment due to both its foraging and haul-out site fidelity. DNA was extracted from 20 fecal samples collected from five harbor seal colonies located in Baja California, Mexico. The V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using the Illumina technology. Results showed that the gut microbiota of the harbor seals was dominated by the phyla Firmicutes (37%), Bacteroidetes (26%) and Fusobacteria (26%) and revealed significant differences in its composition among the colonies. Funtional analysis using the PICRUSt software suggests a high number of pathways involved in the basal metabolism, such as those for carbohydrates (22%) and amino acids (20%), and those related to the degradation of persistent environmental pollutants. In addition, a DNA metabarcoding analysis of the same samples, via the amplification and sequencing of the mtRNA 16S and rRNA 18S genes, was used to identify the prey consumed by harbor seals revealing the consumption of prey with mainly demersal habits. Functional redundancy in the seal gut microbiota was observed, irrespective of diet or location. Our results indicate that the frequency of occurrence of specific prey in the harbor seal diet plays an important role in shaping the composition of the gut microbiota of harbor seals by influencing the relative abundance of specific groups of gut microorganisms. A significant relationship was found among diet, gut microbiota composition and OTUs assigned to a particular metabolic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2970240009,"Membrane proteins can associate into larger complexes. Examples include receptor tyrosine complexes, ion channels, transporters, and G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs). For the latter, there is abundant evidence indicating that GPCRs assemble into complexes, through both homo- and heterodimerization. However, the tools for studying and disrupting these complexes, GPCR or otherwise, are limited. Here, we have developed stabilized interference peptides for this purpose. We have previously reported that tetrahydrocannabinol-mediated cognitive impairment arises from homo- or heterooligomerization between the GPCRs cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) and 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT2AR) receptors. Here, to disrupt this interaction through targeting CB1–5-HT2A receptor heteromers in HEK293 cells and using an array of biochemical techniques, including calcium and cAMP measurements, bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, and CD-based helicity assessments, we developed a NanoLuc binary technology (NanoBiT)-based reporter assay to screen a small library of aryl-carbon–stapled transmembrane-mimicking peptides produced by solid-phase peptide synthesis. We found that these stapling peptides have increased α-helicity and improved proteolytic resistance without any loss of disrupting activity in vitro, suggesting that this approach may also have utility in vivo. In summary, our results provide proof of concept for using NanoBiT to study membrane protein complexes and for stabilizing disrupting peptides to target such membrane complexes through hydrocarbon-mediated stapling.

In cases where heteromer disruption might serve a therapeutic purpose, it would be advantageous to translate TM peptides not only as tools, but into druglike entities. Peptides in general are considered poor druglike molecules, although this view is changing. Efficacy is often compromised in vivo due to a loss of secondary structure; cellular uptake is poor, and finally peptides are highly susceptible to proteolysis. Stapling of the peptide backbone can help to overcome these limitations; the bioactive conformation of the peptide is maintained, and careful positioning and choice of staple can result in a high-affinity binder with improved cellular uptake and stability. Stapled peptides therefore represent an attractive approach to developing more druglike peptides. For a recent review on stapled peptides, see Ali et al. (15Ali A.M. Atmaj J. Van Oosterwijk N. Groves M.R. Dömling A. Stapled peptides inhibitors: a new window for target drug discovery.Comput. Struct. Biotechnol.

We have shown previously that the undesired effect of cognitive impairment in the presence of trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is driven by homo-/heterooligomerization between CB1 and 5-HT2A receptors (16Viñals X. Moreno E. Lanfumey L. Cordomí A. Pastor A. de La Torre R. Gasperini P. Navarro G. Howell L.A. Pardo L. Lluís C. Canela E.I. McCormick P.J. Maldonado R. Robledo P. Cognitive impairment induced by Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol occurs through heteromers between cannabinoid CB1 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors.PLoS Biol. 2015; 13 (26158621): e100219410.1371/journal.pbio.1002194Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To disrupt this interaction, we developed a NanoLuc binary technology (NanoBiT)-based assay for the screening of a small library of aryl-hydrocarbon–stapled CB1R TM5-mimicking peptides to target CB1–5-HT2A receptor heteromers. NanoBiT is a luciferase-based complementation assay designed to interrogate protein–protein interactions in live cells (17Dixon A.S. Schwinn M.K. Hall M.P. Zimmerman K. Otto P. Lubben T.H. Butler B.L. Binkowski B.F. Machleidt T. Kirkland T.A. Wood M.G. Eggers C.T. Encell L.P. Wood K.V.

Biol. 2016; 11 (26569370): 400-40810.1021/acschembio.5b00753Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we found that stapling peptides led to increased α-helicity and improved proteolytic resistance without any loss of function, suggesting that this approach may improve these molecules chances in vivo. The CB1 and 5-HT2A receptor heteromer has been recently characterized both in vivo and in heterologous expression systems using a broad range of biochemical approaches (16Viñals X. Moreno E. Lanfumey L. Cordomí A. Pastor A. de La Torre R. Gasperini P. Navarro G. Howell L.A. Pardo L. Lluís C. Canela E.I. McCormick P.J. Maldonado R. Robledo P.

In the case of these heteromers, the cognitive impairment induced by THC is abrogated after treatment with CB1R TM5 peptides while maintaining its antinociceptive properties (16Viñals X. Moreno E. Lanfumey L. Cordomí A. Pastor A. de La Torre R. Gasperini P. Navarro G. Howell L.A. Pardo L. Lluís C. Canela E.I. McCormick P.J. Maldonado R. Robledo P. Cognitive impairment induced by Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol occurs through heteromers between cannabinoid CB1 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors.PLoS Biol. 2015; 13 (26158621): e100219410.1371/journal.pbio.1002194Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Therefore, for therapeutic purposes, there needs to be prevention of heteromer formation but preservation of the individual protomer’s function. Thus, we first sought to develop a NanoBiT-based assay for the screening of a small library of hydrocarbon-stapled CB1R TM5-mimicking peptides. To assess whether NanoBiT BiLC may be a suitable system to study GPCR oligomerization, we generated CB1R and 5-HT2AR constructs with the small and large BiT pairs (SmBiT and LgBiT, respectively) attached to the C terminus end of both receptors. A total of four fusion proteins were generated, with Sm/LgBiT fused after the Gly/Ser-rich flexible linker and under the control of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene promoter (HSV-TK) (Fig. S1A). Next, we performed conformational screenings to assess the optimal configuration for all receptor pairs. Accordingly, when analyzing CB1R–5-HT2AR heteromers, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with all possible combinations of 5-HT2AR Lg/SmBiT and CB1R Lg/SmBiT at two different DNA ratios (Fig. S1B). Surprisingly, none of the analyzed configurations yielded a positive interaction. Similarly, when addressing the formation of CB1R and 5-HT2AR homodimers, none of the examined orientations or DNA ratios exhibited significant differences compared with the individual receptors when expressed by themselves (Fig. S1, C and D). Importantly, to rule out whether these negative results might reflect the unsuitability of the NanoBiT system for the analysis of GPCR oligomerization rather than any kind of experimental hindrance, we analyzed the known interaction between the protein kinase A catalytic (PRKACA) and type 2A regulatory (PRKAR2A) subunits. This protein pair positive control has been previously optimized, with LgBiT-PRKAR2A and SmBiT-PRKACA the optimal configuration (17Dixon A.S. Schwinn M.K. Hall M.P. Zimmerman K. Otto P. Lubben T.H. Butler B.L. Binkowski B.F. Machleidt T. Kirkland T.A. Wood M.G. Eggers C.T. Encell L.P. Wood K.V. NanoLuc complementation reporter optimized for accurate measurement of protein interactions in cells.ACS Chem. Biol. 2016; 11 (26569370): 400-40810.1021/acschembio.5b00753Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). In agreement, co-transfection of both proteins resulted in a significant increase in the luminescence recorded over the different receptor ratios. Furthermore, co-transfection of LgBiT-PRKAR2A with a noninteracting fusion protein (HaloTag®-SmBiT) did not yield any increase in luminescence (Fig. S1E), supporting the specificity of the detected interaction and the suitability of this system under our assay conditions. However, our results do not reveal if the complementary fusions restrict 5-HT2AR or CB1R functionality or if there is indeed a lack of complementation. Importantly, it should be noted that to minimize potential nonspecific interactions, all generated constructs were under the control of the HSV-TK promoter. Thus, to address the lack of a BiLC signal, we performed secondary messenger signaling experiments and recloned all four receptor configurations under the control of the high-level expression cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Interestingly, all 5-HT2AR constructs in an HSV-TK context failed to elicit intracellular calcium release (canonical signaling pathway downstream to the Gq/11- coupled 5-HT2AR) after agonist stimulation (18Alexander S.P. Christopoulos A. Davenport A.P. Kelly E. Marrion N.V. Peters J.A. Faccenda E. Harding S.D. Pawson A.J. Sharman J.L. Southan C. Davies J.A. CGTP Collaborators The concise guide to pharmacology 2017/18: G protein-coupled receptors.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2017; 174 (29055040): S17-S12910.1111/bph.13878Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). However, both 5-HT2AR LgBiT and 5-HT2AR SmBiT displayed similar efficacies and potencies compared with the WT receptor when expressed under the control of the CMV promoter (Fig. S2A). Similarly, we assessed CB1R-driven adenylate cyclase inhibition with analogous results. Both CMV-regulated CB1R constructs inhibited the forskolin-induced cAMP release with equivalent potencies and efficacies to the WT CB1R receptor. However, under the HVS-TK promoter, CB1R LgBiT failed to signal through heterotrimeric Gi/o proteins, and CB1R SmBiT exhibited a reduced adenylate cyclase inhibitory activity (∼20%) when compared with WT CB1R receptor (Fig. S2B). These results indicate that the NanoBiT fusions do not adversely affect 5-HT2A or CB1 receptor functionality, as the ligand potencies and maximal efficacies are within the WT receptor ranges. Thus, the absence of luciferase complementation between HSV-TK–regulated constructs most likely reflects low levels of receptor expression due to the weaker promoter rather than steric hindrance of the interacting pairs (19Qin J.Y. Zhang L. Clift K.L. Hulur I. Xiang A.P. Ren B.-Z. Lahn B.T. Systematic comparison of constitutive promoters and the doxycycline-inducible promoter.PLoS One. 2010; 5 (20485554): e1061110.1371/journal.pone.0010611Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Accordingly, as in the previous studies illustrated in Fig. 1A, we repeated the conformational screenings with the new set of constructs under the CMV promoter. When analyzing 5-HT2AR–CB1R heteromerization, we detected a significant increase in the luminescence for all receptor combinations, with 5-HT2AR LgBiT:CB1R SmBiT being the optimal pair in terms of assay window (Fig. 1B). To validate the specificity of the interaction, increasing amounts of untagged 5-HT2AR and CB1R receptors were transfected in the presence of a fixed 5-HT2AR LgBiT:CB1R SmBiT ratio. Accordingly, we observed a decreased luminescence with increasing levels of both untagged proteins (Fig. 1, E and F), indicating that the detected interaction was not driven by the finite affinity between the NanoLuc subunits. In parallel, we assessed CB1R and 5-HT2AR homomerization with similar results. Co-transfection of both CB1R-interacting pairs resulted in a significant increase in luminescence that could be reverted by increasing untagged CB1R concentrations (Fig. 1, C and G). Similarly, the specific interaction between 5-HT2AR LgBiT and 5-HT2AR SmBiT was hindered when titrating increasing concentrations of untagged 5-HT2AR (Fig. 1, D and H). Importantly, when comparing the relative intensities of these interactions, we found that 5-HT2AR homodimers displayed the highest luminescent signals, followed by 5-HT2AR–CB1R heteromers and CB1R homodimers (RLU for 5-HT2AR:5-HT2AR > 5-HT2AR:CB1R > CB1R:CB1R). In addition, higher nontagged 5-HT2AR concentrations were necessary to displace 5-HT2AR homodimers (Fig. 1H). However, our results cannot discriminate whether it reflects the relative affinities between the interacting receptors or a more proximal distance of the NanoBiT pairs in the C terminus of the receptors. Altogether, our data strongly support NanoBiT BiLC as a nondestructive and powerful tool to study GPCRs oligomerization, providing a specific and sensitive assay to detect these receptor complexes in live cells. To obtain a more comprehensive understanding of bimolecular complementation assays to study GPCR oligomerization, we sought to address whether NanoBiT could provide better results compared with bimolecular fluorescent complementation. To this end, we developed a Venus bimolecular fluorescent complementation (BiFC) assay to study CB1R and 5-HT2AR homo-/heteromerization. Specifically, fragments derived from the truncated Venus fluorescent protein at either position Asp-155 (VC155; amino acid residues 155–238) or Asp-173 (VN173; amino acid residues 1–173) were fused after the Gly/Ser-rich flexible linker to the C terminus of both CB1 and 5-HT2A receptors (Fig. 2A). This strategy has been extensively applied to the study of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) and takes advantage of Venus, a variant of the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) with improved sensitivity to chromophore maturation under physiological temperatures (21Kilpatrick L.E. Humphrys L.J. Holliday N.D. A G protein-coupled receptor dimer imaging assay reveals selectively modified pharmacology of neuropeptide Y Y1/Y5 receptor heterodimers.Mol.

Several groups have used this approach to study GPCR oligomerization, including heteromers between the adenosine A2A and the dopamine D2 receptors, dopamine D2 oligomers, or neuropeptide Y Y1/Y5 receptor heterodimers (19Qin J.Y. Zhang L. Clift K.L. Hulur I. Xiang A.P. Ren B.-Z. Lahn B.T.

Attachment of both Venus hemiprotein fragments to the 5-HT2AR C-terminal tail (5-HT2AR–VN173 and 5-HT2AR–VC155 constructs) did not impact receptor function, with equivalent [Ca2+]i release dose–response curves compared with the WT receptor (Fig. S3A). Similarly, the VC155 fragments fused to CB1R (CB1R-VC155) did not affect CB1R-mediated cAMP release inhibition. However, although its maximal efficacy remained unaltered, VN1733 fusion to CB1R (CB1R-VN173) resulted in ∼10-fold reduction in WIN 55212-2 (WIN) potency (Fig. S3B). Next, we proceeded to compare both protein complementation assays. For CB1R and 5-HT2AR homomers, BiFC experiments were performed under the same conditions that yielded the optimal assay windows in the NanoBiT BiLC experiments (Fig. 2). When assessing 5-HT2AR–CB1R heteromers, both possible receptor configurations (5-HT2AR–VN173:CB1R–VC155 and 5-HT2AR–VC155:CB1R–VN173) were taken into account. Surprisingly, 24 and 48 h after reverse transfection, none of the analyzed BiFC combinations yielded significant fluorescent levels (data not shown), suggesting time-dependent protein maturation and/or folding. Therefore, the following BiFC experiments were performed 48 h post-transfection (see “Experimental procedures”), although BiLC assays remained under the same setup (24 h post-transfection). Compared with Venus BiFC, NanoBiT complementation provided higher assay windows over all of the oligomeric configurations (Fig. 2). Specifically, we observed a 20-fold increase for CB1R homodimers, 130-fold increase for 5-HT2AR homodimers, and 9–18-fold increase for 5-HT2AR–CB1R heteromers. Interestingly, the relative fluorescent/luminescent intensities for the different receptor pairs followed the same trend across both methods (RFU/RLU for 5-HT2AR:5-HT2AR > 5-HT2AR:CB1R > CB1R:CB1R), suggesting that this could reflect the affinity between these oligomeric arrangements. Next, we sought to test whether N-terminal tagging might yield better assay windows (Fig. 3A). SmBiT and LgBiT fusion to the 5-HT2AR extracellular end did not impact function, as treatment with the agonist (±)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine hydrochloride (DOI) induced maximal calcium release, although a small reduction in DOI potency was observed in the LgBiT–5-HT2AR construct (Fig. S4A). The homologous CB1R constructs remained unaltered, with virtually the exact potencies and maximal responses as the WT receptor (Fig. S4B). Next, we compared N- or C-terminal NanoBiT-tagged receptors, accounting for their ability to reveal CB1R and 5-HT2AR homo-/heteromers. When measuring the interaction between receptors from the same type, NanoBiT attachment to the C-terminal domain provided the optimal orientation for CB1R homomers (Fig. 3B). In the case of 5-HT2AR homomers, N-terminally tagging resulted in a discrete but significant improvement in the assay window at high DNA concentrations (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the biggest difference was observed when assessing the optimal 5-HT2AR–CB1R heteromeric conformation, with the N-terminal fusions providing the best results (Fig. 3C). Importantly, a ∼200-fold increase was achieved at low DNA-transfected concentrations, therefore reducing the probability of stochastic nonspecific interactions and thus more closely mimicking physiological expression levels. The LgBiT–CB1R and SmBiT–5-HT2AR combination was therefore used in all further experiments. In previous studies, we demonstrated that 5-HT2AR–CB1R heteromers could be selectively disrupted using synthetic peptides mimicking the CB1R TM5 and TM6 domains (16Viñals X. Moreno E. Lanfumey L.

https://openalex.org/W2970914686,"An accurate estimate of limb position is necessary for movement planning, before and after motor learning. Where we localize our unseen hand after a reach depends on felt hand position, or proprioception, but in studies and theories on motor adaptation this is quite often neglected in favour of predicted sensory consequences based on efference copies of motor commands. Both sources of information should contribute, so here we set out to further investigate how much of hand localization depends on proprioception and how much on predicted sensory consequences. We use a training paradigm combining robot controlled hand movements with rotated visual feedback that eliminates the possibility to update predicted sensory consequences ('exposure training'), but still recalibrates proprioception, as well as a classic training paradigm with self-generated movements in another set of participants. After each kind of training we measure participants' hand location estimates based on both efference-based predictions and afferent proprioceptive signals with self-generated hand movements ('active localization') as well as based on proprioception only with robot-generated movements ('passive localization'). In the exposure training group, we find indistinguishable shifts in passive and active hand localization, but after classic training, active localization shifts more than passive, indicating a contribution from updated predicted sensory consequences. Both changes in open-loop reaches and hand localization are only slightly smaller after exposure training as compared to after classic training, confirming that proprioception plays a large role in estimating limb position and in planning movements, even after adaptation.

https://openalex.org/W2970751905,"The primary cilium is a cellular sensor that detects light, chemicals, and movement and is important for morphogen and growth factor signaling. The small GTPase Rab11–Rab8 cascade is required for ciliogenesis. Rab11 traffics the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Rabin8 to the centrosome to activate Rab8, needed for ciliary growth. Rabin8 also requires the transport particle protein complex (TRAPPC) proteins for centrosome recruitment during ciliogenesis. Here, using an MS-based approach for identifying Rabin8-interacting proteins, we identified C7orf43 (also known as microtubule-associated protein 11 (MAP11)) as being required for ciliation both in human cells and zebrafish embryos. We find that C7orf43 directly binds to Rabin8 and that C7orf43 knockdown diminishes Rabin8 preciliary centrosome accumulation. Interestingly, we found that C7orf43 co-sediments with TRAPPII complex subunits and directly interacts with TRAPPC proteins. Our findings establish that C7orf43 is a TRAPPII-specific complex component, referred to here as TRAPPC14. Additionally, we show that TRAPPC14 is dispensable for TRAPPII complex integrity but mediates Rabin8 association with the TRAPPII complex. Finally, we demonstrate that TRAPPC14 interacts with the distal appendage proteins Fas-binding factor 1 (FBF1) and centrosomal protein 83 (CEP83), which we show here are required for GFP-Rabin8 centrosomal accumulation, supporting a role for the TRAPPII complex in tethering preciliary vesicles to the mother centriole during ciliogenesis. In summary, our findings have revealed an uncharacterized TRAPPII-specific component, C7orf43/TRAPPC14, that regulates preciliary trafficking of Rabin8 and ciliogenesis and support previous findings that the TRAPPII complex functions as a membrane tether."
https://openalex.org/W2970897010,"Background Maternal deaths are far too common in Nigeria, and this is in part due to lack of access to lifesaving emergency obstetric care, especially among women in the poorest strata in Nigeria. Data on the extent of inequality in access to such lifesaving intervention could convince policymakers in developing an appropriate intervention. This study examines inequality in access to births by caesarean section in Nigeria. Methods Data for 20,468 women who gave birth in the five years preceding 2013 Nigerian Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) were used for this study. Inequality in caesarean delivery was assessed using the concentration curve and multiple logistic regression models. Results There was a high concentration in the utilisation of caesarean section among the women in the relatively high wealth quintile. Overall, delivery by caesarean section was 2.1%, but the rate was highest among women who had higher education and belonged to the richest wealth quintile (13.6%) and lowest among women without formal education and who belonged to the poorest wealth quintile (0.4%). Belonging to the poorest wealth quintile and having no formal education were associated with lower odds of having delivery by caesarean section. Conclusion In conclusion, women in the richest households are within the WHO’s recommended level of 10–15% for caesarean birth utilisation, but women in the poorest households are so far away from the recommended rate. Equity in healthcare is still a promise, its realisation will entail making care available to those in need not only those who can afford it."

https://openalex.org/W2970291459,"Thiosulfate dehydrogenases (TsdAs) are bidirectional bacterial di-heme enzymes that catalyze the interconversion of tetrathionate and thiosulfate at measurable rates in both directions. In contrast to our knowledge of TsdA activities, information on the redox properties in the absence of substrates is rather scant. To address this deficit, we combined magnetic CD (MCD) spectroscopy and protein film electrochemistry (PFE) in a study to resolve heme ligation and redox chemistry in two representative TsdAs. We examined the TsdAs from Campylobacter jejuni, a microaerobic human pathogen, and from the purple sulfur bacterium Allochromatium vinosum. In these organisms, the enzyme functions as a tetrathionate reductase and a thiosulfate oxidase, respectively. The active site Heme 1 in both enzymes has His/Cys ligation in the ferric and ferrous states and the midpoint potentials (Em) of the corresponding redox transformations are similar, −185 mV versus standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). However, fundamental differences are observed in the properties of the second, electron transferring, Heme 2. In C. jejuni, TsdA Heme 2 has His/Met ligation and an Em of +172 mV. In A. vinosum TsdA, Heme 2 reduction triggers a switch from His/Lys ligation (Em, −129 mV) to His/Met (Em, +266 mV), but the rates of interconversion are such that His/Lys ligation would be retained during turnover. In summary, our findings have unambiguously assigned Em values to defined axial ligand sets in TsdAs, specified the rates of Heme 2 ligand exchange in the A. vinosum enzyme, and provided information relevant to describing their catalytic mechanism(s)."
https://openalex.org/W2970253511,"The haptophyte alga Emiliania huxleyi is the most abundant coccolithophore in the modern ocean and produces elaborate calcite crystals, called coccolith, in a separate intracellular compartment known as the coccolith vesicle. Despite the importance of biomineralization in coccolithophores, the molecular mechanism underlying it remains unclear. Understanding this precise machinery at the molecular level will provide the knowledge needed to enable further manipulation of biomineralization. In our previous study, altering the calcium concentration modified the calcifying ability of E. huxleyi CCMP371. Therefore in this study, we tested E. huxleyi cells acclimated to three different calcium concentrations (0, 0.1, and 10 mM). To understand the whole transcript profile at different calcium concentrations, RNA-sequencing was performed and used for de novo assembly and annotation. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among the three different calcium concentrations were analyzed. The functional classification by gene ontology (GO) revealed that ‘intrinsic component of membrane’ was the most enriched of the GO terms at the ambient calcium concentration (10 mM) compared with the limited calcium concentrations (0 and 0.1 mM). Moreover, the DEGs in those comparisons were enriched mainly in ‘secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism’ and ‘signal transduction mechanisms’ in the KOG clusters and ‘processing in endoplasmic reticulum’, and ‘ABC transporters’ in the KEGG pathways. Furthermore, metabolic pathways involved in protein synthesis were enriched among the differentially expressed proteins. The results of this study provide a molecular profile for understanding the expression of transcripts and proteins in E. huxleyi at different calcium concentrations, which will help to identify the detailed mechanism of its calcification."
https://openalex.org/W2970356259,"The potential of genomic selection (GS) is currently being evaluated for fruit breeding. GS models are usually constructed based on information from both the genotype and phenotype of population. However, information from phenotyped but non-genotyped relatives can also be used to construct GS models, and this additional information can improve their accuracy. In the present study, we evaluated the utility of single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction (ssGBLUP) in citrus breeding, which is a genomic prediction method that combines the kinship information from genotyped and non-genotyped relatives into a single relationship matrix for a mixed model to apply GS. Fruit weight, sugar content, and acid content of 1,935 citrus individuals, of which 483 had genotype data of 2,354 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms, were evaluated from 2009–2012. The prediction accuracy of ssGBLUP for genotyped individuals was similar to or higher than that of usual genomic best linear unbiased prediction method using only genotyped individuals, especially for sugar content. Therefore, ssGBLUP could yield higher accuracy in genotyped individuals by adding information from non-genotyped relatives. The prediction accuracy of ssGBLUP for non-genotyped individuals was also slightly higher than that of conventional best linear unbiased prediction method using pedigree information.

https://openalex.org/W2970422519,"Bengal tigers (Panthera tigris tigris) serve a pivotal role as an apex predator in forest ecosystems. To increase our knowledge on factors impacting the viability and health of this endangered species, we studied the gut microbiota in 32 individual Bengal tigers from three geographically separated areas (Chitwan National Park (CNP), Bardia National Park (BNP) and Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve (SWR)) in Nepal, using noninvasive genetic sampling methods. Gut microbiota influence the immune system, impact various physiological functions, and modulates metabolic reactions, that ultimately impact the host health, behavior and development. Across the tiger populations in Nepal, we found significant differences in the composition of microbial communities based on their geographic locations. Specifically, we detected significant differences between CNP and the other two protected areas (CNP vs BNP: pseudo t = 1.944, P = 0.006; CNP vs SWR: pseudo t = 1.9942, P = 0.0071), but no differences between BNP and SWR. This mirrors what has been found for tiger gene flow in the same populations, suggesting gut microbiota composition and host gene flow may be linked. Furthermore, predictive metagenome functional content analysis (PICRUSt) revealed a higher functional enrichment and diversity for significant gut microbiota in the Chitwan tiger population and the lowest enrichment and diversity in Suklaphanta. The CNP tiger population contained higher proportions of microbiota that are associated with predicted functions relevant for metabolism of amino acid, lipid, xenobiotics biodegradation, terpenoides and polyketides than the SWR population. We conclude the tiger population structure, gut microbiota profile and associated functional metabolic categories are correlated, with geographically most separated CNP and SWR tiger population having the most distinct and different host genotype and microbiota profiles. Our work dramatically expands the understanding of tiger microbiota in wild populations and provides a valuable case study on how to investigate genetic diversity at different hierarchical levels, including hosts as well as their microbial communities."
https://openalex.org/W2970846587,"Background and aim Workplace Social Capital has been suggested as a useful concept when addressing organizational and social factors of the work environment. The overall aim of the present study is to establish and evaluate the construct validity of a measure of Workplace Social Capital based on the operationalization suggested in the third version of the Copenhagen Psychosocial questionnaire. Methods The present study is based on data collected as part of a validation and development project for the use of the Swedish version of COPSOQ at workplaces and includes responses from 1316 human service workers answering a workplace survey. Six items from scales for organizational justice, vertical trust and horizontal trust in COPSOQ III were included in the analyses. Rasch Analysis was used for scale validation. Results The analyses showed that the psychometric properties of the suggested COPSOQ scale for Workplace Social Capital were satisfactory after accommodation for local dependency. Each individual item worked as intended, the scale was unidimensional and functioned invariantly for women and men, and for younger and older employees. The scale was furthermore found to be valid for use for distinguishing groups, not individuals. Conclusion We have established that the scale for Workplace Social Capital measured by COPSOQ III is valid for distinguishing groups, e.g. work teams. The scale exhibits good construct validity as it satisfies the measurement criteria defined by the Rasch model."
https://openalex.org/W2970894187,"Investigating the effects of gene-environment interactions (G × E) with regard to brain structure may help to elucidate the putative mechanisms associated with psychiatric risk. rs1360780 (C/T) is a functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the gene encoding FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5), which is involved in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis stress responses. The minor (T) allele of FKBP5 is considered a risk allele for stress-related disorders, due to the overproduction of FKBP5, which results in impaired communication of stress signals with the HPA axis. Previous studies have reported that interactions between childhood maltreatment and the rs1360780 genotype affect structures in subcortical areas of the brain. However, it is unclear how this SNP modulates the association between non-adverse environments and brain structure. In this study, we examined the interactive effect of the rs1360780 genotype and maternal acceptance on the regional gray matter volume (rGMV) in 202 Japanese children. Maternal acceptance was assessed using a Japanese psychological questionnaire for mothers. Whole-brain multiple regression analysis using voxel-based morphometry showed a significant positive association between maternal acceptance and rGMV in the left thalamus of T-allele carriers, while a significant negative association was found in C/C homozygotes. Post-hoc analysis revealed that at or below the 70th percentiles of maternal acceptance, the T-allele carriers had a reduced thalamic rGMV compared with that of C/C homozygotes. Thus, our investigation indicated that the effect of the maternal acceptance level on brain development was different, depending on the rs1360780 genotype. Importantly, we found that the differences in brain structure between the T-allele carriers and C/C homozygotes at low to moderate levels of maternal acceptance, which is not equivalent to maltreatment. The present study contributes to the G × E research by highlighting the necessity to investigate the role of non-adverse environmental factors."
https://openalex.org/W2970094702,"In this paper, we explore the problem of establishing a network among the stocks of a market at high frequency level and give an application to program trading. Our work uses high frequency data from the National Stock Exchange, India, for the year 2014. To begin, we analyse the spectrum of the correlation matrix to establish the presence of linear relations amongst the stock returns. A comparison of correlations with pairwise mutual information shows the further existence of non-linear relations which are not captured by correlation. We also see that the non-linear relations are more pronounced at the high frequency level in comparison to the daily returns used in earlier work. We provide two applications of this approach. First, we construct minimal spanning trees for the stock network based on mutual information and study their topology. The year 2014 saw the conduct of general elections in India and the data allows us to explore their impact on aspects of the network, such as the scale-free property and sectorial clusters. Second, having established the presence of non-linear relations, we would like to be able to exploit them. Previous authors have suggested that peripheral stocks in the network would make good proxies for the Markowitz portfolio but with a much smaller number of stocks. We show that peripheral stocks selected using mutual information perform significantly better than ones selected using correlation."
https://openalex.org/W2970402361,"Background Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common complication of pregnancy. It may predispose offspring to increased fat mass (FM) and the development of obesity, however few data from Latin America exist. Objective To investigate the influence of GDM on newborn FM in mother-newborn pairs recruited from a public maternity care center in São Paulo, Brazil. Methods Data were collected cross-sectionally in 2013–2014 from 72 mothers diagnosed with GDM, and 211 mothers with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Newborn FM was evaluated by air-displacement plethysmography (PEA POD), and relevant demographic and obstetric data were collected from hospital records. Associations between maternal GDM status and newborn FM were investigated by multiple linear regression analysis, with adjustment for maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational weight gain, type of delivery, sex of the child, and gestational age. Results FM was greater in GDM versus NGT newborns in a bivariable model (Median (IQR), GDM: 0.35 (0.3) kg vs. NGT: 0.27 (0.2) kg, p = 0.02), however GDM status was not a significant predictor of FM with adjustment for other variables. Rather, pre-pregnancy BMI (coefficient (β) 1.46; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66, 2.27), gestational weight gain (β 1.32; 95% CI 0.49, 2.15), and male sex (β -17.8; 95% CI -27.2, -8.29) predicted newborn FM. Analyzing GDM and NGT groups separately, pre-pregnancy BMI (β 6.75; 95% CI 2.36, 11.1) and gestational weight gain (β 5.64; 95% CI 1.16, 10.1) predicted FM in the GDM group, while male sex alone predicted FM in the NGT group (β -12.3; 95% CI -18.3, -6.34). Conclusions Combined model results suggest that in our cohort, pre-pregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain are more important risk factors for increased neonatal FM than GDM. However, group-specific model results suggest that GDM status may contribute to variation in the relationship between maternal/offspring factors and FM. Our use of a binary GDM variable in the combined model may have precluded clearer results on this point. Prospective cohort studies including data on maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, GWG, and glycemic profile are needed to better understand associations among these variables and their relative influence on offspring FM."
https://openalex.org/W2970833436,"The aim of this study is to explore suitable drip irrigation system on the water saving and high yield of pear-jujube from 2009 to 2012 years in the mountain of northern Shaanxi. The treatments consisted of combinations of 5 drip irrigation systems (DP). The irrigation quota of DP-1, DP-2 and DP-3 treatment was 100 m3 hm-2, 135 m3 hm-2 and 180 m3 hm-2, respectively, irrigated 4 times. The irrigation quota of DP-4 and DP-5 treatment was 135 m3 hm-2 and irrigated 3 and 2times, respectively; and with no irrigation as the control (C). Results indicated that bearing branch length of jujube, fruit set and yield of different drip irrigation system are significantly better than C (P<0.05). Bearing branch length and yield of DP-3 treatment are reached maximum in 2012, which are 22.0 cm and 16772.8 m3 hm-2. And they are increased by 47.7% and 13.2% compared with C, respectively. In addition, the water consumption of different irrigation treatment increases along with the increasing of irrigation amount. And the DP-3 treatment is the highest in different years. The water use efficiency of pear-jujube of low irrigation quota is better than the high irrigation quota. Water use efficiency of 135 m3 hm-2 and irrigated 2 times treatment is the best, which is 1.92 m3 hm-2. Considering the lack of high annual precipitation, we conclude that DP-5 treatment was the best drip irrigation system in the mountain of northern Shaanxi."
https://openalex.org/W2970158911,"Archaeomagnetic and rock-magnetic methods are of great value in the identification of archaeological fire, especially in Palaeolithic sites where evidence is usually scarce, ambiguous or poorly preserved. Although taphonomic processes can significantly modify Palaeolithic combustion structures, the extent to which such processes affect the magnetic record remains unknown. Here we report the results of an archaeomagnetic study involving five, two-to-five-year-old experimental combustion structures in open-air and cave settings. Some of these combustion structures involved post-combustion human actions such as trampling and relighting. Our results show pseudo-single domain (PSD) magnetite as the main magnetic carrier. Wood ash layers of combustion structures are the most magnetic facies followed by thermally altered sediments constituting the combustion substrates. A decreasing magnetic concentration pattern in depth was observed as a function of temperature. Positive correlation was found between good-quality directional data and macroscopically well-preserved combustion structures. Partial thermoremanent magnetization (pTRM) was the main magnetization mechanism identified in the combustion substrate facies. These data coupled with partial thermomagnetic curve experiments show the potential of these methods to estimate maximum temperatures of the last combustion event. Relightings show very good directional results, but they cannot be identified because the time between them is not enough to statistically distinguish directional variations of the local Earth´s magnetic field. The substrate sediment of an intensively trampled combustion structure yielded reliable archaeomagnetic directions. The results are discussed in terms of magnetization preservation potential and the effects of taphonomic processes on the archaeomagnetic record."
https://openalex.org/W2970581638,"In transcriptomics, micro RNAs (miRNAs) has gained much interest especially as potential disease indicators. However, apart from holding a great promise related to their clinical application, a lot of inconsistent results have been published. Our aim was to compare the miRNA expression levels in ovarian cancer and healthy subjects using the Bayesian multilevel model and to assess their potential usefulness in diagnosis. We have analyzed a case-control observational data on expression profiling of 49 preselected miRNA-based ovarian cancer indicators in 119 controls and 59 patients. A Bayesian multilevel model was used to characterize the effect of disease on miRNA levels controlling for differences in age and body weight. The difference between the miRNA level and health status of the patient on the scale of the data variability were discussed in the context of their potential usefulness in diagnosis. Additionally, the cross-validated area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to assess the expected out-of-sample discrimination index of a different sets of miRNAs. The proposed model allowed us to describe the set of miRNA levels in patients and controls. Three highly correlated miRNAs: miR-101-3p, miR-142-5p, miR-148a-3p rank the highest with almost identical effect sizes that ranges from 0.45 to 1.0. For those miRNAs the credible interval for AUC ranged from 0.63 to 0.67 indicating their limited discrimination potential. A little benefit in adding information from other miRNAs was observed. There were several miRNAs in the dataset (miR-604, hsa-miR-221-5p) for which inferences were uncertain. For those miRNAs more experimental effort is needed to fully assess their effect in the context of new hits discovery and usefulness as disease indicators. The proposed multilevel Bayesian model can be used to characterize the panel of miRNA profile and to assess the difference in expression levels between healthy and cancer individuals."

However, experiences regarding analyses of platelet inhibition in pigs using the Multiplate® Analyzer are limited. The aims of the present study were to investigate if (1) the Multiplate® Analyzer is a suitable method for examination of porcine platelet function using manufacturers' recommendations for human blood, and (2) platelet inhibition can be induced with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and clopidogrel in pigs reliably, and if (3) non-responders to one of the drug can be detected. Additionally we examined differences in (4) the effectiveness of ASA between oral administration and intravenous application, and (5) between domestic pigs (German Landrace; GL) and miniature pigs (MP). We investigated platelet function of 36 unmedicated pigs (GL n = 28; MP n = 8). In addition, 32 blood samples taken from medicated pigs (GL n = 15; MP n = 17) were analysed. Platelet inhibition was induced in four different ways: (1) 500 mg ASA intravenously (n = 11), (2) 500 mg ASA intravenously and 450 mg clopidogrel orally (n = 5), (3) 250 mg ASA orally (n = 11), (4) 250 mg ASA orally and 75 mg clopidogrel orally (n = 5). Results of the ASPI and ADP test of the Multiplate® Analyzer subtests in unmedicated and medicated pigs were in a comparable range to results known from humans. Application of ASA decreased the mean values of the ASPI test significantly regardless of the application method. Joined administration of ASA and clopidogrel also decreased the mean values of the ADP test significantly. Both, oral and intravenous administrations of ASA as well as oral administration of clopidogrel effectively inhibited platelet function in pigs. One pig did not respond to clopidogrel. We found no differences between domestic and miniature pigs regarding reference values in unmedicated pigs and the effectiveness of ASA and clopidogrel."
https://openalex.org/W2971039392,"Developmental anomalies of the thyroid gland lead to congenital malformations such as thyroglossal duct cysts and thyroid dysgenesis. However, the pathogenesis of thyroid dysgenesis remains unclear due to the lack of suitable animal models. This study demonstrated that Slc:Wistar/ST rats frequently developed unilateral thyroid dysgenesis, including hemiagenesis, characterized by the absence of one lobe. In Wistar/ST rats, each thyroid lobe was frequently different in size, and approximately 27% and 20% of the rats presented with hemihypoplasia and hemiagenesis of the thyroid gland, respectively. Dysgenesis was predominant on the left side in both sexes, without sex differences. At a young age, thyroid hemiagenesis did not alter body weight. In rats of both sexes with thyroid hemiagenesis, plasma total triiodothyronine and total triiodothyronine levels remained unchanged while plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were significantly elevated in young rats. The remaining thyroid lobes increased in weight, but the follicular epithelial cells appeared normal in terms of their height and proliferating activities. On the side of thyroid dysgenesis, the parathyroid glands were normally localized and were situated at the same location as the contralateral glands. The ultimobranchial body remnants were localized at the level of the thyroid gland along with the cranial thyroid artery and vein, forming cell clusters or cystic structures and containing calcitonin-positive C-cells. In conclusion, Wistar/ST rats developed unilateral thyroid dysgenesis and may be novel and useful animal models for thyroid hemiagenesis in humans and for morphogenesis of pharyngeal pouch-derived organs."
https://openalex.org/W2970793822,"L-aspartate aminotransferase is a pyridoxal 5ʹ-phosphate-dependent transaminase that catalyzes reversible transfer of an α-amino group from aspartate to α-ketoglutarate or from glutamate to oxaloacetate. L-aspartate aminotransferase not only mediates amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism but also regulates the cellular level of amino acids by catalyzing amino acid degradation and biosynthesis. To expand our structural information, we determined the crystal structure of L-aspartate aminotransferase from Schizosaccharomyces pombe at 2.1 Å resolution. A structural comparison between two yeast L-aspartate aminotransferases revealed conserved enzymatic mechanism mediated by the open–closed conformational change. Compared with higher eukaryotic species, L-aspartate aminotransferases showed distinguishable inter-subunit interaction between the N-terminal arm and a large domain of the opposite subunit. Interestingly, structural homology search showed varied conformation of the N-terminal arm among 71 structures of the family. Therefore, we classified pyridoxal 5ʹ-phosphate-dependent enzymes into eight subclasses based on the structural feature of N-terminal arms. In addition, structure and sequence comparisons showed strong relationships among the eight subclasses. Our results may provide insights into structure-based evolutionary aspects of pyridoxal 5ʹ-phosphate-dependent enzymes."

Nowadays, such databases as ENCODE, GTRD, ChIP-Atlas and ReMap systematically collect and annotate a large number of ChIP-Seq datasets. Comprehensive control of dataset quality is currently indispensable to select the most reliable data for further analysis. In addition to existing quality control metrics, we have developed two novel metrics that allow to control false positives and false negatives in ChIP-Seq datasets. For this purpose, we have adapted well-known population size estimate for determination of unknown number of genuine transcription factor binding regions. Determination of the proposed metrics was based on overlapping distinct binding sites derived from processing one ChIP-Seq experiment by different peak callers. Moreover, the metrics also can be useful for assessing quality of datasets obtained from processing distinct ChIP-Seq experiments by a given peak caller. We also have shown that these metrics appear to be useful not only for dataset selection but also for comparison of peak callers and identification of site motifs based on ChIP-Seq datasets. The developed algorithm for determination of the false positive control metric and false negative control metric for ChIP-Seq datasets was implemented as a plugin for a BioUML platform: https://ict.biouml.org/bioumlweb/chipseq_analysis.html."
https://openalex.org/W2970786508,"Cooperation among kin is common in animal societies. Kin groups may form by individuals directly discriminating relatives based on kin recognition cues, or form passively through natal philopatry and limited dispersal. We describe the genetic landscape for a primitively eusocial wasp, Polistes dominula, and ask whether individuals choose cooperative partners that are nearby and/or that are genetic relatives. Firstly, we genotyped an entire sub-population of 1361 wasps and found genetic structuring on an extremely fine scale: the probability of finding genetic relatives decreases exponentially within just a few meters of an individual’s nest. At the same time, however, we found a lack of genetic structuring between natural nest aggregations within the population. Secondly, in a separate dataset where ~2000 wasps were genotyped, we show that wasps forced experimentally to make a new nest choice tended to choose new nests near to their original nests, and that these nests tended to contain some full sisters. However, a significant fraction of wasps chose nests that did not contain sisters, despite sisters being present in nearby nests. Although we cannot rule out a role for direct kin recognition or natal nest-mate recognition, our data suggest that kin groups may form via a philopatric rule-of-thumb, whereby wasps simply select groups and nesting sites that are nearby. The result is that most subordinate helpers obtain indirect fitness benefits by breeding cooperatively."
https://openalex.org/W2971190845,"Tourism represents an important opportunity to provide sustainable funding for many ecosystems, including marine systems. Tourism that is reliant on aggregating predator species in a specific area using food provisioning raises questions about the long-term ecological impacts to the ecosystem at large? Here, using opportunistically collected video footage, we document that 61 different species of fish across 16 families are consuming tuna flesh at two separate shark dive tourism operations in the Republic of Fiji. Of these fish, we have resolved 55 to species level. Notably, 35 (63%) of the identified species we observed consuming tuna flesh were from ostensibly non-piscivorous fishes, including four Acanthuridae species, a group primarily recognized as browsers or grazers of algae and epibenthic detritus. Our results indicate that shark diving is having a direct impact on species other than sharks and that many species are facultatively expanding their trophic niches to accommodate the hyperabundance of resources provided by ecotourism."

Quantifying knowledge of positive HIV status and antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage among non-citizens in a high HIV-prevalence country like Botswana that is close to achieving UNAIDS “90-90-90” targets may expose important gaps in achieving universal HIV testing and treatment. Methods The Botswana Combination Prevention Project (BCPP) is a pair-matched cluster-randomized trial evaluating the impact of prevention interventions on HIV incidence in 30 rural or peri-urban communities. Community case finding and HIV testing were conducted in home and mobile venues in 15 intervention communities from October 2013-September 2017. In this secondary analysis, we compared HIV positivity, knowledge of positive HIV-status, and ART status among all citizens and non-citizens assessed at intake in the intervention communities. Results HIV status was assessed in 57,556 residents in the intervention communities; 4% (n = 2,463) were non-citizens. Five communities accounted for 81% of the total non-citizens assessed. A lower proportion of non-citizens were HIV-positive (15%; n = 369) compared to citizens (21%; n = 11,416) [p = 0.026]; however, a larger proportion of non-citizens did not know their HIV-positive status prior to BCPP testing (75%) as compared to citizens (15%) [p = 0.003]. Among residents with knowledge of their HIV-positive status before BCPP, 79% of the non-citizens (72/91) were on ART compared to 86% (8,267/9,652) of citizens (p = 0.137). Conclusions Although non-citizens were less likely to know their HIV-positive status compared to citizens, there were no differences in treatment uptake among non-citizens and citizens who knew their status. Designing interventions for non-citizens that provide HIV testing and treatment services commensurate to that of citizens as well as targeting communities with the largest number of non-citizens may help close a meaningful gap in the HIV care cascade and ensure ethical treatment for all HIV-positive persons.

Tracking transplanted cells to ascertain their contribution to tissue recapitulation presents a challenge. This study demonstrates a methodology based on passive staining with carboxyfluorescein hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (CFSE) that enables localization of cells in tissue sections to investigate the fate of transplanted cells in wound re-epithelialisation.Viability and migration of CFSE-stained keratinocytes and melanocytes were investigated using viability staining and scratch assays, while proliferation of cells was measured using flow cytometry. In addition, CFSE-stained keratinocytes and melanocytes were transplanted to a human ex vivo wound model, either in suspension, or with the aid of macroporous gelatine microcarriers. Wounds were analysed seven, 14 and 21 days post transplantation using cryosectioning and fluorescence microscopy. Sections from wounds with transplanted co-cultured keratinocytes and melanocytes were stained for pancytokeratin to distinguish keratinocytes.CFSE-staining of keratinocytes and melanocytes did not affect the viability, migration or proliferation of the cells. Transplanted cells were tracked in ex vivo wounds for 21 days, illustrating that the staining had no effect on wound re-epithelialisation. In conclusion, this study presents a novel application of CFSE-staining for tacking transplanted primary human keratinocytes and melanocytes."

The questionnaire has been developed and validated in adult samples. It is unknown whether adolescents and emerging adults respond to the 4DSQ items in the same way as adults do. The objective of the study was to examine measurement equivalence of the 4DSQ across adolescents, emerging adults and adults. 4DSQ data were collected in a primary care psychotherapy practice (N = 1349). Measurement equivalence was assessed using differential item and test functioning (DIF and DTF) analysis in an item response theory framework. DIF was compared across the following groups: adolescents (age 10–17), emerging adults (age 18–25), and adults (age 26–40). DIF was found in 9 items (out of 50) across adolescents and adults, and in 4 items across emerging adults and adults. The item with the largest DIF was ‘difficulty getting to sleep’, which was less severe for adolescents compared to adults. A likely explanation is that adolescents have a high base rate for problems with sleep initiation. The effect of DIF on the scale scores (DTF) was negligible. Adolescents and emerging adults score some 4DSQ items differently compared to adults but this had practically no effect on 4DSQ scale scores. 4DSQ scale scores from adolescents and emerging adults can be interpreted in the same way as 4DSQ scores from adults."

Recent studies suggest that a modern-day parallel to the episode described in Acts 6:1-7 is being played out in historic barrios across the United States.1 With the rapid growth of the Hispanic evangelical church during the past three decades, problems have arisen. One of the most significant is that US-born2 English-do minant Latinas/os3 are unintentionally being overlooked in the distribution of the church’s attention and resources. To take the metaphor from the book of Acts, US-born English-do minant Latinas/os, the modern-day Greek-speaking Jews, are grumbling against foreign-born4 Spanish-dominant Latinas/os, the modern-day Aramaic-speaking Jews. The complaint of the former is that many Spanish-dominant Latinas/os still equate“Hispanic ministry” with ministry conducted almost exclusively in Spanish.
