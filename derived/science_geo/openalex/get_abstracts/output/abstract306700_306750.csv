https://openalex.org/W2029174977,"This article surveys current answers to the factual question posed in the title and reviews the kinds of information that are needed to make these answers more precise. Various factors affecting diversity are also reviewed. These include the structure of food webs, the relative abundance of species, the number of species and of individuals in different categories of body size, along with other determinants of the commonness and rarity of organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1974377563,"There is now a good theoretical understanding of life history evolution, and detailed explicit optimality models have been constructed. These present a challenge for empirical work examining some of the assumptions, such as the extent and mechanisms of the costs of growth and reproduction. In addition, there is an obvious need for comparative tests of the models. These tests, properly applied, may be particularly informative because they can deal with multiple independent variables, including ecological variables, and can reveal broad trends against a background of constraints on optima and the rate of evolutionary approach to them. Life histories are the probabilities of survival and the rates of reproduction at each age in the life-span. Reproduction is costly, so that fertility at all ages cannot simultaneously be maximized by natural selection. Allocation of reproductive effort has evolved in response to the demographic impact of different environments but is constrained by genetic variance and evolutionary history."
https://openalex.org/W2072495637,"High-speed x-ray movies of European starlings flying in a wind tunnel provide detailed documentation of avian skeletal movements during flapping flight. The U-shaped furcula (or ""wishbone,"" which represents the fused clavicles) bends laterally during downstroke and recoils during upstroke; these movements may facilitate inflation and deflation of the clavicular air sac. Sternal movements are also coupled with wingbeat, ascending and retracting on downstroke and descending and protracting on upstroke in an approximately elliptical pathway. The coupled actions of the sternum and furcula appear to be part of a respiratory cycling mechanism between the lungs and air sacs."
https://openalex.org/W2007892750,"Mixed single crystals composed of host and guest organic molecules of similar structures and shapes are shown to comprise sectors with different host-guest distributions and to have symmetries lower than that of the host crystal. These properties are determined by the structure of the guest and the surface structures of the crystal faces through which the guest molecules are occluded. This general concept is illustrated by studies of three mixed crystal systems, (E)-cinnamamide—(E)-2-thienylacrylamide, (E)-cinnamamide—(E)-3-thienylacrylamide, and (S)-asparagine—(S)-aspartic acid, with x-ray and neutron diffraction and solid-state photochemistry."
