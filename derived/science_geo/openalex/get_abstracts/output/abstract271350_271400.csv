https://openalex.org/W2025748856,Observation of the height of the dust layer responsible for the onset of brilliant sunsets in the 30Â°N zone since September 1963 gives evidence that the ash has diffused from the eruption of the volcano Agung on Bali. A height of 22 km is derived for the top of the primary stratum.

All division was suppressed by the analog treatment, and a peak in division stages ( up to 62.5 percent) was reached 14 hours after removal from the aminouracil. Populations of partially synchronized cells can be useful in experiments designed to study various intracellular reactions or responses at different stages in the nuclear cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2011765795,"A large crystal of lead sulfide from Picher, Oklahoma, has significant differences in isotopic composition of lead in successive growth zones. Lead isotope ratios in the parent ore-fluid evidently changed with time during crystal growth. The growth history of this crystal, interpreted quantitatively, points to a tentative hypothesis of genesis of Mississippi Valley deposits of lead and zinc."
https://openalex.org/W1995193872,"Accumulation of strontium-90 in field-grown crops was measured during the spring of 1962. Each rainfall markedly increased the strontium-90 content of the crops, except when the plants were very small. Accumulation between rains was comparatively small, about equal to the expected uptake from the soil."

https://openalex.org/W1968547767,An aqueous extract from peach fruitlets caused a kinin-like stimulation of olive callus in tissue cultures. Activity appeared only when indole-3-acetic acid was also used. The extract caused weight increase and growth characteristics similar to control cultures provided with commercial kinetin.

https://openalex.org/W2090905257,"Metallic spherules of variable character have been recovered from Antarctic snow. Three types were recognized from their surface features: type 1, smooth, polished spherules, apparently produced by surface melting of the particles upon entry into the earth's atmosphere; type 11, spherules with a corrugated surface caused by differential hardness of internal, intersecting lamellae, but modified by superimposed pits; and type III, spherules with random, circular depressions or pits apparently resulting from impact with submicroscopic particles. Spherules of types II and III were too small to have suffered abrasion by impacts in the earth's atmosphere, and it is postulated that their surfaces may have been produced by erosion in space. Preservation of these surface details would have been possible if entry into the atmosphere took place at low velocities and low-angle trajectories."
https://openalex.org/W1993986309,"Two species of conchostracans (class Crustacea) occur in the coal measures of the Ohio Range, associated with a typical Glossopteris flora. New Leaia and Cyzicus (Lioestheria) species occur in a restricted zone near the top of the stratigraphic section. The biofacies represents a swampy environment and deposition in short-lived ponds of still water under variable weather cycles. The zone compares closely with the leaiid zones in South Africa, South America, and Australia, and is assigned to the Middle-Upper Permian, specifically, Lower Beaufort age."
https://openalex.org/W4251848634,Barium xenate was prepared by the addition of barium hydroxide to xenic acid. The resulting white amorphous precipitate was shown by elementary analysis to be Ba(3)XeO(6).
https://openalex.org/W2003914476,"Addition of N, N-dibutyl-p-chlorobenzene sulphonamide (Antiresistant/DDT) in amounts equal to one fifth the dose of DDT increased the toxicity of DDT to the DDT-resistant portion of a housefly population. Full susceptibility was not regained. There was no increase in toxicity to the DDT-susceptible portion."
