https://openalex.org/W2887598244,"Competition theory and niche theory suggest that two morphologically similar species may coexist by reducing the overlap of at least one dimension of their ecological niche. The medium and small Neotropical felids are an interesting group of carnivore species for studying intraguild competition. Due to differences in size it is expected that the larger ocelot exert strong interference competition on the smaller felids (southern tiger cat, margay and jaguarundi); which, in turn, may exert exploitative competition among themselves. Moreover, landscape changes due to human activities may alter these interspecific interactions. We studied the habitat use and the spatial and temporal interspecific relations of the medium and small Atlantic Forest felids, in a landscape with different levels of anthropogenic impact. We estimated the detection probability, and occupancy probability of these cats and whether these parameters are affected by environmental and anthropogenic variables or by the estimated occupancy and detection probability of the ocelot. We estimated the overlap in daily activity patterns between pairs of the four species and changes in their activity in response to anthropogenic impact. We also studied the potential changes that may have occurred in the daily activity of the small felids in relation to ocelot's occupancy probability. The probability of habitat use of the small- and medium-size felids was negatively associated to the intensity of landscape use by humans. Co-occurrence models indicated that the probability of habitat use by southern tiger cats decreased with ocelot occupancy probability. This effect was higher as human disturbance increased. Moreover, the ocelot and the southern tiger cat became more nocturnal in sites with higher human access, suggesting that they may be temporally avoiding encounters with humans or dogs. Conservation of medium and small felids in the Atlantic Forest depends not only on the establishment and implementations of protected areas but also on the management of human's land uses."

Several studies demonstrated its significant antiviral, antifungal and antibacterial properties. The aim of this work is the study of the synergistic effects of M. piperita EO with antibacterials and antifungals that are widely available and currently prescribed in therapies against infections. The observed strong synergy may constitute a potential new approach to counter the increasing phenomenon of multidrug resistant bacteria and fungi. In vitro efficacy of the association M. piperita EO/drugs was evaluated against a large panel of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and yeast strains. The antimicrobial effects were studied by checkerboard microdilution method. The synergistic effect of M. piperita EO with gentamicin resulted in a strong growth inhibition for all the bacterial species under study. The synergistic effect observed for M. piperita EO and antifungals was less pronounced."
https://openalex.org/W2887246657,"Soft robotics is an emerging technology that has shown considerable promise in deep-sea marine biological applications. It is particularly useful in facilitating delicate interactions with fragile marine organisms. This study describes the shipboard design, 3D printing and integration of custom soft robotic manipulators for investigating and interacting with deep-sea organisms. Soft robotics manipulators were tested down to 2224m via a Remotely-Operated Vehicle (ROV) in the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA) and facilitated the study of a diverse suite of soft-bodied and fragile marine life. Instantaneous feedback from the ROV pilots and biologists allowed for rapid re-design, such as adding “fingernails”, and re-fabrication of soft manipulators at sea. These were then used to successfully grasp fragile deep-sea animals, such as goniasterids and holothurians, which have historically been difficult to collect undamaged via rigid mechanical arms and suction samplers. As scientific expeditions to remote parts of the world are costly and lengthy to plan, on-the-fly soft robot actuator printing offers a real-time solution to better understand and interact with delicate deep-sea environments, soft-bodied, brittle, and otherwise fragile organisms. This also offers a less invasive means of interacting with slow-growing deep marine organisms, some of which can be up to 18,000 years old."
https://openalex.org/W2746955579,"Similarity between narcissism and self-esteem seems intuitive, as both capture positive perceptions of the self. In the current undertaking, we provide a broad comparison of the nomological networks of grandiose narcissism and explicit self-esteem. Pooling data from 11 existing samples (N = 4711), we compared the relations of narcissism and self-esteem to developmental experiences, individual differences, interpersonal functioning, and psychopathology. Both constructs are positively related to agentic traits and assertive interpersonal approaches, but differ in relation to agreeableness/communion. Self-esteem emerged as a wholly adaptive construct negatively associated with internalizing psychopathology and generally unrelated to externalizing behaviors. Unlike self-esteem, narcissism was related to callousness, grandiosity, entitlement, and demeaning attitudes towards others that likely partially explain narcissism’s links to maladaptive outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2887938141,"The ventriloquism aftereffect (VAE) refers to a shift in auditory spatial perception following exposure to a spatial disparity between auditory and visual stimuli. The VAE has been previously measured on two distinct time scales. Hundreds or thousands of exposures to a an audio-visual spatial disparity produces enduring VAE that persists after exposure ceases. Exposure to a single audio-visual spatial disparity produces immediate VAE that decays over seconds. To determine if these phenomena are two extremes of a continuum or represent distinct processes, we conducted an experiment with normal hearing listeners that measured VAE in response to a repeated, constant audio-visual disparity sequence, both immediately after exposure to each audio-visual disparity and after the end of the sequence. In each experimental session, subjects were exposed to sequences of auditory and visual targets that were constantly offset by +8° or -8° in azimuth from one another, then localized auditory targets presented in isolation following each sequence. Eye position was controlled throughout the experiment, to avoid the effects of gaze on auditory localization. In contrast to other studies that did not control eye position, we found both a large shift in auditory perception that decayed rapidly after each AV disparity exposure, along with a gradual shift in auditory perception that grew over time and persisted after exposure to the AV disparity ceased. We modeled the temporal and spatial properties of the measured auditory shifts using grey box nonlinear system identification, and found that two models could explain the data equally well. In the power model, the temporal decay of the ventriloquism aftereffect was modeled with a power law relationship. This causes an initial rapid drop in auditory shift, followed by a long tail which accumulates with repeated exposure to audio-visual disparity. In the double exponential model, two separate processes were required to explain the data, one which accumulated and decayed exponentially and the other which slowly integrated over time. Both models fit the data best when the spatial spread of the ventriloquism aftereffect was limited to a window around the location of the audio-visual disparity. We directly compare the predictions made by each model, and suggest additional measurements that could help distinguish which model best describes the mechanisms underlying the VAE."
https://openalex.org/W2885666707,"Background Hypertension accounts for more than 212 million global disability-adjusted life-years, and more than 15 million in sub-Saharan Africa. Identifying factors underlying the escalating burden of hypertension in sub-Saharan Africa may inform delivery of targeted public health interventions. Methods As part of the cross-sectional nationally representative Uganda National Asthma Survey conducted in 2016, we measured blood pressure (BP) in the general population across five regions of Uganda. We defined hypertension as systolic BP ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg, or on-going use of medications for the purpose of lowering BP among adults (≥18 years of age); pre-hypertension as systolic BP between 120 and 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP bteween 80 and 90 mmHg among adolescents and adults (≥12 years of age). Findings Of 3416 participants who met inclusion criteria, 38.9% were male, and mean age ± SD was 33.8 ± 16.9 years. The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of hypertension was 31.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 30.2 to 32.8). The adjusted prevalence of hypertension was highest in the Central Region (34.3%; 95% CI 32.6 to 36.0), and it was comparable to that in the West and East Regions. However, compared with the Central Region, hypertension was significantly less prevalent in the North (22.0%; 95 CI 19.4 to 24.6) and West Nile Regions (24.1%; 95% CI 22.0 to 26.3). Adjustment for demographic characteristics (occupation, monthly income, and educational attainment) of participants did not account for the significantly lower prevalence of hypertension in the North and West Nile Regions. The prevalence of pre-hypertension was 38.8% (95% CI 37.7 to 39.8), and it was highly prevalent among young adults (21–40 years of age: 42.8%; 95% CI 41.2–44.5%) in all regions. Conclusions Hypertension is starkly prevalent in Uganda, and numerous more people, including young adults are at increased risk. The burden of hypertension is highest in the Central, Western, and Eastern regions of the country; demographic characteristics did not fully account for the disparate regional burden of hypertension. Future studies should explore the potential additional impact of epidemiological shifts, including diet and lifestyle changes, on the development of hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2886799297,"Scientific production has increased exponentially in recent years. It is necessary to find methodological strategies for understanding holistic or macro views of the major research trends developed in specific fields. Data mining is a useful technique to address this task. In particular, our study presents a global analysis of the information generated during last decades in the Sport Sciences Category (SSC) included in the Web of Science database. An analysis of the frequency of appearance and the dynamics of the Author Keywords (AKs) has been made for the last thirty years. Likewise, the network of co-occurrences established between words and the survival time of new words that have appeared since 2001 has also been analysed. One of the main findings of our research is the identification of six large thematic clusters in the SSC. There are also two major terms that coexist ('REHABILITATION' and 'EXERCISE') and show a high frequency of appearance, as well as a key behaviour in the calculated co-occurrence networks. Another significant finding is that AKs are mostly accepted in the SSC since there has been high percentage of new terms during 2001–2006, although they have a low survival period. These results support a multidisciplinary perspective within the Sport Sciences field of study and a colonization of the field by rehabilitation according to our AK analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2885210128,"Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (α1AT) Deficiency is a genetic disease in which accumulation of α1AT mutant Z (α1ATZ) protein in the ER of hepatocytes causes chronic liver injury, liver fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. No effective medical therapy is currently available for the disease. We previously found that norUDCA improves the α1AT deficiency associated liver disease by promoting autophagic degradation of α1ATZ protein in liver in a mouse model of the disease. The current study unravels the novel underlying cellular mechanism by which norUDCA modulates autophagy. HTOZ cells, modified from HeLa Tet-Off cells by transfection with the resulting pTRE1-ATZ plasmid and expressing mutant Z proteins, were studied in these experiments. The role of norUDCA in inducing autophagy, autophagy-mediated degradation of α1ATZ and the role of AMPK in norUDCA-induced autophagy were examined in the current report. NorUDCA promoted disposal of α1ATZ via autophagy-mediated degradation of α1ATZ in HTOZ cells. Activation of AMPK was required for norUDCA-induced autophagy and α1ATZ degradation. Moreover, mTOR/ULK1 was involved in norUDCA-induced AMPK activation and autophagy in HTOZ cells. Our results provide novel mechanistic insights into the therapeutic action of norUDCA in promoting the clearance of α1ATZ in vitro and suggest a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of α1ATZ deficiency disease and its associated liver diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2886123139,"Introduction Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex multi-component disorder characterized by progressive irreversible respiratory symptoms and extrapulmonary comorbidities, including anxiety-depression and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the prevalence of these impairments is still uncertain, due to non-optimal screening methods. This observational cross-sectional multicentre study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety-depressive symptoms and MCI in COPD patients, identify the most appropriate cognitive tests to screen MCI, and investigate specific cognitive deficits in these patients and possible predictive factors. Materials and methods Sixty-five stable COPD inpatients (n = 65, aged 69.9±7.6 years, mainly stage III–IV GOLD) underwent the following assessments: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) or Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and a complete neuropsychological battery (ENB-2) including different cognitive domains (attention, memory, executive functions, and perceptive and praxis abilities). Results Moderate-severe anxiety was present in 18.5% of patients and depressive symptoms in 30.7%. The prevalence of MCI varied according to the test: 6.2% (MMSE), 18.5% (MoCA) and 50.8% (ENB-2). In ENB-2, patients performed significantly worse compared to Italian normative data on digit span (5.11±0.9 vs. 5.52±1.0, p = 0.0004), trail making test-B (TMT-B) (176.31±99.5 vs. 135.93±58.0, p = 0.004), overlapping pictures (26.03±8.9 vs. 28.75±8.2, p = 0.018) and copy drawing (1.370.6 vs. 1.61±0.5, p = 0.002). At logistic regression analysis, only COPD severity (p = 0.012, odds ratio, OR, 4.4 [95% CI: 1.4–14.0]) and anxiety symptoms (p = 0.026, OR 4.6 [1.2–17.7]) were significant and independent predictors of the deficit in copy drawing, which assesses visuospatial and praxis skills. Conclusion Given the prevalence of neuropsychological impairments in COPD patients, the routine adoption in rehabilitation of screening tools for mood and cognitive function, including digit span, TMT-B and copy drawing, may be useful to detect psychosocial comorbidities and personalize the rehabilitative program."
https://openalex.org/W2885044340,"Introduction Mechanisms of maintenance of both atrial fibrillation and structural left ventricular disease are known to include fibrosis. Galectin-3, a biomarker of fibrosis, is elevated both in patients with heart failure and persistent atrial fibrillation. We sought to find whether galectin-3 has a prognostic value in patients with heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction undergoing ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation. Methods Serum concentrations of galectin-3 were determined in a consecutive series of patients with an ejection fraction ≤40%, addressed for ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation. Responders to ablation were patients in sinus rhythm and with an ejection fraction ≥50% at 6 months. A combined endpoint of heart failure hospitalization, transplantation and/or death was used at 12 months. Results Seventy-five patients were included (81% male, age 63±10 years, ejection fraction 34±7%, galectin-3 21±12 ng/mL). During follow-up, eight patients were hospitalized for decompensated heart failure, 1 underwent heart transplantation, and 4 died; 50 patients were considered as responders to ablation. After adjustment, galectin-3 level independently predicted both 6-month absence of response to ablation (OR = 0.89 per unit increase, p = 0.002). Patients with galectin-3 levels <26 had a 95% 1-year event-free survival versus 46% in patients with galectin-3 ≥26 ng/mL (p<0.0001). Conclusions Galectin-3 levels independently predict outcomes in patients with reduced left ventricular systolic function addressed for ablation of persistent AF, and may be of interest in defining the therapeutic strategy in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2885317503,"The Frontal Aslant Tract (FAT) is a tract recently described as having implications on language function. The originally proposed anatomical FAT definition characterizes a connection between Broca's territory and anterior supplementary and pre-supplementary motor areas in the Superior Frontal Gyrus (SFG). Here we propose an extended definition of the FAT (the exFAT) that propagates more anteriorly into the SFG. A sample of 834 subjects from the WU-Minn HCP 900 subjects data release (S900) was selected. The bilateral exFATs were reconstructed for the whole sample using an automated pipeline and thresholded adjusted tract volumes were calculated. A laterality test was performed on the whole sample. The frontal cortex has known implications on superior cognitive functions, so here we evaluate the implications of exFAT volume on performance in a language task and on a set of working memory tasks. Two sub-samples of 70 subjects each were drawn from the S900 sample by selecting the 35 top-performers and 35 bottom-performers for both language and working memory tasks. Additional laterality tests were performed on each subsample. We did not find the exFAT to be lateralized in any of the samples. We found statistically significant differences in left adjusted exFAT volume between top-performers and bottom-performers in the language task. We also found statistically significant differences in right adjusted exFAT volume between top-performers and bottom-performers for 2-back working memory tasks. To check for the predictive power of the exFAT volumes as correlates for performance, we ran a repeated random sub-sampling cross-validation procedure based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier that was capable of correctly classifying holdout subjects to their corresponding group (top-performer vs bottom-performer) with an average accuracy of 74.5% for language task performance based on left exFAT volume and an accuracy of 64.2% for Working Memory performance based on right exFAT volume."
https://openalex.org/W2885851265,"Auxin response factors (ARF) are important transcription factors which mediate the transcription of auxin responsive genes by binding directly to auxin response elements (AuxREs) found in the promoter regions of these genes. To date, no information has been available about the genome-wide organization of the ARF transcription factor family in physic nut. In this study, 17 ARF genes (JcARFs) are identified in the physic nut genome. A detailed investigation into the physic nut ARF gene family is performed, including analysis of the exon-intron structure, conserved domains, conserved motifs, phylogeny, chromosomal locations, potential small RNA targets and expression profiles under various conditions. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the 17 JcARF proteins are clustered into 6 groups, and most JcARF proteins from the physic nut reveal closer relationships with those from Arabidopsis than those from rice. Of the 17 JcARF genes, eight are predicted to be the potential targets of small RNAs; most of the genes show differential patterns of expression among four tissues (root, stem cortex, leaf, and seed); and qRT-PCR indicates that the expression of all JcARF genes is inhibited or induced in response to exogenous auxin. Expression profile analysis based on RNA-seq data shows that in leaves, 11 of the JcARF genes respond to at least one abiotic stressor (drought and/or salinity) at, as a minimum, at least one time point. Our results provide valuable information for further studies on the roles of JcARF genes in regulating physic nut's growth, development and responses to abiotic stress."
https://openalex.org/W2886893080,"To cope with intrinsic and environmental stress, cancer cells rely on adaptive pathways more than non-transformed counterparts. Such non-oncogene addiction offers new therapeutic targets and strategies to overcome chemoresistance. In an attempt to study the role of adaptive pathways in acquired drug resistance in carcinoma cells, we devised a model of in vitro conditioning to three standard chemotherapeutic agents, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and docetaxel, from the epithelial cancer cell line, HEp-2, and investigated the mechanisms underlying reduced drug sensitivity. We found that triple-resistant cells suffered from higher levels of oxidative stress, and showed heightened anti-stress responses, including the antioxidant Nrf2 pathway and autophagy, a conserved pleiotropic homeostatic strategy, mediating the clearance of aggregates marked by the adapter p62/SQSTM1. As a result, re-administration of chemotherapeutic agents failed to induce further accumulation of reactive oxygen species and p62. Moreover, autophagy proved responsible for chemoresistance through the avoidance of p62 accumulation into toxic protein aggregates. Indeed, p62 ablation was sufficient to confer resistance in parental cells, and genetic and pharmacological autophagic inhibition restored drug sensitivity in resistant cells in a p62-dependent manner. Finally, exogenous expression of mutant p62 lacking the ubiquitin- and LC3-binding domains, required for autophagic engulfment, increased chemosensitivity in TDR HEp-2 cells. Altogether, these findings offer a cellular system to investigate the bases of acquired chemoresistance of epithelial cancers and encourage challenging the prognostic and antineoplastic therapeutic potential of p62 toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2887573618,"Ligamentum flavum (LF) hypertrophy in lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LSCS) is characterized by a loss of elastic fibers and fibrosis. Chronic inflammation is thought to be responsible for the histological change but the mechanism underlying elastic fiber degradation remains unclear. Given that matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 have elastolytic activity and are partly regulated by inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, in this study, we investigated whether MMPs mediate LF degeneration using 52 LF samples obtained during lumbar surgery, including 31 LSCS and 21 control specimens. We confirmed by histological analysis that the LSCS samples exhibited severe degenerative changes compared with the controls. We found that MMP-2 was upregulated in LF tissue from patients with LSCS at the mRNA and protein levels, whereas MMP-9 expression did not differ between the two groups. The MMP-2 level was positively correlated with LF thickness and negatively correlated with the area occupied by elastic fibers. IL-6 mRNA expression was also increased in LF tissue from patients with LSCS and positively correlated with that of MMP-2. Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3, a component of the IL-6 signaling pathway, was activated in hypertrophied LF tissues. Our in vitro experiments using fibroblasts from LF tissue revealed that IL-6 increased MMP-2 expression, secretion, and activation via induction of STAT3 signaling, and this effect was reversed by STAT3 inhibitor treatment. Moreover, elastin degradation was promoted by IL-6 stimulation in LF fibroblast culture medium. These results indicate that MMP-2 induction by IL-6/STAT3 signaling in LF fibroblasts can degrade elastic fibers, leading to LF degeneration in LSCS."
https://openalex.org/W2886049312,"Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and diffuse tenderness, accompanied by complaints including morning stiffness, fatigue, insomnia and affective symptoms. In addition, affected patients frequently experience cognitive impairments such as concentration difficulties, forgetfulness or problems in planning and decision-making. These deficits are commonly ascribed to interference between nociceptive and cognitive processing.The present study investigated the association of cognitive performance with (a) pain responses to low intensity pressure stimulation (0.45-2.25 kg/cm2), (b) responses to stronger (above-threshold) stimulation (2.70 kg/cm2), and (c) pain threshold and tolerance in 42 women with FMS. Tests of attention, memory, processing speed, and executive functions were applied.While no significant correlations were seen for pain threshold and pain tolerance, inverse associations arose between pain intensity ratings during pressure stimulation and performance in all evaluated cognitive domains. The magnitude of the correlations increased with decreasing stimulus intensity.It may be concluded that pain experience during somatosensory stimulation of low intensity is more closely related to attention, memory and executive functions in FMS than the traditional measures of pain threshold and pain tolerance. Considering that pain responses to low intensity stimulation reflect the hyperalgesia and allodynia phenomena characterizing FMS, it may be hypothesized that central nervous pain sensitization is involved in cognitive impairments in the disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2887075703,"Public transport passenger demand is inevitably made non-uniform because of spatial and temporal land use planning. This non-uniformity warrants the use of public transport operational strategies to attain operating efficiency. The optimization of these strategies is commonly being done from the operator perspective, and indirectly from the user perspective. However, the environmental perspective of these strategies, in terms of vehicle’s emission, has not been investigated. This study proposed a methodology to analyze the benefits of using transit operational strategies to reduce operating cost and eventually also to reduce undesirable emissions. First, a strategy-based optimization model is established to minimize the number of transit vehicles required. Four candidate operational strategies are considered in this model, including full route operation (FRO), short turn, limited stop, and a combination of limited stop and short turn. Second, the pollutant emissions of transit vehicles are estimated by the MOVES emission model. The developed methodology is applied to a real life case study in Dalian, China. Results show that the use of operational strategies can not only significantly save the number of vehicles by 12.5%, but also reduce emissions of pollutants (i.e., CO2, HC, CO, NOx, PM2.5) by approximately 13%, compared with applying FRO strategy exclusively. In addition, both benefits can be further enhanced through the use of an efficient payment mode (e.g., off-board or contactless card) or improving bus performance in deceleration/acceleration as well as doors opening and closing at a stop."
https://openalex.org/W2885149657,"The autoimmune disease primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is characterized by hypofunction of the salivary glands (SGs), the cause of which is not correlated to lymphocytic SG infiltration, as prevailing dogma often states. We knocked out the NF-κB proinflammatory pathway inhibitor A20 in keratin14+ epithelial cells, to investigate if immune activated epithelial cells are capable of initiating pSS SG hallmarks. We show that immune activated epithelial cells can cause T cell dominated leukocytic infiltration and immune foci development of the SGs, reflecting the early clinical picture. Infiltrating leukocytes invaded striated ducts, similar to early stage lymphoepithelial lesions observed clinically. Expression of proinflammatory cyto-/chemokines IFNɣ, TNFα, IL-6, CXCL10 and CXCL13 increased in A20-/- SGs, and functionally both volume and mucin 10 content of whole stimulated saliva from A20-/- mice was significantly reduced. Epithelial cells may therefore represent the initial trigger for pSS SG pathologies, as opposed to simple reactionaries to pre-existing stimuli."

However, the effectiveness of PES as an instrument to achieve these multiple objectives, in particular in a conservation-development context, is often questioned. This study adds to the very limited empirical evidence base and investigates to what extent Vietnam’s move to PES has helped protect forest ecosystems and improve local livelihoods and income inequality. We zoom in on Lam Dong province, where PES was first introduced in Vietnam in 2009. Changes in forest cover are analysed using satellite images over a period of 15 years (2000–2014). Socio-economic impacts are assessed based on rural household interviews with PES participants and non-participants as a control group over a period of 7 years (2008–2014). Our results show that PES contributes significantly to forest cover, the improvement of local livelihoods, and the reduction of income inequality."

It is therefore crucial to understand how building professionals, including designers, engineers, and contractors, view smart and sustainable buildings and what drives them towards smart and sustainable building technologies. This study identifies salient smart and sustainable building features from building professionals' perspective and explores what determines building professionals' intention to use such building technologies. Responses from 543 Hong Kong's building professionals identify that intelligent security, intelligent and responsive fresh air supply, and intelligent and responsive thermal control are among the most important features of smart and sustainable buildings. Results of structural equation modeling grounded on an extended technology acceptance model indicate that facilitating condition and job relevance are related to perceived ease of use while subjective norm pertaining to image and perceived ease of use are predictors of perceived usefulness. Facilitating condition, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness jointly influence building professionals' intention to use smart and sustainable building technologies."
https://openalex.org/W2887618223,"Previous research offers limited understanding as to why sickness absence is higher among women than among men, but attitudes and norms have been suggested as plausible explanations of this gender gap. The purpose of the present study is to examine whether the gender gap in sickness absence reflects gender differences in sickness absence attitudes or gendered norms of sickness absence in society. The analyses are based on data from a factorial survey experiment covering 1,800 male and female employed respondents in Norway in 2016. Each participant was asked to evaluate whether sick leave would be reasonable in six unique, hypothetical sickness absence scenarios (i.e. vignettes) in which occupation, gender and reason for sick leave varied. Sick leave judgments were regressed on respondent gender and vignette gender using binary logistic regressions across three cut points. Overall, we did not find a substantial gender difference in either attitudes towards sickness absence or sickness absence norms. However, further analyses indicated more tolerant social norms of sickness absence for employees in gender-dominated occupations than for employees in gender-integrated occupations. This pattern could be a result of the type of work attributed to these occupations rather than their gender composition. Contrary to popular belief, we conclude that widely held attitudes and norms of sickness absence are unlikely to be drivers of the gender gap in sickness absence. The results can be useful for policies and interventions aimed at safeguarding gender equality in the labour market."
https://openalex.org/W2885704525,"Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder caused by prenatal alcohol exposure includes ocular abnormalities (microphthalmia, photoreceptor dysfunction, cataracts). Zebrafish embryos exposed to ethanol from gastrulation through somitogenesis show severe ocular defects, including microphthalmia and photoreceptor differentiation defects. Ethanol-treated zebrafish had an enlarged ciliary marginal zone (CMZ) relative to the retina size and reduced Müller glial cells (MGCs). Ethanol exposure produced immature photoreceptors with increased proliferation, indicating cell cycle exit failure. Signaling mechanisms in the CMZ were affected by embryonic ethanol exposure, including Wnt signaling in the CMZ, Notch signaling and neurod gene expression. Retinoic acid or folic acid co-supplementation with ethanol rescued Wnt signaling and retinal differentiation. Activating Wnt signaling using GSK3 inhibitor (LSN 2105786; Eli Lilly and Co.) restored retinal cell differentiation pathways. Ethanol exposed embryos were treated with Wnt agonist, which rescued Wnt-active cells in the CMZ, Notch-active cells in the retina, proliferation, and photoreceptor terminal differentiation. Our results illustrate the critical role of Wnt signaling in ethanol-induced retinal defects."
https://openalex.org/W2886433106,"Gut microbiome communicates with the host liver to modify hepatic xenobiotic biotransformation and nutrient homeostasis. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are persistent environmental contaminants that are detected in fatty food, household dust, and human breast milk at worrisome levels. Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been recognized as novel biomarkers for toxicological responses and may regulate the transcriptional/translational output of protein-coding genes (PCGs). However, very little is known regarding to what extent the interactions between PBDEs and gut microbiome modulate hepatic lncRNAs and PCGs, and what critical signaling pathways are impacted at the transcriptomic scale. In this study, we performed RNA-Seq in livers of nine-week-old male conventional (CV) and germ-free (GF) mice orally exposed to the most prevalent PBDE congeners BDE-47 and BDE-99 (100 μmol/kg once daily for 4-days; vehicle: corn oil, 10 ml/kg), and unveiled key molecular pathways and PCG-lncRNA pairs targeted by PBDE-gut microbiome interactions. Lack of gut microbiome profoundly altered the PBDE-mediated transcriptomic response in liver, with the most prominent effect observed in BDE-99-exposed GF mice. The top pathways up-regulated by PBDEs were related to xenobiotic metabolism, whereas the top pathways down-regulated by PBDEs were in lipid metabolism and protein synthesis in both enterotypes. Genomic annotation of the differentially regulated lncRNAs revealed that majority of these lncRNAs overlapped with introns and 3’-UTRs of PCGs. Lack of gut microbiome profoundly increased the percentage of PBDE-regulated lncRNAs mapped to the 3’-UTRs of PCGs, suggesting the potential involvement of lncRNAs in increasing the translational efficiency of PCGs by preventing miRNA-3’-UTR binding, as a compensatory mechanism following toxic exposure to PBDEs. Pathway analysis of PCGs paired with lncRNAs revealed that in CV mice, BDE-47 regulated nucleic acid and retinol metabolism, as well as circadian rhythm; whereas BDE-99 regulated fatty acid metabolism. In GF mice, BDE-47 differentially regulated 19 lncRNA-PCG pairs that were associated with glutathione conjugation and transcriptional regulation. In contrast, BDE-99 up-regulated the xenobiotic-metabolizing Cyp3a genes, but down-regulated the fatty acid-metabolizing Cyp4 genes. Taken together, the present study reveals common and unique lncRNAs and PCG targets of PBDEs in mouse liver, and is among the first to show that lack of gut microbiome sensitizes the liver to toxic exposure of BDE-99 but not BDE-47. Therefore, lncRNAs may serve as specific biomarkers that differentiate various PBDE congeners as well as environmental chemical-mediated dysbiosis. Coordinate regulation of PCG-lncRNA pairs may serve as a more efficient molecular mechanism to combat against xenobiotic insult, and especially during dysbiosis-induced increase in the internal dose of toxicants."
https://openalex.org/W2886889919,"Background Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulation, a measure of cumulative metabolic stress, constitute a novel pathogenic mechanism involved in aging, diabetes, cardiovascular (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Despite removal of uremic toxins and AGEs after a successful renal transplant (RT), CVD remains the leading cause of mortality. We hypothesized that AGEs measurement by Skin Autofluorescence (SAF) might be useful even after a successful RT and thus reflect the high cardiovascular risk burden of these patients. Methods 189 stable RT (61% men, aged 56±13.0 years), CKD stages 1–4 and >12 months since RT were enrolled. Variables collected comprised comorbid history, medication use, smoking habit, routine biochemistry, subclinical atheromatosis by ankle-brachial-index (ABI) and allograft resistivity index (RI), 24-h ABPM, anthropometry and handgrip strength. AGEs were measured by SAF and expressed in arbitrary units (AU). Vascular age was estimated by Koetsier´s formula (SAF-0.83/0.024) and expected 10-years cardiovascular death risk was calculated with the REGICOR score. Results Mean SAF was 3.00±0.83 AU and estimated vascular age 90±34.7 years (30 years above biological age). SAF was higher among men (3.10±0.91 vs 2.81±0.66), diabetic nephropathy (3.49±0.75 vs 2.96±0.83) and steroid users (3.14±0.86 vs 2.71±0.69). We observed a positive correlation of SAF with night-systolic blood pressure (r = 0.25, p = 0.001), parathormone (r = 0.20, p<0.01), phosphate (r = 0.28, p<0.001) and negative with hemoglobin (r = -0.29, p<0.001), CKD-EPI (r = -0.32, p<0.001), albumin (r = -0.17, p<0.05), and dynamometry (r = -0.20, p<0.01). Subclinical vascular atheromatosis (ABI and RI) as well as the REGICOR scale (r = 0.35 p<0.001) were also correlated with SAF. In multivariable analysis age, gender, steroid use, serum phosphate and handgrip strength remained independently associated with SAF. Conclusions SAF levels are elevated in RT patients and correlate with CVD risk. Besides age and male sex, our results suggest that phosphate overload, steroid use and nutritional status are important factors linking to AGEs accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2886911064,"The carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) family includes CPT 1 and CPT 2 that transport long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondrial compartment for β-oxidation. In this study, three isoforms (CPT 1α, CPT 1β and CPT 2) of the CPT family were cloned from Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) and their complete coding sequences (CDS) were obtained. Sequence analysis revealed deduced amino acid sequences of 915, 775 and 683 amino acids, respectively. Gene expression analysis revealed a broad tissue distribution for all three isoforms, with high CPT 1α and CPT 2 mRNA levels in the hepatopancreas of males and females. In males, CPT 1β was highly expressed in gill, heart, brain ganglia and muscle, while in females, CPT 1β-mRNA levels were relatively high in muscle, hepatopancreas and ovary tissue. The effects of dietary fish oil replacement on the expression of the three CPT isoforms in the hepatopancreas during gonadal development were investigated using five experimental diets formulated with replacement of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% fish oil by 1:1 rapeseed oil: soybean oil. The results showed that Diets 2# and 5# yielded higher CPT 1α and CPT 2 mRNA expression in males (P < 0.05), while in females, expression of all three CPT isoforms increased then declined in the hepatopancreas with increasing dietary fish oil replacement. The observed changes in CPT gene expression varied in different isoforms and gender, suggesting the three CPT genes might play different roles in fatty acid β-oxidation in E. sinensis."
https://openalex.org/W2950393658,"Retroviral protease inhibitors (RPIs) such as lopinavir (LP) and saquinavir (SQ) are active against Plasmodium parasites. However, the exact molecular target(s) for these RPIs in the Plasmodium parasites remains poorly understood. We hypothesised that LP and SQ suppress parasite growth through inhibition of aspartyl proteases. Using reverse genetics approach, we embarked on separately generating knockout (KO) parasite lines lacking Plasmepsin 4 (PM4), PM7, PM8, or DNA damage-inducible protein 1 (Ddi1) in the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei ANKA. We then tested the suppressive profiles of the LP/Ritonavir (LP/RT) and SQ/RT as well as antimalarials; Amodiaquine (AQ) and Piperaquine (PQ) against the KO parasites in the standard 4-day suppressive test. The Ddi1 gene proved refractory to deletion suggesting that the gene is essential for the growth of the asexual blood stage parasites. Our results revealed that deletion of PM4 significantly reduces normal parasite growth rate phenotype (P = 0.003). Unlike PM4_KO parasites which were less susceptible to LP and SQ (P = 0.036, P = 0.030), the suppressive profiles for PM7_KO and PM8_KO parasites were comparable to those for the WT parasites. This finding suggests a potential role of PM4 in the LP and SQ action. On further analysis, modelling and molecular docking studies revealed that both LP and SQ displayed high binding affinities (-6.3 kcal/mol to -10.3 kcal/mol) towards the Plasmodium aspartyl proteases. We concluded that PM4 plays a vital role in assuring asexual stage parasite fitness and might be mediating LP and SQ action. The essential nature of the Ddi1 gene warrants further studies to evaluate its role in the parasite asexual blood stage growth as well as a possible target for the RPIs."
https://openalex.org/W2887508098,"Background We investigated the association between the consumer attitudes of European parents and their children’s taste preferences and food choice. Furthermore, we studied whether the parental consumer attitudes were related to education level. Methods This analysis included 1,407 IDEFICS study children aged 6.0 to 11.8 years and from 7 European countries, who participated in the sensory taste perception module between 2007 and 2010. Parental consumer attitude was operationalized as ‘trusting in foods known from advertisements’ (trusting advertisements) and as ‘not avoiding additives in food’ (not avoiding additives). Parents reported their educational attainment and completed a food frequency questionnaire for their children. Consumption frequencies of sweet, fatty and processed foods as well as a healthy diet adherence score were calculated. Children performed fat, sweet and umami taste preference tests. Multivariable logistic models were used to analyse the association between parental consumer attitudes and their children’s taste preference frequencies as well as parental education. Linear regression models were used to analyse the association between parental consumer attitudes and their children’s food consumption. Results Parental consumer attitudes were not associated with children’s fat, sweet and umami taste preferences. Children of parents trusting advertisements consumed more frequently processed foods (β = 1.21, 95% CI: 0.49; 1.93). Children of parents not avoiding additives consumed more often sweet, fatty and processed foods and had a lower healthy diet adherence score (β = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.03; 3.70; β = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.12; 3.43; β = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.22; 1.59; β = -2.87, 95% CI: -3.89; -1.85, respectively). Unfavourable parental consumer attitudes were associated with a lower parental education level across Europe (Compared to high education: Odds Ratio (OR) of trusting advertisements with medium education: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.77; 1.40; OR with low education: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.15; 3.54; OR of not avoiding additives with medium education: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.44; 2.54; OR with low education: 1.76, 95% CI: 0.96; 3.24). Conclusions Across Europe, unfavourable parental consumer attitudes are associated with a lower diet quality of their children. Parental consumer attitudes in turn were associated with their own level of education. This has implications for policy makers, interventions and health promotion programmes that aim to promote healthy eating."
https://openalex.org/W2887166975,"Four of the nine sigmodontine tribes have species that serve as reservoirs of rodent-borne hantaviruses (RBO-HV), few have been studied in any depth. Several viruses have been associated with human cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome often through peridomestic exposure. Jabora (JABV) and Juquitiba (JUQV), harbored by Akodon montensis and Oligoryzomys nigripes, respectively, are endemic and sympatric in the Reserva Natural de Bosque Mbaracayú (RNBM), Paraguay, a protected area of the Interior Atlantic Forest. Rodent communities were surveyed along a 30 km stretch of the RNBM in eight vegetation classifications (Low, High, Bamboo, Riparian and Liana Forests, Bamboo Understory, Cerrado, and Meadow/Grasslands). We collected 417 rodents from which 11 species were identified; Akodon montensis was the predominant species (72%; 95%CI: 64.7%-76.3%), followed by Hylaeamys megacephalus (15% (11.2%-18.2%)) and Oligoryzomys nigripes (9% (6.6%-12.4%)). We examined the statistical associations among habitat (vegetation class) type, rodent species diversity, population structure (age, sex, and weight), and prevalence of RBO-HV antibody and/or viral RNA (Ab/RNA) or characteristic Leishmania tail lesions. Ab/RNA positive rodents were not observed in Cerrado and Low Forest. A. montensis had an overall Ab/RNA prevalence of 7.7% (4.9%-11.3%) and O. nigripes had an overall prevalence of 8.6% (1.8%-23.1%). For A. montensis, the odds of being Ab/RNA positive in High Forest was 3.73 times of the other habitats combined. There was no significant difference among age classes in the proportion of Ab/RNA positive rodents overall (p = 0.66), however, all 11 RNA-positive individuals were adult. Sex and habitat had independent prognostic value for hantaviral Ab/RNA in the study population; age, presence of tail scar/lesion (19% of the rodents) and weight did not. Adjusting for habitat, female rodents had less risk of becoming infected. Importantly, these data suggest habitat preferences of two sympatric rodent reservoirs for two endemic hantaviruses and the importance of including habitat in models of species diversity and habitat fragmentation."
https://openalex.org/W2886470350,"Diversity patterns of the deep-sea megafauna in the Caribbean Basin and the Guiana ecoregion were analyzed in order to test the hypothesis of species richness variation as a function of depth and the hypothesis of non-differences between ecoregions by analyzing spatial patterns of five taxa and a merged assemblage. Collections of five taxa (corals, sea stars, sea urchins, sea lilies and gastropods) were obtained from seven oceanographic expeditions aboard the R/V Pillsbury at 310 stations between 60 and 7500 m depth. Data were sorted according to depth zones and ecoregions and were analyzed in order to estimate species richness, changes in species composition and distinction of β-diversity by species turnover or by nestedness. The observed patterns of diversity were consistent between taxa and their assemblage: Species richness increased from the continental shelf (60–200 m deep) to the slope (200–2000 m deep), followed by a decrease at the continental rise-abyssal zone. We detected marked changes in species composition according to depth ranges. Changes in species composition in relation to ecoregions were also detected. In general, the Caribbean Basin lacks important physical barriers, causing high deep-sea ecosystem connectivity; however, variation in composition could be related to changes in environmental conditions associated with productivity and/or continental influences."
https://openalex.org/W2886867727,"The sequence space of five protein superfamilies was investigated by constructing sequence networks. The nodes represent individual sequences, and two nodes are connected by an edge if the global sequence identity of two sequences exceeds a threshold. The networks were characterized by their degree distribution (number of nodes with a given number of neighbors) and by their fractal network dimension. Although the five protein families differed in sequence length, fold, and domain arrangement, their network properties were similar. The fractal network dimension Df was distance-dependent: a high dimension for single and double mutants (Df = 4.0), which dropped to Df = 0.7–1.0 at 90% sequence identity, and increased to Df = 3.5–4.5 below 70% sequence identity. The distance dependency of the network dimension is consistent with evolutionary constraints for functional proteins. While random single and double mutations often result in a functional protein, the accumulation of more than ten mutations is dominated by epistasis. The networks of the five protein families were highly inhomogeneous with few highly connected communities (""hub sequences"") and a large number of smaller and less connected communities. The degree distributions followed a power-law distribution with similar scaling exponents close to 1. Because the hub sequences have a large number of functional neighbors, they are expected to be robust toward possible deleterious effects of mutations. Because of their robustness, hub sequences have the potential of high innovability, with additional mutations readily inducing new functions. Therefore, they form hotspots of evolution and are promising candidates as starting points for directed evolution experiments in biotechnology."
https://openalex.org/W2887709043,"When we observe a dynamic emotional facial expression, we usually automatically anticipate how that expression will develop. Our objective was to study a neurocognitive biomarker of this anticipatory process for facial pain expressions, operationalized as a mismatch effect. For this purpose, we studied the behavioral and neuroelectric (Event-Related Potential, ERP) correlates, of a match or mismatch, between the intensity of an expression of pain anticipated by the participant, and the intensity of a static test expression of pain displayed with the use of a representational momentum paradigm. Here, the paradigm consisted in displaying a dynamic facial pain expression which suddenly disappeared, and participants had to memorize the final intensity of the dynamic expression. We compared ERPs in response to congruent (intensity the same as the one memorized) and incongruent (intensity different from the one memorized) static expression intensities displayed after the dynamic expression. This paradigm allowed us to determine the amplitude and direction of this intensity anticipation by measuring the observer’s memory bias. Results behaviorally showed that the anticipation was backward (negative memory bias) for high intensity expressions of pain (participants expected a return to a neutral state) and more forward (memory bias less negative, or even positive) for less intense expressions (participants expected increased intensity). Detecting mismatch (incongruent intensity) led to faster responses than detecting match (congruent intensity). The neuroelectric correlates of this mismatch effect in response to the testing of expression intensity ranged from P100 to LPP (Late Positive Potential). Path analysis and source localization suggested that the medial frontal gyrus was instrumental in mediating the mismatch effect through top-down influence on both the occipital and temporal regions. Moreover, having the facility to detect incongruent expressions, by anticipating emotional state, could be useful for prosocial behavior and the detection of trustworthiness."
https://openalex.org/W2887722121,"As cognitive-driven worsening of activities of the daily living (ADL) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is the core feature of PD dementia (PDD), there is great need for sensitive quantitative assessment. Aim of our study was the evaluation of cognitive-driven worsening of ADL by the performance-based Multiple Object Test (MOT), offering an essential clinical advantage as it is quick and easy to apply in a clinical context even on severely impaired patients.73 PD patients were assessed longitudinally over a period of 37 (6-49) months. According to their neuropsychological profile the sample was divided into two groups: PD patients with (n = 34, PD-CI) and without cognitive impairment (n = 39, PD-noCI). The MOT comprises five routine tasks (e.g. to make coffee) quick and easy to apply. Quantitative (total error number, processing time) and qualitative parameters (error type) were analyzed using non-parametric test statistic (e.g.Wilcoxon signed-rank test, binary logistic regression).Median number of total errors (p = 0.001), processing time (p<0.001), perplexity (p = 0.035), and omission errors (p<0.001) increased significantly from baseline to follow-up in the total sample. Worsening of MOT performance was correlated to cognitive decline in the attention/ executive function and visuo-constructive domain. PD-CI showed an increase in omission errors (p = 0.027) compared to PD-noCI over time. This increase in omission errors between visits was further identified as a risk marker for PDD conversion.The MOT, especially frequency of omission errors, is a promising tool to rate PD patients objectively and might help to identify patients with a high risk for having mild cognitive impairment or dementia."
https://openalex.org/W2887524843,"Dengue has been spreading in Thailand for more than 50 years, and the community prevention of dengue transmission is an important strategy to help reduce outbreaks. The larval indices surveillance system is one of the most significant prevention methods at the household and district levels.This study sought to develop a larval indices surveillance system based on a specific community context.Community participation action research (CPAR) studies represent a new approach to studying the high-risk dengue area of Lansaka district, Nakhon Si Thammarat province, Thailand. This study was conducted for 2 years (from 2013 to 2015) and applied the integrated concepts of 1) community capacity building, 2) epidemiology, 3) research design for health development, and 4) an online computer program. The method included five phases: 1) community preparation, 2) situation assessment, 3) the development of the surveillance system, 4) implementation, and 5) evaluation.The model was designed in partnership with all the stakeholders from 44 villages across 5 sub-districts. The surveillance system consisted of seven steps at the household level based on primary care surveillance centers (PCSCs), as well as four components at the district level based on district surveillance centers (DSCs). The dengue morbidity rate decreased from 164, 151, and 135 cases/100,000 people in 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. Moreover, knowledge of both dengue and larval indices among village health volunteers (VHVs) increased significantly (p < .01).The results from the new system showed a decrease in both the larval indices level and morbidity rate; however, the levels remained higher than the standard. The active surveillance system requires continuous monitoring at both the household and district levels."
https://openalex.org/W2887542818,"Cholera is endemic in the Eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 1978, and Uvira in South-Kivu has been reporting suspected cholera cases nearly every week for over a decade. The clinical case definition for suspected cholera is relatively non-specific, and cases are rarely confirmed by laboratory methods, especially in endemic settings. This may lead to over-estimation of cholera cases and limit effective public health responses.Between April 2016 and November 2017, 69% of the 2,059 patients admitted to the Uvira Cholera Treatment Centre (CTC) were tested for cholera with rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Of those admitted as suspected cholera cases, only 40% tested positive for cholera, equivalent to an estimated annual incidence of suspected/confirmed cholera in Uvira of 43.8 and 16.3 cases per 10,000 inhabitants respectively. A multivariable logistic regression indicates that boys aged 2 to 4 years, girls aged 5 to 15 years and adult men are respectively 1.9, 2.1 and 1.8 times more likely to test positive than adult women. On the contrary, boys under 2 are 10 times less likely to test positive. The odds of testing positive also increase as weekly admissions to the CTC rise, with up to a 5-fold increase observed during the weeks with the highest numbers of admissions compared to the lowest ones. Other predictors of cholera confirmation include duration of stay at the CTC, clinical outcome of admission, lower weekly rainfall and area of residence in Uvira, with the northern part of town having the highest confirmation rate.Cholera is an on-going public health problem in Uvira but the majority of suspected cases admitted to the CTC were found to be negative for cholera after RDT testing. These findings may have important implications for cholera control strategies in favour of interventions that address cholera and other diarrhoeal diseases alike."
https://openalex.org/W2886262144,"Background The age-standardized incidence of stroke has decreased globally but, for reasons unknown, conflicting results have been observed regarding trend in incidence of major stroke subtypes in young adults. We studied these trends among people of working age in a population-based setting in Finland, where cardiovascular risk factor profiles have developed favorably. Methods All hospitalizations for stroke in 2004–2005 and 2013–2014 for persons 18–64 years of age were identified from a national register. The search included all hospitals that provide acute stroke care on mainland Finland. Results Hospitalizations for both intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH; -15.2%; p = 0.0008) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH; -26.5%; p<0.0001) decreased overall and for both sexes separately. Concerning IS, hospitalizations decreased only for men (-6.3%; p = 0.0190) but not for women or overall. However, there was an increase in IS hospitalizations in men 35–44 years of age (+37.5%; p = 0.0019). The length of stay (LOS) of IS patients declined in nearly all subgroups (overall -20.8%, p<0.0001) whereas no change in LOS was observed for patients with ICH or SAH. In-hospital mortality decreased in patients with IS (-42.8%; p = 0.0092) but remained unchanged in patients with ICH or SAH. Conclusions Stroke hospitalizations of young people declined in Finland, except for men 35–44 years of age for whom IS hospitalizations increased. Declining LOS and in-hospital mortality of IS patients suggests admission of less severe cases, improved care or both."
https://openalex.org/W2887461242,"Understanding the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has so far resulted from two main approaches: the analysis of species' functional traits, and the analysis of species interaction networks. Here we propose a third approach, based on the association between combinations of species or of functional groups, which we term assembly motifs, and observed ecosystem functioning. Each assembly motif describes a biotic environment in which species interactions have particular effects on a given ecosystem function. Clustering species in functional groups generates a classification of ecosystems based on their assembly motif. We evaluate the quality of each species clustering, that is its ability to predict an ecosystem function, by the coefficient of determination of the ecosystem classification. An iterative process then enables identifying the species clustering in functional groups that best accounts for the functioning of the observed ecosystems. We test this approach using experimental and simulated datasets. We show that our combinatorial analysis makes it possible to identify the combinations of functional groups of species whose interactions govern ecosystem functioning without any a priori knowledge of the species themselves or their interactions. Our combinatorial approach reproduces the associative learning of empirical ecologists, and proves to be powerful and parsimonious."
https://openalex.org/W2886402640,"Urbanization is associated with higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease worldwide. Aortic stiffness, as measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity is a validated predictor of cardiovascular disease. Our objective was to determine the association between urbanization and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. The analysis included 6166 participants enrolled in an ongoing population-based study (mean age 42 years; 58% female) who live in an 80 × 80 km region of southern India. Multiple measures of urbanization were used and compared: 1) census designations, 2) satellite derived land cover (crops, grass, shrubs or trees as rural; built-up areas as urban), and 3) distance categories based on proximity to an urban center. The association between urbanization and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity was tested in sex-stratified linear regression models. People residing in urban areas had significantly (p < 0.05) elevated mean carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity compared to non-urban populations after adjustment for other risk factors. There was also an inverse association between distance from the urban center and mean carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity: each 10 km increase in distance was associated with a decrease in mean carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity of 0.07 m/s (95% CI: -0.09, -0.06 m/s). The association was stronger among older participants, among smokers, and among those with other cardiovascular risk factors. Further research is needed to determine which components in the urban environment are associated with higher carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity."
https://openalex.org/W2886536201,"Fructose consumption causes metabolic diseases and renal injury primarily in the renal cortex where fructose is metabolized. Analyzing gene differential expression induced by dietary manipulation is challenging. The effects may depend on the base diet and primary changes likely induce secondary or higher order changes that are difficult to capture by conventional univariate transcriptome analyses. We hypothesized that dietary fructose induces a genetic program in the kidney cortex that favors lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis. To test this, we analyzed renal cortical transcriptomes of rats on normal- and high-salt base diets supplemented with fructose. Both sets of data were analyzed using the Characteristic Direction method to yield fructose-induced gene vectors of associated differential expression values. A fructose-specific ""signature"" of 139 genes differentially expressed was extracted from the 2 diet vectors by a new algorithm that takes into account a gene's rank and standard deviation of its differential expression value. Of these genes, 97 were annotated and the top 34 accounted for 80% of the signal in the annotated signature. The genes were predominantly proximal tubule-specific, coding for metabolic enzymes or transporters. Cosine similarity of signature genes in the two fructose-induced vectors was >0.78. These 139 genes of the fructose signature contributed 27% and 38% of total differential expression on normal- and high- salt diet, respectively. Principal Component Analysis showed that the individual animals could be grouped according to diet. The fructose signature contained a greater enrichment of Gene Ontology processes related to nutrition and metabolism of fructose than two univariate analysis methods. The major feature of the fructose signature is a change in metabolic programs of the renal proximal tubule consistent with gluconeogenesis and de-novo lipogenesis. This new ""signature"" constitutes a new metric to bridge the gap between physiological phenomena and differential expression profile."
https://openalex.org/W2887364960,"Feral horses in Theodore Roosevelt National Park (TRNP) represent an iconic era of the North Dakota Badlands. Their uncertain history raises management questions regarding origins, genetic diversity, and long-term genetic viability. Hair samples with follicles were collected from 196 horses in the Park and used to sequence the control region of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and to profile 12 autosomal short tandem repeat (STR) markers. Three mtDNA haplotypes found in the TRNP horses belonged to haplogroups L and B. The control region variation was low with haplotype diversity of 0.5271, nucleotide diversity of 0.0077 and mean pairwise difference of 2.93. We sequenced one mitochondrial genome from each haplotype determined by the control region. Two complete mtDNA sequences of haplogroup L were closely related to the mtDNA of American Paint horse. The TRNP haplotype B did not have close matches in GenBank. The phylogenetic test placed this sequence in a group consisting of two horses from China, one from Yakutia, and one from Italy raising a possibility of historical transportation of horses from Siberia and East Asia to North America. Autosomal STR loci were polymorphic and indicated that the TRNP horses were distinctly different from 48 major horse breeds. Heterozygosity, mean number of alleles, and other measures of diversity indicated that TRNP herd diversity was below that observed for most other feral herds and domestic breeds. Both mtDNA and STRs demonstrated that the existing genetic data sets of horses are insufficient to determine the exact origins of the TRNP horses. However, measures of nuclear and mitochondrial diversity have elucidated management needs. It is recommended that new genetic stock be introduced and that adaptive management principles are employed to ensure that unique mitochondrial lineages are preserved and genetic diversity is increased and maintained over time."
https://openalex.org/W2887977529,"Introduction Gonorrhea is a major sexually transmitted infection (STI) globally with increasing trends. Despite limited data, gonorrhea remains an important public health problem in Bhutan. Methods A descriptive study was carried out in two Bhutanese hospitals; Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital and Phuentsholing General Hospital in 2015. Patients suspected of gonococcal urethritis were sampled, treated and followed up at two weeks. Gonococcal isolates were identified and tested for antibiotic susceptibility by the Calibrated Dichotomous Sensitivity Test (CDS) method. Results Of the 524 patients, 2.3% (12) were females. Most (46.6%) patients belonged to the 26–35 years age group. About 58% were lost to follow up; 62% (277) of males and all (12) females. N. gonorrhoea was positive in 76% (398) of microscopy and 73.1% (383) by culture. Resistance against ciprofloxacin, penicillin, tetracycline and nalidixic acid were 85.1%, 99.2%, 84.8% and 99.7% respectively. Nearly all the isolates were sensitive to cefpodoxime, ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Sixty-seven percent (350) were treated with injection ceftriaxone alone, 32% (169) with ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline and 1% (5) with ceftriaxone, doxycycline and metronidazole. Probable treatment failure was seen only in one patient (0.5%). Conclusions Gonococcal resistance to currently used antibiotics was low and there was a high clinical cure rate. Compliance to treatment guidelines need reinforcement addressing antibiotic regimen, tracing sexual partners and addressing the social stigma. National STI programs should be more women-friendly for effective management, prevention and control of STIs. Laboratories must adopt more reliable susceptibility testing methods, the Minimum Inhibition Concentration method."
https://openalex.org/W2886514450,"Lysine methylation is a reversible post-translational modification that affects protein function. Lysine methylation is involved in regulating the function of both histone and non-histone proteins, thereby influencing both cellular transcription and the activation of signaling pathways. To date, only a few lysine methyltransferases have been studied in depth. Here, we study the Drosophila homolog of the human lysine methyltransferase SETD3, CG32732/dSETD3. Since mammalian SETD3 is involved in cell proliferation, we tested the effect of dSETD3 on proliferation and growth of Drosophila S2 cells and whole flies. Knockdown of dSETD3 did not alter mTORC1 activity nor proliferation rate of S2 cells. Complete knock-out of dSETD3 in Drosophila flies did not affect their weight, growth rate or fertility. dSETD3 KO flies showed normal responses to starvation and hypoxia. In sum, we could not identify any clear phenotypes for SETD3 knockout animals, indicating that additional work will be required to elucidate the molecular and physiological function of this highly conserved enzyme."

The hyper saline deposition, extremely arid climate and high UV radiation make Dalangtan a Mars analogue both for geomorphology and life preservation. To better understand microbial life at Dalangtan, both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods were examined and simultaneously, environment conditions and the evaporitic mineral assemblages were investigated. Ten and thirteen subsurface samples were collected along a 595-cm deep profile (P1) and a 685-cm deep profile (P2) respectively, and seven samples were gathered from surface sediments. These samples are composed of salt minerals, minor silicate mineral fragments and clays. The total bacterial cell numbers are (1.54±0.49) ×105 g−1 for P1 and (3.22±0.95) ×105 g−1 for P2 as indicated by the CAtalyzed Reporter Deposition- Fluorescent in situ Hybridization (CARD-FISH). 76.6% and 75.7% of the bacteria belong to Firmicutes phylum respectively from P1 and P2. In total, 47 bacteria and 6 fungi were isolated from 22 subsurface samples. In contrast, only 3 bacteria and 1 fungus were isolated from 3 surface samples. The isolated bacteria show high homology (≥97%) with members of the Firmicutes phylum (47 strains, 8 genera) and the Actinobacteria phylum (3 strains, 2 genera), which agrees with the result of CARD-FISH. Isolated fungi showed ≥98% ITS1 homology with members of the phylum Ascomycota. Moisture content and TOC values may control the sediments colonization. Given the deliquescence of salts, evaporites may provide refuge for microbial life, which merits further investigation. Halotolerant and spore-forming microorganisms are the dominant microbial groups capable of surviving under extreme conditions. Our results offer brand-new information on microbial biomass in Dalangtan Playa and shed light on understanding the potential microbial life in the dried playa or paleo-lakes on Mars."
https://openalex.org/W2886094495,"Among α-transglucosylases from Glycoside-Hydrolase family 70, the ΔN123-GB-CD2 enzyme derived from the bifunctional DSR-E from L. citreum NRRL B-1299 is particularly interesting as it was the first described engineered Branching Sucrase, not able to elongate glucan polymers from sucrose substrate. The previously reported overall structural organization of this multi-domain enzyme is an intricate U-shape fold conserved among GH70 enzymes which showed a certain conformational variability of the so-called domain V, assumed to play a role in the control of product structures, in available X-ray structures. Understanding the role of functional dynamics on enzyme reaction and substrate recognition is of utmost interest although it remains a challenge for biophysical methods. By combining long molecular dynamics simulation (1μs) and multiple analyses (NMA, PCA, Morelet Continuous Wavelet Transform and Cross Correlations Dynamics), we investigated here the dynamics of ΔN123-GB-CD2 alone and in interaction with sucrose substrate. Overall, our results provide the detailed picture at atomic level of the hierarchy of motions occurring along different timescales and how they are correlated, in agreement with experimental structural data. In particular, detailed analysis of the different structural domains revealed cooperative dynamic behaviors such as twisting, bending and wobbling through anti- and correlated motions, and also two structural hinge regions, of which one was unreported. Several highly flexible loops surrounding the catalytic pocket were also highlighted, suggesting a potential role in the acceptor promiscuity of ΔN123-GBD-CD2. Normal modes and essential dynamics underlined an interesting two-fold dynamic of the catalytic domain A, pivoting about an axis splitting the catalytic gorge in two parts. The comparison of the conformational free energy landscapes using principal component analysis of the enzyme in absence or in presence of sucrose, also revealed a more harmonic basin when sucrose is bound with a shift population of the bending mode, consistent with the substrate binding event."
https://openalex.org/W2887711278,"Seed shipments, silos and storage houses often contain weed seeds or seeds of restricted crops such as undeclared genetically modified (GM) varieties. Random sub-sampling is the favoured approach to detect unwanted biological materials in seed lots but is prohibitively expensive or else ineffective for the huge volumes of seeds moved in commercial operations. This study uses maize and cowpea seed admixtures as an exemplar to evaluate the feasibility of using aerosol sampling of “seed dust” as an alternative to seed sub-sampling. In an initial calibration phase, qPCR of the rbcL barcode followed by high-resolution melting (HRM) of a DNA titration series revealed a strong linear relationship between mix composition and HRM profiles. However, the relationship became skewed when flour mixes were used to build the titration, implying a DNA extraction bias favouring cowpea. Aerosol samples of seed dust above a titration of mixed seed samples were then collected along vertical and lateral axes. Aerosols were characterised by light microscopy, qPCR-HRM and next-generation DNA sequencing (Illumina MiSeq). Both molecular approaches again showed bias but this time in a reverse direction to flour samples. Microscopic examination of the aerosol sample suggested this divergence could be attributed to differences in abundance of airborne starch particles. Despite the bias, it was nevertheless possible to estimate relative abundance of each species using the abundance of minibarcodes. In light of these results we explore the feasibility of aerosol sampling for commercial seed lot characterisation."
https://openalex.org/W2885808711,"Pseudozyma flocculosa is a fungus very useful and highly efficient as a biocontrol agent against powdery mildew. The reproduction of this fungus occurs exclusively by asexual production of conidia or sporidia that are the most suitable form for agricultural use and seems to be the most resistant to storage conditions. Despite the advantages offered by P. flocculosa in biological control, the use of this fungus use remains largely limited compared to that of chemical fungicides, at least partly due to the difficulty to obtain sporidia resistant to adverse environmental stresses in submerged culture conditions. Under solid-state and submerged-state cultivation, P. flocculosa strain CBS 16788 produced different types of sporidia. The submerged sporidia (SS) appeared relatively uniform in size, which was 15,4 ± 1,6 μm μm long, and 2,8 ± 0.8 μm wide. The aerial sporidia (AS) varied in shape and size, with a mean length of 8,2 ± 3 μm and width of 2,3 ± 0.6 μm. Under scanning and transmission electron microscopy, the cell wall of submerged sporidia was thinner than that of aerial spores, and the surface was smooth in contrast to the aerial sporidia that had a tendency to have verrucous, brittle surface characteristics. The thickness of the aerial sporidia wall is due to the presence of an outer layer rich in melanin. The sporidia germination was compared on YMPD (yeast extract, malt extract, soy peptone, dextrose and agar) coated coverslips. The aerial sporidia did not show germ tubes until 5 h of incubation, while the submerged sporidia showed many germ tubes after the same time. The resistance against the adverse environmental conditions in relation to the type of sporidia of P. flocculosa is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2887139569,"To investigate the surgical outcome of patients with osteophyte-associated dysphagia (OAD) using the functional outcome swallowing scale (FOSS).A retrospective chart review of 10 surgical cases of OAD (9 male and 1 female patient; mean age of 65 years) from 1982 to 2017 was performed, and radiographic evaluations were conducted by video fluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) and conventional radiography. All OAD cases were treated at a single institution, and osteophytes were surgically resected by the anterior approach under gentle retraction of the affected esophagus. FOSS (0 for normal, 5 for worst) was used for clinical evaluations, and surgical complications were recorded.VFSS evaluation of OAD showed that the affected osteophyte was located at C4/5 in four patients, followed by C3/4 in three patients. The mean FOSS showed significant improvement from 2.5 preoperatively to 0.3 postoperatively, and no major surgical complications were recorded. Comorbidities were diabetes mellitus in four patients, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament in three patients, and lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) in three patients.Surgical treatment of OAD was promising, and all patients showed clinical recovery. Evaluation of dysphagia using FOSS was easy and reliable for OAD management, and FOSS 2 might be a good indication for surgical intervention."

The objectives of this study were to quantify the morphological abnormalities in the tracheas of ​​patients with scleroderma and to correlate these findings with data on clinical and pulmonary function.This was a cross-sectional study in which 28 adults with scleroderma and 27 controls matched by age, gender and body mass index underwent chest CT with posterior segmentation and skeletonization of the images. In addition, all participants underwent pulmonary function tests and clinical evaluation, including the modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS).Most patients (71.4%) had interstitial lung disease on CT. Compared to controls, patients with scleroderma showed higher values ​​in the parameters measured by CT trachea volumetry, including area, eccentricity, major diameter, minor diameter, and tortuosity. The tracheal area and equivalent diameter were negatively correlated with the ratio between forced expiratory flow and forced inspiratory flow at 50% of forced vital capacity (FEF50%/FIF50%) (r = -0.44, p = 0.03 and r = -0.46, p = 0.02, respectively). The tracheal tortuosity was negatively correlated with peak expiratory flow (r = -0.51, p = 0.008). The mRSS showed a positive correlation with eccentricity (r = 0.62, p < 0.001) and tracheal tortuosity (r = 0.51, p = 0.007), while the presence of anti-topoisomerase I antibody (ATA) showed a positive correlation with tracheal tortuosity (r = 0.45, p = 0.03).In a sample composed predominantly of scleroderma patients with associated interstitial lung disease, there were abnormalities in tracheal geometry, including greater eccentricity, diameter and tortuosity. In these patients, abnormalities in the geometry of the trachea were associated with functional markers of obstruction. In addition, tracheal tortuosity was correlated with cutaneous involvement and the presence of ATA."
https://openalex.org/W2887948140,"Influenza viruses are by nature unstable with high levels of mutations. The sequential accumulation of mutations in the surface glycoproteins allows the virus to evade the neutralizing antibodies. The consideration of the tropics as the influenza reservoir where viral genetic and antigenic diversity are continually generated and reintroduced into temperate countries makes the study of influenza virus evolution in Indonesia essential. A total of 100 complete coding sequences (CDS) of Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) genes of H3N2 virus were obtained from archived samples of Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) surveillance collected from 2008 to 2010. Our evolutionary and phylogenetic analyses provide insight into the dynamic changes of Indonesian H3N2 virus from 2008 to 2010. Obvious antigenic drift with typical ‘ladder-like’ phylogeny was observed with multiple lineages found in each year, suggesting co-circulation of H3N2 strains at different time periods. The mutational pattern of the Indonesian H3N2 virus was not geographically related as relatively low levels of mutations with similar pattern of relative genetic diversity were observed in various geographical origins. This study reaffirms that the existence of a particular lineage is most likely the result of adaptation or competitive exclusion among different host populations and combination of stochastic ecological factors, rather than its geographical origin alone."

Team capacity evaluation and a task-team scheduling model are presented. A collaborative team capacity model is constructed, and a 2-tuple linguistic method is used to evaluate the capacity of collaborative teams. Next, the matching degree between design task and collaborative team is defined. A collaborative product design scheduling model considering task-team matching is developed. Combined with the simulated annealing operator, based on the single-coding strategy, self-adaptive multi-point cross and mutation, an improved genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the model. Finally, a case study is presented to validate the method."
https://openalex.org/W2887266628,"As statisticians develop new methodological approaches, there are many factors that influence whether others will utilize their work. This paper is a bibliometric study that identifies and quantifies associations between characteristics of new biostatistics methods and their citation counts. Of primary interest was the association between numbers of citations and whether software code was available to the reader.Statistics journal articles published in 2010 from 35 statistical journals were reviewed by two biostatisticians. Generalized linear mixed models were used to determine which characteristics (author, article, and journal) were independently associated with citation counts (as of April 1, 2017) in other peer-reviewed articles.Of 722 articles reviewed, 428 were classified as new biostatistics methods. In a multivariable model, for articles that were not freely accessible on the journal's website, having code available appeared to offer no boost to the number of citations (adjusted rate ratio = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.74 to 1.24, p = 0.74); however, for articles that were freely accessible on the journal's website, having code available was associated with a 2-fold increase in the number of citations (adjusted rate ratio = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.30 to 3.10, p = 0.002). Higher citation rates were also associated with higher numbers of references, longer articles, SCImago Journal Rank indicator (SJR), and total numbers of publications among authors, with the strongest impact on citation rates coming from SJR (rate ratio = 1.21 for a 1-unit increase in SJR; 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.32).These analyses shed new insight into factors associated with citation rates of articles on new biostatistical methods. Making computer code available to readers is a goal worth striving for that may enhance biostatistics knowledge translation."
