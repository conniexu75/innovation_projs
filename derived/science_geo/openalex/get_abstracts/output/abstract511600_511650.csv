https://openalex.org/W2148525238,"The regulation of AMPK in the ischemic heart remains incompletely understood. Recent evidence implicates the role of Sestrin2 in the AMPK signaling pathway, and it is hypothesized that Sestrin2 plays an influential role during myocardial ischemia to promote AMPK activation. Sestrin2 protein was found to be expressed in adult cardiomyocytes and accumulated in the heart during ischemic conditions. Sestrin2 knockout (KO) mice were used to determine the importance of Sestrin2 during ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury. When wild-type (WT) and Sestrin2 KO mice were subjected to in vivo I/R, myocardial infarct size was significantly greater in Sestrin2 KO compared with WT hearts. Similarly, Langendorff perfused hearts indicated exacerbated postischemic contractile function in Sestrin2 KO hearts compared with WT. Ischemic AMPK activation was found to be impaired in the Sestrin2 KO hearts. Immunoprecipitation of Sestrin2 demonstrated an association with AMPK. Moreover, liver kinase B1 (LKB1), a major AMPK upstream kinase, was associated with the Sestrin2-AMPK complex in a time-dependent manner during ischemia, whereas this interaction was nearly abolished in Sestrin2 KO hearts. Thus, Sestrin2 plays an important role in cardioprotection against I/R injury, serving as an LKB1-AMPK scaffold to initiate AMPK activation during ischemic insults.—Morrison, A., Chen, L.

https://openalex.org/W2075758366,"Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is associated with diverse genetic alterations including mutation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Isoliquiritigenin (ILQ), a chalcone derivative, possesses anticancer activities. In the present study, we investigated the effects of ILQ on the growth of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cells and elucidated its underlying mechanisms. Treatment with ILQ inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in both TKI-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cells. ILQ-induced apoptosis was associated with the cleavage of caspase-3 and poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase, increased expression of Bim, and reduced expression of Bcl-2. In vitro kinase assay results revealed that ILQ inhibited the catalytic activity of both wild type and double mutant (L858R/T790M) EGFR. Treatment with ILQ inhibited the anchorage-independent growth of NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with either wild type or double-mutant EGFR with or without EGF stimulation. ILQ also reduced the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 in both TKI-sensitive and -resistant NSCLC cells, and attenuated the kinase activity of Akt1 and ERK2 in vitro. ILQ directly interacted with both wild type and double-mutant EGFR in an ATP-competitive manner. A docking model study showed that ILQ formed two hydrogen bonds (Glu-762 and Met-793) with wild type EGFR and three hydrogen bonds (Lys-745, Met-793, and Asp-855) with mutant EGFR. ILQ attenuated the xenograft tumor growth of H1975 cells, which was associated with decreased expression of Ki-67 and diminished phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2. Taken together, ILQ suppresses NSCLC cell growth by directly targeting wild type or mutant EGFR."

Although genetic tools are available for interrogating the effects of decreased or abolished sialoside expression in mice, pharmacological inhibition of the sialyltransferase family has, to date, not been possible. We have recently shown that a sialic acid analog, 2,4,7,8,9-pentaacetyl-3Fax-Neu5Ac-CO2Me (3F-NeuAc), added to the media of cultured cells shuts down sialylation by a mechanism involving its intracellular conversion to CMP-3F-NeuAc, a competitive inhibitor of all sialyltransferases. Here we show that administering 3F-NeuAc to mice dramatically decreases sialylated glycans in cells of all tissues tested, including blood, spleen, liver, brain, lung, heart, kidney, and testes. A single dose results in greatly decreased sialoside expression for over 7 weeks in some tissues. Although blockade of sialylation with 3F-NeuAc does not affect viability of cultured cells, its use in vivo has a deleterious “on target” effect on liver and kidney function. After administration of 3F-NeuAc, liver enzymes in the blood are dramatically altered, and mice develop proteinuria concomitant with dramatic loss of sialic acid in the glomeruli within 4 days, leading to irreversible kidney dysfunction and failure to thrive. These results confirm a critical role for sialosides in liver and kidney function and document the feasibility of pharmacological inhibition of sialyltransferases for in vivo modulation of sialoside expression.

Cell surface sialosides on higher eukaryotic cells have been implicated in highly diverse physiological processes (2.Varki A. Glycan-based interactions involving vertebrate sialic-acid-recognizing proteins.Nature. 2007; 446: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). For example, as ligands for sialic acid binding proteins, sialosides mediate cellular homing and adhesion of leukocytes (3.Rosen S.D. Ligands for l-selectin: homing, inflammation, and beyond.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 129-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), modulation of immune responses (4.Crocker P.R. Paulson J.C. Varki A. Siglecs and their roles in the immune system.Nat.

Viruses and sialic acids: rules of engagement.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2011; 21: 610-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Sialosides also play key roles in fertilization (6.Pang P.C.

Sizing up sialic acid in glomerular disease.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 1480-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Genetic deficiency in the cellular biosynthesis of sialic acid results in lethality during embryonic development in mice (10.Schwarzkopf M. Knobeloch K.-P. Rohde E. Hinderlich S. Wiechens N. Lucka L.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5267-5270Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), highlighting the importance of sialic acid at the organismal level. Conversely, hypersialylation is a hallmark of many cancer cell types, and up-regulation of cell surface sialic acid is proposed to play a role in cancer progression through a variety of mechanisms (11.Fuster M.M. Esko J.D. The sweet and sour of cancer: glycans as novel therapeutic targets.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 526-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). 5-acetyl-neuraminic acid 2,4,7,8,9-pentaacetyl-3Fax-Neu5Ac-CO2Me 5-glycolyl-neuraminic acid galactose(1,4)α-N-acetylglucosamine N-acetylmannosamine Fucose S. nigra agglutinin peanut agglutinin M. amurensis agglutinin. In higher eukaryotes, sialic acid is linked to the underlying glycan via an α-glycosidic linkage to the 3′ or 6′ position of a galactose residue, the 6′ position of an N-acetylgalactosamine residue, or the 8′ position of another sialic acid residue. These protein- or lipid-linked α2,3-, α2,6-, and α2,8-sialosides are generated enzymatically by the cumulative actions of 20 different sialyltransferases, which all use CMP-NeuAc as their common donor substrate (12.Paulson J.C. Rademacher C. Glycan terminator.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 1121-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Importantly, because of differences in acceptor substrate specificity and gene expression patterns of these related enzymes, cells and tissues display unique sialoside structures, which can have important functional consequences (13.Paulson J.C.

In principle, use of small molecule inhibitors of sialyltransferases offers a complementary approach to genetic methods for studying the in vivo role(s) of sialosides. In particular, they address the concern about genetic deficiencies on development and can assess the kinetics for the onset and reversibility of an observed phenotype with control of administration and withdrawal of inhibitor. The majority of sialyltransferase inhibitors developed to date are not cell-permeable, and hence, no sialyltransferase inhibitor has been used to alter sialoside expression levels in vivo. Recently, we developed a global inhibitor of the sialyltransferase family that is highly effective at inhibiting sialoside expression in cultured cells (29.Rillahan C.D. Antonopoulos A. Lefort C.T. Sonon R. Azadi P. Ley K. Dell A. Haslam S.M. Paulson J.C. Global metabolic inhibitors of sialyl- and fucosyltransferases remodel the glycome.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Using a pro-drug approach, peracetylated 3Fax-NeuAc (3F-NeuAc) is efficiently taken up by cells, deacetylated, and transformed into CMP-3F-NeuAc. CMP-3F-NeuAc is a very poor substrate for sialyltransferases because of the electron-withdrawing effect of the fluorine atom that destabilizes the proposed oxocarbenium ion-like transition state, effectively acting as a competitive inhibitor (30.Burkart M.D. Vincent S.P. Düffels A. Murray B.W. Ley S.V. Wong C.H. Chemo-enzymatic synthesis of fluorinated sugar nucleotide: useful mechanistic probes for glycosyltransferases.Bioorg. Med.

Biochem. 2008; 77: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CMP-3F-NeuAc accumulates to high levels in the cell and, because of the metabolic feedback loops, leads to the depletion of endogenous CMP-NeuAc (29.Rillahan C.D. Antonopoulos A. Lefort C.T. Sonon R. Azadi P. Ley K. Dell A. Haslam S.M. Paulson J.C. Global metabolic inhibitors of sialyl- and fucosyltransferases remodel the glycome.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that although blockade of sialylation with 3F-NeuAc did not alter the viability of cultured cells (29.Rillahan C.D. Antonopoulos A. Lefort C.T. Sonon R. Azadi P. Ley K. Dell A.

Here, we show that 3F-NeuAc dramatically alters sialoside expression in mice. A single dose of 3F-NeuAc produces long lasting decreases in sialoside expression in all tissues analyzed. Decreasing sialoside expression with 3F-NeuAc results in kidney and liver dysfunction, the former of which is irreversible. These results demonstrate that global sialoside expression levels can be modulated in mice by pharmacological means and reveal that kidney and liver function are extremely sensitive to decreases in sialoside expression.

The reaction was quenched with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (250 ml), diluted with H2O (150 ml), and extracted three times with EtOAc (500 ml). The extracts were then further extracted with NaHCO3 (300 ml), brine (300 ml), and dried over Na2SO4. The crude material was dissolved in EtOAc and loaded onto a silica gel column eluting with 3:7 EtOAc:Hex → 1:9 EtOAc:Hex to afford 5.12 g of 4,7,8,9-tetraacetyl-3Feq-Neu5Ac-CO2Me (compound 3), 4.74 g of a mixture of equatorial and axial diastereomers (compound 2 and 3), and 8.4 g of the desired product 4,7,8,9-tetraacetyl-3Fax-Neu5Ac-CO2Me (compound 2, 16.5 mmol, 33% yield). To synthesize 2,4,7,8,9-pentaacetyl-3Fax-Neu5Ac-CO2Me (compound 4), compound 2 (7.17 g, 14.1 mmol, 1 eq) was dissolved in pyridine (250 ml), to which acetic anhydride (3.3 ml, 35.2 mmol, 2.5 eq) was added, and the reaction was left to stir overnight. After evaporation to dryness, the residue was diluted with EtOAc (1 liter) and extracted with 5% citric acid (3 × 300 ml), saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (300 ml), brine (300 ml), and dried over Na2SO4. The extracted material was then recrystallized from EtOAc/hexanes to afford the final product (5.7 g, 10.33 mmol, 73% yield). Characterization of all compounds was consistent with the previously reported data (29.Rillahan C.D. Antonopoulos A. Lefort C.T. Sonon R. Azadi P. Ley K. Dell A. Haslam S.M. Paulson J.C.

Male C57BL/6J mice, 6 weeks old, received 10, 30, 100, or 300 mg·kg−1 body weight doses of peracetylated 3Fax-NeuAc (3F-NeuAc) in 100-μl volumes delivered intravenously or intraperitoneally once daily for 1 or 7 day(s). For intravenous delivery via tail vein injection, 3F-NeuAc was dissolved in DMSO, diluted 5-fold in saline warmed to 50 °C, and vortexed immediately. For intraperitoneal delivery, 3F-NeuAc was dissolved in DMSO and diluted 2-fold in PEG300. For all studies, untreated mice received the vehicle as a control. Mice were monitored daily for signs of discomfort. N-Acetyl-d-mannosamine (ManNAc; Carbosynth) was added to the drinking water to achieve a dose of 2 g·kg−1·day−1. ManNAc treatment started 1 day prior to dosing with 3F-NeuAc and was not withdrawn. Blood (50 μl) was obtained via retro-orbital bleed. After red blood cell lysis, washed cells were stained with B220, Thy1.2, Gr1, F4/80, and lectins in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.1% BSA and 2mm CaCl2 for 1 h on ice. Washed cells were resuspended in the same buffer with propidium iodide prior to analysis by flow cytometry.

The aim of our study was to identify the relationship between dietary patterns and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Using a validated food frequency questionnaire, we employed a cross-sectional design to assess the dietary intake of 1257 Korean adults aged 31 to 70 years. To determine the participants’ dietary patterns, we considered 37 predefined food groups in principal components analysis. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III. The abdominal obesity criterion was modified using Asian guidelines. Prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the metabolic syndrome were calculated across the quartiles of dietary pattern scores using log binomial regression models. The covariates used in the model were age, sex, total energy intake, tobacco intake, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 19.8% in men and 14.1% in women. The PCA identified three distinct dietary patterns: the ‘traditional’ pattern, the ‘meat’ pattern, and the ‘snack’ pattern. There was an association of increasing waist circumference and body mass index with increasing score in the meat dietary pattern. The multivariate-adjusted prevalence ratio of metabolic syndrome for the highest quartile of the meat pattern in comparison with the lowest quartile was 1.47 (95% CI: 1.00–2.15, p for trend = 0.016). A positive association between the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and the dietary pattern score was found only for men with the meat dietary pattern (2.15, 95% CI: 1.10–4.21, p for trend = 0.005). The traditional pattern and the snack pattern were not associated with an increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome. The meat dietary pattern was associated with a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome in Korean male adults."
https://openalex.org/W1974242799,"Musashi (MSI) family proteins control cell proliferation and differentiation in many biological systems. They are overexpressed in tumors of several origins, and their expression level correlates with poor prognosis. MSI proteins control gene expression by binding RNA and regulating its translation. They contain two RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains, which recognize a defined sequence element. The relative contribution of each nucleotide to the binding affinity and specificity is unknown. We analyzed the binding specificity of three MSI family RRM domains using a quantitative fluorescence anisotropy assay. We found that the core element driving recognition is the sequence UAG. Nucleotides outside of this motif have a limited contribution to binding free energy. For mouse MSI1, recognition is determined by the first of the two RRM domains. The second RRM adds affinity but does not contribute to binding specificity. In contrast, the recognition element for Drosophila MSI is more extensive than the mouse homolog, suggesting functional divergence. The short nature of the binding determinant suggests that protein-RNA affinity alone is insufficient to drive target selection by MSI family proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2171461504,"The present study is to investigate the role of microRNA-21 (miR-21) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and the mechanisms of regulation of PTEN by miR-21. Fifty-four tissue samples were collected from 42 patients with NPC and 12 healthy controls. Human NPC cell lines CNE-1, CNE-2, TWO3 and C666-1 were used for cell assays. To investigate the expression of miR-21, RT-PCR was employed. RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were used to measure the expression of STAT3 mRNA and STAT3 protein. To test the effect of miR-21 on the cell growth and apoptosis of NPC cells in vitro, transfection of CNE1 and CNE2 cell lines and flow cytometry were performed. TUNEL assay was used to detect DNA fragmentation. To validate whether miR-21 directly recognizes the 3′-UTRs of PTEN mRNA, luciferase reporter assay was employed. miR-21 expression was increased in NPC tissues compared with control and the same result was found in NPC cell lines. Notably, increased expression of miR-21 was directly related to advanced clinical stage and lymph node metastasis. STAT3, a transcription factor activated by IL-6, directly activated miR-21 in transformed NPC cell lines. Furthermore, miR-21 markedly inhibited PTEN tumor suppressor, leading to increased AKT activity. Both in vitro and in vivo assays revealed that miR-21 enhanced NPC cell proliferation and suppressed apoptosis. miR-21, activated by STAT3, induced proliferation and suppressed apoptosis in NPC by targeting PTEN-AKT pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2025130109,"The ruminal microbiome in herbivores plays a dominant role in the digestion of lignocellulose and has potential to improve animal productivity. Kankrej cattle, a popular native breed of the Indian subcontinent, were used to investigate the effect of different dietary treatments on the bacterial diversity in ruminal fractions using different primer pairs. Two groups of four cows were assigned to two primary diets of either dry or green forages. Each group was fed one of three dietary treatments for six weeks each. Dietary treatments were; K1 (50% dry/green roughage: 50% concentrate), K2 (75% dry/green roughage: 25% concentrate) and K3 (100% dry/green roughage). Rumen samples were collected using stomach tube at the end of each dietary period and separated into solid and liquid fractions. The DNA was extracted and amplified for V1–V3, V4–V5 and V6–V8 hypervariable regions using P1, P2 and P3 primer pairs, sequenced on a 454 Roche platform and analyzed using QIIME. Community compositions and the abundance of most bacterial lineages were driven by interactions between primer pair, dietary treatment and fraction. The most abundant bacterial phyla identified were Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes however, the abundance of these phyla varied between different primer pairs; in each primer pair the abundance was dependent on the dietary treatment and fraction. The abundance of Bacteroidetes in cattle receiving K1 treatment indicate their diverse functional capabilities in the digestion of both carbohydrate and protein while the predominance of Firmicutes in the K2 and K3 treatments signifies their metabolic role in fibre digestion. It is apparent that both liquid and solid fractions had distinct bacterial community patterns (P<0.001) congruent to changes in the dietary treatments. It can be concluded that the P1 primer pair flanking the V1–V3 hyper-variable region provided greater species richness and diversity of bacterial populations in the rumen of Kankrej cattle."

Native hearts decellularized with preserved architecture and vasculature may provide an acellular tissue platform for organ regeneration. We sought to develop a tissue-engineered whole-heart neoscaffold in human-sized porcine hearts. Methods We decellularized porcine hearts (n = 10) by coronary perfusion with ionic detergents in a modified Langendorff circuit. We confirmed decellularization by histology, transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy, quantified residual DNA by spectrophotometry, and evaluated biomechanical stability with ex-vivo left-ventricular pressure/volume studies, all compared to controls. We then mounted the decellularized porcine hearts in a bioreactor and reseeded them with murine neonatal cardiac cells and human umbilical cord derived endothelial cells (HUVEC) under simulated physiological conditions. Results Decellularized hearts lacked intracellular components but retained specific collagen fibers, proteoglycan, elastin and mechanical integrity; quantitative DNA analysis demonstrated a significant reduction of DNA compared to controls (82.6±3.2 ng DNA/mg tissue vs. 473.2±13.4 ng DNA/mg tissue, p<0.05). Recellularized porcine whole-heart neoscaffolds demonstrated re-endothelialization of coronary vasculature and measurable intrinsic myocardial electrical activity at 10 days, with perfused organ culture maintained for up to 3 weeks. Conclusions Human-sized decellularized porcine hearts provide a promising tissue-engineering platform that may lead to future clinical strategies in the treatment of heart failure."

Its chloroplast (cp) genome is 155,871 bp in length with a typical quadripartite structure of the large (LSC, 86,302 bp) and small (SSC, 18,367 bp) single-copy regions, separated by a pair of inverted repeats (IRs, 25,601 bp). The genome contains 113 unique genes, including 80 protein-coding genes, 29 tRNAs and four rRNAs. A total of 11 forward, 9 palindromic and 13 tandem repeats were detected in the D. stramonium cp genome. Most simple sequence repeats (SSR) are AT-rich and are less abundant in coding regions than in non-coding regions. Both SSRs and GC content were unevenly distributed in the entire cp genome. All preferred synonymous codons were found to use A/T ending codons. The difference in GC contents of entire genomes and of the three-codon positions suggests that the D. stramonium cp genome might possess different genomic organization, in part due to different mutational pressures. The five most divergent coding regions and four non-coding regions (trnH-psbA, rps4-trnS, ndhD-ccsA, and ndhI-ndhG) were identified using whole plastome alignment, which can be used to develop molecular markers for phylogenetics and barcoding studies within the Solanaceae. Phylogenetic analysis based on 68 protein-coding genes supported Datura as a sister to Solanum.

GDF8 is a potent negative regulator of myogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. We found that GDF8 signaling was inhibited by the small molecule ATP competitive inhibitors dorsomorphin and LDN-193189. These compounds were previously shown to be potent inhibitors of BMP signaling by binding to the BMP type I receptors ALK1/2/3/6. We present the crystal structure of the type II receptor ActRIIA with dorsomorphin and demonstrate that dorsomorphin or LDN-193189 target GDF8 induced Smad2/3 signaling and repression of myogenic transcription factors. As a result, both inhibitors rescued myogenesis in myoblasts treated with GDF8. As revealed by quantitative live cell microscopy, treatment with dorsomorphin or LDN-193189 promoted the contractile activity of myotubular networks in vitro. We therefore suggest these inhibitors as suitable tools to promote functional myogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2149761309,"During epididymal sperm maturation, the lipid content of the sperm membrane is modified, which facilitates sperm motility and fertility. However, little is known about the mechanisms regulating the maturation process. By generating a conditional knockout (cKO) of Dicer1 in the proximal part of the mouse epididymis, we studied the role of RNA interference in epididymal functions. The Dicer1 cKO epididymis displayed an altered lipid homeostasis associated with a 0.6-fold reduction in the expression of the gene elongation of very long chain fatty acids-like 2, an enzyme needed for production of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Furthermore, the expression of several factors involved in cholesterol synthesis was up-regulated. Accordingly, the Dicer1 cKO sperm membrane showed a 0.7-fold decrease in long-chain PUFAs, whereas the amount of cholesterol in acrosome-reacted sperm displayed a 1.7-fold increase. The increased cholesterol:PUFA ratio of the sperm membrane caused breakage of the neck and acrosome region and immotility of sperm. Dicer1 cKO mice sperm also displayed reduced ability to bind to and fertilize the oocyte in vitro. This study thus shows that Dicer1 is critical for lipid synthesis in the epididymis, which directly affects sperm membrane integrity and male fertility.—Björkgren, I., Gylling, H., Turunen, H., Huhtaniemi, I., Strauss, L., Poutanen, M., Sipilä, P.

Patients were identified from the electronic health record system at Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge containing pre-, peri- and postnatal information. Information was collected on maternal and infant health, social factors and pregnancy. NAS sheets were scrutinized.220 women with reported 3rd trimester exposure to SSRIs or SNRIs and who gave birth between January 2007 and June 2009 were included. Seventy seven women (35%) used citalopram, 76 used (35%) sertraline, 34 (15%) fluoxetine and 33 (15%) other SSRI/SNRI. Twenty-nine infants (13%) were admitted to the neonatal ward, 19 were born prematurely. NAS was analyzed in 205 patients. Severe abstinence was defined as eight points or higher on at least two occasions (on a scale with maximum 40 points), mild abstinence as 4 points or higher on at least two occasions. Seven infants expressed signs of severe abstinence and 46 (22%) had mild abstinence symptoms. Hypoglycemia (plasma glucose <2.6 mmol/L) was found in 42 infants (19%).Severe abstinence in infants prenatally exposed to antidepressants was found to be rare (3%) in this study population, a slightly lower prevalence than reported in previous studies. Neonatal hypoglycemia in infants prenatally exposed to antidepressant may however be more common than previously described."
https://openalex.org/W1997078049,"Gliomas are mostly incurable secondary to their diffuse infiltrative nature. Thus, specific therapeutic targeting of invasive glioma cells is an attractive concept. As cells exit the tumor mass and infiltrate brain parenchyma, they closely interact with a changing micro-environmental landscape that sustains tumor cell invasion. In this study, we used a unique microarray profiling approach on a human glioma stem cell (GSC) xenograft model to explore gene expression changes in situ in Invading Glioma Cells (IGCs) compared to tumor core, as well as changes in host cells residing within the infiltrated microenvironment relative to the unaffected cortex. IGCs were found to have reduced expression of genes within the extracellular matrix compartment, and genes involved in cell adhesion, cell polarity and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes. The infiltrated microenvironment showed activation of wound repair and tissue remodeling networks. We confirmed by protein analysis the downregulation of EMT and polarity related genes such as CD44 and PARD3 in IGCs, and EFNB3, a tissue-remodeling agent enriched at the infiltrated microenvironment. OLIG2, a proliferation regulator and glioma progenitor cell marker upregulated in IGCs was found to function in enhancing migration and stemness of GSCs. Overall, our results unveiled a more comprehensive picture of the complex and dynamic cell autonomous and tumor-host interactive pathways of glioma invasion than has been previously demonstrated. This suggests targeting of multiple pathways at the junction of invading tumor and microenvironment as a viable option for glioma therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2020606105,"Plk1 is a checkpoint protein whose role spans all of mitosis and includes DNA repair, and is highly conserved in eukaryotes from yeast to man. Consistent with this wide array of functions for Plk1, the cellular consequences of Plk1 disruption are diverse, spanning delays in mitotic entry, mitotic spindle abnormalities, and transient mitotic arrest leading to mitotic slippage and failures in cytokinesis. In this work, we present the in vitro and in vivo consequences of Plk1 inhibition in cancer cells using potent, selective small-molecule Plk1 inhibitors and Plk1 genetic knock-down approaches. We demonstrate for the first time that cellular senescence is the predominant outcome of Plk1 inhibition in some cancer cell lines, whereas in other cancer cell lines the dominant outcome appears to be apoptosis, as has been reported in the literature. We also demonstrate strong induction of DNA double-strand breaks in all six lines examined (as assayed by γH2AX), which occurs either during mitotic arrest or mitotic-exit, and may be linked to the downstream induction of senescence. Taken together, our findings expand the view of Plk1 inhibition, demonstrating the occurrence of a non-apoptotic outcome in some settings. Our findings are also consistent with the possibility that mitotic arrest observed as a result of Plk1 inhibition is at least partially due to the presence of unrepaired double-strand breaks in mitosis. These novel findings may lead to alternative strategies for the development of novel therapeutic agents targeting Plk1, in the selection of biomarkers, patient populations, combination partners and dosing regimens."
https://openalex.org/W2057256555,"Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder in individuals that carry DQ2 or DQ8 MHC class II haplotypes, triggered by the ingestion of gluten. There is no current treatment other than a gluten-free diet (GFD). We have previously shown that the BL-7010 copolymer poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-styrene sulfonate) (P(HEMA-co-SS)) binds with higher efficiency to gliadin than to other proteins present in the small intestine, ameliorating gliadin-induced pathology in the HLA-HCD4/DQ8 model of gluten sensitivity. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency of two batches of BL-7010 to interact with gliadin, essential vitamins and digestive enzymes not previously tested, and to assess the ability of the copolymer to reduce gluten-associated pathology using the NOD-DQ8 mouse model, which exhibits more significant small intestinal damage when challenged with gluten than HCD4/DQ8 mice. In addition, the safety and systemic exposure of BL-7010 was evaluated in vivo (in rats) and in vitro (genetic toxicity studies). In vitro binding data showed that BL-7010 interacted with high affinity with gliadin and that BL-7010 had no interaction with the tested vitamins and digestive enzymes. BL-7010 was effective at preventing gluten-induced decreases in villus-to-crypt ratios, intraepithelial lymphocytosis and alterations in paracellular permeability and putative anion transporter-1 mRNA expression in the small intestine. In rats, BL-7010 was well-tolerated and safe following 14 days of daily repeated administration of 3000 mg/kg. BL-7010 did not exhibit any mutagenic effect in the genetic toxicity studies. Using complementary animal models and chronic gluten exposure the results demonstrate that administration of BL-7010 is effective and safe and that it is able to decrease pathology associated with gliadin sensitization warranting the progression to Phase I trials in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1990660357,"Background The relations between geographical proximity and spatial distance constitute a popular topic of concern. Thus, how geographical proximity affects scientific cooperation, and whether geographically proximate scientific cooperation activities in fact exhibit geographic scale features should be investigated. Methodology Selected statistics from the ISI database on cooperatively authored papers, the authors of which resided in 60 typical cites in China, and which were published in the years 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010, were used to establish matrices of geographic distance and cooperation levels between cities. By constructing a distance-cooperation model, the degree of scientific cooperation based on spatial distance was calculated. The relationship between geographical proximity and scientific cooperation, as well as changes in that relationship, was explored using the fitting function. Result (1) Instead of declining, the role of geographical proximity in inter-city scientific cooperation has increased gradually but significantly with the popularization of telecommunication technologies; (2) the relationship between geographical proximity and scientific cooperation has not followed a perfect declining curve, and at certain spatial scales, the distance-decay regularity does not work; (3) the Chinese scientific cooperation network gathers around different regional center cities, showing a trend towards a regional network; within this cooperation network the amount of inter-city cooperation occurring at close range increased greatly. Conclusion The relationship between inter-city geographical distance and scientific cooperation has been enhanced and strengthened over time."
https://openalex.org/W2115747757,"The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia induced acute pancreatitis (HTAP) continues to rise in China. It has systemic complications and high mortality, making the early assessment of the severity of this disease even more important. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) could be novel, non-invasive biomarkers for disease progression judgment. This study aimed to identify the potential role of serum miRNAs as novel biomarkers of HTAP progression. HTAP patients were divided into two groups: moderately severe (HTMSAP) and severe (HTSAP), healthy people were used as control group. The serum miRNA expression profiles of these three groups were determined by microarray and verified by qRT-PCR. The functions and pathways of the targeted genes of deregulated miRNAs were predicted, using bioinformatics analysis; miRNA-mRNA network was generated. Moreover, the correlation between miR-181a-5p and pancreatitis metabolism related substances were studied and the serum concentration of inflammatory cytokines and miRNAs at different time points during the MSAP and SAP were investigated, respectively. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of miRNAs was studied. Significant changes in the serum concentration of the following miRNAs of HTAP patients (P<0.05) were discovered: miR24-3p, 361-5p, 1246, and 222-3p (constantly upregulated), and 181a-5p (constantly downregulated) (P<0.05). Bioinformatics analysis predicted that 13 GOs and 36 pathways regulated by overlap miRNAs were involved in glucose, fat, calcium (Ca++), and insulin metabolism (P<0.001). miRNA-mRNA network revealed that the overlap miRNAs targeted genes participating in pancreas metabolism and miR-181a-5p, the only downregulated miRNA, had good negative correlation with triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and fast blood glucose (FBG), but a positive correlation with Ca++. When compared with inflammatory cytokines, the changes of all five overlap miRNAs were more stable. It was found that when used for evaluating the progression of HTAP, miRNAs showed good AUC. These data suggested that serum miRNAs have the potential to be excellent HTAP biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W1968622115,"Different strategies for cooling the body prior to or during physical exercise have been shown to improve prolonged performance. Because of ethical and methodological issues, no studies conducted in humans have evaluated the changes in brain temperature promoted by cooling strategies. Therefore, our first aim sought to measure the hypothalamic temperature (Thyp) of rats subjected to treadmill running in a cold environment. Moreover, evidence suggests that Thyp and abdominal temperature (Tabd) are regulated by different physiological mechanisms. Thus, this study also investigated the dynamics of exercise-induced changes in Thyp and Tabd at two ambient temperatures: 25°C (temperate environment) and 12°C (cold). Adult male Wistar rats were used in these experiments. The rats were implanted with a guide cannula in the hypothalamus and a temperature sensor in the abdominal cavity. After recovery from this surgery, the rats were familiarized with running on a treadmill and were then subjected to the two experimental trials: constant-speed running (20 m/min) at 12°C and 25°C. Both Thyp and Tabd increased during exercise at 25°C. In contrast, Thyp and Tabd remained unchanged during fatiguing exercise at 12°C. The temperature differential (i.e., Thyp - Tabd) increased during the initial min of running at 25°C and thereafter decreased toward pre-exercise values. Interestingly, external cooling prevented this early increase in the temperature differential from the 2nd to the 8th min of running. In addition, the time until volitional fatigue was higher during the constant exercise at 12°C compared with 25°C. Together, our results indicate that Thyp and Tabd are regulated by different mechanisms in running rats and that external cooling affected the relationship between both temperature indexes observed during exercise without environmental thermal stress. Our data also suggest that attenuated hypothalamic hyperthermia may contribute to improved performance in cold environments."
https://openalex.org/W2089724253,"Depression and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are common comorbid diseases and highly prevalent in the clinical setting with an unclarified mechanism. Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF, fa/fa) rats natively develop T2D with hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Here we studied whether ZDF rats also innately develop depression, what a correlation is between depression and T2D, whether insulin receptor (IR) expression is involved in, and whether transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) would be beneficial in amelioration of the comorbidity. Six week old male ZDF and Zucker lean (ZL, fa/+) littermates were randomly divided into naïve (ZDF, n = 6; ZL, n = 7) and taVNS (ZDF-taVNS, n = 8; ZL-taVNS, n = 6) groups. Once daily 30 min-taVNS sessions were administrated under anesthesia for 34 consecutive days in taVNS groups. Blood glucose levels were tested weekly, and plasma glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc) level and immobility time in forced swimming test were determined on day 35 in all groups. The expression of insulin receptor (IR) in various tissues was also detected by immunostaining and Western blot. We found that naïve ZDF rats developed hyperglycemia steadily. These ZDF rats showed a strong positive correlation between longer immobility time and higher plasma HbAlC level. Long term taVNS treatment simultaneously prevented the development of depression-like behavior and progression of hyperglycemia in ZDF rats. The expression of IR in various tissues of naïve ZDF rats is lower than in naïve ZL and long-term taVNS treated ZDF rats. Collectively, our results indicate that in ZDF rats, i) depression and T2D develop simultaneously, ii) immobility time and HbAlc concentrations are highly and positively correlated, iii) a low expression of IR may be involved in the comorbidity of depression and T2D, and iv) taVNS is antidiabetic and antidepressive possibly through IR expression upregulation."
https://openalex.org/W2100443205,"Histone methylations have been implicated to play important roles in diverse cellular processes. Of particular interest is the methylation of histone H3K79, which is catalyzed by an evolutionarily conserved methyltransferase, disruptor of telomeric silencing (Dot1)-like (Dot1L). To investigate the role of Dot1L during vertebrate development, we have generated a Dot1Lspecific transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) nuclease to knockdown endogenous Dot1L in Xenopus tropicalis, a diploid species highly related to the well-known developmental model Xenopus laevis, a pseudotetraploid amphibian. We show that the TALEN was extremely efficient in mutating Dot1L when expressed in fertilized eggs, creating essentially Dot1L knockout embryos with little H3K79 methylation. Importantly, we observed that Dot1L knockdown had no apparent effect on embryogenesis because normally feeding tadpoles were formed, consistent with the lack of maternal Dot1L expression. On the other hand, Dot1L knockdown severely retarded the growth of the tadpoles and led to tadpole lethality prior to metamorphosis. These findings suggest that Dot1L and H3K79 methylation play an important role for tadpole growth and development prior to metamorphosis into a frog. Our findings further reveal interesting similarities and differences between Xenopus and mouse development and suggest the existence of 2 separate phases of vertebrate development with distinct requirements for epigenetic modifications.—Wen, L., Fu, L., Guo, X., Chen, Y., Shi, Y.-B.

https://openalex.org/W2003359831,"Objective Although plaque erosion causes approximately 40% of all coronary thrombi and disproportionally affects women more than men, its mechanism is not well understood. The role of tissue mechanics in plaque rupture and regulation of mechanosensitive inflammatory proteins is well established, but their role in plaque erosion is unknown. Given obvious differences in morphology between plaque erosion and rupture, we hypothesized that inflammation in general as well as the association between local mechanical strain and inflammation known to exist in plaque rupture may not occur in plaque erosion. Therefore, our objective was to determine if similar mechanisms underlie plaque rupture and plaque erosion. Methods and Results We studied a total of 74 human coronary plaque specimens obtained at autopsy. Using lesion-specific computer modeling of solid mechanics, we calculated the stress and strain distribution for each plaque and determined if there were any relationships with markers of inflammation. Consistent with previous studies, inflammatory markers were positively associated with increasing strain in specimens with rupture and thin-cap fibroatheromas. Conversely, overall staining for inflammatory markers and apoptosis were significantly lower in erosion, and there was no relationship with mechanical strain. Samples with plaque erosion most closely resembled those with the stable phenotype of thick-cap fibroatheromas. Conclusions In contrast to classic plaque rupture, plaque erosion was not associated with markers of inflammation and mechanical strain. These data suggest that plaque erosion is a distinct pathophysiological process with a different etiology and therefore raises the possibility that a different therapeutic approach may be required to prevent plaque erosion."
https://openalex.org/W2051927801,"β1 integrins (β1) transduce mechanical signals in many cells, including cardiac myocytes (CM). Given their close localization, as well as their role in mechanotransduction and signaling, we hypothesized that caveolin (Cav) proteins might regulate integrins in the CM. β1 localization, complex formation, activation state, and signaling were analyzed using wild-type, Cav3 knockout, and Cav3 CM-specific transgenic heart and myocyte samples. Studies were performed under basal and mechanically loaded conditions. We found that: 1) β1 and Cav3 colocalize in CM and coimmunoprecipitate from CM protein lysates; 2) β1 is detected in a subset of caveolae; 3) loss of Cav3 caused reduction of β1D integrin isoform and active β1 integrin from the buoyant domains in the heart; 4) increased expression of myocyte Cav3 correlates with increased active β1 integrin in adult CM; 5) in vivo pressure overload of the wild-type heart results in increased activated integrin in buoyant membrane domains along with increased association between active integrin and Cav3; and 6) Cav3-deficient myocytes have perturbed basal and stretch mediated signaling responses. Thus, Cav3 protein can modify integrin function and mechanotransduction in the CM and intact heart.—Israeli-Rosenberg, S., Chen, C., Li, R., Deussen, D. N., Niesman, I. R., Okada, H., Patel, H.

https://openalex.org/W2057965124,"The aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide and its deposition in parts of the brain form the central processes in the etiology of Alzheimer disease (AD). The low-molecular weight oligomers of Aβ aggregates (2 to 30 mers) are known to be the primary neurotoxic agents whose mechanisms of cellular toxicity and synaptic dysfunction have received substantial attention in the recent years. However, how these toxic agents proliferate and induce widespread amyloid deposition throughout the brain, and what mechanism is involved in the amplification and propagation of toxic oligomer species, are far from clear. Emerging evidence based on transgenic mice models indicates a transmissible nature of Aβ aggregates and implicates a prion-like mechanism of oligomer propagation, which manifests as the dissemination and proliferation of Aβ toxicity. Despite accumulating evidence in support of a transmissible nature of Aβ aggregates, a clear, molecular-level understanding of this intriguing mechanism is lacking. Recently, we reported the characterization of unique replicating oligomers of Aβ42 (12-24 mers) in vitro called Large Fatty Acid-derived Oligomers (LFAOs) (Kumar et al., 2012, J. Biol. Chem). In the current report, we establish that LFAOs possess physiological activity by activating NF-κB in human neuroblastoma cells, and determine the experimental parameters that control the efficiency of LFAO replication by self-propagation. These findings constitute the first detailed report on monomer - oligomer lateral propagation reactions that may constitute potential mechanism governing transmissibility among Aβ oligomers. These data support the previous reports on transmissible mechanisms observed in transgenic animal models."
https://openalex.org/W2027794157,"In the United States, policy initiatives aimed at increasing sources of renewable energy are advancing bioenergy production, especially in the Midwest region, where agricultural landscapes dominate. While policy directives are focused on renewable fuel production, biodiversity and ecosystem services will be impacted by the land-use changes required to meet production targets. Using data from field observations, we developed empirical models for predicting abundance, diversity, and community composition of flower-visiting bees based on land cover. We used these models to explore how bees might respond under two contrasting bioenergy scenarios: annual bioenergy crop production and perennial grassland bioenergy production. In the two scenarios, 600,000 ha of marginal annual crop land or marginal grassland were converted to perennial grassland or annual row crop bioenergy production, respectively. Model projections indicate that expansion of annual bioenergy crop production at this scale will reduce bee abundance by 0 to 71%, and bee diversity by 0 to 28%, depending on location. In contrast, converting annual crops on marginal soil to perennial grasslands could increase bee abundance from 0 to 600% and increase bee diversity between 0 and 53%. Our analysis of bee community composition suggested a similar pattern, with bee communities becoming less diverse under annual bioenergy crop production, whereas bee composition transitioned towards a more diverse community dominated by wild bees under perennial bioenergy crop production. Models, like those employed here, suggest that bioenergy policies have important consequences for pollinator conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2031908080,"The Barents Sea system is often depicted as a simple food web in terms of number of dominant feeding links. The most conspicuous feeding link is between the Northeast Arctic cod Gadus morhua, the world's largest cod stock which is presently at a historical high level, and capelin Mallotus villosus. The system also holds diverse seabird and marine mammal communities. Previous diet studies may suggest that these top predators (cod, bird and sea mammals) compete for food particularly with respect to pelagic fish such as capelin and juvenile herring (Clupea harengus), and krill. In this paper we explored the diet of some Barents Sea top predators (cod, Black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla, Common guillemot Uria aalge, and Minke whale Balaenoptera acutorostrata). We developed a GAM modelling approach to analyse the temporal variation diet composition within and between predators, to explore intra- and inter-specific interactions. The GAM models demonstrated that the seabird diet is temperature dependent while the diet of Minke whale and cod is prey dependent; Minke whale and cod diets depend on the abundance of herring and capelin, respectively. There was significant diet overlap between cod and Minke whale, and between kittiwake and guillemot. In general, the diet overlap between predators increased with changes in herring and krill abundances. The diet overlap models developed in this study may help to identify inter-specific interactions and their dynamics that potentially affect the stocks targeted by fisheries."

Prior studies demonstrated that the SCN5A variant encodes a channel that regulates phagocytosis, endosomal acidification, calcium signaling, and phenotypic differentiation in human macrophages. Unlike voltage-gated sodium channels in excitable tissues, this macrophage variant is expressed on endosomes intracellularly and not at the plasma membrane. Because of an exon deletion in the extracellular selectivity filter, channel activation does not elicit typical action potentials as in excitable tissues but does mediate ionic flux in response to pharmacological stimulation. Because this channel is not expressed in murine macrophages, in vivo characterization has been performed in a knock-in transgenic model (7.Rahgozar K. Wright E. Carrithers L.M.

The central questions of this study were to assess how an intracellular voltage-gated channel could mediate innate immune signaling, regulate transcription, and function as a pathogen sensor. In mouse macrophages that express the human SCN5A variant and primary human monocyte-derived macrophages, we demonstrate that channel expression and activation are associated with a signaling pathway that links activation of a calcium-dependent adenylate cyclase isoform, ADCY8, to the transcription factor ATF2. In an ATF2-dependent manner, SCN5A expression and activation in macrophages regulates expression of host antiviral response genes, Sp100 and β-interferon (IFNB), and an innate immune signaling pathway initiated by cytosolic poly(I:C). Channel activation by poly(I:C) markedly increases an inward voltage-sensitive sodium current and decreases a nonspecific outward current. Experimental mouse strains (C57BL6cfms-hSCN5A) were bred at our on-campus breeding facility (Biotron Facility), where our transgenic colony is maintained. Experimental mice were transferred to an approved University of Wisconsin animal facility for the performance and monitoring of all in vivo experiments. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from the National Institutes of Health. The protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Wisconsin, Madison (protocol numbers M024031 and M02544). Genotyping was performed at Mouse Genotype (Escondido, CA). Primary mouse bone marrow cells were obtained from femurs and tibias of transgenic and wild type littermate control mice and were differentiated to macrophages in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, and mCSF (macrophage colony stimulating factor, 20 ng/ml) for 7–10 days. Human CD14+ peripheral blood monocytes were obtained from Lonza and differentiated to macrophages in the same media.

Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages from transgenic and littermate controls were lysed by passage through a 27-gauge needle in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Scientific Pierce). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and incubated with rabbit anti-NaV1.5 (SCN5A, Alomone Labs) at a 1:100 dilution and anti-rabbit magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi) for 15 min. Beads were then applied to a micro-column, washed, and collected by elution and subsequent centrifugation. Nano LC-MS/MS was performed at Applied Biomics (Hayward, CA). For sample preparation, proteins were exchanged into 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer. DTT was added to a final concentration of 10 mm and incubated at 60 °C for 30 min, followed by cooling down to room temperature. Iodoacetamide was then added to a final concentration of 10 mm and incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. The proteins were then digested by trypsin (Promega) overnight at 37 °C. Nano-LC was carried out using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 (Milford, MA). Mobile phase solvents A and B were 0.1% TFA (v/v) in water and 0.1% TFA (v/v) in 80% acetonitrile, respectively. Tryptic peptides were loaded into a μ-Precolumn Cartridge and separated on an acetonitrile gradient (ranging from 5 to 60%) on a Nano LC column. Fractions were collected at 20-s intervals followed by mass spectrometry analysis on AB SCIEX TOF/TOFTM 5800 system (AB SCIEX). Mass spectra were acquired in reflectron positive ion mode. TOF/TOF tandem MS fragmentation spectra were acquired for each ion, averaging 4000 laser shots per fragmentation spectrum (excluding trypsin autolytic peptides and other known background ions). Both of the resulting peptide mass and the associated fragmentation spectra were submitted to GPS Explorer workstation equipped with MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK) to search the database of Swiss-Prot. Searches were performed without constraining protein molecular weight or isoelectric point, with variable carbamidomethylation of cysteine and oxidation of methionine residues, and with one missed cleavage also allowed in the search parameters. One-dimensional Western blot was performed by Applied Biomics (Hayward, CA). For sample preparation, lysate or immunoprecipitation pellets were exchanged into cell lysis buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, containing 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, and 4% CHAPS). Protein concentration was measured using Bio-Rad protein assay method. For each sample, 30 μg of protein was mixed with 1.0 μl of diluted CyDye and kept in the dark on ice for 10 min. The labeling reaction was stopped by adding 1.0 μl of 10 mm lysine to each sample and incubating in dark on ice for an additional 15 min. The labeled samples were then mixed with 120 μg of unlabeled material and exchanged into SDS gel loading buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 4% (w/v) SDS, 0.2% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 20% (v/v) glycerol); DTT was added to the final concentration of 200 mm. The sample was heated at 95 °C for 5 min before loading into the wells. The SDS gels were run at 15 °C. Gel images were scanned immediately following SDS-PAGE using Typhoon TRIO (GE Healthcare). The gels were transferred to Immobilon-FL PVDF membranes (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA), and the resulting images were immediately scanned using Typhoon TRIO. Membranes were blocked in 2.5% fish gelatin for 2 h with shaking. The membranes were then incubated in primary antibodies (mouse anti-ATF2 and rabbit anti-phospho-ATF2, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) in 1× TBST buffer with shaking overnight. The membranes were washed four times, 10 min each, with shaking in 1× TBST buffer. The membranes were then incubated using CyDye-conjugated secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:2000 in 1× TBST buffer with shaking for 2 h. The membranes were then washed four times, 10 min each, with shaking in 1× TBST buffer. The membranes were dried, and the images were scanned using Typhoon TRIO. The scanned images were then analyzed by ImageJ. For immunofluorescence staining, cell monolayers were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, and blocked in PBS containing 5% serum, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1% BSA. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution. For primary antibody staining, anti-ATF2 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (goat antiphospho-ATF2-Thr-71; rabbit anti-ATF2 C terminus; 1:50 dilution), and isotype controls were from eBioscience. Alexa dye-labeled secondary antibodies (donkey anti-goat and anti-rabbit) were from Invitrogen. Rhodamine-labeled poly(I:C) was obtained from Invivogen, and staining was performed on live cells at 200 ng/ml for 20 min. Treated cells were washed extensively with PBS prior to fixation and imaging. Fluorescent images were acquired and analyzed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescent microscope equipped with an Axiocam-MRm CCD camera (Zeiss) and AxioVision version 4.8 software. Primary cells were transfected in serum-free OptiMEM media that contained 100 nm retinoic acid using the TransIT X2 transfection reagent (Mirus) and pooled ON-TARGETplus siRNA for each target (Dharmacon). Cells were maintained in media with transfection complexes for 48 h prior to experiments. Knockdown was confirmed by QPCR and was greater than 75%. For QPCR experiments, cells were treated with veratridine (100 μm; Tocris) or DMSO vehicle in OptiMEM media. For immunoprecipitation and live cell imaging experiments, treatment was performed in HBSS supplemented with 10 mm Hepes. Poly(I:C) (LMW; Invivogen) complexes for acute treatments (2 h) were generated in OptiMEM using 10 μg/ml poly(I:C) and 30 μl of TransIT X2 transfection reagent/ml media (30 min at 25 °C). For transfected and naked poly(I:C), the final concentration during cell treatments was 200 ng/ml. RNA purification, reverse transcription, QPCR, and data analysis were performed as described previously (5.Carrithers L.M. Hulseberg P. Sandor M.

Data were acquired on a Cepheid SmartCycler and analyzed by the ΔCt method with normalization to either mouse GAPDH or human hydroxymethylbilane synthase. The following TaqMan primers were obtained from Applied Biosystems/Invitrogen: Hs00165693_m1 (human SCN5A), Mm99999915_g1 (mouse Gapdh), Mm00449735_m1 (mouse Sp100), Mm04204797_m1 (mouse Gm7609), Hs00162109_m1 (human SP100), Hs01077958_s1 (human IFNB1), AIGJQ71 (HSV thymidine kinase), and AIHSPDQ (HSV glycoprotein B (8.Mott K.R.

Labeling, hybridization, and scanning were performed at the Gene Expression Center at the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center (Madison, WI). Affymetrix mouse 2.0ST whole transcriptome arrays were utilized. Data were analyzed using NetAffx software (Affymetrix). Fold change (hSCN5A-transgenic macrophages versus wild type cells) and p values were based on three separate RNA preparations for each condition. Primary mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages and human monocyte-derived macrophages were grown on collagen-coated glass coverslips (Mat-Tek). siRNA treatment was performed 48 h prior to use in experiments. For imaging, cells were maintained with HBSS supplemented with 10 mm Hepes and treated with either veratridine (100 μm) or DMSO vehicle. Live cell imaging was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescent microscope with a ×40/0.75 objective (Neofluar) in an environmental chamber, and time lapse images were acquired with a QuantEM:512SC EMCCD camera. Time-lapse sequences were acquired using Zeiss AxioVision 4.6.3 software and analyzed using the Time Series Analyzer plugin (Balaji) for ImageJ software (rsb.info.nih.gov). Subsequent statistical analysis was performed using KaleidaGraph (Synergy) and MATLAB (MathWorks). For single cell detection of cAMP, mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages were transfected with a plasmid encoding human GFP-labeled CNGA2 (cyclic nucleotide-gated channel). Two days later, cells were labeled with the red fluorescent dye DiSBAC2(3) (9.Willoughby D. Cooper D.M. Live-cell imaging of cAMP dynamics.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cells were observed in the presence and absence of veratridine, a sodium channel agonist (100 μm at 100 s). Background fluorescent responses over time in DiSBAC2(3) labeled cells were measured in GFP-negative cells. Responses in GFP-positive cells were acquired in the time-lapse mode (every 10 s for 720 s) by AxioVision software, and background responses were subtracted. Further analysis was performed using ImageJ and MATLAB (MathWorks). Normalized fluorescent responses (fluorescent ratio, Ft/F0) versus time were plotted. For calcium measurements, human monocyte derived macrophages were labeled with 1 μm Fluo 4 NW (Invitrogen) for 30 min. Images were acquired every 10 s for 600 s and then analyzed using ImageJ and MATLAB. cAMP concentration in lysates from monocyte-derived macrophages was determined by a commercially available ELISA kit (colorimetric; Cell Biolabs, San Diego). Plates were scanned on a Victor3 plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and data were analyzed using KaleidaGraph. Monocyte-derived macrophages were infected with HSV-1 (KOS strain, ATCC VR-1493) for 2 h at a multiplicity of infection of 1:1 in HBSS supplemented with 10 mm Hepes. Cells were washed and incubated for an additional 22 h in HBSS/Hepes prior to assays. Whole cell patch clamp analysis of transfected HEK-293F cells that were grown as suspension cultures was performed on a planar chip system (Nanion, Munich, Germany). Microchips had an equivalent resistance of 2–5 megohms. Cells were placed on the microchip, and giga-ohm seals (1–4 giga-ohms) were obtained with an automated suction device (port-a-patch). Mean cell capacitance was 6.7 ± 0.3 picofarads (n = 9). Whole cell currents were recorded for 20 millisiemens in 20-mV increments from −120 to +60 mV utilizing pClamp 10.3.1 software. Data were acquired at a sampling frequency of 20 kHz and a low pass Bessel filter setting at 5 kHz. Capacitative transients and series resistance were compensated (∼80%) with amplifier settings (Axopatch 200B) in conjunction with pClamp software. P/4 leak subtraction was performed for all recordings used for analysis. All recordings were performed at room temperature. Intracellular solutions (pH 7.2, 285 mosm) contained either 50 mm CsCl, 10 mm NaCl, 60 mm cesium fluoride, 20 mm EGTA, and 10 mm Hepes (cesium internal solution) or 50 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 60 mm potassium fluoride, 20 mm EGTA, and 10 mm Hepes (potassium internal solution). For experiments with poly(I:C) treatment, 200 ng/ml LMW poly(I:C) was added directly to the internal solution of the microchip. Extracellular solutions (pH 7.4, 298 mosm) contained either 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm d-glucose, and 10 mm Hepes (sodium external solution) or 100 mm NMDG, 30 mm CaCl2, 10 mm d-glucose, and 20 mm Hepes (NMDG-calcium external solution). As indicated, ambroxol (50 μm final concentration), an inhibitor of tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels, was added to the external bath solution. Data were analyzed as indicated using ImageJ, AxioVision, KaleidaGraph (Student's t test and ANOVA), MATLAB, and pClamp. Although prior work suggested that SCN5A plays a central role in human macrophage regulation, its intracellular signaling mechanisms remained unknown. Our initial goal in this study was to identify potentially novel signaling mechanisms for SCN5A in macrophages by using an unbiased, discovery-based approach. To identify potential signaling mechanisms, immunoprecipitation of SCN5A from bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from C57BL6cfms-hSCN5A mice was performed to analyze its interactions by nano-LC-MS/MS. These transgenic mice express the human macrophage splice variant of SCN5A under the control of a macrophage-specific promoter (7.Rahgozar K. Wright E. Carrithers L.M. Carrithers M.D. Mediation of protection and recovery from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by macrophages expressing the human voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.5.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2013; 72: 489-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Nano-LC/MS analysis demonstrated known and novel protein-protein interactions with human SCN5A (C.I. >95%). Consistent with prior studies of the cardiac channel variant, the macrophage variant binds to PDZ (PSD95/Dlg/ZO-1 domain) (10.Ou Y. Strege P. Miller S.M. Makielski J. Ackerman M. Gibbons S.J. Farrugia G. Syntrophin γ2 regulates SCN5A gating by a PDZ domain-mediated interaction.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1915-1923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and ankyrin-domain containing proteins (11.Mohler P.J. Rivolta I. Napolitano C. LeMaillet G. Lambert S. Priori S.G. Bennett V. Nav1.5 E1053K mutation causing Brugada syndrome blocks binding to ankyrin-G and expression of Nav1.5 on the surface of cardiomyocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 17533-17538Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar); these interactions mediate connections to the cytoskeleton (data not shown). In addition, consistent with prior cellular analysis of SCN5A subcellular localization in macrophages, the channel interacts with proteins found in acidic organelles such as late endosomes (4.Carrithers M.D. Dib-Hajj S. Carrithers L.M. Tokmoulina G. Pypaert M. Jonas E.A. Waxman S.G. Expression of the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.5 in the macrophage late endosome regulates endosomal acidification.J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 7822-7832Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and lysosomes. These included lysosomal acid phosphatase and a proton transporter. These findings provided an initial validation measure for the specificity of the immunoprecipitation and nano-LC/MS analysis. In addition to known interactions, a novel interaction was identified (Table 1) between SCN5A and the cAMP-dependent transcription factor ATF2 that is relevant to cellular signaling and transcriptional regulation. To confirm the protein-protein interaction with ATF2, Western blot analysis following immunoprecipitation for macrophage SCN5A was performed (Fig. 1). Co-immunoprecipitation of ATF2 was observed in transgenic BMDM but not in the wild type condition. Although co-immunoprecipitation does not demonstrate direct binding, the results suggested a possible association within a subcellular signaling complex. Based on these results, it was reasoned that macrophage SCN5A could regulate ATF2-dependent transcription.TABLE 1Mass spectroscopy analysis of SCN5A-ATF2 protein-protein interaction Open table in a new tab When ATF2 is activated in the cytosol through phosphorylation, it translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus. Treatment of SCN5A+ macrophages with veratridine (100 μm for 15 min), a voltage-gated sodium channel agonist, resulted in a significant increase in phosphorylated ATF2 (Thr-71 phosphorylation site) in the nucleus (Fig. 2A). This translocation and increase in phosphorylated ATF2 was significantly greater than that observed in wild type cells. To confirm these results, Western blot analysis was performed and demonstrated increased levels of phospho-ATF2 in SCN5A+ macrophages that were treated with veratridine but no related increase in wild type cells (Fig. 2B). Because cAMP can activate ATF2 (12.Liao H. Hyman M.C. Baek A.E. Fukase K. Pinsky D.J. cAMP/CREB-mediated transcriptional regulation of ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 (CD39) expression.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14791-14805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), this interaction provides a potential link between channel activation, cAMP signaling, and transcriptional pathways. Based on these findings, it was hypothesized that SCN5A regulates cellular phenotype and function through regulation of downstream transcriptional mechanisms. To assess this possible mechanism, global gene expression analysis was performed on BMDM from transgenic and wild type littermate mice (Fig. 3A). In the absence of any exogenous treatment, there was a statistically significant increase in the expression of genes (Gm7609 and Sp100rs) that are duplications or fusion variants of mouse Sp100 (13.Guldner H.H. Szostecki C. Schröder P. Matschl U. Jensen K. Lüders C. Will H. Sternsdorf T. Splice variants of the nuclear dot-associated Sp100 protein contain homologies to HMG-1 and a human nuclear phosphoprotein-box motif.J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 733-747PubMed Google Scholar). Most variants of Sp100 localize to a specialized nuclear structure called the nuclear body; it can function as a transcriptional repressor, mediate antiviral host defense, and regulate mRNA splicing and translation. Many of these variants are splice variants of the Sp100 gene. However, the mouse Sp100rs and Gm7609 variants are gene duplications with distinct promoter regions. Gm7609 is a fusion gene that contains Csprs (component of Sp100rs), the 5′ portion of Sp100, and a predicted G-protein domain. To validate the microarray analysis, QPCR analysis was performed to analyze mRNA expression of mouse Gm7609 and the 3′ region of Sp100. As described above, Gm7609 contains unique domains and the 5′ region of Sp100. Consistent with the microarray data, significantly increased expression of Gm7609 mRNA was observed in SCN5A+ macrophages as compared with wild type cells but not in transcripts that contain the 3′ region of Sp100 (Fig. 3B and Table 2). These results suggested that expression of human macrophage SCN5A in mouse BMDM increases expression of an ATF2-regulated gene.TABLE 2QPCR analysis of hSCN5A+ bone marrow-derived macrophages demonstrates increased expression of mouse Gm7609 mRNA but not Sp100 transcripts that contain the 3′ gene sequencesConditionSp100-related Gm7609 mRNA copies/Gapdh × 10−5Sp100 3′ region copies/Gapdh × 10−2hSCN5A-untreated8.0 ± 0.8ap < 0.01 (Student t test, n = 5).1.5 ± 0.1Wild type-untreated2.7 ± 0.7ap < 0.01 (Student t test, n = 5).1.8 ± 0.2a p < 0.01 (Student t test, n = 5). Open table in a new tab The next goal was to determine whether channel activation regulates this pathway. Activity-dependent regulation of gene transcription occurs in neurons to regulate cellular plasticity and memory. Based on this mechanism, it was reasoned that channel activation in macrophages also could be associated with transcriptional regulation. To test this hypothesis, expression of Gm7609 transcripts was examined in the presence and absence of pharmacological activation. Treatment with the channel agonist veratridine (100 μm for 2 h) induced an early transcriptional response in transgenic cells but not wild type (Fig. 3C and Table 3). This increase in Gm7609 transcripts was ∼3–4-fold greater than that observed in the untreated condition. There was no effect on the expression of transcripts that contain the 3′ region of Sp100.TABLE 3Veratridine treatment increases Gm7609 transcription in hSCN5A+ BMDMConditionSp100-related Gm7609 mRNA copies/Gapdh × 10−5hSCN5A-veratridine29.5 ± 4.5ap < 0.01 for hSCN5A-veratridine treated versus all conditions (ANOVA, n = 5).hSCN5A-DMSO vehicle3.6 ± 0.1ap < 0.01 for hSCN5A-veratridine treated versus all conditions (ANOVA, n = 5).Wild type-veratridine1.6 ± 0.1ap < 0.01 for hSCN5A-veratridine treated versus all conditions (ANOVA, n = 5).Wild type-DMSO vehicle1.5 ± 0.1ap < 0.01 for hSCN5A-veratridine treated versus all conditions (ANOVA, n = 5).a p < 0.01 for hSCN5A-veratridine treated versus all conditions (ANOVA, n = 5).

Simultaneously, insect-triggered generation of superoxide anion radicals (O2•−) in infested Z. mays plants was monitored. Quantified parameters were measured at 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48 and 72 h post-initial aphid infestation (hpi) in relation to the non-infested control seedlings. Significant increases in gst transcript amounts were recorded in aphid-stressed plants in comparison to the control seedlings. Maximal enhancement in the expression of the gst genes in aphid-attacked maize plants was found at 8 hpi (gst23) or 24 hpi (gst1, gst18 and gst24) compared to the control. Investigated Z. mays cultivars formed excessive superoxide anion radicals in response to insect treatments, and the highest overproduction of O2•− was noted 4 or 8 h after infestation, depending on the aphid treatment and maize genotype. Importantly, the Ambrozja variety could be characterized as having more profound increments in the levels of gst transcript abundance and O2•− generation in comparison with the Tasty Sweet genotype."
https://openalex.org/W2062644181,"Purpose We describe a novel approach to analyze fluorescein angiography to investigate fluorescein flow dynamics in the rat posterior retina as well as identify abnormal areas following laser photocoagulation. Methods Experiments were undertaken in adult Long Evans rats. Using a rodent retinal camera, videos were acquired at 30 frames per second for 30 seconds following intravenous introduction of sodium fluorescein in a group of control animals (n = 14). Videos were image registered and analyzed using principle components analysis across all pixels in the field. This returns fluorescence intensity profiles from which, the half-rise (time to 50% brightness), half-fall (time for 50% decay) back to an offset (plateau level of fluorescence). We applied this analysis to video fluorescein angiography data collected 30 minutes following laser photocoagulation in a separate group of rats (n = 7). Results Pixel-by-pixel analysis of video angiography clearly delineates differences in the temporal profiles of arteries, veins and capillaries in the posterior retina. We find no difference in half-rise, half-fall or offset amongst the four quadrants (inferior, nasal, superior, temporal). We also found little difference with eccentricity. By expressing the parameters at each pixel as a function of the number of standard deviation from the average of the entire field, we could clearly identify the spatial extent of the laser injury. Conclusions This simple registration and analysis provides a way to monitor the size of vascular injury, to highlight areas of subtle vascular leakage and to quantify vascular dynamics not possible using current fluorescein angiography approaches. This can be applied in both laboratory and clinical settings for in vivo dynamic fluorescent imaging of vasculature."

https://openalex.org/W2054484947,"In grapevine, fruit abscission is known to occur within the first two to three weeks after flowering, but the reason why some berries in a cluster persist and others abscise is not yet understood. Ethylene sensitivity modulates abscission in several fruit species, based on a mechanism where continuous polar auxin transport across the pedicel results in a decrease in ethylene perception, which prevents abscission. In grapevine, flowering takes about four to seven days in a single cluster, thus while some flowers are developing into berries, others are just starting to open. So, in this work it was assessed whether uneven flowering accounted for differences in berry abscission dependent on polar auxin transport and ethylene-related gene expression. For this, flowers that opened in a cluster were tagged daily, which allowed to separately analyze berries, regarding their ability to persist. It was found that berries derived from flowers that opened the day that flowering started – named as “first berries” – had lower abscission rate than berries derived from flowers that opened during the following days – named as “late berries”. Use of radiolabeled auxin showed that “first berries” had higher polar auxin transport, correlated with lower ethylene content and lower ethylene-related transcript abundance than “late berries”. When “first berries” were treated with a polar auxin transport inhibitor they showed higher ethylene-related transcript abundance and were more prone to abscise than control berries. This study provides new insights on fruit abscission control. Our results indicate that polar auxin transport sustains the ability of “first berries” to persist in the cluster during grapevine abscission and also suggest that this could be associated with changes in ethylene-related gene expression."

Native non-food bioenergy plants are also considered to be a wise choice to reduce the threat of invasive plants. In this study, the impacts of climate change (a consensus of IPCC scenarios A2a for 2080) on the potential distribution of nine non-food bioenergy plants native to China (viz., Pistacia chinensis, Cornus wilsoniana, Xanthoceras sorbifolia, Vernicia fordii, Sapium sebiferum, Miscanthus sinensis, M. floridulus, M. sacchariflorus and Arundo donax) were analyzed using a MaxEnt species distribution model. The suitable habitats of the nine non-food plants were distributed in the regions east of the Mongolian Plateau and the Tibetan Plateau, where the arable land is primarily used for food production. Thus, the large-scale cultivation of those plants for energy production will have to rely on the marginal lands. The variables of “precipitation of the warmest quarter” and “annual mean temperature” were the most important bioclimatic variables for most of the nine plants according to the MaxEnt modeling results. Global warming in coming decades may result in a decrease in the extent of suitable habitat in the tropics but will have little effect on the total distribution area of each plant. The results indicated that it will be possible to grow these plants on marginal lands within these areas in the future. This work should be beneficial for the domestication and cultivation of those bioenergy plants and should facilitate land-use planning for bioenergy crops in China."

Cell suspensions of BG01V/hOG and H9 hESC lines were pipetted into non-adherent hydrogel substrates containing defined microwell arrays. hEBs of consistent size and spherical geometry can be formed in each of the four conditions, including the -ROCKi/-spin condition. The hEBs formed under the -ROCKi/-spin condition differentiated to develop the three embryonic germ layers and tissues derived from each of the germ layers. This simplified hEB production technique offers homogeneity in hEB size and shape to support synchronous differentiation, elimination of the ROCKi xeno-factor and rate-limiting centrifugation treatment, and low-cost scalability, which will directly support automated, large-scale production of hEBs and hESC-derived cells needed for clinical, research, or therapeutic applications."

In vitro RNA dimerization of HIV-1 transcripts was prevented by formation of the so-called long distance interaction (LDI) conformation in which the DIS sequences are engaged in an intramolecular, long distance base pairing interaction with the upstream poly(A) hairpin (Fig. 1). As a result, the DIS palindrome is not available for initiating RNA dimer formation. Alternative HIV-1 RNA folding schemes have recently been proposed (15.Lu K. Heng X. Garyu L. Monti S. Garcia E.L.

This inhibition of RNA dimerization could be relieved by heat treatment or incubation with the HIV-1 nucleocapsid chaperone protein (9.Feng Y.X. Copeland T.D. Henderson L.E. Gorelick R.J. Bosche W.J. Levin J.G. Rein A. HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein induces “maturation” of dimeric retroviral RNA in vitro.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Two alternating structures of the HIV-1 leader RNA.RNA. 2001; 7: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Both treatments trigger refolding of the LDI conformation into the dimerization-competent BMH (branched multiple hairpin) structure, which exposes the DIS hairpin (Fig. 1B). Infectious HIV-1 particles contain two genomic RNA molecules that are noncovalently linked near their 5′ end, possibly at more than one position (19.Höglund S. Ohagen A. Goncalves J. Panganiban A.T. Gabuzda D. Ultrastructure of HIV-1 genomic RNA.Virology. 1997; 233: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It is thought that the native dimer structure of the RNA genome is important for its efficient reverse transcription into DNA, a complex process that includes two strand transfer events (20.van Wamel J.L. Berkhout B. The first strand transfer during HIV-1 reverse transcription can occur either intramolecularly or intermolecularly.Virology. 1998; 244: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). RNA genome dimers are also thought to facilitate recombination during reverse transcription, which contributes to the generation of HIV genetic diversity (21.Moore M.D. Hu W.S. HIV-1 RNA dimerization: it takes two to tango.AIDS Rev. 2009; 11: 91-102PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Nikolaitchik O.A. Galli A. Moore M.D. Pathak V.K. Hu W.S.

Virol. 2007; 81: 4002-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Studies on the conformation of genomic RNA inside virus particles are intrinsically difficult. Early electron microscopy studies indicated multiple RNA-RNA contacts along the dimeric genome, with the most stable interaction located near the 5′ ends (25.Bender W. Davidson N. Mapping of poly(A) sequences in the electron microscope reveals unusual structure of type C oncornavirus RNA molecules.Cell. 1976; 7: 595-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Stabilization of the RNA dimer was reported during maturation of newly assembled virion particles, but details on the molecular events remained obscure (26.Fu W. Rein A.

Dimeric RNA recognition regulates HIV-1 genome packaging.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003249Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, some studies suggested that the DIS palindrome is dispensable for RNA dimerization in vivo: its deletion or alteration to a smaller palindromic sequence does not affect RNA dimer stability inside virus particles, although RNA packaging was reduced (6.Berkhout B. van Wamel J.L. Role of the DIS hairpin in replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6723-6732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, cell type-specific DIS defects were reported (31.Hill M.K. Shehu-Xhilaga M. Campbell S.M. Poumbourios P. Crowe S.M. Mak J.

However, such studies require a careful analysis because leader mutations may induce RNA misfolding and conformational changes that indirectly trigger or impede RNA dimerization (38.Das A.T.

Full-length HIV-1 RNA genomes are selected from an excess of cellular and subgenomic viral RNA during the virus assembly process and encapsidated by the Gag proteins. RNA dimerization and packaging are tightly linked processes: if proper RNA dimerization is compromised, the virus particles contain less genomic RNA and are less infectious (6.Berkhout B. van Wamel J.L. Role of the DIS hairpin in replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6723-6732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Ohishi M. Nakano T. Sakuragi S. Shioda T. Sano K.

Iwamoto A. Shioda T. Possible role of dimerization in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 genome RNA packaging.J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4060-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The initial RNA-RNA dimer is formed in the virus-producing cell and is subsequently packaged. During virus particle maturation the stability of the HIV-1 RNA dimer increases, which depends on viral Protease activity and processing of the Gag-Pol polyprotein (27.Song R. Kafaie J. Yang L. Laughrea M. HIV-1 viral RNA is selected in the form of monomers that dimerize in a three-step protease-dependent process; the DIS of stem-loop 1 initiates viral RNA dimerization.J. Mol.

In general, not much is known about the actual RNA-RNA contacts during virion assembly and subsequent maturation. Possibly, this dimer maturation process is analogous to the stabilizing RNA rearrangements that are observed in vitro when the KL dimer is converted into the ED. Unfortunately, classical RNA probing studies cannot discriminate between the KL and ED conformations because the same nucleotides are involved in these intra- and intermolecular base pairing schemes. Therefore, the molecular nature of the structural transition from fragile to stable RNA dimers inside virions remains elusive. Moore et al. (24.Moore M.D. Fu W. Nikolaitchik O. Chen J. Ptak R.G. Hu W.S. Dimer initiation signal of human immunodeficiency virus type 1: its role in partner selection during RNA copackaging and its effects on recombination.J. Virol. 2007; 81: 4002-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) created DIS mutants that, at least in vitro, can form KL dimers, but not ED. Their experiments indicated that ED formation is not required for the initial RNA partner selection, subsequent RNA packaging, and the process of recombination. This does not exclude other roles for the ED in HIV-1 replication. The initial interaction between Gag and viral RNA during assembly and packaging has been studied in detail (44.Jouvenet N. Simon S.M. Bieniasz P.D. Imaging the interaction of HIV-1 genomes and Gag during assembly of individual viral particles.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 19114-19119Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 45.Kutluay S.B. Bieniasz P.D. Analysis of the initiating events in HIV-1 particle assembly and genome packaging.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1001200Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of ED formation on virus replication, we analyzed a set of HIV-1 variants with mutations that affect the DIS hairpin (13.Abbink T.E. Ooms M. Haasnoot P.C. Berkhout B. The HIV-1 leader RNA conformational switch regulates RNA dimerization but does not regulate mRNA translation.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9058-9066Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Virus replication was severely affected by alteration of a three-nucleotide motif (GGA triplet) immediately upstream of the DIS hairpin. Further analysis demonstrated that this mutation reduced in vitro ED formation and the amount of RNA dimers in virions. The crippled HIV-1 mutants were allowed to evolve by selection of faster replicating revertant viruses. Characterization of these variants confirmed the importance of the GGA triplet in both ED formation and viral replication. The 5′ leader mutations (J8, J9, and J10) were introduced in the HIV-1 molecular clone pLAI (46.Peden K. Emerman M. Montagnier L. Changes in growth properties on passage in tissue culture of viruses derived from infectious molecular clones of HIV-1LAI, HIV-1MAL, and HIV-1ELI.Virology. 1991; 185: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and the pLAI-R37 derivative (13.Abbink T.E. Ooms M. Haasnoot P.C. Berkhout B. The HIV-1 leader RNA conformational switch regulates RNA dimerization but does not regulate mRNA translation.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9058-9066Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). pLAI-R37 has a deletion in the R-U5 region of the 3′ LTR. The WT 3′ LTR is restored during the reverse transcription process in the first round of virus replication (47.Berkhout B. van Wamel J. Klaver B. Requirements for DNA strand transfer during reverse transcription in mutant HIV-1 virions.J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). C33A human cervix carcinoma cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 20 mm glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were grown in 2 cm2 wells and transfected with 1 μg of WT or mutant pLAI-R37 DNA by the calcium phosphate method, as previously described (48.Das A.T. Zhou X. Vink M. Klaver B. Verhoef K.

Two days post-transfection, the supernatant was harvested, and the cells were lysed in PBS containing 1% Empigen-BB. The intracellular and supernatant CA-p24 level was determined by ELISA (49.Jeeninga R.E. Jan B. van den Berg H. Berkhout B.

SupT1 T cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells (10 × 106) were transfected with 250 ng or 1 μg of pLAI-R37 DNA by electroporation (250 V, 975 microfarad) using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II as previously described (48.Das A.T. Zhou X. Vink M.

The CA-p24 level in the culture medium was determined by ELISA. For virus evolution, 15 × 106 cells were transfected with 40 μg of pLAI-R37 DNA by electroporation and immediately split into six cultures. The protocol for virus evolution by prolonged cell-free passage of virus onto fresh, uninfected SupT1 cells was described previously (50.Berkhout B. Das A.T. Virus evolution as a tool to study HIV-1 biology.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 485: 436-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Isolation of total cellular DNA was performed by Tween 20/proteinase K treatment (51.Das A.T. Klaver B. Klasens B.I. van Wamel J.L. Berkhout B. A conserved hairpin motif in the R-U5 region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA genome is essential for replication.J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2346-2356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LTR leader region was PCR-amplified with primers T7-1 and TA014 (13.Abbink T.E. Ooms M. Haasnoot P.C. Berkhout B. The HIV-1 leader RNA conformational switch regulates RNA dimerization but does not regulate mRNA translation.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9058-9066Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The PCR products were sequenced directly, thus providing the population sequence of the viral quasispecies. PCR products were also cloned in the pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The HindIII-ClaI fragment of selected clones was used to replace the corresponding fragment in pBlue-5′ LTR (52.Klaver B. Berkhout B. Evolution of a disrupted TAR RNA hairpin structure in the HIV-1 virus.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2650-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The plasmid contains the XbaI-ClaI fragment of the infectious pLAI clone, including the 5′ LTR promoter sequence, the full-length leader sequence, and part of the Gag open reading frame (−454/+376, relative to the transcriptional start site at +1). Subsequently, the progeny XbaI-ClaI fragments were cloned into pLAI-R37. The constructs were verified by BigDye terminator sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). TZM-bl cells (53.Wei X.

TZM-bl cells were grown to 60% confluency in 2-cm2 wells and infected with WT or mutant C33A-produced virus (corresponding to 10 ng of CA-p24) in the presence of 80 μg/ml DEAE dextran. The cells were washed with PBS 2 days after infection and lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega). The firefly luciferase was measured in cell lysates with the luciferase assay kit (Promega). The pLAI-based plasmids were used as template in a PCR with primers T7–2 and R:A368-A347 (complementary to nt +368 to +347 of the HIV-1 LAI genome with the transcription start site at +1). The PCR products were ethanol-precipitated and in vitro transcribed with the megashortscript T7 transcription kit (Ambion) in the presence of 1 μl of [α-32P]UTP (0.33 MBq/μl; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Transcription reaction mixtures were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, and the reactions were stopped by DNase treatment. The RNA was ethanol-precipitated, dissolved in water, and quantified by scintillation counting. To test the quality of the RNA, 20 ng of 32P-labeled RNA was incubated for 5 min at 85 °C in formamide-containing loading buffer (Ambion) and analyzed on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel. Dimerization was performed with 20 ng of 32P-labeled RNA in 24 μl of dimerization buffer (83 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 125 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2). The mixture was heated for 2 min at 85 °C, incubated for 10 min at 65 °C, and slowly cooled to room temperature for renaturing and dimerization.

https://openalex.org/W1970172196,"In the spring and summer of each year, large patches of submersed aquatic macrophytes overgrow the bottom of the alluvial Warta River downstream of a large dam reservoir owing to water management practices. Environmental variables, macroinvertebrates (zoobenthos and epiphytic fauna, zooplankton) and fish abundance and biomass were assessed at this biologically productive habitat to learn intraseasonal dynamics of food types, and their occurrence in the gut contents of small-sized roach, dace, perch, ruffe and three-spined stickleback. Gut fullness coefficient, niche breadth and niche overlap indicated how the fishes coexist in the macrophytes. Chironomidae dominated in the diet of the percids. However, ruffe consumed mostly benthic chironomids, while perch epiphytic chironomids and zooplankton. The diet of dace resembled that in fast flowing water although this rheophilic species occurred at unusual density there. The generalist roach displayed the lowest gut fullness coefficient values and widest niche breadth; consequently, intraspecific rather than interspecific competition decided the fate of roach. Three-spined stickleback differed from the other fishes by consuming epiphytic simuliids and fish eggs. The diet overlap between fishes reaching higher gut fullness coefficient values was rather low when the food associated with the submersed aquatic macrophytes was most abundant; this is congruent with the niche overlap hypothesis that maximal tolerable niche overlap can be higher in less intensely competitive conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1971233212,"Gliomas are aggressive primary brain tumors with high infiltrative potential. The expression of Angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors has been associated with poor prognosis in human astrocytomas, the most common type of glioma. In this study, we investigated the role of Angiotensin II in glioma malignancy through transcriptional profiling and network analysis of cultured C6 rat glioma cells exposed to Ang II and to inhibitors of its membrane receptor subtypes. C6 cells were treated with Ang II and specific antagonists of AT1 and AT2 receptors. Total RNA was isolated after three and six hours of Ang II treatment and analyzed by oligonucleotide microarray technology. Gene expression data was evaluated through transcriptional network modeling to identify how differentially expressed (DE) genes are connected to each other. Moreover, other genes co-expressing with the DE genes were considered in these analyses in order to support the identification of enriched functions and pathways. A hub-based network analysis showed that the most connected nodes in Ang II-related networks exert functions associated with cell proliferation, migration and invasion, key aspects for glioma progression. The subsequent functional enrichment analysis of these central genes highlighted their participation in signaling pathways that are frequently deregulated in gliomas such as ErbB, MAPK and p53. Noteworthy, either AT1 or AT2 inhibitions were able to down-regulate different sets of hub genes involved in protumoral functions, suggesting that both Ang II receptors could be therapeutic targets for intervention in glioma. Taken together, our results point out multiple actions of Ang II in glioma pathogenesis and reveal the participation of both Ang II receptors in the regulation of genes relevant for glioma progression. This study is the first one to provide systems-level molecular data for better understanding the protumoral effects of Ang II in the proliferative and infiltrative behavior of gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W1994079951,"The cost of reproduction hypothesis suggests that current reproduction has inherent tradeoffs with future reproduction. These tradeoffs can be both in the form of energy allocated to current offspring as opposed to somatic maintenance and future reproduction (allocation costs), or as an increase in mortality as a result of morphological or physiological changes related to reproduction (viability costs). Individuals may be able to decrease viability costs by altering behavior. Female western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis experience a reduction in swimming ability as a consequence of pregnancy. We test for a viability cost of reproduction, and for behavioral compensation in pregnant female G. affinis by measuring survival of females in early and later stages of pregnancy when exposed to predation. Late-stage pregnant females experience a 70% greater probability of mortality compared to early-stage pregnant females. The presence of a refuge roughly doubled the odds of survival of both early and late-stage pregnant females. However, there was no interaction between refuge availability and stage of pregnancy. These data do not provide evidence for behavioral compensation by female G. affinis for elevated viability costs incurred during later stages of pregnancy. Behavioral compensation may be constrained by other aspects of the cost of reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W2020017450,"In our institute, we have recently found a child Japanese monkey who is characterized by deep wrinkles of the skin and cataract of bilateral eyes. Numbers of analyses were performed to identify symptoms representing different aspects of aging. In this monkey, the cell cycle of fibroblasts at early passage was significantly extended as compared to a normal control. Moreover, both the appearance of senescent cells and the deficiency in DNA repair were observed. Also, pathological examination showed that this monkey has poikiloderma with superficial telangiectasia, and biochemical assay confirmed that levels of HbA1c and urinary hyaluronan were higher than those of other (child, adult, and aged) monkey groups. Of particular interest was that our MRI analysis revealed expansion of the cerebral sulci and lateral ventricles probably due to shrinkage of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus. In addition, the conduction velocity of a peripheral sensory but not motor nerve was lower than in adult and child monkeys, and as low as in aged monkeys. However, we could not detect any individual-unique mutations of known genes responsible for major progeroid syndromes. The present results indicate that the monkey suffers from a kind of progeria that is not necessarily typical to human progeroid syndromes."
https://openalex.org/W2067855332,"Foodborne diseases caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) are a significant health problem. Pregnancy, state of immunological tolerance, is a predisposing condition for the development of infections with intracellular pathogens. Salmonella species can cause pregnancy complications such as chorioamnionitis, transplacental fetal infection, pre term labor, abortions, neonatal and maternal septicemia. However, the specific mechanisms by which Salmonella infections trigger these alterations are not clear. In the present work, using a self-limiting enterocolitis murine model, we show that the ingestion of a low dose of S. Enteritidis at late stages of pregnancy (day 15 of gestation) is sufficient to induce massive maternal infection. We found that Salmonella infection leads to 40% of pre term delivery, 33% of abortion and fetal growth restriction. Placental dysfunction during S. Enteritidis enterocolitis was confirmed through cellular infiltration and hypoxia markers (MPO activity and COX-1 and COX-2 expression, respectively). Apoptosis in placental tissue due to Salmonella infection was also evident at day 18 of gestation when investigated by morphometric procedure, DNA fragmentation and Fas/FasL expression. Also, the expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-17 and IL-10 was up regulated in response to Salmonella not only in placenta, but also in amniotic fluid and maternal serum. Altogether, our results demonstrate that S. Enteritidis enterocolitis during late stages of gestation causes detrimental effect on pregnancy outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2102594792,"The coincidental virulence evolution hypothesis suggests that outside-host selection, such as predation, parasitism and resource competition can indirectly affect the virulence of environmentally-growing bacterial pathogens. While there are some examples of coincidental environmental selection for virulence, it is also possible that the resource acquisition and enemy defence is selecting against it. To test these ideas we conducted an evolutionary experiment by exposing the opportunistic pathogen bacterium Serratia marcescens to the particle-feeding ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, the surface-feeding amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii, and the lytic bacteriophage Semad11, in all possible combinations in a simulated pond water environment. After 8 weeks the virulence of the 384 evolved clones were quantified with fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster oral infection model, and several other life-history traits were measured. We found that in comparison to ancestor bacteria, evolutionary treatments reduced the virulence in most of the treatments, but this reduction was not clearly related to any changes in other life-history traits. This suggests that virulence traits do not evolve in close relation with these life-history traits, or that different traits might link to virulence in different selective environments, for example via resource allocation trade-offs."
https://openalex.org/W2145181461,"Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy, safety, and role of splenic biopsy in the management of patients with non-mass-forming isolated splenomegaly and suspected malignant lymphoma. Methods Between 2001 and 2013, 137 biopsies were performed under computed tomography (CT) fluoroscopic guidance in 39 patients. All patients had splenomegaly based on the CT findings and a suspected diagnosis of malignant lymphoma based on their clinical symptoms. The spleen was the only accessible site to perform a biopsy, and no mass lesions could be identified in the spleen. Results The overall sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of image-guided biopsy for malignant lymphoma were 88%, 100% and 92%, respectively. Major complications occurred in 3 patients. In 1 patient, transcatheter arterial embolization was performed due to hemorrhage, and two patients needed blood transfusion because of hematoma development, without the need for further treatment. Conclusions Image-guided splenic core-needle biopsy is a safe and accurate technique with a high diagnostic accuracy in most patients who with non-mass-forming isolated splenomegaly and suspected underlying malignant lymphoma."
https://openalex.org/W2168235080,"Spatial distribution pattern of biological related species present unique opportunities and challenges to explain species coexistence. In this study, we explored the spatial distributions and associations among congeneric species at both the species and genus levels to explain their coexistence through examining the similarities and differences at these two levels. We first used DNA and cluster analysis to confirmed the relative relationship of eight species within a 20 ha subtropical forest in southern China. We compared Diameter at breast height (DBH) classes, aggregation intensities and spatial patterns, associations, and distributions of four closely related species pairs to reveal similarities and differences at the species and genus levels. These comparisons provided insight into the mechanisms of coexistence of these congeners. O-ring statistics were used to measure spatial patterns of species. Ω0-10, the mean conspecific density within 10 m of a tree, was used as a measure of the intensity of aggregation of a species, and g-function was used to analyze spatial associations. Our results suggested that spatial aggregations were common, but the differences between spatial patterns were reduced at the genus level. Aggregation intensity clearly reduced at the genus level. Negative association frequencies decreased at the genus level, such that independent association was commonplace among all four genera. Relationships between more closely related species appeared to be more competitive at both the species and genus levels. The importance of competition on interactions is most likely influenced by similarity in lifestyle, and the habitat diversity within the species' distribution areas. Relatives with different lifestyles likely produce different distribution patterns through different interaction process. In order to fully understand the mechanisms generating spatial distributions of coexisting siblings, further research is required to determine the spatial patterns and associations at other classification levels."
https://openalex.org/W1988652723,"The 5 S rRNA gene-specific transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA) interacts with the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase PIAS2b and with one of its targets, the transcriptional corepressor, XCtBP. PIAS2b is restricted to the cytoplasm of Xenopus oocytes but relocates to the nucleus immediately after fertilization. Following the midblastula transition, PIAS2b and XCtBP are present on oocyte-type, but not somatic-type, 5 S rRNA genes up through the neurula stage, as is a limiting amount of TFIIIA. Histone H3 methylation, coincident with the binding of XCtBP, also occurs exclusively on the oocyte-type genes. Immunohistochemical staining of embryos confirms the occupancy of a subset of the oocyte-type genes by TFIIIA that become positioned at the nuclear periphery shortly after the midblastula transition. Inhibition of SUMOylation activity relieves repression of oocyte-type 5 S rRNA genes and is correlated with a decrease in methylation of H3K9 and H3K27 and disruption of subnuclear localization. These results reveal a novel function for TFIIIA as a negative regulator that recruits histone modification activity through the CtBP repressor complex exclusively to the oocyte-type 5 S rRNA genes, leading to their terminal repression."
https://openalex.org/W1989555560,"Previous experiments revealed that DHH1, a RNA helicase involved in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation, complemented the phenotype of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant affected in the expression of genes coding for monocarboxylic-acids transporters, JEN1 and ADY2 (Paiva S, Althoff S, Casal M, Leao C. FEMS Microbiol Lett, 1999, 170:301-306). In wild type cells, JEN1 expression had been shown to be undetectable in the presence of glucose or formic acid, and induced in the presence of lactate. In this work, we show that JEN1 mRNA accumulates in a dhh1 mutant, when formic acid was used as sole carbon source. Dhh1 interacts with the decapping activator Dcp1 and with the deadenylase complex. This led to the hypothesis that JEN1 expression is post-transcriptionally regulated by Dhh1 in formic acid. Analyses of JEN1 mRNAs decay in wild-type and dhh1 mutant strains confirmed this hypothesis. In these conditions, the stabilized JEN1 mRNA was associated to polysomes but no Jen1 protein could be detected, either by measurable lactate carrier activity, Jen1-GFP fluorescence detection or western blots. These results revealed the complexity of the expression regulation of JEN1 in S. cerevisiae and evidenced the importance of DHH1 in this process. Additionally, microarray analyses of dhh1 mutant indicated that Dhh1 plays a large role in metabolic adaptation, suggesting that carbon source changes triggers a complex interplay between transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects."
https://openalex.org/W2026027623,"Determining the effects of lifelong intake patterns on performance is challenging for many species, primarily because of methodological constraints. Here, we used a parthenogenetic insect (Carausius morosus) to determine the effects of limited and unlimited food availability across multiple life-history stages. Using a parthenogen allowed us to quantify intake by juvenile and adult females and to evaluate the morphological, physiological, and life-history responses to intake, all without the confounding influences of pair-housing, mating, and male behavior. In our study, growth rate prior to reproductive maturity was positively correlated with both adult and reproductive lifespans but negatively correlated with total lifespan. Food limitation had opposing effects on lifespan depending on when it was imposed, as it protracted development in juveniles but hastened death in adults. Food limitation also constrained reproduction regardless of when food was limited, although decreased fecundity was especially pronounced in individuals that were food-limited as late juveniles and adults. Additional carry-over effects of juvenile food limitation included smaller adult size and decreased body condition at the adult molt, but these effects were largely mitigated in insects that were switched to ad libitum feeding as late juveniles. Our data provide little support for the existence of a trade-off between longevity and fecundity, perhaps because these functions were fueled by different nutrient pools. However, insects that experienced a switch to the limited diet at reproductive maturity seem to have fueled egg production by drawing down body stores, thus providing some evidence for a life-history trade-off. Our results provide important insights into the effects of food limitation and indicate that performance is modulated by intake both within and across life-history stages."
https://openalex.org/W1971630660,"Background The question of whether “recurrent” laryngeal carcinoma is truly a new tumour with a clonal origin that differs from that of the primary tumour has remained unanswered. The objective of this study was to determine whether recurrent tumours have the same genetic basis as primary tumours, as the answer to this question is important for the development of treatment strategies. Materials and Methods Matched samples consisting of primary tumour, recurrent tumour and normal tissue were obtained from the same patient. A total of 37 patients with laryngeal cancer were examined for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on the 3p, 5p, 7q, 8p, 9p, 13p, 17p and 18q chromosomal arms using PCR to amplify microsatellite markers. All patients were routinely followed up and 5-year survival rates were calculated using directly calculating method and Kaplan-Meier's method. Results A total of 28 out of 37 (75.6%) patients showed LOH at a minimum of one locus, and 19 out of 37 (51.3%) patients showed LOH at two loci. Primary and recurrent tumours in each patient showed identical allelic loss patterns and incidence rates. Patients without LOH had a longer average time to recurrence than patients with LOH (P<0.05). Additionally, patients with LOH had a longer average smoking duration prior to surgery than patients without LOH (P<0.05). The 5-year survival rates were 32.14%in patients with LOH versus 44.4% in patients without LOH. Conclusions The data indicate that primary and recurrent tumours have the same clonal origin. This result implies that we failed to radically resect the primary tumours and/or micrometastases in these patients. Consequently, some form of adjunctive therapy may be necessary. Additionally, the data indicate that the recurrence of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma is closely related to chromosomal aberrations (specifically LOH)."
