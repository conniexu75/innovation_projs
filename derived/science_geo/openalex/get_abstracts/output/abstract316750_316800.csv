https://openalex.org/W2033057757,"Multiplicities in the resonances of chemically equivalent carbons, which appear in the solid-state carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of native celluloses, have been examined at high resolution. The patterns of variation are consistent with the existence of two distinct crystalline forms. One form is dominant in bacterial and algal celluloses, whereas the other is dominant in celluloses from higher plants."

They provide probable examples of mantles of differentiated parent asteroids exposed by fragmentation and are good candidates for the parent bodies of the unusual olivine meteorite Brachina or the olivine-iron alloy meteorites called pallasites."
https://openalex.org/W2067503220,"Stars with individual luminosities more than a million times that of the sun are now being studied in a variety of contexts. Observational and theoretical ideas about the most luminous stars have changed greatly in the past few years. They can be observed spectroscopically even in nearby galaxies. They are not very stable; some have had violent outbursts in which large amounts of mass were lost. Because of their instabilities, these stars do not evolve to become red superglants as less luminous stars do. Theoretical scenarios for the evolution of these most massive stars depend on the effects of turbulence and mixing combined with high radition densities."

https://openalex.org/W2029473812,"Abundant Permian plant megafossils were discovered in the Del Norte Mountains of Brewster County, Trans-Pecos Texas. The flora is dominated by a new and distinctive type of gigantopteroid leaves. Marine invertebrates are closely associated, and this admixture of continental and marine fossils indicates a deltaic depositional setting, probably on the southern margin of the Permian Basin. Conodonts indicate correlation with the uppermost Leonardian Road Canyon Formation in the Glass Mountains. These are the youngest Paleozoic plant megafossils known in North America; they add an important paleontological element to the classic Permian area of this Continent."

https://openalex.org/W2063519345,"In 1980, Congress passed legislation which stipulated that states must either join a regional compact for the disposal of nuclear waste, or develop their own individual waste disposal sites by 1985. Currently, only two compacts have been set up, the southeast and the northwest. While the other states will undoubtedly set up compacts or develop individual disposal sites, much political maneuvering is expected before the issue is resolved."
