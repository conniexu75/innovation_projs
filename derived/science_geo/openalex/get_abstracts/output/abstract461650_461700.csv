https://openalex.org/W2080457126,"The recent discovery that normal and neoplastic epithelial cells re-enter the stem cell state raised the intriguing possibility that the aggressiveness of carcinomas derives not from their existing content of cancer stem cells (CSCs) but from their proclivity to generate new CSCs from non-CSC populations. Here, we demonstrate that non-CSCs of human basal breast cancers are plastic cell populations that readily switch from a non-CSC to CSC state. The observed cell plasticity is dependent on ZEB1, a key regulator of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We find that plastic non-CSCs maintain the ZEB1 promoter in a bivalent chromatin configuration, enabling them to respond readily to microenvironmental signals, such as TGFβ. In response, the ZEB1 promoter converts from a bivalent to active chromatin configuration, ZEB1 transcription increases, and non-CSCs subsequently enter the CSC state. Our findings support a dynamic model in which interconversions between low and high tumorigenic states occur frequently, thereby increasing tumorigenic and malignant potential."

We speculate that distinct strains of pathological α-synuclein likely exist in neurodegenerative disease brains and may underlie the tremendous heterogeneity of synucleinopathies. A common feature of many neurodegenerative diseases is the accumulation of normally soluble proteins into filamentous insoluble aggregates. Examples include tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal degeneration (reviewed by Lee et al., 2001Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Neurodegenerative tauopathies.Annu. Rev.

Whereas tau is a microtubule-binding protein that stabilizes and promotes microtubule assembly in axons (Witman et al., 1976Witman G.B. Cleveland D.W. Weingarten M.D. Kirschner M.W. Tubulin requires tau for growth onto microtubule initiating sites.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1976; 73: 4070-4074Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), α-syn is a phospholipid-binding protein concentrated in presynaptic terminals where it promotes SNARE complex formation and modulates synaptic functions (Burré et al., 2010Burré J. Sharma M. Tsetsenis T. Buchman V. Etherton M.R. Südhof T.C.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3214-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms whereby tau and α-syn aggregates induce neurodegeneration are not understood, they are thought to contribute to neuronal dysfunction and death through loss of normal functions and/or toxic gains of functions (reviewed by Ballatore et al., 2007Ballatore C.

Neurosci. 2001; 2: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Both tau and α-syn are natively unfolded soluble proteins without well-defined secondary or tertiary structures (Weinreb et al., 1996Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. NACP, a protein implicated in Alzheimer’s disease and learning, is natively unfolded.Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar), but how they undergo conformational changes to become insoluble and form aggregates is unclear. Recently, increasing evidence supports robust aggregation of tau and α-syn induced by exogenously supplied preformed fibrils (pffs) in cultured cells, as well as in living animals, suggesting that small amounts of misfolded protein can act as seeds to initiate templated recruitment of their soluble counterparts into fibrils (Frost et al., 2009Frost B.

Moreover, cell-to-cell transmission of these amyloid protein aggregates may underlie the stereotypical spatiotemporal progression of both AD and PD pathologies (reviewed by Jucker and Walker, 2011Jucker M. Walker L.C. Pathogenic protein seeding in Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.Ann. Neurol. 2011; 70: 532-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Another recurrent theme of neurodegenerative diseases is the frequent co-occurrence of different disease protein aggregates in the same patient. For example, >50% of AD cases show LBs, whereas co-morbid AD pathologies, including Aβ plaques and NFTs, are commonly found in PD and DLB brains (reviewed by Galpern and Lang, 2006Galpern W.R. Lang A.E. Interface between tauopathies and synucleinopathies: a tale of two proteins.Ann. Neurol. 2006; 59: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). One potential explanation is global dysregulation of protein homeostasis in disease brains, whereby misfolding of one major protein overwhelms the proteostatic machinery and compromises folding of other aggregation-prone proteins (reviewed by Kikis et al., 2010Kikis E.A. Gidalevitz T. Morimoto R.I. Protein homeostasis in models of aging and age-related conformational disease.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2010; 694: 138-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Alternatively, filamentous aggregates composed of one protein may directly cross-seed other amyloidogenic proteins owing to potentially shared structural features of amyloid fibrils (Kayed et al., 2007Kayed R. Head E. Sarsoza F. Saing T. Cotman C.W. Necula M. Margol L. Wu J. Breydo L.

Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 1485-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Indeed, we showed earlier that recombinant α-syn and tau proteins synergistically promote the fibrillization of each other in vitro (Giasson et al., 2003Giasson B.I. Forman M.S. Higuchi M. Golbe L.I. Graves C.L. Kotzbauer P.T. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Initiation and synergistic fibrillization of tau and alpha-synuclein.Science. 2003; 300: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), whereas more recently, α-syn pffs were shown to induce tau aggregation in cultured non-neuronal cells (Waxman and Giasson, 2011Waxman E.A. Giasson B.I. Induction of intracellular tau aggregation is promoted by α-synuclein seeds and provides novel insights into the hyperphosphorylation of tau.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 7604-7618Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To confirm this cross-seeding phenomenon in physiologically more relevant systems, we utilized recently developed synucleinopathy models in primary neurons and transgenic (Tg) mice, in which exogenously added α-syn pffs promote aggregation of endogenous α-syn (Luk et al., 2012bLuk K.C. Kehm V.M. Zhang B. O’Brien P. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Intracerebral inoculation of pathological α-synuclein initiates a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative α-synucleinopathy in mice.J. Exp.

Exogenous α-synuclein fibrils induce Lewy body pathology leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuron death.Neuron. 2011; 72: 57-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). By using these models, we discovered two distinct “strains” of synthetic α-syn pffs with differential ability to cross-seed tau aggregation in cultured neurons and in vivo. In this work, we define strains as conformational variants of α-syn fibrils with differing cross-seeding properties in these cellular and organismal contexts. To investigate whether α-syn pffs cross-seed tau in primary neurons, we incubated hippocampal neurons from mouse embryos overexpressing human mutant P301S tau (PS19) with α-syn pffs assembled de novo from C-terminal-truncated 1–120 monomers with a Myc tag (1–120-Myc). At 18 days post-transduction, highly abundant LB and Lewy-neurite (LN) like α-syn inclusions that are resistant to Triton X-100 extraction were observed throughout the cultured neurons (Figure 1A, top panel). However, Triton-insoluble hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates were infrequent and rarely colocalized with α-syn pathology. The lack of direct evidence for physical interactions between α-syn and tau aggregates suggests that the formation of the latter is likely an indirect consequence of α-syn accumulation rather than a direct result of cross-seeding by α-syn. In neurons derived from non-Tg mice, no appreciable tau aggregates were induced (Figure 1A, bottom panel). Remarkably, a very different pattern of Triton-insoluble α-syn and tau inclusions was observed in neurons treated with a preparation of 1–120-Myc pffs generated through repetitive seeded fibrillization in vitro, whereby 5% or 10% of pffs from each passage were included as seeds in the fibrillization reaction of the subsequent passage (Figure 1B). Although α-syn pathology was somewhat less abundant at 18 days post-transduction compared to transduction with de novo 1–120-Myc pffs, widespread fibrillar tau aggregates that extensively colocalized with neuritic α-syn inclusions were observed in both PS19 and non-Tg neurons (Figure 1C). Surprisingly, the extent of endogenous mouse tau pathology induced in non-Tg neurons by these α-syn pffs dramatically exceeded that induced by synthetic tau pffs (Guo and Lee, 2013Guo J.L. Lee V.M. Neurofibrillary tangle-like tau pathology induced by synthetic tau fibrils in primary neurons over-expressing mutant tau.FEBS Lett. 2013; 587: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To distinguish these two distinct types of α-syn pffs that are reminiscent of prion “strains,” we designate pffs that have limited cross-seeding ability of tau, which were used in all our previous α-syn transmission studies, as strain A, and the newly discovered pffs with efficient cross-seeding of tau as strain B (Luk et al., 2009Luk K.C.

Exogenous α-synuclein fibrils induce Lewy body pathology leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuron death.Neuron. 2011; 72: 57-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) (Table S2 available online). Generation of strain B through repeated self-seeding in vitro was reproduced using several different batches of 1–120-Myc monomer, as confirmed by phenotypic transition from a relative paucity of insoluble tau in early passages to appearance of robust tau pathology in later passages (Figure S1A). Although strain B α-syn pffs efficiently induce endogenous tau aggregation in non-Tg neurons, this phenomenon failed to occur in α-syn knockout neurons (Figure 1D), suggesting that endogenous mouse α-syn mediates fibrillization of mouse tau in non-Tg neurons. It is conceivable that the internalized α-syn pffs themselves provide an insufficient quantity of nucleating structures to directly trigger tau fibrillization, presumably due to a less efficient cross-seeding of tau than homotypic seeding of α-syn, whereas endogenous α-syn aggregates templated by internalized pffs create additional seeding structures sufficient to initiate the conversion of soluble tau into aggregates. To test whether wild-type (WT) full-length (FL) α-syn also forms strain A and B α-syn fibrils, non-Tg neurons were incubated for 18 days with FL α-syn pffs generated de novo (passage 1 or P1) or through repetitive self-seeding in vitro (P2 onward) (Figure 1B). P1 pffs always behaved as strain A, resulting in profuse α-syn inclusions with minimal tau aggregation (Figure 1E). FL α-syn pffs of subsequent passages led to diminishing α-syn pathology with small amounts of neuritic tau pathology first emerging in neurons transduced with P4 or P5 pffs, followed by full conversion to strain B that induced abundant tau pathology by P6-7 (Figure 1E). Such strain A to strain B conversion through repeated self-seeding in vitro was accomplished with four different batches of FL α-syn monomer, although this process did not always give rise to prototypical strain B pffs as defined above. An intermediate phenotype with relatively abundant tau pathology accompanied by far more abundant α-syn pathology was sometimes observed (Figure S1B); this is likely due to incomplete conversion of strain A to strain B resulting in a mixture of the two strains. Notably, continual self-seeding in vitro after full or partial conversion to strain B led to “strain drift” within a few passages, resulting in what we refer to as “post-B strains,” which induce a variable amount of tau pathology and morphologically diverse α-syn inclusions (Figure S1C; Table S2). Immunoelectron microscopy (immuno-EM) in a previous study showed abundant phospho-α-syn-positive filaments throughout perikarya and processes of neurons transduced with α-syn pffs now designated as strain A (Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2011Volpicelli-Daley L.A. Luk K.C. Patel T.P. Tanik S.A. Riddle D.M. Stieber A. Meaney D.F. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Exogenous α-synuclein fibrils induce Lewy body pathology leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuron death.Neuron. 2011; 72: 57-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Similarly, immuno-EM also detected cytoplasmic α-syn filaments in strain B pff-transduced neurons but mostly confined to neurites (Figures 2A and 2B ). Meanwhile, filamentous aggregates immunoreactive for phospho-tau were observed in neurons treated with strain B pffs, confirming fibrillization of tau induced by heterotypic seeds (Figures 2C and 2D). Moreover, double-labeling immuno-EM of strain B-transduced neurons showed close physical associations of tau with α-syn in filamentous structures in neuronal processes (Figures 2E and 2F), strongly supporting direct physical templating as the primary mechanism for strain B α-syn pff-induced tau aggregation. The lack of tau immunoreactivity around occasional perikaryal α-syn-positive filaments indicates specificity of our double-labeling technique (Figure 2G). Immunocytochemistry on neurons incubated for different durations with α-syn pffs generated from either FL or 1–120-Myc α-syn more clearly revealed differences between the two strains (Figures 3 and S2). Non-Tg neurons transduced with strain A pffs were replete with α-syn pathology in the absence of any tau pathology at 10 days post-transduction, but those transduced with strain B pffs showed only sparse α-syn aggregates, whereas small amounts of neuritic tau accumulations already emerged (Figures 3A and S2A). By 14 days and 18 days post-transduction, the burden of α-syn aggregates increased in strain B-transduced neurons, accompanied by a dramatic increase in tau aggregates, nearly all of which colocalized with α-syn pathology (Figures 3A–3D and S2A). In contrast, strain A-induced α-syn pathology appeared to plateau at 14 days post-transduction, but no neuritic tau pathology ever occurred. Immunoblotting of lysates from neurons that were sequentially extracted with 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer followed by 2% SDS lysis buffer confirmed the distinct seeding properties of the two strains of α-syn pffs. Triton-insoluble tau was only detected in strain B pff-transduced neurons, being most prominent after 18 days of incubation, even though Triton-insoluble α-syn was much more abundant in neurons treated with strain A pffs (Figures 3E, 3F, and S2B).Figure S2Differential Seeding Capacity and Toxicity of the Two Strains of α-Syn pffs, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Immunostaining for insoluble phospho-α-syn (81A) and phospho-tau (AT8) at different time points (10 days, 14 days, 18 days) after the addition of strain A or strain B 1–120-Myc α-syn pffs into non-Tg neurons. 1% Triton X-100 was added to 4% PFA during fixing to remove soluble proteins.(B) PS19 neurons treated with PBS, or transduced with strain A or strain B 1–120-Myc pffs were sequentially extracted with 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (T) followed by 2% SDS lysis buffer (S) at different time points.

Consistent with our previous study (Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2011Volpicelli-Daley L.A. Luk K.C. Patel T.P. Tanik S.A. Riddle D.M. Stieber A. Meaney D.F. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Exogenous α-synuclein fibrils induce Lewy body pathology leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuron death.Neuron. 2011; 72: 57-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), strain A pffs were highly toxic to neurons as evidenced by significantly increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and reduced metabolic activity after 14 days of incubation (Figures 3G, S2C, and S2D). By contrast, strain B pffs had no negative impact on cell survival even after 18 days of incubation. Immunostaining of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and neurofilament light chain (NFL) in 18 days post-transduction neurons showed bundled but intact neuronal processes in strain B-treated neurons, whereas a dramatic reduction in the density of both MAP2 and NFL and frequent beading of dendritic MAP2 were observed in strain A-treated neurons (Figure S2E). The prominent reduction of soluble tau in 18-day strain A-transduced neuron lysates was most likely a result of extensive cell death as well (Figures 3E, 3F, and S2B). To determine whether the distinct seeding properties of the two α-syn pff strains reflect structural differences, a series of biophysical and biochemical analyses were performed. First, negative-staining transmission EM (TEM) showed no convincing difference in the morphology of filaments (Figure S3A). Second, ThT fluorescence signals of similar amounts of strain A and B fibrils demonstrated wide variability without clear separation (Figure S3B). Third, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and circular dichroism (CD) only showed minor differences between these two strains (Figures S3C and S3D), suggesting that structural differences between them are subtle. To test whether α-syn pff strains can be distinguished biochemically using proteinase K (PK) digestion as demonstrated for human prion strains (Aguzzi et al., 2007Aguzzi A. Heikenwalder M. Polymenidou M. Insights into prion strains and neurotoxicity.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 552-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, Parchi et al., 1996Parchi P. Castellani R. Capellari S. Ghetti B. Young K. Chen S.G. Farlow M. Dickson D.W. Sima A.A. Trojanowski J.Q. et al.Molecular basis of phenotypic variability in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.Ann. Neurol. 1996; 39: 767-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), different passages of FL α-syn pffs generated through self-seeding in vitro were incubated with PK at 37°C. The digestion products predominantly consist of five bands between 10 and 15 kDa, with the fifth band being least abundant for P1 pffs (Figure 4A). Notably, the fifth band consistently became highly prominent around P5–P7, correlating with the transition of strain A to strain B. The relative intensity of the fifth band compared to the first band typically shows a decline from P1 to P2, followed by an upward trend at later passages (Figure 4B), suggesting stereotypical conformational changes generated by repetitive seeded fibrillization. To directly examine whether the two strains of pffs show distinct PK digestion patterns, neuronal phenotype-confirmed strain A and B pffs were incubated with different concentrations of PK (Figure 4C). No significant difference in overall PK resistance was observed, such that no loss in the total amount of α-syn proteins was seen after each strain was treated with PK (Figure S3E). The first band of the PK digestion products presumably represents residual uncleaved FL α-syn pffs as it comigrates with FL α-syn on denaturing gels. Detailed analysis of all five bands revealed a significantly higher ratio of cleaved species (sum of second to fifth bands) to uncleaved α-syn (first band) for strain B pffs at all PK concentrations (Figure 4D). This difference was predominantly driven by increased relative abundance of the third and fifth bands in the strain B digestion products, with the fifth band most dramatically differentiating the two strains at 2.5 μg/ml PK (Figures 4E, 4F, S3F, and S3G). N-terminal sequencing indicated that both the second and fourth bands primarily contain α-syn peptides starting around residues 19–21, whereas the third and fifth bands both start at residue 31 (Figure 4A). Taking into account epitope mapping with a panel of antibodies specific to domains spanning the entire α-syn molecule (Figure 4G), we deduced the identities of the major PK digestion products (Figure 4H). Both the third and fifth bands, which are more prominent in PK-digested strain B pffs, consist of peptides N-terminally cleaved after residue 30, whereas the fifth band has an additional C-terminal cleavage site around residue 125 (Figure 4H). Increased N- and C-terminal truncation of strain B pffs by PK suggests that the two termini may be more exposed for PK access in strain B than in strain A pffs. Moreover, the two strains of pffs made from 1–120-Myc, which lacks the C-terminal cleavage site for PK, were clearly distinguished by an elevated amount of PK digestion product starting at residue 31 for strain B (Figure S3H), further supporting increased PK cleavage at the N terminus as a biochemical signature for strain B pffs. To further confirm that the two strains of α-syn pffs are conformational variants, we generated a monoclonal antibody (mAb), 9029-03, which displays ∼3-fold selectivity for strain B pffs over strain A pffs as quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Figure 4I). This strain B-selective antibody demonstrated an inverted U-shape curve of immunoreactivity for different passages of α-syn pffs within each self-seeded propagation series, consistent with the emergence of strain B conformers after repetitive self-seeding and later conversion to post-B strains (Figure 4J). Because possible conformational changes of α-syn pffs at the N and C termini correlate with phenotypic conversion from strain A to B, we tested self-seeded pffs assembled from N- or C-terminal-truncated α-syn molecules to determine whether the two termini play causal roles in strain evolution (Figure 5A; Table S3). Interestingly, pffs made from N-terminal-truncated α-syn 58–140 and 32–140 almost always remained incapable of cross-seeding tau up to P10 of self-seeding despite efficient induction of α-syn pathology (Figure 5B). The N terminus of α-syn thus appears necessary for generating in the exogenous α-syn pffs a cross-seeding-competent conformation that can be conferred through templating onto endogenous α-syn, which is required for recruiting tau (Figures 1D and 5A). Besides the lack of tau cross-seeding, both 58–140 and 32–140 pffs rem"

MN have reduced functioning compared to primary nuclei in the same cell, although the two compartments appear to be structurally comparable. Here we show that over 60% of MN undergo an irreversible loss of compartmentalization during interphase due to NE collapse. This disruption of the MN, which is induced by defects in nuclear lamina assembly, drastically reduces nuclear functions and can trigger massive DNA damage. MN disruption is associated with chromatin compaction and invasion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) tubules into the chromatin. We identified disrupted MN in both major subtypes of human non-small-cell lung cancer, suggesting that disrupted MN could be a useful objective biomarker for genomic instability in solid tumors. Our study shows that NE collapse is a key event underlying MN dysfunction and establishes a link between aberrant NE organization and aneuploidy."

Central synapses exhibit a large diversity in properties, such as presynaptic release probability, postsynaptic receptor composition, and long-term plasticity. In a given neuron, these properties depend on both the pre- and the postsynaptic neuron (Reyes et al., 1998Reyes A. Lujan R. Rozov A. Burnashev N. Somogyi P. Sakmann B.

Trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules not only organize and synchronize assembly of synapses, but also likely determine their properties and diversity. Neurexins are trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules that are candidate molecules for mediating trans-synaptic specification of synaptic properties (Craig and Kang, 2007Craig A.M. Kang Y.

The larger α-neurexins are composed of six LNS domains with three interspersed EGF-like domains followed by a transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic tail. The smaller β-neurexins lack the N-terminal five LNS and three EGF-like domains of α-neurexins but instead contain a unique short N-terminal sequence. β-neurexins splice into the 6th LNS domain of α-neurexins and are identical with α-neurexins in all C-terminal sequences. The six principal neurexins (Nrx1α–3α and Nrx1β–3β) are expressed in differential but overlapping patterns in all neurons, such that most neurons synthesize multiple α- and β-neurexins in different combinations (Ullrich et al., 1995Ullrich B.

In mice, triple knockout (KO) of Nrx1α, Nrx2α, and Nrx3α is lethal despite continued expression of Nrx1β, Nrx2β, and Nrx3β (Missler et al., 2003Missler M. Zhang W. Rohlmann A. Kattenstroth G.

Neurexins are assumed to be presynaptic because they act as α-latrotoxin receptors (Ushkaryov et al., 1992Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G. Geppert M. Südhof T.C.

However, despite the known effect of SS4 alternative splicing on neurexin-ligand interactions and its mechanistic understanding, it is unclear whether SS4 alternative splicing is physiologically important. No approaches are available to directly test the significance of alternative splicing for molecules such as neurexins, which are alternatively processed at multiple positions and whose overexpression in itself may produce biological effects. Apart from the fact that no KOs targeting both α- and β-neurexins are available, such studies are made difficult because rescue experiments cannot test all splice combinations at physiological expression levels. Here, we apply a genetic knockin approach to test the biological significance of neurexin alternative splicing at SS4. Using homologous recombination, we changed the splice-acceptor sequence of the alternatively spliced SS4 exon, thereby converting it into a constitutively included exon that is no longer subject to alternative splicing. At the same time, we rendered the SS4 exon conditional by floxing it. Thus, we here describe a genetic approach that allows conditional control of alternative splicing of neurexins and may be generally applicable to vertebrate genes. Using this approach, we found that constitutive expression of Nrx3-SS4+ produced a selective alteration in postsynaptic AMPA-receptor (AMPAR), but not NMDA-receptor (NMDAR) trafficking, such that postsynaptic AMPAR levels were lowered, synaptic strength was decreased, and NMDAR-dependent LTP was attenuated. These phenotypes were fully reversed by cre-dependent excision of the SS4 exon. Moreover, we found that the effect of SS4 alternative splicing was not mediated by a cell-autonomous postsynaptic effect but, rather, by a trans-synaptic non-cell-autonomous action of presynaptic Nrx3 on postsynaptic neurons and that constitutive expression of Nrx3-SS4+ causes a loss of the postsynaptic neurexin ligand LRRTM2. These results provide a direct test of the physiological function of neurexin alternative splicing in vivo that was not possible with a nongenetic approach and demonstrate an unanticipated mechanism by which alternative splicing of a neurexin in a presynaptic neuron trans-synaptically controls postsynaptic properties. Although qualitative studies showed that alternative splicing of neurexins at SS4 is highly regulated (Ullrich et al., 1995Ullrich B. Ushkaryov Y.A. Südhof T.C. Cartography of neurexins: more than 1000 isoforms generated by alternative splicing and expressed in distinct subsets of neurons.Neuron. 1995; 14: 497-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), no quantitative assessment of neurexin alternative splicing is available. Thus, we developed quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) assays for the alternatively spliced versions of SS4 for Nrx1, Nrx2, and Nrx3 (Figure S1 available online) and measured their messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in various brain regions from adult mice (Figure 1A).Figure 1Genetic Switching of Alternative Splicing of Nrx3 at SS4 into Constitutive “On” or “Off” States Alters AMPAR-Mediated Synaptic TransmissionShow full caption(A) Absolute expression (number of transcripts/pg total RNA) of Nrx1α/β, Nrx2α/β, and Nrx3α/β mRNAs in the indicated brain regions (top) and relative levels of SS4+ and SS4– mRNAs in the same brain regions, as determined by quantitative RT-PCR (bottom; n = 4 mice; PVN, paraventricular nucleus).(B) Knockin strategy to generate conditional Nrx3-SS4 mutant mice.

The resulting mutant Nrx3 gene constitutively expresses Nrx3-SS4+ mRNA (Nrx3SS4+). Cre-recombinase deletes the exon, causing constitutive expression of Nrx3-SS4– mRNA (Nrx3SS4–). Single letters indicate locations of restriction enzyme sites (C, ClaI; E, EcoRI; P, PstI). (C) Quantification of Nrx3-SS4+, Nrx3-SS4–, and total Nrx3 mRNA levels in hippocampal neurons cultured from WT or Nrx3SS4+ mice; Nrx3SS4+ neurons were infected with lentiviruses expressing inactive cre-recombinase (retaining the Nrx3SS4+ genotype) or active cre-recombinase (converting Nrx3SS4+ into Nrx3SS4– neurons). mRNA levels were normalized to those observed in WT neurons that express predominantly Nrx3-SS4– mRNA (see A). (D and E) Representative traces (left) and summary graphs of the amplitude and frequency (right) of mEPSCs (D) and mIPSCs (E), monitored in cultured hippocampal WT, Nrx3SS4+, and Nrx3SS4– neurons obtained as described for (C). (F–H) Representative traces (left) and summary graphs (right) of evoked AMPAR- (F) and NMDAR-mediated EPSCs (G) and of evoked IPSCs (H) in cultured hippocampal WT, Nrx3SS4+, and Nrx3SS4– neurons. Data in (C)–(H) are means ± SEM; numbers in bars give number of independent culture experiments (C) or number of total cells/independent experiments analyzed (D–H). For (D)–(H), statistical significance was calculated by single-factor ANOVA (∗∗p < 0.01). See also Figure S1. We found that the three neurexin genes were expressed at comparable levels in different brain regions and exhibited a coordinate but differential pattern of SS4 alternative splicing (Figure 1A). Some brain regions (e.g., striatum and cerebellum) expressed primarily (∼90%) SS4+ forms of all three neurexins. Other brain regions (e.g., cortex and hippocampus) expressed similar amounts of SS4+ and SS4– forms of Nrx1 and Nrx2 but primarily the SS4– form of Nrx3 (∼90%; Figure 1A). Thus, alternative splicing of neurexins at SS4 is regionally regulated, with the largest differential in expression observed for Nrx3, prompting us to focus on this isoform. To test the role of SS4 alternative splicing of Nrx3, we sought to develop a new genetic approach. We noted that the alternatively spliced SS4 exon in the mouse Nrxn3 gene (exon 20; Tabuchi and Südhof, 2002Tabuchi K. Südhof T.C. Structure and evolution of neurexin genes: insight into the mechanism of alternative splicing.Genomics. 2002; 79: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) contains an unusual purine-rich splice acceptor sequence (Figure 1B). Using homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells, we converted this imperfect splice acceptor sequence into a canonical consensus sequence (Figure 1B). We also introduced flanking loxP sites, such that exon 20 could be conditionally deleted. Using this strategy, we obtained mutant mice that were designed to constitutively insert the normally alternatively spliced SS4 sequence into all Nrx3 mRNAs, thus rendering all Nrx3 mRNAs SS4+ (referred to as Nrx3SS4+ genotype). At the same time, these mutant mice allow exclusion of the SS4 sequence after cre-recombinase-mediated deletion of exon 20, rendering all Nrx3 mRNAs SS4– (referred to as Nrx3SS4– genotype; Figure 1B). Homozygous Nrx3SS4+ and Nrx3SS4– mice (obtained from Nrx3SS4+ mice by germline deletion of exon 20) were viable and fertile. To test the effectiveness of our genetic strategy, we cultured hippocampal neurons from newborn wild-type (WT) and Nrx3SS4+ mice. We infected WT neurons at DIV4–5 with lentivirus-expressing GFP and the Nrx3SS4+ neurons with lentiviruses expressing inactive or active cre-recombinase, thereby producing controlled sets of cultured WT, Nrx3SS4+, and Nrx3SS4– neurons. We then measured Nrx3-SS4+ and Nrx3-SS4– mRNA levels in all three sets of neurons at DIV14–16. We found that Nrx3SS4+ neurons expressed only Nrx3-SS4+ mRNAs as predicted, whereas Nrx3SS4– neurons expressed only Nrx3-SS4- mRNAs (Figure 1C). Total Nrx3 mRNA levels were not significantly altered by either manipulation. Thus, we generated mutant mice in which neurons produce only Nrx3-SS4+ mRNAs but can be converted by cre-recombination to produce only Nrx3-SS4- mRNAs. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) exhibited a significantly lower amplitude in Nrx3SS4+ than in WT or Nrx3SS4− neurons but displayed no change in frequency (Figures 1D, 1E, and S1C). Neither the amplitude nor the frequency of spontaneous miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) was altered (Figures 1D, 1F, and S1E). The mEPSC or mIPSC rise or decay kinetics and intrinsic properties of the neurons were unchanged (Figures S1D and S1F). Neurexins are thought to be presynaptic, whereas changes in the mEPSC amplitude generally reflect postsynaptic changes. Thus, these findings were surprising and suggested that alternative splicing of presynaptic Nrx3 may alter excitatory synaptic strength by a postsynaptic mechanism. We next measured evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) mediated by AMPARs and NMDARs and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) mediated by GABAA receptors. We observed a large selective reduction (∼45%) in AMPAR-mediated EPSCs in Nrx3SS4+ neurons compared to WT or Nrx3SS4– neurons (Figure 1G). We detected no change in NMDAR-mediated EPSCs or in IPSCs (Figures 1H and 1I). Paired-pulse ratios (PPRs) of NMDAR"

These channels regulate the mitochondrial membrane potential, the matrix volume and respiration. The activation of these channels is cytoprotective. In our study, the single-channel activity of a large-conductance Ca2+-regulated potassium channel (mitoBKCa channel) was measured by patch-clamping mitoplasts isolated from the human astrocytoma (glioblastoma) U-87 MG cell line. A potassium-selective current was recorded with a mean conductance of 290 pS in symmetrical 150 mM KCl solution. The channel was activated by Ca2+ at micromolar concentrations and by the potassium channel opener NS1619. The channel was inhibited by paxilline and iberiotoxin, known inhibitors of BKCa channels. Western blot analysis, immuno-gold electron microscopy, high-resolution immunofluorescence assays and polymerase chain reaction demonstrated the presence of the BKCa channel β4 subunit in the inner mitochondrial membrane of the human astrocytoma cells. We showed that substrates of the respiratory chain, such as NADH, succinate, and glutamate/malate, decrease the activity of the channel at positive voltages. This effect was abolished by rotenone, antimycin and cyanide, inhibitors of the respiratory chain. The putative interaction of the β4 subunit of mitoBKCa with cytochrome c oxidase was demonstrated using blue native electrophoresis. Our findings indicate possible structural and functional coupling of the mitoBKCa channel with the mitochondrial respiratory chain in human astrocytoma U-87 MG cells."
https://openalex.org/W1971369233,"The validated EndoPredict assay is a novel tool to predict the risk of metastases of patients with estrogen receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer treated with endocrine therapy alone. It has been designed to integrate genomic and clinical information and includes clinico-pathological factors such as tumor size and nodal status. The test is feasible in a decentral setting in molecular pathology laboratories. In this project, we investigated the performance of this test in clinical practice, and performed a retrospective evaluation of its impact on treatment decisions in breast cancer. During one year, EndoPredict assays from 167 patients could be successfully performed. For retrospective evaluation of treatment decisions, a questionnaire was sent to the clinical partner. Regarding the molecular EP class, samples from 56 patients (33.5%) had a low-risk, whereas 111 patients (66.5%) showed a high-risk gene profile. After integration of the clinicopathological factors the combined clinical and molecular score (EPclin) resulted in a low-risk group of 77 patients (46.4%), while 89 (53.6%) had a high risk EPclin score. The EPclin-based estimated median 10-year-risk for metastases with endocrine therapy alone was 11% for the whole cohort. The median handling time averaged three days (range: 0 to 11 days), 59.3% of the tests could be performed in three or less than three days. Comparison of pre- and post-test therapy decisions showed a change of therapy in 37.7% of patients. 16 patients (12.3%) had a change to an additional chemotherapy while 25.4% of patients (n = 33) changed to an endocrine therapy alone. In 73 patients (56.2%) no change of therapy resulted. In 6.1% of patients (n = 8), the patients did not agree to the recommendation of the tumor board. Our results show that the EndoPredict assay could be routinely performed in decentral molecular pathology laboratories and the results markedly change treatment decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2082919939,"The estimation of phylogenetic relationships and divergence times among a group of organisms is a fundamental first step toward understanding its biological diversification. The time of the most recent or last common ancestor (LCA) of extant platyrrhines is one of the most controversial among scholars of primate evolution. Here we use two molecular based approaches to date the initial divergence of the platyrrhine clade, Bayesian estimations under a relaxed-clock model and substitution rate plus generation time and body size, employing the fossil record and genome datasets. We also explore the robustness of our estimations with respect to changes in topology, fossil constraints and substitution rate, and discuss the implications of our findings for understanding the platyrrhine radiation. Our results suggest that fossil constraints, topology and substitution rate have an important influence on our divergence time estimates. Bayesian estimates using conservative but realistic fossil constraints suggest that the LCA of extant platyrrhines existed at ca. 29 Ma, with the 95% confidence limit for the node ranging from 27-31 Ma. The LCA of extant platyrrhine monkeys based on substitution rate corrected by generation time and body size was established between 21-29 Ma. The estimates based on the two approaches used in this study recalibrate the ages of the major platyrrhine clades and corroborate the hypothesis that they constitute very old lineages. These results can help reconcile several controversial points concerning the affinities of key early Miocene fossils that have arisen among paleontologists and molecular systematists. However, they cannot resolve the controversy of whether these fossil species truly belong to the extant lineages or to a stem platyrrhine clade. That question can only be resolved by morphology. Finally, we show that the use of different approaches and well supported fossil information gives a more robust divergence time estimate of a clade."

The purpose of this study was to examine the correlation between the shear elastic modulus on the patellar tendon captured from a Supersonic Shear Imaging (SSI) and the tangent traction modulus computed from a Material testing system (MTS) on 8 fresh patellar pig tendons (Experiment I). Test–retest reliability of the shear elastic modulus captured from the SSI was established in Experiment II on 22 patellar tendons of 11 healthy human subjects using the SSI. Spearman Correlation coefficients for the shear elastic modulus and tangent traction modulus ranged from 0.82 to 1.00 (all p<0.05) on the 8 tendons. The intra and inter-operator reliabilities were 0.98 (95% CI: 0.93–0.99) and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.93–0.98) respectively. The results from this study demonstrate that the shear elastic modulus of the patellar tendon measured by the SSI is related to the tangent traction modulus quantified by the MTS. The SSI shows good intra and inter-operator repeatability. Therefore, the present study shows that SSI can be used to assess elastic properties of a tendon."
https://openalex.org/W2105376224,"The default-mode network (DMN), which comprises medial frontal, temporal and parietal regions, is part of the brain’s intrinsic organization. The serotonergic (5-HT) neurotransmitter system projects to DMN regions from midbrain efferents, and manipulation of this system could thus reveal insights into the neurobiological mechanisms of DMN functioning. Here, we investigate intrinsic functional connectivity of the DMN as a function of activity of the serotonergic system, through the administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram. We quantified DMN functional connectivity using an approach based on dual-regression. Specifically, we decomposed group data of a subset of the functional time series using spatial independent component analysis, and projected the group spatial modes to the same and an independent resting state time series of individual participants. We found no effects of escitalopram on global functional connectivity of the DMN at the map-level; that is, escitalopram did not alter the global functional architecture of the DMN. However, we found that escitalopram decreased DMN regional pairwise connectivity, which included anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, hippocampal complex and lateral parietal regions. Further, regional DMN connectivity covaried with alertness ratings across participants. Our findings show that escitalopram altered intrinsic regional DMN connectivity, which suggests that the serotonergic system plays an important role in DMN connectivity and its contribution to cognition. Pharmacological challenge designs may be a useful addition to resting-state functional MRI to investigate intrinsic brain functional organization."
https://openalex.org/W2061778611,"Human bocavirus is the second autonomous human parvovirus with assumed pathogenic potential. Other parvoviruses are known to persist and even integrate into the host genome, eventually contributing to the multi-step development of cancer. Human bocavirus also persists in an unknown percentage of clinically asymptomatic patients in addition to those with primary infection. The aim of the present study was to analyze the role of Human bocavirus in lung and colorectal cancers. Therefore, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, archived tumor samples were screened for Human bocavirus DNA by PCR, Southern blotting, and sequencing. Positive tissues were further subjected to fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis to specifically detect human bocavirus DNA in the infected cells. In total, 11 of the 60 (18.3%) lung and 9 of the 44 (20.5%) colorectal tumors tested positive for human bocavirus DNA by PCR and were confirmed by sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Thus, human bocavirus DNA is present in the nuclei of infected cells, in either single or multiple copies, and appears to form concatemers. The occurrence of these human bocavirus DNA structures supports the existence of the postulated σ- or rolling-hairpin replication mechanism. Moreover, the fluorescence in situ hybridization patterns inspired the hypothesis that human bocavirus DNA either persists as cccDNA or is integrated into the host genome. This finding suggests that this virus may indirectly contribute to the development of some colorectal and lung cancers, as do other DNA viruses, such as the human hepatitis B virus, or may play an active role in cancer by interacting with the host genome."
https://openalex.org/W2008725846,"The ecology of small rodent food selection is poorly understood, as mammalian herbivore food selection theory has mainly been developed by studying ungulates. Especially, the effect of food availability on food selection in natural habitats where a range of food items are available is unknown. We studied diets and selectivity of grey-sided voles (Myodes rufocanus) and tundra voles (Microtus oeconomus), key herbivores in European tundra ecosystems, using DNA metabarcoding, a novel method enabling taxonomically detailed diet studies. In order to cover the range of food availabilities present in the wild, we employed a large-scale study design for sampling data on food availability and vole diets. Both vole species had ingested a range of plant species and selected particularly forbs and grasses. Grey-sided voles also selected ericoid shrubs and tundra voles willows. Availability of a food item rarely affected its utilization directly, although seasonal changes of diets and selection suggest that these are positively correlated with availability. Moreover, diets and selectivity were affected by availability of alternative food items. These results show that the focal sub-arctic voles have diverse diets and flexible food preferences and rarely compensate low availability of a food item with increased searching effort. Diet diversity itself is likely to be an important trait and has previously been underrated owing to methodological constraints. We suggest that the roles of alternative food item availability and search time limitations for small rodent feeding ecology should be investigated.Annotated Checklist of the Panarctic Flora (PAF), Vascular plants.

Thirty-three (31%) were excluded because of previous heart disease. A pulmonary function test, a 6-minute walking test (6MWT), a Doppler echocardiography test, including diastolic dysfunction parameters, and an analysis of arterial blood gases, NT-proBNP and serum inflammatory markers (CRP, leucocytes), were performed in all patients.The prevalence of LVDD in severe stable COPD patients was 90% (80% type I, n=57, and 10% type II, n=7). A significant association between a lower E/A ratio (higher LVDD type I) and a lower exercise tolerance (6-minute walked distance (6MWD)) was found (r=0.29, p<0.05). The fully adjusted multivariable linear regression model demonstrated that a lower E/A ratio, a DLCO in the quartile 4(th) and a higher tobacco consumption were associated with a lower 6MWD (76, 57 and 0.7 metres, respectively, p<0.05). A significant correlation between E/A ratio and PaO2 was observed (r=0.26, p<0.05), but not with static lung hyperinflation, inflammation or right ventricle overload parameters.In stable severe COPD patients, the prevalence of LVDD is high and this condition might contribute in their lower exercise tolerance. Hypoxemia could have a concomitant role in their pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2061424947,"Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), the histone methyltransferase of the Polycomb Repressive complex 2 catalyzing histone H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3), is frequently up-regulated in human cancers. In this study, we identified the tumor suppressor Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) as a target of repression by EZH2-mediated H3K27me3. DLC1 is a GTPase-activating protein for Rho family proteins. Inactivation of DLC1 results in hyper-activated Rho/ROCK signaling and is implicated in actin cytoskeleton reorganization to promote cancer metastasis. By chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we demonstrated that H3K27me3 was significantly enriched at the DLC1 promoter region of a DLC1-nonexpressing HCC cell line, MHCC97L. Depletion of EZH2 in MHCC97L by shRNA reduced H3K27me3 level at DLC1 promoter and induced DLC1 gene re-expression. Conversely, transient overexpression of GFP-EZH2 in DLC1-expressing Huh7 cells reduced DLC1 mRNA level with a concomitant enrichment of EZH2 on DLC1 promoter. An inverse relation between EZH2 and DLC1 expression was observed in the liver, lung, breast, prostate, and ovarian cancer tissues. Treating cancer cells with the EZH2 small molecular inhibitor, 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), restored DLC1 expression in different cancer cell lines, indicating that EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 epigenetic regulation of DLC1 was a common mechanism in human cancers. Importantly, we found that DZNep treatment inhibited HCC cell migration through disrupting actin cytoskeleton network, suggesting the therapeutic potential of DZNep in targeting cancer metastasis. Taken together, our study has shed mechanistic insight into EZH2-H3K27me3 epigenetic repression of DLC1 and advocated the significant pro-metastatic role of EZH2 via repressing tumor and metastasis suppressors."
https://openalex.org/W2049719945,"Glioblastomas are the most frequent and aggressive intracranial neoplasms in humans, and despite advances and the introduction of the alkylating agent temozolomide in therapy have improved patient survival, resistance mechanisms limit benefits. Recent studies support that glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs), a cell subpopulation within the tumour, are involved in the aberrant expansion and therapy resistance properties of glioblastomas, through still unclear mechanisms. Emerging evidence suggests that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) a potent onco-promoter able to act as extracellular signal, favours malignant and chemoresistance properties in GSCs. Notwithstanding, the origin of S1P in the GSC environment remains unknown. We investigated S1P metabolism, release, and role in cell survival properties of GSCs isolated from either U87-MG cell line or a primary culture of human glioblastoma. We show that both GSC models, grown as neurospheres and expressing GSC markers, are resistant to temozolomide, despite not expressing the DNA repair protein MGMT, a major contributor to temozolomide-resistance. Pulse experiments with labelled sphingosine revealed that both GSC types are able to rapidly phosphorylate the long-chain base, and that the newly produced S1P is efficiently degraded. Of relevance, we found that S1P was present in GSC extracellular medium, its level being significantly higher than in U87-MG cells, and that the extracellular/intracellular ratio of S1P was about ten-fold higher in GSCs. The activity of sphingosine kinases was undetectable in GSC media, suggesting that mechanisms of S1P transport to the extracellular environment are constitutive in GSCs. In addition we found that an inhibitor of S1P biosynthesis made GSCs sensitive to temozolomide (TMZ), and that exogenous S1P reverted this effect, thus involving extracellular S1P as a GSC survival signal in TMZ resistance. Altogether our data implicate for the first time GSCs as a pivotal source of extracellular S1P, which might act as an autocrine/paracrine signal contributing to their malignant properties."
https://openalex.org/W2019291698,"Food webs near the interface of adjacent ecosystems are potentially subsidised by the flux of organic matter across system boundaries. Such subsidies, including carrion of marine provenance, are predicted to be instrumental on open-coast sandy shores where in situ productivity is low and boundaries are long and highly permeable to imports from the sea. We tested the effect of carrion supply on the structure of consumer dynamics in a beach-dune system using broad-scale, repeated additions of carcasses at the strandline of an exposed beach in eastern Australia. Carrion inputs increased the abundance of large invertebrate scavengers (ghost crabs, Ocypode spp.), a numerical response most strongly expressed by the largest size-class in the population, and likely due to aggregative behaviour in the short term. Consumption of carrion at the beach-dune interface was rapid and efficient, driven overwhelmingly by facultative avian scavengers. This guild of vertebrate scavengers comprises several species of birds of prey (sea eagles, kites), crows and gulls, which reacted strongly to concentrations of fish carrion, creating hotspots of intense scavenging activity along the shoreline. Detection of carrion effects at several trophic levels suggests that feeding links arising from carcasses shape the architecture and dynamics of food webs at the land-ocean interface."
https://openalex.org/W2092594273,"Background Importin-α1 belongs to a subfamily of nuclear transport adaptors and participates in diverse cellular functions. Best understood for its role in protein transport, importin-α1 also contributes to other biological processes. For instance, arsenite treatment causes importin-α1 to associate with cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) in mammalian cells. These stress-induced compartments contain translationally arrested mRNAs, small ribosomal subunits and numerous proteins involved in mRNA transport and metabolism. At present, it is not known whether members of all three importin-α subfamilies locate to SGs in response to stress. Results Here, we demonstrate that the oxidant diethyl maleate (DEM), arsenite and heat shock, promote the formation of cytoplasmic SGs that contain nuclear transport factors. Specifically, importin-α1, α4 and α5, which belong to distinct subfamilies, and importin-β1 were targeted by all of these stressors to cytoplasmic SGs, but not to P-bodies. Importin-α family members have been implicated in transcriptional regulation, which prompted us to analyze their ability to interact with poly(A)-RNA in growing cells. Our studies show that importin-α1, but not α4, α5, importin-β1 or CAS, associated with poly(A)-RNA under nonstress conditions. Notably, this interaction was significantly reduced when cells were treated with DEM. Additional studies suggest that importin-α1 is likely connected to poly(A)-RNA through an indirect interaction, as the adaptor did not bind homopolymer RNA specifically in vitro. Significance Our studies establish that members of three importin-α subfamilies are bona fide SG components under different stress conditions. Furthermore, importin-α1 is unique in its ability to interact with poly(A)-RNA in a stress-dependent fashion, and in vitro experiments indicate that this association is indirect. Collectively, our data emphasize that nuclear transport factors participate in a growing number of cellular activities that are modulated by stress."

Given the importance of clean water on multiple-use landscapes, additional research is required to document and examine potential water quality issues across common resource use activities. During the 2011 grazing-recreation season, we conducted a cross sectional survey of water quality conditions associated with cattle grazing and/or recreation on 12 public lands grazing allotments in California. Our specific study objectives were to 1) quantify fecal indicator bacteria (FIB; fecal coliform and E. coli), total nitrogen, nitrate, ammonium, total phosphorus, and soluble-reactive phosphorus concentrations in surface waters; 2) compare results to a) water quality regulatory benchmarks, b) recommended maximum nutrient concentrations, and c) estimates of nutrient background concentrations; and 3) examine relationships between water quality, environmental conditions, cattle grazing, and recreation. Nutrient concentrations observed throughout the grazing-recreation season were at least one order of magnitude below levels of ecological concern, and were similar to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) estimates for background water quality conditions in the region. The relative percentage of FIB regulatory benchmark exceedances widely varied under individual regional and national water quality standards. Relative to USEPA’s national E. coli FIB benchmarks–the most contemporary and relevant standards for this study–over 90% of the 743 samples collected were below recommended criteria values. FIB concentrations were significantly greater when stream flow was low or stagnant, water was turbid, and when cattle were actively observed at sampling. Recreation sites had the lowest mean FIB, total nitrogen, and soluble-reactive phosphorus concentrations, and there were no significant differences in FIB and nutrient concentrations between key grazing areas and non-concentrated use areas. Our results suggest cattle grazing, recreation, and provisioning of clean water can be compatible goals across these national forest lands."

The isolation of well-defined cell subsets is needed for in vivo and in vitro applications in stem cell biology. In this technical report, we present an approach for defining a subset of interest in a mixed cell population by flow cytometric detection of intracellular antigens. We have developed a fully validated protocol that enables the co-detection of cluster of differentiation (CD) surface antigens on fixed, permeabilized neural cell populations defined by intracellular staining. Determining the degree of co-expression of surface marker candidates with intracellular target population markers (nestin, MAP2, doublecortin, TUJ1) on neuroblastoma cell lines (SH-SY5Y, BE(2)-M17) yielded a combinatorial CD49f(-)/CD200(high) surface marker panel. Its application in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) generated enriched neuronal cultures from differentiated cell suspensions derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. Our data underlines the feasibility of using the described co-labeling protocol and co-expression analysis for quantitative assays in mammalian neurobiology and for screening approaches to identify much needed surface markers in stem cell biology."

We assessed the effects of vitamin D deficiency throughout life (from conception until adulthood) on the severity of ovalbumin-induced allergic airway disease in vitamin D-replete and -deficient BALB/c mice using this model. Vitamin D had protective effects such that deficiency significantly enhanced eosinophil and neutrophil numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of male but not female mice. Vitamin D also suppressed the proliferation and T helper cell type-2 cytokine-secreting capacity of airway-draining lymph node cells from both male and female mice. Supplementation of initially vitamin D-deficient mice with vitamin D for four weeks returned serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D to levels observed in initially vitamin D-replete mice, and also suppressed eosinophil and neutrophil numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of male mice. Using generic 16 S rRNA primers, increased bacterial levels were detected in the lungs of initially vitamin D-deficient male mice, which were also reduced by vitamin D supplementation. These results indicate that vitamin D controls granulocyte levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in an allergen-sensitive manner, and may contribute towards the severity of asthma in a gender-specific fashion through regulation of respiratory bacteria."

However, few studies have involved the analysis of sex-related differences in central anxiety modulation. This study investigated whether MS during breastfeeding affected adult males and females in terms of anxiety and brain GABA-A receptor-alpha-subunit immunoreactivity. The brain areas analyzed were the amygdale (AM), hippocampus (HP), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), medial preoptic area (POA) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Rats were housed under a reversed light/dark cycle (lights off at 7∶00 h) with access to water and food ad libitum. Animals underwent MS twice daily during the dark cycle from postnatal day 1 to postnatal day 21. Behavior was tested when rats were 65–70 days old using the elevated plus maze and after brains were treated for immunohistochemistry. We found that separated females spent more time in the open arms and showed more head dipping behavior compared with controls. The separated males spent more time in the center of the maze and engaged in more stretching behavior than the controls. Immunohistochemistry showed that separated females had less immunostained cells in the HP, mPFC, PVN and POA, while separated males had fewer immunolabeled cells in the PFC, PVN and AM. These results could indicate that MS has gender-specific effects on anxiety behaviors and that these effects are likely related to developmental alterations involving GABA-A neurotransmission."

Among these compounds are the antibiotics polymyxins, and the bacterium is currently being reassessed for medical application. However, a lack of genetic tools for manipulation of P. polymyxa has limited our understanding of the biosynthesis of these compounds. Methods and Principal Findings To facilitate an understanding of the genetic determinants of the bacterium, we have developed a system for marker exchange mutagenesis directly on competent cells of P. polymyxa under conditions where homologous recombination is enhanced by denaturation of the suicide plasmid DNA. To test this system, we targeted P. polymyxa α-and β-amylase genes for disruption. Chloramphenicol or erythromycin resistance genes were inserted into the suicide plasmid pGEM7Z-f+ (Promega). To mediate homologous recombination and replacement of the targeted genes with the antibiotic resistance genes nucleotide sequences of the α-and β-amylase genes were cloned into the plasmid flanking the antibiotic resistance genes. Conclusions We have created a simple system for targeted gene deletion in P. polymyxa E681. We propose that P. polymyxa isogenic mutants could be developed using this system of marker exchange mutagenesis. α-and β-amylase genes provide a useful tool for direct recombinant screening in P. polymyxa."

One lactating dairy cow received a constant infusion of L-[1-(13)C]phenylalanine (450 µmol/min) for 96 h. Plasma and milk were collected prior to, during, and after the stable isotope infusion. Twenty-four hours after cessation of the infusion the cow was slaughtered. The meat and samples of the various organ tissues (liver, heart, lung, udder, kidney, rumen, small intestine, and colon) were collected and stored. Approximately 210 kg of intrinsically labeled beef (bone and fat free) with an average L-[1-(13)C]phenylalanine enrichment of 1.8±0.1 mole percent excess (MPE) was obtained. The various organ tissues differed substantially in L-[1-(13)C]phenylalanine enrichments in the tissue protein bound pool, the highest enrichment levels were achieved in the kidney (11.7 MPE) and the lowest enrichment levels in the skeletal muscle tissue protein of the cow (between 1.5-2.4 MPE). The estimated protein synthesis rates of the various organ tissues should be regarded as underestimates, particularly for the organs with the higher turnover rates and high secretory activity, due to the lengthened (96 h) measurement period necessary for the production of the intrinsically labeled beef. Our data demonstrates that there are relatively small differences in L-[1-(13)C]phenylalanine enrichments between the various meat cuts, but substantial higher enrichment values are observed in the various organ tissues. We conclude that protein turnover rates of various organs are much higher when compared to skeletal muscle protein turnover rates in large lactating ruminants."
https://openalex.org/W2036595874,"Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is an attractive animal model for biological and biomedical research because it permits relatively easy genetic dissection of cellular pathways, including insulin/IGF-like signaling (IIS), that are conserved in mammalian cells. To explore C. elegans as a model system to study the regulation of the facilitative glucose transporter (GLUT), we have characterized the GLUT gene homologues in C. elegans: fgt-1, R09B5.11, C35A11.4, F53H8.3, F48E3.2, F13B12.2, Y61A9LA.1, K08F9.1 and Y37A1A.3. The exogenous expression of these gene products in Xenopus oocytes showed transport activity to unmetabolized glucose analogue 2-deoxy-D-glucose only in FGT-1. The FGT-1-mediated transport activity was inhibited by the specific GLUT inhibitor phloretin and exhibited a Michaelis constant (Km) of 2.8 mM. Mannose, galactose, and fructose were able to inhibit FGT-1-mediated 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake (P < 0.01), indicating that FGT-1 is also able to transport these hexose sugars. A GFP fusion protein of FGT-1 was observed only on the basolateral membrane of digestive tract epithelia in C. elegans, but not in other tissues. FGT-1::eGFP expression was observed from early embryonic stages. The knockdown or mutation of fgt-1 resulted in increased fat staining in both wild-type and daf-2 (mammalian insulin receptor homologue) mutant animals. Other common phenotypes of IIS mutant animals, including dauer formation and brood size reduction, were not affected by fgt-1 knockdown in wild-type or daf-2 mutants. Our results indicated that in C. elegans, FGT-1 is mainly a mammalian GLUT2-like intestinal glucose transporter and is involved in lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2056709940,"Rab37 belongs to a subclass of Rab GTPases regulating exocytosis, including also Rab3a and Rab27a. Proteomic studies indicate that Rab37 is associated with insulin-containing large dense core granules of pancreatic β-cells. In agreement with these observations, we detected Rab37 in extracts of β-cell lines and human pancreatic islets and confirmed by confocal microscopy the localization of the GTPase on insulin-containing secretory granules. We found that, as is the case for Rab3a and Rab27a, reduction of Rab37 levels by RNA interference leads to impairment in glucose-induced insulin secretion and to a decrease in the number of granules in close apposition to the plasma membrane. Pull-down experiments revealed that, despite similar functional effects, Rab37 does not interact with known Rab3a or Rab27a effectors and is likely to operate through a different mechanism. Exposure of insulin-secreting cells to proinflammatory cytokines, fatty acids or oxidized low-density lipoproteins, mimicking physiopathological conditions that favor the development of diabetes, resulted in a decrease in Rab37 expression. Our data identify Rab37 as an additional component of the machinery governing exocytosis of β-cells and suggest that impaired expression of this GTPase may contribute to defective insulin release in pre-diabetic and diabetic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2064547968,"Site-specific proteases are important tools for in vitro and in vivo cleavage of proteins. They are widely used for diverse applications, like protein purification, assessment of protein–protein interactions or regulation of protein localization, abundance or activity. Here, we report the development of a procedure to select protease variants with altered specificity based on the well-established Saccharomyces cerevisiae adenine auxotrophy-dependent red/white colony assay. We applied this method on the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease to obtain a protease variant with altered substrate specificity at the P1’ Position. In vivo experiments with tester substrates showed that the mutated TEV protease still efficiently recognizes the sequence ENLYFQ, but has almost lost all bias for the amino acid at the P1’ Position. Thus, we generated a site-specific protease for synthetic approaches requiring in vivo generation of proteins or peptides with a specific N-terminal amino acid."
https://openalex.org/W1987085921,"During zebrafish development, a gradient of stromal-derived factor 1a (Sdf1a) provides the directional cue that guides the migration of the primordial germ cells (PGCs) to the gonadal tissue. Here we describe a method to produce large numbers of infertile fish by inducing ubiquitous expression of Sdf1a in zebrafish embryos resulting in disruption of the normal PGC migration pattern. A transgenic line of zebrafish, Tg(hsp70:sdf1a-nanos3, EGFP), was generated that expresses Sdf1a under the control of the heat-shock protein 70 (hsp70) promoter and nanos3 3?UTR. To better visualize the PGCs, the Tg(hsp70:sdf1a-nanos3, EGFP) fish were crossed with another transgenic line, Tg(kop:DsRed-nanos3), that expresses DsRed driven by the PGC-specific kop promoter. Heat treatment of the transgenic embryos caused an induction of Sdf1a expression throughout the embryo resulting in the disruption of their normal migration. Optimal embryo survival and disruption of PGC migration was achieved when transgenic embryos at the 4- to 8-cell stage were incubated at 34.5°C for 18 hours. Under these conditions, disruption of PGC migration was observed in 100% of the embryos. Sixty-four adult fish were developed from three separate batches of heat-treated embryos and all were found to be infertile males. When each male was paired with a wild-type female, only unfertilized eggs were produced and histological examination revealed that each of the adult male fish possessed severely under-developed gonads that lacked gametes. The results demonstrate that inducible Sdf1a expression is an efficient and reliable strategy to produce infertile fish. This approach makes it convenient to generate large numbers of infertile adult fish while also providing the capability to maintain a fertile brood stock."
https://openalex.org/W2102604342,"Black pigmented leaves are common among horticultural cultivars, yet are extremely rare across natural plant populations. We hypothesised that black pigmentation would disadvantage a plant by reducing photosynthesis and therefore shoot productivity, but that this trait might also confer protective benefits by shielding chloroplasts against photo-oxidative stress. CO2 assimilation, chlorophyll a fluorescence, shoot biomass, and pigment concentrations were compared for near isogenic green- and black-leafed Ophiopogon planiscapus ‘Nigrescens’. The black leaves had lower maximum CO2 assimilation rates, higher light saturation points and higher quantum efficiencies of photosystem II (PSII) than green leaves. Under saturating light, PSII photochemistry was inactivated less and recovered more completely in the black leaves. In full sunlight, green plants branched more abundantly and accumulated shoot biomass quicker than the black plants; in the shade, productivities of the two morphs were comparable. The data indicate a light-screening, photoprotective role of foliar anthocyanins. However, limitations to photosynthetic carbon assimilation are relatively small, insufficient to explain the natural scarcity of black-leafed plants."
https://openalex.org/W2117112788,"Functional MRI (fMRI) using the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal is a common technique in the study of brain function. The BOLD signal is sensitive to the complex interaction of physiological changes including cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and cerebral oxygen metabolism (CMRO2). A primary goal of quantitative fMRI methods is to combine BOLD imaging with other measurements (such as CBF measured with arterial spin labeling) to derive information about CMRO2. This requires an accurate mathematical model to relate the BOLD signal to the physiological and hemodynamic changes; the most commonly used of these is the Davis model. Here, we propose a new nonlinear model that is straightforward and shows heuristic value in clearly relating the BOLD signal to blood flow, blood volume and the blood flow-oxygen metabolism coupling ratio. The model was tested for accuracy against a more detailed model adapted for magnetic fields of 1.5, 3 and 7T. The mathematical form of the heuristic model suggests a new ratio method for comparing combined BOLD and CBF data from two different stimulus responses to determine whether CBF and CMRO2 coupling differs. The method does not require a calibration experiment or knowledge of parameter values as long as the exponential parameter describing the CBF-CBV relationship remains constant between stimuli. The method was found to work well for 1.5 and 3T but is prone to systematic error at 7T. If more specific information regarding changes in CMRO2 is required, then with accuracy similar to that of the Davis model, the heuristic model can be applied to calibrated BOLD data at 1.5T, 3T and 7T. Both models work well over a reasonable range of blood flow and oxygen metabolism changes but are less accurate when applied to a simulated caffeine experiment in which CBF decreases and CMRO2 increases."
https://openalex.org/W2036580961,"There are currently no biological tests that differentiate patients with bipolar disorder (BPD) from healthy controls. While there is evidence that peripheral gene expression differences between patients and controls can be utilized as biomarkers for psychiatric illness, it is unclear whether current use or residual effects of antipsychotic and mood stabilizer medication drives much of the differential transcription. We therefore tested whether expression changes in first-episode, never-medicated BPD patients, can contribute to a biological classifier that is less influenced by medication and could potentially form a practicable biomarker assay for BPD. We employed microarray technology to measure global leukocyte gene expression in first-episode (n=3) and currently medicated BPD patients (n=26), and matched healthy controls (n=25). Following an initial feature selection of the microarray data, we developed a cross-validated 10-gene model that was able to correctly predict the diagnostic group of the training sample (26 medicated patients and 12 controls), with 89% sensitivity and 75% specificity (p<0.001). The 10-gene predictor was further explored via testing on an independent cohort consisting of three pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for BPD, plus the original enrichment sample cohort (the three never-medicated BPD patients and 13 matched control subjects), and a sample of experimental replicates (n=34). 83% of the independent test sample was correctly predicted, with a sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 100% (although this result did not reach statistical significance). Additionally, 88% of sample diagnostic classes were classified correctly for both the enrichment (p=0.015) and the replicate samples (p<0.001). We have developed a peripheral gene expression biomarker profile, that can classify healthy controls from patients with BPD receiving antipsychotic or mood stabilizing medication, which has both high sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, assay of three first-episode patients who had never received such medications, to first enrich the expression dataset for disease-related genes independent of medication effects, and then to test the 10-gene predictor, validates the peripheral biomarker approach for BPD."
https://openalex.org/W2049978634,"Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a critical pathogenesis in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common cause of blindness in developed countries. To date, the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying CNV have not been elucidated. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) has been previously implicated in angiogenesis; however, the roles of PAF and its receptor (PAF-R) in CNV have not been addressed. The present study reveals several important findings concerning the relationship of the PAF-R signaling with CNV. PAF-R was detected in a mouse model of laser-induced CNV and was upregulated during CNV development. Experimental CNV was suppressed by administering WEB2086, a novel PAF-R antagonist. WEB2086-dependent suppression of CNV occurred via the inhibition of macrophage infiltration and the expression of proangiogenic (vascular endothelial growth factor) and proinflammatory molecules (monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and IL-6) in the retinal pigment epithelium-choroid complex. Additionally, WEB2086-induced PAF-R blockage suppresses experimentally induced subretinal fibrosis, which resembles the fibrotic subretinal scarring observed in neovascular AMD. As optimal treatment modalities for neovascular AMD would target the multiple mechanisms of AMD-associated vision loss, including neovascularization, inflammation and fibrosis, our results suggest PAF-R as an attractive molecular target in the treatment of AMD."

This study was therefore designed to evaluate the awareness rate of chronic diseases knowledge among people aged over 60 years, to explore its related factors and to provide evidence for future health education.A cross-sectional study was conducted from April to August in 2011. People aged 60 years and above from 3 communities in Jinan were selected by cluster sampling. Nine hundred and twenty five participants were interviewed face-to-face using a structured questionnaire.The awareness rates of chronic diseases knowledge varied from 29.5% to 90.2%. Four healthy lifestyles including quitting smoking and less drinking, keeping broad-minded, maintaining balanced diet and moderate physical activity were best known (from 86.3% to 90.2%). The least known knowledge were 2 complications of hypertension: nephropathy (29.5%) and retinopathy (37.2%). Participants with the following characteristics or behaviors were more likely to have higher chronic diseases knowledge: younger age, female, Han Chinese, higher level of education, having health insurance, participating in societies, having family history of chronic diseases, frequently gathering with friends/relatives, usually going to provincial hospitals/hospitals affiliated with medical universities, usually going to municipal hospitals and usually going to community health center/station.Old people in Jinan had incomplete chronic diseases knowledge and the overall awareness rate was not high. The older people's chronic diseases knowledge should be improved and health education programs should target males, older people with lower educational level, having no health insurance, having no family history of chronic diseases, participating in no societies, and less frequently gathering with friends/relatives. Also, lower level medical facilities should improve their skills of health education."
https://openalex.org/W2023773047,"Ability to anticipate aversive events is important for avoiding dangerous or unpleasant situations. The motivation to avoid an event is influenced by the incentive salience of an event-predicting cue. In an avoidance fMRI task we used tone intensities to manipulate salience in order to study the involvement of the orbitofrontal cortex in processing of incentive salience. In the task, cues predicting either aversive or neutral avoidable tones were presented. Ventral striatum, amygdala and anterior insula activations were significantly stronger during presentation of cues for aversive than neutral tones. A psychophysiological interaction analysis showed stronger connectivity between the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex during aversive than neutral conditions. The present study shows an interaction between the ventral striatum, a structure previously linked to negative incentive salience, and the orbitofrontal cortex supporting a role for this region in processing salience. In addition, this study replicates previous findings suggesting that the task is robust."
https://openalex.org/W2056695033,"ATP binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) mediates the cholesterol transport from cells to high-density lipoprotein (HDL), but the role of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the main protein constituent of HDL, in this process is not clear. To address this, we measured cholesterol efflux from HEK293 cells or J774 mouse macrophages overexpressing ABCG1 using as acceptors reconstituted HDL (rHDL) containing wild-type or various mutant apoA-I forms. It was found that ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux was severely reduced (by 89%) when using rHDL containing the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant apoA-I[Δ(185–243)]. ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux was not affected or moderately decreased by rHDL containing amino-terminal deletion mutants and several mid-region deletion or point apoA-I mutants, and was restored to 69–99% of control by double deletion mutants apoA-I[Δ(1–41)Δ(185–243)] and apoA-I[Δ(1–59)Δ(185–243)]. These findings suggest that the central helices alone of apoA-I associated to rHDL can promote ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux. Further analysis showed that rHDL containing the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant apoA-I[Δ(185–243)] only slightly reduced (by 22%) the ABCG1-mediated efflux of 7-ketocholesterol, indicating that depending on the sterol type, structural changes in rHDL-associated apoA-I affect differently the ABCG1-mediated efflux of cholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol. Overall, our findings demonstrate that rHDL-associated apoA-I structural changes affect the capacity of rHDL to accept cellular cholesterol by an ABCG1-mediated process. The structure-function relationship seen here between rHDL-associated apoA-I mutants and ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux closely resembles that seen before in lipid-free apoA-I mutants and ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux, suggesting that both processes depend on the same structural determinants of apoA-I."
https://openalex.org/W2114363910,"Human rhinoviruses (HRVs), in the Enterovirus genus within the family Picornaviridae, are a highly prevalent cause of acute respiratory infection (ARI). Enteroviruses are genetically highly variable, and recombination between serotypes is known to be a major contribution to their diversity. Recently it was reported that recombination events in HRVs cause the diversity of HRV-C. This study analyzed parts of the viral genes spanning the 5' non- coding region (NCR) through to the viral protein (VP) encoding sequences of 105 HRV field isolates from 51 outpatient cases of Acute Respiratory Infectious Network (ARINET) and 54 inpatient cases of severe lower respiratory infection (SLRI) surveillance, in order to identify recombination in field samples. When analyzing parts of the 5'NCR and VP4/VP2 encoding sequences, we found intra- and interspecies recombinants in field strains of HRV-A and -C. Nineteen cases of recombination events (18.1%) were found among 105 field strains. For HRV-A, there were five cases (4.8%) of intraspecies recombination events and three cases (2.8%) of interspecies recombination events. For HRV-C, there were four cases (3.8%) of intraspecies recombination events and seven cases (6.7%) of interspecies recombination events. Recombination events were significantly more frequently observed in the ARINET samples (18 cases) than in the SLRI samples (1 case; P< 0.0001). The recombination breakpoints were located in nucleotides (nt) 472-554, which comprise stem-loop 5 in the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES), based on the HRV-B 35 sequence (accession no. FJ445187). Our findings regarding genomic recombination in circulating HRV-A and -C strains suggest that recombination might play a role in HRV fitness and could be a possible determinant of disease severity caused by various HRV infections in patients with ARI."
https://openalex.org/W2107306738,"Within ecology, there are unanswered questions about species-habitat interactions, which could potentially be resolved by a pragmatic analysis of a long-term volunteer-collected dataset. Here, we analysed 18 years of volunteer-collected data from a UK dormouse nestbox monitoring programme to determine the influence of habitat variables on nestbox choice by common dormice (Muscardinus avellanarius). We measured a range of habitat variables in a coppiced woodland in Gloucestershire, UK, and analysed these in relation to dormouse nestbox occupancy records (by dormice, other small mammals, and birds) collected by volunteers. While some characteristics of the woodland had changed over 18 years, simple transformation of the data and interpretation of the results indicated that the dataset was informative. Using stepwise regressions, multiple environmental and ecological factors were found to determine nestbox selection. Distance from the edge of the wood was the most influential (this did not change over 18 years), with boxes in the woodland interior being selected preferentially. There was a significant negative relationship with the presence of ferns (indicative of damp shady conditions). The presence of oak (a long-lived species), and the clumped structural complexity of the canopy were also important factors in the final model. There was no evidence of competition between dormice and birds or other mammals. The results provide greater understanding of artificial dormouse nest-site requirements and indicate that, in terms of habitat selection, long-term volunteer-collected datasets contribute usefully to understanding the requirements of species with an important conservation status."
https://openalex.org/W2030827817,"Introduction We reported that ryanodine receptors are expressed in two different types of mammalian peripheral taste receptor cells: Type II and Type III cells. Type II cells lack voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and chemical synapses. In these cells, ryanodine receptors contribute to the taste-evoked calcium signals that are initiated by opening inositol trisphosphate receptors located on internal calcium stores. In Type III cells that do have VGCCs and chemical synapses, ryanodine receptors contribute to the depolarization-dependent calcium influx. Methodology/Principal Findings The goal of this study was to establish if there was selectivity in the type of VGCC that is associated with the ryanodine receptor in the Type III taste cells or if the ryanodine receptor opens irrespective of the calcium channels involved. We also wished to determine if the ryanodine receptors and VGCCs require a physical linkage to interact or are simply functionally associated with each other. Using calcium imaging and pharmacological inhibitors, we found that ryanodine receptors are selectively associated with L type VGCCs but likely not through a physical linkage. Conclusions/Significance Taste cells are able to undergo calcium induced calcium release through ryanodine receptors to increase the initial calcium influx signal and provide a larger calcium response than would otherwise occur when L type channels are activated in Type III taste cells."
https://openalex.org/W2139096029,"The audibility of a target tone in a multitone background masker is enhanced by the presentation of a precursor sound consisting of the masker alone. There is evidence that precursor-induced neural adaptation plays a role in this perceptual enhancement. However, the precursor may also be strategically used by listeners as a spectral template of the following masker to better segregate it from the target. In the present study, we tested this hypothesis by measuring the audibility of a target tone in a multitone masker after the presentation of precursors which, in some conditions, were made dissimilar to the masker by gating their components asynchronously. The precursor and the following sound were presented either to the same ear or to opposite ears. In either case, we found no significant difference in the amount of enhancement produced by synchronous and asynchronous precursors. In a second experiment, listeners had to judge whether a synchronous multitone complex contained exactly the same tones as a preceding precursor complex or had one tone less. In this experiment, listeners performed significantly better with synchronous than with asynchronous precursors, showing that asynchronous precursors were poorer perceptual templates of the synchronous multitone complexes. Overall, our findings indicate that precursor-induced auditory enhancement cannot be fully explained by the strategic use of the precursor as a template of the following masker. Our results are consistent with an explanation of enhancement based on selective neural adaptation taking place at a central locus of the auditory system."
https://openalex.org/W2018488386,"The body concentration of iron is regulated by a fine equilibrium between absorption and losses of iron. Iron can be absorbed from diet as inorganic iron or as heme. Hemopexin is an acute phase protein that limits iron access to microorganisms. Moreover, it is the plasma protein with the highest binding affinity for heme and thus it mediates heme-iron recycling. Considering its involvement in iron homeostasis, it was postulated that hemopexin may play a role in the physiological absorption of inorganic iron.Hemopexin-null mice showed elevated iron deposits in enterocytes, associated with higher duodenal H-Ferritin levels and a significant increase in duodenal expression and activity of heme oxygenase. The expression of heme-iron and inorganic iron transporters was normal. The rate of iron absorption was assessed by measuring the amount of (57)Fe retained in tissues from hemopexin-null and wild-type animals after administration of an oral dose of (57)FeSO4 or of (57)Fe-labelled heme. Higher iron retention in the duodenum of hemopexin-null mice was observed as compared with normal mice. Conversely, iron transfer from enterocytes to liver and bone marrow was unaffected in hemopexin-null mice.The increased iron level in hemopexin-null duodenum can be accounted for by an increased iron uptake by enterocytes and storage in ferritins. These data indicate that the lack of hemopexin under physiological conditions leads to an enhanced duodenal iron uptake thus providing new insights to our understanding of body iron homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2078686873,"Tetanus toxin (TeTx) is the protein, synthesized by the anaerobic bacteria Clostridium tetani, which causes tetanus disease. TeTx gains entry into target cells by means of its interaction with lipid rafts, which are membrane domains enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol. However, the exact mechanism of host membrane binding remains to be fully established. In the present study we used the recombinant carboxyl terminal fragment from TeTx (Hc-TeTx), the domain responsible for target neuron binding, showing that Hc-TeTx induces a moderate but rapid and sustained increase in the ceramide/sphingomyelin ratio in primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons and in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells, as well as induces the formation of ceramide platforms in the plasma membrane. The mentioned increase is due to the promotion of neutral sphingomyelinase activity and not to the de novo synthesis, since GW4869, a specific neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor, prevents neutral sphingomyelinase activity increase and formation of ceramide platforms. Moreover, neutral sphingomyelinase inhibition with GW4869 prevents Hc-TeTx-triggered signaling (Akt phosphorylation), as well as the protective effect of Hc-TeTx on PC12 cells subjected to oxidative stress, while siRNA directed against nSM2 prevents protection by Hc-TeTx of NSC-34 cells against oxidative insult. Finally, neutral sphingomyelinase activity seems not to be related with the internalization of Hc-TeTx into PC12 cells. Thus, the presented data shed light on the mechanisms triggered by TeTx after membrane binding, which could be related with the events leading to the neuroprotective action exerted by the Hc-TeTx fragment."

We recently reported that MARVELD1 interacts with importin β1, which plays an important role in nonsense-mediated RNA decay(NMD). Here, we demonstrate that MARVELD1 substantially inhibits nonsense-mediated RNA decay by decreasing the pioneer round of translation but not steady-state translation, and we identify MARVELD1 as an important component of the molecular machinery containing UPF1 and Y14. Furthermore, we determined the specific regions of MARVELD1 and UPF1 responsible for their interaction. We also showed that MARVELD1 promotes the dissociation of SMG1 from UPF1, resulting in the repression of serine phosphorylation of UPF1, and subsequently blocks the recruitment of SMG5, which is required for ensuing SMG5-mediated exonucleolytic decay. Our observations provide molecular insight into the potential function of MARVELD1 in nonsense-mediated RNA decay."
https://openalex.org/W1975639359,"Elevated rates of mating and reproduction cause decreased female survival and lifetime reproductive success across a wide range of taxa from flies to humans. These costs are fundamentally important to the evolution of life histories. Here we investigate the potential mechanistic basis of this classic life history component. We conducted 4 independent replicated experiments in which female Drosophila melanogaster were subjected to 'high' and 'low' mating regimes, resulting in highly significant differences in lifespan. We sampled females for transcriptomic analysis at day 10 of life, before the visible onset of ageing, and used Tiling expression arrays to detect differential gene expression in two body parts (abdomen versus head+thorax). The divergent mating regimes were associated with significant differential expression in a network of genes showing evidence for interactions with ecdysone receptor. Preliminary experimental manipulation of two genes in that network with roles in post-transcriptional modification (CG11486, eyegone) tended to enhance sensitivity to mating costs. However, the subtle nature of those effects suggests substantial functional redundancy or parallelism in this gene network, which could buffer females against excessive responses. There was also evidence for differential expression in genes involved in germline maintenance, cell proliferation and in gustation / odorant reception. Interestingly, we detected differential expression in three specific genes (EcR, keap1, lbk1) and one class of genes (gustation / odorant receptors) with previously reported roles in determining lifespan. Our results suggest that high and low mating regimes that lead to divergence in lifespan are associated with changes in the expression of genes such as reproductive hormones, that influence resource allocation to the germ line, and that may modify post-translational gene expression. This predicts that the correct signalling of nutrient levels to the reproductive system is important for maintaining organismal integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2054089604,"The molecular and cellular mechanisms by which long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) exert their beneficial effects on cardiovascular health remain obscure. While both LCPUFA and bradykinin (BK) signaling pathway play a role in the cardiovascular system, any direct link between the two is yet to be established. Using picosecond time-resolved fluorescence microscopy and a genetically engineered bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R) sensor (B2K-CC), we detected LCPUFA-induced conformational responses in the B2R similar to those caused by its cognate ligand, BK. The selective B2R antagonist (HOE-140) blocked the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20∶5, n-3) induced conformational response of the B2K-CC. Further analysis suggests that LCPUFA are capable of direct, B2R-dependent activation of extracellular ligand-regulated kinases (ERK). From a wide range of fatty acids studied, varying in chain length, saturation, and position of double bonds, EPA, docosahexaenoic (DHA, C22∶6, n-3), docosadienoic (DDA, C22∶2, n-6), and dihomo-gamma linoleic (DGLA, C20∶3, n-6) fatty acids caused the highest ERK phosphorylation. EPA or DHA dependent ERK phosphorylation was inhibited by the selective B2R antagonist. We show that LCPUFA stimulates downstream signaling by B2R such as B2R-dependent phosphorylation and expression regulation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS). Further analysis indicated that LCPUFA also alters levels of the eNOS transcription factor, kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2). Moreover we show that EPA increases membrane fluidity on the same time scale as B2R conformational response, suggesting that partitioning of LCPUFA into bilayer is a primary step required for receptor activation. In summary our data show that LCPUFA activate B2R receptor at nanomolar concentrations suggesting a novel molecular mechanism by which fatty acids may affect the cardiovascular system."

Results The final study sample included 54 workers from the workers’ compensation registry and 72 co-workers. This sample of 126 workers was based on an initial random sample of 822 workers with a compensation claim, or a ratio of 1 recruited worker to approximately 7 sampled workers. The average recruitment cost was CND$262/injured worker and CND$240/participating worksite including co-workers. The sample was representative of the heavy industry workforce, and was successful in recruiting the self-employed (8.2%), workers from small employers (<20 workers, 38.7%), and workers from diverse working environments (49 worksites, 29 worksite types, and 51 occupations). Conclusions The recruitment rate was low but the cost per participant reasonable and the sample representative of workers in small worksites. Small worksites represent a significant portion of the workforce but are typically underrepresented in occupational research despite having distinct working conditions, exposures and health risks worthy of investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2064742921,"The intracellular accumulation of small organic solutes was described in the marine bacterium Rhodopirellula baltica, which belongs to the globally distributed phylum Planctomycetes whose members exhibit an intriguing lifestyle and cell morphology. Sucrose, α-glutamate, trehalose and mannosylglucosylglycerate (MGG) are the main solutes involved in the osmoadaptation of R. baltica. The ratio and total intracellular organic solutes varied significantly in response to an increase in salinity, temperature and nitrogen content. R. baltica displayed an initial response to both osmotic and thermal stresses that includes α-glutamate accumulation. This trend was followed by a rather unique and complex osmoadaptation mechanism characterized by a dual response to sub-optimal and supra-optimal salinities. A reduction in the salinity to sub-optimal conditions led primarily to the accumulation of trehalose. In contrast, R. baltica responded to salt stress mostly by increasing the intracellular levels of sucrose. The switch between the accumulation of trehalose and sucrose was by far the most significant effect caused by increasing the salt levels of the medium. Additionally, MGG accumulation was found to be salt- as well as nitrogen-dependent. MGG accumulation was regulated by nitrogen levels replacing α-glutamate as a K+ counterion in nitrogen-poor environments. This is the first report of the accumulation of compatible solutes in the phylum Planctomycetes and of the MGG accumulation in a mesophilic organism."
https://openalex.org/W2085125179,"Background Linezolid (LZD) is beneficial to patients with MRSA pneumonia, but whether and how LZD influences global host lung immune responses at the mRNA level during MRSA-mediated pneumonia is still unknown. Methods A lethal mouse model of MRSA pneumonia mediated by USA300 was employed to study the influence of LZD on survival, while the sublethal mouse model was used to examine the effect of LZD on bacterial clearance and lung gene expression during MRSA pneumonia. LZD (100mg/kg/day, IP) was given to C57Bl6 mice for three days. On Day 1 and Day 3 post infection, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) protein concentration and levels of cytokines including IL6, TNFα, IL1β, Interferon-γ and IL17 were measured. In the sublethal model, left lungs were used to determine bacterial clearance and right lungs for whole-genome transcriptional profiling of lung immune responses. Results LZD therapy significantly improved survival and bacterial clearance. It also significantly decreased BALF protein concentration and levels of cytokines including IL6, IL1β, Interferon-γ and IL17. No significant gene expression changes in the mouse lungs were associated with LZD therapy. Conclusion LZD is beneficial to MRSA pneumonia, but it does not modulate host lung immune responses at the transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W2010830389,"Partial cleavage of p120 RasGAP by caspase-3 in stressed cells generates an N-terminal fragment, called fragment N, which activates an anti-apoptotic Akt-dependent survival response. Akt regulates several effectors but which of these mediate fragment N-dependent cell protection has not been defined yet. Here we have investigated the role of mTORC1, Bad, and survivin in the capacity of fragment N to protect cells from apoptosis. Neither rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTORC1, nor silencing of raptor, a subunit of the mTORC1 complex, altered the ability of fragment N from inhibiting cisplatin- and Fas ligand-induced death. Cells lacking Bad, despite displaying a stronger resistance to apoptosis, were still protected by fragment N against cisplatin-induced death. Fragment N was also able to protect cells from Fas ligand-induced death in conditions where Bad plays no role in apoptosis regulation. Fragment N expression in cells did neither modulate survivin mRNA nor its protein expression. Moreover, the expression of cytoplasmic survivin, known to exert anti-apoptotic actions in cells, still occurred in UV-B-irradiated epidermis of mouse expressing a caspase-3-resistant RasGAP mutant that cannot produce fragment N. Additionally, survivin function in cell cycle progression was not affected by fragment N. These results indicate that, taken individually, mTOR, Bad, or Survivin are not required for fragment N to protect cells from cell death. We conclude that downstream targets of Akt other than mTORC1, Bad, or survivin mediate fragment N-induced protection or that several Akt effectors can compensate for each other to induce the pro-survival fragment N-dependent response."
https://openalex.org/W2035216630,"Political and industrial factors—beyond the economic headwinds—may be causing public investment in biomedical research to slow down around the world. Political and industrial factors—beyond the economic headwinds—may be causing public investment in biomedical research to slow down around the world. It was 10 years ago that the US National Institutes of Health (NIH)—the largest research agency in the world—completed an incredible 5 year project to double its budget.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The doubling took the NIH annual budget from $13.6 billion in 1998 to $27.1 billion in 2003, sparked a visible building boom at medical research centers in most major US cities, and sucked in graduate students, postdocs, and researchers from every corner of the globe. But now, biomedical research funding is falling back to Earth with a bump. Total public spending on research and development by the US federal government has fallen for 4 years in a row (see chart). “These are absolutely the biggest cuts we’ve seen in recent times,” says Mark Hourihan, director of the R&D Budget and Policy Program at the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Uncomfortably for life scientists, the cuts in biomedical research have been even steeper than in other disciplines. And rather than being some kind of aberration, the US pattern is being reflected elsewhere. Of the world’s established scientific powers, only Germany is consistently increasing its spending (see map). Among the emerging powers, China and South Korea are also doing so—and their progress is stirring up the global circulation of students and ideas. But, although these two nation’s fresh investment is significant, it is not commensurate with the drop in spending elsewhere. The budget of the NIH—aided by a $10 billion blast of stimulus funds—reached about $35 billion in 2010. It has fallen back since, as the stimulus fades. And, this year, after the unexpected passage of an across-the-board spending cut known as “sequestration,” it will fall by another $1.5 billion to $29.3 billion. “This is a very serious blow that we’d hoped to avoid,” says Francis Collins, a geneticist and director of NIH. “About three-quarters of the budget is already committed, so a blow like this could fall heavily on new proposals. That is particularly worrying, as these represent our future.” To try to relieve the impact of sequestration, several NIH institutes are shaving 5% of funds that they had already pledged to commit this year, Collins says. He adds that the NIH will be “looking to trim back” the typical annual value of a NIH’s main funding mechanism, the RO1 grant. Collins says he is acutely aware of the customary hazard that, when funds recede, experienced grant getters win out at the expense of young people with new ideas. “I am very concerned about that, as are all 27 institute directors,” he says, pledging to back schemes such as the agency’s New Innovator Awards “to provide an antidote to the conservative response” that can arise from funding cuts. At US universities and medical schools, the March implementation of the sequestration came as a nasty surprise, despite the prolonged and noisy political debate that preceded it. Jim Siedow, a plant biologist and vice provost for research at Duke University in North Carolina, says that the implications of the cut will become clearer later in the year, as it eats away at envisaged income. “We’re very worried about people losing their grants,” says Siedow, noting that, with most university costs being fixed, “it is in personnel—postdocs and research technicians—that savings will have to be made.” He fears the climate will continue to worsen after this year. “There’s talk of the NIH budget five years from now being 25% less than it is now,” he says. At Duke, he adds, “we haven’t had to make big nasty decisions—yet.” The other major scientific nations of the English-speaking world—Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom—each implemented expansions in biomedical research funding of their own soon after the NIH doubling. In each case, 2013 budgets confirm that this expansion has now ended. Of the main biomedical research agencies in the three nations, the UK Medical Research Council is probably in the best shape. Spending there will increase this year by 3%, in line with a 3 year plan that allows the agency’s budget to grow with inflation. In Canada, a March budget allocated an extra C$160 million to Genome Canada over 3 years, as well as C$220 million for research infrastructure. But overall spending at the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) will fall by 3%. “The focus is to deal with the deficit and throw research a few bones,” says Paul Dufour, a long-time adviser on Canadian research policy based in Quebec. Australia’s economy, like Canada’s, has performed relatively well since 2008, but even so, research there has fallen victim to austerity. Although Warwick Anderson, a physiologist and chief executive of the National Health and Medical Research Council, says that its 2013 budget is “basically in steady state,” he admits that this “has come as a bit of a surprise; people had been used to growth.” But Australian universities complain that last October’s midyear budget whisked away some A$500 million in overhead payments that they had been planning for over the next 4 years and that inflation is also eating into the value of grants. “There’s been a steady chipping away of what’s available,” says Brendan Crabb, a microbiologist and president of the Association of Australian Medical Research Institutes (AAMRI). Such erosion is small beer, however, compared with the turmoil in the countries whose economies have been hardest hit by the financial crisis. Since 2008, Italy and Spain have both experienced rocky descents that have taken away about 40% of their research funding, according to local campaigners. In neither case do official budget figures tell the full story. In Spain, for example, it emerged last September that up to half of the national research budget, allocated as “loans” for companies or research institutes, hadn’t been getting spent at all. “This has been going on for a long time, and the situation is now unsustainable,” says Amaya Moro-Martin, an astrobiologist at the Spanish Research Council in Madrid. “They are dismantling the entire scientific infrastructure of the country.” Moro-Martin helped found a grassroots action group, Investigación Digna (Dignify Research), whose open protest letter to the government has attracted 28,000 signatures. A similar group, Return on Academic Research (ROAR), is active in Italy. There has been little sign, however, that these scientist-activists are having an impact on policy. France, meanwhile, has had its share of economic problems, and last October’s budget granted increases of about 2%—about the same as the rate of inflation—to most research agencies. “The situation we’re facing is difficult,” says Antione Triller, a cell biologist at Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, noting that the success rate for grants at ANR, France’s main grants agency, is down to 13%. Successive governments have sought to pull away from the traditional French model—whereby most researchers hold secure positions at laboratories run by government agencies such as CNRS—and introduce more competitive grants, as in the US and UK. Now that budgets are falling everywhere, the security offered by the old system has its advantages, Triller says: “In a way, in a crisis situation, the French system is not so bad.” For the third year in a row, Germany is the only large European nation to substantially increase science spending. In March’s budget, funding for the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) was up 6.3% to €13.75 billion. Biomedical research will grow somewhat less than that; a BMBF spokeswoman said it didn’t have a precise figure due to “restructuring.” This is a slowdown from 9% growth last year and 11% in 2011. With an election looming and the economy slowing, German scientists worry that their recent spurt of funding growth is coming to an end. After the West’s economy hit the buffers in 2008, research funding in the developing countries, at least, continued to expand. But, of the large, emerging powers—Brazil, Russia, India, and China—only the last seems determined to keep that expansion going. There is, nonetheless, a rebalancing taking place in the flow of researchers between the “developed” and “developing” nations. In 2006, for example, Foundation for Research Support of the State of São Paulo (FAPESP)—the largest research funding agency in South America, serving Brazil’s São Paulo state—started a program to attract foreign postdocs. That year, it had hired just two postdocs from the US, five from Italy, and none from the UK. Last year, according to scientific director Carlos Henrique de Brito Cruz, it took on 19 from the United States, 14 from Italy, and 9 from Britain. “There are three things going on here,” Brito observes. “Brazil is becoming a more interesting address for a scientist. FAPESP created a program to hire them. And funding in the developed countries became more difficult.” Even Russia, where science has struggled to recover its footing ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union, has made some headway in addressing this balance, awarding “megagrants” worth about $5 million each to a handful of principal investigators, many of them returning from positions abroad. New institutions such as Skoltech, an ambitious collaboration between a government-endowed foundation and the Massachusetts Institutes of Technology to build a postgraduate university outside Moscow, are also starting to challenge the Russian Academy of Sciences as centers of influence in Russian science. In February 2012, India released a national 5 year plan that promised to sharply ramp up the budgets of the two main health research agencies, the Department of Biotechnology and the Indian Council of Medical Research. However, the Indian economy has slowed since then; budget increases pledged last year were not implemented, and Indian scientists now say they expect none this year either. Only in the Far East is the funding outlook brighter. After a decade of stagnant funding, Japanese spending picked up last year, and the government announced a “stimulus package” in January that will pour $11 billion into science and technology, including $240 million specifically for stem cell research and larger amounts across all disciplines for infrastructure ($960 million) and industry-university collaboration ($2 billion). It isn’t known how much of that will go to biomedical research or how long it will take to spend; the money was disbursed by March, but the actual expenditure will run over 2 years or perhaps more. Singapore’s Biomedical Research Council has assured funding of S$ 2.4 billion over the 2011–2015 period. Its recent effort to work with industry has drawn in S$ 75 million of additional support from companies over the last 2 years, says Benjamin Seet, the council’s executive director, noting the recent establishment of laboratories by L’Oréal and Procter & Gamble on the island. “Biomedical research has increasing relevance beyond the pharmaceutical industry,” he says. South Korea has often posted double-digit increases in its research spending in recent years. But this slowed to just 5% in 2012, according to revised government figures and will be lucky to match that this year. It is China that continues to pour new resources into research at a rate truly significant on a global scale. Last year, it surpassed Japan as the second-largest global power in research and development, spending an estimated $160 billion last year. The great bulk of this, however, is for product development in the manufacturing industry. Most of China’s best science is in disciplines directly supporting that, such as materials science. China’s investment in biomedical research—which is coming from cities and states, as well as from national agencies in Beijing—has not been reliably estimated. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reports that total Chinese government investment in research and development was $6.9 billion in 2011 and had been growing at an extraordinary compound rate of 20% since 2003. But, in the absence of reliable budget data, there is plenty of other evidence that China is emerging as a real power in biomedical science. According to data published in January by the Nature Publishing Group, for example, Chinese publication in the group’s journals (which are heavily weighted toward the life sciences) grew 4-fold between 2008 and 2012. China comfortably surpassed Australia and is closing in on Japan as the largest scientific power in the Asia-Pacific region. China’s emergence is, however, a bright spot in a darkening picture for global biomedical research. When this informal survey started in Cell 2 years ago, almost all of those interviewed attributed any slowdown in spending to the weak, short-term economic outlook. It is now clear that some additional forces are coming into play. One is the retrenchment in the pharmaceutical industry, which is struggling to fill its drug pipeline and has been closing down major research laboratories. A second—possibly related—factor may be diminishing political faith in biomedical research as a route to better and cheaper healthcare. The drug industry announced thousands of layoffs last year, notably in Australia, Canada, and the UK—countries whose governments had set great store in backing biomedical research. “There’s been a massive restructuring of the industry worldwide,” says Mark Downs, chief executive of the Society of Biology in London, noting how drug companies are now turning to universities and small biotechnology companies for their future product development. “The jury is still out on whether the new model will work.” This change has been accompanied—at least in the US—by adverse developments in the politics of biomedical research. When Congress began to double the NIH budget in 1998, the House and Senate were dominated by “barons” such as Senator Mark Hatfield (Republican, Oregon) and Senator Robert Byrd (Democrat, West Virginia), who feared disease themselves and set great store by the NIH’s ability to fight it. Just one of them—Pennsylvania senator Arlen Specter—single-handedly maneuvered a cool $10 billion for NIH into President Obama’s 2009 stimulus package. Now these men have retired or died to be replaced by congressional leaders who have no particular attachment to medical research. Francis Collins says that his agency is looking out for allies. “We have supporters in both Houses of Congress. Much of this will hang on what leadership of the country can achieve, to put budgetary decision-making on a more rational basis,” he says. “But we’re also fortunate that biomedical research continues to be one of the few issues that is not intrinsically partisan.” Even so, US university administrators worry about where NIH will find congressional support in the future. “There’s a limited number who’ve expressed an interest,” says Duke’s Jim Siedow. “For some reason, the NIH has lost some of its luster. They don’t think that it handled the doubling very well.” It was the US Congress that started the global boom in public funding for biomedical research, giving the NIH more money than any president asked for over many decades. Now, it might be the US Congress that lets the boom subside. If that happens, thousands of young researchers who have committed their lives and careers to the field could be left in the lurch. “We’ve got this system that’s pump-primed all these young people, and now there’s nowhere for them to go,” says Crabb at the AAMRI. For some, attention is turning to what they should be told to do instead. “Only one in ten postdocs is going to become a principal investigator,” says Downs. “This hasn’t been conveyed to them powerfully enough.”"
https://openalex.org/W2015705630,"Background The phenomenon of change blindness may reflect the failure to detect the presence of change or the absence of change. Although performing the latter is considered more difficult than the former, the differential functioning of retrieval/comparison processing that leads to differences between the detection of the presence and the absence of change has not been clarified. This study aimed to fill this research gap by comparing performance in the detection of the presence and the absence of a change in one item among a set of items. Methodology/Principal Findings Twenty subjects performed two types of change detection tasks, the first task was detection of one changed item among a set of unchanged items (detection of the presence of a change) and the other was the detection of one unchanged item among a set of changed items (detection of the absence of a change). The ANOVA results for the percentage of correct responses and signal detection measurement of A’ values regarding change detection and the pattern of the results indicate that the subjects found (1) detection of the presence of change less difficult than detection of the absence of change (2), rejection of the presence of change less difficult than acceptance of the presence of change, and (3) rejection of the absence of change as difficult as acceptance of the absence of change. Conclusions/Significance Retrieval/comparison processing for the detection of the presence of change differs from that for the absence of change, likely because the retrieval/comparison process appears aimed at determining whether an item has changed but not whether an item appears the same as it had previously. This conclusion suggests the existence of an identification process that recognizes each item as the same as that observed previously that exists apart from the mechanism underlying retrieval/comparison processing."
