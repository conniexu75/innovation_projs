https://openalex.org/W2170219825,"Several recent reports indicate that the long, clinically latent phase that characterizes human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of humans is not a period of viral inactivity, but an active process in which cells are being infected and dying at a high rate and in large numbers. These results lead to a simple steady-state model in which infection, cell death, and cell replacement are in balance, and imply that the unique feature of HIV is the extraordinarily large number of replication cycles that occur during infection of a single individual. This turnover drives both the pathogenic process and (even more than mutation rate) the development of genetic variation. This variation includes the inevitable and, in principle, predictable accumulation of mutations such as those conferring resistance to antiviral drugs whose presence before therapy must be considered in the design of therapeutic strategies."

Activating transcription factor-2 (ATF2) was found to be a target of the JNK signal transduction pathway. ATF2 was phosphorylated by JNK on two closely spaced threonine residues within the NH2-terminal activation domain. The replacement of these phosphorylation sites with alanine inhibited the transcriptional activity of ATF2. These mutations also inhibited ATF2-stimulated gene expression mediated by the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor and the adenovirus early region 1A (E1A) oncoprotein. Furthermore, expression of dominant-negative JNK inhibited ATF2 transcriptional activity. Together, these data demonstrate a role for the JNK signal transduction pathway in transcriptional responses mediated by ATF2."

All three syndromes are associated with mutations in RET, which encodes a receptor-like tyrosine kinase. The altered RET alleles were shown to be transforming genes in NIH 3T3 cells as a consequence of constitutive activation of the RET kinase. The MEN2A mutation resulted in RET dimerization at steady state, whereas the MEN2B mutation altered RET catalytic properties both quantitatively and qualitatively. Oncogenic conversion of RET in these neoplastic syndromes establishes germline transmission of dominant transforming genes in human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2074011532,"Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is greatly up-regulated on endothelial cells at sites of inflammation and is involved in leukocyte attachment and extravasation. Previously, we had shown that the ICAM-1 gene expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was transcriptionally regulated by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (Wertheimer, S. J., Myers, C. L., Wallace, R. W., and Parks, T. P.(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 12030-12035). In the present investigation, TNF-αinduced transcription was found to be initiated exclusively at two sites, 40 and 41 base pairs upstream of the translation start site. Deletion analysis of the 5′ regulatory region of the ICAM-1 gene revealed a 92-base pair sequence which was both necessary and sufficient to confer TNF-α responsiveness to a linked luciferase reporter gene in transient transfection assays. This TNF-α-responsive region contained a variant NF-κB site at −187 to −178, which when mutated, completely abolished ICAM-1 promoter activation by TNF-α, interleukin-1β, and lipopolysaccharide. Two inducible nuclear protein complexes bound to the ICAM-1 κB site and were identified as the NF-κB p65 homodimer and p65/p50 heterodimer. Overexpression of p65, but not p50, transactivated the ICAM-1 promoter in a κB site-dependent manner in HUVECs. In addition, p65-mediated transactivation was suppressed by co-expression of p50. Our results suggest that cytokine activation of the ICAM-1 promoter in HUVECs may critically depend on p65 homodimers binding to a variant κB site.

https://openalex.org/W2095433140,"Small changes in the peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule ligands recognized by antigen-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) can convert fully activating complexes into partially activating or even inhibitory ones. This study examined early TCR-dependent signals induced by such partial agonists or antagonists. In contrast to typical agonist ligands, both an antagonist and several partial agonists stimulated a distinct pattern of zeta chain phosphorylation and failed to activate associated ZAP-70 kinase. These results identify a specific step in the early tyrosine phosphorylation cascade that is altered after TCR engagement with modified peptide-MHC molecule complexes. This finding may explain the different biological responses to TCR occupancy by these variant ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2080179979,"Vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation in response to injury is an important etiologic factor in vascular proliferative disorders such as atherosclerosis and restenosis after balloon angioplasty. The retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) is present in the unphosphorylated and active form in quiescent primary arterial SMCs, but is rapidly inactivated by phosphorylation in response to growth factor stimulation in vitro. A replication-defective adenovirus encoding a nonphosphorylatable, constitutively active form of Rb was constructed. Infection of cultured primary rat aortic SMCs with this virus inhibited growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation in vitro. Localized arterial infection with the virus at the time of balloon angioplasty significantly reduced SMC proliferation and neointima formation in both the rat carotid and porcine femoral artery models of restenosis. These results demonstrate the role of Rb in regulating vascular SMC proliferation and suggest a gene therapy approach for vascular proliferative disorders associated with arterial injury."
https://openalex.org/W2089714150,Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules containing extracellular repeats of approximately 110 amino acids. The three-dimensional structure of the amino-terminal repeat of mouse epithelial cadherin was determined by multidimensional heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The calcium ion was bound by a short alpha helix and by loops at one end of the seven-stranded beta-barrel structure. An exposed concave face is in a position to provide homophilic binding specificity and was also sensitive to calcium ligation. Unexpected structural similarities with the immunoglobulin fold suggest an evolutionary relation between calcium-dependent and calcium-independent cell adhesion molecules.

We found that a bovine testis crude nuclear extract conducts uracil-initiated base excision repair in vitro. A 51-base pair synthetic DNA substrate containing a single G:U mismatch was used, and incorporation of dCMP during repair was exclusively to replace uracil. A neutralizing polyclonal antibody against DNA polymerase β (β-pol) inhibited the repair reaction. ddCTP also inhibited the repair reaction, whereas aphidicolin had no significant effect, suggesting that activity of β-pol was required. Next, the base excision repair system was reconstituted using partially purified components. Several of the enzymatic activities required were resolved, such that DNA ligase and the uracil-DNA glycosylase/apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease activities were separated from the DNA polymerase requirement. We found that purified β-pol could restore full DNA repair activity to the DNA polymerase-depleted fraction, whereas purified DNA polymerases α, δ , and ε could not. These results with purified proteins corroborated results obtained with the crude extract and indicate that β-pol is responsible for the single-nucleotide gap filling reaction involved in this in vitro base excision repair system.

https://openalex.org/W2044092807,"Although biochemical experiments suggest that rhodopsin and other receptors coupled to heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins (G proteins) are inactivated by phosphorylation near the carboxyl (COOH)-terminus and the subsequent binding of a capping protein, little is known about the quenching process in vivo. Flash responses were recorded from rods of transgenic mice in which a fraction of the rhodopsin molecules lacked the COOH-terminal phosphorylation sites. In the single photon regime, abnormally prolonged responses, attributed to activation of individual truncated rhodopsins, occurred interspersed with normal responses. The occurrence of the prolonged responses suggests that phosphorylation is required for normal shutoff. Comparison of normal and prolonged single photon responses indicated that rhodopsin begins to be quenched before the peak of the electrical response and that quenching limits the response amplitude."

Some fungal pathogens can enzymatically detoxify host plant saponins, which suggests that saponin detoxification may determine the host range of these fungi. A gene encoding a saponin detoxifying enzyme was cloned from the cereal-infecting fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis. Fungal mutants generated by targeted gene disruption were no longer able to infect the saponin-containing host oats but retained full pathogenicity to wheat (which does not contain saponins). Thus, the ability of a phytopathogenic fungus to detoxify a plant saponin can determine its host range."
https://openalex.org/W2019113077,"A human P-glycoprotein devoid of cysteine residues was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis for studying its topology. The cDNA for human P-glycoprotein-A52 in which codons for cysteines 137, 431, 717, 956, 1074, 1125, 1227, 1288, and 1304 were changed to Ala, was transfected into NIH 3T3 cells and analyzed with respect to its ability to confer resistance to various drugs. The cysteine-less P-glycoprotein-A52 retained the ability to confer resistance to vinblastine, colchicine, doxorubicin, and actinomycin D with only a small decrease in efficiency relative to wild-type enzyme. Cysteine residues were then reintroduced into predicted extracellular or cytoplasmic loops of the cysteine-less P-glycoprotein-A52, and the topology of the protein was determined using membrane-permeant and impermeant thiol-specific reagents. It was found that 8 of 15 cysteine residues introduced into P-glycoprotein-A52 could be biotinylated, when cells expressing the mutant P-glycoprotein were incubated with membrane-permeant biotin maleimide. Biotinylation of a cysteine residue placed in predicted extracellular loops between transmembrane segment (TM) 5 and TM6, TM7 and TM8, or TM11 and TM12 was blocked by pretreatment of the cells with a membrane-impermeant maleimide, suggesting that these residues have an extracellular location. By contrast, biotinylation of cysteine residues located in the predicted cytoplasmic loops between TM2 and TM3, TM4 and TM5, TM8 and TM9, or TM10 and TM11 were not blocked by pretreatment with membrane impermeant maleimide, suggesting that these residues were in the cytoplasm.

INTRODUCTIONP-glycoprotein is a 170-kDa plasma membrane glycoprotein that is responsible for the phenomenon of multidrug resistance in mammalian cells (see reviews by Roninson(1991) and Gottesman and Pastan(1993)). The protein confers resistance to a broad range of cytotoxic agents that do not have a common structure or intracellular target; examples include anticancer drugs such as vinblastine and doxorubicin, antimicrotubule drugs such as colchicine and podophyllotoxin, and toxic peptides such as valinomycin and gramicidin D.Human P-glycoprotein, encoded by the MDR1 1The abbreviations used are: MDRmultidrug resistancePBSphosphate-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTMtransmembrane segmentbiotin maleimide3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytinstilbenedisulfonate maleimide4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acidSERCAsarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPase. gene, consists of 1280 amino acids organized in two tandem repeats of 610 amino acids, joined by a linker region of 60 amino acids. Each repeat consists of an NH2-terminal hydrophobic domain containing six potential transmembrane sequences followed by a hydrophilic domain containing a nucleotide binding site. The amino acid sequence and domain organization of the protein is typical of the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) superfamily of transporters (Hyde et al., 1990).Al-Shawi et al.(1994) showed that ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein is inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide. Maximal inactivation coincided with labeling at two sites, with approximately equal distribution of label between the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal halves of the molecule. ATP prevented the inactivation of P-glycoprotein by N-ethylmaleimide. These results suggest that there is a critical sulfhydryl residue within each catalytic site. They predicted that the critical cysteines were located in the homology A sequences (GNSGCGKS and GSSGCGKS, respectively; Walker et al.(1982)) in the two predicted nucleotide binding domains of Chinese hamster P-glycoprotein.In this study, we tested whether any of the cysteines, including those in the homology A regions, were critical for function by constructing a P-glycoprotein devoid of cysteines. The Cys-less P-glycoprotein retained the ability to confer resistance to cytotoxic agents. This finding provided the basis for an approach to studying the topology of P-glycoprotein. Our approach was to introduce cysteine residues into putative extracellular or cytoplasmic loops of Cys-less P-glycoprotein, followed by chemical modification with membrane-permeant or impermeant thiol-specific probes to determine their sidedness. We show that the pattern of labeling of the cysteine residues is consistent with a model which predicts that P-glycoprotein contains 12 transmembrane segments.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOligonucleotide-directed MutagenesisA full-length MDR1 cDNA cloned from a human kidney cortex cDNA library (Bell et al., 1986) and modified to encode the epitope for monoclonal antibody A52 (Zubrzycka-Gaarn et al., 1984) at the COOH-terminal end of the protein, was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pMT21, as described previously (Loo and Clarke, 1993). The sequence at the COOH terminus of P-glycoprotein that would normally end as TKRQ now became TKRAISLISNSCSPEFDDLPLAEQREACRRGDPRQ. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was carried out as described previously (Loo and Clarke, 1993).Cell CultureProcedures for transient transfection of human HEK 293 cells or stable transfection of mouse NIH 3T3 cells, followed by selection in the presence of vinblastine (5 nM) or colchicine (45 nM) have been described previously (Loo and Clarke, 1993). Drug sensitivity was determined by a tetrazolium-based assay for cell viability (Alley at al., 1988) as described previously (Loo and Clarke, 1993). A cell line stably expressing SERCA1 Ca 2+ -ATPase was generated by cotransfecting vectors p91023B SERCA1 (Clarke et al., 1989) and pWL-neo (Stratagene) into NIH 3T3 cells, followed by selection in the presence of G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Lysates of G418-resistant clones were screened with monoclonal antibody A52 to identify clones expressing SERCA1 Ca 2+ -ATPase.RadiolabelingCells cultured on 60-mm diameter dishes were pulse-labeled for 20 min at 37°C in methionine- and cysteine-free media with 102 μCi/ml Tran 35 35 S-label (1180 Ci/ml, ICN Biomedicals). The labeling medium was replaced with medium containing 10% (v/v) calf serum, and the cells incubated at 37°C. At various intervals, the monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and cells collected by scraping. Immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibody A52 was carried out as described previously (Loo and Clarke, 1993).Labeling with Biotin MaleimideCells expressing the desired construct were washed three times with PBSCM (PBS containing 1 mM MgCl2 and 0.1 mM CaCl2). For blocking, the cells were preincubated with stilbenedisulfonate maleimide (4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid, Molecular Probes Inc.) in PBSCM at room temperature for 5-30 min, washed three times with PBSCM, and then biotinylated by incubation with biotin maleimide (3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin, Molecular Probes Inc.) in PBSCM. Biotin maleimide was added from a stock prepared in Me2SO (dimethyl sulfoxide). The concentration of Me2SO in the labeling medium did not exceed 1% (v/v). After incubating for 5-30 min at room temperature, the cells were washed three times with PBSCM containing 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, once with PBS, and then solubilized with lysis buffer. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody A52. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and biotinylated proteins detected using streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase and chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.).RESULTSMutagenesis of Individual Cysteine ResiduesThe modified human P-glycoprotein in this study contains 9 cysteine residues at positions 137, 431, 717, 956, 1074, 1125, 1227, 1288, and 1304. The first objective was to test whether any individual cysteine was critical for structure or function. Accordingly, site-directed mutagenesis was used to construct mutant cDNAs in which each cysteine was changed to alanine. Mutant cDNAs were expressed in mouse NIH 3T3 cells and analyzed with respect to their ability to confer resistance to various drugs. All of the mutants yielded a protein of apparent mass 170 kDa, and the relative resistances of each of these mutants to colchicine, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and actinomycin D were indistinguishable from that of wild-type P-glycoprotein-A52 (data not shown). These results indicate that none of the cysteine residues were essential for activity.Construction and Activity of a Cys-less P-glycoproteinSince none of the cysteines were essential for activity, we constructed a Cys-less P-glycoprotein-A52 for use in topology studies. Cysteine residues could then be reintroduced in the predicted cytoplasmic or extracellular loops connecting transmembrane segments of P-glycoprotein and reacted specifically with either permeant or impermeant sulfhydryl reactive compounds. Accordingly, a Cys-less mutant was constructed by simultaneously changing the codons of all cysteine residues to alanine, including those of the 2 cysteines (Cys-1288 and Cys-1304) flanking the epitope for monoclonal antibody A52. We have previously observed that mutation of the cysteine residues flanking the epitope for monoclonal antibody A52 does not affect the binding of monoclonal antibody A52 to this epitope. 2D. M. Clarke and T. W. Loo, unpublished observations. The ability of the Cys-less mutant to confer drug resistance was tested by transfecting drug-sensitive NIH 3T3 cells, followed by selection in the presence of vinblastine (5 nM) and colchicine (45 nM). Drug-resistant colonies were obtained in cells transfected with the cDNA coding for the Cys-less P-glycoprotein, whereas no drug-resistant colonies were obtained in cells transfected with vector alone. Several Cys-less clones were isolated and expanded. The ability of the Cys-less mutant to confer resistance was compared to that of wild-type P-glycoprotein-A52. As shown in Fig. 1, the Cys-less mutant had only slightly decreased relative resistance to vinblastine (0.70), colchicine (0.81), doxorubicin (0.78), and actinomycin D (0.63) relative to wild-type enzyme. These results suggest that the Cys-less mutant retains drug transport with only a small reduction in efficiency of the enzyme.The biosyntheses of wild-type and Cys-less P-glycoprotein-A52s were studied in a pulse-chase assay (Fig. 2). Newly synthesized P-glycoprotein possesses three N-linked oligosaccharide chains and migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 150 kDa on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 2, time 0). After transit through the Golgi apparatus, P-glycoprotein migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 170 kDa, reflecting processing of its N-linked oligosaccharides (Fig. 2, time 6 h). A similar pattern was observed for the Cys-less mutant. At 0 h, the Cys-less P-glycoprotein-A52 had an apparent mass of 150 kDa. By 6 h, the major labeled product had an apparent mass of 170 kDa. Two differences, however, were observed. Firstly, processing of the wild-type enzyme to the mature (170 kDa) form occurred more rapidly than that of the Cys-less mutant. One hour after labeling, approximately equal amounts of the 150-kDa and 170-kDa forms of the enzyme were present. By contrast, less than 25% of the Cys-less mutant was processed to the 170-kDa enzyme after 1 h. A second difference was that the half-life of the mature (170 kDa) Cys-less protein was about 24 h compared to 48-72 h for wild-type P-glycoprotein-A52. These differences were observed in several clones, suggesting that the differences observed were not due to variabilities in the cell lines. Apparently, mutation of all cysteines to alanine resulted in a protein which was less stable than wild-type enzyme.Figure 2:Kinetics of maturation of wild-type and Cys-less P-glycoprotein-A52. NIH 3T3 cells expressing wild-type or Cys-less P-glycoprotein-A52 were pulse-labeled with [ 35 35 S]Met and [ 35 35 S]Cys for 20 min at 37°C and chased at the same temperature for 0-24 h. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody A52 and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. 170 and 150 indicate the positions of the mature and core-glycosylated forms of P-glycoprotein-A52, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Topology StudiesThe construction of a functional P-glycoprotein devoid of cysteine residues provided the basis of an approach to study the topology of the molecule. Using the cDNA coding for Cys-less P-glycoprotein-A52, we changed individual amino acids in the predicted cytoplasmic or extracellular loops to cysteine, which were then reacted with either membrane-permeant or impermeant sulfhydryl reagents in intact cells to determine their sidedness. The results of this approach are only valid if it can be shown that the mutants retain their native structure. The best assay for native structure is retention of function. Accordingly, we introduced cysteine residues into the cDNA of Cys-less P-glycoprotein-A52 and tested the ability of the mutant proteins to confer drug resistance in transfected cells (Table 1). Fifteen of the 19 cysteine mutant cDNAs yielded P-glycoproteins of apparent mass 170 kDa that conferred resistance to vinblastine and colchicine. No drug-resistant clones were obtained after transfection with mutants Lys-272 → Cys, Ser-795 → Cys, Asn-809 → Cys, or Tyr-853 → Cys. All of these mutations were found to affect biosynthesis of P-glycoprotein, since the major product in these mutants was a protein of apparent mass 150 kDa, when their cDNAs were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells (data not shown). By contrast, all of the active mutants yielded a protein of apparent mass 170 kDa as the major product after transient transfection (data not shown).Tabled 1The location of cysteine residues that were reintroduced in P-glycoprotein is shown in Fig. 3. Cysteine residues in the predicted extracellular loops should be accessible to membrane-impermeant thiol-specific reagents in intact cells. The cysteine residue of mutant Pro-745 → Cys should be extracellular, since the epitope for monoclonal antibody MRK-16, which binds to an extracellular domain of P-glycoprotein, has been shown to consist of the region surrounding Pro-745, as well as residues between TM1 and TM2 (Georges et al., 1993). Similarly, Schinkel et al.(1993) showed that all three glycosylation sites in P-glycoprotein lie between predicted transmembrane segments TM1 and TM2, indicating that this region is exposed on the cell surface. Intact cells expressing mutant Pro-745 → Cys or Cys-less P-glycoprotein-A52 were incubated with various concentrations of biotin maleimide (3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin), which is a thiol-specific compound (Bayer et al., 1985). The maleimide compounds react specifically with thiol groups in P-glycoprotein-A52 since we were not able to detect reaction of N-[3H]ethylmaleimide with the Cys-less mutant of P-glycoprotein-A52 (data not shown). Cells treated with biotin maleimide were solubilized and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody A52. Fig. 4 shows an immunoblot of the immunoprecipitated proteins developed with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase and chemiluminescence. Labeling of mutant Pro-745 → Cys was detected after treatment with 1 μM biotin maleimide, with maximal labeling occurring at a concentration of 10 μM. The reaction was specific, since no labeling of Cys-less P-glycoprotein-A52 was detected even when labeling was performed in the presence of 2 mM biotin maleimide. Labeling of mutant Pro-745 → Cys was also rapid as the reaction was essentially complete within 2 min (data not shown). The permeability of biotin maleimide was tested by treating cells expressing mutant Cys-1304. This mutant is devoid of cysteines except for Cys-1304, which flanks the epitope for monoclonal antibody A52. This cysteine residue is at the COOH-terminal end of the second nucleotide-binding domain, and faces the cytoplasm (Yoshimura et al., 1989). In an immunohistochemical study, we found that reaction of monoclonal antibody A52 with P-glycoprotein-A52 requires permeabilization of cells,2 suggesting that the epitope for monoclonal antibody is located in the cytoplasm. As shown in Fig. 4, substantial labeling of the mutant P-glycoprotein occurred when the cells were incubated in the presence of 1 mM biotin maleimide. This result suggests that biotin maleimide can cross the membrane and label internal cysteines when used at a relatively high concentration.Figure 3:Location of introduced cysteines in the predicted structural model of P-glycoprotein. The model is that proposed by Juranka et al.(1989) and Gottesman and Pastan (1988). The positions of the introduced cysteine residues are indicated by largecircles.

The cells were washed with PBSCM containing 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, solubilized, and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody A52.

It possesses two charged sulfonate groups, but unlike biotin maleimide, which must first be dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, it is freely soluble in water. When cells expressing mutants Pro-745 → ∗ Cys or Cys-1304 were treated with stilbenedisulfonate maleimide before incubation with biotin maleimide, biotinylation of only mutant Pro-745 → Cys was blocked (Fig. 5). These results are consistent with Pro-745 being located on the extracellular surface, since it is rapidly biotinylated in the presence of low concentrations of biotin maleimide and biotinylation is blocked when the cells are preincubated with membrane-impermeant stilbenedisulfonate maleimide. By contrast, biotinylation of mutant Cys-1304 required a relatively higher concentration (200 μM) of biotin maleimide and biotinylation was not blocked by the membrane-impermeant maleimide (Fig. 5). These properties suggest that Cys-1304 is located in the cytoplasm. To confirm that these properties indicate a cytoplasmic orientation, labeling was carried out on SERCA1 Ca 2+ -ATPase which is found in the endoplasmic reticulum in transfected cells (Maruyama et al., 1989), with its nucleotide-binding domain (containing 13 cysteine residues) facing the cytoplasm. As shown in Fig. 5, the labeling of Ca 2+ -ATPase was similar to that of mutant Cys-1304, in that biotinylation only occurred at a relatively high concentration (>100 μM) of biotin maleimide and was not blocked by pretreatment of the cells with stilbenedisulfonate maleimide.Figure 5:Inhibition of biotinylation with stilbenedisulfonate maleimide. NIH 3T3 cells expressing mutant Pro-745 → Cys were incubated in the absence(-) or presence (+) of 20 μM stilbenedisulfonate maleimide for 5 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBSCM, and then incubated for 5 min with PBSCM containing 20 μM biotin maleimide. Cells expressing Cys-1304 or SERCA1 Ca 2+ -ATPase were incubated in the absence(-) or presence (+) of 200 μM stilbenedisulfonate maleimide for 30 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBSCM, and then incubated with PBSCM containing 200 μM biotin maleimide for 30 min. Biotinylated P-glycoprotein-A52 was detected as described in Fig. 4.

In these cases, the mutants were expressed transiently in HEK 293 cells. In this expression system, transfected cells yield a high level of core-glycosylated P-glycoprotein (150 kDa), located in the endoplasmic reticulum, as well as mature P-glycoprotein (170 kDa) (Loo and Clarke, 1994a). This enabled us to examine the labeling pattern of P-glycoprotein located intracellularly (150 kDa) as well as the mature form (170 kDa) located in the plasma membrane. Labeling was first carried out using a low concentration of biotin maleimide (20 μM) and a relatively short incubation period (5 min): conditions that favor biotinylation of extracellular thiol groups. As shown in Fig. 6(panelB), biotinylation of the mature 170-kDa form of P-glycoprotein was observed for mutants Gly-324 → Cys, Pro-745 → Cys, and Lys-967 → Cys. These results are consistent with the predicted location of these residues on the extracellular surface (Fig. 3). Labeling was then carried out at a relatively high concentration (200 μM) of biotin maleimide and for a longer period (30 min). Under these conditions, both the 150-kDa and 170-kDa forms of P-glycoprotein of mutants Thr-173 → Cys, Asn-280 → Cys, Ser-831 → Cys, Ser-931 → Cys, and Cys-1304 were biotinylated. By contrast, only the mature 170-kDa form of mutants Gly-324 → Cys, Pro-745 → Cys, and Lys-967 → Cys were labeled (Fig. 6, panel C). This difference can be explained on the basis of their location inside or outside the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum during biosynthesis of the 150-kDa intermediate. Cysteine residues that are predicted to reside on the extracellular surface would be located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum during biosynthesis, while those predicted to be eventually intracellular would also be exposed to the cytoplasm in the core-glycosylated intermediate. Since the cysteine residues of mutants Thr-173 → Cys, Asn-280 → Cys, Ser-831 → Cys, Ser-931 → Cys, and Cys-1304 are predicted to be intracellular in the mature enzyme, both 150-kDa and 170-kDa forms of the enzyme would be expected to be labeled and not blocked by pretreatment with stilbenedisulfonate maleimide (Fig. 6, panelD). On the other hand, the cysteine residues in the mature form (170 kDa) of mutants Gly-324 → Cys, Pro-745 → Cys, and Lys-967 → Cys are predicted to be extracellular and, therefore, would be expected to be found within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum in the 150-kDa form of the enzyme. Therefore, labeling of these cysteine residues would require the probe to traverse two membranes, resulting in only a minor amount of the enzyme (150 kDa) being labeled. Biotinylation of the 150-kDa form of the enzyme of these mutants required the use of even higher concentrations (2 mM) of biotin maleimide (data not shown). Consistent with the interpretation that the cysteine residue of mutants Gly-324 → Cys, Pro-745 → Cys, and Lys-967 → Cys are located on the extracellular surface (and within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum) was the finding that biotinylation of the mature P-glycoprotein was blocked by pretreatment with membrane-impermeant stilbenedisulfonate maleimide (Fig. 6, panel D).Figure 6:Labeling of active P-glycoprotein Cys mutants. HEK 293 cells were transfected with cDNAs coding for Cys-less P-glycoproteins containing introduced cysteine residues. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were washed three times with PBSCM and then incubated for 5 min in the presence of 20 μM biotin maleimide (panelB) or for 30 min in the presence of 200 μM biotin maleimide before (panelC) or after preincubation (panel D) for 30 min in the presence of 200 μM stilbenedisulfonate maleimide. The cells were washed with PBSCM containing 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, solubilized, and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody A52. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose, and biotinylated P-glycoprotein-A52 was detected using streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase and chemiluminescence. A sample of whole cell lysate was also subjected to immunoblot analysis with monoclonal antibody A52 and horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody, followed by chemiluminescence (panel A). 170 and 150 indicate the positions of the mature and core-glycosylated forms of P-glycoprotein-A52, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Biotinylation of the cysteine residue of mutants Thr-209 → Cys, Gly-211 → Cys, Thr-215 → Cys, Ser-238 → Cys, Ser-850 → Cys, Gly-854 → Cys, or Trp-855 → Cys was not detected, suggesting that these cysteine residues were likely inaccessible. Six of the inaccessible cysteines, located at positions 209, 211, 215, 850, 854, and 855, were predicted to lie on the extracellular surface between TM3 and TM4 or TM9 and TM10, while Cys-238, located between TM3 and TM4, is predicted to be cytoplasmic. The loops connecting segments TM3 and TM4, and TM9 and TM10 are predicted to be short, consisting of 6 and 1 amino acids, respectively. Therefore, there may be little or no protrusion of these loops into the extracellular space, thus preventing reaction of the cysteine residues in these locations (positions 209, 211, 215, 850, 854, and 855) with biotin maleimide. We were, however, able to biotinylate the cysteine residues in these positions (including Cys-238) after denaturation with SDS (data not shown).DISCUSSIONThe results in this study show that a mutant P-glycoprotein, which is devoid of cysteine residues, retains the ability to confer resistance to cytotoxic drugs. Apparently, none of the cysteines play a direct role in the mechanism of drug transport. These results suggest that inactivation of P-glycoprotein by thiol-specific reagents such as N-ethylmaleimide (Al-Shawi et al., 1994) is probably due to the introduction of one or more bulky groups into the molecule, rather than due to the removal of a critical sulfhydryl group. Cysteines, however, do appear to contribute to folding and stability of P-glycoprotein. Maturation of the Cys-less P-glycoprotein was slower than wild-type enzyme, and the relative half-life of the mature mutant enzyme was shorter than that of wild-type enzyme.The Cys-less mutant of P-glycoprotein was used to study the topology of the protein in the membrane. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to reintroduce cysteine residues into the loops between the transmembrane segments of the cysteine-less P-glycoprotein, which were then probed with membrane-permeant or impermeant thiol-specific reagents. The advantage of this approach is that the assays are performed on functional molecules in intact cells. Using this approach, we found that the regions between predicted transmembrane segments TM5 and TM6, TM7 and TM8, and TM11 and TM12 to be extracytoplasmic, as predicted in the current model of P-glycoprotein (Fig. 3).The loops between transmembrane segments TM3 and TM4, as well as TM9 and TM10 are predicted to be extracellular (Fig. 3). Introduction of cysteine residues into these loops, however, resulted in no detectable biotinylation. These loops are predicted to be short (6 amino acids and 1 amino acid, respectively) and may not protrude significantly above the lipid bilayer, thereby making them sterically inaccessible to labeling with biotin maleimide. Recently, Skach and Lingappa(1994) showed that the region between transmembrane segment TM3 and TM4 of human P-glycoprotein is indeed extracellular. They investigated the topology of TM3 and TM4 using protease protection of a defined reporter epitope, which was expressed as a fusion protein with segments of MDR1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes. They found that TM3 and TM4 spanned the membrane in the orientation predicted by the hydropathy-based model (Fig. 3).Cysteine residues introduced into predicted cytoplasmic loops between transmembrane segments TM2 and TM3 (Thr-173 → Cys), TM4 and TM5 (Asn-280 → Cys), TM8 and TM9 (Ser-831 → Cys), and TM11 and TM12 (Ser-931 → Cys) exhibited labeling properties consistent with this location. Labeling of these cysteine residues (as well as Cys-1304 in the COOH terminus of the nucleotide binding domain) required relatively high concentrations (200 μM) of biotin maleimide and longer incubation periods (30 min). Consistent with their cytoplasmic location was the finding that biotinylation of these residues was not blocked by pretreatment with membrane-impermeant maleimide.Our results suggest that the region between predicted transmembrane TM8 and TM9 is cytoplasmic. This is in contrast to the results of Skach et al.(1993). Again, using fusion proteins expressed in Xenopus oocytes and a cell-free translation system, they found that the region between TM8 and TM9 resides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (extracytosolic), and that Asn-809 (within predicted TM8 and TM9) was glycosylated. This is in contrast to our findings that the region between TM8 and TM9 (Ser-831 → Cys) is in the cytoplasm and that the COOH-terminal half of the molecule is not glycosylated. In a previous study (Loo and Clarke, 1994b), we showed that expression of the COOH-terminal half of P-glycoprotein as a separate polypeptide in NIH 3T3, HEK 293, or insect Sf9 cells results in a functional molecule which is not glycosylated. The absence of glycosylation in this region has also been demonstrated in a photolabeling study on MDR1 expressed in mammalian cells (Bruggemann et al., 1989). Glycosylation of the COOH-terminal half of P-glycoprotein, however, was also observed when expression was carried out in a cell-free system (Zhang and Ling, 1991). These discrepancies may reflect differences between in vivo and in vitro expression of P-glycoprotein. It is also possible that truncations and additions of a passenger domain to P-glycoprotein in the study by Skach et al.(1993) could result in misfolding of the the molecule. Biosynthesis and maturation of P-glycoprotein can be particularly sensitive to even single amino acid changes in the predicted cytoplasmic loops (Loo and Clarke, 1994a). The segment of amino acids encompassing TM7 to TM9 is particularly sensitive to perturbations. Mutations to 9 residues within or immediately NH2-terminal to TM7 (Loo and Clarke, 1994c) and to 10 of 27 residues between TM8 and TM92 result in the synthesis of only 150-kDa core-glycosylated P-glycoprotein, which is trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum. These mutants may be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum due to misfolding.This study shows that a cysteine-less mutant can be a useful tool for studying the topology of P-glycoprotein and may be a useful approach for studying the topology of other membrane proteins. Cysteine-less mutants could also be used to study the static and dynamic aspects of structure and function of membrane-bound proteins as proposed by van Iwaarden et al.(1991). Single Cys mutants can be tagged with reactive spin labels or fluorescent probes after purification and studied spectroscopically after reconstitution into lipid bilayers. Distances between extracellular loops could be estimated by using thiol-specific cross-linkers of various lengths. We are currently using these approaches to gain insight into the structure-function relationships of human P-glycoprotein. INTRODUCTIONP-glycoprotein is a 170-kDa plasma membrane glycoprotein that is responsible for the phenomenon of multidrug resistance in mammalian cells (see reviews by Roninson(1991) and Gottesman and Pastan(1993)). The protein confers resistance to a broad range of cytotoxic agents that do not have a common structure or intracellular target; examples include anticancer drugs such as vinblastine and doxorubicin, antimicrotubule drugs such as colchicine and podophyllotoxin, and toxic peptides such as valinomycin and gramicidin D.Human P-glycoprotein, encoded by the MDR1 1The abbreviations used are: MDRmultidrug resistancePBSphosphate-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTMtransmembrane segmentbiotin maleimide3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytinstilbenedisulfonate maleimide4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acidSERCAsarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPase. gene, consists of 1280 amino acids organized in two tandem repeats of 610 amino acids, joined by a linker region of 60 amino acids. Each repeat consists of an NH2-terminal hydrophobic domain containing six potential transmembrane sequences followed by a hydrophilic domain containing a nucleotide binding site. The amino acid sequence and domain organization of the protein is typical of the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) superfamily of transporters (Hyde et al., 1990).Al-Shawi et al.(1994) showed that ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein is inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide. Maximal inactivation coincided with labeling at two sites, with approximately equal distribution of label between the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal halves of the molecule. ATP prevented the inactivation of P-glycoprotein by N-ethylmaleimide. These results suggest that there is a critical sulfhydryl residue within each catalytic site. They predicted that the critical cysteines were located in the homology A sequences (GNSGCGKS and GSSGCGKS, respectively; Walker et al.(1982)) in the two predicted nucleotide binding domains of Chinese hamster P-glycoprotein.In this study, we tested whether any of the cysteines, including those in the homology A regions, were critical for function by constructing a P-glycoprotein devoid of cysteines. The Cys-less P-glycoprotein retained the ability to confer resistance to cytotoxic agents. This finding provided the basis for an approach to studying the topology of P-glycoprotein. Our approach was to introduce cysteine residues into putative extracellular or cytoplasmic loops of Cys-less P-glycoprotein, followed by chemical modification with membrane-permeant or impermeant thiol-specific probes to determine their sidedness. We show that the pattern of labeling of the cysteine residues is consistent with a model which predicts that P-glycoprotein contains 12 transmembrane segments."

This problem was circumvented by detecting DNA looping by the lactose repressor protein of Escherichia coli in single DNA molecules. The looping was detected by monitoring the nanometer-scale Brownian motion of microscopic particles linked to the ends of individual DNA molecules. This allowed the determination of the rates of formation and breakdown of a protein-mediated DNA loop in vitro. The measurements reveal that mechanical strain stored in the loop does not substantially accelerate loop breakdown, and the measurements also show that subunit dissociation of tetrameric repressor is not the predominant loop breakdown pathway."

Three protein tyrosine kinases that have been implicated as being involved in this early phase of TCR-mediated signaling are the Src-family members Fyn and Lck and the Syk-family member ZAP-70. The evidence for the involvement of these protein tyrosine kinases in TCR signaling has been extensively reviewed (16Samelson L.E. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24913-24916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar, 18Isakov N. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Recently it was shown that Lck and ZAP-70 can act sequentially to tyrosine phosphorylate various substrates in COS cells transfected with Lck, ZAP-70, and a CD8 ζ chimeric protein (19Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In this system, Lck is required to tyrosine phosphorylate the TAMs of CD8 ζ which permits ZAP-70 binding. Upon association with CD8 ζ , ZAP-70 is tyrosine-phosphorylated, becomes activated, and induces tyrosine phosphorylation of substrates. One would predict from such a model that agents that block the association of ZAP-70 with the TCR could prove useful in identifying the downstream effectors of ZAP-70 and in blocking T cell activation. Recent insights into the mechanism of the association of ZAP-70 with the TCR provide the basis for the design of such inhibitory agents.Src-homology 2 (SH2) domains mediate protein-protein interactions by binding to pTyr-containing sequences(20Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Rotnosfsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C.

The presence of two SH2 domains in ZAP-70 and 2 pTyr residues in stimulated TCR TAMs suggested a possible mechanism of interaction. Experiments using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing the SH2 domains of ZAP-70 show that ZAP-70 binds to the tyrosine-phosphorylated TCR ζ and CD3 ε chains via its SH2 domains; both SH2 domains are required for high affinity binding(22Wange R.L. Malek S.N. Desiderio S. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19797-19801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That the TCR TAM motifs mediate this interaction was demonstrated in studies showing binding of ZAP-70 to transmembrane chimeric receptors with a single ζ chain TAM as the cytoplasmic tail(3Irving B.A. Chan A.C. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that a novel phosphatase-resistant synthetic peptide based on the C-terminal (pTyr)2-TAM of the TCR ζ chain competitively blocks ZAP-70 binding to activated TCR. As a consequence, TCR stimulation fails to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70 or activation of its kinase activity. Coincident with this loss of ZAP-70 kinase activity is reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of substrates. This result suggests that the peptide blocks early TCR-mediated signaling events through a ZAP-70 dependent mechanism, as would be predicted by the model of early activation events mentioned above.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells, Antibodies, and Miscellaneous ReagentsJurkat T cells were cultured as described previously(23Wange R.L.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5886-5893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the peptides were synthesized with a phosphotyrosyl analog that is resistant to hydrolysis. In this analog, difluorophosphonomethyl phenylalanine (F2Pmp), a difluoromethylene group replaces the phenolic oxygen of phosphotyrosine (24Burke Jr., T.R Smyth M.S. Otaka A. Roller P.P. Tetrahedron Lett. 1993; 34: 4125-4128Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Smyth M.S. Burke Jr., T.R. Tetrahedron Lett. 1994; 35: 551-553Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In previous studies, F2Pmp- and pTyr-containing hexapeptides have been shown to bind their complementary SH2 domains with similar affinities(34Burke Jr., T.R. Smyth M.S. Otaka A. Nomizu M. Roller P.P. Wolf G. Case R. Shoelson S.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6490-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Four different F2Pmp-containing peptides were synthesized based on the sequence LYQGLSTATKDTYDALH, which is the C-terminal (third) TAM of the human TCR ζ chain. The peptide in which both Tyr residues are replaced with F2Pmp groups is referred to as (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3, while peptides in which either the N- or C-terminal Tyr is replaced with F2Pmp are (F2Pmp)N-TAM ζ or (F2Pmp)C-TAM ζ3, respectively. The fourth peptide is a control in which the phosphonate oxygens of (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 remain blocked with ethoxy groups from the synthesis.The ability of these synthetic peptides to bind to ZAP-70 was assessed in competition binding studies with a synthetic 32 P-labeled (pTyr)2-TAM ζ3 peptide that binds a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing both SH2 domains of ZAP-70 (Fig. 1). Only those peptides containing two pTyr or F2Pmp groups competed for binding. The ether-blocked control peptide did not compete. No peptide binding was observed to glutathione S-transferase alone or fusion proteins containing a single C- or N-terminal ZAP-70 SH2 domain (not shown). (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 bound the tandem SH2 domains of ZAP-70 with an affinity similar to the (pTyr)2-TAM ζ3 itself. A higher concentration of cold (pTyr)2-TAM ζ3 (1 μM) was required to give 50% competition of 4 nM 32 P-labeled (pTyr)2-TAM ζ3. This disparity reflects the fact that the effective concentration of the binding site, glutathione/agarose-adsorbed glutathione S-transferase-ZAP-70-(SH2)2, is much higher than that of the labeled peptide. The excess of binding sites over ligand in this assay precludes the determination of absolute affinities from the IC50 values, but these values remain useful in deriving relative affinities(35Isakov N. Wange R.L. Burgess W.H. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Samelson L.E. J. Exp. Med. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In additional binding studies, (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 cross-competed with (pTyr)2-TAM ζ1, (pTyr)2-TAM ζ2, and (pTyr)2-TAM ε indicating that ZAP-70 binding to all TCR ζ and CD3 ε TAMs can be inhibited by (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3.2Having found that (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 could bind ZAP-70 in vitro, the ability of (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 to bind ZAP-70 and block its association with TCR was tested in Jurkat T cells permeabilized with the bacterial toxin tetanolysin. The TCR from peptide-treated permeabilized Jurkat T cells was immunoprecipitated and examined for associated ZAP-70, as detected by anti-ZAP-70 or anti-pTyr blotting (Fig. 2A). As demonstrated previously, ZAP-70 bound the TCR only upon TCR stimulation(9Chan A.C. Irving B.A. Fraser J.D. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9166-9170Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 23Wange R.L. Kong A.N. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11685-11688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The association of ZAP-70 with TCR was markedly inhibited by (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3, but not by the ether-blocked control peptide or the singly F2Pmp-substituted peptides. The ZAP-70 co-precipitated with TCR was tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 2A). In addition, co-recovery of phospho- ζ or phospho- ε with ZAP-70 immunoprecipitates was also inhibited by (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 (not shown). (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 could be acting to block co-recovery of ZAP-70 with TCR either by blocking initial TCR-stimulated binding or by competing after cell lysis. To test the latter possibility, the peptide was added after termination of TCR stimulation, such that the peptide could not block initial assembly, but could compete with the TCR for ZAP-70 during immunoprecipitation. Only a minimal reduction in ZAP-70 co-recovery with the TCR was observed, suggesting that the major effect of (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 is to block initial assembly of ZAP-70 with the TCR (not shown).Figure 2:(F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 inhibition of TCR-stimulated ZAP-70/TCR association and ZAP-70 tyrosine phosphorylation. A, TCR was immunoprecipitated from unstimulated(-) or TCR-stimulated (+) tetanolysin-permeabilized Jurkat T cells incubated with 4 μM concentrations of the indicated peptides. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed for co-precipitating ZAP-70 with a mAb to pTyr (4G10) (upper panel) or a polyclonal antiserum to ZAP-70 (lower panel). B, ZAP-70 was immunoprecipitated from intact Jurkat T cells and Jurkat T cells treated as in A. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed for ZAP-70 with 4G10 (upper panel) or a polyclonal antiserum to ZAP-70 (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Recent studies would predict that inhibition of ZAP-70 association with the TCR would reduce TCR-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70 (19Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). To test this prediction, anti-ZAP-70 immunoprecipitates from permeabilized Jurkat T cells, incubated with (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3, were blotted for pTyr (Fig. 2B). (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 blocked the TCR-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of total ZAP-70, while the control peptide and the singly F2Pmp-substituted peptides did not. The amount of ZAP-70 immunoprecipitated was the same in each lane as shown in the anti-ZAP-70 blot of a replicate gel (Fig. 2B). The same effect of (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 on ZAP-70 tyrosine phosphorylation was also seen in anti-pTyr blots of whole cell lysates from peptide-treated permeable Jurkat cells (see Fig. 4A). The inhibitory effect of (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 on ZAP-70 tyrosine phosphorylation is not mediated by activation of a PTPase activity, since this effect is unaffected by orthovanadate (not shown).Figure 4:(F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of Jurkat T cell substrates. A, whole cell lysates were collected from unstimulated(-) or TCR-stimulated (+) tetanolysin-permeabilized Jurkat T cells incubated without added peptide(-), with control peptide (C), or with (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 (T). Lysates were also collected from unstimulated(-) or TCR-stimulated (+) intact Jurkat T cells. Lysates were analyzed for pTyr-containing proteins by immunoblotting with 4G10. The arrowhead indicates the position of ZAP-70. The arrow shows the position of TCR chains.

TCR subunits were analyzed for pTyr by 4G10 immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The effect of (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 incubation on ZAP-70 kinase activity was determined in an immune complex kinase assay. Since no substrates of the ZAP-70 kinase have yet been identified, we used a cytosolic fragment of the erythrocyte band 3 protein (cfb3) as a substrate in the kinase assay(36Wang C.C. Badylak J.A. Lux S.E. Moriyama R. Dixon J.E. Low P.S. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1206-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). cfb3 is known to be a substrate for the related protein tyrosine kinase, Syk(37Harrison M.L. Isaacson C.C. Burg D.L. Geahlen R.L. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 955-959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ZAP-70 was immunoprecipitated from lysates of intact or permeabilized cells incubated with and without (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3. The immune complex kinase assay was carried out on a portion of the immunoprecipitated ZAP-70, while the remainder was analyzed for the pTyr content of ZAP-70 by anti-pTyr blotting (Fig. 3, upper and middle panels, respectively). Stimulation of the TCR by mAb ligation increased the kinase activity associated with ZAP-70, as reflected in increased phosphorylation of cfb3 and ZAP-70 itself. The predominant kinase activity associated with the ZAP-70 immunoprecipitate is ZAP-70 itself, although other kinases that associate with either ZAP-70 or phospho- ζ could also contribute activity in this assay. Two kinases that would be most likely to co-precipitate with ZAP-70 or associated molecules are Lck and Syk(38Duplay P. Thome M. Herve F. Acuto O. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 39Couture C. Baier G. Altman A. Mustelin T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 4758-4766PubMed Google Scholar); however, neither Lck activity nor Syk protein is detected in the ZAP-70 immunoprecipitates2(41Burkhardt A.L. Stealey B. Rowley R.B. Mahajan S. Pendergast M. Fargnoli J. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23642-23647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the kinase activity observed is predominantly due to ZAP-70. Incubation of permeabilized Jurkat with (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 reduced the kinase activity of ZAP-70 to the level observed in unstimulated intact cells, while control peptide had no effect. The level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the ZAP-70 used in the kinase assay shows that the basal kinase activity is associated with nonphosphorylated ZAP-70, while increased kinase activity is associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated ZAP-70 (Fig. 3, middle panel). The amount of ZAP-70 in each lane was the same, as is shown by anti-ZAP-70 blotting (lower panel). The actual mechanism of ZAP-70 tyrosine phosphorylation remains to be determined, and, while ZAP-70 activation coincides with both TCR binding and tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70, it is still unclear which, if either, of these events activates the kinase.Figure 3:(F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 inhibition of TCR-stimulated ZAP-70 kinase activity. ZAP-70 was immunoprecipitated from TCR-stimulated (+), tetanolysin-permeabilized Jurkat T cells incubated without peptide, or with either the (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 (T) or the ether-blocked control peptide (C). For comparison, ZAP-70 was also immunoprecipitated from unstimulated(-) or TCR-stimulated (+) intact Jurkat T cells. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed for in vitro kinase activity (upper panel). A portion of the immunoprecipitates were analyzed for tyrosine-phosphorylated ZAP-70 by 4G10 immunoblotting (middle panel). The relative amount of ZAP-70 in each immunoprecipitate was analyzed by immunoblotting the nitrocellulose membrane from the kinase assay (upper panel) with a polyclonal antiserum to ZAP-70 (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The results show a direct correlation between (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3-induced inhibition of ZAP-70 association with activated TCR, loss of tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70, and loss of TCR-stimulated ZAP-70 kinase activity. These findings are consistent with a model whereby (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ binds to ZAP-70, occupies the tandem SH2 domains of ZAP-70, and thereby prevents ZAP-70 association with tyrosine-phosphorylated TCR. Inhibition of ZAP-70 binding to the TCR then prevents tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of ZAP-70. An alternate model in which (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 binds to Lck, prevents Lck from tyrosine-phosphorylating the TCR, and thus prevents association of ZAP-70 with the TCR, is unlikely, since Lck does not bind a synthetic peptide with a similar structure to (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3(19Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Also, elimination of the binding capacity of the SH2 domain of Lck by mutation does not affect its ability to tyrosine-phosphorylate ζ or ZAP-70(19Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In addition, the F2Pmp-containing peptides have no effect on Lck kinase activity toward a synthetic peptide, containing residues 52-164 of the cytoplasmic tail of ζ in an in vitro kinase assay2(27Watts J.D. Wilson G.M. Ettenhadieh E. Clark-Lewis I. Kubanek C.A. Astell C.R. Marth J.D. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 901-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).To determine whether (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3-mediated inhibition of ZAP-70 association with the TCR had an effect on TCR-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Jurkat T cell substrates, lysates from Jurkat T cells were treated as indicated in Fig. 4 and blotted for pTyr. In intact cells there was a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of many proteins in response to mAb stimulation of the TCR. Although tetanolysin permeabilization, itself, caused increased tyrosine phosphorylation of some proteins, stimulation of the TCR in the permeabilized cells caused a further increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. Addition of (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins, while control peptide had no effect. As was seen in Fig. 2B, the (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 peptide almost completely blocked tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70. Several other unidentified proteins with molecular masses of 120, 80, and 35-40 kDa showed reduced tyrosine phosphorylation after incubation with (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3. The identification of these phosphoproteins, which might be ZAP-70 substrates, and the effect of (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 on distal signaling molecules in viable T cells are the subjects of continuing investigation. Jurkat T cells have recently been shown to contain the protein tyrosine kinase Syk(40Chan A.C. van Oers N.S.C. Tran A. Turka L. Law C.-L. Ryan J.C. Clark E.A. Weiss A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4758-4766PubMed Google Scholar, 41Burkhardt A.L. Stealey B. Rowley R.B. Mahajan S. Pendergast M. Fargnoli J. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23642-23647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells, Syk is recruited to phospho- ζ concurrently with ZAP-70(41Burkhardt A.L. Stealey B. Rowley R.B. Mahajan S.

Thus, it remains formally possible that part of the effect of (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 on substrate phosphorylation may be due to the blockade of Syk association with the TCR.Tyrosine phosphorylation of ζ and CD3 ε receptor chains was also decreased in (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3-treated Jurkat T cells (Fig. 4A). If our model of (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 action is correct, then reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of ζ and CD3 ε is not likely to be due to reduced kinase activity, as ZAP-70 exhibits no activity for TCR subunits, and (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 fails to block Lck activity2(19Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). One possibility to explain the decreased TCR tyrosine phosphorylation is that (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ could increase the effective PTPase activity toward the TCR by blocking the ability of ZAP-70 to bind to and protect the TAM pTyr residues from dephosphorylation(19Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism has been demonstrated for phospholipase C γ 1 binding to the epidermal growth factor receptor(42Rotin D. Margolis B. Mohammadi M. Daly R.J. Daum G. Li N. Fischer E.H. Burgess W.H. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, the TCR was immunoprecipitated from peptide-treated Jurkat T cells in the presence or absence of orthovanadate during TCR stimulation and analyzed by anti-pTyr blotting (Fig. 4B). Orthovanadate increased the overall pTyr signal, but also inhibited the ability of the (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 peptide to reduce tyrosine phosphorylation of ζ and CD3 ε . This suggests that, in the absence of orthovanadate, the TAMs are tyrosine-phosphorylated normally, but are dephosphorylated rapidly in the absence of ZAP-70 binding. Orthovanadate did not block the (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3-mediated reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of other substrates (not shown). Therefore, we favor the interpretation that the principle action of (F2Pmp)2-TAM ζ3 is to bind to ZAP-70 and block its association with the TCR. Failure of ZAP-70 binding to the TCR blocks the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of ZAP-70 and results in reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates.The ability to target and disrupt specific phosphoprotein-SH2 domain interactions holds tremendous potential in the development of reagents to aid in further analysis of signaling pathways and, perhaps more importantly, in the development of rationally designed chemotherapeutic agents, which could see application as novel immunosuppressive or antineoplastic drugs(43Brugge J.S. Science. 1993; 260: 918-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These studies represent a significant step toward this goal and demonstrate that synthetic PTPase-resistant phosphotyrosyl analog-containing peptides, based on SH2 domain binding sequences, can be successfully introduced into cellular systems to disrupt signaling pathways. INTRODUCTIONThe T cell-mediated immune response depends upon the ability of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) 1The abbreviations used are: TCRT cell antigen receptorTAMtyrosine-based activation motifPTPaseprotein tyrosine phosphataseF2Pmpdifluorophosphonomethyl phenylalanineSH2Src-homology 2pTyrphosphotyrosinemAbmonoclonal antibodycfb3cytosolic fragment of erythrocyte band 3. to recognize specific antigen and respond by initiating an intracellular signaling cascade. The α and β chains of the multisubunit TCR determine the antigen specificity of the TCR, while the γ , δ , and ε CD3 chains and the TCR ζ chain are coupled to intracellular signaling molecules. A number of studies have demonstrated the importance of a short amino acid sequence, present as three copies in the cytoplasmic domain of the TCR ζ chain and as a single copy in each of the CD3 chains, for initiating T cell signaling(1Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Science. 1992; 255: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 2Romeo C. Amiot M. Seed B.

This sequence has many descriptive names including the tyrosine-based activation motif (TAM) and has the general structure YXX(L/I)X (6-8) YXX(L/I) (4Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). In chimeric receptor cross-linking studies, TAMs have been shown to be necessary and sufficient for initiation of T cell activation (1Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Science. 1992; 255: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 2Romeo C. Amiot M. Seed B.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3533-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Many other substrates have yet to be identified. Three protein tyrosine kinases that have been implicated as being involved in this early phase of TCR-mediated signaling are the Src-family members Fyn and Lck and the Syk-family member ZAP-70. The evidence for the involvement of these protein tyrosine kinases in TCR signaling has been extensively reviewed (16Samelson L.E. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24913-24916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar, 18Isakov N. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Recently it was shown that Lck and ZAP-70 can act sequentially to tyrosine phosphorylate various substrates in COS cells transfected with Lck, ZAP-70, and a CD8 ζ chimeric protein (19Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In this system, Lck is required to tyrosine phosphorylate the TAMs of CD8 ζ which permits ZAP-70 binding. Upon association with CD8 ζ , ZAP-70 is tyrosine-phosphorylated, becomes activated, and induces tyrosine phosphorylation of substrates. One would predict from such a model that agents that block the association of ZAP-70 with the TCR could prove useful in identifying the downstream effectors of ZAP-70 and in blocking T cell activation. Recent insights into the mechanism of the association of ZAP-70 with the TCR provide the basis for the design of such inhibitory agents.Src-homology 2 (SH2) domains mediate protein-protein interactions by binding to pTyr-containing sequences(20Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Rotnosfsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C.

The presence of two SH2 domains in ZAP-70 and 2 pTyr residues in stimulated TCR TAMs suggested a possible mechanism of interaction. Experiments using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing the SH2 domains of ZAP-70 show that ZAP-70 binds to the tyrosine-phosphorylated TCR ζ and CD3 ε chains via its SH2 domains; both SH2 domains are required for high affinity binding(22Wange R.L. Malek S.N. Desiderio S. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19797-19801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That the TCR TAM motifs mediate this interaction was demonstrated in studies showing binding of ZAP-70 to transmembrane chimeric receptors with a single ζ chain TAM as the cytoplasmic tail(3Irving B.A. Chan A.C. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that a novel phosphatase-resistant synthetic peptide based on the C-terminal (pTyr)2-TAM of the TCR ζ chain competitively blocks ZAP-70 binding to activated TCR. As a consequence, TCR stimulation fails to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70 or activation of its kinase activity. Coincident with this loss of ZAP-70 kinase activity is reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of substrates. This result suggests that the peptide blocks early TCR-mediated signaling events through a ZAP-70 dependent mechanism, as would be predicted by the model of early activation events mentioned above."

Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) 1The abbreviations used are: CAMscell adhesion moleculesICAMintercellular adhesion moleculeLFA-1lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1mAbmonoclonal antibodyPCRpolymerase chain reactionPBSphosphate-buffered salinePMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. play a key role in stabilizing and strengthening cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions. Leukocyte CAMs provide antigen-nonspecific recognition and are involved in a wide range of intercellular interactions, including those between helper T cells and antigen presenting cells, cytotoxic T cells, and natural killer cells and their targets (Springer 1990). In addition to these interleukocyte activities, CAMs are also involved in mediating leukocyte adhesion to and transmigration across vascular endothelium. cell adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 monoclonal antibody polymerase chain reaction phosphate-buffered saline phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. A key receptor-ligand interaction that contributes significant adhesion to all of these areas is the binding of the ICAMs (intercellular adhesion molecules) to their integrin ligands, most notably LFA-1 and Mac-1 (Pardi et al., 1992). The three known ICAMs (ICAM-1, −2, and −3) are all members of the immunoglobulin superfamily and have five, two, and five Ig domains, respectively (Rothlein et al., 1986; Simmons et al., 1988; Staunton et al., 1988, 1989; de Fougerolles et al., 1991, and 1993; Fawcett et al., 1992. Vazeux et al., 1992). ICAMs 1 and 3 are the most closely related. The ICAMs all bind to the leukocyte integrin LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18; αLβ2,), and ICAM-1 has been shown to bind an additional integrin Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18; αMβ2,) (Diamond et al., 1991). While the integrins are only expressed on hematopoietic cells, the ICAMs have very different expression profiles. ICAM-1 is expressed at low levels under normal conditions and is strongly up-regulated by cytokines on many cell types, including all leukocytes, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts. ICAM-2 is constitutively expressed by all leukocytes, and endothelial cells, but at low levels. ICAM-3 is constitutively highly expressed by leukocytes and appears to be inducible on vascular endothelium in certain disease states, especially in lymphomas and myelomas (Doussis-Anagnostopoulou et al., 1993). The different expression profiles support the notion that the ICAMs serve different functions and are not functionally redundant. ICAM-3 is expressed by antigen presenting cells, specifically by Langerhans cells in the skin (Acevedo et al., 1993). ICAMs 1 and 2 are either absent or expressed at very low levels on these cells. In addition, on resting T cells, ICAM-3 is the dominant ligand for LFA-1 (Campanero et al., 1993) and provides a costimulatory signal for cell proliferation (de Fougerolles et al., 1994). Recent work shows ICAM-3 to be a signal transducer. Cross-linking ICAM-3 produces a significant Ca 2+ flux and association with tyrosine kinases (Juan et al., 1994). A consequence of signaling through ICAM-3 is increased cell adhesion via integrin β1 and β2 pathways (Campanero et al., 1993; Cid et al., 1994). Thus, ICAM-3 appears to be the major ligand for LFA-1 in the primary or initiating phases of immune responses (Hernandez-Caselles et al., 1993) and plays a role in cell adhesion and signal transduction. The interaction of ICAM-1 with LFA-1 is a multistep process, involving conformational changes in the integrin, partly controlled by engagement of ligand ICAM-1 (Cabanas and Hogg 1993). LFA-1 seems to have an intrinsically low affinity for its ICAM ligands, and that affinity is increased by a series of events that can be mimicked by a number of different stimuli including: changes in bound divalent cations (Dransfield and Hogg 1989; Dransfield et al., 1992), signal transduction agonists such as phorbol esters (Dustin and Springer 1989); and a small number of mAbs that induce or stabilize conformation changes (van Kooyk et al., 1991; Landis et al., 1993). However, apart from ligand itself, the normal cellular regulators of this affinity change are not yet known. The LFA-1-binding site in ICAM-1 has been mapped to the N-terminal immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, and 2 residues, namely Glu 34 and Gln 73 , form a key part of that site (Staunton et al., 1990). Domain 1 is an Ig C2 fold, consisting of seven β strands arranged on two surfaces, an ABE face and a CC′FG face. A model of the structure of the domains 1 and 2 of ICAM-1 has been produced which places these key residues on the CC′FG face; Glu 34 is in the C-C′ loop, and Gln 73 is placed in the F to G loop (Berendt et al., 1992). These residues are conserved in ICAM-3 (Fawcett et al., 1992; Vazeux et al., 1992; de Fougerolles et al., 1993). We have previously shown that the N-terminal two Ig domains of ICAM-3 are competent to bind LFA-1 (Fawcett et al., 1992) and now report a detailed analysis of the LFA-1-binding site in ICAM-3. In addition to those residues predicted to be critical for interaction with LFA-1, we identify 2 amino acids on the F strand of D1 that are also essential components of the LFA-1-binding site. Based on this mutagenesis screen, we propose a model for domains 1 and 2 of ICAM-3 and discuss the critical area for interaction with ligand LFA-1. Anti-LFA-1 α subunit monoclonal mAb 38 has been described (Dransfield et al., 1989). Anti ICAM-3 mAbs CH3.1, CH3.2, and CH3.3 were obtained by the fusion of spleen cells from a BALB/c mouse immunized with ICAM-3(D1-D2)-Fc. Anti-ICAM-3 mAbs CAL3.1, CAL3.4, CAL3.10, CAL3.16, CAL3.38, and CAL3.41 were obtained by the fusion of spleen cells from a BALB/c mouse immunized with ICAM-3(D1-D5)-Fc (Bossy et al., 1994). Other mAbs were provided as follows: anti-CD11a MHM24, anti-CD18 MHM23, and anti-ICAM-3 mAbs KS128, BY44, and CG106 by Dr. D. Mason (Nuffield Department of Pathology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford) and anti-CD18 mAb KIM185 by Dr. M. Robinson (Celltech, Slough, United Kingdom). In adhesion assays, purified mAbs KIM185 and 38 were used at 5-10 μg/ml and other mAbs as 1/2 dilution of tissue culture supernatant final concentration. COS-7 cells were obtained from the ICRF cell bank and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% fetal calf serum. Activated T cells were expanded from peripheral blood mononuclear cells as described (Cabanas and Hogg, 1993). ICAM-1(D1-D2)-Fc and ICAM-3(D1-D2)-Fc consisting of the first two extracellular domains fused to human IgG1-Fc fragment have previously been described (Fawcett et al., 1992). ICAM-3(D1-D3)-Fc, ICAM-3(D1-D4)-Fc, and ICAM-3(D1-D5)-Fc chimeras were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of ICAM-3 cDNA and cloning into Fc expression vector pIG1 (Fawcett et al., 1992; Simmons, 1993). Primers used for PCR amplification were CDM8 forward sequencing primer 5′-CTAGAGAACCCACTGCTTAAC-3′ and 5′-AC AGATCT ACTTACCTGT GAA GCT AAA GAC CGT CAA GTT-3′ for ICAM-3(D1-D3)-Fc; CDM8 forward sequencing primer and 5′-AC AGATCT ACTTACCTGT TTT CCA TTT CAA GTG CTG GGG-3′ for ICAM-3(D1-D4)-Fc; CDM8 forward sequencing primer and 5′-AC AGATCT ACTTACCTGT GTG GGA GCT CCC AGC CTC AAT-3′ for ICAM-3(D1-D5)-Fc. The mouse-human chimera was made by PCR ligation of domain 1 of mouse ICAM-1 to human ICAM-3 domains 2-5 as an Fc chimera. Plasmid encoding ICAM-1(D1-D5)-Fc was a gift from Dr. A. Craig, Institute of Molecular Medicine, Oxford. The NCAM-Fc consisted of the entire extracellular domain (five Ig related domains and two type III fibronectin-related domains) of neural cell adhesion molecule fused to human IgG1-Fc fragment. Mutant forms of ICAM-3(D1-D2)Fc were made by a two-step PCR strategy (Higuchi, 1990). A list of mutagenic primers can be provided on request. All constructs and mutants were sequenced in their entirety. Recombinant chimeric-Fc plasmids were transiently expressed in COS cells and secreted protein purified from tissue culture supernatants with protein A-coupled Sepharose (Simmons, 1993). CD11a and CD18 cDNAs cloned into pcDNA/AMP (Invitrogen) were transiently expressed in COS cells. The cDNAs (at 5 μg/ml each) were transfected in the presence of 1 mg/ml DEAE-dextran and 100 μM chloroquine for 2-4 h at 37°C followed by a 2-min shock in PBS, 10% Me2SO. For cytofluorometric analysis, COS transfectants were lifted 72 h post-transfection in PBS, 2 mM EDTA, washed in PBS, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 4°C, stained with primary mAbs (1:10 dilution of tissue culture supernatants of anti-CD11a mAb MHM24 or anti-CD18 mAb MHM23), washed, stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, washed three times, fixed in PBS, 2% formaldehyde, and analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan. COS cell transfected with LFA-1 were routinely 15-40% positive by FACScan analysis. Immulon-3 96-well plates (Dynatech Laboratories Inc., Chantilly, VA) were precoated with 1 μg/well goat-anti-human-Fc Ig (Sigma, Poole, Dorset U.K.) overnight at 4°C, blocked with PBS, 0.4% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V, Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature, and then coated with chimeric proteins in PBS for at least 2 h at room temperature. Prior to adhesion assay at 72-h post-transfection, COS cells were labeled for 12-24 h with 3[H]thymidine at 10 μCi/2 × 107 cells and harvested prior to the assay with PBS, 2 mM EDTA. Cells were washed twice in assay medium, consisting of RPMI, 2.5% fetal calf serum. Stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma) was performed by addition of PMA to 50 ng/ml (80 nM), incubation for 30 min at 37°C, and then removal by washing in assay buffer. Cells were added to ICAM-Fc plates to give 3 × 104/well in a final volume of 50 μl. Cells were preincubated on ice for 20 min in the presence of antibodies as appropriate, followed by a further 30-min incubation at 37°C. Cells that remained bound after two washes with prewarmed RPMI were lysed in 1% SDS, scintillant added (Ready Safe, Beckman), and incorporated radioactivity counted using a Beckman LS 5000 CE counter. The percent of LFA-1-positive cells was calculated from the incorporated radioactivity by taking into account the total cell input and the transfection efficiency. Immulon-3 96-well plates were precoated with 1 μg/well goat-anti human-Fc Ig overnight at 4°C, blocked with PBS, 0.4% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V, Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature, and then coated with chimeric proteins (5 μg/ml) in PBS for at least 2 h at room temperature. Antibody was added in saturating amounts as either neat supernatant or appropriately diluted ascitic fluid, followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (1:500 dilution, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Each layer was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and followed by six washes. The assay was visualized with O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) and absorbance read at 450 nm. In order to dissect the interaction of ICAM-3 with the leukocyte integrin LFA-1, the experimental system involved quantitative binding assays of LFA-1 + cells to soluble recombinant fusion proteins. Previous work has established that LFA-1 + leukocytes bind to an ICAM-3-Fc chimeric protein containing only the N-terminal two domains of ICAM-3 (Fawcett et al., 1992). Recent work has shown that ligand itself may influence the binding avidity of T cell LFA-1 (Cabanas and Hogg, 1993). As leukocytes express LFA-1, ICAM-1, and ICAM-3, potential problems might occur when trying to dissect the nature of LFA-1 binding to ICAM-3, due to the influence of intercellular LFA-1/ICAM-1 or ICAM-3 interaction. In order to avoid these possible complications, COS cells were used as the recipient cells for LFA-1. DEAE-dextran transfection of COS cells with pCD18 and pCD11a results in transient expression of LFA-1 on 15-40% of cells as detected by flow cytometry with mAbs MHM24 (CD11a) or MHM23 (CD18). In contrast, no surface expression of CD11a or CD18 was detected when either pCD11a or pCD18 were transfected alone (data not shown). In order to assess the activation state of LFA-1 expressed by COS cells, binding assays were performed onto ICAM-1 and ICAM-3 in the presence or absence of activating stimuli. LFA-1 + COS were allowed to adhere to soluble recombinant fusion proteins containing the two N-terminal domains of ICAM-1 or ICAM-3 (Fawcett et al., 1992). The activation state of COS cell LFA-1 could be regulated both by the protein kinase C agonist PMA and by an “activating” anti-LFA-1 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1). The anti-CD18 mAb KIM185 is known to induce a change in the conformation of CD18 and promote LFA-1-dependent adhesion (Andrew et al., 1993). Adhesion of LFA-1 + COS to ICAM-1 and ICAM-3 is also enhanced by the addition of KIM185 (Fig. 1). Previous work has established that ICAM-3 domains 1 and 2 contain the LFA-1-binding site (Fawcett et al., 1992). However, the possibility that there might be additional contributions to this binding from domains 3, 4, and 5 has not been addressed. To investigate this a series of ICAM-3-Fc chimeric proteins, comprising a nested set of ICAM-3 domain deletion mutants, was generated (Fig. 2). Fusion protein ICAM-3(D1-D5)-Fc is the wild-type molecule containing all five immunoglobulin domains whereas proteins ICAM-3(D1-D4)-Fc, ICAM-3(D1-D3)-Fc, and ICAM-3(D1-D2)-Fc have sequential, C-terminal, domain deletions. Cell binding assays were performed with chimeric proteins immobilized onto plastic via anti-Fc polyclonal antibodies which allowed normalization of the amount of wild-type and mutant proteins presented to the cells. In order to assess the effect of the C-terminal domains of ICAM-3 on the interaction of LFA-1, the set of domain deletion mutants was used in a binding assay with LFA-1 + COS that had been activated with PMA. Binding was not significantly increased by the presence of domains 3-5 of ICAM-3 (Fig. 3). This binding is LFA-1 specific as it is blocked by the anti-CD11a mAb 38. Having established that the LFA-1-binding site is contained within domain 1 and 2, a mutagenesis screen of these domains was undertaken. We aligned the primary amino acid sequences of ICAM-1 and ICAM-3, and, based on a molecular model for ICAM-1 (Berendt et al., 1992), predicted which ICAM-3 residues contributed to the β strands of the immunoglobulin structure (Fig. 4). The key residues for ICAM-1 binding to LFA-1 (Glu 34 and Gln 73 ) are present on the CC′FG face of domain 1. To determine the importance of ICAM-3 domain 1 for interaction with LFA-1, six specific mutations were targeted onto the CC′FG face and three onto the opposite ABE face. The CC′FG face mutations included substitution of residues homologous to ICAM-1 Glu 34 and Gln 73 . In addition, five mutations were targeted onto domain 2, particularly in connecting loops between β strands, to assess its contribution toward the LFA-1-binding site. We selected residues predicted to be solvent accessible and exposed at the surface of ICAM-3. For the most part charged amino acids were substituted with alanine (Cunningham and Wells, 1989) by site-directed mutagenesis of pICAM-3(D1-D2)-Fc, and the location of the mutations is indicated in Fig. 4. Mutant ICAM-3(D1-D2)-Fc fusion proteins produced by expression of ICAM-3(D1-D2)Fc plasmids in COS cells were checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and found to migrate at the predicted size of 80 kDa (Bossy et al., 1994). To address the effect of the mutations on LFA-1 binding, adhesion assays were performed onto a concentration range of mutant and wild-type ICAM-3 protein using LFA-1 + COS cells as the ligand bearing cells (Fig. 5). When compared to an equivalent concentration of wild-type ICAM-3, no binding was exhibited to mutants E37A, L66K, S68K, Q75H, and Q75A. These residues all map onto the CC′FG face of domain 1 and are critical for interaction with LFA-1. Glu 43 is also located in this region of ICAM-3, and LFA-1 binding to E43A is reduced to 30-50% of wild-type. In contrast, substitution of Asp 27 to alanine does not affect interaction with LFA-1. Compared with those residues critical for LFA-1 binding, Asp 27 is located on the opposite face of domain 1. The domain 1 mutants F21A and P12A are also located on this ABE face, and binding of LFA-1 to these proteins is reduced to 50% of wild-type. COS cells expressing LFA-1 bound to the domain 2 mutants (Fig. 5). Interaction of LFA-1 with P158A and E143A was not affected whereas binding to D166A, R127A, and R127WE/AAA was perturbed. This indicates that domain 2 of ICAM-3 may have a role in the interaction with ligand LFA-1. In order to distinguish the most important binding area, LFA-1 expressed in COS cells was fully activated with a combination of PMA and anti-β2 activating mAb KIM185 and allowed to bind to mutant and wild-type ICAM-3 chimeric proteins (Fig. 6). Under these conditions of enhanced LFA-1 activation, there is still no binding to mutants E37A, L66K, S68K, Q75H, and Q75A. This emphasizes the critical nature of these residues for interaction with ligand. In contrast, under these optimal conditions binding to mutants on the ABE face of domain 1 and within domain 2 is largely restored and so may be less important for interaction with LFA-1. Eight anti-ICAM-3 mAbs were mapped to domain 1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay onto ICAM-3(D1-D2)-Fc and a mouse-human chimeric protein composed of D1 of mouse ICAM-1 linked to domains 2-5 of human ICAM-3. MAbs CH3.1, CH3.2, CH3.3, BY44, CG106, CAL3.10, CAL3.38, and CAL3.41 recognized ICAM-3(D1-D2)-Fc but not the mouse-human ICAM-1/ICAM-3 chimera, indicating that these mAbs have epitopes in domain 1 or possibly at the interface between domains 1 and 2. To define relationships between the epitopes of the mAbs, competitive inhibition assays were performed (data not shown). CH3.1, CH3.2, and CH3.3 recognize overlapping regions of ICAM-3 that are distinct from the epitopes of BY44 and CG106. In addition, CAL3.10, CAL3.38, and CAL3.41 are defined within a separate cluster. Mabs BY44, CG106, CAL3.10, CAL3.38, and CAL3.41 are also functionally distinct since they block the interaction of COS LFA-1 with ICAM-3(D1-D5)-Fc (Bossy et al., 1994). All of the domain 1 mAbs recognize the domain 1 mutants indicating the overall conformation of this Ig domain to be preserved (Table 1). As the blocking mAbs BY44, CG106, CAL3.10, CAL3.38, and CAL3.41 bind to all of the mutant proteins, this suggests that there may be further regions to be discovered that are important for the interaction of ICAM-3 with LFA-1.Tabled 1 KS128 bound to the mouse-human chimeric protein, although binding was 50% of that to ICAM-3(D1-D5)-Fc. This suggests that domain 2 and domain 1 of ICAM-3 contribute to the epitope of KS128. In addition, when screened on the mutant panel, KS128 bound poorly to both the domain 2 mutants R127A, R127WE/AAA, and D166A and the domain 1 mutants P12A and E43A. Thus the epitope for KS128 appears to span both N-terminal domains of ICAM-3 and this is consistent with another report (Klickstein et al., 1993). Three further mAbs, CAL3.1, CAL3.4, and CAL3.16, also appear to be influenced by domain 1 and domain 2. Like KS128, the binding of these mAbs is decreased by mutations in both domain 1 and domain 2. An explanation for this is that Pro 12 , Glu 43 , Arg 127 , and Asp 166 are in close association, a prediction that is supported by modeling data (see below). The mAbs CAL3.1, CAL3.4, CAL3.16, and KS128 do not recognize all of the domain 2 mutants (Table 1). Since binding of each domain 1/domain 2 mAb is perturbed to R127A, R127WE/AAA, and D166A, it must be considered that these mutations are destabilizing. In contrast, the majority of the domain 1/domain 2 mAbs recognize E143A and P158A suggesting that these mutants maintain structural integrity. In addition, each domain 2 mutant is recognized by all of the domain 1 mAbs, and this confirms the conformation of the first domain in each case. In order to map the relative position of the mutations, a model of the two N-terminal domains of ICAM-3 was constructed (Fig. 7). The protocol for replacement of side chains and protein fragments (usually loop regions) was initiated by a critical comparison of the primary protein sequence alignment of ICAM-1 and ICAM-3 (Fig. 4) and then followed by methodologies previously described for the ICAM-1 model (Berendt et al., 1992). An important feature of the molecular model is the relative position of the two domains. For both ICAM-1 and ICAM-3, a close association between the domains is predicted with domain 2 rotated at approximately 160° with respect to domain 1. Key conserved hydrophobic patches at the base of domain 1 and at the top of domain 2 support this arrangement (data not shown) as does the epitope mapping in this present study. The location of the 14 mutations is indicated on the molecular model (Fig. 7). The residues critical for the association of ICAM-3 with LFA-1 (Glu 37 , Leu 66 , Ser 68 , and Gln 75 ) are aligned on the CC′FG face of domain 1. The residue Asp 166 , within the F-G loop of domain 2, also contributes to the binding site. The model shows the CC′FG face of domain 1 and the F-G loop of domain 2 to be associated along the same side of ICAM-3 and this supports the participation of these two regions in the binding site for LFA-1. There are seven potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the two N-terminal domains of ICAM-3, and their position is relevant when considering the LFA-1-binding site. In a previously solved x-ray crystal structure of an Fc antibody fragment, an N-linked oligosaccharide covered hydrophobic residues on one face of the Ig fold (Diesenhofer, 1981). The oligosaccharide from this Fc fragment was clipped and placed on each of the potential glycosylation sites on the molecular model of ICAM-3. Freely rotatable bonds of the Asn-oligosaccharide complexes were then adjusted to remove steric clashes and to cover exposed hydrophobic residues. The general conclusion drawn from this exercise is that the CC′FG face on the first domain is relatively free from oligosaccharide cover, and the oligosaccharides at positions four and five impinge only on the edges of this region (Fig. 7). To study the binding site for LFA-1 on ICAM-3, we measured the adhesion of COS cells expressing LFA-1 to a series of mutant ICAM-3 proteins. This model system had two significant benefits. First, by using COS cells to present LFA-1, we avoided the influence of interleukocyte LFA-1/ICAM binding events that may affect the binding avidity of LFA-1 on leukocytes (Cabanas and Hogg, 1993). Therefore, COS cells expressing LFA-1 permitted a direct analysis of ICAM-3 binding. Second, all adhesion assays were normalized for the amount of wild-type or mutant protein presented to the LFA-1 + /COS cells. All ICAM-3 site-directed mutants were produced as recombinant D1-D2-Fc fusion proteins, and this allowed even small differences in the binding properties between the mutants to be quantitatively assessed. This system overcomes the problems of expressing equivalent amounts of mutant proteins in COS cells and eliminates the possibility of accessory cell-cell interactions which may contribute to background binding in a two-cell system. Here we show that LFA-1 expressed by a non-leukocytic cell type, COS cells, can exist in a variety of activation states with different affinities for ligand. The avidity state of COS cell LFA-1 can be regulated both by “outside-in” signals (mediated by mAb KIM185) and “inside-out” signals (mediated by the protein kinase C agonist, PMA). In a separate study, COS cell LFA-1 was activated with anti-CD11a mAb MEM83 and binding to ICAM-1 was enhanced (Landis et al., 1994). This ability to regulate COS cell LFA-1, differs from a previous report, in which LFA-1 expressed in COS cells was shown to be constitutively active (Larson et al., 1990). This discrepancy may reflect differences in the level of expression of LFA-1 on the COS cells. Larson et al.(1990) achieved a higher transfection efficiency (50% of LFA-1 + cells in the COS cell population) and higher expression of LFA-1/COS cell. These factors might affect avidity by altering the distribution of LFA-1 on the COS cell surface. Domains 1 and 2 of ICAM-3 are necessary and sufficient for interaction with LFA-1. There are no protein recognition sequences for LFA-1 within domains 3-5. These domains may, however, have a role in presentation of the binding site to LFA-1 when ICAM-3 is expressed at the cell surface in the context of the cell glycocalyx. This appears to be true for the interaction of ICAM-1 with its receptor on Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes (Berendt et al., 1992). The ICAM-1-binding site for malaria-infected erythrocytes maps to the first two domains, yet adhesion to a shortened version of ICAM-1 containing only these domains is dramatically reduced presumably due to steric hindrance. In the present work, domain-deleted and wild-type chimeric proteins were presented equally to LFA-1 via anti-Fc antibodies so eliminating the issue of binding site accessibility. Having established the importance of domains 1 and 2 of ICAM-3 for interaction with LFA-1, site-directed mutants were generated to dissect the binding site. Mutations were targeted onto the CC′FG face and ABE face of the first domain of ICAM-3. The CC′FG face of ICAM-3 was of particular interest since the equivalent region of ICAM-1 contributes to LFA-1 binding (Berendt et al., 1992). We show that glutamine at position 37 of ICAM-3 is essential for LFA-1 binding. ICAM-3 E37 is equivalent to ICAM-1 Glu 34 which is also critical for association with LFA-1 ligand (Staunton et al., 1990). To extend the study of ICAM-3 E37, we made substitutions of the amino acids to which Glu 37 is predicted to hydrogen bond. Modeling data associates Glu 37 in an interaction triad with Leu 66 and Ser 68 . By generating mutants L66K and S68K, binding of ICAM-3 to LFA-1 was prevented, presumably by disrupting the inter-residue contacts within this triad. A second key residue for the ICAM-3/LFA-1 interaction is Gln 75 . The homologous residue is Gln 73 in ICAM-1 and is essential for LFA-1 binding. Staunton et al. (1990) found that mutating ICAM-1 Gln 73 to histidine decreased LFA-1 binding 10-fold, and substitution to threonine decreases binding 2-fold. In contrast, we find that mutation of ICAM-3 Q75 to either a histidine or an alanine eliminates LFA-1 binding. Therefore, ICAM-3 residue Gln 75 distinguishes the binding site for LFA-1 on ICAM-3 from that on ICAM-1. The fact that ICAM-3 binding was eliminated by mutations at Leu 66 and Ser 68 on the F strand in the middle of the CC′FG face indicates that those residues important for interaction with LFA-1 are aligned along one face of the molecule. This region of ICAM-3 is predicted to be free from oligosaccharide cover and therefore accessible for ligand binding. Indeed, a recent study (Landis et al., 1994) shows that the glycosylation of ICAM-3 domain 1 does not have a role in ligand binding. Although our assignment of oligosaccharide chains to the periphery of the CC′FG face is speculative, a recent study of the glycan structures of human CD2 suggests a similar situation with regard to the ligand-binding site (Withka et al., 1993). The three-dimensional structure of the fully glycosylated form of domain 1 of human CD2, determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, places the oligosaccharide at the top of the connecting loops between the β strands, at the perimeter of the CD58 ligand-binding site. The ICAM-3 D1 ABE face mutations had less dramatic effects than most of the CC′FG face substitutions. The mutant D27A bound ligand to the same extent as wild-type ICAM-3, and this residue is equivalent to ICAM-1 S24 which also is not involved in LFA-1 binding (Staunton et al., 1990). The two other ABE face mutations, Pro 12 and Phe 21 , did perturb ligand binding. This raises the possibility that there are regions of ICAM-3 D1, in addition to the CC′FG face, that have a role in ligand binding. Residue Pro 12 is located on the A strand of ICAM-3 D1. Interestingly, mutation of the A strand of ICAM-1 D1 does not affect binding to LFA-1 (Staunton et al., 1990). Since LFA-1 binds selectively to ICAM-1 and ICAM-3 (Landis et al., 1994), the binding interfaces are likely to be distinctive. For both ICAM-1 and ICAM-3, the CC′FG face of domain 1 appears to have a dominant role in interaction with ligand, but the binding sites may be defined by other areas within domain 1. Alignment of ICAM-1 with ICAM-3 reveals that the highest degree of sequence homology occurs in the second domain (77% amino acid identity), suggesting functional importance for this region of the ICAMs. Because of lack of reagents (mAbs and mutants), only limited analysis of ICAM-1 domain 2 has been reported. To date, only the F-G loop of ICAM-1 D2 polypeptide is known to contribute to LFA-1 binding (Berendt et al., 1992; Staunton et al., 1992). To determine the extent of interaction of LFA-1 with D2 of ICAM-3, domain 1 proximal and distal mutations were made. Mutation of Arg 127 and Asp 166 reduced binding to LFA-1 but may also destabilize the Ig structure. Thus, the second domain of ICAM-3 may contribute to the LFA-1-binding site, but the extent of the interaction face has yet to be determined. There may be regions within domain 2 that are critical for LFA-1 binding, or it is possible that this domain has only a supportive role in association with ligand LFA-1. LFA-1 interacts with key residues on the CC′FG face of domain 1. For members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, the faces of the β strands of the Ig-related domains may be as important for ligand interaction as the connecting loop regions. Indeed, the binding site for LFA-3 (CD58) is located along one face (in fact the CC′FG face) of CD2 (Somoza et al., 1993; Arulanandam et al., 1993). A molecular model of the first two domains of ICAM-3 indicates that the domains are closely associated, with the second domain rotated at approximately 160°. Although molecular modeling cannot predict domain packing with certainty, solved structures for CD4 and CD2 support this orientation (Wang et al., 1990; Ryu et al., 1990: Jones et al., 1992; Brady et al., 1992). Thus, the LFA-1 binding surface on ICAM-3 encompasses the CC′FG face of domain 1 and may extend into domain 2. Although it is possible that, within domains 1 and 2, there are other important binding areas to be defined. Amino acids Glu 34 and Gln 75 within ICAM-3 domain 1 may represent an essential, common motif in the ligand-binding site of all ICAMs. Homologous residues are found in all members of the ICAM family, ICAM-1 (Simmons et al., 1988; Staunton et al., 1988), ICAM-2 (Staunton et al., 1989), and ICAM-3 (Fawcett et al., 1992; Vazeux et al., 1992; de Fougerolles et al., 1993), and are critical for binding of LFA-1 to ICAM-1 and ICAM-3. These key residues are also conserved across species and are present in chimpanzee ICAM-1 (Hammond and McClelland 1993), rat ICAM-1 (Kita et al., 1992), mouse ICAM-1 (Horley et al., 1989), and mouse ICAM-2 (Xu et al., 1992). This motif may be generally important for the interaction of integrins with members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). To date, there are three examples of IgSF/integrin interactions: ICAMs with LFA-1 and/or Mac-1 (Simmons et al., 1988; Staunton et al., 1989; Diamond et al., 1990), VCAM with VLA-4 (α4β1) and α4β7 integrins (Elices et al., 1990; Ruegg et al., 1992), and MadCAM-1 with the α4β7 integrin (Berlin et al., 1993). Acidic residues at equivalent locations on VCAM-1 domains 1 and 4 (i.e. within the C-C′ region) are also important for binding to its cognate integrin VLA-4 (α4β1) (Osborn et al., 1994; Vonderheide et al., 1994; Renz et al., 1994). In conclusion, we have identified the CC′FG face of ICAM-3 to be an important binding region for LFA-1. Residues critical for interaction with LFA-1 are present on this face of domain 1. Some of these essential residues may form the basis of a common motif for all IgSF-integrin interactions.

Kerr C.B. Br. Med. J. 1966; 1: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Affected skin appears scaly and is characterized histologically by hyperkeratosis and a decreased or absent granular layer(2Wells R.S. Kerr C.B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1966; 46: 530-535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, keratohyalin granules, an ultrastructural landmark in the granular layer, are either absent or reduced and structurally abnormal(3Anton-Lamprecht I. Hofbauer M. Humangenetik. 1972; 15: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Other clinical symptoms, including hyperlinear palms and soles, a personal or family history of atopy, and keratosis pilaris are often associated with IV(1Wells R.S. Kerr C.B. Br. Med. J. 1966; 1: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Although the disease is well described clinically, the etiology is poorly understood.Filaggrin is a cationic protein that aggregates keratin intermediate filaments in the stratum corneum of the epidermis (for review, see (4Dale B.A. Presland R.B. Fleckman P. Kam E. Resing K.A. Molecular Biology of Skin: The Keratinocyte. Vol. I. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1993: 79-106Google Scholar)). Profilaggrin, the precursor of filaggrin, is first expressed in the granular layer and marks the terminal stages of epidermal differentiation. The phosphorylated profilaggrin accumulates in keratohyalin granules and later undergoes dephosphorylation and proteolysis to filaggrin. Profilaggrin and filaggrin are noticeably decreased or absent from the epidermis of patients with IV(5Sybert V.P. Dale B.A. Holbrook K.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1985; 84: 191-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that keratinocytes cultured from affected individuals maintain structural and biochemical phenotypic characteristics of the disorder(6Fleckman P. Holbrook K.A. Dale B.A. Sybert V.P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1987; 88: 640-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, very little profilaggrin is detectable by immunohistochemical staining on Western blots of extracts obtained from IV keratinocytes compared with controls. These data are consistent with the absence of keratohyalin in this disorder. This suggests a pronounced decrease in profilaggrin synthesis and/or accumulation as is seen in the skin biopsies from affected individuals.Recently, the structure of the human profilaggrin gene has been reported by two different laboratories(7Presland R.B. Haydock P.V. Fleckman P. Nirunsuksiri W. Dale B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23772-23781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Markova N.G. Marekov L.N. Chipev D.C. Gan S.-Q. Idler W.W. Steinert P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 613-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The gene (see Fig. 3A) contains three exons interrupted by two introns of 9,713 and 570 bp, respectively. The 5′-noncoding region (75 bp) is divided into two exons separated by the large intron. The coding region begins in the second exon and continues in the third exon, where 10-12 highly repetitive filaggrin sequences of exactly 972 bp reside. The number of filaggrin repeats varies between individuals and is inherited in a Mendelian fashion(9Gan S.-Q McBride O.W. Idler W.W. Markova N. Steinert P.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9432-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The amino terminus of profilaggrin contains a calcium binding domain consisting of two EF-hands resembling those present in the S-100 family of proteins(7Presland R.B. Haydock P.V. Fleckman P. Nirunsuksiri W. Dale B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23772-23781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that the S-100 domain of profilaggrin binds calcium(8Markova N.G. Marekov L.N. Chipev D.C. Gan S.-Q. Idler W.W. Steinert P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 613-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 10Presland R.B. Bassuk J.A. Kimball J.R. Dale B.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; (in press)Google Scholar). Hence, profilaggrin may not only function as a keratin aggregating protein, but it may also play a critical role in the regulation of calcium-dependent events during epidermal differentiation(7Presland R.B. Haydock P.V. Fleckman P. Nirunsuksiri W. Dale B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23772-23781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).To investigate further the association between decreased profilaggrin expression and IV, we studied profilaggrin mRNA levels in vivo by in situ hybridization and utilized a human epidermal keratinocyte culture system as an in vitro model. We analyzed profilaggrin expression at the protein, steady-state mRNA, and transcriptional levels in keratinocytes cultured from individuals with IV as well as from appropriate, unaffected family members and age- and sex-matched normal controls. Our data indicate that selectively impaired posttranscriptional regulation results in reduced profilaggrin mRNA and protein in IV.MATERIALS AND METHODSDiagnosis of Ichthyosis VulgarisProbands were identified from patients seen in the University of Washington Medical Center Dermatology Clinics and from individuals referred by clinical dermatologists from the community.

Biopsies were fixed in methyl Carnoy's for light microscopy and immunocytochemistry and fixed in half-strength Karnovsky's for electron microscopy as described previously(12Dale B.A. Holbrook K.A.

In this report, results from affected, unrelated individuals from three different families are presented. Related, unaffected family members served as controls for two cases, and an unrelated, age- and sex-matched subjects for the other.In Situ HybridizationBiopsies were obtained from the extensor surface of the arm and snap frozen in Tissue-Tek ® OCT (Miles, Inc.) embedding medium. Ten-micron frozen sections were fixed briefly in paraformaldehyde and processed by standard techniques (14Fisher C. Haydock P.V. Dale B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1987; 88: 661-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications; proteinase K digestion was omitted, an initial 1-h wash at room temperature with 4 × SSC (1 × SSC: 0.15 M sodium chloride, 0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0) was added after hybridization, and 10 mM dithiothreitol was added to all rinses. Hybridization was with a 35 S-labeled riboprobe generated from a human filaggrin repeat cloned into pGEM-1 (Promega Corp.). The plasmid was linearized with EcoRI, and antisense riboprobe was generated with the use of T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α- 35 S]UTP (1,000 Ci/mmol) (DuPont NEN).Cell CultureAdult human keratinocytes were obtained from blister biopsies as described previously(6Fleckman P. Holbrook K.A. Dale B.A. Sybert V.P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1987; 88: 640-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Keratinocytes were cultured on mitomycin C-treated 3T3 cells and maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 36.9°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies) containing 20% fetal calf serum, hydrocortisone, cholera toxin, and epidermal growth factor. Cells were fed 3 times a week and 24 h before harvesting. To ensure profilaggrin expression, cells were harvested 3 days after cells reached confluence.Protein Extraction, SDS-PAGE, and Western BlottingTotal urea-Tris-soluble protein extracts (15Haydock P.V. Blomquist C. Brumbaugh S. Dale B. Holbrook K. Fleckman P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 118-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from keratinocytes cultured in parallel with those used for the isolation of RNA and nuclei. Equal protein loadings were separated on discontinuous 7.5-15% SDS-PAGE gels, and proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell). Profilaggrin was detected with polyclonal anti-human profilaggrin/filaggrin antiserum(16Fleckman P. Dale B.A. Holbrook K.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1985; 85: 507-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), K1 with monoclonal antibody AE3 (a generous gift of T.-T. Sun, New York University Medical Center, (17Eichner R.

Amplification using PCR was performed using Taq polymerase (Promega Corp.). Conditions for PCR were 94°C for 1 min, 50°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min, for 30 cycles.2R. B. Presland, unpublished data.3)The profilaggrin-3′-noncoding region (517 bp) was generated from human genomic DNA using an upstream oligonucleotide that included the stop codon (underlined) of human profilaggrin gene(9Gan S.-Q McBride O.W.

Roop, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) is a subclone of pK456 (110 bp) and contains the BamHI-PstI fragment of pK456, which encodes the carboxyl-terminal end domain and 3′-noncoding region of the human K1 gene(19Steinert P.M.

Conditions used for PCR were 94°C for 1 min, 59°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min, for 30 cycles.6)The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pHcGAP plasmid was obtained from ATCC.7)The cDNA for human S26 ribosomal protein (HS26) was a gift of Dr. P. Fort, Montpellier Cedex 2, France.8)Genomic DNA was prepared from cultured fibroblasts of normal and IV-affected individuals as described previously(21Miller S.A. Dykes D.D. Polesky H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17690) Google Scholar).Northern AnalysisTotal cellular RNA was prepared from cultured keratinocytes using the guanidine thiocyanate-acid phenol method(22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62983) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of total RNA (10 μg) were separated on 1% glyoxal gels, blotted onto GeneScreen Plus membranes (DuPont NEN) and hybridized to a nick-translated or random primed probe overnight at 60°C in the buffer recommended by the manufacturer except that 200 μg/ml sonicated denatured salmon sperm DNA was included. Filters were washed 3 times in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, followed by 3 times in 0.1% SDS/0.1 × SSC at 65°C. All Northern blots were reprobed with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and HS26 cDNA to ascertain equal RNA loadings. The autoradiographs were scanned using the PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and quantified using image analysis software (ImageQuant Version 3.22, Molecular Dynamics). All comparison between hybridization signals was based on equal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or HS26 signal.Isolation of Nuclei and Nuclear Run-on AssaysFirst or second passage human keratinocytes were cultured to 3 days post-confluence. Nuclei were isolated by a modification of the method of Greenberg and Bender(23Greenberg M.E. Bender T.P. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1990: 4.10.1-4.10.9Google Scholar). Keratinocytes were harvested from five to six 100-mm plates, resuspended in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, vortexed briefly, and severed with sterile scissors. Cells were broken using 40 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer, and nuclei were isolated, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70°C. Nuclei were incubated with run-on reaction buffer in the presence of 250 μCi of [α- P]GTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) for 30 min. Labeled RNA was isolated and purified through a SuperSelect column (5′ → 3′, Boulder, CO). Equivalent 32 P-labeled RNA (as determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation) was hybridized to plasmid DNA that had been linearized, denatured, and immobilized onto nitrocellulose using a slot blotting apparatus (Bio-Rad). Hybridization was carried out in 1 ml of TES buffer with 100 mg/ml denatured sonicated salmon sperm DNA for 48-72 h at 65°C, followed by two washes in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and two washes in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 30 min. Exposure to x-ray film was for 3-7 days. Nuclear run-on was also carried out in the presence of 0.5% sarkosyl (24Bentley D.L. Groudine M. Nature. 1986; 321: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) in order to distinguish between polymerase initiation and elongation. α-Amanitin (2 μg/ml) was used to show that in vitro transcription was due to RNA polymerase II activity(24Bentley D.L. Groudine M. Nature. 1986; 321: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar).RESULTSIn Situ Analysis of Profilaggrin mRNA in IV and Normal EpidermisIt has been shown previously by immunohistochemical techniques using an anti-human profilaggrin antibody that immunoreactive profilaggrin and filaggrin are markedly decreased in the epidermis of IV-affected individuals compared with normal controls(5Sybert V.P. Dale B.A. Holbrook K.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1985; 84: 191-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). To determine if the decrease is due to a reduction in profilaggrin mRNA, in situ hybridization using a 35 S-labeled riboprobe transcribed from a human filaggrin repeat was performed. A dramatic decrease in silver grains in the granular layer of affected IV epidermis compared with normal skin was seen (Fig. 1) showing reduced levels of profilaggrin mRNA in the epidermis of IV-affected individuals and confirming studies at the protein level (5Sybert V.P. Dale B.A. Holbrook K.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1985; 84: 191-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). No significant labeling of the epidermis was seen with the sense strand riboprobe (data not shown).Figure 1:In situ hybridization of skin from IV-affected individuals and controls. Biopsies of unaffected (C) and affected (IV) individuals were hybridized with 35 S-labeled antisense filaggrin riboprobe. Reduced silver grains were viewed by light microscopy.

It should be noted that cultured human keratinocytes express profilaggrin at confluence but do not process it to filaggrin as normally occurs during terminal differentiation in vivo(6Fleckman P. Holbrook K.A. Dale B.A. Sybert V.P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1987; 88: 640-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It typically appears as a broad smear on SDS gels. The anti-human profilaggrin antibody detected very little profilaggrin in extracts from affected individuals, in agreement with previous findings(6Fleckman P. Holbrook K.A. Dale B.A. Sybert V.P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1987; 88: 640-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We visually estimated the amount of immunoreactive protein in keratinocyte extracts from affected individuals to be less than 10% of normal controls. This result paralleled the loss or reduction of keratohyalin granules observed in the corresponding skin biopsies (data not shown). In contrast, the expression of neither loricrin, another marker of the late stages of epidermal differentiation also localized in keratohyalin granules, nor K1, a marker of suprabasal differentiation, were reduced (Fig. 2). The results strongly suggest that the defect in keratinocytes obtained from IV-affected individuals is specific to profilaggrin.Figure 2:SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analyses of profilaggrin in IV-affected individuals and controls. Equal protein loadings of extracts from IV-affected keratinocytes cultured from three unrelated individuals (IV)and normal controls (C) were analyzed by PAGE. Controls in the first two pairs were unaffected offspring, while the control in the third pair was an unrelated unaffected age- and sex-matched individual. Lane F contains foreskin epidermal extract. The proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose paper and reacted with antibodies directed against human profilaggrin (proFG) and filaggrin (FG) (a), neutral-basic keratins (K1, K5, and K6) (b), and loricrin (LORI) (c). Identity of the 30 kDa loricrin band was confirmed in parallel studies with antiserum generously supplied by Dennis Roop (Houston, TX) (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Steady State Level of the Profilaggrin mRNA in IV KeratinocytesTo gain insight into the etiology of the disease, profilaggrin mRNA levels in keratinocytes from affected individuals and controls was determined. Northern analysis of total RNA harvested from confluent keratinocytes of three unrelated IV subjects and controls was conducted with a probe from a filaggrin repeat within exon 3 of the profilaggrin gene (Fig. 3A). The level of profilaggrin mRNA in affected cells was markedly reduced compared with the normal counterparts (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained when exon 2, which contains part of the EF-hand domain, was used as a probe (data not shown). The intensity of each hybridization signal was quantified using the PhosphorImager and the level of mRNA normalized to the internal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control. The levels of profilaggrin mRNA were 30, 61, and 43% of their corresponding controls (from left to rightpanel). When loricrin- and K1-specific probes were used on the same blots, no differences in RNA levels were seen between normal and affected (Fig. 3B). These results were consistent with those of the Western analysis, although compared with the normal counterparts, the levels of immunoreactive profilaggrin protein were much lower in IV keratinocytes than the levels of profilaggrin mRNAs.The basis of comparison relied on the use of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to normalize RNA on the blots. However, recent evidence suggests that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression may vary as a function of proliferative state and physiological conditions within the cell(25Meyer-Siegler K. Rahman-Mansur N. Wurzer J. Sirover M.A. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 2127-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Perfetti V. Manenti G. Dragani T.A. Leukemia. 1991; 5: 1110-1112PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mansur N.R. Meyer-Siegler K. Wurzer J.C. Sirover M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Keratinocytes used in this study were at postconfluence, when proliferation is reduced(28Milstone L. McGuire J. LaVigne J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1982; 79: 253-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our assumption was that the rate of proliferation of normal and IV-affected keratinocytes is similar. However, it is possible that development, differentiation, and/or metabolic activity of keratinocytes from IV-affected individuals differ from normal. Hence, regulation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase may be altered, and the RNA profile may be inaccurate. Therefore the same blots were hybridized with a second probe made from a cDNA for HS26 ribosomal protein RNA, which shows invariant expression among several cell lines(29Vincent S. Marty L. Fort P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The phosphorimaging analysis indicated that the levels of profilaggrin mRNA normalized to HS26 were 24, 67, and 40% of the corresponding controls. The result is similar to that obtained using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a standard for normalization, indicating profilaggrin mRNA levels in IV keratinocytes are about 45% of normal controls.Transcription of Profilaggrin mRNA in IV and Normal KeratinocytesComparison of profilaggrin mRNA levels using Northern blots determines the steady state level of RNA but does not differentiate between decreased RNA levels resulting from defective transcriptional or posttranscriptional events (see “Discussion”). To delineate between the two, profilaggrin transcription was examined by nuclear run-on assay.Keratinocytes cultured from individuals with IV and unaffected controls were harvested 3 days after reaching confluence. Harvesting was done 24 h after feeding, which increases profilaggrin mRNA transcription. 3W. Nirunsuksiri and P. Fleckman, unpublished data. Nuclei and total RNA were then isolated. Hybridization of the nascently transcribed labeled RNA to a human filaggrin repeat, K1, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase fragments revealed virtually identical levels of transcription between keratinocytes from normal and IV-affected individuals (Fig. 4). In contrast, experiments using nuclei from subconfluent keratinocytes gave very low signal for profilaggrin transcription (data not shown). Because the assay utilized a probe of filaggrin repeat from exon 3, the result also suggested that transcriptional pausing in either the first or second exon was not a cause of reduced profilaggrin mRNA in IV-affected individuals. In order to test more rigorously for possible transcriptional pausing in profilaggrin expression, sarkosyl which overcomes pausing (24Bentley D.L. Groudine M. Nature. 1986; 321: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) was added. It had no effect on signal intensity in either IV-affected or normal individuals (data not shown), suggesting that transcriptional pausing was not a factor.Figure 4:Nuclear run-on transcription analysis of the profilaggrin gene in confluent keratinocytes cultured from IV-affected individuals and normal controls. Nuclei were isolated from control (C) and IV-affected keratinocytes (IV), and run-on transcription assays were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The pair on the farright is from two of the individuals studied in Fig. 2. The two pairs on the left are not, but expression of profilaggrin mRNA and protein was identical to that shown in Figure 2:, Figure 3:. Equal counts/min of P-labeled RNA were hybridized to filters loaded with linearized plasmids (10 mg each) containing inserts of the following: 3′ terminus of K1 cDNA (K1), cDNA of a filaggrin repeat (FG), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Linearized plasmid pGEM-3 was used for an estimation of the nonspecific hybridization signal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Analysis of 5′-Flanking Region from IV-affected IndividualsThe sequence of the 5′-upstream flanking DNA of human profilaggrin from −1 to −869 bp obtained from three IV-affected individuals was also determined to identify any promoter mutations that might account for the lower profilaggrin mRNA expression. Very few differences in nucleotide sequence were apparent (data not shown); no changes were specific to IV. Such identified changes could be due to allelic polymorphism or errors due to PCR. No changes were seen in the immediate upstream region containing putative regulatory motifs such as the TATA box, SP1, or AP1 sites(7Presland R.B. Haydock P.V. Fleckman P. Nirunsuksiri W.

https://openalex.org/W2052749078,"The B cell-specific expression of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes is controlled by the concerted action of variable (V) region promoters and intronic or 3′ enhancers, all of which are active in a lymphoid-specific manner. A crucial highly conserved element of the V region promoters is the octamer site -ATTTGCAT-, which can be bound by ubiquitous (Oct-1) as well as B cell-specific (Oct-2) factors. Another less conserved element found in many Ig promoters is pyrimidine-rich and has been shown to be functionally important, in particular for those Ig promoters that have only an imperfect octamer site. In this study we have analyzed the factors binding specifically to the pyrimidine-rich motif of the Vκ19 promoter, a light chain gene promoter with an imperfect octamer site. Using nuclear extracts prepared from B cells, we detected two sets of specific complexes in electrophoretic mobility shift experiments. One complex appears to be ubiquitous but enriched in lymphoid cells and represents the binding of a potentially novel factor with an apparent molecular mass of ∼ 50 kDa. The other complex was found only with extracts from pre-B or B cells as well as from a macrophage cell line and appears to be caused by the binding of PU.1, a factor of the Ets family. We show that on this Ig promoter Oct factors (Oct-1 or Oct-2) and PU.1 can bind concomitantly but without synergism. By transfection experiments in non-B cells we demonstrate that PU.1 is indeed able to activate this promoter in concert with Oct-2. Furthermore, we show that PU.1 can bind with varying affinities to the pyrimidine-rich elements of several other Ig promoters.

In addition, some heavy chain promoters contain a so-called heptamer motif 5′-CTCATGA-3′ that, in cooperation with the octamer motif, can also bind octamer factors(21Kemler I. Schreiber E.

The B cell specificity of Ig promoters is largely caused by the octamer element(9Wirth T. Staudt L. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 329: 174-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), although this same element is also implicated in the ubiquitous expression of small nuclear RNA genes(23Parry H.D. Scherly D.

Herr W. Nature. 1989; 341: 624-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The ability of the octamer element to promote ubiquitous as well as B cell-specific gene expression was initially suggested to reside in its interaction with Oct-1 and Oct-2. The different cellular distribution of these two proteins led to the proposal that Oct-2 rather than Oct-1 is responsible for the B cell specificity of Ig promoters. The suggestion that Oct-2 specifically promotes Ig gene transcription has come into question, because from in vitro experiments with octamer-containing promoter constructs, it has been shown that Oct-1 and Oct-2 are essentially interchangeable(28Kemler I. Bucher E. Seipel K. Müller-Immerglück M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Analysis of Oct-2 knockout mice has shown that Oct-2 is not required for the generation of Ig-bearing B cells but is crucial for their maturation to Ig-secreting cells, and this implies that Oct-2 plays an essential role only late in B cell differentiation(29Corcoran L. Karvelas M.M. Nossal G.J. Ve Z.S. Jacks T. Baltimore D. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that both octamer factors can activate transcription from Ig promoters. Moreover, a B cell-restricted coactivator, OCA-B, which can interact with Oct-1 or Oct-2, has been suggested to be required for a high level of Ig promoter activity(30Luo Y. Fujii H. Gerster T. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 231-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 31Pierani A. Heguy A. Fujii H. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6204-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, a third less conserved pyrimidine-rich element is found upstream of the heptamer or the octamer motif in many Ig promoters and has been shown to be also important for full promoter activity. However, only little is known about the factors mediating Ig gene transcription from these pyrimidine-rich sequences(32Atchison M.L. Delmas V. Perry R.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3109-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 33Ballard D.W. Bothwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the studies reported here, we have analyzed the factors binding to the pyrimidine-rich motif of a κ light chain promoter (Vκ19). By electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with nuclear extracts prepared from B cells and a Vκ19 promoter pyrimidine-rich motif we detected two sets of specific complexes. We show that one of these factors binding specifically to that site appears to be PU.1, a member of the Ets family that is expressed in B cells and macrophages(35Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). PU.1 is identical to the Spi-1 proto-oncogene(36Moreau-Gachelin F. Ray D. Mattei M.-G. Tambourin P. Tavitian A. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 1449-1456PubMed Google Scholar, 37Paul R. Schuetze S. Kozak S.L. Kozak C.A. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 464-467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was isolated as the site of Friend erythroleukemia virus integration in 95% of virally induced tumors. In addition to PU.1, the Ets family contains several proteins, for instance Ets-1, Ets-2, Elf-1, Elk-1, Erg, E74, Fli-1, and PEA3 (38Macleod K. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 251-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) that share a relatively conserved 80-90-amino acid long DNA-binding domain that recognizes a purine-rich sequence with the core motif 5′-GGA(A/T)-3′(35Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 39Bosselut R. Levin J. Adjadj E. Ghysdael J. Nucleic AcidsRes. 1993; 21: 5184-5191Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 40Wasylyk B. Wasylyk C. Flores P. Begue A. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Nature. 1990; 346: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). As with other Ets proteins, however, very little is known about the cellular genes that are regulated by PU.1. The other factor recognizing specifically the pyrimidine-rich motif has an apparent molecular mass of ∼ 50 kDa and is ubiquitous but is enriched in lymphoid extracts and might be a novel factor, perhaps also belonging to the Ets family. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PU.1 is able to strongly activate transcription of the Vκ19 light chain promoter through the pyrimidine-rich motif and that maximal promoter activity was obtained in cooperation with Oct-2 in transfected cells. Finally, by performing binding studies with related pyrimidine-rich sequences derived from light or heavy chain promoters, we show that PU.1 can also bind with varying affinities to several of these motifs present in other Ig promoters. Our data, thus, suggest that PU.1 as well as perhaps other factors of the Ets family might be involved in the regulation of a number of Ig promoters. The non-lymphoid cell line HeLa is derived from a human epitheloid cervical carcinoma; Cos is an SV40-transformed monkey kidney; and 3T3 is an embryonal BALB/c mouse cell line. The B cell line BJA-B is a lymphoblastoid cell line; HAFTL, BAF3, 38B9, PD31, and 70Z/3 are mouse pre-B lymphocytes; NFS5.3 is a mouse pre-B lymphoblast; S194 is a mouse plasmacytoma; Wehi 231 is a mouse lymphoma; Nalm 6 is a human pre-B cell; and Namalwa is a Burkitt lymphoma cell line. The T-cell lines YAC1, PEER, and BW5147 are mouse lymphoma; and CEM, Molt 4, and Jurkat are human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. U937 is a human monocyte/macrophage cell line. Lymphoid cells were grown to a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and non-lymphoid cells were grown to confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 3% fetal calf serum and 3% newborn calf serum. Nuclear extracts from different cell lines were prepared as described previously(41Schreiber E. M ü ller M.M. Schaffner W. Matthias P. Renkawitz R. Tissue-specific Gene Expression. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim, Germany1989: 33-54Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic RNA from the pre-B cell line 70Z/3 was used for first strand cDNA synthesis primed with oligonucleotide dT. Using this cDNA, PU.1 cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with the specific primers 5′-CGGGGCACCTGGTCCTG-3′ and 5′-GTAATCTAGATATGGCCGGCGGGGTCCAG-3′ and subsequently subcloned into the XbaI and BamHI sites of the pBluescript KS + (II) vector. The clone was verified by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. For in vitro expression Oct-1, Oct-2, and PU.1 cDNAs were subcloned into the pBGo vector, a Bluescript derivative in which part of the rabbit β-globin gene leader sequence has been inserted immediately downstream of the T3 promoter. RNA was generated from BamHI-linearized Oct-1 and XbaI-linearized Oct-2 and PU.1 plasmids in a T3 RNA polymerase reaction, using an mCAP transcription kit (Stratagene). In vitro transcription reactions were carried out for 60 min at 37°C. In vitro translations were performed by using 10 μl of the synthesized RNA, 35 μl of nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), 1 μl of amino acid mix, and 40 units of RNase inhibitor in a 50-μl reaction mixture. Translation reactions were carried out for 60 min at 30°C. For EMSA 4-8 fmol of 32 P-end-labeled oligonucleotides were incubated with 4 μg of nuclear extract or 1 μl of in vitro-translated protein (PU.1, diluted 1:6; Oct-1, undiluted; Oct-2, diluted 1:5) and 2 or 0.4 μg of poly(dI/dC), respectively, in 15 μl of a buffer containing 4% Ficoll, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Boehringer Mannheim) and 2 mM spermine. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature the binding reaction was separated on a native 4% polyacrylamide gel (29:1 cross-link) in 0.25 × Tris borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer at 10 V/cm for 2-3 h at room temperature. Competition experiments were done by mixing an 100-1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor DNA to the binding reaction before adding the nuclear extract. For antibody supershift experiments 1 μl of a polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against the carboxyl-terminal domain (amino acids 251-271) of PU.1 was added to the nuclear extract or in vitro-translated protein. The following oligonucleotides were synthesized for use in EMSA: the pyrimidine-rich motif (κPy) GTAATTTACTTCCTTATTTGATGA and the mutated motif (κPy∗) GTAATTTACTCGAGTATTTGATGA, bp −97 to −74, of the Vκ19 promoter; the pyrimidine-rich and the octamer motif (κPy/Octa) GTAATTTACTTCCTTATTTGATGACTCCTTTGCATAGAT, bp −97 to −59, of the Vκ19 promoter; the SV40 PU box, bp −321 to −298, CTCTGAAAGAGGAACTTGGTTAGG; the pyrimidine-rich motifs of the V1 promoter, TAATAACTTCACTCTCTACAACTT; the V101 promoter, GCTCATTGCTTCCTTTTATTCTGA; the V37A4 promoter, CTCTAGTTTCTTCTTCTCCAGCTGGAATG; the V37A11 promoter, CCAGTAGTTCTCCTGCTCAATTAG; the Vκ105 promoter, CTATATAACTCTTCCTTCTATACTGCAACAC; the V12G-1 promoter, CCTTTTCACCTCTCCATACAGAGGC; and the VκA19 CCCATTGACTCTTTCCACACCACTGC. The pyrimidine-rich sequences as well as the purine-rich motif are in boldface type, and the mutated sequence is indicated with an asterisk (∗). All oligonucleotides were purified by electrophoresis on 12% denaturing acrylamide gels. For methylation interference analysis a 24-bp fragment extending from bp −97 to −74 of the Vκ19 promoter was subcloned into the EcoRV site of the pBluescript KS vector. The resulting plasmid was then linearized with either EcoRI or SalI, treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim), 5′-end-labeled with [ γ - 32 P]ATP by polynucleotide kinase (BioLabs) and recut with the second restriction enzyme. Labeled DNA fragments were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These probes were partially methylated for 8 min at room temperature with 1 μl of dimethyl sulfate. As compared with the standard gel shift assay, each preparative scale binding reaction was scaled up 10-fold in BJA-B nuclear extract or in vitro-translated PU.1, 5-fold in poly(dI-dC), and 100-fold in probe. After electrophoretic gel shift and transfer to DE81 paper, the bound and the free DNA were isolated, eluted with 1 M NaCl, Tris-EDTA, and precipitated with ethanol. For the G > A cleavage reaction the DNA pellet was dissolved in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7), heated for 15 min at 90°C, cooled subsequently, and heated again for 20 min at 90°C in 0.1 M sodium hydroxide. The samples were neutralized with 1 volume of 0.1 M acetic acid and subsequently precipitated with ethanol. The G + A piperidine cleavage reaction (Maxam and Gilbert method) of the probe and the G > A reaction were analyzed on a 12% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gel. After electrophoretic gel shift was performed as described above, copper-phenanthroline footprinting reaction was carried out in the polyacrylamide matrix by the method described by Kuwabara et al.(42Kuwabara M.D. Sigman D.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7234-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Reporter plasmids were constructed by cloning the following double-stranded oligonucleotides containing various binding sites (in boldface type) into the SacI and SalI sites of the OVEC vector (43Westin G. Gerster T. Müller M.M. Schaffner G. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6787-6798Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) immediately upstream of the β-globin gene TATA box: κPy/Octa (bp −101 to −41), CTGTGTAATTTACTTCCTTATTTGATGACTCCTTTGCATAGATCCCTAGAGGCCAGCACAG; κPy∗/Octa, CTGTGTAATTTACTCGAGTATTTGATGACTCCTTTGCATA G A T CCCTAGAGGCCAGCACAG; κPy/Octa∗, CTGTGTAATTTACTTCCTTATTTGATGACTCCTGTTCAGAGATCCCTAGAGGCCAGCACAG; κPy∗/Octa∗, CTGTGTAATTTACTCGAGTATTTGATGACTCCTGTTCAGAGATCCCTAGAGGCCAGCACAG; κPy (bp −93 to −73), CTTTACTTCCTTATTTGATGACTG of the Vκ19 promoter; SV40 PU box, CAACCTCTGAAAGAGGAACTTGGG; SV40 PU box inverse, CCCAAGTTCCTCTTTCAGAGGTTG. The mutated motifs are indicated with an asterisk (∗). The Oct-2 expression vector pOEV1 has been described previously(12Müller M.M. Ruppert S. Schaffner W. Matthias P. Nature. 1988; 336: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The PU.1 expression plasmid was constructed by cloning the PU.1 cDNA into the SmaI and XbaI sites of the vector pEVRF-2 (44Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schreiber E. Rusconi S. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) 3′ of the cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter and herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase leader. All clones were verified by DNA sequencing. The mouse S194 and the human Namalwa B cell lines were grown to a density of 2 × 107 cells in 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium and transfected by the DEAE-dextran procedure (10Gerster T. Matthias P. Thali M. Jiricny J. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1323-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) with 4 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.8 μg of reference plasmid (Ovec-Ref). The human epithelial carcinoma cell line HeLa was grown to a confluency of 60-70% in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedure with 20 μg of DNA (6 μg of reporter plasmid, 0.8 μg of reference plasmid, 4 μg of either expression plasmid or sonicated salmon sperm DNA and made up to 20 μg with sonicated salmon sperm DNA). 16-20 h after DNA addition, transfected HeLa cells were shocked with 25% dimethyl sulfoxide. 48 h after transfection, cytoplasmic RNA was extracted(10Gerster T. Matthias P. Thali M. Jiricny J. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1323-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). 20-40 μg of RNA was used for hybridization to a radioactive complementary strand RNA probe (covering positions −19 to 227 of the hybrid gene). Hybridization was performed at 37°C overnight. Hybridization products were digested with 6.5 mg/ml RNase A and 10 units/ml RNase T1 at 37°C for 1 h and subsequently separated on a 6% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gel. The quantification of the radioactive bands was performed with a PhosphorImager. The signals derived from the reference transcripts were used to normalize the variability in transfection efficiency. To determine which factors can bind to the pyrimidine-rich motif of Ig promoters, we prepared a probe derived from the Vκ19 light chain gene, an Ig gene expressed in plasmacytoma MPC11 cells (45Mather E.L. Perry R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4689-4693Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 46Schibler U. Marcu K.B. Perry R.P. Cell. 1978; 15: 1495-1509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and containing a promoter with an imperfect octamer site (7 out of 8; see Fig. 4, bottom). We chose this promoter because previous studies had shown that a potentially novel factor was binding to that site(32Atchison M.L. Delmas V. Perry R.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3109-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and we wanted to confirm and extend these original studies. When this probe (κPy) covering the pyrimidine-rich site of the Vκ19 promoter was incubated with B cell nuclear extract, two prominent specific complexes were detected by EMSA, as shown in Fig. 1A. Binding was competed by the addition of increased amounts of the cognate oligonucleotide (lanes 2-4) but not by oligonucleotide containing a mutated pyrimidine-rich motif (κPy∗, lanes 5-7), indicating that both complexes were binding specifically. The faster migrating complex (C2) was especially prominent in the cell line used in Fig. 1A (BJA-B, a human mature B cell line) and was easily detectable under our standard EMSA conditions, whereas the upper complex (C1) was only easily detectable when spermine was included in the binding buffer. For that reason all subsequent experiments included spermine in the binding reactions. The third weak complex of intermediate mobility could not be competed away by any DNA sequence tested and thus represents nonspecific binding to the probe used. The lowest faint κPy-specific band may represent a complex resulting from partially degraded protein.Figure 1:A, nuclear factors bind to the pyrimidine-rich motif of the Vκ19 promoter. EMSA was performed with a κPy probe covering the pyrimidine-rich site (bp −97 to −74) of the Vκ19 promoter and 4 μg of nuclear extract prepared from BJA-B cells, a human mature B cell line. Increasing amounts (100, 500, 2500 fmol) of unlabeled wild type κPy (lanes 2-4) or mutated κPy (indicated with an asterisk (∗)) oligonucleotide competitor (lanes 5-7) as indicated above were added. Lane 8, probe alone. B, cell line distribution of the Vκ19 promoter binding activities. 4 μg of nuclear extract prepared from a number of non-lymphoid cell lines (lane 1, HeLa; lane 2, Cos7; lane 3, 3T3), pre-B and B cells (lane 4, HAFTL; lane 5, BAF3; lane 6, 38B9; lane 7, PD31; lane 8, 70Z/3; lane 9, NFS5.3; lane 10, Nalm 6; lane 11, Wehi 231; lane 12, Namalwa), T cells (lane 13, YAC1; lane 14, CEM; lane 15, Peer; lane 16, BW5147; lane 17, Molt 4; lane 18, Jurkat), and macrophages (lane 19, U937) was added to an EMSA using the κPy probe. For a description of the cell lines see “Materials and Methods.” The two specific DNA-protein complexes are designated C1 and C2 on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The cell line distribution of these Vκ19 promoter binding activities was investigated by testing nuclear extracts derived from a number of non-lymphoid as well as lymphoid cell lines from mouse or human origin in an EMSA. As shown in Fig. 1B, the slower migrating complex C1 was detected in essentially every extract tested but was found to be enriched in lymphoid cell extracts. In some extracts, this complex was heterogeneous in mobility and comprised two species. The nature of this double band was not further analyzed. The complex C1 may represent the factor originally identified by Atchison et al.(32Atchison M.L. Delmas V. Perry R.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3109-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), since electrophoretic mobility and cell line distribution appear to be similar. The faster migrating complex C2 had a much more restricted distribution and was clearly detected only in extracts from pre-B cells (BAF3, lane 5; PD31, lane 7, and NFS5.3, lane 9) or B cells (Nalm 6, lane 10, and Namalwa, lane 12), as well as in one monocyte/macrophage cell line tested (U937, lane 19). Moreover, an additional band just above the complex C2 was detected in the NFS5.3 nuclear extract (lane 9) but was not further investigated. To characterize the nature of the factors giving rise to complex C1 or C2 we performed competition experiments with a number of oligonucleotides containing binding sites for known factors; some of these results are presented in Fig. 2A, where in particular different purine-rich sequences were tested. As shown, the slowly migrating complex C1 was only competed away by its cognate oligonucleotide (lane 2) and not by oligonucleotides containing a purine-rich (PU) box derived from the simian virus 40 (SV40) enhancer (lane 3), the distal or proximal purine box of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene promoter (lanes 4 and 5), a NF-AT site of the IL-4 gene promoter (lane 6), a CREB site (lane 7), or an Ets-1 or Ets-2 binding site (NFα4) of the T cell receptor α gene enhancer (lane 8)(47Pettersson M.

The fast migrating complex C2, on the other hand, was competed away efficiently by the cognate oligonucleotide and also by the SV40 enhancer-derived purine-rich box (lanes 2 and 3). This oligonucleotide contains a binding site for PU.1(47Pettersson M. Schaffner W. Genes & Dev. 1987; 1: 962-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), a B cell- and macrophage-specific member of the Ets family (35Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), and this raised the possibility that PU.1 or a related factor might be giving rise to complex C2. This hypothesis was further substantiated by the experiment presented in Fig. 2B, where, in addition to the κPy probe, the oligonucleotides containing the mutated Vκ19 pyrimidine-rich site (κPy∗) or the SV40 PU box were labeled radioactively and used as probes for EMSA reactions performed with different nuclear extracts.

INTRODUCTIONThe Ca 2+ -ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum belongs to the ion-translocating ATPases of P-type in which the hydrolysis of ATP is coupled to vectorial transport through formation of an acid-stable phosphoryl aspartyl enzyme intermediate that exists in two major conformational states E1P 1The abbreviations used are: E1PADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme intermediateE1conformation with cytoplasmically facing high affinity Ca 2+ -binding sitesE2conformation with low Ca 2+ affinityE2PADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme intermediateM1-M10putative transmembrane segments numbered from the NH2-terminal end of the peptideS1-S5stalk segments connecting M1-M5 with the cytoplasmic domainsTESN-tris[hydroxymethyl]methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. and E2P (De Meis, 1981; Andersen, 1989). Analysis of the amino acid sequence (MacLennan et al., 1985) along with extensive site-directed mutagenesis studies (MacLennan et al., 1992; Andersen and Vilsen, 1992a) and studies of two-dimensional membrane crystals (Taylor et al., 1986; Toyoshima et al., 1993) have concurred in a structural model for the Ca 2+ -ATPase in which the Ca 2+ binding region is located within a cluster of putative transmembrane α-helices, while the catalytic ATP-binding site is made up from residues in the cytoplasmic domains (Fig. 1). The presence in the Ca 2+ -ATPase of distinct structural entities associated with ATP binding and Ca 2+ binding, respectively, has recently been confirmed by studies of chimeric fusion proteins (Sumbilla et al., 1993; N⊘rregaard et al., 1993). Hence, the energy coupling between scalar and vectorial reactions seems to require long distance communication between the cytoplasmic and transmembrane parts of the pump through conformational changes (Andersen and Vilsen, 1992a). The mutational analysis of the Ca 2+ -ATPase has pinpointed the three transmembrane segments M4, M5, and M6 as central to events associated with Ca 2+ binding and occlusion (Clarke et al., 1989; Andersen and Vilsen, 1992b, 1994; Vilsen and Andersen, 1992d). In addition, this region may be involved in the countertransport of protons (Andersen and Vilsen 1992b, 1994; Vilsen and Andersen, 1992c). An important task is also to locate the amino acid residues responsible for maintenance of the normal physiological coupling of ATP hydrolysis to ion transport, but so far no site-directed mutagenesis data have revealed uncoupled mutants of the Ca 2+ -ATPase.In the present study, the roles of the hydrophobic side chains of Phe 750 , Ile 761 , Tyr 763 , Leu 764 , and Ile 765 located at the border between the fifth transmembrane segment M5 and the putative “stalk” helix S5 have been analyzed by substitution of these residues with glycine. In addition, Leu 764 was replaced by lysine to examine the effect of the positive charge on Ca 2+ binding. These residues are totally conserved among the SERCA-type of Ca 2+ -ATPases. Other cation transporting ATPases of P-type contain motifs that are highly similar although not identical, and the aromatic nature of the residue found at the place of the tyrosine is well conserved (Green, 1989).The results of the functional analysis of the mutants support the notion that these residues are located close to the Ca 2+ binding structure and demonstrate a role of Tyr 763 in ensuring the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to Ca 2+ transport. Hence, the Tyr 763 → Gly mutant catalyzed ATP hydrolysis at a high rate in the absence of any net accumulation of Ca 2+ in the vesicles.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe construction and expression of mutant cDNAs as well as most of the methods employed in the analysis of enzyme function have previously been described in detail (Maruyama and MacLennan, 1988; Andersen et al., 1989; Andersen and Vilsen, 1992b; Vilsen et al., 1989, 1991; Vilsen and Andersen, 1992b). In brief, mutations were introduced into the rabbit fast twitch muscle Ca 2+ -ATPase cDNA using the site-specific mutagenesis method of Kunkel(1985). The presence of the correct mutation was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing according to Sanger et al.(1977). The entire Ca 2+ -ATPase cDNA containing the desired mutation was cloned into vector pMT2 (Kaufman et al., 1989) for expression in COS-1 cells (Gluzman, 1981). Microsomes were prepared from transfected cells, and the expression of exogenous Ca 2+ -ATPase protein was quantitated by a specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Andersen et al., 1989).ATP-driven 45 Ca 2+ uptake in the microsomes was measured by Millipore filtration (Vilsen et al., 1989) following incubation of 0.05-0.2 μg of Ca 2+ -ATPase protein at 37°C for 1-30 min (depending on the specific transport rate) in medium containing 20 mM MOPS, pH 6.8, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM ATP, 0.5 mM EGTA, 5 mM potassium oxalate, 105 Bq 45 Ca 2+ /ml, and various concentrations of 40 CaCl2 to set the concentrations of free Ca 2+ at the desired values according to calculations using published stability constants for Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ complexes of EGTA, ATP, and oxalate (Sillén and Martell, 1964; Fabiato and Fabiato, 1979; Dupont, 1982; Vilsen and Andersen, 1987). A Ca 2+ -selective electrode (Radiometer F2002) was used to adjust free Ca 2+ concentrations above 10 μM. All solutions were prepared freshly before use and kept at 37°C to avoid precipitation of calcium oxalate. Following subtraction of the background Ca 2+ influx measured with microsomes harvested from cells transfected with vector without insert, the rate of Ca 2+ uptake was calculated from the linear part of the curves showing Ca 2+ uptake as a function of time (see inset in Fig. 2).Figure 2:Ca 2+ dependence of the rate of ATP-driven Ca 2+ uptake in the microsomal vesicles. Ca 2+ uptake was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” at 37°C in the presence of oxalate, and the molecular turnover rate was calculated as the ratio between the rate of Ca 2+ uptake/mg of microsomal protein (μmol of Ca 2+ transported/min/mg of microsomal protein) and the phosphorylation capacity (nmol/mg of microsomal protein). The ordinate shows this number as percentage of that measured for the wild-type Ca 2+ -ATPase at 10 μM Ca 2+ . The inset shows examples of the time curves from which the rates were calculated, at pCa 3.8 for the wild-type and mutant Phe 750 → Gly and pCa 3.7 for mutant Tyr 763 → Gly. □, wild-type Ca 2+ -ATPase; ▴ , mutant Phe 750 → Gly; ▵, mutant Ile 761 → Gly; ▿, mutant Tyr 763 → Gly; ⋄ , mutant Leu 764 → Gly; ▪ , mutant Ile 765 → Gly.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The rate of ATP hydrolysis was measured spectrophotometrically at 37°C by the NADH-coupled assay described by Vilsen et al.(1991), in the presence of 0.15 mM NADH, 1 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, lactate dehydrogenase (approximately 10 IU/ml), and pyruvate kinase (approximately 10 IU/ml). Additional components included in the standard medium used in most experiments were 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MgATP, 1 mM EGTA, 1 μM of the calcium ionophore A23187, and various concentrations of CaCl2 to set the desired concentrations of free Ca 2+ . The ATPase activity referable to the Ca 2+ -ATPase was calculated following subtraction of the rate of ATP hydrolysis measured in the absence of free Ca 2+ (presence of 2 mM excess EGTA). MgATP concentration dependence was titrated as in Vilsen et al. (1991) keeping the free Mg 2+ concentration constant at 1 mM and the free Ca 2+ concentration at 100 μM. Inhibition by various concentrations of vanadate was tested in the presence of 100 μM Ca 2+ and 5 mM MgATP as described in Vilsen and Andersen (1992b).The molecular turnover rates were calculated using the maximum amount of phosphoenzyme formed from ATP (see below) as a measure of the concentration of active enzyme sites present. In the figures these rates are presented as percentage of the maximum molecular turnover rate observed with the wild-type Ca 2+ -ATPase.The phosphoenzyme intermediates formed in the presence of [ γ - 32 P]ATP or 32 Pi were quantitated as a function of Ca 2+ concentration following acid quenching at steady state. The phosphorylation from [ γ - 32 P]ATP was carried out at 0°C for 15 s in the presence of 50 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, 80 mM K + , 5 mM Mg 2+ , 2 μM [ γ - 32 P]ATP, 1 mM EGTA, and CaCl2 to set the indicated free Ca 2+ concentrations. To study the rate of dephosphorylation of the E1P phosphoenzyme intermediate in the absence of Ca 2+ accumulation in the vesicles, 1 μM of the calcium ionophore A23187 was added to the standard phosphorylation medium. Phosphorylation was terminated by the addition of excess EGTA (1 mM), with or without 1 mM ADP, followed by acid quenching at serial time intervals. Similar experiments were carried out following phosphorylation in a medium designed to accumulate the E2P phosphoenzyme intermediate (Andersen et al., 1989; Vilsen et al., 1989). This medium contained 100 mM TES/Tris buffer, pH 8.35, 10 mM Mg 2+ , 50 μM Ca 2+ , and 2 μM [ γ - 32 P]ATP. Phosphorylation from 32 Pi to form E2P in the “backdoor” reaction was carried out for 10 min at 25°C in the presence of 100 μM 32 Pi, 100 mM TES/Tris, pH 7.0, 5 mM Mg 2+ , 20% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, and the indicated Ca 2+ concentrations set with EGTA. Dimethyl sulfoxide was added to increase the apparent affinity of the Ca 2+ -ATPase for Pi (De Meis et al., 1980) so that the phosphorylation level was close to maximum in the absence of Ca 2+ . To study the rate of dephosphorylation of E2P formed from 32 Pi, the phosphorylated sample was cooled to 0°C. The phosphorylation was then terminated by a 20-fold dilution of the sample into ice-cold medium containing 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 80 mM K + , 5 mM Mg 2+ , 1 mM non-radioactive Pi, 2 mM EGTA, no dimethyl sulfoxide, followed by acid quenching at serial times.The phosphorylated acid-precipitated microsomal protein was washed and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 6.0, followed by autoradiography of the dried gels and quantitation by densitometric analysis, using an LKB 2202 Ultroscan Laser Densitometer, or by liquid scintillation counting of gel slices. The latter procedure was used to obtain the absolute site concentration needed for calculation of molecular turnover rate.All experiments were repeated at least three times with consistent results. The data points shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 4, and Fig. 5 are mean values of triplicate determinations. S.D. is indicated when larger than 5%.Figure 4:Ca 2+ dependence of ATPase activity. The ATPase activity was measured in the presence of 1 μM calcium ionophore as described under “Experimental Procedures” and illustrated in Fig. 3. The molecular turnover rate was calculated as the ratio between the rate of ATP hydrolysis/mg of microsomal protein and the phosphorylation capacity/mg of microsomal protein. The ordinate shows this number as percentage of that measured for the wild-type Ca 2+ -ATPase at 50 μM Ca 2+ and 5 mM MgATP. The concentration of free Ca 2+ vas varied at a constant MgATP concentration of 5 mM. □, wild-type Ca 2+ -ATPase; ▴ , mutant Phe 750 → Gly; ▿, mutant Tyr 763 → Gly; ⋄ , mutant Leu 764 → Gly; ▪ , mutant Ile 765 → Gly.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5:Ca 2+ concentration dependence of phosphorylation from [ γ - 32 P]ATP or 32 Pi.

Mutants Phe 750 → Gly, Ile 761 → Gly, Leu 764 → Gly, and Ile 765 → Gly were expressed to levels ranging between 72 and 123% that of the wild-type Ca 2+ -ATPase in five transfections. The expression levels of mutants Tyr 763 → Gly and Leu 764 → Lys were significantly lower, ranging between 23 and 56% that of the wild-type in seven transfections. Only preparations corresponding to relative expression levels higher than 30% that of the wild-type were used for the functional characterization described below.To be able to measure the rate of ATP-driven Ca 2+ transport into the microsomal vesicles containing expressed Ca 2+ -ATPase, in the presence of the background of passive diffusion of Ca 2+ into all vesicles in the preparation, oxalate is usually added to the reaction mixture. The precipitation of Ca 2+ oxalate at the high Ca 2+ concentrations generated inside the vesicles during active transport traps the calcium ions, thereby increasing the capacity for active Ca 2+ accumulation. Fig. 2 shows the results of measurement of the specific Ca 2+ transport turnover rates of mutants Phe 750 → Gly, Ile 761 → Gly, Tyr 763 → Gly, Leu 764 → Gly, and Ile 765 → Gly, in the presence of oxalate. In mutant Ile 761 → Gly, the maximal transport rate measured at saturating Ca 2+ concentration and the apparent Ca 2+ affinity were rather similar to those of the wild-type Ca 2+ -ATPase. On the other hand, the maximal transport rates of mutants Leu 764 → Gly and Ile 765 → Gly were reduced below 15% that of the wild-type precluding an accurate determination of the Ca 2+ affinities of these mutants. Mutant Phe 750 → Gly was clearly able to transport Ca 2+ at a higher rate, but since this mutant displayed very low apparent Ca 2+ affinity (K0.5 above 50 μM, see Fig. 2), it was not straightforward to determine its maximum Ca 2+ -uptake activity. Hence, at high medium Ca 2+ concentrations Ca 2+ oxalate crystals are formed not only inside the vesicles, but also outside, giving rise to a high filter background. For this reason, we have previously been unable to measure the oxalate-supported Ca 2+ uptake with accuracy at free Ca 2+ concentrations higher than 10-30 μM, but in the present study it was found that the high filter background can be avoided up to a free Ca 2+ concentration of about 200 μM (determined using the Ca 2+ selective electrode), provided the supersaturated Ca 2+ -oxalate solutions are prepared immediately before use and the Ca 2+ uptake measured at 37°C instead of at 27°C as previously. As seen in Fig. 2, these precautions permitted the measurement of ATP-driven Ca 2+ transport in mutant Phe 750 → Gly at Ca 2+ concentrations up to 200 μM Ca 2+ . At this Ca 2+ concentration, the turnover rate corresponded to about 50% that of the maximum turnover rate of the wild-type.Fig. 2 also shows that mutant Tyr 763 → Gly was unable to transport Ca 2+ at a measurable rate at all Ca 2+ concentrations up to the experimental limit of 200 μM. Even after 30 min of incubation at 200 μM Ca 2+ in the presence of 5 mM MgATP, it was not possible to measure any Ca 2+ uptake higher than the background corresponding to control microsomal preparations harvested from cells that had been mock-transfected with the vector without insert. In addition, the mutant with positively charged substituent, Leu 764 → Lys, was unable to transport Ca 2+ at Ca 2+ concentrations up to 200 μM (not shown).Ca 2+ -activated ATPase ActivitySteady state Ca 2+ -ATPase activity was measured spectrophotometrically using the NADH-coupled assay system with ATP regeneration from phosphoenolpyruvate (Vilsen et al., 1991), in the absence and in the presence of the calcium ionophore A23187. Fig. 3 shows examples of such measurements carried out at 100 μM Ca 2+ . The decrease of absorbance at 340 nm reflects hydrolysis of ATP. In these experiments there was no oxalate present to precipitate Ca 2+ inside the vesicles, and it is seen that in the wild-type enzyme as well as in mutant Phe 750 → Gly the ATPase activity increased significantly upon addition of the calcium ionophore. This is the result of relieving the back-inhibition exerted by accumulated Ca 2+ present at millimolar concentration inside the vesicles (De Meis, 1981). Surprisingly, a high Ca 2+ -activated ATPase activity was measured with mutant Tyr 763 → Gly, even though this mutant was found unable to accumulate Ca 2+ in the presence of oxalate as described above. Consistent with the lack of Ca 2+ accumulation in mutant Tyr 763 → Gly, there was no back-inhibition of ATP hydrolysis in this mutant, as evidenced by the absence of an activatory effect of the calcium ionophore (Fig. 3). Hence, in mutant Tyr 763 → Gly the ATPase activity appeared to be uncoupled from Ca 2+ transport. Fig. 4 depicts the results of measurements of specific ATPase turnover rates in the presence of the calcium ionophore at various concentrations of Ca 2+ . The maximum ATPase turnover rate of mutant Tyr 763 → Gly was similar to that measured for the wild-type Ca 2+ -ATPase in the presence of ionophore. The apparent Ca 2+ affinity of mutant Tyr 763 → Gly was slightly reduced relative to that of the wild-type, saturation being reached at about 10 μM Ca 2+ . In mutant Phe 750 → Gly the apparent Ca 2+ affinity determined from Ca 2+ titration of ATPase activity was much more strongly reduced, consistent with the data for Ca 2+ activation of Ca 2+ transport shown in Fig. 2. Mutants Leu 764 → Gly and Ile 765 → Gly displayed rather low maximum ATPase activities. It is noteworthy, however, that the maximum ATPase activity of mutant Leu 764 → Gly was higher than that of mutant Ile 765 → Gly, while the corresponding maximum Ca 2+ uptake activity of mutant Leu 764 → Gly was lower than that of mutant Ile 765 → Gly (compare Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:). It also appears, therefore, as if mutant Leu 764 → Gly may have been uncoupled to some extent. Mutant Leu 764 → Lys was completely unable to hydrolyze ATP, even at a Ca 2+ concentration of 1 mM (not shown).Figure 3:Ionophore sensitivity of Ca 2+ -activated ATPase activity. ATP hydrolysis was monitored spectrophotometrically by the NADH-coupled assay described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence of 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MgATP, and 100 μM Ca 2+ . The ordinate shows absorbance at 340 nm. The bar in the lower left corner indicates 0.1 absorbance unit. At 1, the microsomes were added. At 2, 1 μM of the calcium ionophore was added to relieve back-inhibition by accumulated Ca 2+ . At 3, EGTA was added to show the background ATPase activity not referable to Ca 2+ -ATPase.

The activation curve for the Tyr 763 → Gly mutant was almost superposable on that of the wild-type, and like the wild-type Ca 2+ -ATPase, all the mutants displayed a biphasic activation pattern with a secondary rise in the millimolar concentration range indicative of a role for ATP as an allosteric modulator in addition to its role as substrate (Andersen, 1989). In addition, it was found that all mutants, including Tyr 763 → Gly, were sensitive to inhibition by vanadate.Phosphorylation from ATP and PiLike the wild-type Ca 2+ -ATPase, all the mutants discussed here were able to become phosphorylated from ATP provided the concentration of Ca 2+ was high enough and from Pi in the absence of Ca 2+ . The ATP concentration dependence of phosphorylation from ATP of the mutants was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type, with K0.5 for ATP below 1 μM (not shown). The Ca 2+ dependence of phosphorylation from ATP is shown in Fig. 5A. The uncoupled mutant Tyr 763 → Gly displayed an apparent Ca 2+ affinity only slightly lower than that of the wild-type. The apparent Ca 2+ affinities of mutants Leu 764 → Gly and Ile 765 → Gly were also quite similar to that of the wild-type. In accordance with the results of Ca 2+ titration of Ca 2+ transport and Ca 2+ -ATPase activity, the apparent Ca 2+ affinity of mutant Phe 750 → Gly determined in the phosphorylation assay with ATP was at least 100-fold lower than that of the wild-type. Mutant Leu 764 → Lys displayed even lower Ca 2+ affinity in the phosphorylation assay with a K0.5 value above 10 mM, thus explaining the above described inability of this mutant to transport Ca 2+ and utilize ATP at submillimolar Ca 2+ concentrations.Studies of the inhibition by Ca 2+ of the backdoor phosphorylation from Pi may provide additional information on the function of the Ca 2+ sites (Andersen and Vilsen, 1992b, 1994). The results of such experiments are depicted in Fig. 5B. A comparison with Fig. 5A indicates that the apparent Ca 2+ affinities determined in the two types of phosphorylation assay were fairly consistent, except in the case of mutant Phe 750 → Gly. The apparent Ca 2+ affinity observed by titration of Ca 2+ inhibition of Pi phosphorylation in this mutant was almost identical to that of the wild-type, in contrast to the low Ca 2+ affinity observed in the study of Ca 2+ activation of phosphorylation from ATP. Because the Ca 2+ -ATPase is thought to bind two calcium ions in a consecutive mechanism, and only the first binding site has to be occupied to inhibit phosphorylation from Pi, a possible explanation of the discrepancy between the apparent Ca 2+ affinities determined in the two types of phosphorylation assay with mutant Phe 750 → Gly is that Phe 750 is directly or indirectly involved in the binding of the second calcium ion, but not in the binding of the first calcium ion in the sequence (Andersen and Vilsen, 1992b, 1994).Dephosphorylation of the Phosphoenzyme IntermediateSince the turnover rates of mutants Leu 764 → Gly and Ile 765 → Gly were found to be much reduced at concentrations of Ca 2+ and ATP that were sufficient to saturate the phosphorylation reaction, it seemed that a partial reaction following the phosphorylation must have been defective in these mutants. In the normal Ca 2+ -ATPase reaction cycle, the first phosphoenzyme intermediate formed is E1P, which is ADP sensitive, i.e. able to donate the phosphoryl group back to ADP forming ATP (De Meis, 1981). This intermediate traps the calcium ions in an occluded state with no direct access to the medium on either side of the membrane (Glynn and Karlish, 1990; McIntosh et al., 1991; Vilsen and Andersen, 1992a). The release of Ca 2+ at the luminal side of the membrane is believed to be coupled with the transition to a second phosphoenzyme intermediate, E2P, which is ADP insensitive. The latter intermediate appears to be identical to the phosphoenzyme intermediate formed in the backdoor reaction with Pi (De Meis, 1981). The cycle is normally terminated by the hydrolysis of the acylphosphate bond in E2P and the release of Pi. Fig. 6, A and B, depict the results of experiments in which the stabilities of the E1P and E2P phosphoenzyme intermediates were examined. Phosphorylation was carried out either with ATP (Fig. 6A), under conditions where the E1P intermediate accumulates in the wild-type (Andersen et al., 1989; Vilsen et al., 1989), or with Pi to obtain E2P (Fig. 6B). After the steady state had been reached during phosphorylation with ATP, the ADP sensitivity of the phosphoenzyme was tested (lane 2 in Fig. 6A), or the dephosphorylation in the forward direction was studied following addition of EGTA to terminate the phosphorylation by chelation of Ca 2+ (lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 6A). In the wild-type Ca 2+ -ATPase, the phosphoenzyme disappears rapidly upon addition of either ADP or EGTA, as has previously been demonstrated (Andersen et al., 1989; Vilsen et al., 1989). As seen in Fig. 6A, a rapid dephosphorylation from E1P similar to that of the wild-type was observed with mutants Phe 750 → Gly, Ile 761 → Gly, and Tyr 763 → Gly, consistent with their abilities to hydrolyze ATP at a high rate. In mutant Leu 764 → Gly, the rate of disappearance of the phosphoenzyme in the presence of EGTA without ADP was reduced relative to that of the wild-type. The block of dephosphorylation was even more pronounced in mutant Ile 765 → Gly. The latter mutant was also partially insensitive to ADP. Under conditions where dephosphorylation in the forward direction of the reaction cycle is blocked, such as seen with mutant Ile 765 → Gly, the amount of phosphoenzyme remaining after the 5-s chase with ADP reflects the amount of E2P accumulated in steady state. The accumulation of a significant amount of E2P in mutant Ile 765 → Gly under conditions where the E1P intermediate prevails in the wild-type enzyme suggests that the high stability of the phosphoenzyme of mutant Ile 765 → Gly observed in the EGTA chase was due to a block of the dephosphorylation of E2P. This hypothesis was confirmed in the experiments shown in Fig. 6B, in which the dephosphorylation of E2P was followed directly after termination of the phosphorylation with 32 Pi by dilution of the phosphorylated samples in excess non-radioactive Pi. Again the mutants Phe 750 → Gly and Ile 761 → Gly dephosphorylated rapidly, while the dephosphorylation was strongly blocked in mutant Ile 765 → Gly. In addition, the dephosphorylation of E2P in mutant Leu 764 → Gly was partially blocked. The ability to dephosphorylate rapidly was, however, regained upon exchange of the glycine at position 764 with lysine. It is also seen that the rate of dephosphorylation of E2P was slightly reduced in the uncoupled mutant Tyr 763 → Gly.Figure 6:Dephosphorylation of the phosphoenzyme intermediates formed from [ γ - 32 P]ATP or 32 Pi.

Following 15-s reaction with [ γ - 32 P]ATP, the sample was acid-quenched directly (lane 1), or incubated with 1 mM ADP and 1 mM EGTA for 5 s (lane 2), or with 1 mM EGTA without ADP for 5 s (lane 3) or 10 s (lane 4), prior to acid-quenching.

https://openalex.org/W2073489998,"Chemical modification approaches combined with site-directed and deletion mutagenesis have been used to identify functionally critical regions/residues of recombinant human IL-11 (rhIL-11). Incubation of rhIL-11 with iodoacetic acid results in specific alkylation of a single methionine residue, Met 58 , and a 25-fold reduction of in vitro biological activity on mouse plasmacytoma cells. A similar decrease in activity is observed when Met 58 is substituted with Ala, Leu, Gln, Glu, or Lys by site-directed mutagenesis. Treatment of rhIL-11 with succinic anhydride leads to modification of the amino-terminal amino group and partial labeling of 2 lysines, Lys 41 and Lys 98 , and to a 3-fold decrease in activity. The activity losses can be attributed to modification of the lysine residues, since the succinyl derivative of the amino terminus is fully active. In addition, carboxyl-terminal deletion mutagenesis studies have demonstrated that removal of the last 4 residues reduces rhIL-11 activity 25-fold, whereas removal of 8 or more amino acids results in an inactive molecule. Based on secondary structure predictions and the location of exon/intron boundaries in the IL-11 genomic structure, we propose a four-helix bundle topology as a structural model for rhIL-11. This model has been tested by limited proteolysis using three side chain-specific endoproteinases. A limited number of protease-sensitive cleavage sites are present in rhIL-11, and all but two are located in the postulated helix interconnecting loops or at helix termini. α-Helices, which in the proposed structure form a compact core of the molecule, are inaccessible to digestion under limiting conditions. According to the model, Met 58 , Lys 41 and Lys 98 are located on the surface of the molecule, in agreement with their preferential accessibility to chemical modification. By analogy with human growth hormone, we postulate that Met 58 and the carboxyl terminus of rhIL-11 are involved in the primary receptor binding site (site I), whereas Lys 41 and Lys 98 may be a part of binding site II.

https://openalex.org/W2053423336,"During murine oogenesis, the zona pellucida proteins (ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3) are synthesized and secreted to form an extracellular matrix that surrounds the oocyte and mediates specific biological functions essential to mammalian fertilization and early development. To investigate the relationship among the zona proteins during zona matrix assembly, we have undertaken to inhibit de novo biosynthesis of specific zona proteins with antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the 5′-ends of ZP2 (nucleotide position 19-42) and ZP3 (nucleotide 21-44) mRNAs. When injected into the cytoplasm of growing mouse oocytes, the antisense oligonucleotides targeted specific zona mRNAs for degradation, as confirmed by a RNase protection assay. Individual zona pellucida protein synthesis was followed by immunoprecipitation with ZP2- and ZP3-specific monoclonal antibodies. New zona protein synthesis from the targeted mRNA was abolished, but nontargeted zona protein continued to be synthesized. Interestingly, abolishment of either ZP2 or ZP3 protein synthesis prevented the incorporation of the other protein into the extracellular zona matrix. These results suggest that ZP2 and ZP3 proteins are independent of each other in their biosynthesis but are dependent upon each other for their incorporation into the zona pellucida matrix.

This study provides an experimental system in which destruction of a targeted mRNA generates a transient loss-of-expression phenotype during mouse oocyte growth. The zona pellucida is an extracellular matrix that surrounds mammalian oocytes and mediates initial sperm-egg interactions at fertilization. The mouse zona is composed of three sulfated glycoproteins, ZP1 1The abbreviations used are: ZPzona pellucidaTABTyrode's acidic bufferPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisNtnucleotide(s). (180-200 kDa), ZP2 (120-140 kDa), and ZP3 (83 kDa)(1Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Dev. Biol. 1980; 76: 185-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 2Shimizu S. Tsuji M. Dean J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5858-5863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each mouse zona contains 3-5 ng of protein, and approximately 1 μg of zona can be isolated from a mouse ovary. This paucity of biological material effectively precludes detailed biochemical analysis of native mouse zona proteins. However, the primary structure of two mouse zona proteins has been deduced from full-length cDNAs of the cognate genes(3Liang L.-F. Chamow S.M. Dean J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 4Ringuette M.J. Chamberlin M.E. Baur A.W. Sobieski D.A. Dean J. Dev.

Each protein has a signal peptide to direct it into a secretory pathway where it undergoes posttranslational glycosylation; each has a 20-30-amino acid hydrophobic domain near its carboxyl terminus capable of forming a transmembrane domain. Their primary structures suggest little, if any, other similarity between the two proteins. zona pellucida Tyrode's acidic buffer polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis nucleotide(s). The three zona proteins are assembled into a matrix that first appears in the early stages of oocyte growth and eventually forms a 7-8-μm-thick coat surrounding fully grown oocytes, which is distinct from the plasma membrane. Electron microscopic observations indicate that the zona is a relatively homogeneous meshwork(5Phillips D.M. Shalgi R. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1980; 72: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the pore size of which allows the passage of viral particles(6Gwatkin R.B. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1967; 13: 577-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this mesh is composed of long filaments (1:1 dimers of ZP2 and ZP3) cross-linked by ZP1, a disulfide-bonded dimeric protein (7Greve J.M. Wassarman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of zona assembly and the structural relationships between the zona proteins during this process. There are no reported null mutations in the mouse zona pellucida genes that would allow an analysis of the biosynthesis of one zona protein in the absence of another. Therefore, to examine the influence of each of the zona proteins on the de novo formation of the zona matrix, we have used antisense oligonucleotides to target either ZP2 or ZP3 transcripts in growing mouse oocytes. The specific degradation of either mRNA effectively abolishes the biosynthesis of the corresponding protein. We find that the inhibition of either ZP2 or ZP3 protein synthesis prevents the incorporation of the other protein into the extracellular zona matrix of growing mouse oocytes. Growing mouse oocytes were dissected from ovaries of 14-day-old NIH Swiss mice in HEPES-modified Brinster's media containing bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml) and sodium pyruvate (30 μg/ml). 45-50-μm diameter oocytes, collected by micropipette, were washed with M199 media and transferred into complete M199-M media (Earle's modified medium 199, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 30 μg/ml sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.)) for further processing. Approximately 100 oocytes were incubated in 100 μl of complete M199-M media under paraffin oil (37°C, 5% CO2). For radiolabeling of protein, oocytes were cultured for 16 h in methionine- and cysteine-free M199-M media (Special Media Inc.) supplemented with [ 35 35 S]methionine (517 Ci/mmol, ICN) and [ 35 35 S]cysteine (1084 Ci/mmol, ICN) each at a final concentration of 0.5 mCi/ml. Antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized (DNA Synthesizer, Applied Biosystems, model 380B), purified on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (1 μg/μl). Three antisense oligonucleotides (24 Nt) were utilized for microinjection: 5′-CACCAGCAGGCAGTGGGACAGGAG-3′, complementary to rabbit α-globin mRNA (Nt 330-354)(8Dash P. Lotan I. Knapp M. Kandel E.R. Goelet P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7896-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar); 5′-CCACCTCGCCATGTTGGAAGGTAC-3′, complementary to mouse ZP2 mRNA (Nt 19-42)(3Liang L.-F. Chamow S.M. Dean J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar); and 5′-ATAGCTTGACGCCATGGTCCCGCC-3′, complementary to mouse ZP3 (Nt 21-44)(4Ringuette M.J. Chamberlin M.E. Baur A.W. Sobieski D.A. Dean J. Dev. Biol. 1988; 127: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Approximately 10 pg of each oligonucleotide (10 pl) were injected into the cytoplasm of individual oocytes with a microinjector (Eppendorf, model 5242). After injection, the oocytes were washed twice with the culture medium and transferred into fresh complete M199-M medium for further incubation as described above. In vitro transcription was performed following the experimental protocol provided in a RNA transcription kit (Stratagene). Full-length mouse ZP2 and ZP3 cDNAs subcloned into plasmid pBluescript KS II (3Liang L.-F. Chamow S.M. Dean J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 4Ringuette M.J. Chamberlin M.E. Baur A.W. Sobieski D.A. Dean J. Dev. Biol. 1988; 127: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) were used as templates. After linearization of the plasmid, ZP2 and ZP3 mRNAs were synthesized using T7 and T3 RNA polymerase, respectively. Synthetic mRNAs were intact as judged by electrophoresis in denaturing formamide agarose gels. Templates for antisense RNA were obtained by subcloning ZP2 (34-481 base pairs) and ZP3 (28-233 base pairs) into pBluescript KS II. After linearization, antisense ZP2 and ZP3 RNA probes were prepared by incorporation of [α- 32 32 P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol, ICN) into the transcripts using T7 RNA polymerase. Unincorporated [α- 32 32 P]UTP was removed by precipitation of RNA probes with 0.5 M sodium acetate and 70% ethanol. The ZP2 (503 Nt) and ZP3 (257 Nt) probes contain 447 and 205 nucleotides complementary to their respective transcripts; additional sequences at the 5′-end of each probe were derived from plasmid sequences. A RNase protection assay II kit (Ambion Inc.) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to detect ZP2 and ZP3 transcripts. Fifty oocytes were dissolved in 10 μl of 5 M guanidine thiocyanate (9Haines D.S. Gillespie D.H. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 736-741PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed immediately or stored at −70°C. Antisense RNA probes for ZP2 and ZP3 were diluted ( ~ 2 × 104 cpm) with hybridization buffer (80% deionized formamide, 100 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.4, 300 mM sodium acetate, pH 6.4, 1 mM EDTA) and incubated for 24 h at 42°C with synthetic ZP2 and ZP3 mRNAs or oocyte lysates in a final volume of 20 μl. Following digestion with RNase A/RNase T1 (0.5 μg/ml RNase A and 10 units/ml RNase T1) for 1 h at 37°C, the samples were precipitated with RNase inactivation/precipitation mixture. The protected fragments were separated on a 4.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. Fragments from pUC19 digested with Sau3AI and labeled with [ γ - 32 32 P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, ICN) using DNA 5′-end labeling system (Promega) were used as molecular weight markers. Zonae pellucidae were selectively solubilized from the 35 35 S-labeled oocytes using Tyrode's acidic buffer (TAB) at pH 2.5 as described previously (10Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.4% polyvinylpyrrolidone and transferred to 10 μl of TAB for microscopic visualization. After 20 s of gentle agitation, the fluid containing solubilized zonae pellucidae was collected. Zona-free oocytes were dissolved by the addition of 10 μl of 1% SDS, 0.125 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. After heating (1 h, 60°C), each sample was diluted with either SDS electrophoresis buffer or immunoprecipitation buffer as described below. Samples of solubilized zonae pellucidae or zona-free oocytes were diluted 100-fold in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml). After incubation (4°C, 2 h) with 10 μl of rat monoclonal antibodies (2 mg/ml) specific to mouse ZP2 (11East I.J. Dean J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and ZP3 (12East I.J. Gulyas B.J. Dean J. Dev. Biol. 1985; 109: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) in a total volume of 500 μl, the zona proteins were precipitated with goat anti-rat IgG conjugated to Sepharose 4B beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide, 3.5% bisacrylamide) and fluorography(13Bonner W.M. Laskey R.A. Eur. J Biochem. 1974; 46: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5621) Google Scholar). Alternatively, after the TAB-solubilized zona proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by electrophoresis at 100 V for 1 h(14Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5906) Google Scholar). The blots were rinsed in Tris-buffered saline buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl) supplemented with 3% bovine serum albumin and incubated with anti-mouse ZP2 and ZP3 monoclonal antibodies (1:1,000) at 4°C for 2 h. The filter was washed with Tris-buffered saline buffer containing 0.2% Tween-20 (3 × 20-min incubations). Using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated sheep anti-rat IgG antibody as a second antibody (diluted 1:1,000), mouse ZP2 and ZP3 proteins were visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium premix solution according to the manufacturer's instruction (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Vertebrate oocytes, as well as most somatic cells, have highly active endogenous RNase H activity(8Dash P. Lotan I. Knapp M. Kandel E.R. Goelet P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7896-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 15Shuttleworth J. Colman A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16O'Keefe S.J. Wolfes H.J.

This property has been exploited experimentally for targeted destruction of specific mRNAs hybridized with antisense oligonucleotides. Although antisense oligonucleotides can inhibit gene expression through multiple mechanisms, mRNA degradation and prevention of protein translation play major roles(17Walder R.Y. Walder J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5011-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 18Agrawal S. Mayrand S.H. Zamecnik P.C. Pederson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1401-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In this study, we monitored the integrity of ZP2 and ZP3 mRNAs and the synthesis of zona proteins in mouse oocytes after injection of antisense oligonucleotides (Fig. 1). Individual growing mouse oocytes, 50 μm in diameter, contain approximately 1 pg of ZP2 and 0.4 pg of ZP3 transcripts(3Liang L.-F. Chamow S.M. Dean J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A simple and sensitive RNase protection assay was developed for detection of both zona mRNAs in a single sample. Synthetic ZP2 and ZP3 transcripts were used to validate the assay (Fig. 2). A 32 32 P-labeled antisense RNA probe specific to ZP2 (Nt 34-481, Fig. 1) was hybridized to full-length ZP2 or ZP3 RNA, digested by RNase A/T1, separated by PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. As expected, a 447-Nt portion of the 503-Nt ZP2 probe was protected from digestion in the presence of ZP2 transcripts (Fig. 2, lane2) but not in the presence of ZP3 transcripts (Fig. 2, lane3). Similarly, a 205-Nt portion of the 257-Nt 32 32 P-labeled, antisense ZP3 RNA probe (Nt 28-233, Fig. 1), was protected from RNase digestion after hybridization with ZP3 transcripts (Fig. 2, lane6) but not ZP2 transcripts (Fig. 2, lane5). For a further validation, the two probes were mixed (Fig. 2, lane7) to demonstrate their ability to target synthetic ZP2 and ZP3 transcripts in a single sample and their ability to distinguish zona transcripts from nonspecific RNA (Fig. 2, lane8). Using this assay, oocyte lysates were then directly hybridized to a mixture of the two antisense RNA probes, and both ZP2 and ZP3 mRNA could be detected in as few as 50 oocytes. The specificity of the assay was confirmed by a comparison of the protected fragments in total RNA isolated from oocyte with those obtained with synthetic ZP2 and ZP3 mRNAs (Fig. 2, lanes9 and 10). Antisense oligonucleotides (24 Nt) complementary to the 5′-region of mouse ZP2 mRNA (Nt 19-42) and ZP3 mRNA (Nt 21-44) were designed to include noncoding and coding regions (Fig. 1). To maintain effective concentrations of antisense oligonucleotides and ensure the complete destruction of targeted endogenous zona transcripts, 10 pg of antisense oligonucleotide(s) were injected into the cytoplasm of each oocyte. This represents at least a 1000-fold molar excess of oligonucleotide to targeted ZP2 and ZP3 mRNA. The RNase protection assay was used to monitor the degradation of ZP2 and ZP3 mRNA in oocytes injected with antisense oligonucleotides. Two hours after injection, the targeted ZP2 and ZP3 mRNAs were reduced in size as compared with the protected fragments of endogenous ZP2 and ZP3 mRNAs in the uninjected oocytes (Fig. 3, lanes2-4). This decrease in size may represent truncation of the targeted mRNA after 2 h by endogenous RNase H or the formation of a DNA:RNA duplex (antisense oligonucleotides/targeted mRNAs) that prevents hybridization of the 3′-end of the RNA probes to the complementary zona transcript (see Fig. 1). In either event, the mRNA would not be available for translation into protein. The levels of the targeted zona mRNAs decreased progressively at 4, 6, and 10 h after injection (data not shown). Although residual amounts of shortened ZP2 were detected even after 16 h (Fig. 3, lane6), neither full-length ZP2 nor ZP3 transcripts were detected in oocytes injected with complementary antisense oligonucleotides (Fig. 3, lanes5-7). Of note is the relative integrity of the nontargeted zona mRNA under these culture conditions. Mouse oocytes cultured in vitro synthesize and secrete ZP2 ( ~ 120 kDa) and ZP3 ( ~ 83 kDa) proteins containing complex-type oligosaccharides(10Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 19Shimizu S. Ito M. Dean J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 109: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). ZP2 is synthesized as an 81-kDa polypeptide chain to which six high mannose-type oligosaccharides are added giving rise to a 91-kDa intermediate. ZP3 is synthesized as a 44-kDa polypeptide chain to which three or four high mannose-type oligosaccharides are added to form 53- and 56-kDa intermediates, respectively. Most or all of the N-linked oligosaccharides are then processed to complex-type glycans prior to secretion of the mature glycoproteins into the zona pellucida(20Greve J.M. Salzmann G.S. Roller R.J. Wassarman P.M. Cell. 1982; 31: 749-759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 21Salzmann G.S. Greve J.M. Roller R.J. Wassarman P.M. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1451-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the present study, 50 oocytes were injected with antisense oligonucleotides, allowed to recover for 2-3 h, and then placed in medium containing [ 35 35 S]methionine/cysteine until 16 h after the initial injection. The overall SDS-PAGE profiles of 35 35 S-labeled proteins from uninjected oocytes or oocytes injected with antisense specific to ZP2 or ZP3 mRNA appear to be the same (Fig. 4A). To examine newly synthesized, intracellular zona proteins, the zona pellucida was removed with TAB, and whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies specific to ZP2 and ZP3 (Fig. 4B). Both ZP2 (average, 80 kDa) and ZP3 (average, 55 kDa) precursors were present in the cytoplasm of the uninjected and rabbit α-globin antisense oligonucleotide-injected oocytes (Fig. 4B, lanes2 and 3). The biosynthesis of either ZP2 or ZP3 could be specifically inhibited in oocytes injected with antisense oligonucleotides complementary to ZP2 or ZP3 (Fig. 4B, lanes4 and 5). In each experiment, the nontargeted zona protein continued to be synthesized. Thus, each zona protein appears to be synthesized independent of the other in the oocyte. Once synthesized, zona proteins are normally secreted and assembled into an acellular matrix that surrounds growing oocytes(2Shimizu S. Tsuji M. Dean J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5858-5863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To determine whether the assembly of the zona matrix was affected by preventing de novo synthesis of either ZP2 or ZP3, the zona pellucida surrounding the cultured oocytes was analyzed. Sixteen hours after injection of 100 oocytes with antisense oligonucleotides complementary to either ZP2 or ZP3, zonae pellucidae were isolated with TAB buffer. Half of each sample was immunoprecipitated with anti-ZP2 and -ZP3 monoclonal antibodies to detect the newly synthesized zona proteins; the other half was immunoblotted to confirm the integrity of the zona preparation during the experimental procedures. Newly synthesized ZP2 and ZP3 proteins were present in the zona pellucidae of the uninjected and rabbit α-globin oligonucleotide-injected oocytes (Fig. 5A, lanes3 and 6). However, little, if any, ZP2 or ZP3 protein was detected in zonae pellucidae isolated from the oocytes injected with either ZP2 or ZP3 antisense oligonucleotides (Fig. 5A, lanes4 and 5). Thus, both proteins must be efficiently synthesized to add additional zona proteins to a preexisting zona matrix. To confirm the integrity of the zona pellucida, solubilized zonae from uninjected oocytes or oocytes injected with either ZP2 or ZP3 or globin antisense oligonucleotides were immunoblotted. Intact ZP2 and ZP3 proteins were detected in all samples. Even though the signal obtained with ZP3 was less than ZP2 (reflecting both lower amounts of ZP3 and the lower affinity of the antibody), the degree of ZP2 and ZP3 immunostaining was constant among the four samples (Fig. 5B, lanes1-4). Antisense oligonucleotides microinjected into growing mouse oocytes can specifically “knock-out” ZP2 or ZP3 mRNA, and the degradation of each can be monitored by a sensitive RNase assay. The absence of either zona transcript precludes de novo synthesis of the cognate protein and prevents incorporation of both proteins into the extracellular zona pellucida matrix. These data indicate that while ZP2 and ZP3 proteins are independently synthesized, new zona matrix formation is dependent on the coordinate biosynthesis of both proteins. The role of the recently cloned mouse ZP1 2O. Epifano, unpublished observations. in assembling the zona pellucida remains to be determined. However, if we assume that ZP1 is synthesized normally in cultured oocytes, our data suggests that its synthesis is not sufficient for the incorporation of either ZP2 or ZP3 into the zona matrix. Although these results may be particular to the accretion of zona proteins in a preexisting zona matrix (e.g. after the commencement of oocyte growth), they raise the possibility that the absence of either ZP2 or ZP3 in early oocytes would preclude in vivo zona pellucida formation. At birth, mouse oocytes are normally enclosed in a layer of flattened granulosa cells surrounded by a basement membrane, forming units called primordial follicles. At the beginning of follicular development, granulosa cells become cuboidal and proliferate to form a stratified epithelium. Concomitant with the onset of granulosa cell proliferation, the oocyte initiates its own growth, and the zona pellucida is first observed as extracellular patches that later coalesce into a uniform matrix surrounding the oocyte. Cytoplasmic processes from both the oocyte and granulosa cells traverse the zona matrix providing the basis of oocyte-granulosa cell interactions during folliculogenesis. Whether the zona pellucida matrix is necessary for normal follicular development is not known. Oocytes growing in early follicles are remarkably active both transcriptionally and translationally.

In general, these dormant mRNAs have a short poly(A) tail of approximately 15-90 residues. When translational activation occurs (after meiotic maturation), the tail is elongated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation (29Huarte J. Belin D. Vassalli A. Strickland S. Vassalli J.D.

The biosynthesis of the zona pellucida involves a series of coordinate events initiated by the expression of the zona genes and culminating with the stable formation of an extracellular matrix. Although zona transcripts are present in low amounts in resting mouse oocytes (10-15 μm), the abundance of ZP2 and ZP3 mRNA increases dramatically as oocytes enter their growth phase. In oocytes that are 50 μm in diameter, ZP2 and ZP3 mRNAs represent ~ 1.4% of total poly(A) + RNA. As the oocyte reaches its full size (75-80 μm), the amount of ZP2 and ZP3 transcripts declines, and, in ovulated eggs, the abundance of these two transcripts is less than 5% of their peak levels(3Liang L.-F. Chamow S.M. Dean J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 34Philpott C.C. Ringuette M.J. Dean J. Dev. Biol. 1987; 121: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This profile is very similar to the pattern of de novo biosynthesis of the zona proteins, which is coordinately regulated during the initial growth phase and then declines in the latter stages of oocyte growth; no zona protein synthesis is detected in ovulated eggs(2Shimizu S.

Precursor ZP2 and ZP3 proteins contain a signal peptide that directs them into a secretory pathway, and both undergo posttranslational modifications. While it is not known if the two proteins complex with one another in the secretory pathway, at the cell surface, or in the extracellular space, our data suggest that only the ZP2:ZP3 complex (by itself or with the addition of ZP1) can participate in zona formation. These investigations were undertaken in the Laboratory of Cellular and Developmental Biology, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health. We thank our colleagues in both laboratories for constructive suggestions and discussion during this study, and we appreciate the critical reading of the manuscript by Drs. Robert McIsaac, Ann Ginsberg, and Robert Simpson."

It enhances helix destabilization by DNA helicase by preventing renaturation of unwound duplex (1Baker T.A. Sekimizu K. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A.

Rev. 1990; 54: 342-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SSB increases the fidelity of DNA polymerase, likely by increasing the rigidity of the DNA template, promoting increased steric hindrance between template and incorrect nucleotides(3Kunkel T.A.

Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2378-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SSB increases the processivity of DNA polymerase by destabilizing the DNA secondary structure that causes enzyme pausing and dissociation(5Sherman L. Gefter M. J. Mol.

The mitochondrial counterpart of E. coli SSB, mitochondrial SSB (mtSSB), has been purified from rat liver(14Pavco P.A. Van Tuyle G.C. J.

Gene (Amst.). 1993; 126: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) have been cloned and sequenced. Mitochondrial SSB comprises a 13-15-kDa polypeptide with an estimated native molecular mass of ∼ 56 kDa, suggesting that it is a tetramer in solution(14Pavco P.A. Van Tuyle G.C. J.

It binds cooperatively to DNA with a binding site size of 8-9 nucleotides and has an affinity for DNA that is similar to that displayed by E. coli SSB(15Mignotte B. Barat M. Mounolou J.-C.

Mitochondrial SSB is required for mtDNA maintenance in yeast, in which it was identified as a suppressor of mtDNA thermosensitivity associated with disruption of a mtDNA helicase gene, PIF1(16Van Dyck E. Foury F. Stillman B. Brill S.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3421-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). mtSSB has been shown to coat the displaced ssDNA that is the template for lagging DNA strand synthesis in mtDNA replication(21Van Tuyle G.C. Pavco P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and its apparent role in preventing the renaturation of displacement loops likely enhances DNA helicase activity(22Van Tuyle G.C. Pavco P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12772-12779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mtSSB is proposed to aid in the prevention of nonspecific lagging DNA strand initiation by mtDNA primase(23Wong T.W. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1985; 42: 951-958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 24Ledwith B.J. Manam S. Van Tuyle G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6571-6577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effect of mtSSB on the function of mitochondrial DNA polymerase (pol γ ) is unclear. Rat mtSSB stimulates the activity of partially purified rat pol γ ∼ 10-fold on the synthetic homopolymeric substrate poly(dT)•oligo(dA), but the activity of rat pol γ was unaffected on poly(dA)•oligo(dT), for which rat mtSSB exhibits a low DNA binding affinity(20Hoke G.D. Pavco P.A. Ledwith B.J. Van Tuyle G.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). X. laevis mtSSB was shown to stimulate severalfold a partially purified form of X. laevis pol γ on poly(dA)•oligo(dT) and on poly(rA)•oligo(dT)(25Mignotte B. Marsault J. Barat-Gueride M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast, X. laevis mtSSB had no effect on DNA synthesis in a mitochondrial lysate and was completely inhibitory to mitochondrial DNA polymerase activity on singly primed single-stranded viral DNA(25Mignotte B. Marsault J. Barat-Gueride M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The nearly homogeneous mitochondrial DNA polymerase from Drosophila melanogaster embryos is a heterodimeric enzyme (26Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14764-14770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) whose mechanism of DNA strand synthesis has been well characterized biochemically(27Wernette C.M. Conway M.C. Kaguni L.S.

It is capable of the highly processive DNA strand synthesis characteristic of bacterial, bacteriophage, and nuclear replicative DNA polymerases, but only under conditions that are suboptimal for DNA synthetic rate(29Williams A.J. Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24855-24862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although mtDNA replication in vivo is slow ( ∼ 4.5 nucleotides/s/DNA strand)(30Clayton D.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 693-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar), Drosophila pol γ catalyzes DNA synthesis at an even lower rate when carrying out highly processive DNA synthesis in vitro ( ∼ 0.5 nucleotides/s/DNA strand) (27Wernette C.M. Conway M.C. Kaguni L.S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6046-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 29Williams A.J. Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24855-24862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the effects of E. coli SSB on bacterial DNA replication and because mitochondrial SSB both is critical for mtDNA replication in vivo and affects the activity of partially purified forms of pol γ , we have investigated the effect of E. coli SSB on Drosophila pol γ . The high amino acid sequence conservation between mtSSBs and E. coli SSB and their physical and biochemical similarities suggest that theeffects of E. coli SSB on mitochondrial DNA polymerase will reflect those of mtSSB as well. Unlabeled deoxy- and ribonucleoside triphosphates were purchased from P-L Biochemicals. [3H]dTTP was purchased from ICN Biochemicals; [α- 32 P]dTTP and [ γ - 32 P]ATP were purchased from DuPont NEN. Recombinant and wild-type M13 viral DNAs (10,650 and 6407 nucleotides, respectively) were prepared by standard laboratory methods. Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (15 nucleotides) complementary to the M13 viral DNAs were synthesized in an Applied Biosystems Model 477 oligonucleotide synthesizer. Drosophila DNA polymerase γ (Fraction VI) was prepared as described by Wernette and Kaguni(26Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14764-14770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Drosophila SSB was generously provided by Dr. I. R. Lehman (Stanford University). E. coli SSB and bacteriophage T4 gp32 were from United States Biochemical Corp. E. coli DNA polymerase III subunits were generously provided by Dr. Charles McHenry (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center) and Dr. Mike O'Donnell (Cornell University Medical College). Reaction mixtures (0.05 ml) contained 50 mM Tris•HCl (pH 8.5), 4 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 30 or 120 mM KCl, 400 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 μM dATP, 20 μM dCTP, 20 μM dGTP, 20 μM [3H]dTTP (1000 cpm/pmol), 10 μM (as nucleotides) singly primed recombinant M13 DNA, and 0.1 unit of Fraction VI enzyme (7-fold excess of primer ends over pol γ molecules). Incubation was at 30°C for 30 min. Specific modifications are described in the figure legends. One unit of activity is that amount that catalyzes the incorporation of 1 nmol of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate into acid-insoluble material in 60 min at 30°C using DNase I-activated calf thymus DNA as the substrate. Here, we define standard activity as that activity exhibited by pol γ in the presence of 120 mM KCl on singly primed M13 DNA. Reactions were as described above, except that reaction mixtures contained 30 μM dATP, 30 μM dCTP, 30 μM dGTP, 10 μM [α- 32 P]dTTP (2 × 104 cpm/pmol), 20 μM (as nucleotides) singly primed wild-type M13 DNA, and 0.02 units of Fraction VI enzyme (100-fold excess of primer ends over pol γ molecules). Incubation was at 30°C for 4 or 8 min. Reaction mixtures were made 1% in SDS and 10 mM in EDTA, heated for 4 min at 80°C, phenol/chloroform-extracted, and precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 0.5 μg of tRNA as carrier. The ethanol precipitates were resuspended in 30 mM NaOH and 20 mM EDTA and electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose slab gel (13 × 18 × 0.7 cm) containing 30 mM NaCl and 2 mM EDTA in 30 mM NaOH and 2 mM EDTA. Approximately equal amounts of radioactivity ( ∼ 1000 cpm) were loaded in each lane. After electrophoresis, the gel was washed in distilled water for 20 min, dried under vacuum, and exposed at −80°C to Kodak X-Omat AR x-ray film using a DuPont NEN Quanta III intensifying screen. Quantitation of the data was performed by scanning the autoradiographs using a BioImage Visage 110 digital imager. The area under the peaks was determined by computer integration analysis and was normalized to the nucleotide level to correct for the uniform labeling of the DNA products. In the determination of processivity values, the length of the primer (15 nucleotides) was subtracted from the DNA product strand lengths. Reaction mixtures containing 30 mM KCl were as described for the DNA polymerase assay, except that they were 450 μl, contained 0.9 units of Fraction VI enzyme (7-fold excess of primer ends over pol γ molecules), and lacked dNTPs. After incubation at 30°C for 5 min, dNTPs were added, and the incubation was continued. At the time points specified in the figure legends, aliquots (0.05 ml) were removed, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate. For analysis of products by gel electrophoresis, [ 32 P]dTTP (3000 cpm/pmol) replaced [3H]dTTP (1000 cpm/pmol), aliquots were processed and electrophoresed, and the DNA strand products were analyzed as described for the processivity assay. Reaction mixtures (0.05 ml) contained 50 mM Tris•HCl (pH 8.5), 4 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 30 mM KCl, 400 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 30 μM dATP, 30 μM dGTP, 30 μM dTTP, 20 μM (as nucleotides) 5′-end labeled singly primed recombinant M13 DNA, and 0.4 units of Fraction VI enzyme (3-fold excess of primer ends over pol γ molecules). Incubation was at 30°C for 5 min. Samples were made 1% in SDS and 10 mM in EDTA, heated for 10 min at 65°C, phenol/chloroform-extracted, and precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 0.5 μg of tRNA as carrier. The ethanol precipitates were resuspended in 80% formamide and 90 mM Tris borate. Aliquots were denatured for 2 min at 100°C and electrophoresed on an 18% polyacrylamide slab gel (13 × 24 × 0.075 cm) containing 7 M urea in 90 mM Tris borate (pH 8.3) and 25 mM EDTA. After electrophoresis, the gel was washed in distilled water for 20 min and exposed at −80°C to Kodak X-Omat AR x-ray film using a DuPont NEN Quanta III intensifying screen. Quantitation was as described above. E. coli SSB was shown previously to have no effect on the activity of partially purified X. laevis mitochondrial DNA polymerase(25Mignotte B. Marsault J. Barat-Gueride M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, when nearly homogeneous D. melanogaster DNA polymerase γ was assayed on singly primed M13 DNA in the presence of SSB and 120 mM KCl, we found that polymerase activity was stimulated ∼ 2.5-fold (250% of standard activity) (Fig. 1). Furthermore, when Drosophila pol γ was assayed in the presence of SSB and 30 mM KCl, activity was stimulated ∼ 25-fold (625% of standard activity). Maximal stimulation was observed when the amount of SSB present was sufficient to coat all of the single-stranded DNA in the reaction: the presence of salt alters the binding characteristics of E. coli SSB, resulting in saturation of the M13 DNA by binding protein at ∼ 0.5 and 1.0 μg of SSB in the presence of 120 and 30 mM KCl, respectively(31Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3594-3603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result suggests that SSB stimulation of pol γ is caused by its DNA coating capacity and not by a stoichiometric interaction with DNA polymerase γ . We found previously that the mechanism of DNA synthesis by Drosophila pol γ is dependent on the KCl concentration at which it was assayed(29Williams A.J. Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24855-24862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): at 120 mM KCl, pol γ is most active (standard activity), yet only moderately processive (average processive unit of 45 nucleotides); at 30 mM KCl, pol γ is less active (25% of standard activity), but highly processive (average processive unit of 2500 nucleotides). Therefore, we investigated the effect of KCl concentration on the stimulation of Drosophila pol γ by E. coli SSB. The stimulation of mitochondrial DNA polymerase by SSB was maximal from ∼ 20-90 mM KCl (Fig. 2), thus lowering the KCl concentration required to achieve optimal DNA polymerase activity as much as 6-fold. Furthermore, SSB inhibited completely pol γ when the concentration of KCl was >150 mM. This shift in KCl optimum may reflect a change in DNA binding mechanism with varying salt concentration both by SSB (31Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3594-3603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by pol γ in the presence of SSB and/or a change in protein-protein interactions. E. coli SSB stimulates bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase ∼ 11-fold following 2 min of DNA synthesis, with stimulation decreasing over time to 5-fold after 15 min of catalysis(32Myers T.W. Romano L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17006-17015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the maximal stimulation of Drosophila pol γ by SSB, we examined the extent of DNA synthesis by pol γ in the absence and presence of SSB and 30 mM KCl over a time course of incubation. Nucleotide incorporation by pol γ alone was linear to 60 min of incubation at 30°C (Fig. 3A)(28Kaguni L.S. Wernette C.M. Conway M.C. Yang-Cashman P. Kelly T. Stillman B. Cancer Cells: Eukaryotic DNA Replication. Vol. 6. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 425-432Google Scholar), while DNA synthesis in the presence of SSB was linear only to 8 min of incubation. The stimulation of mitochondrial DNA polymerase was 7-fold initially, then >30-fold from 8 to 16 min, decreasing to 22-fold following 60 min of incubation at 30°C (Fig. 3B). Thus, a lag time is required to achieve maximal stimulation of Drosophila pol γ by E. coli SSB. Surprisingly, only 17% of the template DNA was copied after 60 min of DNA synthesis in the presence of SSB, corresponding to approximately the amount expected if each DNA polymerase molecule copied only a single DNA molecule and did not cycle to an unused primer terminus. That at least 70% of the input DNA could serve as template for DNA replication was shown by readdition of pol γ after 60 min of incubation (data not shown). Furthermore, the extent of DNA synthesis was proportional to the amount of DNA polymerase added: in enzyme titrations, the percentage of DNA copied, ranging from 4 to 70%, reflected that expected for a single binding and polymerization cycle (data not shown). The stimulation of Drosophila mitochondrial DNA polymerase by E. coli SSB may result from an increase in the initiation or elongation rate or in the rate of polymerase cycling or from some combination of these parameters. To determine the mechanism by which SSB stimulates Drosophila pol γ , we first examined its effect on enzyme processivity. The addition of SSB at 30 mM KCl resulted in a more uniform distribution of DNA synthetic products, suggesting the elimination of some DNA polymerase pause sites, and a substantial increase in the amount of full-length DNA product strands (Fig. 4). However, the average processivity of mitochondrial DNA polymerase was increased only 2-fold, even though the stimulation of DNA polymerase activity by SSB was 37-fold after 8 min of incubation. Next, we investigated the effect of SSB on the rate of initiation of DNA synthesis by Drosophila pol γ by primer extension analysis. Limited DNA synthesis on M13 DNA containing a 5′-end-labeled 15-nucleotide primer was carried out in the presence of dATP, dGTP, and TTP, and the DNA product strands were examined by denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5). In the absence of dCTP, termination of DNA synthesis occurs after the incorporation of 8 or 11 nucleotides, the first and second positions where dCTP is the required substrate. Hence, the primer extension assay allows an evaluation of the initial stages of DNA synthesis: primer recognition and binding by pol γ and limited primer extension. Quantitation of the DNA product strands in the presence and absence of SSB revealed that SSB stimulates primer extension ∼ 25-fold at 30 mM KCl following 5 min of incubation at 30°C (Fig. 5). This corresponds closely to the 30-fold stimulation of polymerase activity at this time of incubation (Fig. 3B), indicating that ∼ 80% of pol γ stimulation by SSB is due to an increase in the rate of initiation of DNA synthesis by mitochondrial DNA polymerase. The stimulation may result from SSB-facilitated primer recognition accomplished by elimination of nonproductive binding of DNA polymerase to excess single-stranded DNA or by increasing the affinity of unbound polymerase molecules for DNA. In support of this hypothesis is the observation that SSB stimulates to a similar extent the 3′ → 5′-exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase γ on M13 DNA containing mispaired primers. 2C. L. Farr and L. S. Kaguni, unpublished data. To explore further the mechanism of stimulation of mitochondrial DNA polymerase by SSB, we examined the products of DNA synthesis by pol γ in the absence and presence of SSB over the same time course of incubation shown in Fig. 3A (Fig. 6). Based on the average DNA product strand lengths observed after 1 and 2 min of DNA synthesis, we can estimate the intrinsic rate of nucleotide polymerization by Drosophila pol γ to be 15-20 nucleotides/s, both in the absence and presence of SSB. Likewise, full-length DNA product strands were observed after 8 min of DNA synthesis in either case, corresponding to a polymerization rate of ∼ 20 nucleotides incorporated per s. Although E. coli SSB apparently has no effect on the intrinsic rate of DNA synthesis by pol γ , it eliminates a strong pause site at the position of DNA product strands of 2600 nucleotides in length, resulting in a greater accumulation of full-length DNA products. As in the analysis shown in Fig. 4, the processivity of pol γ was increased ∼ 2-fold in the presence of SSB. Based on the distribution of DNA product strand lengths after various times of DNA synthesis (Fig. 6), Drosophila pol γ synthesizes a processive product of ∼ 2600 nucleotides in the absence of SSB and then cycles to an unused primer terminus. In the presence of SSB, the average processive unit increases to ∼ 5500 nucleotides. While SSB has no effect on the intrinsic rate of DNA synthesis by pol γ and only a modest effect on pol γ processivity, the extents of DNA synthesis by pol γ varied 10-20-fold over the time course of incubation in the absence and presence of SSB: in the absence of SSB, 0.06% of the DNA template was copied after 1 min and 1% after 60 min of incubation, as compared with the presence of SSB, where the extents of DNA synthesis were 0.6 and 17% after 1 and 60 min, respectively. Interestingly, the 10-20-fold variation in the extent of DNA synthesis by pol γ in the absence versus presence of SSB correlates with a 5-10-fold variation in the fraction of pol γ molecules actively engaged in DNA synthesis, which can be estimated using the average DNA strand length to calculate an average rate of nucleotide polymerization at each time point. That the extent of stimulation of pol γ by SSB is generally proportional to the number of active pol γ molecules supports the hypothesis that the mechanism of stimulation of mitochondrial DNA polymerase by E. coli SSB is via an increase in the rate of initiation. The stimulation of Drosophila mitochondrial DNA polymerase by E. coli SSB is dramatic and appears to be due primarily to an increase in primer recognition and binding. Single-stranded DNA-binding proteins from sources as diverse as bacteria and humans appear to function via specific protein-protein interactions in addition to their ability to coat single-stranded DNA. To examine the specificity of stimulation of mitochondrial DNA polymerase by E. coli SSB, the effects of Drosophila SSB (DSSB) and bacteriophage T4 gp32 on pol γ activity were examined (Fig. 7). Both DSSB and gp32 stimulated Drosophila pol γ , although to a lesser extent than E. coli SSB (Fig. 7). Maximal stimulation was ∼ 7.5-fold for DSSB and 20-fold for gp32, as compared with 37-fold for E. coli SSB. As with E. coli SSB, DNA synthesis by mitochondrial DNA polymerase in the presence of DSSB and gp32 was linear only to 16 min of incubation at 30°C. Likewise, maximal stimulation by all three single-stranded DNA-binding proteins was achieved after 8 min, although the extent of stimulation of pol γ by DSSB and gp32 was relatively constant, varying <2-fold over the time course of incubation at 30°C. The strong homology of mtSSB to E. coli SSB and the stimulation of pol γ by the latter suggested that E. coli processivity and primer recognition factors may substitute for putative mitochondrial DNA polymerase accessory factors as well. The subunits of DNA polymerase III responsible for processivity and primer recognition were examined with regard to their effects on mitochondrial DNA polymerase activity and DNA binding. Neither the β-subunit (processivity) nor the γ -complex (primer recognition), either alone or in combination, affected pol γ activity at 30 or 120 mM KCl in the absence or presence of E. coli SSB (data not shown). Furthermore, pol γ binding to template-primer DNA, examined in a gel mobility shift assay, was unaffected by either the β-subunit or the γ -complex, either alone or in combination (data not shown). Replication of procaryotic, eucaryotic, and viral DNA genomes requires DNA polymerase in conjunction with its accessory factors and single-stranded DNA-binding protein. Mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding proteins homologous to E. coli SSB have been identified in X. laevis, S. cerevisiae, and rat and human tissues(14Pavco P.A. Van Tuyle G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Mignotte B. Barat M. Mounolou J.-C.

Biophys. 1991; 291: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The substantial homology between mtSSBs and E. coli SSB in both sequence and proposed subunit structure and the requirement for mtSSB in yeast mtDNA replication led us to examine the effects of E. coli SSB on Drosophila mitochondrial DNA polymerase. E. coli SSB stimulates Drosophila pol γ at both 30 and 120 mM KCl. KCl affects greatly the mode and cooperativity of SSB binding even though it has little effect on the affinity of SSB for DNA: below 10 and above 200 mM NaCl, E. coli SSB binds to ssDNA in two modes that have site sizes of 33 and 65 nucleotides/tetramer, respectively (31Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3594-3603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the range between these salt concentrations, SSB tetramers bind in both modes, resulting in apparent binding site sizes between the two limits(31Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3594-3603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ruyechan W.T. Wetmur J.G. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5057-5064Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 34Krauss G. Sindermann H. Schomburg U. Maass G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5346-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Consistent with the known binding properties of E. coli SSB, we found that maximal stimulation of mitochondrial DNA polymerase at both 30 and 120 mM KCl occurs at the SSB concentrations required to saturate the ssDNA template. The ability of E. coli SSB to increase the processivity of E. coli DNA polymerases II and III and bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase (5Sherman L. Gefter M. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 103: 61-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 6LaDuca R.J. Fay P.J. Chuang C. McHenry C.S. Bambara R.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5177-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 9Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that it might also increase the processivity of mitochondrial DNA polymerase. We found that the presence of SSB increases the processivity of Drosophila pol γ ∼ 2-fold at 30 mM KCl (this report) and 3-fold at 120 mM KCl, 3C. M. Wernette and L. S. Kaguni, unpublished data. reducing or eliminating pausing of DNA polymerase at specific sites and increasing the fraction of completed DNA product strands. Interestingly, the increase in processivity corresponds closely with the 2-3-fold stimulation of pol γ at 120 mM KCl, but cannot account for the 37-fold stimulation observed at 30 mM KCl. The stimulation of several DNA polymerases by E. coli SSB has been documented and, in some cases, appears to be due to the ability of SSB to increase primer recognition by either preventing nonproductive binding of DNA polymerase to or enhancing the affinity of DNA polymerase for single-stranded DNA. SSB stimulation of herpes simplex virus-1 DNA polymerase occurs by the former mechanism(10O'Donnell M.E. Elias P. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4252-4259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while that of bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase is proposed to occur by the latter(32Myers T.W. Romano L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17006-17015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The elimination of nonproductive binding by DNA polymerase may result from a decreased affinity of DNA polymerase for SSB-coated ssDNA, causing multiple binding and dissociation events that continue until the primer terminus is recognized and bound. Alternatively, the presence of SSB may maintain or enhance DNA binding and facilitate a sliding or looping mechanism by which DNA polymerase locates efficiently the primer terminus. Our primer extension data show that the stimulation of mitochondrial DNA polymerase by E. coli SSB is due primarily to an increased rate of primer recognition and binding, consistent with either mechanism. By determining the extents of DNA synthesis and the average lengths of DNA product strands over a time course of incubation, we could estimate the number of active DNA polymerase molecules at each time point. In doing so, we conclude that in the presence of SSB, nearly all of the pol γ molecules were polymerizing DNA after 16 min of incubation. In contrast, in the absence of SSB, only ∼ 12% of the pol γ molecules were active after 16 min and 25% after 60 min of incubation. In fact, the stimulation of pol γ by SSB at each time point was generally proportional to the increase in the estimated number of pol γ molecules actively synthesizing DNA in the presence and absence of SSB, providing further support for the hypothesis that SSB stimulates pol γ by increasing the rate of primer recognition. Given the proposed mechanism of stimulation of Drosophila pol γ by E. coli SSB, it is not surprising that Drosophila SSB and bacteriophage T4 gp32 also stimulate mitochondrial DNA polymerase, albeit to different extents. While the three proteins bind to DNA with approximately equal affinity, they may impose different conformations onto single-stranded DNA(35Chase J.W. Williams K.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 103-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 36Mitsis P.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Lehman I.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5257-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, mitochondrial DNA polymerase may bind to DSSB- and gp32-coated DNA nonproductively with higher affinity than it binds to E. coli SSB-coated DNA. Alternatively, pol γ may displace E. coli SSB more effectively than DSSB or gp32 from the DNA template during polymerization. Because of its homology to the DNA-binding domain of E. coli SSB, mtSSB might be expected to impose a conformation onto ssDNA similar to that of E. coli SSB: mtSSBs are 50-67% identical to several regions of the amino-terminal two-thirds of E. coli SSB that is involved in DNA binding (16Van Dyck E. Foury F. Stillman B. Brill S.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3421-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 18Tiranti V. Rocchi M. DiDonato S. Zeviani M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 126: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 19Ghrir R. Lecaer J.-P. Dufresne C. Gueride M. Arch. Biochem.

In addition, two amino acids known to be involved in DNA binding by E. coli SSB are identical in all mtSSBs identified to date, and a third amino acid is identical in all mtSSBs except that in yeast(18Tiranti V. Rocchi M. DiDonato S. Zeviani M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 126: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 38Merrill B.M. Williams K.R. Chase J.W. Konigsberg W.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 10938-10945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the effects of E. coli SSB on DNA polymerase γ may be expected to represent more closely those of mtSSB than those of bacteriophage SSBs or eucaryotic SSBs of nuclear origin. Primer recognition and processivity factors from E. coli failed to alter the activity of mitochondrial DNA polymerase. This may be due to a lack of stable protein-protein associations. Stimulation of pol γ by E. coli SSB is likely mediated by the interaction of SSB with DNA and not through specific pol γ -SSB interactions. In contrast, primer recognition and processivity factors associate with DNA polymerase to tether it onto the DNA template(41Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the polymerase catalytic subunits of mitochondrial DNA polymerase and E. coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme lack regions of significant homology(42Ito J. Braithwaite D.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4045-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), specific association of the procaryotic accessory proteins with Drosophila pol γ is perhaps unlikely. Animal mtDNA is replicated by a highly asymmetric mechanism(30Clayton D.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 693-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 43Goddard J.M. Wolstenholme D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 741-757PubMed Google Scholar). Leading DNA strand synthesis occurs on the double-stranded parental DNA template, while lagging DNA strand synthesis, which occurs on the displaced parental DNA strand, involves replication of a predominantly (or entirely) single-stranded DNA template. Thus, replication of the singly primed single-stranded viral DNA template used in this study provides an excellent model of lagging strand mtDNA synthesis. We have found previously that Drosophila mitochondrial DNA polymerase is capable of highly processive DNA synthesis in vitro only under reaction conditions that are suboptimal for DNA synthetic rate(29Williams A.J. Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24855-24862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we find that the addition of E. coli SSB enhances greatly the rate of DNA synthesis while maintaining high processivity, providing further support for an important role for SSB in mitochondrial DNA replication. That previous studies examining the effects of both E. coli SSB and homologous mtSSBs on pol γ did not yield a uniform conclusion (20Hoke G.D. Pavco P.A. Ledwith B.J. Van Tuyle G.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Mignotte B. Marsault J. Barat-Gueride M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) may reflect both the purity of the pol γ preparation and the reaction conditions employed. We have found that both KCl concentration and enzyme purity have a substantial effect on the stimulation of Drosophila pol γ by E. coli SSB. For example, in Fractions I-V of our standard pol γ purification(26Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14764-14770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which vary from ∼ 0.04 to 20% in purity, SSB stimulation may vary from 0.5- to 20-fold. 4A. J. Williams and L. S. Kaguni, unpublished data. In any case, the SSB-induced ability of Drosophila pol γ to copy efficiently and processively long stretches of ssDNA is characteristic of a DNA polymerase that catalyzes continuous DNA strand synthesis, as proposed in current models of mtDNA replication(30Clayton D.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 693-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 43Goddard J.M. Wolstenholme D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 741-757PubMed Google Scholar).
