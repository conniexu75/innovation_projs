https://openalex.org/W2064110992,"A massive neuronal system was detected by immunocytochemistry and radioimmunoassay with antibodies to neuropeptide Y, the recently isolated peptide of the pancreatic polypeptide family. Immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers were most prevalent in cortical, limbic, and hypothalamic regions. Neuropeptide Y was extracted in concentrations higher than those of any other peptide hitherto discovered in the mammalian brain. Column chromatography of brain extracts and double immunostaining experiments indicate that neuropeptide Y is the endogenous brain peptide responsible for immunostaining of pancreatic polypeptide-like immunoreactivity in the mammalian brain."

In every case, increased expression of a 170,000-dalton surface antigen was found to be correlated with multidrug resistance. This membrane component is of identical molecular size and shares some immunogenic homology with the previously characterized P-glycoprotein of colchicine-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells. This finding may have application to cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2049074524,"Prolonged treatment with classical antipsychotic drugs decreased the number of spontaneously active dopamine neurons in both the substantia nigra (A9) and the ventral tegmental area (A10) of the rat brain. In contrast, treatment with atypical antipsychotic drugs selectively decreased the number of A10 dopamine neurons. Related drugs lacking antipsychotic efficacy failed to decrease dopamine activity. These findings suggest that the inability of atypical antipsychotic drugs to decrease A9 dopamine neuronal activity may be related to their lower potential for causing tardive dyskinesia and that the inactivation of A10 neurons may be involved in the delayed onset of therapeutic effects during treatment."

https://openalex.org/W1566050966,"Transducin, a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein found in the bovine retinal rod outer segment, mediates the signal coupling between rhodopsin and a cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. Previous studies have demonstrated that photolyzed rhodopsin catalyzed the exchange of GTP for GDP bound to transducin. The transducin-GTP complex, in turn, activates the phosphodiesterase. Purified transducin (T) has been resolved by omega-amino octylagarose chromatography into two functional subunits: T alpha (Mr approximately 39,000) and T beta gamma (Mr approximately 36,000 and approximately 10,000). The guanine nucleotide binding site is on the T alpha subunit. Neither the T alpha nor the T beta gamma subunit showed significant GTPase activity, Gpp(NH)p-GDP exchange, and ability to bind to rhodopsin when assayed in the presence of reconstituted membranes containing photolyzed rhodopsin. However, all the above activities were restored if the two subunits were recombined. Analysis of the reconstituted GTPase activity as a function of the T alpha subunit concentration revealed a linear relationship. On the other hand, GTPase activity rapidly saturated at T beta gamma concentration much lower than the T alpha concentration, indicating that the two subunits were dissociated during GTP hydrolysis. These findings strongly suggest that the T beta gamma subunit is an activator of the GTPase activity. Its mode of action is to enable the T alpha subunit to interact with rhodopsin effectively."
https://openalex.org/W1604711400,"The Ca2+ selective fluorescent indicator, Quin-2, was employed to monitor continuously the concentration of free cytosolic Ca2+ [ Ca2+ ]i in isolated rat hepatocytes. Epinephrine (10(-6) M) and phenylephrine (10(-5) M), acting via alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, increases [ Ca2+ ]i from a basal concentration of approximately 0.2 microM to approximately 0.6 microM. This increase in [ Ca2+ ]i is evident as early as 1 to 1.5 s, the earliest time so far reported for any hepatic alpha 1-adrenergic event. Vasopressin (10(-8) M), after a lag which is 2 to 3 s longer, increases [ Ca2+ ]i to the same extent and at the same rate as the alpha 1-adrenergic agonists. Glucagon (10(-8) M) also increases [ Ca2+ ]i but at a significantly slower rate and only after a lag of about 10 s. All of these agents also induce an increase in the fluorescence of control cells. This Quin-2 independent fluorescence, which is due to an increased reduction of pyridine nucleotides, must be corrected for before the maximum change in [ Ca2+ ]i can be calculated but is sufficiently slow so as not to contribute to the initial rate of increase in the Quin-2-dependent fluorescence."
https://openalex.org/W1489524219,"Intracellular proteolytic degradation of glutamine synthetase occurs in two distinct steps in Escherichia coli (Levine, R. L., Oliver, C. N., Fulks, R. M., and Stadtman, E. R. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78, 2120-2124). In the first step, a mixed function oxidation modifies the glutamine synthetase. The modified enzyme, which is catalytically inactive, becomes susceptible to proteolytic attack. In the second step, a protease specific for the modified enzyme catalyzes the actual proteolytic degradation. The oxidatively modified glutamine synthetase was studied to determine the chemical differences between it and the native enzyme. Only a single alteration was found; one of sixteen histidine residues/subunit was altered by the oxidative modification. The modification introduced a carbonyl group into the protein, permitting isolation of a stable dinitrophenylhydrazone. No other differences were detected between the native and modified proteins. Specifically, the cysteine, methionine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan contents were not altered. A number of other prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes are also susceptible to oxidative modification. This covalent modification may be important in intracellular proteolysis, in mammalian host defense systems, in prevention of autolysis, in aging processes, and in oxygen toxicity."

https://openalex.org/W1551274638,"The first stage of amplification in the cyclic GMP cascade in bovine retinal rod is carried out by transducin, a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein consisting of two functional subunits, T alpha (Mr approximately 39,000) and T beta gamma (Mr approximately 36,000 and approximately 10,000). Limited trypsin digestion of the T beta gamma subunit converted the beta polypeptide to two stable fragments (Mr approximately 26,000 and approximately 14,000). The GTPase and Gpp(NH)p binding activities were not significantly affected by the cleavage. Trypsin digestion of the T alpha subunit initially removed a small segment from the polypeptide terminus and resulted in the formation of a single 38,000-Da fragment. When this fragment was recombined with the intact T beta gamma subunit in the presence of membranes containing photolyzed rhodopsin, the reconstituted transducin exhibited greatly reduced GTPase and Gpp(NH)p binding activities. The loss in activities was due to the inability of the cleaved T alpha to bind to the photolyzed rhodopsin. Prolonged digestion converted the 38,000-Da fragment to a transient 32,000-Da fragment and then to two stable 23,000-Da and 12,000-Da fragments. The cleavage of the 32,000-Da fragment, however, can be blocked by bound Gpp(NH)p. The 32,000-Da fragment contains the Gpp(NH)p binding site and retains the ability to activate phosphodiesterase. These results indicate that the guanine nucleotide binding and rhodopsin binding sites are located in topologically distinct regions of the T alpha subunit and proved evidence that a large conformational transition of the molecule occurs upon the conversion of the bound GDP to GTP."
https://openalex.org/W1554418340,"The first step in the proteolytic degradation of bacterial glutamine synthetase is a mixed function oxidation of one of the 16 histidine residues in the glutamine synthetase subunit (Levine, R.L. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 11823-11827). A model system, consisting of oxygen, a metal ion, and ascorbic acid, mimics the bacterial system in mediating the oxidative modification of glutamine synthetase. This model system was studied to gain an understanding of the mechanism of oxidation and of factors which control the susceptibility of the enzyme to oxidation. Availability of substrates and the extent of covalent modification of the enzyme (adenylylation) interact to modulate susceptibility of the enzyme to oxidation. This interaction provides the biochemical basis for physiologic regulation of intracellular proteolysis of glutamine synthetase. The oxidative modification requires hydrogen peroxide. While the reaction may involve Fenton chemistry, the participation of free radicals, superoxide anion, and singlet oxygen could not be demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2029704740,"To ascertain whether Huntington's chorea and schizophrenia are associated with specific regional alterations in neurotensin, somatostatin, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone, the concentrations of these putative neurotransmitters were measured by radioimmunoassay in postmortem brain samples from patients with Huntington's chorea or schizophrenia. Compared to 50 patients without psychiatric or neurological disease, the patients with Huntington's chorea showed significantly elevated concentrations of all three neuropeptides in the nucleus caudatus. In the nucleus accumbens somatostatin levels were increased threefold, while in the amygdala thyrotropin-releasing hormone levels were elevated. In contrast, the schizophrenics exhibited reduced levels of thyrotropin-releasing hormone in two frontal cortical regions, reduced somatostatin levels in one frontal cortical area, and increased neurotensin levels in one frontal cortical area. None of the differences between the diseased brains and the controls could be accounted for by differences in age, sex, or time between death and autopsy."
https://openalex.org/W1647656396,"The endocytosis of diferric transferrin and accumulation of its iron by freshly isolated rabbit reticulocytes was studied using 59Fe-125I-transferrin. Internalized transferrin was distinguished from surface-bound transferrin by its resistance to release during treatment with Pronase at 4 degrees C. Endocytosis of diferric transferrin occurs at the same rate as exocytosis of apotransferrin, the rate constants being 0.08 min-1 at 22 degrees C, 0.19 min-1 at 30 degrees C, and 0.45 min-1 at 37 degrees C. At 37 degrees C, the maximum rate of transferrin endocytosis by reticulocytes is approximately 500 molecules/cell/s. The recycling time for transferrin bound to its receptor is about 3 min at this temperature. Neither transferrin nor its receptor is degraded during the intracellular passage. When a steady state has been reached between endocytosis and exocytosis of the ligand, about 90% of the total cell-bound transferrin is internal. Endocytosis of transferrin was found to be negligible below 10 degrees C. From 10 to 39 degrees C, the effect of temperature on the rate of endocytosis is biphasic, the rate increasing sharply above 26 degrees C. Over the temperature range 12-26 degrees C, the apparent activation energy for transferrin endocytosis is 33.0 +/- 2.7 kcal/mol, whereas from 26-39 degrees C the activation energy is considerably lower, at 12.3 +/- 1.6 kcal/mol. Reticulocytes accumulate iron atoms from diferric transferrin at twice the rate at which transferrin molecules are internalized, implying that iron enters the cell while still bound to transferrin. The activation energies for iron accumulation from transferrin are similar to those of endocytosis of transferrin. This study provides further evidence that transferrin-iron enters the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis and that iron release occurs within the cell."

https://openalex.org/W1603573575,"A cDNA library, prepared from poly(A+) mRNA isolated from chicken brain, was screened for calmodulin sequences using the cloned full length structural gene from Electrophorus electricus as probe (Lagace, L., Chandra, T., Woo, S.L.C., and Means, A.R. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 1684-1688). Fifteen positive signals were detected among 4500 recombinant clones from which two overlapping clones (pCB12 and pCB15) were selected for subsequent DNA sequencing. The combined unique sequences of the two cDNA clones yielded 1395 base pairs and contained the entire coding region for calmodulin, 94 base pairs of the 5'-nontranslated region, and the entire 3'-nontranslated region of 857 base pairs. The derived amino acid sequence of chicken calmodulin is identical with that of the bovine or human protein. Compared to the eel, there is a single conservative amino acid substitution at position 74 which is occupied by Arg in the chicken and Lys in the eel. The overall nucleotide homology between the amino acid coding regions of chicken and eel calmodulin mRNA is 79%. However, the 5'- and 3'-nontranslated regions of the chicken and eel mRNA for calmodulin are highly diverged with sequence homologies of 21 and 29%, respectively. The cDNA clones were used as probes to determine the size and distribution of calmodulin mRNA in a variety of chicken tissues. In all tissues examined, two species of mRNA for calmodulin were detected at 1600 and 1900 nucleotides. Both mRNAs occurred in the cytoplasm with an abundance ratio of 4:1 for the 1600 and 1900 species, respectively. The two mRNAs appear to result from differential processing of transcripts from a single calmodulin gene. Screening of a chicken genomic phage library using pCB12 as a probe yielded a single positive designated CL-1 which contains a DNA insert of 13.5 kilobase pairs. Partial sequencing of CL-1 has confirmed the presence of sequences which code for calmodulin. A comparison of the restriction maps of CL-1 and pCB12 and pCB15 indicates that CL-1 contains at least 3 intervening sequences."

https://openalex.org/W1571720132,"Smooth muscle heavy meromyosin (HMM) can serve as a substrate for the Ca2+-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) as well as for the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase, myosin light chain kinase. When turkey gizzard HMM is incubated with protein kinase C, 1.7-2.2 mol of phosphate are incorporated per mol of HMM, all of it into the 20,000-Da light chain of HMM. Two-dimensional peptide mapping following tryptic hydrolysis revealed that protein kinase C phosphorylated a different site on the 20,000-Da HMM light chain than did myosin light chain kinase. Moreover, sequential phosphorylation of HMM by myosin light chain kinase and protein kinase C resulted in the incorporation of 4 mol of phosphate/mol of HMM, i.e. 2 mol of phosphate into each 20,000-Da light chain. When unphosphorylated HMM was phosphorylated by myosin light chain kinase, its actin-activated MgATPase activity increased from 4 nmol to 156 nmol of phosphate released/mg of HMM/min. Subsequent phosphorylation of this phosphorylated HMM by protein kinase C decreased the actin-activated MgATPase activity of HMM to 75 nmol of phosphate released/mg of HMM/min."

https://openalex.org/W1501523301,"The gene 4 protein of bacteriophage T7 is both a primase and a helicase. In this paper, we present a detailed description of a third activity, single-stranded DNA-dependent nucleoside 5'-triphosphate hydrolysis, and show that this activity is coupled to the unidirectional translocation of the gene 4 protein on single-stranded DNA (Tabor, S., and Richardson, C.C. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 205-209). The competitive inhibitor of NTP hydrolysis, beta, gamma-methylene dTTP, is also a potent inhibitor of gene 4 protein-dependent, RNA-primed DNA synthesis; inhibition is not due to a direct inhibition of T7 DNA polymerase or RNA primer synthesis. We conclude that the energy derived from the hydrolysis of NTPs by the gene 4 protein is required for translocation of the protein to primase recognition sites. Measurement of the rates of hydrolysis of NTPs using a variety of DNAs of known structure and length support the unidirectional translocation of the gene 4 protein on single-stranded DNA. Duplex DNA, RNA, and single-stranded DNA coated with single-stranded DNA-binding protein do not serve as effectors for the nucleoside triphosphatase of the gene 4 protein. Kinetic data suggest that the gene 4 protein does not remain bound to newly synthesized oligoribonucleotide primers but continues to search for other primase recognition sites. Although all the predominant naturally occurring NTPs except rCTP are hydrolyzed by the gene 4 protein, the enzyme shows specificity for dTTP with a Km of 0.4 mM. In the accompanying paper (Matson, S.W., Tabor, S., and Richardson, C.C. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 14017-14024), we show that the hydrolysis of NTPs is also required for the protein to function as a helicase in duplex regions of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1506714695,"Transverse tubule membranes isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle have high levels of a Ca2+- or Mg2+-ATPase with Km values for Ca-ATP or Mg-ATP in the 0.2 mM range, but do not display detectable levels of ATPase activity activated by micromolar [Ca2+]. The transverse tubule enzyme is less temperature or pH dependent than the Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum and hydrolyzes equally well ATP, ITP, UTP, CTP, and GTP. Of several ionic, non-ionic, and zwitterionic detergents tested, only lysolecithin solubilizes the transverse tubule membrane while preserving ATPase activity. After extraction of about 50% of the transverse tubule proteins by solubilization with lysolecithin most of the ATPase activity remains membrane bound, indicating that the Ca2+- or Mg2+-ATPase is an intrinsic membrane enzyme. A second extraction of the remaining transverse tubule proteins with lysolecithin results in solubilization and partial purification of the enzyme. Sedimentation of the Ca2+- or Mg2+-ATPase, partially purified by lysolecithin solubilization, through a continuous sucrose gradient devoid of detergent leads to additional purification, with an overall 3- to 5-fold purification factor. The purified enzyme preparation contains two main protein components of molecular weights 107,000 and 30,000. Cholesterol, which is highly enriched in the transverse tubule membrane, copurifies with the enzyme. Transverse tubule membrane vesicles also display ATP-dependent calcium transport which is not affected by phosphate or oxalate. The possibility that the Ca2+- or Mg2+-ATPase is the enzyme responsible for the Ca2+ transport displayed by isolated transverse tubules is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1597868762,"An undecanucleotide extended hybridization probe has been used to screen a rat medullary thyroid carcinoma cDNA library for clones which contain preprosomatostatin sequences. The nucleotide sequence encoding rat preprosomatostatin is reported. The sequence of cDNA contains 67 nucleotides in the 3'-noncoding region, 84 nucleotides in the 5'-untranslated region, and 458 bases corresponding to the coding region. The mRNA codes for a somatostatin precursor 116 amino acids in length (Mr = 12,773). The preprosomatostatin has a sequence of hydrophobic amino acids at the NH2 terminus, followed by a peptide of approximately 78 residues, which precedes somatostatin-14. The amino acid sequences of rat and human preprosomatostatin (Shen, L. P., Pictet, R. L., and Rutter, W. J. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 4575-4579) differ by only 4 amino acid residues. Translation of rat poly(A) RNA in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system followed by immunoprecipitation with antisera directed against somatostatin-14 demonstrated the synthesis of a single protein having a molecular weight of 15,000. Two proteins having molecular weights of 14,000 and 15,000 are immunoprecipitated from a wheat germ cell-free translation mixture. Northern analysis of the somatostatin mRNA indicated that it is approximately 850 nucleotides in length. Analysis of several medullary thyroid carcinomas demonstrated that one tumor, designated WF, had immunoreactive somatostatin-14 in concentrations of 350 ng of somatostatin-14/mg of protein and somatostatin mRNA that represented 10% of the cellular poly(A) RNA. Cell lines derived from this tumor may provide an attractive system to investigate the regulation of somatostatin gene expression."

The induction is due to accelerated synthesis of the enzyme (150-fold increase) that occurs within 90 min of exposure of the cells to a heat-labile constituent of serum or plasma. The induction is reversible and is not reproduced by known activators of macrophage function such as lipopolysaccharide, muramyl dipeptide, and tuftsin. In animals, elevated levels of tissue transglutaminase are also found in inflammatory macrophages elicited by thioglycolate broth."
https://openalex.org/W1970864226,"The interaction of DNA replication forks with both stationary and transcribing RNA polymerase molecules has been examined in vitro, using the multienzyme T4 bacteriophage DNA replication system and purified E. coli RNA polymerase. We have found that a single stationary RNA polymerase molecule can block the movement of the T4 replication fork when bound to a promoter on a double-stranded fd DNA template. When transcription is allowed (in the same direction as replication), the replication fork appears to follow the moving RNA polymerase molecule at the relatively slow rate of transcription. The barriers to fork movement formed by E. coli RNA polymerase are eliminated by the addition of small amounts of a purified T4-encoded DNA helicase, the product of the dda gene. We find that replication complexes containing the dda protein cause stationary RNA polymerase molecules to dissociate from the DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1626000963,"Abstract Treatment of whole erythrocytes with 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-disulfonic acid stilbene (DIDS) results in inhibition of ATP and phosphate-dependent Ca2+ transport in subsequently prepared inside-out vesicles (IOV). Accumulation of phosphate into IOV in the presence of Ca2+ is virtually abolished by prior DIDS treatment, consistent with the presumed inhibition of the band III anion-exchange protein by this agent. No inhibition of Ca2+-activatable ATP hydrolysis is observed following DIDS treatment when open membranes are used to prevent development of ion gradients. This indicates that DIDS does not affect the inherent ATPase activity of the calcium pump (Waisman, D. M., Smallwood, J., Lafreniere, D., and Rasmussen, H. (1982) FEBS Lett. 145, 337-340). In IOV prepared from untreated cells, ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake is stimulated by phosphate, sulfate, or chloride. Rates of Ca2+ uptake into DIDS-IOV are not increased by these anions. Lipid-permeable organic acids such as acetate, however, do promote Ca2+ transport in DIDS-IOV. Lipophilic anions incapable of transporting protons into the vesicle interior (nitrate and thiocyanate) support sustained uptake only when the protonophore carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone is also added. These results support a model of the (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase as a pump exchanging Ca2+ for protons, not transporting Ca2+ alone. Band III protein appears to promote Ca2+ transport in the presence of phosphate, sulfate, or chloride by exchanging external anion for the accumulating OH- (or HCO3-) produced by the calcium pump."
https://openalex.org/W1493962880,"The kinetics of citrate-induced activation and polymerization (into filaments) of the 450,000-dalton protomeric form of acetyl-CoA carboxylase were compared to assess the concertedness of the two processes. Rapid-quench techniques were employed to measure the time course of activation by citrate of the carboxylase-catalyzed reaction. When enzyme was preincubated with citrate prior to initiating the steady state turnover reaction with acetyl-CoA in the rapid-quench device, the observed rate of carboxylation of acetyl-CoA was apparently linear from the moment of mixing. However, when enzyme was mixed with citrate to initiate the reaction, a lag (t1/2 = 0.7 s) occurred in the approach to steady state carboxylation rate. This lag was independent of enzyme concentration over a 230-fold range and was marginally dependent upon citrate concentration. Over the same range of enzyme concentration, polymerization of carboxylase protomers, as determined by right angle light scattering, was enzyme concentration-dependent in a manner predicted by a single protomer activation step, followed by a rate-limiting dimerization of active protomer and subsequent polymerization. Based on these results, it is concluded that activation of catalysis and the polymerization of carboxylase protomers are not concerted. Furthermore, activation of carboxylation leading to the formation of an active protomer was faster than polymerization under all conditions, and therefore precedes polymerization. It was also shown that the activation constant (Kact) for citrate is altered in a predictable manner by the accumulation of the reaction product, malonyl-CoA, the Kact increasing with increasing malonyl-CoA concentration. Additional evidence is presented indicating that this change in Kact was not caused by autophosphorylation of the enzyme under these conditions and that phosphorylation does not affect the mechanism of activation elucidated above."
https://openalex.org/W1561270317,"The particulate form of guanylate cyclase from sea urchin spermatozoa was purified to apparent homogeneity by chromatography on GTP-Sepharose and DEAE-Sepharose and by preparative gel electrophoresis. The sedimentation coefficient (S20,w) was 6.8 and the Stokes radius was 5.1 nm, from which a native molecular weight of 157,000 was calculated. A single protein or periodic acid-Schiff staining band of 135,000 Da was observed after Na dodecyl SO4 gel electrophoresis. Antibody was produced to guanylate cyclase and was shown by electrophoretic transfer experiments (Western blot) to interact with only the Mr = 135,000 band in cases where all of the detergent-extracted protein from spermatozoa was added to the Na dodecyl SO4 gels. Although guanylate cyclase was normally bound to concanavalin A-Sepharose, after endoglycosidase H treatment it failed to bind. Treatment of the enzyme with endoglycosidase H did not alter guanylate cyclase activity, but the apparent size of the enzyme decreased to 72,000 Da on Na dodecyl SO4 gels. An analysis of carbohydrate composition indicated that the oligosaccharides contained N-acetylglucosamine, mannose, galactose, and 2-aminoerythritol in molar ratios (1:3:0.75:2); after endoglycosidase H treatment the enzyme contained essentially no carbohydrate. Major amino acids in the enzyme were aspartic (Asn) and glutamic (Gln) which accounted for approximately 25 mol % of the enzyme amino acid composition. The purified enzyme displayed linear kinetics on double reciprocal plots and had a KMnGTP = 133 microM, KM2+ = 138 microM, KiMnGTP = 122 microM, KiMn2+ = 127 microM, and a V max in excess of 15 mumol of cyclic GMP formed/min/mg of protein at 30 degrees C. Sodium nitroprusside did not stimulate the enzyme in either the presence or absence of added hemeproteins. These results indicate that the particulate form of guanylate cyclase from sea urchin spermatozoa is a glycoprotein which is distinctly different than the soluble form of the enzyme found in mammalian tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1581079296,"Myosins IA and IB from Acanthamoeba castellanii are single-headed molecules which, upon phosphorylation of their heavy chains by a specific kinase, express actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity. These myosins show no tendency to self-associate under assay conditions, a property which allows unambiguous kinetic and actin-binding data to be obtained. Both myosin isoenzymes exhibit a complex dependence of actomyosin ATPase activity on F-actin concentration. A conventional hyperbolic dependence is observed at low concentrations of F-actin but at higher F-actin concentrations, inhibition and then apparent reactivation are seen to occur. From those early portions of the velocity profiles which do not deviate from simple Michaelis-Menten type kinetics, values for the Vmax (10 s-1 for myosin IA, 18 s-1 for myosin IB) and KATPase (0.25 microM for myosin IA, 0.30 microM for myosin IB) were calculated. Similar Vmax values were obtained from the reactivation segment of the kinetic data. The KATPase values are very similar to the directly measured dissociation constants (KD) of 0.10 microM for myosin IA and 0.25 microM for myosin IB. Phosphorylation of the myosin heavy chain, which elicits a greater than 20-fold activation of the actomyosin ATPase, has no effect on the binding of myosin to F-actin. This finding supports the conclusion that phosphorylation of myosins IA and IB accelerates one or more catalytic steps of the actomyosin I ATPase reaction at both low and high concentrations of F-actin."
https://openalex.org/W1584330270,"(Na,K)-ATPase is thought to maintain the transmembrane electrochemical sodium gradient which powers secondary active sodium-coupled transport of a variety of solutes including amino acids and bile acids. However, little is known regarding the effect of sodium-coupled solute transport on intracellular sodium concentration ( [Na]ic) and on (Na,K)-ATPase-mediated cation pumping in the intact cell. In order to address this question, we have measured 22Na uptake rate, steady state 22Na content, and ouabain-suppressible 86Rb uptake rate in primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes under a variety of conditions. Compared with control conditions (sodium uptake rate = 6.00 +/- 0.40 nmol X min-1 X mg-1; [Na]ic = 11.96 +/- 0.54 mM; cation pumping = 2.53 +/- 0.18 nmol X min-1 X mg-1), cation pumping was increased by taurocholate (less than or equal to 158%), alanine (less than or equal to 246%), monensin (less than or equal to 400%), and cold exposure (less than or equal to 525%), and this increase was accompanied by increases in Na uptake and [Na]ic. In contrast, preincubation in low sodium medium decreased all three variables. These changes in cation pumping were blocked in the absence of extracellular sodium and were not accompanied by changes in ouabain-suppressible ATP hydrolysis measured in cell homogenate. An overall plot of cation pumping versus [Na]ic yielded a sigmoid-shaped curve. Values for KNa (17.8 +/- 1.4 mM) and Vmax (8.98 +/- 0.62 nmol X min-1 X mg-1) for cation pumping were estimated assuming three sodium sites per pump unit. These findings indicate that: 1) uptake of alanine and taurocholate is associated with a rapid increase in (Na,K)-ATPase cation pumping; 2) this increase probably results from an increase in pumping per pump unit rather than an increase in the total number of pump units, and it appears to be mediated via an increase in sodium influx and [Na]ic; 3) [Na]ic under control conditions is close to the apparent KNa of cation pumping, implying that substrate availability may be the mechanism whereby sodium uptake is tightly linked to (Na,K)-ATPase cation pumping in intact hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1633427908,"Citrate, an allosteric activator of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, induces polymerization of an inactive protomeric form of the enzyme into an active filamentous form composed of 10-20 protomers. The light-scattering properties of the carboxylase were used to study the kinetics of its polymerization and depolymerization. From stopped flow kinetic studies, we have established that polymerization is a second order process, with a second order rate constant of 597,000 M-1 s-1. There appear to be two steps which limit polymerization of the inactive carboxylase protomer: 1) a rapid citrate-induced conformational change which is independent of enzyme concentration and leads to an active protomeric form of the enzyme (Beaty, N. B., and Lane, M. D. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 13043-13050, preceding paper) and 2) the dimerization of the active protomer, which constitutes the first step of polymerization and is enzyme concentration-dependent. Dimerization is the rate-limiting step of acetyl-CoA carboxylase polymerization. Depolymerization of fully polymerized acetyl-CoA carboxylase is caused by malonyl-CoA, ATP X Mg, and Mg2+. Both malonyl-CoA and ATP X Mg (and HCO-3) compete with citrate in the maintenance of a given state of the protomer-polymer equilibrium apparently by carboxylating the enzyme to form enzyme-biotin-CO-2 which destablizes the polymeric form. Free citrate is the species responsible for polymerizing the enzyme and Mg2+ causes depolymerization of the enzyme by lowering the concentration of free citrate."
https://openalex.org/W1513614787,"Coated vesicles from calf brain and rat liver contain cryptic receptors which recognize and bind lysosomal enzymes via mannose 6-phosphate residues on oligosaccharide side chains (Campbell, C. H., Fine, R. E., Squicciarini, J., and Rome, L. H. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 2628-2633). In addition to mannose 6-phosphate receptors, we now report that coated vesicles from calf brain and rat liver contain the lysosomal enzymes alpha-L-fucosidase, beta-galactosidase, beta-glucosidase, beta-hexosaminidase, alpha-L-iduronidase, and alpha-mannosidase. Enzyme activities co-migrated with coated vesicles purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Treatment of intact coated vesicles with pronase (0.05 mg/ml) had little effect on lysosomal enzyme activities, whereas a similar treatment of coated vesicles in the presence of 0.045% taurodeoxycholate resulted in the loss of most of the enzyme activities. Addition of 10 mM mannose 6-phosphate to disrupted liver coated vesicles specifically displaced up to 80% of the cryptic lysosomal enzyme activity. Disrupted liver coated vesicles and highly purified liver lysosomes were treated with anti-beta-hexosaminidase A and anti-beta-galactosidase antibodies and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. High molecular weight bands were present in the coated vesicle immunoprecipitates which were not present in the lysosome immunoprecipitates. The data suggest that coated vesicles contain mannose 6-phosphate receptor-bound lysosomal enzymes, some of which are of a higher molecular weight form. These higher molecular weight forms may represent newly synthesized enzymes that are en route to lysosomes."

The purified enzyme catalyzed a MgATP-dependent addition of glutamate to 5,10-methylene-tetrahydropteroylmono-, di-, and triglutamate substrates and metabolized (6R)-5,10-methylene-tetrahydro[3H]folate to the tetraglutamate derivative. Other folate derivatives were poor substrates or lacked activity. The specificity of the nucleotide site was wide. The magnesium salts of dATP, GTP, ITP, and UTP were effective alternate substrates for the reaction. The specificity of the glutamate binding site was very narrow. Of a wide variety of analogs tested, only L-homocysteate and 4-fluoroglutamate demonstrated affinity for the enzyme. Kinetic studies were consistent with an ordered Ter Ter mechanism with MgATP binding first to the enzyme, folate second, and glutamate last. The order of product dissociation from the enzyme was ADP, folate product, and Pi. This mechanism precludes the sequential addition of glutamate moieties to enzyme-bound folate. The Michaelis constants for (6R)-5,10-methylene-tetrahydropteroyldiglutamate, the most effective folate substrate, MgATP, and L-glutamate were 2.3 microM, 5.6 mM, and 423 microM, respectively. Adenosine 5'-(3-thio)triphosphate and beta, gamma-methylene-ATP were inhibitors of the reaction and had higher affinities for the enzyme than ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1547225277,"Nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase (EC 3.6.1.8) activity is associated with matrix vesicles purified from collagenase digests of fetal calf epiphyseal cartilage. This enzyme hydrolyzes nucleoside triphosphates to nucleotides and PPi, the latter inducing precipitation in the presence of Ca2+ and Pi. An assay for matrix vesicle nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase is developed using beta, gamma-methylene ATP as substrate. The assay is effective in the presence of matrix vesicle-associated ATPase, pyrophosphatase, and alkaline phosphatase activities. A soluble nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase is obtained from matrix vesicles by treatment with 5 mM sodium deoxycholate. The solubilized enzyme induced the precipitation of calcium phosphate in the presence of ATP, Ca2+, and Pi. Extraction of deoxycholate-solubilized enzymes from matrix vesicles with 1-butanol destroys nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase activity while enhancing the specific activities of ATPase, pyrophosphatase, and alkaline phosphatase. In solutions devoid of ATP and matrix vesicles, concentrations of PPi between 10 and 100 microM induce calcification in mixtures containing initial Ca2+ X P ion products of 3.5 to 7.9 mM2. This finding plus the discovery of nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase in matrix vesicles supports the view that these extracellular organelles induce calcium precipitation by the enzymatic production of PPi. Nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase is more active against pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphates than the corresponding purine derivatives. The pH optimum is 10.0 and the enzyme is neither activated nor inhibited by Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions or mixtures of the two. Vmax at pH 7.5 for beta, gamma-methylene ATP is 0.012 mumol of substrate hydrolyzed per min per mg of protein and Km is below 10 microM. The enzyme is irreversibly destroyed at pH 4 and is stable at pH 10.5."

Parental CHO cells and the revertants, LEC11.R9 and LEC12.R10, do not express this antigen as detected by a sensitive radioimmunoassay with a monoclonal antibody to SSEA-1. The presence of the SSEA-1 determinant correlates with the apparent de novo expression of specific N-acetylglucosaminide alpha(1,3)fucosyltransferase activities not detected in parental or revertant cell extracts. Several differences in the enzymes substrate specificities and their products have been identified. The combined data suggest that LEC11 and LEC12 mutants result from regulatory mutations affecting different fucosyltransferase genes."

In the presence of Na (100 mM) and K (20 mM), PTX showed potency nearly equal to that of ouabain. When the ATPase was activated by the various Na concentrations at a constant K concentration, both PTX and ouabain inhibited the ATPase activity noncompetitively. On the other hand, when K concentration was changed at a constant Na concentration, PTX caused a competitive inhibition in all ranges of K concentrations employed, whereas ouabain caused a competitive inhibition at low concentrations and a noncompetitive inhibition at high concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W163782554,"The release of Ca2+ from the terminal cisternae of sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle fiber triggers muscle contraction. The signal for Ca2+ release is mediated via the triad junction, i.e. the junctional association of terminal cisternae and transverse tubule. Recently, highly purified morphologically intact triads were isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle (Mitchell, R. D., Palade, P., and Fleischer, S. (1983) J. Cell Biol. 96, 1008-1016). In this study, biochemical characterization of two variants of purified triad preparations (Pyrophosphate and Standard) is provided. Terminal cisternae of triads sequester Ca2+ at rates comparable to those of purified heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum which is referable to terminal cisternae (Meissner, G. (1975) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 389, 51-68). The permeability for calcium ions, as reflected by a 2-3-fold stimulation of (Ca2+, Mg2+)-ATPase activity in the presence of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, and by the Ca2+ leak rate, is comparable in triads and heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum. Several transverse tubule characteristics are present in triads. Four of them, i.e. cholesterol content, ouabain binding, dihydroalprenolol binding (beta-adrenergic receptor), and ouabain-sensitive (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity, are comparably enriched in the Pyrophosphate triads and therefore appear to be quantitative indices of the amount of transverse tubule. Adenylate cyclase and basal ATPase are unreliable in this regard. Methodology for analyzing membrane integrity and sidedness was applied (adenylate cyclase activity) and modified (ouabain-sensitive (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity) to characterize the transverse tubule of the triad. In addition, a new method was developed making use of ouabain binding to study sidedness. These studies show that the transverse tubule is largely sealed and inside out in orientation, i.e. with the cytoplasmic face exposed. This report indicates that the t-tubule and sarcoplasmic reticulum components of the triads possess transport capability and retain permeability barriers for ions. Therefore, the isolated triads appear to be suitable for studying the physiological Ca2+ release process in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1519275945,"Abstract A mouse 3T6 subline that grows in glutamine-free medium has been cloned and exposed to a regimen of increasing concentrations of the glutamine synthetase inhibitor, methionine sulfoxime. Cells selected for resistance to 700 microM methionine sulfoxime show a 75-fold increase in glutamine synthetase activity relative to the original subclone. Immune precipitation of extracts prepared from cells pulse-labeled with L-[35S] methionine indicates that the increase in enzyme activity reflects an increase in biosynthesis of glutamine synthetase. Results obtained from in vitro translation followed by immune precipitation suggests that the methionine sulfoxime-resistant cells are highly enriched in mRNA encoding glutamine synthetase. The increase in enzyme activity is lost upon culture of the cells in nonselective medium--a finding consistent with the observation of double minute chromosomes in only the drug-resistant cells. These data strongly support the notion that methionine sulfoxime treatment has resulted in selection of cells that have amplified the gene encoding glutamine synthetase."

In addition, the immunochemically isolated primary translation products for glutamine synthetase from brain and liver mRNA are the same size. These data suggest that cytosolic brain and mitochondrial liver glutamine synthetase may be derived from the same gene."
https://openalex.org/W1594157279,"This work presents strong evidence that the role of the active site arginine in D-amino acid oxidase is to act as a positively charged group interacting with the flavin N(1)-C(2) = 0 locus. Modification with cyclohexanedione, which has been shown previously to modify specifically an active site arginine in D-amino acid oxidase (Ferti, C., Curti, B., Simonetta, M. P., Ronchi, S., Galliano, M., and Minchiotti, L. (1981) Eur. J. Biochem. 119, 553-557) destroys the ability of D-amino acid oxidase to stabilize the benzoquinoid type spectrum of 8-mercapto-FAD and destroys the ability to form a flavin N-5 adduct with sulfite. Both of these properties have been attributed to the presence of such a group. The active site lysine, histidine, and tyrosine have been ruled out as possibilities for such a group. In addition, the reactivity of flavoproteins containing 8-mercaptoflavin with sulfite has been examined and falls into the same two general classes as the reactivity of the native flavoproteins: oxidases form N-5 adducts while all of the other 8-mercaptoflavoproteins examined do not, forming instead the 8-sulfonate flavin."

https://openalex.org/W1486752501,"The changes in fluorescence of 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS-) have been used to determine binding of ligands to the (Ca2+, Mg2+)-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles, isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle. ANS- binds to sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes with an apparent Kd of 3.8 X 10(-5) M. The binding of ANS- had no effect on Ca2+ transport or Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity. EGTA, by binding endogenous Ca2+, increased the fluorescence intensity of bound ANS- by 10-12%. Subsequent addition of ATP, ADP, or Ca2+, in the presence or absence of Mg2+, reversed this change of fluorescence. The binding parameters, as determined by these decreases in fluorescence intensity, were as follows: for ATP, Kd = 1.0 X 10(-5) M, nH = 0.80; for ADP, Kd = 1.2 X 10(-5) M, nH = 0.89; and for Ca2+, Kd = 3.4 X 10(-7) M, nH = 1.8. The binding parameters for ITP and for the nonhydrolyzable analogue, adenyl-5'-yl-beta, gamma-methylene)diphosphate, were similar to those of ATP, but GDP, IDP, CDP, AMP, and cAMP had lower apparent affinities. Millimolar concentrations of pyrophosphate also decreased the fluorescence of bound ANS-, whereas orthophosphate caused a small (2-3%) increase in fluorescence in Ca2+-free media. Vanadate, in the presence of EGTA, decreased the fluorescence of bound ANS-with half-maximal effect at 4 X 10(-5) M. The changes of fluorescence intensity of bound ANS- appear to reflect conformational changes of the (Ca2+, Mg2+)-ATPase, consequent to ligand binding, with the low and high fluorescence intensity species corresponding to the E1 and E2 conformations, respectively. These appear to reflect similar conformational states of the (Ca2+, Mg2+)-ATPase to those reported by changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (DuPont, Y. (1976) Biochem, Biophys. Res. Commun. 71, 544-550)."
https://openalex.org/W1670876655,"A 174-kilodalton polypeptide of the Drosophila nuclear matrix-pore complex-lamina fraction has been identified as an ATPase/dATPase on the basis of direct UV photoaffinity labeling studies; a polypeptide with similar properties has been found in nuclear envelope fractions prepared from several vertebrate sources (Berrios, M., Blobel, G., and Fisher, P. A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 4548-4555). This ATPase/dATPase polypeptide co-migrates on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels with a glycoprotein also found in all of these fractions. In rat liver, this glycoprotein has been localized to the nuclear pore complex by means of immunoelectron microscopy (Gerace, L., Ottaviano, Y., and Kondor-Koch, C. (1982) J. Cell Biol. 95, 826-837). Following SDS denaturation and reduction/alkylation, chromatography of the Drosophila nuclear matrix-pore complex-lamina fraction on hydroxylapatite columns run in the presence of SDS results in the separation of two quantitatively major 174-kilodalton polypeptides. The peak of glycoprotein elution from the SDS-hydroxylapatite column correlates exactly with that of the early eluting 174-kilodalton species while the photolabeled ATPase/dATPase polypeptide co-chromatographs with the late eluting one. Identical results have been obtained with the rat liver nuclear envelope fraction. The chromatographically separated 174-kilodalton species from both organisms have been further distinguished through the use of polypeptide-specific antisera; finally, the glycoprotein purified from Drosophila embryos is fully sensitive to limited degradation by endoglycosidase H whereas the ATPase/dATPase polypeptide is completely resistant. We have thus established, using material obtained from two widely divergent higher eukaryotes, that the 174-kilodalton ATPase/dATPase is a quantitatively major nuclear matrix-pore complex-lamina component distinct from the nuclear pore complex glycoprotein of apparently identical molecular weight."
https://openalex.org/W1520536007,"The high affinity, sodium-dependent uptake of proline by rat brain synaptosomes was inhibited by the opioid pentapeptides, Leu-enkephalin and Met-enkephalin. The synaptosomal uptake of other putative neurotransmitter amino acids including glutamic acid, aspartic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and taurine was not altered in the presence of enkephalins. The uptake of a neuroinactive amino acid, leucine, was also unaffected by enkephalins. The extent of proline uptake was half-maximal at a Leu-enkephalin concentration of 1 microM. Both the initial rate of transport and the overall capacity for proline accumulation were reduced. The effect of the enkephalins was vectorial since carrier-mediated efflux of proline was not altered in the presence of enkephalins. Morphine and the opioid peptides, dynorphin and beta-endorphin, were without effect on proline uptake. The inhibition of proline uptake by enkephalins was not diminished by prior incubation of the synaptosomal preparation with naloxone; however, the inhibition was attenuated by 1-butanol. The des-tyrosyl fragments of the enkephalins were as inhibitory as the intact pentapeptides. A modified enkephalin ([D-Ser2]Leu-enkephalin-Thr) with selective affinity for the delta subclass of enkephalin receptor was effective in inhibiting proline uptake. On the basis of the selectivity of these effects, we propose that there is a specific population of nerve endings in the cerebral cortex that contains both a proline-transport system and binding sites for Leu- and Met-enkephalin and furthermore, that these binding sites may be related to the putative delta receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1483117959,"This paper demonstrates the presence of a single predominant form of high molecular weight somatostatin (Mr congruent to 15,000) in mouse hypothalamus as judged by a combination of purification procedures including molecular sieve filtration, reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography, isoelectric focusing, and gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. Furthermore, the conversion of the Mr = 15,000 somatostatin species by hypothalamic enzyme activities led to the formation of both somatostatin-14 and -28 which were identified by high pressure liquid chromatography. No evidence was found for the presence of molecular species containing the sequence of the (Tyr-7, Gly-10) derivative of somatostatin. These observations suggest that, in contrast to the situation encountered in the pancreas, a predominant form of prosomatostatin is synthesized in hypothalamic neurones. They indicate that, in the hypothalamus, both the tetradecapeptide and somatostatin-28 derive from a single prohormone."
https://openalex.org/W1492974744,"Further chemical evidence has been obtained using NaB3H4 to support our previous assignment of a thiol ester bond in human C3 (Tack, B. F., Harrison, R. A., Janatova, J., Thomas, M. L., and Prahl, J. W. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 5764-5768). Following trypsin activation of human C3 in the presence of NaB3H4, 3H was shown to have incorporated specifically into the alpha'-chain of C3b. Subsequent fragmentation of [3H]C3b with porcine elastase further localized the label to the C3d subdomain. Under identical conditions, native C3 or C3 pretreated with trypsin (C3b) showed low reactivity with NaB3H4. A tryptic peptide containing the 3H label was isolated following digestion of [3H]C3b on activated thiol-Sepharose. After hydrolysis and saponification of the peptide hydrolysate, amino acid analysis indicated that the 3H had been incorporated into alpha-amino-delta-hydroxyvaleric acid, the product expected from reduction of an ester bond involving a glutamyl residue. On sequence analysis of the labeled peptide, the 3H was shown to reside at the position of the glutamyl residue previously proposed to be involved in the thiol ester bond. The residue at this position was confirmed as alpha-amino-delta-[3H] hydroxyvaleric acid by high performance liquid chromatography analysis and, after back hydrolysis, by amino acid analysis. These data significantly strengthen earlier studies which indicated the presence of a beta-Cys-gamma-Glu thiol ester bond in human C3."
https://openalex.org/W1602804466,"Abstract Reaction of peroxides with 5-deazaflavin bound to glucose oxidase, lactate oxidase, or D-amino acid oxidase results in the formation of 5-deazaflavin 4a, 5-epoxide. The reaction of D-amino acid oxidase with m-chloroperoxybenzoate is an exception since the reagent reacts rapidly with the protein moiety to form m-chlorobenzoate which then binds noncovalently near the unmodified coenzyme. Epoxide bound to glucose oxidase is converted to deazaFAD X X in a reaction similar to that observed previously with oxynitrilase and glycolate oxidase. With lactate oxidase the epoxide is quite stable in the absence of light. With D-amino acid oxidase, denaturation of the protein is accompanied by the release of the epoxide into solution where it decomposes in a manner similar to that observed with model epoxide compounds at neutral pH. Reaction of deazaFAD X X with phosphodiesterase and alkaline phosphatase yields deazariboflavin X X. The same compound has been formed in model studies by exposing 5-deazariboflavin 4a,5-epoxide to alkaline conditions. Structural studies indicate that this reaction involves contraction of the pyrimidine ring to yield 4-ribityl-6,7-dimethyloxazolo[ 4,5-b ]quinolin-2(4H)-one. Model reaction studies are consistent with a mechanism initiated by alkaline hydrolysis of the pyrimidine ring at position 4 followed by two additional steps which proceed at neutral pH. A similar mechanism for the enzyme reactions appears likely since analogous intermediates are detected in the glycolate oxidase and the model reactions. The results suggest that position 4 of the coenzyme in oxynitrilase, glycolate oxidase, and glucose oxidase must be accessible to solvent and that the protein moiety must facilitate the initial hydrolysis of the pyrimidine ring since the enzyme reactions occur at neutral pH. Failure to observe formation of deazaFMN X X with lactate oxidase is attributed, at least in part, to the inaccessibility of the pyrimidine ring to solvent."

The (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity of rabbit lymph node cells and spleen lymphocytes was increased while that of erythrocytes did not show any response to concanavalin A exposure. Since only inhibition (50%) was observed when crude microsomes from rabbit thymocytes were incubated with concanavalin A, activation of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase appeared to require intact cells. Incubation of rabbit thymocytes in 10% rabbit serum for 20 h resulted in slightly increased fluidity of the innermost lipids of the cell membranes, as measured by fluorescence polarization of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene. Fluidity changes did not appear to be the mechanism of activation of ATPase by concanavalin A, since incubation of cells with concanavalin A for 1 h had no effect on membrane fluidity in either freshly isolated or 20-h preincubated thymocytes. Compared with fresh thymocytes, preincubated cells had about twice the number of concanavalin A binding sites. Preincubated thymocytes became temporarily permeable to trypan blue after concanavalin A exposure. The percentage of cells taking up dye reached a maximum of 65% at 45-60 min, but decreased to 18% after a total of 3 h of incubation."
https://openalex.org/W1507549362,"Abstract The mechanism of receptor-induced activation of adenylate cyclase has been proposed to involve an enhanced exchange of GDP for GTP. The kinetics of this process have not been investigated so far in the brain due to a spontaneous activation of the enzyme by guanyl nucleotides, which precludes the ability to follow receptor-dependent events. We show that it is possible to investigate the mechanism of receptor action in such systems by using a combination of guanosine 5'-(beta-gamma-imino)triphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) and guanosine 5'-(2-O-thio)diphosphate (GDP beta S). In pineal membranes, beta-adrenergic agonists increase the rate of adenylate cyclase activation by 10 or 100 microM Gpp(NH)p about 40-fold (0.023-0.9 min-1 kact) and decrease the inhibitory potency of GDP beta S nearly 1000-fold. As a result, 100 microM GDP beta S which blocks 90% of the activation by 10 microM Gpp(NH)p has no inhibitory effect in the presence of 10 microM Gpp(NH)p and 10 microM noradrenaline or isoproterenol. In caudate nucleus, dopamine does not appear to increase the rate of activation of adenylate cyclase by 10 microM Gpp(NH)p. Nevertheless, 100 microM GDP beta S blocks 90% of the activation by 10 microM Gpp(NH)p but has no inhibitory effects in the presence of dopamine. Thus, one can demonstrate that even weakly activating receptors have the capacity to facilitate a functional exchange of GDP beta S for Gpp(NH)p and measure the efficacy of the interaction between the receptor and the functionally linked guanyl nucleotide subunit."
