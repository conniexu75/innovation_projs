https://openalex.org/W2049253479,"Conformation-specific antibodies capable of monitoring the activation state of a G-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptor, the β2-adrenoceptor, reveals receptor and G-protein activation not only in the plasma membrane, but also in the endosome. It is widely assumed that G-protein-linked signalling occurs only at the plasma membrane. In this study, Mark von Zastrow and colleagues use conformation-specific single-chain antibodies to directly probe the activation of the β2-adrenoceptor, which is a prototypical G-protein-coupled receptor, and its cognate G protein, Gs, in living cells. They show that classical or canonical G-protein-linked signalling occurs from endosomes as well as from the plasma membrane. A long-held tenet of molecular pharmacology is that canonical signal transduction mediated by G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins is confined to the plasma membrane. Evidence supporting this traditional view is based on analytical methods that provide limited or no subcellular resolution1. It has been subsequently proposed that signalling by internalized GPCRs is restricted to G-protein-independent mechanisms such as scaffolding by arrestins2,3, or GPCR activation elicits a discrete form of persistent G protein signalling4,5,6,7,8,9, or that internalized GPCRs can indeed contribute to the acute G-protein-mediated response10. Evidence supporting these various latter hypotheses is indirect or subject to alternative interpretation, and it remains unknown if endosome-localized GPCRs are even present in an active form. Here we describe the application of conformation-specific single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) to directly probe activation of the β2-adrenoceptor, a prototypical GPCR11, and its cognate G protein, Gs (ref. 12), in living mammalian cells. We show that the adrenergic agonist isoprenaline promotes receptor and G protein activation in the plasma membrane as expected, but also in the early endosome membrane, and that internalized receptors contribute to the overall cellular cyclic AMP response within several minutes after agonist application. These findings provide direct support for the hypothesis that canonical GPCR signalling occurs from endosomes as well as the plasma membrane, and suggest a versatile strategy for probing dynamic conformational change in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2067203693,"The co-morbidity of anxiety and dysfunctional reward processing in illnesses such as addiction and depression suggests that common neural circuitry contributes to these disparate neuropsychiatric symptoms. The extended amygdala, including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), modulates fear and anxiety, but also projects to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a region implicated in reward and aversion, thus providing a candidate neural substrate for integrating diverse emotional states. However, the precise functional connectivity between distinct BNST projection neurons and their postsynaptic targets in the VTA, as well as the role of this circuit in controlling motivational states, have not been described. Here we record and manipulate the activity of genetically and neurochemically identified VTA-projecting BNST neurons in freely behaving mice. Collectively, aversive stimuli exposure produced heterogeneous firing patterns in VTA-projecting BNST neurons. By contrast, in vivo optically identified glutamatergic projection neurons displayed a net enhancement of activity to aversive stimuli, whereas the firing rate of identified GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-containing) projection neurons was suppressed. Channelrhodopsin-2-assisted circuit mapping revealed that both BNST glutamatergic and GABAergic projections preferentially innervate postsynaptic non-dopaminergic VTA neurons, thus providing a mechanistic framework for in vivo circuit perturbations. In vivo photostimulation of BNST glutamatergic projections resulted in aversive and anxiogenic behavioural phenotypes. Conversely, activation of BNST GABAergic projections produced rewarding and anxiolytic phenotypes, which were also recapitulated by direct inhibition of VTA GABAergic neurons. These data demonstrate that functionally opposing BNST to VTA circuits regulate rewarding and aversive motivational states, and may serve as a crucial circuit node for bidirectionally normalizing maladaptive behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W1971994650,"Behavioural states in mammals, such as the anxious state, are characterized by several features that are coordinately regulated by diverse nervous system outputs, ranging from behavioural choice patterns to changes in physiology (in anxiety, exemplified respectively by risk-avoidance and respiratory rate alterations). Here we investigate if and how defined neural projections arising from a single coordinating brain region in mice could mediate diverse features of anxiety. Integrating behavioural assays, in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology, respiratory physiology and optogenetics, we identify a surprising new role for the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the coordinated modulation of diverse anxiety features. First, two BNST subregions were unexpectedly found to exert opposite effects on the anxious state: oval BNST activity promoted several independent anxious state features, whereas anterodorsal BNST-associated activity exerted anxiolytic influence for the same features. Notably, we found that three distinct anterodorsal BNST efferent projections-to the lateral hypothalamus, parabrachial nucleus and ventral tegmental area-each implemented an independent feature of anxiolysis: reduced risk-avoidance, reduced respiratory rate, and increased positive valence, respectively. Furthermore, selective inhibition of corresponding circuit elements in freely moving mice showed opposing behavioural effects compared with excitation, and in vivo recordings during free behaviour showed native spiking patterns in anterodorsal BNST neurons that differentiated safe and anxiogenic environments. These results demonstrate that distinct BNST subregions exert opposite effects in modulating anxiety, establish separable anxiolytic roles for different anterodorsal BNST projections, and illustrate circuit mechanisms underlying selection of features for the assembly of the anxious state."

We believe that by developing a 'chemical probe tool kit', and a framework for its use, chemical biology can have a more central role in identifying targets of potential relevance to disease, avoiding many of the biases that complicate target validation as practiced currently."

https://openalex.org/W1999060084,"Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 is an extrahepatic monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of endogenous substrates and drugs, as well as the activation of certain toxins and environmental pollutants. CYP1A1 is particularly well known for its ability to biotransform polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzo[a]pyrene in tobacco smoke, into carcinogens. CYP1A1 possesses functional similarities and differences with human CYP1A2 and CYP1B1 enzymes, but the structural basis for this has been unclear. We determined a 2.6 Å structure of human CYP1A1 with the inhibitor α-naphthoflavone. α-Naphthoflavone binds within an enclosed active site, with the planar benzochromen-4-one core packed flat against the I helix that composes one wall of the active site, and the 2-phenyl substituent oriented toward the catalytic heme iron. Comparisons with previously determined structures of the related cytochrome P450 1A2 and 1B1 enzymes reveal distinct features among the active sites that may underlie the functional variability of these enzymes. Finally, docking studies probed the ability of CYP1A structures to assist in understanding their known in vitro interactions with several typical substrates and inhibitors.

Guengerich F.P. Contributions of human enzymes in carcinogen metabolism.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2012; 25: 1316-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). CYP1A1-mediated metabolism of environmental contaminants can lead to reactive metabolites that form DNA adducts that contribute to mutagenesis and ultimately tumor formation (11Wogan G.N. Hecht S.S. Felton J.S. Conney A.H. Loeb L.A. Environmental and chemical carcinogenesis.Semin. Cancer Biol. 2004; 14: 473-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Such CYP1A1 substrates include combustion and tobacco products, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), heterocyclic aromatic amines found in charred meat, and industrial arylamines (12Shimada T.

Constitutive CYP1A1 expression is generally low, but this enzyme can be greatly induced by many of its own substrates, particularly the PAHs, via the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear receptor (14Hankinson O. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor complex.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). For example, CYP1A1 mRNA levels are very high in the lung cells of smokers but typically undetectable in nonsmokers (15Willey J.C. Coy E.L. Frampton M.W. Torres A. Apostolakos M.J. Hoehn G. Schuermann W.H. Thilly W.G. Olson D.E. Hammersley J.R. Crespi C.L. Utell M.J.

Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). CYP1A1 protein is also higher in smokers compared with nonsmokers (lung median levels of 16 versus 6.5 pmol/mg microsomal protein, respectively) (16Kim J.H. Sherman M.E. Curriero F.C. Guengerich F.P.

This induction and procarcinogen activation make CYP1A1 a high interest target for potential chemopreventative agents (19Androutsopoulos V.P. Tsatsakis A.M. Spandidos D.A. Cytochrome P450 CYP1A1. Wider roles in cancer progression and prevention.BMC Cancer. 2009; 9: 187Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Inhibitors such as dietary flavonoids can block the production of reactive metabolites and thus DNA damage. For example, the flavone acacetin can inhibit CYP1A1-mediated 7-ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylation with an IC50 of 80 nm (20Doostdar H. Burke M.D. Mayer R.T. Bioflavonoids. Selective substrates and inhibitors for cytochrome P450 CYP1A and CYP1B1.Toxicology. 2000; 144: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and the flavone apigenin can eliminate detectable DNA adduct formation by CYP1A1 activation of benzo[a]pyrene (21Lautraite S. Musonda A.C. Doehmer J. Edwards G.O. Chipman J.K. Flavonoids inhibit genetic toxicity produced by carcinogens in cells expressing CYP1A2 and CYP1A1.Mutagenesis. 2002; 17: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, in certain malignancies that overexpress CYP1A1, another therapeutic approach utilizes this enzyme to activate anticancer prodrugs to reactive electrophilic species that inhibit tumor growth (22Reid J.M.

Recently the first x-ray structures have become available for the two other enzymes of the human CYP1 family, CYP1A2 (24Sansen S. Yano J.K. Reynald R.L. Schoch G.A. Griffin K.J. Stout C.D.

Hepatic CYP1A2 is 72% identical in amino acid sequence to CYP1A1 and metabolizes caffeine, phenacetin, heterocyclic aromatic amines (26Hammons G.J. Milton D. Stepps K. Guengerich F.P. Tukey R.H.

Insights into the substrate specificity, inhibitors, regulation, and polymorphisms and the clinical impact of human cytochrome P450 1A2.AAPS J. 2009; 11: 481-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Like CYP1A1, CYP1B1 is an extrahepatic enzyme but has low amino acid sequence identity with both CYP1A1 (38%) and CYP1A2 (37%). This is less than the 40% usually required to be classified to the same cytochrome P450 family, but the grouping was nonetheless assigned on the basis of their common induction by aryl hydrocarbon nuclear receptor and similar substrate specificities toward such compounds as PAHs, heterocyclic aromatic amines (30Shimada T. Hayes C.L. Yamazaki H. Amin S. Hecht S.S. Guengerich F.P. Sutter T.R.

However, there are also a number of functional differences among these three enzymes, and without a CYP1A1 structure, a basis for evaluating the features responsible for functional similarities and differences among human CYP1 enzymes has been lacking. Herein we report a 2.6 Å structure of human CYP1A1 with the inhibitor α-naphthoflavone (ANF), which establishes structural elements for understanding ligand binding and thus may facilitate the design of new anticancer therapeutics. In addition, we compare and contrast the CYP1A1 active site residues and cavities with those of the other two members of the CYP1 family. Because other mammalian cytochrome P450 enzymes often have flexible active sites that depend on the ligand (32Porubsky P.R. Battaile K.P. Scott E.E.

Chem. 2012; 287: 10834-10843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we use docking to evaluate the practical question of whether this single structure of human CYP1A1 is sufficient to understand the binding of other ligands including substrates and inhibitors or whether further structures with different ligand scaffolds will be necessary to elucidate the full functional capacity of these enzymes. Finally, these docking outcomes were compared with docking of the same compounds to CYP1A2 to evaluate the implications of protein active site differences on ligand orientations and metabolism. The cDNA (34Liu J. Ericksen S.S. Besspiata D. Fisher C.W. Szklarz G.D. Characterization of substrate binding to cytochrome P450 1A1 using molecular modeling and kinetic analyses. Case of residue 382.Drug Metab. Dispos. 2003; 31: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) for human CYP1A1 was truncated to remove the coding sequence for the N-terminal transmembrane residues 2–34 and to substitute nucleotides coding for the hydrophilic amino acid sequence AKKTSS, a modification that has enabled the crystallization of many membrane cytochromes P450 to date, including CYP1B1. CYP1A2, however, was expressed with simply a truncation. For CYP1A1, nucleotides were added to code for a six-residue histidine tag at the C terminus immediately prior to the stop codon. This modified cDNA was inserted into the pKK233-2 plasmid to generate the pKK1A1(MAK)H6 construct, which was transformed into tetracycline-resistant Escherichia coli TOPP-3 cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) previously transformed with the pGro7 plasmid containing the gene for GroEL/ES (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan). Individual colonies were grown at 37 °C overnight on lysogeny broth-agarose plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin to select for the pKK1A1(MAK)H6 plasmid and 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol to select for the pGro7 plasmid. A single colony was grown in 5 ml of lysogeny broth medium supplemented with ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and 25 μg/ml tetracycline for ∼12 h at 37 °C and 250 rpm. Fifty microliters of this culture were added to 200 ml of lysogeny broth containing ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline and grown for ∼12 h at 37 °C and 250 rpm. Fifteen milliliters from this 200-ml culture was added to each of 18 one-liter flasks containing 225 ml of terrific broth medium, 25 ml of terrific broth salts, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and arabinose (0.5 mg/ml, to induce expression of GroES and GroEL chaperone proteins). The cells were then grown at 37 °C at 250 rpm for ∼2 h or until the A600 reached 0.6. At this time 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranodide and 80 μg/ml δ-aminolevulinic acid were added. E. coli was subsequently grown at 30 °C at 190 rpm for ∼72 h, after which time they were harvested, and the cell pellet was stored at −80 °C until purification. Protein purification was carried out at 4 °C. The cell pellet from 2.25 liters of culture was thawed and resuspended in 200 ml of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 20% glycerol. Lysozyme (0.2 mg/ml) was added to the cell pellet suspension and stirred for 30 min followed by the addition of 200 ml of cold water with stirring for 10 min. Spheroplasts were collected by centrifuging at 8,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellets were flash frozen in an ethanol/dry ice bath, thawed, and resuspended in 100 ml of 500 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol. This solution was homogenized, divided into three 50-ml aliquots, sonicated three times for 30 s each with 1 min on ice between each sonication, and centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 15 min. The ligand ANF (10 μm) and the detergent CHAPS (1% w/v) were added with stirring for 30 min to stabilize and solubilize CYP1A1, respectively. Solubilized CYP1A1 was separated from membrane lipids by ultracentrifugation at 80,000 × g for 60 min. The CYP1A1 protein was purified from the resulting supernatant by metal affinity, ion exchange, and size exclusion chromatography. Initially the ultracentrifuge supernatant was applied to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.5% CHAPS, and 10 μm ANF. The column was washed with two CV of equilibration buffer followed by twelve CV of equilibration buffer including 3.2 mm histidine. Elution was accomplished using two CV of 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.5% CHAPS, 10 μm ANF, 2 mm EDTA, and 150 mm histidine. Eluted fractions containing significant red color were pooled; diluted 5-fold with 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 0.5% CHAPS, 10 μm ANF, and 1 mm EDTA; and applied to a 5-ml carboxymethylcellulose-Sepharose FF column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with six CV of dilution buffer and eluted with two CV of carboxymethylcellulose elution buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, 0.5% CHAPS, 10 μm ANF, and 1 mm EDTA). Red fractions were pooled, concentrated to 1 ml, and loaded onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) that had been equilibrated with carboxymethylcellulose elution buffer. The purest protein fractions were identified by the A393/A280 ratio (typically exceeding 1.1) and concentrated to 20 mg/ml by centrifugal ultrafiltration. During concentration, CYP1A1 was washed with carboxymethylcellulose elution buffer including 100 μm ANF and 0.4 m NH4NO3 to facilitate saturation with ligand and crystallization, respectively. Typical yields were 40–70 nmol/liter of E. coli culture. The spectral ligand binding assay was performed as described previously (35DeVore N.M. Smith B.D. Wang J.L. Lushington G.H. Scott E.E. Key residues controlling binding of diverse ligands to human cytochrome P450 2A enzymes.Drug Metab. Dispos. 2009; 37: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with a protein concentration of 1 μm. CYP1A1 crystals were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Twenty-four-well crystallization plates were set up on ice with drops composed of 1 μl of the 20 mg/ml CYP1A1-ANF protein complex and 1 μl of well solution, which consisted of 0.1 m bis-Tris propane/HCl pH 8.5 (Emerald Biosystems, Bainbridge Island, WA), 200 mm sodium malonate (Emerald Biosystems), 20% (w/v) PEG 3350 (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA), and 14% glycerol. Drops were equilibrated against 1 ml of this well solution. The plates were incubated at 4 °C for 7 days yielded triangular prism-shaped crystals that were subsequently immersed in cryoprotectant (well solution with 30% PEG 3350, 13% glycerol, and 100 μm ANF), harvested, and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen for storage until data collection. A data set was collected from a single crystal at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (Stanford, CA) Beamline 9-2 at a wavelength of 0.979 Å. Data integration and scaling were carried out employing the programs MOSFLM (36Leslie A.G. The integration of macromolecular diffraction data.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Residues within 10 Å of the docked ligand comprised the flexible region of the protein during all docking runs. Twenty distinct binding complexes obtained by the Monte Carlo search technique were subjected to simulated annealing prior to energy ranking, and the 10 lowest energy binding orientations were evaluated. When purified without the addition of ANF, the absolute spectrum of CYP1A1 exhibits an absorbance peak at 419 nm, suggesting that the enzyme exists in a low spin state with water bound to the heme iron. However, when ANF is added during purification to stabilize the enzyme, the Soret peak occurs at 393 nm, consistent with the high spin state as ligand binding displaces the water. Monitoring this spectral shift upon titration of ligand-free CYP1A1 with ANF permitted estimation of the Kd as ∼300 nm, but this estimate was limited by absorbance of the ANF itself at higher ligand concentrations. In contrast, CYP1A2 was reportedly isolated already in the high spin state, and the addition of ANF had no effect on the spin state (50Sandhu P. Guo Z. Baba T. Martin M.V. Tukey R.H. Guengerich F.P.

The present study investigated the function of the miR17-92 cluster in adult neural progenitor cells after experimental stroke. We found that stroke substantially up-regulated miR17-92 cluster expression in neural progenitor cells of the adult mouse. Overexpression of the miR17-92 cluster either in cultured ischemic neural progenitor cells or in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of ischemic animals significantly increased cell proliferation, whereas inhibition of individual members of the miR17-92 cluster, miR-18a and miR-19a, suppressed cell proliferation and increased cell death. The miR17-92 cluster mediated PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) expression, which is a predicted target of the miR17-92 cluster. Addition of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) protein up-regulated miR17-92 expression and elevated c-Myc protein in ischemic neural progenitor cells, whereas blockade of the Shh signaling pathway down-regulated miR17-92 cluster expression and reduced c-Myc levels. Overexpression of c-Myc up-regulated miR17-92 cluster expression. Intraventricular infusion of Shh and a Shh receptor inhibitor, cyclopamine, to ischemic animals further elevated and suppressed, respectively, miR17-92 cluster expression in the SVZ. These data indicate that the miR17-92 cluster plays an important role in mediating neural progenitor cell function and that the Shh signaling pathway is involved in up-regulating miR17-92 cluster expression."

https://openalex.org/W2146237016,"The dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen responsible for an estimated 100 million human infections annually. The viral genome encodes a two-component trypsin-like protease that contains the cofactor region from the nonstructural protein NS2B and the protease domain from NS3 (NS3pro). The NS2B-NS3pro complex plays a crucial role in viral maturation and has been identified as a potential drug target. Using a DENV protease construct containing NS2B covalently linked to NS3pro via a Gly4-Ser-Gly4 linker (""linked protease""), previous x-ray crystal structures show that the C-terminal fragment of NS2B is remote from NS3pro and exists in an open state in the absence of an inhibitor; however, in the presence of an inhibitor, NS2B complexes with NS3pro to form a closed state. This linked enzyme produced NMR spectra with severe signal overlap and line broadening. To obtain a protease construct with a resolved NMR spectrum, we expressed and purified an unlinked protease complex containing a 50-residue segment of the NS2B cofactor region and NS3pro without the glycine linker using a coexpression system. This unlinked protease complex was catalytically active at neutral pH in the absence of glycerol and produced dispersed cross-peaks in a (1)H-(15)N heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectrum that enabled us to conduct backbone assignments using conventional techniques. In addition, titration with an active-site peptide aldehyde inhibitor and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement studies demonstrated that the unlinked DENV protease exists predominantly in a closed conformation in solution. This protease complex can serve as a useful tool for drug discovery against DENV."
https://openalex.org/W2067533256,"The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is critical in normal development. However, it has been reported to be up-regulated in numerous cancers and implicated in tumorigenicity and metastasis. Classical activation of Hh signaling initiated by Hh ligands results in activation of Smoothened (SMOH) and culminates in the activation of the GLI transcription factors. Classical Hh signaling is autocrine or paracrine (involving interaction between tumor cells and their stroma/microenvironment). The tumor milieu is rich in inflammatory cytokines that can modulate tumor cell behavior. Here, we show for the first time that the Hh pathway can be nonclassically up-regulated by the inflammatory cytokine, osteopontin (OPN). OPN-initiated Akt-GSK3β signaling mediates the subcellular distribution and activation of GLI1 resulting in the modulation of epithelial mesenchymal plasticity and drug resistance. Interestingly, the SMOH inhibitor cyclopamine was unable to uncouple the effects of OPN on Hh signaling, indicating that OPN nonclassically activates GLI-mediated transcription. Given the fact that OPN is itself transcriptionally activated upon Hh signaling, our current findings highlight the possibility of a feedforward vicious cycle such that the Hh pathway might be turned on nonclassically by stimuli from the tumor milieu. Thus, drugs that target the classical Hh ligand-mediated activation of Hh signaling may be compromised in their ability to interfere with the functioning of the pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2139343303,"Cancer cachexia is characterized by a continuous loss of locomotor skeletal muscle mass, which causes profound muscle weakness. If this atrophy and weakness also occurs in diaphragm muscle, it could lead to respiratory failure, which is a major cause of death in patients with cancer. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to determine whether colon-26 (C-26) cancer cachexia causes diaphragm muscle fiber atrophy and weakness and compromises ventilation. All diaphragm muscle fiber types were significantly atrophied in C-26 mice compared to controls, and the atrophy-related genes, atrogin-1 and MuRF1, significantly increased. Maximum isometric specific force of diaphragm strips, absolute maximal calcium activated force, and maximal specific calcium-activated force of permeabilized diaphragm fibers were all significantly decreased in C-26 mice compared to controls. Further, isotonic contractile properties of the diaphragm were affected to an even greater extent than isometric function. Ventilation measurements demonstrated that C-26 mice have a significantly lower tidal volume compared to controls under basal conditions and, unlike control mice, an inability to increase breathing frequency, tidal volume, and, thus, minute ventilation in response to a respiratory challenge. These data demonstrate that C-26 cancer cachexia causes profound respiratory muscle atrophy and weakness and ventilatory dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W1997552651,"The sensations of pain, itch, and cold often interact with each other. Pain inhibits itch, whereas cold inhibits both pain and itch. TRPV1 and TRPA1 channels transduce pain and itch, whereas TRPM8 transduces cold. The pruritogen chloroquine (CQ) was reported to excite TRPA1, leading to the sensation of itch. It is unclear how CQ excites and modulates TRPA1+, TRPV1+, and TRPM8+ neurons and thus affects the sensations of pain, itch, and cold. Here, we show that only 43% of CQ-excited dorsal root ganglion neurons expressed TRPA1; as expected, the responses of these neurons were completely prevented by the TRPA1 antagonist HC-030031. The remaining 57% of CQ-excited neurons did not express TRPA1, and excitation was not prevented by either a TRPA1 or TRPV1 antagonist but was prevented by the general transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channel blocker BTP2 and the selective TRPC3 inhibitor Pyr3. Furthermore, CQ caused potent sensitization of TRPV1 in 51.9% of TRPV1+ neurons and concomitant inhibition of TRPM8 in 48.8% of TRPM8+ dorsal root ganglion neurons. Sensitization of TRPV1 is caused mainly by activation of the phospholipase C-PKC pathway following activation of the CQ receptor MrgprA3. By contrast, inhibition of TRPM8 is caused by a direct action of activated Gαq independent of the phospholipase C pathway. Our data suggest the involvement of the TRPC3 channel acting together with TRPA1 to mediate CQ-induced itch.

Under pathological conditions such as inflammation, the activities of these ion channels are either sensitized (e.g. TRPV1 and TRPA1) or inhibited (e.g. TRPM8) through different signaling mechanisms, leading to a more painful outcome. Sensitization of TRPV1 and TRPA1 by inflammatory mediators that activate Gαq-coupled G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is caused mainly by activation of the phospholipase C (PLC) signaling pathway (8Wang S.

In contrast to pain, the transduction of itch (pruritus) is less well-understood. There are two different types of itch, histamine-dependent (histaminergic) and histamine-independent (non-histaminergic), although the majority of pruritus is non-histaminergic and cannot be treated with antihistamines (11Jeffry J. Kim S. Chen Z.F. Itch signaling in the nervous system.Physiology. 2011; 26: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Non-histaminergic itch is normally caused by exogenous pruritogens such as cowhage and chloroquine (CQ) (12Davidson S. Zhang X. Yoon C.H. Khasabov S.G. Simone D.A. Giesler Jr., G.J.

Pruritogens cause itching by exciting sensory neurons largely through activation of Gαq-coupled GPCRs, which then couple to downstream excitable ion channels, predominantly TRP ion channels. For example, histamine excites sensory neurons by activating TRPV1 through a signaling mechanism involving both the PLCβ3 and phospholipase A2-lipoxygenase pathways (15Shim W.S. Tak M.H. Lee M.H.

However, it is unclear how itching stimuli such as CQ affect the pain and cold pathways. In this study, we investigated how the non-histaminergic pruritogen CQ can excite and modulate the activity of TRPV1+, TRPA1+, and TRPM8+ DRG neurons, which are involved in transducing pain, itch, and cold. DRG neurons were isolated from neonatal C57BL/6 mice as described previously (25Zhang X. Huang J. McNaughton P.A. NGF rapidly increases membrane expression of TRPV1 heat-gated ion channels.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4211-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice of either sex were killed by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation. DRGs were collected from all cervical, thoracic, and lumbar segments and incubated in calcium- and magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) containing 2.5 mg/ml type IV collagenase (Worthington Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, DRGs were washed with DMEM (Invitrogen) followed by trituration with 25-gauge needles to dissociate neurons. The dissociated neurons were plated onto coverslips precoated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and laminin (BD Biosciences) and cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin supplemented with 5 μm cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside (Sigma) and 1× N2 supplement (Invitrogen). Cultured neurons were used for experiments within 24 h after plating. DRG neurons were also isolated from adult mice (22 days after birth) and cultured in a similar manner as the neonatal DRG neurons. NGF and Glial cell-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF) were not used for DRG cultures to avoid inducing the expression of TRP channels. The HEK293 cell line and mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells lacking endogenous Gαq/11 (26Offermanns S. Zhao L.P. Gohla A. Sarosi I. Simon M.I. Wilkie T.M.

Briefly, cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding rat TRPM8 and MrgprA3 using PolyFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Briefly, 4.0 μg of cDNAs was incubated with 20 μl of PolyFect reagent in 150 μl of serum-free DMEM for 10 min. After incubation, the solution was added to the cells and incubated for 24 h. Transfected cells were then replated onto small dishes for electrophysiological recording. MEF cells were transfected using cell line nucleofection kits (Lonza). Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of transfection solution containing 4.0 μg of cDNAs and electroporated using an Amaxa device. After transfection, cells were plated onto small dishes and used for electrophysiology recordings in 24 h. Calcium imaging was performed at room temperature as described previously (10Zhang X. Mak S.

Briefly, DRG neurons plated onto a coverslip were incubated with 7 μm Fluo-4-AM (Invitrogen) for 40 min at 37 °C. After loading, cell-containing coverslips were transferred to a custom-made chamber and continuously perfused with normal Hanks' solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm glucose (pH 7.4) with NaOH. Cell images were collected every 3 s using a Bio-Rad confocal microscope. Bradykinin (BK, 1 μm), histamine (100 μm), and CQ (1 mm) were pulsed onto cells for 2 min, whereas pulses of menthol (100 μm), allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) (100 μm), and capsaicin (500 nm) were applied for 15 s. All chemicals were applied every 4 min sequentially as appropriate to the individual experiment. To study the effect of PKC, cells were pretreated with the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM; Calbiochem) as described previously (10Zhang X. Mak S. Li L. Parra A. Denlinger B. Belmonte C. McNaughton P.A. Direct inhibition of the cold-activated TRPM8 ion channel by Gαq.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) inhibitor YM58483 (BTP2; Tocris Bioscience), the TRPC3 inhibitor Pyr3 (Tocris Bioscience), the TRPA1 inhibitor HC-030031 (Tocris Bioscience), and ruthenium red (Sigma) were applied as indicated in individual experiments. Ionomycin was applied at the end of experiment to allow maximal calcium influx. Neurons unresponsive to ionomycin were excluded for further analysis. We considered that a chemical induced a calcium response in DRG neurons if the difference between the elicited peak calcium response and the base-line fluorescence (ΔF/Fmax) was >0.06. We also performed similar calcium imaging experiments in calcium-free Hanks' solution. Under these conditions, no significant calcium responses (0 of 694 neurons) were observed for all chemicals, excluding the possibility of the contribution of intracellular calcium stores to excited calcium responses. To study the modulation of TRPV1 and TRPM8 by CQ, the effect of CQ was quantified as a response ratio by dividing the fifth peak response amplitude by the fourth peak response amplitude. In control experiments on cells not exposed to CQ, the distribution of response ratios was found to be well fitted by a normal distribution (see Fig. 3E), from which a threshold ratio was derived at a 95% confidence level and used to determine cells significantly sensitized by CQ. Tubby-R332H-cYFP (where “c” indicates C-terminal; kindly provided by Dr. Gerald Hammond) translocation was determined by live scanning using a Leica confocal microscopy. Images of MEF cells transfected with the fluorescence probe and MrgprA3 were collected every 0.75 s. The translocation of Tubby-R332H-cYFP was quantified by calculating the ratio of membrane fluorescence to cytosol fluorescence using ImageJ software. Neurons were first examined by calcium imaging. CQ-sensitive neurons in each category were then aspirated into a glass electrode and transferred into a PCR tube. The total RNA was isolated from the collected neurons using the RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen) followed by reverse transcription with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The products of reverse transcription were then amplified by PCR with the primers listed in Table 1. Cycling conditions were as follows: 2 min at 95 °C; 50 cycles of 50 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 60 °C, and 46 s at 72 °C; and 5 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were then analyzed on 1% agarose gel.TABLE 1Primer sequences for single-cell RT-PCRGenePrimer sequencesProduct lengthGenBankTM accession no.bpMrgprA3150NM_153067.2Forward5′-CGACAATGACACCCACAACAA-3′Reverse5′-GGAAGCCAAGGAGCCAGAAC-3′TRPV1362NM_001001445.1Forward5′-CTGGAGCTGTTCAAGTTCACC-3′Reverse5′-TTGGTGTTCCAGGTAGTCCAG-3′TRPA1684AY231177Forward5′-CCAAGATGCCTTCAGCACCC-3′Reverse5′-GGGTGGCTAATAGAACAATGTGTTTTAGTC-3′TRPM8458NM_134252.Forward5′-GTGGGAGCAACTGTCTGGAGC-3′Reverse5′-GTGTCCATAACGTTCCATAGGTCG-3′TRPC3317NM_019510.2Forward5′-GGAACTGGGCATGGGTAACTC-3′Reverse5′-CACTGGGGTTCAGTTTCTCACTG-3′GAPDH302NM_008084Forward5′-CATCCATGACAACTTTGGCA-3′Reverse5′-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTG-3′ Open table in a new tab Whole-cell patch recordings were performed largely as described previously (9Zhang X.

Briefly, patch electrodes were filled with an internal solution of 140 mm KCl, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 5.0 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) with KOH. Standard Hanks' solution was used as the external solution. TRPV1 inward currents were recorded at a holding potential of −60 mV. For recordings of the TRPM8 current, we used calcium-free solution in which 1.8 mm CaCl2 was replaced with 5 mm EGTA to prevent the interference of calcium-dependent desensitization. TRPM8 inward and outward currents were measured at holding potentials of −60 and +60 mV, respectively. Cells were pretreated with 1 mm CQ for 1 min before break in to the whole cell to measure TRPM8 currents activated by menthol. Series resistance was routinely ≤10.0 megohms and was compensated by >70%. All recordings were made at room temperature (24 °C) with an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Axon) in conjunction with pClampex version 10.2 software (Molecular Devices). Signals were analog-filtered using a 1-kHz low-pass Bessel filter. This was performed as described previously with some modifications (10Zhang X. Mak S. Li L. Parra A. Denlinger B. Belmonte C. McNaughton P.A. Direct inhibition of the cold-activated TRPM8 ion channel by Gαq.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells expressing TRPM8-V5 and MrgprA3 were solubilized, and TRPM8 was precipitated using anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) and protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The coprecipitates were then analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a blot. Gαq protein was detected with anti-Gαq polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The V5 tag does not affect the binding of Gαq to TRPM8 because Gαq can also be similarly precipitated using anti-TRPM8 polyclonal antibody (10Zhang X. Mak S. Li L. Parra A. Denlinger B. Belmonte C.

Differences between groups were assessed by one-way analysis of variance with the Bonferroni post hoc test. Results were considered significant at p < 0.05. CQ is traditionally used to treat malaria. One of the common side effects associated with CQ therapy is the production of serious itching. CQ-induced itching has recently been found to be caused by the excitation of the TRPA1 ion channel in DRG neurons after activation of the CQ receptor MrgprA3 (18Wilson S.R. Gerhold K.A. Bifolck-Fisher A. Liu Q. Patel K.N. Dong X. Bautista D.M. TRPA1 is required for histamine-independent, Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor-mediated itch.Nat.

Sensory neuron-specific GPCR Mrgprs are itch receptors mediating chloroquine-induced pruritus.Cell. 2009; 139: 1353-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear which populations of DRG neurons are excited by CQ and how they relate to TRPV1+, TRPA1+, and TRPM8+ neurons, which mediate the sensations of pain, itch, and cold. To investigate this question, we assessed the responses of neonatal DRG neurons after sequential exposure to CQ, the TRPM8 agonist menthol, the TRPA1 agonist AITC, and the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin by monitoring intracellular calcium rises. Two minutes of CQ treatment rapidly induced calcium increases in a subpopulation of neurons (Fig. 1, A–D). About 12.8% (344 of 2693 total neurons) of DRG neurons were found to be excited by CQ (Fig. 1, F and H). Strikingly, only 43.3% (149 of 344) of these neurons also responded to AITC and thus coexpressed TRPA1 (Fig. 1B, F, and H); some of these neurons (99 of 149) responded to both AITC and capsaicin and thus coexpressed both TRPA1 and TRPV1 (Fig. 1, D and F). Notably, 49.7% (171 of 344) of CQ-responsive neurons did not coexpress TRPA1 but expressed solely TRPV1, and the remaining 7% (24 of 344) of CQ-sensitive neurons expressed neither TRPV1 nor TRPA1 (Fig. 1, C, F, and H). Consistent with the pharmacological data, the single-cell RT-PCR revealed that MrgprA3 mRNA was expressed in all CQ-responsive neurons (Fig. 1E). Some of them coexpressed TRPA1 and/or TRPV1 mRNA, whereas others coexpressed neither TRPV1 nor TRPA1 mRNA (Fig. 1E). Fig. 1F shows a summary of percentages of the individual populations of CQ-excited neurons described above related to a total of 2693 neurons isolated from neonatal mice. Similar percentages of CQ-excited DRG neurons for these individual populations were also obtained from a total of 1450 neurons isolated from adult mice (Fig. 1G). Hence, the properties of CQ-excited neurons do not change significantly after postnatal development. We also found that a small proportion (14.2%, 49 of 344) of CQ-excited neurons was excited by menthol and thus coexpressed TRPM8 (Fig. 1H). Most of these neurons (76%) also coexpressed TRPV1 and/or TRPA1 (Fig. 1H) and were thus contained within TRPV1+ and TRPA1+ populations. Taken together, CQ excited three main populations of neurons coexpressing either TRPA1 or TRPV1 or neither channel. To examine whether coexpressed TRPA1 or TRPV1 in DRG neurons is a bona fide ion channel responsible for mediating responses caused by CQ, we treated CQ-responsive neurons with the specific TRPA1 blocker HC-030031, the TRPV1 blocker capsazepine, or the general TRP channel blocker ruthenium red. We found that CQ-excited responses were completely blocked by the specific TRPA1 antagonist HC-030031 in all neurons that were also responsive to AITC (Fig. 2, A and F). This experiment shows that TRPA1 is the sole molecule mediating the excitation of this population of DRG neurons evoked by CQ, consistent with the proposed role of TRPA1 in CQ-induced itch (18Wilson S.R. Gerhold K.A. Bifolck-Fisher A. Liu Q. Patel K.N. Dong X. Bautista D.M. TRPA1 is required for histamine-independent, Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor-mediated itch.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). However, HC-030031 had no effect on the responses excited by CQ in neurons that were unresponsive to AITC (Fig. 2, B and F). Because most of this population of neurons coexpressed TRPV1, we then investigated whether TRPV1 might mediate the excitation of this population of neurons by treating neurons with the specific TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine. Fig. 2F shows that capsazepine failed to prevent CQ-induced responses in neurons that were responsive to the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin, suggesting that ion channels other than TRPV1 mediate the excitation of TRPV1+ neurons elicited by CQ. Calcium responses evoked by CQ are not likely to be caused by the release of intracellular calcium store because no calcium responses were observed when similar experiments were performed in a calcium-free solution (Fig. 2C). The CQ-induced calcium responses were prevented, however, by the general TRP channel blocker ruthenium red in all neurons, whether AITC-sensitive or not (Fig. 2, D and F), further supporting the notion that the calcium responses evoked by CQ are caused by extracellular calcium influx through Ca2+-permeable TRP ion channels in the plasma membrane (14Liu Q.

https://openalex.org/W2117191987,"HSV triggers intracellular calcium release to promote viral entry. We hypothesized that Akt signaling induces the calcium responses and contributes to HSV entry. Exposure of human cervical and primary genital tract epithelial, neuronal, or keratinocyte cells to HSV serotype 2 resulted in rapid phosphorylation of Akt. Silencing of Akt with small interfering RNA prevented the calcium responses, blocked viral entry, and inhibited plaque formation by 90% compared to control siRNA. Susceptibility to infection was partially restored if Akt was reintroduced into silenced cells with an Akt-expressing plasmid. HSV-2 variants deleted in glycoproteins B or D failed to induce Akt phosphorylation, and coimmunoprecipitation studies indicated that Akt interacts with glycoprotein B. Cell-surface expression of Akt was rapidly induced in response to HSV exposure. Miltefosine (50 μM), a licensed drug that blocks Akt phosphorylation, inhibited HSV-induced calcium release, viral entry, and plaque formation following infection with acyclovir-sensitive and resistant clinical isolates. Miltefosine blocked amplification of HSV from explanted ganglia to epithelial cells; viral yields were significantly less in miltefosine compared to control-treated cocultures (P<0.01). Together, these findings identify a novel role for Akt in viral entry, link Akt and calcium signaling, and suggest a new target for HSV treatment and suppression."
https://openalex.org/W1998487623,"α-Crystallin is a member of the small heat-shock protein (sHSP) family and consists of two subunits, αA and αB. Both αA- and αB-crystallin act as chaperones and anti-apoptotic proteins. Previous studies have identified the peptide (70)KFVIFLDVKHFSPEDLTVK(88) in αA-crystallin and the peptide (73)DRFSVNLDVKHFSPEELKVK(92) in αB-crystallin as mini-chaperones. In the human lens, lysine 70 (Lys(70)) of αA and Lys(92) of αB (in the mini-chaperone sequences) are acetylated. In this study, we investigated the cellular effects of the unmodified and acetyl mini-chaperones. The αA- and αB-crystallin peptides inhibited stress-induced aggregation of four client proteins, and the αA-acetyl peptide was more effective than the native peptide against three of the client proteins. Both the acetyl and native crystallin peptides inhibited stress-induced apoptosis in two mammalian cell types, and this property was directly related to the inhibition of cytochrome c release from mitochondria and the activity of caspase-3 and -9. In organ-cultured rat lenses, the peptides inhibited calcimycin-induced epithelial cell apoptosis. Intraperitoneal injection of the peptides inhibited cataract development in selenite-treated rats, which was accompanied by inhibition of oxidative stress, protein insolubilization, and caspase activity in the lens. These inhibitory effects were more pronounced for acetyl peptides than native peptides. A scrambled αA-crystallin peptide produced no such effects. The results suggest that the α-crystallin chaperone peptides could be used as therapeutic agents to treat cataracts and diseases in which protein aggregation and apoptosis are contributing factors."

In insects, the vitellogenin receptor (VgR) mediates the uptake of vitellogenin (Vg) from the hemolymph by developing oocytes. The oogenesis mutant scanty vitellin (vit) of Bombyx mori (Bm) lacks vitellin and 30-kDa proteins, but B. mori egg-specific protein and BmVg are normal. The vit eggs are white and smaller compared with the pale yellow eggs of the wild type and are embryonic lethal. This study found that a mutation in the B. mori VgR gene (BmVgR) is responsible for the vit phenotype. We cloned the cDNA sequences encoding WT and vit BmVgR. The functional domains of BmVgR are similar to those of other low-density lipoprotein receptors. When compared with the wild type, a 235-bp genomic sequence in vit BmVgR is substituted for a 7-bp sequence. This mutation has resulted in a 50-amino acid deletion in the third Class B region of the first epidermal growth factor (EGF1) domain. BmVgR is expressed specifically in oocytes, and the transcriptional level is changed dramatically and consistently with maturation of oocytes during the previtellogenic periods. Linkage analysis confirmed that BmVgR is mutated in the vit mutant. The coimmunoprecipitation assay confirmed that mutated BmVgR is able to bind BmVg but that BmVg cannot be dissociated under acidic conditions. The WT phenotype determined by RNA interference was similar to that of the vit phenotype for nutritional deficiency, such as BmVg and 30-kDa proteins. These results showed that BmVgR has an important role in transporting proteins for egg formation and embryonic development in B. mori."
https://openalex.org/W2101894686,"Rac1, a member of the Rho family of GTPases, regulates diverse cellular functions, including cytoskeleton reorganization and cell migration. F-box proteins are major subunits within the Skp1-Cul1-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligases that recognize specific substrates for ubiquitination. The role of F-box proteins in regulating Rac1 stability has not been studied. Mouse lung epithelial (MLE12) cells were used to investigate Rac1 stability and cell migration. Screening of an F-box protein library and in vitro ubiquitination assays identified FBXL19, a relatively new member of the F-box protein family that targets Rac1 for its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Overexpression of FBXL19 decreased both Rac1 active and inactive forms and significantly reduced cellular migration. Protein kinase AKT-mediated phosphorylation of Rac1 at serine71 was essential for FBXL19-mediated Rac1 ubiquitination and depletion. Lysin166 within Rac1 was identified as a polyubiquitination acceptor site. Rac1S71A and Rac1K166R mutant proteins were resistant to FBXL19-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Further, ectopically expressed FBXL19 reduced cell migration in Rac1-overexpressing cells (P<0.01, Rac1 cells vs. FBXL19+Rac1 cells), but not in Rac1 lysine166 mutantoverexpressing cells. FBXL19 diminished formation of the migratory leading edge. Thus, SCFFBXL19 targets Rac1 for its disposal, a process regulated by AKT.

https://openalex.org/W1974000985,"Plasmodium falciparum is the most devastating agent of human malaria. A major contributor to its virulence is a complex lifecycle with multiple parasite forms, each presenting a different repertoire of surface antigens. Importantly, members of the 6-Cys s48/45 family of proteins are found on the surface of P. falciparum in every stage, and several of these antigens have been investigated as vaccine targets. Pf12 is the archetypal member of the 6-Cys protein family, containing just two s48/45 domains, whereas other members have up to 14 of these domains. Pf12 is strongly recognized by immune sera from naturally infected patients. Here we show that Pf12 is highly conserved and under purifying selection. Immunofluorescence data reveals a punctate staining pattern with an apical organization in late schizonts. Together, these data are consistent with an important functional role for Pf12 in parasite-host cell attachment or invasion. To infer the structural and functional diversity between Pf12 and the other 11 6-Cys domain proteins, we solved the 1.90 Å resolution crystal structure of the Pf12 ectodomain. Structural analysis reveals a unique organization between the membrane proximal and membrane distal domains and clear homology with the SRS-domain containing proteins of Toxoplasma gondii. Cross-linking and mass spectrometry confirm the previously identified Pf12-Pf41 heterodimeric complex, and analysis of individual cross-links supports an unexpected antiparallel organization. Collectively, the localization and structure of Pf12 and details of its interaction with Pf41 reveal important insight into the structural and functional properties of this archetypal member of the 6-Cys protein family."

The bacterial nucleoid-associated proteins Hha and H-NS jointly repress horizontally acquired genes in Salmonella, including essential virulence loci encoded within Salmonella pathogenicity islands. Hha is known to interact with the N-terminal dimerization domain of H-NS; however, the manner in which this interaction enhances transcriptional silencing is not understood. To further understand this process, we solved the x-ray crystal structure of Hha in complex with the N-terminal dimerization domain of H-NS (H-NS(1-46)) to 3.2 Å resolution. Two monomers of Hha bind to symmetrical sites on either side of the H-NS(1-46) dimer. Disruption of the Hha/H-NS interaction by the H-NS site-specific mutation I11A results in increased expression of the Hha/H-NS co-regulated gene hilA without affecting the expression levels of proV, a target gene repressed by H-NS in an Hha-independent fashion. Examination of the structure revealed a cluster of conserved basic amino acids that protrude from the surface of Hha on the opposite side of the Hha/H-NS(1-46) interface. Hha mutants with a diminished positively charged surface maintain the ability to interact with H-NS but can no longer regulate hilA. Increased expression of the hilA locus did not correspond to significant depletion of H-NS at the promoter region in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. However, in vitro, we find Hha improves H-NS binding to target DNA fragments. Taken together, our results show for the first time how Hha and H-NS interact to direct transcriptional repression and reveal that a positively charged surface of Hha enhances the silencing activity of H-NS nucleoprotein filaments."
https://openalex.org/W2012632668,"Proteasomal and mitochondrial dysfunctions are implicated in chronic neurodegenerative diseases. To investigate the impact of mitochondrial impairment on the proteasome, we treated rat cerebral cortical neurons with oligomycin, antimycin, or rotenone, which inhibit different elements of the electron transport chain. Firstly, we observed a reduction in ubiquitinated proteins and E1 activity. Secondly, we established that 26S proteasomes are disassembled with a decline in activity. Thirdly, we show, to our knowledge for the first time, that calpain activation triggers the selective processing of the 26S proteasome subunit Rpn10. Other proteasome subunits tested were not affected. Calpain also cleaved caspase 3 to an inactive fragment, thus preventing apoptosis that is an energy-dependent cell death pathway. In addition, calpain cleaved the microtubule-associated protein Tau, a major component of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies. Fourthly, we detected a rise in 20S proteasome levels and activity. Finally, we show that both acute (16 h) and long term (up to 7 days) mitochondrial impairment led to down-regulation of ubiquitinated-proteins, 26S proteasome disassembly, and a rise in 20S proteasomes. We postulate that upon mitochondrial dysfunction, ATP depletion and calpain activation contribute to the demise of protein turnover by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. The concomitant rise in 20S proteasomes, which seem to degrade proteins in an unregulated and energy-independent manner, in the short term may carry out the turnover of randomly unfolded oxidized proteins. However, if chronic, it could lead to neurodegeneration as regulated protein degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway is essential for neuronal survival. Proteasomal and mitochondrial dysfunctions are implicated in chronic neurodegenerative diseases. To investigate the impact of mitochondrial impairment on the proteasome, we treated rat cerebral cortical neurons with oligomycin, antimycin, or rotenone, which inhibit different elements of the electron transport chain. Firstly, we observed a reduction in ubiquitinated proteins and E1 activity. Secondly, we established that 26S proteasomes are disassembled with a decline in activity. Thirdly, we show, to our knowledge for the first time, that calpain activation triggers the selective processing of the 26S proteasome subunit Rpn10. Other proteasome subunits tested were not affected. Calpain also cleaved caspase 3 to an inactive fragment, thus preventing apoptosis that is an energy-dependent cell death pathway. In addition, calpain cleaved the microtubule-associated protein Tau, a major component of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies. Fourthly, we detected a rise in 20S proteasome levels and activity. Finally, we show that both acute (16 h) and long term (up to 7 days) mitochondrial impairment led to down-regulation of ubiquitinated-proteins, 26S proteasome disassembly, and a rise in 20S proteasomes. We postulate that upon mitochondrial dysfunction, ATP depletion and calpain activation contribute to the demise of protein turnover by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. The concomitant rise in 20S proteasomes, which seem to degrade proteins in an unregulated and energy-independent manner, in the short term may carry out the turnover of randomly unfolded oxidized proteins. However, if chronic, it could lead to neurodegeneration as regulated protein degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway is essential for neuronal survival. Proteasome function is essential for neuronal homeostasis and survival. Neurons are also critically dependent on mitochondria for energy production necessary for maintaining homeostasis, neurotransmission, and plasticity. There is a mutual dependence between mitochondrial and proteasomal function (1Livnat-Levanon N. Glickman M.H. Ubiquitin-proteasome system and mitochondria – reciprocity.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1809: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Mitochondria provide ATP required for 26S proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, some of which are mitochondrial proteins. Emerging evidence implicates proteasomal and mitochondrial dysfunction in aging and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease (AD) 3The abbreviations used are: ADAlzheimer disease6-CFDA6-carboxyfluorescein diacetateH2DCFDA5-(and-6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetateDMSOdimethyl sulfoxideMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromidePIpropidium iodideROSreactive oxygen speciesRpnregulatory particle non-ATPaseRptregulatory particle triple-A ATPaseSuc-LLVY-AMCsuccinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amino-4-methylcoumarinTMREtetramethylrhodamine ethyl esterUb proteinubiquitinated proteinUPPubiquitin/proteasome pathwayCp3calpain inhibitor IIIZbenzyloxycarbonylNlenorleucine.

Neurosci. 2012; 13: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In neurons, this is particularly important because, on the one hand, neurons have a limited glycolytic capacity (4Reddy P.H. Mitochondrial dysfunction in aging and Alzheimer's disease: strategies to protect neurons.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2007; 9: 1647-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and thus are particularly sensitive to the aging-associated decline in mitochondrial bioenergetics (5Beal M.F. Mitochondria take center stage in aging and neurodegeneration.Ann. Neurol. 2005; 58: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). On the other hand, intraneuronal accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, indicative of proteasome malfunction, is a hallmark of most chronic neurodegenerative diseases including AD (6Bedford L. Paine S. Rezvani N. Mee M. Lowe J. Mayer R.J. The UPS and autophagy in chronic neurodegenerative disease: six of one and half a dozen of the other–or not?.Autophagy. 2009; 5: 224-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Notably, the impact of mitochondrial impairment on proteasome function remains poorly defined.

One of the principal mechanisms by which mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to aging and neurodegeneration is via the limitation in ATP production that can cause an energy crisis in neurons (7Nicholls D.G. Oxidative stress and energy crises in neuronal dysfunction.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2008; 1147: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Brain glucose hypometabolism is detected early in AD patients and is implicated in the initiation and progression of AD pathology (8Mosconi L. Pupi A. De Leon M.J. Brain glucose hypometabolism and oxidative stress in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2008; 1147: 180-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). ATP loss in AD brains was estimated to reach as much as 50% in stable advanced dementia (9Hoyer S. Oxidative energy metabolism in Alzheimer brain. Studies in early-onset and late-onset cases.Mol. Chem. Neuropathol. 1992; 16: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This energy deficit may have a drastic impact on brain function. Degradation of proteins by the 26S proteasome is highly dependent on ATP binding and hydrolysis (10Liu C.W. Li X. Thompson D. Wooding K. Chang T.L. Tang Z. Yu H. Thomas P.J. DeMartino G.N. ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis play distinct roles in the function of 26S proteasome.Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Another deleterious mechanism associated with mitochondrial dysfunction is a net increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (11Zhu X. Perry G. Smith M.A. Wang X. Abnormal mitochondrial dynamics in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.J. Alzheimers Dis. 2013; 33: S253-S262PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) alters the structure of cellular proteins (12Stadtman E.R. Berlett B.S. Reactive oxygen-mediated protein oxidation in aging and disease.Drug Metab. Rev. 1998; 30: 225-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), which, if not repaired, must be removed by proteolysis to prevent their accumulation and aggregation. One of the major roles of the proteasome is to degrade oxidatively modified proteins, but whether ubiquitination is required remains elusive (13Shang F. Taylor A. Ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and cellular responses to oxidative stress.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2011; 51: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Some studies support the notion that oxidatively modified proteins in cells are removed by the 20S proteasome independently of ubiquitination (14Shringarpure R. Grune T. Mehlhase J. Davies K.J. Ubiquitin conjugation is not required for the degradation of oxidized proteins by proteasome.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 311-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Others demonstrate that upon oxidative stress, there is an increase in the levels of ubiquitinated proteins and in ubiquitin-activating and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme activities, suggesting that the ubiquitination machinery is recruited to degrade oxidatively modified proteins (15Shang F. Nowell Jr., T.R. Taylor A. Removal of oxidatively damaged proteins from lens cells by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 73: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This is an important issue because there is ample evidence that neural tissue is especially vulnerable to oxidative stress, which plays an important role in many neurodegenerative disorders (16Lin M.T. Beal M.F. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases.Nature. 2006; 443: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (4622) Google Scholar). Neurons exhibit a higher sensitivity to proteasome inhibition than astrocytes, mostly because they undergo increased levels of oxidized proteins (17Dasuri K. Ebenezer P.J. Zhang L. Fernandez-Kim S.O. Uranga R.M. Gavilán E. Di Blasio A. Keller J.N. Selective vulnerability of neurons to acute toxicity after proteasome inhibitor treatment: implications for oxidative stress and insolubility of newly synthesized proteins.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2010; 49: 1290-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Impaired clearance of oxidatively modified proteins can cause their aggregation and directly promote progression of the neurodegenerative process (18Grune T. Jung T. Merker K. Davies K.J. Decreased proteolysis caused by protein aggregates, inclusion bodies, plaques, lipofuscin, ceroid, and ‘aggresomes’ during oxidative stress, aging, and disease.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2519-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Both deleterious consequences of mitochondrial impairment, i.e. restricted ATP-generating capacity and ROS production, are likely to contribute to impaired proteasome-dependent proteolysis in neurons (10Liu C.W. Li X. Thompson D. Wooding K. Chang T.L. Tang Z. Yu H. Thomas P.J. DeMartino G.N. ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis play distinct roles in the function of 26S proteasome.Mol.

Protein oxidative modifications in the ageing brain: consequence for the onset of neurodegenerative disease.Free Radic. Res. 2011; 45: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It is postulated that in neurons, even a modest restriction of ATP production by mitochondria far outweighs the negligible effects of ROS, although the underlying mechanisms are not clearly understood (7Nicholls D.G. Oxidative stress and energy crises in neuronal dysfunction.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2008; 1147: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In our current study with neurons, we demonstrate that low ATP levels caused by mitochondrial dysfunction correlate with impairment of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway (UPP); there is a decline in E1 and 26S proteasome activities, both of which are energy-dependent, with a concomitant rise in 20S proteasomes. This decline in UPP function occurs upon acute and long term mitochondrial impairment. Notably, upon energy depletion, calpain activation leads to the selective cleavage of Rpn10, a 26S proteasome subunit. Other proteasome subunits tested were not affected. Rpn10 cleavage, combined with ATP depletion, contributes to the demise of 26S proteasome function, a critical step in the UPP. We postulate that under acute mitochondrial stress conditions, unregulated and energy-independent protein degradation via 20S proteasomes could carry out the degradation of randomly unfolded oxidized proteins. However, regulated and ATP-dependent protein degradation via the UPP is essential for long term neuronal survival. The following inhibitors were used: oligomycin A, antimycin A, rotenone, and chloroquine (Sigma-Aldrich); epoxomicin (Peptides International Inc.); calpain inhibitor III and calpeptin (Calbiochem/EMD Bioscience). The following substrate was used: Suc-LLVY-AMC (Bachem Bioscience Inc.). The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-ubiquitinated proteins (1:1500, catalog number Z0458, Dako North America); rabbit polyclonal anti-β5 (1:5000, catalog number PW8895), mouse monoclonal anti-Rpt6 (1:2000, catalog number PW9265), anti-Rpn10 (1:2000, catalog number PW9250), anti-α5 (1:2000, catalog number PW8125), anti-Rpn2 (1:2000, catalog number PW9270), and anti-Rpt5 (1:2000, catalog number PW8770), all from ENZO Life Sciences, Inc.; mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin (1:10,000, catalog number A-2228, Sigma); rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase 3 (1:1000, catalog number 9662), anti-UBE1a (1:1000, catalog number 4890), and anti-E2-25K/Hip2 (1:1000, catalog number 3847), all from Cell Signaling Technology; mouse monoclonal anti-spectrin α chain (1:5000, clone AA6, catalog number MAB1622, Millipore); mouse monoclonal anti-βIII-tubulin (1:10,000, catalog number MMS-435P, Covance); and mouse monoclonal Tau C5 (1:50,000; detects all Tau isoforms; epitope, residues 210–241), courtesy of Dr. L. Binder (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). Secondary antibodies with HRP conjugate (1:10,000) were from Bio-Rad Laboratories. Dissociated cultures from Sprague-Dawley rat embryonic (embryonic day 18, both sexes) cerebral cortical neurons were prepared as follows. The isolated cortices free of meninges were digested with papain (0.5 mg/ml from Worthington Biochemical) in Hibernate E without calcium (BrainBits LLC) at 37 °C for 30 min in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. After removal of the enzymatic solution, the tissues were gently dissociated in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen). Dissociated tissues were centrifuged at 300 × g for 2 min. The pellet was resuspended in Neurobasal medium without antibiotics and plated on 10-cm dishes precoated with 50 μg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma). Cells were plated at a density of 6 × 106 cells/10-cm dish, or 2.5 × 105 cells/well on 24-well plates (cell viability only). Cultures were maintained in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27 and 0.5 mm l-GlutaMAX (all from Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Half of the medium was changed every 4 days. Experiments were run upon 8–11 days in vitro. According to the manufacturer's specifications, Neurobasal medium contains several proprietary factors that ensure a mostly pure (>95%) neuronal culture; glial growth is inhibited without a need for the anti-mitotic agent arabinofuranosyl cytidine (21Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. Optimized survival of hippocampal neurons in B27-supplemented Neurobasal, a new serum-free medium combination.J. Neurosci.

Ed. 2007; 18: 1091-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cortical neurons were treated acutely (1.5, 2, 4, 8, or 16 h) with DMSO or with the different drugs in DMSO added directly to DMEM without serum, supplemented with 0.5 mm l-GlutaMAX and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (all from Invitrogen). The final DMSO concentration in the medium was 0.5%. For long term (1 day to 7 days) studies, neurons were maintained for the entire time in DMEM with 2% B27 supplemented with 0.5 mm l-GlutaMAX and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Drugs were added once at the beginning of each experiment, following the same protocol as for the acute studies. Steady state ATP content was measured with a kit using the sensitive luciferin/luciferase system (Molecular Probes). This assay is based on luciferase requiring ATP for light production using luciferin as a substrate. Cells were harvested with 4% trichloroacetic acid followed by centrifugation (19,000 × g, 15 min at 4 °C). ATP steady state levels were determined in cleared supernatants upon neutralizing the samples with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Samples were then added to the reaction buffer containing luciferin and assayed using a Luminoskan Ascent microplate luminometer (Thermo Electron). Protein concentration was determined with the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) kit (Pierce) upon resuspending the pellet with buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 1% SDS), and sonication. ATP levels were normalized for protein concentration. Upon treatment with the drugs, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was assessed with TMRE (Abcam Inc.), and ROS was assessed with H2DCFDA (Invitrogen). At the designated time points, treatment medium (DMEM) with the drugs was removed, and fresh DMEM without drugs but with TMRE (200 nm) or H2DCFDA (20 μm) was added to separate cultures. Following a 30-min dye-loading incubation that included Hoechst 33342 (2′-[4-ethoxyphenyl]-5-[4-methyl-1-piperazinyl]-2,5′-bi-1H-benzimidazole trihydrochloride trihydrate) for nuclear staining for the last 5 min, the cultures were changed to fresh dye-free DMEM. The dyes were allowed to re-equilibrate in the fresh dye-free medium, and then TMRE and H2DCFDA fluorescence was imaged on a Nikon Eclipse TE 200 inverted epifluorescence microscope. The following excitation/emission wavelengths were used: for TMRE (red), 549/575 nm; for ROS (green), 495/529 nm; and for Hoechst 33342 (blue), 350/461 nm. For each condition, total fluorescence from cells was semiquantified in each image field using ImageJ, typically for 10–15 images per group pooled over two independent experiments for each group, and normalized to time-matched DMSO (vehicle) control = 1. Images with effectively no signal were excluded from analysis (using ImageJ from the National Institutes of Health). Cell viability was assessed with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as described in Ref. 23Mosmann T. Rapid colorimetric assay for cellular growth and survival: application to proliferation and cytotoxicity assays.J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46401) Google Scholar. In addition, propidium iodide cell staining (Invitrogen) and 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (6-CFDA) (Sigma) cell staining were carried out following the respective manufacturer's specifications. After treatment, cells were rinsed twice with PBS and harvested by gently scraping into hot (100 °C) SDS buffer (0.01 m Tris-EDTA, pH 7.5, and 1% SDS) to make sure all intracellular proteins were included. Samples were subjected to a 5-min boil at 100 °C followed by brief sonication. After determination of the protein concentration with the BCA kit, the following was added to each sample (final concentrations): β-mercaptoethanol (4%), bromphenol blue (0.005%), and glycerol (4%). Following SDS-PAGE on 6, 8, 10, or 12% polyacrylamide gels, proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membranes were probed with the respective antibodies, and antigens were visualized by a standard chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase method with the ECL reagent. Semiquantification of protein detection was done by image analysis with ImageJ. Upon treatment with vehicle (control, DMSO) or with the respective drugs, cortical neurons were washed twice with PBS, harvested with a thiol-stabilizing buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 8.7 m urea, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 3 mm EDTA, 2% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)), and kept on ice for 15 min for lysing, as described in Ref. 24Jha N.

Samples were sonicated for 10 s, centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, mixed (30 μg) at 1:2 volume with thiol ester gel buffer (33 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.7 m urea, 2.5% SDS, and 13% glycerol), and boiled for 5 min. After determination of the protein concentration with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories), the normalized samples were separated into reducing (with 4% β-mercaptoethanol) and nonreducing (no β-mercaptoethanol) aliquots for SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with anti-E1 and anti-E2 antibodies, as described above. Upon treatment with vehicle (control, DMSO) or the respective drugs, cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested for the in-gel assay as described in Ref. 25Myeku N. Metcalfe M.J. Huang Q.

The in-gel proteasome activity was detected by incubating the native gel on a rocker for 10 min at 37 °C with 15 ml of 300 μm Suc-LLVY-AMC followed by exposure to UV light (360 nm). Gels were photographed with a NIKON COOLPIX 8700 camera with a 3-4219 fluorescent green filter (Peca Products, Inc.). Proteins on the native gels were transferred (110 mA) for 2 h onto PVDF membranes. Immunoblotting was carried out for detection of the 20S and 26S proteasomes with the anti-Rpt6 and anti-β5 antibodies, which react with subunits of the 19S or the 20S particles, respectively, thus detecting 26S and 20S fully assembled proteasomes. Antigens were visualized by a chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase method with the ECL reagent. The values in the tables shown in FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4 reflect the semiquantification obtained with the Rpt6 antibody for 26S proteasome levels (single and double capped) as it generated the strongest signal and with the β5 antibody for 20S proteasome levels.FIGURE 3Effects of oligomycin, antimycin (Antimyc.), and rotenone on Ub proteins, monoubiquitin (MonoUb), and E1- and E2-ubiquitin thiol esters in rat cerebral cortical neurons.

Following homogenization and sonication, the lysates were centrifuged (19,000 × g for 15 min) at 4 °C. The cleared supernatants (1 mg of protein/sample) were subjected to centrifugation (83,000 × g for 24 h) at 4 °C in a Beckman SW41 rotor in a 10–40% glycerol gradient (fractions 1–24) made in the same lysis buffer. Following centrifugation, 24 fractions (500 μl each) were collected.

Proteins were precipitated with acetone from 450 μl of each fraction and subjected to Western blot analysis (10% gels). The membranes were probed with the respective antibodies, and antigens were visualized by a standard chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase method with the ECL reagent. Statistical significance was estimated using one-way analysis of variance (Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test) or Student's t test with Welch's correction (Fig. 2 only) with the Prism 5 program (GraphPad Software). To investigate the link between mitochondrial impairment and loss of neuronal viability, rat cerebral cortical neurons were treated with three mitochondrial inhibitors that affect different elements of the electron transport chain. 1) Rotenone binds to ND1 and inhibits NADH-ubiquinone reductase activity of complex I (27Degli Esposti M. Inhibitors of NADH-ubiquinone reductase: an overview.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar); 2) antimycin A binds to the quinone reduction site of complex III (ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase), inhibiting the reduction of cytochrome c (28Huang L.S. Cobessi D. Tung E.Y. Berry E.A. Binding of the respiratory chain inhibitor antimycin to the mitochondrial bc1 complex: a new crystal structure reveals an altered intramolecular hydrogen-bonding pattern.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 573-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar); and 3) oligomycin binds to a polypeptide in the F0 baseplate and blocks ATP synthesis by the F0/F1 mitochondrial ATP synthase (29Liu Y. Schubert D.R. The specificity of neuroprotection by antioxidants.J. Biomed. Sci. 2009; 16: 98Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, all three drugs decrease ATP levels in a concentration-dependent manner. Oligomycin was the most efficient, as 5 nm of this drug lowered ATP levels by ∼75%. The 25% ATP that remains upon oligomycin treatment must be generated in a mitochondria-independent manner by glycolysis. The decline in ATP levels induced a loss of neuronal viability (Fig. 1B) assessed with the MTT assay, which is reduced largely within the cytoplasm of most cells (30Berridge M.V. Tan A.S. Characterization of the cellular reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT): subcellular localization, substrate dependence, and involvement of mitochondrial electron transport in MTT reduction.Arch.

From the three drugs tested, rotenone caused the weakest changes in all assays, except for ROS. Oligomycin (5 nm), antimycin (5 nm), and rotenone (10 nm) all decreased TMRE signal after 1.5- or 4-h treatment, as did the protonophore carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (100 nm) (Fig. 2A). This decline in TMRE signal is likely to reflect a decrease in ΔΨm. By inhibiting complex I and III, respectively, and thus reducing proton efflux from the mitochondria, rotenone and antimycin are classically associated with decreased ΔΨm, as supported by the decline in TMRE signal. Under nonglycolytic conditions, acute oligomycin treatment is typically associated with increased ΔΨm due to the oligomycin-induced blockade of proton influx through the ATP synthase. Oligomycin will decrease ΔΨm when ΔΨm is being maintained by reversal of the ATP synthase by hydrolyzing glycolysis-derived ATP (32Rego A.C. Vesce S. Nicholls D.G.

https://openalex.org/W2018754439,"Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte invasion is dependent on high affinity recognition of sialic acid on cell surface receptors. The erythrocyte binding-like (EBL) family of invasion ligands mediates recognition of sialic acid on erythrocyte glycoproteins. Erythrocyte-binding antigen-140 (PfEBA-140/BAEBL) is a critical EBL ligand that binds sialic acid on its receptor glycophorin C. We present here the crystal structure of the two-domain receptor-binding region of PfEBA-140 in complex with a glycan containing sialic acid. The structure identifies two glycan-binding pockets unique to PfEBA-140 and not shared by other EBL ligands. Specific molecular interactions that enable receptor engagement are identified and reveal that the glycan binding mode is distinct from that of apicomplexan and viral cell surface recognition ligands as well as host immune factors that bind sialic acid. Erythrocyte binding experiments elucidated essential glycan contact residues and identified divergent functional roles for each receptor-binding site. One of four polymorphisms proposed to affect receptor binding was localized to a glycan-binding site, providing a structural basis for altered erythrocyte engagement. The studies described here provide the first full description of sialic acid-dependent molecular interactions at the P. falciparum erythrocyte invasion interface and define a framework for development of PfEBA-140-based therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics assessing vaccine efficacy and natural immunity to infection. Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte invasion is dependent on high affinity recognition of sialic acid on cell surface receptors. The erythrocyte binding-like (EBL) family of invasion ligands mediates recognition of sialic acid on erythrocyte glycoproteins. Erythrocyte-binding antigen-140 (PfEBA-140/BAEBL) is a critical EBL ligand that binds sialic acid on its receptor glycophorin C. We present here the crystal structure of the two-domain receptor-binding region of PfEBA-140 in complex with a glycan containing sialic acid. The structure identifies two glycan-binding pockets unique to PfEBA-140 and not shared by other EBL ligands.

In P. falciparum, the EBL family is composed of four known functional membrane-embedded ligands that each target a specific erythrocyte receptor in a sialic acid-dependent manner (3Adams J.H.

Receptor engagement by the merozoite allows the formation of an irreversible tight junction with the host membrane and subsequent formation of the parasitophorous vacuole (4Dvorak J.A. Miller L.H.

These two domains comprise the minimal binding region of the P. falciparum EBL ligands and have been designated region II (RII). P. falciparum erythrocyte-binding antigen 140 (PfEBA-140/BAEBL) is a member of the EBL family that binds erythrocytes via its cell surface receptor glycophorin C (GPC) (9Lobo C.A. Rodriguez M.

Studies examining the erythrocyte binding capability of the individual RII PfEBA-140 DBL domains (F1 and F2) demonstrated that neither domain is sufficient to engage erythrocytes (10Lin D.H.

In addition, single amino acid mutations in either DBL domain severely disrupt erythrocyte binding, demonstrating an essential role for both DBL domains during invasion (10Lin D.H. Malpede B.M.

Receptor recognition by P. falciparum invasion ligands is also characterized by the sensitivity of the binding interaction to specific enzyme treatments of red blood cells (12Mayer D.C. Kaneko O. Hudson-Taylor D.E. Reid M.E. Miller L.H. Characterization of a Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte-binding protein paralogous to EBA-175.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Hyg. 1977; 26: 204-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies examining the binding profile of PfEBA-140 to enzyme-treated erythrocytes have provided a basic understanding of how this ligand engages its receptor. PfEBA-140 receptor binding is trypsin- and neuraminidase-sensitive, but chymotrypsin-resistant (12Mayer D.C. Kaneko O. Hudson-Taylor D.E. Reid M.E. Miller L.H.

In addition, soluble sialic acid is not capable of inhibiting PfEBA-140 erythrocyte binding (12Mayer D.C. Kaneko O. Hudson-Taylor D.E. Reid M.E. Miller L.H.

These results demonstrated that receptor glycans containing sialic acid are essential for receptor recognition and that the protein backbone of GPC also plays a role in binding (12Mayer D.C.

GPC possesses several putative O-linked glycans and one known N-linked glycan, all containing the sialic acid sugar moiety required for PfEBA-140 binding. The solitary N-linked glycan is essential for GPC engagement, but the role of individual O-linked glycans is not clear (16Mayer D.C. Jiang L. Achur R.N. Kakizaki I. Gowda D.C. Miller L.H. The glycophorin C N-linked glycan is a critical component of the ligand for the Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte receptor BAEBL.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Numerous and widespread polymorphisms have been identified in Plasmodium invasion ligands, specifically PfEBA-175 and Plasmodium vivax Duffy-binding protein (PvDBP) (17Gosi P. Khusmith S.

Evidence for diversifying selection on erythrocyte-binding antigens of Plasmodium falciparumP. vivax.Genetics. 2003; 163: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, only four polymorphic mutants have been identified in RII PfEBA-140, all of which are present in the F1 domain: I185V, N239S, K261R/K261T, and K285E (11Mayer D.C. Mu J.B. Feng X. Su X.Z.

Polymorphic residue changes in PfEBA-140 modify the binding profile of this ligand to enzyme-treated erythrocytes. The altered binding profile suggests that PfEBA-140 is capable of interacting with other erythrocyte cell surface molecules and may mediate an invasion process independent of GPC (11Mayer D.C. Mu J.B. Feng X. Su X.Z. Miller L.H. Polymorphism in a Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte-binding ligand changes its receptor specificity.J. Exp.

A novel ligand from Plasmodium falciparum that binds to a sialic acid-containing receptor on the surface of human erythrocytes.Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition to altering the binding profile, it has been shown that polymorphisms reduce the affinity of PfEBA-140 for erythrocytes (21Maier A.G. Baum J. Smith B. Conway D.J. Cowman A.F. Polymorphisms in erythrocyte binding antigens 140 and 181 affect function and binding but not receptor specificity in Plasmodium falciparum.Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 1689-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that binding to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on the erythrocyte surface promotes merozoite invasion (22Boyle M.J. Richards J.S. Gilson P.R. Chai W. Beeson J.G. Interactions with heparin-like molecules during erythrocyte invasion by Plasmodium falciparum merozoites.Blood. 2010; 115: 4559-4568Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). PfEBA-140 is capable of binding heparin, and it has been proposed that cell surface GAGs may function as a secondary interaction element during PfEBA-140-mediated invasion (23Kobayashi K. Kato K. Sugi T. Takemae H. Pandey K. Gong H. Tohya Y. Akashi H. Plasmodium falciparum BAEBL binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the human erythrocyte surface.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 1716-1725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The role of individual EBL invasion ligands during in vivo erythrocyte invasion and blood stage growth is not fully understood. However, several studies have demonstrated the importance of PfEBA-140 during natural infection as both an invasion ligand and an antigen. Individuals in malaria endemic regions mount a strong antibody response to PfEBA-140, and RII was the most immunoreactive element (24Ford L. Lobo C.A. Rodriguez M. Zalis M.G. Machado R.L. Rossit A.R. Cavasini C.E. Couto A.A. Enyong P.A. Lustigman S.

Hyg. 2007; 77: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This result provides evidence of PfEBA-140 expression and immune recognition in natural infections and supports the significance of this ligand as a member of a combinatorial vaccine. In addition to natural immunogenicity, antibodies targeting RII PfEBA-140 are capable of inhibiting invasion, which is strongly supportive of the functional role and antigenic properties of PfEBA-140 (25Lopaticki S. Maier A.G. Thompson J. Wilson D.W. Tham W.H. Triglia T. Gout A. Speed T.P. Beeson J.G. Healer J. Cowman A.F. Reticulocyte and erythrocyte binding-like proteins function cooperatively in invasion of human erythrocytes by malaria parasites.Infect.

Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte invasion through glycophorin C and selection for Gerbich negativity in human populations.Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Gerbich negativity is observed at high frequencies in regions of endemic malaria in Papua New Guinea (26Maier A.G. Duraisingh M.T. Reeder J.C. Patel S.S. Kazura J.W. Zimmerman P.A. Cowman A.F. Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte invasion through glycophorin C and selection for Gerbich negativity in human populations.Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This phenotype results from the loss of exon 3 within the GPC gene. The absence of this portion of GPC prevents PfEBA-140 from engaging erythrocytes and thus inhibits the invasion process. The prevalence of Gerbich negativity provides evidence that severe malaria has selected for this mutation and supports the importance of PfEBA-140 during natural infection (26Maier A.G. Duraisingh M.T. Reeder J.C. Patel S.S. Kazura J.W. Zimmerman P.A. Cowman A.F. Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte invasion through glycophorin C and selection for Gerbich negativity in human populations.Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). To identify receptor-binding sites in PfEBA-140 and define molecular interactions at the merozoite-erythrocyte invasion interface, we solved the crystal structure of RII PfEBA-140 in complex with a glycan containing sialic acid, the essential sugar component of GPC that is recognized during erythrocyte engagement. Two glycan-binding pockets are identified, one in each DBL domain. Mutation of individual sialic acid contact residues disrupts erythrocyte binding by RII PfEBA-140, confirming the functional role of the sugar-binding pockets. Stark differences in the mutant erythrocyte binding phenotypes for the F1 and F2 domains suggest that each DBL domain performs a distinct function during erythrocyte engagement. One of the four polymorphic residues that affect PfEBA-140 receptor binding is found in the base of the F1 glycan-binding pocket. The localization of this residue provides insight into the structural basis of altered receptor binding observed for polymorphic variants. The structure also allowed for mapping of putative sulfate and GAG-binding sites, which may represent true interaction elements that promote red blood cell binding and invasion. This study provides the first complete molecular and structural description of sialic acid-dependent interactions critical to the formation of the tight junction at the merozoite-erythrocyte invasion interface. Our results will thus aid in the design of novel therapeutics and diagnostics targeting this essential step in the life cycle of the parasite. RII PfEBA-140 was expressed and purified as described previously (10Lin D.H. Malpede B.M. Batchelor J.D. Tolia N.H.

Chem. 2012; 287: 36830-36836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, RII PfEBA-140 was expressed in Escherichia coli and recovered from inclusion bodies using 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride. After overnight denaturing, 100 mg/liter of denatured protein was rapidly diluted in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 10 mm EDTA, 200 mm arginine, 0.1 mm PMSF, 2 mm reduced glutathione, and 0.2 mm oxidized glutathione. The protein was refolded for 48 h at 4 °C. After refolding, RII PfEBA-140 was purified by ion-exchange and size exclusion chromatography and concentrated using Amicon centrifugal filters for crystallization. Crystals of RII PfEBA-140 were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The drops were produced by mixing 1 μl of protein at 7.5 mg/ml with 1 μl of reservoir containing 20% PEG 8000 and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5. Crystals of RII PfEBA-140 alone were soaked with 10 mm sialyllactose for 30 min to obtain the complex. Crystals were sent for remote data collection in cryoprotectant composed of 30% glycerol, 17.5% PEG 8000, and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5. The cryoprotectant was introduced gradually into the drop by pipetting, and crystals were isolated with nylon loops and stream-frozen prior to transport. Data were collected at beamline 19-ID at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, and processed with XDS (27Kabsch W. XDS. Acta. Crystallogr. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab RII PfEBA-140 was fused to a C-terminal GFP in plasmid pRE4 for surface expression on HEK-293T cells. Individual alanine point mutants were produced using the QuikChange method and verified by plasmid sequencing. Monolayers of HEK-293T cells grown in 3.5-cm wells were transfected with 2.7 μg of plasmid DNA in polyethyleneimine. Erythrocyte binding of individual constructs was assayed 20 h after transfection. To assess the binding phenotypes of RII PfEBA-140 mutant constructs, transfected HEK-293 cells were incubated with normal human erythrocytes. For enzyme treatment experiments, normal erythrocytes at 50% hematocrit were treated with 0.1 mg/ml trypsin, 0.1 mg/ml chymotrypsin, or 5 milliunits of Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase at 37 °C for 2 h and washed prior to use. Erythrocytes at 2% hematocrit were then overlaid onto the transfected HEK-293 cells for 2 h. Following incubation with untreated or enzyme-treated erythrocytes, the transfected HEK-293 cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove unbound erythrocytes. For the mutation studies, three individual wells of HEK-293 cells were transfected with each mutant construct. The binding percentage was calculated as the number of rosette-positive cells over the number of GFP-positive cells and was normalized to wild type binding. Binding phenotypes were quantified over 10 fields of view from each of the three wells of transfected cells (a total of 30 images for each construct). Images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 META laser scanning microscope with an LD Achroplan 20× Korr differential interference contrast objective. Images were randomized prior to counting with ImageJ. To identify receptor-binding pockets, we solved the crystal structure of RII PfEBA-140 in complex with α-2,3-sialyllactose (data collection and refinement statistics are presented in Table 1). The glycan, α-2,3-sialyllactose, is a trisaccharide composed of sialic acid, galactose, and glucose and thus contains the critical sugar groups present on GPC that are required for binding (Neu5Ac(α-2,3)-Gal). RII PfEBA-140 bound to sialyllactose is present as a monomer in the asymmetric unit, consistent with the solution and crystal structures of unbound RII PfEBA-140 (10Lin D.H. Malpede B.M. Batchelor J.D. Tolia N.H. Crystal and solution structures of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte-binding antigen 140 reveal determinants of receptor specificity during erythrocyte invasion.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 36830-36836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Clear density was observed for the sialic acid of two sialyllactose molecules in the co-crystal structure, with one molecule contacting each DBL domain. The sialic acid moieties were modeled into the two binding sites (Fig. 1, A–D). Average B-factors for the sialic acids in both pockets were comparable (64.42 and 64.04 Å2), suggesting similar occupancy and affinity. Additional density was observed for the galactose of each sialyllactose molecule, but due to inherent flexibility, galactose could not be adequately modeled. The galactose density extends out of both pockets and away from the contact surface (Fig. 1, B and C), supporting the importance of contacts between sialic acid and PfEBA-140. The two binding sites are present within a region spanning both DBL domains that contains a concentration of positively charged residues previously identified as a putative receptor-binding region (Fig. 1D) (10Lin D.H. Malpede B.M. Batchelor J.D. Tolia N.H. Crystal and solution structures of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte-binding antigen 140 reveal determinants of receptor specificity during erythrocyte invasion.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 36830-36836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The glycan-binding sites are in a structurally similar position on the F1 and F2 domains, with the sialic acid inserting into a valley at the interface of a helix and an extended loop (Fig. 1, E and F). The sialic acid moiety contains a pyranose ring with single carboxyl, glycerol, and acetamido functional groups. The pyranose ring and functional groups of the bound sialic acid insert into the F1-binding pocket, and several contact residues form a cup-like interaction with the glycan (Fig. 2A). In the base of the pocket, Gln-182 hydrogen-bonds and forms van der Waal interactions with the sialic acid carboxyl. Contacts with the sialic acid glycerol chain are mediated by Arg-158, which forms a hydrogen bond and is involved in van der Waals contacts with hydroxyl groups. On the opposite face of the binding pocket, the sialic acid acetamido group is oriented toward a helix containing Asn-251. This helix places Asn-251 in proper orientation to hydrogen-bond with the 4-hydroxyl of the pyranose ring. In addition to the aforementioned contact surfaces, Ile-181 and Ile-185 form the base of the pocket and interact with hydrophobic regions of the sugar. The F2-binding site contains a glycan contact surface that is similar to that observed in the F1 domain (Fig. 1F). However, the pocket residues are altered such that the observed glycan contacts are distinct (Fig. 2B). Asn-457 forms contacts not observed in the F1 pocket as a result of its location on a loop at the top of the binding site. This orientation allows Asn-457 to form van der Waal interactions with the glycan carboxyl. Interactions with the sialic acid glycerol chain are mediated by Lys-464, which hydrogen-bonds with a hydroxyl group and engages in van der Waal contacts with the sugar. Thr-487 is present in the base of the pocket and contacts hydrophobic regions of the glycan. A helix containing Tyr-556, analogous to the helix carrying Asn-251 in the F1 pocket, extends the side chain of Tyr-556 toward the glycan to engage in hydrophobic contacts with the sialic acid acetamido group. To examine the receptor specificity of the RII PfEBA-140 construct used for crystallization, we assessed the binding phenotype with enzyme-treated erythrocytes. The rosetting interaction is sensitive to neuraminidase and trypsin treatment, but resistant to chymotrypsin, consistent with previously observed results for RII PfEBA-140 (Fig. 2C) (12Mayer D.C.

To investigate how iron regulates glucose homeostasis, we fed C57BL/6J male mice with high-iron (HI) diets (2 or 20 g Fe/kg chow). Mice fed an HI diet exhibited elevated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity and impaired insulin signaling in skeletal muscle and liver. Consistent with the increased AMPK activity, glucose uptake was enhanced in mice fed an HI diet. The effects of improved glucose tolerance induced by HI feeding were abolished in transgenic mice with expression of muscle specific dominant-negative AMPK. Glucose output was suppressed in the liver of wild-type mice fed an HI diet, due to decreased expression of gluconeogenic genes and decreased substrate (lactate) from peripheral glycolysis. Iron activated AMPK by increasing deacetylase and decreasing LKB1 acetylation, in turn stimulating the phosphorylation of LKB1 and AMPK. The effects of HI diet were abrogated by treatment of the mice with N-acetyl cysteine, suggesting a redox-dependent mechanism for increasing deacetylase activity. In addition, tissue from iron-fed mice exhibited an elevated AMP/ATP ratio, further contributing to AMPK activation. In summary, a diet high in iron improves glucose tolerance by activating AMPK through mechanisms that include deacetylation.— Huang J., Simcox, J., Mitchell, T.

https://openalex.org/W2102760911,"Coeliacs require a life-long gluten-free diet supported by accurate measurement of gluten (hordein) in gluten-free food. The gluten-free food industry, with a value in excess of $6 billion in 2011, currently depends on two ELISA protocols calibrated against standards that may not be representative of the sample being assayed.The factors affecting the accuracy of ELISA analysis of hordeins in beer were examined.A simple alcohol-dithiothreitol extraction protocol successfully extracts the majority of hordeins from barley flour and malt. Primary hordein standards were purified by FPLC. ELISA detected different classes of purified hordeins with vastly different sensitivity. The dissociation constant (Kd) for a given ELISA reaction with different hordeins varied by three orders of magnitude. The Kd of the same hordein determined by ELISA using different antibodies varied by up to two orders of magnitude. The choice of either ELISA kit or hordein standard may bias the results and confound interpretation.Accurate determination of hordein requires that the hordein standard used to calibrate the ELISA reaction be identical in composition to the hordeins present in the test substance. In practice it is not feasible to isolate a representative hordein standard from each test food. We suggest that mass spectrometry is more reliable than ELISA, as ELISA enumerates only the concentration of particular amino-acid epitopes which may vary between different hordeins and may not be related to the absolute hordein concentration. MS quantification is undertaken using peptides that are specific and unique enabling the quantification of individual hordein isoforms."

It remains largely unexplored how this process is regulated by post-translational modifications. Several reprogramming factors possess conserved sumoylation sites, so we investigated whether and how this modification regulates reprogramming of fibroblasts into iPS cells. Substitution of the sole sumoylation site of the Krüppel-like factor (KLF4), a well known reprogramming factor, promoted iPS cell formation. In comparison, much smaller effects on reprogramming were observed for sumoylation-deficient mutants of SOX2 and OCT4, two other classical reprogramming factors. We also analyzed KLF2, a KLF4 homolog and a member of the KLF family of transcription factors with a known role in reprogramming. KLF2 was sumoylated at two conserved neighboring motifs, but substitution of the key lysine residues only stimulated reprogramming slightly. KLF5 is another KLF member with an established link to embryonic stem cell pluripotency. Interestingly, although it was much more efficiently sumoylated than either KLF2 or KLF4, KLF5 was inactive in reprogramming, and its sumoylation was not responsible for this deficiency. Furthermore, sumoylation of KLF4 but not KLF2 or KLF5 stimulated adipocyte differentiation. These results thus demonstrate the importance KLF4 sumoylation in regulating pluripotency and adipocyte differentiation.

Post-translational modification is essential for regulating protein functions in diverse organisms.

SUMO2 and SUMO3 are highly homologous (95% identical) and allow both mono- and polysumoylation (5Hay R.T. SUMO: a history of modification.Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). SUMO1 is 47% identical to SUMO2 and -3, but it lacks the key lysine residue for polysumoylation, thereby conferring only monosumoylation (2Hochstrasser M.

Strikingly, both are among the four transcription factors initially found to reprogram mouse fibroblasts to iPS cells (17Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18948) Google Scholar). The other two reprogramming factors are OCT4 (also known as Pou5f1) and c-MYC. Interestingly, OCT4 also contains a sumoylation site (18Wei F. Schöler H.R. Atchison M.L.

In addition, two KLF4 homologs, KLF2 and KLF5, play a role in reprogramming (20Nakagawa M. Koyanagi M. Tanabe K. Takahashi K. Ichisaka T. Aoi T. Okita K. Mochiduki Y. Takizawa N. Yamanaka S.

Although KLF5 is known to be sumoylated (21Du J.X. Bialkowska A.B. McConnell B.B. Yang V.W. SUMOylation regulates nuclear localization of Kruppel-like factor 5.J. Biol.

Med. 2008; 14: 656-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), KLF2 possesses two putative sumoylation sites awaiting characterization. Furthermore, ERRs are subject to phosphorylation-dependent sumoylation and have a role in reprogramming (12Tremblay A.M. Wilson B.J. Yang X.J. Giguère V.

These observations suggest the intriguing possibility that sumoylation regulates iPS cell generation and pluripotency. Since the initial description of iPS cell formation by ectopic expression of only four transcription factors (17Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18948) Google Scholar), there have been intensive research efforts to apply this technology to disease modeling and autologous cell therapy (24Jaenisch R.

A better understanding of the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms is important for further improvement and eventual optimization of this powerful technology. Although post-translational modifications such as sumoylation are crucial for various transcription factors to function (27Holmberg C.I. Tran S.E. Eriksson J.E. Sistonen L.

Sci. 2002; 27: 619-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 28Latham J.A. Dent S.Y. Cross-regulation of histone modifications.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Cell. 2008; 31: 449-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), it remains not so clear how such modifications may affect iPS cell generation. We thus analyzed how sumoylation of KLF4, SOX2, and OCT4 may regulate iPS cell formation. Here, we report that sumoylation of these factors inhibits iPS cell induction. Interestingly, KLF4 sumoylation appeared to stimulate adipocyte differentiation. In addition, we analyzed KLF2 and KLF5. Like KLF5, KLF2 was sumoylated at two sumoylation sites. However, substitution of the sumoylation sites on KLF2 or KLF5 had minimal effects on reprogramming or adipocyte differentiation. These findings support the importance of KLF4 sumoylation in pluripotency induction and adipocyte differentiation. HEK293 and 3T3-L1 were cultured and expanded in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and penicillin and streptomycin (50 μg/ml each). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were derived from 13.5-day post-coitus mouse embryos as described previously (30Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from adult human fibroblasts by defined factors.Cell. 2007; 131: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15033) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 13.5-day post-coitus pregnant mouse (FVB strain, Jax) was sacrificed by cervical dislocation under sterile conditions, and the embryos were surgically removed from the uterus. After the head, forelimb, tail, and abdomen were surgically removed, the remaining embryos were nipped into pieces and incubated in 0.25% trypsin for 30 min. Trypsinization was repeated twice, and after each time, trypsinized cells were separated from the tissue pieces and plated onto a 10-cm culture dish. This was considered as passage 0, and MEFs were expanded for 3 to 4 passages. MEFs at passages 2–3 were used for iPS cell generation. For preparation of feeder layers, MEFs were irradiated at 6000 rads or treated with 10 μg/ml mitomycin C (Sigma) for 3 h. FVB mice were maintained, bred, and sacrificed according to an animal use protocol approved by McGill University Animal Care Committee. For MEF preparation, we encountered mysterious contamination by “black swimming dots,” which appeared to be very similar to what was reported to be Achromobacter (31Gray J.S. Birmingham J.M. Fenton J.I. Got black swimming dots in your cell culture? Identification of Achromobacter as a novel cell culture contaminant.Biologicals. 2010; 38: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In light of the similarity, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin (10 μg/ml each; Sigma, Cat. nos. 17850 and P8396, respectively) were included in the MEF medium. The former is an acid and was prepared in 30 mm NaOH for a 10 mg/ml stock, prior to sterilization by filtration, whereas the latter is a salt and was prepared in water or PBS, with all stocks stored as aliquots at −20 °C). This remedy was effective in eradiating and preventing the contamination. Such contamination has occurred in many other laboratories (31Gray J.S. Birmingham J.M. Fenton J.I.

The following expression plasmids or cDNA constructs were purchased from Open Biosystems: KLF2 (BC071983); KLF4 (MHS1011-7509690); KLF5 (MHS1011-61504); OCT4 (MHS1768-98081221); SOX2 (MHS1011-169828), and c-Myc (MHS1010-9205764). The following lentivirus plasmids were obtained from Addgene: pLOVE (15948); pLOVE-Klf4 (15950); pLOVE-N-MYC (15951); pSin-EF2-SOX2-Pur (16577), and pSin-EF2-OCT4-Pur (16579). The plasmids for FLAG-tagged wild-type and mutant proteins were constructed by use of standard subcloning and mutagenesis protocols. Lentiviral shuttle vectors were prepared on pENTR11 for homologous recombination with pLOVE via the Gateway system (Invitrogen). The following antibodies were purchased as specified: anti-Gal4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, RK5CI); anti-FLAG (Sigma, F3165); anti-HA (Babco/Covance); anti-mouse HRP IgG (Amersham Biosciences, NA93IV); goat anti-rabbit IgG (Fisher, AP307FMI); anti-Nanog (Bethyl Laboratories, BL1662); anti-KLF4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, H-180), and anti-Ssea-1 (Cell Signaling Technology, MC-480). The procedure has been described previously (11Grégoire S. Tremblay A.M. Xiao L. Yang Q. Ma K. Nie J. Mao Z. Wu Z. Giguère V. Yang X.J.

Briefly, an HA-tagged SUMO construct and a FLAG-tagged transcription factor construct were co-transfected into HEK293 cells by using the Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen, 301307). After 48 h, the cells were lysed in buffer S (SDS sample buffer (0.15 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 5% SDS, and 30% glycerol) diluted 1:10 in PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors), followed by 15 s of sonication three times at the power setting of 3.5 (Model Virsonic 100 sonicator) to break up chromatin and decrease the viscosity. Anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma, A2220) were used to immunoprecipitate FLAG-tagged proteins according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, prewashed anti-FLAG M2-agarose was mixed with soluble extracts and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. The agarose was collected by centrifugation at 400 × g for 1 min and washed three times with buffer R (PBS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 12.8 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors). For elution, the agarose was incubated with buffer R containing 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide for 30 min on a rotator at 4 °C. After a brief spin, the supernatant was collected for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. On the day before transfection, 4 × 104 HEK293 cells or 2 × 104 MEFs were seeded per well onto a 12-well plate. 200 ng of the luciferase reporter Gal4-tk-luc or Nanog-luc (pGL3-Nanog(−2342 to +50), obtained from Takashi Tada, Kyoto University (32Kuroda T.

The transfection reagents Superfect (Qiagen, catalog no. 301307) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, catalog no. 11668-019) were employed for transfection of HEK293 cells and MEFs, respectively. 48 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed in situ, and soluble extracts were prepared for measurement of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities with a 96-well plate luminometer (Dynex). d-(−)-Luciferin (Roche Applied Science) and Galacto-Light Plus (Tropix) were used as the substrates for luciferase and β-galactosidase, respectively. The procedure has been described previously (33Dufour C.R. Wilson B.J. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Alaynick W.A. Downes M. Evans R.M. Blanchette M. Giguère V.

On irradiated MEF feeders precultured on three 10-cm gelatinized culture dishes, mouse R1 ES cells were grown to ∼90% confluency, resulting in ∼1.5 × 107 cells for ChIP. 0.27 ml of 37% formaldehyde was added directly to each dish to achieve a final concentration of 1%. The three dishes were transferred to an orbital shaker and shaken for 10 min at room temperature. This cross-linking reaction was stopped by addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m, which was followed by a 5-min incubation at room temperature. The dishes were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped on ice to harvest the cells in some residual PBS. The cell suspension was combined into one Falcon tube and centrifuged at 220 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was lysed in 150 μl of the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors) and sonicated three times on ice for 20 s each at setting 6 (Virsonic 100 sonicator). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was diluted in 1.2 ml of ChIP dilution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl). Sheared salmon sperm DNA was mixed with protein A-agarose (Upstate) and incubated with the diluted lysate for pre-clearance. The suspension was rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. After brief centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The next day, 40 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose bead suspension was added into the lysate/antibody mixture and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then separated from the lysate by centrifugation at 750 × g for 1 min, resuspended in 1 ml of wash buffer 1 (low salt buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton, and 2 mm EDTA), and rotated for 10 min. The beads were separated from buffer 1 by brief centrifugation and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer 2 (high salt buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton, and 2 mm EDTA). The same washing step was repeated in freshly prepared buffer 3 (LiCl buffer: 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% sodium deoxycholate) and cold buffer TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA). 150 μl of de-crosslink buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3 and 1% SDS) was added onto the beads and incubated at 65 °C for 6–18 h. The supernatant was mixed with 5 μl of proteinase K (1 mg/ml) and incubated for 1 h at 55 °C. Afterward, DNA was purified with the QIAQuick PCR purification column kit (Qiagen) for PCR. For the Nanog promoter, the PCR primers were 5′-GTGAAATGAGGTAAAGCCTCTTTT-3′ and 5′-AAGGCCAACGGCTCAAGGCGATAG-3′. For the Lefty promoter, the primers 5′-AAGCTGCAGACTTCATTCCA-3′ and 5′-CGGGGGATAGATGAAGAAAC-3′ were used (34Nakatake Y. Fukui N. Iwamatsu Y. Masui S. Takahashi K. Yagi R. Yagi K. Miyazaki J. Matoba R.

Coverslips were flamed and put onto wells of 12- or 24-well dishes for culturing cells. Coverslips containing cultured cells were washed twice with PBS prior to fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 solution/PBS for 10 min. Afterward, the coverslips were rinsed three times with 100 mm glycine/PBS and blocked in the blocking solution (2% BSA prepared in the IF buffer (PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.05% Tween 20)). After 30 min, the coverslips were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibodies diluted 1:100 or 1:200 in the blocking solution. Cells were then washed three times with the IF buffer and incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (diluted 1:500 to 1:1000) for 45 min. Afterward, the coverslips were rinsed three times with the IF buffer, briefly exposed to DAPI or Hoechst 33258 to stain the nuclei, and mounted for examination under a Zeiss Axiovert 135 fluorescence microscope. 293FT cells (Invitrogen) were maintained in DMEM/10% FBS medium containing 400 μg/ml neomycin (geneticin, Invitrogen, catalog no. 11811-098) per the manufacturer's instructions and incubated in the antibiotic-free medium for at least 8 h prior to transfection with Lipofectamine 2000. 10 μg of expression plasmid was mixed with 6.5 μg of psPAX2, 3.5 μg of pMD2.G, 50 μl of Lipofectamine 2000, and 1 ml of Opti-MEM to transfect 8 × 106 293FT cells in a 10-cm dish according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). 24 h post-transfection, the medium was collected as the viral supernatant everyday for 3 days and was subjected to centrifugation at 76,000 × g for 1.5 h. The viral pellet was then suspended in DMEM, 10% heat-inactivated FBS and rotated overnight at 4 °C. The resulting virus supernatant was used to infect cells directly or was flash-frozen in aliquots on dry ice for long term storage at −80 °C. The procedure for drug selection-free iPS cell induction has been described previously (35Blelloch R. Venere M. Yen J. Ramalho-Santos M.

Briefly, the day before virus infection, MEFs (passage 2 or 3) were plated at 0.8–1 × 105 cells per well for a 12-well plate or 3 × 105 cells per well of a 6-well plate and incubated overnight in DMEM containing 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (50 μg/ml each) inside a 37 °C CO2 incubator. The next day, the cells were washed once with PBS or plain DMEM and refed with DMEM, 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 8 μg/ml Polybrene. After addition of the concentrated virus stock (suspended in DMEM, 10% heat-inactivated FBS, see above) to the medium, the cells were incubated in a 37 °C CO2 incubator for 2 days. The virus-containing medium was then removed, and the cells were then washed once with PBS or plain DMEM for culturing in the mESC medium (DMEM high glucose, 1% nonessential amino acids (100× stock, Invitrogen), 1% sodium pyruvate (100× stock, Invitrogen), 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 15% FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin (50 μg/ml each), and 1000 units of murine leukemia inhibitory factor/ml (Millipore, ESGRO®)).

https://openalex.org/W1986259463,"Improper regulation of B cell responses leads to excessive production of antibodies and contributes to the development of autoimmune disease. T helper 17 (Th17) cells also drive the development of autoimmune disease, but the role of B cells in shaping Th17 cell-mediated immune responses, as well as the reciprocal regulation of B cell responses by IL-17 family cytokines, remains unclear. The aim of this study was to characterize the regulation of IL-17A and IL-17F in a model of T cell-dependent B cell activation. Stimulation of primary human B cell and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (BT) co-cultures with α-IgM and a non-mitogenic concentration of superantigens for three days promoted a Th17 cell response as evidenced by increased expression of Th17-related gene transcripts, including Il17f, Il21, Il22, and Il23r, in CD4 T cells, as well as the secretion of IL-17A and IL-17F protein. We tested the ability of 144 pharmacologic modulators representing 91 different targets or pathways to regulate IL-17A and IL-17F production in these stimulated BT co-cultures. IL-17A production was found to be preferentially sensitive to inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR pathway, while prostaglandin EP receptor agonists, including PGE2, increased IL-17A concentrations. In contrast, the production of IL-17F was inhibited by PGE2, but selectively increased by TLR2 and TLR5 agonists. These results indicate that IL-17A regulation is distinct from IL-17F in stimulated BT co-cultures and that this co-culture approach can be used to identify pathway mechanisms and novel agents that selectively inhibit production of IL-17A or IL-17F."
https://openalex.org/W1964142134,"The visual-analogue scale (VAS), Likert item (rating scale), pills identification test (PIT), and medication possession ratio (MPR) provide estimates of antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence which correlate with HIV viral suppression. These simple adherence measures are inexpensive and easy to administer; however, require validation and adjustment prior to implementation. The objective of this study was to define the optimal adherence assessment measure in Namibia to identify patients at risk for sub-optimal adherence and poor virologic response 6 months after ART initiation. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in HIV-infected adults receiving ART for 6-12 months prior to the adherence assessment. Adherence measures included 30-day VAS, 30-day Likert item, self-reported treatment interruptions, PIT, and MPR. Association of adherence measures with 6-month HIV-1 RNA level was assessed using two thresholds (1000 copies/mL and 5000 copies/mL). Adherence was assessed in 236 patients, mean age 37.3 years, 54% female. Mean adherence was 98.1% by 30-day VAS, 84.7% by 30-day Likert item, 97.0% by self-reported treatment interruptions, 90.6% by PIT, and 98.8% by MPR. Agreement between adherence measures was poor using kappa statistic. 76% had HIV-1 RNA <1000 copies/ml, and 88% had HIV-1 RNA <5000 copies/ml. MPR (continuous) was associated with viral suppression <5000 copies/ml (p = 0.036). MPR <75% was associated with virologic failure at ≥5000 copies/ml with OR 3.89 (1.24, 12.21), p = 0.013. Adherence was high with all measures. Only MPR, was associated with short-term virologic response, suggesting its cross-culturally utility for early identification of patients at high risk for virologic failure."

A genome-wide association study of 2054 GeneBank subjects identified a single locus immediately adjacent to the BCHE (butyrylcholinesterase) gene associated with plasma aspirin hydrolytic activity (lead SNP, rs6445035; p = 9.1 × 10−17). However, its penetrance was low, and plasma from an individual with an inactivating mutation in BCHE still effectively hydrolyzed aspirin. A second aspirin hydrolase was identified in plasma, the purification of which showed it to be homomeric PAFAH1b2. This is distinct from the erythrocyte PAFAH1b2/PAFAH1b3 heterodimer. Inhibitors showed that both butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and PAFAH1b2 contribute to aspirin hydrolysis in plasma, with variation primarily reflecting non-genetic variation of BChE activity.

We identified enzymes in plasma that hydrolyze aspirin and found that BChE and a new extracellular form of PAFAH1b together account for aspirin hydrolysis in plasma. The rate of aspirin hydrolysis varied widely among donors, primarily from epigenetic BChE variation, and was sufficient to alter platelet sensitivity to aspirin inhibition. Aspirin, acetaminophen, Cibacron blue 3GA-agarose (type 3000-CL), potassium bromide, phenyl acetate, purified human plasma BChE, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and butyrylthiocholine iodide were from Sigma. Salicylic acid and HPLC-grade solvents (acetonitrile, formic acid, and water) were from Mallinckrodt Baker. ECL kits were from Amersham Biosciences. Polyclonal antibodies against BChE and PON1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), antibody against apoA-I was from R&D Systems, antibody against PAFAH1b2 was from Sigma, and antibody against PAFAH1b3 was from Proteintech Group (Chicago, IL). Salicylic acid from aspirin hydrolysis was isolated by reversed-phase HPLC and quantified by absorption with recovery corrected by an acetaminophen internal standard. Plasma (10 μl) was added to aspirin (4 mm) in 40 μl of PBS (37 °C, pH 7.2) for 2 h before stopping the reaction with 150 μl of acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid and 20 μg/ml acetaminophen, followed by centrifugation to remove precipitated proteins. The assay was linear over the plasma volumes used, and plasma aspirin hydrolysis was stable to freezing and storage at −80 °C for 24 months (p = 0.039).

The dialysate was passed over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, and bound protein was recovered with the first dialysis buffer and stored at 4 °C. Recombinant PON1 had a specific activity of (5.0 ± 0.1) × 105 units/mg of protein against phenyl acetate with protein determined with bicinchoninic acid. BChE activity was measured by hydrolysis of 2 mm butyrylthiocholine iodide in phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) over 2 min at room temperature using 1 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (31Ellman G.L. Tissue sulfhydryl groups.Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21424) Google Scholar) to detect thiocholine at A412 (13,260 m−1 cm−1). The arylesterase activity of PON1 was determined spectrophotometrically using phenyl acetate as the substrate (32Kuo C.L. La Du B.N. Comparison of purified human and rabbit serum paraoxonases.Drug Metab. Dispos. 1995; 23: 935-944PubMed Google Scholar). The assay contained 1 mm phenyl acetate, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), and 1 mm CaCl2. Blanks without enzyme were used to correct for spontaneous hydrolysis. Activity was calculated from a molar extinction coefficient at 270 nm (using differences in the absorbance of phenol versus phenyl acetate) of 1310 m−1 cm−1. One unit of arylesterase activity is defined as 1 μmol of phenyl acetate hydrolyzed per min. Potential inhibition of BChE (0.6 μg) or platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAFAH; 0.5 μg) hydrolysis of 4 mm aspirin in plasma (10 μl) or by human serum albumin (50 mg) was assayed in a final volume of 50 μl of PBS for 2 h. Aggregation of washed human platelets (4 × 108/ml) was initiated by stimulation with collagen (5 μg/ml) with stirring in a Chrono-log aggregometer. Platelets were incubated or not with the indicated amount of aspirin for 10 min prior to aggregometry. ApoA-I, BChE, type I PAFAH (PAFAH1b2 and PAFAH1b3), and PON1 were visualized by immunoblotting after electrophoretic separation by SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), probed with primary and secondary antibodies at the manufacturer's suggested dilution, and visualized using extended chemiluminescence reagent and x-ray film. The Cleveland Clinic GeneBank study is a single site sample repository generated from consecutive patients undergoing elective diagnostic coronary angiography or elective cardiac computed tomographic angiography with extensive clinical and laboratory characterization and longitudinal observation. Subject recruitment occurred between 2001 and 2006. Ethnicity was self-reported, and information regarding demographics, medical history, and medication use was obtained in patient interviews and confirmed by chart reviews. All clinical outcome data were verified by source documentation. Coronary artery disease (CAD) was defined as adjudicated diagnoses of stable or unstable angina, myocardial infarction (adjudicated definition based on defined electrocardiographic changes or elevated cardiac enzymes), angiographic evidence of ≥50% stenosis of one or more major epicardial vessels, and/or a history of known CAD (documented myocardial infarction, CAD, or history of revascularization). Control subjects were classified as having <30% stenosis in any vessel and no history of known CAD. The GeneBank cohort has been used previously for discovery and replication of novel genes and risk factors for atherosclerotic disease (33Bhattacharyya T. Nicholls S.J. Topol E.J. Zhang R. Yang X.

Biol. 2012; 32: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For this study, aspirin hydrolase activity was determined in plasma from 2226 subjects. Activity was obtained from a single measurement, which was validated by reanalysis of 285 randomly selected samples. All patients provided written informed consent prior to being enrolled in GeneBank, and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Cleveland Clinic. BChE null plasma was a gift from Dr. Oksana Lockridge (Nebraska Medical Center). Genome-wide genotyping of SNPs was performed on the Affymetrix genome-wide human array 6.0 chip. Using these data and those from 120 phased chromosomes from the HapMap CEU samples (HapMap r22 release, NCBI build 36), genotypes were imputed for untyped autosomal SNPs across the genome using MACH 1.0 software. All imputations were done on the forward (+)-strand using 562,554 genotyped SNPS that had passed quality control filters. Quality control filters for the imputed data set excluded SNPs with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p values <0.0001, call rates <97%, or minor allele frequencies <1% and individuals with <90% call rates. This resulted in 2,421,770 autosomal SNPs in 2054 subjects in whom plasma aspirin hydrolytic activity was available for analysis. Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and each assay was performed in triplicate. Genome-wide linear regression analyses were used to identify loci associated with plasma aspirin hydrolase activity after adjustment for age and gender under an additive model. Genetic analyses were carried out with PLINK v1.07, and a genome-wide p value of <5 × 10−8 was considered significant evidence for association. Aspirin was hydrolyzed in cell-free plasma but with considerable variation. The rate of hydrolysis ranged by 7-fold from 3.67 to 24.70 nmol/ml/min among 11 healthy donors (Fig. 1A). Aspirin irreversibly inactivates platelet cyclooxygenase and thromboxane A2 production, thereby inhibiting aggregation induced by weak agonists. Aspirin inhibited platelet aggregation induced by collagen in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 1B). Platelet-poor plasma reduced the effectiveness of aspirin in suppressing this aggregation, but again, the effectiveness of plasma in blocking aspirin inhibition varied among donors. Plasma from donor 6, able to hydrolyze aspirin only at 3.75 nmol/ml/min, was less effective in suppressing platelet aggregation by 33 μm aspirin compared with plasma from donor 3, which hydrolyzed aspirin at a rate of 8.75 nmol/ml/min (Fig. 1C). We established a high-throughput assay to examine population variation in plasma aspirin hydrolytic activity. These assays were carried out in plasma from 2226 individuals enrolled in the GeneBank study, with 1928 individuals having CAD and 298 subjects being defined as controls. Among these subjects, the minimum and maximum of aspirin hydrolytic activity were 3.06 and 37.38 nmol/ml/min, respectively, with a mean of 16.33 nmol/ml/min and a standard deviation of 4.36 nmol/ml/min (Fig. 1D). Values from duplicate measurements in 285 randomly selected samples yielded high correlations (data not shown). Thus, variation in aspirin hydrolytic activity among the 2226 GeneBank subjects was ∼12-fold and similar to the range observed in healthy donors. Furthermore, aspirin hydrolytic activity was significantly higher (p = 3.4 × 10−8) in CAD cases compared with control subjects (Fig. 1E). We sought to identify the genetic determinants of variation in plasma aspirin hydrolytic activity using an unbiased approach. We performed a GWAS analysis for aspirin hydrolytic activity using ∼2.4 million genotyped and imputed SNPs in 2054 GeneBank subjects (all of Caucasian ancestry) for whom both genotype and phenotype data were available. The Q-Q plot from these analyses is shown in Fig. 2A, and the observed genomic control factor was 1.0, suggesting that the GWAS results were not confounded by underlying population stratification. As shown by the Manhattan plot in Fig. 2B, plasma aspirin hydrolytic activity was controlled primarily by a single locus on chromosome 3q26.1 containing BCHE, where the lead SNP, rs6445035 (G → A), yielded a highly significant p value of 9.1 × 10−17. BCHE encodes the enzyme BChE, homozygous mutations of which confer susceptibility to prolonged apnea after administration of the muscle relaxant suxamethonium (succinylcholine) (37Soliday F.K. Conley Y.P. Henker R. Pseudocholinesterase deficiency: a comprehensive review of genetic, acquired, and drug influences.AANA J. 2010; 78: 313-320PubMed Google Scholar). A regional plot of 1 megabase centered around BCHE also revealed that other SNPs yielding significant p values in this region are in moderate-to-high linkage disequilibrium with rs6445035 (Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 2D, each copy of the A allele lowered aspirin hydrolytic activity by ∼1.2 nmol/ml/min. The minor allele (A) of rs6445035 had a frequency of 0.19, explained 3.3% of the variation in aspirin hydrolytic activity, and was located 10.6 kb centromeric to the 3′ terminus of BCHE (Fig. 2C). To determine whether the other SNPs in this region represent independent association signals, we also ran analyses taking into account the effect of the lead SNP (rs6445035). However, these conditional analyses did not reveal other SNPs associated with aspirin hydrolase activity at the genome-wide threshold for significance (data not shown). Our genetic studies implicated BChE as a plasma aspirin esterase, which is supported by aspirin hydrolysis by purified BChE (27Masson P. Froment M.T. Fortier P.L. Visicchio J.E. Bartels C.F. Lockridge O. Butyrylcholinesterase-catalysed hydrolysis of aspirin, a negatively charged ester, and aspirin-related neutral esters.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, Western blotting showed that partially purified material from the soluble faction of plasma contained little of the enzyme, but at least 200 ng of purified BChE was required to achieve aspirin hydrolysis equivalent to that in the purified fraction (Fig. 2E). These results suggest that human plasma may contain additional aspirin hydrolytic activity. To investigate this, we obtained plasma from an individual homozygous for a frameshift mutation in BCHE, which leads to a premature stop codon (38Nogueira C.P. McGuire M.C. Graeser C. Bartels C.F. Arpagaus M. Van der Spek A.F. Lightstone H. Lockridge O. La Du B.N. Identification of a frameshift mutation responsible for the silent phenotype of human serum cholinesterase, Gly 117 (GGT—-GGAG).Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 46: 934-942PubMed Google Scholar). Although plasma from this individual was unable to hydrolyze the BChE substrate butyrylthiocholine (Fig. 2F), this complete loss of BChE activity did not result in a corresponding loss of aspirin hydrolysis. Aspirin hydrolytic activity is reported (28Santanam N. Parthasarathy S.

Med. 2011; 17: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In contrast, density gradient separation of plasma showed that aspirin esterase activity was a soluble activity and that apoA-I-containing lipoprotein particles were essentially devoid of activity (Fig. 3A). This conclusion was supported by the inability of functional recombinant PON1 to hydrolyze aspirin (Fig. 3B). Purification of soluble fraction 1 and mass spectrometry of candidate proteins as described (20Zhou G. Marathe G.K. Willard B. McIntyre T.M.

They protect cells from a range of apoptotic stimuli, reduce the Ca2+ content of intracellular stores, and regulate Ca2+ fluxes. GAAP was discovered in camelpox virus, but it is highly conserved throughout evolution and encoded by all eukaryote genomes examined. GAAPs are part of the transmembrane Bax inhibitor-containing motif (TMBIM) family that also includes other anti-apoptotic and Ca2+-modulating membrane proteins. Most TMBIM members show multiple bands when analyzed by SDS-PAGE, suggesting that they may be oligomeric. However, the molecular mechanisms of oligomerization, the native state of GAAPs in living cells and the functional significance of oligomerization have not been addressed. TMBIM members are thought to have evolved from an ancestral GAAP. Two different GAAPs, human (h) and viral (v)GAAP were therefore selected as models to examine oligomerization of TMBIM family members. We show that both hGAAP and vGAAP in their native states form oligomers and that oligomerization is pH-dependent. Surprisingly, hGAAP and vGAAP do not share the same oligomerization mechanism. Oligomerization of hGAAP is independent of cysteines, but oligomerization of vGAAP depends on cysteines 9 and 60. A mutant vGAAP that is unable to oligomerize revealed that monomeric vGAAP retains both its anti-apoptotic function and its effect on intracellular Ca2+ stores.

Furthermore, its mRNA levels are dysregulated in some human breast tumors, making it a putative oncogene and a possible target for anti-cancer therapy (3van ‘t Veer L.J. Dai H. van de Vijver M.J.

Gene expression profiling predicts clinical outcome of breast cancer.Nature. 2002; 415: 530-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (7786) Google Scholar). GAAPs are highly conserved, and closely related proteins are predicted to be encoded by the genomes of fungi, plants, and animals (1Gubser C. Bergamaschi D. Hollinshead M. Lu X. van Kuppeveld F.J. Smith G.L. A new inhibitor of apoptosis from vaccinia virus and eukaryotes.PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e17Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). All GAAPs, from evolutionarily diverse sources, have similar lengths and hydrophobicity profiles that point to important and conserved functions. Cells in which hGAAP was knocked down using siRNA died but were rescued by expression of vGAAP (1Gubser C. Bergamaschi D. Hollinshead M. Lu X. van Kuppeveld F.J. Smith G.L. A new inhibitor of apoptosis from vaccinia virus and eukaryotes.PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e17Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), suggesting that the two GAAPs are functionally interchangeable. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that GAAPs are ancient within eukaryotes. Some members of the transmembrane Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein) inhibitor-containing motif (TMBIM) family may have derived from a GAAP ancestor ∼2,000 million years ago (4Hu L. Smith T.F. Goldberger G. LFG: a candidate apoptosis regulatory gene family.Apoptosis. 2009; 14: 1255-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Members of the TMBIM family include TMBIM1 or RESC (responsive to centrifugal force and shear stress gene 1 protein), TMBIM2 or LFG (lifeguard protein), TMBIM3 or GRINA (glutamate receptor ionotropic NMDA-associated protein), TMBIM4 or GAAP, TMBIM5 or GHITM (growth hormone-inducible transmembrane protein), and TMBIM6 or BI-1 (Bax inhibitor 1) (1Gubser C.

All TMBIM proteins are predicted to have similar secondary structures, consisting of multiple transmembrane domains (TMDs) with short interconnecting loops, a charged C terminus, and a conserved UPF0005 motif with unknown function that stretches from the beginning of the third to the middle of the fourth TMD (4Hu L.

The Bax Inhibitor-1 (BI-1) family in apoptosis and tumorigenesis.Curr. Mol. Med. 2008; 8: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recently, vGAAP, hGAAP, and BI-1 were shown to have a six TMD topology with cytosolic N and C termini and a likely re-entrant loop at the C terminus (9Carrara G. Saraiva N. Gubser C. Johnson B.F.

Chem. 2012; 287: 15896-15905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Similar to GAAP, BI-1 is a widely expressed and evolutionarily conserved protein that protects cells from many different intrinsic and extrinsic death stimuli (5Xu Q. Reed J.C. Bax inhibitor-1, a mammalian apoptosis suppressor identified by functional screening in yeast.Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 337-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). It is the most studied member of the TMBIM family. BI-1 localizes primarily to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, where it causes pH-dependent Ca2+ leakage that reduces the ER Ca2+ content, and so the amount of Ca2+ released upon stimulation (10Xu C. Xu W. Palmer A.E. Reed J.C. BI-1 regulates endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ homeostasis downstream of Bcl-2 family proteins.J. Biol.

Work with purified BI-1 reconstituted into liposomes suggests it has a Ca2+/H+ antiporter-like (11Ahn T. Yun C.H. Chae H.Z. Kim H.R. Chae H.J.

The C terminus of Bax inhibitor-1 forms a Ca2+-permeable channel pore.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 2544-2557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Moreover, two aspartic acid residues (Asp209 and Asp213) in BI-1 are essential for Ca2+ flux from the ER (12Bultynck G. Kiviluoto S. Henke N. Ivanova H. Schneider L. Rybalchenko V. Luyten T. Nuyts K.

Chem. 2012; 287: 2544-2557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Regulation of the Ca2+ content of the ER by BI-1 suggests a possible mechanism for its anti-apoptotic function. GAAPs localize primarily to Golgi membranes and, similar to BI-1, have a broad spectrum of anti-apoptotic activity. This suggests a possible link with intracellular Ca2+, which plays important roles in apoptosis triggered by different stimuli (13Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P. Regulation of cell death: the calcium-apoptosis link.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). This suggestion is also consistent with measurements of the Ca2+ content of organelles after overexpression or knockdown of hGAAP (14de Mattia F. Gubser C. van Dommelen M.M. Visch H.J. Distelmaier F. Postigo A. Luyten T. Parys J.B. de Smedt H. Smith G.L. Willems P.H. van Kuppeveld F.J. Human Golgi antiapoptotic protein modulates intracellular calcium fluxes.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 3638-3645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of hGAAP reduced the Ca2+ content of the Golgi and ER and the amount of Ca2+ released by an apoptotic stimulus (14de Mattia F. Gubser C. van Dommelen M.M. Visch H.J. Distelmaier F. Postigo A. Luyten T. Parys J.B. de Smedt H. Smith G.L. Willems P.H. van Kuppeveld F.J. Human Golgi antiapoptotic protein modulates intracellular calcium fluxes.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 3638-3645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects of GAAPs on Ca2+ signaling might explain their broad anti-apoptotic activity, although a causal link is yet to be established. The membrane topology of TMBIM proteins has been established (9Carrara G. Saraiva N. Gubser C. Johnson B.F. Smith G.L.

Most TMBIM proteins show multiple bands on SDS-PAGE, suggesting the existence of oligomers. However, neither the oligomeric state of TMBIM proteins in native membranes nor the determinants or functional consequences of oligomerization are known. To address these questions, the mechanisms of oligomerization of vGAAP and hGAAP were studied in biochemical and cell-based assays. Data presented reveal that both vGAAP and hGAAP oligomerized in a pH-dependent manner. However, the mechanisms of oligomerization are different for vGAAP and hGAAP. Disulfide bonds, and specifically cysteine residues 9 and 60, are required for vGAAP but not for hGAAP oligomerization. In functional assays, a mutant vGAAP in which oligomerization was prevented retained both its anti-apoptotic activity and its ability to modulate the Ca2+ content of intracellular stores. We conclude that monomeric GAAP can regulate both Ca2+ signaling and apoptosis. The pcDNA3.1 plasmids containing vGAAP-HA and hGAAP-HA were described previously (1Gubser C. Bergamaschi D. Hollinshead M. Lu X. van Kuppeveld F.J. Smith G.L. A new inhibitor of apoptosis from vaccinia virus and eukaryotes.PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e17Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding C-terminal HA fusions of GAAP TMD1–4 (vGAAP residues 1–146 and hGAAP residues 1–145) and TMD5–6 (vGAAP residues 147–237 and hGAAP residues 145–238) were generated by inserting PCR products of truncated vGAAP and hGAAP into the BamHI/EcoRI restriction sites of pcDNA3.1. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). PCR products of wild type and mutant vGAAP and hGAAP were subcloned into the NheI/AgeI restriction sites of pEGFP-C1 and ptdTomato-N1 (Clontech) to obtain GAAPs C-terminally tagged with GFP or tandem Tomato (Tom). These plasmids encode a flexible linker (GGSGGSGGSKR) between the GAAP and the fluorescent tag to allow folding flexibility. The coding sequences of all plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. A plasmid encoding GRASP65-GFP was a kind gift from Dr. Theresa Ward (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine). HeLa and U2-OS cells were maintained in MEM and DMEM, respectively, supplemented with 10% heat-treated (56 °C, 1 h) FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). HeLa cells were also supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine. Plasmid transfections were carried out using FuGENE6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HeLa polyclonal stable cell lines expressing C-terminally V5-tagged vGAAP or hGAAP were generated using the HIV-1-based lentiviral vector pdlNot′MCS′R′PK as described (9Carrara G. Saraiva N.

The HeLa A36-V5 cell line was described previously (15Doceul V. Hollinshead M. van der Linden L. Smith G.L.

The U2-OS stable cell lines expressing wild type or mutant vGAAP that were used in apoptosis assays were generated using a lentiviral bicistronic vector coding for GFP in the second cistron (a gift from Dr. Heike Laman, University of Cambridge). Transduced cells were sorted based on GFP expression using a MoFlo MLS high-speed cell sorter (Beckman Coulter) to obtain a population in which >95% of cells expressed GFP. CMLV GAAP was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultures engineered to express a cleavable C-terminal GFP-His8-tagged vGAAP under control of the galactose promoter, as described for other transmembrane proteins (16Drew D. Lerch M. Kunji E. Slotboom D.J. de Gier J.W. Optimization of membrane protein overexpression and purification using GFP fusions.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The protein was extracted in lauryldimethylamine oxide, purified, and analyzed according to the protocol developed by Drew et al. (16Drew D. Lerch M. Kunji E. Slotboom D.J. de Gier J.W.

The GFP-His8 tag was removed by adding His8-tagged tobacco etch virus protease to the purified vGAAP-His8-GFP at a molar ratio of 1:1 of GFP and tobacco etch virus protease and digested overnight at 4 °C. The presence of GFP-tagged proteins in protein samples resolved on 12% polyacrylamide Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) was assessed by in-gel GFP fluorescence. The gel was exposed to blue light (460 nm, cut-off filter 515 nm) for 10–60 s, and the image was captured with a LAS-1000–3000 charge-coupled device imaging system (Fujifilm). Cells were lysed on ice in lysis buffer comprising 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% CHAPS (w/v), protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Roche). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min, mixed with 5× reducing (0.01–5 mm DTT) or non-reducing (no DTT) loading buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using RDye-conjugated secondary antibodies and a Li-COR scanner (Odyssey). The following antibodies and dilutions were used: 1:5000 anti-HA (Sigma), 1:5000 anti-V5 (AbD Serotec, Ltd.), 1:10,000 anti-tubulin (Millipore), 1:1000 anti-GAAP (1Gubser C. Bergamaschi D.

A new inhibitor of apoptosis from vaccinia virus and eukaryotes.PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e17Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), 1:2500 anti-GFP (Clontech), and 1:2000 anti-FLAG (Sigma). HeLa cells stably expressing V5-tagged hGAAP or vGAAP were transfected with the appropriate plasmids, and 18 h later were lysed in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% CHAPS (w/v), protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Roche Diagnostics)). The total protein content was normalized after measurements with a BCA assay (Pierce). The anti-V5 antibody was added to the lysates and incubated overnight. Protein G-Sepharose beads (Roche Diagnostics) were incubated with the lysates for 2 h at 4 °C, washed four times with 1 ml of IP buffer, resuspended in 5× reducing loading buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. HeLa cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 encoding vGAAP-HA or hGAAP-HA were collected after 18 h, lysed in lysis buffer, and incubated with the lysine-reactive aryl halide 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DFDNB, 2.5–20 nm, 20 min at 37 °C). The reaction was stopped by addition of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5. For FRET, near-confluent cultures of HeLa cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) on glass coverslips (VWR) with a pair of plasmids encoding GFP- (0.5 μg) or Tom-tagged proteins (1.5 μg). These fluorescent proteins are a FRET pair, with GFP as donor and Tom as acceptor fluorophore (17van der Krogt G.N. Ogink J. Ponsioen B. Jalink K. A comparison of donor-acceptor pairs for genetically encoded FRET sensors: application to the Epac cAMP sensor as an example.PLoS One. 2008; 3: e1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). After 18 h, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and imaged using an Olympus IX81 microscope with a 60 × 1.45 numerical aperture objective and illumination with 488-nm or 561-nm diode-based lasers via appropriate filters. Images were acquired with an Andor iXon 897 camera and processed using Cell'R software (Olympus, Milton Keynes, UK). To determine FRET efficiency, images of each cell were acquired using 561 and 488 nm excitation, before and after photobleach of Tom by exposure to the unattenuated 561-nm laser for 60 s. At least 10 cells were imaged for each condition, and for each cell, a region corresponding to the Golgi was selected for analysis. FRET efficiency (E) was determined using the following formula, E=1-GFP B-(Tom B×C×GFPexp)TomexpGFP A-(Tom A×C×GFPexp)Tomexp(Eq. 1) where B denotes fluorescence intensity before photobleach; A denotes fluorescence intensity after photobleach; exp denotes units of exposure, and C denotes the fraction of Tom excitation from the 488-nm laser, relative to the 561-nm laser, per unit of exposure. Gray value images were obtained from pixel-by-pixel subtraction of GFP pre-bleach from GFP post-bleach images using NIH ImageJ software. For measurement of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in cell populations, cells from a confluent 75-cm2 flask of HeLa cells were resuspended in 200 μl of Hank's balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) and transfected with 0.5 μg DNA/10 μl cells using Neon nucleofection (Invitrogen). Transfected cells (10 μl/well) were seeded into 96-well plates, and after 24 h, when almost confluent, they were incubated with 6 μm Fura-2/AM (Invitrogen) for 40 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed, and measurements of [Ca2+]i were performed at 20 °C in Ca2+-free medium comprising 132 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm, MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.2. Fluorescence (excitation at 340 nm and 380 nm; emission at 510 nm) was measured using a fluorescence plate reader (FlexStation 3, MDS Analytical Devices). Background fluorescence was determined by addition of ionomycin (1 μm) with MnCl2 (10 mm), and background-corrected fluorescence ratios (F340/F380) were calibrated to [Ca2+]i using Ca2+ standard solutions (Invitrogen) and a KD for Ca2+ of 236 nm (18Groden D.L. Guan Z. Stokes B.T. Determination of Fura-2 dissociation constants following adjustment of the apparent Ca-EGTA association constant for temperature and ionic strength.Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). U2-OS cells were seeded in 96-well plates (103 cells/well). After 48 h, cells were treated with staurosporine (0.5 μm, 6–8 h), doxorubicin (3 μm, 48 h), or vehicle. Extrinsically triggered apoptosis was induced by incubation with cycloheximide (20 μg/ml) and TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 16 h. Caspase activity was then determined using Caspase-Glo 3/7 substrate (Promega). Multiple sequence alignments were performed using ClustalW (version 1.83). Transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 1:300 anti-GM130 (BD Biosciences) or 1:300 anti-HA (Cambridge Biosciences) and with secondary antibodies (1:500) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen). The coverslips were mounted in Mowiol 4–88 containing DAPI to stain nuclei. Cells were imaged by confocal microscopy using an LSM 5 PASCAL microscope (Zeiss). Images were acquired using the LSM image browser software (Zeiss). To investigate whether GAAPs oligomerize, plasmids encoding HA-tagged vGAAP or hGAAP were transfected into HeLa cells stably expressing vGAAP or hGAAP with a V5 tag (GAAP-V5). Cells stably expressing A36, another VACV membrane protein (19Parkinson J.E. Smith G.L. Vaccinia virus gene A36R encodes a M(r) 43–50 K protein on the surface of extracellular enveloped virus.Virology. 1994; 204: 376-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), with a V5 tag (15Doceul V. Hollinshead M. van der Linden L. Smith G.L. Repulsion of superinfecting virions: a mechanism for rapid virus spread.Science. 2010; 327: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), were used as controls for nonspecific pulldown of membrane proteins. Proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-V5 antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. HA-tagged vGAAP and hGAAP co-immunoprecipitated with V5-tagged vGAAP and hGAAP, respectively, but not with V5-tagged A36 (Fig. 1A). These results indicate that vGAAP and hGAAP interact, directly or indirectly, with themselves. To determine whether the association between GAAPs is direct, CMLV vGAAP was expressed in yeast, purified, and separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Four bands were observed, with sizes that were consistent with oligomeric forms of the protein (Fig. 1B), and each band reacted with an anti-GAAP antibody. These results are consistent with the presence of monomeric, dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric forms of GAAP (Fig. 1B), but they do not exclude heteromeric assembly of GAAP with another protein of similar size. However, the latter possibility is unlikely given the results from in-gel fluorescence of purified CMLV vGAAP-GFP (Fig. 1C). Under non-reducing conditions, these gels also revealed the presence of dimers of the larger GAAP-GFP proteins (Fig. 1C). Together, these results suggest that the interactions observed by co-IP are due to a direct interaction between GAAPs. In an attempt to characterize the stoichiometry of GAAP oligomerization, the lysine-reactive aryl halide DFDNB cross-linker was used (Fig. 1D). Because this hydrophobic cross-linker has a very short spacer arm and infiltrates membranes, it cross-links membrane proteins efficiently (20Kornblatt J.A. Lake D.F. Cross-linking of cytochrome oxidase subunits with difluorodinitrobenzene.Can J. Biochem. 1980; 58: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although bands representing oligomeric forms of GAAP were detected in non-reducing gels without cross-linking, they were more prominent after incubation with DFDNB (Fig. 1D). A semi-logarithmic plot of the predicted number of cross-linked monomers in each band against its relative gel mobility was linear (Fig. 1E), consistent with the assigned subunit stoichiometry. The main bands detected were of ∼20–23, ∼37–45, ∼60, and ∼80 kDa, consistent with the presence of monomeric, dimeric, trimeric and tetrameric forms of GAAP. The results using different methods applied to cell lysates and purified proteins demonstrate that GAAP forms tetramers. It is unclear whether the smaller oligomers and monomers are native states or result from incomplete retention of the tetramer during sample preparation, cross-linking, and gel analyses. The mechanism by which BI-1 allows Ca2+ to leak from the ER is pH-dependent. This was suggested to be directly related to increased oligomerization of BI-1 at lower pH (21Kim H.R. Lee G.H. Ha K.C. Ahn T. Moon J.Y. Lee B.J. Cho S.G. Kim S. Seo Y.R. Shin Y.J. Chae S.W. Reed J.C. Chae H.J. Bax Inhibitor-1 Is a pH-dependent regulator of Ca2+ channel activity in the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15946-15955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To investigate whether oligomerization of GAAPs was affected by pH, hGAAP-HA and vGAAP-HA were expressed in HeLa cells, extracted from membranes using CHAPS-based buffers of varying pH, and analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Oligomerization of both vGAAP and hGAAP occurred within the physiological pH range (Fig. 2, A and B). At pH 6, vGAAP was mostly monomeric/dimeric, but higher oligomers formed as the pH increased. Oligomerization of vGAAP peaked at pH 7, whereas oligomerization of hGAAP increased up to pH 8. Analysis of vGAAP and hGAAP by non-reducing SDS-PAGE identified monomeric and dimeric forms of GAAPs (Fig. 3, A and B, untreated lanes). Pretreatment of vGAAP with the reducing agent DTT caused a concentration-dependent loss of the band corresponding to dimeric GAAP and a concomitant increase in the monomeric band (Fig. 3A). DTT had no effect on the oligomerization of hGAAP (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that dimerization of vGAAP, but not of hGAAP, may require disulfide bonds between cysteines. Truncated forms of vGAAP and hGAAP containing either the N terminus and TMD1–4 (termed TMD1–4)"

Type IIA topoisomerases (Topo IIA) are essential enzymes that relax DNA supercoils and remove links joining replicated chromosomes. Human topoisomerase IIα (htopo IIα), one of two human isoforms, preferentially relaxes positive supercoils, a feature shared with Escherichia coli topoisomerase IV (Topo IV). The mechanistic basis of this chiral discrimination remains unresolved. To address this important issue, we measured the relaxation of individual supercoiled and ""braided"" DNA molecules by htopo IIα using a magnetic tweezers-based single-molecule assay. Our study confirmed the chiral discrimination activity of htopo IIα and revealed that the strand passage rate depends on DNA twist, tension on the DNA, and the C-terminal domain (CTD). Similar to Topo IV, chiral discrimination by htopo IIα results from chiral interactions of the CTDs with DNA writhe. In contrast to Topo IV, however, these interactions lead to chiral differences in relaxation rate rather than processivity. Increasing tension or twist disrupts the CTD-DNA interactions with a subsequent loss of chiral discrimination. Together, these results suggest that transfer segment (T-segment) capture is the rate-limiting step in the strand passage cycle. We propose a model for T-segment capture that provides a mechanistic basis for chiral discrimination and provides a coherent explanation for the effects of DNA twist and tension on eukaryotic type IIA topoisomerases."
https://openalex.org/W1977754999,"The advent of the ocular and nervous system in metazoan evolution coincides with the diversification of a single ancestral paired box (Pax) gene into Pax6, Pax6(5a), and Pax2. To investigate the role of these Pax genes in neural development, we have generated an allelic series of knock-in models at the Pax6 locus. We showed that although Pax6(5a) and Pax2 could not replace Pax6 for its autoregulation in lens induction or for neural differentiation in retina, Pax6(5a) was sufficient for corneal-lenticular detachment. In brain development, cell proliferation in the cerebral cortex and dorsoventral patterning of the telencephalon and neural tube were partially rescued in either knock-in mutant. Contrary to the previous belief, our genetic studies showed that the Pax6 isoform Pax6(5a) could potentially play a role in neuronal differentiation in brain development. Importantly, Pax2 showed greater rescue efficiency than Pax6(5a) in the telencephalon even though the latter was identical to Pax6 outside the paired domain. In studying Ngn2, a Pax6 direct target gene in telencephalon, we showed that the level of Ngn2 expression correlated with the in vitro binding of Pax2, Pax6, and Pax6(5a) paired domain on its enhancer. Our results show that Pax6 is uniquely required for eye development, but in brain development, Pax6 can be functionally substituted by related Pax family genes that share a similar paired domain binding specificity."

Biochemical properties of recombinant SUN proteins were elucidated.Both Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus sun proteins show a β-(1,3)-glucanase activity.The mode of action of SUN proteins on β-(1,3)-glucan is unique, new, and original. In yeasts, the family of SUN proteins has been involved in cell wall biogenesis. Here, we report the characterization of SUN proteins in a filamentous fungus, Aspergillus fumigatus. The function of the two A. fumigatus SUN genes was investigated by combining reverse genetics and biochemistry. During conidial swelling and mycelial growth, the expression of AfSUN1 was strongly induced, whereas the expression of AfSUN2 was not detectable. Deletion of AfSUN1 negatively affected hyphal growth and conidiation. A closer examination of the morphological defects revealed swollen hyphae, leaky tips, intrahyphal growth, and double cell wall, suggesting that, like in yeast, AfSun1p is associated with cell wall biogenesis. In contrast to AfSUN1, deletion of AfSUN2 either in the parental strain or in the AfSUN1 single mutant strain did not affect colony and hyphal morphology. Biochemical characterization of the recombinant AfSun1p and Candida albicans Sun41p showed that both proteins had a unique hydrolysis pattern: acting on β-(1,3)-oligomers from dimer up to insoluble β-(1,3)-glucan. Referring to the CAZy database, it is clear that fungal SUN proteins represent a new family of glucan hydrolases (GH132) and play an important morphogenetic role in fungal cell wall biogenesis and septation."
https://openalex.org/W1964501470,"T-type Ca(2+) channel inhibitors protect hippocampal CA1 neurons from delayed death after global ischemia in rats, suggesting that Cav3.1, Cav3.2, or Cav3.3 channels generate cytotoxic Ca(2+) elevations during anoxia. To test this hypothesis, we measured the Ca(2+) concentration changes evoked by oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in the cytosol and in the mitochondria of PC12 cells. OGD evoked long-lasting cytosolic Ca(2+) elevations that were reduced by Cav3.2 inhibition (50 μm Ni(2+)) and Cav3.1/Cav3.2 silencing and potentiated by Cav3.2 overexpression. The kinetics of the sustained cytosolic Ca(2+) elevations occurring during OGD directly correlated to the extent of cell death measured 20 h after reoxygenation, which was decreased by Ni(2+) and Cav3.1/Cav3.2 silencing and increased by Cav3.2 overexpression. Ni(2+) and Cav3.1/Cav3.2 silencing delayed the decline of cellular ATP during OGD, consistent with a reduction in the Ca(2+) load actively extruded by plasma membrane Ca(2+) pumps. The cytosolic Ca(2+) elevations were paralleled by mitochondrial Ca(2+) elevations that were also increased by Cav3.2 overexpression and decreased by Ni(2+) but not by Cav3.1/Cav3.2 silencing. Overexpression and silencing of the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter, the major mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake protein, revealed that the cytotoxicity was correlated to the amplitude of the mitochondrial, rather than the cytosolic, Ca(2+) elevations. Selective activation of T-type Ca(2+) channels evoked both cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca(2+) elevations, but only the mitochondrial responses were reduced by Cav3.1/Cav3.2 silencing. We conclude that the opening of Cav3.2 channels during ischemia contribute to the entry of Ca(2+) ions that are transmitted to mitochondria, resulting in a deleterious mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload."
https://openalex.org/W2016816104,"Potassium channel functions are often deciphered by using selective and potent scorpion toxins. Among these toxins, only a limited subset is capable of selectively blocking small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels. The structural bases of this selective SK channel recognition remain unclear. In this work, we demonstrate the key role of the electric charges of two conserved arginine residues (Arg-485 and Arg-489) from the SK3 channel outer vestibule in the selective recognition by the SK3-blocking BmP05 toxin. Indeed, individually substituting these residues with histidyl or lysyl (maintaining the positive electric charge partially or fully), although decreasing BmP05 affinity, still preserved the toxin sensitivity profile of the SK3 channel (as evidenced by the lack of recognition by many other types of potassium channel-sensitive charybdotoxin). In contrast, when Arg-485 or Arg-489 of the SK3 channel was mutated to an acidic (Glu) or alcoholic (Ser) amino acid residue, the channel lost its sensitivity to BmP05 and became susceptible to the “new” blocking activity by charybdotoxin. In addition to these SK3 channel basic residues important for sensitivity, two acidic residues, Asp-492 and Asp-518, also located in the SK3 channel outer vestibule, were identified as being critical for toxin affinity. Furthermore, molecular modeling data indicate the existence of a compact SK3 channel turret conformation (like a peptide screener), where the basic rings of Arg-485 and Arg-489 are stabilized by strong ionic interactions with Asp-492 and Asp-518.

With ∼100 members, the potassium channel family serves a variety of physiological functions and is involved in various channelopathies (1Ashcroft F.M. From molecule to malady.Nature. 2006; 440: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Based on their activation mode and number of transmembrane segments, these channels can be classified according to four main structural types: (i) inwardly rectifying two-transmembrane K+ channels (Kir), (ii) two-pore K+ channels with four transmembrane segments (K2P), (iii) Ca2+-activated K+ channels with six or seven transmembrane segments (KCa), and (iv) voltage-gated K+ channels with six transmembrane segments (Kv). Scorpion toxins are widely used to distinguish between these potassium channel types (2Gross A. MacKinnon R.

In two crystal structures of eukaryotic Kv1.2 and Kir2.2 channels, significant structural differences can be observed in the extracellular pore entryway, including turrets and filter regions, which are responsible for channel inactivation, toxin recognition, and interactions between channel subunits (Fig. 1). In contrast to the Kv1.2 extracellular pore entryway structure, the large turret and unusual TIGYGLR sequence in the filter region of Kir2.2 are responsible for its relative insensitivity to K+ channel toxins (6Long S.B.

SK channels are efficiently blocked by several scorpion toxins, including BmP05, scyllatoxin, and P05, but are insensitive to many others (17Rodríguez de la Vega R.C. Possani L.D.

Very few reports have investigated the structural features that underlie the specific recognition of SK channels by a restricted set of scorpion toxins. According to these studies, SK channel blockade would occur according to an “intermediate” mode of interaction (19Rodríguez de la Vega R.C. Merino E. Becerril B. Possani L.D.

Two arginyl residues found in an RRCQ motif present in both P05 and apamin are critical for P05 interaction with its target, as described for apamin (23Sabatier J.M. Zerrouk H. Darbon H. Mabrouk K.

In contrast, the β-sheet structure appears to be important for a “pore-blocking” mode as far as Kv channel block is concerned (19Rodríguez de la Vega R.C. Merino E. Becerril B. Possani L.D.

This distinctive mode of operation between SK channel-blocking and Kv channel-blocking toxins may be reconsidered taking into account the current state of knowledge of toxin interaction and computer-based simulation of toxin docking. Indeed, earlier studies were conducted based on less efficient docking simulations, and evidence is now increasing that the mode of toxin interaction with potassium channels may be switchable. In addition, channel turrets seem to play an important role in toxin docking. SK channel turret acidic residues were found to be involved in toxin binding in the intermediate mode (22Andreotti N. di Luccio E. Sampieri F. De Waard M. Sabatier J.M.

Evidence has been provided that SK channel block by a maurotoxin-Heterometrus spinifer toxin-1 chimera is dependent on ionic strength (27Shakkottai V.G. Regaya I. Wulff H. Fajloun Z. Tomita H.

Maurotoxin: a potent inhibitor of intermediate conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channels.Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), suggesting that SK channel recognition by scorpion toxins involves some electrostatic charges. Acidic amino acid residues of toxins were found to affect the interaction modes, further strengthening the importance of electrostatic interactions between toxins and channels (18Han S. Yin S. Yi H. Mouhat S. Qiu S. Cao Z. Sabatier J.M. Wu Y. Li W. Protein-protein recognition control by modulating electrostatic interactions.J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 3118-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Herein, we explored the importance of electrostatic repulsion for the interaction of the α-helical structure of BmP05 with the SK3 channel. Introducing positively charged residues within the α-helical structure of BmP05 decreased toxin affinity. After identification of key positively charged residues of the SK3 channel turret (two conserved arginine residues at turret positions 485 and 489) and relevant mutations, we were able to render the SK3 channel sensitive to ChTX block by its β-sheet surface owing to its strong content of basic amino acid residues despite the fact that ChTX is pharmacologically unrelated to BmP05. Our data demonstrate that the mode of toxin/channel interaction can be altered by selective point mutations of the channel with the aid of appropriate computer-aided molecular simulations. We also show that the toxin sensitivity profile of SK3 channels is controlled by two conserved turret arginine residues that produce differential repulsive electrostatic forces with basic residues of scorpion toxins. These results further increase our understanding of the structural and functional diversity of potassium channel extracellular pore entryways and unlock the pharmacological potential of toxins. BmP05, its mutants, and ChTX were prepared according to a previously described procedure (29Han S. Yi H. Yin S.J. Chen Z.Y. Liu H. Cao Z.J. Wu Y.L. Li W.X. Structural basis of a potent peptide inhibitor designed for Kv1.3 channel, a therapeutic target of autoimmune disease.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19058-19065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The secondary structures of purified BmP05 and its mutants were measured by CD spectroscopy. Measurements were carried out in the UV range of 250–190 nm at 25 °C in water on a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter with a 0.2–0.4 mg/ml concentration. For each peptide, spectra were collected from three separate recordings and averaged after subtracting the blank spectrum of pure water. The pEGFP-N1 plasmid containing the cDNAs for full-length human SK3 was kindly provided by Prof. Stephan Grissmer (University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany). Point mutations in SK3 were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and subsequently confirmed by DNA sequencing (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were transfected using FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) following the manufacturer's instructions and used for electrophysiology 24–48 h after transfection. Electrophysiological experiments were performed at 22–25 °C using the patch clamp whole cell recording mode. For the recording, the bath contained 130 mm sodium aspartate, 30 mm potassium aspartate, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). The pipette solution contained 145 mm potassium aspartate, 8.7 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH) to achieve an intracellular free Ca2+ concentration of 1 μm. The membrane potentials were clamped to −120 mV for 50 ms (which was used for the current measurements) followed by a 400-ms voltage ramp from −120 to +60 mV and were kept for 5 s between ramps at −40 mV using a HEKA EPC 10 amplifier with Patchmaster data acquisition software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Data analyses were performed with IGOR software (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). IC50 values were obtained by fitting a modified Hill equation to the data as shown in Equation 1, ltoxin/lcontrol=1/(1+([toxin peptide]/IC50)(Eq. 1) where I is the stable current at −120 mV for the normalized data points obtained with at least four different toxin peptide concentrations. Results are shown as the mean ± S.E. of at least three experiments. The spatial structure of the pore region except for the turret of the SK3 channel was modeled using the crystallographic structure of the KcsA channel (Protein Data Bank code 1BL8) as a template with the SWISS-MODEL server (30Guex N. Peitsch M.C. SWISS-MODEL and the Swiss-PdbViewer: an environment for comparative protein modeling.Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9561) Google Scholar). The turret of SK3 was built using the segment assembly homology modeling method as described previously (8Yi H. Cao Z. Yin S. Dai C. Wu Y. Li W.

Chem. 2008; 283: 24177-24184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). An additional unrestrained molecular dynamics simulation was performed on the model to obtain an equilibrated SK3 structure. The structure of BmP05 was modeled by using the atomic coordinates of the highly homologous scorpion toxin scyllatoxin (Protein Data Bank code 1SCY). BmP05 was docked onto the equilibrated SK3 structure using the ZDOCK program (31Chen R. Li L. Weng Z. ZDOCK: an initial-stage protein-docking algorithm.Proteins. 2003; 52: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Clustering analysis and experimental data-based screening were used to screen possible hits from the resulting complexes. These were then subjected to further molecular dynamics simulation to evaluate their stability and reasonability. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the AMBER 11 program on the 128-CPU Dawning TC5000 cluster. The ff99 force field (parm99) (32Wang J. Cieplak P. Kollman P.A. How well does a restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) model perform in calculating conformational energies of organic and biological molecules?.J. Comput. Chem. 2000; 21: 1049-1074Crossref Scopus (3494) Google Scholar) was applied throughout all of the simulation steps. Both the SK3 channel and BmP05-SK3 complex structures were subjected to unrestrained simulations in explicit solvent systems. The SK3 channel and the BmP05-SK3 complex were first embedded in a periodic box of 71.755 × 79.440 × 79.589 Å and 74.141 × 80.972 × 81.867 Å. A 5-ns pre-equilibration followed by a 10-ns unrestrained simulation was performed on the channel and the complex using the SANDER module in the AMBER 11 program to obtain sufficient stable conformations. The pre-equilibration steps were taken by gradually reducing the force constant from 5.0 kcal/mol/Å2 for restraining all of the heavy atoms to 0.02 kcal/mol/Å2 for backbone heavy atoms only. The temperature was set at 300 K with a cutoff distance of 10 Å. As shown, the SK3 channels were almost insensitive to a 100 nm concentration of many types of the potassium channel-active ChTX toxin (Fig. 2A) or the Kv channel-active ADWX-1 peptide (Fig. 2B) (29Han S. Yi H. Yin S.J. Chen Z.Y. Liu H. Cao Z.J. Wu Y.L. Li W.X. Structural basis of a potent peptide inhibitor designed for Kv1.3 channel, a therapeutic target of autoimmune disease.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19058-19065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In contrast, 100 nm BmP05 inhibited ∼80% of the SK3 channel current (Fig. 2C). The corresponding IC50 for of BmP05-induced current block is 3.8 nm (Fig. 2D). Structurally, there are four basic amino acid residues in the vicinity of the pore-blocking basic residue Lys-27 of ChTX or Lys-26 of ADWX-1 (Fig. 2, E and F). In contrast, the channel-binding interface of BmP05 or scyllatoxin presents only three (Fig. 2G) or two (Fig. 2H) basic residues (33Wu J.J. He L.L. Zhou Z. Chi C.W. Gene expression, mutation, and structure-function relationship of scorpion toxin BmP05 active on SKCa channels.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2844-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 34Pease J.H. Wemmer D.E. Solution structure of apamin determined by nuclear magnetic resonance and distance geometry.Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8491-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These structural differences in channel-binding interfaces suggest that the SK3 channel may be selectively recognized by scorpion toxins possessing three (or fewer) basic residues in these critical positions. To further characterize the BmP05 channel-binding interface, we tested the effect of adding extra basic residue(s) on its ability to recognize the SK3 channel (Fig. 3A). Compared with the BmP05 peptide, the CD spectra of four mutants showed no significant changes in the secondary structure (Fig. 3B), indicating that BmP05 and its mutant peptides all adopted the same overall structural topology. Functionally, increasing the number of basic residues by one (at BmP05 position 14 or 15) or two (at BmP05 positions 4 and 14 or positions 4 and 15) arginyl residues strongly reduced its inhibitory potency at 100 nm on SK3 currents (Fig. 3, C–F). This decreased potency was stronger when two extra arginyl residues were incorporated into the BmP05 channel-binding interface (BmP05-N4R/S14R and BmP05-N4R/L15R) instead of a single residue (BmP05-S14R and BmP05-L15R) (Fig. 3, E and F versus C and D). From these data, it appears that an efficient block of the SK3 channel by BmP05 occurs when three basic residues are located in the channel-binding interface of the toxin. The sensitivity of BmP05 to the presence of extra basic amino acid residues in its binding interface strongly suggests the important role of electrostatic repulsion forces between the BmP05 channel-binding interface and the SK3 channel binding site. These electrostatic repulsion forces might occur with Arg-485 and Arg-489, two highly conserved basic residues that are located in the outer vestibules of all SK channel subtypes (Fig. 1). These electrostatic repulsion forces, if actually existing, can be diminished by replacing the wild-type Arg-485 or Arg-489 residue of the SK3 channel with less basic lysyl (SK3-R485K and SK3-R489K) or histidyl (SK3-R485H and SK3-R489H) residues. The resulting mutant channels were still insensitive to 100 nm ChTX (Fig. 4, A, B, E, and F) but maintained their sensitivity to 100 nm BmP05 (Fig. 4, C, D, G, and H), albeit at reduced levels. The degree of reduction in the BmP05 effect was assessed by dose-response analyses, and the results indicate affinity reductions of the mutant channels for BmP05 by 88-fold (SK3-R485H), 101-fold (SK3-R489H), 38-fold (SK3-R485K), and 51-fold (SK3-R489K) (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4, I and J). The reduction in affinity was higher for the Arg-to-His mutations, as expected from the less basic nature of the histidyl residue. The basic nature of the amino acid residues at SK3 positions 485 and 489 (e.g. Arg, Lys, or His) is key to maintaining the BmP05/ChTX selectivity for the SK3 channel, whereas the presence of arginyl residues at these positions is mandatory for maintaining high BmP05 affinity. An additional step in weakening the electrostatic repulsion forces at the toxin/channel binding interface is to substitute the SK3 channel dyad of arginyl with acidic or polar amino acid residues. This was achieved by replacing Arg-485 or Arg-489 with a glutamic acid (acidic) or serine (polar) residue in the SK3 channel. In agreement with the importance of Arg-485 and Arg-489 in the high affinity of BmP05 for the SK3 channel, 100 nm BmP05 produced much less inhibition of the SK3-R485E (Fig. 5A), SK3-R489E (Fig. 5B), SK3-R485S (Fig. 5E), and SK3-R489S (Fig. 5F) mutant channels compared with the inhibition observed for the wild-type SK3 channel (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2, C and D). The electrically neutral serine residue was less prone to altering the electrostatic balance at the toxin/channel binding interface than the glutamic acid residue. This is consistent with the stronger current blocks of the SK3-R485S and SK3-R489S mutant channels by BmP05 compared with the current blocks of the SK3-R485E and SK3-R489E mutants. These data indicate that substitutions at positions 485 and 489 in the SK3 channel are sufficient to make the channel almost insensitive to BmP05, further strengthening the idea that these SK3 channel positions are key to toxin recognition. Interestingly, the potassium currents carried by all tested mutant channels were significantly blocked by 100 nm ChTX compared with wild-type SK3 channels (p < 0.05) (Figs. 2A and 5, C, D, G, and H). Dose-response analyses provided IC50 values for ChTX-induced current blocks of 381 nm (SK3-R485E), 110 nm (SK3-R489E), 84 nm (SK3-R485S), and 30 nm (SK3-R489S) (Fig. 5, I and J). These data are remarkable in the sense that a toxin, ChTX, known to block only Kv, BK, and intermediate conductance calcium-activated K+ (IK) channels, can gain a novel activity for the SK3 channel if the latter is appropriately mutated at position 485 or 489. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that, in this case, the appropriate mutations of the SK3 channel allow the channel to invert its pharmacological toxin sensitivity recognition profile from a BmP05-sensitive and ChTX-insensitive profile for the wild-type SK3 channel to a BmP05-insensitive and ChTX-sensitive profile for the appropriately mutated SK3 channel. Interestingly, these mutant SK3 channels acquire a pharmacological toxin sensitivity profile that resembles that of Kv channels, which are also BmP05-insensitive (18Han S. Yin S. Yi H. Mouhat S. Qiu S. Cao Z. Sabatier J.M. Wu Y. Li W. Protein-protein recognition control by modulating electrostatic interactions.J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 3118-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and ChTX-sensitive. Besides the dyad of arginyl residues (Arg-485 and Arg-489), we also investigated the effects of mutating other residues from the outer vestibule of the SK3 channel on its toxin sensitivity profile. Many mutant SK3 channels were found to be inactive (SK3-E488A, SK3-E488N, SK3-Y490A, SK3-H491A, SK3-D492A, SK3-D495A, and SK3-D518A) and could not be investigated regarding this issue. However, five additional mutations (SK3-D492N, SK3-Q493A, SK3-D495N, SK3-D518N, and SK3-H522A) provided functional channels that could be characterized for their BmP05 and ChTX current blocks (Fig. 6, A–E). Two channels (SK3-D492N and SK3-D518N) were significantly less sensitive to BmP05 compared with wild-type SK3 channels (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6, A, D, and K), whereas three others (SK3-Q493A, SK3-D495N, and SK3-H522A) maintained an efficient BmP05 block compared with wild-type SK3 channels (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6, B, C, E, and K). Experimental IC50 values for the latter channel mutants were 16 nm (SK3-Q493A), 17 nm (SK3-D495N), and 82 nm (SK3-H522A) (data not shown). All SK3 channel mutants maintained the toxin sensitivity profile because none of the currents carried by these channels could be efficiently blocked by 100 nm ChTX (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6, F–J and L). These data clearly highlight the particular contribution of the arginyl dyad of the SK3 channel outer vestibule in defining its selective recognition by toxins. Extracellular pore entryways are structurally important elements of potassium channels. They are involved in several functions, including channel inactivation, subunit interactions, and channel pharmacology. Due to the difficulties in solving potassium channel crystal structures (6Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R.

In addition, significant conformational rearrangements in the toxin/channel recognition surfaces have been investigated and/or evidenced by computational simulation techniques (8Yi H. Cao Z. Yin S.

Herein, we investigated the SK3 channel structural determinants that are involved in the selective recognition by scorpion toxins by using BmP05 and ChTX as molecular probes. Our results point to the importance of a basic dyad, comprising the conserved Arg-485 and Arg-489 residues of the SK channel turret, as a critical structural determinant in defining the efficacy whereby the SK3 channel preferentially recognizes BmP05 over ChTX. Two questions deserve further attention. First, how does this dyad of SK3 residues impair the recognition of scorpion toxins such as ChTX? Second, how does the dyad influence the affinity/potency of SK3 channel-active toxins such as BmP05 for SK3 channels? In an attempt to solve these questions, we modeled the structures of both the SK3 channel alone and the BmP05-SK3 complex using molecular modeling techniques (8Yi H. Cao Z. Yin S. Dai C. Wu Y. Li W.

Chem. 2008; 283: 24177-24184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7 (A and B), the SK3 channel turret adopts a unique conformation in which both Arg-485 and Arg-489 form salt bridges with aspartic acid residues from adjacent SK3 subunits (Arg-485 with Asp-492; Arg-489 with both Asp-492 and Asp-518). These internal electrostatic interactions between the four channel turrets contribute to the formation of a narrow gateway together with the large ring (four Arg-485 residues) and small ring (four Arg-489 residues) of basic residues, as indicated by the structural superimposition of SK3 with the Kv1.2 and Kir2.2 structures (Fig. 8). These two rings of basic amino acid residues are conserved in the BmP05-SK3 complex structure (Fig. 7C). The unique structural properties (positions and interactions) of Arg-485 and Arg-489 (like a peptide screener) may account for the efficacy in governing scorpion toxin selectivity for the SK3 channel. As shown by the mutagenesis studies, the SK3 channel dyad of Arg-485 and Arg-489 is responsible for the toxin sensitivity of SK3 channels through differential electrostatic repulsion forces (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). To minimize such forces, Lys-6 of BmP05 blocks the channel pore (Fig. 7, C and D), similar to Lys-27 of ChTX or Lys-26 of ADWX-1 (11Gan G. Yi H. Chen M. Sun L. Li W. Wu Y. Ding J.

Arg-7 of BmP05 is located between two Arg-489 residues that form the small ring of basic residues, whereas Arg-13 of the toxin hangs just above the two rings of Arg-485 and Arg-489 (Fig. 7C). Obviously, toxins with a greater number of basic amino acid residues in the channel-interacting surface are unable to recognize the SK3 channel owing to stronger electrostatic repulsion forces between the toxin and basic rings of the arginine residues (as evidenced in FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). The toxin recognition profile of SK3 channels (sensitive to BmP05 and insensitive to ChTX) is maintained by basic amino acid substitutions of the arginyl dyad (Fig. 4) but inverted by acidic or polar amino acid residue replacements (Fig. 5). At the structural level, these results can be interpreted by the maintenance or disappearance of basic rings depending on the nature of residue substitutions, i.e. preserved if the dyad is mutated to basic amino acid residues and lost if acidic or polar residues are selected instead. In this respect, it is interesting to note that the loss of one of the two basic rings “drives” an SK3 channel toward a BK-type channel by rendering the modified SK3 channel insensitive to BmP05 (18Han S. Yin S. Yi H. Mouhat S. Qiu S. Cao Z. Sabatier J.M. Wu Y. Li W. Protein-protein recognition control by modulating electrostatic interactions.J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 3118-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and sensitive to ChTX. The functional and modeling data point to an exquisite role of the two conserved Arg-485 and Arg-489 residues as being essential determinants of the SK3 channel with regard to its recognition profile of toxins.FIGURE 8More compact conformation of the SK3 channel turret. A, superposition of the SK3 and rat Kv1.2 channels (Protein Data Bank code 2A79). B, superposition of the SK3 and rat Kir2.2 channels (code 3JYC). The SK3 channel is shown in green, the Kv1.2 channel is shown in pink, and the Kir2.2 channel is shown in red.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is worth emphasizing that the two conserved Arg-485 and Arg-489 residues of the SK3 channel are also essential for the potency of SK3-blocking toxins by maintaining the unique narrow gateway conformation of the channel turrets (Fig. 7, A and B), which are critical domains for scorpion toxin interactions (Fig. 7, E and F). The BmP05 affinity for the SK3 channel decreases significantly when these arginyl residues are replaced with less basic ones (Fig. 4). This may result in a looser conformation of the channel turrets as a consequence of weaker electrostatic interactions between the four SK3 channel subunits (Fig. 7, A and B). The looser turret structure presumably impairs the interactions of BmP05 Arg-7 and Arg-13 with the critical residues from the SK3 channel turrets (Fig. 7, E and F). The D492N or D518N mutation, conferring BmP05 insensitivity to modified SK3 channels (Fig. 6), also disrupts some key electrostatic interactions between channel subunits, thereby conferring looser turret structures (Fig. 7, A and B). These data strongly suggest that the potency of SK3-blocking scorpion toxins is dependent on the narrow gateway structure of the SK3 outer vestibule, itself constrained by the electrostatic interactions of Arg-485 and Arg-489 with acidic residues. In conclusion, this work describes the unique properties of two conserved SK3 channel Arg-485 and Arg-489 residues in controlling selective scorpion toxin recognition. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the selective recognition of SK channels by scorpion toxins. Undoubtedly, they provide structural and mechanistic insights for the design of selective peptide inhibitors specific to each subtype of SK channel. Indeed, subtype-specific SK channel blockers would be useful to treat neurological disorders more effectively (38Wulff H. Zhorov B.S.

Employing fluorescently tagged fusion proteins and laser microirradiation coupled with confocal microscopy, we observed that the endonuclease VIII-like DNA glycosylase, NEIL1, accumulates at sites of oxidative DNA damage, as well as trioxsalen (psoralen)-induced DNA interstrand crosslinks, but not to angelicin monoadducts. While recruitment to the oxidative DNA lesions was abrogated by the anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine, this treatment did not alter the accumulation of NEIL1 at sites of interstrand crosslinks, suggesting distinct recognition mechanisms. Consistent with this conclusion, recruitment of the NEIL1 population variants, G83D, C136R, and E181K, to oxidative DNA damage and psoralen-induced interstrand crosslinks was differentially affected by the mutation. NEIL1 recruitment to psoralen crosslinks was independent of the nucleotide excision repair recognition factor, XPC. Knockdown of NEIL1 in LN428 glioblastoma cells resulted in enhanced recruitment of XPC, a more rapid removal of digoxigenin-tagged psoralen adducts, and decreased cellular sensitivity to trioxsalen plus UVA, implying that NEIL1 and BER may interfere with normal cellular processing of interstrand crosslinks. While exhibiting no enzymatic activity, purified NEIL1 protein bound stably to psoralen interstrand crosslink-containing synthetic oligonucleotide substrates in vitro. Our results indicate that NEIL1 recognizes specifically and distinctly interstrand crosslinks in DNA, and can obstruct the efficient removal of lethal crosslink adducts.

Our results indicate that NEIL1 recognizes specifically and distinctly interstrand crosslinks in DNA, and can obstruct the efficient removal of lethal crosslink adducts. A wide spectrum of DNA damage is generated through spontaneous decomposition, reactions with endogenously produced chemical species, and direct or indirect interactions with various exogenous agents. Some of the most common forms of DNA damage include simple base alterations, abasic sites, and single-strand breaks (1Lindahl T. Instability and decay of the primary structure of DNA.Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4325) Google Scholar). More complex lesions, which are more typically associated with environmental or clinical DNA-damaging agents, include helix-distorting (bulky) base adducts, double-strand breaks, and intra or interstrand crosslinks (2Stone M.P. Huang H. Brown K.L. Shanmugam G. Chemistry and structural biology of DNA damage and biological consequences.Chem. Biodivers. 2011; 8: 1571-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To prevent the genotoxic and lethal consequences of DNA damage, organisms have evolved a series of distinct, albeit interconnected, DNA repair mechanisms (3Jackson S.P. Bartek J. The DNA-damage response in human biology and disease.Nature. 2009; 461: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (3828) Google Scholar). The base excision repair (BER) 2The abbreviations used are: BERbase excision repairNACN-acetylcysteineAPapurinic/apyrimidinicMPG3-methyladenine DNA glycosylaseUNGuracil DNA glycosylaseDAPIdiamidino-2-phenylindoledig-psodigoxigenin-labeled psoralen. pathway is the predominant system for coping with spontaneous hydrolytic, oxidative, and alkylative DNA modifications (4Wilson 3rd, D.M. Bohr V.A. The mechanics of base excision repair, and its relationship to aging and disease.DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 544-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Such lesions include uracil, 8-oxoguanine, 3-methyladenine, apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites, and a variety of DNA single-strand break ends. Classic BER involves substrate base removal by a DNA glycosylase, incision at the resulting abasic site by an AP endonuclease, gap-filling by a DNA polymerase and sealing of the remaining nick by a DNA ligase. Although BER has traditionally been thought to recognize lesions that have little impact on overall DNA structure, recent evidence has implicated a direct involvement of BER in the processing of interstrand crosslinks (5Wilson 3rd, D.M. Seidman M.M. A novel link to base excision repair?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 247-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This damage involves the covalent linkage of the two complementary strands of DNA, thereby preventing strand separation that is required for events such as transcription and replication. Thus, interstrand crosslinks are highly toxic DNA modifications, which can promote genomic instability (6Muniandy P.A. Liu J. Majumdar A. Liu S.T. Seidman M.M. DNA interstrand crosslink repair in mammalian cells: step by step.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2010; 45: 23-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). base excision repair N-acetylcysteine apurinic/apyrimidinic 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase uracil DNA glycosylase diamidino-2-phenylindole digoxigenin-labeled psoralen. Some of the early data that suggested a role for BER factors in the removal of DNA lesions formed by crosslinking agents includes the mild hypersensitivities reported for homozygous 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase (MPG)-deficient mouse cells to bis-chloroethylnitrosourea and mitomycin C (7Engelward B.P. Dreslin A. Christensen J. Huszar D. Kurahara C. Samson L.

Mammalian 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase protects against the toxicity and clastogenicity of certain chemotherapeutic DNA cross-linking agents.Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3965-3973PubMed Google Scholar). Whether or not this increased sensitivity was the result of impaired removal of interstrand crosslinks or one of the many monoadducts formed by these compounds, however, was not determined. More recent data from the Samson laboratory indicate that MPG (also known as AAG) is important for resistance of mouse embryonic stem cells to psoralen-induced interstrand crosslinks, but not angelicin-induced monoadducts, although the exact molecular process that engages MPG has not been elucidated (9Maor-Shoshani A. Meira L.B. Yang X. Samson L.D. 3-Methyladenine DNA glycosylase is important for cellular resistance to psoralen interstrand cross-links.DNA Repair. 2008; 7: 1399-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In a separate study, Saparbaev and co-workers found that the human DNA glycosylase, endonuclease VIII-like 1 (NEIL1), excises psoralen-induced monoadducts in duplex DNA, initiating a classic BER response involving the AP endonuclease APE1 (10Couvé-Privat S. Macé G. Rosselli F. Saparbaev M.K. Psoralen-induced DNA adducts are substrates for the base excision repair pathway in human cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5672-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Consistently, HeLa cells depleted for NEIL1 or APE1 were shown to be hypersensitive to 8-methoxypsoralen (+UVA) exposure, a treatment scheme that creates a significant percentage of monoadduct products (10Couvé-Privat S. Macé G. Rosselli F. Saparbaev M.K. Psoralen-induced DNA adducts are substrates for the base excision repair pathway in human cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5672-5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 11Lai C. Cao H.

Chem. 2008; 80: 8790-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). More recently, Saparbaev and co-workers found that NEIL1 can also excise an unhooked interstrand crosslink remnant within a synthetic three-stranded DNA structure, catalyzing a classic BER reaction in vitro (12Couvé S. Macé-Aimé G. Rosselli F. Saparbaev M.K. The human oxidative DNA glycosylase NEIL1 excises psoralen-induced interstrand DNA cross-links in a three-stranded DNA structure.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11963-11970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These data imply multiple routes of entry for NEIL1 in the psoralen crosslink response. Unlike the above work, which suggested a role for BER components in the repair of crosslink adducts, Patrick and co-workers found that cells deficient in BER display a cisplatin-resistant phenotype, which is accompanied by enhanced excision of cisplatin-induced interstrand crosslinks (13Kothandapani A. Dangeti V.S. Brown A.R. Banze L.A. Wang X.H. Sobol R.W. Patrick S.M. Novel role of base excision repair in mediating cisplatin cytotoxicity.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 14564-14574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In particular, they demonstrated that the region around a cisplatin interstrand crosslink is susceptible to increased spontaneous decay, namely cytosine deamination, due to a local structural distortion in the duplex. This physical and chemical feature of the crosslinked DNA results in a uracil-specific BER response, which would occur near the interstrand crosslink and thus interfere with the normal repair processes in vivo. Consistently, the authors found that cells defective in uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG), APE1, or POLβ function, key elements of an effective BER reaction, exhibit a cisplatin-specific resistant phenotype. Given the complex picture that is emerging regarding the role of BER in interstrand crosslink processing, we sought herein to better define the involvement of NEIL1 in the cellular response to trioxsalen (psoralen)-induced interstrand crosslinks. U2OS and HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA); mutant XPC15 and corrected XPC16 cell lines from Coriell Medical Institute (Camden, NJ); and NEIL1 knockdown and control LN428 cell lines from Trevigen (Gaithersburg, MD). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM) was acquired from Invitrogen Corporation (Carlsbad, CA). Vectorshield Hard Set mounting medium was obtained from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA), and trioxsalen, angelicin, and N-acetylcysteine were from Sigma, Aldrich. The chemical design and characterization of digoxigenin-tagged trimethylpsoralen (dig-pso) has been described previously (14Thazhathveetil A.K. Liu S.T. Indig F.E. Seidman M.M. Psoralen conjugates for visualization of genomic interstrand cross-links localized by laser photoactivation.Bioconjug. Chem. 2007; 18: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To generate the C-terminal fluorescently-tagged NEIL1 expression construct, the NEIL1 coding region was PCR amplified in 4% DMSO using the Hercules II Fusion Enzyme according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Stratagene, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) with primers 5HNEIL1 (5′-CCCCAAGCTTGCCACCATGCCTGAGGGCCCCGAGCT-3′) and 3ENEIL1 (5′-CGGAATTCCAGAGGCTGAGGTCCCCTCTGGT-3′), and a cDNA template obtained from Origene (Rockville, MD; catalogue no. SC123674). The PCR product was digested accordingly and subcloned into the HindIII and EcoR1 restriction sites of either pmCherry-N1 or pAcGFP1-N1 (Clontech). Nucleotide substitutions were introduced into the WT pAcGFP-NEIL1 plasmid using the QuikChange II XL Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to create the G83D, C136R, and E181K variant GFP-fusion constructs. HeLa, U2OS, XPC15 mutant, or XPC16 complemented cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% glutamate at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. The designated plasmid was transfected into 200,000 cells, which had been adhered for 24 h to a 35-mm glass bottom culture dish with a 10-mm microwell (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA), using the Dreamfect reagent according to the manufacturer's standard protocol (OZ Biosciences, Marseille, France). In brief, 1 μg of plasmid was combined with the Dreamfect reagent and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. After this time, the mixture was added to the adhered cells for 4 h and then removed. Cells were incubated for 48 h under standard culture conditions and used to determine the intracellular localization or recruitment dynamics of the specified fluorescently tagged fusion protein. With the LN428 cell lines, an identical procedure (see above) was employed using a pEGFP-N3 vector that harbors full-length XPC (15Hoogstraten D. Bergink S. Ng J.M. Verbiest V.H. Luijsterburg M.S. Geverts B. Raams A. Dinant C. Hoeijmakers J.H. Vermeulen W. Houtsmuller A.B. Versatile DNA damage detection by the global genome nucleotide excision repair protein XPC.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 2850-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). HeLa or U2OS cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid using the approach outlined above in slide chambers. 48 h post-transfection, the medium was removed, and cells were sealed under a glass coverslip with 50 μl of Vectorshield Hard Set mounting medium with diamidino-2-phenylindole dye (DAPI). The slides were allowed to harden overnight at 4 °C, and were viewed using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-E microscope equipped with a CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Tokyo, Japan) and various fluorescence modules. Velocity software (Improvision, PerkinElmer, Coventry, England) was used to capture and process images. All images were acquired using identical gain, exposure, sensitivity, and contrast settings. Localized microirradiation was performed using the Nikon Eclipse TE2000-E microscope set-up described above, a SRS NL100 nitrogen pumped dye laser with Micropoint ablation system (Photonics Instruments, St. Charles, IL) adjusted via passage through a dye to generate a wavelength of 365 nm, and a CSU10 spinning disk system (Yokogawa, Japan). Laser power was attenuated in terms of percent intensity using Velocity software (see above). In particular, a defined laser intensity was directed to deliver pulses to a delineated rectangular region of interest (94 × 20 pixels, 0.16 μm/pixel) using a Plan Fluor ×60/1.25 numerical aperture oil objective. Galvanometer-driven beam displacers oriented the laser beam, which fired randomly throughout the region until complete exposure was obtained; 300 nm was used for the diffraction limited spot size. The laser fires 3-ns pulses with a 10 Hz repetition rate with a power of 0.7 nanowatts, measured at the back aperture of the ×60 objective at 365 nm. A setting of 1.7% (for psoralen) and 2.2% (for angelicin) was used to create interstrand crosslinks or monoadducts in the targeted region. A setting of 2.7% was used to create free radical induced single strand breaks (16Muniandy P.A. Thapa D. Thazhathveetil A.K. Liu S.T. Seidman M.M. Repair of laser-localized DNA interstrand cross-links in G1 phase mammalian cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 27908-27917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). 30 min prior to the experiment, cells (as indicated) were treated either with 5 μm psoralen (30 min at 37 °C), 40 μm angelicin (30 min at 37 °C), or not at all. Throughout the experiment, adhered cells were maintained at 80% humidity, 5% CO2, and 37 °C using a live cell environmental chamber or CO2 enhancement workhead (Slonet Scientific, Segensworth, UK). Live cells were subjected to site directed laser damage at various intensities (see above). The data were analyzed using the Velocity software listed above and “region of interest fluorescent intensity” was photographically recorded as specified. All images were acquired using identical gain, exposure, sensitivity, and contrast settings. To examine the effects of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), repair proficient HeLa cells were transfected with the pAcGFP-NEIL1 plasmid (see above) and cultured for an additional 48 h. NAC was then added to the media at a final concentration of 6 mm, and where indicated, psoralen was added 30 min prior to laser microirradiation. The cells were subsequently microirradiated at either 2.7% alone or 1.7% in the presence of psoralen. As described above, live cells were subjected to site directed laser damage and subsequent recruitment (or lack thereof) was photographically recorded. The data were analyzed, and the images were acquired as detailed above. Control and NEIL1 knockdown LN428 cell lines (Trevigen) were cultured in DMEM. Once cells reached 80% confluence, they were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were frozen at −80 °C for 1 h prior to extract preparation. Cells were re-suspended in 1 ml lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm PMSF) and sonicated. Following centrifugation, a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) was run to determine the protein concentration of the supernatant (whole cell extract). 30 μg of each extract was separated on a Nupage MOPS gel (Invitrogen), and the protein was transferred to a 0.2 μm PVDF membrane (Invitrogen) using standard blotting procedures. Anti-NEIL1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) was used as the primary antibody, followed by goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce Biotechnology). Detection was carried out using a Pierce Super signal kit. β-Actin levels were determined on the same blot to ensure equal loading of whole cell extracts using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and the same goat anti-rabbit secondary as above. Blots were exposed to film, and all data were analyzed using ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare). Control and NEIL1 knockdown LN428 cell lines (Trevigen) were grown to confluence, trypsinized and counted, and 100 cells were then transferred to each well of a 6-well plate. Treatments were carried out at the designated concentrations of trioxsalen (plus UVA light using a UVA Rayonet box from Southern New England Ultraviolet Company (Branford, CT)) as outlined previously (16Muniandy P.A. Thapa D. Thazhathveetil A.K. Liu S.T. Seidman M.M. Repair of laser-localized DNA interstrand cross-links in G1 phase mammalian cells.J. Biol.

Cells were then gently washed twice with 1× PBS, and incubated for 10 days with fresh DMEM to allow individual colonies to form. Colonies were stained with methylene blue and counted, and the percent survival determined relative to the untreated control. Control and NEIL1 knockdown cells (Trevigen) were seeded (2 × 105) in a 35-mm glass bottom culture dish for 24 h. These cells were treated with 20 μm dig-pso and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min prior to laser treatment at 1.7% intensity (14Thazhathveetil A.K. Liu S.T. Indig F.E. Seidman M.M.

After the laser treatment, cells were fixed either immediately or at the indicated time point in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, 1% BSA, 100 mm glycine, and 0.2 mg/ml EDTA in PBS on ice for 10 min, and subsequently digested with RNase A. Cells were blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS with 0.01% sodium azide for 1 h at 37 °C. Immunofluorescence staining using a primary digoxigenin antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and γH2AX antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was carried out. Secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor goat anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes)) were used for visualization. Approximately 20–25 cells were visualized for each time point. Mean Intensity of dig-pso from each cell at the damage site was measured (Velocity 6.01 version, Perkin Elmer) and corrected for background with background intensity from undamaged site of that respective cell. The oligonucleotides used to create the different DNA substrates were synthesized and gel purified by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (San Jose, CA): 34–5OHC, CTGCAGCTGATGCGC[5OHC]GTACGGATCCCCGGGTAC; 34G, GTACCCGGGGATCCGTACGGCGCATCAGCTGCAG; D21, CCGCGGCGTACCGGCCGCGGC; and C21, TTGCCGCGGCCGGTACGCCGCGG. To generate the interstrand crosslink-containing duplex (D21/C21 ICL), 5 nmol of each D21 and C21 were annealed in TE buffer, and this 5 μm DNA solution was then incubated with 50 μm 4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralen for 1 h in the dark in 5 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, and 0.2 mm EDTA. This mixture was subsequently irradiated for 20 min with UVA light (365 nm) on ice. The irradiated samples were purified over a DIONEX DNAPac ion exchange column on a Shimadzu HPLC system (LC-10ADvp) with a dual wavelength detector (SPD-10ADvp) and an auto injector (SIL-10AVvp). A solution of 25 mm NaOH (mobile phase A) and 1 m NaCl in 25 mm NaOH (mobile phase B) was used for separation of uncrosslinked and crosslinked DNA. A gradient of 2 min 10–50% B, 20 min 50–90% B, and 21 min 90–100% B was employed with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The fractions were immediately neutralized after collection by the addition of Tris buffer, pH 7.4. The fractions containing the interstrand crosslinked DNA were pooled and desalted by dialysis in water in a 2,000 molecular weight cutoff cassette (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) at 4 °C overnight and concentrated in a Speed-vac concentrator. The D21/C21 ICL substrate was 5′ end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) using a standard protocol. For the 5-hydroxycytosine (5OHC) positive control substrate, the damage-containing strand was 5′ end-labeled prior to annealing to the cold complementary 34G strand. For the D21/C21 duplex that did not contain the site-specific interstrand crosslink, the C21 strand was radiolabeled prior to annealing to the complementary D21 oligonucleotide. To monitor NEIL1 glycosylase and AP lyase activities, human NEIL1 protein (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) was added to a reaction mixture at the indicated amounts with 1 pmol of the appropriate oligonucleotide substrate in 10 μl of 1× endonuclease VIII buffer (New England Biolabs). After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of formamide loading buffer (95% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, bromphenol blue, and xylene cyanol) and heated to 90 °C for 10 min followed by incubation on ice for 3 min. The reactions were then resolved on a 20% polyacrylamide denaturing urea gel (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) at 250 mV for 2.5 h. The gel was exposed to a phosphor screen (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA), which was subsequently imaged on a GE Healthcare Typhoon Trio+ Variable Mode Imager. To assess stable DNA binding, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed by incubating NEIL1 protein (New England Biolabs) at 7.5, 22.5, or 75 ng with 100 fmol of the appropriate labeled substrate in a 10 μl volume of 70 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 5% glycerol. Following incubation for 15 min on ice, binding reactions were resolved on an 8% polyacrylamide non-denaturing gel in TBE at 100 V for 120 min. The gel was exposed and imaged as above, and all data were analyzed using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). As a means of evaluating the role of DNA repair proteins in an interstrand crosslink response, we have employed a strategy whereby we transiently express fluorescent-tagged fusion proteins in human cells and monitor their recruitment dynamics to and retention time at specified sites of laser-induced DNA damage. In these experiments, photoactivated trioxsalen (psoralen) is used as the interstrand crosslinking agent, and angelicin is used as a control to generate monoadducts exclusively (Ref. 16Muniandy P.A. Thapa D. Thazhathveetil A.K. Liu S.T. Seidman M.M. Repair of laser-localized DNA interstrand cross-links in G1 phase mammalian cells.J. Biol.

Our studies herein focus on the NEIL1 DNA glycosylase, since this protein has been previously shown to play multiple roles in interstrand crosslink repair (10Couvé-Privat S. Macé G. Rosselli F.

When transiently expressed in human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells, NEIL1 tagged with GFP at the C terminus exhibits diffuse nuclear localization, with a significant concentration in the nucleolus (Fig. 1A). NEIL1 tagged with an alternative fluorescent protein (mCherry) displays a similar pattern of intracellular localization whether expressed in HeLa cells (data not shown) or human osteosarcoma U2OS cells (Fig. 1B). After confirming predominantly nuclear targeting of the tagged NEIL1 protein, we determined the recruitment dynamics of GFP-NEIL1 to defined sites of DNA damage using laser microirradiation coupled with confocal microscopy. Initially, we employed a high laser dose (2.7%) known to generate DNA damage (likely oxidative lesions; see below) processed by the BER pathway to test the functionality of the GFP-NEIL1 fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 2 (top row), nucleoplasmic, and not apparently nucleolar, GFP-NEIL1 rapidly accumulates at the site of high dose irradiation. To determine whether NEIL1 responds to psoralen-induced adducts, pGFP-NEIL1 transfected HeLa cells were incubated with trioxsalen in culture, and then specified regions within the nucleus were targeted with laser intensities sufficient to activate the compound, but too low to produce significant oxidative lesions (1.7%). As seen in Fig. 2 (second row), GFP-NEIL1 was immediately recruited to sites of DNA interstrand crosslink damage (i.e. at the 5 s time point), dispersed completely by 8 min, and didn't re-localize to the irradiated region out to 60 min post-laser treatment (not shown). Importantly, the fusion protein did not recruit to sites treated with the low (1.7%) laser dose alone (i.e. no psoralen; Fig. 2, middle row). To determine whether the GFP-NEIL1 response observed above is specific to psoralen-induced interstrand crosslinks and not monoadducts, we employed angelicin, a photoreactive analog of psoralen that can form only monoadducts repaired by nucleotide excision repair (NER). As depicted in Fig. 2, GFP-NEIL1 responds neither to angelicin + laser (fourth row) nor to the corresponding laser alone control (2.2%, bottom row), suggesting that the glycosylase is recognizing some feature specific to a trioxsalen-induced interstrand crosslink. Immunofluorescence staining with antibody against XPB confirmed that under our treatment/exposure conditions involving angelicin + laser, we were indeed generating site-specific DNA monoadducts that prompt a classic NER response (data not shown). To determine the contribution of oxidative damage to the NEIL1 response reported above, we employed the anti-oxidant NAC. NAC is the N-acetyl derivative of the amino acid l-cysteine, and its thiol (sulfhydryl) group confers anti-oxidant effects through reduction of free radicals. We postulated that NAC treatment would abrogate any response that is reliant on the formation of oxidative DNA damage. As seen in Fig. 3A, NAC completely suppressed NEIL1 recruitment to sites of the high laser dose treatment (top row), but had no effect on the response to psoralen + low laser (bottom row). These results are consistent with our conclusions that the high laser dose elicits a general BER response and that the NEIL1 protein is reacting to something specific to the crosslinking agent. Prior studies have shown that the NER damage recognition factor, XPC, which exists as part of"

The primary toxin of GBS, β-hemolysin/cytolysin (βH/C), has a well-defined role in the pathogenesis of invasive disease, but its role in urinary tract infection (UTI) is unknown. Using both in vitro and in vivo models, we analyzed the importance of βH/C in GBS uropathogenesis. There were no significant differences in bacterial density from the bladders or kidneys from mice infected with wild-type or isogenic βH/C-deficient GBS, and competitive indices from co-infection experiments were near 1. Thus, βH/C is dispensable for the establishment of GBS-UTI. However, βH/C-sufficient GBS induced a more robust proinflammatory cytokine response in cultured bladder epithelial cells and in the urinary tracts of infected mice. Given the near ubiquity of βH/C-expressing strains in epidemiologic studies and the importance of local inflammation in dictating outcomes and sequelae of UTI, we hypothesize that βH/C-driven inflammatory signaling may be important in the clinical course of GBS-UTI."

Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer, and kallikreins play an important role in the establishment of this disease. rBbKIm is the recombinant Bauhinia bauhinioides kallikreins inhibitor that was modified to include the RGD/RGE motifs of the inhibitor BrTI from Bauhinia rufa. This work reports the effects of rBbKIm on DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines. rBbKIm inhibited the cell viability of DU145 and PC3 cells but did not affect the viability of fibroblasts. rBbKIm caused an arrest of the PC3 cell cycle at the G0/G1 and G2/M phases but did not affect the DU145 cell cycle, although rBbKIm triggers apoptosis and cytochrome c release into the cytosol of both cell types. The differences in caspase activation were observed because rBbKIm treatment promoted activation of caspase-3 in DU145 cells, whereas caspase-9 but not caspase-3 was activated in PC3 cells. Because angiogenesis is important to the development of a tumor, the effect of rBbKIm in this process was also analyzed, and an inhibition of 49% was observed in in vitro endothelial cell capillary-like tube network formation. In summary, we demonstrated that different properties of the protease inhibitor rBbKIm may be explored for investigating the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145."

Activation of pattern recognition receptors result in the production and release of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNFα and IL-6.

Using macrophages and dendritic cells deficient in spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), we identified a novel pathway by which TNFα trafficking and secretion are regulated by Syk following stimulation with CpG DNA. In the absence of PLCγ2, a Syk substrate, or the calcium-responsive kinase calcium calmodulin kinase II, CpG-induced TNFα secretion was impaired. Forced calcium mobilization rescued the TNFα secretion defect in Syk-deficient cells.

Kaisho T. Akira S. Toll-like receptors.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4731) Google Scholar). This response includes up-regulation of costimulatory molecules on innate immune cells, production of antiviral molecules and proinflammatory cytokines, and activation of antigen-specific immunity. Although TLR activation is crucial for host defense, excessive TLR signaling can lead to inflammatory and autoimmune disease (2Kawai T. Akira S. The role of pattern-recognition receptors in innate immunity. Update on Toll-like receptors.Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (6187) Google Scholar). TNFα is a potent proinflammatory cytokine produced following PAMP recognition by PRRs that is crucial for the clearance of certain pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but whose activity has also been linked to pathogenesis of inflammatory disease (3Flynn J.L.

Syk is a protein tyrosine kinase that regulates many cellular processes, including B cell antigen receptor (immunoglobulin) and integrin signaling, inflammasome activation, phagocytosis, and reactive oxygen species production (5Mócsai A.

Syk signaling is also important for cytokine release downstream of PAMP recognition. However, the mechanism by which Syk regulates this process is unresolved. Conflicting studies suggest that Syk acts downstream of receptors either to promote cytokine production (6Chaudhary A. Fresquez T.M. Naranjo M.J.

The various approaches employed to study Syk may be contributing to the contradictory functions ascribed to this enzyme. Embryonic deletion of Syk results in perinatal lethality because of severe vascular abnormalities. Hence, mice with germ line deletion of the gene cannot be used for analysis (13Cheng A.M. Rowley B.

Although the use of radiation chimeras circumvents perinatal lethality, this produces developmental abnormalities, including blocks in B cell maturation that may confound the interpretation of the effects of Syk deletion in innate immune cells. Other studies have relied on pharmacological inhibition of Syk that are likely complicated by off-target effects of these drugs (16Geahlen R.L. McLaughlin J.L.

Recognizing the limitations of these approaches, we have used complementary methodologies in primary cells and in a model cell line to resolve the role of Syk in signaling downstream of one critical PRR, TLR9, which responds to CpG DNA. Utilizing genetic deletion selectively in DCs and genetic knockdown in a macrophage cell line, we observed that Syk deficiency results in impaired CpG-induced exocytosis of TNFα but not IL-6. Syk-deficient DCs and macrophages exhibited defective calcium signaling in response to CpG, which was responsible for the defect in TNFα secretion. Our data suggest a novel mechanism for TNFα exocytosis involving a Syk-PLCγ-CaMKII pathway downstream of PAMP signaling and provide insight into how particular cytokine responses are generated post-translationally. Sykflox/floxCD11c Cre+ and Sykflox/flox CD11c Cre-negative mice were housed in our Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-certified animal facility. Mice used in experiments were between 7 and 10 weeks of age. All experiments were performed with approval of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The following Western blot antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.: TNFα (catalog no. 3707), phospho-ERK (clone D13.14.4E), total ERK (clone L34F12), phospho-p38 (clone 28B10), phospho-CaMKII (catalog no. 3361), pan-CaMKII (clone D11A10), NF-κB p65 (clone C22B4), PLCγ2 (catalog no. 3872), and IκBα (clone 44D4). The following Western blot antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.: β-actin (clone C-11), Syk (clone N-19), and MHC class II (clone M5/114). Secondary antibodies (mouse, goat, rat, and rabbit IgG) were purchased from Licor. Antibodies used for flow cytometry from BD Biosciences include TNFα (clone MP6-XT22) conjugated to AF-700 or Pe-Cy7 and CD11c (clone HL3) conjugated to APC or Pe-Cy7. Ionomycin (Molecular Probes) was used at 1 μg/ml. TAPI-0 (20 μm, EMD Millipore) was used to inhibit TACE activity and thus prevent cleavage of surface TNFα. The mouse RAW264.7 macrophage cell line was cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) and antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine; Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. For experiments, cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml CpG1826 (IDT). Lentivirus containing the pLKO.1 vector expressing Syk shRNA, PLCγ2 shRNA, or CaMKII shRNA (Open Biosystems) was made using the calcium phosphate method of transfection of HEK293 T cells and then transduced into RAW cells. Briefly, 0.2 million RAW cells were plated on 24-well sterile tissue culture-treated plates (Cell Star) and allowed to attach overnight. On day 1 after plating, 1 ml of viral supernatant was added to each well in the presence of polybrene (4 μg/ml), and plates were centrifuged for 2 h at 2000 rpm at 32 ºC, and cells were returned to the incubator with fresh DMEM. Transduction was repeated on day 2. On day 4, puromycin (2 μg/ml, Sigma) was added to the culture to select for virally transduced cells. Protein knockdown was assessed by Western blotting. Bone marrow was flushed from the tibias and femurs of control and Syk flox mice and cultured for 8 days in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) containing antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine), fetal bovine serum, and GM-CSF (3.3 ng/ml, Peprotech). On day 8, cells were stimulated with CpG for various assays. Control and Syk flox mice were injected subcutaneously with 5 million B16-Flt3L cells. This melanoma cell line is genetically engineered to secrete Flt3L. Fourteen days post-injection, mice were sacrificed, and spleens were treated with DNase (50 μg/ml, Roche) and collagenase (100 μg/ml, Roche) for 30 min at 37 ºC. Splenocytes were harvested, and DCs were selected with magnetic CD11c beads (Miltenyi Biotec) run through a MACS LS column (Miltenyi Biotec). Purity was confirmed using flow cytometry. CD11c+ splenic DCs were cultured in complete Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10 ng/ml GM-CSF. After stimulation of cultured cells with CpG, supernatants were collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,200 rpm at 4 ºC degrees. Cytokine concentrations were measured in the supernatants using TNFα and IL-6 ELISA kits (BD OptEIA, BD Biosciences) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For detection of serum TNFα from CpG-injected control and Syk flox mice, blood was collected from the cheek vein and centrifuged for 20 min at 13,200 rpm. Serum was tested using an ELISA kit. For detection of surface TNFα, cultured cells stimulated with CpG and TAPI-0 were harvested, pelleted, and resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 0.01% sodium azide). Cells were then resuspended sequentially in 4% paraformaldehyde (20 min) and Pe-Cy7-conjugated rat anti-TNF antibody (BD Biosciences). For detection of intracellular TNFα, cultured cells were stimulated with CpG in the presence of brefeldin A, which prevents transport of newly synthesized proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum. After harvesting, cells were fixed and permeabilized for 20 min with 1× Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences). Cells were washed in 1× Permwash (BD Biosciences) and stained with Pe-Cy7 or AF700-conjugated rat anti-TNF antibody (BD Biosciences). All steps were performed at 4 ºC. Cells were analyzed on an LSR II (BD Biosciences) using FACSDiva software, and data were analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar). For preparation of whole cell lysate, cells were washed in cold PBS and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 5 m NaCl, 1 m Tris (pH 7.4), complete protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 100 mm NaF, 100 mm Na vanadate, and 100 mm phenylmethanesulfonylflouride. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,200 rpm and stored at −20 ºC. For preparation of membrane lysates, cells were washed in cold PBS and resuspended in PBS containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cells underwent 5 cycles of freeze/thaw lysis and were frozen in an ethanol/dry ice bath and thawed in a 37 ºC degree water bath. Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min. Pellets (membrane fraction) were washed in PBS, centrifuged again, and resuspended in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. To obtain nuclear lysates to investigate nuclear translocation of NF-κB, CpG-stimulated cells were lysed using the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. All lysates were boiled and separated on SDS-PAGE (4% Bis-Tris gel, Invitrogen) and analyzed by Western blotting. Licor analysis software was used to analyze blots developed on Odyssey. Membrane lysates were also plated on a black 96-well plate for the Sensolyte 520 TACE activity assay (Anaspec) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, a peptide substrate, the fluorescence of which was quenched in the intact peptide, was added to lysates. In the presence of TACE, the peptide was cleaved, and fluorescence of the cleaved substrate, which was directly proportional to the amount of TACE activity, was measured. RNA was isolated from cultured cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer, and cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript III kit (Invitrogen) from 1 μg of RNA. Quantitative PCR was performed on the cDNA using TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) with probes for mouse TNFα (Mn00443258_m1), mouse TLR9 (Mn00446193_m1), and mouse GAPDH (Mn99999915_g1). Samples were run and analyzed using a Sequence Detection System 7500 PCR machine from Applied Biosystems. TNFα message levels and TLR9 message levels were normalized to that of GAPDH. RAW cells were loaded with fura-2 AM (3 μm, Invitrogen) for 45 min at room temperature, and intracellular calcium was detected in response to CpG by digital imaging as described previously (18Liu Q.H. Fleischmann B.K. Hondowicz B. Maier C.C. Turka L.A. Yui K. Kotlikoff M.I. Wells A.D. Freedman B.D. Modulation of Kv channel expression and function by TCR and costimulatory signals during peripheral CD4(+) lymphocyte differentiation.J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 897-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The fluorescence emission ratio of fura-2 was detected at 510 nm in a solution containing no calcium to establish a base-line reading. CpG was added before the cells were returned to a bath solution containing 155 mm NaCl, 4.5mK KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Cells were then stimulated with ATP (10 μm) and ionomycin. Graphs and statistical tests were generated and analyzed using Prism Version 5.0. In general, Student's unpaired t test was used to compare groups. To analyze membrane TNFα data (Fig. 4, Western blot analysis), membrane TNFα was normalized to MHC class II for each cell type. The relative amount of membrane TNFα was computed by dividing normalized TNFα of the Syk-deficient cells to that of the control cells. The resulting ratio was compared with the value of 1, representing no change using a one-sample t test. Similarly, the MFI of surface TNFα was compared between Syk-deficient and control cells, and the resulting ratio was analyzed against the value of 1. For studies involving calcium signaling (Fig. 7), pCaMKII was normalized to total ERK for each cell genotype. Data were analyzed on the basis of fold induction of normalized pCaMKII from time 0 and on the basis of percentage of ionomycin-stimulated signal of normalized pCamKII. To study the role of Syk in DCs in vivo, we crossed mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the CD11c promoter to mice with loxP sites flanking Syk (19Saijo K. Schmedt C. Su I.H. Karasuyama H. Lowell C.A. Reth M. Adachi T. Patke A. Santana A. Tarakhovsky A. Essential role of Src-family protein tyrosine kinases in NF-κB activation during B cell development.Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), resulting in the conditional deletion of Syk in CD11c+ DCs (Syk flox). Western analysis of splenic DCs and BMDCs from Syk flox mice showed near complete deletion of Syk protein (supplemental Fig. S1). To assess the role of Syk in cytokine response, Syk flox and control (Syk flox, Cre-negative) mice were injected with CpG. Serum from CpG-injected Syk flox mice contained markedly less TNFα compared with that of control mice (Fig. 1A), demonstrating an in vivo role for Syk in the regulation of CpG-induced TNFα. We next sought to investigate the contribution of CD11c+ cells to TNFα production and secretion. Culture supernatants from splenic DCs and BMDCs isolated from Syk flox mice contained a 2-fold reduction in CpG-induced TNFα compared with supernatants from cells isolated from control mice (Fig. 1, B and C). We confirmed this phenotype using shRNA knockdown of Syk in the RAW macrophage cell line. Syk-deficient RAW cells also showed a decreased level of TNFα in the supernatant following CpG stimulation compared with cells transduced with empty vector (control) (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. S1) or to RAW cells transduced with an irrelevant shRNA sequence that did not result in effective knockdown of Syk (supplemental Fig. S1). In contrast to the reduction in TNFα, Syk-deficient splenic DCs and BMDCs secreted IL-6 normally in response to CpG (Fig. 1, B and C), indicating that Syk deficiency does not result in global dysfunction of the CpG signaling pathway. Together, these data suggest that Syk selectively regulates TNFα but not IL-6 levels. We speculated that Syk regulates TNFα levels by promoting its production or secretion. However, it is possible that Syk regulates TNFα consumption or biological activity, as has been seen in other cellular systems (20Tartaglia L.A. Goeddel D.V. Two TNF receptors.Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 151-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that Syk deficiency might alter consumption of secreted TNFα, CpG-stimulated or unstimulated control and Syk-deficient RAW cells were exposed to a fixed amount of exogenous TNFα in the presence of a TACE inhibitor, which prevents cleavage and secretion of synthesized, endogenous TNFα into the supernatant. We measured no difference in TNFα levels in culture supernatants from cells replete or deficient in Syk (supplemental Fig. S2), suggesting that the defect observed from Syk-deficient cells is not due to increased cellular consumption of TNFα. Soluble TNF receptor cleaved from the cell surface can bind to soluble TNFα, thereby acting as a TNFα antagonist (21Van Zee K.J. Kohno T. Fischer E. Rock C.S. Moldawer L.L. Lowry S.F. Tumor necrosis factor soluble receptors circulate during experimental and clinical inflammation and can protect against excessive tumor necrosis factor α in vitroin vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 4845-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that Syk deficiency promotes the production of soluble proteins binding secreted TNFα and, thus, preventing its detection by ELISA, we examined TNFα levels in supernatants that were boiled and denatured to disrupt protein-protein interactions, thus allowing for detection of all secreted TNFα. Western blot analysis of denatured supernatants from CpG-treated RAW cells revealed a decrease in secreted TNFα in the absence of Syk, arguing against selective production of an interfering TNFα binding protein in the context of Syk deficiency (supplemental Fig. S2). Syk is known to be activated downstream of CpG stimulation (8Sanjuan M.A. Rao N. Lai K.T. Gu Y. Sun S. Fuchs A. Fung-Leung W.P. Colonna M. Karlsson L.

Anti-inflammatory actions of Syk inhibitors in macrophages involve non-specific inhibition of toll-like receptors-mediated JNK signaling pathway.Mol. Immunol. 2010; 47: 1569-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To determine the role of canonical TLR9 signaling in Syk-dependent regulation of TNFα, we investigated signaling events downstream of TLR9 in control and Syk-deficient cells stimulated with CpG. Control and Syk-deficient cells expressed similar levels of TLR9 (Fig. 2A), and CpG-induced phosphorylation of the MAP kinases ERK and p38 occurred similarly in the presence and absence of Syk (B). IκBα, a cytoplasmic protein whose interaction with NF-κB blocks its nuclear translocation, was similarly degraded after 30 min of CpG stimulation in control and Syk-deficient RAW cells and BMDCs (Fig. 2C), thus allowing nuclear translocation of NF-κB (D). These data demonstrate that canonical signaling downstream of TLR9 is intact in the absence of Syk. MAP Kinase and NF-κB Activity Can Regulate TNFα Transcription (22Dumitru C.D. Ceci J.D.

Acta. 2007; 1770: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Consistent with the observation that activation of these signaling intermediates was intact, TNFα mRNA levels were also similar in control and Syk-deficient cells following CpG stimulation (Fig. 3A). Moreover, Syk-deficient RAW cells, splenic DCs, and BMDCs produced TNFα protein similar to control cells following CpG stimulation in the presence of brefeldin A, which prevents exocytosis (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these data demonstrate that, in response to CpG, TNFα mRNA and protein generation occurs independently of Syk. We next considered whether Syk might be playing a role in the exocytosis and subsequent secretion of synthesized TNFα. To investigate this possibility, control and Syk-deficient RAW cells were stimulated with CpG, and membrane lysates were measured by Western blot analysis and ELISA. Both measurements revealed elevated levels of TNFα protein in membranes of Syk-deficient cells compared with control cells (Figs. 4, A and B). Because the membrane preparations included intracellular and plasma membranes, this approach cannot distinguish TNFα retention in organelles within the cell from TNFα residing at the cell surface. It is known that prior to secretion, TNFα translated at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane traffics through the Golgi apparatus and the endosomal compartment before reaching the plasma membrane (25Stow J.L.

Chem. 2005; 280: 10478-10483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). At the plasma membrane, membrane TNFα is cleaved by TACE, allowing soluble TNFα to be secreted from the cell (27Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. A metalloproteinase disintegrin that releases tumour-necrosis factor-α from cells.Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2705) Google Scholar). TNFα retention inside the cell would reflect a trafficking defect, whereas increased cytokine at the plasma membrane would suggest a defect in TACE activity. To distinguish between these possibilities, we assayed TACE activity in isolated membrane lysates and found no difference in TACE activity between the control and Syk-deficient cells, suggesting that both constitutive and CpG-induced TACE activity is intact in the absence of Syk (Fig. 4C). To investigate the role of Syk in TNFα trafficking to the plasma membrane, RAW cells and BMDCs were stimulated with CpG alone or with CpG in the presence of a TACE inhibitor (TNFα protease inhibitor, TAPI). TAPI allows TNFα to accumulate at the plasma membrane by blocking its cleavage and secretion, thus enabling us to measure trafficking of total TNFα to the cell surface, as reported previously (28Low P.C. Misaki R. Schroder K. Stanley A.C. Sweet M.J. Teasdale R.D. Vanhaesebroeck B. Meunier F.A. Taguchi T. Stow J.L.

Subcompartments of the macrophage recycling endosome direct the differential secretion of IL-6 and TNFα.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We observed similar amounts of surface TNFα on Syk-sufficient and Syk-deficient cells after CpG stimulation in the presence of TACE activity when TNFα was able to be cleaved and subsequently secreted (Fig. 4D, CpG). However, in the presence of TAPI, significantly less TNFα accumulated at the surface of the Syk-deficient RAW cells and BMDCs compared with control cells (Fig. 4D, CpG/TAPI). The decrease in surface TNFα in the absence of Syk was almost 2-fold, consistent with the 2-fold reduction in TNFα secretion (Fig. 1) and the 2-fold increase in TNFα membrane protein (Fig. 4, A and B). Taken together, these data demonstrate that CpG-induced TNFα fails to traffic efficiently to the ce"

Our results are discussed in view of the molecular dynamics at the human DNA replication fork. Accurate transfer of the genetic information is critical for survival of living organisms. Checkpoint control pathways prevent the transmission of incompletely replicated or damaged DNA to daughter cells. Genotoxic insults, spontaneous errors arising during replication as well as endogenous blocks (the so-called replication fork barriers), impede replisome progression and may trigger chromosomal rearrangements and genomic instability. To cope with these problems, cells have evolved S phase checkpoints, which sense stalled replication forks and DNA damage and delay cell cycle progression until the problems are solved (1Melo J. Toczyski D. A unified view of the DNA damage checkpoint.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 2Branzei D. Foiani M.

Mechanisms of replication fork protection: a safeguard for genome stability.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2012; 47: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Stabilization of stalled replication forks in the presence of DNA damage or at difficult-to-replicate templates is necessary to prevent their collapse and inability to restart synthesis after recovery (4Tercero J.A.

It was proposed that in yeast stabilization of paused forks is carried out by three proteins: Mrc1, Tof1, and Csm3 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (5Bando M. Katou Y. Komata M. Tanaka H. Itoh T.

Therefore, they are thought to play a role even during unperturbed DNA replication that is independent of their checkpoint function (15Hodgson B. Calzada A. Labib K. Mrc1 and Tof1 regulate DNA replication forks in different ways during normal S phase.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 18: 3894-3902Crossref Google Scholar). Similar mechanisms of stabilization of the stalled forks are believed to operate also in metazoans, where Claspin, Tim, and Tipin are the orthologs of Mrc1, Tof1 (Swi1), and Csm3 (Swi3), respectively (16Chou D.M.

Tim and Tipin, whose level of expression peaks at the G1/S border during the cell cycle, form a heterodimeric stable complex located in the nucleus (18Yoshizawa-Sugata N. Masai H.

Several studies revealed that in budding yeast Tof1 is required for the regulation of the normal progression of DNA replication (8Katou Y. Kanoh Y. Bando M. Noguchi H. Tanaka H. Ashikari T.

Mammalian TIMELESS and Tipin are evolutionarily conserved replication fork-associated factors.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 36-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, experiments performed in the Xenopus egg extracts system showed that Tim and Tipin interact and collaborate with the replication factor And1 to ensure a stable association of DNA polymerase α to the replisome and that the Tim-Tipin complex is required for fork restart after aphidicolin treatment (20Errico A. Costanzo V. Hunt T. Tipin is required for stalled replication forks to resume DNA replication after removal of aphidicolin in Xenopus egg extracts.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Tipin/Tim/And1 protein complex promotes Pol α chromatin binding and sister chromatid cohesion.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 3681-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This is likely due to the ability of these factors to stabilize paused replication forks and to prevent disassembly of the replisome. Consequently, forks are ready to resume DNA replication once the blockage and/or damage has been removed. Claspin, an additional important S phase checkpoint mediator, is also believed to play a critical role during unperturbed DNA replication. As a matter of fact, DNA replication in Xenopus egg extracts occurred somewhat more slowly than normal after immunodepletion of Claspin (23Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Claspin, a Chk1-regulatory protein, monitors DNA replication on chromatin independently of RPA, ATR, and Rad17.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in human cells overexpression of Claspin enhanced the rate of cell proliferation (24Lin S.Y. Li K. Stewart G.S. Elledge S.J. Human Claspin works with BRCA1 to both positively and negatively regulate cell proliferation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6484-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and Claspin was shown to promote normal replication fork rate either in HeLa cells or in primary fibroblasts by means of DNA-combing experiments (25Petermann E. Helleday T. Caldecott K.W. Claspin promotes normal replication fork rates in human cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2373-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae Mrc1 was demonstrated to interact directly with Pol2, the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase ϵ, either during normal S phase or after checkpoint activation (26Lou H. Komata M. Katou Y. Guan Z. Reis C.C. Budd M. Shirahige K. Campbell J.L. Mrc1 and DNA polymerase ϵ function together in linking DNA replication and S phase checkpoint.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 106-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This interaction is believed to be important to avoid dissociation of DNA polymerase ϵ from the leading strand during checkpoint. In fact, Pol2 dissociated from the replisome after hydroxyurea treatment in yeast cells lacking Mrc1 and the same behavior was also observed in Tof1-depleted cells, in line with the proposal that Mrc1 associates with Tof1 at the replication fork. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Mrc1 interacted even with the Mcm2 subunit of the Mcm2–7 complex (26Lou H. Komata M. Katou Y. Guan Z. Reis C.C. Budd M. Shirahige K. Campbell J.L. Mrc1 and DNA polymerase ϵ function together in linking DNA replication and S phase checkpoint.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 106-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Overall, genetic and biochemical analyses carried out in yeasts and metazoans indicate the existence of an evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanism that functionally couples the replicative DNA helicase (the Cdc45-Mcm2–7-GINS (CMG) 2The abbreviation used is: CMGCdc45-Mcm2–7-GINS. complex (27Ilves I. Petojevic T. Pesavento J.J. Botchan M.R. Activation of the MCM2–7 helicase by association with Cdc45 and GINS proteins.Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar)) with DNA polymerase α on the lagging strand by the action of And1 and Tipin (Ctf4 in yeast) and with DNA polymerase ϵ on the leading strand by means of Claspin and Tim-Tipin (Mrc1 and Tof1/Csm3 or Swi1/Swi3 in budding yeast) (3Errico A. Costanzo V. Mechanisms of replication fork protection: a safeguard for genome stability.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2012; 47: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In line with this proposal, we report here evidence that the human Tim-Tipin complex (and Tim alone) directly interacts with DNA polymerase ϵ and specifically enhances its synthetic activity. Cdc45-Mcm2–7-GINS. Human Tipin open reading frame (ORF) was PCR-amplified from an OriGene clone (OriGene accession number NM_017858) and cloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (GE Healthcare) using the following oligonucleotides: Tipin-BamHI forward (5′-TTTGGGGGATCCATGCTAGAACCACAGGAGAATGGCGTGATT-3′) and Tipin-XhoI-His6 reverse (5′-GGGTTTCATATGCTAGAACCACAGGAGAATGGCGTG-3′). The ORF sequence was confirmed by sequencing analysis (PRIMM; Milan, Italy). The plasmid expressing the truncated form of human Tim (FLAG-Tim5) was already described (28Uno S. Masai H.

You Z. Masai H. Purification of replication factors using insect and mammalian cell expression systems.Methods. 2012; 57: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The baculoviruses expressing the human DNA polymerase ϵ subunits (p261, FLAG-p59, p17, and p12) were a generous gift from J. Hurwitz (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY). Escherichia coli Rosetta cells (Novagen) were transformed with the plasmid pGEX-4T-1-Tipin-His6 and grown at 37 °C in 2 liters of LB (Luria-Bertani) medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml cloramphenicol. When cells reached an A600 of 0.8, protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (at 0.2 mm) to the medium, and the culture was incubated for additional 4 h at 22 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 40 ml of Tipin-lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100; 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 800 nm aprotinin, 4 mm benzamidine, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and subjected to three consecutive passages through a French pressure cell apparatus (Aminco Co.) at 1500 p.s.i. After centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 65,000 × g the cell extract was incubated with 4 ml of glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4 °C. Then the resin was washed extensively with glutathione-washing buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at room temperature, and the protein was eluted with glutathione-elution buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm l-glutathione). The fractions were pooled and incubated with thrombin protease (GE Healthcare) in a dialysis tube to remove the GST fused at the N terminus of Tipin. The dialysis step was performed at room temperature for 16 h against 3 liters of a buffer having the following composition: 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The dialyzed protein was mixed with 4 ml of glutathione-Sepharose resin and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C to remove the cleaved GST. The resulting flow-through fraction (which contained Tipin-His6 but not GST) was then mixed with 4 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed extensively with nickel-washing buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and finally the protein was eluted with an imidazole gradient (25–500 mm) in nickel-washing buffer. The fractions containing Tipin-His6 were pooled, and the pool was dialyzed against QA buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) and loaded onto a Mono Q (10/100) column at 0.5 ml/min using an ÄKTA apparatus (GE Healthcare). The column was washed extensively with the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0.1–1 m). Elution fractions were collected and concentrated. 150 μg of Tipin-His6 was loaded on a Superdex 200 (10/300) column using an ÄKTA system in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol. The column was calibrated by running a set of gel filtration markers that included ferritin (440 kDa), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa). Finally, Tipin-His6 was concentrated and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Sf9 insect cells (20 × 106 cells/15-cm dish × 6 dishes) were grown at 27 °C in Sf900 medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamycin (10 μg/ml). The cells were infected with a fresh amplified recombinant baculovirus stock expressing FLAG-Tim. 48 h after infection cells were harvested by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min, washed with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in 5 ml of Tim-lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm PMSF) containing a protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cells were disrupted with five cycles of sonication and centrifuged at 65,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. α-FLAG M2 beads (1 ml; Sigma) were incubated with cell extract for 2 h at 4 °C and then washed with Tim-washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT). Bound proteins were eluted with 5 ml of FLAG-elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma)). The pool of fractions containing FLAG-Tim was dialyzed against 1 liter of FLAG-elution buffer without FLAG peptide and then concentrated up to 0.5 mg/ml. FLAG-Tim (100 μg) was layered onto a 8-ml preformed glycerol gradient (from 15 to 40% glycerol in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.005% Triton X-100) and subjected to centrifugation at 250,000 × g for 12 h at 4 °C. A parallel gradient was used to fractionate a mixture of the following standard proteins: ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa). Fractions containing FLAG-Tim were pooled and dialyzed against the glycerol gradient buffer containing 10% glycerol, concentrated, and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. The human Tim-Tipin complex was purified from HEK 293T cells transiently co-transfected with plasmids expressing His6-Tim-HA and His6-Tipin-3×FLAG, as recently described (28Uno S. Masai H.

You Z. Masai H. Purification of replication factors using insect and mammalian cell expression systems.Methods. 2012; 57: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). FLAG-Tim 5 was produced and purified using the same procedure utilized for the Tim-Tipin complex. The human Tim-Tipin complex was also produced using the baculovirus/insect cells system. Sf9 insect cells (20 × 106 cells/15-cm dish × 25 dishes) were grown at 27 °C in Sf900 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamycin (10 μg/ml). The cells were infected with fresh amplified recombinant baculovirus stocks expressing FLAG-Tim and Tipin. 48 h after infection cells were harvested by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min, washed with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in 20 ml of Tim-lysis buffer containing a protease inhibitors mixture. Cells were disrupted with 5 cycles of sonication and centrifuged at 65,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. α-FLAG M2 beads (1 ml) were incubated with cell extract for 2 h at 4 °C and then washed with Tim-washing buffer containing 2 mm PMSF. Bound proteins were eluted with 4 ml of FLAG-elution buffer. The eluted sample containing the Tim-Tipin complex was dialyzed overnight against buffer A (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Triton-X-100) and loaded onto a Mini Q 4.6/50 PE column at 0.5 ml/min using an ÄKTA apparatus. The column was washed extensively with the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with 8-ml linear gradient of NaCl (50 mm–1 m). Fractions (0.25 ml each) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the ones that contained either Tim or Tipin were dialyzed separately overnight against buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 30 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.005% Triton X-100). Aliquots of each fraction were tested for the presence of DNA polymerase ϵ stimulatory activity. Then, the dialyzed fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against buffer C (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100). The dialyzed pool was loaded onto a Mini S 4.6/50 PE column at 0.5 ml/min using an ÄKTA apparatus. The column was washed extensively with the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with a 5-ml linear gradient of NaCl (50 mm–1 m). Fractions (0.25 ml each) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the ones that contained either Tim or Tipin were dialyzed overnight against buffer B. Aliquots of each fraction were tested for the presence of DNA polymerase ϵ stimulatory activity in enzymatic assays. The human DNA polymerases α and ϵ used for the enzymatic assays were purified from exponentially growing HeLa cells, as described (30Syväoja J. Suomensaari S. Nishida C. Goldsmith J.S. Chui G.S. Jain S. Linn S. DNA polymerases α, δ, and ϵ: three distinct enzymes from HeLa cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). DNA polymerase δ was produced in recombinant form in Sf9 insect cells and purified as described (31Podust V.N. Chang L.S. Ott R. Dianov G.L. Fanning E.

The human DNA polymerase ϵ used for the protein/protein interaction studies was purified from Sf9 insect cells (20 × 106 cells/15-cm dish × 11 dishes), which were co-infected with freshly amplified baculoviral stocks expressing its four subunits (p261, FLAG-p59, p17, and p12). 48 h after infection cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in 4 ml of hypotonic buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mm PMSF) containing a protease-inhibitors mixture and 30 units/ml benzonase (Sigma). To guarantee a complete cell disruption, the sample was also subjected to four sonication cycles and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. After addition of NaCl (at 150 mm) and EDTA (at 1 mm), the sample was centrifuged at 65,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was incubated with α-FLAG M2 beads (1 ml) for 2 h at 4 °C with shaking. The beads were washed with washing buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.01% Nonidet P-40), containing 300 mm NaCl. Elution was carried out with 4 ml of the same buffer containing 150 mm NaCl at 150 mm and the FLAG peptide (200 μg/ml). The fractions containing DNA polymerase ϵ were pooled, and the pool was dialyzed against PBS buffer, concentrated, and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. DNA polymerase assays on poly(dA)-oligo(dT) were carried out in a volume of 25 μl using [methyl-3H]dTTP as radioactive precursor, as described previously (32Weiser T. Gassmann M. Thömmes P. Ferrari E. Hafkemeyer P. Hübscher U. Biochemical and functional comparison of DNA polymerases α, δ, and ϵ from calf thymus.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10420-10428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each DNA polymerase was titrated in the respective assay buffer, and the effect of Tim-Tipin (or Tim or Tipin alone) was measured at an amount of enzyme that gave 15–30% of the maximal activity (DNA polymerase α at 15 nm, DNA polymerase δ at 8 nm, and DNA polymerase ϵ at 0.54 nm). The resulting level of incorporated dTTP was measured with a scintillation counter, and the results were reported as the stimulation -fold of each DNA polymerase against the concentrations of Tim, Tipin, or Tim-Tipin used in the assays. The average values of stimulation and the S.D. values reported in the graphs were obtained from three independent experiments. Primer extension assays were carried out using a 40-/80-mer DNA duplex as a primer/template. The 40-mer synthetic primer (5′-AGCTCCTAGGGTTACAAGCTTCACTAGGGTTGTCCTTAGG-3′) was labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Applied Science) and purified from the unincorporated radionuclide by passage over a Micro Bio-Spin 30 column (Bio-Rad). Then, the purified primer was annealed to a 2-fold molar excess of a cold complementary 80-mer synthetic oligonucleotide that acted as the template (5′-GCTGATCAACCCTACATGTGTAGGTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAAGGACAACCCTAGTGAAGCTTGTAACCCTAGGAGCT-3′). The activity of human DNA polymerase ϵ was titrated in mixtures (10 μl) containing the above 40-/80-mer primer/template (at 10 nm) and the four dNTPs (each at 100 nm) in the respective assay (32Weiser T. Gassmann M. Thömmes P. Ferrari E. Hafkemeyer P. Hübscher U. Biochemical and functional comparison of DNA polymerases α, δ, and ϵ from calf thymus.J. Biol.

The effect of Tim-Tipin (or Tim full-length and Tim 5, or Tipin alone) was analyzed using an amount of DNA polymerase ϵ (0.2 nm) that gave a low level of primer elongation. The reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min, stopped with 2 μl of stop solution (98% formamide, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol). The samples were denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, chilled on ice, and then run on a 12%-polyacrylamide/bisacrylamide (19:1) gel containing 7 m urea in 0.5× TBE buffer (1× TBE had the following composition: 89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3).

https://openalex.org/W2007688447,"Protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes undergo down-regulation upon sustained stimulation. Previous studies have pointed to the existence of both proteasome-dependent and -independent pathways of PKCα processing. Here we demonstrate that these down-regulation pathways are engaged in different subcellular compartments; proteasomal degradation occurs mainly at the plasma membrane, whereas non-proteasomal processing occurs in the perinuclear region. Using cholesterol depletion, pharmacological inhibitors, RNA interference, and dominant-negative mutants, we define the mechanisms involved in perinuclear accumulation of PKCα and identify the non-proteasomal mechanism mediating its degradation. We show that intracellular accumulation of PKCα involves at least two clathrin-independent, cholesterol/lipid raft-mediated pathways that do not require ubiquitination of the protein; one is dynamin-dependent and likely involves caveolae, whereas the other is dynamin- and small GTPase-independent. Internalized PKCα traffics through endosomes and is delivered to the lysosome for degradation. Supportive evidence includes (a) detection of the enzyme in EEA1-positive early endosomes, Rab7-positive late endosomes/multivesicular bodies, and LAMP1-positive lysosomes and (b) inhibition of its down-regulation by lysosome-disrupting agents and leupeptin. Only limited dephosphorylation of PKCα occurs during trafficking, with fully mature enzyme being the main target for lysosomal degradation. These studies define a novel and widespread mechanism of desensitization of PKCα signaling that involves endocytic trafficking and lysosome-mediated degradation of the mature, fully phosphorylated protein."
https://openalex.org/W2020152948,"The scaffold protein ISCU facilitates the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters (ISCs), which are essential cofactors for many vital metabolic processes. The mTOR pathways are central to nutrient and energy-sensing networks. Here, we demonstrate that mTORC1 associates with ISCU and phosphorylates ISCU at serine 14. This phosphorylation stabilized ISCU protein. Insufficiency of ISCU triggered by mTORC1 inhibition prevented ISC assembly. Sustained ISCU protein levels enhanced by mTORC1 sensitized TSC2-null cells to iron deprivation due to constitutive ISC biogenesis-triggered iron demand, which outstrips supply. We conclude that the mTORC1 pathway serves to modulate iron metabolism and homeostasis, and we speculate that iron deprivation may be an adjunct in the treatment of cancers characterized by constitutive mTORC1 activation."
https://openalex.org/W1574227984,"NF-κB-controlled transcriptional regulation plays a central role in inflammatory and immune responses. Currently, understanding about NF-κB activation mechanism emphasizes IκB-tethered complex inactivation in the cytoplasm. In the case of NF-κB activation, IκB phosphorylation leads to its degradation, followed by NF-κB relocation to the nucleus and trans-activation of NF-κB-targeted genes. Pretranslational mechanism mediated NF-κB activation remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated NF-κB pretranslational regulation by performing a series of database mining analyses and using six large national experimental databases (National Center of Biotechnology Information UniGene expressed sequence tag profile database, Gene Expression Omnibus database, Transcription Element Search System database, AceView database, and Epigenomics database) and TargetScan software. We reported the following findings: 1) NF-κB-signaling genes are differentially expressed in human and mouse tissues; 2) heart and vessels are the inflammation-privileged tissues and less easy to be inflamed because lacking in key NF-κB-signaling molecular expression; 3) NF-κB-signaling genes are induced by cardiovascular disease risk factors oxidized phospholipids and proinflammatory cytokines in endothelial cells; 4) transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins and NF-κB have higher binding site frequencies in the promoters of proinflammatory cytokine-induced NF-κB genes; 5) most NF-κB-signaling genes have multiple alternative promoters and alternatively spliced isoforms; 6) NF-κB family genes can be regulated by DNA methylation; and 7) 27 of 38 NF-κB-signaling genes can be regulated by microRNAs. Our findings provide important insight into the mechanism of NF-κB activation, which may contribute to cardiovascular disease, inflammatory diseases, and immunological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2160238997,"NF-κB is a key regulator of immune gene expression in metazoans. It is currently unclear what changes occurred in NF-κB during animal evolution and what features remained conserved. To address this question, we compared the biochemical and functional properties of NF-κB proteins derived from human and the starlet sea anemone (Nematostella vectensis) in 1) a high-throughput assay of in vitro preferences for DNA sequences, 2) ChIP analysis of in vivo recruitment to the promoters of target genes, 3) a LUMIER-assisted examination of interactions with cofactors, and 4) a transactivation assay. We observed a remarkable evolutionary conservation of the DNA binding preferences of the animal NF-κB orthologs. We also show that NF-κB dimerization properties, nuclear localization signals, and binding to cytosolic IκBs are conserved. Surprisingly, the Bcl3-type nuclear IκB proteins functionally pair up only with NF-κB derived from their own species. The basis of the differential NF-κB recognition by IκB subfamilies is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2171300278,"There is evidence that high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) may regulate platelet function, but disparate results exist regarding the effects of oxidized HDLs on platelets. The objective of our study was to determine the role of in vivo oxidized HDLs on platelet aggregation. Platelet aggregation and redox status were investigated in 5 patients with abetalipoproteinemia (ABLP) or homozygous hypobetalipoproteinemia, two rare metabolic diseases characterized by the absence of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins, compared to 5 control subjects. Platelets isolated from plasma of patients with ABLP aggregated 4 to 10 times more than control platelets, depending on the agonist. By contrast, no differences in the extent of platelet aggregation were observed between ABLP platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and control PRP, suggesting the presence of a protective factor in ABLP plasma. ABLP HDLs inhibited agonist-induced platelet aggregation by binding to SR-BI, while control HDLs had no effect. On the other hand, lipoprotein-deficient plasma from patients with ABLP did not inhibit platelet aggregation. Severe oxidative stress was evidenced in patients with ABLP. Compared to control HDLs, ABLP HDLs showed a 40% decrease of α-tocopherol and an 11-fold increased malondialdehyde concentration. These results demonstrate that in vivo oxidized HDLs do not lose their antiaggregatory properties despite oxidation.—Calzada, C., Véricel, E., Colas, R., Guillot, N., El Khoury, G., Drai, J., Sassolas, A., Peretti, N., Ponsin, G., Lagarde, M., Moulin, P.

https://openalex.org/W2037115398,"Protein inhibitors of activated STAT (Pias) proteins can act independent of sumoylation to modulate the activity of transcription factors and Pias proteins interacting with transcription factors can either activate or repress their activity. Pias proteins are expressed in many tissues and cells during development and we asked if Pias proteins regulated the pituitary homeobox 2 (PITX2) homeodomain protein, which modulates developmental gene expression. Piasy and Pias1 proteins are expressed during craniofacial/tooth development and directly interact and differentially regulate PITX2 transcriptional activity. Piasy and Pias1 are co-expressed in craniofacial tissues with PITX2. Yeast two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation and pulldown experiments demonstrate Piasy and Pias1 interactions with the PITX2 protein. Piasy interacts with the PITX2 C-terminal tail to attenuate its transcriptional activity. In contrast, Pias1 interacts with the PITX2 C-terminal tail to increase PITX2 transcriptional activity. The E3 ligase activity associated with the RING domain in Piasy is not required for the attenuation of PITX2 activity, however, the RING domain of Pias1 is required for enhanced PITX2 transcriptional activity. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays reveal PITX2 interactions with Piasy and Pias1 in the nucleus. Piasy represses the synergistic activation of PITX2 with interacting co-factors and Piasy represses Pias1 activation of PITX2 transcriptional activity. In contrast, Pias1 did not affect the synergistic interaction of PITX2 with transcriptional co-factors. Last, we demonstrate that Pias proteins form a complex with PITX2 and Lef-1, and PITX2 and β-catenin. Lef-1, β-catenin, and Pias interactions with PITX2 provide new molecular mechanisms for the regulation of PITX2 transcriptional activity and the activity of Pias proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2047899757,"Cyclin B1–CDK1 activity is essential for mitotic entry, but questions remain regarding how the activity of this kinase is spatially regulated. Previous studies showed that the cyclin B1 subunit localizes to several compartments of a mitotic cell, including the centrosomes, mitotic spindle, kinetochores and chromosomes via distinct sequence elements. Mitotic chromosome association occurs through the unstructured N-terminal domain of cyclin B1 and is independent of CDK1 binding. Here, we use live cell imaging of human cyclin B1 fused to GFP to precisely define the sequence elements within cyclin B1 that mediate its association with condensed mitotic chromosomes. We find that a short, evolutionarily conserved N-terminal motif is required for cyclin B1 to localize to mitotic chromosomes. We further reveal a role for arginine residues within and near the destruction box sequence in the chromosome association of cyclin B1. Additionally, our data suggest that sequences further downstream in cyclin B1, such as the cytoplasmic retention sequence and the cyclin box, may negatively modulate chromosome association. Because multiple basic residues are required for cyclin B1 association with mitotic chromosomes, electrostatic interactions with DNA may facilitate cyclin B1 localization to chromosomes."

The Gram-negative endosymbiont Rhizobium etli forms nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with the legume host Phaseolus vulgaris (common black bean). Nitrogen-fixing endosymbiosis is initiated through chemical signaling between the symbiont (bacteria) and legume host, which leads to organogenesis of root nodules and the internalization of the bacteria. The invading symbionts travel through infection threads to the root nodule where they are endocytosed. After endocytosis, the bacteria develop into bacteroids within plant-derived peribacteroid membranes and form nitrogen-fixing symbiosomes.

In addition, the lipid A of CE3 bacteroid LPS was exclusively tetraacylated as compared with the free living lipid A, which contained a mixture of penta- and tetraacylated lipid A. It was speculated that tetraacylated lipid A resulted from the removal of a primary β-hydroxymyristoyl residue located at position 3 of the proximal glucosamine (or 2-aminogluconoate) residue by a 3-O-deacylase. Indeed, Basu et al. (12Basu S.S. White K.A. Que N.L. Raetz C.R. A deacylase in Rhizobium leguminosarum membranes that cleaves the 3-O-linked β-hydroxymyristoyl moiety of lipid A precursors.J. Biol.

The outer membrane 3-O-deacylase enzyme PagL has been reported in a number of Gram-negative pathogens including Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bordetella bronchiseptica (13Trent M.S.

To understand the role of PagL concerning symbiosis, pathogenesis, and endophytic association with agriculturally and economically significant host plants, it is important to locate and characterize the gene that encodes PagL in these organisms. Although the membranes from R. etli CE3 demonstrated 3-O-deacylase activity in vitro (12Basu S.S. White K.A. Que N.L. Raetz C.R.

Furthermore, R. etli PagL could not be identified by amino acid sequence alignment with known PagL proteins because of low sequence identity. The crystal structure of the P. aeruginosa PagL was solved (16Rutten L. Geurtsen J. Lambert W. Smolenaers J.J. Bonvin A.M. de Haan A. van der Ley P. Egmond M.R. Gros P. Tommassen J.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 7071-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and a conserved domain was elucidated that directly enabled us to identify a putative pagL gene in the R. etli CE3 genome (17Marchler-Bauer A. Lu S. Anderson J.B. Chitsaz F. Derbyshire M.K. DeWeese-Scott C. Fong J.H. Geer L.Y. Geer R.C. Gonzales N.R. Gwadz M. Hurwitz D.I. Jackson J.D. Ke Z. Lanczycki C.J. Lu F. Marchler G.H. Mullokandov M.

Therefore, we hypothesized that this gene is responsible for 3-O-deacylation of R. etli CE3 lipid A. In addition, we have identified R. etli CE3 PagL homologues in the genomes of a number of endosymbionts including Sinorhizobium meliloti, Sinorhizobium medicae, Sinorhizobium fredii, Rhizobium leguminosarum, R. etli, and Methylobacterium nodulans, as well as the plant pathogens of the genus Agrobacterium and the poplar tree endophyte Methylobacterium populi (18Altschul S.F.

In this study, we mutated the pagL gene via insertion mutagenesis in the model organism R. etli CE3 and determined its functional involvement in the 3-O-deacylation of lipid A. We further characterized the effect of the mutation on LPS synthesis and symbiosis with the host plant P. vulgaris. Bacterial strains and plasmids are described in Table 1.

PCR cloning was used to create a DNA fragment with the disrupted pagL gene and homologous flanking regions to be cloned into a suicide plasmid. Conjugal transfer of the constructed plasmid into R. etli CE3 was performed, and double recombinants were selected. Plasmid extractions, gel extractions, and PCR/enzyme cleanup was performed using Qiagen mini prep kits. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega. PCR reagent (iProofTM high fidelity polymerase) was purchased from Bio-Rad. A primer pair was engineered with XbaI (underlined) and BamHI (underlined) restriction sites (AGTCCTCAGACCGTTATTGCCGCTGT and AGTCGGATCCAGCTGTTGCTGCCAGC) to construct an ∼1.1-kb PCR product containing 225 bp of the pagL gene (5′ region) and 873 bp DNA upstream of the pagL gene. The PCR product was cloned into pUC18 to create plasmid pPagL-Up. A second PCR product was constructed using a primer pair engineered with BamHI (underlined) and XmaI (underlined) cloning sites to create an ∼1.5-kb product containing 239 bp of the pagL gene (3′ region) and 916 bp of downstream DNA. The product was cloned into pUC18 to create the plasmid pPagL-Dwn. The two inserts were tethered together by subcloning the insert from pPagL-Up into pPagL-Dwn (double digest with XbaI and BamHI) to create pPagL-UpDwn, which contained an insert region with upstream DNA, the pagL coding region (∼100-bp deletion near the center of the pagL gene), and downstream DNA. The center of the pagL region was engineered with a BamHI cloning site. The gentamicin-resistant cassette aacC1 from plasmid pMS255 (20Becker A. Schmidt M. Jäger W. Pühler A.

The insert from pPagL-UpGmDwn was subcloned into the suicide vector pEX18-Tc (21Hoang T.T. Karkhoff-Schweizer R.R. Kutchma A.J. Schweizer H.P.

The plasmid pPagL-KO was moved into R. etli CE3 via tri-parental mating as described previously (6Brown D.B. Huang Y.-C. Kannenberg E.L. Sherrier D.J. Carlson R.W.

A construct containing the pagL gene was created to complement the mutant strain. The pagL gene was PCR-cloned into plasmid pRK404E1 (22Lehman L.J. Fitzmaurice W.P. Roberts G.P. The cloning and functional characterization of the nifH gene of Rhodospirillum rubrum.Gene. 1990; 95: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) to create plasmid pRePagL using a forward primer engineered with a BamHI cloning site (underlined) and homologous DNA starting 14 bp upstream of the pagL gene (ATCGATGGATCCGCTTGGTGCGAATCAAAG). The reverse primer was engineered with an EcoRI cloning site (underlined) that recognized homologous DNA 30 bp downstream of the pagL coding region (ATCGATGAATTCGCAGGCTTTTCTCGTAAAG). The insert was oriented in parallel with the lac promoter of pRK404E1 to promote transcription. Plasmid pRePagL was moved into strain ODB31 via tri-parental mating as described above. All of the strains were verified by PCR with the above primers that were used to create pRePagL (see Fig. 1). In addition, the pagL gene containing the native promoter was PCR-cloned into the EcoRI and HindIII cloning sites of pRK404E1 using the primer set AAGTCAGAGAATTCCAGGAATTGACCGCAGGC and CATTAGGCAAGCTTGTGATCGGGATGGTGTTTGAA. The pagL gene was oriented anti-parallel to the pRK404E1 lac operon. Briefly, LPS was extracted by the hot water phenol extraction method (23Westphal O. Jann K. Endotoxins. Extraction with phenol-water and further applications of the procedure.Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 83-91Google Scholar) and dialyzed against deionized water using 12,000–14,000 molecular weight cutoff dialyzes bags and subsequently lyophilized. Composition of LPS was determined by GC/MS of trimethylsilyl-derived methyl glycosides and fatty acid methyl esters as described previously (10Bhat U.R. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W.

Lipid A was isolated by mild acid hydrolysis as described previously (25Ryan J.M. Conrad H.E. Structural heterogeneity in the lipopolysaccharide of Salmonella newington.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 162: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼5 mg of extracted LPS was treated with 1% acetic acid (100 °C, 1 h) to partition the lipid A. Partitioned Lipid A was separated by 3× chloroform/methanol/water (2:2:1.8, v/v/v) extraction. The lipid A containing chloroform layers were pooled and dried under a stream of air. Isolated lipid A was dissolved in a 3:1 (v/v) chloroform/methanol mixture, mixed 1:1 (v/v) with 2,4,6-trihydroxyacetophenone matrix and spotted on a MALDI plate. Spectra were acquired by a MALDI-TOF analyzer (Applied Biosystems, 5800) in the positive reflectron mode operating at a 20 kV extraction voltage.

A loop full of bacteria grown on TY agar medium was dissolved in 100 μl of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, and 10 mm EDTA) and incubated at 100 °C for 10 min to release LPS from the cell envelope. The sample was microcentrifuged (14,000 rpm) to pellet cell debris. The supernatant (containing LPS) was mixed 1:1 with sample loading buffer, and 2 μl was loaded for DOC-PAGE.

Then the beans were transferred to 0.8% tap water agar plates and germinated in the dark for 3 days at room temperature. The sprouts were transferred to sterile 500-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing a foam top, hydroponic beads immersed in defined, nitrogen-free liquid plant medium (Fahreus medium, (28Fahraeus G.

The plants were kept in a Conviron growth chamber and were maintained at 24 °C with 14 h of light and 20 °C with 10 h of darkness. Bacteria used as inoculants were grown to mid/late log phase in liquid TY medium containing appropriate antibiotics. The bacteria were pelleted, washed in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and resuspended to an approximate A of 0.15 (600 nm wave length). Then 1 ml of inoculate was added to the plants 11 days after germination. Plant phenotypes were observed and scored. The experiment was repeated three times. 30 plants per inoculate strain was used in one experiment, and 15 plants per inoculate strain was used in subsequent experiments. The plants were inoculated with appropriate strains as described above and assessed for their ability to fix nitrogen by the acetylene reduction assay as previously described (6Brown D.B. Huang Y.-C.

To identify the gene responsible for 3-O-deacylase activity in R. etli and study its function, the putative pagL gene was mutated. The putative pagL gene (accession number ABC91065.1) in R. etli CE3 (isogenic to R. etli CFN 42) is located on the chromosome and contains the conserved PagL catalytic domain (16Rutten L. Geurtsen J.

The pagL− mutant was created via insertion mutagenesis as described under “Experimental Procedures” and was given the strain name R. etli ODB31. To validate phenotypic differences observed between the mutant and parent strain, the mutant ODB31 was complemented with the native pagL gene from parent strain CE3 (Fig. 1). To study differences between parent and mutant strain LPS, the composition of each LPS was determined. The LPS of R. etli CE3 has been studied extensively, and its structure is known (4Carlson R.W.

When compared with parent strain CE3, the mutant ODB31 contained the known glycosyl residues found in the O-chain polysaccharide (GlcA, N-acetylquinovosamine, 3-O-methyl-6-deoxytalose, Man, and fucose), the core (Man, Gal, galacturonic acid, and 3-deoxy-d-manno-2 octulosonic acid), and lipid A (GlcN and galacturonic acid). In addition, the DOC-PAGE profiles of parent and mutant LPS displayed similar banding patterns (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the mutant maintained the general carbohydrate structure as the parent strain LPS. The removal of fatty acids by PagL produces LPS with a lower molecular weight. Because the mutant does not have a functional PagL, the LPS molecules migrate at a slightly higher molecular weight when compared with parent and complemented strain (Fig. 2). Mass spectroscopic analysis of mutant ODB31 lipid A was performed to characterize the loss of 3-O-deacylase activity on its structure. The spectra are shown in Fig. 3, and proposed compositions for the various ions are listed in Table 2. The spectrum obtained from parent strain lipid A (Fig. 3, panel I) contains two major ion groups, each displaying a mixture of microheterogenous ions. Microheterogeneity occurs because of variation in acyl chain length (±28 mass units [C2H4] or ±14 mass units [CH2]), the presence of β-hydroxybutyryl group (± 86) at the C27 position of 27-hydroxyoctacosanoic acid, and the oxidation of the proximal glucosamine to 2-aminogluconoate (± 16). The higher molecular weight ion group, m/z 1914–2022, represents penta-acylated lipid A, whereas the lower molecular weight ion group, m/z 1624–1774, represents tetra-acylated lipid A. Two forms of tetraacylated lipid A are present. One form is an artifact of the isolation process caused by the acid-catalyzed β-elimination of the 3-O linked primary fatty acid during the mild acid hydrolysis procedure as reported by Que et al.

https://openalex.org/W2033154087,"Yellowtail ascites virus (YAV) is an aquabirnavirus that causes ascites in yellowtail, a fish often used in sushi. Segment A of the YAV genome codes for a polyprotein (pVP2-VP4-VP3), where processing by its own VP4 protease yields the capsid protein precursor pVP2, the ribonucleoprotein-forming VP3, and free VP4. VP4 protease utilizes the rarely observed serine-lysine catalytic dyad mechanism. Here we have confirmed the existence of an internal cleavage site, preceding the VP4/VP3 cleavage site. The resulting C-terminally truncated enzyme (ending at Ala(716)) is active, as shown by a trans full-length VP4 cleavage assay and a fluorometric peptide cleavage assay. We present a crystal structure of a native active site YAV VP4 with the internal cleavage site trapped as trans product complexes and trans acyl-enzyme complexes. The acyl-enzyme complexes confirm directly the role of Ser(633) as the nucleophile. A crystal structure of the lysine general base mutant (K674A) reveals the acyl-enzyme and empty binding site states of VP4, which allows for the observation of structural changes upon substrate or product binding. These snapshots of three different stages in the VP4 protease reaction mechanism will aid in the design of anti-birnavirus compounds, provide insight into previous site-directed mutagenesis results, and contribute to understanding of the serine-lysine dyad protease mechanism. In addition, we have discovered that this protease contains a channel that leads from the enzyme surface (adjacent to the substrate binding groove) to the active site and the deacylating water."
