https://openalex.org/W1852530796,"Participation of the small, intrinsically disordered protein α-synuclein (α-syn) in Parkinson disease (PD) pathogenesis has been well documented. Although recent research demonstrates the involvement of α-syn in mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegeneration and suggests direct interaction of α-syn with mitochondria, the molecular mechanism(s) of α-syn toxicity and its effect on neuronal mitochondria remain vague. Here we report that at nanomolar concentrations, α-syn reversibly blocks the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), the major channel of the mitochondrial outer membrane that controls most of the metabolite fluxes in and out of the mitochondria. Detailed analysis of the blockage kinetics of VDAC reconstituted into planar lipid membranes suggests that α-syn is able to translocate through the channel and thus target complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Supporting our in vitro experiments, a yeast model of PD shows that α-syn toxicity in yeast depends on VDAC. The functional interactions between VDAC and α-syn, revealed by the present study, point toward the long sought after physiological and pathophysiological roles for monomeric α-syn in PD and in other α-synucleinopathies."

Kinetic studies indicate that in contrast to 3CLpro from other β-CoV 2c members, including HKU4 and HKU5, MERS-CoV 3CLpro is less efficient at processing a peptide substrate due to MERS-CoV 3CLpro being a weakly associated dimer. Conversely, HKU4, HKU5, and SARS-CoV 3CLpro enzymes are tightly associated dimers. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies support that MERS-CoV 3CLpro is a weakly associated dimer (Kd ∼52 μm) with a slow off-rate. Peptidomimetic inhibitors of MERS-CoV 3CLpro were synthesized and utilized in analytical ultracentrifugation experiments and demonstrate that MERS-CoV 3CLpro undergoes significant ligand-induced dimerization. Kinetic studies also revealed that designed reversible inhibitors act as activators at a low compound concentration as a result of induced dimerization. Primary sequence comparisons and x-ray structural analyses of two MERS-CoV 3CLpro and inhibitor complexes, determined to 1.6 Å, reveal remarkable structural similarity of the dimer interface with 3CLpro from HKU4-CoV and HKU5-CoV. Despite this structural similarity, substantial differences in the dimerization ability suggest that long range interactions by the nonconserved amino acids distant from the dimer interface may control MERS-CoV 3CLpro dimerization. Activation of MERS-CoV 3CLpro through ligand-induced dimerization appears to be unique within the genogroup 2c and may potentially increase the complexity in the development of MERS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors as antiviral agents.

https://openalex.org/W575178529,"Our dependence on fossil fuel sources and concern about the environment has generated a worldwide interest in establishing new sources of fuel and energy. Thus, the use of ethanol as a fuel is advantageous because it is an inexhaustible energy source and has minimal environmental impact. Currently, Brazil is the world's second largest producer of ethanol, which is produced from sugarcane juice fermentation. However, several studies suggest that Brazil could double its production per hectare by using sugarcane bagasse and straw, known as second-generation (2G) bioethanol. Nevertheless, the use of this biomass presents a challenge because the plant cell wall structure, which is composed of complex sugars (cellulose and hemicelluloses), must be broken down into fermentable sugar, such as glucose and xylose. To achieve this goal, several types of hydrolytic enzymes are necessary, and these enzymes represent the majority of the cost associated with 2G bioethanol processing. Reducing the cost of the saccharification process can be achieved via a comprehensive understanding of the hydrolytic mechanisms and enzyme secretion of polysaccharide-hydrolyzing microorganisms. In many natural habitats, several microorganisms degrade lignocellulosic biomass through a set of enzymes that act synergistically. In this study, two fungal species, Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma reesei, were grown on sugarcane biomass with two levels of cell wall complexity, culm in natura and pretreated bagasse. The production of enzymes related to biomass degradation was monitored using secretome analyses after 6, 12 and 24 hours. Concurrently, we analyzed the sugars in the supernatant.Analyzing the concentration of monosaccharides in the supernatant, we observed that both species are able to disassemble the polysaccharides of sugarcane cell walls since 6 hours post-inoculation. The sugars from the polysaccharides such as arabinoxylan and β-glucan (that compose the most external part of the cell wall in sugarcane) are likely the first to be released and assimilated by both species of fungi. At all time points tested, A. niger produced more enzymes (quantitatively and qualitatively) than T. reesei. However, the most important enzymes related to biomass degradation, including cellobiohydrolases, endoglucanases, β-glucosidases, β-xylosidases, endoxylanases, xyloglucanases, and α-arabinofuranosidases, were identified in both secretomes. We also noticed that the both fungi produce more enzymes when grown in culm as a single carbon source.Our work provides a detailed qualitative and semi-quantitative secretome analysis of A. niger and T. reesei grown on sugarcane biomass. Our data indicate that a combination of enzymes from both fungi is an interesting option to increase saccharification efficiency. In other words, these two fungal species might be combined for their usage in industrial processes."

This membrane protein complex contains at least 17 protein subunits in higher plants (1Amunts A. Toporik H. Borovikova A. Nelson N.

In cyanobacteria under standard laboratory growth conditions, PS I is present as a trimer, receiving excitation energy from the phycobilisomes and the interior PS I antennae chlorophyll array associated with the core PsaA and PsaB proteins (2Chitnis P.R.

Under iron-limiting conditions, the phycobilisomes are degraded and PS I receives excitation energy from the IsiA antenna protein complex, which is organized as a ring of 18 IsiA subunits surrounding the PS I trimer (4Burnap R.L.

In higher plants and Chlamydomonas, PS I is present as a monomer. Excitation energy is delivered to the reaction center by an array of intrinsic light-harvesting chlorophyll proteins (LHCs). Four LHC proteins are present in higher plants (Lhca1–Lhca4), whereas nine are present in Chlamydomonas (Lhca1–Lhca9). The higher plant crystal structure of PS I indicates that the Lhca1–Lhca4 proteins are localized to one side of the PS I core complex (1Amunts A. Toporik H. Borovikova A. Nelson N.

During state 1 to state 2 transitions in higher plants, a subpopulation of the LHC proteins believed to be normally associated with the PS II complex can dissociate and become associated with PS I, forming a PS I-LHC II supercomplex (for review see Ref. 7Croce R. van Amerongen H. Light-harvesting in Photosystem I.Photosyn. Res. 2013; 116: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These supercomplexes are typically observed during blue native gel electrophoresis in the presence of low concentrations of the detergents dodecyl maltoside and/or digitonin, or can be isolated in low yield by ultracentrifugation on sucrose density gradients after membrane solubilization with these detergents (8Qin X.

It is unclear, however, if this low apparent yield is physiologically representative of the abundance of the PS I-LHC II supercomplex or if this supercomplex is unstable in the presence of detergent. It has been proposed that a significant amount of LHC II is associated with PS I even under State 1 conditions (9Galka P. Santabarbara S. Khuong T.T. Degand H. Morsomme P. Jennings R.C. Boekema E.J.

Croce R. LHCII is an antenna of both photosystems after long-term acclimation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1827: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These results indicate that up to 40–65% of the PS I solubilized by digitonin from thylakoids is associated with a single LHC II trimer. It has been suggested that, under long day/high light intensity growth conditions, PS I can become acclimatized and associate constitutively with LHC II (10Wientjes E. van Amerongen H. Croce R. LHCII is an antenna of both photosystems after long-term acclimation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1827: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Interestingly, during state 1 to state 2 transitions in Chlamydomonas, a large proportion of the LHC II antenna, including CP29 and, possibly, CP26, as well as multiple LHC II trimers associate with PS I (11Drop B.

Recently, the use of detergent-less solubilization procedures for membrane proteins has found increasing interest (for reviews see Refs. 13Raschle T. Hiller S. Etzkorn M. Wagner G.

This material forms nanodiscs, which are ∼100 Å in diameter when mixed with artificial phospholipid bilayers (16Orwick M.C. Judge P.J. Procek J. Lindholm L. Graziadei A. Engel A. Gröbner G. Watts A.

Engl. 2012; 51: 4653-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Solubilization of biological membranes with SMA yields similarly sized nanodiscs containing both membrane lipids and membrane proteins. Interestingly, the lipid profile of these nanodiscs is very similar, if not identical, to the lipid profile of the solubilized membrane (17Long A.R. O'Brien C.C. Malhotra K. Schwall C.T. Albert A.D.

This material has been used to solubilize bacteriorhodopsin, which had been incorporated into DMPC vesicles (19Orwick-Rydmark M. Lovett J.E. Graziadei A. Lindholm L. Hicks M.R. Watts A. Detergent-free incorporation of a seven-transmembrane receptor protein into nanosized bilayer lipodisq particles for functional and biophysical studies.Nano Lett. 2012; 12: 4687-4692Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and mitochondrial membranes, with cytochrome oxidase being incorporated into the SMA nanodiscs (17Long A.R.

A detergent-free strategy for the reconstitution of active enzyme complexes from native biological membranes into nanoscale discs.BMC Biotechnol. 2013; 13: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recently, the bacterial reaction center from Rhodobacter sphaeroides has also been solubilized using these methods (18Swainsbury D.J. Scheidelaar S. van Grondelle R. Killian J.A. Jones M.R. Bacterial reaction centers purified with styrene maleic acid copolymer retain native membrane functional properties and display enhanced stability.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2014; 53: 11803-11807Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A generalized molecular model for the solubilization of biological membranes with SMA has also been presented (15Scheidelaar S. Koorengevel M.C. Pardo J.D. Meeldijk J.D. Breukink E. Killian J.A. Molecular model for the solubilization of membranes into nanodisks by styrene maleic acid copolymers.Biophys. J. 2015; 108: 279-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, it was proposed that initially the SMA binds to the biological membrane in a process driven by the hydrophobic interaction between the styrene groups and the lipid acyl chains. This is followed by insertion of the SMA into the lipid bilayer, which leads to destabilization of the membrane. Finally, nanodisc formation occurs, with the SMA located on the periphery of the nanodisc, with the styrene groups being oriented between the acyl chains of the membrane lipid. It should be noted that membrane protein complexes with diameters larger than about 100 Å would not be expected to be solubilized efficiently into SMA nanodiscs. Interestingly, the PS I complex exhibits dimensions of ∼140 × 180 Å when measured at the surface of the thylakoid membrane (1Amunts A. Toporik H. Borovikova A. Nelson N. Structure determination and improved model of plant Photosystem I.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 3478-3486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Consequently, it would not be expected for either the PS I complex, or larger PS I supercomplexes containing LHC II to be incorporated into nanodiscs during the SMA solubilization of thylakoid membranes. In this article we report the isolation of a thylakoid membrane fragment preparation highly enriched in a PS I-LHC II supercomplex, which was obtained after stacked thylakoid membranes were solubilized with SMA. Thylakoids were isolated from market spinach by blending in a buffer containing 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.4, 0.45 m sorbitol, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% BSA, and 1% polyvinylpyrolidone. The homogenate was filtered through two layers of cheesecloth and one layer of Miracloth (Calbiochemical Co.) and the thylakoids were pelleted at 2,500 × g for 5 min. After washing twice in a wash buffer containing 0.3 m sorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.6, the thylakoids were resuspended in the same buffer at 3.0 mg of Chl/ml. This suspension was brought to 3% styrene-maleic acid copolymer from a 25.6% stock solution (SMA® 3000HNa, a kind gift from Cray Valley USA LLC) and incubated for 20 min on ice in the dark with occasional stirring. The solubilized thylakoids were then centrifuged at 34,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was carefully removed and filtered through a 0.2-μm filter (Millipore Corp.) and then applied to 10–20% sucrose density gradients prepared in wash buffer. After centrifugation for 18 h at 100,000 × g (Beckman SW 28 rotor), two chlorophyll-containing bands, B1 and B2, were carefully removed from the gradient and the pellet, which is the subject of this article, was resuspended in wash buffer at 1 mg of Chl ml−1. For gel filtration analysis, the resuspended pellet was applied to a Sepharose 6B column (3 × 90 cm) that had been previously equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, and 20 mm NaCl. For analytical separations, 1 ml of the pellet suspension was applied to the column; for preparative separations the volume was 5 ml. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a total run volume of 500 ml. One chlorophyll-containing band was observed, which was then concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration. In some experiments, the pellet suspension was solubilized with 1% β-d-dodecyl maltoside (DM) for 15 min and then applied to the same gel filtration column that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, and 0.03% DM. In these experiments, two chlorophyll-containing bands were observed; these were designated SB1 and SB2 and the appropriate fractions were concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration. It should be noted that this procedure works very poorly for Arabidopsis thylakoids for reasons, at this point in time, we cannot explain. Solubilized chlorophyll yield is extremely low and the putative PS I-LHC II membranes obtained after ultracentrifugation contain significant contamination from other thylakoid membrane protein complexes. Measurements of steady state P700 oxidation and reduction were performed with the JTS-10 kinetic spectrometer (Bio-Logic Science Instruments) in absorbance mode using the “pulse of dark” method. Either spinach leaves or liquid phase samples (20–50 μg of Chl/ml) were incubated in the dark for 5 min prior to each measurement. Samples were illuminated and the absorbance changes at 705 nm were monitored to assess the oxidation of the PS I P700 reaction center during illumination, followed by reduction of P700+ in the subsequent dark period. To specifically excite PS I and the LHC I antenna, a 720-nm actinic light source was used (1,400 μmol of photons m−2 s−1). To excite LHC II as well as PS I-LHC I, a broadband orange light source with a peak of 630 nm was used (940 μmol of photons m−2 s−1). Data were analyzed using Origin version 8.1 and proprietary software provided by Bio-Logic Scientific Instruments. Fluorescence measurements at room temperature and at 77 K were collected on a home-built fluorometer. Excitation at 470 nm was provided with a band pass filter, which delivered 80 μmol of photons m−2 s−1 at the sample cuvette. The detector was protected by a 550–800-nm long pass filter. The fluorescence emission from 650 to 800 nm was detected with a concave grating spectrometer and CCD detector (StellarNet Black Comet®) with an integration time of 100 ms per spectrum with 10 spectra averaged per measurement. The spectra were background corrected and normalized. For the 77 K measurements, samples were suspended in 20% glycerol, 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, and 20 mm NaCl at 10 μg of Chl/ml. For room temperature measurements the glycerol was omitted. PS I electron transport was performed by polarography (Hansatech Co.). The assay buffer contained 100 mm sorbitol, 50 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaCl, 5 mm sodium ascorbate, 100 μm 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, 50 μm methyl viologen, 20 μm 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, and 10 mm KCN. Illumination was provided by a computer-controlled red light-emitting diode array. Native electrophoresis in the absence of detergent was performed in a 1% agarose gel (agarose I-B, low EEO, Sigma Co.) in a horizontal apparatus and using a continuous buffer (0.05 m BisTris-NaOH, pH 7.0) for 3–4 h at 4 °C. Lithium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed under conditions described by Delepelaire and Chua (20Delepelaire P. Chua N.

The resolved polypeptides were electroblotted onto PVDF membranes (Immobilon-P®, Millipore Corp.). After blocking for 2 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in TS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), the blots were washed extensively with TS buffer and then incubated with diluted primary antibody in TS buffer + 1% bovine serum albumin overnight. This was followed by washing in TS buffer and incubation with either anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) diluted in TS buffer + 1% bovine serum albumin for 2–4 h. After washing with TS buffer, the labeled protein was detected using either chemiluminescence (SuperSignal® West Pico, Pierce Chemical Co.) or 4-chloro-1-napthol. Cytochrome f was detected directly by chemiluminescence (22Feissner R. Xiang Y. Kranz R.G. Chemiluminescent-based methods to detect subpicomole levels of c-type cytochromes.Anal.

Two low density bands were partially resolved and are labeled B1 and B2 and a dense pellet (P) was also observed. P appeared to be an unsolubilized membrane fraction. A similar pattern was observed using non-detergent electrophoresis in 1% agarose of these three fractions (Fig. 1B). B1 and B2 were both present as rapidly migrating species, whereas P exhibited significantly slower migration. It should be noted that the pore size of 1% agarose has been estimated to be 200–400 nm (23Pernodet N. Maaloum M. Tinland B.

In comparison to thylakoids, P is highly depleted of proteins in the 28–60 kDa region, exhibiting major bands at 65–72 kDa (PsaA/PsaB), 22–26 kDa (light-harvesting chlorophyll proteins) with numerous lower mass proteins in the 10–22 kDa region. Most of the proteins enriched in PS II membranes are depleted in P, and vice versa. The principal exception is a strong light-harvesting chlorophyll protein band that is abundant in both P and BBY samples. Upon comparison of the polypeptide profile of P with published examples of PS I preparations (26Bruce B.D. Malkin R. Subunit stoichiometry of the chloroplast Photosystem I complex.J. Biol.

Recently, the isolation of detergent-solubilized PSI-LHC II particles has been reported (9Galka P. Santabarbara S. Khuong T.T. Degand H. Morsomme P. Jennings R.C. Boekema E.J. Caffarri S.

Croce R. LHCII is an antenna of both photosystems after long-term acclimation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1827: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These preparations contain, in addition to the PS I core and LHC I antennae components, LHC II. The polypeptide profiles of these preparations are very similar to that which we observe for the P material, although we observe a higher apparent yield of light-harvesting chlorophyll proteins in our preparation. “Western” blots (Fig. 1D) were used to examine a number of specific proteins associated with PS II (PsbA and Lhcb1), the cytochrome b6/f complex (PetA), CF1-CFo (AtpB), and PS I (PsaB and Lhca1). P is highly depleted of PsbA, PetA, and AtpB, indicating that this membrane fraction contains little PS II, cytochrome b6/f complex, or CF1-CFo, respectively. P is enriched in PsaB and Lhca1 and additionally contains a large amount of Lhcb1. We will present evidence that the P is a PSI-LHC II-enriched membrane fraction. Fig. 2 illustrates a Sepharose 6B (exclusion limit ≈5 × 106 daltons) separation of the putative PSI-LHC II membranes that migrate as a sharp symmetrical green band (Fig. 2A) eluting in fraction 27; blue dextran with a molecular mass of 2 × 106 elutes in fraction 30 (data not shown). This indicates that the putative PSI-LHC II membranes exhibit a higher apparent molecular mass than the blue dextran. Analysis of the polypeptide pattern of fractions obtained from the Sepharose 6B column shows that the protein makeup of the putative PSI-LHC II membranes was the same both before and after fractionation on Sepharose 6B (Fig. 2B). This indicates that both the PS I-associated proteins and the LHC II are both present in a high molecular mass fraction. If the putative PSI-LHC II membranes are solubilized with 1% DM and fractionated on the same Sepharose 6B column (previously equilibrated with a 0.03% DM-containing buffer) a very different pattern is observed. Two partially resolved green peaks are observed and these elute significantly later than do the putative PSI-LHC II membranes (in the absence of detergent). This indicates that both green bands exhibit lower apparent molecular mass than the putative PSI-LHC II membranes (Fig. 2A). Because these bands were only partially resolved, the leading and trailing edges of these peaks (labeled SB1 and SB2, respectively) were harvested and concentrated by ultrafiltration. In Fig. 2B, the polypeptide pattern of these fractions (thylakoids (T), the putative PSI-LHC II membranes (P), and the putative PSI-LHC II membranes after Sepharose 6B chromatography (PS), SB1 and SB2) are shown loaded on a constant Chl basis. Comparison of the putative PSI-LHC II membranes (P and PS) to the green fractions obtained after DM treatment indicated that the SB1 fraction is depleted of light-harvesting chlorophyll proteins and enriched in the 65–75-kDa polypeptides and lower apparent mass bands in the 10–20 kDa range. The SB2 fraction is depleted of the 65–75-kDa polypeptides and most of the proteins in the 10–20-kDa region, whereas being enriched in the light-harvesting chlorophyll proteins. Western blot analysis of these fractions is illustrated in Fig. 2C. Antibodies against PsaB were used to identify fractions containing the reaction center of PS I, antibodies against Lhca1 were used to identify fractions containing the LHC I antenna, and antibodies against Lhcb1 were used to identify fractions containing the LHC II antenna. It should be noted that Lhcb1 has been identified as a mobile component of the LHC II antennae, which has been considered to be normally associated with PS II. The thylakoids and both putative PSI-LHC II membrane fractions (P and PS) contain PsaB, Lhca1, and Lhcb1. The SB1 fraction is enriched in PsaB and Lhca1 and contains no detectable Lhcb1, whereas the SB2 fraction is highly depleted of PsaB, containing principally Lhcb1 and a smaller amount of Lhca1. These results indicate that the putative PSI-LHC II membranes contain the PS I reaction center and components of the LHC I and LHC II antennae. After detergent treatment the LHC II antennae component dissociate from the putative PSI-LHC II membranes, yielding SB1, an apparent PS I-LHC I detergent complex. Because the putative PSI-LHC II membranes contain all three components (PS I, LHC I, and LHC II), they appear to be localized in a non-detergent-containing putative PS I-LHC II supercomplex. However, if this is the case, then a functional association of LHC II with the PS I-LHC I complex must be demonstrated. To examine the association of the LHC II antenna with PS I we examined both room temperature and 77 K fluorescence emission spectra. These results are illustrated in Fig. 3. Typical room temperature fluorescence is shown in Fig. 3A. Thylakoids exhibit a peak at 685.5 nm with a pronounced shoulder in the 725–750 nm region, as has previously been reported in the supporting material (29van Oort B. Alberts M. de Bianchi S.

Comparative transcriptome analysis of white and purple cultivars was carried out using high-throughput RNA sequencing in order to further understand the mechanism of anthocyanin biosynthesis in potato.By aligning transcript reads to the recently published diploid potato genome and de novo assembly, 209 million paired-end Illumina RNA-seq reads from these tetraploid cultivars were assembled on to 60,930 transcripts, of which 27,754 (45.55%) are novel transcripts and 9393 alternative transcripts. Using a comparison of the RNA-sequence datasets, multiple versions of the genes encoding anthocyanin biosynthetic steps and regulatory transcription factors were identified. Other novel genes potentially involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis in potato tubers were also discovered. Real-time qPCR validation of candidate genes revealed good correlation with the transcriptome data. SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) and indels were predicted and validated for the transcription factors MYB AN1 and bHLH1 and the biosynthetic gene anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT).These results contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanism of white and purple potato development, by identifying differential responses of biosynthetic gene family members together with the variation in structural genes and transcription factors in this highly heterozygous crop.

https://openalex.org/W2118403836,"Aldosterone exerts its effects mainly by activating the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), a transcription factor that regulates gene expression through complex and dynamic interactions with coregulators and transcriptional machinery, leading to fine-tuned control of vectorial ionic transport in the distal nephron. To identify genome-wide aldosterone-regulated MR targets in human renal cells, we set up a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay by using a specific anti-MR antibody in a differentiated human renal cell line expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-MR. This approach, coupled with high-throughput sequencing, allowed identification of 974 genomic MR targets. Computational analysis identified an MR response element (MRE) including single or multiple half-sites and palindromic motifs in which the AGtACAgxatGTtCt sequence was the most prevalent motif. Most genomic MR-binding sites (MBSs) are located >10 kb from the transcriptional start sites of target genes (84%). Specific aldosterone-induced recruitment of MR on the first most relevant genomic sequences was further validated by ChIP-quantitative (q)PCR and correlated with concomitant and positive aldosterone-activated transcriptional regulation of the corresponding gene, as assayed by RT-qPCR. It was notable that most MBSs lacked MREs but harbored DNA recognition motifs for other transcription factors (FOX, EGR1, AP1, PAX5) suggesting functional interaction. This work provides new insights into aldosterone MR-mediated renal signaling and opens relevant perspectives for mineralocorticoid-related pathophysiology."

Methods This is a cross-sectional questionnaire survey of 250 matched patient caregiver dyads across three large ophthalmic treatment centres in United Kingdom. The primary outcome was the subjective caregiver burden measured using caregiver reaction assessment scale (CRA). Objective caregiver burden was determined by the caregiver tasks and level of care provided. The factors that may predict the caregiver burden such as the patient’s visual acuity of the better eye and vision related quality of life, demographics, satisfaction and support provided by the healthcare and the health status of the dyads were also collected and assessed in a hierarchical regression model. Results The mean CRA score was 3.2±0.5, similar to the score reported by caregivers for atrial fibrillation who require regular hospital appointments for monitoring their thromboprophylaxis. Caregiver tasks including accompanying for hospital appointments for eye treatment and patient’s visual acuity in the better eye were the biggest contributors to the caregiver burden hierarchical model explaining 18% and 11% of the variance respectively. Conclusion Ranibizumab therapy for nAMD is associated with significant caregiver burden. Both disease impact and treatment frequency contributed to the overall burden."
https://openalex.org/W1874970247,"High levels of aldosterone impair renal function by activating proinflammatory and profibrotic pathways. However, the molecular mechanism underlying aldosterone-induced inflammation and fibrosis is unknown. Inflammasome activation contributes to chronic kidney disease. We hypothesized that aldosterone induces renal tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis by activating the inflammasome. Infusing wild-type mice with aldosterone (0.25 mg/kg/d) caused tubulointerstitial damage, increased expression of inflammasome components, caspase 1 activation, and overproduction of IL-1β and IL-18. These changes were suppressed by eplerenone treatment (100 mg/kg/d) in wild-type mice or in mice deficient in apoptosis-associated speck-like protein with a caspase-recruitment domain (ASC). Caspase 1-positive and F4/80-positive cells colocalized in the interstitium. Bone marrow transplantation using ASC-deficient mice indicated that inflammasome activation in macrophages mediated aldosterone-induced renal fibrosis. IL-18 was detected in culture supernatants of macrophages treated with aldosterone, and mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species activated the inflammasome in these macrophages. Our results indicate that exposure of macrophages to high levels of aldosterone resulted in the activation of inflammasomes via the mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species. Thus, inflammasome activation in macrophages may serve as a new therapeutic target for chronic kidney disease."

The experiment consisted of combinations of synthetic nitrogen (N), vinasse (V; a liquid waste from ethanol production), and sugarcane-straw blankets. Increases in CO2-C and N2O-N emissions were identified shortly after the addition of both N and V to the soils, thus increasing MB nitrogen (MB-N) and decreasing MB carbon (MB-C) in the N+V-amended soils and altering soil chemical factors that were correlated with the MB. Across 57 soil metagenomic datasets, Actinobacteria (31.5%), Planctomycetes (12.3%), Deltaproteobacteria (12.3%), Alphaproteobacteria (12.0%) and Betaproteobacteria (11.1%) were the most dominant bacterial groups during the experiment. Differences in relative abundance of metagenomic sequences were mainly revealed for Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia with regard to N+V fertilization and straw retention. Differential abundances in bacterial groups were confirmed using 16S rRNA gene-targeted phylum-specific primers for real-time PCR analysis in all soil samples, whose results were in accordance with sequence data, except for Gammaproteobacteria. Actinobacteria were more responsive to straw retention with Rubrobacterales, Bifidobacteriales and Actinomycetales related to the chemical factors of N+V-amended soils. Acidobacteria subgroup 7 and Opitutae, a verrucomicrobial class, were related to the chemical factors of soils without straw retention as a surface blanket. Taken together, the results showed that MB-C and MB-N responded to changes in soil chemical factors and CO2-C and N2O-N emissions, especially for N+V-amended soils. The results also indicated that several taxonomic groups of bacteria, such as Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia, and their subgroups acted as early-warning indicators of N+V amendments and straw retention in sugarcane-cultivated soils, which can alter the soil chemical factors."

https://openalex.org/W582787109,"Phytoremediation is a promising means of ameliorating heavy metal pollution through the use of transgenic plants as artificial hyperaccumulators. A novel Streptococcus thermophilus γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase (StGCS-GS) that synthesizes glutathione (GSH) with limited feedback inhibition was overexpressed in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), yielding three transgenic lines (s2, s4 and s5) with enhanced tolerance to different concentrations of cadmium, zinc and copper, as indicated by their increased biomass, root length and relative growth compared with wild-type plants. Transgenic sugar beets accumulated more Cd, Zn and Cu ions in shoots than wild-type, as well as higher GSH and phytochelatin (PC) levels under different heavy metal stresses. This enhanced heavy metal tolerance and increased accumulation were likely due to the increased expression of StGCS-GS and consequent overproduction of both GSH and PC. Furthermore, when multiple heavy metal ions were present at the same time, transgenic sugar beets overexpressing StGCS-GS resisted two or three of the metal combinations (50 μM Cd-Zn, Cd-Cu, Zn-Cu and Cd-Zn-Cu), with greater absorption in shoots. Additionally, there was no obvious competition between metals. Overall, the results demonstrate the explicit role of StGCS-GS in enhancing Cd, Zn and Cu tolerance and accumulation in transgenic sugar beet, which may represent a highly promising new tool for phytoremediation."
https://openalex.org/W1479760774,"Class IIa histone deacetylases repress transcription of target genes. However, their mechanism of action is poorly understood because they exhibit very low levels of deacetylase activity. The class IIa HDACs are associated with the SMRT/NCoR repression complexes and this may, at least in part, account for their repressive activity. However, the molecular mechanism of recruitment to co-repressor proteins has yet to be established. Here we show that a repeated peptide motif present in both SMRT and NCoR is sufficient to mediate specific interaction, with micromolar affinity, with all the class IIa HDACs (HDACs 4, 5, 7, and 9). Mutations in the consensus motif abrogate binding. Mutational analysis of HDAC4 suggests that the peptide interacts in the vicinity of the active site of the enzyme and requires the ""closed"" conformation of the zinc-binding loop on the surface of the enzyme. Together these findings represent the first insights into the molecular mechanism of recruitment of class IIa HDACs to the SMRT/NCoR repression complexes."

Clinical symptoms of NRH may vary from absence of symptoms to full-blown (non-cirrhotic) portal hypertension. However, diagnosing NRH is challenging. The objective of this study was to determine inter- and intraobserver agreement on the histopathologic diagnosis of NRH.Liver specimens (n=48) previously diagnosed as NRH, were reviewed for the presence of NRH by seven pathologists without prior knowledge of the original diagnosis or clinical background. The majority of the liver specimens were from thiopurine using inflammatory bowel disease patients. Histopathologic features contributing to NRH were also assessed. Criteria for NRH were modified by consensus and subsequently validated. Interobserver agreement was evaluated by using the standard kappa index.After review, definite NRH, inconclusive NRH and no NRH were found in 35% (23-40%), 21% (13-27%) and 44% (38-56%), respectively (median, IQR). The median interobserver agreement for NRH was poor (κ = 0.20, IQR 0.14-0.28). The intraobserver variability on NRH ranged between 14% and 71%. After modification of the criteria and exclusion of biopsies with technical shortcomings, the interobserver agreement on the diagnosis NRH was fair (κ = 0.45).The interobserver agreement on the histopathologic diagnosis of NRH was poor, even when assessed by well-experienced liver pathologists. Modification of the criteria of NRH based on consensus effort and exclusion of biopsies of poor quality led to a fairly increased interobserver agreement. The main conclusion of this study is that NRH is a clinicopathologic diagnosis that cannot reliably be based on histopathology alone."

As some of the Methylobacterium species are known to promote plant growth, significant attention has been paid to the mechanism of growth promotion and the specificity of plant-microbe interactions. By screening our Methylobacterium isolate collection for the high growth promotion effect in vitro, we selected some candidates for field and pot growth tests for rice and barley, respectively. We found that inoculation resulted in better ripening of rice seeds, and increased the size of barley grains but not the total yield. In addition, using whole-cell matrix-assister laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) analysis, we identified and classified Methylobacterium isolates from Methylobacterium-inoculated rice plants. The inoculated species could not be recovered from the rice plants, and in some cases, the Methylobacterium community structure was affected by the inoculation, but not with predomination of the inoculated species. The isolates from non-inoculated barley of various cultivars grown in the same field fell into just two species. These results suggest that there is a strong selection pressure at the species level of Methylobacterium residing on a given plant species, and that selection of appropriate species that can persist on the plant is important to achieve growth promotion."
https://openalex.org/W1956830384,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) down-regulate gene expression and have vital roles in biology but their functions in the parathyroid are unexplored. To study this, we generated parathyroid-specific Dicer1 knockout (PT-Dicer(-/-) ) mice where parathyroid miRNA maturation is blocked. Remarkably, the PT-Dicer(-/-) mice did not increase serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) in response to acute hypocalcemia compared with the >5-fold increase in controls. PT-Dicer(-/-) glands cultured in low-calcium medium secreted 5-fold less PTH at 1.5 h than controls. Chronic hypocalcemia increased serum PTH >4-fold less in PT-Dicer(-/-) mice compared with control mice with no increase in PTH mRNA levels and parathyroid cell proliferation compared with the 2- to 3-fold increase in hypocalcemic controls. Moreover, uremic PT-Dicer(-/-) mice increased serum PTH and FGF23 significantly less than uremic controls. Therefore, stimulation of the parathyroid by both hypocalcemia and uremia is dependent upon intact dicer function and miRNAs. In contrast, the PT-Dicer(-/-) mice responded normally to activation of the parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor (Casr) by both hypercalcemia and a calcimimetic that decreases PTH secretion, demonstrating that they are dicer-independent. Therefore, miRNAs are essential for the response of the parathyroid to both acute and chronic hypocalcemia and uremia, the major stimuli for PTH secretion."

The OTC was studied at concentrations of 10, 25 and 40 mg L(-1). At 40 mg L(-1), the breakthrough point was reached after approximately 10 minutes, while at 10 and 25 mg L(-1) this point was reached in about 30 minutes. The highest removal rate of 60% for the 10 mg L(-1) concentration was reached after 200 minutes. The highest adsorption capacity (28.3 mg g(-1)) was attained for 25 mg L(-1) of OTC. After the adsorption process, a band shift was observed in the UV-Vis spectrum of the eluate. Additional studies were carried out to determine the cause of this band shift, involving a mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of the supernatant liquid during the process. This investigation revealed that the main route of adsorption consisted of the coordination of OTC with the metallic zinc centers of ZIF-8. The materials were characterized by thermal analysis (TA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), and infrared spectroscopy (IR) before and after adsorption, confirming the presence of OTC in the ZIF-8 and the latter's structural stability after the adsorption process."
https://openalex.org/W590071134,"Lectins are non-immunoglobulin carbohydrate-binding proteins without enzymatic activity towards the bound carbohydrates. Many lectins of e.g. plants or fungi have been suggested to act as toxins to defend the host against predators and parasites. We have previously shown that the Coprinopsis cinerea lectin 2 (CCL2), which binds to α1,3-fucosylated N-glycan cores, is toxic to Caenorhabditis elegans and results in developmental delay and premature death. In this study, we investigated the underlying toxicity phenotype at the cellular level by electron and confocal microscopy. We found that CCL2 directly binds to the intestinal apical surface and leads to a highly damaged brush border with loss of microvilli, actin filament depolymerization, and invaginations of the intestinal apical plasma membrane through gaps in the terminal web. We excluded several possible toxicity mechanisms such as internalization and pore-formation, suggesting that CCL2 acts directly on intestinal apical plasma membrane or glycocalyx proteins. A genetic screen for C. elegans mutants resistant to CCL2 generated over a dozen new alleles in bre 1, ger 1, and fut 1, three genes required for the synthesis of the sugar moiety recognized by CCL2. CCL2-induced intestinal brush border defects in C. elegans are similar to the damage observed previously in rats after feeding the dietary lectins wheat germ agglutinin or concanavalin A. The evolutionary conserved reaction of the brush border between mammals and nematodes might allow C. elegans to be exploited as model organism for the study of dietary lectin-induced intestinal pathology in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1491994824,"Seed oils of flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) and many other plant species contain substantial amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the major site for PUFA synthesis. The exact mechanisms of how these PUFAs are channeled from PC into triacylglycerol (TAG) needs to be further explored. By using in vivo and in vitro approaches, we demonstrated that the PC deacylation reaction catalyzed by the reverse action of acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) can transfer PUFAs on PC directly into the acyl-CoA pool, making these PUFAs available for the diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT)-catalyzed reaction for TAG production. Two types of yeast mutants were generated for in vivo and in vitro experiments, respectively. Both mutants provide a null background with no endogenous TAG forming capacity and an extremely low LPCAT activity. In vivo experiments showed that co-expressing flax DGAT1-1 and LPCAT1 in the yeast quintuple mutant significantly increased 18-carbon PUFAs in TAG with a concomitant decrease of 18-carbon PUFAs in phospholipid. We further showed that after incubation of sn-2-[14C]acyl-PC, formation of [14C]TAG was only possible with yeast microsomes containing both LPCAT1 and DGAT1-1. Moreover, the specific activity of overall LPCAT1 and DGAT1-1 coupling process exhibited a preference for transferring 14C-labeled linoleoyl or linolenoyl than oleoyl moieties from the sn-2 position of PC to TAG. Together, our data support the hypothesis of biochemical coupling of the LPCAT1-catalyzed reverse reaction with the DGAT1-1-catalyzed reaction for incorporating PUFAs into TAG. This process represents a potential route for enriching TAG in PUFA content during seed development in flax. Seed oils of flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) and many other plant species contain substantial amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the major site for PUFA synthesis. The exact mechanisms of how these PUFAs are channeled from PC into triacylglycerol (TAG) needs to be further explored. By using in vivo and in vitro approaches, we demonstrated that the PC deacylation reaction catalyzed by the reverse action of acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) can transfer PUFAs on PC directly into the acyl-CoA pool, making these PUFAs available for the diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT)-catalyzed reaction for TAG production. Two types of yeast mutants were generated for in vivo and in vitro experiments, respectively. Both mutants provide a null background with no endogenous TAG forming capacity and an extremely low LPCAT activity. In vivo experiments showed that co-expressing flax DGAT1-1 and LPCAT1 in the yeast quintuple mutant significantly increased 18-carbon PUFAs in TAG with a concomitant decrease of 18-carbon PUFAs in phospholipid. We further showed that after incubation of sn-2-[14C]acyl-PC, formation of [14C]TAG was only possible with yeast microsomes containing both LPCAT1 and DGAT1-1. Moreover, the specific activity of overall LPCAT1 and DGAT1-1 coupling process exhibited a preference for transferring 14C-labeled linoleoyl or linolenoyl than oleoyl moieties from the sn-2 position of PC to TAG.

Chemical amendment of slurry has been proposed as a management practice, allowing slurry nutrients to remain available to plants whilst mitigating P losses in runoff. The effectiveness of amendments is well understood but their impacts on other loss pathways (so-called 'pollution swapping' potential) and therefore the feasibility of using such amendments has not been examined to date. The aim of this laboratory scale study was to determine how the chemical amendment of slurry affects losses of NH3, CH4, N2O, and CO2. Alum, FeCl2, Polyaluminium chloride (PAC)- and biochar reduced NH3 emissions by 92, 54, 65 and 77% compared to the slurry control, while lime increased emissions by 114%. Cumulative N2O emissions of cattle slurry increased when amended with alum and FeCl2 by 202% and 154% compared to the slurry only treatment. Lime, PAC and biochar resulted in a reduction of 44, 29 and 63% in cumulative N2O loss compared to the slurry only treatment. Addition of amendments to slurry did not significantly affect soil CO2 release during the study while CH4 emissions followed a similar trend for all of the amended slurries applied, with an initial increase in losses followed by a rapid decrease for the duration of the study. All of the amendments examined reduced the initial peak in CH4 emissions compared to the slurry only treatment. There was no significant effect of slurry amendments on global warming potential (GWP) caused by slurry land application, with the exception of biochar. After considering pollution swapping in conjunction with amendment effectiveness, the amendments recommended for further field study are PAC, alum and lime. This study has also shown that biochar has potential to reduce GHG losses arising from slurry application."

Faithful segregation of newly replicated genomes to daughter cells requires specialized partitioning machinery. In eukaryotic cells, the well known microtubule-based mitotic spindle apparatus, which guides the separating chromosomes to the different ends of the dividing cell, drives the chromosome segregation process (1Bloom K.

In contrast, the mechanism of chromosome separation and plasmid partition in bacterial cells is not well understood.

Unraveling the molecular basis of this plasmid partitioning system is therefore important to help us to understand chromosomal segregation. The ParAB partition system requires three or more components: two trans-acting dimeric proteins (ParA and ParB), one or more cis-acting parS site(s), and, in most cases, the host's chromosomal DNA (3Szardenings F.

The interaction of the ParA and ParB components, which leads to proper separation of plasmid copies, has been extensively studied in plasmids of the γ-Proteobacteria class. These studies provide the foundation for filament- and non-filament-based modes of plasmid segregation. In the filament-based modes, ParA (Sm), when bound to ATP, assembles into filaments or bundles, and the partition complexes are mobilized by linear contractile filaments reminiscent of the spindle mechanism in eukaryotes (thread pushing or pulling model) (Fig. 2A) (16Barillà D.

The segregation machinery of plasmids and bacteria of the Firmicutes phylum, which are evolutionarily separated by more than 1,500 million years from Proteobacteria (a genetic distance larger than the one between humans and plants), is less understood.

Likewise, free δ2 in solution (i.e. in the absence of nsDNA) forms discrete blob-shaped structures containing 2–3 δ2 molecules rather than long bundles (24Pratto F. Suzuki Y. Takeyasu K. Alonso J.C.

In vitro experiments have shown that at substoichiometric ω2/δ2 molar ratios, the interaction of apo-δ2 with the unstructured N-terminal end of ω2 bound to parS DNA increases the binding affinity of ω2 for parS DNA by ∼8-fold, leading to a long-lived complex (14Soberón N.E. Lioy V.S. Pratto F. Volante A. Alonso J.C. Molecular anatomy of the Streptococcus pyogenes pSM19035 partition and segrosome complexes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 2624-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Protein δ2 bound to nsDNA, upon interacting with a ω2·parS complex, loses its association with nsDNA and relocalizes with ω2·parS to form a ternary complex (parS·ω2·δ2), followed by formation of quinary complexes (parS·ω2·δ2·ω2·parS) (24Pratto F. Suzuki Y. Takeyasu K. Alonso J.C. Single-molecule analysis of protein·DNA complexes formed during partition of newly replicated plasmid molecules in Streptococcus pyogenes.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 30298-30306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In vivo, however, the interaction of a ternary (parS·ω2·δ2) complex with a dynamic δ2·nsDNA complex leads to plasmid-nucleoid pairing (parS·ω2·δ2·nsDNA) (34Volante A. pSM19035: Dissection of thr Plasmid Partitioning Machinery. Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, 2014Google Scholar). At equimolar ω2/δ2 molar ratios, however, ω2 stimulates δ2-mediated ATP hydrolysis, causing subsequent dislodging of δ2 from paired complexes, via a poorly understood mechanism (15Pratto F. Cicek A. Weihofen W.A. Lurz R. Saenger W. Alonso J.C.

At present, the δ2 regions involved in oligomerization and in the interaction with ω2 are poorly defined, and they have been mapped in this work. We show here that the δ2·ω2 and δ2·δ2 interacting domains are adjacent to but distinct from each other and suggest some functional transitions that are crucial for the activation of the δ2 ATPase activity. The B. subtilis strain and the plasmids used for segregation studies are indicated in Table 1. The plasmids used for overexpression of proteins were propagated in E. coli BL21(DE3) (pLysS) and are listed in Table 1.TABLE 1Strains and plasmidsa Mid-copy number (7–9 copies/cell) pHP14 derivatives bearing the δ and ω genes (or their variants) under the control of their own promoters (Pδ (parS1) and Pω (parS2); see Fig. 1). Open table in a new tab a Mid-copy number (7–9 copies/cell) pHP14 derivatives bearing the δ and ω genes (or their variants) under the control of their own promoters (Pδ (parS1) and Pω (parS2); see Fig. 1). The δ gene encodes two co-linear polypeptides, a 298-residues (δ+14) and a WT 284-residue product. The plasmid pCB746-borne WT δ gene was used for site-directed mutagenesis and discrete deletions from the N- and C-terminal regions. The exposed and positively charged Lys residues at the C-terminal end of δ2 were substituted by Ala (δ2K242A, δ2K259A/K260A) or Ser (δ2K248S), and the negatively charged residue 211 was replaced by Ala (δ2D211A), as described previously (34Volante A. pSM19035: Dissection of thr Plasmid Partitioning Machinery. Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, 2014Google Scholar). Many of the initially designed C-terminal deletion mutants were insoluble. To overcome this inconvenience, δ2 variants containing or lacking residues within random coil regions around the initially programmed C-terminal deletion were constructed. Finally, the codons at positions 255, 227, 197, and 164 of the WT δ gene were fused to His6 codons, leading to a series of constructs truncated from the 3′-end. The number of plasmid copies per cell was estimated by quantitative PCR. Normalization was done with two distinct chromosomal genes as described earlier (35Ceglowski P. Boitsov A. Karamyan N. Chai S.

However, the influence of different kinds of similarity (e.g. relating to age, music taste, ethical views) in initial preferences for a stranger have not been compared. In the current study, we test for a relationship between sharing a variety of traits (i.e. having different kinds of similarity) with a stranger and the perceived likeability of that stranger. In two online experiments, participants were introduced to a series of virtual partners with whom they shared traits, and subsequently carried out activities designed to measure positivity directed towards those partners. Greater numbers of shared traits led to linearly increasing ratings of partner likeability and ratings on the Inclusion of Other in Self scale. We identified several consistent predictors of these two measures: shared taste in music, religion and ethical views. These kinds of trait are likely to be judged as correlates of personality or social group, and may therefore be used as proxies of more in-depth information about a person who might be socially more relevant."
https://openalex.org/W1894769752,"Fluoride is a ubiquitous environmental toxin with which all biological species must cope. A recently discovered family of fluoride export (FEX) proteins protects organisms from fluoride toxicity by removing it from the cell. We show here that FEX proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae function as ion channels that are selective for fluoride over chloride and that these proteins are constitutively expressed at the yeast plasma membrane. Continuous expression is in contrast to many other toxin exporters in yeast, and this, along with the fact that two nearly duplicate proteins are encoded in the yeast genome, suggests that the threat posed by fluoride ions is frequent and detrimental. Structurally, eukaryotic FEX proteins consist of two homologous four-transmembrane helix domains folded into an antiparallel dimer, where the orientation of the two domains is fixed by a single transmembrane linker helix. Using phylogenetic sequence conservation as a guide, we have identified several functionally important residues. There is substantial functional asymmetry in the effect of mutation at corresponding sites in the two domains. Specifically, mutations to residues in the C-terminal domain proved significantly more detrimental to function than did similar mutations in the N-terminal domain. Our data suggest particular residues that may be important to anion specificity, most notably the necessity of a positive charge near the end of TMH1 in the C-terminal domain. It is possible that a cationic charge at this location may create an electrostatic well for fluoride ions entering the channel from the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W618784952,"Indirect reciprocity potentially provides an important means for generating cooperation based on helping those who help others. However, the use of 'image scores' to summarize individuals' past behaviour presents a dilemma: individuals withholding help from those of low image score harm their own reputation, yet giving to defectors erodes cooperation. Explaining how indirect reciprocity could evolve has therefore remained problematic. In all previous treatments of indirect reciprocity, individuals are assigned potential recipients and decide whether to cooperate or defect based on their reputation. A second way of achieving discrimination is through partner choice, which should enable individuals to avoid defectors. Here, I develop a model in which individuals choose to donate to anyone within their group, or to none. Whereas image scoring with random pairing produces cycles of cooperation and defection, with partner choice there is almost maximal cooperation. In contrast to image scoring with random pairing, partner choice results in almost perfect contingency, producing the correlation between giving and receiving required for cooperation. In this way, partner choice facilitates much higher and more stable levels of cooperation through image scoring than previously reported and provides a simple mechanism through which systems of helping those who help others can work."

Acute stress-induced inflammation increases indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase-stimulated tryptophan catabolism. To investigate the role of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase expression and tryptophan administration in adverse effects of stress on cutaneous wound healing, mice were submitted to chronic restraint stress and treated with tryptophan daily until euthanasia. Excisional lesions were created on each mouse and 5 or 7 days later, the lesions were analyzed. In addition, murine skin fibroblasts were exposed to elevated epinephrine levels plus tryptophan, and fibroblast activity was evaluated. Tryptophan administration reversed the reduction of the plasma tryptophan levels and the increase in the plasma normetanephrine levels induced by stress 5 and 7 days after wounding. Five days after wounding, stress-induced increase in the protein levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase, and this was inhibited by tryptophan. Stress-induced increase in the lipid peroxidation and the amount of the neutrophils, macrophages and T cells number was reversed by tryptophan 5 days after wounding. Tryptophan administration inhibited the reduction of myofibroblast density, collagen deposition, re-epithelialization and wound contraction induced by stress 5 days after wounding. In dermal fibroblast culture, the tryptophan administration increased the cell migration and AKT phosphorylation in cells treated with high epinephrine levels. In conclusion, tryptophan-induced reduction of inflammatory response and indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase expression may have accelerated cutaneous wound healing of chronically stressed mice."
https://openalex.org/W2127144118,"The x2 glycosphingolipid is expressed on erythrocytes from individuals of all common blood group phenotypes and elevated on cells of the rare P/P1/Pk-negative p blood group phenotype. Globoside or P antigen is synthesized by UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine:globotriaosyl-ceramide 3-β-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase encoded by B3GALNT1. It is the most abundant non-acid glycosphingolipid on erythrocytes and displays the same terminal disaccharide, GalNAcβ3Gal, as x2. We encountered a patient with mutations in B3GALNT1 causing the rare P-deficient P1k phenotype and whose pretransfusion plasma was unexpectedly incompatible with p erythrocytes. The same phenomenon was also noted in seven other unrelated P-deficient individuals. Thin-layer chromatography, mass spectrometry, and flow cytometry were used to show that the naturally occurring antibodies made by p individuals recognize x2 and sialylated forms of x2, whereas x2 is lacking on P-deficient erythrocytes. Overexpression of B3GALNT1 resulted in synthesis of both P and x2. Knockdown experiments with siRNA against B3GALNT1 diminished x2 levels. We conclude that x2 fulfills blood group criteria and is synthesized by UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine: globotriaosylceramide 3-β-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase. Based on this linkage, we proposed that x2 joins P in the GLOB blood group system (ISBT 028) and is renamed PX2 (GLOB2). Thus, in the absence of a functional P synthase, neither P nor PX2 are formed. As a consequence, naturally occurring anti-P and anti-PX2 can be made. Until the clinical significance of anti-PX2 is known, we also recommend that rare P1k or P2k erythrocyte units are preferentially selected for transfusion to Pk patients because p erythrocytes may pose a risk for hemolytic transfusion reactions due to their elevated PX2 levels."

We explored opinions expressed by primary care patients diagnosed as overweight or moderately obese concerning their time spent sitting, willingness to change, and barriers, facilitators, goals and expectations related to limiting this behaviour.A descriptive-interpretive qualitative study was carried out at three healthcare centres in Barcelona, Spain, and included 23 patients with overweight or moderate obesity, aged 25 to 65 years, who reported sitting for at least 6 hours a day. Exclusion criteria were inability to sit down or stand up from a chair without help and language barriers that precluded interview participation. Ten in-depth, semi-structured interviews (5 group, 5 individual) were audio recorded from January to July 2012 and transcribed. The interview script included questions about time spent sitting, willingness to change, barriers and facilitators, and the prospect of assistance from primary healthcare professionals. An analysis of thematic content was made using ATLAS.Ti and triangulation of analysts.The most frequent sedentary activities were computer use, watching television, and motorized journeys. There was a lack of awareness of the amount of time spent sitting and its negative consequences on health. Barriers to reducing sedentary time included work and family routines, lack of time and willpower, age and sociocultural limitations. Facilitators identified were sociocultural change, free time and active work, and family surroundings. Participants recognized the abilities of health professionals to provide help and advice, and reported a preference for patient-centred or group interventions.Findings from this study have implications for reducing sedentary behaviour.

https://openalex.org/W1490253953,"Kinesin-13 proteins depolymerize microtubules in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner. The coupling between these two activities remains unclear. Here, we first studied the role of the kinesin-13 subfamily-specific loop 2 and of the KVD motif at the tip of this loop. Shortening the loop, the lysine/glutamate interchange and the additional Val to Ser substitution all led to Kif2C mutants with decreased microtubule-stimulated ATPase and impaired depolymerization capability. We rationalized these results based on a structural model of the Kif2C-ATP-tubulin complex derived from the recently determined structures of kinesin-1 bound to tubulin. In this model, upon microtubule binding Kif2C undergoes a conformational change governed in part by the interaction of the KVD motif with the tubulin interdimer interface. Second, we mutated to an alanine the conserved glutamate residue of the switch 2 nucleotide binding motif. This mutation blocks motile kinesins in a post-conformational change state and inhibits ATP hydrolysis. This Kif2C mutant still depolymerized microtubules and yielded complexes of one Kif2C with two tubulin heterodimers. These results demonstrate that the structural change of Kif2C-ATP upon binding to microtubule ends is sufficient for tubulin release, whereas ATP hydrolysis is not required. Overall, our data suggest that the conformation reached by kinesin-13s upon tubulin binding is similar to that of tubulin-bound, ATP-bound, motile kinesins but that this conformation is adapted to microtubule depolymerization."

The Rab superfamily of small GTPases controls essentially every step of vesicle trafficking from vesicle formation to vesicle transport and, eventually, docking and fusion with the target membrane (1Stenmark H. Rab GTPases as coordinators of vesicle traffic.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 513-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar). Rab proteins regulate such a large range of functions by recruiting unique sets of effector proteins that mediate their downstream activities. Rabs cycle between active, GTP-bound, and inactive, GDP-bound forms, and in the active form they engage their effectors. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 6The abbreviations used are: GEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorGAPGTPase activating proteinGLUT4glucose transporter 4DENNdifferentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cellMBPmaltose-binding proteinGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateOAokadaic acid. activate Rabs by catalyzing the removal of GDP, allowing for exchange with GTP, and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) turn off Rabs by enhancing their intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis (1Stenmark H.

Although GEFs and GAPs catalyze the nucleotide switch, additional control mechanisms are required to create the precise spatial and temporal activation that is characteristic of Rabs and other small GTPases. A key mechanism is modification of the catalytic activity of GEF and GAP proteins (2Cherfils J. Zeghouf M. Regulation of small GTPases by GEFs, GAPs, and GDIs.Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93: 269-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of many GEFs and GAPs is inhibited by intramolecular interactions that create steric hindrance and obstruct the substrate binding site, resulting in inefficient function of the catalytic domain (2Cherfils J. Zeghouf M. Regulation of small GTPases by GEFs, GAPs, and GDIs.Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93: 269-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). This autoinhibition has been documented in multiple GEFs including TIM, a GEF for RhoA (3Yohe M.E. Rossman K.L. Gardner O.S. Karnoub A.E. Snyder J.T. Gershburg S. Graves L.M. Der C.J. Sondek J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). GEF proteins achieve full catalytic activity when the autoinhibition is relieved, which can be accomplished through multiple mechanisms. For example, phosphorylation of TIM releases the intramolecular interaction and leads to an increase in the nucleotide exchange rate (3Yohe M.E. Rossman K.L. Gardner O.S. Karnoub A.E. Snyder J.T. Gershburg S. Graves L.M. Der C.J. Sondek J. Auto-inhibition of the Dbl family protein Tim by an N-terminal helical motif.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13813-13823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation can also have the opposite effect and reduce the GEF activity as observed in Dock6, a GEF for Rac1 and Cdc42 (5Miyamoto Y. Torii T. Yamamori N. Ogata T. Tanoue A. Yamauchi J. Akt and PP2A reciprocally regulate the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Dock6 to control axon growth of sensory neurons.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: ra15Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interaction with a binding partner can also lead to a change in GEF activity (2Cherfils J. Zeghouf M. Regulation of small GTPases by GEFs, GAPs, and GDIs.Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93: 269-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). For instance, the autoinhibition of intersectin is released when it interacts with its binding partner, neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (4Hussain N.K. Jenna S. Glogauer M. Quinn C.C. Wasiak S. Guipponi M. Antonarakis S.E. Kay B.K. Stossel T.P. Lamarche-Vane N. McPherson P.S. Endocytic protein intersectin-l regulates actin assembly via Cdc42 and N-WASP.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Recently, interaction with the 14-3-3 family of proteins has been implicated in regulation of GEF activity (6Chahdi A. Sorokin A. Protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation modulates β1Pix guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity through 14-3-3β binding.Mol. Cell.

Cell Physiol. 2011; 226: 2965-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The majority of 14-3-3 interactions are phospho-dependent, and the 14-3-3 binding motifs contain either a phosphoserine or a phosphothreonine residue (8Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. The structural basis for 14–3-3:phosphopeptide binding specificity.Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). A GEF protein is first phosphorylated and subsequently interacts with 14-3-3, thus creating a multipart control system. An example is seen in the regulation of β1 Pix, where PKA phosphorylates β1 Pix at two sites allowing 14-3-3 to bind, leading to reduced GEF activity (6Chahdi A. Sorokin A. Protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation modulates β1Pix guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity through 14-3-3β binding.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1679-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). GEF and GAP proteins serve as ideal loci for signaling cascades to impinge on membrane trafficking. For example, the GAP activity of AS160/TBC1D4, a GAP for Rab10, is regulated in response to insulin signaling (9Sano H. Kane S. Sano E. Mîinea C.P. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.W. Lienhard G.E.

Insulin signaling activates Akt, which phosphorylates AS160 at four different residues blocking the enzymatic activity of AS160 (9Sano H. Kane S. Sano E. Mîinea C.P. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.W.

Inactivation of AS160 is required for the Rab10-dependent transport and plasma membrane fusion of intracellular storage vesicles that contain glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), thus placing GLUT4 on the surface to mediate glucose uptake. Akt phosphorylation creates two 14-3-3 binding sites in AS160, and the interaction with 14-3-3 is required for inactivation of AS160 (10Ramm G. Larance M. Guilhaus M. James D.E.

Pelleted bacteria were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.83 mm benzamidine, 0.23 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) and sonicated. Triton X-100 was added to 1% final concentration, and samples were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged at 30,700 × g for 15 min; the supernatant was then incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 3 times with PreScission protease cleavage buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0), and the purified fusion proteins were cleaved from the GST tag by overnight incubation with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C. Cleaved Rab35 was then exchanged into GEF loading buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl); samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. All FLAG-tagged connecdenn constructs were expressed in HEK-293 cells. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were collected in 20 mm HEPES supplemented with protease inhibitors and sonicated. Triton X-100 was added to 1% final concentration, and the lysates were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were then centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were incubated with 12.5 μl of protein G-Sepharose and 5 μg of monoclonal FLAG (M2) antibody for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed in GEF incubation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2). Each immunoprecipitation was performed in duplicate; one sample was immediately added to the in vitro GDP/GTP exchange assays, whereas the second sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE and processed for Western blot. For the GDP/GTP exchange assays, first, a 15 μm concentration of purified Rab35 was loaded with 30 μm GDP (Sigma) by incubation for 10 min at 30 °C in GEF loading buffer with 5 mm EDTA. To stabilize the loaded GDP, 10 mm MgCl2 was added, and samples were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Exchange reactions were carried out at room temperature in 90 μl of total volume containing 1.25 μm preloaded GTPase, immunoprecipitated GEFs, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 μm GTPγS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 0.2 mCi/mmol [35S]GTPγS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol in GEF incubation buffer. At the indicated time points, 15 μl of the reaction was removed, added to 1 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2), and passed through nitrocellulose filters. The filters were washed with 5 ml of wash buffer and counted using a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter LS6500 scintillation counter). FLAG-tagged full-length connecdenn 1 and 2 or various deletion constructs of connecdenn 1 were expressed in HEK-293 cells. At 18 h post-transfection, cells were treated with okadaic acid (OA), Na3VO4, or DMSO. After 2 h cells were collected in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors (5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 500 nm OA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF). The lysates were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were resolved by SDS-PAGE and processed for Western blotting. For autoradiography experiments, FLAG-tagged connecdenn 1 or 2 full-length constructs were expressed in HEK-293. At 18 h post-transfection, regular Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was replaced by phosphate-free DMEM, and 0.125 μCi of label-free [32]Pi (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each 15-cm plate of cells. After 2 h, cells were stimulated with either 250 nm OA or DMSO for 2 h. Cells were collected in lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The lysates were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 234,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were incubated with 12.5 μl of Protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and 5 μg of monoclonal FLAG (M2) antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and processed for autoradiography. Various FLAG-tagged constructs were expressed in HEK-293 cells. At 18 h post-transfection, cells were treated with either 250 nm OA or DMSO for 2 h or were left untreated. Cells were collected in lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and, when appropriate, phosphatase inhibitors. The lysates were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 234,000 × g for 15 min. At the same time, various GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21. Pelleted bacteria were resuspended in PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors and sonicated. Triton X-100 was added to 1% final concentration, and the samples were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 30,700 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with lysis buffer, and the pre-coupled fusion proteins were incubated with lysates of HEK-293 cells for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with lysis buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and processed for Western blotting. In other assays MBP-lacZ or MBP-connecdenn 1 peptides were expressed in E. coli BL-21. Pelleted bacteria were resuspended in lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and sonicated. The samples were centrifuged at 30,700 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were incubated with amylose resin for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with lysis buffer, and the pre-coupled fusion proteins were incubated with lysates of HEK-293 cells expressing FLAG-DENN domain for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with lysis buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and processed for Western blotting. Mouse 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were cultured in DMEM containing 10% bovine calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 until reaching full confluency. To induce differentiation, two-day post-confluent 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were stimulated for 72 h with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. The medium was then replaced with DMEM containing 10% FBS supplemented with 1 μm insulin alone. After 48 h, the medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS until the cells were utilized for experiments. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-starved for 2 h then treated with 100 nm insulin for 30 min in the presence or absence of 10 μm MK2206, an Akt inhibitor administered 30 min before insulin treatment. Cells were collected in lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors, and the affinity selection assay was performed as described earlier. For in vitro GEF assays, data were plotted in GraphPad Prism, and curves were fitted by a nonlinear regression one-phase association (n = 2, mean ± S.D.). The amount of endogenous connecdenn 1 specifically bound to Rab35 S22N or 14-3-3 and FLAG-connecdenn 1 wild-type (WT) or mutant bound to 14-3-3 were quantified by densitometry using ImageJ. Statistical significance was determined using an unpaired t test in GraphPad Prism (n = 4, mean ± S.E.). The enzymatic activity of many GEF proteins is autoinhibited (2Cherfils J. Zeghouf M. Regulation of small GTPases by GEFs, GAPs, and GDIs.Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93: 269-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). To test if the connecdenn family is regulated by this mechanism, we compared the catalytic activity of full-length connecdenn 1 and connecdenn 2 to their corresponding isolated DENN domains. We chose to investigate connecdenn 1 and 2 as they have the most robust GEF activity toward Rab35. The proteins were immunoprecipitated after overexpression in HEK-293 cells and added to purified Rab35 preloaded with GDP. The number of pmol of Rab35 loaded with GTP is two-three times greater when incubated with the isolated DENN domains as compared with full-length connecdenn 1 and connecdenn 2 (Fig. 1, A and B). The right panels of Fig. 1, A and B, show Western blots of a duplicate sample of the immunoprecipitated connecdenn proteins, demonstrating that there was an equal (or greater) amount of the full-length protein as compared with the DENN domain. The DENN domain is located at the N terminus in the connecdenn family; thus the C-terminal region plays an inhibitory role on the GEF activity of the DENN domain. We speculate that this inhibition results from autoinhibition, but we cannot rule out that a protein binding partner(s) that interacts with the C-terminal region of the connecdenns regulates the GEF activity. In general, inhibitory intramolecular interactions do not modify the enzymatic rate but instead block access of the GEF to its substrate (2Cherfils J. Zeghouf M. Regulation of small GTPases by GEFs, GAPs, and GDIs.Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93: 269-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). We thus compared the DENN domains to full-length connecdenn 1 and 2 for their ability to bind Rab35. Interestingly, Rab35-S22N (a constitutively GDP-bound mutant) interacts more strongly with the isolated DENN domains than the corresponding full-length proteins (Fig. 1, C and D). The change in substrate binding implies that the C-terminal regions create steric hindrance that obstructs the interaction between the DENN domains and Rab35. Thus, the low Rab35 binding of full-length connecdenn 1 and 2 parallels the low GEF activity. Phosphorylation is a well established mechanism to regulate GEF and GAP activities (2Cherfils J. Zeghouf M. Regulation of small GTPases by GEFs, GAPs, and GDIs.Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93: 269-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Proteomic screens reveal that connecdenn 1 and 2 are highly phosphorylated both at steady state and in response to specific stimuli (19Huttlin E.L. Jedrychowski M.P. Elias J.E. Goswami T. Rad R.

Biol. 2010; 6: 371Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In a large scale study examining global steady-state phosphorylation in nine different mouse tissues, a total of 15 distinct serine/threonine phospho-peptides from 8 different tissues were identified in connecdenn 1, and 10 phosphorylated serine/threonine residues in all nine tissues were detected in connecdenn 2 (19Huttlin E.L. Jedrychowski M.P. Elias J.E. Goswami T. Rad R. Beausoleil S.A. Villén J. Haas W. Sowa M.E. Gygi S.P. A tissue-specific atlas of mouse protein phosphorylation and expression.Cell. 2010; 143: 1174-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). Certain phosphopeptides were unique to a specific tissue, whereas the majority of phospho-peptides were detected in multiple tissues. To examine the phosphorylation further, we initially evaluated phosphorylation of connecdenn 1 in response to two phosphatase inhibitors: OA, a serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor, and Na3VO4, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. We observed an upward gel shift of overexpressed full-length connecdenn 1 in response to OA after 2 h of treatment with a minimum concentration of 150 nm (Fig. 2A), whereas treatment with Na3VO4 did not cause an upward shift (Fig. 2B). No shift was seen with DMSO (vehicle control). We also observed a shift of full-length connecdenn 2 in response to OA after 2 h of treatment with a minimum concentration of 200 nm (Fig. 2C). Thus, connecdenn 1 and 2 appear to be phosphorylated on the serine/threonine residue(s). To confirm that the reduced electrophoretic mobility was caused by phosphorylation, we measured incorporation of radioactive phosphate in response to OA. HEK-293 cells transfected with full-length FLAG-connecdenn 1 or 2 were incubated with [32]Pi in the presence of DMSO or OA. The connecdenn proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and the resulting autoradiograph reveals a robust increase of [32]Pi incorporati"
https://openalex.org/W1749439186,"Historically, type II topoisomerases have yielded clinically useful drugs for the treatment of bacterial infections and cancer, but the corresponding enzymes from malaria parasites remain understudied. This is due to the general challenges of producing malaria proteins in functional forms in heterologous expression systems. Here, we express full-length Plasmodium falciparum topoisomerase II (PfTopoII) in a wheat germ cell-free transcription-translation system. Functional activity of soluble PfTopoII from the translation lysates was confirmed through both a plasmid relaxation and a DNA decatenation activity that was dependent on magnesium and ATP. To facilitate future drug discovery, a convenient and sensitive fluorescence assay was established to follow DNA decatenation, and a stable, truncated PfTopoII was engineered for high level enzyme production. PfTopoII was purified using a DNA affinity column. Existing TopoII inhibitors previously developed for other non-malaria indications inhibited PfTopoII, as well as malaria parasites in culture at submicromolar concentrations. Even before optimization, inhibitors of bacterial gyrase, GSK299423, ciprofloxacin, and etoposide exhibited 15-, 57-, and 3-fold selectivity for the malarial enzyme over human TopoII. Finally, it was possible to use the purified PfTopoII to dissect the different modes by which these varying classes of TopoII inhibitors could trap partially processed DNA. The present biochemical advancements will allow high throughput chemical screening of compound libraries and lead optimization to develop new lines of antimalarials."
https://openalex.org/W2278084551,"Recent studies have conferred that the RAD51C and RAD51D genes, which code for the essential proteins involved in homologous recombination, are ovarian cancer (OC) susceptibility genes that may explain genetic risks in high-risk patients. We performed a mutation analysis in 171 high-risk BRCA1 and BRCA2 negative OC patients, to evaluate the frequency of hereditary RAD51C and RAD51D variants in Czech population. The analysis involved direct sequencing, high resolution melting and multiple ligation-dependent probe analysis. We identified two (1.2%) and three (1.8%) inactivating germline mutations in both respective genes, two of which (c.379_380insG, p.P127Rfs*28 in RAD51C and c.879delG, p.C294Vfs*16 in RAD51D) were novel. Interestingly, an indicative family cancer history was not present in four carriers. Moreover, the ages at the OC diagnoses in identified mutation carriers were substantially lower than those reported in previous studies (four carriers were younger than 45 years). Further, we also described rare missense variants, two in RAD51C and one in RAD51D whose clinical significance needs to be verified. Truncating mutations and rare missense variants ascertained in OC patients were not detected in 1226 control samples. Although the cumulative frequency of RAD51C and RAD51D truncating mutations in our patients was lower than that of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, it may explain OC susceptibility in approximately 3% of high-risk OC patients. Therefore, an RAD51C and RAD51D analysis should be implemented into the comprehensive multi-gene testing for high-risk OC patients, including early-onset OC patients without a family cancer history."
https://openalex.org/W2287613589,"The infectious activity of coxsackievirus B1 (CV-B1) in Taiwan was high from 2008 to 2010, following an alarming increase in severe neonate disease in the United States (US). To examine the relationship between CV-B1 strains isolated in Taiwan and those from other parts of the world, we performed a phylodynamic study using VP1 and partial 3Dpol (414 nt) sequences from 22 strains of CV-B1 isolated in Taiwan (1989-2010) and compared them to sequences from strains isolated worldwide. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. Four genotypes (GI-IV) in the VP1 region of CV-B1 and three genotypes (GA-C) in the 3Dpol region of enterovirus B were identified and had high support values. The phylogenetic analysis indicates that the GI and GIII strains in VP1 were geographically distributed in Taiwan (1993-1994) and in India (2007-2009). On the other hand, the GII and GIV strains appear to have a wider spatiotemporal distribution and ladder-like topology A stair-like phylogeny was observed in the VP1 region indicating that the phylogeny of the virus may be affected by different selection pressures in the specified regions. Further, most of the GI and GII strains in the VP1 tree were clustered together in GA in the 3D tree, while the GIV strains diverged into GB and GC. Taken together, these data provide important insights into the population dynamics of CV-B1 and indicate that incongruencies in specific gene regions may contribute to spatiotemporal patterns of epidemicity for this virus."
https://openalex.org/W631663184,"Many Asian colobine monkey species are suffering from habitat destruction and population size decline. There is a great need to understand their genetic diversity, population structure and demographic history for effective species conservation. The white-headed langur (Trachypithecus leucocephalus) is a Critically Endangered colobine species endemic to the limestone karst forests in southwestern China. We analyzed the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences of 390 fecal samples from 40 social groups across the main distribution areas, which represented one-third of the total extant population. Only nine haplotypes and 10 polymorphic sites were identified, indicating remarkably low genetic diversity in the species. Using a subset of 77 samples from different individuals, we evaluated genetic variation, population structure, and population demographic history. We found very low values of haplotype diversity (h = 0.570 ± 0.056) and nucleotide diversity (π = 0.00323 ± 0.00044) in the hypervariable region I (HVRI) of the mtDNA control region. Distribution of haplotypes displayed marked geographical pattern, with one population (Chongzuo, CZ) showing a complete lack of genetic diversity (having only one haplotype), whereas the other population (Fusui, FS) having all nine haplotypes. We detected strong population genetic structure among habit patches (ΦST = 0.375, P < 0.001). In addition, the Mantel test showed a significant correlation between the pairwise genetic distances and geographical distances among social groups in FS (correlation coefficient = 0.267, P = 0.003), indicting isolation-by-distance pattern of genetic divergence in the mtDNA sequences. Analyses of demographic history suggested an overall stable historical population size and modest population expansion in the last 2,000 years. Our results indicate different genetic diversity and possibly distinct population history for different local populations, and suggest that CZ and FS should be considered as one evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) and two management units (MUs) pending further investigation using nuclear markers."

Faithful DNA replication ensures the accurate distribution of genetic information from parent cells to daughter cells. Failure of accurate DNA replication creates mutations and/or chromosome rearrangements, which are the most common DNA lesions underlying cell death, cancer, and genetic disorders (1Branzei D. Foiani M. Maintaining genome stability at the replication fork.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Recent studies have not only advanced our understanding of DNA repair mechanisms that safeguard genome integrity but also identified key steps that can be therapeutically manipulated for cancer intervention. For instance, disruption of DNA replication has been commonly exploited in cancer therapy (2Helleday T. Petermann E. Lundin C. Hodgson B. Sharma R.A. DNA repair pathways as targets for cancer therapy.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). This involves the use of DNA topoisomerase I inhibitors, such as camptothecin (CPT) 2The abbreviations used are: CPTcamptothecinIRionizing radiationCDDPcisplatinDSBdouble-strand breakHRhomologous recombinationIPimmunoprecipitation. and its derivatives, which specifically trap topoisomerase I at the replication fork to prevent the religation of nicked DNA strands (3Pommier Y. Topoisomerase I inhibitors: camptothecins and beyond.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). Single-strand breaks created by CPT could be converted into double-strand breaks (DSBs) during DNA replication. The repair of these so-called replication-associated DSBs or one-ended DSBs is orchestrated by the actions of DNA damage response and repair pathways (4Ciccia A. Elledge S.J. The DNA damage response: making it safe to play with knives.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 179-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2922) Google Scholar). camptothecin ionizing radiation cisplatin double-strand break homologous recombination immunoprecipitation. Between the two predominant DSB repair pathways, i.e. homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining, HR plays a predominant role in the repair of CPT-induced DSBs. Because CPT treatment fails to elicit Ku70/80 foci formation, the nonhomologous end joining pathway is unlikely to play a role in the processing of CPT-induced DSBs (5Britton S. Coates J. Jackson S.P. A new method for high-resolution imaging of Ku foci to decipher mechanisms of DNA double-strand break repair.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 202: 579-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). HR-mediated DSB repair requires a homologous DNA template and is therefore active only in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. The process of HR begins with DSB recognition by the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex, which, together with CtIP, initiates short end resections to generate substrates that can be further processed by two other complexes containing either DNA2 or EXO1 (6Nimonkar A.V. Genschel J. Kinoshita E. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Wyman C. Modrich P. Kowalczykowski S.C. BLM-DNA2-RPA-MRN and EXO1-BLM-RPA-MRN constitute two DNA end resection machineries for human DNA break repair.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). This allows the generation of a long single-stranded DNA that is capable of initiating Rad51-dependent strand invasion of homologous DNA template (4Ciccia A. Elledge S.J.

Mitotic homologous recombination maintains genomic stability and suppresses tumorigenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 196-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The resulting HR intermediate structures can be channeled into one of the downstream processes such as double-Holliday junction repair, synthesis-dependent strand annealing, sister chromatid exchange, or break-induced replication (8Costantino L. Sotiriou S.K. Rantala J.K. Magin S. Mladenov E. Helleday T. Haber J.E. Iliakis G. Kallioniemi O.P. Halazonetis T.D.

Initiation of genetic recombination and recombination-dependent replication.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 156-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). In due course, these pathways help to maintain genomic stability, of which double-Holliday junction repair is conceived as the main process for rescuing collapsed DNA replication forks. Successful DSB recognition and repair at the collapsed replication fork also requires the action of ATR DNA damage signaling to coordinate DSB repair with DNA replication and cell cycle regulation (10Cimprich K.A. Cortez D. ATR: an essential regulator of genome integrity.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). ATR is primarily activated in the S phase by RPA-coated ssDNA that often arises during DNA replication stalling and DSB end resection. RPA-ssDNA recruits the ATR-ATRIP complex, leading to full activation of ATR together with the Rad17 clamp loader, the 9-1-1 complex, and TopBP1 (10Cimprich K.A. Cortez D. ATR: an essential regulator of genome integrity.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 616-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar, 11Liu S. Shiotani B. Lahiri M. Maréchal A. Tse A. Leung C.C. Glover J.N. Yang X.H. Zou L. ATR autophosphorylation as a molecular switch for checkpoint activation.Mol. Cell. 2011; 43: 192-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). ATR phosphorylates Chk1 to transduce an inhibitory signal to the CDC25 phosphatase, which prevents the dephosphorylation of CDKs and triggers G2/M arrest (12Curtin N.J. DNA repair dysregulation from cancer driver to therapeutic target.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2012; 12: 801-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). The delay of cell cycle progression is essential for giving cells sufficient time to fully repair DNA lesions before entry into mitosis. In the present study, we investigated the role of hMSH5 (human MutS homologue 5) in CPT-induced DSB repair. The MutS homologue MSH5 was initially identified as a meiotic recombination factor in yeast and mice (13Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Halsey C.

Genet. 1999; 21: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that MSH5 might have a role in the process of recombination. Previous studies have shown that hMSH5 functions in the process of DNA damage response through coordinating with c-Abl and p73 (16Yi W. Lee T.H. Tompkins J.D. Zhu F. Wu X. Her C.

MutS Homologues hMSH4 and hMSH5: Genetic variations, functions, and implications in human diseases.Curr. Genomics. 2013; 14: 81-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, hMSH5 sensitizes human cells to ionizing radiation (IR) and renders cells resistant to cisplatin (CDDP) (17Tompkins J.D. Wu X. Chu Y.L. Her C.

Her C. MutS homologue hMSH5: role in cisplatin-induced DNA damage response.Mol. Cancer. 2012; 11: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role in recombination, hMSH5 interacts with hMRE11 (20Kato T. Sato N. Hayama S. Yamabuki T. Ito T. Miyamoto M. Kondo S. Nakamura Y. Daigo Y. Activation of Holliday junction recognizing protein involved in the chromosomal stability and immortality of cancer cells.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 8544-8553Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and hMSH5 promotes HR repair and is recruited to I-SceI generated DSBs (21Wu X. Xu Y. Feng K. Tompkins J.D. Her C. MutS homologue hMSH5: recombinational DSB repair and non-synonymous polymorphic variants.PLoS One. 2013; 8e73284Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In addition, depletion of Rad51 compromises CDDP-induced hMSH5 foci formation, whereas the dominant negative hMSH5 Y742F mutation increases CDDP sensitivity and impairs Rad51 loading to I-SceI generated DSBs (19Tompkins J.D. Wu X. Her C. MutS homologue hMSH5: role in cisplatin-induced DNA damage response.Mol. Cancer. 2012; 11: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 21Wu X. Xu Y. Feng K. Tompkins J.D. Her C. MutS homologue hMSH5: recombinational DSB repair and non-synonymous polymorphic variants.PLoS One. 2013; 8e73284Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that hMSH5 directly interacts with FANCJ, and the resulting complex promotes HR and facilitates the ATR-Chk1 signaling in response to CPT. The generation of the mammalian expression construct Flag-hMSH5 was described previously (22Yi W. Wu X. Lee T.H. Doggett N.A. Her C. Two variants of MutS homolog hMSH5: prevalence in humans and effects on protein interaction.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 332: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All hMSH5 fragments were subcloned into pcDNA6 vector possessing a 3× Flag tag. For GST pulldown assays, hMSH5 1–225 was subcloned into the expression vector pGEX-6p-1, and all other hMSH5 fragments were subcloned into pGEX-6p-2. pcDNA3-myc-his-BACH1 was obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA). The generation of shRNA constructs was performed as described previously (23Vo A.T. Zhu F. Wu X. Yuan F. Gao Y. Gu L. Li G.M. Lee T.H. Her C. hMRE11 deficiency leads to microsatellite instability and defective DNA mismatch repair.EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 438-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The RNAi target sequences were hMSH5 sh2 (5′-TGGGCCTGAGGGATGCCTG-3′) (17Tompkins J.D. Wu X. Chu Y.L. Her C. Evidence for a direct involvement of hMSH5 in promoting ionizing radiation induced apoptosis.Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 2420-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), hMSH5 sh4 (5′-ATACTAGTGACTCC ACTATCC-3′), and FANCJ sh2 (5′-GTACAGTACCTCACCTTAT-3′). The sequence of sgRNA target was 5′-TAGGGATAACAGGGTAATGG-3′ (sgRNA-HRIR3). Antibodies used in the study were anti-Myc (631206; Clontech), anti-γ-H2AX (05-636; Millipore, Billerica, MA), anti-RPA2 (NB600-565; Novus, Littleton CO), anti-MRE11 (NB100-142; Novus), anti-α-tubulin (T6199; Sigma), anti-Flag M2 (F1804; Sigma), anti-BACH1 (B1310; Sigma), anti-actin (A2066; Sigma), anti-Rad51 (sc-8349; Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX), anti-PCNA (sc-56; Santa Cruz), anti-Chk1 (sc-8408; Santa Cruz), anti-GFP (sc-9996; Santa Cruz), anti-BRCA1 (sc-6954 and sc-642; Santa Cruz), anti-Chk2 (2662; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), anti-phospho-Chk2 (Thr-68) (2661; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-Chk1 (Ser-345) (2348; Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-histone H3 (39163; Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Purified anti-hMSH5 antibody was described previously (22Yi W. Wu X. Lee T.H. Doggett N.A. Her C. Two variants of MutS homolog hMSH5: prevalence in humans and effects on protein interaction.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 332: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). HEK293T and U2OS cells were maintained in DMEM/high glucose (GE Healthcare HyClone, Logan, UT) supplemented with 5% FBS, 5% NBS, and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific). Plasmid DNA transfections were carried out using either a standard calcium phosphate method or an Amaxa Nucleofector (Lonza Group Ltd., Allendale, NJ). HEK293T and U2OS cells stably expressing hMSH5 sh2, hMSH5 sh4, FANCJ sh2, and Flag-hMSH5 were generated through the selection of blasticidin- or neomycin-resistant colonies. Cell lysates were prepared using NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) was used to determine the protein concentrations of each lysate. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with indicated antibodies. For IP, cells were lysed in 400 μl of NETN buffer, and 5% of the lysates were saved as input. The rest of the lysates were incubated with primary antibodies followed by incubation with protein A/G-agarose beads (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific), which were then washed four times with NETN buffer. Immunocomplexes were boiled in 2× Laemmli sample buffer for 10 min before they were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The assay was performed as described with modifications (24Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Regulation of ATR substrate selection by Rad17-dependent loading of Rad9 complexes onto chromatin.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of solution A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 340 mm Sucrose, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, protease inhibitors, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and left on ice for 5 min. The nuclear (P1) and cytoplasmic fractions (S1) were separated by centrifugation at 1300 × g for 4 min. The P1 fraction was resuspended in 1 ml of solution A and left on ice for 5 min and then centrifuged at the same speed to remove remaining cytoplasmic proteins. The remaining pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of solution B (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT and protease inhibitors) and left on ice for 10 min. Soluble nuclear proteins (S2) were obtained by centrifugation at 1700 × g for 4 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of solution B and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min. The insoluble chromatin fraction (P2) was resuspended in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and sonicated for a total of 5 min before boiling. For micrococcal nuclease digestion, original cell preparations were split into two halves, of which one half was used for the procedure mentioned above to obtain S1, P1, S2, and P2 fractions. The other half was resuspended in 200 μl of solution A to separate P1 and S1. The P1 fraction was then resuspended in 200 μl of solution A containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 50 units of micrococcal nuclease and incubated at 37 °C for 2 min. After centrifugation at 1300 × g for 4 min, the nuclear (P1′) and cytoplasmic (S1′) fractions were obtained. The P1′ fraction was additionally washed with solution A and extracted with solution B to yield S2′ and P2′. To analyze γ-H2AX and Rad51 foci, U2OS cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 12 min, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked in PBS with 3% BSA, and incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. For RPA2 and BRCA1 foci detection, cells were pre-extracted for 5 min at 4 °C with the pre-extraction buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose, and 0.5% Triton X-100) before being subjected to paraformaldehyde fixation. For GFP-hMSH5, FANCJ, and BRCA1 foci detection, cells were treated with pre-extraction buffer and fixed in 100% ice-cold methanol for 10 min at −20 °C. After primary antibody incubation and washes in PBS, cells were incubated with Alexa 488- or 555-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were then mounted onto glass slides with Prolong gold antifade reagent containing DAPI (Invitrogen). Images were captured using a Leica Leitz DMRB microscope. GST-tagged hMSH5 fragments were expressed in BL21(DE3)-RIL cells with an 8-h IPTG induction. The bacterial cells were resuspended in the sonication buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min prior to sonication. The supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with lysates from HEK293T cells expressing myc-FANCJ (precleared with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads). Protein-bound beads were transferred to columns and washed prior to protein elution with 10 mm glutathione elution buffer. Eluted proteins were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Cells were seeded in triplicate in 6-cm plates at a density of 500 cells/plate. 16 h after seeding, cells were treated with CPT or CDDP for 1 or 24 h or with doxorubicin or hydroxyurea for 1 h and then released into fresh medium. After a 14-day culture, colonies with more than 50 cells were counted either directly (HEK293T cells) or after fixation and staining with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% ethanol (U2OS cells). The generation of the 293TLα/pMMR-IR3 reporter cell line was described previously (25Xu K. Wu X. Tompkins J.D. Her C. Assessment of anti-recombination and double-strand break-induced gene conversion in human cells by a chromosomal reporter.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 29543-29553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), in which a functional RFP gene was restored following HR. Recombination was initiated by transfecting cells with either pCBA-(I-SceI) or sgRNA-HRIR3 together with Cas9 using an Amaxa Nucleofector (Lonza Group Ltd.). Numbers of red fluorescent cells, at 7 or 4 days after transfection, were recorded and analyzed with a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) using CellQuest Pro (BD Biosciences). To identify hMSH5 interacting proteins, the 293T/f5 cell line stably expressing Flag-tagged hMSH5 was utilized to perform anti-Flag IP and MS-based analysis (16Yi W. Lee T.H. Tompkins J.D. Zhu F. Wu X. Her C. Physical and functional interaction between hMSH5 and c-Abl.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A protein at ∼140 kDa was identified as FANCJ (data not shown). FANCJ, also known as BRIP1 or BACH1, is the gene for Fanconi anemia complementation group J and participates in interstrand cross-link repair. FANCJ is also implicated to function in the processes of HR, DNA damage signaling, and DNA replication (26Cantor S.B. Bell D.W. Ganesan S. Kass E.M. Drapkin R. Grossman S. Wahrer D.C. Sgroi D.C.

FANCJ: solving problems in DNA replication.DNA Repair. 2010; 9: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To confirm the interaction between hMSH5 and FANCJ, reciprocal co-IP analyses were performed in the presence of DNase I (Fig. 1A), the latter was used to eliminate the potential bridging effect of DNA. We found that these two proteins interacted with each other, and this interaction was independent of DNA. This interaction was then validated by co-IP analysis of endogenous proteins (Fig. 1B). In addition, RNAi-mediated hMSH5 knockdown significantly reduced the amount of FANCJ protein that could be co-immunoprecipitated by the anti-hMSH5 antibody, attesting to the specificity of this assay (Fig. 1B). To decipher the FANCJ binding domain on hMSH5, we made a series of truncated fragments of hMSH5 (Fig. 1C). The results of the co-IP experiments indicated that all fragments with the first 225 amino acids were capable of binding to FANCJ, whereas the conserved DNA-binding and ATPase domains were not required for this interaction (Fig. 1D). The interaction between hMSH5 1–225 and FANCJ was further confirmed by a reciprocal co-IP assay (Fig. 1D, right panel). Thus, the hMSH5 1–225 fragment contains the core region for FANCJ interaction. Next, to validate the existence of a direct physical interaction between hMSH5 and FANCJ, we carried out GST pulldown assays. GST-tagged full-length and the 1–225 fragment of hMSH5 were able to interact with FANCJ, whereas none of the other hMSH5 fragments showed an interaction with FANCJ (Fig. 1E). In addition, the hMSH5-FANCJ interaction did not require the helicase activity of FANCJ or its interaction with BRCA1 (31Yu X. Chini C.C. He M. Mer G. Chen J. The BRCT domain is a phospho-protein binding domain.Science. 2003; 302: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 32Cantor S. Drapkin R. Zhang F. Lin Y. Han J. Pamidi S. Livingston D.M.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 2357-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that FANCJ is a direct hMSH5 binding partner. To gain insights into how hMSH5 was involved in CPT-provoked DNA damage response, especially enlightened by its interaction with FANCJ, we utilized a stable hMSH5 knockdown cell line 293T/hMSH5-sh2. The silencing effect by hMSH5 sh2 shRNA was confirmed by immunoblotting and quantification analysis (17Tompkins J.D. Wu X. Chu Y.L. Her C. Evidence for a direct involvement of hMSH5 in promoting ionizing radiation induced apoptosis.Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 2420-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Clonogenic survival assays showed that hMSH5 depleted cells were sensitive to CPT treatment, but not to doxorubicin or hydroxyurea, and this CPT sensitivity could be rescued by the expression of RNAi-resistant hMSH5 (Fig. 2B). To validate this observation and to rule out other potential nonspecific effects, hMSH5 was silenced in U2OS cells using either hMSH5 sh2 or sh4 shRNA (Fig. 2C). Depletion of hMSH5 had no effect on the levels of FANCJ and other HR proteins (Fig. 2D) (data not shown). Consistent with the role of hMSH5 in cisplatin (CDDP)-induced DNA damage repair (19Tompkins J.D. Wu X. Her C. MutS homologue hMSH5: role in cisplatin-induced DNA damage response.Mol. Cancer. 2012; 11: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), depletion of hMSH5 led to an increased sensitivity to both CDDP (1 h of treatment) and CPT (1 or 24 h of treatment) in U2OS cells (Fig. 2E; see also Fig. 7D). This sensitivity was hMSH5-dependent, because it could be reverted by the expression of RNAi-resistant hMSH5. Finally, it was evident that CPT sensitivity was related to the levels of hMSH5 (Fig. 2, C and E). Together, these results suggest that hMSH5 is involved in CPT-induced DNA damage repair.FIGURE 7hMSH5 promotes CPT-induced FANCJ chromatin recruitment.

Briefly, U2OS cells were treated with 1 μm CPT for 1 h. To determine the formation of CPT-induced γ-H2AX foci, cells were processed at 1, 4, and 8 h after CPT treatment. The pattern of γ-H2AX foci in the parental U2OS cells closely resembled those observed previously (33Chowdhury D. Keogh M.C. Ishii H. Peterson C.L. Buratowski S.

Cell. 2005; 20: 801-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Although silencing of hMSH5 had no effect on the initial γ-H2AX foci formation, the percentages of hMSH5-deficient cells positive for γ-H2AX (> 15 foci) were significantly higher than those of the controls at 4 and 8 h (Fig. 3, A and D). This suggested that the repair of CPT-induced DSBs was delayed in hMSH5-deficient cells. Likewise, in comparison to the control cells, the percentage of hMSH5-deficient cells positive for RPA2 foci (> 15 foci) increased significantly at 48 and 72 h after CPT treatment, indicating the p"
https://openalex.org/W1652129002,"There are many clinical features of flail arm syndrome (FAS) that are different from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), suggesting they are probably different entities. Studies on electrophysiological differences between them are limited at present, and still inconclusive. Therefore, we aimed to find clinical and neurophysiological differences between FAS and ALS. Eighteen healthy control subjects, six FAS patients and forty-one ALS patients were recruited. The upper motor neuron signs (UMNS), split-hand index (SI), resting motor threshold (RMT), central motor conduction time (CMCT) were evaluated and compared. There was no obvious upper motor neuron signs in FAS. The SI and RMT level in FAS was similar to control subjects, but significantly lower than that of in ALS. Compared with control group, the RMT and SI in ALS group were both significantly increased to higher level. However, no significant difference of CMCT was found between any two of these three groups. The differences in clinical and neurophysiological findings between FAS and ALS, argue against they are the same disease entity. Since there was no obvious UMNS, no split-hand phenomenon, and no obvious changes of RMT and CMCT in FAS patients, the development of FAS might be probably not originated from motor cortex."
https://openalex.org/W567699945,"Gynaephora (Lepidoptera Erebidae: Lymantriinae) is a small genus, consisting of 15 nominated species, of which eight species are endemic to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). In this study, we employed both mitochondrial and nuclear loci to infer a molecular phylogeny for the eight QTP Gynaephora spp. We used the phylogeny to estimate divergence dates in a molecular dating analysis and to delimit species. This information allowed us to investigate associations between the diversification history of the eight QTP species and geological and climatic events. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that the eight QTP species formed a monophyletic group with strong supports in both Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses. The low K2P genetic distances between the eight QTP species suggested that diversification occurred relatively quickly and recently. Out of the eight species, five species were highly supported as monophyletic, which were also recovered by species delimitation analyses. Samples of the remaining three species (G. aureata, G. rouergensis, and G. minora) mixed together, suggesting that further studies using extensive population sampling and comprehensive morphological approaches are necessary to clarify their species status. Divergence time estimation results demonstrated that the diversification and speciation of Gynaephora on the QTP began during the late Miocene/early Pliocene and was potentially affected by the QTP uplift and associated climate changes during this time."
https://openalex.org/W1903125330,"This study aimed to determine the HBV infection status of 135 patients with DLBCL (diffuse large B cell lymphoma), to analyze the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of the different HBV infection status groups, and to discuss the relationship between HBV serological test results and the prognosis of DLBCL patients.A retrospective analysis was performed of the clinical data, HBV serological test results, and PFS/OS of 135 DLBCL patients who were initially diagnosed and treated with more than 3 cycles of an R-CHOP/CHOP/CHOP-like regimen at our center from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2012.The patients in the HBV infection group were older at disease onset (≥60 years old) and were more likely to present with stage 3-4 disease compared with the HBV-free group (P = 0.030 and P = 0.025, respectively). Approximately 50% of the patients with an active HBV infection required a reduction in the chemotherapy dose, and 66.7% of the patients in this group received more than 1 line of therapy; these rates were significantly higher than those in the no infection group (P = 0.003 and P = 0.011, respectively). Although HBV infection had no obvious influence on the outcome of first-line therapy, patients with an inactive infection had a higher relapse/progression rate within 3 months after a CR/PR than patients with an active infection (14/20 vs. 1/12, P = 0.001). The PFS at 1 year, 3 years and OS rates at 1 year, 3 years were significantly lower in the active HBV infection group than in the HBV-free group (P = 0.008, P = 0.002, P = 0.004, and P = 0.002, respectively). The PFS rates at 1 year and 3 year in HBV-free group were higher than those in the HBV infection group (80.5% and 52.9% P = 0.001, 78.1% and 44.4% P = 0.002). The lymphoma-related mortality rates were 2.7% in the no infection group, 19.2% in the HBV infection group (P = 0.004), and 28.6% in the active HBV infection group (P = 0.001). Among the patients treated with MabThera, the PFS in the HBV infection group was 11 months in the HBV infection group and 67 months in the infection-free group (P = 0.000). A Cox regression model of PFS revealed that age ≥60 years and HBV infection were independent prognostic factors (age: P = 0.019, HR = 2.002, 95% CI 1.123-3.567; HBV infection: P = 0.026, HR = 0.494, 95% CI 0.265-0.919).Compared with the patients in HBV-free group, those in the HBV infection group were older at disease onset, and the active infection patients presented with more advanced disease and had a lower PFS at 1, 3 years as well as a lower OS at 3 years. The patients in the inactive infection group had a higher progression/relapse rate within 3 months after a CR/PR than those in the active infection group. HBV infection was an unfavorable factor for PFS in the MabThera group. An age ≥60 years and HBV infection were independent unfavorable prognostic factors for PFS."

We aimed to provide a framework of registration from breast MRI to mammography and to evaluate the diagnosis using the combined information.43 patients with 46 lesions underwent both MRI and mammography scans, and the interval between the two examinations was around one month. The distribution of malignant to benign lesions was 31/46 based on histological results. Maximum intensity projection and thin-plate spline methods were applied for image registration for MRI to mammography. The diagnosis using integrated information was evaluated using results of histology as the reference. The assessment of annotations and statistical analysis were performed by the two radiologists.For the cranio-caudal view, the mean post-registration error between MRI and mammography was 2.2±1.9 mm. For the medio-lateral oblique view, the proposed approach performed even better with a mean error of 3.0±2.4 mm. In the diagnosis using MRI assessment with information of mammography, the sensitivity was 91.9±2.3% (29/31, 28/31), specificity 70.0±4.7% (11/15, 10/15), accuracy 84.8±3.1% (40/46, 38/46), positive predictive value 86.4±2.1% (29/33, 28/33) and negative predictive value 80.8±5.4% (11/13, 10/13).MRI with the aid of mammography shows potential improvements of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV and NPV in clinical breast cancer diagnosis compared to the use of MRI alone."
https://openalex.org/W599495966,"Epimastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi (the etiologic agent of Chagas disease) internalize and store extracellular macromolecules in lysosome-related organelles (LROs) called reservosomes, which are positive for the cysteine protease cruzipain. Despite the importance of endocytosis for cell proliferation, macromolecule internalization remains poorly understood in the most clinically relevant proliferative form, the intracellular amastigotes found in mammalian hosts. The main obstacle was the lack of a simple method to isolate viable intracellular amastigotes from host cells. In this work we describe the fast and efficient isolation of viable intracellular amastigotes by nitrogen decompression (cavitation), which allowed the analysis of amastigote endocytosis, with direct visualization of internalized cargo inside the cells. The method routinely yielded 5x10(7) amastigotes--with typical shape and positive for the amastigote marker Ssp4--from 5x10(6) infected Vero cells (48 h post-infection). We could visualize the endocytosis of fluorescently-labeled transferrin and albumin by isolated intracellular amastigotes using immunofluorescence microscopy; however, only transferrin endocytosis was detected by flow cytometry (and was also analyzed by western blotting), suggesting that amastigotes internalized relatively low levels of albumin. Transferrin binding to the surface of amastigotes (at 4°C) and its uptake (at 37°C) were confirmed by binding dissociation assays using acetic acid. Importantly, both transferrin and albumin co-localized with cruzipain in amastigote LROs. Our data show that isolated T. cruzi intracellular amastigotes actively ingest macromolecules from the environment and store them in cruzipain-positive LROs functionally related to epimastigote reservosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1562750257,"One of the fundamental functions of molecular chaperone proteins is to selectively conjugate cellular proteins, targeting them directly to lysosome. Some of chaperones, such as the stress-induced Hsp70, also play important roles in autophagosome-forming macroautophagy under various stress conditions. However, the role of their co-chaperones in autophagy regulation has not been well defined. We here show that Tid1, a DnaJ co-chaperone for Hsp70 and the mammalian homologue of the Drosophila tumor suppressor Tid56, is a key mediator of macroautophagy pathway. Ectopic expression of Tid1 induces autophagy by forming LC3+ autophagosome foci, whereas silencing Tid1 leads to drastic impairment of autophagy as induced by nutrient deprivation or rapamycin. In contrast, Hsp70 is dispensable for a role in nutrient deprivation-induced autophagy. The murine Tid1 can be replaced with human Tid1 in murine fibroblast cells for induction of autophagy. We further show that Tid1 increases autophagy flux by interacting with the Beclin1-PI3 kinase class III protein complex in response to autophagy inducing signal and that Tid1 is an essential mediator that connects IκB kinases to the Beclin1-containing autophagy protein complex. Together, these results reveal a crucial role of Tid1 as an evolutionarily conserved and essential mediator of canonical macroautophagy."

Our study outlines the establishment of an automated and easy to use untargeted metabolomics workflow for HPLC-high resolution mass spectrometry data. Automated data analysis workflows based on open source software (OpenMS, KNIME) enabled a comprehensive and reproducible analysis of the complex and voluminous metabolomics data produced by the profiling approach.

To obtain a more comprehensive picture of the mode of action, transcriptomics and proteomics data were also integrated. For toxicity profiling of chloroacetaldehyde, 428 and 317 metabolite features were detectable in positive and negative modes, respectively, after stringent removal of chemical noise and unstable signals. Changes upon treatment were explored using principal component analysis, and statistically significant differences were identified using linear models for microarray assays. The analysis revealed toxic effects only for the treatment with 35 μmol·liter−1 for 3 and 14 days. The most regulated metabolites were glutathione and metabolites related to the oxidative stress response of the cells.

https://openalex.org/W1846410776,"Introduction Several clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in reducing HIV risk. One concern with introducing PrEP is whether users will engage in riskier sexual behaviors. Methods We assessed the effect that PrEP may have on sexual risk behaviors by administering a survey to 799 women in Bondo, Kenya, and Pretoria, South Africa. Participants were asked about their sexual behavior intentions twice — once as if they were taking PrEP and once as if they were not taking PrEP — within four risk situations (vignettes). They responded using a 5-point ordinal scale. We used a series of linear mixed effects models with an unstructured residual covariance matrix to estimate the between- and within-subject differences in the mean likelihood of engaging in risky sexual behavior across the PrEP and non-PrEP contexts. We also calculated the total percentage of participants who reported a greater likelihood of engaging in risky sexual behavior if taking PrEP than if not taking PrEP, by vignette. Results We found statistically significant differences in the mean likelihood of engaging in risky sexual behavior with the between-subject comparison (-0.17, p < 0.01) and with the within-subject comparison (-0.31, p < 0.001). Depending on the vignette, 27% to 40% of participants reported a greater likelihood of engaging in risky sexual behavior if taking PrEP than if not taking PrEP. Conclusions Our findings indicate that modest increases in risky sexual behavior could occur with PrEP. Although responses from the majority of participants suggest they would not be more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior if they took PrEP, a substantial proportion might. Programs rolling out PrEP should be prepared to assist similar women in making informed choices about reducing their risk of HIV and about their sexual health beyond HIV prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2206169569,"Introduction Paravertebral block (PVB) is an alternative to general anaesthesia (GA) for breast surgery. However, for extensive surgery multiple punctures are needed increasing the immanent risk of the method. The purpose of this study was to evaluate PVB via catheter and injections at three different levels. Primary outcome was the quality of postoperative analgesia, in particular, the number of patients requiring additional morphine. Methods In a randomised single blinded clinical study patients scheduled for breast surgery including axillary approach, were randomly allocated to different anaesthetic techniques, n = 35 each. Patients received either GA with sevoflurane or PVB with catheter at level Th 4. In PVB-patients a 1:2 mixture of bupivacaine 0.5% and lidocaine 2% with adrenaline was injected sequentially 10 ml each at three different levels. Results Complication-free catheter insertion was possible in all 35 scheduled patients. The need for postoperative analgesics was higher after GA compared to PVB (22 vs.14 patients); p = 0.056. Postoperative morphine consumption was 1.55 (GA) and 0.26 mg (PVB) respectively (p < 0.001). Visual rating score (VRS) for pain at rest and at movement was higher in GA patients on post anaesthesia care unit (PACU) as well as on the ward at 1 - 6h and 6 - 12h. Readiness for discharge was earlier after PVB (4.96 and 6.52 hours respectively). After GA the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was higher, though not significantly. Patients’ satisfaction was comparable in both groups. Conclusions Three-level injection PVB via catheter for extensive mastectomy was efficient and well accepted. Using a catheter may enhance safety by avoiding multiple paravertebral punctures when extended spread of analgesia is required. Trial Registration www.ClinicalTrial.gov NCT02065947"
https://openalex.org/W616514718,"Influenza viruses pose a serious global health threat, particularly in light of newly emerging strains, such as the avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9 viruses. Vaccination remains the primary method for preventing acquiring influenza or for avoiding developing serious complications related to the disease. Vaccinations based on inactivated split virus vaccines or on chemically inactivated whole virus have some important drawbacks, including changes in the immunogenic properties of the virus. To induce a greater mucosal immune response, intranasally administered vaccines are highly desired as they not only prevent disease but can also block the infection at its primary site. To avoid these drawbacks, hydrostatic pressure has been used as a potential method for viral inactivation and vaccine production. In this study, we show that hydrostatic pressure inactivates the avian influenza A H3N8 virus, while still maintaining hemagglutinin and neuraminidase functionalities. Challenged vaccinated animals showed no disease signs (ruffled fur, lethargy, weight loss, and huddling). Similarly, these animals showed less Evans Blue dye leakage and lower cell counts in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with the challenged non-vaccinated group. We found that the whole inactivated particles were capable of generating a neutralizing antibody response in serum, and IgA was also found in nasal mucosa and feces. After the vaccination and challenge we observed Th1/Th2 cytokine secretion with a prevalence of IFN-γ. Our data indicate that the animals present a satisfactory immune response after vaccination and are protected against infection. Our results may pave the way for the development of a novel pressure-based vaccine against influenza virus."
https://openalex.org/W659141122,"To examine regulatory effects of β-catenin on the biosynthesis and release of substance P, a rat chronic constriction injury (CCI) model and a rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cell culture model were used in the present study. The CCI treatment significantly induced the overall expression of β-catenin (158 ± 6% of sham) in the ipsilateral L5 DRGs in comparison with the sham group (109 ± 4% of sham). The CCI-induced aberrant expression of β-catenin was significantly attenuated by oral administration of diclofenac (119 ± 6% of the sham value; 10 mg/kg). Importantly, aberrant nuclear accumulation of β-catenin in cultured DRG cells resulted in up-regulation of the PPT-A mRNA expression and the substance P release. The up-regulation of both the PPT-A mRNA expression and the substance P release by either a GSK-3β inhibitor TWS119 (10 μM) or a Wnt signaling agonist Wnt-3a (100 ng/ml) were significantly abolished by an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2; NS-398, 1 μM). Collectively, these data suggest that nociceptive input-activated β-catenin signaling plays an important role in regulating the biosynthesis and release of substance P, which may contribute to the inflammation responses related to chronic pain."

It shows an emission spectrum peak at 610 nm when it is excited at 360 nm, with a large Stock shift (250 nm). It is covalently coated on the surface of a bare silica nanosphere containi free amino groups, using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride and N-Hydroxysuccinimide. We also observed an interesting phenomenon that when BC-EDTA is labeled with a silica nanosphere, the chelate shows different excitation spectrum peaks of about 295 nm. We speculate that the carboxyl has a significant influence on its excitation spectrum. The BC-EDTA/Eu3+coated nanosphere could be used as a fluorescent probe for time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay. We labeled the antibody with the fluorescent nanosphere to develop a nanosphere based hepatitis B surface antigen as a time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay reagent, which is very easy to operate and eliminates potential contamination of Eu3+ contained in the environment. The analytical and functional sensitivities are 0.0037 μg/L and 0.08 μg/L (S/N≥2.0) respectively. The detection range is 0.08-166.67 μg/L, which is much wider than that of ELISA (0.2-5 μg/L). It is comparable to the commercial dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluoro-immunoassay system (DELFIA) reagents (0.2-145 μg/L). We propose that it can fulfill clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W633503942,"Background Prior studies indicate a possible association between depression and cholecystectomy, but no study has compared the risk of post-operative depressive disorders (DD) after cholecystectomy. This retrospective follow-up study aimed to examine the relationship between cholecystectomy and the risk of DD in patients with gallstones in a population-based database. Methods Using ambulatory care data from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000, 6755 patients who received a first-time principal diagnosis of gallstones at the emergency room (ER) were identified. Among them, 1197 underwent cholecystectomy. Each patient was then individually followed-up for two years to identify those who were later diagnosed with DD. Cox proportional hazards regressions were performed to estimate the risk of developing DD between patients with gallstone who did and those who did not undergo cholecystectomy. Results Of 6755 patients with gallstones, 173 (2.56%) were diagnosed with DD during the two-year follow-up. Among patients who did and those who did not undergo cholecystectomy, 3.51% and 2.36% later developed depressive disorder, respectively. After adjusting for the patient’s sex, age and geographic location, the hazard ratio (HR) of DD within two years of gallstone diagnosis was 1.43 (95% CI, 1.02–2.04) for patients who underwent cholecystectomy compared to those who did not. Females, but not males, had a higher the adjusted HR of DD (1.61; 95% CI, 1.08–2.41) for patients who underwent cholecystectomy compared to those who did not. Conclusions There is an association between cholecystectomy and subsequent risk of DD among females, but not in males."
https://openalex.org/W1548016219,"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare segmental progeroid disorder commonly caused by a point mutation in the LMNA gene that results in the increased activation of an intra-exonic splice site and the production of a truncated lamin A protein, named progerin. In our previous work, induced murine epidermal expression of this specific HGPS LMNA mutation showed impaired keratinocyte differentiation and upregulated lamin B receptor (LBR) expression in suprabasal keratinocytes. Here, we have developed a novel transgenic animal model with induced overexpression of LBR in the interfollicular epidermis. LBR overexpression resulted in epidermal hypoplasia, along with the downregulation and mislocalization of keratin 10, suggesting impaired keratinocyte differentiation. Increased LBR expression in basal and suprabasal cells did not coincide with increased proliferation. Similar to our previous report of HGPS mice, analyses of γH2AX, a marker of DNA double-strand breaks, revealed an increased number of keratinocytes with multiple foci in LBR-overexpressing mice compared with wild-type mice. In addition, suprabasal LBR-positive cells showed densely condensed and peripherally localized chromatin. Our results show a moderate skin differentiation phenotype, which indicates that upregulation of LBR is not the sole contributor to the HGPS phenotype."

Differentiated bronchial air-liquid interface cultures from asthmatic children display high goblet cell numbers. Epidermal growth factor and its receptor have been implicated in goblet cell hyperplasia.We hypothesised that EGF removal or tyrphostin AG1478 treatment of differentiating air-liquid interface cultures from asthmatic children would result in a reduction of epithelial goblet cells and mucus secretion.In Aim 1 primary bronchial epithelial cells from non-asthmatic (n = 5) and asthmatic (n = 5) children were differentiated under EGF-positive (10 ng/ml EGF) and EGF-negative culture conditions for 28 days. In Aim 2, cultures from a further group of asthmatic children (n = 5) were grown under tyrphostin AG1478, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, conditions. All cultures were analysed for epithelial resistance, markers of differentiation using immunocytochemistry, ELISA for MUC5AC mucin secretion and qPCR for MUC5AC mRNA.In cultures from asthmatic children the goblet cell number was reduced in the EGF negative group (p = 0.01). Tyrphostin AG1478 treatment of cultures from asthmatic children had significant reductions in goblet cells at 0.2 μg/ml (p = 0.03) and 2 μg/ml (p = 0.003) as well as mucus secretion at 2 μg/ml (p = 0.04).We have shown in this preliminary study that through EGF removal and tyrphostin AG1478 treatment the goblet cell number and mucus hypersecretion in differentiating air-liquid interface cultures from asthmatic children is significantly reduced. This further highlights the epidermal growth factor receptor as a potential therapeutic target to inhibit goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus hypersecretion in asthma."
