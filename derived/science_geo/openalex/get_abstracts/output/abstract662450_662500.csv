https://openalex.org/W3095683209,"Estimating the size of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the infection severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is made challenging by inconsistencies in the available data. The number of deaths associated with COVID-19 is often used as a key indicator for the size of the epidemic, but the observed number of deaths represents only a minority of all infections1,2. In addition, the heterogeneous burdens in nursing homes and the variable reporting of deaths of older individuals can hinder direct comparisons of mortality rates and the underlying levels of transmission across countries3. Here we use age-specific COVID-19-associated death data from 45 countries and the results of 22 seroprevalence studies to investigate the consistency of infection and fatality patterns across multiple countries. We find that the age distribution of deaths in younger age groups (less than 65 years of age) is very consistent across different settings and demonstrate how these data can provide robust estimates of the share of the population that has been infected. We estimate that the infection fatality ratio is lowest among 5-9-year-old children, with a log-linear increase by age among individuals older than 30 years. Population age structures and heterogeneous burdens in nursing homes explain some but not all of the heterogeneity between countries in infection fatality ratios. Among the 45 countries included in our analysis, we estimate that approximately 5% of these populations had been infected by 1 September 2020, and that much higher transmission rates have probably occurred in a number of Latin American countries. This simple modelling framework can help countries to assess the progression of the pandemic and can be applied in any scenario for which reliable age-specific death data are available."

In the Protection against Allergy: Study in Rural Environments (PASTURE) birth cohort, we modeled maturation using 16S rRNA sequence data of the human gut microbiome in infants from 2 to 12 months of age. The estimated microbiome age (EMA) in 12-month-old infants was associated with previous farm exposure (β = 0.27 (0.12-0.43), P = 0.001, n = 618) and reduced risk of asthma at school age (odds ratio (OR) = 0.72 (0.56-0.93), P = 0.011). EMA mediated the protective farm effect by 19%. In a nested case-control sample (n = 138), we found inverse associations of asthma with the measured level of fecal butyrate (OR = 0.28 (0.09-0.91), P = 0.034), bacterial taxa that predict butyrate production (OR = 0.38 (0.17-0.84), P = 0.017) and the relative abundance of the gene encoding butyryl-coenzyme A (CoA):acetate-CoA-transferase, a major enzyme in butyrate metabolism (OR = 0.43 (0.19-0.97), P = 0.042). The gut microbiome may contribute to asthma protection through metabolites, supporting the concept of a gut-lung axis in humans."
https://openalex.org/W3095349481,"Objective Poor housing conditions have been linked with worse health outcomes and infectious disease spread. Since the relationship of poor housing conditions with incidence and mortality of COVID-19 is unknown, we investigated the association between poor housing condition and COVID-19 incidence and mortality in US counties. Methods We conducted cross-sectional analysis of county-level data from the US Centers for Disease Control, US Census Bureau and John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center for 3135 US counties. The exposure of interest was percentage of households with poor housing conditions (one or greater of: overcrowding, high housing cost, incomplete kitchen facilities, or incomplete plumbing facilities). Outcomes were incidence rate ratios (IRR) and mortality rate ratios (MRR) of COVID-19 across US counties through 4/21/2020. Multilevel generalized linear modeling (with total population of each county as a denominator) was utilized to estimate relative risk of incidence and mortality related to poor housing conditions with adjustment for population density and county characteristics including demographics, income, education, prevalence of medical comorbidities, access to healthcare insurance and emergency rooms, and state-level COVID-19 test density. We report incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and mortality ratios (MRRs) for a 5% increase in prevalence in households with poor housing conditions. Results Across 3135 US counties, the mean percentage of households with poor housing conditions was 14.2% (range 2.7% to 60.2%). On April 21st, the mean (SD) number of cases and deaths of COVID-19 were 255.68 (2877.03) cases and 13.90 (272.22) deaths per county, respectively. In the adjusted models standardized by county population, with each 5% increase in percent households with poor housing conditions, there was a 50% higher risk of COVID-19 incidence (IRR 1.50, 95% CI: 1.38–1.62) and a 42% higher risk of COVID-19 mortality (MRR 1.42, 95% CI: 1.25–1.61). Results remained similar using earlier timepoints (3/31/2020 and 4/10/2020). Conclusions and relevance Counties with a higher percentage of households with poor housing had higher incidence of, and mortality associated with, COVID-19. These findings suggest targeted health policies to support individuals living in poor housing conditions should be considered in further efforts to mitigate adverse outcomes associated with COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3096101680,"Abstract Domestication of the apple was mainly driven by interspecific hybridization. In the present study, we report the haplotype-resolved genomes of the cultivated apple ( Malus domestica cv. Gala) and its two major wild progenitors, M. sieversii and M. sylvestris . Substantial variations are identified between the two haplotypes of each genome. Inference of genome ancestry identifies ~23% of the Gala genome as of hybrid origin. Deep sequencing of 91 accessions identifies selective sweeps in cultivated apples that originated from either of the two progenitors and are associated with important domestication traits. Construction and analyses of apple pan-genomes uncover thousands of new genes, with hundreds of them being selected from one of the progenitors and largely fixed in cultivated apples, revealing that introgression of new genes/alleles is a hallmark of apple domestication through hybridization. Finally, transcriptome profiles of Gala fruits at 13 developmental stages unravel ~19% of genes displaying allele-specific expression, including many associated with fruit quality."
https://openalex.org/W3097490630,"In the eighteenth century, Daniel Bernoulli, Adam Smith and Jeremy Bentham proposed that economic choices rely on the computation and comparison of subjective values1. This hypothesis continues to inform modern economic theory2 and research in behavioural economics3, but behavioural measures are ultimately not sufficient to verify the proposal4. Consistent with the hypothesis, when agents make choices, neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) encode the subjective value of offered and chosen goods5. Value-encoding cells integrate multiple dimensions6–9, variability in the activity of each cell group correlates with variability in choices10,11 and the population dynamics suggests the formation of a decision12. However, it is unclear whether these neural processes are causally related to choices. More generally, the evidence linking economic choices to value signals in the brain13–15 remains correlational16. Here we show that neuronal activity in the OFC is causal to economic choices. We conducted two experiments using electrical stimulation in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Low-current stimulation increased the subjective value of individual offers and thus predictably biased choices. Conversely, high-current stimulation disrupted both the computation and the comparison of subjective values, and thus increased choice variability. These results demonstrate a causal chain linking subjective values encoded in OFC to valuation and choice. Direct electrical stimulation of the brain in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) predictably varied subjective valuation and choices, linking valuation and economic decision making to the orbitofrontal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W3094898198,"There is an urgent need for an accurate antibody test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We have developed 3 ELISA methods, trimer spike IgA, trimer spike IgG, and nucleocapsid IgG, for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We evaluated their performance along with four commercial ELISAs, EDI™ Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 ELISA IgG and IgM, Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG and IgA, and one lateral flow assay, DPP® COVID-19 IgM/IgG System (Chembio). Both sensitivity and specificity were evaluated and the probable causes of false-positive reactions were determined. The assays were evaluated using 300 pre-epidemic samples and 100 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 samples. The sensitivities and specificities of the assays were as follows: 90%/100% (in-house trimer spike IgA), 90%/99.3% (in-house trimer spike IgG), 89%/98.3% (in-house nucleocapsid IgG), 73.7%/100% (EDI nucleocapsid IgM), 84.5%/95.1% (EDI nucleocapsid IgG), 95%/93.7% (Euroimmun S1 IgA), 82.8%/99.7% (Euroimmun S1 IgG), 82.0%/91.7% (Chembio nucleocapsid IgM), 92%/93.3% (Chembio nucleocapsid IgG). The presumed causes of false positive results from pre-epidemic samples in commercial and in-house assays were mixed. In some cases, assays lacked reproducibility. In other cases, reactivity was abrogated by competitive inhibition (spiking the sample with the same antigen that was used for coating ELISAs prior to performing the assay), suggesting positive reaction could be attributed to the presence of antibodies against these antigens. In other cases, reactivity was consistently detected but not abrogated by the spiking, suggesting positive reaction was not attributed to the presence of antibodies against these antigens. Overall, there was wide variability in assay performance using our samples, with in-house tests exhibiting the highest combined sensitivity and specificity. The causes of “false positivity” in pre-epidemic samples may be due to plasma antibodies apparently reacting with the corresponding antigen, or spurious reactivity may be directed against non-specific components in the assay system. Identification of these targets will be essential to improving assay performance."
https://openalex.org/W3096640152,"Background Rapid and extensive testing of large parts of the population and specific subgroups is crucial for proper management of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and decision-making in times of a pandemic outbreak. However, point-of-care (POC) testing in places such as emergency units, outpatient clinics, airport security points or the entrance of any public building is a major challenge. The need for thermal cycling and nucleic acid isolation hampers the use of standard PCR-based methods for this purpose. Methods To avoid these obstacles, we tested PCR-independent methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from primary material (nasopharyngeal swabs) including reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking (SHERLOCK). Results Whilst specificity of standard RT-LAMP assays appears to be satisfactory, sensitivity does not reach the current gold-standard quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays yet. We describe a novel multiplexed RT-LAMP approach and validate its sensitivity on primary samples. This approach allows for fast and reliable identification of infected individuals. Primer optimization and multiplexing helps to increase sensitivity significantly. In addition, we directly compare and combine our novel RT-LAMP assays with SHERLOCK. Conclusion In summary, this approach reveals one-step multiplexed RT-LAMP assays as a prime-option for the development of easy and cheap POC test kits."
https://openalex.org/W3096781140,"Trimethylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) regulates gene repression, cell-fate determination and differentiation. We report that a conserved bromo-adjacent homology (BAH) module of BAHCC1 (BAHCC1BAH) 'recognizes' H3K27me3 specifically and enforces silencing of H3K27me3-demarcated genes in mammalian cells. Biochemical, structural and integrated chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing-based analyses demonstrate that direct readout of H3K27me3 by BAHCC1 is achieved through a hydrophobic trimethyl-L-lysine-binding 'cage' formed by BAHCC1BAH, mediating colocalization of BAHCC1 and H3K27me3-marked genes. BAHCC1 is highly expressed in human acute leukemia and interacts with transcriptional corepressors. In leukemia, depletion of BAHCC1, or disruption of the BAHCC1BAH-H3K27me3 interaction, causes derepression of H3K27me3-targeted genes that are involved in tumor suppression and cell differentiation, leading to suppression of oncogenesis. In mice, introduction of a germline mutation at Bahcc1 to disrupt its H3K27me3 engagement causes partial postnatal lethality, supporting a role in development. This study identifies an H3K27me3-directed transduction pathway in mammals that relies on a conserved BAH 'reader'."
https://openalex.org/W3095611507,"Information processing in the brain depends on specialized organization of neurotransmitter receptors and scaffolding proteins within the postsynaptic density. However, how these molecules are organized in situ remains largely unknown. In this study, template-free classification of oversampled sub-tomograms was used to analyze cryo-electron tomograms of hippocampal synapses. We identified type-A GABA receptors (GABAARs) in inhibitory synapses and determined their in situ structure at 19-Å resolution. These receptors are organized hierarchically: from GABAAR super-complexes with a preferred inter-receptor distance of 11 nm but variable relative angles, through semi-ordered, two-dimensional receptor networks with reduced Voronoi entropy, to mesophasic assembly with a sharp phase boundary. These assemblies likely form via interactions among postsynaptic scaffolding proteins and receptors and align with putative presynaptic vesicle release sites. Such mesophasic self-organization might allow synapses to achieve a ‘Goldilocks’ state, striking a balance between stability and flexibility and enabling plasticity in information processing. Using cryo-electron tomography to detect individual GABAA receptors in hippocampal synapses, we discovered a hierarchical and mesophasic organization of inhibitory postsynaptic density proteins that enables efficient synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3095033095,"The canonical model of agonist-stimulated phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K)-Akt signalling proposes that PI3K is activated at the plasma membrane, where receptors are activated and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate is concentrated. Here we show that phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate generation and activated Akt are instead largely confined to intracellular membranes upon receptor tyrosine kinase activation. Microtubule-associated protein 4 (MAP4) interacts with and controls localization of membrane vesicle-associated PI3Kα to microtubules. The microtubule-binding domain of MAP4 binds directly to the C2 domain of the p110α catalytic subunit. MAP4 controls the interaction of PI3Kα with activated receptors at endosomal compartments along microtubules. Loss of MAP4 results in the loss of PI3Kα targeting and loss of PI3K-Akt signalling downstream of multiple agonists. The MAP4-PI3Kα assembly defines a mechanism for spatial control of agonist-stimulated PI3K-Akt signalling at internal membrane compartments linked to the microtubule network."

Rapidly distinguishing COVID-19 from other respiratory infections is a challenge for first-line health care providers. This retrospective study was conducted at the Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taiwan. Patients who visited the outdoor epidemic prevention screening station for respiratory infection from February 19 to April 30, 2020, were evaluated for blood biomarkers to distinguish COVID-19 from other respiratory infections. Monocyte distribution width (MDW) ≥ 20 (odds ratio [OR]: 8.39, p = 0.0110, area under curve [AUC]: 0.703) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) < 3.2 (OR: 4.23, p = 0.0494, AUC: 0.673) could independently distinguish COVID-19 from common upper respiratory tract infections (URIs). Combining MDW ≥ 20 and NLR < 3.2 was more efficient in identifying COVID-19 (AUC: 0.840). Moreover, MDW ≥ 20 and NLR > 5 effectively identified influenza infection (AUC: 0.7055). Thus, MDW and NLR can distinguish COVID-19 from influenza and URIs."

https://openalex.org/W3094997487,"Introduction Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by varying degrees of lung inflammation and/or fibrosis. We investigated biomarkers to infer whether patients with collagen vascular diseases associated ILD (CVD–ILD) and interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) benefit from immunosuppressive therapy. Materials and methods We retrospectively investigated patients with CVD–ILD, IPAF, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) between June 2013 and May 2017 at our department. First, we assessed differences in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) levels of cytokines between groups. Second, we assessed the associations of patient’s clinical variables with serum and BALF levels of those cytokines that were different between groups. Finally, we assessed the associations of diagnosis and response to immunosuppressive therapy with serum levels of those cytokines that were different between groups. Results We included 102 patients (51 with IPF, 35 with IPAF, and 16 with CVD–ILD). Serum and BALF levels of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 were significantly elevated in patients with IPAF or CVD–ILD compared with those in patients with IPF. BALF levels of CXCL9 and CXCL10 were correlated with the percentages of lymphocytes and macrophages in BALF. Serum levels of CXCL9 and CXCL10 were correlated with BALF levels. Serum levels of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 were correlated C-reactive protein, percent predicted forced vital capacity, alveolar-arterial oxygen difference, and the percentages of lymphocytes and macrophages in BALF. Serum levels of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 showed moderate accuracy to distinguish patients with CVD–ILD from those with IPAF and IPF. Pre-treatment serum levels of CXCL9 and CXCL11 showed strong positive correlations with the annual forced vital capacity changes in patients with IPAF and CVD–ILD treated with immunosuppressive drugs. Conclusions Serum CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 are potential biomarkers for autoimmune inflammation and predictors of the immunosuppressive therapy responses in ILD with background autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W3095067352,"Introduction Electronic cigarette use (vaping) has become popular in recent years. The number of Americans with a variety of cognitive deficits has been increasing dramatically. This study aimed to examine the potential association of vaping with subjective cognitive complaints in US adults. Methods A combined 2016 and 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) national survey dataset yielded 886,603 adults who indicated their smoking and vaping status, as well as whether they had subjective cognitive complaints. With this dataset, the cross-sectional association of electronic cigarette use with subjective cognitive complaints was examined using multivariable weighted logistic regression models. Results Both dual users (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] = 2.07; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.66 to 2.60) and current vapers who were either ex-smokers (aOR = 1.94; 95% CI = 1.40 to 2.71) or never smoked (aOR = 1.96; 95% CI = 1.16 to 3.30) showed a significantly higher association with subjective cognitive complaints than never users. Current smokers (aOR = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.32 to 1.69) and ex-smokers (aOR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.41) had a significantly higher association with subjective cognitive complaints compared to never users. Compared to current smokers, the ex-smokers showed a lower association with subjective cognitive complaints (aOR = 0.84; 95% CI = 0.73 to 0.96). Finally, the association of vaping with subjective cognitive complaints was not statistically significant in individual age group. Conclusion Similar to smoking, vaping is associated with subjective cognitive complaints in US adults. These results provide preliminary evidence for a cross-sectional association of vaping with potential cognitive health effects in adults."
https://openalex.org/W3097828586,"Our previously study shown that Lysophosphatidylcholine Acyltransferase1 (LPCAT1) is overexpressed in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) relative to primary prostate cancer (PCa), and androgen controls its expression via the Wnt signaling pathway. While highly expressed in CRPC, the role of LPCAT1 remains unclear. In vitro cell experiments referred to cell transfection, mutagenesis, proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle progression and apoptosis, Western blotting, Pulse-chase RNA labeling. BALB/c nude mice were used for in vivo experiments. We found that LPCAT1 overexpression enhanced the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRPC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Silencing of LPCAT1 reduced the proliferation and the invasive capabilities of CRPC cells. Providing exogenous PAF to LPCAT1 knockdown cells increased their invasive capabilities; however platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) and the PAFR antagonist ABT-491 both reversed this phenotype; proliferation of CRPC cells was not affected in either model. LPCAT1 was found to mediate CRPC growth via nuclear re-localization and Histone H4 palmitoylation in an androgen-dependent fashion, increasing mRNA synthesis rates. We also found that LPCAT1 overexpression led to CRPC cell resistance to treatment with paclitaxel. LPCAT1 overexpression in CRPC cells drives tumor progression via increased mRNA synthesis and PAF production. Our results highlight LPCAT1 as a viable therapeutic target in the context of CRPC."
https://openalex.org/W3096540072,"Objective HIV-associated CNS dysfunction is a significant problem among people with HIV (PWH), who now live longer due to viral suppression from combined anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Over the course of infection, HIV generates toxic viral proteins and induces inflammatory cytokines that have toxic effects on neurons in the CNS. Among these viral proteins, HIV Nef has been found in neurons of postmortem brain specimens from PWH. However, the source of Nef and its impact on neuronal cell homeostasis are still elusive. Methods and results Here, in using a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infected rhesus macaque model of neuroHIV, we find SIV Nef reactivity in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of SIV-infected animals using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Interestingly, SIV-infected macaques treated with ART also showed frequent Nef positive cells in the cerebellum and hippocampus. Using dual quantitative RNAscope and IHC, we observed cells that were positive for Nef, but were not for SIV RNA, suggesting that Nef protein is present in cells that are not actively infected with SIV. Using cell specific markers, we observed Nef protein in microglia/macrophages and astrocytes. Importantly, we also identified a number of NeuN-positive neurons, which are not permissive to SIV infection, but contained Nef protein. Further characterization of Nef-positive neurons showed caspase 3 activation, indicating late stage apoptosis in the CNS neurons. Conclusions Our results suggest that regardless of ART status, Nef is expressed in the brain of SIV infected macaques and may contribute to neurological complications seen in PWH."

Although there is an established body of published research on TIR the critical roles that recruiters perform has only recently gained attention from researchers. In this study, we report on the practices that 12 full time Australian Football recruiters use to inform their TIR decisions. Inductive qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted using open-ended questions. Thematic analysis resulted in the identification of four primary themes (the recruiter, processes and practices, assessment and selection).

https://openalex.org/W3095311321,"Female sterilization is the most popular contraceptive method among Indian couples, and the public sector is the major source of sterilization services in the country. However, concerns remain on the quality of services provided, deaths, failures, and complications following sterilization. In this paper, we study the complexities around the quality of care in female sterilization services at public health facilities and identify strategies for improving the measurement of such quality. A better understanding of these issues could inform pragmatic strategies for enhancing quality. This study uses data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 2015–16 and District Level Household and Facility Survey (DLHS) 2012–13. The study is limited to only districts whose data are available in both DLHS 2012–13 and NFHS 2015–16. The methods of analysis include bivariate statistics, Pearson’s chi-square test, and two-level mixed-effects logistic regression. We found that the quality of care (QoC) in sterilization service at the public health facilities in India is associated with facility readiness and the socio-economic characteristics of the clients. There is a significant association between household wealth and the QoC received. Our study provides empirical shreds of evidence on the role of structural attributes in delivering quality sterilization services. The spatial analyses revealed the geographies in the country where the QoC and facility readiness are low. Quality should be an overriding priority to establish the credibility of any health care delivery system. It is essential to provide safeguards against adverse events to develop the client’s confidence in the services, which is the key to success for any voluntary family planning program like in India."
https://openalex.org/W3095646085,"Vulnerable narcissism and grandiose narcissism share the core of the narcissistic self but are considered as separate forms of this personality trait. While previous research mainly focused on the mechanisms that connect grandiose narcissism and addictive use of the social platform Facebook, it remained unclear why individuals with enhanced levels of vulnerable narcissism are at risk to develop Facebook Addiction (FA). The present study investigated the links between vulnerable and grandiose narcissism, anxiety symptoms, and FA. In a sample of 327 Facebook users (age: M ( SD ) = 23.67(3.96), range: 18–56), both forms of narcissism were positively related to anxiety symptoms and FA. Moreover, the association between both forms of narcissism and FA was partly mediated by anxiety symptoms. Results enter new territory by revealing hidden similarities between vulnerable and grandiose narcissists, emphasizing that similar mechanisms might explain their enhanced risk to develop addictive tendencies of Facebook use. These findings should be considered when assessing individuals at risk for FA and when developing (therapeutic) intervention programs to deal with problematic use of social platforms."
https://openalex.org/W3096765115,"Lumbar Spinal Stenosis causes low back pain through pressures exerted on the spinal nerves. This can be verified by measuring the anteroposterior diameter and foraminal widths of the patient’s lumbar spine. Our goal is to develop a novel strategy for assessing the extent of Lumbar Spinal Stenosis by automatically calculating these distances from the patient’s lumbar spine MRI. Our method starts with a semantic segmentation of T1- and T2-weighted composite axial MRI images using SegNet that partitions the image into six regions of interest. They consist of three main regions-of-interest, namely the Intervertebral Disc, Posterior Element, and Thecal Sac, and three auxiliary regions-of-interest that includes the Area between Anterior and Posterior elements. A novel contour evolution algorithm is then applied to improve the accuracy of the segmentation results along important region boundaries. Nine anatomical landmarks on the image are located by delineating the region boundaries found in the segmented image before the anteroposterior diameter and foraminal widths can be measured. The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated through a set of experiments on the Lumbar Spine MRI dataset containing MRI studies of 515 patients. These experiments compare the performance of our contour evolution algorithm with the Geodesic Active Contour and Chan-Vese methods over 22 different setups. We found that our method works best when our contour evolution algorithm is applied to improve the accuracy of both the label images used to train the SegNet model and the automatically segmented image. The average error of the calculated right and left foraminal distances relative to their expert-measured distances are 0.28 mm (p = 0.92) and 0.29 mm (p = 0.97), respectively. The average error of the calculated anteroposterior diameter relative to their expert-measured diameter is 0.90 mm (p = 0.92). The method also achieves 96.7% agreement with an expert opinion on determining the severity of the Intervertebral Disc herniations."
https://openalex.org/W3097945143,"Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that was originally identified in neurons. Our recent study showed that UCHL1 was expressed in C2C12 myoblast cells and mouse skeletal muscle. Here we report that in mouse skeletal muscle, UCHL1 is primarily expressed in oxidative muscle fibers. Skeletal muscle specific gene knockout (smKO) of UCHL1 in mice reduced oxidative activity in skeletal muscle measured by SDH staining. The in situ muscle contraction test revealed that gastrocnemius muscle from UCHL1 smKO mice was more prone to fatigue in response to the repetitive stimulation. This data suggests that UCHL1 plays a role in maintenance of muscle oxidative metabolism. Moreover, UCHL1 smKO caused a significant reduction in key proteins that are involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in soleus muscles, suggesting that UCHL1 may be involved in regulation of mitochondrial content and function. Immunostaining showed the co-localization of UCHL1 and mitochondrial marker VDAC in skeletal muscle. Mitochondrial fractionation assay revealed that, although UCHL1 was primarily present in the cytosolic fraction, a low level of UCHL1 protein was present in mitochondrial fraction. The level of phosphorylation of AMPKα, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, were unchanged in UCHL1 smKO muscle. On the other hand, immunoprecipitation from soleus muscle sample indicated the interaction between UCHL1 and HSP60, a chaperon protein that is involved in mitochondrial protein transport. There was a trend of downregulation of HSP60 in UCHL1 smKO muscle. Overall, our data suggests UCHL1 is a novel regulator of mitochondrial function and oxidative activity in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W3095655277,"Qinling-Daba Mountains (QDM), which are located in central China, are considered as a significant climatic boundary delimiting north and south. However, the influence of complex topographic and climatic features makes it challenging to identify the exact location of the boundary, and different scholars delimit the boundary with significant differences. In addition, there is a gradual transition between climate zones, and no real dividing line exists. To explore the climate regionalization of the QDM, we focused on the identification of the transition zone rather than the exact location of the boundary between subtropical and temperate zones. Thus, we proposed a new workflow for climate regionalization based on the Geodetector-SVM model (a combination of Geodetector and support vector machines). First, we selected the spatial distribution data of six vegetation types (including typical subtropical and temperate vegetation) to represent the spatial distribution of climatic zones. Environmental factors (such as topography, temperature, precipitation, and soil) were used as explanatory variables for the spatial distribution of vegetation. Second, using the Geodetector-SVM model, the distribution characteristics and suitable environment of typical vegetation in different climatic zones are comprehensively explored. By analyzing the multiple boundaries between subtropical and temperate vegetation, the location of the transition zone of the QDM was identified. The results revealed the following: (1) The new workflow for climate regionalization based on the Geodetector-SVM model is powerful for the identification of the transition zone. The q-statistics are generally greater than 0.35, indicating that the transition zone between subtropical and temperate zones can highly reflect the character of the QDM; (2) From west to east, the transition zone mainly passes through the cities of Heishui County, Kang County, Liuba County, and Yichuan County and is approximately 30 km wide."

Consistent ACD results were obtained for all quarters and months analyzed, with R2 values of 0.75–0.78, and root mean square errors (RMSE) between 20.6 and 22.0 Mg C ha-1. A total of 7.138 Pg C was estimated for Peru with annual ACE of 20.08 Tg C between the third quarters of 2017 and 2018, respectively, or 23.4% higher than estimates from the FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment. Analyzed quarterly, the spatial evolution of ACE revealed 11.5 Tg C, 6.6 Tg C, 8.6 Tg C, and 10.1 Tg C lost between the third quarters of 2017 and 2018. Moreover, our monthly analysis for the dry season reveals the evolution of ACE at unprecedented temporal detail. We discuss environmental controls over ACE and provide a spatially explicit tool for enhanced forest carbon management at scale."
https://openalex.org/W3094980778,"In this study, it was investigated whether early tweets counts could differentially benefit female and male (first, last) authors in terms of the later citation counts received. The data for this study comprised 47,961 articles in the research area of Life Sciences & Biomedicine from 2014-2016, retrieved from Web of Science's Medline. For each article, the number of received citations per year was downloaded from WOS, while the number of received tweets per year was obtained from PlumX. Using the hurdle regression model, I compared the number of received citations by female and male (first, last) authored papers and then I investigated whether early tweet counts could predict the later citation counts received by female and male (first, last) authored papers. In the regression models, I controlled for several important factors that were investigated in previous research in relation to citation counts, gender or Altmetrics. These included journal impact (SNIP), number of authors, open access, research funding, topic of an article, international collaboration, lay summary, F1000 Score and mega journal. The findings showed that the percentage of papers with male authors in first or last authorship positions was higher than that for female authors. However, female first and last-authored papers had a small but significant citation advantage of 4.7% and 5.5% compared to male-authored papers. The findings also showed that irrespective of whether the factors were included in regression models or not, early tweet counts had a weak positive and significant association with the later citations counts (3.3%) and the probability of a paper being cited (21.1%). Regarding gender, the findings showed that when all variables were controlled, female (first, last) authored papers had a small citation advantage of 3.7% and 4.2% in comparison to the male authored papers for the same number of tweets."
https://openalex.org/W3095069529,"Background The prevalence of metabolic syndrome is rising at an alarming rate and more common among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients in the world. The risk for cardiovascular disease is greater among individuals who have a combination of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and metabolic syndrome compared to those who have either alone. Objective To assess the proportion of metabolic syndrome and lifestyle factors among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients in Dessie Referral Hospital, Amhara Region, Ethiopia. Methods A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February to March 2017 among 343 randomly selected Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients. Three definitions of Metabolic syndrome were considered. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with metabolic syndrome. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported to show the strength of association. Statistical significance was declared at P-value < 0.05. Result The proportion of metabolic syndrome was 50.3%, 59.4% and 64.5% according to 2005 International Diabetes Federation, revised ATP III and 2009 harmonized criteria, respectively. Being female (AOR = 2.43; 95% CI = 1.40, 4.21), consumption of red meat (AOR = 2.61; 95% CI = 1.28, 5.33), sedentary leisure time activity (AOR = 2.65; 95% CI = 1.47, 4.78), coffee intake (AOR = 0.43; 95% CI = 0.21, 0.86), BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 (AOR = 9.59; 95% CI = 4.98, 18.47), 40–49 years of age (AOR = 2.74, 95% CI = (1.02, 7.37), 50–59 years of age (AOR = 4.22; 95% CI = 1.60, 11.11) and ≥70 years of age (AOR = 4.51, 95% CI = 1.44, 14.15) were significantly associated with metabolic syndrome. Conclusion and recommendation The proportion of metabolic syndrome was high among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients. Overweight and obesity, being female, age of respondent, intake of coffee, regular red meat consumption, and sedentary leisure-time activity were factors associated with metabolic syndrome. Counseling of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients on the need for spending leisure time with activities, intake of coffee, control of body weight, and avoidance of regular red meat consumption is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3094888744,"Ceramides, a type of sphingolipid, are cell membrane components and lipid mediators that modulate a variety of cell functions. In plants, ceramides are mostly present in a glucosylated glucosylceramide (GlcCer) form. We previously showed that oral administration of konjac-derived GlcCer to a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease reduced brain amyloid-β and amyloid plaques. Dietary plant GlcCer compounds are absorbed as ceramides, but it is unclear whether they can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Herein, we evaluated the BBB permeability of synthetic plant-type ceramides (4, 8-sphingadienine, d18:2) using mouse and BBB cell culture models, and found that they could permeate the BBB both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, administrated ceramides were partially metabolized to other sphingolipid species, namely sphingomyelin (SM) and GlcCer, while crossing the BBB. Thus, plant ceramides can cross the BBB, suggesting that ceramides and their metabolites might affect brain functions."
https://openalex.org/W3094923817,"Purpose To determine the impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on utilization of benefits of both eye care and primary care examinations in individuals who did not have health insurance prior to the ACA. Methods Patients examined in an urban eye clinic from 2017 to 2018 were invited to participate. Patients were classified into two groups: Insured Group, who had health insurance before and after the ACA; The ACA Group, who had insurance only after the ACA. Patients were surveyed on how often they were examined by their eye care and primary care physicians before and after the ACA. The care utilization frequency was categorized into 3 levels: Frequent Care Use, Rare Care Use, and Never. To test the utilization of benefits frequency difference between two groups, the z-ratio was calculated. Results A total of 4,355 patients were enrolled with 87.1% in the Insured Group and 12.9% in the ACA Group. After the ACA implementation, the percentage of “Frequent Care Use” of the eye care and primary care in the ACA Group patients significantly increased from 31.2% and 53.7% to 57.9% and 74.9%, respectively (P<0.001), but were significantly lower than those in the Insured Group (76.6% and 93.9%, P < 0.001). Conclusion The ACA significantly improved utilization of benefits of eye care and primary care for individuals in the ACA Group. Although improved, those patients who received health insurance through the ACA still had lower utilization of benefits than those in the Insured Group."
https://openalex.org/W3095198007,"Immunodeficiency is associated with cancer risk. Accordingly, hematolymphoid cancers develop in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), an X-linked primary immunodeficiency disorder (PID) resulting from the deficiency of WAS-protein (WASp) expressed predominantly in the hematolymphoid cell lineages. Despite the correlation between WASp deficiency and hematolymphoid cancers, the molecular mechanism underlying the oncogenic role of WASp is incompletely understood. Employing the WASp-sufficient and WASp-deficient cell-pair model of human T and B lymphocytes, we show that WASp deficiency differentially influences hyperactivation versus inhibition of both CDC42:ERK1/2 and NF-κB:AP-1 pro-oncogenic signaling pathways in nonmalignant versus malignant T and B lymphocytes. Furthermore, WASp deficiency induces a cell-type specific up/down-modulation of the DNA-binding activities of NF-κB, AP-1, and multiple other transcription factors with known roles in oncogenesis. We propose that WASp functions as a putative ""tumor-suppressor"" protein in normal T and B cells, and ""oncoprotein"" in a subset of established T and B cell malignancies that are not associated with the NPM-ALK fusion."
https://openalex.org/W3095313161,"SARS-CoV-2 is spreading globally with unprecedented consequences for modern societies. The early detection of infected individuals is a pre-requisite to contain the virus. Currently, purification of RNA from patient samples followed by RT-PCR is the gold standard to assess the presence of this single-strand RNA virus. However, these procedures are time consuming, require continuous supply of specialized reagents, and are prohibitively expensive in resource-poor settings. Here, we report an improved nucleic-acid-based approach to detect SARS-CoV-2 with the ability to detect as little as five viral genome equivalents. The approach delivers results without the need to purify RNA, reduces handling steps, minimizes costs, and allows evaluation by non-specialized equipment. The use of unprocessed swap samples is enabled by employing a heat-stable RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, which performs the double task of stringent reverse transcription of RNA at elevated temperatures as well as PCR amplification of a SARS-CoV-2 specific target gene. As results are obtained within 2 hours and can be read-out by a hand-held LED-screen, this novel protocol will be of particular importance for large-scale virus surveillance in economically constrained settings."
https://openalex.org/W3096563519,"The lack of information regarding the water requirement of tree species results in water waste in the seedlings production in nurseries. Water requirement, the growth plant factors and water efficiencies for height and diameter were determined for Schizolobium parahyba (Vell.) Blake, Cytharexylum myrianthum Cham. and Ceiba speciosa Ravenna seedlings, under automated irrigation management and greenhouse conditions, located at 22o45’53” S and 43o41’50” W. We used sewage sludge biosolids as substrate in the seedling phase (280 cm-3 tube), and sandy soil material in the initial pot growth phase (18 dm-3 pot). In the seedlings phase, four water replacement levels were applied to the substrate, by drip irrigation, corresponding to average replacement ranging from 40 (V1) to 100% (V4) of the species water requirement. Seedlings developed properly and 80 days after emergence, S. parahyba, C. myrianthum and C. speciosa seedlings received, respectively, 2.40, 1.08 and 0.85 L per plant, for V4. After growth phase (230 DAE), the total water volumes were, respectively, 70.0, 50.3 and 52.7 L per plant. Under adequate water supply, there were rapid recovery and growth of the species, even for the seedlings which showed different height and diameter in the tube phase. The growth plant factors values found were below 0.5 for all species indicating low sensitivity to growth, both in height and in diameter, in response to water deficit. Water efficiency indicators point to distinct trends between the two phases, and C. speciosa has higher values of water efficiencies for height (80.7 and 17.0 cm L-1) and diameter (2.1 and 0.5 mm L-1) in both phases."
https://openalex.org/W3097522339,"The core of urbanization is land use change, resulting in the urban sprawl and urban population explosion. The problem of land resources shortage and ecological environment destruction has become increasingly prominent. Land use change and human activities can directly lead to urban soil pollution. This study analyzed the concentration of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, Hg and As in the original site of Xi’an chlor-alkali chemical plant, which was know as a brownfield. The results showed the concentrations of Hg, Pb and Zn in research areas were obviously higher than soil background value. Through pollution index (PI) method and Geo-accumulation Index (Igeo) method, totally 26 sample points in different areas (A, B, C, D) were classified into different pollution degrees. The CPI results indicated 9 sample points were heavily polluted, accounting for 34.6% of the total. Among them, 6 out of 9 were located in area A. 12 samples points were not polluted. The average Igeo values of single heavy metal were arranged in the order of Hg (1.83) > Zn (1.26) > Pb (0.33). The pollution of Hg was relatively serious and extensive, especially in area A. It was mainly because of the historical pollution produced by chemical plant. The pollution of Pb in each point was quite different. Mainly influenced by automobile related activities, Igeo(Pb) in sample point 15 and 16 were all beyond 4.00. The average potential ecological risk (PER) of each area was in the order of A (1428) > B (297) > D (249) > C (163). The ecological risk was mainly determined by previous industrial production and present human activity at the same time. People and land are interdependent and interactive. The understanding on the mechanism of man-land interralations, regarding to urban land use and ecological environment, will promote urban sustainability."

An improved procedure was developed for high frequency androgenesis in japonica genotypes, K-332 and GS-88 and their F1s. A total of 207 fertile, green, di-haploid plants were generated from K-332 × GS-88 hybrids using the improved anther culture protocol. The investigation was carried out to evaluate callus induction potential and regeneration response for the genotypes and the derived F1s on N6 media and modified N6 media (N6M). Whereas, N6 failed to induce callusing, agarose solidified N6M media supplemented with 4% maltose, growth regulators; NAA (2 mg/l), 2, 4-D (0.5 mg/l), Kinetin (0.5 mg/l), and silver nitrate induced high calli percentage of 27.6% in F1s, 9.5% and 6.7% in GS-88 and K-332 respectively. Murashige and Skoog (MS) media supplemented with 3% sucrose, and the hormonal combination BAP (2 mg/l), Kinetin (1 mg/l) and NAA (1 mg/l) induced high green shoot regeneration rates (0–60.0%). The effect of cold pre-treatment at 4°C and the stage of anther collection and their interaction was studied. The effect of cold pre-treatment (CP) of collected boots at 4°C (for CP2: 2, CP4: 4, CP6: 6 and CP8: 8 days) at different stages of panicle emergence (BES4-6: 4–6, BES7-10: 7–10, BES11-13: 11–13, BES>13: more than 13 inches was worked out in relation to the effect on response of calli induction, albino regeneration, green plant regeneration and number of shoots/green calli. CP referred to the number of days for which the collected boots were incubated before they were inoculated. BES was the length (inches) between flag leaf and penultimate leaf at the time of boot collection. We concluded that CP6 and BES7-10 showed better response to callus proliferation and regeneration of plantlets across genotypes. The appropriate pre-treatment, stage of anther collection and favourable media composition resulted in high calli induction and green plant regeneration rates in recalcitrant japonica genotypes. The modified N6 media resulted into efficient callus induction and is expected to be useful for studies which aim at rapid generation of mapping populations for genetic studies."
https://openalex.org/W3097889326,"Background Postoperative delirium was reported to be associated with increased postoperative mortality after liver resection. Therefore, it is crucial to prevent postoperative delirium in such cases. Ramelteon, an agonist of melatonin receptor has been suggested to be useful for preventing delirium. The aim of this study was to examine whether ramelteon is effective at preventing delirium after elective liver resection. Methods The cases of patients who underwent liver resection at Nara Medical University (Nara, Japan) between January 2014 and August 2018 were analyzed. During the period from January 2017 to August 2018, ramelteon was prospectively administered to patients who underwent liver resection [8 mg/day on the day before surgery and on postoperative days 1 to 3] (ramelteon group), whereas ramelteon was not administered during the period from January 2014 to December 2016 (control group). The perioperative outcomes of the two groups were compared. Results There were 120 patients in the ramelteon group and 186 patients in the control group. No significant intergroup differences in background factors, including age, gender, and preoperative serological laboratory data, were detected. The incidence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower in the ramelteon group (5.8% vs. 15.1%, P = 0.035). Multivariate analysis revealed that being aged ≥75 (P = 0.002), being male (P = 0.020), cardiovascular disease (P = 0.023), blood loss ≥1000ml (P = 0.001) and the absence of ramelteon treatment (P = 0.046) were independent risk factors for postoperative delirium. Conclusion The administration of ramelteon might reduce the risk of postoperative delirium after elective liver resection."
https://openalex.org/W3095012872,"Introduction Studies of the delay between when companies file a New Drug Submission (NDS) and when drugs reach Canadian patients typically focus on the time in the regulatory review process and do not analyze the time between when approval is granted and the drug is available for purchase (company decision time). This study looks at the length of the two different time periods. Secondarily, it examines whether there is a difference in these time periods for drugs that received a standard review and those that received an expedited review. Methods A list of all New Active Substances approved in Canada between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2018 was compiled and the dates when the companies applied for a NDS, the dates when the drugs received a market authorization (Notice of Compliance, NOC) and whether the drugs received a standard review or an expedited review were recorded. The date of original marketing comes from Health Canada’s Drug Product Database. Times in days were calculated between NDS and NOC (review time), between NOC and the marketing date (company decision time) and between NDS and the marketing date (total time). The company decision time as a percent of the total time was calculated for all drugs. Times were compared between standard and expedited review drugs using a two-tailed t-test. Results One hundred and fifty-seven drugs were analyzed, 98 had a standard review and 59 had a priority review. Over 18% of the total time was due to company decisions. All three times were significantly lower for expedited review drugs versus standard review drugs as was the percent of total time due to company decision– 14.4% (95% CI 11.0, 17.8) versus 21.2% (95% CI 17.6, 24.8), p = 0.0102 (t-test). Conclusions Over 18% of the total time between when companies file for drug approval until the drug is available is due to decisions made by companies. Company decision times are shorter for drugs with expedited approvals compared to drugs with standard approvals."
https://openalex.org/W3096026826,"Background Improper breastfeeding practices significantly impair the health, development, and survival of infants, children, and mothers. A Breastfeeding Performance Index (BPI) is a composite index to describe overall maternal breastfeeding practice with infants under six months of age. To date, there is insufficient evidence on breastfeeding performance index and its associated factors in Ethiopia. Objective To assess the breastfeeding performance index and its associated factors in Sekela District, Northwest Ethiopia, 2019. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 605 randomly selected mothers having infants aged 6 to 12 months from April 02, 2019 to May 13, 2019. Data was collected using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify independent predictors of BPI. Results Two hundred forty-six (40.7%) of mothers had low BPI scores. Mothers who lived alone (AOR = 3.18; 95%CI: 1.15, 8.82), mothers who were merchants (AOR = 2.75; 95%CI:1.05, 7.15), attended three antenatal care (ANC) visits (AOR = 0.42; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.82), attended four antenatal care visits (AOR = 0.35; 95%CI: 0.12, 0.82), received postnatal care (PNC) (AOR = 0.35; 95%CI: 0.19, 0.64), had poor knowledge on breastfeeding (AOR = 3.19;95%CI: 1.14, 8.89) or negative attitudes towards breastfeeding (AOR = 2.70;95%CI: 1.13, 6.45), were independent predictors of low BPI scores. Conclusions The prevalence of sub-optimal breastfeeding practice in northwest Ethiopia was very high. A mother living alone, maternal occupation, ANC visits, PNC, maternal breastfeeding knowledge, and attitude towards breastfeeding were independent predictors of low BPI scores. Nutrition promotion should be implemented by considering the above significant factors to decrease inappropriate breastfeeding practice in Northwest Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W3097785477,"Autophagy is an important factor in liver ischemia-reperfusion injury. In the current study we investigate the function of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF1) in regulating autophagy to promote hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury (IR). The high expression of IRF1 during hepatic IR exhibited increased liver damage and was associated with activation of autophagy shown by Western blot markers, as well as immunofluorescent staining for autophagosomes. These effects were diminished by IRF1 deficiency in IRF1 knock out (KO) mice. Moreover, the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA decreased IR-induced liver necrosis and markedly abrogated the rise in liver injury tests (AST/ALT). β-catenin expression decreased during liver IR and was increased in the IRF1 KO mice. Immunoprecipitation assay showed the binding between IRF1 and β-catenin. Overexpression of IRF1 induced autophagy and also inhibited the expression of β-catenin. β-catenin inhibitor increased autophagy while β-catenin agonist suppressed autophagy in primary mouse hepatocytes. These results indicate that IRF1 induced autophagy aggravates hepatic IR injury in part by inhibiting β-catenin and suggests that targeting IRF1 may be an effective strategy in reducing hepatic IR injury."

Solea senegalensis is a commercially important flat fish in which females grow 30% faster than males. It has 2n = 42 chromosomes and an XX / XY chromosome system for sex determination, without heteromorph chromosomes but with sex proto-chromosome. In the present study, we are providing the genomic structure and nucleotide sequence of dmrt1 gene obtained from cDNA from male and female adult gonads. A cDNA of 2027 containing an open-reading frame (ORF) of 1206 bp and encoding a 402 aa protein it is described for dmrt1 gene of S. senegalensis. Multiple mRNA isoforms indicating a high variable system of alternative splicing in the expression of dmrt1 of the sole in gonads were studied. None isoforms could be related to sex of individuals. The genomic structure of the dmrt1 of S. senegalensis showed a gene of 31400 bp composed of 7 exons and 6 introns. It contains an unexpected duplication of more than 10399 bp, involving part of the exon I, exons II and III and a SINE element found in the sequence that it is proposed as responsible for the duplication. A mature miRNA of 21 bp in length was localized at 336 bp from exon V. Protein-protein interacting networks of the dmrt1 gene showed matches with dmrt1 protein from Cynoglossus semilaevis and a protein interaction network with 11 nodes (dmrt1 plus 10 other proteins). The phylogenetic relationship of the dmrt1 gene in S. senegalensis is consistent with the evolutionary position of its species. The molecular characterization of this gene will enhance its functional analysis and the understanding of sex differentiation in Solea senegalensis and other flatfish."
https://openalex.org/W3097522979,"Purpose To evaluate the long-term benefits in hearing-related quality of life, patient satisfaction and wearing time of patients rehabilitated with an active transcutaneous bone-conduction device. Adverse events and audiological outcomes are reported as secondary outcomes. Methods This retrospective, mono-centric cohort analysis involves 16 adults with conductive or mixed hearing loss with a mean device experience of 51.25 months. Patient-reported outcome measures were assessed using the short version of the Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ12-B) and the German version of the Audio Processor Satisfaction Questionnaire (APSQ). Audiological outcomes as well as incidence of adverse events were obtained from patients´ charts. Results The hearing-related quality of life improved significantly within all subscales of the SSQ12-B scoring a mean overall of 2.95 points. Patient satisfaction measured with the APSQ scored 8.8 points on average. Wearing times differed considerably and patients with lower levels of education seemed to use their device longer compared to patients with academic education. Eight minor adverse events were documented, all of which resolved during follow-up. The mean gain in word recognition score at the last follow-up measured at 65 dB was 75.9%, while speech reception threshold was lowered by 35.1 dB. Conclusion Even after several years, patients report significant benefits in hearing-related quality of life and device satisfaction. In combination with a low rate of minor adverse events and significantly improved audiological outcomes, the device is considered as a comfortable and effective option in hearing rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W3097820161,"Objective Excessive alcohol consumption in adolescents is one of the most significant public health problems currently facing society. Social and geographical contexts contribute to the development of alcohol-related behavior in adolescents. The aim of this research is to analyze the social pattern related to alcohol consumption in adolescents based on their geographical environment. Methodology We designed a descriptive cross-sectional study based on social network analysis. We recruited 196 high school students between 16 and 18 years of age to participate in the study. The methodology applied was social network analysis by means of transitivity and homophily social triads. The data were analyzed using STATA statistical software. Results and conclusions A total of 58.48% of rural adolescents consumed alcohol compared to 49.52% of urban adolescents. These results demonstrate that adolescents who live in rural areas exhibit a greater risk of drinking alcohol than those who live in urban areas. The presence of transitive triads increases the probability of sharing sociodemographic attributes in such a way that it may be considered one of the causes of homophily, contributing to adolescents taking greater risks, such as consuming alcohol."
https://openalex.org/W3095918119,"The choice of colony size may have profound consequences for individual fitness in colonially breeding birds, but at the same time it may require certain behavioural adaptations. Here, we aimed to examine behavioural divergence of common terns Sterna hirundo nesting in colonies of different size. For this purpose, we promoted establishment of small (<35 pairs) and large (>100 pairs) tern colonies under uniform ecological and environmental conditions by providing attractive patches of nesting substrate (floating rafts) at a single site. We combined video recording and GPS-tracking to assess communal and individual defence initiation rate, intra-specific aggression rate, and foraging flight characteristics. We found that birds from larger colonies more frequently engaged in communal defence and they performed longer foraging flights, while terns from smaller colonies more frequently showed individual defence behaviours. Also, intra-specific aggression rate was higher in smaller colonies, but this effect was primarily attributed to a higher proportion of edge breeding pairs, which were more aggressive. Our results suggest that various colony sizes may be associated with different behavioural syndromes, which comprise of diverse personality traits, such as social responsiveness, social tolerance, or propensity for aggression. It remains to be tested whether these behavioural differences reflect processes of phenotypic sorting among colonies of different size or whether they are a result of behavioural plasticity under different social contexts."
https://openalex.org/W3096445293,"Myogenesis includes sequential stages of progenitor cell proliferation, myogenic commitment and differentiation, myocyte fusion, and myotube maturation. Different stages of myogenesis are orchestrated and regulated by myogenic regulatory factors and various downstream cellular signaling. Here we identify phosphatase orphan 1 (Phospho1) as a new player in myogenesis. During activation, proliferation, and differentiation of quiescent satellite cells, the expression of Phospho1 gradually increases. Overexpression of Phospho1 inhibits myoblast proliferation but promotes their differentiation and fusion. Conversely, knockdown of Phospho1 accelerates myoblast proliferation but impairs myotube formation. Moreover, knockdown of Phospho1 decreases the OXPHO protein levels and mitochondria density, whereas overexpression of Phospho1 upregulates OXPHO protein levels and promotes mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Finally, we show that Phospho1 expression is controlled by myogenin, which binds to the promoter of Phospho1 to regulate its transcription. These results indicate a key role of Phospho1 in regulating myogenic differentiation and mitochondrial function."
https://openalex.org/W3095157779,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of short duration electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings extracted from ambulatory continuous ECG (Holter) to assess 24-hour mean heart rate in dogs with atrial fibrillation. In this retrospective study, Holter recordings obtained from 20 dogs with atrial fibrillation were selected for analysis. Ten out of 20 dogs were receiving drugs to control heart rate at the time of Holter evaluation. From the Holter recordings, heart rate averages were calculated for various sample durations (five-minutes, 30 minutes, one-hour, two-hours, and three-hours) for each dog. Percentage of these shorter duration ECG obtained HR averages that fell within ±10%, ±15% and ± 20% of 24-hour mean heart rate was determined for each sample duration and for each dog. Seventy five percent of heart rate averages obtained from three-hour ECG recordings fell within ±10% of 24-hour mean HR. All the heart rate averages obtained from two-hour ECG recordings fell within ±20% of 24-hour mean heart rate. Based on the results of this study it can be concluded that the duration of the ECG recording affects the prediction accuracy for 24-hour Holter mean HR. Only two and three hours of Holter recordings provided all heart rate averages within ±20% of 24-hour mean heart rate. No significant differences were noted in the prediction accuracy of shorter duration ECG recordings based on rate control therapy status. Further prospective studies are needed to assess the accuracy of HR obtained at home using various ECG recording devices to predict 24-hour mean heart rate in dogs with atrial fibrillation."

Alginetin is producted by cooking process of food including pection, a naturally-occurring polysacharride found in many plants. However, the biological interaction and toxicity of alginetin are not known at all. The aim of the present study was to investigate the cellular actions of alginetin on rat thymic lymphocytes. The effects of alginetin on the cell were examined using flow cytometry with fluorescent probes. Alginetin increased cellular content of non-protein thiols ([NPT]i) and elevated intracellular Zn2+ levels ([Zn2+]i). Chelation of intracellular Zn2+ reduced the effect of alginetin on [NPT]i, and chelation of external Zn2+ almost completely diminished alginetin-induced elevation of [Zn2+]i, indicating that alginetin treatment increased Zn2+ influx. Increased [NPT]i and [Zn2+]i levels in response to alginetin were positively correlated. Alginetin protected cells against oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide and Ca2+ overload by calcium ionophore. It is considered that the increases in [NPT]i and [Zn2+]i are responsible for the cytoprotective activity of alginetin because NPT attenuates oxidative stress and Zn2+ competes with Ca2+. Alginetin may be produced during manufacturing of jam, which may provide additional health benefits of jam."

(2020) interpreted the asymmetrical gene flow they found from the eastern subpopulation towards the western one as an exodus of bears forced to flee from the eastern nucleus “with higher human disturbance and poaching”, concluding that connectivity may be operating as a means for eastern Cantabrian bears to find more suitable territories. In this reply, we maintain that the explanations of Gregorio et al. contradict the source-sink theory and we also present demographic data not considered by these authors showing that the eastern subpopulation is not declining, but persistently increasing. After reviewing the demographic and genetic studies published during the last 20 years, we conclude that the connectivity between the two subpopulations is operating as a route which allows the regular movement of males and the restoration of the gene flow across the whole Cantabrian population."
https://openalex.org/W3097233147,"Influenza virus infection is a global public health threat. Current seasonal influenza vaccines are efficacious only when vaccine strains are matched with circulating strains. There is a critical need for developing “universal” vaccines that protect against all influenza viruses. HA stem is a promising target for developing broad-spectrum influenza vaccines due to its relatively conserved feature. However, HA stem is weakly immunogenic when administered alone in a soluble form. Several approaches have been employed to improve the immunogenicity of HA stem, including conjugation of HA stem with a highly immunogenic carrier protein or displaying HA stem on a nanoparticle scaffold. Converting a weakly immunologic protein into a multimer through aggregation can significantly enhance its immunogenicity, with some multimeric protein aggregates previously shown to be more immunogenic than their soluble counterparts in animal models. Here, we show that a chemically coupling a peptide derived from the head domain of PR8 HA (P35) with the poorly immunogenic HA stem protein results in aggregation of the HA stem which significantly increases stem-specific B cell responses following vaccination. Importantly, vaccination with this conjugate in the absence of adjuvant still induced robust B cell responses against stem in vivo. Improving HA stem immunogenicity by aggregation provides an alternative avenue to conjugation with exotic carrier proteins or nanoparticle formulation."
https://openalex.org/W3095458766,"In 2014, the Danish Government implemented an active labour market reform directed at unemployed young adults under 30 years of age with low educational qualifications. The reform replaced the (unemployment) cash benefits with a lower education benefit for many of the unemployed aged under 30 and obliged the low-skilled in this group to enrol in a regular general or vocational (VET) education program. This paper exploits the sharp discontinuity that occurs at age 30 to estimate the joint effect of higher benefits and the cessation of educational obligations on the share receiving cash benefits and the share enrolled in education. We estimate the effects by applying a regression discontinuity design. We report results for the group of low educated young adults and for subgroups facing different economic incentives. The results establish that reaching age 30 creates an incentive to apply for cash benefits, and we find strong evidence that a significant increase in the share of cash benefit recipients relates to a corresponding reduction in the share of young adults enrolled in education. When including subgroups the size of the effect increases, and the results demonstrate that the effects are strongest among previous education benefit recipients. This indicates that the results are mainly driven mainly by individuals reverting to cash benefits."
https://openalex.org/W3096023617,"Social and economic factors are commonly examined as contextual variables that predict academic achievement, apart from the educational environment. In India, a major segment of the socioeconomic status of students comprises the governmental stratification of population into three broad classes, viz., scheduled castes/tribes (SC-ST), other backward classes (OBC) and general class (GC). In this study, we examined the association of these governmental classes with the academic performance of Indian adolescents who enjoy the same school environment. Psychological measures of self-esteem and life satisfaction as well as demographic variables such as gender, age and family income were also examined as covariates. The study was conducted on a convenient sample of 858 students of X and XI grades. Based on multilevel regression models, the relationship between governmental classes and academic performance was significantly positive, wherein higher level of class predicted better academic performance. The study highlighted that students from the same school environment performed differently based on their social status and that this difference was not a function of their family income, thus pointing to potential role of non-economic aspects of the governmental stratification including caste affiliation. The findings indicate the need for further examining as well as planning to improve the aspects of students’ social status that impact academic performance."
