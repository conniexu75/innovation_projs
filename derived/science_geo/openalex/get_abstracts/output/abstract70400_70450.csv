https://openalex.org/W1982321167,"Weak alternating magnetic fields outside the human scalp, produced by alpha-rhythm currents, are demonstrated. Subject ard magnetic detector were housed in a multilayer magnetically shielded chamber. Background magnetic noise was reduced by signal-averaging. The fields near the scalp are about 1 x 10(-9) gauss (peak to peak). A course distribution shows left-right symmetry for the particular averaging technique used here."

https://openalex.org/W2013649386,"Frozen and thawed granules of human, peripheral-blood leukocytes rapidly produce hemorrhage when injected into animal tissues. The effect is blocked by inhibitors of proteolysis. The granule extract can digest vascular basement membrane in vitro at neutral pH. In addition, basement membranes of blood vessels damaged in vivo by the leukocyte fraction are found to be attenuated when examined by electron microscopy. The proteases of human leukocyte granules differ in several important respects from known lysosomal cathepsins and trypsin-like esterases. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils are a major source of the neutral proteases present in circulating white cells, and release these enzymes during phagocytosis of immune complexes."

https://openalex.org/W2040178357,"Albino rats can reliably distinguish between the odors of stressed and unstressed rats. Five animals learned to interrupt an ongoing response when air from the cages of stressed rats was introduced into the test compartment, and to continue responding when air from unstressed rats was introduced. The discrimination does not seem to depend on recognition of odors of individual rats."
https://openalex.org/W2064609931,"The hydrocarbon composition of two algae, a golden-brown (Bot-ryococcus braunii) and a blue-green (Anacystis montana), has been investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Both show distributions of aliphatic hydrocarbons of odd carbon numbers in the medium and high ranges of molecular weight, with maxima at n-C(17) and n-C(29) for B. braunii and n-C(17) and n-C(29) for A. montana. With the exception of the n-heptadecane of A. montana all the hydrocarbons are monoenes, dienes, or trienes. Since certain continental sediments and oils show similar distributions of alkanes with respect to carbon number, these organisms may be the precursors of the hydrocarbons in these formations."

https://openalex.org/W2029438114,"The fully deuterated proteins C-phycocyanin, C-phycoerythrin, and cytochrome c have been obtained by biosynthesis with the leucine side chains, and only the leucine side chains, of normal ((1)H) isotopic composition. In these (isotopic hybrid) proteins, proton magnetic resonance analysis shows that the (1)H-leucine side chains are in a variety of environments. During protein biosynthesis, the alpha hydrogen of leucine is exchanged with a hydrogen ((2)H) from the aqueous medium."
https://openalex.org/W2042496542,"SODIUM and potassium concentrations in human red cells are controlled by the sodium pump, and if passive leaks exceed rates of active transport cells undergo colloid osmotic haemolysis. Because the sodium pump has a maximum rate1,2, passive permeability is also involved in regulating ionic composition. Is passive permeability, like active transport, related to the metabolic state of the cell ?"
https://openalex.org/W2046111546,"Aniline and 11 different chloroanilines were added to soil. No azo compound was formed from aniline, but all monochloro-and some dichloroanilines were transformed to their corresponding dichloro-and tetrachloroazobenzenes. Other dichloroanilines and the trichloroanilines were stable in soil. Peroxidase catalyzed the formation of azo compounds by some chloroanilines. Correspondence in the range of substrates used and products formed in the two systems suggests a peroxidatic mechanism for the synthesis of azo compounds residues in soil."

https://openalex.org/W1990517145,"The selective patterns of generalization to various chemicals, obtained in rats after radiation-induced gustatory-avoidance conditioning against single chemicals, were used to evaluate qualitative similarities among taste stimuli. DL-Alanine, glycine, and sodium saccharin were classed together, but not with D-glucose or potassium chloride. Groupings such as these may serve as a basis for determining the dimensions along which taste quality is represented."
https://openalex.org/W2073221972,"Ridges forming the concentric sculpture on the shells of laboratory-grown specimens of Pecten diegensis Dall show daily periodicity. Missing growth lines account for all scatter in the data, so that the maximum, not the average, line count is most representative. The variation in spacing between growth lines can be correlated among specimens."
https://openalex.org/W2058560423,"Polyribosomes were absent in metaphase Chinese hamster cells and were reassembled after mitosis. This assembly correlated temporally with formation of nuclear membrane and decondensation of chromatin, accounted for a threefold increased rate of protein synthesis, and occurred independently of de novo RNA synthesis, that is, it utilized preexisting messenger RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2034556404,"Noxious stimulation of the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris elicits secretion of a mucus that is aversive to other members of the species, as well as to the stimulated animal when it is encountered later. This alarm pheromone is not readily soluble in water and retains its aversive properties for at least several months if not disturbed. Its influence may be responsible for some features of the data on instrumental learning in earthworms."
https://openalex.org/W1995415637,"Reversible cryogenic blockade of neural systems in the brain may be accomplished by local cooling. A small cryoprobe is described which may be implanted in the brain of an unrestrained, behaving animal. Cooling may be restricted to the tip of the cryoprobe and the temperature of the tip and the shaft may be regulated and monitored independently by miniature thermocouples and appropriate control and indicator devices. Electrophysiological results are presented which show that the cryogenic blocking effect may be localized to within a few millimeters of the tip of the cryoprobe and that the size of the region blocked is proportional to the tip temperature. The system described has been shown to be effective in both electrophysiological and behavioral studies."
https://openalex.org/W2048344579,Peptides derived from the al chain of collagen have been isolated in small amounts and have been shown to differ from ones found in expected amounts only by substitution of hydroxylysine for lysine. This observation indicates that hydroxylation of these lysines by protocollagen hydroxylase has been effected to a very minor extent.

https://openalex.org/W2014335296,"It has been demonstrated by autoradiography that radioactive amino acids serve as precursors for proteins which are subsequently incorporated into retinal rod outer segment discs in mature animals. By the isolation and purification of visual pigment from retinas of adult frogs after injection of tritiated leucine and phenylalanine, it has been shown that at least part of this labeled protein consists of visual pigment (rhodopsin)."
https://openalex.org/W2088606154,"Suppression of symptoms of aster yellows by antibiotics supports the tentative hypothesis that the etiologic agent is a mycoplasma-or bedsonia-like organism rather than a virus. Development of symptoms was supressed by chlortetracycline, tetracycline, or chloramphenicol, but not by penicillin. When plants were treated with chlortetracycline at 1000 parts per million before symptoms appeared, symptoms developed only after cessation of the treatment. Assay of the agent of aster yellows, extracted from plants, indicated inhibition of growth of the pathogen by treatment with chlortetracycline. Plants severely affected before treatment began developed new symptomless axillary growth, including flowers; previously yellowed leaves often became green. Acquisition of the agent of aster yellows by leafhoppers was drastically reduced when infected plants were treated with chlortetracycline continuously for 1 week before exposure to the vectors. Our data, and preliminary evidence from purification studies, are consistent with a possible mycoplasma-or bedsonia-like etiology of the aster yellows disease."

https://openalex.org/W2021667970,"Firing patterns of single neurons in the hypothalamus, preoptic area, midbrain reticular system, and hippocampus of awake, freely moving female rats were temporally correlated with exploratory sniffing and vibrissa twitching, feeding, lordosis, locomotion, and (or) arousal. These relationships were remarkably stable during continuous observations lasting many hours. During extended periods when certain of these movements were not performed, the correlated neurons showed no action potentials for minutes at a time. Electrical stimulation at certain recording sites elicited behavior patterns whose spontaneous occurrence was accompanied by neuronal activation. Self-stimulation was elicited from sites spontaneously activated during exploratory behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1982344849,"Injection of lysergic acid diethylamide in Drosophila melanogaster males induced no mutations or chromosome breaks in premeiotic, meiotic, or postmeiotic sperm. Tests included those for sex-linked lethals, sex-linked visibles, a specific visible (dumpy), and translocations. Some implications of these experiments are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2085581309,"The 27, 000g supernatant from crude extracts of the dinoflagellate Gonyaulax can be fractionated into two components having luciferase activity that differ both in molecular weight (35, 000 and 150, 000) and in pH activity profile. The smaller component has activity over a broad range from pH 5 to 9, while the larger one is active only in the acid region. This clarifies the previous ambiguity in the literature regarding the optimum pH for the assay of luciferase."
https://openalex.org/W1973124749,"Vernolepin (5 to 50 micrograms per milliliter), a novel sesquiterpenoid dilactone obtained from Vernonia hymenolepis, inhibits extension growth (from 20 to 80 percent) of wheat coleoptile sections. Inhibited tissues appear normal and their respiration is unaffected. If the inhibited sections are washed and subsequently treated with indole-3-acetic acid, the tissues respond to the auxin, but the degree of elongation is determined by the length of prior treatment with vernolepin. Administered simultaneously, increasing concentrations of auxin will significantly reduce the inhibitory effect of vernolepin, but there is no evidence for a competitive interaction between the two substances."
https://openalex.org/W2038848466,"Adult C57BL/6J male mice received either a primary ectopic transplant or a primary and a challenge ectopic transplant of trophoblast tissue obtained from the ectoplacental cones of 7½-day-old C3H/HeJ × C3H/HeJ embryos. Gross and histologic examinations of these grafts at 5, 7, and 12 days of growth indicated that the challenge grafts were inhibited in growth; there were a smaller percentage of grossly successful grafts, smaller hemorrhagic reactions, fewer viable cells at all stages of growth, and better host containment of the colony. The evidence indicates that exposure to pure trophoblast alters an animal's subsequent reaction to grafts syngeneic with the original trophoblast and can best be explained as evidence of immunologic sensitization of the host."

In a newborn affected with beta thalassemia trait, the presence of one beta thalassemia gene was revealed on the 1st day of life by the lower specific radioactivity of the beta chain."

https://openalex.org/W2006762042,One transverse and one mandibular muscle form the frontal scars on each valve in both the trachyleberines and hemicytherines. Bifurcation of the transverse muscle into anterior-posterior bundles (trachyleberine) and into dorsal-ventral bundles (hemicytherine) and mandibular muscle position account for the different frontal scar patterns observed.
https://openalex.org/W2021708493,"After the intravenous injection of radioalbumin macroaggregate, large numbers of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies were observed in the lung tissue of rats. The inclusions were located mainly in the cytoplasm of type I alveolar lining cells, appeared 40 minutes after the injection, and lasted up to 2 days. These observations suggest that the type I alveolar lining cells participate in the clearing mechanism of the lung tissue, a function that thus far has not been attributed to this type of cell."
https://openalex.org/W2053232607,"Starvation of larvae of the milliped Narceus annularis results in the formation of a smaller than normal number of body segments in the early stadia. However, this reduced number is compensated for by subsequent formation of a larger than normal number of body segments in the later stadia, or by the addition of extra segment-building stadia. Apparently there is a mechanism whereby the milliped ""keeps count"" of the number of body segments produced and can regulate the production of these segments from a proliferative region so that the total number of body segments at sexual maturity is within the normal range for the species."
