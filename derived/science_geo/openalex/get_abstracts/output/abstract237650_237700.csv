https://openalex.org/W2074953341,"An exciton is the particle-like entity that forms when an electron is bound to a positively charged ‘hole’. An ordered electronic state in which excitons condense into a single quantum state was proposed as a theoretical possibility many years ago. We review recent studies of semiconductor bilayer systems that provide clear evidence for this phenomenon and explain why exciton condensation in the quantum Hall regime, where these experiments were performed, is as likely to occur in electron–electron bilayers as in electron–hole bilayers. In current quantum Hall excitonic condensates, disorder induces mobile vortices that flow in response to a supercurrent and limit the extremely large bilayer counterflow conductivity."

https://openalex.org/W2103976743,"How the brain represents different aspects of faces remains controversial. Here we presented subjects with stimuli drawn from morph continua between pairs of famous faces. In the paired presentations, a second face could be identical to the first, could share perceived identity but differ physically (30% along the morph continuum), or could differ physically by the same distance along the continuum (30%) but in the other direction. We show that, behaviorally, subjects are more likely to classify face pairs in the third paired presentation as different and that this effect is more pronounced for subjects who are more familiar with the faces. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) shows sensitivity to physical rather than to identity changes, whereas right fusiform gyrus (FFG) shows sensitivity to identity rather than to physical changes. Bilateral anterior temporal regions show sensitivity to identity change that varies with the subjects' pre-experimental familiarity with the faces. These findings provide neurobiological support for a hierarchical model of face perception."

As the brush is withdrawn, pairs of bundles aggregate successively, forming complex hierarchical patterns that depend on a balance between capillary forces and the elasticity of the lamellae. This capillary-driven self-assembly of flexible structures, which occurs in the tarsi of insects1 and in biomimetic adhesives2 but which can also damage micro-electromechanical structures3,4,5,6 or carbon nanotube ‘carpets’6,7,8, represents a new type of coalescence process."

https://openalex.org/W2009580263,"We report the complete genome sequence of Zymomonas mobilis ZM4 (ATCC31821), an ethanologenic microorganism of interest for the production of fuel ethanol. The genome consists of 2,056,416 base pairs forming a circular chromosome with 1,998 open reading frames (ORFs) and three ribosomal RNA transcription units. The genome lacks recognizable genes for 6-phosphofructokinase, an essential enzyme in the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway, and for two enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex and malate dehydrogenase, so glucose can be metabolized only by the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. Whole genome microarrays were used for genomic comparisons with the Z. mobilis type strain ZM1 (ATCC10988) revealing that 54 ORFs predicted to encode for transport and secretory proteins, transcriptional regulators and oxidoreductase in the ZM4 strain were absent from ZM1. Most of these ORFs were also found to be actively transcribed in association with ethanol production by ZM4."

https://openalex.org/W2047906603,"Strategies for assembling large, complex genomes have evolved to include a combination of whole-genome shotgun sequencing and hierarchal map-assisted sequencing1,2. Whole-genome maps of all types can aid genome assemblies, generally starting with low-resolution cytogenetic maps and ending with the highest resolution of sequence. Fingerprint clone maps are based upon complete restriction enzyme digests of clones representative of the target genome, and ultimately comprise a near-contiguous path of clones across the genome. Such clone-based maps are used to validate sequence assembly order, supply long-range linking information for assembled sequences, anchor sequences to the genetic map and provide templates for closing gaps. Fingerprint maps are also a critical resource for subsequent functional genomic studies, because they provide a redundant and ordered sampling of the genome with clones3. In an accompanying paper4 we describe the draft genome sequence of the chicken, Gallus gallus, the first species sequenced that is both a model organism and a global food source. Here we present a clone-based physical map of the chicken genome at 20-fold coverage, containing 260 contigs of overlapping clones. This map represents approximately 91% of the chicken genome and enables identification of chicken clones aligned to positions in other sequenced genomes."

https://openalex.org/W2094812080,"The motion of a chromosome during mitosis is mediated by a bundle of microtubules, termed a kinetochore fibre (K-fibre), which connects the kinetochore of the chromosome to a spindle pole. Once formed, mature K-fibres maintain a steady state length because the continuous addition of microtubule subunits onto microtubule plus ends at the kinetochore is balanced by their removal at their minus ends within the pole. This condition is known as 'microtubule poleward flux'1. Chromosome motion and changes in position are then driven by changes in K-fibre length, which in turn are controlled by changes in the rates at which microtubule subunits are added at the kinetochore and/or removed from the pole2. A key to understanding the role of flux in mitosis is to identify the molecular factors that drive it. Here we use Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells expressing α-tubulin tagged with green fluorescent protein, RNA interference, laser microsurgery and photobleaching to show that the kinetochore protein MAST/Orbit — the single CLASP orthologue in Drosophila — is an essential component for microtubule subunit incorporation into fluxing K-fibres."

https://openalex.org/W2110090322,"Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) resulting from the hereditary loss of the von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene is the leading cause of death in VHL patients due to the deleterious effects of the metastatic tumor(s). VHL functions in the destruction of the alpha subunits of the heterodimeric transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α and HIF-2α), in normoxic conditions. When VHL function is lost, HIF-α protein is stabilized, and target hypoxia-inducible genes are transcribed. The process of tumor invasion and metastasis involves the destruction of the extracellular matrix, which is accomplished primarily by the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family of enzymes. Here, we describe a connection between the loss of VHL tumor suppressor function and the upregulation of membrane type-1 MMP (MT1-MMP) gene expression and protein. Specifically, MT1-MMP is upregulated in VHL−/− RCC cells through an increase in gene transcription, which is mediated by the cooperative effects of the transcription factors, HIF-2 and Sp1. Further, we identify a functional HIF-binding site in the proximal promoter of MT1-MMP. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show direct regulation of MT1-MMP by HIF-2 and to provide a direct link between the loss of VHL tumor suppressor function and an increase in MMP gene and protein expression."
https://openalex.org/W2093986699,"The development of more effective prevention and treatment strategies for solid tumors is limited by an incomplete understanding of the critical growth pathways that are activated in carcinogenesis. Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins have been linked to transformation and tumor progression. Several approaches have been used to block STAT3 in cancer cells resulting in reduced proliferation and apoptosis. We tested the hypothesis that blocking STAT3 activation using a transcription factor decoy approach would decrease tumor growth and STAT3 target gene expression in vivo. In a xenograft model of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), daily administration of the STAT3 decoy (25 μg) resulted in decreased tumor volumes, abrogation of STAT3 activation, and decreased expression of STAT3 target genes (VEGF, Bcl-xL, and cyclin D1) compared to treatment with a mutant control decoy. Blockade of STAT3 with the STAT3 decoy also induced apoptosis and decreased proliferation, an effect that was augmented when the STAT3 decoy was combined with cisplatin, both in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that a transcription factor decoy approach may be used to target STAT3 in cancers that demonstrate increased STAT3 activation including SCCHN."

https://openalex.org/W1999585673,"Disruption of transcriptional control of cellular genes by human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) is thought to be associated, at least in part, with the development of adult T-cell leukemia. It has been reported that activating protein-1 (AP-1) is dysregulated by HTLV-1 infection. HTLV-1-encoded Tax elevates AP-1 activity through the induction of AP-1 family member gene expression, including c-Jun, JunD, c-Fos, and Fra-1. However, the precise mechanism by which HTLV-1 regulates AP-1 activity remains to be addressed. Recently, a novel viral protein named HTLV-1 basic leucine-zipper factor, HBZ, has been shown to interact with c-Jun and repress c-Jun-mediated transcription by abrogating its DNA-binding activity. In the course of investigating HBZ function, we found that HBZ reduced the steady-state levels of c-Jun, and the levels were restored by treatment with a proteasome inhibitor. Together, this indicates that HBZ promotes c-Jun degradation through a proteasome-dependent pathway. Furthermore, HBZ deletion mutants revealed that both the N-terminal and leucine-zipper region of HBZ were required for the elimination of c-Jun. These results suggest dual effects of HBZ on the suppression of AP-1 activity by inhibiting c-Jun function, which may contribute to the dysregulation of cell proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2001186755,"Oscillatory spike timing in the hippocampus is regarded as a temporal coding mechanism for space, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. To contrast the predictions of the different models of phase precession, we transiently turned off neuronal discharges for up to 250 ms and reset the phase of theta oscillations by stimulating the commissural pathway in rats. After recovery from silence, phase precession continued. The phase of spikes for the first theta cycle after the perturbation was more advanced than the phase of spikes for the last theta cycle just before the perturbation. These findings indicate that phase advancement that emerges within hippocampal circuitry may be updated at the beginning of each theta cycle by extrahippocampal inputs."

https://openalex.org/W2011044969,"Tenascins represent a family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins with distinctive expression patterns. Here we have analyzed the most recently described member, tenascin-W, in breast cancer. Mammary tumors isolated from transgenic mice expressing hormone-induced oncogenes reveal tenascin-W in the stroma around lesions with a high likelihood of metastasis. The presence of tenascin-W was correlated with the expression of its putative receptor, alpha8 integrin. HC11 cells derived from normal mammary epithelium do not express alpha8 integrin and fail to cross tenascin-W-coated filters. However, 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells do express alpha8 integrin and their migration is stimulated by tenascin-W. The expression of tenascin-W is induced by BMP-2 but not by TGF-beta1, though the latter is a potent inducer of tenascin-C. The expression of tenascin-W is dependent on p38MAPK and JNK signaling pathways. Since preinflammatory cytokines also act through p38MAPK and JNK signaling pathways, the possible role of TNF-alpha in tenascin-W expression was also examined. TNF-alpha induced the expression of both tenascin-W and tenascin-C, and this induction was p38MAPK- and cyclooxygenase-dependent. Our results show that tenascin-W may be a useful diagnostic marker for breast malignancies, and that the induction of tenascin-W in the tumor stroma may contribute to the invasive behavior of tumor cells."

https://openalex.org/W2132113444,"Protein kinase (PK)C theta is a critical regulator of mature T-cell activation and proliferation, being implicated in TCR-triggered nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B activation and providing important survival signals to leukemic T cells. We previously showed that overexpression of pT alpha/pre-TCR and constitutive activation of NF-kappa B characterize the T-cell leukemia/lymphoma developing in Notch3-IC transgenic mice. We report here that PKC theta is a downstream target of Notch3 signaling and that its activation and membrane translocation require a functional pre-TCR in order to trigger NF-kappa B activation in thymocytes and lymphoma cells of transgenic mice. Furthermore, deletion of PKC theta in Notch3-IC transgenic mice reduces the incidence of leukemia, correlating with decreased NF-kappa B activation. This paper therefore suggests that PKC theta mediates the activation of NF-kappa B by pre-TCR in immature thymocytes and contributes to the development of Notch3-dependent T-cell lymphoma."
https://openalex.org/W2119279070,"In this study, gene expression profiling was performed on 103 neuroblastoma (NB) tumors, stages 1-4 with and without MYCN amplification, using cDNA microarrays containing 42,578 elements. Using principal component analysis (PCA) to analyse the relationships among these samples, we confirm that the global patterns of gene expression reflect the phenotype of the tumors. To explore the biological processes that may contribute to increasing aggressive phenotype of the tumors, we utilized a statistical approach based on PCA. We identified a specific subset of the cell cycle and/or chromosome segregation genes that distinguish stage 4 NB tumors from all lower stage tumors, including stage 3. Furthermore, the control of the kinetochore assembly emerges from the Gene Ontology analysis as one of the key biological processes associated with an aggressive NB phenotype. Finally, we establish that these genes are further upregulated in the most aggressive MYCN-amplified tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2092716013,"Abnormal folding of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) is a key feature in prion diseases. Here we show that two pathogenic mutations linked to inherited prion diseases in humans severely affect folding and maturation of PrPC in the secretory pathway of neuronal cells. PrP-T183A and PrP-F198S adopt a misfolded and partially protease-resistant conformation, lack the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, and are not complex glycosylated. These misfolded PrP mutants are not retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and are not subjected to the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway. They rather are secreted, moreover, these mutants can be internalized by heterologous cells. Structural studies indicated that the side chains of Thr183 and Phe198 contribute to interactions between secondary structure elements in the C-terminal globular domain of PrPC. Consequently, we reasoned that a destabilized tertiary structure of these mutants could account for the defect in maturation. Indeed, mutations predicted to interfere selectively with the packing of the hydrophobic core of PrPC prevented the addition of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor.

Spontaneous misfolding of PrPC seems to be extremely rare based on the low incidence of sporadic prion diseases in humans (about 1 case in 1 million per year). However, inherited forms of the disease, some of which show a penetrance of nearly 100%, indicate that mutations within the prion protein gene can favor the formation of a pathogenic conformer (5Spudich S. Mastrianni J.A. Wrensch M. Gabizon R. Meiner Z. Kahana I. Rosenmann H. Kahana E. Prusiner S.B. Mol. Med. 1995; 1: 607-613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biogenesis of PrPC is characterized by a series of post-translational modifications (reviewed in Ref. 6Tatzelt J. Winklhofer K.F. Amyloid. 2004; 11: 162-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). During import into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) the N-terminal signal peptide is cleaved and core glycans are attached to Asn180 and Asn196 of murine PrP (corresponds to Asn181 and Asn197 of human and Syrian hamster PrP) (7Haraguchi T. Fisher S. Olofsson S. Endo T. Groth D. Tarentino A. Borchelt D.R. Teplow D. Hood L. Burlingame A. Lycke E. Kobata A. Prusiner S.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Shortly after PrPC is fully translocated into the ER lumen, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor is transferred to Ser230 (8Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Hsiao K. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). It is known that a single amino acid substitution in the GPI anchor signal sequence can significantly interfere with GPI anchor attachment (9Lowe M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), however, much less is known about the role of the protein conformation in this process. After the addition of the GPI anchor, both core glycans of PrPC are further processed in the Golgi compartment to generate a heterogeneous population of at least 52 different bi-, tri- and tetra-antennary glycans (10Stimson E. Hope J. Chong A. Burlingame A.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4885-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 11Rudd P.M. Endo T. Colominas C. Groth D. Wheeler S.F. Harvey D.J. Wormald M.R.

Structural studies with recombinantly expressed PrP revealed a large flexibly disordered N-terminal region and a structured C-terminal domain (amino acids 126–226). This autonomously folding domain contains three α-helical regions and a short two-stranded β-sheet (12Donne D.G. Viles J.H. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Wright P.E.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). In a refined NMR analysis the precise structural definition of a large fraction of side chains was achieved and it became apparent that the globular domain of PrPC contains a tightly packed hydrophobic core (15Riek R. Wider G. Billeter M. Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11667-11672Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). An inherited prion disease in humans is linked to the amino acid substitution T183A, which destroys the first N-linked glycosylation acceptor site (16Nitrini R. Rosemberg S. Passos-Bueno M.R. da Silva L.S. Iughetti P. Papadopoulos M. Carrilho P.M. Caramelli P. Albrecht S. Zatz M. LeBlanc A. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 42: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that a defective glycosylation could favor the formation of pathogenic prion protein. However, structural studies revealed that the pathogenic mutation T183A (corresponds to T182A in mouse PrPC) destabilizes the hydrophobic core of the C-terminal globular domain, because it interferes with the formation of a hydrogen bond between helix 2 and the β-sheet (15Riek R. Wider G. Billeter M. Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11667-11672Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In the same study it was proposed that a different pathogenic mutation, F198S (17Dlouhy S.R. Hsiao K. Farlow M.R. Foroud T. Conneally P.M. Johnson P. Prusiner S.B. Hodes M.E. Ghetti B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), could also destabilize the tertiary structure of the globular domain. In this study we analyzed the biogenesis and maturation of PrP-T183A and PrP-F198S in the secretory pathway of neuronal cells and show that these pathogenic mutants spontaneously adopt a partially protease-resistant phenotype, lack the GPI anchor, and are secreted. A mechanistic analysis suggested that the defect in maturation is caused by the destabilization of the hydrophobic core, suggesting that the formation of the tertiary structure influences the efficiency of the GPI anchor attachment. Generation of Wild-type (WT) PrP and PrP Mutants—The coding region of the mouse PRNP modified to express PrP-L108M/V111M was inserted into the pcDNA3.1/Zeo vector (Invitrogen), allowing discrimination by monoclonal antibody 3F4 (18Gilch S.

Amino acid deletions and substitutions were introduced by PCR cloning techniques. The following amino acid substitutions were created: PrP-N180Q, PrP-T182A, PrP-F197S, PrP-V160S, and PrP-V160W. The C-terminal deletion in PrP-V160WΔGPI includes amino acids 230–254. For generation of cytosolic PrP (cytoPrP) the ER signal sequence (amino acids 2–22) was deleted. PrP-M204S was described earlier (19Winklhofer K.F. Heske J. Heller U. Reintjes A. Muranji W. Moarefi I. Tatzelt J. J. Biol.

Cells were transfected by a liposome-mediated method using Lipofectamine Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). For Endo H digestion, protein lysates were adjusted to 0.5% SDS, boiled for 10 min, and then digested with endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37 °C, as specified by the manufacturer. For PNGase F digestion, aliquots of cell lysates (50 μg of protein) were digested with 1 unit of PNGase F (Roche) for 24 h at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Proteasomal and Lysosomal Degradation Experiments—For inhibition of proteasomal degradation cells were incubated with MG 132 (Calbiochem, dissolved in Me2SO) at the concentration and the time indicated. To inhibit lysosomal degradation, cells were incubated with bafilomycin A1 (Calbiochem, 1 μm, dissolved in Me2SO) for 16 h as described earlier (22Kiachopoulos S. Heske J. Tatzelt J. Winklhofer K.F. Traffic. 2004; 5: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Assay for Uptake of Heterologous PrP—Cell culture medium collected from transiently transfected N2a cells was filtered to remove possibly detached cells and then added to untransfected cells. After 48 h at 37 °C, these cells were lysed and heterologous PrP was detected by Western blotting using the monoclonal antibody 3F4. In parallel, cells were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence. Detergent Solubility Assay, Secretion Analysis, and Proteolysis Experiments—As described previously (23Tatzelt J. Prusiner S.B. Welch W.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6363-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), cells were washed twice with cold PBS, scraped off the plate, pelleted by centrifugation, and lysed in cold buffer A (0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate in PBS). The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. After boiling in Laemmli sample buffer, supernatants and pellets were analyzed by immunoblotting. To examine the secretion of PrP into the cell culture supernatant, cells were cultivated in serum-free medium for 3 h at 37 °C. The medium was collected, PrP was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by Western blotting. For proteolysis experiments, cells were lysed in cold buffer A and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with proteinase K (PK) (Roche) at the concentrations indicated. The reaction was terminated by addition of Pefabloc SC (Roche) and boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Residual PrP was detected by Western blotting. Phospholipase C and Trypsin Treatment—Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then maintained on ice. Phosphatidylinositolphospholipase C (PI-PLC) (Roche) in PBS was added to the cells for 3 h at 4 °C (0.5 units/ml). Medium was collected, the cells were washed extensively with PBS and lysed in cold buffer A. Cellular PrP was analyzed by the detergent solubility assay. PrP present in the cell culture medium was precipitated by trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by Western blotting. For trypsin treatment, intact cells were washed twice with cold PBS and incubated at 4 °C in trypsin (0.25%, w/v) for 5 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Invitrogen). The cells were collected by a brief centrifugation, washed with trypsin inhibitor, and analyzed with the detergent solubility assay. Western Blot Analysis—Detergent-fractionated cell lysates were size fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Protran BA 85, Schleicher & Schüll) by electroblotting as described earlier (24Tatzelt J. Groth D.F. Torchia M. Prusiner S.B. DeArmond S.J. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 1244-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were starved for 30 min in methionine-free modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and subsequently labeled for 30 min with 300 μCi/ml Pro-mix l-[35S] in vitro cell label mixture (Amersham; >37 TBq/mmol) in methionine-free modified Eagle's medium. For the chase, the labeling medium was removed, the cells were washed twice and then incubated in complete medium for the times indicated. For Endo H digestion, immunoprecipitation products were adjusted to 0.5% SDS, boiled for 10 min, and digested with endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37 °C. Immunoprecipitation of PrP was performed as described previously (21Winklhofer K.F. Tatzelt J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) using the monoclonal antibody 3F4. Immunoprecipitation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were impregnated with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to film. Surface Biotinylation—As described earlier (22Kiachopoulos S. Heske J. Tatzelt J. Winklhofer K.F. Traffic. 2004; 5: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), N2a cells grown in poly-d-lysine-coated (Sigma, 0.1 mg/ml) dishes were transiently transfected, washed twice with cold PBS, and labeled with impermeant LC-sulfo-NHS-(+)-biotin (Molecular BioSciences, 0.5 mg/ml) at 4 °C for 1 h. The cells were washed three times with cold PBS, incubated in ice-cold glycine (10 mm) at 4 °C for 30 min, and lysed in cold buffer A. PrP present in the detergent-soluble or -insoluble fraction was immunoprecipitated using monoclonal antibody 3F4. The immunoprecipitation products were analyzed by Western blotting using a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences). Indirect Immunofluorescence—N2a and SH-SY5Y cells grown on glass coverslips were rinsed two times in PBS, fixed in ice-cold methanol (permeabilized cells) for 10 min or in 3% paraformaldehyde (nonpermeabilized cells) for 30 min, and incubated with monoclonal antibody 3F4 (dilution 1:200) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 45 min at 37 °C. After extensive washing with cold PBS, an incubation with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Dianova) (dilution 1:200) followed at 37 °C for 30 min. The washed coverslips were mounted onto glass slides and examined by fluorescence microscopy (Axiovert 200 M, Zeiss) using the AxioVision 3.0 software. The Pathogenic PrP Mutant T182A Is Not Complex Glycosylated and Adopts a Partially Protease-resistant Conformation—To analyze the biogenesis of pathogenic human PrP mutants in mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells, we cloned the mouse PrP equivalents. It should be noted that all residues affected by pathogenic mutations are conserved between human and mouse PrP. In mouse PrP, the numbering of the amino acids is changed by –1 in comparison to human PrPC; for example, the pathogenic human mutant T183A corresponds to T182A in mouse PrP. All PrP constructs analyzed in this study contain the epitope for monoclonal antibody 3F4, which does not react with endogenous mouse PrP (20Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first addressed the question whether the lack of the first glycosylation site might change the biogenesis and cellular trafficking of PrPC. We therefore conducted a comparative study between T182A and N180Q, two mutants characterized by a defective consensus site for the first N-linked glycosylation. In addition, we included the N196Q mutant, in which the second glycosylation site is inactivated. After transient expression of these mutants in N2a cells, detergent lysates were prepared and fractionated by centrifugation. The Western blot analysis revealed that in contrast to wild type (WT) PrP, N180Q, and N196Q, the pathogenic mutant T182A was mainly found in the detergent-insoluble fraction (Fig. 1A). To analyze the glycosylation status of the PrP mutants, protein extracts were digested either with Endo H or PNGase F prior to the Western blot analysis. Whereas Endo H only cleaves high mannose or hybrid structures and is not active on glycans of complex structure, PNGase F can also deglycosylate fully matured PrPC. Consequently, WT PrP was not affected by Endo H digestion (Fig. 1B), but was deglycosylated by PNGase F (Fig. 1C). Similarly, N180Q and N196Q were resistant to Endo H, indicating that the remaining glycan was converted into a complex structure. In contrast, the glycan attached to T182A was sensitive to Endo H digestion, revealing that this mutant was not complex glycosylated (Fig. 1B). To investigate glycosylation of these PrP mutants in more detail, we performed metabolic labeling experiments and analyzed PrP by immunoprecipitation. During the chase, N180Q acquired an Endo H-resistant phenotype, whereas the glycan of the pathogenic mutant T182A remained fully sensitive to Endo H digestion, i.e. was not converted into a complex structure (Fig. 1D). The finding that T182A was mainly present in the detergent-insoluble fraction (Fig. 1A) might indicate a misfolded conformation of this pathogenic mutant. To test this possibility, we performed limited proteolysis experiments. Protein extracts from transiently transfected cells were incubated with increasing amounts of PK and the remaining PrP was detected by Western blotting. WT PrP and the monoglycosylated mutant N180Q were sensitive to PK digestion in a similar manner, however, the pathogenic mutant T182A was stable at a PK concentration sufficient to completely degrade WT PrP and N180Q (Fig. 1E). The initial analysis revealed that two PrP mutants, which both lack the first glycosylation site, display distinct biochemical properties. Whereas the remaining glycan of N180Q is converted into a complex structure, the core glycan of T182A is not terminally processed. In addition, the pathogenic mutant T182A adopts a misfolded, partially PK-resistant conformation. T182A Is Not Present at the Plasma Membrane—In a next step we analyzed the cellular localization of the PrP mutants. Intact cells were incubated either with trypsin to remove all cell surface proteins (Fig. 2A), or with PI-PLC to specifically liberate GPI-anchored proteins (Fig. 2B). Both assays were performed at 4 °C to prevent possible secretion. After trypsin treatment lysates prepared from WT PrP- or N180Q-expressing cells had lost most of their PrP, indicating that it was localized at the cell surface (Fig. 2A, Trypsin +). Similarly, after PI-PLC treatment WT PrP and N180Q were found almost quantitatively in the cell culture supernatant (Fig. 2B, PIPLC +, Medium). In contrast, the relative amount of T182A present in extracts prepared from trypsin- or PI-PLC-treated cells was not reduced when compared with the mock-treated control, nor was the cell culture supernatant of PI-PLC-treated cells expressing T182A enriched in PrP. Notably, in both assays the phenotype of T182A was similar to M204S, a PrP mutant generated and characterized in a previous study from our group (19Winklhofer K.F. Heske J. Heller U. Reintjes A. Muranji W. Moarefi I. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14961-14970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The single amino acid substitution in M204S destabilizes an interaction of helix 3 with helix 1. As a consequence, M204S does not receive a GPI anchor, the core glycans are not converted into complex structures, and the mutant protein is secreted into the cell culture medium (19Winklhofer K.F. Heske J. Heller U. Reintjes A. Muranji W. Moarefi I. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14961-14970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To provide further evidence that T182A was not present at the plasma membrane, we incubated the cells with the plasma membrane impermeant reagent LC-sulfo-NHS-(+)-biotin to specifically label cell surface PrP. After biotinylation, the cells were lysed in detergent buffer and PrP present in the detergent-soluble and -insoluble fraction was purified by immunoprecipitation with the anti-PrP antibody 3F4. Biotinylated PrP was then detected by Western blotting using streptavidin coupled to horseradish peroxidase. As shown in the left panel of Fig. 2C, only WT PrP and N180Q were biotinylated, indicating localization at the cell surface. To control expression of T182A, we analyzed a small fraction of the lysates prior to immunoprecipitation by Western blotting using the anti-PrP antibody 3F4 (Fig. 2C, right panel). Finally, we examined the cellular localization of the different PrP mutants by indirect immunofluorescence experiments. For this approach we used mouse N2a cells as well as the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, which does not express detectable amounts of endogenous PrPC (data not shown). To prove the cell surface localization of PrP, we first performed immunofluorescence experiments in non-permeabilized cells. Supporting the biochemical data, only WT PrP and N180Q were detectable with this approach (Fig. 3A). After permeabilization of the cells, T182A was visualized, indicating the intracellular localization of the pathogenic mutant (Fig. 3B). T182A Is Secreted into the Cell Culture Medium and Can Be Internalized by Heterologous Cells—The analysis described above revealed that the remaining glycan of the pathogenic mutant T182A was not converted into a complex structure and that the mutant protein was not present at the plasma membrane. These results mainly corroborate earlier reports that were interpreted such that T182A was not transported through the secretory pathway but retained in the ER (25Rogers M. Taraboulos A. Scott M. Groth D. Prusiner S.B. Glycobiology. 1990; 1: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 26Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21479-21487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Indeed, Endo H-sensitive glycans are often used as a diagnostic marker for proteins residing in the ER, however, numerous examples indicate that complex glycosylation is dispensable for trafficking of PrP. A PrP mutant devoid of the GPI anchor signal sequence (PrPΔGPI) is mainly unglycosylated, yet efficiently secreted into the cell culture medium (19Winklhofer K.F. Heske J. Heller U. Reintjes A. Muranji W. Moarefi I. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14961-14970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Rogers M. Yehiely F. Scott M. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl.

Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1465-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Similarly, high mannose glycoforms of different PrP mutants, such as M204S, are efficiently secreted (19Winklhofer K.F. Heske J. Heller U. Reintjes A. Muranji W. Moarefi I. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14961-14970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Even trafficking of GPI-anchored PrPC is not dependent on the formation of complex glycans. In the presence of geldanamycin or α-mannosidase inhibitors, a high mannose isoform of PrPC is present on the plasma membrane (29Winklhofer K.F. Heller U. Reintjes A. Tatzelt J. Traffic. 2003; 4: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Based on these findings we investigated possible secretion of T182A. Transiently transfected cells were cultivated in serum-free medium for 3 h at 37 °C and then the cell culture supernatant was analyzed for the presence of PrP. Indeed, the pathogenic mutant was efficiently secreted under these conditions, in contrast to WT PrP and N180Q (Fig. 4A, Medium). What might be the fate of secreted T182A? To address this question, we collected cell culture medium from transfected cells, removed possibly detached cells and added this cell-free medium to untransfected N2a cells. After 48 h at 37 °C, these cells were extensively washed, lysed, and PrP present in the detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions was analyzed by Western blotting using the 3F4 antibody (Fig. 4B). Neither WT PrP nor the monoglycosylated mutant N180Q was present in the cell extracts, however, the T182A mutant could be detected in the detergent-insoluble fraction of the heterologous cells, similarly to M204S, which is efficiently secreted as well (19Winklhofer K.F. Heske J. Heller U. Reintjes A. Muranji W. Moarefi I. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14961-14970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To specifically investigate whether the pathogenic PrP mutant simply associated with the cell surface of the heterologous cells or was present within the cells, we performed indirect immunofluorescence experiments with permeabilized and non-permeabilized cells using the 3F4 antibody (Fig. 4C). 3F4-positive cells were found only in untransfected N2a cells incubated in medium derived from T182A-expressing cells. Moreover, T182A was detectable exclusively in permeabilized cells, indicating an intracellular localization. These experiments revealed that misfolded T182A is not retained in the ER. This pathogenic mutant is rather efficiently secreted, moreover, it can be internalized by heterologous cells. T182A Is Degraded in a Lysosomal Compartment—The foregoing experiments revealed that T182A adopts a misfolded conformation in the ER and, at least a fraction thereof, is secreted. Next we wanted to analyze the degradation pathway of T182A. It is known that misfolded ER proteins can be degraded via a pathway termed ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). This pathway includes retrograde transport of the misfolded proteins into the cytosol and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. To address the possibility that misfolded T182A is subjected to ERAD, we analyzed the effect of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 on the lifetime of mutant PrP (Fig. 5A). As a control we included a cytosolic version of PrP into our analysis (cytoPrP), which is devoid of the N-terminal ER signal peptide and thus is targeted exclusively to the cytosol (30Heske J. Heller U. Winklhofer K.F. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5435-5443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Transiently transfected N2a cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min and then PrP was analyzed by immunoprecipitation either directly (pulse) or after an additional 2 h in fresh medium (chase). Cytosolically located PrP was efficiently degraded by the proteasome; in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 cytoPrP was significantly stabilized (Fig. 5A, cytoPrP). However, proteasomal inhibition did not increase the relative amount of T182A present after the 2-h chase (Fig. 5A, T182A). Similar results were obtained in transiently transfected SH-SY5Y cells analyzed under steady state conditions (Fig. 5B). Next we analyzed whether T182A is degraded in a lysosomal compartment.

The HMGA1 protooncogene codes for two closely related isoform proteins, HMGA1a and HMGA1b, and causes cancerous cellular transformation when overexpressed in either transgenic mice or “normal” cultured cell lines. Previous work has suggested that the in vivo types and patterns of the HMGA1 post-translational modifications (PTMs) differ between normal and malignant cells. The present study focuses on the important question of whether HMGA1a and HMGA1b proteins isolated from the same cell type have identical or different PTM patterns and also whether these isoform patterns differ between non-malignant and malignant cells. Two independent mass spectrometry methods were used to identify the types of PTMs found on specific amino acid residues on the endogenous HMGA1a and HMGA1b proteins isolated from a non-metastatic human mammary epithelial cell line, MCF-7, and a malignant metastatic cell line derived from MCF-7 cells that overexpressed the transgenic HMGA1a protein. Although some of the PTMs were the same on both the HMGA1a and HMGA1b proteins isolated from a given cell type, many other modifications were present on one but not the other isoform. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both HMGA1 isoforms are di-methylated on arginine and lysine residues. Most importantly, however, the PTM patterns on the endogenous HMGA1a and HMGA1b proteins isolated from non-metastatic and metastatic cells were consistently different, suggesting that the isoforms likely exhibit differences in their biological functions/activities in these cell types.

Overexpression of the HMGA1 gene (formerly known as HMGIY (1Bustin M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 152-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) is such a consistent feature of tumors that it has been suggested to be a “diagnostic” biochemical marker of both neoplastic transformation and cancer progression (2Bussemakers M.J. van de Ven W.J.

Gastroenterol. 2003; 38: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of HMGA1 gene products and HMGA1 proteins have been observed in almost every cancer type investigated and are correlated with increasing degrees of malignancy and metastatic potential of a number of cancer types (6Reeves R. Environ. Health Perspect. 2000; 108: 803-809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Reeves R. Beckerbauer L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1519: 13-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 10Reeves R. Beckerbauer L.M. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2003; 5: 279-286PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, it was demonstrated that overexpression of HMGA1 proteins in “normal” rat 1a cells and a human breast adenocarcinoma cell line caused neoplastic transformation and malignant metastatic progression of these cells, respectively (11Wood L.J. Maher J.F. Bunton T.E. Resar L.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4256-4261PubMed Google Scholar, 12Reeves R. Edberg D.D. Li Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Together, these results demonstrate that overexpression of full-length HMGA1 proteins in tumor cells is extremely widespread and biologically important. The HMGA1a (formerly known as HMG-I) and HMGA1b (formerly known as HMG-Y) isoform proteins are architectural transcription factors that are derived from alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts coded for by the HMGA1 gene located on human chromosome 6 (locus 6p21) with HMGA1b (95 amino acids; ∼10.6 kDa) containing an internal 11-amino acid deletion compared with HMGA1a (106 amino acids; ∼11.5 kDa) (13Friedmann M. Holth L.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Reeves R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4259-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Both isoforms contain three independent DNA-binding regions, called AT-hook motifs, that bind to the DNA minor groove and preferentially recognize the structure of short stretches of an AT-rich sequence (14Elton T.S. Nissen M.S. Reeves R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 143: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Reeves R. Nissen M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). However, the internal 11-amino acid deletion changes the spacing between AT-hooks I and II in the HMGA1b protein compared with that in the HMGA1a isoform. Originally, the HMGA1a and -A1b proteins were thought to possess the same biological activities/functions because the binding of recombinant proteins (which lack secondary biochemical modifications) to DNA substrates appeared to be similar for both isoforms. The first suggestion that HMGA1a and -A1b proteins might have different biological functions in vivo came from the work of Banks et al. (17Banks G.C. Li Y. Reeves R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8333-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) that demonstrated that post-translational modifications (PTMs) 1The abbreviations used are: PTMs, post-translational modifications; CIP, calf intestinal phosphatase; ESI, electrospray ionization; HA7C, transgenic HA-HMGA1a overexpressing MCF-7/Tet-Off cell line; MALDI MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry; rh, recombinant human; RP-HPLC, reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography; TOF, time-of-flight. of the HMGA1a and HMGA1b isoforms affect their mode of DNA-protein interactions. Additionally, different PTM patterns were detected in vivo on HMGA1a and -A1b proteins isolated from different tissue culture cell types (17Banks G.C. Li Y. Reeves R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8333-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Direct confirmation that HMGA1a and HMGA1b could indeed have different functions in vivo was subsequently obtained when one or the other of these isoforms was overexpressed as a tetracycline-regulated transgene in human MCF-7 mammary epithelial tumor cells (12Reeves R. Edberg D.D. Li Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These experiments demonstrated that artificially induced overexpression of the HMGA1b transgene in the non-metastatic MCF-7 cells caused them to progress much more rapidly to a metastatic and highly malignant phenotype than did induced overexpression of the transgenic HMGA1a isoform. Moreover, oligonucleotide microarray studies revealed that the gene expression profile in MCF-7 cells overexpressing transgenic HMGA1a was significantly different from the profile in cells overexpressing transgenic HMGA1b. Western blot analysis of proteins being expressed in these cells further confirmed the microarray results, thus demonstrating that the HMGA1a and HMGA1b isoforms differentially regulate specific genes in the transgenic MCF-7 mammary epithelial cells (12Reeves R. Edberg D.D. Li Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Clearly, there are distinct functional differences between the HMGA1a and -A1b isoforms in vivo, but more research is required to determine whether PTMs of the proteins play a role in these observed biological differences. In vivo phosphorylation of HMGA1 was first discovered in Ehrlich ascites cells (18Lund T. Holtlund J. Laland S.G. FEBS Lett. 1985; 180: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and Friend erythroleukemic cells (19Elton T.S. Reeves R. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) where, along with histone H1, they are among the most highly phosphorylated chromatin proteins in the nucleus. Further research also demonstrated that HMGA1 proteins are phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, specifically during metaphase (20Lund T. Skalhegg B.S. Holtlund J. Blomhoff H.K. Laland S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 21Lund T. Laland S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These discoveries led researchers to identify HMGA1 phosphorylation by specific kinases such as cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (22Reeves R. Langan T.A. Nissen M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

More recently, di-methylations of both arginine and lysine residues were discovered on the HMGA1a protein that may correlate to the metastatic potential of the cells (32Edberg D.D. Bruce J.E. Siems W.F. Reeves R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11500-11515Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that HMGA1 proteins are biochemically modified in vivo for specific purposes, for example, enhanceosome formation/destabilization (28Munshi N. Merika M. Yie J. Senger K.

Nevertheless, the present knowledge of the types and patterns of in vivo PTMs found on HMGA1 proteins in different cell types and in the same cells under different physiological conditions is quite limited, and must be better characterized before the biological significance of such modifications can be fully and critically assessed. An important unanswered question in cell biology is whether differences in the types and patterns of in vivo PTMs present on closely related isoform proteins differentially influence the biological function/activity of these proteins in cells. For example, a complete characterization of the types and sites of PTMs present on the HMGA1a and -A1b proteins found in the same cell type has not yet been conducted. Likewise, no systematic assessment has been made of the types and sites of PTMs found on these closely related isoform proteins in cells that have been experimentally induced to exhibit markedly different phenotypic characteristics to gain insight into the molecular modifications of the proteins relating to cellular phenotype. In the present study, we employed mass spectrometry techniques to examine systematically the in vivo PTMs found on the endogenous HMGA1a and -A1b proteins in cells under varying sets of conditions. We focused on the differential in vivo PTMs found on the closely related HMGA1a and HMGA1b proteins isolated from two genetically matched MCF-7 lines of human mammary epithelial cells (“MCF-7/Tet-Off” and HA7C) whose origins and biochemical and phenotypic characteristics have been described in detail previously (12Reeves R. Edberg D.D. Li Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The parental MCF-7/Tet-Off cell line expresses very low levels of the endogenous HMGA1 protein, does not readily grow in soft agar, and does not form tumors in nude mice, which is characteristic of normal mammary epithelial cells (12Reeves R. Edberg D.D. Li Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In contrast, the HA7C cell line (which was originally derived from the MCF-7/Tet-Off cell line by stable transfection) is induced to overexpress transgenic HMGA1a protein when the cells are grown in the absence of tetracycline. As a consequence of this induced overexpression of transgenic HMGA1a protein (∼40 times the amount of the endogenous protein and well within the concentration range found in naturally occurring human cancers), the HA7C cells acquire the ability to grow in soft agarose, form primary tumors when injected into nude mice, and exhibit a moderately metastatic and invasive phenotype (12Reeves R. Edberg D.D. Li Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In contrast to previous studies that identified PTMs on only the most abundant HMGA1 protein species present in cells, an important technical advance in the present investigation was the inclusion of all of the different in vivo modified forms of the endogenous HMGA1 proteins found in a given cell type for analysis by mass spectrometry. Our results demonstrate that the endogenous HMGA1 proteins within a given cell type represent a complex and heterogeneous population, with the HMGA1a and HMGA1b proteins exhibiting a much higher level of in vivo PTMs than has been reported previously. Most importantly, we report the first observed differential in vivo modifications on the HMGA1a and HMGA1b proteins isolated from the same cell type, and we demonstrate that the PTM patterns found on these isoforms differ in non-metastatic and metastatic MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, complex patterns of PTMs were observed on all three of the AT-hook regions of the HMGA1a and -A1b proteins that appeared to differ between the isoforms present within the same cell type as well as between non-metastatic and metastatic cells. These findings provide the first comprehensive comparison of the PTM patterns found on the HMGA1 isoforms in mammalian cells. Cell Lines and Cell Culture Methods—The cell lines utilized in this study were MCF-7/Tet-Off (Clontech, catalog number C30071), which is a non-metastatic line of MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells, and HA7C, a derivative line of MCF-7/Tet-Off cells that has been stably transfected with an expression vector containing a full-length human HMGA1a cDNA (clone 7C) (34Johnson K.R. Lehn D.A. Reeves R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) in which transcription is controlled by a tetracycline-regulated promoter (12Reeves R. Edberg D.D. Li Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In HA7C cells, the N terminus of the HMGA1a cDNA protein-coding region is fused, in-frame, with a hemagglutinin peptide tag so that the chimeric transgenic protein produced by the vector can be distinguished and separated from the native, endogenous HMGA1a protein. Both the parental MCF-7/Tet-Off and the HA7C cell lines were grown and maintained as described previously (12Reeves R. Edberg D.D. Li Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Tetracycline was not added to the medium of the HA7C cells in order to maximize the transgenic HMGA1a protein overexpression. The cells were harvested when confluent and frozen at –70 °C until needed. Protein Isolation, Purification, and Detection—Recombinant human (rh) HMGA1 proteins were extracted from Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 pLysS cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with diluted (5%) trichloroacetic acid and were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) techniques, as described previously (35Reeves R. Nissen M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 155-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, following acid extraction, the HMGA1 proteins were purified by utilizing an RP-HPLC C4 Microsorb analytical column with a linear acetonitrile, 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid gradient from 10 to 25% acetonitrile. Further purification of the HMGA1 proteins was accomplished with a C18 Dynamax analytical RP-HPLC column with a linear acetonitrile, 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid gradient from 5 to 23% acetonitrile. RP-HPLC isolated HMGA1 protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE following standard protocols (34Johnson K.R. Lehn D.A. Reeves R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and verified by MALDI MS. Endogenous HMGA1 proteins were also isolated from both of the MCF-7 cell lines by employing these conditions. Detection of Endogenous HMGA1 Proteins Isolated from MCF-7 Cells—To confirm the presence of HMGA1 proteins extracted from both parental and the transgenic MCF-7 cell lines and from RP-HPLC-purified protein fractions, SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using polyclonal anti-HMGA1 were employed following published protocols (35Reeves R. Nissen M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 155-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Additionally, SDS-PAGE was used to assess the purity and concentration of (within the nanogram to microgram range) endogenous, in vivo modified HMGA1 proteins using known concentrations of pure rhHMGA1 proteins as reference standards (data not shown). Enzyme Digestions of the HMGA1 Proteins—Purified native HMGA1 proteins from each of the experimental cells lines were separated into two equal fractions of 0.5 mg and lyophilized. One of the samples was dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) (Roche Applied Science), and the reactions (3 μg of in vivo modified HMGA1, 30 units of CIP) were carried out at 37 °C for 12 h in the reaction buffer supplied by the manufacturer. The dephosphorylated HMGA1 proteins were purified from the CIP by trichloroacetic acid precipitation (35Reeves R. Nissen M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 155-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Both the native and dephosphorylated samples were then individually lyophilized, reconstituted, and divided into two equal fractions. Sequencing grade proteinase Arg-C (Sigma) or sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) (50:1 mass ratio of protein to enzyme) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) at 37 °C was used to digest the samples. Tryptic digestions were carried out for 4 h, while Arg-C reactions were digested for 10 h, with the length of the reactions empirically determined. Partial tryptic digestions were essential because complete cleavage of HMGA1 resulted in small peptide fragments, making them difficult to analyze by mass spectrometry. Trifluoroacetic acid was added to a final volume of 2% to terminate the reactions. The samples were lyophilized, and the peptides were redissolved in H2O. MALDI Mass Spectrometry—A PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager DE-RP MALDI time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer (Framingham, MA) was used to analyze the HMGA1 digestions in the linear positive ion mode according to published protocols (17Banks G.C. Li Y. Reeves R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8333-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 36Chong B.E. Lubman D.M. Rosenspire A. Miller F. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 12: 1986-1993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Mann M. Hendrickson R.C. Pandey A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 437-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). TOF was measured over 256 laser pulses and averaged into a single spectrum. Saturated matrix solution consisting of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 50% acetonitrile, 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid was mixed with full-length rhHMGA1 and purified in in vivo modified HMGA1 proteins. The HMGA1 protein digestions were then mixed with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix solution and calibration mixture 3 (Cal Mix) and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Both matrices were purchased from Sigma. To maximize peak detection, three different scans were carried out on every protein/peptide sample. MALDI-TOF MS Calibration—The MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer was internally calibrated using standards purchased from PE Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Briefly, the best peak definition for the range of analysis (400–5000 mass/charge (m/z)) needed for the rhHMGA1a peptide samples was achieved with the instrument settings of noise filter “1” and Gaussian smooth “23.” Internal calibrations were performed using the 379.35 m/z α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix dimer and the 5734.59 m/z bovine insulin peaks, and these conditions were chosen for the first “rough” internal calibration. An additional fine-tuned calibration of each spectrum was accomplished by calibrating on multiple unmodified HMGA1 peptides resulting from either tryptic or Arg-C digestions. Data Analysis—Data Explorer version 5.1 (PE Biosystems) was used to analyze m/z ratios for proteins and peptides. The analysis strategies were as follows. Prior to analysis, known peptide peaks resulting from autodigestion of trypsin (prospector.ucsf.edu/ucsfhtml4.0/misc/trypsin.htm) and potential human keratin contamination masses identified by the EXPASY FindPept tool (www.expasy.ch) were removed from each tryptic spectrum. Autodigestion and human keratins resulting from Arg-C enzymatic digestions were also accounted for by using the Find-Pept tool and removed from the corresponding spectra. The remaining peak masses were then copied into an Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) spreadsheet from the Data Explorer program on both the vertical axis and horizontal axis to produce a two-dimensional matrix. Each cell not on the vertical and horizontal axis in the spreadsheet matrix contained a formula that calculated mass differences between adjacent spectrum peaks. Mass differences between the 21.5- and 22.5-Da mass range from adjacent peaks, corresponding to possible sodium adducts, were removed from further analysis. Peak masses remaining after removal of the possible contaminating human keratin peaks, trypsin/Arg-C peptide peaks, and sodium adducts were further analyzed with the EXPASY FindMod tool (www.expasy.ch), Protein Prospector MS-digest program (www.prospector.ucsf.edu), and manual mass calculations. The average mass values of 14.03, 42.08, and 79.98 were used for the analysis of potential PTMs, methylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation, respectively. Only peaks that corresponded to our data range criterion of less than ±150 ppm were further analyzed. Electrospray Ionization Tandem Mass Spectrometry—HMGA1 peptides from enzymatic digestions were separated by using an Agilent 1100 capillary LC system with a 40-cm capillary column (150 μm inner diameter × 360 μm outer diameter, Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ) packed with 5-μm C18 particles (PoroS 20R2, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Peptide elution was achieved at a flow rate of 1.8 μl/min using water, acetonitrile, 0.1% acetic acid, 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid with a linear gradient from 10 to 60% acetonitrile. The capillary column flow was infused directly into a Thermo-Finnigan LCQ Deca XP ion trap mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer duty-cycle length was optimized to include a single full MS scan followed by three MS/MS scans on the three most intense parental masses (determined by Caliber® software in real time) from the single parent ion full scan. Dynamic mass exclusion windows of 3 min were used. MS/MS spectra for all samples were measured with an overall mass/charge window of 400–2000 m/z. Analysis of HMGA1 Peptides—Resulting tandem mass spectra were analyzed by SEQUEST® (Bioworks 2.0 ThermoFinnigan) (38Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spec. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5444) Google Scholar, 39Yates III, J.R. McCormack A.L. Eng J.K. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 534-540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Yates III, J.R.

These idealized spectra are weighted largely with “b” and “y” fragment ions, i.e. fragmentation at the peptide bond from the N and C termini, respectively. The peptide mass tolerance was set to 1.0; the fragment ion tolerance was set to 0.0; and trypsin and Arg-C enzyme rules were applied during SEQUEST® analysis. Single and double dynamic modifications representing phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation were used to analyze the MS/MS spectra against a data base containing primarily HMG proteins and other chromatin proteins. Extensive manual analysis of singly and doubly ionized spectra was conducted (43Kinter M. Sherman N.E. Protein Sequencing and Identification Using Tandem Mass Spectrometry. Wiley-Interscience, New York2000Crossref Google Scholar) to validate and complete the analysis begun with SEQUEST®. Diverse Post-translationally Modified HMGA1 Isoform Protein Populations within Human MCF-7 Mammary Epithelial Cells—As illustrated in Fig. 1, the endogenous HMGA1a and HMGA1b proteins were isolated from the MCF-7/Tet-Off cells and scanned with MALDI-TOF MS to examine their PTMs. The most prominent peaks in the in vivo HMGA1 comprehensive profiles generally correspond to the proteins with a single acetylation, most likely N-terminal acetylation. Furthermore, HMGA1a (11.54–12.46 kDa) and HMGA1b (10.59–11.36 kDa) PTMs are observed over large mass ranges (Fig. 1). The array of different masses observed in the MALDI-TOF MS spectra of these protein preparations indicates that both the HMGA1a and -A1b proteins exist in cells as a heterogeneous population of many different biochemically modified forms. Furthermore, their different mass ranges suggest that some HMGA1a proteins are more highly modified in vivo than the HMGA1b isoforms. In Vi"

The results were remarkably similar to those obtained earlier with sodium pump (Kasho, V. N., Stengelin, M., Smirnova, I. N., and Faller, L. D. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 8045– 8052). The equation for ordered binding of Mg2+ before Pi fit the data best with only a slight chance (0.6%) of Pi binding to apoenzyme. Therefore, Pi is the substrate, and Mg2+ is an obligatory cofactor. The intrinsic Mg2+ dissociation constant from metalloenzyme (KM = 3.5 ± 0.3 mm) was experimentally indistinguishable from the sodium pump value. However, the half-maximal concentration for Pi binding to metalloenzyme (KP'6.3±0.6mM) was significantly higher (∼6-fold), and the probability of calcium pump forming phosphoenzyme from bound Pi (Pc = 0.04 ± 0.03) was significantly lower (∼6-fold) than for the sodium pump. From estimates of the rate constants for phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, the calcium pump appears to catalyze phosphoryl group transfer less efficiently than the sodium pump. Ordered binding of Mg2+ before Pi implies that both calcium pump and sodium pump form a ternary enzyme·metal·phosphate complex, consistent with molecular structures of other haloacid dehalogenase superfamily members that were crystallized with Mg2+ and phosphate, or a phosphate analogue, bound.

The calcium and sodium pumps are classified as P-type, 1The abbreviations used are: P-type, phosphoenzyme-forming pump; Ca-ATPase (calcium pump), Ca2+- and Mg2+-dependent ATPase (EC 3.6.1.38); H,K-ATPase (proton pump), Mg2+-dependent, H+-transporting, and K+-stimulated ATPase (EC 3.6.1.36); Na,K-ATPase (sodium pump), Mg2+-dependent and Na+- and K+-stimulated ATPase (EC 3.6.1.37); BAD, bound and determined (www.stanford.edu/∼cpatton/other.html); SF, stopped flow; Radj, multiple correlation coefficient adjusted for number of degrees of freedom; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MOPS 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. because the energy required for generating ion gradients across cell membranes is derived from ATP by catalyzing hydrolysis in two, Mg2+-dependent steps (1Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18855-18858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The γ-phosphoryl group is initially transferred to an aspartyl side chain of the protein in one conformation (E1) forming a covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate. Hydrolysis is completed after a conformational change by transferring the phosphoryl group to water. The second step can be reversed by reacting the second conformation (E2), with Pi and can be followed either by radioactive 32P incorporation into the enzyme, or by stable oxygen isotope (18O) exchange between Pi and H2O. Phosphorylation by Pi is a partial reaction that can be uncoupled from other reactions in the pump cycle experimentally, so that the mechanism is simple enough for derivation of the rate equation. Therefore, measurements combining either 32P incorporation or 18O exchange with site-directed mutagenesis are potentially a powerful way of identifying amino acids essential for catalyzing phosphoryl group transfer and of learning their function from estimates of intrinsic constants for interaction of reactants with the enzyme. The problem considered in this report is the mechanism of Mg2+-dependent phosphorylation by Pi. The solution is important because the interpretation of observed differences between mutants and wild-type enzyme depends upon the way in which intrinsic properties of the protein enter into the expressions for the half-maximum substrate concentration and either the maximum amount of 32P bound, or the maximum rate of 32P incorporation or 18O exchange. Currently, different mechanisms are assumed in interpreting studies of the calcium and sodium pumps. A recent review article (2Lee A.G. East J.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 665-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) states categorically that Mg2+ and Pi bind randomly to Ca-ATPase. Most published studies of purified enzyme in aqueous solution support this interpretation (3Punzengruber C. Prager R. Kolassa N. Winkler F. Suko J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 4Kolassa N. Punzengruber C. Suko J. Makinose M.

However, a study in an organic solvent-water mixture concluded that the true substrate is Mg·Pi (8Champeil P. Guillain F. Ve ́nien C. Gingold M.P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and recently the equation for the half-maximum Mg·Pi concentration was used to interpret an increased half-maximum Pi concentration when the upstream threonine in a signature amino acid sequence for P-type pumps (DKTGT) was changed to serine (9Clausen J.D. McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35741-35750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The interpretation given to most studies of Na,K-ATPase is also that Mg2+ and Pi bind randomly (10Kuriki Y. Halsey J. Biltonen R. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4956-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Askari A. Huang W.-H. McCormick P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3453-3460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11116-11127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we concluded from fits of rate equations for alternative mechanisms to the 18O exchange rate as a function of reactant concentrations that Mg2+ binds to purified Na,K-ATPase before Pi (13Kasho V.N. Stengelin M. Smirnova I.N. Faller L.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8045-8052Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We estimated the intrinsic affinity of apoenzyme for Mg2+ with the rate equation for ordered binding of Mg2+ before Pi and interpreted mutations of amino acids in two other signature sequences for P-type pumps DPPR (14Farley R.A. Elquza E. Mu ̈ller-Ehmsen J. Kane D.J. Nagy A.K. Kasho V.N. Faller L.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6361-6370Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and DGVND (15Faller L.D. Kasho V.N. Nagy A.K. Farley R.A. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 262aGoogle Scholar) by comparing mutant Mg2+ dissociation constants with the wild-type Na,K-ATPase value. Phosphorylation of the calcium and sodium pumps by different mechanisms seems unlikely, because the amino acids implicated in phosphoryl group transfer are in conserved sequences and the phosphorylation domain containing most of them has the characteristic fold of haloacid dehydrogenase superfamily members (16Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the calcium pump also binds Mg2+ before Pi by studying purified Ca-ATPase-catalyzed exchange of 18O between Pi and water as a function of an array of Mg2+ and Pi concentrations. The results resembled those obtained earlier with Na,K-ATPase (13Kasho V.N. Stengelin M. Smirnova I.N. Faller L.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8045-8052Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Neither the equation for Pi binding before Mg2+, nor the equation for reaction with Mg·Pi, fit the data well. The equations for ordered binding of Mg2+ before Pi and for random binding fit the data comparably. However, the fit of random binding was achieved by estimating more than two orders of magnitude higher affinity of apoenzyme for Mg2+ than for Pi. Therefore, the dominant pathway for the calcium pump, as well as the sodium pump, is ordered binding of Mg2+ before Pi. Catalysis of 18O exchange by the same mechanism strengthens the justification for quantitatively interpreting data for site-directed mutants of P-type pumps with the rate equation for ordered binding of Mg2+ before Pi. The implication of ordered binding to the E2 conformation for the molecular mechanism is that P-type pumps form a ternary enzyme·metal·phosphate complex (E2·Mg·Pi). Enzyme Preparation and Purification—Ca-ATPase was prepared from washed sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes as described by MacLennan (17MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

The theoretical phosphorylation level for a molecular mass of 109,485 Da is 9.13 nmol mg–1. Therefore, 65 ± 6% of the Lowry protein in the membranes was functional enzyme, assuming complete phosphorylation in the organic solvent-water mixture at the lower pH (8Champeil P. Guillain F.

Synthesis of 18O-enriched Inorganic Phosphate—We synthesized stable isotope-enriched Pi by reacting ultrapure PCl5 (Alpha Products) with 18O-enriched water (Icon) in a dry box (21Stempel K.E. Boyer P.D. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 64: 60-83Google Scholar). The average enrichment (ΣjP18Oj16O4–j /4ΣP18Oj16O4–j, where j = 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4) of the preparation used in the reported experiments was 96.1%. The filled bars in Fig. 1 show the starting distribution of phosphate isotopomers (P18Oj16O4–j). A 78.5 mm stock solution of the enriched Pi was titrated to pH 7 with Tris base and stored frozen at –20 °C. Measurement and Analysis of 18O Exchange—Most measurements were made at pH 7.0 in 50 mm HEPES buffer containing 50 mm KCl and 0.5 mm EGTA. Each experiment consisted of a control titration including 1 mm CaCl2, which converts the enzyme to the E1 conformation, and duplicate titrations of the E2 conformation without CaCl2 at eight concentrations of MgCl2 or 18O-enriched Pi with the concentration of the other reactant fixed. Fig. 1 shows that ignoring the time dependence of the background exchange did not introduce significant error, because Ca2+ inhibited 99% of the observed exchange in a representative experiment. The total [Mg2+]o and [Pi]o concentrations needed to give free concentrations of titrant equaling 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mm at fixed concentrations of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 7.5 mm Mg2+ or 2, 3, 3.5, 5, 6, and 10 mm Pi were approximated with the quadratic equation for formation of a 1:1 complex between Mg2+ and Pi (see Equation 5 of Ref. 13Kasho V.N.

Baykov A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The actual free concentrations were estimated from [Mg2+]o and [Pi]o with the chelator program BAD (23Brooks S.P.J. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). BAD iteratively solves nonlinear equations like the quadratic equation for Mg·Pi for all the equilibria between metals and chelators in our experiments, including Mg2+ binding to EGTA and Pi coordination by K+, using consensus dissociation constants that take into account the ionization state of the chelator, as well as the effects of ionic strength and temperature on proton and metal-ion equilibria. The concentration of free Pi was found by summing the concentrations of Pi in different protonation states. The concentration of free Mg·Pi was found by summing the concentrations of the protonated and unprotonated forms of Pi with Mg2+ bound. The reaction was started by adding 0.07 mg ml–1 of protein in a final volume of 200 μl and run for 60 min at 24 °C in a thermostated mixer. As a control for the effect of K+ on the phosphorylation mechanism, 50 mm choline chloride was substituted for KCl in duplicate titrations with ∼2mm fixed free Mg2+ or Pi. In this control, the reaction time was also lengthened (260 min) to compensate for a lower protein concentration (0.02 mg ml–1) and an anticipated slower exchange rate. The ionic strength (μ) was increased from 102 mm (including 50 mm KCl) to 163 mm with choline chloride at fixed total concentrations of Mg2+ and Pi (both 7.9 mm) as a control for variation of the rate with μ. The methods used to quench the reaction, isolate Pi, synthesize volatile triethyl phosphate, and analyze the product with a Hewlett-Packard 5972A GCMS, which was upgraded during the study with an Agilent Technologies G1896A autosampler and HP G1701BA software and operated in the SIM (selected ion monitoring) mode, have all been described previously (13Kasho V.N.

(Lewisville, TX) synthesized N-ethyl-N-nitroso-p-toluenesufonamide, the precursor for the diazoethane used to derivatize Pi. Theory of 18O Exchange—Oxygen exchange between Pi and water requires covalent bond cleavage. The nonenzymatic reaction is extremely slow with a half-time at 100 °C of one and one-half weeks (24Hackney D.D. Boyer P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3133-3137Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The E2 conformation of P-type pumps catalyzes the reaction by initially forming a noncovalent “Michaelis” complex (E2·Pi) that is converted into a covalent phosphoenzyme (E2–P) by nucleophilic attack of an aspartyl oxygen atom (25Dahms A.S. Kanazawa T. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6592-6595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Reaction 1).E2+Pi⇄k−Pik+PiE2⋅Pi⇄k+H2Ok−H2OE2−P+H2OReaction 1 The reaction can be followed either by synthesizing 18O-enriched Pi, or by running the reaction in [18O]H2O. Oxygen exchange is a pseudo first-order process with hydrolysis rate constant k′+H2O, because the concentration of unenriched H2O (55.6 m) did not change (Equation 1).vex=k′+H2O[E2−P]=k′+H2OEoχE2−P=VmaxχE2−P(Eq. 1) The measured isotope exchange rate is slower than the oxygen exchange rate (vex), because 18O exchange depends upon the enrichment of the labeled reactant and upon the number of times the covalent bond with the enzyme is formed before Pi dissociates. The partition coefficient (Pc) is the probability of bound Pi forming phosphoenzyme, which depends upon the rate constants for Pi (k–Pi) and water (k–H2O) loss from the Michaelis complex (Equation 2).Pc=k−H2Ok−Pi+k−H2O(Eq. 2) Hackney (26Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5320-5328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) derived equations for estimating Pc and a first-order rate constant (k) from the observed isotopomer distribution as a function of time and the starting isotopomer distribution of 18O-enriched Pi by assuming equivalence of the oxygen atoms in the transition state. We wrote a nonlinear least squares program (available upon request) for estimating k and Pc from a single time point and calculated vex in microatoms min–1 mg–1 from the estimated exchange parameters and the total concentrations of protein in milligrams ml–1 (Po) and Pi in molarity ([Pi]o) with Equation 3 (27Faller L.D. Diaz R.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6908-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).vex=kPc(1−Pc)[Pi]0P0(Eq. 3) The rate equation relating vex to reactant concentrations depends upon the mechanism of Mg2+-dependent phosphorylation. The theoretical maximum rate (Vmax) is k′+H2OEo (Equation 1), where Eo is the concentration of functional enzyme in milligrams ml–1. The observed rate depends upon the fraction of the enzyme with Pi covalently attached (χE2–P = [E2–P]/Eo) calculated by assuming all of the binding equilibria are rapid and applying the stationary-state assumption to E2–P.

In compiling the data, two criteria were used to identify outliers. First, isotopomer distributions giving Pc estimates greater than two standard deviations from the mean or indistinguishable from zero (rounded value <10–6) were discarded, even though retaining the points improved the fits. Second, points outside the 90% confidence interval for the two most likely mechanisms (III and IV) and an additional mechanism (V), which was considered to explain inhibition of exchange at high concentrations of both Mg2+ and Pi, were rejected. Rounded mean values ± S.D. for each [Pi]o and [Mg2+]o pair are tabulated to save space. All the averaged vex estimates in Table II from titrations with Mg2+ (triangles) or Pi (circles) are plotted against the free Mg2+ and Pi concentrations in Fig. 2. The S.D. values in the table for n = 2 indicate the precision of duplicate measurements. The reproducibility of vex estimated from different titrations is illustrated by the Mg2+ titration at ∼2 mm free Pi (inverted triangles), which was repeated (n = 4) as a control for upgrading and reprogramming the gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer. The estimated percent S.D. in Pc = 0.04 ± 0.03 (S.E.M. = 0.002) is large (75%), because three of the twelve titrations gave consistently higher estimates of Pc. However, there was no discernible effect on the estimates of vex. Fig. 3 shows that points for the same choice of [Pi]o and [Mg2+]o from different titrations superimpose regardless of the titrant or Pc estimate. In Fig. 3, estimates of vex from Mg2+ titrations (triangles) are plotted on the Pi titrations (circles) without discernible Mg·Pi inhibition (0.16 ≤ [Mg2+]free ≤ 6.05 mm). The mean data points plotted (±S.D.) in Fig. 3 are indicated by bold type in Table I. The ionic strength increased from 69 to 207 mm with added Mg2+ and Pi. However, no trend or change in exchange rate was observed (vex = 1.32 ± 0.06 microatom min–1 mg–1) when μ was increased from 102 to 163 mm with choline chloride in a control experiment (n = 3). Substituting choline+ for K+ reduced the estimates of vex at corresponding free Mg2+ and Pi values roughly one-half to one-third, but the shape of the Mg2+ or Pi titration curves (not shown) did not change significantly, and the conclusion drawn about the mechanism from multivariate nonlinear regression analysis was the same, i.e. Mg2+ binds before Pi. The regression lines in Figs. 2 and 3 are spline curves drawn through the origin and points calculated with the parameters estimated by globally fitting all the data points in Table II (n = 184) with Mechanism V, or the data points in bold type (n = 107) with Mechanism I, II, III, or IV.Table IIEstimated oxygen exchange parameters[Pi]o[Mg2+]ovex ± S.D.Pc ± S.D.nmMmicroatom min-1 mg-11.11.10.071 ± 0.0030.05 ± 0.0221.22.20.15 ± 0.010.019 ± 0.00421.65.60.280.0868 ± 0.000421.98.40.318 ± 0.0050.04 ± 0.0122.00.250.0360.08612.10.620.079 ± 0.0020.044 ± 0.00422.21.20.171 ± 0.0080.038 ± 0.00762.52.50.31 ± 0.030.02 ± 0.0162.73.70.40 ± 0.050.04 ± 0.0142.94.90.50 ± 0.020.025 ± 0.00843.10.270.0620.07813.20.680.137 ± 0.0040.041 ± 0.00426.20.58 ± 0.020.05 ± 0.0363.41.40.31 ± 0.030.038 ± 0.00543.72.70.56 ± 0.060.028 ± 0.00743.89.30.624 ± 0.0090.030 ± 0.00223.91.40.42 ± 0.020.06 ± 0.0324.10.290.090 ± 0.0040.088 ± 0.00224.10.77 ± 0.010.035 ± 0.00524.20.740.200.0371 ± 0.000824.32.80.72 ± 0.010.032 ± 0.00324.45.40.986 ± 0.0060.030 ± 0.0022120.89 ± 0.030.026 ± 0.00644.51.50.42 ± 0.010.0339 ± 0.000524.74.20.89 ± 0.020.028 ± 0.00224.86.81.0 ± 0.10.05 ± 0.0334.92.90.74 ± 0.020.017 ± 0.00425.10.320.116 ± 0.0050.073 ± 0.00225.25.61.2 ± 0.10.04 ± 0.0325.30.790.270.03315.5191.04 ± 0.030.029 ± 0.00745.61.60.55 ± 0.010.05 ± 0.0247.11.28 ± 0.070.033 ± 0.0062100.870.03416.23.20.91 ± 0.030.0754 ± 0.000126.47.41.1 ± 0.20.078 ± 0.00526.5141.60.03416.71.70.666 ± 0.0080.033 ± 0.0012251.23 ± 0.040.02 ± 0.0146.84.81.0 ± 0.10.078 ± 0.00227.43.41.09 ± 0.060.032 ± 0.00426.4bAll data, both normal and bold type, are plotted in Fig. 2 (n = 184).1.3 ± 0.10.084 ± 0.00327.5111.165 ± 0.0070.0337 ± 0.000627.97.91.36 ± 0.060.07 ± 0.0258.15.11.38 ± 0.040.031 ± 0.00428.3201.785 ± 0.0070.0305 ± 0.000428.86.81.58 ± 0.020.030 ± 0.00429.4121.455 ± 0.0070.034 ± 0.00329.58.51.72 ± 0.030.0317 ± 0.000429.7211.90.0321100.440.296 ± 0.0080.0599 ± 0.00012271.90.0401111.10.65 ± 0.010.036 ± 0.00822.21.19 ± 0.070.030 ± 0.0084161.8 ± 0.10.082 ± 0.0062124.41.71 ± 0.070.02 ± 0.01413172.20 ± 0.050.032 ± 0.0012146.51.90.0381241.98 ± 0.020.0773 ± 0.00012150.550.47 ± 0.030.060 ± 0.00128.71.8 ± 0.20.04 ± 0.012161.40.970.0241112.02 ± 0.040.06 ± 0.023172.81.70 ± 0.040.030 ± 0.0032262.13 ± 0.070.037 ± 0.0032321.9 ± 0.20.076 ± 0.0042195.52.20.0041162.21 ± 0.040.0335 ± 0.00042200.670.62 ± 0.030.058 ± 0.0022342.075 ± 0.0070.0352 ± 0.00012211.71.30 ± 0.010.027 ± 0.0032223.42.20.0261222.10 ± 0.010.035 ± 0.001224142.6 ± 0.30.071 ± 0.0012256.72.70.046128212.28 ± 0.040.032 ± 0.0012332.12 ± 0.020.0398 ± 0.0001232172.80.068134442.0 ± 0.10.040 ± 0.004238252.44 ± 0.080.0349 ± 0.00022a Data in bold type are plotted in Fig. 3 (n = 107).b All data, both normal and bold type, are plotted in Fig. 2 (n = 184).

Dash-dot-dot lines are used to represent the superposition of two regression lines, because the calculated lines for Mechanisms I and II and for Mechanisms III and IV were visually indistinguishable.

Table III summarizes the parameter estimates for Mechanisms I–V. Values obtained by fitting the data in Figs. 2 or 3 with the equations in Table I (regression coefficients) are shown in bold type. Values in normal type were calculated either from two regression coefficients (Mechanism IV), or from the regression coefficient containing the intrinsic substrate (S) dissociation constant (KS) and an independent estimate of the equilibrium constant between covalently and noncovalently bound Pi (Mechanisms I, II, III, and V). In the ordered binding mechanisms (II, III, and V), KS/(1 + Kh) is the half-maximal substrate concentration when the cofactor sites are filled (e.g. [Mg2+] > KM in III and V). The standard error of the parameter estimate is reported when p < 0.0001 and omitted when p > 0.8 (S.E.E. > 100%). Column 11 contains one measure of “goodness of fit,” namely the multiple correlation coefficient (28Glantz S.A. Slinker B.K. Primer of Applied Regression and Analysis of Variance. McGraw-Hill, New York1990: 50-104Google Scholar) adjusted for the number of degrees of freedom (Radj). Two other criteria for choosing between alternative mechanisms are shown in Fig. 4. The residuals (circles) between the measured and calculated (solid black line) values of the dependent variable (vex) are plotted, along with the standard error of the estimate (gray dashed lines) for each mechanism. The standard error of the estimate is the square root of the “average” (division by n minus the number of parameters, i.e. the number of degrees of freedom) squared deviation of the data about the regression surface. Two-thirds of the measurements fall within the envelope formed by the dashed lines. The data were also analyzed with Mechanism III assuming that the true substrate is the monoprotonated form of Pi(HPO4−2), the diprotonated form of Pi(H2PO4−1), or the sum of the monoprotonated and diprotonated forms of Pi instead of the sum of all the protonation states. The free concentrations of the fully protonated (H3PO4) and completely unprotonated (PO4−.3) forms of Pi were both negligible. T"
