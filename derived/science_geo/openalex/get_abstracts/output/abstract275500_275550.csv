https://openalex.org/W1572375488,"Climate is not the same from one decade to the next, but as Cane and Evans explain in their Perspective, the mechanisms and even the patterns of decadal climate change are not well understood. The proxy climate record reported by Linsley et al. is an example of the kind of highly resolved records required from across the world to understand climate on these time scales."

https://openalex.org/W1537417080,"Climate change mitigation strategies have focused on reductions in carbon dioxide and other long-lived greenhouse gases. Smith et al., investigate the viability of a different strategy, recently proposed by Hansen et al., which focuses on controlling short-lived pollutants such as soot and tropospheric ozone. They conclude that carbon dioxide must remain the primary focus of climate change mitigation strategies."

https://openalex.org/W1832712973,Europe is in a growth phase--growing in size as several countries are negotiating to join the European Union (EU) and growing in maturity as its institutions evolve to meet better the needs of its citizens. One aspect of this maturation is the realization that the EU structures to support science have failed in many respects and need a drastic overhaul. The European Life Scientists Organization (ELSO) was created last year to pull together molecular life scientists into a coherent body that can work toward improving conditions for research in Europe.

The plateau has less than a 4% rise per hundred volts from 1350 to 1550 volts. In this laboratory, the background of the counter shielded with 2 in. of lead is 28 cpm at 1375 volts. A 10-mg sample of barium carbonate containing 0.0005 [tc of C14 spread on a 10-cm2 surface, gave a counting rate of 564 epm (uncorrected) at 1375 volts. The sensitive area available on the sample holder is 20 cm2. The counting gas is inexpensive and readily available. The counter is simple to construct or may be obtained commercially.2 The time required for replacing"

[1454][1]). A National Research Council committee “suggests tapping a talent pool that is relatively underrepresented among teachers [to teach K-12]: newly minted Ph.D.'s.”

I am a newly minted Ph.D. (October 2000) teaching high school. I find my extensive education in science to be a benefit in teaching my advanced-placement classes, but not so in teaching my standard classes. Teaching the latter challenges not my depth of knowledge, but my skills in interacting with adolescents. This is a different field from the one for which I pursued my degree. I also find the lack of time available for professional development as a scientist to be greatly limiting. A Ph.D. in science is trained to pursue research. These skills are not exercised in the general high school experience.

Using science Ph.D.'s to teach general high school classes is a misappropriation of resources. Assigning them to teach advanced classes or to serve as advisors for curriculum development and research projects would be a more efficient use of resources, and this should be accompanied by the opportunity for such individuals to pursue professional development to prevent their dissatisfaction.
