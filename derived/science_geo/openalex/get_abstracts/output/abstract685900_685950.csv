https://openalex.org/W4200513667,"Importance COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy has become a leading barrier to increasing the US vaccination rate. Objective To evaluate time trends in COVID-19 vaccine intent during the US vaccine rollout, and identify key factors related to and self-reported reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in May 2021. Design, participants and setting A COVID-19 survey was offered to US adult Facebook users in several languages yielding 5,088,772 qualifying responses from January 6 to May 31, 2021. Data was aggregated by month. Survey weights matched the sample to the age, gender, and state profile of the US population. Exposure Demographics, geographic factors, political/COVID-19 environment, health status, beliefs, and behaviors. Main outcome measures “If a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 were offered to you today, would you choose to get vaccinated.” Hesitant was defined as responding probably or definitely would not choose to get vaccinated (versus probably or definitely would, or already vaccinated). Results COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy decreased by one-third from 25.4% (95%CI, 25.3, 25.5) in January to 16.6% (95% CI, 16.4, 16.7) in May, with relatively large decreases among participants with Black, Pacific Islander or Hispanic race/ethnicity and ≤high school education. Independent risk factors for vaccine hesitancy in May (N = 525,644) included younger age, non-Asian race, &lt; 4 year college degree, living in a more rural county, living in a county with higher Trump vote share in the 2020 election, lack of worry about COVID-19, working outside the home, never intentionally avoiding contact with others, and no past-year flu vaccine. Differences in hesitancy by race/ethnicity varied by age (e.g., Black adults more hesitant than White adults &lt;35 years old, but less hesitant among adults ≥45 years old). Differences in hesitancy by age varied by race/ethnicity. Almost half of vaccine hesitant respondents reported fear of side effects (49.2% [95%CI, 48.7, 49.7]) and not trusting the COVID-19 vaccine (48.4% [95%CI, 48.0, 48.9]); over one-third reported not trusting the government, not needing the vaccine, and waiting to see if safe. Reasons differed by degree of vaccine intent and by race/ethnicity. Conclusion COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy varied by demographics, geography, beliefs, and behaviors, indicating a need for a range of messaging and policy options to target high-hesitancy groups."
https://openalex.org/W4200469626,"Mutations in the protein kinase PINK1 lead to defects in mitophagy and cause autosomal recessive early onset Parkinson's disease1,2. PINK1 has many unique features that enable it to phosphorylate ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like domain of Parkin3-9. Structural analysis of PINK1 from diverse insect species10-12 with and without ubiquitin provided snapshots of distinct structural states yet did not explain how PINK1 is activated. Here we elucidate the activation mechanism of PINK1 using crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). A crystal structure of unphosphorylated Pediculus humanus corporis (Ph; human body louse) PINK1 resolves an N-terminal helix, revealing the orientation of unphosphorylated yet active PINK1 on the mitochondria. We further provide a cryo-EM structure of a symmetric PhPINK1 dimer trapped during the process of trans-autophosphorylation, as well as a cryo-EM structure of phosphorylated PhPINK1 undergoing a conformational change to an active ubiquitin kinase state. Structures and phosphorylation studies further identify a role for regulatory PINK1 oxidation. Together, our research delineates the complete activation mechanism of PINK1, illuminates how PINK1 interacts with the mitochondrial outer membrane and reveals how PINK1 activity may be modulated by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species."
https://openalex.org/W4200550781,"The neural basis of abnormal social behavior in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) remains incompletely understood. Here we used two complementary but independent brain-wide mapping approaches, mouse resting-state fMRI and c-Fos-iDISCO+ imaging, to construct brain-wide activity and connectivity maps of the Cntnap2 knockout (KO) mouse model of ASD. At the macroscale level, we detected reduced functional coupling across social brain regions despite general patterns of hyperconnectivity across major brain structures. Oxytocin administration, which rescues social deficits in KO mice, strongly stimulated many brain areas and normalized connectivity patterns. Notably, chemogenetically triggered release of endogenous oxytocin strongly stimulated the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a forebrain nucleus implicated in social reward. Furthermore, NAc-targeted approaches to activate local oxytocin receptors sufficiently rescued their social deficits. Our findings establish circuit- and systems-level mechanisms of social deficits in Cntnap2 KO mice and reveal the NAc as a region that can be modulated by oxytocin to promote social interactions."

https://openalex.org/W4200442831,"Elimination of the binding of immunoglobulin Fc to Fc gamma receptors (FcγR) is highly desirable for the avoidance of unwanted inflammatory responses to therapeutic antibodies and fusion proteins. Many different approaches have been described in the literature but none of them completely eliminates binding to all of the Fcγ receptors. Here we describe a set of novel variants having specific amino acid substitutions in the Fc region at L234 and L235 combined with the substitution G236R. They show no detectable binding to Fcγ receptors or to C1q, are inactive in functional cell-based assays and do not elicit inflammatory cytokine responses. Meanwhile, binding to FcRn, manufacturability, stability and potential for immunogenicity are unaffected. These variants have the potential to improve the safety and efficacy of therapeutic antibodies and Fc fusion proteins."
https://openalex.org/W4200120687,"Mortality rates of pregnant and postpartum women grew in the second COVID-19 pandemic year. Our objective is to understand this phenomenon to avoid further deaths.We collected data from SIVEP-Gripe, a nationwide Brazilian database containing surveillance data on all severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by COVID-19, between the first notified case (February 2020) until the 17th epidemiological week of 2021. We stratified patients into maternal women (which includes pregnant and postpartum women), non-maternal women and men and divided them by time of diagnosis in two periods: first period (February to December 2020) and second period (the first 17 epidemiological weeks of 2021 before pregnant and postpartum women were vaccinated).During the second period, all patients had higher risk of presenting severe COVID-19 cases, but the maternal population was at a higher risk of death (OR of 2.60 CI 95%: 2.28-2.97)-almost double the risk of the two other groups. Maternal women also had a higher risk of needing intensive care, intubation and of presenting desaturation in the second period. Importantly, maternal women presented fewer comorbidities than other patient groups, suggesting that pregnancy and postpartum can be an important risk factor associated with severe COVID-19.Our results suggest that the Gama variant, which has been related to greater virulence, transmissibility and mortality rates leads to more severe cases of COVID-19 for pregnant and postpartum women."
https://openalex.org/W4200486982,"Self-grooming is a complex behavior with important biological functions and pathological relevance. How the brain coordinates with the spinal cord to generate the repetitive movements of self-grooming remains largely unknown. Here, we report that in the caudal part of the spinal trigeminal nucleus (Sp5C), neurons that express Cerebellin-2 (Cbln2+) form a neural circuit to the cervical spinal cord to maintain repetitive orofacial self-grooming. Inactivation of Cbln2+ Sp5C neurons blocked both sensory-evoked and stress-induced repetitive orofacial self-grooming. Activation of these neurons triggered short-latency repetitive forelimb movements that resembled orofacial self-grooming. The Cbln2+ Sp5C neurons were monosynaptically innervated by both somatosensory neurons in the trigeminal ganglion and paraventricular hypothalamic neurons. Among the divergent projections of Cbln2+ Sp5C neurons, a descending pathway that innervated motor neurons and interneurons in the cervical spinal cord was necessary and sufficient for repetitive orofacial self-grooming. These data reveal a brain-to-spinal sensorimotor loop for repetitive self-grooming in mice."
https://openalex.org/W4200128602,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are an indispensable element of post-transcriptional gene regulation, influencing a variety of biological processes including myogenic differentiation; however, little is known about the function of circRNA in goat myogenic differentiation. Using RNA-sequencing data from our laboratory, we explored the influences of circUSP13, as a candidate circRNA, on myoblast differentiation since its expression is higher in myoblasts of lamb (first day of age) than that of the fetus (75th day of pregnancy). In in vitro experiments, circUSP13 significantly promoted differentiation and inhibited apoptosis in goat primary myoblasts. Mechanistically, circUSP13 localized with miR-29c in the cytoplasm of goat myoblasts to regulate IGF1 expression. We further demonstrated that circUSP13 sponges miR-29c, promoting IGF1 expression that upregulated the expression of MyoG and MyHC. Thus, our results identified circUSP13 as a molecular marker for breeding programs of mutton production, as well as the circUSP13-miR-29c-IGF1 axis as a potential therapeutic target for combating muscle wasting."
https://openalex.org/W4200234993,"The present online study surveyed drivers of SAE Level 2 partially automated cars on automation use and attitudes towards automation. Respondents reported high levels of trust in their partially automated cars to maintain speed and distance to the car ahead (M = 4.41), and to feel safe most of the time (M = 4.22) on a scale from 1 to 5. Respondents indicated to always know when the car is in partially automated driving mode (M = 4.42), and to monitor the performance of their car most of the time (M = 4.34). A low rating was obtained for engaging in other activities while driving the partially automated car (M = 2.27). Partial automation did, however, increase reported engagement in secondary tasks that are already performed during manual driving (i.e., the proportion of respondents reporting to observe the landscape, use the phone for texting, navigation, music selection and calls, and eat during partially automated driving was higher in comparison to manual driving). Unsafe behaviour was rare with 1% of respondents indicating to rarely monitor the road, and another 1% to sleep during partially automated driving. Structural equation modeling revealed a strong, positive relationship between perceived safety and trust (β = 0.69, p = 0.001). Performance expectancy had the strongest effects on automation use, followed by driver engagement, trust, and non-driving related task engagement. Perceived safety interacted with automation use through trust. We recommend future research to evaluate the development of perceived safety and trust in time, and revisit the influence of driver engagement and non-driving related task engagement, which emerged as new constructs related to trust in partial automation."
https://openalex.org/W4200315554,"Direct control of protein interactions by chemically induced protein proximity holds great potential for both cell and synthetic biology as well as therapeutic applications. Low toxicity, orthogonality and excellent cell permeability are important criteria for chemical inducers of proximity (CIPs), in particular for in vivo applications. Here, we present the use of the agrochemical mandipropamid (Mandi) as a highly efficient CIP in cell culture systems and living organisms. Mandi specifically induces complex formation between a sixfold mutant of the plant hormone receptor pyrabactin resistance 1 (PYR1) and abscisic acid insensitive (ABI). It is orthogonal to other plant hormone-based CIPs and rapamycin-based CIP systems. We demonstrate the applicability of the Mandi system for rapid and efficient protein translocation in mammalian cells and zebrafish embryos, protein network shuttling and manipulation of endogenous proteins."
https://openalex.org/W4200004545,"In the past year, the global epidemic situation is still not optimistic, showing a trend of continuous expansion. With the research and application of vaccines, there is an urgent need to develop some optimal vaccination strategies. How to make a reasonable vaccination strategy to determine the priority of vaccination under the limited vaccine resources to control the epidemic and reduce human casualties? We build a dynamic model with vaccination which is extended the classical SEIR model. By fitting the epidemic data of three countries-China, Brazil, Indonesia, we have evaluated age-specific vaccination strategy for the number of infections and deaths. Furthermore, we have evaluated the impact of age-specific vaccination strategies on the number of the basic reproduction number. At last, we also have evaluated the different age structure of the vaccination priority. It shows that giving priority to vaccination of young people can control the number of infections, while giving priority to vaccination of the elderly can greatly reduce the number of deaths in most cases. Furthermore, we have found that young people should be mainly vaccinated to reduce the number of infections. When the emphasis is on reducing the number of deaths, it is important to focus vaccination on the elderly. Simulations suggest that appropriate age-specific vaccination strategies can effectively control the epidemic, both in terms of the number of infections and deaths."
https://openalex.org/W4200018276,"Despite decades of research, much uncertainty remains regarding the selection pressures responsible for brain size variation. Whilst the influential social brain hypothesis once garnered extensive support, more recent studies have failed to find support for a link between brain size and sociality. Instead, it appears there is now substantial evidence suggesting ecology better predicts brain size in both primates and carnivores. Here, different models of brain evolution were tested, and the relative importance of social, ecological, and life-history traits were assessed on both overall encephalisation and specific brain regions. In primates, evidence is found for consistent associations between brain size and ecological factors, particularly diet; however, evidence was also found advocating sociality as a selection pressure driving brain size. In carnivores, evidence suggests ecological variables, most notably home range size, are influencing brain size; whereas, no support is found for the social brain hypothesis, perhaps reflecting the fact sociality appears to be limited to a select few taxa. Life-history associations reveal complex selection mechanisms to be counterbalancing the costs associated with expensive brain tissue through extended developmental periods, reduced fertility, and extended maximum lifespan. Future studies should give careful consideration of the methods chosen for measuring brain size, investigate both whole brain and specific brain regions where possible, and look to integrate multiple variables, thus fully capturing all of the potential factors influencing brain size."
https://openalex.org/W4200372988,"Reproductive coercion and abuse is a major public health issue, with significant effects on the health and well-being of women. Reproductive coercion and abuse includes any form of behaviour that intentionally controls another person's reproductive choices. The aim of this qualitative evidence synthesis is to explore women's experiences of reproductive coercion and abuse globally, to broaden understanding of the different ways reproductive coercion and abuse is perpetrated, perceived and experienced across settings and socio-cultural contexts.We searched Medline, CINAHL and Embase for eligible studies from inception to 25th February 2021. Primary studies with a qualitative study design that focused on the experiences and perceptions of women who have encountered reproductive coercion and abuse were eligible for inclusion. Titles and abstracts, and full texts were screened by independent reviewers. We extracted data from included studies using a form designed for this synthesis and assessed methodological limitations using CASP. We used Thomas and Harden's thematic analysis approach to analyse and synthesise the evidence, and the GRADE-CERQual approach to assess confidence in review findings.We included 33 studies from twelve countries in South Asia, the Asia Pacific, North America, South America, Africa and Europe. Most studies used in-depth interviews and focus group discussions to discuss women's experiences of reproductive coercion and abuse. Reproductive coercion and abuse manifested in a range of behaviours including control of pregnancy outcome, pregnancy pressure or contraceptive sabotage. There were a range of reasons cited for reproductive coercion and abuse, including control of women, rigid gender roles, social inequalities and family pressure. Women's different responses to reproductive coercion and abuse included using covert contraception and feelings of distress, anger and trauma. Across contexts, perpetration and experiences of reproductive coercion and abuse were influenced by different factors including son preferences and social exclusion.We reflect on the importance of socio-cultural factors in understanding the phenomenon of reproductive coercion and abuse and how it affects women, as well as how the mechanisms of power and control at both individual and societal levels work to perpetuate the incidence of reproductive coercion and abuse against women."
https://openalex.org/W4226375179,"Neurons in primate lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) play a critical role in working memory (WM) and cognitive strategies. Consistent with adaptive coding models, responses of these neurons are not fixed but flexibly adjust on the basis of cognitive demands. However, little is known about how these adjustments affect population codes. Here, we investigated ensemble coding in LPFC while monkeys implemented different strategies in a WM task. Although single neurons were less tuned when monkeys used more stereotyped strategies, task information could still be accurately decoded from neural populations. This was due to changes in population codes that distributed information among a greater number of neurons, each contributing less to the overall population. Moreover, this shift occurred for task-relevant, but not irrelevant, information. These results demonstrate that cognitive strategies that impose structure on information held in mind rearrange population codes in LPFC, such that information becomes more distributed among neurons in an ensemble."
https://openalex.org/W4200389874,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tubular epithelial cells is a hallmark of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis and is associated with chronic renal injury as well as acute renal injury. As one of the incidences and risk factors for acute renal injury, increasing the osmolality in the proximal tubular fluid by administration of intravenous mannitol has been reported, but the detailed mechanisms remain unclear. Hyperosmotic conditions caused by mannitol in the tubular tissue may generate not only osmotic but also mechanical stresses, which are known to be able to induce EMT in epithelial cells, thereby contributing to renal injury. Herein, we investigate the effect of hyperosmolarity on EMT in tubular epithelial cells. Normal rat kidney (NRK)-52E cells were exposed to mannitol-induced hyperosmotic stress. Consequently, the hyperosmotic stress led to a reduced expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and an enhanced expression of the mesenchymal marker, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), which indicates an initiation of EMT in NKR-52E cells. The hyperosmotic condition also induced time-dependent disassembly and rearrangements of focal adhesions (FAs) concomitant with changes in actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, prevention of FAs rearrangements by cotreatment with Y-27632, a Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor, could abolish the effects of hyperosmotic mannitol treatment, thus attenuating the expression of α-SMA to the level in nontreated cells. These results suggest that hyperosmotic stress may induce EMT through FAs rearrangement in proximal tubular epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W4200593045,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to radical changes in social distancing awareness and affected social relationships. Owing to large-scale lockdown, home quarantine and social distancing requirements, it was anticipated that sexual activities would be severely impacted. However, retrospective self-report studies showed that pornography use and autoerotism increased during the pandemic.This study used big-data databases available on the Internet to investigate factors that modulated pornography use during the pandemic.Daily relative search volume (RSV) data from Google Trends for the period from 24 February 2020 to 13 July 2020 were extracted. Pornhub traffic data were extracted from the Pornhub Insights website, for the period from 24 February 2020 to 13 July 2020. The parameter was defined as 'percent change in traffic compared to an average day in 2019'. The number of daily new cases of COVID-19 was extracted from the database on Our World in Data.The normality of the data was examined using the Shapiro-Wilk test. All variables included in this study were non-normally distributed. Therefore, non-parametric tests or parametric tests with bootstrapping were adopted where appropriate.According to Google Trends, the RSV for 'pornography' increased after late March 2020, which is close to the date when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. The number of daily new cases of COVID-19 was positively correlated with the traffic of Pornhub, a popular pornography website, and the RSV for 'pornography'. Moderation analysis demonstrated a significant main effect of daily new cases of COVID-19 and the RSV for 'social distancing' in predicting Pornhub traffic/RSV for 'pornography'. Furthermore, the RSV for 'social distancing' significantly moderated the relationship between daily new cases and Pornhub traffic/RSV for 'pornography'. A stronger COVID-pornography use association was observed with increased social distancing awareness.Increased pornography consumption during the pandemic was observed, and it was associated with the severity of the pandemic. Social distancing awareness could be a key factor influencing interest in and use of pornography. Further studies on the changes in sexual desire and birth-rate control are worthwhile because long-term public health may be affected by the changes in sexual behaviour during the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4200508024,"Hypertrophic/dilated cardiomyopathy, often a prequel to heart failure, is accompanied by maladaptive transcriptional changes that contribute to arrythmias and contractile misfunction. Transgenic mice constitutively expressing high levels of calcineurin are known to develop extreme heart hypertrophy, which progresses to dilated cardiomyopathy, and to die several weeks after birth. Here, we characterized aberrant transcriptional and epigenetic pathways in this mouse model and established a pharmacological approach to treat established cardiomyopathy. We found that H3K4me3 (trimethyl histone 3 lysine 4) and H3K9me3 (trimethyl histone 3 lysine 9) Jumonji histone demethylases are markedly increased at the protein level and show enhanced enzymatic activity in diseased hearts. These epigenetic regulators continued to increase with time, further affecting cardiac gene expression. Our findings parallel the lower H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 levels seen in human patients. Inhibition of Jumonji demethylase activities in vivo results in lower histone demethylase enzymatic function in the heart and higher histone methylation levels and leads to partial reduction of heart size, reversal of maladaptive transcriptional programs, improved heart function, and prolonged survival. At the molecular level, target genes of transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 are specifically regulated in response to pharmacological or genetic inhibition of Jumonji demethylases. Similar transcriptional reversal of disease-associated genes is seen in a second disease model based on cardiac mechanical overload. Our findings validate pharmacological inhibitors of Jumonji demethylases as potential therapeutics for the treatment of cardiomyopathies across disease models and provide evidence of the reversal of maladaptive transcriptional reprogramming leading to partial restoration of cardiac function. In addition, this study defines pathways of therapeutic resistance upregulated with disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W4200526108,"This research examines the entrepreneurship gender gap by offering an additional novel explanation for the higher share of men in entrepreneurial activity focusing on intergenerational parental role. Participants (N = 1288) aged 18-81, including 259 actual entrepreneurs, completed questionnaires about entrepreneurship tendency, personality traits and socioeconomic background. The gender gap in actual entrepreneurship continues a significant difference in entrepreneurial tendency, which is developed in the first and the second stages of the entrepreneurial trajectory. When women reach the third stage of entrepreneurial development, the execution stage, they have already acquired a self-perception of an incapable and incommensurate entrepreneurial personality. The results indicate that role modeling behavioral channel significantly accounts for the gender gap in entrepreneurial personality. The results suggest that both parents contribute to women's' inferior perception of entrepreneurial personality and that their contribution affects all four aspects of the entrepreneurial tendency. It appears that the impact of fathers' role modeling is larger than that of mothers, and furthermore fathers transfer other entrepreneurial role models from their side in the family."
https://openalex.org/W4200088714,"Any multicellular organism during its life is involved in relatively stable interactions with microorganisms. The organism and its microbiome make up a holobiont, possessing a unique set of characteristics and evolving as a whole system. This study aimed to evaluate the degree of the conservativeness of microbiomes associated with intertidal gastropods. We studied the composition and the geographic and phylogenetic variability of the gut and body surface microbiomes of five closely related sympatric Littorina (Neritrema) spp. and a more distant species, L. littorea, from the sister subgenus Littorina (Littorina). Although snail-associated microbiomes included many lineages (207-603), they were dominated by a small number of OTUs of the genera Psychromonas, Vibrio, and Psychrilyobacter. The geographic variability was greater than the interspecific differences at the same collection site. While the microbiomes of the six Littorina spp. did not differ at the high taxonomic level, the OTU composition differed between groups of cryptic species and subgenera. A few species-specific OTUs were detected within the collection sites; notably, such OTUs never dominated microbiomes. We conclude that the composition of the high-rank taxa of the associated microbiome (""scaffolding enterotype"") is more evolutionarily conserved than the composition of the low-rank individual OTUs, which may be site- and / or species-specific."
https://openalex.org/W4200250134,"This study is to explore the correlation between the contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) characteristics of breast cancer and the epithelial-mesenchyme transformation (EMT).Totally 119 patients of breast cancer underwent CEUS. Tissues in the active area were collected and subjected to the immunohistochemical detection, PT-PCR and Western blot. Correlation analysis was conducted between the clinical pathological parameters and the CEUS indicators.The expression levels of CD44, N-cadherin, and β-catenin in breast cancer tissues were higher than those in adjacent tissues (P<0.05). However, the expression levels of CD24 and E-cadherin in breast cancer tissues were lower than those in adjacent tissues (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in E-cadherin mRNA and Vimentin levels between cancer and adjacent tissues (P>0.05). The expressions were up-regulated in the CSCs, with higher histological grade, lymph node metastasis, and negative estrogen receptor (ER) expression. Smaller breast tumors, with no lymph node metastasis, lower clinical stage, and positive ER expression, tended to exhibit the up-regulated epithelial phenotype. Breast tumors, with high histological grade, lymph node metastasis, high clinical staging grade, and negative ER expression, tended to exhibit the up-regulated interstitial phenotype. The peak intensity of the time-intensity curve (TIC) for the CEUS was positively correlated with the CSC marker CD44 and the interstitial phenotype marker N-cadherin. The starting time of enhancement was negatively correlated with the N-cadherin. Area under the curve was positively correlated with the expression of CD44 and N-cadherin, while negatively correlated with the epithelial phenotype marker β-catenin. The time to peak was negatively correlated with the interstitial phenotypes Vimentin and N-cadherin, with no correlation with the E-cadherin or β-catenin.Breast cancers show the enlarged lesions after enlargement and perfusion defect for the CEUS. The fast-in pattern, high enhancement, and high perfusion in the TIC are correlated with the CSCs and EMT expressions, suggesting poor disease prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W4200461827,"Models of attention demonstrated the existence of top-down, bottom-up, and history-driven attentional mechanisms, controlled by partially segregated networks of brain areas. However, few studies have examined the specific deficits in those attentional mechanisms in intellectual disability within the same experimental setting. The aim of the current study was to specify the attentional deficits in intellectual disability in top-down, bottom-up, and history-driven processing of multisensory stimuli, and gain insight into effective attentional cues that could be utilized in cognitive training programs for intellectual disability. The performance of adults with mild to moderate intellectual disability (n = 20) was compared with that of typically developing controls (n = 20) in a virtual reality visual search task. The type of a spatial cue that could aid search performance was manipulated to be either endogenous or exogenous in different sensory modalities (visual, auditory, tactile). The results identified that attentional deficits in intellectual disability are overall more pronounced in top-down rather than in bottom-up processing, but with different magnitudes across cue types: The auditory or tactile endogenous cues were much less effective than the visual endogenous cue in the intellectual disability group. Moreover, the history-driven processing in intellectual disability was altered, such that a reversed priming effect was observed for immediate repetitions of the same cue type. These results suggest that the impact of intellectual disability on attentional processing is specific to attentional mechanisms and cue types, which has theoretical as well as practical implications for developing effective cognitive training programs for the target population."
https://openalex.org/W4225579704,"Variation in the neural code contributes to making each individual unique. We probed neural code variation using ∼100 population recordings from major ganglion cell types in the macaque retina, combined with an interpretable computational representation of individual variability. This representation captured variation and covariation in properties such as nonlinearity, temporal dynamics, and spatial receptive field size and preserved invariances such as asymmetries between On and Off cells. The covariation of response properties in different cell types was associated with the proximity of lamination of their synaptic input. Surprisingly, male retinas exhibited higher firing rates and faster temporal integration than female retinas. Exploiting data from previously recorded retinas enabled efficient characterization of a new macaque retina, and of a human retina. Simulations indicated that combining a large dataset of retinal recordings with behavioral feedback could reveal the neural code in a living human and thus improve vision restoration with retinal implants."

Coverage evaluation surveys (CES) were conducted post-treatment, and the resultant survey coverage was compared to reported administrative coverage. This provided a secondary confirmation of the Geshiyaro project coverages, and is used to monitor the success of each Mass Drug Administration (MDA) round.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in 13 woredas (districts) of the Wolaita Zone. All eligible individuals from the selected households were invited for an interview. The study design, sample size, analysis and report writing were conducted according to the World Health Organization (WHO) CES guidelines for PC.The study interviewed a total of 3,568 households and 18,875 individuals across 13 woredas in the Wolaita Zone. Overall, the survey coverage across all studied woredas was 81.5% (95% CI; 80.9-82.0%) for both ALB and PZQ. Reported administrative coverage across all studied woredas was higher than survey coverage, 92.7% and 91.2% for ALB and PZQ, respectively. A significant portion of individuals (17.6%) were not offered PC. The predominant reason for not achieving the target coverage of 90% was beneficiary absenteeism during MDA (6.6% ALB, 6.8% PZQ), followed by drug distributors failing to reach all households (4.7% ALB, 4.8% PZQ), and beneficiaries not informed of the program (1.3% ALB, 1.7% PZQ).Programmatic actions will need to be taken during the next MDA campaign to achieve the targeted Geshiyaro project coverage threshold across data collection and program engagement. Adequate training and supervision on recording and reporting administrative coverage should be provided, alongside improved social mobilization of treated communities to increase participation, and strengthened institutional partnerships and communication."
https://openalex.org/W4200473596,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systematic vasculitis that occurs predominantly in young children, and is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children younger than five-years-old in developed countries. Although the etiology of KD is unknown, it is believed to be an inflammatory disease resulting from abnormal immune responses to possible environmental or infectious stimuli in genetically predisposed individuals. Breast milk contains numerous anti-inflammatory factors which may protect against allergic and autoimmune diseases. In this study we tried to examine the effect of breastfeeding for 6 months or more on disease outcomes in patients with Kawasaki disease.A retrospective cohort study of 249 KD patients admitted from 1999- 2013 who were older than 6 months at time of diagnosis and had data regarding breastfeeding in the first 6 months of life. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data was collected by chart review. Continuous data was compared using Student's t-test and categorical variables were compared using Chi-square. Stepwise multivariate regression of all demographic factors was performed.Breastfeeding for 6 months or more was associated with a shorter total duration of fever (5.980± 1.405 Vs. 6.910 ± 2.573 days, p = 0.001) and a lower risk of developing persistent coronary artery lesions (CALs) (7.8% Vs. 20.2%, p-value = 0.039) on univariate analysis. Multivariate regression of all factors associated with CALs including breastfeeding for 6 months found that only the presence of CALs at baseline (β-coefficient = 0.065, p < 0.001) and white blood count (β-coefficient = 0.065, p = 0.018) remained significant after regression analysis.Breastfeeding for 6 months or more was associated with a shorter duration of fever and a lower risk of persistent CAL formation in patients with KD on univariate analysis, although this effect may be modest when other factors such as the presence of CALs at baseline and white blood cell count are also taken into consideration."

A pectinase gene encoding endo-polygalacturonase (endo-PGase) enzyme was isolated from Pectobacterium carotovorum a plant pathogenic strain of bacteria and successfully cloned into a secretion vector pHT43 having σA-dependent promoter for heterologous expression in Bacillus subtilis (WB800N).The desired PCR product was 1209bp which encoded an open reading frame of 402 amino acids. Recombinant proteins showed an estimated molecular weight of 48 kDa confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. Transformed B. subtilis competent cells harbouring the engineered pHT43 vector with the foreign endo-PGase gene were cultured in 2X-yeast extract tryptone medium and subsequently screened for enzyme activity at various temperatures and pH ranges. Optimal activity of recombinant endo-PGase was found at 40°C and pH 5.0. To assay the catalytic effect of metal ions, the recombinant enzyme was incubated with 1 mM concentration of various metal ions. Potassium chloride increased the enzyme activity while EDTA, Zn++ and Ca++, strongly inhibited the activity. The chromatographic analysis of enzymatic hydrolysates of polygalacturonic acid (PGA) and pectin substrates using HPLC and TLC revealed tri and tetra-galacturonates as the end products of recombinant endo-PGase hydrolysis. Conclusively, endo-PGase gene from the plant pathogenic strain was successfully expressed in Bacillus subtilis for the first time using pHT43 expression vector and could be assessed for enzyme production using a very simple medium with IPTG induction. These findings proposed that the Bacillus expression system might be safer to escape endotoxins for commercial enzyme production as compared to yeast and fungi. Additionally, the hydrolysis products generated by the recombinant endo-PGase activity offer their useful applications in food and beverage industry for quality products."
https://openalex.org/W4200070897,"Interaction of Clostridioides difficile spores with the intestinal mucosa contributes to the persistence and recurrence of the infection. Advanced age is one of the main risk factors for C. difficile infection and recurrence of the disease. However, interaction of C. difficile spores with the intestinal mucosa during aging has not been evaluated. In the present work, using intestinal ligated loop technique in a mouse model, we analyzed C. difficile spore adherence and internalization to the ileum and colonic mucosa during aging. Additionally, we provide visual documentation of the critical steps of the procedure. Consequently, our data suggest that spore internalization in the ileum and colonic mucosa is higher in elderly mice rather than adults or young mice. Also, our data suggest that spore adherence to the ileum and colonic mucosa decreases with aging."
https://openalex.org/W4200083425,"The ribosomal RNA 5.8S is one of the four rRNAs that constitute ribosomes. In human cells, like in all eukaryotes, it derives from the extensive processing of a long precursor containing the sequence of 18S, 5.8S and 28S rRNAs. It has been confirmed also in human cells the presence of three isoforms of 5.8S rRNA: one more abundant called 5.8S short, one called 5.8S long bearing 5 extra-nucleotides at its 5' end and one 10 nucleotide shorter called 5.8S cropped. So far, little is known about 5.8S long specific role in cell biology and its function in human pathology. The lack of studies on the three 5.8S isoforms could be due to the techniques usually applied to study ribosome biogenesis, such as Northern blot with radioactively labelled probes, that require strict protective measures, and abundant and high-quality samples. To overcome this issue, we optimized a method that combines primer extension with a fluorescently labeled reverse primer designed on the 3' of 5.8S rRNA sequence and fragment analysis. The resulting electropherogram shows the peaks corresponding to the three isoforms of 5.8S rRNA. The estimation of the area underneath the peaks allows to directly quantify the isoforms and to express their relative abundance. The relative abundance of 5.8S long and 5.8S short remains constant using scalar dilution of RNA and in samples subjected to partial degradation. 5.8S cropped abundance varies significantly in lower concentrate RNA samples. This method allows to analyze rapidly and safely the abundance of 5.8S rRNA isoforms in samples that have been so far considered not suitable such as poorly concentrated samples, RNA derived from frozen tissue or unique samples."
https://openalex.org/W4200192106,"Research has reported that both men and women experience body dissatisfaction. Among other instruments, a widely used method to assess perceived body size and body dissatisfaction are figure rating scales. Although a variety of illustration methods (e.g., three-dimensional, or 3D, models and line-drawing models) have been used to create these figure rating scales, to date, they have not been directly compared to one another. Thus, in the first study, which includes 511 participants at a mean age of 46 years old (range: 20-70), the present research work aims to assess how the line-drawing and 3D model scales, representing different body illustration methods, relate to each other. Furthermore, the first study assesses the validity of the indication of body dissatisfaction measured using these figure rating scales by comparing them to body checking or scrutinizing behavior and body appreciation levels. The project's second study examines the two figure rating scales using objectively measured anthropometric data. In total, 239 participants at a mean age of 54 years (range: 18-94) were included. The results show that figure rating scales can be considered tools that measure perceptual body image due to their positive correlations with body checking behavior (for women) and their negative correlations with body appreciation. The 3D model and line-drawing scales show good to excellent inter-scale reliability, and both scales agree equally well with body mass index (BMI) measurements. Thus, the 3D model and line-drawing scales both seem well suited for assessing perceived body size and perceptual body dissatisfaction, suggesting that neither illustration method is superior to the other."
https://openalex.org/W4200214914,"Inhibiting formation or promoting degradation of α-synuclein aggregates are among the therapeutical approaches under investigation as disease-modifying treatment strategies for Parkinson's disease. To support these developments, several in vitro models based on seeded α-synuclein aggregation have been established in immortalized cell lines and murine primary neurons. Here, we report on a humanized model with a reproducibility and throughput that enables its use in supporting target identification and validation in pharmacological research. A human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line was genetically modified to express HA-tagged α-synuclein with the point mutation in position 53 from Alanine to Threonine (A53T) under an inducible system and differentiated into cortical neurons expressing neuronal markers and exhibiting spontaneous activity. Intracellular α-synuclein aggregation was triggered by exposure to exogenous added fibrillated recombinant wild-type human α-synuclein fibrils91 and demonstrated by several endpoints; the formation of Triton-insoluble SDS-soluble α-synuclein, biochemically in a fluorescence resonance energy transfer based aggregation assay and by immunocytochemistry of phosphorylated α-synuclein positive puncta. We demonstrate the feasibility of upscaling the iPSC neuron production for drug discovery and that the model has a suitable dynamic range allowing for both detection of increased and decreased α-synuclein aggregation. Moreover, gene modulation is feasible using siRNAs, making the model suitable for genetic screening for modulators of α-synuclein aggregation. Data on effects of USP8, USP13 and USP9X knockdown on α-synuclein expression and aggregation contradicts published data from immortalized cell lines and murine systems. This highlight the importance of including humanized neuronal models in the confirmation of biological mechanisms in specific variations of Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W4200253242,"Teaching about the nervous system has become a challenging task in secondary biology and science education because of the fast development in the field of neuroscience. A major challenge is to determine what content to teach. Curricula goals are often too general to guide instruction, and information about the nervous system has become overwhelming and diverse with ubiquitous relevance in society. In addition, several misconceptions and myths are circulating in educational communities causing world-wide confusion as to what content is correct. To help teachers, textbook authors, and curricula developers in this challenging landscape of knowledge, the aim of the present study is to identify the expert view on what knowledge is important for understanding the nervous system in the context of secondary biology and science education. To accomplish this, we have conducted a thematic content analysis of textbooks followed by a Delphi study of 15 experts in diverse but relevant fields. The results demonstrate six curriculum themes including gross anatomy and function, cell types and functional units, the nerve signal, connections between neurons, when nerve signals travel through networks of neurons, and plasticity in the nervous system, as well as 26 content principles organized in a coherent curriculum progression from general content to more specific content. Whereas some of the principles clarify and elaborate on traditional school biology knowledge, others add new knowledge to the curriculum. Importantly, the new framework for teaching about the nervous system presented here, meets the needs of society, as expressed by recent international policy frameworks of OECD and WHO, and it addresses common misconceptions about the brain. The study suggests an update of the biology and science curriculum."
https://openalex.org/W4200429754,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) affects a highly significant number of people and is responsible for the deaths of many people in sub-Saharan African countries alone. The best prevention method for this virus is through consistent condom utilization which can help to prevent drug-resistant HIV infection and acquisition of new infection. Therefore, this study aimed to assess consistent condom utilization and associated factors among HIV-positive individuals attending an antiretroviral therapy clinic at Pawi general hospital, North West Ethiopia in 2020.An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted among 419 HIV-positive individuals who have follow-up in the Pawi general hospital antiretroviral therapy clinics, from January to February 2020. The study subjects were reached using a systematic sampling technique and data were collected using a pretested and structured questionnaire. Data entry and analysis were performed using epi-data version 3.1 and SPSS version 23 respectively. Binary and multivariable analyses with a 95% confidence level were performed. In the final model, variables with P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.A total of 419 antiretroviral therapy study participants were participated in the study with a response rate of 100%. In this finding, the consistent condom utilization rate was 49.2% [95% CI: 42.2-56.5%]. After controlling for possible confounding factors, the results showed that place of residence [AOR = 2.16, 95% CI: 1.05, 4.45], marital status [AOR = 0.19, 95%CI: 0.05, 0.67], number of partners [AOR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.55] and level of education [AOR = 5.33, 95% CI: 1.57, 18.08] were associated factors of consistent condom utilization.Consistent condom utilization among HIV-positive clients attending antiretroviral therapy clinics at Pawi general hospital was low. Residence, marital status, level of education and number of partners were significantly associated factors of consistent condom use. Health education program and counseling services should be started to increase knowledge about way of transmission and appropriate use of condoms, increase self-efficacy towards condom use and reduction in the number of sexual partners."
https://openalex.org/W4200506192,"This study seeks to identify the socio-demographic, reproductive, partner-related, and facility-level characteristics associated with women’s immediate and subsequent use of post-abortion contraception in Ghana. Secondary data from the 2017 Ghana Maternal Health Survey were utilized in this study. The weighted data comprised 1,880 women who had ever had an abortion within the five years preceding the survey. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the associations between the predictor and outcome variables. Health provider and women’s socio-demographic characteristics were significantly associated with women’s use of post-abortion contraception. Health provider’s counselling on family planning prior to or after abortion and place of residence were associated with both immediate and subsequent post-abortion uptake of contraception. Among subsequent post-abortion contraceptive users, older women (35–49), women in a union, and women who had used contraception prior to becoming pregnant were strong predictors. Partner-related and reproductive variables did not predict immediate and subsequent use of contraception following abortion. Individual and structural/institutional level characteristics are important in increasing women’s acceptance and use of contraception post abortion. Improving and intensifying family planning counselling services at the health facility is critical in increasing contraceptive prevalence among abortion seekers."

This study aims to describe the barriers and facilitators to adherence for patients receiving first-line and second-line ART, identify different adherence strategies utilized and make recommendations for an improved adherence strategy. This mixed method parallel convergent study will be conducted in seven high volume public health facilities in Gauteng and one in Limpopo province in South Africa. The study consists of four phases; a retrospective secondary data analysis of a large cohort of patients on ART (using TIER.Net, an ART patient and data management system for recording and monitoring patients on ART and tuberculosis (TB)) from seven Johannesburg inner-city public health facilities (Gauteng province); a secondary data analysis of the Intensified Treatment Monitoring Accumulation (ITREMA) trial (a randomized control trial which ran from June 2015 to January 2019) conducted at the Ndlovu Medical Center (Limpopo province); in-depth interviews with people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (PLHIV) who are taking ART (in both urban and rural settings); and a systematic review of the impact of treatment adherence interventions for chronic conditions in sub-Saharan Africa. Data will be collected on demographics, socio-economic status, treatment support, retention in care status, disclosure, stigma, clinical markers (CD4 count and viral load (VL)), self-reported adherence information, intrapersonal, and interpersonal factors, community networks, and policy level factors. The systematic review will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) reporting and Population, Interventions, Comparisons and Outcomes (PICO) criteria. Analyses will involve tests of association (Chi-square and t-test), thematic analysis (deductive and inductive approaches) and network meta-analysis. Using an integrated multilevel socio-ecological framework this study will describe the factors associated with adherence for PLHIV who are taking first-line or second-line ART. Implementing evidence-based adherence approaches, when taken up, will improve patient's overall health outcomes.

However, there is no adequate evidence in Ethiopia in general and in the study area in particular. Hence, this study aims to estimate lifetime survival and predictors of mortality among TB with HIV co-infected children after test and treat strategies launched in Northwest Ethiopia Hospitals, 2021.Institution-based historical follow-up study was conducted in Northwest Ethiopia Hospitals among 227 Tuberculosis and Human Immunodeficiency Virus co-infected children from March 1, 2014, to January 12, 2021. The data were entered into Epi info-7 and then exported to STATA version 14 for analysis. The log-rank test was used to estimate the curve difference of the predictor variables. Bivariable cox-proportional hazard models were employed for each predictor variable. Additionally, those variables having a p-value < 0.25 in bivariate analysis were fitted into a multivariable cox-proportional hazards model. P-value < 0.05 was used to declare significance associated with the dependent variable.From a total of 227 TB and HIV co-infected children, 39 died during the follow-up period. The overall mortality rate was 3.7 (95% CI (confidence interval): 2.9-4.7) per 100 person-years with a total of 1063.2-year observations. Cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) non-users [Adjusted Hazarded Ratio (AHR) = 3.8 (95% CI: 1.64-8.86)], presence of treatment failure [AHR = 3.0 (95% CI: 1.14-78.17)], and Cluster of differentiation 4(CD4) count below threshold [AHR = 2.7 (95% CI: 1.21-6.45)] were significant predictors of mortality.In this study, the mortality rate among TB and HIV co-infected children was found to be very high. The risk of mortality among TB and HIV co-infected children was associated with treatment failure, CD4 count below the threshold, and cotrimoxazole preventive therapy non-users.

The capability approach states that well-being should be understood in terms of capabilities, the substantial opportunities that people have to be and do things they have reasons to value. In this Rehabilitation and Capability care for patients with Neuromuscular diseases (ReCap-NMD) study, we want to investigate whether providing care based on the capability approach (capability care) has an added value in the rehabilitation of patients with neuromuscular diseases (NMD).Two groups of 30 adult patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy or myotonic dystrophy type 1 will be included. The first group will receive rehabilitation care as usual with a follow-up period of 6 months. Then, based on theory, and experiences of patients and healthcare professionals, capability care will be developed. During the following 3 months, the multidisciplinary outpatient rehabilitation care team will be trained in providing this newly developed capability care. Subsequently, the second group will receive capability care, with a follow-up period of 6 months. A mixed methods approach is used with both qualitative and quantitative outcome measures to evaluate the effect of capability care and to perform a process evaluation. The primary outcome measure will be the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure.The ReCap-NMD study is the first study to design and implement a healthcare intervention based on the capability approach.

https://openalex.org/W4200233852,"This paper presents validation of the VR Simulation Realism Scale on a Polish sample. The scale enables a self-report measurement of perceived realism of a virtual environment in four main aspects of such realism-scene realism, audience behavior realism, audience appearance realism and sound realism. However, since the development of the original scale, the VR technology significantly changed. We aimed to respond to that change and revalidate the original measure in the contemporary setting. For the purpose of scale validation, data was gathered from six studies with 720 participants in total. Five experiments and one online survey were conducted to examine psychometric properties of the scale in accordance with the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing. Evidence based on internal structure, relations to other variables and test content was obtained. The factorial structure of the original scale was tested and confirmed. The connections between realism and immersion, presence, aesthetics were verified. A suppressed relationship between realism and positive affect was discovered. Moreover, it was confirmed that scale result is dependent on the quality of VR graphics. Results of the analyses provide the evidence that the VR Simulation Realism Scale is a well-established tool that might be used both in science and in VR development. However, further research needs to be done to increase external validity and predictive power of the scale."

Locating relevant genomic regions, mining stable genes and developing candidate gene markers can promote the breeding of new high-starch potato varieties. A total of 106 F1 individuals and their parents (YSP-4 × MIN-021) were used as test materials, from which 20 plants with high starch content and 20 with low starch content were selected to construct DNA pools for site-specific amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) and bulked segregation analysis (BSA). A genomic region related to the starch traits was first identified in the 0-5.62 Mb of chromosome 2 in tetraploid potato. In this section, a total of 41 non-synonymous genes, which were considered as candidate genes related to the starch trait, were annotated through a basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) search of multiple databases. Six candidate genes for starch (PGSC0003DMG400017793, PGSC0003DMG400035245, PGSC0003DMG400036713, PGSC0003DMG400040452, PGSC0003DMG400006636 and PGSC0003DMG400044547) were further explored. In addition, cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers were developed based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites associated with the starch candidate genes. SNP-CAPS markers chr2-CAPS6 and chr2-CAPS21 were successfully developed and validated with the F2 population and 24 tetraploid potato varieties (lines). Functional analysis and cloning of the candidate genes associated with potato starch will be performed in further research, and the SNP-CAPS markers chr2-CAPS6 and chr2-CAPS21 can be further used in marker-assisted selection breeding of tetraploid potato varieties with high starch content."

https://openalex.org/W4200604231,"Papillon-Lefèvre Syndrome (PLS) is an autosomal recessive monogenic disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the CTSC gene, thus preventing the synthesis of the protease Cathepsin C (CTSC) in a proteolytically active form. CTSC is responsible for the activation of the pro-forms of the neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs; Elastase, Proteinase 3 and Cathepsin G), suggesting its involvement in a variety of neutrophil functions. In PLS neutrophils, the lack of CTSC protease activity leads to inactivity of the NSPs. Clinically, PLS is characterized by an early, typically pre-pubertal, onset of severe periodontal pathology and palmoplantar hyperkeratosis. However, PLS is not considered an immune deficiency as patients do not typically suffer from recurrent and severe (bacterial and fungal) infections. In this study we investigated an unusual CTSC mutation in two siblings with PLS, a 503A>G substitution in exon 4 of the CTSC gene, expected to result in an amino acid replacement from tyrosine to cysteine at position 168 of the CTSC protein. Both patients bearing this mutation presented with pronounced periodontal pathology. The characteristics and functions of neutrophils from patients homozygous for the 503A>G CTSC mutation were compared to another previously described PLS mutation (755A>T), and a small cohort of healthy volunteers. Neutrophil lysates from patients with the 503A>G substitution lacked CTSC protein and did not display any CTSC or NSP activity, yet neutrophil counts, morphology, priming, chemotaxis, radical production, and regulation of apoptosis were without any overt signs of alteration. However, NET formation upon PMA-stimulation was found to be severely depressed, but not abolished, in PLS neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W4200616781,"Current methods of small animal exercise involve either voluntary (wheel running) or forced (treadmill running) protocols. Although commonly used, each have several drawbacks which cause hesitancy to adopt these methods. While mice will instinctively run on a wheel, the distance and time spent running can vary widely. Forced exercise, while controllable, puts animals in stressful environments in which they are confined and often shocked for ""encouragement."" Additionally, both methods require expensive equipment and software, which limit these experiments to well-funded laboratories. To counter these issues, we developed a non-invasive mouse running device aimed to reduce handler-induced stress, provide time- and distance-based stopping conditions, and enable investigators with limited resources to easily produce and use the device. The Lockable Open-Source Training-Wheel (LOST-Wheel) was designed to be 3D printed on any standard entry-level printer and assembled using a few common tools for around 20 USD. It features an on-board screen and is capable of tracking distances, running time, and velocities of mice. The LOST-Wheel overcomes the largest drawback to voluntary exercise, which is the inability to control when and how long mice run, using a servo driven mechanism that locks and unlocks the running surface according to the protocol of the investigator. While the LOST-Wheel can be used without a computer connection, we designed an accompanying application to provide scientists with additional analyses. The LOST-Wheel Logger, an R-based application, displays milestones and plots on a user-friendly dashboard. Using the LOST-Wheel, we implemented a timed running experiment that showed distance-dependent decreases in serum myostatin as well as IL-6 gene upregulation in muscle. To make this device accessible, we are releasing the designs, application, and manual in an open-source format. The implementation of the LOST-Wheel and future iterations will improve upon existing murine exercise equipment and research."
https://openalex.org/W4225343195,"Visual perspective taking is inferring how the world looks to another person. To clarify this process, we investigated whether employing a humanoid avatar as the viewpoint would facilitate an imagined perspective shift in a virtual environment, and which factor of the avatar is effective for the facilitation effect. We used a task that involved reporting how an object looks by a simple direction judgment, either from the avatar’s position or from the position of an empty chair. We found that the humanoid avatar’s presence improved task performance. Furthermore, the avatar’s facilitation effect was observed only when the avatar was facing the visual stimulus to be judged; performance was worse when it faced backwards than when there was only an empty chair facing forwards. This suggests that the avatar does not simply attract spatial attention, but the posture of the avatar is crucial for the facilitation effect. In addition, when the directions of the head and the torso were opposite (i.e., an impossible posture), the avatar’s facilitation effect disappeared. Thus, visual perspective taking might not be facilitated by the avatar when its posture is biomechanically impossible because we cannot embody it. Finally, even when the avatar’s head of the possible posture was covered with a bucket, the facilitation effect was found with the forward-facing avatar rather than the backward-facing avatar. That is, the head/gaze direction cue, or presumably the belief that the visual stimulus to be judged can be seen by the avatar, was not required. These results suggest that explicit perspective taking is facilitated by embodiment towards humanoid avatars."

Under such programs, providers are often compared against their peers in order to win bonuses or face penalties in payment. Yet luck has the potential to affect performance assessment through randomness in the sorting of patients among providers or through random events during the evaluation period. To investigate the impact luck can have on the assessment of performance, we investigated its role in assigning penalties under Medicare's Hospital Readmissions Reduction Policy (HRRP), a program that penalizes hospitals with excess readmissions. We performed simulations that estimated program hospitals' 2015 readmission penalties in 1,000 different hypothetical fiscal years. These hypothetical fiscal years were created by: (a) randomly varying which patients were admitted to each hospital and (b) randomly varying the readmission status of discharged patients. We found significant differences in penalty sizes and probability of penalty across hypothetical fiscal years, signifying the importance of luck in readmission performance under the HRRP. Nearly all of the impact from luck arose from events occurring after hospital discharge. Luck played a smaller role in determining penalties for hospitals with more beds, teaching hospitals, and safety-net hospitals."

Here, we examine how age affects Kv4/Shal and Kv1/Shaker K+ channel protein levels in Drosophila. We show that Kv4/Shal protein levels decline sharply from 3 days to 10 days, then more gradually from 10 to 40 days after eclosion. In contrast, Kv1/Shaker protein exhibits a transient increase at 10 days that then stabilizes and eventually declines at 40 days. We present data that begin to show a relationship between reactive oxygen species (ROS), Kv4/Shal, and locomotor performance. We show that Kv4/Shal levels are negatively affected by ROS, and that over-expression of Catalase or RNAi knock-down of the ROS-generating enzyme, Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH) Oxidase (NOX), can attenuate the loss of Kv4/Shal protein. Finally, we compare levels of Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 in the hippocampus, olfactory bulb, cerebellum, and motor cortex of mice aged 6 weeks and 1 year. While there was no global decline in Kv4.2/4.3 that parallels what we report in Drosophila, we did find that Kv4.2/4.3 are differentially affected in various brain regions; this survey of changes may help inform mammalian studies that examine neuronal function with age."

(1) In primary gastric cancer, median methylation value was 0.055, ranging from 0 to 124.3. First, MLH1 hypermethylation was strongly correlated with MSI-High/MSI-Low status and suppressed immunostaining (P < 0.0001). (2) The MLH1 hypermethylation was associated with advanced age (P = 0.0048), antral location (P = 0.0486), synchronous multiple gastric cancer (P = 0.0001), and differentiated histology (P = 0.028). (3) Log-rank plot analysis identified the most relevant cut-off value (0.23) to reflect gentle phenotypes in MLH1 hypermethylation cases (P = 0.0019), especially in advanced gastric cancer (P = 0.0132), which are designated as haploinsufficiency of MSI (MSI-haplo) phenotype in this study. (4) In synchronous multiple gastric cancer, MLH1 hypermethylation was not necessarily confirmed as field cancerization. (5) MSI-haplo defined by MLH1 methylation status represented distinct prognostic phenotype even after molecular classifications. MLH1 hypermethylation designated as MSI-haplo may represent unique prognostic phenotype during gastric carcinogenesis."

While instructors can coach students through the analysis of data that they have either generated themselves or obtained from published articles, the burgeoning availability of preprint articles provides a new potential pedagogical tool. We developed a new method in which students use a cognitive apprenticeship model to uncover how experts analyzed a paper and compare the professional's cognitive approach to their own. Specifically, students first critique research data themselves and then identify changes between the preprint and final versions of the paper that were likely the results of peer review. From this activity, students reported diverse insights into the processes of data presentation, peer review, and scientific publishing. Analysis of preprint articles is therefore a valuable new tool to strengthen students' information literacy and understanding of the process of science."
