The grossly normal phenotype in human subjects deficient in AQP1 (Colton null blood group) and in AQP4 knockout mice has suggested that aquaporins (other than the vasopressin-regulated water channel AQP2) may not be important in mammalian physiology. We have generated transgenic mice lacking detectable AQP1 by targeted gene disruption. In kidney proximal tubule membrane vesicles from knockout mice, osmotic water permeability was reduced 8-fold compared with vesicles from wild-type mice. Although the knockout mice were grossly normal in terms of survival, physical appearance, and organ morphology, they became severely dehydrated and lethargic after water deprivation for 36 h. Body weight decreased by 35 ± 2%, serum osmolality increased to >500 mOsm, and urinary osmolality (657 ± 59 mOsm) did not change from that before water deprivation. In contrast, wild-type and heterozygous mice remained active after water deprivation, body weight decreased by 20–22%, serum osmolality remained normal (310–330 mOsm), and urine osmolality rose to >2500 mOsm. Urine [Na+] in water-deprived knockout mice was <10 mm, and urine osmolality was not increased by the V2 agonist DDAVP. The results suggest that AQP1 knockout mice are unable to create a hypertonic medullary interstitium by countercurrent multiplication. AQP1 is thus required for the formation of a concentrated urine by the kidney.

There are a family of related water transporting proteins (water channels, aquaporins) whose members are expressed widely in animals, plants, and bacteria. Eight aquaporin-type water channels (AQP1–AQP8) 1The abbreviations used are: AQP, aquaporin; kb, kilobase(s); ES, embryonic stem; DDAVP, desmopressin. 1The abbreviations used are: AQP, aquaporin; kb, kilobase(s); ES, embryonic stem; DDAVP, desmopressin. with homology to the major intrinsic protein of lens fiber have been cloned in mammals to date (1Verkman A.S. van Hoek A.N.

AQP2 functions as a vasopressin-stimulated water transporter in kidney collecting duct epithelium (4Fushimi K. Uchida S. Hara Y. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Sasaki S.

In contrast, humans lacking AQP1 were reported to be phenotypically normal (7Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Zeidel M.L. Moulds J.J. Agre P. Science. 1994; 265: 1585-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), although formal clinical evaluation was not done. Recently, we reported that transgenic mice lacking AQP4 were phenotypically similar to wild-type mice except for a mild decrease in maximum urinary concentration (8Ma T. Yang B. Gillespie A.

In kidney, AQP1 is found at the apical and basolateral membranes of epithelial cells in proximal tubule and thin descending limb of Henle (10Sabolic I. Valenti G. Verbavatz J.M. van Hoek A.N.

Physiol. 1997; 272: F587-F596PubMed Google Scholar). The density of AQP1 is exceptionally high in thin descending limb (16Verbavatz J.M. Brown D. Sabolic I. Valenti G. Ausiello D.A. van Hoek A.N.

AQP1 functions as a water-selective transporting protein (17Van Hoek A.N. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18267-18269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zeidel M.L. Ambudkar S.V.

The high expression of AQP1 in kidney suggests an essential role in the renal concentrating mechanism. We have generated transgenic mice lacking AQP1 and demonstrate that these mice have low water permeability in proximal tubule membrane vesicles and are unable to concentrate their urine. The mouse AQP1 gene was isolated from a C57BL6/J genomic library (CLONTECHML1043j) and analyzed. A targeting vector was constructed using an 8-kb genomic DNA fragment containing exon 1 and intron 1. Part of the exon 1 coding sequence into ∼1.3 kb of intron 1 was replaced by a 1.8-kb PolIIneobpA cassette for positive selection, and a PGK-tk cassette was inserted upstream for negative selection. The vector was linearized at a unique downstream NotI site and electroporated into CB1-4 embryonic stem (ES) cells (19Li Y. Huang T.T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Novel L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.J. Wallace D.C. Epstein C.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar). Transfected ES cells were selected with G418 and FIAU for 7 days, yielding seven targeted clones out of 232 doubly resistant colonies upon screening by polymerase chain reaction using a neo-specific sense primer and an AQP1 gene-specific antisense primer located 50 base pairs downstream of the targeting region. Homologous recombination was confirmed by Southern hybridization: 10 μg of genomic DNAs were digested with ApaI, electrophoresed, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with the 0.8-kb 32P-labeled genomic fragment indicated in Fig. 1 A. ES cells were injected into PC 2.5-day 8-cell morula stage CD1 zygotes, cultured overnight to blastocysts, and transferred to pseudopregnant B6D2 females. Offspring were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction followed by Southern blot analysis as described above. Heterozygous mice were intercrossed to produce homozygous AQP1 knockout mice. Sealed apical membrane vesicles from kidney proximal tubule were isolated by a magnesium aggregation procedure (20Verkman A.S. Dix J.A. Seifter J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: F650-F655PubMed Google Scholar, 21Booth A.G. Kenny A.J. Biochem. J. 1974; 142: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). 1-mm slices of kidney cortex were homogenized and centrifuged to remove unbroken cells. Solid MgCl2 was added to the homogenate to a final concentration of 10 mm. Vesicles were isolated by differential centrifugation and suspended in 50 mmmannitol-Tris buffer, pH 7.4. Osmotic water permeability was measured by stopped-flow light scattering (17Van Hoek A.N. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18267-18269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Verkman A.S. Dix J.A. Seifter J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: F650-F655PubMed Google Scholar). Apical membrane vesicles (∼0.1 mg of protein/ml) were suspended in 50 mmmannitol-2 mm Tris (55 mOsm) and mixed in <1 ms with an equal volume of hyperosmolar buffer (155 mOsm) to give a 50 mOsm inwardly directed osmotic gradient. Ninety degree light scattering was measured at 520 nm wavelength. Pf was computed using a vesicle surface-to-volume ratio of 2.5 × 105cm−1. Urine osmolalities and serum chemistries of 32–35-day-old mice were measured by the University of California, San Francisco Clinical Chemistry Laboratory before and after water deprivation. To collect urine samples, mice were placed on a wire mesh platform in a clean glass beaker until spontaneous voiding was observed. Fresh urine sample was collected and kept on ice until assay. In some experiments, 0.4 μg/kg DDAVP was injected intraperitoneally after obtaining the 36-h urine sample, and urine was collected at 1–2 h after injection. RNAs from kidney, lung, eye, spleen, and heart were isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNAs (10 μg/lane) were resolved on a formaldehyde-agarose denaturing gel, transferred to a Nylon membrane, and hybridized at high stringency with 32P-labeled probes corresponding to each of the cDNA coding regions of AQPs 1–4. For immunoblot analysis tissues were homogenized in 250 mmsucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 4 μg/ml antipain. Proteins were resolved on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blotted with a rabbit polyclonal anti-AQP1 antibody raised against purified erythrocyte AQP1 protein. AQP1 knockout mice were generated by targeted gene disruption. A targeting vector for homologous recombination was designed to delete a critical part of the AQP1 coding sequence (Fig. 1 A). Intercross of heterozygous founder mice showed wild-type, heterozygous, and knockout genotypes (Fig. 1 B). The knockout mice did not express detectable full-length AQP1 transcript or protein in kidney (Figs. 1,C and D) or in tissues where it is known to be strongly expressed (lung, eye, spleen, and heart; not shown). As expected from previous studies on rat kidney (10Sabolic I. Valenti G. Verbavatz J.M. van Hoek A.N. Verkman A.S. Ausiello D.A. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C1225-C1233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Nielsen S. Digiovani S.R. Christensen E.I. Knepper M.A. Harris H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11663-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 12Zhang R. Skach W.R. Hasegawa H. van Hoek A.S. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), AQP1 was localized in wild-type mice to plasma membranes of proximal tubule (Fig. 1 E) and descending limb of Henle epithelia and vasa recta endothelia (not shown). Specific AQP1 staining was not detected in kidneys from knockout mice (Fig. 1 F). Genotype analysis of 166 births showed 45 wild-type, 84 heterozygote, and 37 knockout mice, consistent with 1:2:1 Mendelian inheritance. The AQP1 knockout mice were not obviously different from wild-type mice in survival, gross physical appearance, and organ morphology, except for mild growth retardation. Functional analysis of AQP1 in kidney was done using purified apical membrane vesicles from proximal tubule epithelium. Osmotic water permeability (Pf) was measured from the time course of 90° scattered light intensity in response to a rapidly imposed osmotic gradient. Pf was decreased strongly in membranes from knockout versus wild-type mice with intermediate Pf for heterozygotes (Fig. 2 A, Pf= 0.018 ± 0.002 cm/s wild-type; 0.010 ± 0.001 cm/s heterozygous; 0.002 ± 0.0003 cm/s knockout). After inhibition by 0.2 mm HgCl2, Pf in membranes from wild-type and heterozygous mice was similar toPf in knockout mice (0.001–0.002 cm/s, Fig. 2 B). This low Pf is typical of lipid bilayer membranes not containing water channels, indicating that AQP1 is the principal functional water transporter of proximal tubule apical membrane. Stopped-flow measurements also revealed an ∼8-fold decrease in Pf in erythrocytes from knockoutversus wild-type mice (not shown). To determine whether AQP1 is required for formation of a concentrated urine, freshly voided urine specimens were collected before and after water deprivation. Whereas the wild-type and heterozygous mice were active and appeared grossly normal after being deprived of water for 36 h, the knockout mice became remarkably lethargic and in some cases unresponsive. Average body weight decreased by 35% in the knockout mice compared with 20–22% in wild-type and heterozygous mice (Fig. 3 A), and serum osmolality increased to 517 mOsm compared with 311–325 mOsm in wild-type and heterozygous mice. For comparison, body weight decreased by 22% for age-matched AQP4 knockout mice. Interestingly, despite the marked hyperosmolality in water-deprived AQP1 knockout mice, nearly every mouse could be resuscitated by oral water administration without morbidity. Fig. 3 B shows a remarkably low urine osmolality in AQP1 knockout mice prior to water deprivation (580–610 mOsm) that did not increase after deprivation. Measurement of urine osmolalities of the knockout mice every 8 h showed values consistently less than 650 mOsm. In contrast, average urine osmolality in wild-type and heterozygous mice was 1400 mOsm before water deprivation and increased to ∼3000 mOsm after deprivation. In four out of five water-deprived AQP1 knockout mice, urine sodium concentration was less than 10 mm. Intraperitoneal injection of the V2 receptor agonist DDAVP caused no further increase in urine osmolality in knockout mice, indicating that the urinary concentrating defect associated with AQP1 knockout involves the kidney and not central osmoreceptor sensing. To investigate the possibility that AQP1 knockout is associated with a change in the expression of other renal aquaporins that might be involved in kidney fluid balance, expression of AQP2, AQP3, and AQP4 was quantified by Northern and immunoblot analysis. AQP1 deletion did not change the expression of AQP3 and AQP4, but was associated with a mild increase (20–50% over that in wild-type mice) in expression of AQP2 transcript and protein. The inability of AQP1 knockout mice to form a concentrated urine can be the consequence of distinct defects acting in synergy: impairment of near-isosmolar fluid reabsorption in proximal tubule leading to fluid overload of the distal nephron and disruption of the medullary countercurrent multiplication mechanism because of low water permeability in descending limb of Henle and vasa recta (22Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F3-F12PubMed Google Scholar, 23Jen J.R. Stephenson L.B. Bull. Math. Biol. 1994; 56: 491-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 24Chou C.-L. Digiovanni S.R. Mejia R. Nielsen S. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F70-F77Crossref Google Scholar). The absence of a detectable defect in urinary concentrating ability in heterozygous mice indicates that the kidney expresses a considerable excess of AQP1 over that needed to maintain fluid homeostasis. The low urine sodium concentration in water-deprived AQP1 knockout mice suggests that renal salt transporting function is intact, which is consistent with urine > serum osmolality prior to water deprivation. The absence of DDAVP effect, which should equalize urine and medullary interstitial osmolalities, indicates that the medullary interstitium of AQP1 knockout mice is not appropriately hypertonic. Taken together, these results suggest that the primary renal defect in AQP1 knockout mice is the inability to generate a hypertonic medullary interstitium by countercurrent multiplication. The data above implicate an important role for AQP1 in the renal urinary concentrating mechanism. The report of apparently normal phenotype in three humans lacking AQP1 (7Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Zeidel M.L. Moulds J.J. Agre P. Science. 1994; 265: 1585-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) did not include analysis of fluid consumption or physiological response to stresses such as dehydration. The strong expression of AQP1 in choroid plexus, ciliary body, pulmonary capillary endothelia, biliary tract epithelia, and reproductive organs indicates the need for rigorous evaluation of cerebrospinal and aqueous humor fluid balance, lung interstitial fluid clearance, and gastrointestinal and reproductive function. The dramatically abnormal phenotype associated with AQP1 deletion raises the possibility that other mammalian aquaporins have important physiological function. Deletion of each remaining aquaporin in mice is likely be informative, as might the screening for aquaporin mutations in genetic diseases associated with abnormalities of fluid balance."

The requirements for activating these crucial enzymatic mediators of death are not well understood. Using molecular chimeras with either CD8 or Tac, we find that oligomerization at the cell membrane powerfully induces caspase-8 autoactivation and apoptosis. Death induction was abrogated by the z-VAD-fmk, z-IETD-fmk, or p35 enzyme inhibitors or by a mutation in the active site cysteine but was surprisingly unaffected by death inhibitor Bcl-2. Amino acid substitutions that prevent the proteolytic separation of the caspase from its membrane-associated domain completely blocked apoptosis. Thus, oligomerization at the membrane is sufficient for caspase-8 autoactivation, but apoptosis could involve a death signal conveyed by the proteolytic release of the enzyme into the cytoplasm.

A pivotal biochemical event of programmed cell death or apoptosis is the activation of cysteinyl, aspartate-specific proteases or caspases (1Nicholson D. Thornberry N. Trends Biochem.

The caspase gene family in mammals includes at least 10 members that share protein sequence similarity to theced3 cell death gene from Caenorhabditis elegans(3Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J.

Nature. 1995; 377: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The essential role of caspases is to endoproteolytically cleave a select group of cellular proteins at aspartate residues, thereby causing the nuclear and cytoplasmic alterations that typify apoptosis. The principal regulation of caspases is post-translational. They reside in the cell as inactive zymogens, which must be proteolytically processed at internal aspartates to generate the subunits of the active enzyme. How caspases are activated is a critical question in the immune system, since normal lymphocyte homeostasis and immune tolerance involves CD95-induced apoptosis that depends on caspase activation (5Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).

SuperSignal horseradish peroxidase substrate was from Pierce. The parental and Bcl-2-overexpressing stable MCF-7 lines were kindly provided by Drs. Ulrich Brinkmann and Ira Pastan, National Cancer Institute, NIH. The caspase-8 (MACH-α1/FLICE) coding sequence was cloned using reverse transcription PCR into the pCR3-Uni vector using the TA cloning kit per manufacturer's protocols. The full-length cDNA was sequenced and then subcloned into a modified pcDNA3 vector, pCEFL, in which the cytomegalovirus promoter was replaced by the promoter for elongation factor 2 (EF-2). High-fidelity PCR products of caspase-8 (98–479 and 209–479) were subcloned asHindIII-NotI fragments into digested pCEFL. The vector pCEFL-CD8-EMPTY vector and the pCEFL-Myr vector containing thesrc myristoylation sequence were used for the in-frame cloning of the caspase-8 protease domain. The Tac-C construct was made by amplifying the extracellular and transmembrane domains (Tac EX-TM) of the Tac cDNA using high-fidelity PCR. CD8 was removed from the CD8-C construct using HindIII and BamHI, and the digested PCR product of Tac EX-TM was ligated in frame with caspase-8 Δ209. Point mutations were made in the pCEFL-CD8-C using the altered sites mutagenesis kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and the Quik-Change kits (Stratagene), according to the instructions of the manufacturers. For all Jurkat transfections, plasmid constructions (pCEFL, pCEFL-caspase-8, pCEFL-caspase-8 Δ98, pCEFL-caspase-8 Δ209, pCEFL-Myr-C, pCEFL-CD8-C, pCEFL-Tac-C, pcDNA3-FADD, p35-pCI, CD8-C, and the Tac-C mutants as outlined in the figures), along with pCEFL-GFP, were electroporated into 4–8 × 106 Jurkat cells in 0.4 ml of complete medium in an Electrocell Manipulator 600 (BTX Corp., San Diego, CA). Plasmids were added to the cells at a 3:1 mass excess of the caspase constructions to GFP to ensure that all cells expressing GFP simultaneously expressed the cotransfected DNA of interest. The total amount of DNA/cuvette ranged from 15 to 20 μg. After pulse discharge at settings 260 V, 1050 μF, and 720Ω, the cells were immediately placed in 7 ml of fresh RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, incubated for 16–20 h at 37 °C, and analyzed using flow cytometry. Where indicated 50 μm of the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk was added to the cells/media immediately following electroporation. For the chimeric caspase-8 constructs, the cells were stained for surface expression of either CD8 or Tac (CD25) prior to analysis using flow cytometry. Dead cells were gated out using forward and side scatter profiles, and the percent cell death was calculated from the loss of live GFP-positive cells in treated samples compared with the control vector. For the inhibition of CD8-C apoptosis in Jurkat T-cells, 4 μg of CD8-C (or pCEFL control plasmid) was cotransfected with 2 μg of the GFP vector and either 20 μg of pCEFL with or without 50 μm z-VAD-fmk, 50 μm z-IETD-fmk (Enzyme Systems Products, Livermore, CA) or 20 μg of p35-pCI. After transfection, the cells were analyzed for CD8 surface expression using flow cytometry. For 293T cells, subconfluent cells were transfected in six-well plates using the calcium phosphate method (Stratagene) according to manufacturer's instructions, with the modification that 25 μm chloroquine was added to the medium to facilitate DNA uptake. Cells were transfected with the plasmid combinations described in the figures with a 2.5:1 excess of the DNA of interest to the 3Lac-z construct (total DNA: 1.5–2.0 μg). After 24–30 h, the cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature and then stained in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm each K3Fe(CN)6 and K4Fe(CN)6·3H2O, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.01% SDS, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside until a suitable color developed, usually for 3–4 h at 37 °C. To enumerate the fraction of blue cells that had undergone apoptotic changes, a minimum of 200 blue-staining cells/well were counted using light microscopy and unambiguously scored as being apoptotic or nonapoptotic by morphological assessment. The Bcl-2 stable MCF-7 line showed approximately 20-fold excess Bcl-2 protein over the parental line by Western blot and had a demonstrable defect in tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis (data not shown). Transfections were done using the calcium phosphate method as described above. For the CD8-C inhibition experiments in 293T cells, 250 ng of CD8-C was transfected along with 1–5 μg of either CD8-empty or CD8-C D210A/D216A or 5 μg of pCEFL using Superfect (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's protocol. Cells were fixed at 24 h, stained, and enumerated with light microscopy as described above. Surface expression of Jurkat T-cells transfected with CD8 and Tac fusion proteins was done using PE-labeled anti-human CD8 and anti-Tac antisera (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Flow cytometry was carried out on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) using CellQuest software. GFP fluorescence was analyzed using the FL1 channel. Twenty-four hours after transfection (as described above) with the indicated constructs (see figure legends), 293T cells were lysed in buffer containing 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, complete protease inhibitor mix (Boerhinger Mannheim), and 10 mm iodoacetamide. After lysis for 30 min on ice, supernatants were diluted in SDS sample buffer with or without 40 mm dithiothreitol, boiled, and electrophoresed on 4–20% Tris/glycine/SDS gels. Proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose using a semidry transfer apparatus. The blots were then probed with 1:1000 dilution of anti-GFP mAb (Fig. 3) followed by 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch) or 1:20 dilution of a p18-specific anti-caspase-8 mAb (a kind gift of Dr. Peter Krammer, German Cancer Research Center) followed by 1:2500 dilution of isotype-specific goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Caltag) (Fig. 4). Bands were imaged with SuperSignal horseradish peroxidase substrate (Pierce). Equivalent cell numbers were loaded onto each lane.Figure 4Mutations reveal amino acids that are essential for apoptosis induction by CD8-C. A, expression plasmids containing single nucleotide changes that cause the substitution of either serine for the active site cysteine (CD8-C:C360S) or alanines for aspartates required for membrane release (CD8-C:D210A/D216A) were cotransfected with a GFP expression plasmid into Jurkat cells. Cell death was measured as the fraction of transfected (GFP-positive) cells that were lost compared with control. B, photomicrographs of 293T cells cotransfected with pCMV-β-galactosidase along with either CD8-fusion constructs as indicated. Viable cells have a large fibroblastoid morphology, whereas apoptotic cells are shrunken, circular, and extensively blebbed. Magnification is approximately × 200. C, flow cytometry profiles of Jurkat T-cells transfected with 10 μg of the indicated expression constructs with or without 50 μmz-VAD-fmk. The cells were stained with PE-labeled anti-CD25 (Pharmingen) prior to analysis, and only live cells as measured by forward scatter versus side scatter were analyzed for GFP and CD25 (Tac) expression. Viable transfected cells are the double positive cells in the right upper quadrant. D, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of protein extracts from 293T cells that were transiently transfected with CD8-C (lane 1) or CD8-C D210/216A double mutant (lane 2) and probed with anti-caspase-8-specific (p18) mAb. Molecular mass markers in kilodaltons are shown at the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We first studied caspase-8 by transfecting expression constructs containing either full-length or truncated versions into Jurkat T-cells (Fig. 1). We found that the full-length protein inefficiently induced apoptosis compared with the death-signaling protein, FADD/MORT1 (10Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1995; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2111) Google Scholar, 13Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). Removal of one or both death effector domains (DEDs) decreased rather than increased apoptosis demonstrating that the caspase prodomain does not inhibit formation of the active protease. Protein blots confirmed that equivalent protein expression was obtained with each of the constructs (data not shown). Thus, simple overexpression of this caspase did not efficiently induce activation or apoptosis in Jurkat T-cells. We therefore tested the concept that membrane localization and/or oligomerization could initiate caspase autoactivation and apoptosis induction as might be envisioned based on the observation that caspase-8 can be recruited to the DISC (8Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kishchekel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M.

The caspase domain was genetically fused to the transmembrane and extracellular portion of the human CD8α chain, which is known to form disulfide-linked homodimers (14Baur A.S. Sawai E.T. Dazin P. Fantl W.J. Cheng-Mayer C. Peterlin B.M. Immunity. 1994; 1: 373-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 15Irving B.A. Weiss A.

Cell. 1992; 68: 1145-1162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and this expression construct, CD8-C, was transfected into Jurkat cells (Figs. 1and 2 B). CD8-C dramatically induced apoptosis, implying extremely efficient protease activation. Control experiments using the expression vector pCEFL, CD8-empty, or CD8-nef caused little or no apoptosis (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Therefore, the CD8-C chimera, either by membrane targeting, spontaneous oligomerization, or both, strongly induced apoptosis without further cross-linking.Figure 2Chimeric caspase-8 molecules have dramatically enhanced apoptotic activity that can be blocked by caspase inhibitors. A–C, in three separate experiments, Jurkat T-cells were transfected with 10 μg of the indicated constructs along with 2.5 μg of the pCEFL-GFP vector to track the fate of the transfected cells. The cells were analyzed flow cytometrically 24 h after transfection, and percent kill was calculated by measuring the deficit of GFP-positive viable cells in transfections of caspase or FADD compared with control vector alone. Under these conditions, Fas cross-linking with 100 ng/ml CH11 antibody induced ∼90% cell death. Each experiment was replicated three or more times and a representative result is shown. D, flow cytometry profiles of Jurkat T-cells transfected with the indicated constructs combined with empty vector to preserve a constant amount of transfected DNA in each sample. Fifty μm z-VAD-fmk was added immediately after transfection to the cells in the fourth panel. The cells were stained with PE-labeled anti-CD8 (Pharmingen) prior to analysis, and gated live cells were analyzed for GFP and CD8 expression. Viable transfected cells are the double positive cells in the right upper quadrant. E, either no peptide or 50 μm IETD peptide inhibitor that is specifically recognized by caspase-8 was added immediately after transfection with either pCEFL or CD8-C as inA–D. F, to determine the effect of Bcl-2, conventional MCF-7 cells or MCF-7 cells stably overexpressing Bcl-2 (21Brinkmann U. Mansfield E. Pastan I. Apoptosis. 1997; 2: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) were transiently transfected using pCMV-β-galactosidase with a 4-fold excess of vector alone or the indicated expression constructs (total DNA = 2 μg). CD8-nef contains the human immunodeficiency virus nef gene in place of the caspase coding sequence in CD8-C. Percent kill is the percentage of dark (transfected) cells that have a characteristic apoptotic morphology (illustrated in Fig. 4 B). Data are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next tested whether membrane targeting alone could induce caspase activation, by appending the myristoylation sequence from thesrc kinase onto the amino terminus of the caspase domain in an expression construct, Myr-C (17Lacal P.M. Pennington C.Y. Lacal J.C. Oncogene. 1988; 2: 533-537PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of Myr-C was only modestly more active than unmodified caspase-8 in inducing apoptosis (Fig. 2 B). We also prepared a chimera, Tac-C, between the interleukin-2 receptor α chain (Tac) extracellular and transmembrane domains and the caspase domain (18Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Science. 1992; 255: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Tac has been recently shown to cause self-association in the absence of ligand. 3D. Eicher and T. A. Waldmann, personal communication. Tac-C, similar to CD8-C, greatly augmented apoptosis, even without antibody cross-linking of the Tac moiety (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that spontaneous oligomerization of the extracellular domains of CD8 or Tac is sufficient to powerfully induce caspase-8 autoactivation and apoptosis. The cell death caused by CD8-C involved caspase activation, because either the z-VAD-fmk peptide (19Tomita Y. Kawasaki T. Bilim V. Takeda M. Takahashi K. Int. J. Can. 1996; 68: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or the baculovirus p35 caspase inhibitors (20Clem R.J. Fechheimer M. Miller L.K. Science. 1991; 254: 1388-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) inhibited apoptosis (Fig. 2 D). Under caspase-8-inhibited conditions, we observed abundant surface CD8 staining on viable cells, which confirmed that the CD8-C chimera was actually expressed following transfection (Fig. 2 D). Moreover, we also tested an inhibitor peptide, z-IETD-fmk, based on the optimal sequence recognized by caspase-8 and found that this peptide completely abrogated apoptosis induced by CD8-C (Fig. 2 E). By contrast, the overexpression of Bcl-2 (21Brinkmann U. Mansfield E. Pastan I. Apoptosis. 1997; 2: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which could protect against apoptosis mediators such as staurosporine, was incapable of protecting from programmed death due to direct caspase-8 activation by CD8-C (Fig. 2 F). The viral inhibitory protein MC159, which disrupts normal DISC formation and blocks CD95-induced apoptosis by preventing caspase-8 from binding to FADD (22Bertin J. Armstrong R.C. Ottilie S. Martin D.A. Wang Y. Banks S. Wang G.H. Senkevich T.G. Alnemri E.S. Moss B. Lenardo M.J. Tomaselli K.J. Cohen J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1172-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 23Hu S. Vincenz C. Buller M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9621-9624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), also did not inhibit apoptosis by CD8-C (data not shown), implying that the autoactivation of caspase-8 in our system did not require the formation or participation of the DISC. Also, brefeldin A was incapable of blocking CD8-C-mediated death, implying that oligomerization and caspase activation may occur in the membranes of early compartments prior to transport to the membrane at the cell surface (data not shown). An important biochemical feature of the CD8α extracellular domain is its ability to form disulfide-linked homodimers. Since no additional external cross-linking (such as by antibody) was required for the powerful apoptosis induction by CD8-C, we reasoned that dimerization was critical in promoting association and processing of the caspase precursors into an active form. To assess whether CD8-C had undergone dimerization, we analyzed detergent lysates from 293T cells that were transfected with a construct expressing a CD8-C linked to GFP (24Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar) (CD8-C-GFP), either alone or together with constructs expressing CD8-empty or an inactive CD8-C without the GFP tag (CD8-C:D210A/D216A, see below). Western blots with an anti-GFP mAb showed that CD8-C-GFP formed an apparent dimer complex (molecular mass = 170 kDa, lane 4) in nonreducing conditions, but only monomers (molecular mass = 85 kDa) in reducing conditions (Fig. 3 A). Coexpression of CD8-C-GFP and either an inactive CD8-C chain without the GFP tag or CD8-empty caused a decrease in the CD8-C-GFP homodimer and the appearance of apparent heterodimer complexes (molecular mass = 142 kDa, lanes 1, 2, and 5), which was absent without CD8-C-GFP. Similar results were obtained with coexpression of CD8-C-GFP and CD8-empty, with smaller heterodimeric complexes. Thus, consistent with the formation of disulfide-linked homodimers by native CD8α (15Irving B.A. Weiss A. Cell. 1991; 64: 891-901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 16Leahy D.J. Axel R. Hendrickson W.A. Cell. 1992; 68: 1145-1162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), the CD8-C chimera formed dimers with itself and other CD8α expression proteins. To determine if dimerization was essential for caspase activation, we tested whether coexpression of CD8-empty or an inactive CD8-C chimera (D210A/D216A, see below) dominantly interfered with the ability of CD8-C to induce apoptosis. Cotransfection of these constructs confirmed this prediction (Fig. 3 B). We found that either CD8-empty or an inactive CD8-C chimera blocked the lethality of CD8-C in a dose-response fashion (Fig. 3 B). We next investigated how enzymatic processing of CD8-C could lead to apoptosis. With a single nucleotide change, we substituted serine for the catalytic site cysteine (CD8-C:C360S). This change completely abrogated apoptosis, indicating that the active site cysteine was indispensable (Fig. 4 A). We therefore assessed the functional importance of aspartate residues that reside at the site for cleaving the prodomain from the caspase domain (which have been preserved in both the CD8-C and Tac-C constructs) by mutations. We found that the substitution of alanines for the Asp210 and Asp216 residues unexpectedly blocked apoptosis by CD8-C (Figs. 1 and 4 C). The two aspartates were not equivalently important, since the D216A mutation only modestly reduced apoptosis, whereas mutation of Asp210 or both Asp210 and Asp216 completely inhibited apoptosis (Fig. 4 B). This striking effect was also observed with the corresponding mutations in the Tac-C chimera (Fig. 4 C and data not shown). Additionally we performed a Western blot of 293T cells transiently transfected with either CD8-C or the double mutant CD8-C D210/216A using a mAb specific for caspase-8 to examine processing of the caspase chimera. The wild-type CD8-C underwent cleavage into processed fragments, which were released into the soluble cytosolic fraction, whereas the double mutant chimera did not (Fig. 4 D). No cleavage products were found in the membrane-associated pellet for either the wild-type or mutant molecules (data not shown). Thus, even with an intact catalytic site cysteine, the lethality of the CD8-C or Tac-C chimeras is lost if the caspase cannot be proteolytically cleaved at the point of its association with the membrane. Caspase activation is a crucial biochemical event involved in most, if not all, forms of apoptosis, so it is of central importance to understand the activation requirements of these enzymes (1Nicholson D. Thornberry N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar, 2Miller D.K. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Our results show that membrane-associated oligomerization of caspase-8, the most proximal caspase in the CD95 signal cascade, is sufficient to powerfully induce apoptosis in several different cell types. Although previous studies have detected the cleaved caspase-8 prodomain in the “DISC” proteins aggregated with the cytoplasmic tail of CD95, these studies were limited by the fact that they did not determine the stoichiometry of the proteins to know if oligomerization of multiple caspase-8 molecules was likely to have occurred (8Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kishchekel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M.

Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4961-4965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the previous two-dimensional gel analyses were descriptive and did not directly test the necessity of cleavage at various aspartate residues for apoptosis induction. Our data address these issues and suggest that there are two critical steps in the caspase-8 death pathway. First, we have shown that oligomerization is sufficient to activate the enzyme. Homodimers of the wild-type CD8-caspase induced death, whereas heterodimers between the wild-type and an inactive CD8 construct were unable to stimulate death. Second, we have shown that proteolytic cleavage of the active caspase at the point of its membrane association was also required. Death induced by the caspase chimera occurred spontaneously without cross-linking of the CD8 extracellular domain. Also our results suggest that apart from the ability of CD95 and FADD/MORT1 to bring the caspase-8 molecules together, the DISC complex is not required for autocatalytic activation. Thus our data suggest that dimerization of caspases favors the spontaneous generation of an unstable, but active, conformation that can initiate autoprocessing into a thermodynamically more stable caspase. Although our experiments demonstrate that membrane-linked oligomerization causes activation, it is very likely that oligomerization of the enzyme within the cytosol may also strongly activate caspase activity. The crystal structures of active caspase tetramers show that each partner in a pair of large or small subunit chains is positioned antiparallel with respect to the other (25Rotonda J. Nicholson D.W. Fazil K.M. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Labelle M. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Ruel R. Vaillancourt J.P. Thornberry N.A. Becker J.W. Nat. Struct.

Cell. 1994; 78: 343-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Since our chimeras constrain the N termini of the precursors in a parallel relationship, the initial active pseudoconformation is likely to differ significantly from the final mature structure. Interestingly, despite the trimeric symmetry of tumor necrosis factor receptor and CD95 (27Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar), CD8 dimers appear to be sufficient for caspase-8 activation. A dimer could allow p18 and p11 subunits from two chains to form an enzyme tetramer. Alternatively, dimers may enhance the cross-cleavage of precursor chains either by creating proximity, inducing a favorable orientation for processing, or by preventing the association of endogenous inhibitory proteins, such as cellular FLIP (28Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J.

Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11333-11338Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Importantly, we find that death programmed by caspase-8 dimerization is resistant to Bcl-2, which could explain the apparent resistance of CD95-induced apoptosis to Bcl-2 inhibition in many cell types (30Strasser A. Harris A.W. Huang D.C. Krammer P.H. Cory S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6136-6147Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 31Memon S.A. Moreno M.B. Petrak D. Zacharchuk C.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4644-4652PubMed Google Scholar). Although proteolytic separation of caspase-8 from its prodomain in the DISC complex has been observed after prolonged treatment with anti-CD95 antibody (11Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4961-4965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), the necessity of this event was unknown. We found that substitution of alanines for the aspartates at the junction between the prodomain and the caspase domain (D210A/D216A) completely blocked apoptosis. We show that the D210A/D216A double mutant also gave no evidence of processing, although we could not evaluate cleavage between p18 and p10, because the antibody used was directed against the p18 subunit. However, we have found that D374A/D384A mutants that prevent cleavage between p18 and p10 do not abrogate apoptosis (data not shown). Thus, proteolysis at D210/D216 plays a critical role that is different than other processing events. A leading possibility is that release of the active caspase from membrane association is important for apoptosis. Detachment of the caspase from the membrane may release the mature enzyme into the cytoplasm where it may catabolize apoptosis substrates that could be sequestered away from the cell membrane. Alternatively, cleavage away from the prodomain may also increase the enzymatic activity or stability; however, enzymatic activity has been found to be associated with the DISC complex (12Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Unlike other membrane signaling pathways such as phosphorylation or inositol phosphate generation, caspase-8 processing is an irreversible signal that commits the cell's fate to apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2067378334,"Translation in eukaryotic cells is generally initiated by ribosome scanning from the 5′ end of the capped mRNA. However, initiation of translation may also occur by a mechanism which is independent of the cap structure and in this case ribosomes are directed to the start codon by an internal ribosome entry segment (IRES). Picornaviruses represent the paradigm for this mechanism, but only a few examples exist which show that this mechanism is used by eukaryotic cells. In this report we show data which demonstrate that the 5′ UTR of the proto-oncogene c-myc contains an IRES. When a dicistronic reporter vector, with c-myc 5′ UTR inserted between the two cistrons, was transfected into both HepG2 and HeLa cells, the translation of the downstream cistron was increased by 50-fold, demonstrating that translational regulation of c-myc is mediated through cap-independent mechanisms. This is the first example of a proto-oncogene regulated in this manner and suggests that aberrant translational regulation of c-myc is likely to play a role in tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2029192858,"A unique feature of p21 that distinguishes it from the other cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors is its ability to associate with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an auxiliary factor for DNA polymerases delta and epsilon. While it is now well established that inhibition of cyclin/CDK complexes by p21 can result in G1 cell cycle arrest, the consequences of p21/PCNA interaction on cell cycle progression have not yet been determined. Here, we show, using a tetracycline-regulated system, that expression of wild-type p21 in p53-deficient DLD1 human colon cancer cells inhibits DNA synthesis and causes G1 and G2 cell cycle arrest. Similar effects are observed in cells expressing p21CDK-, a mutant impaired in the interaction with CDKs, but not in cells expressing p21PCNA-, a mutant deficient for the interaction with PCNA. Analysis of cells treated with a p21-derived PCNA-binding peptide provides additional evidence that the growth inhibitory effects of p21 and p21CDK result from their ability to bind to PCNA. Our results suggest that p21 might inhibit cell cycle progression by two independent mechanisms, inhibition of cyclin/CDK complexes, and inhibition of PCNA function resulting in both G1 and G2 arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2331160070,"It has recently been shown that an adenovirus mutant lacking expression of the large E1B protein (ΔE1B) selectively replicates in p53 deficient cells. However, apart from the large E1B protein the adenovirus early region encodes the E1A and E4orf6 proteins which also have been reported to affect p53 expression as well as its functioning. After infection with wild-type adenovirus we observed a dramatic decrease in wild-type p53 expression while no down-regulation of p53 could be detected after infection with the ΔE1B virus. The different effects of the wild-type and ΔE1B adenovirus on p53 expression were not only found in cells expressing wild-type p53 but were also observed when tumor cells expressing highly stabilized mutant p53 were infected with these two viruses. Infection with different adenovirus mutants indicated the importance of a direct interaction between p53 and the large E1B protein for reduced p53 expression after infection. Moreover, coexpression of the E4orf6 protein was found to be required for this phenomenon, while expression of E1A is dispensable. In addition, we provide evidence that p53 is actively degraded in wild-type adenovirus-infected cells but not in ΔE1B-infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2027573743,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placenta growth factor (PlGF) are structurally related growth factors for endothelial cells. VEGF binds to the related receptor tyrosine kinases Flt 1 and KDR/Flk 1 with high affinity, whereas PlGF binds only to Flt 1. Ligand-stimulated KDR is known to transduce signals for cellular activity such as proliferation and migration, whereas weak or no responses have been recorded for Flt 1. We examined VEGF and PlGF for their capacity to stimulate signal transduction in porcine aortic endothelial cells expressing Flt 1 or KDR. VEGF had essentially no effect on Flt 1 expressing cells, but induced DNA synthesis and migration of KDR expressing cells. PlGF on the other hand induced DNA synthesis but not migration of the Flt 1 cells. In agreement, MAP kinase, examined as a marker for DNA synthesis, was activated both by VEGF-stimulation of the KDR cells and by PlGF-stimulation of the Flt 1 cells. In contrast, phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ), was tyrosine phosphorylated only in VEGF stimulated KDR cells, and not in the PlGF-stimulated Flt 1 cells, which is in agreement with a role for PLC-γ in cellular migration. We furthermore examined induction of protein levels of plasminogen activator (PA), which was evident in the PlGF-stimulated Flt 1 cells, but not in the VEGF-stimulated KDR cells. These data show that Flt 1 is able to mediate an array of biological signals when appropriately stimulated and that the pattern of responses of PlGF-stimulation of Flt 1 is distinct from the pattern of responses to VEGF-stimulation of KDR."

MCP-2, similar to MCP-3, is chemotactic for and activates a wide variety of inflammatory cells, including monocytes, T lymphocytes, NK cells, basophils, mast cells, and eosinophils (12Proost P. Wuyts A. Van Damme J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), but differs from MCP-1, which is not active on eosinophils (13Dahinden C.A. Geiser T.

In the course of studies on leukocyte activation by MCP-2, we observed that MCP-2 could competitively inhibit the binding to monocytes of125I-MIP-1β, a CC chemokine that is believed thus far to exclusively use CCR5 as a functional receptor on human leukocytes (15Samson M.

We report that MCP-2 is also an efficient ligand for CCR5 and a potent inhibitor of CD4/CCR5-mediated HIV-1 entry/replication. Recombinant human (rh) MCP-2 and other chemokines were purchased from PeproTech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Radioiodinated MCP-2 was a kind gift from Dr. G. Brown (NEN Life Science Products). Other radioiodinated chemokines were purchased from NEN. All radioiodinated chemokines have a specific activity of 2200 Ci/mmol. Human peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from normal donors (National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Transfusion Department, Bethesda, MD) with an iso-osmotic Percoll (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) gradient as described elsewhere (18Xu L.L.

The 293 human embryonic kidney epithelial cell line stably transfected with FLAG-tagged CCR5 (CCR5/293) was generated and grown in monolayers as described (17Raport C.J. Gosling J. Schweickart V.L. Gray P.W. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17161-17166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Binding assays were performed by using a single concentration of radiolabeled chemokines in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligands as described previously (14Gong X. Gong W.

Cells (2 × 106/sample for monocytes and 1 × 106/sample for CCR5/293 cells) were suspended in 200 μl of modified binding medium composed of RPMI 1640, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 mm HEPES, and 0.05% sodium azide and incubated in duplicates at room temperature for 40 min. After incubation, the cells were pelleted through a 10% sucrose/phosphate-buffered saline cushion, and the radioactivity associated with cell pellets was determined in a γ-counter (Clinigamma-Pharmacia, Gaithersburg, MD). Experiments were also performed at 4 °C in the absence of sodium azide and yielded similar binding and competition curves as obtained at room temperature. The binding data were then analyzed with a Macintosh computer program LIGAND (P. Munson, Division of Computer Research and Technology, NIH, Bethesda, MD). The degree of competition for binding by unlabeled chemokines was calculated as follows: % competition for binding = 1 − (cpm obtained in the presence of unlabeled ligand/cpm obtained in the absence of unlabeled ligand) × 100. The migration of HEK 293 cells transfected with cDNA clones was assessed by a 48-well microchamber technique (14Gong X. Gong W. Kuhns D.B. Ben-Baruch A. Howard O.M.Z. Wang J.M. J. Biol.

The CCR5/293 cells (50 μl, 0.5–1 × 106/ml) were loaded in the upper wells. The lower and upper wells were separated by a polycarbonate filter (polyvinylpyrrolidone-free, 10-μm pore size; Poretics, CA) precoated with 20 μg/ml mouse collagen type IV or 50 μg/ml collagen type 1 for 2 h at 37 °C. The chamber was incubated at 37 °C for 5 h in humidified air with 5% CO2. At the end of the incubation, after removal of nonmigrating cells, the filter was fixed and stained with Diff-Quik (Biochemical Sciences, NJ). The cells migrating across the filter were counted in three high power fields under light microscopy in triplicates with all samples coded. The chemotaxis index was calculated as the number of cells migrating to chemokines/number of cells migrating to medium. The significance of the difference between test and control groups was analyzed by paired Student's t test. CCR5/293 cells were pretreated for 3 h at 37 °C with PMA (100 nm), RANTES, IL-8 (120 nm), or different concentrations of MCP-2. The cells were centrifuged on to slides and permeabilized using 0.15% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline. The slides were then stained with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M1, Kodak, New Heaven, CT) followed by incubation with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2fragments. Slides were examined using a Zeiss 310 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (Carl Zeiss). Nomarski and FITC (488 nm, green) images were prepared for each specimen, and fluorescent images were superimposed on Nomarski images. CCR5/293 cells were co-transfected using electroporation with a CD4 expression vector (fragment excised from pTB4, NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Bethesda, MD) and cloned into a plasmid vector, pSVZeo (Invitrogen, CA). 24 h after electroporation, the cells (CCR5/CD4/293) were plated at a density of 105/well in 24-well plate for 24 h. The culture media were removed, and the cells were preincubated for 30 min with 800 ng/ml recombinant human MCP-2 or RANTES. The monocyte tropic HIV-1ada was added at a final multiplicity of infection between 1 and 0.1. Cultures were continued for 24 h and washed, and total genomic DNA was isolated and purified (20Howard O.M.Z. Kirken R.A. Garcia G.G. Hackett R.H. Farrar W.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). HIV-1 entry/reverse transcription was monitored by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers specific for HIV-1gag region to detect late reverse transcription products (21Zack J.A. Arrigo A.J. Weitsman S.R. Go A.S. Haislip A. Chen I.S.Y. Cell. 1990; 61: 213-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Two primers are as follows: M667 corresponds to nucleotide positions 496–516 in the HIV-1JR-CSF sequence; M661 (antisense) corresponds to the positions 695–672. PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gels and photodocumented after ethidium bromide staining. No PCR products were detected in CCR5/CD4/293 cells infected by the lymphocyte tropic virus HIV-1RF nor in CCR5/293 cells without CD4 coexpression incubated with HIV-1ada. Recombinant human MCP-2 is a potent monocyte chemoattractant and has been shown to activate at least two promiscuous CC chemokines receptors, CCR1 and CCR2B (14Gong X. Gong W. Kuhns D.B. Ben-Baruch A. Howard O.M.Z. Wang J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11682-11685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The binding of 125I-labeled MCP-2 to human monocytes was of high affinity and was efficiently competed by MCP-1, which is a ligand for CCR2B. MCP-3, which uses both CCR1 and CCR2B, also efficiently competed with MCP-2 for binding to monocytes. MIP-1α and RANTES, two ligands for both CCR1 and CCR5, partially competed with MCP-2 for binding to monocytes, whereas MIP-1β, which only uses CCR5, had no effect (14Gong X. Gong W. Kuhns D.B. Ben-Baruch A. Howard O.M.Z. Wang J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11682-11685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We further observed that although unlabeled MIP-1β did not competitively inhibit MCP-2 binding to monocytes, the binding of 125I-MIP-1β was completely inhibitable by unlabeled MCP-2 (IC50 = 2.9 nm versus 1.7 nm for unlabeled MIP-1β itself, Fig. 1). In contrast, the binding of 125I-MIP-1β to monocytes was only partially but significantly displaced by unlabeled MCP-1 at high concentrations (IC50 = 425 nm), in agreement with our earlier observations (22Wang J.M. Sherry B. Kelvin D.J. Oppenheim J.J. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3022-3029PubMed Google Scholar). There was no significant difference between the competition curves yielded at room temperature (Fig. 1 A) and at 4 °C (Fig. 1 B). The uni-directional inhibition of MIP-1β binding to monocytes by MCP-2 prompted us to investigate whether MCP-2, in addition to using CCR1 and CCR2B as functional receptors, also uses CCR5. HEK293 cells stably expressing CCR5 (CCR5/293) showed a high level of specific binding for125I-MIP-1β that was competitively inhibited by MCP-2 either at room temperature (Fig. 2 A) or at 4 °C (Fig. 2 B). Unlabeled MIP-1α also completely inhibited125I-MIP-1β binding (Fig. 2). These results suggest that MCP-2 has the capacity to interact with CCR5 on HEK293 cells with an efficacy similar to known CCR5 ligands such as MIP-1β and MIP-1α.Figure 2Competition of 125I-MIP-1β binding to CCR5/293 cells by MCP-2. Aliquots of CCR5/293 cells (1 × 106/200 μl) were incubated with 0.12 nm of 125I-MIP-1β in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled chemokines. The binding assays were performed at room temperature (A) or at 4 °C in the absence of sodium azide (B). Results from one experiment out of five performed are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Further support for the ability of MCP-2 to interact with CCR5 was obtained with binding studies using 125I-MCP-2. As shown in Fig. 3, 125I-MCP-2 specifically bound to CCR5/293 cells with an estimatedKd in the 5 nm range (Fig. 3 A). The binding of 125I-MCP-2 to CCR5/293 cells was efficiently inhibited by unlabeled MIP-1β and RANTES (Fig. 3 B) but less effectively by MCP-1 and MCP-3, which in contrast were able to completely displace MCP-2 binding to CCR1 and CCR2B (14Gong X.

Thus, MCP-2 possesses binding domains for interaction with CCR5 in addition to CCR1 and CCR2B. This was supported by the observations that although MCP-1, MCP-2 and MCP-3 are all functional ligands for CCR2B, the binding of MCP-1 on CCR2B was poorly competed for by MCP-2 or MCP-3 (14Gong X.

Because promiscuity is a common feature of chemokines and their receptors (24Kelvin D.J. Michiel D.F. Johnston J.A. Lloyd A.R. Sprenger H. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J.

We next determined the functional role of MCP-2 on CCR5. Both rhMCP-2 and rhMIP-1β are poor Ca2+ mobilizers in monocytes (18Xu L.L. McVicar D.W. Ben-Baruch A. Kuhns D.B. Johnston J. Oppenheim J.J.

We therefore utilized chemotaxis assays, which in our previous studies were demonstrated to be very sensitive and reproducible in assessing the activity of a chemokine on a given receptor (14Gong X.

CCR5/293 cells showed a significant chemotactic response to MCP-2 and MIP-1β (Fig. 4), yielding a typical bell-shaped dose response. MCP-2 was similar in potency to MIP-1β with an almost 6-fold increase over medium control at 1.2–6 nmconcentration range, but it was less efficacious (EC50: MCP-2, 0.12 nm; MIP-1β, 0.04 nm, respectively) in inducing CCR5/HEK293 cell migration. Other chemokines known to activate CCR5, such as MIP-1α and RANTES also bound to and induced considerable chemotactic migration of CCR5/293 cells. Although MCP-1 partially displaced MCP-2 binding to CCR5/293 cells, it only bound to and induced migration of CCR2B/293 but not CCR5/293 cells (data not shown). Likewise, MCP-3 also partially displaced MCP-2 binding to CCR5/293 cells; we did not detect significant binding of125I-MCP-3 to the same cells, nor did it induce migration of CCR5/293 cells at a wide range of concentrations (data not shown). Further proof of the activation of CCR5 by MCP-2 is provided by confocal microscopy (Fig. 5) in which MCP-2 markedly and dose-dependently induced CCR5 internalization in CCR5/293 cells. Another CCR5 ligand RANTES and PMA, a potent protein kinase C activator, similarly caused internalization of CCR5. In contrast, CXC chemokine IL-8, which uses CXCR1 and CXCR2 as functional receptors, did not induce CCR5 internalization (Fig. 5).Figure 5Internalization of CCR5 by pretreatment of CCR5/293 cells with MCP-2.

Science. 1995; 270: 1811-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (2644) Google Scholar) led us to question whether MCP-2 similarly could inhibit HIV-1 entry and replication. The susceptibility to HIV-1 infection of CCR5/CD4/293 cells was determined in the presence or the absence of MCP-2 (Fig. 6). Preincubation of CCR5/CD4/293 cells with either 800 ng/ml MCP-2 or RANTES completely inhibited HIV-1 entry and subsequent reverse transcription. No reverse transcription products were detected in CCR5/CD4/293 cells treated with HIV-1RF, a T lymphocyte tropic strain (data not shown). CCR5/293 cells without CD4 were not infected by HIV-1ada. Therefore, the ability of MCP-2 to internalize CCR5 confers on it the ability to interrupt virus entry, with an antiviral activity equivalent to RANTES. MCP-2 also appears to be a natural inhibitor of CD4/CCR5-mediated HIV-1 entry/replication in host cells in addition to MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES (6Bleul C.C. Farzan M. Choe H. Parolin C.

Gong W. Wang J.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Therefore, MCP-2 may play an important role in recruiting/activating immune cells at inflammatory and neoplastic foci. In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time using cloned CCR5 that MCP-2 is a highly efficacious ligand for this receptor in addition to CCR1 and CCR2B (14Gong X. Gong W. Kuhns D.B.

https://openalex.org/W2072830896,"Tamoxifen is currently the most widely used drug for the treatment of breast cancer, but there now exists considerable evidence that tamoxifen can also induce endometrial hyperplasia in pre menopausal women. We have used PCR differential display on primary human endometrial isolates in an attempt to identify genes induced by tamoxifen but not estrogen. Eight such differentially expressed bands were cloned and sequenced, one of which was found to be the peptide adrenomedullin. We have shown that adrenomedullin is a novel growth factor for endothelial cells and is angiogenic in vivo in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. Immunohistochemical analysis of endometrial sections have shown that while macrophages in the endometrium express adrenomedullin at a low level, endometrial macrophages of women receiving tamoxifen strongly express adrenomedullin (P=0.008). We postulate that endometrial induction of the angiogenic factor adrenomedullin by tamoxifen is part of the mechanism by which tamoxifen results in endometrial hyperplasia."

Here we show that the selectivity-determining pore region of the voltage-gated potassium channel of human heart through which the IKs current passes includes the transmembrane segment of the non-P-loop protein minK. Two adjacent residues in this segment of minK are exposed in the pore on either side of a short barrier that restricts the movement of sodium, cadmium and zinc ions across the membrane. Thus, potassium-selective pores are not restricted to P loops or a strict P-loop geometry."
https://openalex.org/W2313061021,"The molecular mechanisms leading to Cushing's disease are unclear. Inhibitors of cyclin-cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) complexes are regulators of the cell cycle and may function as tumour suppressor genes, many of which have been involved in the pathogenesis of several human malignancies. A member of this family, the p27/kip1 gene, maps to chromosome 12p13 and encodes an inhibitor of several cyclin-CDK complexes; these control the progression of the cell cycle from G1 to S-phase. Complete lack of p27/kip1 function, as occurs in the p27/kip1 `knockout' mouse, produces a complex phenotype associated with the development of pituitary tumours, specifically those of the intermediate lobe corticotrophs. We therefore investigated whether structural and functional abnormalities of the p27/kip1 gene and loss at the chromosome 12p13 region were present in human corticotrophin (ACTH)-secreting pituitary tumours. We studied 21 pituitary tumours, of which 20 were ACTH-secreting (two of these had biochemical and histological features of `intermediate-lobe' tumours and one was malignant) while the remaining tumour was a prolactinoma; three ectopic secretors of ACTH (two bronchial and one thymic carcinoid); and a non-secretory thymic carcinoid. The whole coding region of the p27/kip1 gene was screened for mutations by PCR – SSCP analysis and/or direct sequencing, while tumour mRNA expression was analysed by means of a semi-quantitative duplex PCR. Three polymorphic microsatellite markers of the 12p13 region were used to assess loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 12 samples. Finally, tumour p27/kip1 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody in 12 samples suitable for analysis. No sequence abnormalities were found in any of the samples other than a previously-described polymorphism. No LOH was observed in the tumours analysed. p27/kip1 mRNA expression was similar in tumour samples in comparison with normal pituitaries. Seven of the eight corticotroph tumours analysed by immunohistochemistry stained positive for p27/kip1, including the intermediate lobe. The only malignant pituitary tumour in the original series showed an absence of staining for p27/kip1. In addition, the three carcinoid tumours studied were negative on immunohistochemistry. Of a further three malignant pituitary tumours assessed, two (including a prolactinoma) were essentially negative, while the third was moderately positive. We conclude that mutations of the p27/kip1 gene, deletions of the 12p13 area or changes in expression, are not a general feature of corticotroph tumours, even those with intermediate lobe characteristics. However, other mechanisms of p27/kip1 inactivation, such as an abnormality at the post-translational level, may be related to more aggressive histological subtypes of ACTH-secreting and possibly other pituitary tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2318183382,"The hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is the chimeric tyrosine kinase oncogene bcr-abl. Since expression of bcr-abl mRNA frequently increases with disease progression and a duplication of the Philadelphia chromosome (harbouring the bcr-abl hybrid locus) represents the most frequent karyotypic abnormality in acute phase CML, we hypothesized that the level of BCR-ABL protein may affect the disease phenotype. Therefore, the biological effects of high and low levels of BCR-ABL expression were compared in growth factor-dependent and -independent myeloid and lymphoid cell lines. Our results demonstrated that low levels of BCR - ABL were sufficient to render these cell lines growth factor independent and tumorigenic, but higher levels were mandatory for additional protection against apoptotic stimuli. The provision of growth factor or an activated ras oncogene did not afford the same degree of protection as high levels of BCR-ABL and there were qualitative differences between the survival signals mediated by BCR-ABL and Bcl-2. These results have enabled us to establish a dose-dependent hierarchy of BCR-ABL induced biological effects, thus distinguishing the activation of pathways mediating protection from cytokine withdrawal from those protecting against other apoptotic stimuli."

The purified protein showed a minimum Mr of about 140 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and we named it ABP140. A search with the partial amino acid sequences of ABP140 against the Saccharomyces Genome Database revealed that the open reading frame of the ABP140 gene (ABP140) corresponded to YOR239W fused with YOR240W by the +1 translational frame shift. The encoded protein consisted of 628 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 71,484. The recombinant protein interacted with F-actin and showed the activity to crosslink F-actin into a bundle. Indirect immunofluorescence study demonstrated that ABP140 was colocalized with both cortical actin patches and cytoplasmic actin cables in intact cells. However, elimination of ABP140 by gene disruption did not show a deleterious effect on cell growth or affect the organization of F-actin. These results indicate that ABP140 is not required for cell growth but may be involved in the reorganization of F-actin in the budding yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2042225491,"We provide genetic evidence that the production of methanol in tomato fruit is regulated by pectin methylesterase (PME, EC 3.1.1.11), an enzyme that catalyzes demethoxylation of pectins. The role of PME in methanol production in tomato fruit was examined by relating the tissue methanol content to the PME enzymatic activity in wild-type Rutgers and isogenic PME antisense fruits with lowered PME activity. In the wild-type, fruit development and ripening were accompanied by an increase in the abundance of PME protein and activity and a corresponding ripening-related increase in methanol content. In the PME antisense pericarp, the level of methanol was greatly reduced in unripe fruit, and diminished methanol content persisted throughout the ripening process. The close correlation between PME activity and levels of methanol in fruit tissues from wild-type and a PME antisense mutant indicates that PME is the primary biosynthetic pathway for methanol production in tomato fruit. Interestingly, ethanol levels that were low and unchanged during ripening of wild-type tomatoes increased progressively with the ripening of PME antisense fruit. In vitro studies indicate that methanol is a competitive inhibitor of the tomato alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH, EC 1.1.1.1) activity suggesting that ADH-catalyzed production of ethanol may be arrested by methanol accumulation in the wild-type but not in the PME mutant where methanol levels remain low."

https://openalex.org/W1981823925,"The mouse homologues of the breast cancer susceptibility genes, Brca1 and Brca2, are expressed in a cell cycle-dependent fashion in vitro and appear to be regulated by similar or overlapping pathways. Therefore, we compared the non isotopic in situ hybridization expression patterns of Brca1 and Brca2 mRNA in vivo in mitotic and meiotic cells during mouse embryogenesis, mammary gland development, and in adult tissues including testes, ovaries, and hormonally altered ovaries. Brca1 and Brca2 are expressed concordantly in proliferating cells of embryos, and the mammary gland undergoing morphogenesis and in most adult tissues. The expression pattern of Brca1 and Brca2 correlates with the localization of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, an indicator of proliferative activity. In the ovary, Brca1 and Brca2 exhibited a comparable hormone-independent pattern of expression in oocytes, granulosa cells and thecal cells of developing follicles. In the testes, Brca1 and Brca2 were expressed in mitotic spermatogonia and early meiotic prophase spermatocytes. Northern analyses of prepubertal mouse testes revealed that the time course of Brca2 expression was delayed in spermatogonia relative to Brca1. Thus, while Brca1 and Brca2 share concordant cell-specific patterns of expression in most proliferating tissues, these observations suggest that they may have distinct roles during meiosis."

We have employed antibodies to these GPs to investigate further their role in platelet adhesion to immobilized monomeric and polymeric fibrillar collagen under static conditions in the presence and the absence of Mg2+. In the presence of Mg2+, each antibody inhibited platelet adhesion to fibrillar collagen from 70 to 85%, especially during the early phase (<15 min), but the inhibitory effects diminished dramatically to 25% or less by 60 min. Combination of anti-GPVI with anti-GPIa-IIa antibodies completely inhibited platelet adhesion at 60 min.

Although anti-GPVI antibodies were not able to inhibit Mg2+-dependent adhesion, they completely inhibited TXA2 generation under both divalent cation-dependent and -independent conditions.

Collagen has been identified to be the most thrombogenic of all the macromolecular constituents present in the extracellular matrix underlying the subendothelium. Besides supporting adhesion, it is also capable of inducing secretion and the subsequent platelet aggregation that is crucial in the maintenance of hemostatic function (1Baumgartner H.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1977; 37: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Elucidation of the mechanism by which unactivated platelets initially recognize fibrillar collagen and initiate the subsequent platelet activation is essential for the understanding of hemostatic functions. Both monomeric and fibrillar collagens effectively support platelet adhesion, whereas the polymerization of the monomeric collagen is required to activate platelets and induce secretion of their granule contents (2Santoro S.A.

Over the years, numerous candidates have been proposed for platelet-collagen receptors, probably reflecting the range of techniques that have been used to study this phenomenon (6Santoro S.A. Jamieson G.A. Molecular Basis of Platelet Adhesion to Collagen, in Platelet Membrane Receptors. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York, NY1988: 291-314Google Scholar).

Three glycoproteins (GPs) 1The abbreviations used are: GP, glycoprotein; TXA2 and TXB2, thromboxane A2 and B2, respectively; PF4, platelet factor 4; β-TG, β-thromboglobulin; Fabs, Fab fragments. have been accepted as major collagen receptors on platelets that meet most if not all of the seven criteria proposed for a collagen receptor; these are α2β1 integrin (GPIa-IIa), CD36 (GPIV, also known as GPIIIb), and GPVI. However, the role played by individual GPs in the overall adhesive interactions of platelets with collagen and their possible interdependence are not fully understood. Another collagen receptor has recently been identified in human platelets. A recombinant receptor protein (54 kDa), obtained by using a prokaryotic expression system, reacted specifically with type I collagen but not with type III collagen (8Chiang T.M. Rinaldy A. Kang A.H.

Subsequent studies in two patients revealed, however, that the defect in these platelets was not in their ability to adhere to collagen following contact but in their ability to spread on collagen following their initial adherence (10Kehrel B.

J. 1990; 268: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that is not inhibited by anti-GPIa-IIa antibodies (18Morton L.F. Zijenah L.S. McCulloch I.Y. Knight C.G. Barnes M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 439SCrossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Fab fragments of polyclonal antibodies against GPIV have been shown to partly inhibit platelet adhesion to fibrillar collagen (7Tandon N.N. Kralisz U. Jamieson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7576-7583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of GPIV in adhesive interactions of platelets with collagen was further confirmed (19Tandon N.N. Ockenhouse C.F. Greco N.J. Jamieson G.A. Blood. 1991; 78: 2809-2813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by the use of platelets of the Naka-negative phenotype, which constitutively lack GPIV (20Yamamoto N. Ikeda H. Tandon N.N. Herman J. Tomiyama Y. Mitani T. Sekiguchi S. Lipsky R. Kralisz U. Jamieson G.A. Blood. 1990; 76: 1698-1703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In comparison with control platelets, Naka-negative platelets showed significantly reduced platelet adhesion to acid-insoluble type I fibrillar collagen, especially at early time points (19Tandon N.N. Ockenhouse C.F. Greco N.J. Jamieson G.A. Blood. 1991; 78: 2809-2813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Diaz-Ricart M. Tandon N.N. Carretero M. Ordinas A. Bastida E. Jamieson G.A. Blood. 1993; 82: 491-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets from Naka-negative donors also showed reduced adhesion to type IV collagen under both flow and static conditions but responded normally with collagens type I and III (22Saelman E.U. Kehrel B. Hese K.M. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Blood. 1994; 83: 3240-3244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several Japanese patients with mild bleeding disorders have been described whose platelets failed to aggregate in response to collagen. Analysis of the membrane glycoproteins in these patients revealed that their platelets either lacked GPVI or had very little of it (23Moroi M. Jung S.M. Okuma M. Shinmyozu K. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1440-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 24Arai M. Yamamoto N. Moroi M. Akamatsu N. Fukutake K. Tanoue K. Br. J.

Hematol. 1992; 39: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). One patient developed antibodies to GPVI after platelet transfusion. The intact IgG from the patient serum induced aggregation of normal platelets but not her own platelets, and the Fab fragments obtained from the patient's IgG inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation (26Sugiyama T. Okuma M. Ushikubi F. Sensaki S. Kanaji K. Uchino H. Blood. 1987; 69: 1712-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have utilized antibodies to these GPs to obtain more precise information about their roles in the adhesive interactions of platelets with acid-insoluble type I fibrillar collagen under static conditions. We have studied the effects of blocking two receptors simultaneously on divalent cation-dependent and -independent platelet adhesion as well as on the secretion of serotonin, platelet factor 4 (PF4), and β-thromboglobulin (β-TG) and the generation of TXA2. Our results suggest a direct association of GPVI with the TXA2 generation system. Acid-insoluble equine tendon fibrillar collagen (Chrono Par) was obtained from Chrono-Log Corp. (Broomall, PA). Acid-soluble rat tail type I collagen was purchased from Collaborative Biomedical Products Research (Bedford, MA). [2-14C]Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine creatinine sulfate; 58 mCi/mmol) and 51Cr (Na251CrO4; 250 mCi/mg) were purchased from Amersham Corp. Prostaglandin E1 was from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Enzyme immunoassay kits for thromboxane B2 were from PerSeptive Diagnostic, Inc. Kits for PF4 and β-TG were obtained from Diagnostica Stago (France). Bovine serum albumin and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Protein G affinity-purified mouse monoclonal antibody 6F1, directed against human platelet GPIa-IIa and recognizing the GPIa subunit, was generously provided by Dr. Barry S. Coller (Mount Sinai Medical School, New York). An unrelated mouse monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 subclass (clone MOPC 21) was purchased from Sigma. A monospecific polyclonal antibody to human platelet GPIV (antibody 916) was raised in New Zealand White rabbits as described previously (19Tandon N.N. Ockenhouse C.F. Greco N.J. Jamieson G.A. Blood. 1991; 78: 2809-2813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A monospecific antibody against GPVI was purified from the plasma of a patient with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura who had developed an autoantibody against GPVI (26Sugiyama T. Okuma M. Ushikubi F. Sensaki S. Kanaji K. Uchino H. Blood. 1987; 69: 1712-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fab fragments (Fabs) were prepared from the IgG fraction of the patient's plasma, from normal human plasma, and from the rabbit anti-GPIV serum by digestion with agarose-coupled papain utilizing an ImmunoPure Fab preparation kit (Pierce), principally according to the manufacturer's instructions but with slight modifications in the digestion temperature and the mode of shaking. In preliminary experiments using conditions suggested by the manufacturer, the resulting Fabs from the patient's IgG failed to block the aggregation of washed platelets by the intact IgG. In subsequent digestions, therefore, the IgG samples were digested at 35 °C in an oven with gentle rotation. The final product in each case was dialyzed extensively against HEPES-saline, pH 7.4. Fab fragments thus obtained retained their activity as judged by their ability to block aggregation of washed platelets induced by the corresponding intact IgG. Human blood was collected from healthy individuals who had not ingested any medication for at least 14 days prior to phlebotomy by the two-syringe method of venipuncture using a 19-gauge butterfly needle. Whole blood was collected directly into a syringe containing 3.8% sodium citrate as anticoagulant (9:1 whole blood/anticoagulant, v/v). Platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 150 × g for 20 min at room temperature. Washed platelets were prepared by the citrate wash method (19Tandon N.N. Ockenhouse C.F. Greco N.J. Jamieson G.A. Blood. 1991; 78: 2809-2813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, citrate-washed platelets were suspended in Tyrode-HEPES buffer (136.7 mm NaCl, 5.5 mm glucose, 2.6 mm KCl, 13.8 mm, NaHCO3, 1.0 mmMgCl2·6H2O, 0.36 mmNaH2PO4·H2O, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) at a concentration of 2 × 109platelets/ml. When required, platelets (1 × 109) were labeled with Na251CrO4 (50 μCi/ml) for 1 h at room temperature followed by washing twice with citrate wash buffer containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (19Tandon N.N. Ockenhouse C.F. Greco N.J. Jamieson G.A. Blood. 1991; 78: 2809-2813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To avoid platelet activation during washing and aggregation during adhesion assays, prostaglandin E1 (250 ng/ml) was included in all buffers used to prepare washed platelets and in subsequent operations. Microtiter wells were coated with type I acid-insoluble equine tendon fibrillar collagen or with acid-soluble rat tail type I collagen maintained under acid conditions to ensure maintenance of monomer structure. Divalent cation-free adhesion buffer was made by replacing Mg2+ (1 mm) in the Tyrode-HEPES buffer with 50 μm EDTA (19Tandon N.N. Ockenhouse C.F. Greco N.J. Jamieson G.A. Blood. 1991; 78: 2809-2813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).51Cr-Labeled platelets were suspended in divalent cation-free adhesion buffer or in Tyrode-HEPES at a cell concentration of 3 × 108/ml, and adhesion assays were carried out as described previously (19Tandon N.N. Ockenhouse C.F. Greco N.J. Jamieson G.A. Blood. 1991; 78: 2809-2813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For adhesion-induced secretion studies, washed platelets from a single donor were divided into two equal aliquots: one aliquot was labeled with 51Cr, while the other aliquot was labeled in parallel with [14C]serotonin. Washed platelets (1 × 109 cells/ml) were incubated with 14C-labeled serotonin (0.1 μCi/ml, 1 μm) for 60 min at room temperature. The unincorporated radioactivity was removed by washing the platelets twice with platelet wash buffer (19Tandon N.N. Ockenhouse C.F. Greco N.J. Jamieson G.A. Blood. 1991; 78: 2809-2813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets were finally suspended in Tyrode-HEPES buffer containing Mg2+ (1 mm) or EDTA (50 μm) and imipramine (1 μm) to stop the reuptake of released serotonin. An aliquot (50 μl) of serotonin-loaded platelets was added to individual collagen-coated wells. At the desired times, adhesion was stopped by removing nonadhered platelets by washing each well six times by decantation using 200-μl aliquots of Tyrode-HEPES buffer containing 1 mm MgCl2 or 50 μmEDTA (19Tandon N.N. Ockenhouse C.F. Greco N.J. Jamieson G.A. Blood. 1991; 78: 2809-2813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The adhered platelets were solubilized in SDS (2%) for 30 min, and their serotonin content was quantitated by counting the lysates in a β-counter (C). At the end of the incubation, an aliquot (50 μl) of unused platelet suspension was solubilized with an equal volume of SDS (2%) and counted (T). An aliquot of the supernatant obtained from the unused platelet suspension was also counted to determine the background radioactivity (B). The adhesion rate (R = percentage of adhesion × 0.01) was quantitated in parallel experiments using 51Cr-labeled platelets. The adhesion-induced serotonin release was calculated by the following equation. Secretion(%)=(T−B)×R−C(T−B)×R×100Equation 1 Levels of both PF4 and β-TG were measured in the supernatants of the adhered platelets by commercially available kits based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. At the desired times, nonadherent platelets were removed, and the wells were washed twice with wash buffer (200 μl). Suspensions of the nonadhered platelets and the two washes were combined and centrifuged at 6000 × g for 2 min to sediment the platelets, and the supernatants were immediately frozen. At the same time, an aliquot (50 μl) of unused platelet suspension was also frozen. Subsequently, all samples were thawed on ice and made 1% with respect to Triton X-100 by adding an equal volume of chilled Triton X-100 (2%) in Tyrode-HEPES buffer. After 1 h on ice, samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to sediment Triton X-100-insoluble components. PF4 and β-TG levels were measured in the supernatants according to the manufacturer's instructions. TXA2 was measured as TXB2, a stable metabolite of TXA2, by a commercially available kit. At the desired times, unadhered platelets and suspending medium were transferred to ice-cold tubes and centrifuged at 6000 × g for 2 min to sediment platelets. Clear supernatants were kept frozen until used. Eicosanoids were extracted from the supernatants in ethyl acetate (27Petroni A. Blasevich M. Salami M. Papini N. Montedoro G.F. Galli C. Thromb. Res. 1995; 78: 151-160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) prior to their quantitation by the immunosorbent assay kit. Briefly, the supernatants (100 μl) were acidified to a pH of 3–3.5 with formic acid (15 μl, 2.5%) and made 0.5 g/ml with respect to NaCl by the addition of 50 mg of solid NaCl to each tube, and eicosanoids were extracted twice with ethyl acetate (2.2 ml/extraction). Organic phases from two extractions were combined and vacuum-dried. Samples were reconstituted in kit buffer for assay and processed further according to the manufacturer's instructions. In preliminary experiments, extraction efficiency was determined by lacing the supernatants with known amounts of tritium-labeled TXB2 before extraction with ethyl acetate; 90–98% of the radioactivity was found in the organic phase. Platelets can interact with collagen by both divalent cation-dependent and -independent mechanisms (6Santoro S.A. Jamieson G.A. Molecular Basis of Platelet Adhesion to Collagen, in Platelet Membrane Receptors. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York, NY1988: 291-314Google Scholar,18Morton L.F. Zijenah L.S. McCulloch I.Y. Knight C.G.

Blood. 1991; 78: 2809-2813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adhesion assays were carried out by a previously published method (7Tandon N.N. Kralisz U. Jamieson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7576-7583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Matsuno K. Diaz-Ricart M. Montgomery R.R. Aster R.H. Jamieson G.A. Tandon N.N. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 92: 960-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) except that Tris-based buffer previously used to minimize platelet aggregation was replaced with Tyrode-HEPES buffer, since Tris slightly affects both the morphology (29Zucker W.H. Shermer R.W. Mason R.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1974; 77: 255-262PubMed Google Scholar) and responses of platelets (30Packham M.A. Guccione M.N. Kinlough-Rathbone R.L. Mustard J.F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1984; 51: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). HEPES-based adhesion buffer has been used successfully to study platelet adhesion to collagen and Matrigel-coated plastic wells (31Moroi M. Okuma M. Jung S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1137: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Divalent cation-dependent platelet adhesion was measured in the presence of Mg2+ (1 mm), while the divalent cation-independent adhesion was measured in its absence but in the presence of a small amount of EDTA (50 μm) to chelate minute amounts of divalent cations present in the water and the chemicals used to prepare buffers (19Tandon N.N. Ockenhouse C.F. Greco N.J. Jamieson G.A. Blood. 1991; 78: 2809-2813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Typical patterns of time-dependent platelet adhesion to type I acid-insoluble fibrillar collagen and acid-soluble monomeric collagen both under Mg2+-dependent and -independent conditions are shown in Fig. 1, a and b, respectively. Under these conditions, at the 60-min time point, the divalent cation-independent platelet adhesion was about one-fourth of the adhesion observed in the presence of Mg2+and was similar to that obtained using Tris-based buffers (19Tandon N.N. Ockenhouse C.F. Greco N.J. Jamieson G.A. Blood. 1991; 78: 2809-2813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, platelet adhesion to monomeric collagen was exclusively divalent cation-dependent, since no adhesion was observed in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 1 b). In preliminary studies, we determined the dose-dependent effect of each antibody on platelet adhesion to both the acid-insoluble fibrillar type I collagen from equine tendon and to acid-soluble monomeric type I collagen from rat tail. Adhesion was studied for 30 min both in the presence and absence of Mg2+. Since IgG fractions of both anti-GPIV and anti-GPVI antibodies induced aggregation of the washed platelets, Fab fragments were used in both cases. Maximal inhibition of divalent cation-independent platelet adhesion to acid-insoluble fibrillar type I collagen was obtained at 300 μg/ml Fab fragments of anti-GPIV and anti-GPVI. Mg2+-dependent adhesion was not affected by higher concentrations of these Fabs. Maximal inhibition of Mg2+-dependent adhesion to rat tail monomeric collagen was obtained at a concentration of 20 μg/ml of anti-GPIa-IIa IgG (6F1). In subsequent experiments, therefore, we used 6F1, anti-GPIV (916 Fab), and anti-GPVI (anti-p62 Fab) at 20, 300, and 300 μg/ml, respectively. In the presence of Mg2+, all three antibodies effectively inhibited platelet adhesion to acid-insoluble fibrillar collagen at the 15-min time point (Fig. 2 a). Both anti-GPIa-IIa and anti-GPVI inhibited adhesion by about 85%, while anti-GPIV inhibited adhesion by 70–75%. However, these inhibitory effects diminished with time. At the 60-min time point, anti-GPIa-IIa showed inhibition of ∼25% and anti-GPVI showed ∼15%, while anti-GPIV showed inhibition of only 5%. In the absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 2 b), anti-GPIa-IIa had minimal effects, while both anti-GPVI and anti-GPIV Fabs effectively inhibited platelet adhesion to fibrillar collagen at all time points examined. At 300 μg/ml, anti-GPVI Fabs inhibited adhesion completely, while anti-GPIV Fabs showed an inhibition of about 50%. Under each set of conditions, unrelated mouse IgG1 (clone MOPC 21) and control Fabs prepared from rabbit and human normal IgG used as negative controls were without effect (data not shown). We next examined the combined effects of these antibodies both under Mg2+-dependent and -independent conditions. In the presence of Mg2+, combinations of antibodies were significantly more effective in inhibiting platelet adhesion as compared with the individual antibody alone. Notably, the combination of anti-GPIa-IIa and anti-GPVI completely inhibited adhesion even at 60 min in the presence of Mg2+ (Fig. 2 a). Combination of anti-GPIV with anti-GPIa-IIa or anti-GPVI also enhanced inhibition, but these effects decreased with time, and only ∼50% inhibition was observed at 60 min. In the absence of Mg2+, preincubation of platelets with anti-GPVI resulted in a complete inhibition of adhesion at all time points (Fig. 2 b). Interestingly, anti-GPIV, which had minimal effect on Mg2+-dependent platelet adhesion at the 60-min time point, significantly inhibited platelet adhesion at all time points (35–50%) in the absence of Mg2+. Contrary to its inhibitory effect in the presence of Mg2+, anti-GPIa-IIa had a minimal effect on time-dependent adhesion in the absence of Mg2+. To conserve the human anti-GPVI antibody, and since it completely inhibited platelet adhesion to acid-insoluble fibrillar collagen under Mg2+-free conditions, we did not study the effects of combinations of anti-GPVI Fabs with either anti-GPIa-IIa IgG or anti-GPIV Fabs, but we did examine the combined effects of anti-GPIa-IIa IgG and anti-GPIV Fabs. The combination of anti-GPIa-IIa with anti-GPIV was slightly more effective in inhibiting adhesion than was anti-GPIV alone, but substantial adhesion was seen at all time points, suggesting that in a Mg2+-free system GPVI alone can overcome the loss of two major receptors. Under each set of conditions, unrelated mouse IgG1 and control Fabs prepared from rabbit and human normal IgG used as negative controls were without effect (data not shown). Rat tail acid-soluble monomeric collagen was coated onto microtiter wells as described for acid-insoluble fibrillar collagen under “Experimental Procedures.” Since no adhesion could be seen in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 1 b), we examined first the effect of the three antibodies individually in the presence of Mg2+(Fig. 3). Preincubation of platelets with anti-GPIa-IIa IgG resulted in a complete inhibition of adhesion. Anti-GPVI Fabs, which significantly inhibited adhesion to acid-insoluble type fibrillar collagen at early time points (Fig. 2 a), had little or no effect on platelet adhesion to rat tail monomeric collagen. Anti-GPIV Fabs by themselves inhibited adhesion significantly at early time points. The addition of both anti-GPVI Fabs and anti-GPIV Fabs showed no further inhibition, confirming again that GPVI has no role in platelet adhesion to acid-soluble monomeric collagen under static conditions. These results support earlier observations that GPIa-IIa is an important adhesion receptor for monomeric collagen (14Santoro S.A. Rajpara S.M. Staatz W.D. Woods Jr., V.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 153: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15McKeown L. Vail M. Williams S. Kramer W. Hansmann K. Gralnick H. Blood. 1994; 83: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Coller B.S. Beer J.H. Scudder L.E. Steinberg M.H. Blood. 1989; 74: 182-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that GPIV may also participate in the adhesive interactions of platelets with monomeric collagen. The extent of the platelet release reaction was determined by measuring the amount of [14C]serotonin secreted into the medium from the dense granules and of PF4 and β-TG from the α-granules following adhesion to fibrillar collagen. In the presence of Mg2+, adhered platelets secreted ∼60% of their dense granule contents into the medium (Table I). In the absence of Mg2+, the amount of adhesion was reduced to about one-fourth, but the adhered platelets secreted ∼80% of their [14C]serotonin content. These results suggest that Mg2+ is not required for the collagen-induced release reaction. Adhesion to monomeric collagen did not induce a significant release reaction (data not shown). The combination of anti-GPIa-IIa and anti-GPVI Fabs that completely inhibited Mg2+-dependent adhesion also completely inhibited serotonin secretion (Table II). Similarly, anti-GPVI Fabs which inhibited platelet adhesion in Mg2+-free buffer also inhibited secretion of serotonin from platelets. Like serotonin secretion, the secretion of PF4 and β-TG was also inhibited by anti-GPVI Fabs by themselves alone and in combination with anti-GPIa-IIa (data not shown).Table IDivalent cation-dependent and -independent adhesion of platelets to fibrillar type I collagen and [14C]serotonin secretionTimePlatelet adhesion (mean ± S.D.)Serotonin secretion from adhered platelets (mean ± S.D.)min%%Mg2+-dependent3016.5 ± 3.457.4 ± 4.46034.2 ± 4.458.8 ± 14.9Mg2+-independent304.2 ± 2.479.5 ± 5.1609.1 ± 3.277.1 ± 13.9 Open table in a new tab Table IIEffects of anti-GPIa-IIa, anti-GPIV and anti-GPVI on platelet adhesion to fibrillar type I collagen and [14C]serotonin secretionPlatelet adhesion (percentage of control) (mean ± S.D.)[14C]Serotonin release from adhered platelets (percentage of control) (mean ± S.D.)%%Mg2+-dependent Anti-GPIa-IIa72.3 ± 3.473.7 ± 20.9 Anti-GPIV93.1 ± 7.278.6 ± 18.5 Anti-GPVI87.8 ± 6.162.5 ± 18.2 Anti-GPIa-IIa + anti-GPIV50.0 ± 8.663.2 ± 16.7 Anti-GPIV + anti-GPVI58.5 ± 14.972.0 ± 6.8 Anti-GPIa-IIa + anti-GPVI0.8 ± 0.4ND2-aND, not detectable.Mg2+-independent Anti-GPIa-IIa74.9 ± 10.477.5 ± 16.2 Anti-GPIV41.0 ± 5.187.7 ± 20.6 Anti-GPIa-IIa + anti-GPIV28.9 ± 5.770.9 ± 15.8 Anti-GPVI0.8 ± 0.4ND 2-aND, not detectable.2-a ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab TXB2, a stable metabolite of TXA2, was measured by immunosorbent assay in the platelet suspending medium after the adhesion as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both in the presence and absence of Mg2+, adhered platelets generated TXA2 in a time-dependent manner (Table III). The absolute amounts of TXA2 generated in each assay during early time points were greater in the presence of Mg2+ than in its absence. However, when TXA2 generation was correlated with the amount of adhesion, there was relatively 3–4 times more TXA2 generation in the absence of Mg2+ than in its presence. We then examined the effects of the three antibodies individually and in combination on adhesion-induced TXA2generation (Fig. 4). In the presence of Mg2+, preincubation of platelets with anti-GPVI Fabs resulted in only a small decrease (15%) in adhesion but completely inhibited TXA2 generation. Anti-GPIa-IIa antibody inhibited platelet adhesion by ∼25% but had no effect on TXA2, generation and anti-GPIV Fab had minimal effects on both platelet adhesion and TXA2 generation. In the absence of Mg2+, anti-GPVI totally suppressed adhesion and TXA2 generation (Fig. 4 a). Modest inhibition of both was seen with anti-GPIa-IIa (∼25%) and with anti-GPIV (∼50%), and their inhibitory effects were essentially additive when added in combination. To exclude the possible role of newly formed TXA2 in enhancing platelet adhesion and TXA2generation, we examined the effect of aspirin and SQ29548, a TXA2 receptor antagonist, on both platelet adhesion to type I acid-insoluble collagen and TXA2 generation. Preincubation of platelets with aspirin (1 mm) and SQ29548 (10 μm) individually had minimal effect on platelet adhesion to collagen, suggesting that TXA2 by itself does not influence the platelet adhesion process in our assay system. Furthermore, SQ29548 had no effect on adhesion-induced TXA2generation, suggesting that generated TXA2 does not induce further TXA2 generation (data not shown).Table IIITime-dependent TXA2 generation by platelets adhered to type I fibrillar collagen under static conditionsTimePlatelet adhesion (mean ± S.D.)TXB2 generation (mean ± S.D.)min%ng/mlMg2+-dependent155.6 ± 1.912.5 ± 4.53015.8 ± 4.826.1 ± 8.26031.5 ± 3.841.2 ± 9.4Mg2+-independent150.8 ± 0.35.9 ± 3.8303.2 ± 1.217.8 ± 7.4608.7 ± 2.639.5 ± 9.8 Open table in a new tab The purpose of this study was to investigate in detail the roles of GPIa-IIa, GPIV, and GPVI in platelet adhesion to collagen under static conditions. Type I monomeric collagen interacts primarily with platelet membrane GPIa-IIa in a Mg2+-dependent fashion without release of dense granule contents (6Santoro S.A. Jamieson G.A. Molecular Basis of Platelet Adhesion to Collagen, in Platelet Membrane Receptors. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York, NY1988: 291-314Google Scholar). On the other hand, interaction with polymeric collagen has a strong divalent cation-independent element that is not inhibitable by anti-GPIa-IIa antibodies (18Morton L.F. Zijenah L.S. McCulloch I.Y. Knight C.G. Barnes M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 439SCrossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We have evaluated, therefore, both acid-insoluble polymeric type I collagen and acid-soluble monomeric type I collagen as substrates to study platelet-collagen adhesive interactions. In our adhesion assay, 1) platelet adhesion to acid-soluble monomeric collagen was Mg2+-dependent, since no adhesion was seen in the absence of Mg2+; 2) it was completely inhibited by preincubation of platelets with anti-GPIa-IIa antibody; and 3) an insignificant release reaction from the adhered platelets was seen. These results confirm earlier observations made by Santoro (6Santoro S.A. Jamieson G.A. Molecular Basis of Platelet Adhesion to Collagen, in Platelet Membrane Receptors. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York, NY1988: 291-314Google Scholar). The lack of effect of anti-GPVI Fabs alone on platelet adhesion to monomeric collagen suggests that GPVI does not play a significant role in these interactions. Anti-GPIV Fabs by themselves were able to significantly inhibit adhesion only during early time points. Platelets adhere to polymeric fibrillar collagen via both Mg2+-dependent and -independent mechanisms (18Morton L.F. Zijenah L.S. McCulloch I.Y. Knight C.G. Barnes M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 439SCrossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In fact, our results suggest that one-fourth of the total adhesion is Mg2+-independent. Mg2+-independent adhesion was not inhibited by anti-GPIa-IIa antibody, but it was completely inhibited by anti-GPVI Fabs and partially (∼50%) inhibited by anti-GPIV Fabs. Moroi et al. (23Moroi M. Jung S.M. Okuma M. Shinmyozu K. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1440-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) described a GPVI-deficient patient whose platelets failed to adhere to collagen fibrils in the presence of EDTA, which is consistent with our results and further confirms that GPVI is a primary receptor in divalent cation-independent platelet adhesion to collagen. In addition, 50% inhibition seen with anti-GPIV Fabs confirms our earlier observation that GPIV-mediated adhesion is Mg2+-independent (28Matsuno K. Diaz-Ricart M. Montgomery R.R. Aster R.H. Jamieson G.A. Tandon N.N. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 92: 960-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These results suggest that both GPVI and GPIV interact with the immobilized collagen in a Mg2+-independent fashion. It is, of course, important to emphasize that these Mg2+-independent reactions go forward in the presence of Mg2+ but are not dependent on it. All three antibodies individually inhibited adhesion (70–85%) during the early phases of Mg2+-dependent adhesion, but at the 60 min time point only very limited inhibition was observed in each case. This loss of inhibition by the 60-min time point suggests that all three receptors may be involved during the early phases, but in the absence of one receptor the other two are ultimately sufficient to overcome the absence of the third. This may explain why patients with deficiency of either GPIa or GPVI do not exhibit a severe bleeding tendency. However, when two receptors were blocked simultaneously, the combination of anti-GPVI Fabs and anti-GPIa-IIa antibody completely abolished adhesion, while the other two combinations, namely anti-GPIa-IIa/anti-GPIV and anti-GPVI/anti-GPIV, were more effective than each individual antibody alone. These results suggest that, under static conditions and in the presence of extracellular Mg2+, all three receptors participate in adhesive interactions of platelets with polymeric type I collagen but that GPIa-IIa and GPVI play the major roles in these interactions. Upon binding to collagen fibers, platelets spread, secrete their granular contents, and generate TXA2. Some of the secreted products, including TXA2, are themselves proaggregatory in that they bind back to platelets and induce aggregation resulting in the growth of thrombus size. The role of individual collagen receptors in various activation processes has not so far been elucidated. We have attempted to clarify the role of each receptor by measuring the adhesion-induced release reaction from dense granules and α-granules and the generation of TXA2. Minimal serotonin, PF4, and β-TG release (about 15%) and no TXA2 generation was observed when monomeric type I collagen was used as a substrate (data not shown). In contrast, once adhered to fibrillar type I collagen, platelets were able to secrete 60–80% of their dense and α-granule contents and generate TXA2 under both divalent cation-dependent and -independent conditions. It is interesting to note that relatively more TXA2 was generated by the adhered platelets in the absence of Mg2+. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to evaluate Mg2+ effects on adhesion-induced TXA2generation. These results further confirm that only native collagen fibers can induce the release reaction and demonstrate for the first time that polymeric fibrillar collagen is essential for TXA2 generation. To explore further the role of the various collagen receptors in TXA2 generation, we carried out antibody blocking experiments. TXA2 generation paralleled the amount of adhesion when GPIa-IIa and GPIV were blocked with their respective antibodies alone or in combination (Fig. 4), suggesting that these receptors are not directly involved in TXA2 generation during adhesion to collagen under static conditions. On the other hand, anti-GPVI Fabs totally abolished TXA2 generation in the presence of Mg2+, but adhesion was inhibited by only ∼15%. TXA2 generation was not seen in all cases where GPVI was blocked. These results are in agreement with those of Ryoet al. (25Ryo R. Yoshida A. Sugano W. Yasunaga M. Nakayama K. Saigo K. Adachi M. Yamaguchi N. Okuma M. Am. J. Hematol. 1992; 39: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and Sugiyama et al. (26Sugiyama T. Okuma M. Ushikubi F. Sensaki S. Kanaji K. Uchino H. Blood. 1987; 69: 1712-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that platelets lacking GPVI did not generate TXA2 upon stimulation with collagen under stirring conditions. The failure to detect TXA2 generation in GPIa-deficient platelets (9Nieuwenhuis H.K. Akkerman J.W. Houdijk W.P. Sixma J.J. Nature. 1985; 318: 470-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) probably reflects the absence of collagen-induced aggregation in these patients or a combined deficiency of other receptors such as GPIV and GPVI, which could affect platelet responses (11Deckmyn H. Chew S.L. Vermylen J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1990; 64: 74-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest a direct association between GPVI and TXA2generation during platelet-collagen adhesive interactions. In summary, platelets have both divalent cation-dependent (integrin; GPIa-IIa) and -independent (non-integrin; GPIV and GPVI) receptors for fibrillar type I collagen. GPVI and GPIa-IIa seem to be the primary receptors for immobilized fibrillar type I collagen under static conditions, and GPIV may accelerate the rate of adhesion once platelets establish contact with collagen fibers via GPVI and GPIa-IIa. Adhered platelets secrete dense and α-granule contents and induce the generation of TXA2 independent of divalent cations. GPVI-mediated signaling seems to play an important role in TXA2 generation. The steps involved in the interaction of collagen with GPVI and the formation of TXA2 are not known and require further study. We are grateful to Guertin Moe and Bob Dunn for performing TXB2 assays."

https://openalex.org/W2325514588,"Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin (NTN) define a new family of neurotrophic factors that play crucial roles in survival and differentiation of various neurons. Recent studies demonstrated that GDNF and NTN use a multicomponent receptor system in which glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked cell surface proteins and Ret receptor tyrosine kinase function as the ligand-binding and signalling components, respectively. In the present study, we investigated the role of Ca2+ ions for biochemical and biological activities of Ret because Ret has a unique structure of the extracellular domain with the cadherin-like motif. The results demonstrated that Ca2+ ions might be required for the complex formation of Ret and GDNF or NTN that induces Ret oligomerization and autophosphorylation. Full morphological differentiation of neuroblastoma cells by these neurotrophic factors was also Ca2+-dependent. These findings thus suggested that, in addition to GPI-linked cell surface proteins, Ca2+ ions are components of the signal transducing complex formed by Ret and GDNF protein family."
https://openalex.org/W2058466739,"Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosome 10q23-q25 is frequent in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), indicating the presence of putative tumor suppressor genes. PTEN/ MMAC1, a newly cloned candidate tumor suppressor gene at 10q23, was mutated in multiple human cancers. We investigated whether mutations of PTEN/MMAC1 play an important role in SCLC tumorigenesis. We examined 16 SCLC cell lines for PTEN/MMAC1 mRNA expression by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and potential mutations by sequencing analysis of the PTEN/MMAC1 coding region. No mutation was observed in PTEN/MMAC1 cDNAs in 15 cell lines expressing PTEN/MMAC1. One SCLC cell line, DMS79, did not have detectable PTEN/ MMAC1 expression. Importantly, we identified a novel homologue of PTEN/MMAC1, termed PTH2, localized to chromosome 9p21-q13 and containing only ten amino acid substitutions compared with the PTEN/MMAC1 coding region. However, because the putative initiation codon for PTEN/MMAC1 gene was changed to arginine in PTH2, the translational initiation site of PTH2 is very likely to differ from that of the PTEN/MMAC1. PTH2 was expressed in two normal lung tissues and two normal colon tissues, but in only four of 16 SCLC cell lines. A missense mutation in PTH2 was identified in a SCLC cell line that did not express PTEN/MMAC1 mRNA. Our data suggest that inactivation of PTEN/ MMAC1 is a rare event in SCLC tumorigenesis. However, the PTEN/MMAC1 homologue PTH2 may play a role in SCLC tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2047340508,"We describe the cloning and initial characterization of a novel cDNA from human embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells. This cDNA, which we named human growth differentiation factor 3 (hGDF3), encodes the homologue of mouse GDF3, a TGFβ superfamily member belonging to the Growth/Differentiation Factors. We have analysed the expression of hGDF3 in human embryonal carcinoma cell lines and in primary testicular germ cell tumours of adolescents and adults (TGCTs). Expression of hGDF3 in human EC cell lines is stem cell-specific, is downregulated upon RA-mediated differentiation and is increased upon culture of the cells in the presence of activin A. In TGCTs, hGDF3 expression is low in seminomas, while expression in non-seminomas is readily detectable and appears to be associated with the EC and yolk sac components in the tumours. We have also mapped the hGDF3 locus to the short arm of human chromosome 12, a region consistently overrepresented in human testicular germ cell tumours. Thus, hGDF3 represents an embryonal carcinoma stem cell-associated marker both in vitro and in vivo."

Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) 1The abbreviations used are: RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; DTT, dithiothreitol; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s). catalyze the reduction of ribonucleotides providing 2′-deoxyribonucleotides for DNA replication and repair. Three well-characterized classes of RNRs, with limited sequence similarities, have been described. They differ in their overall protein structure and cofactor requirement but have in common an allosteric regulation and the use of an organic radical to initiate catalysis through free radical chemistry (1Sjöberg B.-M. Struct. Bond. 1997; 88: 139-173Crossref Google Scholar, 2Reichard P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 81-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Apart from the similarity in mechanism, the radical chain initiator and the accompanying metal cofactor differ between the three classes. Class I enzymes (α2β2) contain a stable tyrosyl radical and a dinuclear iron center. Class II enzymes (α or α2) use adenosylcobalamin as cofactor and cleave it to produce a 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical (3Booker S. Stubbe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8352-8356Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 4Booker S. Licht S. Broderick J. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12676-12685Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The anaerobic class III enzymes (α2β2) possess a stable glycyl radical and an iron-sulfur cluster (5Sun X.Y. Ollagnier S. Schmidt P.P. Atta M. Mulliez E. Lepape L. Eliasson R. Gräslund A. Fontecave M. Reichard P. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6827-6831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Moreover, the different RNRs require their specific physiological reductants thioredoxin, glutaredoxin, and formate, respectively (6Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Packer L. Biothiols, Part B. 252. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1995: 199-208Google Scholar, 7Holmgren A. Åslund F. Packer L. Biothiols, Part B. 252. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1995: 283-292Google Scholar, 8Mulliez E. Ollagnier S. Fontecave M. Eliasson R. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8759-8762Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). At the beginning of the 1990s, only these three classes of RNR were known, and they were found to cover all major branches of the tree of life. However, additional types of RNRs may remain to be discovered, and questions about non-exhaustively characterized atypical RNRs have to be answered. During the last few years, an additional operon, in practice silent under normal laboratory growth conditions, coding for a new type of RNR, was found in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli (9Jordan A. Gibert I. Barbé J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3420-3427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Jordan A. Pontis E. Atta M. Krook M. Gibert I. Barbé J. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These enzymes share with class I enzymes the subunit composition and distinct sequence similarity, including all highly conserved residues, such as the iron ligands, the tyrosyl radical, and active site cysteines. Thus, the discovery of these enzymes led to the division of the class I RNR in two subclasses, classes Ia and Ib (12Jordan A. Pontis E. Åslund F. Hellman U. Gibert I. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8779-8785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The class Ia reductase is encoded by thenrdA and nrdB genes, coding for the homodimeric proteins R1 and R2, respectively, and the class Ib reductase is encoded by the nrdE and nrdF genes, coding for the homodimeric proteins R1E and R2F, respectively. In E. coli and S. typhimurium, the low expression of thenrdE and nrdF genes of class Ib cannot support aerobic growth, and these bacteria are totally dependent on class Ia (11Jordan A. Aragall E. Gibert I. Barbé J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Moreover, the physiological role of these “silent” enzymes is still unknown. However, the Lactococcus lactis RNR was found to be a functionally active reductase of the class Ib type (12Jordan A. Pontis E. Åslund F. Hellman U. Gibert I. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8779-8785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and the purified enzyme from Mycobacterium tuberculosis also turned out to belong to this class (13Yang F.D.

The isolation and characterization of a unique manganese-dependent RNR activity inCorynebacterium (formerly Brevibacterium)ammoniagenes was reported in the 1980s (17Schimpff-Weiland G. Follmann H. Auling G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 102: 1276-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18Willing A. Follmann H. Auling G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 170: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The specific Mn requirement of C. ammoniagenes was first observed in the 1960s during studies of factors controlling nucleotide overproduction (19Oka T. Udagawa K. Kinoshita S. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 96: 1760-1767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Furuya A. Ogata K. Kinoshita S. Tsunoda T. Aida K. Microbial Production of Nucleic Acid Related Substances. Kodansha, Tokyo1976: 125-156Google Scholar). Mn-starved cells showed so-called “unbalanced growth death” because they were arrested in DNA synthesis (17Schimpff-Weiland G. Follmann H. Auling G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 102: 1276-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) due to inhibition of DNA precursor synthesis (21Plönzig J. Auling G. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 146: 396-401Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Upon addition of manganese ions to the medium, DNA synthesis and growth were rapidly restored to the level of a nonstarved culture. The main target of Mn starvation was suggested to be RNR activity, which was very low in a Mn-depleted culture but was increased when manganese ions were supplied in vivo (17Schimpff-Weiland G. Follmann H. Auling G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 102: 1276-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Similar correlations between RNR activity and Mn-starvation conditions have been demonstrated in other coryneform bacteria, such as Arthrobacter citreus, A. globiformis, and A. oxydans, and inMicrococcus luteus, (17Schimpff-Weiland G. Follmann H. Auling G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 102: 1276-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Plönzig J. Auling G. Arch.

The partially purified C. ammoniagenes RNR was suggested to consist of two subunits (18Willing A. Follmann H. Auling G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 170: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 23Willing A. Follmann H. Auling G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 175: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), a nucleotide-binding component called B1 (in this report renamed R1E) and a metal-containing component called B2 (in this report renamed R2F). The presence of Mn was suggested on the basis of specific 54Mn incorporation into the R2F subunit, as well as appearance of a characteristic Mn six-line EPR spectrum after denaturation of a protein preparation containing R2F. Recently, a novel type of stable organic free radical signal was reported for partially purified C. ammoniagenes RNR (24Griepenburg U. Lassmann G. Auling G. Free Radical Res. 1996; 24: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, the radical has not been characterized in detail. Generally, a new metal center and a novel organic radical would be enough to define a new class of RNR. However, other properties, such as the sensitivity to hydroxyurea and the polypeptide sizes of this C. ammoniagenes RNR, suggest a similarity with the well known class I. An intriguing question is therefore whether the C. ammoniagenes RNR is a prototype of a new class of RNR or a subtype of one of the existing classes. In this study, we report that the Mn-containing RNR of C. ammoniagenes is of the class Ib type. We have followed two parallel approaches: identification of class Ib genes in the C. ammoniagenes genome by PCR and purification to homogeneity of the active RNR from C. ammoniagenes, followed by N-terminal and internal peptide amino acid sequence analysis of the α- and β-polypeptide chains. The amino acid sequences obtained from the enzyme proper matched the cloned and sequenced class Ib genesnrdE and nrdF. In addition, the sequence of the neighboring genes nrdH and nrdI is reported. Wild type C. ammoniagenes (ATCC 6872), obtained from the collection of A. N. Bach (Institute of Biochemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia) and E. coli DH5αF′ (CLONTECH) strains were used. Plasmid vectors used were pBluescript SK(+) (pBSK, Stratagene) for subcloning and sequencing and pGEM-T (Promega Corp.) for cloning of PCR-generated fragments. Oligonucleotide primers were from MWG-Biotech (Germany). Restriction endonucleases and other enzymes were from Boehringer Mannheim. [5-3H]CDP was obtained from Amersham Corp. E. coli thioredoxin was purified from SK3981 (25Lunn C.A. Kathju S. Wallace B.J. Kushner S.R. Pigiet V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10469-10474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C. ammoniagenes NrdH-redoxin was obtained from an overproducing strain carrying a recombinant vector with the nrdHgene. 2E. Torrents, unpublished data. C. ammoniagenes ATCC 6872 and E. coli strains were grown aerobically in LB medium at 30 and 37 °C, respectively. Ampicillin was added at 50 μg/ml when selecting for plasmid-containing clones. Genomic DNA from C. ammoniagenes was extracted as described (26Hoch J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 305-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and purified by ultracentrifugation on a cesium chloride gradient. ExoIII deletions were constructed by using the double-stranded nested deletions kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) following the supplier's instructions. DNA sequencing was carried out using the dideoxynucleotide sequencing method with fluorescent universal primers (M13 direct and reverse) and the Automated Laser Fluorescent DNA sequencer (Pharmacia). Other general DNA manipulations and Southern hybridizations were done by standard procedures (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sequence analyses were made with the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group package (version 9.0 for UNIX). For PCR amplification of the nrdF gene of C. ammoniagenes, two primers were designed from conserved R2F peptide sequences (GYKYQ and NHDFFS, respectively; indicated in Fig. 3): CoryFup, 5′-GGCTACAAGTACCAG-3′, and CoryFlow, 5′-AACCACGACTTCTTCTC-3′ (antisense). Genomic DNA (0.2 μg) was used as template in a 50-μl PCR amplification reaction with 50 pmol of each primer, all dNTPs (0.2 mm each), 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer (Boehringer Mannheim), and 1.5 units of Taq polymerase. The reaction was run with the following program: (a) 3 min at 94 °C; (b) 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C; and (c) 7 min at 72 °C. The amplification product was purified from an ethidium bromide, 3% Nusieve-agarose gel by melting the band in 6 m NaI at 50 °C and using the Wizard DNA Clean-up system (Promega Corp.), and cloned in pGEM-T according to the manufacturer's protocol. This fragment was labeled with the DIG DNA labeling and detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The library of C. ammoniagenes ATCC 6872 genomic DNA consisted of a mixture of partially digested DNA. Freshly prepared genomic DNA (15 μg) was partially digested withSau3A. Fragments of 6–11 kb were pooled, and restriction-generated ends were filled in with A and G nucleotides by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min with 10 units of Klenow DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). Lambda GEM-12 vector (Promega) was prepared by filling in XhoI-generated ends with T and C nucleotides. After ligation of insert DNA to vector, the library was packaged using Packgene extracts (Promega). Statistical calculations (28Clarke L. Carbon J. Cell. 1976; 9: 91-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) indicate that about 3900 recombinant phages would cover the entire C. ammoniagenes genome with a probability of 99.99% when an insert length of 11 kb and a genome size of 3 Mb (29Bathe B. Kalinowski J. Puhler A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 255-265PubMed Google Scholar) are assumed. A library with a titer of 1.8 × 104 plaque-forming units/ml was obtained and screened by phage-DNA hybridization after blotting to Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Corp.) by using the DIG DNA labeling and detection kit from Boehringer Mannheim and following the supplier's recommendations. Phage λ DNA was isolated as described by Sambrook et al.(27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). C. ammoniagenes ATCC 6872 was inoculated from a slant (1% yeast extract, 1% glucose, 1% CaCO3, 2% agar; Difco) grown at 30 °C for 24 h in 100 ml of inoculate medium (2% glucose, 1% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.3% NaCl, 0.05 mg/ml biotin) and cultivated at 30 °C overnight. The overnight culture was used to inoculate several 1-liter batches of minimal fermentation medium (21Plönzig J. Auling G. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 146: 396-401Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and cultivation was continued in 5-liter flasks at 30 °C and 220 rpm. After 10 h of growth, 10 μm MnCl2 was added to the medium, and 1 h after Mn repletion, cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell paste was washed with Buffer A (85 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 2 mmDTT), frozen on dry ice, and stored at −80 °C. Unless otherwise indicated, all purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C. In a typical experiment, 24 g of wet weight frozen cells were disrupted through a X-press (BIOX). The disintegrated cells were homogenized and extracted with 3 volumes (per wet weight cells) of Buffer A by stirring for 45 min and then centrifuged for 30 min to remove cell debris. Nucleic acids were precipitated by dropwise addition of streptomycin sulfate to a final concentration of 1.5%. After stirring for 30 min, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was dialyzed in SpectraPor membrane tubing (cutoff, molecular weight of 3500; Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc.) against 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 2 mm DTT for 1 h. Precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was further dialyzed against the same buffer overnight. Precipitated proteins (called low salt fraction) were collected by centrifugation, dissolved in a minimal volume (15–25 ml) of Buffer A, and stored at −80 °C for further purification. Aliquots of the low-salt protein fraction (≤100 mg of protein) were applied on a MemSep column HP1500 (DEAE-cellulose) equilibrated with Buffer A. The separation was performed by ConSep system at a flow rate of 20 ml/min. After a washing step with 200 ml of Buffer A, the elution was continued with 400 ml of 0.15 m NaCl in Buffer A followed by a 0.15–0.4 m NaCl linear gradient in Buffer A in a total volume of 800 ml. Fractions of 10 ml were collected, and RNR activity was eluted between 0.15–0.25 m NaCl. RNR-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultradialysis (Sartorius; cutoff, molecular weight of 12,000) in Buffer A and stored at −80 °C for further purification. The concentrated enzyme solution was loaded onto a Superdex 200 column (30 × 1.3 cm) previously equilibrated in Buffer A containing 10% glycerol at room temperature. Proteins were eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated at 4 °C in Centricon 30 (Amicon) and stored at −80 °C. The concentrated protein was then adsorbed to a 1-ml MonoQ-anion exchange column run at room temperature. After a first washing of the column by 5 ml of Buffer A containing 10% glycerol and 0.28m NaCl, the proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (25 ml of 0.28–0.7 mNaCl in Buffer A containing 10% glycerol). Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected in tubes immersed in an ice bath, pooled according to the UV absorption profile, concentrated at 4 °C in Centricon 30, and analyzed for protein concentration and reductase activity. The procedure separated two protein components that together are required for enzyme activity. The purified components were stored at −80 °C. RNR activity was assayed in 50-μl mixtures containing 120 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mm dATP as a positive effector, 1 mmmagnesium acetate, 10 mm DTT, 13 μm E. coli thioredoxin, 5–20 μl of the concentrated protein solution. The reaction was started by addition of [3H]CDP (specific activity, 60,000–80,000 cpm/nmol) to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Assay mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C and stopped by addition of 0.5 ml of ice-cold 1 mperchloric acid. One unit of enzyme activity corresponds to 1 nmol of dCDP formed per min of incubation (30Thelander L. Sjöberg B.-M. Eriksson S. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To obtain partial peptide amino acid sequences, SDS-PAGE was used. Protein samples (50 μg of total protein) were first denatured in a mixture of 125 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.5% SDS, 10 mm DTT, 15% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue. After boiling for 2–3 min and cooling to room temperature, the incubation was continued with 20 mmiodoacetamide for another 20 min in darkness at room temperature. Reduced and alkylated protein samples were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 50% methanol, and destained in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid. Protein bands corresponding to the α- and β-polypeptide chains of RNR were excised from the gel and used for subsequent proteolytic digestions. For N-terminal sequence analysis, protein samples were treated as described above, but the alkylation step was omitted. After separation by SDS-PAGE as above, nonstained protein bands were blotted from the gel onto prewet (100% methanol) polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Fluorotrans; pore size, 0.22 μm; Pall Filtron) in a blotting buffer containing 23 mm Tris base, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol. After overnight blotting at 200 mA in a cold room, the proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (0.1% in 50% methanol) for 2 min and destaining in several changes of 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, followed by rinsing with MilliQ water. Membrane pieces were subjected to automated Edman degradation in a Perkin-Elmer-Applied Biosystems Model 494A sequencer, operated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The two excised gel bands containing the alkylated α- and β-polypeptides, respectively, were treated for in-gel digestion to prepare internal peptides for amino acid sequence analysis. Briefly, the gel pieces were washed with Tris-HCl/acetonitrile to remove SDS and the Coomassie dye and to put the gel pieces in the appropriate digestion environment. After complete drying of the gel pieces, a solution containing 0.5 μg of Achromobacter lyticusprotease Lys-C (Wako Chemicals GmbH, Neuss, Germany) was allowed to absorb into the gel pieces. Rehydration with digestion buffer was continued until the gels were soaked, and incubation was carried out overnight at 30 °C. After acidifying the incubation mixtures, generated peptides were extracted from the gels and isolated by narrow-bore reversed phase liquid chromatography on a μRPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10 column operated in the SMART System (Pharmacia). A full description is found elsewhere (31Hellman U. Kamp R.M. Choli-Papadopoulou T. Wittmann-Liebold B. Protein Structure Analysis. Preparation, Characterization, and Microsequencing. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1997: 97-104Google Scholar). Of the collected peptides, some were selected for automated Edman degradation in a Perkin-Elmer-Applied Biosystems Model 494A sequencer, operated according to the manufacturer's instructions. EPR spectra at 9.36 GHz measured at 77 K were recorded on a Bruker ESP 300 spectrometer using a cold finger Dewar flask for liquid nitrogen. Subtractions were performed using the ESP 300 software. Denaturation was done by adjusting the sample to pH 1 by addition of 1 m nitric acid. Buffer from the flow-through of the centricon concentration step prior to the EPR analysis was used as background control for the native sample. For the denatured sample, the same amount of nitric acid as added to the protein sample was added to the background control sample. Background spectra were recorded under conditions identical to those for the native and denatured protein and thereafter subtracted from the total spectrum to give the spectra presented in Fig. 7. Atomic absorption measurements were made on a Perkin-Elmer Z3030 graphite furnace. Calibrations for each metal were made by the use of several solutions of known metal concentration in the same buffer as used for the sample. Protein concentration was determined either by the modified Lowry method (32Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7134) Google Scholar) or the Bradford method (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Analytical protein gel electrophoresis was done by the Phast gel system (Pharmacia) in 7.5% or 10–15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels with Coomassie or silver staining. The deduced amino acid sequences of all known RNR class IbnrdF genes contain some highly conserved regions that allow the design of NrdF-specific oligonucleotides for PCR amplification. Primers CoryFup and CoryFlow (see “Experimental Procedures”) were designed from the R2F conserved regions GYKYQ and NHDFFS, respectively, according to the Corynebacterium codon usage (34Malumbres M. Gil J.A. Martin J.F. Gene. 1993; 134: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and used for PCR amplification of selected parts of genomic DNA extracted fromC. ammoniagenes. A single 297-bp product, which was of the expected size range, was amplified, cloned in pGEM-T plasmid DNA, and sequenced in both directions. The sequence of the amplified and cloned product corresponded to a nrdF gene fragment according to its high homology to the S. typhimurium nrdF gene (60.7% identity at the nucleotide sequence level). The cloned fragment was used as a probe for screening a genomic C. ammoniageneslibrary. Our cloning strategy assumed that the nrdE and nrdF genes would be located in close proximity to each other in the C. ammoniagenes genome as in all bacterial nrdEF operons studied thus far (9Jordan A.

The amplified nrdFfragment was used as a hybridization probe for screening a λ phage genomic C. ammoniagenes library enriched for 6–11 kb fragments (see “Experimental Procedures”). Several positive phage plaques were purified, and their DNA was extracted and checked by restriction endonuclease analysis and Southern hybridization and found to contain the nrdF gene. Several fragments derived from the endonuclease digestion of these λ phage DNA clones were cloned into pBSK(+) and sequenced from both extremes to localize thenrdE and nrdF genes. A 10 kb SacI fragment from one of these positive plaques was assumed to contain both genes and was subcloned into SacI-digested pBSK(+), resulting in plasmid pUA728. Southern hybridization was performed to confirm that the clonedSacI fragment originated from C. ammoniagenesgenomic DNA and was not hybridizing with some other bacterial chromosomes (data not shown). Plasmid pUA728 was then used for DNA sequencing. To obtain the full-length sequence, a combination of fragment subcloning and generation of progressive unidirectional nested deletions for both strands were applied.

Despite intensive research, the molecular mechanisms by which c-Myc triggers and executes cell death remain still elusive. Here, we made use of Rat 1A MycER cells expressing a conditionally active c-Myc protein and tested first the hypothesis that ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), which is a transcriptional target of c-Myc, were a mediator of c-Myc-induced apoptosis. However, our results show that the activity of ODC is not required for the c-Myc-mediated apoptosis to occur in these cells. We also found that the expression of p53, p21waf1/cip1, Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-xL, Bad and cyclins D1, E, A and B did not show any significant changes following c-Myc induction. But, our studies revealed that the c-Myc induced apoptosis is associated with a specific cleavage of poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP), suggesting that a cysteine protease of the ICE/CED-3 family is involved. Moreover, we found that the cysteine protease CPP32/Caspase-3, which is known to cleave PARP, is processed from its inactive form to an active protease composed of 17 and 12 kDa subunits; whilst Ich-1/Caspase-2 belonging to another subset of this protease family was not processed/ activated following c-Myc activation. The activation of CPP32 and apoptotic cell death were inhibited by addition of Z-VAD-fmk, a universal inhibitor of ICE-like proteases. Further, a selective inhibitor of CPP32-like proteases (Z-DEVD-fmk) partly inhibited apoptosis. These results provide evidence that the ICE/CED3-family proteases, CPP32 and likely others, play a critical role in the execution of a nuclear proto-oncogene, c-Myc-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2014203165,"p21cip1/waf1/sdi1 is a universal cyclin-Cdk kinase inhibitor that has two functional domains; one binds and inhibits cyclin-Cdk activity and the other binds PCNA and thereby inhibits elongation by DNA polymerase. When transiently expressed in hamster BHK21 cells we found that human p21 was able to cause cell cycle arrest in G1 phase; this arrest was counteracted by coexpression of E2F-1 or SV40 large T antigen. To study the effect of p21 overexpression in vivo, BHK21 cell clones inducibly expressing human p21 (Tet-p21) driven by the tetracycline (Tet)-repressible promoter were established. The maximum induced p21 levels in the absence of Tet were estimated to be ten times that of endogenous hamster p21. As p21 levels rose following removal of Tet, p21-associated histone H1 kinase activity was increased and concomitantly cell growth and DNA synthesis were reduced. Tet-p21 BHK21 cells became arrested in G1 phase and lost colony forming ability irreversibly 2-4 days after removal of Tet. The induction of cyclin E- and cyclin A-associated kinase activities was diminished when G0-synchronized Tet-p21 BHK21 cells were serum stimulated in the absence of Tet. Increased binding of p21 to PCNA and cyclin D1-Cdk4 was detected in induced cells. Overexpression of p21 led to cell death in BHK21 cells at 39.5 degrees C within 4 days."
https://openalex.org/W2320180221,"Deletions within chromosome 6 (6q25 to 6qter) are the most consistent structural change observed in salivary gland carcinomas. To better define the location of these deletions we investigated loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for 23 polymorphic markers within 19 salivary gland carcinomas covering several histological subtypes. LOH was observed in 47% of tumors, confirming previous reports that such losses are frequent and occur in almost all histological subtypes of tumors. The highest frequency of LOH was found at, or distal to, D6S437. Seven tumors had allelic losses for D6S297 and/or D6S37. A second peak of loss was also observed at D6S262 and D6S32. In some tumors we observed LOH in one or the other of these two regions. In other tumors we observed loss of both regions with retention of intervening loci. These data suggest that two small deletions commonly occur, one between D6S262 and D6S32 (estimated to cover less than 1.5 Mb) and another between D6S297 and D6S446 (estimated to cover approximately 2 Mb). These results extend previous studies by sublocalizing the regions of LOH and suggest that inactivation of one or more tumor suppressor genes located in these regions may be an important step in salivary gland carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2331096726,"During growth arrest and differentiation, activity of the E2F family of transcription factors is inhibited by interactions with pRb and the related proteins, p107 and p130. To determine which members of the E2F and pRb families may contribute to growth arrest as lens epithelial cells differentiate into fiber cells, we examined the expression of individual E2F species and characterized the E2F protein complexes formed in rat lens epithelia and fibers. RT/PCR detected all five known members of the E2F family in lens epithelial cells, but only E2F-1, E2F-3, and E2F-5 in fiber cells. Proteins extracted from lens epithelia of newborn rats formed at least two specific complexes with an E2F consensus oligonucleotide. Proteins from lens fiber cells formed three specific complexes, one of which comigrated with an epithelial cell complex. Incubation of epithelial and fiber cell extracts with an antibody specific for p107 demonstrated that two fiber cell complexes and one epithelial cell complex contained p107. Although the remaining fiber cell complex did not react with antibodies to pRb or p130 in this assay, a strong reaction with pRb antibody was observed when the electromobility shifted complexes were subsequently immunoblotted (shift/Western assay). Immunocytochemistry confirmed that pRb protein is present in the nuclei of both epithelial cells and fiber cells. Immunoblotting of whole cell extracts with pRb antibody showed multiple, phosphorylated forms of pRb in the epithelial cells, but predominantly hypophosphorylated pRb in the fiber cells. None of the complexes formed with E2F were recognized exclusively by the p130 antibody, although the previously identified p107 complexes reacted weakly. The absence of p130/E2F complexes was correlated with the presence of multiple ubiquitinated forms of p130, especially in the fiber cells. Thus, although p130/E2F complexes are implicated in the terminal differentiation of many cell types, in differentiating lens fiber cells pRb and p107 seem to be the primary regulators of E2F activity."

https://openalex.org/W2325222249,"We have previously demonstrated that arachidonic acid activates extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs) group of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). To understand the role of arachidonic acid in cellular signaling events, we have now studied its effect on jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) group of MAPKs in VSMC. Arachidonic acid activated JNK1 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner with maximum effects at 10 min and 50 μM. Induced activation of JNK1 by arachidonic acid is specific as other fatty acids such as linoleic and stearic acids had no such effect. Indomethacin and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), potent inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase (COX) and the lipoxygenase (LOX)/monooxygenase (MOX) pathways, respectively, had no effect on arachidonic acid activation of JNK1 suggesting that the observed phenomenon is independent of its metabolism through either pathway. However, 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HpETE), the LOX metabolite of arachidonic acid significantly induced JNK1 activity. Protein kinase C (PKC) depletion by prolonged treatment of VSMC with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) resulted in partial decrease in the responsiveness of JNK1 to arachidonic acid suggesting a role for both PKC-dependent and -independent mechanisms in the activation of JNK1 by this important fatty acid. On the other hand, the responsiveness of JNK1 to 12-HpETE was completely abolished in PKC-depleted cells, suggesting a major role for PKC in 12-HpETE-induced JNK1 activation. IL-1β and TNF-α activated JNK1 in a time-dependent manner with maximum effect at 10 min. Desensitization of JNK1 by arachidonic acid significantly reduced its responsiveness to both the cytokines. In addition, 4-bromophenacyl bromide (4-BPB), a potent and selective inhibitor of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), significantly attenuated the cytokine-induced activation of JNK1. Together, these results show that (1) arachidonic acid and its LOX metabolite, 12-HpETE, activate JNK1 in VSMC, (2) PKC-dependent and -independent mechanisms play a role in the activation of JNK1 by arachidonic acid and 12-HpETE, and (3) arachidonic acid mediates, at least partially, the cytokine-induced activation of JNK1."

https://openalex.org/W1999508213,"In an effort to understand the mechanisms governing the regulation of the mouse Ron receptor gene, a mouse genomic library was screened and overlapping clones coding for the Ron gene and flanking DNA were identified. Continuous DNA sequence was obtained for approximately 16.4 kilobases. The gene, from the initiator methionine to the polyadenylation site, is contained within 13 244 basepairs and contains 19 exons. Primer extension analyses were performed to determine the transcription start site of the mouse Ron transcript. Multiple transcription start sites were found which also appear to be used in transfected reporter constructs containing Ron 5' flanking DNA. To determine the location of sites which may be critical for the function of the Ron gene promoter, a series of chimeric genes containing serial deletions of the Ron gene promoter fused to the coding sequences for the chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase gene were constructed. Transient transfection analyses of these hybrid genes into various cell lines demonstrated that two regions of the Ron gene promoter, encompassing nucleotides -585 to -465 and from -465 to -285, are important for expression of this transcript in CMT-93 cells. Further analysis of the Ron promoter utilizing gel mobility shift analyses suggests that regions encompassing nucleotides -585 to - 508 and nucleotides -375 to -285 appear to bind specific proteins which may be involved in the negative and positive regulation, respectively, of the mouse Ron gene."
https://openalex.org/W1966303593,"Breast tumours from BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers are genetically instable and display specific patterns of chromosomal aberrations, suggestive of distinct genetic pathways in tumour progression. The frequency of abnormalities affecting chromosome 17p and the TP53 gene was determined in 27 breast tumours from 26 female patients carrying the Icelandic BRCA2 founder mutation (999del5). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was detected in 23 of the 27 tumours (85%). The majority of tumours manifesting LOH had lost a large region on 17p, although a more restricted loss, including the TP53 locus was seen in a few tumours. Positive p53 immunostaining was observed in 18 of 26 tumours (69%). However, mutations in the TP53 gene were detected in only three tumours (11%), including a missense (codon 139) and a nonsense mutation (codon 306) in two tumours with moderate p53 expression and a frameshift deletion (codon 182) in a tumour with no detectable p53 expression. Positive p53 immunostaining, mainly weak, was observed in 16 of the 24 tumours (66%) without TP53 mutation. The high frequency of LOH at chromosome 17p13 suggests that one or more genes from this region are involved in the development of BRCA2-induced breast cancer. The frequent finding of weak overexpression of, presumably wild type p53 protein, suggests an alternative mechanism of TP53 involvement specific to these tumours."

This suggests that normal function of the ClC-1 protein depends on the integrity of the carboxyl tail and particularly on that portion between Ser720 and Arg894, with some significant role for D13 being implied. Reconstitution experiments (4Schmidt-Rose T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20515-20521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), in which the nonfunctional mutant S720X was restored to functionality by co-expression with either the complementary or an overlapping carboxyl tail peptide, have reinforced this view. Another hint of the importance of D13 is provided by mutations that truncate the kidney chloride channel, ClC-5, before or within D13, these also being nonfunctional when expressed inXenopus oocytes (10Lloyd S.E.

We have investigated the relevance of the cytoplasmic tail by generating truncation and deletion mutants of rat ClC-1, expressing them in the baculovirus Sf9 insect cell system (12King L.A. Possee R.D. The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide. Chapman and Hall, London1992Crossref Google Scholar), and performing functional analysis by patch clamp. Rat ClC-1 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number P35524) was cloned into the vector pBacPAK 8 (CLONTECH) yielding the plasmid pDA6 (13Astill D. St J. Rychkov G. Clarke J.D. Hughes B.P. Roberts M.L. Bretag A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1280: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) in which the carboxyl terminus truncation mutants Q574X, N596X, and L869X were generated using the Altered Sites System (Promega) and the mutagenic primers Q574X (5′-GAGGGAGGGTCACAGACTTTG-3′), N596X (5′-GCTGAGCTGTCACCAACCAAG-3′), and L869X (5′-TAGCTCTTCTCATGCCAAGAC-3′). Convenient restriction enzyme sites were used to generate additional truncation mutants (fs923X and fs895X). Restriction of pDA6 withSacI yielded fragments of 8.28 and 0.74 kb, the larger of which was self-ligated to produce the desired mutation (fs923X). In the process, eight extraneous amino acids (RIPGRPLN) were introduced between Ala922 and the premature termination codon. Restriction of pDA6 with XmaI and AccIII yielded fragments of sizes 6.51, 1.67, and 0.84 kb. The 6.51- and 1.67-kb fragments were ligated to produce the desired mutation (fs895X) with three extraneous amino acids (AAA) being introduced between Arg894 and the premature termination codon. Deletion of the domain D13 was performed by recombinant PCR (14Steinmeyer K. Lorenz C. Pusch M. Koch M.C. Jentsch T.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) using the primers D13F (5′-TGGCCCTTTGTATGAGTCTTGTG-3′) and D13R (5′-CTCATACAAAGGGCCACACCAAA-3′) along with Bac 1 and Bac 2 (CLONTECH) flanking primers to amplify the rClC cDNA sequence prior to D13 (up to and including Thr845) and following D13 (from and including Lys877), respectively. The altered cDNA (ΔD13) was cloned into pBacPAK 8 using the restriction enzymes BamHI and KpnI. All mutant constructs were confirmed by restriction digestion analysis where possible and, finally, verified by DNA sequencing. Mutation sites are indicated in Fig. 1. Recombinant baculoviruses containing the mutated cDNAs were produced in Sf21 insect cells. Transfer of the relevant DNA insert into the viral genome was confirmed by PCR analysis using the rClC-1-specific primers Se 5 (5′-CCTGGAATCGTTACTTTTGTC-3′) and Se 6 (5′-TCCAAAGGCAGCTCCTAGCAC-3′), and viral clones were amplified, titred, and screened for protein production as described elsewhere (12King L.A. Possee R.D. The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide. Chapman and Hall, London1992Crossref Google Scholar, 13Astill D. St J. Rychkov G. Clarke J.D. Hughes B.P. Roberts M.L. Bretag A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1280: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Messenger RNA was extracted from cells infected with the WT, Q574X, and N596X recombinant baculoviruses. Briefly, 4 × 106 Sf21 insect cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus with a multiplicity of infection of 20 as described previously (13Astill D. St J. Rychkov G. Clarke J.D. Hughes B.P. Roberts M.L. Bretag A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1280: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). After 48 h of incubation, mRNA was extracted using the QuickPrep Micro mRNA Purification kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and reverse transcribed with the First Strand Synthesis kit (Pharmacia) to produce cDNA, which was amplified by PCR using the rClC-1-specific primers Se 3 (5′-GCAGTGATTGGAGCAGCAGCT-3′) and Se 4 (5′-CTTGACTGTGGTGGTCTGGAG-3′). The RT-PCR was standardized by amplification of the cDNAs with β-actin-specific primers (15Gaudette M.F. Crain W.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1879-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As controls, RT-PCR was performed on mRNA extracted from uninfected cells, and to ensure that mRNA extracted from appropriately infected cells had no DNA contamination, PCR was also performed on the mRNA extract without the reverse transcription step. These samples gave no bands. Cultured Sf9 cells were infected with control baculovirus BVDA6.3 containing rClC cDNA or relevant mutants, incubated for 28–30 h at 28 °C in air, and then seeded onto glass coverslips and maintained at room temperature as described previously (13Astill D. St J. Rychkov G. Clarke J.D. Hughes B.P. Roberts M.L. Bretag A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1280: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Whole cell patch clamp experiments were performed using a List EPC7 patch clamp amplifier and associated standard equipment. The usual bath solution contained 170 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (adjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH). Borosilicate glass electrodes had a resistance of 1–3 MΩ when filled with a normal internal solution: 40 mm KCl, 120 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm Na-EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH). Approximately 90% of series resistance was compensated. Nominal holding and clamping potentials reported here must be corrected for a liquid junction potential of −14 mV estimated to occur between the bath and electrode solutions (16Rychkov G.Y. Pusch M. Astill D. St J. Roberts M.L. Jentsch T.J. Bretag A.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 497.2: 423-435Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Pentobarbitone (0.5 mm) was used to block native anion channels in Sf9 cells. Experiments were conducted at room temperatures of 24 ± 1 °C. Data were collected, filtered at 3 kHz, and analyzed on an IBM-compatible PC using pCLAMP v6.0 software (Axon Instruments). Parameters such as time constants, apparent open probability, and IC50 were determined as described previously (16Rychkov G.Y. Pusch M. Astill D. St J. Roberts M.L. Jentsch T.J. Bretag A.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 497.2: 423-435Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 17Rychkov G.Y. Astill D. St J. Bennetts B. Hughes B.P. Bretag A.H. Roberts M.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 501.2: 355-362Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Analysis of the protein content of Sf21 cells infected with the appropriate baculovirus construct indicated that the fs923X, fs895X, L869X, and ΔD13 recombinant rClC-1 proteins were being expressed and could readily be detected on Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gels (see Ref. 13Astill D. St J. Rychkov G. Clarke J.D. Hughes B.P. Roberts M.L. Bretag A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1280: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas similar rClC-1-specific bands could not be detected for the N596X and Q574X mutations (data not shown). Evidence that transcription of the N596X and Q574X constructs had occurred, however, was provided by RT-PCR analysis of mRNA extracted from appropriately infected cells, which gave the expected prominent band in each case (data not shown). When expressed in Sf9 cells, fs923X, fs895X, and ΔD13 mutations did not change such basic properties of rClC-1 as the pronounced inward rectification of instantaneous currents, saturation of outward currents at positive potentials, deactivation of inward currents at negative potentials, and the voltage dependence of apparent open probability. Kinetics of the inward current deactivation, however, were slower in the mutants (Fig. 2). Of the two time constants that can typically be extracted from the deactivating currents (16Rychkov G.Y. Pusch M. Astill D. St J. Roberts M.L. Jentsch T.J. Bretag A.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 497.2: 423-435Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar), the slow time constant, τ2, was almost doubled (significant by two-way analysis of variance,p < 0.0001) in the fs895X and ΔD13 mutants with respect to WT, whereas the fast time constant, τ1, was not significantly altered. For currents in response to a voltage step to −120 mV these were: WT τ1 = 5.8 ± 0.2 ms,n = 21 and τ2 = 26.1 ± 1.4 ms,n = 20; fs895X τ1 = 6.9 ± 0.3 ms,n = 13 and τ2 = 45 ± 2.7 ms,n = 13; ΔD13 τ1 = 7.1 ± 1.3 ms,n = 4 and τ2 = 46.1 ± 3.5 ms,n = 4 (results expressed as mean ± S.E.). Kinetics of the fs923X mutant were closer to WT. Cells infected with the L869X, N596X, or Q574X recombinant baculoviruses failed to produce a chloride conductance attributable to rClC-1 (data not shown). Block of the rClC-1 channel by Cd2+ is sensitive to mutation, e.g. the R304E mutant (17Rychkov G.Y. Astill D. St J. Bennetts B. Hughes B.P. Bretag A.H. Roberts M.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 501.2: 355-362Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). When we tested our present mutants, Cd2+ was as effective on ΔD13 as on the WT channel (IC50 = 1.1 ± 0.1 mm(n = 3) for ΔD13 and 1.0 ± 0.1 mm(n = 3) for WT), whereas fs895X required higher concentrations of Cd2+ to achieve the same level of block (IC50 = 2.7 ± 0.2 mm, (n= 5). There is no doubt from our present study and from previous work (4Schmidt-Rose T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20515-20521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) that truncations of the carboxyl tail of the protein by 125 or more amino acids eliminate the chloride currents attributable to ClC-1 in Sf9 cell and Xenopus oocyte expression systems. Clearly, without detectable protein products, there seems to be a failure of effective translation of the rClC-1 mutants Q574X and N596X in our expression system. A similar explanation, implying some requirement for the integrity of the mRNA code for the proximal part of the carboxyl tail, might apply to the inability to detect appropriate chloride currents in Xenopus oocytes when the carboxyl tail of hClC-1 had been severely truncated by the mutation L598X (4Schmidt-Rose T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20515-20521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Function, in this case, was unable to be restored by co-expression with the complementary carboxyl tail peptide (4Schmidt-Rose T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20515-20521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Both more severely and less severely truncated versions of hClC-1, however, such as L391X, P452X, and G721X, must have been expressed and correctly inserted into the membrane because their function was restorable with appropriate complementation (4Schmidt-Rose T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20515-20521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). By contrast, fully functional, although kinetically slower, versions of rClC-1 are expressed and inserted into the membrane of Sf9 cells, despite lacking the D13 domain or the final 100 amino acids of the carboxyl tail. These results are consistent with previous observations of the naturally occurring myotonic mutant of human ClC-1, R894X (8George A.L. Sloan-Brown K. Fenichel G.M. Mitchell G.A. Spiegel R. Pascuzzi M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 2071-2072PubMed Google Scholar), and of ClC-5 mutants associated with Dent's disease (10Lloyd S.E. Pearce S.H.S. Fisher S.E. Steinmeyer K. Schwappach B. Scheinman S.J. Harding B. Bolino A. Devoto M. Goodyer P. Rigden S.P.A. Wrong O. Jentsch T.J. Craig I.W. Thakker R.V.

Invest. 1997; 99: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The conclusions from these earlier studies have, however, implicated D13 as an essential functional region (4Schmidt-Rose T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20515-20521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This view has received support from the recent identification of a structural motif, conserved across archaea, bacteria, and eukarya, the so-called CBS (cystathionine β-synthase) domain (18Bateman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 12-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). This motif is present in tandem (denoted CBS1 and CBS2) in all eukaryotic ClC proteins (19Ponting C.P. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with CBS1 located between D12 and D13 and CBS2 overlying D13, extending from Cys825 to Lys877 in rClC-1 (Fig. 3). A high level of conservation frequently indicates physiological importance, but our present results are inconsistent with any obvious function for D13 or the CBS2 domain in which it lies. In our quite functional ΔD13 mutant, all of D13 and, simultaneously, the final two-thirds of CBS2 have been eliminated. Although the absence of any evidence of function in ClC-1 truncated by 125 or more amino acids could be fortuitous, a more likely interpretation that encompasses both the earlier observations of others and our new results with the ΔD13 mutant is that there is some essential region of presently unknown significance contained within the immediate post-D13 region. An argument that the region of functional significance might lie prior to D13 but after Ser717 could only be entertained if our L869X mutant, which is expressed, failed to be correctly inserted into the membrane. We have no proof of correct insertion, but note that wherever there has been evidence of expression of ClC-1, there has been concurrent evidence of correct insertion for both shorter and longer truncation mutants (Ref. 4Schmidt-Rose T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20515-20521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar and present results). Coincident with the diminished status of D13 and CBS2, then, it is the region immediately beyond these domains (from Lys877 to Arg894) that takes on an unexpected prominence. Of these 18 amino acids, the final 7 (PPLASFR) are identical in ClC-0, ClC-1, and ClC-2, and mutations around Arg894 (Arg888 in hClC-1) are known to modify ClC-1 function modestly, as in our fs895X mutant, or substantially, as in the myotonic goat (corresponding to A885P in hClC-1) (7Beck C.L. Fahlke C. George A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11248-11252Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and human R894X (8George A.L. Sloan-Brown K. Fenichel G.M. Mitchell G.A. Spiegel R. Pascuzzi M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 2071-2072PubMed Google Scholar) mutants. The seeming discrepancy between our fs895X mutant and the more severe effects of the human R894X might be explained by dramatic differences in the reactivity of their terminal sequences, RAAA and RNTTST (RNTTSI in rClC-1; Fig. 3), respectively. Lack of homology with the post-D13 area of ClC-5 makes it unlikely that the D13 truncation mutants of ClC-5 lose function in the same way as similar mutants of ClC-1 (Fig. 3). Finally, our results with Cd2+ block, which occurs only when Cd2+ is applied to the extracellular side of the channel (17Rychkov G.Y. Astill D. St J. Bennetts B. Hughes B.P. Bretag A.H. Roberts M.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 501.2: 355-362Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), suggest that the immediate post-D13 region is structurally in close proximity to the channel pore or that very long range conformational changes originating in this distant region can influence the extracellular site of Cd2+ binding. We are grateful to Professor T. J. Jentsch of the Center for Molecular Neurobiology, Hamburg, for advice on recombinant PCR and to Dr. D. St. J. Astill for suggestions relating to the frameshift mutations."

To determine the role of specific Gα residues for RGS protein recognition, six RGS contact residues of chimeric transducin α-subunit (Gtα) corresponding to the residues that differ between Giα and Gsα have been replaced by Gsα residues. The ability of human retinal RGS (hRGSr) to bind mutant Gtα subunits and accelerate their GTPase activity was investigated. Substitutions Thr178 → Ser, Ile181 → Phe, and Lys205 → Arg of Gtα did not alter its interaction with hRGSr. The Lys176 → Leu mutant had the same affinity for hRGSr as Gtα, but the maximal GTPase stimulation by hRGSr was reduced by ∼2.5-fold. The substitution His209 → Gln led to a 3-fold decrease in the affinity of hRGSr for the Gtα mutant without significantly affecting the maximal GTPase enhancement. The Ser202 → Asp mutation abolished Gtα recognition by hRGSr. A counteracting replacement of Glu129 by Ala in hRGSr did not restore the interaction of hRGSr with the Gtα Ser202 → Asp mutant. Our data suggest that the Ser residue at position 202 of Gtα is critical for the specificity of RGS proteins toward Gi and Gq families of G-proteins.

Heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) are components of many major signaling systems that are used by cells to transduce a variety of signals from specific cell surface receptors to intracellular effector proteins. Regulation of G-protein GTPase activity represents an important mechanism for establishing proper signal duration.

Identification of RGS proteins has helped to solve a long standing discrepancy between the fast signal termination in vivo and relatively slow intrinsic GTPase rates typically observed under in vitro conditions (6Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 11Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4714) Google Scholar). However, no RGS protein or other GTPase-activating protein (GAP) specific toward Gsα has been described to date (9Berman D.M.

The recently solved crystal structure of RGS4 bound to Giα1·AlF4−provides the first structural insights into the mechanism of RGS protein GAP function and offers a starting point for studying the structural basis of the specificity of known RGS proteins (12Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). RGS4 interacts with the switch regions of Giα1that are likely to have a similar general conformation with the corresponding regions of Gsα (12Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The incompetence of RGS proteins to bind and stimulate the GTPase activity of Gsα therefore originates from the differences between amino acid residues of Giα1 contacting RGS4 and corresponding residues of Gsα. In this study we investigate molecular determinants of the specificity of RGS/G-protein interaction using transducin α-subunit (Gtα) as a prototypical member of the Gifamily and a human homologue (hRGSr) of mouse retinal mRGSr (13Chen C.K.

Mutagenesis of Gtα residues was performed using the vector for expression of His6-tagged Gtα/Giα1 chimera 8 (Chi8) as a template for PCR amplifications (18Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The Gtα Lys176 → Leu and Thr178 → Ser substitutions were introduced using 5′-primer 1 and 3′-primers 2 and 3, respectively, for PCR amplification (see below). The PCR products were digested withBsmBI and subcloned into the BsmBI-digested pHis6Chi8. Primer 3 also contained silent mutations creating the unique XbaI site that was used to make the Ile181 → Phe mutant. The 5′-primer 4 and 3′-primer 5 were used to obtain the PCR product carrying the Ile181 → Phe mutation. The product was cut with XbaI and HindIII and subcloned into theXbaI/HindIII-digested pHis6Chi8 Thr178 → Ser. The Ser202 → Asp and Lys205 → Arg substitutions were introduced by PCR-directed mutagenesis using 5′-primer 6 and 3′-primers 7 and 8, respectively, followed by insertion of theNcoI/BamHI-digested PCR products into pHis6Chi8. Mutation His209 → Gln was generated using 5′-primer 9 and 3′-primer 5 and subcloning of the PCR product into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pHis6Chi8. The sequences of all mutants were verified by automated DNA sequencing at the University of Iowa DNA Core Facility. Chi8 and all mutants were expressed and purified as described previously (18Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were tested in the trypsin protection assay as described (19Kleuss C. Raw A.S. Lee E. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9828-9831Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).

A substitution Glu129 → Ala of hRGSr was performed using PCR amplifications from the pGEX-KG-hRGSr template (14Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17444-17449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) similarly as described (20Natochin M. McEntaffer R.L. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 (in press)Google Scholar). GST-hRGSr and the mutant were expressed in DH5αEscherichia coli cells, and the GST portion was removed as described earlier (14Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17444-17449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Chi8 or its mutants (1 μm final concentration) were mixed with glutathione-agarose retaining ∼10 μg of GST-hRGSr in 200 μl of 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.6) containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 30 μm AlCl3, and 10 mm NaF (buffer A). After incubation for 20 min at 25 °C, the agarose beads were spun down, washed three times with 1 ml of buffer A, and the bound proteins were eluted with a sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Single turnover GTPase activity measurements were carried out in suspensions of uROS membranes (5 μm rhodopsin) reconstituted with chimeric Gtα or its mutants (2 μm) and Gtβγ (1 μm) essentially as described in Refs. 14Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17444-17449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar and 21Arshavsky V.Y. Gray-Keller M.P. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18530-18537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Bleached uROS membranes were mixed with different concentrations of hRGSr or hRGSrGlu129 → Ala and preincubated for 5 min at 25 °C. The GTPase reaction was initiated by addition of 100 nm [γ-32P]GTP (∼4 × 105 dpm/pmol). The GTPase rate constants were calculated by fitting the experimental data to an exponential function: % GTP hydrolyzed = 100(1 − e −kt), where k is a rate constant for GTP hydrolysis. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar) using IgG as a standard or using calculated extinction coefficients at 280 nm. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by the method of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar) in 12% acrylamide gels. Rhodopsin concentrations were measured using the difference in absorbance at 500 nm between “dark” and bleached ROS preparations. Fitting of the experimental data was performed with nonlinear least squares criteria using GraphPad Prizm (version 2) software. The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of triplicate measurements. Six residues directly interacting with RGS4 are different in Giα1 and Gsα (12Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). These residues correspond to Lys176, Thr178, Ile181, Ser202, Lys205, and His209 of Gtα. Except for a conservative substitution, Gtα Ile181/Giα1 Val185, these residues are identical in Gtα and Giα1. To analyze functional consequences of the replacement of these Gtα residues by corresponding Gsα residues we took advantage of the efficient expression of functional Gtα/Giα1 chimeras in E. coli (18Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). All the Gtα mutants were made based on Chi8 that contains 80% of Gtα amino acid sequence, including all three Gtα switch regions (18Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Analysis of Chi8 GTPase activity showed properties similar to native Gtα. The GTP hydrolysis by Chi8 alone or in the presence of uROS was negligible (not shown). In the presence of both, uROS and Gtβγ, the basal GTPase activity of Chi8 was 0.016 ± 0.002 s−1 (Fig. 1). A similar rate of GTP hydrolysis (0.019 s−1) was observed earlier for holotransducin, Gtαβγ, reconstituted with uROS under similar conditions (14Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17444-17449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This suggests that despite a lack of myristoylation and the His6-tag attached to the N terminus, Chi8 was competent to interact with Gtβγ and light-activated rhodopsin. The GTPase activity of Chi8 was substantially enhanced in the presence of hRGSr. Addition of 1 μm hRGSr led to acceleration of the GTPase activity by almost 8-fold (k = 0.126 ± 0.018 s−1) (Fig. 1). Stimulation of GTPase activity of transducin by hRGSr under similar conditions was ∼10-fold (14Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17444-17449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the dose dependence of the stimulation of Chi8 GTPase activity by hRGSr yielded an EC50 value of 109 ± 15 nm (Fig. 2 A), which correlates well with the EC50 value of 85 nm for the effect of hRGSr on transducin (24Natochin M. Lipkin V.M. Artemyev N.O. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Effects of hRGSr on the GTPase activity of Chi8 suggest that this chimeric G-protein was an appropriate target for the site-directed mutagenesis.Figure 2Dose dependence of GTPase activity stimulation of Gtα mutants by hRGSr. The GTPase rate constants for Gtα mutants in suspensions of urea-washed ROS membranes (5 μm rhodopsin, 2 μmGtα mutant, 1 μm Gtβγ) were determined in the presence of increasing concentrations of hRGSr. Symbols indicate EC50 values as follows: □, 109 ± 15 nm (Chi8); ⋄, 103 ± 17 nm (T178S); ▿, 186 ± 24 nm (I181F); ▵, 147 ± 13 nm (K205R); ▪, 337 ± 25 nm (H209Q); ▴, 129 ± 21 nm (K176L); ♦, S202D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Expression of Chi8 and all six Gtα mutants, Lys176 → Leu, Thr178 → Ser, Ile181 → Phe, Ser202 → Asp, Lys205 → Arg, and His209 → Gln produced comparable amounts of fully soluble proteins (∼5–7 mg/liter of culture). Mutants Lys176 → Leu, Ile181 → Phe, Lys205 → Arg, and His209 → Gln, similarly to Chi8 and transducin, had basal GTPase activities in the range of 0.014–0.023 s−1 (Fig. 1). The Ser202→ Asp mutation led to a small reduction in the basal GTPase rate (k = 0.012 ± 0.001 s−1). Interestingly, Gtα Thr178 → Ser had an elevated basal GTPase activity (k = 0.032 ± 0.003 s−1) (Fig. 1). The maximal stimulation of GTPase activity of Thr178 → Ser, Ile181 → Phe, Lys205 → Arg and His209 → Gln mutants by hRGSr was 5.0–7.5-fold, comparable with the effects of hRGSr on Chi8 (Fig. 2 A). A lower, only ∼3-fold, maximal GTPase rate enhancement resulted from addition of hRGSr to Gtα Lys176 → Leu (Fig. 2 B). hRGSr failed to elicit any notable stimulation of GTPase activity of Gtα Ser202 → Asp (Fig. 2 B). The concentration dependence curves for stimulation of GTPase activity of different mutants by hRGSr revealed modest variations in the EC50values. Mutants Lys176 → Leu, Thr178 → Ser, Ile181 → Phe, and Lys205 → Arg had the EC50 values comparable with the EC50 value for Chi8 and transducin, suggesting that these mutations did not alter affinity of the G-protein-RGS interaction (Fig. 2, A and B). A 3-fold increase in the EC50 value was observed for the His209 → Gln mutant (EC50337 ± 25 nm) (Fig. 2 A). Binding between the Gtα mutants and hRGSr was examined using precipitation of mutants by glutathione-agarose beads containing immobilized GST-hRGSr. hRGSr, as many other RGS proteins, binds with high affinity to the AlF4− conformation of G-protein α-subunits (7Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 9Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17444-17449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The binding assay demonstrated that GST-hRGSr in the presence of AlF4−was able to precipitate nearly stoichiometric amounts of Chi8, and all of the Gtα mutants, except Gtα Ser202 → Asp (Fig. 3 A). The competence of hRGSr to efficiently precipitate the mutant Lys176 → Leu is consistent with the EC50 value of 129 nm for the stimulation of its GTPase activity, even though the maximal GTPase enhancement by hRGSr for this mutant was substantially decreased. Gtα Ser202 → Asp failed to bind GST-hRGSr using this assay (Fig. 3 A). The failure of Gtα Ser202 → Asp to bind GST-hRGSr is not caused by its inability to bind AlF4− and assume an active conformation. Chi8 and the Ser202 → Asp mutant demonstrated equivalent degrees of protection of their switch II region from tryptic cleavage upon binding of AlF4− (Fig. 3 B). The binding data indicate correlation between the stimulatory effects of hRGSr on the Gtα mutants in the GTPase assay and ability of hRGRr to bind these mutants. The deficiency of hRGSr to stimulate GTPase activity of Gtα Ser202 → Asp has resulted from the loss of the affinity of this interaction. However, the Lys176 → Leu substitution appeared to produce a different result. The reduction in the maximal GTPase acceleration of Gtα Lys176 → Leu occurred without a concurrent decrease in affinity of the G-protein/RGS interaction. Based on the crystal structure of RGS4 bound to Giα1·AlF4−(12Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), a residue Ser202 makes a contact with hRGSr residue Glu129. We have tested the possibility that a complementary replacement of hRGSr residue Glu129 by Ala would restore the ability of hRGSr to interact and stimulate GTPase activity of Gtα Ser202 → Asp. hRGSr Glu129→ Ala was fully active toward Chi8 and five of its mutants, but deficient of any GAP activity toward Gtα Ser202 → Asp (not shown). Similarly, to the wild type hRGSr, the Glu129 → Ala mutant failed to bind Gtα Ser202 → Asp, whereas its binding to Chi8 was intact (Fig. 3 C). Since its recent discovery, the family of RGS proteins has been rapidly growing. Those RGS proteins that have already been extensively characterized share a common specificity pattern. These RGS proteins interact with G-protein α-subunits from Gi and Gq families but have no activity toward Gs(6Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Both possibilities remain open: a member(s) of the RGS family capable of interaction with Gsα (G12α) has not been yet identified or characterized, or none of the RGS proteins would be a GAP for Gsα (G12α). The answer to this question lies in understanding the structural details and requirements for RGS/G-protein interaction. The crystal structure of the complex of RGS4 with Giα1·AlF4−has revealed a structural basis for the inability of RGS4 to interact with Gsα. Six amino acid residues from the RGS/G-protein interface are different between Giα and Gsα (12Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Three of these residues, corresponding to Thr178, Ser202, and His209 in Gtα are conserved among the Giα, Gtα, Gqα, and Gzα subunits that are known to interact with RGS. Another two Gtα residues, Ile181 and Lys205, have homologous substitutions. Ile181 is substituted by Val in Giα and Gzα, and Lys205 is replaced by Arg in Gqα. To identify the residue(s) critical for the failure of Gsα to interact with RGS proteins, we replaced the RGS contact residues in Gtα by corresponding residues in Gsα and examined the ability (EC50 and Vmax) of hRGSr to stimulate GTPase activity of these mutants. hRGSr is a human homologue (hRGSr) of mouse retinal mRGS, which was originally thought to be a retina-specific RGS protein, but later it was found in other tissues as well (13Chen C.K. Wieland T. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12885-12889Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 25Buckbinder L. Velasco-Miguel S. Chen Y. Xu N. Talbott R. Gelbert L. Gao J. Seizinger B.R. Gutkind J.S. Kley N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7868-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Like other characterized RGS proteins, hRGSr interacts with Gi- and Gq-like α-subunits, but does not bind Gsα (24Natochin M. Lipkin V.M. Artemyev N.O. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Substitutions Thr178 → Ser, Ile181 → Phe, and Lys205 → Arg did not significantly alter the activity of hRGSr toward these mutants. While this was not unexpected for the conservative replacement Lys205 → Arg, it was rather surprising for the Thr178 → Ser mutant. The corresponding Giα1 Thr182 residue interacts with seven invariant or highly conserved residues of RGS4 and, thus, even homologous substitution by Ser could have had a major impact on the Gα/RGS interaction (12Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). It appears that Ser may substitute Thr178 suitably in most of the RGS contacts. Another substitution that did not interfere with the affinity of Gtα binding to hRGSr is Lys176 → Leu. This is consistent with the lack of conservation at this position between Gtα, Gqα, and Gzα. Interestingly, however, this mutation led to a substantial reduction in the GTPase Vmax value elicited by hRGSr. Perhaps the lower stimulated GTPase activity of the Lys176 → Leu mutant reflects an intrinsic partial impairment of the catalytic site not evident from the basal GTPase activity. The adjacent Gtα Thr177 residue is intimately involved in the GTP hydrolysis (26Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) and may not be fully stabilized in the RGS/Gtα Lys176 → Leu complex. The Lys176 → Leu mutation highlights the possibility that Gsα may have a limited ability for stimulation by RGS proteins assuming there is one that binds Gsα. A modest decrease in the affinity for hRGSr without significantly affecting the maximal degree of the GTPase rate acceleration was observed for Gtα His209 → Gln. The most severe outcome for the Gtα/hRGSr interaction was caused by the Ser202 → Asp mutation. This mutation resulted in the loss of hRGSr binding. The crystal structure of Giα1 with RGS4 provides a rationale for such an outcome (12Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). A negative charge introduced by the Asp residue might be repelled by the negative charge of the counteracting Glu129 residue of hRGSr, which corresponds to the Glu126 residue of RGS4. However, the Glu residue is not absolutely conserved in RGS proteins. A number of RGS proteins, RGS1, RGS6, and RGS7, have residues other than Glu at this position. Small uncharged residues such as the Ala residue in RGS7 might be the most accommodating residue for Asp. We found that the Glu129 → Ala substitution in hRGSr cannot rescue the ability of hRGSr to interact with Gtα Ser202 → Asp. Perhaps, additional residue(s) such as Asn131 of hRGSr (Asn128 of RGS4) also interferes with the Asp side chain. RGS4 Asn128 makes a contact with Giα1 Ser206 (Ser202of Gtα). The RGS Asn residue is critical for the RGS/Gα interaction (12Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), and may only be substituted by Ser, though with a notable loss of the RGS affinity for Gtα (20Natochin M. McEntaffer R.L. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 (in press)Google Scholar). Quite possibly, an interference of the Gα Asp residue with the network of interactions involving the hRGSr Asn131 residue is also responsible for the lack of interaction between hRGSr and Gtα Ser202 → Asp. The degree of impairment of the RGS/Gα interaction in the Ser202 → Asp mutant allows us to speculate that the corresponding Asp229 of Gsα is mainly responsible for the inability of Gsα to interact with characterized RGS proteins. Other differences in RGS contact residues between Gsα and the Gi-like α-subunits could be more easily accommodated by limited variability of different RGS domains. Our results do not support a likelihood that one of the currently identified RGS proteins may serve as a GAP for Gsα. Nevertheless, they provide a direction toward identification of potential candidates for interaction with Gsα among yet undiscovered RGS proteins. We thank R. McEntaffer for technical assistance and Drs. H. Hamm and N. Skiba for providing us with the Gtα/Giα expression vector."

The consensus sequence for t-PA cleavage was X(Y/F/R)GR↓(X′)A, whereX is a large hydrophobic residue and X′ can be several different residues but is most often arginine, whereas the optimal sequence for u-PA was GSGR↓SA. We then obtained 6–14 amino acid peptides containing these sequences and demonstrated that hydrolysis by either t-PA or u-PA occurred with the selectivity predicted by the consensus sequences derived from the substrate phage display.We now examine whether highly selective proteolysis can be targeted to engineered protein substrates. Proteolytic cleavage within internal surface loops is likely to be more challenging than hydrolysis of peptides because target sequences are constrained within a structured scaffold at both their amino and carboxyl termini. Little information has been reported regarding the interaction of plasminogen activators with any protein substrate except their physiologic target, Plg. However, data that does exist suggests significant differences in the behavior of t-PA toward peptides and proteins. First, peptides containing the amino acid sequence of the physiological cleavage site within Plg are poor substrates, but Plg is efficiently hydrolyzed (9Madison E.L. Coombs G.S. Corey D.R. J. Biol.

These authors conclude that up to 12 residues surrounding the scissile bonds would have to be deformed for these target sites to form interactions with proteases that are similar to those observed in trypsin-inhibitor complexes (interactions presumed to be similar to those formed within protease-substrate complexes). These observations suggest that the context of a target sequence can determine its ability to be a substrate and that interactions separate from those of the primary subsites in the substrate binding cleft may make significant contributions to proteolysis.In this report, we investigate the importance of target site mobility and primary sequence for selective cleavage of engineered protein substrates by t-PA and u-PA. We replaced residues 44–51 within the 43–52 (or Ω) loop of staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) with optimal t-PA or u-PA cleavage sites and measured kinetic parameters for proteolysis of these engineered protein substrates. t-PA and u-PA efficiently cleave the engineered SNase variants despite substrate loop constraint due to amino- and carboxyl-terminal attachment to core-forming structural elements of the protein, and both enzymes exhibit the same relative sequence selectivity observed for cleavage of peptide substrates, confirming that proteins can be engineered to be selectively labile to t-PA or u-PA. These studies indicate that highly selective proteases can hydrolyze introduced sequences within proteins. To regulate biological processes proteases must efficiently hydrolyze selected peptide bonds in target proteins while leaving other proteins intact.

Understanding mechanisms by which such proteases restrict their specificities in vivo may aid identification of physiologically relevant substrates and facilitate design of proteases with novel, highly restricted specificities.

Fibrinolysis. 1994; 8: 221-236Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). t-PA is stringently selective for its physiologic substrate plasminogen (Plg), even though its protease domain has high homology to the nonselective protease trypsin (43% overall and 87% within residues conserved in all known trypsins) (8Rypniewski W.R.

Heme oxygenase (HO), 1The abbreviations used are: HO, heme oxygenase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Mb, myoglobin. a microsomal protein, catalyzes the regiospecific oxidative degradation of iron protoporphyrin IX (heme hereafter) to biliverdin, CO, and Fe in the presence of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, which functions as an electron donor (1Tenhunen R.

In the catalytic cycle of HO, the enzyme first binds one equivalent of heme to form a heme-enzyme complex, which exhibits spectroscopic properties similar to those of myoglobins and hemoglobins (4Yoshida T.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5531-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The first electron donated from the reductase reduces the ferric heme iron to the ferrous state, and a molecule of oxygen subsequently binds to form a metastable oxy form (8Yoshida T. Noguchi M. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4418-4420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent electron donation to the oxy form initiates the three stepwise oxygenase reactions during which CO and an iron-biliverdin complex are produced. Heme, therefore, participates both as the prosthetic group for oxygen activation and as the substrate for the enzyme catalysis, a property unique to HO (9Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4230-4236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of two isoforms of heme oxygenase has been established: 33-kDa heme oxygenase isoform-1, HO-1, which is inducible and highly expressed in the liver and spleen tissues; and 36-kDa heme oxygenase isoform-2, HO-2, which is constitutive and distributed throughout the body (3Maines M.D. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2557-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar). The two isoforms are products of two distinctly different genes (10Yoshida T. Biro P. Cohen T. Muller R.M. Shibahara S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 11McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Ewing J.F. Maines M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence similarity between the two isoforms is only about 40% with an extra N-terminal 20-amino acid sequence present in HO-2; however, there are two stretches of highly conserved sequences with matched predicted secondary structure (11McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Ewing J.F. Maines M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Both HO-1 and HO-2 have hydrophobic sequences at their C-terminal ends which have been proposed to be involved in binding to microsomal membranes (12Shibahara S. Muller R.M. Taguchi H. Yoshida T.

A recent development in the bacterial expression of a 30-kDa soluble form of rat HO-1, which lacks the hydrophobic C-terminal domain, has made it possible to prepare HO-1 in the quantities required for structural studies (15Ito-Maki M. Ishikawa K. Mansfield Matera K. Sato M. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Mansfield Matera K. Zhou H. Migita C.T.

By combination of optical absorption, EPR, resonance Raman scattering, and site-directed mutagenesis, we have established that the axial heme ligand in the heme·HO-1 complex is a neutral form of the imidazole of His-25 (6Takahashi S.

Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13734-13740Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Our spectroscopic and enzymatic examinations of the 28-kDa tryptic HO-2 fragment-heme complex has shown that both isoforms display the same enzymatic activity and that the two isoforms have homologous active site structures: the proximal ligand of the heme HO-2 complex is also a neutral imidazole of the histidine residue (18Ishikawa K. Takeuchi N. Takahashi S. Matera K.M. Sato M. Shibahara S. Rousseau D.L. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6345-6350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Hence, the molecular mechanism of the enzyme action is presumed to be similar between the two isoforms. Sequence comparison predicts that His-45 in the HO-2 sequence corresponds to His-25 of HO-1, and thus, His-45 appears to be a primary candidate for the heme proximal ligand in the heme-HO-2 complex. However, Maines and co-workers (19McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Maines M.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Huang T.J. Maines M. J.

His-132 in HO-1 does not play a role in the enzyme catalysis but is an important residue for folding the HO-1 protein (15Ito-Maki M. Ishikawa K. Mansfield Matera K. Sato M. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T.

HO-2 has attracted attention recently since the CO produced by HO-2 has been proposed to serve as a physiological messenger molecule in neurotransmission and vascular tone regulation (21Brune B. Ullrich V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 32: 497-504PubMed Google Scholar, 22Verma A. Hirsch D.J. Glatt C.E. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H.

In light of the physiological significance of HO-2, we think it important to determine the roles of the conserved histidine residues and the heme axial ligand in the heme·HO-2 complex. To this end, we have developed a new bacterial expression system for a 33-kDa truncated, soluble human HO-2 protein lacking its C-terminal membrane anchoring segment. Using this expression system, we have prepared two mutants of HO-2, H45A and H152A. We report here that the His-152 to Ala mutation retains the heme oxygenase activity and that His-152 is not a significant residue for the enzyme function but an important residue for stability of the heme oxygenase protein. In contrast, the His-45 to Ala replacement abolishes the enzyme activity, and spectroscopic examination establishes that the imidazole group of His-45 is the axial ligand in the heme·HO-2 complex. The sources of reagents are as follows: T4 polynucleotide kinase and sequencing primer for pTV118N, P7 (3′-CAGCACTGACCCTTTTGGGACCGC-5′), from Toyobo; restriction endonucleases, from New England Biolabs; T4 DNA ligase from Boehringer Mannheim; DyeDeoxyTM Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit from Perkin-Elmer Corp.; Pfu polymerase from Stratagene; ampicillin, hemin, and bovine serum albumin from Sigma; nitrocellulose membranes from Micron Separations Inc.; Sephadex G-75 from Pharmacia; DE-32 from Whatman; peroxidase-conjugated sheep IgG against rabbit IgG from Cappel; synthetic oligonucleotides from Sawady Technology;Escherichia coli strain BL21 from Novagen. A T-7 promoter prokaryotic expression vector, pMW172, was a generous gift from Dr. K. Nagai (MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, U.K.). NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase was solubilized from rat liver microsomes with Triton X-100 and purified by the method of Yasukochi and Masters (25Yasukochi Y. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5337-5344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Partially purified biliverdin reductase was prepared from the cytosolic fraction of porcine spleen by the method of Noguchiet al. (26Noguchi M. Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 93: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In our previous work on human HO-2, we constructed an expression vector for the full-length human HO-2 protein, pTVHHO2 (18Ishikawa K. Takeuchi N. Takahashi S. Matera K.M. Sato M. Shibahara S.

Trypsin digestion of the recombinant full-length HO-2 yielded an enzymatically active 28-kDa tryptic fragment of the enzyme encompassing from Met-30 to Lys-274. Because the “putative” key His residue at position 45 is very close to the N-terminal after the tryptic digestion (Met-30), we were concerned with possible effects from the removal of the N-terminal 29 amino acids on the HO function. In addition, expression and purification of a water-soluble form is expected to be easier than the tryptic digestion of the detergent-solubilized full-length protein during the purification process as manifested in the recombinant HO-1 protein preparation (15Ito-Maki M.

Therefore, in this work, we have constructed a new expression vector, pMWΔHHO2, which contains a human HO-2 cDNA coding sequence covering the amino acid residues from 1 to 288, from the full-length HO-2 expression vector, pTVHHO2, which was used in our previous studies (18Ishikawa K. Takeuchi N. Takahashi S. Matera K.M. Sato M. Shibahara S. Rousseau D.L. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. J. Biol.

The larger DNA fragment includes the pTV118N expression vector and the 1 to 63 nucleotide HO-2 coding sequence (the A of the initiation codon ATG is defined as nucleotide residue 1). The smaller DNA fragment corresponds to the HO-2 cDNA sequence from 64 to 997. The smaller DNA fragment was further cleaved by BpmI, and the ApaI/BpmI fragment, which includes the HO-2 coding sequence from 64 to 850, was isolated. Synthetic nucleotides, 5′-TCCGAACAGCTATGTAGGTAC-3′ and 3′-GAAGGCTTGTCGATACATC-5′ were phosphorylated and annealed. The largerApaI/KpnI fragment of pTVHHO2, theApaI/BpmI fragment, and the double-stranded oligonucleotide were ligated to form the pTVΔHHO2 plasmid, which includes the human HO-2 coding sequence from Met-1 to Met-288 but lacks the coding sequence for the human HO-2 C-terminal hydrophobic region (Ala-289 to Met-316). A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out with pTVΔHHO2 as a template and a synthetic nucleotide X (5′-AACAGCATATGGAGCGCCCACAGCTCGA-3′) and P7 as primers. The nucleotide X corresponds to the nucleotide sequence from positions −8 to +20 of pTVΔHHO2, except that ACC at positions from −3 to −1 was changed to CAT so as to create a new NdeI restriction site. The target fragment was digested with NdeI and HindIII and cloned into pMW172 to construct pMWΔHHO2. Two independent PCRs for construction of pMWΔH45A, in which His-45 was replaced by Ala, were performed with pMWΔHHO2 as a template DNA. Primers for the 5′-side region amplification were a synthetic nucleotide X and a mutagenic primer (3′-GGTTCCTTCGTCGGCTGGCCCGTCT-5′). The underlined bases are complementary codon for Ala-45. Primers for the 3′-side region amplification were a flanking primer (5′-AAACACCCAGTTTGTCAAGGACTTC-3′) and a synthetic nucleotide Y (3′-GGCTTTCCTTCGACTCAACCGACGACGGTG-5′) which is the complementary nucleotide sequence from positions 2,461 to 2,490 of pMW172 plasmid. The fragments for the 5′-side region and the 3′-side region, obtained after PCRs, were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and then digested by AccI and HindIII, respectively. The resulting two fragments were cloned into the pMWΔHHO2 predigested by AccI and HindIII. For construction of pMWΔH152A, a similar procedure was employed except that oligonucleotides of 3′-ATGACCACCGGCGACGTATGTGGGC-5′ (the underlined bases are complementary codon of Ala-152) and 5′-CTACATGGGGGATCTCTCGGGGGGC-3′ were used as mutagenic and flanking primers, respectively. The entire coding sequences of these plasmids were determined by an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer. A fresh single colony of E. coli strain BL21 transformed with pMWΔHHO2 was precultured overnight at 37 °C in 10 ml of Luria-Bertani medium. Then, 100 μl of the preculture was used to inoculate 500-ml cultures in the same medium, which was incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The harvested cells carrying the HO-2 expression vector, pMWΔHHO2, were green, while control cells transformed with pMW172 were brown. The green color is due to the conversion of heme to biliverdin in the bacterial cells as observed in the bacterial expression of HO-1 protein (13Ishikawa K. Sato M. Yoshida T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Mansfield Matera K. Zhou H. Migita C.T. Hobert S.E. Ishikawa K. Katakura K. Maeshima H. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4909-4915Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The harvested cells were washed and lysed as described previously (15Ito-Maki M. Ishikawa K. Mansfield Matera K. Sato M. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis showed a major band, with a molecular mass of 33 kDa, in the soluble fraction of the cells harboring the expression vector but not in the precipitated fraction. In contrast, the 33-kDa band did not appear in the lysates of the control cells. The 33-kDa band cross-reacted with the human HO-2 antibody. These results indicate that the truncated HO-2 protein, ΔHHO-2, with a molecular mass of 33 kDa was expressed in the bacteria and present in the soluble fraction of the bacterial lysate. A minor band with a molecular mass of 31 kDa was also present in the soluble fraction. This band likely corresponds to a partially degraded form of ΔHHO-2 because this band is also reactive to antibodies against human HO-2. The soluble fraction obtained after centrifugation was treated with solid ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate was obtained between 35 and 55% ammonium sulfate saturation. The precipitate was dissolved in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and the HO-2 protein was purified by the two-step column chromatography on Sephadex G-75 and DE-32, according to the procedures used for the truncated rat HO-1 (15Ito-Maki M. Ishikawa K. Mansfield Matera K. Sato M. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), except that the buffer did not contain phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The purified enzyme showed a single protein band of 33 kDa on SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. About 20 mg of pure ΔHHO-2 was obtained from a single 500-ml culture. E. coli BL21 transformed with pMWΔH45A was cultured as described for the expression of wild-type. The harvested cells transformed with pMWΔH45A were not green but brown. However, when the cell lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE, we could detect a 33-kDa major band with a minor band at 31 kDa, as observed for the wild-type HO-2 expression. As is the case for the wild-type expression, these two bands were present in the soluble fraction but were absent in the precipitated fraction. They cross-reacted with the human HO-2 antibody. As the ΔH45A mutant was recovered in the soluble fraction, we purified this mutant by the same procedure as that used for the wild-type enzyme, except that Western blotting analysis was utilized to detect the mutant HO-2 protein. E. coli BL21 transformed with pMWΔH152A was cultured as described for the expression of wild-type. The harvested cells carrying pMWΔH152A were brown indicating that endogenous heme was not converted to biliverdin. However, SDS-PAGE analysis of the lysate of the harvested cells clearly showed that a protein band with a molecular mass of 33 kDa was expressed. The 33-kDa protein cross-reacted with the HO-2 antibody, indicating that ΔH152A was indeed expressed at the same level as the wild-type enzyme but that the expressed enzyme did not exhibit enzyme activity in the E. coli. SDS-PAGE also demonstrated that ΔH152A was recovered exclusively in the precipitated fraction. These observations suggest that the expressed ΔH152A protein accumulates in the host cells as an inclusion body. Therefore, we purified ΔH152A from inclusion bodies as described below. To 10 g of packed cells in 100 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) containing 2 mm EDTA were added 10 mg of lysozyme and stirred for 1 h at 4 °C. The mixture was then sonicated 10 times at maximum power with a Branson Sonifier 250 for 30 s with a 4-min interval between sonication and centrifuged at 8,000 ×g for 20 min. The precipitates were suspended with 100 ml of 0.5 m sucrose with a Hitachi HG 30 homogenizer, followed by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 20 min. Precipitates were treated with 100 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1% sodium deoxycholate. The mixture was left for 1 h and then centrifuged at 8,000 ×g for 20 min. The resulting precipitates were solubilized by homogenization in 10 ml of 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) containing 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 8 m urea, followed by dialysis for 24 h against 2 liters of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol; the buffer was replaced 3 times. No SH-protecting reagents were added to the final buffer. After dialysis, the sample was centrifuged at 100,500 × gfor 30 min, and the supernatant was collected. The supernatant was judged as a pure soluble H152A protein by SDS-PAGE. The assay method was similar to that described previously (4Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4224-4229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The standard reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 1.5 ml of 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, an appropriate amount of HO, 30 nmol of hemin, 0.15 mg of bovine serum albumin, partially purified biliverdin reductase (5 nmol/min), 1 μmol of NADPH, and 1 unit of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. The reaction was initiated by the addition of NADPH and was carried out for 10 min at 37 °C. The absorbance difference at 468 nm was recorded between the standard and control systems; the latter system contained all components except for NADPH. The value of 43.5 mm−1cm−1 was used for the extinction coefficient of bilirubin at 468 nm (4Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4224-4229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the formation of 1 nmol of bilirubin/h under these conditions. Light absorption spectra were recorded by Hewlett-Packard 8453 and Hitachi U-3210 spectrophotometers at 20 °C. EPR spectra were obtained by a Bruker ESP-300 spectrometer operating at 9.45 GHz equipped with an Oxford liquid helium flow cryostat. Microwave frequency was monitored by a frequency counter (HP-5350), and an NMR gauss meter (Bruker ER-035 m) was used to determine the magnetic flux density. Far-UV CD spectra (260 to 160 nm) were measured as described previously (15Ito-Maki M. Ishikawa K. Mansfield Matera K. Sato M. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with polyclonal HO-2 antibodies (27Yoshida T. Ishikawa K. Sato M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and protein assay by Lowry's method (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were performed according to the published procedures. The specific activity of the purified ΔHHO-2 was about 1,100 nmol of bilirubin formed/mg of protein/h when assayed with NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase system. Purified ΔHHO-2 binds hemin at 1:1 molar ratio, and the optical absorption spectra of the ΔHHO2-heme complex in ferric, ferrous, and ferrous-CO forms were identical to those of the 28-kDa tryptic HO-2 fragment-heme complex (18Ishikawa K. Takeuchi N. Takahashi S. Matera K.M. Sato M. Shibahara S. Rousseau D.L. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6345-6350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We designate the 33-kDa water soluble form, ΔHHO-2, as wild-type for the purpose of discussion. Purified ΔH45A had no heme degradation activity when assayed by NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reducatase. Thus, His-45 of HO-2 is clearly essential for the heme degradation activity. One might claim that the loss of the enzyme activity in ΔH45A is due to the unfolding of the protein induced by the mutation. In a recent mutant Mb study, Hargrove et al. (29Hargrove M. Krzywda S. Wilkinson A.J. Dou Y. Ikeda-Saito M. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11676-11775Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar) found that mutations in the heme pocket can drastically alter the stability of apoMb, and some heme-pocket mutants of apoMb assume unfolded structures. To examine this possibility, we measured the CD spectra of wild-type and ΔH45A between 260 and 180 nm. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the CD spectrum for ΔH45A is indistinguishable from that of the wild-type spectrum, thus the His-45 to Ala mutation does not appear to alter the global protein structure of the enzyme. This implies that the abolished enzyme activity of ΔH45A is not due to mutation-induced protein unfolding but to the specific effect of His-45 to Ala replacement. To examine whether or not His-45 is the heme-linked residue of the heme-HO complex, we characterized the heme·ΔH45A complex spectroscopically. Fig. 1 B compares the optical absorption spectra of the ferric form of an equivalent mixture of heme and ΔH45A with that of wild-type. The heme·wild-type complex exhibits a 6-coordinate ferric high spin spectrum (18Ishikawa K. Takeuchi N. Takahashi S. Matera K.M. Sato M. Shibahara S. Rousseau D.L. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6345-6350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), whereas a significantly different spectrum is observed for the heme·ΔH45A complex. The Soret maximum of the mutant complex is blue shifted to 400 nm, and its intensity is reduced with respect to that of the wild-type spectrum; the heme iron in the ΔH45A complex is also in a high spin state, but the spectral change upon the His-45 to Ala mutation is an indication of an altered coordination structure in the mutant complex. The optical absorption spectrum is similar to that of the heme complex of HO-1 ΔH25A, a proximal His to Ala ΔHO-1 mutant (15Ito-Maki M. Ishikawa K. Mansfield Matera K. Sato M. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Since the Soret region optical absorption spectrum of the heme-ΔH45A complex is different from that of free heme in pH 7 buffer, spectrophotometric titration of ΔH45A with hemin was carried out utilizing this difference. As shown in the inset of Fig. 1 B, the titration curve of the combination of ΔH45A with hemin shows a well defined inflection point from which the molar stoichiometry of their binding was estimated to be 1:1. Therefore, we conclude that ΔH45A can form a stoichiometric complex with hemin just as wild-type does. The heme-ΔH45A complex exhibited an EPR spectrum of a ferric high spin hemoprotein at 6 K (data not shown). As seen for the spectrum of the heme complex of HO-1 ΔH25A (15Ito-Maki M. Ishikawa K. Mansfield Matera K. Sato M. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the g⊥ signal of the H45A spectrum is broader than that of the wild-type spectrum, indicating that the electronic structure of the heme iron in ΔH45A is different from that of wild-type. The spectral changes upon His-45 to Ala mutation indicate possible changes in the coordination state of the heme iron. Fig. 2 compares the EPR spectrum of the15NO-bound ferrous heme-ΔH45A complex to that of the wild-type complex. The spectral shape of the ΔH45A mutant complex is typical of a five coordinate 15NO heme species (30Kon H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 379: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and the spectrum of the wild-type complex is 6 coordinate with an imidazole axial ligand as reported for the 28-kDa tryptic HO-2 fragment (18Ishikawa K. Takeuchi N. Takahashi S. Matera K.M. Sato M. Shibahara S. Rousseau D.L. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6345-6350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This infers that, in the ΔH45A NO complex, the fifth coordination of the heme iron is vacant. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that His-45 is the proximal axial iron ligand in the heme·HO-2 complex and that the proximal His is essential for the HO-2 enzyme catalysis. This conclusion contradicts the proposal of Maines and co-workers who reported that His-152 might be the proximal heme ligand (19McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Maines M.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Huang T.J. Maines M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12568-12574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To address this discrepancy, we have prepared a His-152 to Ala mutant and examined its enzymatic and spectroscopic properties. Specific heme degradation activity of H152A solubilized from inclusion bodies was only ∼150 nmol of bilirubin formed/mg of protein/h under NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase system, about one-sixth of the wild-type enzyme activity. This indicates that either the soluble fraction contained a considerable amount of non-functional ΔH152A mutant protein or His-152 to Ala mutation reduces the HO enzyme activity. To assess the possibility of the presence of nonfunctional ΔH152A protein, we subjected the soluble fraction to gel-filtration column chromatography on Sephadex G-75. The elution profile of the G-75 column chromatography showed the presence of two protein peaks, one eluted at the void-volume and the other at the same elution volume as the wild-type protein. The latter fraction has a molecular mass of 33 kDa. Western blotting analysis showed both fractions cross-reacted with the native HO-2 antibody. The far-UV CD spectrum of the 33-kDa fraction was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type enzyme, indicating that the ΔH152A protein eluted as the 33-kDa fraction is properly folded. The void-volume fraction became turbid and its CD spectrum could not be obtained. The 33-kDa peak, which appeared to be homogenous as judged by the SDS-PAGE, had the same heme degradation activity as that of the wild-type enzyme. This is in contrast to the results of Maines and co-workers who claimed that His-152 is an essential His residue for the enzyme activity of HO-2 (19McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Maines M.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Huang T.J. Maines M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12568-12574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We used the second peak, 33 kDa HO-2 as ΔH152A, in the following experiments. The optical absorption spectra of the heme-H152A in the ferrous, ferrous-CO, and ferrous-O2 forms were also the same as those of the wild-type complex (not shown). There was no difference detected in the auto-oxidation rate of the oxy form of the heme complex between ΔH152A and wild-type. In myoglobin, the hydrogen bond between the distal His and the bound oxygen plays a most crucial role in the inhibition of myoglobin heme iron auto-oxidation (31Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 69-714Crossref Scopus (728) Google Scholar). If His-152 forms a hydrogen bond with the bound-oxygen, the rate of auto-oxidation rate of ΔH152A is expected to be different from that of the wild-type heme·HO complex. Fig. 3 illustrates the pH-dependent changes in the light absorption spectrum of the ferric heme·ΔH152A complex between pH 7 and 9.5. At pH 7, the heme·ΔH152A complex exhibits a typical hexacoordinate high spin spectrum with a Soret peak at 404 nm and bands at 500 and 631 nm in the visible region; the spectrum is indistinguishable from that of the wild-type heme complex shown in Fig. 1 B. At alkaline pH, the high spin spectrum is replaced by a spectrum with bands at 413, 540, and 575 nm, which is identical to the wild-type spectrum in alkaline pH (18Ishikawa K. Takeuchi N. Takahashi S. Matera K.M. Sato M. Shibahara S. Rousseau D.L. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6345-6350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This pH-dependent spectral change is reversible between pH 6 and 9.5, and the pKa value of the change is estimated to be 8.5 as shown in the inset of Fig. 3. These features, including spectral shape, peak positions, and the pKa value of the spectral transitions, are identical to those of the heme complex of the 28-kDa tryptic fragment of human HO-2 (18Ishikawa K. Takeuchi N. Takahashi S. Matera K.M. Sato M. Shibahara S. Rousseau D.L. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6345-6350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). If His-152 is linked with the coordinated water molecule in the ferric form, the pK value of the acid-base transition for the ΔH152A complex should be different from that of the wild-type complex. It is intriguing to consider why the same HO-2 mutant, H152A, used by Maines and co-workers (19McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Maines M.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Huang T.J. Maines M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12568-12574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), had little enzyme activity while our mutant is fully active. We have been using human HO-2, while rat HO-2 was used by McCoubrey and Maines (19McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Maines M.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence around His-152 is quite similar between these two proteins; hence, it is highly unlikely that the difference in species is the cause of the discrepancies in the enzymatic properties. We used the purified ΔH152A protein for the spectroscopic and enzymatic studies, but Maines and co-workers did not purify the mutant enzyme. McCoubrey and Maines (19McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Maines M.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) measured heme oxygenase activity using a Triton-solubilized fraction of the precipitates of the bacterial cells in which H152A protein was expressed. It is possible that the preparations used by McCoubrey and Maines contained a significant amount of the unfunctional fraction of the mutant protein, since HO protein purification procedures required for removal of the unfunctional fraction were not employed in their work. It is also conceivable that the Triton-solubilized fraction used by McCoubrey and Maines might contain very small amounts of the H152A protein because Triton X-100 does not solubilize proteins from inclusion bodies (33Marston F.A.O. Lowe P.A. Doel M.T. Schoemaker J.M. White S. Angal S. Bio/Technology. 1984; : 800-804Google Scholar). The diminished enzyme activity of H152A reported by McCoubrey and Maines (19McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Maines M.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) could be accounted for either by the presence of nonfunctional fractions and/or the absence of the mutant enzyme in their Triton X-100 bacterial extracts from the E. coli. Whatever the reason for the apparent discrepancies, the ΔH152A mutant enzyme prepared by our method exhibits spectroscopic and enzymatic properties essentially identical to those of the wild-type enzyme. Hence, we conclude that H152A is not an important residue for catalysis by this enzyme. His-152 in HO-2 corresponds to His-132 in HO-1 so that it is also of interest to compare the properties of HO-2 ΔH152A to those of HO-1 ΔH132A. His-132 (HO-1) and His-152 (HO-2) are located in a span of 24 amino acids (residue 146 to 169 for HO-2 and 126 to 149 for HO-1) which is conserved in all forms of heme oxygenase with only one substitution: Leu-138 in HO-1 is replaced by Met in HO-2. HO-1 ΔH132A shares several key molecular properties with HO-2 ΔH152A. Both of them are expressed as inclusion bodies when the same expression system is used. The solubilized fraction of HO-1 ΔH132A from the inclusion body also includes both a functional enzyme and an inactive fraction that can be separated by gel filtration chromatography. As is the case for HO-2 ΔH152A, the purified ΔH132A has spectroscopic and enzymatic properties identical to those of wild-type (16Mansfield Matera K. Zhou H. Migita C.T. Hobert S.E. Ishikawa K. Katakura K. Maeshima H. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4909-4915Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is tempting to propose that HO-1 and HO-2 have the structural features in common at least near this 24-amino acid span. The present results from HO-1 ΔH132A and HO-2 ΔH152A studies demonstrate the need for care in studying the roles of a specific amino acid by site-directed mutagenesis and bacterial expression of recombinant proteins. As is the case for both isoforms of heme oxygenase, certain mutant proteins, such as HO-1 ΔH132A and HO-2 ΔH152A, are expressed in inclusion bodies, while wild-type and other mutants, such as HO-1 ΔH25A and HO-2 ΔH45A, are expressed in soluble fractions (15Ito-Maki M. Ishikawa K. Mansfield Matera K. Sato M. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Mansfield Matera K. Zhou H. Migita C.T. Hobert S.E. Ishikawa K. Katakura K. Maeshima H. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4909-4915Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In these cases, simple enzyme assays using bacterial extracts are not sufficient to conclude whether or not a particular residue is essential for enzyme activity. To avoid premature and erroneous conclusions as seen in the previous work on HO-1 His-132 (32Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Sun J. Loehr T.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and HO-2 His-152 mutants (19McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Maines M.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Huang T.J. Maines M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12568-12574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), possible formation of inclusion bodies must be assessed and careful purification of properly folded protein is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2330061905,"In vivo p53 is multiply phosphorylated by different protein kinases suggesting a central role for phosphorylation in modulating p53 function. In addition, p53 was found to be associated with two protein kinases, p34cdc2 and protein kinase CK2. Here we report the precise mapping of the interaction sites of p53 – p34cdc2 complexes. The p34cdc2 binding site on human p53 maps to one distinct C-terminal site LQIRGRERFE (aa 330 – 339) close to the corresponding phosphorylation site at serine 315. In order to test whether phosphorylation of p53 might influence the binding of p53 to p34cdc2 phosphorylation mutants of the C-terminus of p53, which mimick permanent phosphorylation, were tested on their ability to bind to p34cdc2 in vitro. Substitution of serine 315 (the p34cdc2 phosphorylation site) with aspartic acid had only little effect on complex formation whereas an exchange of serine 392 (the protein kinase CK2 phosphorylation site) to aspartic acid resulted in a significant reduced relative binding affinity of p53 to p34cdc2. The same result was obtained when the C-terminus of p53 was phosphorylated by purified protein kinase CK2 prior to examination of complex formation. In addition, the specificity of the complex formation has been checked by competition experiments with full length p53 proteins and the influence of cyclin B on complex formation was examined."
https://openalex.org/W2324283833,"Bcr is a novel serine/threonine protein kinase that is believed to require two cysteine pairs for activity (Maru and Witte, Cell, 67, 459, 1991). Tyrosine phosphorylated Bcr has dramatically reduced kinase activity, and tyrosine 360 of Bcr, which is one of the sites of phosphorylation by the Bcr – Abl oncoprotein, is required for transkinase activity (Liu et al., Mol. Cell Biol., 16, 998, 1996). Results presented here indicate that Bcr tyrosine 328 is also phosphorylated within Bcr – Abl expressing cells and is required for Bcr's serine/threonine kinase activity. Bcr Y328F, like Bcr Y360F, had defective transkinase activity but can autophosphorylate. However, the Y328F/Y360F double mutant of Bcr is defective in both trans- and autokinase activities. Taken together with the kinase inhibitory effects of tyrosine phosphorylation of Bcr by Bcr – Abl, our studies with tyrosine to phenylalanine Bcr mutants indicate that the hydroxyl residues of tyrosines 328 and 360 play crucial roles in Bcr's kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2061465147,"Human parathyroid hormone (hPTH) is involved in the regulation of the calcium level in blood. This hormone function is located in the NH2-terminal 34 amino acids of the 84-amino acid peptide hormone and is transduced via the adenylate cyclase and the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathways. It is well known that truncation of the two NH2-terminal amino acids of the hormone leads to complete loss of in vivonormocalcemic function. To correlate loss of calcium level regulatory activity after stepwise NH2-terminal truncation and solution structure, we studied the conformations of fragments hPTH-(2–37), hPTH-(3–37), and hPTH-(4–37) in comparison to hPTH-(1–37) in aqueous buffer solution under near physiological conditions by circular dichroism spectroscopy, two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and restrained molecular dynamics calculations. All peptides show helical structures and hydrophobic interactions between Leu-15 and Trp-23 that lead to a defined loop region from His-14 to Ser-17. A COOH-terminal helix from Met-18 to at least Leu-28 was found for all peptides. The helical structure in the NH2-terminal part of the peptides was lost in parallel with the NH2-terminal truncation and can be correlated with the loss of calcium regulatory activity.

Kronenberg H.M. Rosenblatt M. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1982; 35: 323-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). hPTH-(1–37) is the naturally occurring bioactive hormone extractable from human blood (2Forssmann W.G. Schulz-Knappe P. Meyer M. Adermann K. Forssmann K. Hock D. Aoki A. Yanaihara N. Peptide Chemistry. ESCOM, Leiden1993: 553-557Google Scholar, 3Hock D. Mägerlein M. Heine G. Ochlich P.P. Forssmann W.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and hPTH-(1–34) is known to maintain normocalcemia in blood via adenylate cyclase activation. To increase calcium flow into blood, the hormone acts directly on bone and kidney and indirectly on the intestine (1Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Rosenblatt M. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1982; 35: 323-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition to the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway, involvement of the phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis signaling pathway is postulated for these functions (4Coleman D.T. Fitzpatrick A. Bilezikian J.P. Bilezikian J.P. Levine M.A. Marcus R. The Parathyroids. Raven Press, New York1994: 239-258Google Scholar). The receptor binding region mediating the calcium regulatory activity is located within sequence His-14 to Phe-34 (5Caulfield M.P. McKee R.L. Goldmann M.E. Duong L.T. Fisher J.E. Gay C.T.

J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1992; 119: 738-743PubMed Google Scholar). The complete NH2-terminal part of hPTH-(1–34) is required for stimulation of the cAMP-dependent pathway (4Coleman D.T. Fitzpatrick A. Bilezikian J.P. Bilezikian J.P. Levine M.A. Marcus R. The Parathyroids. Raven Press, New York1994: 239-258Google Scholar), and the minimum sequence affecting bone and kidney comprises amino acids 2–27 (1Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Rosenblatt M. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1982; 35: 323-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 7Tregear G.W. van Rietschoten J. Greene E. Keutmann H.T. Niall H.D. Reit B. Parsons J.A. Potts Jr., J.T. Endocrinology. 1973; 93: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Adenylate cyclase activity is lost on deletion of the first NH2-terminal amino acid, whereas receptor binding capacity is not influenced, indicating that the activation region for cAMP production and the receptor binding region are located in two distinct domains (4Coleman D.T. Fitzpatrick A. Bilezikian J.P. Bilezikian J.P. Levine M.A. Marcus R. The Parathyroids. Raven Press, New York1994: 239-258Google Scholar, 8Segre G.V. Rosenblatt M. Reiner B.L. Mahaffey J.E. Potts Jr., J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6980-6986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adenylate cyclase activity measured in vitrodoes, however, not reflect the sequence-activity relationship indicated by various in vivo assays (4Coleman D.T. Fitzpatrick A. Bilezikian J.P. Bilezikian J.P. Levine M.A. Marcus R. The Parathyroids. Raven Press, New York1994: 239-258Google Scholar). hPTH-(2–34) is nearly inactive in an in vitro bioassay of cAMP stimulation, butin vivo the calcium level in blood is regulated with identical efficiency by hPTH-(2–34) and hPTH-(1–34) (Ref. 4Coleman D.T. Fitzpatrick A. Bilezikian J.P. Bilezikian J.P. Levine M.A. Marcus R. The Parathyroids. Raven Press, New York1994: 239-258Google Scholar and references therein). This indicates that hPTH utilizes other second messengers in addition to cAMP for signal transduction and possibly additional receptors in vivo (9Jouishomme H. Whitfield J.F. Chakravarthy B. Durkin J.P. Gagnon L. Isaacs R.J. MacLean S. Neugebauer W. Willick G. Rixon R.H. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, hPTH is stimulating cell proliferation in skeletal derived cell cultures (10Sömjen D. Bindermann I. Schlüter K.-D. Wingender E. Mayer H. Kaye A.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,11Sömjen D. Schlüter K.-D. Wingender E. Mayer H. Kaye A.M. Biochem.

Chem. 1989; 264: 11087-11092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Different sequence regions of the peptide are responsible for these functions; for stimulation of DNA synthesis, amino acids Asp-30 to Phe-34 are postulated as an indispensable region, but flanking residues seem to be required in addition for this function (12Schlüter K.-D. Hellstern H. Wigender E. Mayer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11087-11092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). hPTH stimulates an increase of bone formation and axial bone mass after periodic administration of the hormone (13Reeve J. Meunier P.J. Parsons J.A. Bernat M. Bijovoet O.L.M. Coupron P. Edouard C. Klenerman L. Neer R.M. Renier J.C. Slovik D. Vismans F.J. Potts J.T. Br. Med. J. 1980; 280: 1340-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Thus, hPTH is useful in the treatment of patients with hypoparathyroidism and, moreover, in the treatment of osteoporotic patients. Therefore, it would be highly desirable to construct a stable mimetic of this peptide hormone. Thus, recent studies focused on the determination of the three-dimensional structure of NH2-terminal peptides in solution by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In particular, hPTH-(1–34) is an intensely studied hormone fragment as it contains all functional domains (14Klaus W. Dieckmann T. Wray V. Schomburg D. Wingender E. Mayer H.

Raven Press, New York1994: 139-156Google Scholar). From most experiments it was concluded that hPTH-(1–34) does not form secondary structure elements in the absence of TFE (14Klaus W. Dieckmann T.

Kemp B.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7126-7132Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and for hPTH-(1–37), residues 5–10 and 17–28 (20Marx U.C. Austermann S. Bayer P. Adermann K. Ejchart A.

In TFE-containing solution hPTH-(1–34) displays helical regions from Ser-3 to Gly-12 and from Ser-17 to Lys-26 (16Strickland L.A. Bozzato R.P. Kronis K.A.

Since hPTH is of considerable medical importance, drugs mimicking this structure could be useful as therapeutics. In a first step in this direction, we determine here the structures of the NH2-terminally truncated fragments hPTH-(2–37), hPTH-(3–37), and hPTH-(4–37) in comparison with the biologically active fragment hPTH-(1–37) (20Marx U.C.

Synthesis of hPTH fragments was carried out using a PerSeptive 9050 automated peptide synthesizer on preloaded Fmoc-l-Leu-PEG-PS or Fmoc-l-Leu-TentaGelS PHB resin (loading 0.2 mmol/g, PerSeptive, Wiesbaden, Rapp Polymere, Tübingen, Germany) (20Marx U.C.

Acylations with a 4-fold excess of Fmoc amino acids in N,N-dimethylformamide were performed in the presence of 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate/N,N-diisopropylethylamine/1-hydroxybenzotriazole for 30 min. The following protective groups were used: Ser-(tert-butyl), Glu-(O-tert-butyl), Gln-(triphenylmethyl), His-(triphenylmethyl), Asn-(triphenylmethyl), Lys-(tert-butyloxycarbonyl), Arg-(2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl), and Trp-(tert-butyloxycarbonyl). Fmoc groups were cleaved in 10 min with 20% piperidine inN,N-dimethylformamide. The peptides were deprotected and cleaved from the resin with trifluoroacetic acid/ethanedithiol/water, 94:3:3, for 120 min. After filtration and precipitation of the crude peptide by addition of coldtert-butyl methyl ether, the peptide was lyophilized from 10% acetic acid and purified by preparative reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography (Vydac C18, 300A, 10 mm, 25 × 250 mm, flow rate 10 ml/min; buffer A, 0.6% trifluoroacetic acid in water; buffer B, 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile/water, 4:1, detection at 230 nm). Pure fractions were pooled, and the final product was checked by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography (Vydac C18) and capillary zone electrophoresis (Biofocus 3000, Bio-Rad, München, Germany). Electrospray mass spectrometry (Sciex API III, Perkin-Elmer, Langen, Germany), gas phase sequencing (473A Protein Sequencer, Applied Biosystems/Perkin-Elmer, Weiterstadt, Germany), and amino acid analysis (Aminoquant 1090L, Hewlett Packard, Waldbronn) showed correct mass, amino acid sequence, and composition. In vitro biological activity of the synthetic hPTH-(1–37), hPTH-(2–37), hPTH-(3–37), and hPTH-(4–37) fragments was tested by observation of the stimulation of the cAMP generation in osteogenic cells (rat osteosarcoma cells) compared with synthetic hPTH-(1–34) fragment. ROS 17/2.8 cells were grown in 25-cm2 plastic flasks at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of air/CO2 in Ham's F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 50 mg of streptomycin/ml, and 50 units of penicillin/ml. The medium was changed on alternate days. The cells reached confluence within 3–4 days and were plated into 24-well dishes for experiments. Assays were performed on confluent cultures 1–2 days after change in medium. cAMP measurements were as follows. The cells were preincubated with 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine for 15 min. The cells were then incubated for an additional 5 min in the presence of the agonists (hPTH-(1–34), hPTH-(1–37), hPTH-(2–37), hPTH-(3–37), and hPTH-(4–37)). Incubation with forskolin was used as positive control. Supernatant was aspirated, and cAMP was extracted after addition of 70% chilled ethanol, evaporation, and redilution of the cells in cAMP buffer. The samples were kept at −20 °C until cAMP levels were determined by a specific radioimmunoassay (29Abou-Samra A.B. Harwood J.P. Manganiello V.C. Catt K.J. Aguilera G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo biological activity of these hPTH fragments was tested using Parsons' Chicken Assay (30Parsons J.A. Reit B. Robinson C.J. Endocrinology. 1973; 92: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) which is indicative of the Ca2+ level homeostasis in blood. 6.25 μg of hPTH fragment together with 20 μmol of CaCl2 was injected intravenously into 10–14-day-old male chickens. After 60 min the chickens were anesthetized and then decapitated, and the blood was collected. The serum was diluted in a 1:50 ratio with 1% lanthanum nitrate solution. Atomic absorption spectroscopy was used for determination of serum calcium concentration. A hPTH-(1–34) sample served as a standard. Pure solvent without PTH was used as control. CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C in 0.1-mm cells from 250 to 190 nm at 20 nm/min on a Jasco J 600A CD spectropolarimeter. Peptide concentrations ranged from 270 to 310 μm in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, with 270 mm sodium chloride in 30 μl volume. The reference sample contained buffer without peptide. Eight scans were accumulated from samples and reference, respectively. Two-dimensional NMR spectra were obtained on a commercial Bruker AMX600 spectrometer at 298 K with standard methods (31Ernst R.R. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1992; 104: 817-852Crossref Google Scholar, 32Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). For hPTH-(4–37) an additional set of spectra was measured at 288 K to resolve frequency degeneracy. The measurements were carried out in 50 mm phosphate buffer with 270 mm sodium chloride. Peptide concentrations were 1.6 mm, pH 6.0 (hPTH-(2–37)), 2.1 mm, pH 6.0 (hPTH-(3–37)), and 1.9 mm, pH 5.8 (hPTH-(4–37)). The H2O resonance was presaturated by continuous coherent irradiation at the H2O resonance frequency prior to the reading pulse. The sweep widths in ω1 and ω2 were 7042.3 Hz. Quadrature detection was used in both dimensions with the time proportional phase incrementation technique in ω1. 4 K data points were collected in ω2and 512 data points in ω1. Zero filling to 1 K data points was used in ω1. All two-dimensional NMR spectra were multiplied with a squared sine bell function phase shifted by π/4, π/3, and π/2, respectively, for the NOESY spectra, by π/6 or π/4 for the Clean-TOCSY spectra, and π/8 or π/4 for the double quantum filtered COSY spectra. Base-line and phase correction of the 6th order was used. Data were evaluated on X-Window work stations with the NDee program package (Software Symbiose GmbH, Bayreuth, Germany). Data from the following 600 MHz spectra were employed for the sequence-specific assignment of spin systems and the evaluation of the NOESY distance constraints for the different PTH fragments: double quantum filtered COSY spectra, Clean-TOCSY spectra with mixing times of 80 ms, and NOESY spectra with mixing times of 200 ms. For the structure calculations only NOEs visible in the NOESY spectra at 298 K were taken into account. Distance geometry and molecular dynamics (MD) calculations were performed with the XPLOR 3.1 program package (33Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1. Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Yale University, New Haven1993Google Scholar) on an HP735 computer. The number of nontrivial interresidual NOESY cross-peaks used for structure calculation was 171 for hPTH-(2–37), 210 for hPTH-(3–37), and 159 hPTH-(4–37) (Table I). These cross-peaks were divided into three groups according to their following relative intensities: strong, 0.2 to 0.3 nm, medium, 0.2 to 0.4 nm, and weak, 0.2 to 0.5 nm. 0.05 nm was added to the upper distance limit for distances involving unresolved methyl or methylene proton resonances (pseudoatom approach).Table IEnergy contributions to the structures and deviations from standard geometry NOE and X-PLOR statisticshPTH(1–37) 1831-aTotal NOE number.hPTH(2–37) 1711-aTotal NOE number.hPTH(3–37) 2101-aTotal NOE number.hPTH(4–37) 1591-aTotal NOE number.‖i − j‖ = 1106101126100‖i − j‖ = 266 105‖i −j‖ = 3 43 43 53 38‖i− j‖ = 4 18 11 17 10‖i − j‖ = 52401‖i −j‖ > 55645Average energies (kJ/mol)Etotal−1579.36 −522.05−1083.16−1401.76Ebonds268.77300.77 268.54 259.53Eangles535.08715.08 584.73 481.28Eimpr109.99148.24 101.9175.26EVDW−2411.21−2280.64−2130.27−2123.47ENOE553.99 1273.86 772.71 558.95Deviations from standard geometryBonds0.0010 nm0.0011 nm0.0010 nm0.0010 nmAngles0.8452 deg0.9956 deg0.9120 deg0.8342 degImpr0.6973 deg0.8432 deg0.7006 deg0.6140 degNOEs0.0118 nm0.0119 nm0.0134 nm0.0130 nmNOE violations > 0.05 nm≤5 (φ = 1.7)≤8 (φ = 5.0)≤5 (φ = 2.3)≤6 (φ = 3.1)Whole peptide1-bRMSD among backbone structures (nm).0.5260.4910.4530.479Met-18–Leu-281-bRMSD among backbone structures (nm).0.0520.0560.0600.074His-14–Leu-281-bRMSD among backbone structures (nm).0.0690.0860.0840.0961-a Total NOE number.1-b RMSD among backbone structures (nm).

X-PLOR, Version 3.1. Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Yale University, New Haven1993Google Scholar)). For the refinement the dielectric constant was changed to ε = 4. Structure parameters were extracted from the standard parallhdg.pro and topallhdg.pro files (34Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14017) Google Scholar). For each fragment 30 structures were calculated. Ten structures for every fragment were selected on the criteria of smallest number of NOE violations over 0.05 nm and lowest overall energy. The final structures were analyzed with respect to stable idealized elements of regular secondary structure using the DSSP (definition of secondary structure of proteins) program package (35Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12414) Google Scholar). To elucidate the stability of the structures, we calculated the local root mean square deviations with a five-amino acid window (36Wagner G. Braun W. Havel T.F. Schaumann T. Go N. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 611-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). For visualization of structure data the SYBYL 6.0 (TRIPOS Association), the RASMOL V 2.6 (37Sayle R. RASMOL, Version 2.6, Molecular Visualisation Program. Glaxo Wellcome Research and Development, Stevenage, Hertfordshire, UK1995Google Scholar), and the MOLSCRIPT program packages (38Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 976-980Crossref Google Scholar) were used. The biological activities of hPTH-(1–37), hPTH-(2–37), and hPTH-(1–34) are virtually identical in the in vivo activity test of calcium homeostasis in blood using Parsons' Chicken Assay (30Parsons J.A. Reit B. Robinson C.J. Endocrinology. 1973; 92: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Fragment hPTH-(3–37) shows less than 10% of this activity, and hPTH-(4–37) is inactive (Fig. 1 a). In the in vitro activity test measuring only the cAMP production in cultured rat osteosarcoma cells, hPTH-(2–37) is much less active than hPTH-(1–37). hPTH-(3–37) and hPTH-(4–37) do not stimulate the adenylate cyclase (Fig. 1 b). It is generally accepted that PTH initiates multiple intracellular signals, for example cAMP formation, phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, and release of intracellular calcium by activating G protein-linked receptors in bone and kidney (4Coleman D.T. Fitzpatrick A. Bilezikian J.P. Bilezikian J.P. Levine M.A. Marcus R. The Parathyroids. Raven Press, New York1994: 239-258Google Scholar). A single receptor was shown to stimulate intracellular accumulation of both cAMP and inositol triphosphates (39Abou-Samra A.B. Jüppner H. Force T. Freeman M.W. Kong X.-F. Schipane E. Urena P. Richards J. Bonventre J.V. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2732-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). PTH has the concentration-dependent ability to stimulate two separate signal pathways (9Jouishomme H. Whitfield J.F. Chakravarthy B. Durkin J.P. Gagnon L. Isaacs R.J. MacLean S. Neugebauer W. Willick G. Rixon R.H. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and different sequential regions of the hormone may be responsible for initiation of the adenylate cyclase and the phospholipase C activating pathway. The existence of these multiple pathways is possibly reflected by the fact that hPTH-(2–37) is virtually inactive in the adenylate cyclase assay but can induce substantial hypercalcemia in the in vivomodel (Fig. 1, a and b). To compare the overall content of helical structure of the different peptides, far UV CD spectroscopy was used (Fig. 2) with peptide concentrations ranging from 270 to 310 μm. The overall shape of the spectra of the different peptides indicates the presence of both α-helical and random coil structural elements (40Greenfield N. Fasman G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3331) Google Scholar, 41Schmid F.-X. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1989: 251-285Google Scholar). With the stepwise truncation of the NH2-terminal amino acids the ellipticity at 222 nm changes to less negative values. The evaluation of the helix content of the different peptides by standard methods (42Morrisett J.D. David J.S.K. Pownall H.J. Gotto A.M. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1290-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) shows the following approximate fractional helix contents: hPTH-(1–37), 29%; hPTH-(2–37), 24%; hPTH-(3–37), 23%; and hPTH-(4–37), 22%. After truncation of the first two amino acids resulting in hPTH-(3–37), the wavelength corresponding to zero ellipticity and the minimum between 200 and 210 nm are shifted to lower wavelength. For hPTH-(1–37) and hPTH-(2–37) the ellipticity vanishes at 197 nm, and for hPTH-(3–37) and hPTH-(4–37) the ellipticity vanishes at 194 nm. The CD spectrum shows a minimum at 205 nm for hPTH-(1–37) and hPTH-(2–37), whereas the minimum for hPTH-(3–37) and hPTH-(4–37) is at 203 nm, indicating a structural transition between hPTH-(2–37) and hPTH-(3–37). These changes in the shape of the spectra may be interpreted as relative increase of random coil structure upon truncation of the first two amino acids (40Greenfield N. Fasman G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3331) Google Scholar, 41Schmid F.-X. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1989: 251-285Google Scholar, 43Neugebauer W. Barbier J.-R. Sung W.L. Whitfield J.F. Willick G.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8835-8842Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To allow an initial mutual comparison of the truncated fragments and hPTH-(1–37), we used the chemical shift data available from our experiments to perform a secondary structure estimation based on the chemical shift index strategy (44Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar, 45Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). The procedure depends on a direct correlation between the chemical shifts of C-α proton resonances of consecutive amino acids and the local secondary structure: an upfield shift of the C-α proton resonances relative to the corresponding “random coil” values indicates local α-helical structure (negative value in Fig. 3), and a downfield shift of C-α proton resonances compared with the corresponding random coil values indicates a local β-sheet structure (positive value in Fig. 3). Only deviations from the random coil values by more than 0.1 ppm are taken into account for secondary structure estimation. For hPTH-(1–37) and hPTH-(2–37), the chemical shifts of C-α proton resonances suggest two helical regions extending from Ser-17 to at least Gln-29 and around Glu-4 to His-9. In contrast, no indication of an NH2-terminal helix is found for hPTH-(3–37) and hPTH-(4–37), although the helical region in the COOH-terminal part can clearly be derived (Fig. 3). No other elements of regular secondary structure were evidenced by this procedure. From the difference values of the observed C-α proton chemical shifts relative to the random coil values (45Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar), one can estimate the stability of structural elements, as there is not only a correlation between the existence of secondary structure elements and chemical shifts of C-α proton resonances but also a correlation between the inherent main chain flexibility of these structure elements and the chemical shift data (46Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 311-333Crossref Pub"
https://openalex.org/W2331426494,"The conventional protein isoform of the APC tumor suppressor is 310 kD and is encoded by exons 1 - 15 of the APC gene. Other RNAs are expressed from the APC gene and include one form that contains an exon upstream of exon 1, designated BS, but this transcript does not include exon 1. This transcript recently has been shown to be enriched in non-dividing, terminally-differentiated cells (Santoro and Groden, 1997). To determine if the BS-containing transcript encoded an alternate APC protein isoform, we generated and affinity-purified a polyclonal antibody directed to protein sequence predicted by exon BS. The BS antibody labeled a band of approximately 300 kD on immunoblots of cerebral and cerebellar tissue from adult human, baboon, rat and mouse. These same tissue lysates also contained prominent BS-reactive proteins of 290 kD, 200 kD and 150 kD. Lysates from mitotically active cells did not contain these APC isoforms. To verify that BS-reactive proteins were APC isoforms, BS-immunoprecipitates were blotted and labeled with commercially available APC antibodies. All four high molecular weight BS-antibody-precipitated proteins were recognized by antibodies directed against epitopes encoded by APC exons 2 and 15. BS isoforms were not, however, labeled with antibodies to an epitope encoded by APC exon 1, consistent with the prediction that BS - APC isoforms lack the domain encoded by these sequences. Like conventional APC, at least one of the four BS-APC protein isoforms also interacts with beta-catenin. BS-APC isoforms that lack exon 1-encoded sequences are incapable of dimerization with the conventional form of APC, yet retain the ability to bind beta-catenin. Such isoforms are likely to be functionally distinct from the conventional APC protein."
https://openalex.org/W2314137923,"Protein kinase C-epsilon (PKC-epsilon) has been shown to increase growth and cause malignant transformation when overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells, whereas PKC-delta reduced fibroblast growth. Two reciprocal chimeric proteins (PKC-epsilondelta and PKC-deltaepsilon were constructed by exchanging the regulatory and catalytic domains of PKC-delta and -epsilon and were stably overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells. Fibroblasts that overexpressed either chimera showed maximum cell density and morphology that were intermediate between cells overexpressing PKC-delta and those that overexpressed PKC-epsilon. Moreover, all lines that expressed chimeras were capable of anchorage-independent growth in the presence of TPA, which indicated that both the regulatory and catalytic domains of PKC-epsilon could independently induce NIH3T3 transformation, although the combination of both domains, as found in PKC-epsilon, was the most active form. In contrast, the translocation pattern and ability to induce tumors in nude mice was attributable to the catalytic domains exclusively. In particular, cells that expressed PKC-deltaepsilon retained PKC-epsilon's full potency of tumorgenicity when injected into nude mice. In sum, our findings not only reinforce the concept that only certain PKC isozymes contribute to carcinogenesis but also show that different domains of PKCs mediate the physiologically distinguishable events of transformation and tumorgenesis."
