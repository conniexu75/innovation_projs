However, Ettlinger5 reported that significantly more monkeys preferred to use the left hand than the right on their first discrimination task (irrespective of the task being visual or tactile). Seventeen of the 42 monkeys showed a strong preference for the left hand, six for the right and 19 animals showed weak or ambiguous preferences. Brookshire and Warren6, as a result of their more comprehensive investigation of lateral preferences under a variety of test conditions, wrote: “Four monkeys were judged to have had a predominantly right-hand preference, nine were judged left-handed, and six were considered either ambidextrous or without definite preference”. It is not yet known what factors are associated with the preferential use of a particular hand (left or right) on a given task6. If a significant asymmetry in the incidence of lateral preferences in favour of the left (or right) hand can be established it will be important to seek for neural or other correlates in a species which is generally considered to lack cerebral dominance."

https://openalex.org/W1996276976,"WARBURG et al.1 observed that tumour tissues almost always had a higher rate of aerobic glycolysis than normal cells. Warburg attributed this to irreversible damage to the respiratory pathways. The theory was a source of contention from the beginning. It was abandoned by most workers when it was found that glycolysis very rapidly increased (in a few days) when tissues were explanted and maintained as tissue cultures2–4. Since then many factors, such as pH and oxygen tension, have been shown to influence both glycolysis and respiration in cultured cells5–7 ; the increase of glycolysis on explantation can easily be explained by these findings. Reduced respiration and increased glycolysis in tumours in vivo can be explained similarly, knowing that most tumours have an inadequate blood supply. For this reason, and because wide differences in behaviour are found among different cell lines8, the significance of Warburg's findings has been questioned. Nevertheless, there is good evidence9,10 that there is a fundamental difference in glycolysis of normal and tumour cells."

https://openalex.org/W2063208538,"STIMULATED by reports of the antiviral activity of some thiosemicarbazones1, and particularly of the activity against neurovaccinia of isatin β-thiosemicarbazone2,3, we sought to enhance the activity of these compounds by structural modification. Thus we synthesized N-ethylisatin β-thiosemicarbazone independently of, but somewhat later than, Bauer and Sadler4. At the same time, we had been making a systematic study of the chemistry and chemotherapeutic properties of derivatives of the new monocyclic ring system, 1,2-thiazole (isothiazole), and we observed that 3-methylisothiazole-5-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (M and B 7453) also protected mice infected intracerebrally with neurovaccinia. The relatively high toxicity of this compound (acute LD50 = 0.7 mg/g orally in mice) led us to examine related thiosemicarbazones, one of which, 4-bromo-3-methylisothiazole-5-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (M and B 7714), is considerably less toxic (acute LD50 = 4.3 mg/g orally in mice)."

At present 16 different human transferrin variants have been described. Fourteen of these are summarized by Parker and Bearn2. The fifteenth, BLae, was observed in a single pedigree in New Guinea3, and the sixteenth, DWigan, nas been reported recently in an English family4."

https://openalex.org/W1980996823,"ONE of the diseases in which there may be a defect of tryptophane metabolism is scleroderma. This belief is based on such experimental evidence as the increased excretion of the intermediate metabolites of tryptophane after oral administration of large doses of trytophane1. One of these metabolites, kynurenine, has been identified in water extracts of rat hair2. It seemed of interest, therefore, to determine whether or not kynurenine could be found in the hair of patients with scleroderma. Kynurenine has not been reported in previous analyses of normal human hair3,4."
