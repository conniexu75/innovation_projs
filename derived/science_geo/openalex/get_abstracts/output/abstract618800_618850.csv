https://openalex.org/W2889664156,"Despite rapid advances in sequencing technologies, accurately calling genetic variants present in an individual genome from billions of short, errorful sequence reads remains challenging. Here we show that a deep convolutional neural network can call genetic variation in aligned next-generation sequencing read data by learning statistical relationships between images of read pileups around putative variant and true genotype calls. The approach, called DeepVariant, outperforms existing state-of-the-art tools. The learned model generalizes across genome builds and mammalian species, allowing nonhuman sequencing projects to benefit from the wealth of human ground-truth data. We further show that DeepVariant can learn to call variants in a variety of sequencing technologies and experimental designs, including deep whole genomes from 10X Genomics and Ion Ampliseq exomes, highlighting the benefits of using more automated and generalizable techniques for variant calling."
https://openalex.org/W2891027664,"Complete population collapse of malaria vector Anopheles gambiae in cages is achieved using a gene drive that targets doublesex. In the human malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, the gene doublesex (Agdsx) encodes two alternatively spliced transcripts, dsx-female (AgdsxF) and dsx-male (AgdsxM), that control differentiation of the two sexes. The female transcript, unlike the male, contains an exon (exon 5) whose sequence is highly conserved in all Anopheles mosquitoes so far analyzed. We found that CRISPR–Cas9-targeted disruption of the intron 4–exon 5 boundary aimed at blocking the formation of functional AgdsxF did not affect male development or fertility, whereas females homozygous for the disrupted allele showed an intersex phenotype and complete sterility. A CRISPR–Cas9 gene drive construct targeting this same sequence spread rapidly in caged mosquitoes, reaching 100% prevalence within 7–11 generations while progressively reducing egg production to the point of total population collapse. Owing to functional constraint of the target sequence, no selection of alleles resistant to the gene drive occurred in these laboratory experiments. Cas9-resistant variants arose in each generation at the target site but did not block the spread of the drive."

Hybrid strategies are able to provide highly sensitive and natural percepts and should be preferred. Grasping is a sophisticated activity that is pivotal for body-environment interaction. Therefore, re-establishing the sensory flow of information between hand prostheses and the brain is of paramount importance. Lack of sensory feedback and inadequate embodiment are among the reasons for rejection of available commercial prosthesis (Wijk and Carlsson, 2015Wijk U. Carlsson I.

Neuroeng. Rehabil. 2017; 14: 121Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), eliciting somatotopic sensations (e.g., referred to phantom hand) with feelings that are sometimes similar to the natural ones (e.g., pressure or vibration). However, naturalness can be characterized by different “grades” and the “level” of naturalness has been often reported by the subjects as quite limited (e.g., using the stimulation is quite unpleasant; see, for example, Tan et al., 2014Tan D.W. Schiefer M.A. Keith M.W. Anderson J.R. Tyler J. Tyler D.J. A neural interface provides long-term stable natural touch perception.Sci. Transl. Med. 2014; 6: 257ra138Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Ideally, neural stimulation should be able to provide sensory feedback that is functionally effective and highly natural, as the naturalness of the feedback plays a pivotal role in prostheses acceptance (Graczyk et al., 2016Graczyk E.L. Schiefer M.A. Saal H.P. Delhaye B.P. Bensmaia S.J. Tyler D.J. The neural basis of perceived intensity in natural and artificial touch.Sci. Transl.

Biomimetic approaches to bionic touch through a peripheral nerve interface.Neuropsychologia. 2015; 79: 344-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A possible way to address this issue might be to define and use complex stimulation patterns (Graczyk et al., 2016Graczyk E.L. Schiefer M.A. Saal H.P. Delhaye B.P. Bensmaia S.J. Tyler D.J.

Neural interfaces for somatosensory feedback: bringing life to a prosthesis.Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2015; 28: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that resemble the natural encoding strategies implemented by the nervous system (Chortos et al., 2016Chortos A. Liu J. Bao Z. Pursuing prosthetic electronic skin.Nat. Mater. 2016; 15: 937-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar, Johansson and Flanagan, 2009Johansson R.S. Flanagan J.R. Coding and use of tactile signals from the fingertips in object manipulation tasks.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). Here, to understand how to develop a more natural and informative encoding strategy for the control of the bidirectional prosthesis, we tested four different stimulation approaches (STAR Methods; Figures 1A and S1) on a trans-radial amputee implanted with TIME electrodes (Boretius et al., 2010Boretius T. Badia J. Pascual-Font A. Schuettler M. Navarro X. Yoshida K. Stieglitz T. A transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrode (TIME) to interface with the peripheral nerve.Biosens. Bioelectron. 2010; 26: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) (Figures 1A and S1). The frequency neuromodulation (FNM) approach was based on the use of a recent biomimetic model (TouchSim) able to reproduce nerve activation patterns of the multifaceted mechanics of the skin and mechano-transduction (Saal and Bensmaia, 2015Saal H.P. Bensmaia S.J. Biomimetic approaches to bionic touch through a peripheral nerve interface.Neuropsychologia. 2015; 79: 344-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, Saal et al., 2017Saal H.P. Delhaye B.P. Rayhaun B.C. Bensmaia S.J. Simulating tactile signals from the whole hand with millisecond precision.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114: E5693-E5702Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The biomimetic model was used to simulate the response of a peripheral nerve given a pattern of sensory stimuli, and then we used this information for stimulating the nerve to restore sensory feedback. We first compared this encoding strategy with a linear amplitude neuromodulation (ANM) paradigm (Raspopovic et al., 2014Raspopovic S. Capogrosso M. Petrini F.M. Bonizzato M. Rigosa J. Di Pino G. Carpaneto J. Controzzi M. Boretius T. Fernandez E. et al.Restoring natural sensory feedback in real-time bidirectional hand prostheses.Sci. Transl. Med. 2014; 6: 222ra19Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), and then with two hybrid neuromodulations (HNMs). The first one (HNM-1) modulates pulse frequency according to FNM and pulse amplitude according to ANM. The second one (HNM-2) modulates pulse frequency according to FNM and pulse amplitude according to the indentation-dependent recruitment of the fibers as simulated by TouchSim. These encoding strategies were compared both in terms of the naturalness of the evoked sensations and in their ability to lead the subjects to discriminate sensory stimuli. Then, we applied these strategies to convert the output of the artificial sensors of a prosthetic hand into stimulation patterns of the peripheral nerve. We assessed both functional performance during a real-life grasping task (Clemente et al., 2016Clemente F. D’Alonzo M. Controzzi M. Edin B.B. Cipriani C. Non-invasive, temporally discrete feedback of object contact and release improves grasp control of closed-loop myoelectric transradial prostheses.IEEE Trans. Neural Syst. Rehabil. Eng. 2016; 24: 1314-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and the prosthesis embodiment achieved by using the different sensory encoding strategies. Our findings demonstrate that a hybrid neuromodulation approach based on biomimetic frequency modulation and amplitude modulation represents an effective encoding strategy improving several critical aspects of existing approaches. In fact, this hybrid strategy may provide sensory information that can be felt as more natural (also increasing embodiment), is highly sensitive (allowing recognition of smaller indentations), and can be integrated by the user into the sensorimotor control of a hand prosthesis with tactile sensors. We first performed in two trans-radial amputees a preliminary characterization of the sensations, evoked by linear modulation of amplitude and frequency of the injected pulses in multiple TIME electrode active sites (Figure 1B). This characterization showed that the two approaches had similar low values on a naturalness scale (Lenz et al., 1993Lenz F.A. Seike M. Richardson R.T. Lin Y.C. Baker F.H. Khoja I. Jaeger C.J. Gracely R.H. Thermal and pain sensations evoked by microstimulation in the area of human ventrocaudal nucleus.J. Neurophysiol. 1993; 70: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) (Kruskal-Wallis test with Tukey-Kramer post hoc correction [KWTK], p > 0.2). Results did not vary across stimulation sites (Figures S2A–S2D). In subject 1, we also tested a nonlinear model of frequency modulation inspired by SA activity (Figures S3A and S3B; STAR Methods for details). This led to an increase in perceived absolute naturalness (Figure 1C; KTWK, p < 0.05) over all sites (Figure S2E). As responses elicited by stimulation on different sites were strikingly similar (Figure S2), for the sake of simplicity we chose the most selective active site, located on a fingertip and evoking a vibration sensation, to test the further encoding strategies in subject 2 (Figure S2E). Then, we compared seven different types of FNMs (SA, RA, PC, SA+RA, SA+PC, RA+PC, and SA+RA+PC) based on the output of the biomimetic model (Saal et al., 2017Saal H.P. Delhaye B.P. Rayhaun B.C. Bensmaia S.J. Simulating tactile signals from the whole hand with millisecond precision.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114: E5693-E5702Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) on subject 2 to understand how to optimally implement FNM. The model simulates the responses of the three main types of tactile fibers innervating the glabrous skin of the hand (Saal et al., 2017Saal H.P. Delhaye B.P. Rayhaun B.C. Bensmaia S.J. Simulating tactile signals from the whole hand with millisecond precision.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114: E5693-E5702Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar)—slowly adapting type I (SA), rapidly adapting fibers (RA), and vibration-sensitive Pacinian afferents (PC)—to a spatiotemporal stimulus applied to the skin. The mechanical skin indentation (12 mN) was simulated by the model and was encoded by the sole SA, RA, or PC responses or by their combinations. We compared the encoding strategies pairwise: we presented the reference stimulus encoded with one of the seven different types of FNMs, and then with the second one with a 5 s interval and asked the subject which stimulation felt more natural (closer to the sensation felt with the fingertip of the intact limb). We assigned +1 to the winning strategy and −1 to the other. Comparing all the encoding modalities, the SA+RA+PC population elicited the most “natural” perceived sensations with a score of 4 ± 0.7 (KW test, p < 0.05; Figure 1D). Combining two different classes of fiber population responses (RA+SA, SA+PC, and RA+PC), the sensation was perceived as more natural than using only one class to convey the indentation information (SA, −4 ± 1.02; RA, −1.5 ± 0.75; PC, −1.5 ± 1.03; SA+RA, −1.4 ± 0.76; SA+PC, 0.5 ± 0.64; RA+PC, 1.5 ± 0.42). In a second paradigm, the same mechanical skin indentation (12 mN) was simulated from the biomimetic model and was encoded by using ANM, FNM, HNM-1, or HNM-2, considering simultaneously SA, RA, and PC fibers (Figures S1 and S4A). The encoding strategies were shown to the subject in pairs and were compared in terms of relative naturalness using the aforementioned protocol. The strategies characterized by the biomimetic frequency modulation (FNM, 1 ± 1.48; HNM-1, 4 ± 2.09; HNM-2, 3.8 ± 1.75) elicited a sensation perceived as more natural than the ANM (−3 ± 1.32) (KWTK, p < 0.05; Figure 1E). The just-noticeable difference (JND) and the point of subjective equality (PSE) (STAR Methods) were calculated for each encoding strategy to assess the tactile ability to discriminate between different stimulation intensities. Systematic changes in modeled indentation force (mN) yielded systematic changes in the evoked percepts, as proven by smooth psychometric functions fitting the data (Figures 2A–2D; likelihood ratio test, p < 0.05; Table S2). Considering single-feature encodings, the tactile JND for ANM was lower than using FNM (12.02 mN versus 26.90 mN, respectively), indicating that the modulation of stimuli amplitude gave higher tactile sensitivity (55.31% decrease of the JND) than modulating frequency. The JNDs in the hybrid encodings were 16.06 mN for HNM-1 and 18.45 mN HNM-2. The JNDs were higher than in ANM, but lower than FNM, indicating that the amplitude modulation of the stimulation trains was crucial for high tactile sensitivity. JNDs were comparable with those found on healthy subjects (King et al., 2010King H.H. Donlin R. Hannaford B. Perceptual thresholds for single vs. multi-finger haptic interaction.In 2010 IEEE Haptics Symposium. 2010; : 95-99Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The Weber fractions, which is the JND divided by the reference value (59 mN), obtained for all the encodings were 0.20 (ANM), 0.45 (FNM), 0.27 (HNM-1), and 0.31 (HNM-2). The PSEs differed by less than 12 mN from the standard (59 mN) in the single-feature and hybrid encodings, reflecting a high discrimination precision. In the encodings in which the stimulation amplitude was modulated (ANM, HNM-1, and HNM-2), there was a tendency to overestimate the stimulus (PSEANM, PSEHNM-1, PSEHNM-2 > 59 mN). The opposite behavior was observed in FNM encoding (PSEFNM < 59 mN). To assess the discrimination abilities of the subject using the sensory feedback, two discrimination tasks were conducted. First, the subject was asked to distinguish three intensities of skin indentation (low, 11 mN; medium, 59 mN; high, 107 mN) simulated with the biomimetic model and presented randomly. The subject was able to classify the indentation levels above chance (>70% static classification performance [SCP]) with all strategies, indicating some ability to exploit the information encoded in the sensory feedback (Figures 2E and S3C). Next, the dynamic loading discrimination ability was evaluated. Three different time-varying indentations (dynamic loadings) were presented (increasing, static, and releasing) randomly to the subject. All the encodings allowed the subject to recognize the dynamic indentation trends with high performance (>80% dynamic classification performance [DCP]; Figure S3D), indicating the capability to exploit the encodings in a real-time bidirectional system. In both classification tasks, the functional performance was higher whenever the JND was lower (JNDFNM<JNDHNM-2<JNDHNM-1<JNDANM → DCPFNM<DCPHNM-2<DCPHNM-1<DCPANM and SCPFNM<SCPHNM-2<SCPHNM-1<SCPANM; Figure 3F). Moreover, in the static loading classification task, performances using ANM and HNM-1 were statistically higher than FNM (SCPANM = 91.6%, SCPHNM-1 = 85.7%, and SCPFNM = 70%; Figure 2E; Fisher exact test, p < 0.05). The efficacy of different encoding strategies was evaluated during the virtual eggs test (VET) (Clemente et al., 2016Clemente F. D’Alonzo M. Controzzi M. Edin B.B. Cipriani C. Non-invasive, temporally discrete feedback of object contact and release improves grasp control of closed-loop myoelectric transradial prostheses.IEEE Trans. Neural Syst. Rehabil. Eng. 2016; 24: 1314-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The VET measures the individual’s ability to use sensory feedback when the prosthesis is used to lift and transport in a precision grip condition. The subject was asked to transfer as many fragile objects as possible, without breaking them, from one side of an 18 cm tall wall to the other, in 120 s (Figure 3A). The functional performance of the different strategies was compared in terms of manual accuracy, measured as the percentage of unbroken and passed objects with respect to the total number of objects (Clemente et al., 2016Clemente F. D’Alonzo M. Controzzi M. Edin B.B. Cipriani C. Non-invasive, temporally discrete feedback of object contact and release improves grasp control of closed-loop myoelectric transradial prostheses.IEEE Trans. Neural Syst. Rehabil. Eng. 2016; 24: 1314-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and of gross manual dexterity, measured as the total number of transferred objects (broken and unbroken) (Mathiowetz et al., 1985Mathiowetz V. Volland G. Kashman N. Weber K. Adult norms for the Box and Block Test of manual dexterity.Am. J. Occup. Ther. 1985; 39: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). All sensory encoding strategies improved the functional performance significantly with respect to the 45% fraction of unbroken passed objects in the no feedback (NF) condition (KW test, p < 0.05), but no significant differences were observed among the different encoding strategies, all with performances close to 70% (Figure 3B, top inset). In contrast, the gross manual dexterity performance showed significant differences among different encoding strategies (KW test, p < 0.05; Figure 3B, bottom inset). Indeed, with both hybrid approaches the subject was able to pass on average 19 blocks, indicating an enhanced gross dexterity compared to single-feature strategies (12.8 and 16.4 blocks for ANM and FNM, respectively) and NF condition (11.6 blocks). The subject was also asked to answer a questionnaire about the absolute naturalness of the evoked sensation while performing the VET (0, fully unnatural sensation–10, fully natural sensation). Also, two questions regarding the subject’s perceptions related to object (Q1 and Q2) were asked (–3, totally disagree; 3, totally agree; STAR Methods). The modulation of the frequency using the biomimetic model (FNM, HNM-1, and HNM-2) was again better in eliciting natural sensations (closer to the sensation felt with the fingertip of the intact limb) than ANM and NF (scoreFNM,HNM-1,HNM-2 = 5, scoreANM = 3, and scoreNF < 1; Figure 3C). Moreover, performing the motor task without any feedback was perceived as less natural (movement not performed like the intact limb, but more artificially) by the subject (score < 1) and the score was statistically different (KW test, p < 0.05). Also, the questionnaires related to object manipulation (Q1 and Q2) underlined that the sensory feedback provided more information (Figure 3D). In this case, ANM also yielded similar scores to the biomimetic approaches in terms of perceived quality of the grasp and manipulating information, although it was unable to elicit a natural sensation during the VET (SANM< SFNM; SANM< SHNM-1; SANM< SHNM-2). Psychophysical studies observed that naturalistic and pleasant sensing parameters of tactile stimulations delivered to the intact hand are associated with a stronger embodiment (van Stralen et al., 2014van Stralen H.E. van Zandvoort M.J.E. Hoppenbrouwers S.S. Vissers L.M.G. Kappelle L.J. Dijkerman H.C. Affective touch modulates the rubber hand illusion.Cognition. 2014; 131: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We then hypothesized that direct neural stimulations leading to a higher relative naturalness of the sensation would also lead to an increased sense of artificial hand/finger ownership. To verify this hypothesis, the rubber hand questionnaire to assess the level of embodiment (Ehrsson et al., 2008Ehrsson H.H. Rosén B. Stockselius A. Ragnö C. Köhler P. Lundborg G.

Robotic touch shifts perception of embodiment to a prosthesis in targeted reinnervation amputees.Brain. 2011; 134: 747-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) while executing the VET was administered (Figure 4). The subject reported the highest embodiment in the conditions in which the sensory feedback was provided, as shown by the significantly higher scores for the three embodiment questions in all the ANM, FNM, HNM-1, and HNM-2 as compared to NF (KW test, p < 0.05; Figure 4D). The rubber hand questionnaires confirmed the enhancement of the embodiment when natural sensory encoding was used, as shown by the difference in Q3 score between ANM and FNM, HNM-1, and HNM-2 encodings (KWTK, p < 0.05). This explicit answer suggests that, during use, the prosthesis was perceived closer to biological one when more natural encodings were provided. Notably, the illusion questions were rated higher than the control statements (Figure 4E) in all stimulation encodings, thus confirming that the subject was not suggestible (Botvinick and Cohen, 1998Botvinick M. Cohen J. Rubber hands ‘feel’ touch that eyes see.Nature. 1998; 391: 756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar, Ehrsson et al., 2008Ehrsson H.H. Rosén B. Stockselius A. Ragnö C. Köhler P.

We then tested whether a natural encoding used in a closed loop would reduce the distorted perception of the phantom limb, namely, the telescoping effect (Ramachandran and Hirstein, 1998Ramachandran V.S. Hirstein W. The perception of phantom limbs. The D. O. Hebb lecture.Brain. 1998; 121: 1603-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2892082076,"Targeting autophagy in cancer cells and in the tumor microenvironment are current goals of cancer therapy. However, components of canonical autophagy play roles in other biological processes, adding complexity to this goal. One such alternative function of autophagy proteins is LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), which functions in phagosome maturation and subsequent signaling events. Here, we show that impairment of LAP in the myeloid compartment, rather than canonical autophagy, induces control of tumor growth by tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) upon phagocytosis of dying tumor cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that defects in LAP induce pro-inflammatory gene expression and trigger STING-mediated type I interferon responses in TAM. We found that the anti-tumor effects of LAP impairment require tumor-infiltrating T cells, dependent upon STING and the type I interferon response. Therefore, autophagy proteins in the myeloid cells of the tumor microenvironment contribute to immune suppression of T lymphocytes by effecting LAP."
https://openalex.org/W2890631306,"Acetate is a major nutrient that supports acetyl-coenzyme A (Ac-CoA) metabolism and thus lipogenesis and protein acetylation. However, its source is unclear. Here, we report that pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis and key node in central carbon metabolism, quantitatively generates acetate in mammals. This phenomenon becomes more pronounced in the context of nutritional excess, such as during hyperactive glucose metabolism. Conversion of pyruvate to acetate occurs through two mechanisms: (1) coupling to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and (2) neomorphic enzyme activity from keto acid dehydrogenases that enable function as pyruvate decarboxylases. Further, we demonstrate that de novo acetate production sustains Ac-CoA pools and cell proliferation in limited metabolic environments, such as during mitochondrial dysfunction or ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) deficiency. By virtue of de novo acetate production being coupled to mitochondrial metabolism, there are numerous possible regulatory mechanisms and links to pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W2889676858,"Given that genomic DNA exerts its function by being transcribed, it is critical for the maintenance of homeostasis that DNA damage, such as double-strand breaks (DSBs), within transcriptionally active regions undergoes accurate repair. However, it remains unclear how this is achieved. Here, we describe a mechanism for transcription-associated homologous recombination repair (TA-HRR) in human cells. The process is initiated by R-loops formed upon DSB induction. We identify Rad52, which is recruited to the DSB site in a DNA-RNA-hybrid-dependent manner, as playing pivotal roles in promoting XPG-mediated R-loop processing and initiating subsequent repair by HRR. Importantly, dysfunction of TA-HRR promotes DSB repair via non-homologous end joining, leading to a striking increase in genomic aberrations. Thus, our data suggest that the presence of R-loops around DSBs within transcriptionally active regions promotes accurate repair of DSBs via processing by Rad52 and XPG to protect genomic information in these critical regions from gene alterations."
https://openalex.org/W2892180666,"Comparative analyses of natural and mutated sequences have been used to probe mechanisms of gene expression, but small sample sizes may produce biased outcomes. We applied an unbiased design-of-experiments approach to disentangle factors suspected to affect translation efficiency in E. coli. We precisely designed 244,000 DNA sequences implementing 56 replicates of a full factorial design to evaluate nucleotide, secondary structure, codon and amino acid properties in combination. For each sequence, we measured reporter transcript abundance and decay, polysome profiles, protein production and growth rates. Associations between designed sequences properties and these consequent phenotypes were dominated by secondary structures and their interactions within transcripts. We confirmed that transcript structure generally limits translation initiation and demonstrated its physiological cost using an epigenetic assay. Codon composition has a sizable impact on translatability, but only in comparatively rare elongation-limited transcripts. We propose a set of design principles to improve translation efficiency that would benefit from more accurate prediction of secondary structures in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2891505771,"Accurately predicting an outcome requires that animals learn supporting and conflicting evidence from sequential experience. In mammals and invertebrates, learned fear responses can be suppressed by experiencing predictive cues without punishment, a process called memory extinction. Here, we show that extinction of aversive memories in Drosophila requires specific dopaminergic neurons, which indicate that omission of punishment is remembered as a positive experience. Functional imaging revealed co-existence of intracellular calcium traces in different places in the mushroom body output neuron network for both the original aversive memory and a new appetitive extinction memory. Light and ultrastructural anatomy are consistent with parallel competing memories being combined within mushroom body output neurons that direct avoidance. Indeed, extinction-evoked plasticity in a pair of these neurons neutralizes the potentiated odor response imposed in the network by aversive learning. Therefore, flies track the accuracy of learned expectations by accumulating and integrating memories of conflicting events."
https://openalex.org/W2890432440,"A major challenge in genetics is to identify genetic variants driving natural phenotypic variation. However, current methods of genetic mapping have limited resolution. To address this challenge, we developed a CRISPR-Cas9-based high-throughput genome editing approach that can introduce thousands of specific genetic variants in a single experiment. This enabled us to study the fitness consequences of 16,006 natural genetic variants in yeast. We identified 572 variants with significant fitness differences in glucose media; these are highly enriched in promoters, particularly in transcription factor binding sites, while only 19.2% affect amino acid sequences. Strikingly, nearby variants nearly always favor the same parent's alleles, suggesting that lineage-specific selection is often driven by multiple clustered variants. In sum, our genome editing approach reveals the genetic architecture of fitness variation at single-base resolution and could be adapted to measure the effects of genome-wide genetic variation in any screen for cell survival or cell-sortable markers."

The neuronal code for number.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17: 366-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) indicated parts of the parietal and prefrontal cortices as a core number system that processes nonsymbolic and symbolic numerical magnitude. However, the wider cortical number network also incorporates areas of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) (Menon, 2016Menon V. Memory and cognitive control circuits in mathematical cognition and learning.Prog. Brain Res. 2016; 227: 159-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), such as the hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala. The MTL comprises highly associative brain areas that are directly and reciprocally connected with the frontal number network (Goldman-Rakic et al., 1984Goldman-Rakic P.S. Selemon L.D. Schwartz M.L. Dual pathways connecting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with the hippocampal formation and parahippocampal cortex in the rhesus monkey.Neuroscience. 1984; 12: 719-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), and human MTL neurons are known for their selectivity to abstract categories (Quiroga et al., 2005Quiroga R.Q.

As a neuronal correlate of numerosity representations, electrophysiological recordings from the association cortex of monkeys showed neurons that are tuned to a specific preferred numerosity of visual and auditory items. Such number neurons have also been postulated by neural network models (Dehaene and Changeux, 1993Dehaene S. Changeux J.P. Development of elementary numerical abilities: a neuronal model.J. Cogn.

Despite the progress that has been made using functional imaging and ECoG recordings, the mechanism of how single neurons, the anatomical and functional units of the brain, encode nonsymbolic or symbolic numerical information in humans remains unknown.

Participants performed simple sequential addition and subtraction tasks using a computer display (Figure 1A). Task involvement ensured that numbers shown as operands were consciously processed. Numerical values of the operands ranged from 1 to 5. In half of the shuffled trials, the numerical values were presented nonsymbolically as the number of randomly placed dots in an array (numerosity). In the other half, Arabic numerals were shown as symbolic number representations. Both nonsymbolic and symbolic numbers were shown in standard and control displays in order to control for low-level visual features (Figure 1B; see Supplemental Information). Arithmetic symbols or words were applied for addition and subtraction instructions (Figure 1C). Average performance of all participants was close to ceiling for all tested quantities and calculations (performance range 90.3%–99.8%). We recorded from 585 single neurons in the medial temporal lobes (153 amygdala, 126 parahippocampal cortex, 107 entorhinal cortex, and 199 hippocampus) of nine human subjects performing the calculation tasks. In order to explore pure number representations, and to avoid confounds with cognitive factors later in the task, we focus on the presentation of the first operand (operand 1) and the subsequent working memory phase (delay 1); the remaining task phases are considered toward the end of the results. Random presentation of either the nonsymbolic or symbolic format from trial to trial allowed us to investigate an individual neuron’s responses to each of the formats individually, but also to both formats, in an unbiased way. When the participants calculated with numerosities (nonsymbolic format), a substantial proportion of the tested neurons (16%; p ≪ 0.001 in binomial test; pchance = 0.01; see also Supplemental Information for verification with shuffled data) showed activity that varied exclusively with the number of items during operand 1 presentation and the working memory delay 1 that followed, irrespective of the dot array layout (2-factor sliding-window ANOVA, with factors “numerical value” × “protocol”; α = 0.01; Figure S1, left). Four of such numerosity-selective neurons are shown in Figure 2, left column. Each cell is tuned to numerosity; it shows peak activity for one of the numerosities, its preferred numerosity, and a systematic decrease of activity the more the number of items deviates from the preferred value. The highest fraction of such numerosity-selective neurons in the MTL was found in the parahippocampal cortex (29%), followed by the hippocampus (18%; Figure 3, upper columns). The selective neurons’ preference covered the entire tested range of numerosities, albeit with most neurons preferring numerosity “five” (Figure 4A, left). The proportion of neurons selective to nonsymbolic number for each subject is shown in Table S1. Firing rates were generally low in the MTL, but the firing rates of numerosity-selective neurons were significantly higher compared to the non-selective neurons (p < 0.0001; Mann-Whitney U test; Figure S2, left).Figure 3Neuronal Selectivity of MTL Single UnitsShow full captionProportions of single units with significant main effects for “numerical value” (NUM: 1–5) or “protocol” (PROT: standard and control) and interactions (NUM × PROT) in a 2-factor ANOVA evaluated at α = 0.01, separately for each format and MTL region (AMY, amygdala; EC, entorhinal cortex; HIPP, hippocampus; PHC, parahippocampal cortex).

Error bars denote SEM. Average tuning curves were calculated by averaging the normalized activity for all numerosity-selective neurons that preferred a given numerosity. Neural activity formed overlapping tuning functions with progressively reduced activity as distance from the preferred quantity increased (Figure 4B, left). To compare the decay of activity from the preferred quantity across all neurons tuned to preferred numerosities 1–5, we plotted the normalized firing rates as a function of absolute numerical distance from the preferred numerosity. For example, the normalized firing rate to numerosity 2 and 4 of a cell tuned to numerosity 3 (3 therefore is absolute numerical distance 0) were plotted at absolute numerical distance 1. The pooled function for all selective neurons compared to a function from random tuning curves is shown in Figure 4C, left. On average, activity dropped off progressively with numerical distance across all preferred numerosities, an effect that is not observed for random tuning curves. This finding reflects a neuronal correlate of the well-known “numerical distance effect,” the behavioral observation that discrimination progressively enhances as numerical distance between two quantities increases (Buckley and Gillman, 1974Buckley P.B. Gillman C.B. Comparisons of digits and dot patterns.J. Exp. Psychol. 1974; 103: 1131-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, Merten and Nieder, 2009Merten K. Nieder A. Compressed scaling of abstract numerosity representations in adult humans and monkeys.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2009; 21: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A cross-validation analysis (see Supplemental Information) yielded high reproducibility of preferred numerosity for the population of numerosity-selective units (average correlation coefficient r = 0.83; p < 0.0001), indicating that the preferred numerosity of the neurons was reliable and robust. When participants calculated with Arabic numerals (symbolic format), a smaller but significant proportion of the recorded neurons (3%; p < 0.001 in binomial test; pchance = 0.01) responded selectively to numerals during operand 1 presentation and the subsequent working memory delay 1 (2-factor sliding-window ANOVA, with factors numerical value × protocol; α = 0.01; Figure S1, right). The highest fraction of such numeral-selective neurons in the MTL was again found in the parahippocampal cortex (6%), followed by the amygdala (4%; Figure 3, lower columns). Six numeral-selective neurons (1% of all neurons) were also tuned to nonsymbolic number, which was more than expected by chance (p < 0.05 in binomial test; pchance = 0.16 × 0.03 = 0.005, or 0.5%). Of these, four neurons had identical preferred numerical values for nonsymbolic and symbolic number. This correlation did not reach significance (Figure S3A), possibly due to the small sample size. Next, we investigated whether the preferred numbers of units tuned to nonsymbolic numerosity might be correlated with their (non-significant) tuning to symbolic numerals (Figure S3B) and vice versa (Figure S3C). Neither correlation reached significance, indicating that numerosity and abstract numerals are encoded by two largely distinct neuronal populations. Two neurons tuned to the same value in both nonsymbolic and symbolic formats are depicted in Figures 2C and 2D. The neuron in Figure 2C as well as the neuron in Figure 2D showed maximum responses to quantity 5 in both the nonsymbolic and symbolic format. In contrast, the two neurons shown in Figures 2A and 2B were only significantly tuned to dot numerosities, but not to numerals. Again, a cross-validation analysis confirmed the reliability of the preferred numeral determination (average correlation coefficient r = 0.57; p < 0.05). The proportion of neurons selective to symbolic number for each subject is shown in Table S1. As for nonsymbolic number, the firing rates of numeral-selective neurons were significantly higher compared to the non-selective neurons (p < 0.01; Mann-Whitney U test; Figure S2, right). Overall, the numeral-selective neurons’ preference covered the entire range of numbers 1–5 (Figure 4A, right), and their normalized activity for each preferred numeral formed overlapping tuning functions (Figure 4B, right). The decline of activity from the preferred to the nonpreferred numerals was brisk and categorical, with only a mild progressive decrease with numerical distance, hardly showing a neuronal numerical distance effect (Figure 4C, right). At absolute numerical distance 1, the normalized firing rates obtained for symbolic number (n = 16) were significantly lower compared to nonsymbolic number (n = 92; p < 0.05; t test), indicating higher selectivity for (or sharper tuning to) symbolic number. When comparing the neuronal latencies to reach number-selectivity, neurons tuned to nonsymbolic (990 ms) and symbolic number (880 ms) did not differ significantly (p = 0.23; Mann-Whitney U test). So far, our data suggest two main findings at the level of individual neurons. First, the representation of nonsymbolic number was abundant and comparable to the core number network in nonhuman primates (Nieder et al., 2002Nieder A. Freedman D.J. Miller E.K. Representation of the quantity of visual items in the primate prefrontal cortex.Science. 2002; 297: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, Nieder et al., 2006Nieder A. Diester I. Tudusciuc O. Temporal and spatial enumeration processes in the primate parietal cortex.Science. 2006; 313: 1431-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, Nieder and Miller, 2004Nieder A. Miller E.K. A parieto-frontal network for visual numerical information in the monkey.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 7457-7462Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), whereas the representation of symbolic numbers was sparse in the MTL. Second, neurons responsive to nonsymbolic or symbolic number formats are largely segregated in the MTL; abstract neurons that encode the same numerical value in both nonsymbolic and symbolic formats were rarely found. We therefore explored how the two populations of numerosity-selective and numeral-selective neurons encode numerical values. To evaluate the neuronal populations’ information carried about number, we first trained a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classifier to discriminate numerical values based on the spiking activity of selective MTL neurons (see Supplemental Information). After training, the classifier was tested with novel data from the same neuronal population to explore how well it could predict number categories based on the information extracted from trials used for classifier training. Initially, we performed a temporal cross-training classification to assess the classifier’s accuracy in identifying the correct numerical values when tested on the activity from a given time period after being trained on other time periods of the trials. With a chance performance of 20% (for five classes), the classifier accuracy was significantly higher for both nonsymbolic and symbolic number throughout the operand 1 and delay 1 phases, albeit with better performance during the nonsymbolic-format trials (Figures 5A and 5B ). Next, we trained and tested the classifier on the firing rates of each neuron obtained by averaging across the time window that had turned out significant in the cross-training classification. The resulting confusion matrices show robust accuracy (65.6% ± 2.5%) for the five numerosities in the nonsymbolic format represented by the diagonal (Figure 5C, left). The probability of misclassification of trials increased the closer two classes were in the numerical space (“distance effect”; Figure 5D, left). Also for number symbols, the numerical values could be classified significantly above chance level but with lower accuracy (38.8% ± 2.9%; Figure 5C, right). Misclassifications hardly varied as a function of numerical distance for number symbols (Figure 5D, right). At absolute numerical distances 2, 3, and 4, classification probabilities obtained for the classifiers (n = 32) trained on nonsymbolic and symbolic number neurons were almost identical and significantly higher for symbolic than for nonsymbolic number (p < 0.01; t test). This indicates a sharper transition from the preferred to all nonpreferred numbers and thus greater selectivity in neurons tuned to symbolic number. When applied to the entire set of single units regardless of numerosity selectivity (585 units), this analysis yielded qualitatively similar results (Figure S4). In addition, we analyzed the coding capacity and dynamics of the population of number-selective neurons by performing a multi-dimensional state-space analysis (see Supplemental Information) for nonsymbolic and symbolic numbers separately. At each point in time, the activity of n recorded neurons is defined by a point in n-dimensional space, with each dimension representing the activity of a single neuron. This results in trajectories that are traversed for different neuronal states, i.e., the five different numerical values in the nonsymbolic (Figure 6A, left) and symbolic format (Figure 6A, right). These trajectories reflect the instantaneous firing rates of the respective neuronal population as they evolve over time. To evaluate the temporal evolution of population numerical tuning in each format, we measured Euclidian distances between trial trajectories in the whole population space corresponding to the activity to the five numerical values. In the nonsymbolic format, the trajectory distances systematically increased with numerical distance (p < 0.001; permutation test for all trajectories; see Supplemental Information), starting shortly after onset of operand 1 until the end of the memory delay 1. The distances between the population trajectories confirm the findings based on single selective neurons: the closer two numerosities were in the numerical continuum, the more similar were the corresponding patterns of population activity and vice versa (Figure 6B, left). This argues for a numerical distance effect in the population data. In the symbolic format, the trajectory distances were much less pronounced but likewise tended to increase with numerical distance (p < 0.001 for 1 versus 4 in a permutation test), reflecting the remnants of a distance effect (Figure 6B, right). A comparison of the trajectory distances also suggests that MTL neurons responded longer lasting to the nonsymbolic format and throughout the working memory period (i.e., delay 1). In contrast, the responses to the symbolic format were more confined to the sample phase of operand 1. Again, this analysis yielded similar results when performed for the whole population of single units (Figure S5). After analysis of the responses to the operand 1, we also examined selectivity to the numerical value of operand 2 separately for nonsymbolic and symbolic number format. For the nonsymbolic format, 7.7% (45/585) of the tested neurons showed activity that varied exclusively with the number of operand 2 items during operand 2 presentation, irrespective of the dot array layout (5-factor sliding-window ANOVA with the factors numerical value of operand 1 [1–5], numerical value of operand 2 [0–5], protocol [standard and control], “mathematical rule” [addition and subtraction], and “rule cue” [word and symbol]; α = 0.01). Twenty-two of the units selective to nonsymbolic operand 1 (n = 92) were also tuned to nonsymbolic operand 2; of those, 9 cells had the same preferred number. Given that 20% of the selective units are expected to share the preferred number by chance (5 number values), this proportion of 9 cells was significantly higher (p < 0.05 in binomial test). The finding that cells that responded both to operand 1 and operand 2 tended to show the same preferred numerosity was also confirmed by a correlation analysis (Pearson’s r = 0.64; p = 0.0013; Figure S6). For the symbolic format, only a chance proportion of 1.5% (9/585) responded exclusively to the numerical value of the operand 2 during the presentation of the operand 2. The responses of a single neuron throughout the whole trial are shown in Figure S7. This neuron was significantly tuned to numerosity 5 of operand 1 during the operand 1 phase and of operand 2 during the operand 2 phase (Figure S7, upper histograms). This neuron also showed strong responses to the numerical values of the operand 2 during the symbolic format (Figure S7, lower histograms); however, it was also s"

Here, we report significant changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and a more robust anti-tumor response in immune competent BALB/c mice. 4T1 murine breast cancer cells were transfected with shRNA plasmids directed against LDH-A (KD) or a scrambled control plasmid (NC). Cells were also transduced with dual luciferase-based reporter systems to monitor HIF-1 activity and the development of metastases by bioluminescence imaging, using HRE-sensitive and constitutive promoters, respectively. The growth and metastatic profile of orthotopic 4T1 tumors developed from these cell lines were compared and a primary tumor resection model was studied to simulate the clinical management of breast cancer. Primary tumor growth, metastasis formation and TME phenotype were significantly different in LDH-A KD tumors compared with controls. In LDH-A KD cells, HIF-1 activity, hexokinase 1 and 2 expression and VEGF secretion were reduced. Differences in the TME included lower HIF-1α expression that correlated with lower vascularity and pimonidazole staining, higher infiltration of CD3+ and CD4+ T cells and less infiltration of TAMs. These changes resulted in a greater delay in metastases formation and 40% long-term survivors (>20 weeks) in the LDH-A KD cohort following surgical resection of the primary tumor. We show for the first time that LDH-depletion inhibits the formation of metastases and prolongs survival of mice through changes in tumor microenvironment that modulate the immune response. We attribute these effects to diminished HIF-1 activity, vascularization, necrosis formation and immune suppression in immune competent animals. Gene-expression analyses from four human breast cancer datasets are consistent with these results, and further demonstrate the link between glycolysis and immune suppression in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2892347062,"The behavioral response to a sensory stimulus may depend on both learned and innate neuronal representations. How these circuits interact to produce appropriate behavior is unknown. In Drosophila, the lateral horn (LH) and mushroom body (MB) are thought to mediate innate and learned olfactory behavior, respectively, although LH function has not been tested directly. Here we identify two LH cell types (PD2a1 and PD2b1) that receive input from an MB output neuron required for recall of aversive olfactory memories. These neurons are required for aversive memory retrieval and modulated by training. Connectomics data demonstrate that PD2a1 and PD2b1 neurons also receive direct input from food odor-encoding neurons. Consistent with this, PD2a1 and PD2b1 are also necessary for unlearned attraction to some odors, indicating that these neurons have a dual behavioral role. This provides a circuit mechanism by which learned and innate olfactory information can interact in identified neurons to produce appropriate behavior.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJmMGVmMmFhZjYxZWVkMTgyMTcyYTY2MGFlMDg5MWE0ZSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4OTM0MjI3fQ.BPDqqIahTuIDRzcZkV4x9PzqWMiZQ2E8pOxpaDzkpAKhRmkGln07yEfvvx5HVLQddkztp9Jt91dM8Xs1vZ7Fw4G5hOtTZh2djZuxABux-EYfppCn8pYpeiiemE_5o_rHlkNZsTFdOglbTS0fPc0J5OHW4YZCk4V1JB-dntTZHCvGptD3QT5jq2F7t-DYNbhgqZlNq9AG3Mpc_k0nfM-rnKfazJjpPUuNBd0SjY-fvonDPkq6q9d-ubw50LgyCn0aVRTEWpkg79kOAStbcaTY5zKaFU8xC5p1xYMrbXvJWpts4vLkuTQbmOOqFZUEfpVr_XPKfIml99ic9PjsiseXzw(mp4, (90.61 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2952868548,"In the ocean, the crab Cancer borealis is subject to daily and seasonal temperature changes. Previous work, done in the presence of descending modulatory inputs, had shown that the pyloric rhythm of the crab increases in frequency as temperature increases but maintains its characteristic phase relationships until it “crashes” at extremely high temperatures. To study the interaction between neuromodulators and temperature perturbations, we studied the effects of temperature on preparations from which the descending modulatory inputs were removed. Under these conditions, the pyloric rhythm was destabilized. We then studied the effects of temperature on preparations in the presence of oxotremorine, proctolin, and serotonin. Oxotremorine and proctolin enhanced the robustness of the pyloric rhythm, whereas serotonin made the rhythm less robust. These experiments reveal considerable animal-to-animal diversity in their crash stability, consistent with the interpretation that cryptic differences in many cell and network parameters are revealed by extreme perturbations."

We therefore established an efficient protocol for generating esophageal progenitor cells (EPCs) from human PSCs. We found that inhibition of TGF-ß and BMP signaling is required for sequential specification of EPCs, which can be further purified using cell-surface markers. These EPCs resemble their human fetal counterparts and can recapitulate normal development of esophageal stratified squamous epithelium during in vitro 3D cultures and in vivo. Importantly, combining hPSC differentiation strategies with mouse genetics elucidated a critical role for Notch signaling in the formation of this epithelium. These studies therefore not only provide an efficient approach to generate EPCs, but also offer a model system to study the regulatory mechanisms underlying development of the human esophagus."
https://openalex.org/W2892557172,"This study examines socio-economic determinants of food consumption patterns amongst women of reproductive age and children aged 6-59 months from urban poor settlements of Lusaka and their implications for nutritional status. Particular emphasis was placed on the role of fish in their diets and nutritional status.A cross-sectional survey design was applied, in which 714 mother-child dyads, with children aged 6-59 months were enrolled. A three-stage randomized cluster sampling approach was applied.The mean dietary diversity score among children aged 6-23 and 24-59 months was 2.98 (±1.27) and 3.478 (±1.07), respectively. In children aged 6-23 months, there was a significant difference in their nutritional status, based on fish consumption (χ2 = 10.979, df = 2, p = 0.004). Children from poorer households consumed mostly small fish (Kapenta). The quantity of fish consumed by children was significantly associated with stunting in both age groups, odds ratio = 0.947 (95% CI: 0.896, 1.000) for children aged 6-23 months and odds ratio = 1.038 (95% CI: 1.006, 1.072) for children aged 24-59 months old. Other significant risk factors for stunting in children aged 6-23 months were the child's age, mother's body mass index, access to treated water and child morbidity. Child's age, mother's educational level and wealth status were determinants of dietary diversity in children aged 6-59 months as shown by the Poisson regression.Nutritional status of children aged 6-23 months is associated with fish consumption, with children consuming fish less likely to be stunted. Small fish (Kapenta) is an animal-source food that is particularly important in the diet of children in urban poor households in Zambia and contributes to better nutritional outcomes. As all small fish stem from capture fisheries, sustainable one health environmental integration, monitoring and management strategies are desirable."
https://openalex.org/W2891080096,"Engineered staphylococcal pathogenicity islands offer a potentially superior alternative to phages for antibacterial therapy Staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococci continue to cause life-threatening infections in both hospital and community settings1,2,3. They have become increasingly resistant to antibiotics, especially β-lactams and aminoglycosides, and their infections are now, in many cases, untreatable. Here we present a non-antibiotic, non-phage method of treating staphylococcal infections by engineering of the highly mobile staphylococcal pathogenicity islands (SaPIs). We replaced the SaPIs' toxin genes with antibacterial cargos to generate antibacterial drones (ABDs) that target the infecting bacteria in the animal host, express their cargo, kill or disarm the bacteria and thus abrogate the infection. Here we have constructed ABDs with either a CRISPR–Cas9 bactericidal or a CRISPR–dCas9 virulence-blocking module. We show that both ABDs block the development of a murine subcutaneous S. aureus abscess and that the bactericidal module rescues mice given a lethal dose of S. aureus intraperitoneally."
https://openalex.org/W2894120541,"There has been a growing interest in the relationship between sedative-hypnotics use and the risk of Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) risk. This study aimed to evaluate the risk of AD associated with the use of sedative-hypnotics. A retrospective cohort study was conducted with randomly selected 5% samples from ≥50 years old beneficiaries of National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) of Korea from January 2002 to December 2015. The exposure to sedative-hypnotics was defined when prescribed over 30 defined daily dose (DDD) after January 2004 and it was categorized by prescribed dosage, types and half-lives of benzodiazepines. Time-dependent Cox regression model with a lag period of 5-years was used to evaluate the association between use of sedative-hypnotics and the risk of subsequent AD. Sensitivity analysis was performed for restricting sedative-hypnotics only when prescribed with insomnia. A total of 268,170 subjects were identified and subjects exposed to sedative-hypnotics showed a higher risk of AD (HR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.72–1.86) than those who were not. There was an increased risk of AD among subjects exposed to benzodiazepines or zolpidem (HR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.67–1.82) and antidepressants or low-dose antipsychotics (HR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.42–1.87). The risk of AD was increased regardless of dose of sedative-hypnotics and half-life among benzodiazepines, especially in exposure to more than 360 DDD of sedative-hypnotics (HR: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.60–1.99) and the long-acting benzodiazepine (HR:1.77; 95% CI: 1.65–1.89)."
https://openalex.org/W2892727393,"Matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9 (MMP-2/-9) are key tissue remodeling enzymes that have multiple overlapping activities critical for wound healing and tumor progression in vivo. To overcome issues of redundancy in studying their functions in vivo, we created MMP-2/-9 double knockout (DKO) mice in the C57BL/6 background to examine wound healing. We then bred the DKO mice into the polyomavirus middle T (PyVmT) model of breast cancer to analyze the role of these enzymes in tumorigenesis. Breeding analyses indicated that significantly fewer DKO mice were born than predicted by Mendelian genetics and weaned DKO mice were growth compromised compared with wild type (WT) cohorts. Epithelial wound healing was dramatically delayed in adult DKO mice and when the DKO was combined with the PyVmT oncogene, we found that the biologically related process of mammary tumorigenesis was inhibited in a site-specific manner. To further examine the role of MMP-2/-9 in tumor progression, tumor cells derived from WT or DKO PyVmT transgenic tumors were grown in WT or DKO mice. Ratiometric activatable cell penetrating peptides (RACPPs) previously used to image cancer based on MMP-2/-9 activity were used to understand differences in MMP activity in WT or knockout syngeneic tumors in WT and KO animals. Analysis of an MMP-2 selective RACPP in WT or DKO mice bearing WT and DKO PyVmT tumor cells indicated that the genotype of the tumor cells was more important than the host stromal genotype in promoting MMP-2/-9 activity in the tumors in this model system. Additional complexities were revealed as the recruitment of host macrophages by the tumor cells was found to be the source of the tumor MMP-2/-9 activity and it is evident that MMP-2/-9 from both host and tumor is required for maximum signal using RACPP imaging for detection. We conclude that in the PyVmT model, the majority of MMP-2/-9 activity in mammary tumors is associated with host macrophages recruited into the tumor rather than that produced by the tumor cells themselves. Thus therapies that target tumor-associated macrophage functions have the potential to slow tumor progression."

Moreover, swine can spread this virus to other species including humans. The virus persists in different types of swine farms as evident in a number of studies. The core objectives of this study are (i) to analyze the dynamics of influenza infection of a farrow-to-finish swine farm, (ii) to explore the reinfection at the farm level, and finally (iii) to examine the effectiveness of two control strategies: vaccination and reduction of indirect contact. The analyses are conducted using a deterministic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model. Simulation results show that the disease is maintained in gilts and piglets because of new susceptible pigs entering the population on a weekly basis. A sensitivity analysis shows that the results are not sensitive to variation in the parameters. The results of the reinfection simulation indicate that the virus persists in the entire farm. The control strategies studied in this work are not successful in eliminating the virus within the farm."
https://openalex.org/W2889848718,"The adrenal gland is a multiendocrine organ with a steroidogenic mesenchymal cortex and an inner catecholamine-producing medulla of neuroendocrine origin. After embryonic development, this plastic organ undergoes a functional postnatal remodeling. Elucidating these complex processes is pivotal for understanding the early bases of functional endocrine disorders and tumors affecting the mature gland. We developed an in vitro human adrenal cell model derived from fetal adrenal specimens at different gestational ages, consisting of neuroendocrine and cortical components and expressing the zona and functional markers of the original fetal organ. These cortical and neuroendocrine progenitor cells retain in vitro an intrinsic gestational-age-related differentiation and functional program. In vitro these cells spontaneously form 3-dimensional structure organoids with a structure similar to the fetal gland. The organoids show morphofunctional features and adrenal steroidogenic factor, steroid acute regulatory, cytochrome-P450-17A1, dosage-sensitive, sex-reversal, adrenal hypoplasia-critical region on chromosome X protein , NOTCH1, and nephroblastoma overexpressed/cysteine-rich protein 61/connective tissue growth factor/nephroblastoma overexpressed gene-3; stem (BMI1, nestin); and chromaffin (chromogranin A, tyrosine hydroxylase) markers similar to those of the populations of origin.

https://openalex.org/W2891295583,"It is controversial whether covariation between neuronal activity and perceptual choice (i.e., choice correlation) reflects the functional readout of sensory signals. Here, we combined choice-correlation measures and electrical microstimulation on a site-to-site basis in the medial superior temporal area (MST), middle temporal area (MT), and ventral intraparietal area (VIP) when macaques discriminated between motion directions in both fine and coarse tasks. Microstimulation generated comparable effects between tasks but heterogeneous effects across and within brain regions. Within the MST and MT, microstimulation significantly biased an animal’s choice toward the sensory preference instead of choice-related signals of the stimulated units. This was particularly evident for sites with conflict preference of sensory and choice-related signals. In the VIP, microstimulation failed to produce significant effects in either task despite strong choice correlations presented in this area. Our results suggest that sensory readout may not be inferred from choice-related signals during perceptual decision-making tasks."

The levels of ozone in Hanoi, Vietnam are frequently above the WHO guideline but very few studies on the effects of ambient ozone on human health have been conducted in this location. This study aimed to examine the effects of ozone on hospital admission for respiratory diseases in Hanoi, by diseases, ages and seasons.Hospital admissions, air pollutants and meteorological data were collected from January 2010 to June 2014. We used generalized linear models and distributed lag linear model to assess the association. In addition to full year analysis, we conducted restricted analysis of the data for two summer (from June-August) and winter (from December-February) seasons and grouped hospital admissions by diseases and ages (all ages, children 0 to 5 years and elderly >65 years). The delayed effect of ozone was assessed using lags of up to 5 days.Ozone has a stronger effect on the risk of hospital admission for respiratory diseases and wheeze-associated disorders in the winter. For respiratory diseases, children were affected by ozone more than other age groups in both winter and summer. Each increase of 10 μg/m3 of ozone is associated with an increase of 6.2% risk of admission for respiratory disease among children in the winter and 1.2% in the summer. For wheeze-associated disorders, the elderly group seemed to be more affected by ozone in full year and winter but no significant association was found between ozone and admission for wheeze-associated diseases in any age group.Ozone is a risk factor for respiratory admission, especially amongst children under 5 years old in Hanoi, and ozone has a stronger effect in the winter than in the summer in this city."

Precision toxicology can improve detection of subtle intracellular changes in response to exogenous substrates; thus, it facilitates in-depth research on bioactive molecules that may interfere with the onset of certain diseases. In the current study, troxerutin significantly relieved nephrotoxicity, increased endurance, and improved systemic energy metabolism and renal inflammation in OTA-induced nephrotic mice. Lipidomics showed that troxerutin effectively reduced the levels of triglycerides, phosphatidylcholines, and phosphatidylethanolamines in nephropathy. The mechanism was partly attributable to troxerutin in alleviating the aberrantly up-regulated expression of sphingomyelinase, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, and chloride channel 2. Renal tubular epithelial cells, the main site of toxin-induced accumulation of lipids in the kidney, were subjected to transcriptomic profiling, which uncovered several metabolic factors relevant to aberrant lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. Our work provides new insights into the molecular features of toxin-induced lipotoxicity in renal tubular epithelial cells in vivo and demonstrates the function of troxerutin in alleviating OTA-induced nephrosis and associated systemic energy metabolism disorders.-Yang, X., Xu, W., Huang, K., Zhang, B., Wang, H., Zhang, X., Gong, L., Luo, Y., He, X.

https://openalex.org/W2892118224,"Seagrass meadows provide a multitude of ecosystem services, including a capacity to sequester carbon dioxide (CO2) within their sediments. Seagrass research in the UK is lacking and there is no published data on sediment carbon (C) within UK seagrass meadows. We sampled 13 Zostera marina meadows along the southwest coast of the UK to assess the variability in their sedimentary organic carbon (OC) stocks. The study sites were considered representative of sub-tidal Z. marina meadows in the UK, spanning a gradient of sheltered to exposed sites, varying in formation, size and density, but found along the same latitudinal gradient. OC stocks (Cstocks) integrated across 100cm depth profiles were similar among all sites (98.01 ± 2.15 to 140.24 ± 10.27 Mg C ha-1), apart from at Drakes Island, which recorded an unusually high Cstock (380.07 ± 17.51 Mg C ha-1) compared to the rest of the region. The total standing stock of C in the top 100cm of the surveyed seagrass meadows was 66,337 t C, or the equivalent of 10,512 individual UK people’s CO2 emissions per year. This figure is particularly significant relative to the seagrass area, which totalled 549.79 ha. Using estimates of seagrass cover throughout the UK and recent UK C trading values we approximate that the monetary value of the UK’s seagrass standing C stock is between £2.6 million and £5.3 million. The C stock of the UK’s seagrass meadows represent one of the largest documented C stocks within Europe and are, therefore, of important ecosystem service value. The research raises questions concerning the reliability of using global or regional data as a proxy for local seagrass C stock estimates and adds to a growing body of literature that is looking to understand the mechanisms of seagrass C storage. When taken with the fact that seagrass meadows are an important habitat for commercially important and endangered species in the UK, along with their declining health and cover, this research supports the need for more robust conservation strategies for UK seagrass habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2891375693,"Background Adults with single sided deafness (SSD) have lost binaural function, which limits sound source localization, speech understanding in noise, and quality of life. For SSD patients, restoration of bilateral auditory input is possible only with a cochlear implant (CI). In this study, cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) and behavioral performance were measured in left-implanted (SSD-CI-L) and right-implanted (SSD-CI-R) patients before and after cochlear implantation. We hypothesized that improvements in behavioral performance would be accompanied by changes in CAEPs after cochlear implantation. Design Prospective longitudinal study. Setting Tertiary referral center. Method Nine right-handed adult SSD CI patients participated in the study. CAEPs were recorded before cochlear implantation and at 6 and 12 months post-implantation. CAEPs were elicited using speech stimuli (/ba/) delivered in sound field at 70 dBA. Global field power (GFP) latency and amplitude were calculated for P1, N1 and P2 peaks at each test session. CAEP were analyzed at frontocentral (Cz) and temporal (P7, P8, T7 and T8) and mastoid electrodes (M1 and M2) contralateral to the CI ear. Behavioral measures (sentence recognition in noise, with and without spatial cues) were collected at the same test sessions as for CAEPs. Speech performance and CAEPs were also measured in a control group of normal-hearing (NH) subjects. Results While increased N1 amplitude was observed in the scalp potential maps for GFP and Cz for SSD-CI-L patients after implantation, the changes were not statistically significant. Peak CAEP amplitude at electrodes to contralateral to the CI ear increased after cochlear implantation for all SSD-CI patients, but significant increases were observed only for mastoid sites. Peak latencies for some components at temporal and mastoid sites remained significantly longer than for the NH control group, even after cochlear implantation. For SSD-CI-R patients, P2 peak amplitude for baseline GFP and Cz was significantly lower than for the NH control group. A significant improvement for speech understanding in noise was observed at 12 months post-implantation when speech was presented to the CI ear and noise to the non-implanted ear. Conclusion After cochlear implantation, speech understanding significantly improved when speech and noise were spatially separated. The increased N1 amplitude for SSD-CI-L patients and the increased bilateral activation for all SSD-CI patients may reflect cortical reorganization and restoration of binaural function after one year of experience with the CI. However, because of the limited number of SSD patients, significant changes in cortical activity after cochlear implantation were often difficult to observe."
https://openalex.org/W2892545440,"Background Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been associated with decreased immunity to childhood tetanus and diphtheria immunizations. If these vaccinations are vulnerable to influence from PFASs, questions arise about associations with other common inoculations. Objective To examine whether serum PFASs were associated with reduced immunity to rubella immunization, and whether interactions with sex or ethnicity warranted analytic stratification. Usually, toxicology analyses are calculated controlling for race and sex. However, sex differences in immune function have been reported and a reduction of immunity to rubella in women could pose risks such miscarriage. Methods We analyzed a nationally representative sample of individuals ≥ 12 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for years 1999–2000 and 2003–2004 for whom PFAS measures were available. Our analytic strategy was to start with separate analyses for youth and adults controlling for several covariates including ethnicity and sex, as well as the interaction of these terms with PFASs. If there was a main effect of PFASs and an interaction term, we would stratify analyses of effect size. The outcome variable was Rubella IgG titers by quartile of perfluoroalkyl substances. Results After exclusion for missing data, the analyzed sample contained 581 adult women, 621 adult men, and 1012 youth. There was no significant effect of PFASs on immunity in youths but a significant effect of both PFOA and PFOS in adults, as well as a significant interaction of PFOA x sex and a borderline significant interaction of PFOS x sex. When effect size analyses were stratified by sex, a significant association between rubella titres and PFOA was found in men but not women and PFOS was not significant in either sex. Conclusions These results support our earlier studies showing sex specific responses to PFASs and indicate the importance of thinking carefully about analytic strategies in population based toxicology research."
https://openalex.org/W2891914291,"Hemochromatosis is a frequent genetic disorder, characterized by the accumulation of excess iron across tissues. Mutations in the FPN1 gene, encoding a cell surface iron exporter [ferroportin (Fpn)], are responsible for hemochromatosis type 4, also known as ferroportin disease. Recently, Fpn has been implicated in the regulation of manganese (Mn), another essential nutrient required for numerous cellular enzymes. However, the roles of Fpn in Mn regulation remain ill-defined, and the impact of disease mutations on cellular Mn levels is unknown. Here, we provide evidence that Fpn can export Mn from cells into extracellular space. Fpn seems to play protective roles in Mn-induced cellular toxicity and oxidative stress. Finally, disease mutations interfere with the role of Fpn in controlling Mn levels as well as the stability of Fpn. These results define the function of Fpn as an exporter of both iron and Mn and highlight the potential involvement of Mn dysregulation in ferroportin disease.—Choi, E.-K., Nguyen, T.-T., Iwase, S., Seo, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2893243188,"Floral induction that initiates bolting and flowering is crucial for reproductive fitness in radishes. CONSTANS-like (CO-like, COL) genes play an important role in the circadian clock, which ensures regular development through complicated time-keeping mechanisms. However, the specific biological and functional roles of each COL transcription factor gene in the radish remain unknown. In this study, we performed a genome-wide identification of COL genes in the radish genome of three cultivars including ‘Aokubi’, ‘kazusa’ and ‘WK10039’, and we analyzed their exon-intron structure, gene phylogeny and synteny, and expression levels in different tissues. The bioinformatics analysis identified 20 COL transcription factors in the radish genome, which were divided into three subgroups (Group I to Group III). RsaCOL-09 and RsaCOL-12 might be tandem duplicated genes, whereas the others may have resulted from segmental duplication. The Ka/Ks ratio indicated that all the COL genes in radish, Arabidopsis, Brassica rapa, Brassica oleracea, Capsella rubella and rice were under purifying selection. We identified 6 orthologous and 19 co-orthologous COL gene pairs between the radish and Arabidopsis, and we constructed an interaction network among these gene pairs. The expression values for each COL gene during vegetable and flower development showed that the majority of Group I members had similar expression patterns. In general, the expression of radish COL genes in Groups I and III decreased during development, whereas the expression of radish COL genes in Group II first increased and then decreased. Substantial numbers of radish COL genes were differentially expressed after vernalization treatment. The expression levels of RsaCOL-02 and RsaCOL-04 were significantly increased during vernalization treatment, while the expression of RsaCOL-10 was significantly decreased. These outcomes provide insights for improving the genetic control of bolting and flowering in radish and other root vegetable crops, and they facilitate genetic improvements to radish yields and quality."
https://openalex.org/W2894078325,"Blooms of Microcystis and other harmful cyanobacteria can degrade water quality by producing cyanotoxins or other toxic compounds. The goals of this study were (1) to facilitate understanding of community structure for various aquatic microorganisms in brackish water and freshwater regions with emphasis on cyanobacteria, and (2) to test a hypothesis that Microcystis genotypes that tolerate higher salinity were blooming in brackish water environments during the severe drought, 2014. Shotgun metagenomic analysis revealed that cyanobacteria dominated the brackish water region while bacteria dominated the freshwater region. A group of cyanobacteria (e.g., Aphanizomenon, Microcystis, Planktothrix, Pseudanabaena), bacteria (e.g., Bacillus, Porphyrobacter), and diatoms (Phaeodactylum and Thalassiosira) were abundant in the brackish water region. In contrast, Hassallia (cyanobacteria) and green algae (Nannochloropsis, Chlamydomonas, and Volvox) were abundant in the landward freshwater region. Station variation was also apparent. One landward sampling station located downstream of an urbanized area differed substantially from the other stations in terms of both water chemistry and community structure, with a higher percentage of arthropods, green algae, and eukaryotes. Screening of the Microcystis internal transcribed spacer region revealed six representative genotypes, and two of which were successfully quantified using qPCR (Genotypes I and VI). Both genotypes occurred predominantly in the freshwater region, so the data from this study did not support the hypothesis that salinity tolerant Microcystis genotypes bloomed in the brackish water region in 2014."
https://openalex.org/W2891148537,"Aims The cognitive profile of Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (DM1) has been described in recent decades. Moreover, DM1 patients show lowered social engagement and difficulties in social-cognitive functions. The aim of the present study is to explore whether social cognition impairment is present in DM1 taking into account the overall cognitive condition. Method 38 patients and a control group paired in age and gender participated in the study. All the participants had an IQ within the normal range. Subjects were administered an abbreviated neuropsychological battery which comprised a facial emotion recognition test (POFA) and Faux Pas Test, as well as a self-report questionnaire on cognitive and affective empathy (TECA). Results Statistically significant differences were found only for facial emotion recognition (U = 464.0, p = .006) with a moderate effect size (.31), with the controls obtaining a higher score than the patients. Analyzing each emotion separately, DM1 patients scored significantly lower than controls on the recognition of anger and disgust items. Emotion recognition did not correlate with genetic load, but did correlate negatively with age. No differences were found between patients and controls in any of the other variables related to Theory of Mind (ToM) and empathy. Conclusion DM1 does not manifest specific impairments in ToM since difficulties in this area predominantly rely on the cognitive demand of the tasks employed. However, a more basic process such as emotion recognition appears as a core deficit. The role of this deficit as a marker of aging related decline is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2890464105,"Objective The Fear Avoidance Components Scale (FACS) is a new patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire designed to comprehensively evaluate fear avoidance (FA) beliefs and attitudes in persons with painful medical conditions. The original English version has demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties, including concurrent and predictive validity. Two factors have been identified: 1. general fear avoidance; and 2. types of activities that are avoided. Methods The FACS was first translated into Serbian, and then psychometrically validated. A cohort of 322 chronic musculoskeletal pain subjects completed the FACS-Serb and additional FA-related patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. Their FACS-Serb scores were then compared to a cohort of 68 acute pain subjects. Results Test-retest reliability (ICC2,1 = 0.928) and internal consistency for both Factors (Cronbach α 0.904 and 0,880 respectively) were very good. An acceptable fit was found with a confirmatory factor analysis of the 2-factor model found with the original English version of the FACS. Strong associations were found among FACS-Serb scores and other PRO measures of pain catastrophizing, depressive/anxiety symptoms, perceived disability, and pain intensity (p<0.001 for all analyses). FACS-Serb total scores, separate Factor scores, and subjective pain ratings were significantly higher in the chronic vs. acute pain cohorts (p<0.001 for all analyses). Conclusions The FACS-Serb demonstrated strong psychometric properties, including strong reliability and internal consistency, criterion validity (through associations with other FA-related PRO measures), and discriminant validity (through comparisons with a separate acute pain cohort). The FACS-Serb appears to be a potentially useful pain-related assessment tool."
https://openalex.org/W2894532650,"Background Many studies have investigated what could attract insects of medical importance and a crucial role has lately been attributed to human skin odors. Most of these researches have been concerned with mosquitoes, e.g., vectors of dengue and malaria. Little is known about volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from human skin odors and their effects on leishmania vectors. Objective The present study aimed to identify the VOCs from human skin that can be attractive to female anthropophilic phlebotomine sandflies. Results Forty-two VOCs were identified from skin odors of 33 male volunteers, seven of which were tested in wind tunnel assays employing field-captured phlebotomine sandflies (75.4% identified as Lutzomyia intermedia). Hexane and (E)-oct-3-en-1-ol (octenol) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. 2-Phenylacetaldehyde (hereafter called phenylacetaldehyde), 6-methylhept-5-en-2-one (also known as sulcatone), nonadecane and icosane were found to activate female phlebotomine sandflies, but only phenylacetaldehyde, 6-methylhepten-5-en-2-one and icosane elicited attraction responses. Conclusions These results suggest that phenylacetaldehyde, 6-methylhepten-5-en-2-one and icosane may be suitable candidates for attractiveness experimentation in the field which can be an important tool to develop strategies concerning human beings protection against phlebotomine sandflies bites and consequently against leishmaniasis."
https://openalex.org/W2949709502,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the main site of protein synthesis, folding, and secretion to other organelles. The capacity of the ER to process proteins is limited, and excessive accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins can induce ER stress, which is associated with plant diseases. Here, a transgenic Arabidopsis system was established to express anti-cancer monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that recognize the tumor-associated antigen GA733-2. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) CO17-1A recognize a tumor-associated epitope expressed on the colorectal cancer cell surface. The ER retention Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) motif sequence was added to the C-terminus of the heavy chain to retain anti-colorectal cancer mAbs in the ER, consequently boosting mAb production. Agrobacterium-mediated floral dip transformation was used to generate T1 transformants, and homozygous T4 seeds obtained from transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing anti-colorectal cancer mAbs were used to confirm the physiological effects of KDEL tagging. Germination rates were not significantly different between both plants expressing mAb CO without KDEL mAb CO (CO plant) and mAb CO with KDEL mAb COK (COK plant). However, COK plants primary root lengths were shorter than those of CO plants and non-transgenic Arabidopsis plants in in vitro media. Most ER stress-related genes, with the exception of bZIP28 and IRE1a, were upregulated in COK plants compared to CO plants. Western blot and SDS-PAGE analyses showed that COK plants exhibited up to five times higher expression and mAb amounts than plants. Enhanced expression in mAb COK plants was confirmed by immunohistochemical analyses. mAb COK was distributed across most of the area of leaf tissues, whereas mAb CO was mainly distributed in extracellular areas. Surface plasmon resonance analyses revealed that mAb CO and mAb COK possessed equivalent or slightly better binding activities to antigen EpCAM compared to a commercially available parental antibody. N-glycosylation analysis showed that mAb CO had plant specific residues whereas mAb COK mainly showed an oligo-mannose N-glycan structure without the plant specific glycan residues. In this study, the reduction of plant growth and biomass induced by ER retention signal peptide might be only in in vitro conditions, and thus should be carefully considered for the initial screening for transgenic lines on culture media. Taken together, nevertheless the fusion of ER retention signal peptide is an effective approach for enhancing the yields of recombinant proteins in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2891864834,"White matter lesions (WMLs), detected as hyperintensities on T2-weighted MRI, represent small vessel disease in the brain and are considered a potential risk factor for memory and cognitive impairment in older adults. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between WMLs and cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ) burden in patients with cognitive impairment.A total of 83 patients with cognitive impairment, who underwent brain MRI and F-18 florbetaben PET, were included prospectively: 19 patients were cognitively unimpaired, 30 exhibited mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 34 exhibited dementia. The Fazekas scale was used to quantify WMLs on T2-weighted brain MR images. Cerebral Aβ burden was quantitatively estimated using volume-of-interest analysis. Differences in cerebral Aβ burden were evaluated between low-WML (Fazekas scale ≤1) and high-WML (Fazekas scale ≥2) groups. The relationship between the Fazekas rating and cerebral Aβ burden was evaluated using linear regression analysis after adjusting for age and sex.In the overall cohort, the high-WML group exhibited significantly higher Aβ burden compared with the low-WML group (P = 0.011) and cerebral Aβ burden was positively correlated with Fazekas rating (β = 0.299, P = 0.006). In patients with MCI, the high-WML group exhibited significantly higher Aβ burden compared with the low-WML group (P = 0.019) and cerebral Aβ burden was positively correlated with Fazekas rating (β = 0.517, P = 0.003).The presence of WMLs was associated with cerebral Aβ burden in patients with MCI. Our findings suggest that small vessel disease in the brain is related to Alzheimer's disease pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2892080361,"Innate immune cells, such as macrophages, respond to pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as a lipopolysaccharide (LPS), to secrete various inflammatory mediators. Recent studies have suggested that damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), released extracellularly from damaged or immune cells, also play a role in the activation of inflammatory responses. In this study, to prevent excess inflammation, we focused on DAMPs-mediated signaling that promotes LPS-stimulated inflammatory responses, especially adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-triggered signaling through the ionotropic purinergic receptor 7 (P2X7R), as a potential new anti-inflammatory target of natural polyphenols. We focused on the phenomenon that ATP accelerates the production of inflammatory mediators, such as nitric oxide, in LPS-stimulated J774.1 mouse macrophages. Using an siRNA-mediated knockdown and specific antagonist, it was found that the ATP-induced enhanced inflammatory responses were mediated through P2X7R. We then screened 42 polyphenols for inhibiting the ATP/P2X7R-induced calcium influx, and found that several polyphenols exhibited significant inhibitory effects. Especially, a flavonoid baicalein significantly inhibited ATP-induced inflammation, including interleukin-1β secretion, through inhibition of the ATP/P2X7R signaling. These findings suggest that ATP/P2X7R signaling plays an important role in excess inflammatory responses and could be a potential anti-inflammatory target of natural polyphenolic compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2892907508,"Introduction Proliferative glomerulonephritis manifests in a range of renal diseases and is characterized by the influx of inflammatory cells into the glomerulus. Heparan sulfate (HS) is an important (co-)receptor for binding of chemokines, cytokines and leukocytes to the endothelial glycocalyx, a thick glycan layer that covers the inside of blood vessels. During glomerulonephritis, HS in the glomerular endothelial glycocalyx plays a central role in chemokine presentation and oligomerization, and in binding of selectins and integrins expressed by leukocytes. We hypothesize that distinct endothelial HS domains determine the binding of different chemokines. In this study we evaluated the interaction of three pro-inflammatory chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2 and CCL2) with mouse glomerular endothelial cells (mGEnC-1) in ELISA in competition with different HS preparations and anti-HS single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies specific for distinct HS domains. Results HS appeared to be the primary ligand mediating chemokine binding to the glomerular endothelial glycocalyx in vitro. We found differential affinities of CXCL1, CXCL2 and CCL2 for HS in isolated mGEnC-1 glycocalyx, heparan sulfate from bovine kidney or low molecular weight heparin in competition ELISAs using mGEnC-1 as a substrate, indicating that chemokine binding is affected by the domain structure of the different HS preparations. Blocking of specific HS domains with anti-HS scFv antibodies revealed a domain-specific interaction of the tested chemokines to HS on mGEnC-1. Furthermore, chemokines did not compete for the same binding sites on mGEnC-1. Conclusion CXCL1, CXCL2 and CCL2 binding to the glomerular endothelial glycocalyx appears differentially mediated by specific HS domains. Our findings may therefore contribute to the development of HS-based treatments for renal and possibly other inflammatory diseases specifically targeting chemokine-endothelial cell interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2893048939,"Chromatin organization is crucial for nuclear functions such as gene regulation, DNA replication and DNA repair. Insulator binding proteins, such as the Drosophila Boundary Element-Associated Factor (BEAF), are involved in chromatin organization. To further understand the role of BEAF, we detected cis- and trans-interaction partners of four BEAF binding regions (viewpoints) using 4C (circular chromosome conformation capture) and analyzed their association with different genomic features. Previous genome-wide mapping found that BEAF usually binds near transcription start sites, often of housekeeping genes, so our viewpoints were selected to reflect this. Our 4C data show the interaction partners of our viewpoints are highly variable and generally enriched for active chromatin marks. The most consistent association was with housekeeping genes, a feature in common with our viewpoints. Fluorescence in situ hybridization indicated that the long-distance interactions occur even in the absence of BEAF. These data are most consistent with a model in which BEAF is redundant with other factors found at active promoters. Our results point to principles of long-distance interactions made by active chromatin, supporting a previously proposed model in which condensed chromatin is sticky and associates into topologically associating domains (TADs) separated by active chromatin. We propose that the highly variable long-distance interactions we detect are driven by redundant factors that open chromatin to promote transcription, combined with active chromatin filling spaces between TADs while packing of TADs relative to each other varies from cell to cell."
https://openalex.org/W2894112481,"Soil productivity is strongly influenced by the activities of microbial communities. However, it is not well understood how community structure, including its richness, mass, and composition, influences soil functions. We investigated the relationships between soil productivity and microbial communities in unfertilized arable soils extending over 1000 km in eastern Japan. Soil properties, including C turnover rate, N mineralization rate, microbial C, and various soil chemical properties, were measured. Soil bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed by Illumina’s MiSeq using 16S rRNA and ITS regions. In addition, root microbial communities from maize grown in each soil were also investigated. Soil bacterial communities shared many operational taxonomic units (OTUs) among farms. An ordination plot based on correspondence analysis revealed convergent distribution of soil bacterial communities across the farms, which seemed to be a result of similar agricultural management practices. Although fungal communities showed lower richness and a lower proportion of shared OTUs than bacterial communities, community structure between the farms tended to be convergent. On the other hand, root communities had lower richness and a higher abundance of specific taxa than the soil communities. Two soil functions, decomposition activity and soil productivity, were extracted by principal component analysis (PCA) based on eight soil properties. Soil productivity correlated with N mineralization rate, P2O5, and maize growth, but not with decomposition activity, which is characterized by C turnover rate, soil organic C, and microbial mass. Soil productivity showed a significant association with community composition, but not with richness and mass of soil microbial communities. Soil productivity also correlated with the abundance of several specific taxa, both in bacteria and fungi. Root communities did not show any clear correlations with soil productivity. These results demonstrate that community composition and abundance of soil microbial communities play important roles in determining soil productivity."
https://openalex.org/W2894131091,"Background Community Health Workers (CHWs) have a crucial role in improving health in their communities and their role is being expanded in many parts of the world. However, the effectiveness of CHWs is limited by poor training and the education of CHWs has received little scientific attention. Methods Our study was carried out in two districts of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We developed and piloted an inexpensive (two day) training intervention covering national government priorities: HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted disease and Tuberculosis; and Women’s Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights. Sixty-four CHWs consented to participate in the main study which measured knowledge gains using a modified Solomon design of four different testing schedules to distinguish between the effects of the intervention, testing and any interaction between intervention and testing. We also measured confidence, satisfaction and costs. Results Following the training intervention, improvements in knowledge scores were seen across topics and across districts. These changes in knowledge were statistically significant (p<0.001) and of large magnitude (over 45 percentage points or four standard deviations). However, the CHWs assigned to the test-test-train schedule in one district showed high gains in knowledge prior to receiving the training. All CHWs reported high levels of satisfaction with the training and marked improvements in their confidence in advising clients. The training cost around US$48 per CHW per day and has the potential to be cost-effective if the large gains in knowledge are translated into improved field-based performance and thus health outcomes. Conclusion Training CHWs can result in large improvements in knowledge with a short intervention. However, improvements seen in other studies could be due to test ‘reactivity’. Further work is needed to measure the generalisability of our results, retention of knowledge and the extent to which improved knowledge is translated into improved practice."
https://openalex.org/W2893683346,"Background In most emergency departments (EDs), few patients account for a relatively high number of ED visits. To improve the management of these patients, the university hospital of Lausanne, Switzerland, implemented an interdisciplinary case management (CM) intervention. This study examined whether the CM intervention—compared with standard care (SC) in the ED—reduced costs generated by frequent ED users, not only from the hospital perspective, but also from the third-party payer perspective, that is, from a broader perspective that takes into account the costs of health care services used outside the hospital offering the intervention. Methods In this randomized controlled trial, 250 frequent ED users (>5 visits during the previous 12 months) were allocated to either the CM or the SC group and followed up for 12 months. Cost data were obtained from the hospital’s analytical accounting system for the entire sample and from health insurance companies for a subgroup (n = 140). Descriptive statistics and multivariate regressions were used to make comparisons between groups and assess the contribution of patient characteristics to the main cost components. Results At the end of the 12-month follow-up, 115 patients were in the CM group and 115 in the SC group (20 had died). Despite differences in economic costs between patients in the CM intervention and the SC groups, our results do not show any statistically significant reduction in costs associated with the intervention, either for the hospital that housed the intervention or for the third-party payer. Frequent ED users were big users of health services provided by both the hospital and community-based services, with 40% of costs generated outside the hospital that housed the intervention. Higher age, Swiss citizenship, and having social difficulty increased costs significantly. Conclusions As the role of the CM team is to guide patients through the entire care process, the intervention location is not limited to the hospital but often extends into the community."
https://openalex.org/W2890658058,"Accommodative esotropia (AE) is a convergent deviation due to an excess of the convergence linked to the innervational stimulus for accommodation and it is usually associated to the presence of hyperopia. The development of hyperopia over time has been widely described but the lack of comparative analysis among accommodative esotropia subtypes, does not allow to verify the existence of different developmental patterns. In this study we aimed to describe the long term changes of refractive error in patients affected by accommodative esotropia as a function of the strabismus type: refractive (RAE), non-refractive (NRAE) and partially accommodative esotropia (PAE). The medical records of 66 patients (24 RAE, 22 PAE, 20 NRAE), who wore the full correction of their cycloplegic refraction error during the entire follow up period, were retrospectively reviewed. Mean outcome was the analysis of the variations, among groups, of refractive error over time; differences between mild (≤3.00D) and high (≥5.00D) hyperopia, effects of amblyopia and relationship with AC/A ratio were also investigated. All patients were followed up from approximately 4 years of age to 20, with mean follow up of 16.06±0.29 years. Our results described similar non-linear trend of refractive error development among groups. The initial increase of hyperopia (up to 7–8 years) was followed by a decreasing trend persisting up to adulthood (approximately 20 years of age). During this period, spherical equivalent decreased at a lower mean annual rate in patients affected by RAE (-0.07D) compared to other groups (NRAE -0.11D, p = 0.003 and PAE 0.13D, p = 0.002). In all groups, however, significant amount of hyperopia was found at last examination; indeed the observed difference in SE values from baseline to the end of follow up, was not significant (RAE: +0.27D, 95% C.I. -0.49 to +1.04D, p = 0.472; PAE: -0.69D, 95% C.I. -1.67 to +0.28D, p = 0.154; NRAE: -0.39D, 95% C.I. -1.11 to +0.34D, p = 0.278). AC/A ratio, amblyopia and amount of initial hyperopia appeared to have no significant role in longitudinal change of the refractive error. In conclusion, this study provides a complete overview, from childhood to adulthood, of refractive error development in different form of accommodative esotropia."
https://openalex.org/W2892474874,"Worldwide, native species increasingly contend with the interacting stressors of habitat fragmentation and invasive species, yet their combined effects have rarely been examined. Direct negative effects of invasive omnivores are well documented, but the indirect effects of resource competition or those caused by predator avoidance are unknown. Here we isolated and examined the independent and interactive effects of invasive omnivorous Black rats (Rattus rattus) and forest fragment size on the interactions between avian predators and their arthropod prey. Our study examines whether invasive omnivores and ecosystem fragment size impact: 1) the vertical distribution of arthropod species composition and abundance, and 2) the vertical profile of foraging behaviors of five native and two non-native bird species found in our study system. We predicted that the reduced edge effects and greater structural complexity and canopy height of larger fragments would limit the total and proportional habitat space frequented by rats and thus limit their impact on both arthropod biomass and birds’ foraging behavior. We experimentally removed invasive omnivorous Black rats across a 100-fold (0.1 to 12 ha) size gradient of forest fragments on Hawai‘i Island, and paired foraging observations of forest passerines with arthropod sampling in the 16 rat-removed and 18 control fragments. Rat removal was associated with shifts in the vertical distribution of arthropod biomass, irrespective of fragment size. Bird foraging behavior mirrored this shift, and the impact of rat removal was greater for birds that primarily eat fruit and insects compared with those that consume nectar. Evidence from this model study system indicates that invasive rats indirectly alter the feeding behavior of native birds, and consequently impact multiple trophic levels. This study suggests that native species can modify their foraging behavior in response to invasive species removal and presumably arrival through behavioral plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2891356420,"Hepatitis A is caused by hepatitis A virus and occurs worldwide. Estimating the transmissibility, which is usually characterized by the basic reproductive number R0, the mean number of secondary infectious cases generated by a single primary infectious case introduced into a totally susceptible population, provides crucial information for the effort required to stop infection spreading. Hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted indirectly through contaminated food and environment. An outbreak from March to June 2011 was reported to have occurred at an elementary school of 698 pupils in China and it was found that the outbreak was due to direct transmission between school children. Based on the symptom onset date and the social contact network of the children, in this study we estimate the serial interval (i.e. the gap in symptom onset between an infectee and its infector) and use different statistical methods to estimate R0. Combining with the positivity of IgG antibodies tests, we develop a compartmental transmission dynamics model which includes both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections to estimate the overall R0. Our analysis suggests a serial interval of mean = 23.9 days and standard deviation = 20.9 days. The different statistical methods suggest estimates for R0 in the outbreak varying from 2.1 to 2.8, and the estimates from the transmission dynamics model are consistent with this range. Our estimates are in agreement with that from one study in England but are higher than that from one study in the United States. Our transmission dynamics model suggests that the proportion of symptomatic infections is about 9%, implying that there were about 344 asymptomatic infections along with the 32 observed symptomatic cases. Furthermore, it is shown that the inclusion of asymptomatic infection in the epidemic process increases the estimate of R0 but does not do so greatly provided that the proportion of symptomatic infections is constant over the outbreak and there is no difference in transmissibility between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections."
https://openalex.org/W2894076824,"Quantifying the temporal and spatial patterns of temperature sensitivity (Q10) of soil respiration (Rs) as well as its controlling factors is critical to reveal the response the soil ecological processes to global warming and improve carbon budget estimations at a regional scale. The seasonal and annual variations in the temperature response of Rs were assessed during the two growing seasons in 2011 and 2012 in four different vegetation sites in a meadow steppe of the Songnen Plain, China. The Q10 values across all sites exhibited significant seasonal variations with a minimum value (1.81-2.34) occurring during summer and a peak value (3.82-4.54) occurring in either spring or autumn. The mean seasonal Q10 values showed no significant differences among the four different vegetation types. On the annual scale, however, the Chloris virgata site had significantly higher annual Q10 values (3.67-4.22) than the other three community sites in 2011 and 2012 and over the two years (2.01-3.67), indicating that the response of the Rs to climate warming may vary with vegetation type. The soil temperature and moisture had interactive effects on the variations of Q10 values. Soil temperature was the dominant factor influencing Q10 values, while soil moisture was an additional contributor to the variations of Q10. Due to the significant temporal and spatial variations in soil respiration response to temperature, acclimation of Rs to temperature variation should be taken into account in forecasting future terrestrial carbon cycle and its feedback to global warming."
https://openalex.org/W2893146790,"Amine oxidase, which participates in the metabolic processing of biogenic amines, is widely found in organisms, including higher organisms and various microorganisms. In this study, the full-length cDNA of a novel amine oxidase gene was cloned from the mud crab, Scylla paramamosain, and termed SpAMO. The cDNA sequence was 2,599 bp in length, including an open reading frame of 1,521 bp encoding 506 amino acids. Two amino acid sequence motifs, a flavin adenine dinucleotide-binding domain and a flavin-containing amine oxidoreductase, were highly conserved in SpAMO. A quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the expression level of SpAMO after quercetin treatment was time- and concentration-dependent. The expression of SpAMO tended to decrease and then increase in the brain and haemolymph after treatment with 5 mg/kg/d quercetin; after treatment with 50 mg/kg/d quercetin, the expression of SpAMO declined rapidly and remained low in the brain and haemolymph. These results indicated that quercetin could inhibit the transcription of SpAMO, and the high dose (50 mg/kg/d) had a relatively significant inhibitory effect. SpAMO showed the highest catalytic activity on serotonin, followed by dopamine, β-phenylethylamine, and spermine, suggesting that the specific substrates of SpAMO are serotonin and dopamine. A bioinformatics analysis of SpAMO showed that it has molecular characteristics of spermine oxidase, but a quercetin test and enzyme activity study indicated that it also functions like monoamine oxidase. It is speculated that SpAMO might be a novel amine oxidase in S. paramamosain that has the functions of both spermine oxidase and monoamine oxidase."

The objective of the study reported here was to measure the burden of exposure to infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), and intestinal parasites in a sample of broiler chickens on 13 farms on Santa Cruz Island and San Cristobal Island in July 2017. Blood serum samples were tested for detection of antibodies to IBDV, IBV, NDV, and MG by using an IDEXX Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay. In addition, fecal samples and pen bedding environmental samples were processed and analyzed for diagnosis of intestinal parasite eggs under a compound light microscope. The frequency of seropositive broilers to IBDV was 74/130 or 56% (95% CI = 48, 65%), to IBV was 27/130 or 20% (14, 28%), and to NDV was 1/130 or 0.7% (0.1, 4%). All broilers tested negative to MG antibodies. Eimeria spp. infection was common in study broilers. Finally, we observed interaction between broiler chickens and wild birds (finches) inside broiler pens, as well as the presence of backyard chickens inside property limits of study farms. This study produced evidence that exposure to IBDV, IBV, and intestinal parasites in broilers on Santa Cruz Island and San Cristobal Island is important. Study results are relevant because (i) they provide new baseline data on the burden of exposure to avian pathogens in broiler farms, (ii) justify the need to verify standard operating procedures in hatcheries that supply (non-vaccinated) day-old chicks to the Galapagos and (iii) to implement enhanced biosecurity standards on broiler chicken farms to mitigate risk of disease transmission between broilers, backyard poultry, and wild birds on the Galapagos."

We use the input delay method to turn the sampling system into a continuous time-delaying system. Then we analyze the exponential stability and asymptotic stability of the equilibrium points for this model. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov function, using the Lyapunov stability theorem and some inequality techniques, some sufficient criteria for ensuring the stability of equilibrium points are obtained. Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our results."
