In the visual system, these feedforward pathways define the classical feedforward receptive field (ffRF), the area in space in which visual stimuli excite a neuron1. The visual system also uses visual context—the visual scene surrounding a stimulus—to predict the content of the stimulus2, and accordingly, neurons have been identified that are excited by stimuli outside their ffRF3–8. However, the mechanisms that generate excitation to stimuli outside the ffRF are unclear. Here we show that feedback projections onto excitatory neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex generate a second receptive field that is driven by stimuli outside the ffRF. The stimulation of this feedback receptive field (fbRF) elicits responses that are slower and are delayed in comparison with those resulting from the stimulation of the ffRF. These responses are preferentially reduced by anaesthesia and by silencing higher visual areas. Feedback inputs from higher visual areas have scattered receptive fields relative to their putative targets in the primary visual cortex, which enables the generation of the fbRF. Neurons with fbRFs are located in cortical layers that receive strong feedback projections and are absent in the main input layer, which is consistent with a laminar processing hierarchy. The observation that large, uniform stimuli—which cover both the fbRF and the ffRF—suppress these responses indicates that the fbRF and the ffRF are mutually antagonistic. Whereas somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons are driven by these large stimuli, inhibitory neurons that express parvalbumin and vasoactive intestinal peptide have mutually antagonistic fbRF and ffRF, similar to excitatory neurons. Feedback projections may therefore enable neurons to use context to estimate information that is missing from the ffRF and to report differences in stimulus features across visual space, regardless of whether excitation occurs inside or outside the ffRF. By complementing the ffRF, the fbRF that we identify here could contribute to predictive processing. Feedback projections onto neurons of the mouse primary visual cortex generate a second excitatory receptive field that is driven by stimuli outside of the classical feedforward receptive field, with responses mediated by higher visual areas."

These pumps are used by microorganisms to convert light into membrane potential and have become useful optogenetic tools with applications in neuroscience. Although the resting state structures of the prototypical sodium pump Krokinobacter eikastus rhodopsin 2 (KR2) have been solved2,3, it is unclear how structural alterations over time allow sodium to be translocated against a concentration gradient. Here, using the Swiss X-ray Free Electron Laser4, we have collected serial crystallographic data at ten pump–probe delays from femtoseconds to milliseconds. High-resolution structural snapshots throughout the KR2 photocycle show how retinal isomerization is completed on the femtosecond timescale and changes the local structure of the binding pocket in the early nanoseconds. Subsequent rearrangements and deprotonation of the retinal Schiff base open an electrostatic gate in microseconds. Structural and spectroscopic data, in combination with quantum chemical calculations, indicate that a sodium ion binds transiently close to the retinal within one millisecond. In the last structural intermediate, at 20 milliseconds after activation, we identified a potential second sodium-binding site close to the extracellular exit. These results provide direct molecular insight into the dynamics of active cation transport across biological membranes. Crystallographic ‘snapshots’ taken at intervals of femtoseconds to milliseconds after activation show how a light-activated sodium pump carries sodium ions across the cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W3028239902,"Approximately one-third of the world's population suffers from allergies1. Exposure to allergens crosslinks immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies that are bound to mast cells and basophils, triggering the release of inflammatory mediators, including histamine2. Although IgE is absolutely required for allergies, it is not understood why total and allergen-specific IgE concentrations do not reproducibly correlate with allergic disease3-5. It is well-established that glycosylation of IgG dictates its effector function and has disease-specific patterns. However, whether IgE glycans differ in disease states or affect biological activity is completely unknown6. Here we perform an unbiased examination of glycosylation patterns of total IgE from individuals with a peanut allergy and from non-atopic individuals without allergies. Our analysis reveals an increase in sialic acid content on total IgE from individuals with a peanut allergy compared with non-atopic individuals. Removal of sialic acid from IgE attenuates effector-cell degranulation and anaphylaxis in several functional models of allergic disease. Therapeutic interventions-including removing sialic acid from cell-bound IgE with a neuraminidase enzyme targeted towards the IgE receptor FcεRI, and administering asialylated IgE-markedly reduce anaphylaxis. Together, these results establish IgE glycosylation, and specifically sialylation, as an important regulator of allergic disease."
https://openalex.org/W3026710232,"Mobile genetic elements threaten genome integrity in all organisms. RDE-3 (also known as MUT-2) is a ribonucleotidyltransferase that is required for transposon silencing and RNA interference in Caenorhabditis elegans1-4. When tethered to RNAs in heterologous expression systems, RDE-3 can add long stretches of alternating non-templated uridine (U) and guanosine (G) ribonucleotides to the 3' termini of these RNAs (designated poly(UG) or pUG tails)5. Here we show that, in its natural context in C. elegans, RDE-3 adds pUG tails to targets of RNA interference, as well as to transposon RNAs. RNA fragments attached to pUG tails with more than 16 perfectly alternating 3' U and G nucleotides become gene-silencing agents. pUG tails promote gene silencing by recruiting RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, which use pUG-tailed RNAs (pUG RNAs) as templates to synthesize small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Our results show that cycles of pUG RNA-templated siRNA synthesis and siRNA-directed pUG RNA biogenesis underlie double-stranded-RNA-directed transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in the C. elegans germline. We speculate that this pUG RNA-siRNA silencing loop enables parents to inoculate progeny against the expression of unwanted or parasitic genetic elements."
https://openalex.org/W3033539845,"Introduction The geriatric syndromes of frailty, sarcopenia, weight loss, and dementia are highly prevalent in elderly individuals across all care continuums. Despite their deleterious impact on quality of life, disability, and mortality in older adults, they are frequently under-recognized. At Saint Louis University, the Rapid Geriatric Assessment (RGA) was developed as a brief screening tool to identify these four geriatric syndromes. Materials and methods From 2015–2019, the RGA, comprised of the FRAIL, SARC-F, Simplified Nutritional Appetite Questionnaire (SNAQ), and Rapid Cognitive Screen (RCS) tools and a question on Advance Directives, was administered to 11,344 individuals ≥ 65 years of age across Missouri in community, office-based, hospital, Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), and nursing home care settings. Standard statistical methods were used to calculate the prevalence of frailty, sarcopenia, weight loss, and dementia across the sample. Results Among the 11,344 individuals screened by the RGA, 41.0% and 30.4% met the screening criteria for pre-frailty and frailty respectively, 42.9% met the screening criteria for sarcopenia, 29.3% were anorectic and at risk for weight loss, and 28.1% screened positive for dementia. The prevalence of frailty, risk for weight loss, sarcopenia, and dementia increased with age and decreased when hospitalized patients and those in the PACE program or nursing home were excluded. Conclusions Using the RGA as a valid screening tool, the prevalence of one or more of the geriatric syndromes of frailty, sarcopenia, weight loss, and dementia in older adults across all care continuums is quite high. Management approaches exist for each of these syndromes that can improve outcomes. It is suggested that the brief RGA screening tool be administered to persons 65 and older yearly as part of the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit."
https://openalex.org/W3033963247,"Fiber release during domestic textile washing is a cause of marine microplastic pollution, but better understanding of the magnitude of the issue and role of fabric care products, appliances and washing cycles is needed. Soiled consumer wash loads from U.K. households were found to release a mean of 114 ± 66.8 ppm (mg microfiber per kg fabric) (n = 79) fibers during typical washing conditions and these were mainly composed of natural fibers. Microfiber release decreased with increasing wash load size and hence decreasing water to fabric ratio, with mean microfiber release from wash loads in the mass range 1.0–3.5 kg (n = 57) found to be 132.4 ± 68.6 ppm, significantly (p = 3.3 x 10−8) higher than the 66.3 ± 27.0 ppm of those in the 3.5–6.0 kg range (n = 22). In further tests with similar soiled consumer wash loads, moving to colder and quicker washing cycles (i.e. 15°C for 30 mins, as opposed to 40°C for 85 mins) significantly reduced microfiber generation by 30% (p = 0.036) and reduced whiteness loss by 42% (p = 0.000) through reduced dye transfer and soil re-deposition, compared to conventional 40°C cycles. In multicycle technical testing, detergent pods were selected for investigation and found to have no impact on microfiber release compared to washing in water alone. Fabric softeners were also found to have no direct impact on microfiber release in testing under both European and North American washing conditions. Extended testing of polyester fleece garments up to a 48-wash cycle history under European conditions found that microfiber release significantly reduced to a consistent low level of 28.7 ± 10.9 ppm from eight through 64 washes. Emerging North American High-Efficiency top-loading washing machines generated significantly lower microfiber release than traditional top-loading machines, likely due to their lower water fill volumes and hence lower water to fabric ratio, with a 69.7% reduction observed for polyester fleece (n = 32, p = 7.9 x 10−6) and 37.4% reduction for polyester T-shirt (n = 32, p = 0.0032). These results conclude that consumers can directly reduce the levels of microfibers generated per wash during domestic textile washing by using colder and quicker wash cycles, washing complete (but not overfilled) loads, and (in North America) converting to High-Efficiency washing machines. Moving to colder and quicker cycles will also indirectly reduce microfiber release by extending the lifetime of clothing, leading to fewer new garments being purchased and hence lower incidence of the high microfiber release occurring during the first few washes of a new item."
https://openalex.org/W3024183622,"On average, Peruvian individuals are among the shortest in the world1. Here we show that Native American ancestry is associated with reduced height in an ethnically diverse group of Peruvian individuals, and identify a population-specific, missense variant in the FBN1 gene (E1297G) that is significantly associated with lower height. Each copy of the minor allele (frequency of 4.7%) reduces height by 2.2 cm (4.4 cm in homozygous individuals). To our knowledge, this is the largest effect size known for a common height-associated variant. FBN1 encodes the extracellular matrix protein fibrillin 1, which is a major structural component of microfibrils. We observed less densely packed fibrillin-1-rich microfibrils with irregular edges in the skin of individuals who were homozygous for G1297 compared with individuals who were homozygous for E1297. Moreover, we show that the E1297G locus is under positive selection in non-African populations, and that the E1297 variant shows subtle evidence of positive selection specifically within the Peruvian population. This variant is also significantly more frequent in coastal Peruvian populations than in populations from the Andes or the Amazon, which suggests that short stature might be the result of adaptation to factors that are associated with the coastal environment in Peru. In an ethnically diverse group of Peruvian individuals, the population-specific, missense variant in FBN1 (E1297G) is associated with lower height and shows evidence of positive selection within the Peruvian population."
https://openalex.org/W3033518580,"Immigration- and enforcement-related policies and laws have significantly and negatively impacted the health and well-being of undocumented immigrants. We examine barriers and facilitators to healthcare and social services among undocumented Latino(a)/Latinx immigrants specifically in the post 2016 US presidential election socio-political climate. By grounding our study on the perspectives of frontline providers, we explore their challenges in meeting the needs of their undocumented clients. These include client access to healthcare and social services, the barriers providers face in providing timely and effective services, and avenues to reduce or overcome factors that impede service provision to improve quality of care for this population. Data are from 28 in-depth interviews with frontline healthcare and social service providers. Based on data analysis, we found that the domains of the Three Delays Model used in obstetric care provided a good framework for organizing and framing the responses. Our findings suggest that these undocumented clients encounter three phases of delay: delay in the decision to seek care, delay in identifying and traveling to healthcare facilities, and delay in receiving adequate and appropriate care at healthcare facilities. Given the current socio-political climate for immigrants, healthcare and social services organizations that serve undocumented clients should adapt existing services or introduce new services, including those that are not site-based."
https://openalex.org/W3033654279,"Introduction Depression is a public health concern among youth, and it is pertinent to identify factors that can help prevent development of depressive symptoms in adolescence. This study aimed to investigate the association between negative life events and depressive symptoms among adolescents, and to examine the influence and relative contributions of personal, social and family protective factors related to resilience. Methods Data stem from the cross-sectional youth@hordaland-survey, conducted in Hordaland, Norway. In all, 9,546 adolescents, aged 16–19 years old (52.8% girls) provided self-report information on depressive symptoms, negative life events and protective factors related to resilience. Results Experiencing a higher number of negative life events was related to increases in depressive symptoms, while the potential protective factors goal orientation, self-confidence, social competence, social support, and family cohesion individually were associated with fewer symptoms. Although there were small moderating effects of goal orientation and self-confidence, the results mainly supported a compensatory resilience model. When considering the potential protective factors jointly, only self-confidence and family cohesion were significantly associated with fewer depressive symptoms for both genders, with the addition of social support for girls. There were significant interactions between all the potential protective factors and gender, indicating a greater reduction of depressive symptoms with higher levels of protective factors among girls. Conclusions Interventions aimed at fostering self-confidence and family cohesion could be effective in preventing depressive symptoms for adolescent boys and girls, regardless of their exposure to negative events. Results further indicate that preventive interventions targeting these potential protective factors could be especially beneficial for adolescent girls."
https://openalex.org/W3033327736,"Background The most prevalent nutritional disorders worldwide are childhood overweight or obesity. Various factors clearly contribute to the childhood obesity epidemic. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of childhood obesity in children of primary schools, and determine the influence of eating behavior and lifestyle in such a condition. Methods The study based on a cross sectional survey including school children aged 6–11 years. Pupils were from different schools in Sharjah, UAE. Outcome measures used in this study covered health characteristics; child habits and lifestyle; disease status and medication. Results The number of pre-validated surveys distributed was 932 and those returned counted to 678, giving a response rate of 72.8%. More than half (379; 55.9%) of the participants were females and 191 (28.2%) of the children were obese or overweight. Almost one quarter (162; 23.9%) of the children was physically inactive. Additionally, candy and fast food consumption was significantly high (370; 54.6%) and (324; 47.8%) respectively. Participant’s food, age and time spent on TV were significantly associated with body mass index (BMI). Conclusion Prevalence of overweight and obesity in the Emirate of Sharjah is high in both genders and across all ages of the study population. Contributing factors may include; sedentary lifestyle, consumption of unhealthy food and family history. There is a need for an immediate attention and measures to reduce the prevalence of obesity and associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3033004471,"While the epidemiologic burden of mental health disorders in the United States has been well described over the past decade, we know relatively little about trends in how these disorders are being studied through clinical research. We examined all US interventional mental health trials submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov between October 1, 2007 and April 30, 2018 to identify trends in trial characteristics, comparisons with non-mental health trials, and trial attributes associated with discontinuation and results reporting. International data were excluded to minimize potential confounding. Over this period, mental health and non-mental health trials grew at similar rates, though Industry and US government-funded trials declined and academic medical center/hospital/other (AMC/Hosp/Oth) funded trials grew faster in mental health research. The proportion of trials with safeguards against bias, including blinding and oversight by data monitoring committees (DMCs), decreased. This occurred during growth in the proportion of trials studying behavioral and non-pharmacological interventions, which often cannot be blinded and do not require DMC oversight. There was concurrent decline in pharmaceutical trials. There was significant growth in trials studying Non-DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5) conditions (e.g. suicidality and wellness), as well as substance use, anxiety, and neurocognitive disorders. One in 12 trials was discontinued. Trial discontinuation was associated with industry and AMC/Hosp/Oth funders, pharmaceutical interventions, and lack of DMC oversight. Only 29.9% of completed trials reported results to the registry. Decreased results reporting was associated with behavioral interventions, phase 1 trials, and industry and AMC/Hosp/Oth funders. The main implications of these data are that funding is shifting away from traditional government and industry sources, there is increasing interest in non-pharmacological treatments and Non-DSM conditions, and there are changing norms in trial design characteristics regarding safeguards against bias. These trends can guide researchers and funding bodies when considering the trajectory of future mental health research."
https://openalex.org/W3033161459,"The success of tree recruitment in Mediterranean holm oak (Quercus ilex) forests is threatened by the increasing intensity, duration and frequency of drought periods. Seedling germination and growth are modulated by complex interactions between abiotic (microhabitat conditions) and biotic factors (mycorrhiza association) that may mitigate the impacts of climate change on tree recruitment. To better understand and anticipate these effects, we conducted a germination experiment in a long-term precipitation reduction (PR) field experiment where we monitored seedling establishment and survival, micro-habitat conditions and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) colonization by different mycelia exploration types during the first year of seedling growth. We hypothesized that (i) the PR treatment decreases seedling survival relative to the control with ambient conditions, (ii) microhabitat conditions of water and light availability are better predictors of seedling survival than the PR treatment, (iii) the PR treatment will favour the development of ECM exploration types with drought-resistance traits such as differentiated rhizomorphs. Contrary to our first hypothesis, seedling survival was lower in control plots with overall higher soil moisture. Micro-habitat light and soil moisture conditions were better predictors of seedling survival and growth than the plot-level PR treatment, confirming our second hypothesis. Furthermore, in line with our third hypothesis, we found that ECM with longer extramatrical mycelia were more abundant in the PR treatment plots and were positively correlated to survival, which suggests a potential role of this ECM exploration type in seedling survival and recruitment. Although summer drought was the main cause of seedling mortality, our study indicates that drier conditions in spring can increase seedling survival, presumably through a synergistic effect of drought adapted ECM species and less favourable conditions for root pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3033161637,"Reduced physical exercise can impact children's mental health. Use of active electronic games can help promote psychological health. Physical education (PE class) uses different resources, methods, and contents to promote student health. We investigated the effect of exergames on the mood and self-esteem of children and compare it that of with traditional PE classes. From a sample of 213 children (7-11 years old), 140 from 10 classes of the fourth and fifth grades of elementary school (59 boys, 81 girls; mean age 9.41±0.48 years), allocated to an experimental group (EG; n = 68; five clusters) and a PE group (PE; n = 72; five clusters), participated in this experimental controlled study. The EG practiced exergames during three 40-minute classes, and the PE group held three routine curricular PE classes. Brunel's Mood Scale and Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale were applied. Repeated measures ANOVA identified differences between sexes and groups. The main results of the EG demonstrated reduced tension in girls (p <0.05; ES: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.17-1.05). Regarding sex comparisons, anger was lower in girls (F: 4.57; p <0.05; ES: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.11-1.11) in the EG. Vigor was higher in girls in the EG than in those in the PE group (F: 5.46; p <0.05; ES: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.12-1.01). The main results of the PE group indicated increased self-esteem in boys (p <0.05; ES: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.08-1.07) and reduction of girls' mental confusion (p <0.05; ES 0.58; 95% CI 0.15-1.06). Thus, exergames impact boys' and girls' self-esteem and mood, as well as traditional physical education classes. Further study on exergames in schools is essential, with long-term effects on physical and mental health. Exergames bring interesting, varied content, technology, and innovation that can increase the attractiveness of physical education."
https://openalex.org/W3033614723,"Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels can help predict the prognosis of colorectal cancer patients. Accordingly, high preoperative CEA levels that is not restored after surgery are indicative of a worse outcome. On the other hand, smoking can increase serum CEA levels independently of the disease status. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the impact of smoking on the prognostic value of serum CEA levels. This retrospective cohort study included 273 patients who underwent curative resection for stage I–III colorectal adenocarcinoma at a single institution, between January 2010 and December 2017. Patients were grouped as follows: group A, normal preoperative and postoperative CEA levels (n = 152); group B, elevated preoperative CEA levels that returned to reference values after surgery (n = 69); and group C, elevated postoperative serum CEA levels (n = 52). Patients were also grouped according to their smoking history: group S (current smokers, n = 79) and group NS (never and former smokers, n = 194). Group A showed a higher 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate (84.9%) than groups B (75.4%) and C (62.0%) (p < 0.001). Postoperative serum CEA levels were significantly higher in the S group than in the NS group (2.6 vs. 3.1 ng/mL, p = 0.009), whereas preoperative levels were similar (3.8 vs. 4.1, p = 0.182). Further, smokers showed higher 3 year-DFS rates than nonsmokers in group C (83.3% vs. 43.9%, p = 0.029). This suggests that while elevated postoperative CEA levels are associated with lower DFS rates in never and former smokers, they are not associated with lower DFS rates in current smokers. We conclude that persistent smoking alters the prognostic value of postoperative serum CEA levels in colorectal cancer patients and that, consequently, alternative surveillance strategies need to be developed for colon cancer patients with smoking habits."
https://openalex.org/W3033116844,"Equinus deformity is one of the most common gait deformities in children with cerebral palsy. We examined whether estimates of gastrocnemius length in gait could identify limbs likely to have short-term and long-term improvements in ankle kinematics following gastrocnemius lengthening surgery to correct equinus. We retrospectively analyzed data of 891 limbs that underwent a single-event multi-level surgery (SEMLS), and categorized outcomes based on the normalcy of ankle kinematics. Limbs with short gastrocnemius lengths that received a gastrocnemius lengthening surgery as part of a SEMLS (case limbs) were 2.2 times more likely than overtreated limbs (i.e., limbs who did not have short lengths, but still received a lengthening surgery) to have a good surgical outcome at the follow-up gait visit (good outcome rate of 71% vs. 33%). Case limbs were 1.2 times more likely than control limbs (i.e., limbs that had short gastrocnemius lengths but no lengthening surgery) to have a good outcome (71% vs. 59%). Three-fourths of the case limbs with a good outcome at the follow-up gait visit maintained this outcome over time, compared to only one-half of the overtreated limbs. Our results caution against over-prescription of gastrocnemius lengthening surgery and suggest gastrocnemius lengths can be used to identify good surgical candidates."
https://openalex.org/W3033361750,"The essential role of journals as registries of scientific activity in all areas of knowledge justifies concern about their ownership and type of access. The purpose of this research is to analyze the main characteristics of publishers with journals that have received the DOAJ Seal. The specific objectives are a) to identify publishers and journals registered with the DOAJ Seal; b) to characterize those publishers; and c) to analyze their article processing fees. The research method involved the use of the DOAJ database, the Seal option and the following indicators: publisher, title, country, number of articles, knowledge area, article processing charges in USD, time for publication in weeks, and year of indexing in DOAJ. The results reveal a fast-rising oligopoly, dominated by Springer with 35% of the titles and PLOS with more than 20% of the articles. We've identified three models of expansion: a) a few titles with hundreds of articles; b) a high number of titles with a mix of big and small journals; and c) a high number of titles with medium-size journals. We identify a high number of titles without APCs (27%) in all areas while medicine was found to be the most expensive area. Commercial publishers clearly exercise control over the scope of journals and the creation of new titles, according to the interests of their companies, which are not necessarily the same as those of the scientific community or of society in general."
https://openalex.org/W3034146909,"The biology of how faces are built and come to differ from one another is complex. Discovering normal variants that contribute to differences in facial morphology is one key to untangling this complexity, with important implications for medicine and evolutionary biology. This study maps quantitative trait loci (QTL) for skeletal facial shape using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice. The DO is a randomly outcrossed population with high heterozygosity that captures the allelic diversity of eight inbred mouse lines from three subspecies. The study uses a sample of 1147 DO animals (the largest sample yet employed for a shape QTL study in mouse), each characterized by 22 three-dimensional landmarks, 56,885 autosomal and X-chromosome markers, and sex and age classifiers. We identified 37 facial shape QTL across 20 shape principal components (PCs) using a mixed effects regression that accounts for kinship among observations. The QTL include some previously identified intervals as well as new regions that expand the list of potential targets for future experimental study. Three QTL characterized shape associations with size (allometry). Median support interval size was 3.5 Mb. Narrowing additional analysis to QTL for the five largest magnitude shape PCs, we found significant overrepresentation of genes with known roles in growth, skeletal and facial development, and sensory organ development. For most intervals, one or more of these genes lies within 0.25 Mb of the QTL’s peak. QTL effect sizes were small, with none explaining more than 0.5% of facial shape variation. Thus, our results are consistent with a model of facial diversity that is influenced by key genes in skeletal and facial development and, simultaneously, is highly polygenic."
https://openalex.org/W3033418898,"Shallow-sea hydrothermal systems, like their deep-sea and terrestrial counterparts, can serve as relatively accessible portals into the microbial ecology of subsurface environments. In this study, we determined the chemical composition of 47 sediment porewater samples along a transect from a diffuse shallow-sea hydrothermal vent to a non-thermal background area in Paleochori Bay, Milos Island, Greece. These geochemical data were combined with thermodynamic calculations to quantify potential sources of energy that may support in situ chemolithotrophy. The Gibbs energies (ΔGr) of 730 redox reactions involving 23 inorganic H-, O-, C-, N-, S-, Fe-, Mn-, and As-bearing compounds were calculated. Of these reactions, 379 were exergonic at one or more sampling locations. The greatest energy yields were from anaerobic CO oxidation with NO2- (-136 to -162 kJ/mol e-), followed by reactions in which the electron acceptor/donor pairs were O2/CO, NO3-/CO, and NO2-/H2S. When expressed as energy densities (where the concentration of the limiting reactant is taken into account), a different set of redox reactions are the most exergonic: in sediments affected by hydrothermal input, sulfide oxidation with a range of electron acceptors or nitrite reduction with different electron donors provide 85~245 J per kg of sediment, whereas in sediments less affected or unaffected by hydrothermal input, various S0 oxidation reactions and aerobic respiration reactions with several different electron donors are most energy-yielding (80~95 J per kg of sediment). A model that considers seawater mixing with hydrothermal fluids revealed that there is up to ~50 times more energy available for microorganisms that can use S0 or H2S as electron donors and NO2- or O2 as electron acceptors compared to other reactions. In addition to revealing likely metabolic pathways in the near-surface and subsurface mixing zones, thermodynamic calculations like these can help guide novel microbial cultivation efforts to isolate new species."
https://openalex.org/W3033251678,"Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is heterogeneous, composed of particles with variable atherogenicity. Electronegative L5 LDL exhibits atherogenic properties in vitro and in vivo, and its levels are elevated in patients with increased cardiovascular risk. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) content is increased in L5, but what role APOE plays in L5 function remains unclear. Here, we characterized the contributions of APOE posttranslational modification to L5’s atherogenicity. Using two-dimensional electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we studied APOE’s posttranslational modification in L5 from human plasma. APOE structures with various glycan residues were predicted. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation were performed to examine the functional changes of APOE resulting from glycosylation. We also examined the effects of L5 deglycosylation on endothelial cell apoptosis. The glycan sequence N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, and sialic acid was consistently expressed on serine 94, threonine 194, and threonine 289 of APOE in L5 and was predicted to contribute to L5’s negative surface charge and hydrophilicity. The electrostatic force between the negatively charged sialic acid-containing glycan residue of APOE and positively charged amino acids at the receptor-binding area suggested that glycosylation interferes with APOE’s attraction to receptors, lipid-binding ability, and lipid transportation and metabolism functions. Importantly, L5 containing glycosylated APOE induced apoptosis in cultured endothelial cells through lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) signaling, and glycosylation removal from L5 attenuated L5-induced apoptosis. APOE glycosylation may contribute to the atherogenicity of L5 and be a useful biomarker for rapidly quantifying L5."
https://openalex.org/W3033569042,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex and heterogeneous disease, with oxidative stress and inflammation implicated in its development. Uric acid (UA) could exert anti-oxidative, pro-oxidative or pro-inflammatory effects, depending on the specific context. It was recently shown that soluble UA, and not just its crystals, could activate the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, leading to interleukin (IL)-1β secretion. We aimed to assess the differences in blood levels of UA and its ratio with creatinine (UCR) between COPD patients and healthy subjects, as well as their association with disease severity, smoking status, common COPD comorbidities and therapy regimes. The diagnostic characteristics of UA and UCR were also explored. This study included 109 stable COPD patients and 95 controls and measured white blood cells (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen (Fbg), IL-1β, creatinine (CREAT) and UA. All of the parameters were increased in COPD patients, except for CREAT. UA and UCR were positively associated with WBC, CRP and IL-1β. COPD smokers had lower UA and UCR values. Common COPD therapy did not affect UA or UCR, while patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) had higher UA, but not UCR, levels. Patients with higher UCR values showed worse disease-related outcomes (lung function, symptoms, quality of life, history of exacerbations, BODCAT and BODEx). Also, UCR differentiated patients with different severity of airflow limitation as well as symptoms and exacerbations. The great individual predictive potential of UCR and IL-1β was observed with their odds ratios (OR) being 2.09 and 5.53, respectively. Multiparameter models of UA and UCR that included IL-1β were able to correctly classify 86% and 90% of cases, respectively. We suggest that UA might be a useful biomarker when combined with IL-1β, while UCR might be even more informative and useful in overall COPD assessments."
https://openalex.org/W3033799961,"The Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) involves a simple structure first-order three-factor oblique model, with factors for depression, anxiety, and stress. Recently, concerns have been raised over the value of using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for studying the factor structure of scales in general. However, such concerns can be circumvented using exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM). Consequently, the present study used CFA and ESEM with target rotation to examine the factor structure of the DASS-21 among an adult community. It compared first-order CFA, ESEM with target rotation, bi-factor CFA (BCFA), and bi-factor BESEM with target rotation models with group/specific factors for depression, anxiety, and stress. A total of 738 adults (males = 374, and females = 364; M = 25.29 years; SD = 7.61 years) completed the DASS-21. While all models examined showed good global fit values, one or more of the group/specific factors in the BCFA, ESEM with target rotation and BESEM with target rotation models were poorly defined. As the first-order CFA model was most parsimonious, with well-defined factors that were also supported in terms of their reliabilities and validities, this model was selected as the preferred DASS-21 model. The implications of the findings for use and revision of the DASS-21 are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3033932132,"Early, ideally pre-symptomatic, recognition of common diseases (e.g., heart disease, cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease) facilitates early treatment or lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise. Sensitive, specific identification of diseases using blood samples would facilitate early recognition. We explored the potential of disease identification in high dimensional blood microRNA (miRNA) datasets using a powerful data reduction method: principal component analysis (PCA). Using Qlucore Omics Explorer (QOE), a dynamic, interactive visualization-guided bioinformatics program with a built-in statistical platform, we analyzed publicly available blood miRNA datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) maintained at the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The miRNA expression profiles were generated from real time PCR arrays, microarrays or next generation sequencing of biologic materials (e.g., blood, serum or blood components such as platelets). PCA identified the top three principal components that distinguished cohorts of patients with specific diseases (e.g., heart disease, stroke, hypertension, sepsis, diabetes, specific types of cancer, HIV, hemophilia, subtypes of meningitis, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, mild cognitive impairment, aging, and autism), from healthy subjects. Literature searches verified the functional relevance of the discriminating miRNAs. Our goal is to assemble PCA and heatmap analyses of existing and future blood miRNA datasets into a clinical reference database to facilitate the diagnosis of diseases using routine blood draws."
https://openalex.org/W3034043436,"Like other crop species, barley, the fourth most important crop worldwide, suffers from the genetic bottleneck effect, where further improvements in performance through classical breeding methods become difficult. Therefore, indirect selection methods are of great interest. Here, genomic prediction (GP) based on 33,005 SNP markers and, alternatively, metabolic prediction (MP) based on 128 metabolites with sampling at two different time points in one year, were applied to predict multi-year agronomic traits in the nested association mapping (NAM) population HEB-25. We found prediction abilities of up to 0.93 for plant height with SNP markers and of up to 0.61 for flowering time with metabolites. Interestingly, prediction abilities in GP increased after reducing the number of incorporated SNP markers. The estimated effects of GP and MP were highly concordant, indicating MP as an interesting alternative to GP, being able to reflect a stable genotype-specific metabolite profile. In MP, sampling at an early developmental stage outperformed sampling at a later stage. The results confirm the value of GP for future breeding. With MP, an interesting alternative was also applied successfully. However, based on our results, usage of MP alone cannot be recommended in barley. Nevertheless, MP can assist in unravelling physiological pathways for the expression of agronomically important traits."
https://openalex.org/W3033615163,"Background Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy including pre-eclampsia are associated with maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity. Early detection is vital for effective treatment and management of pre-eclampsia. This study examines and compares the clinical presentation and outcomes between early- and late-onset pre-eclampsia over a two year period. Methods A retrospective cohort study design which examines socio-demographic characteristics, treatment, outcomes, and fetal and maternal complications among women with early onset of pre-eclampsia (EO-PE) and late onset of pre-eclampsia (LO-PE). De-identified records of women who attended antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal care services and experienced pre-eclampsia at Kenyatta National teaching and referral hospital were reviewed. We used chi square, t-test, and calculated odds ratio to determine any significant differences between the EO-PE and LO-PE cohorts. Results Out of 620 pre-eclamptic and eclamptic patients’ records analyzed; 44 percent (n = 273) exhibited EO-PE, while 56 percent had late onset. Women with EO-PE compared to LO-PE had greater odds of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes including hemolysis elevated liver enzymes and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome (OR: 4.3; CI 2.0–10.2; p<0.001), renal dysfunction (OR; 1.7; CI 0.7–4.1; p = 0.192), stillbirth (OR = 4.9; CI 3.1–8.1; p<0.001), and neonatal death (OR: 8.5; CI 3.8–21.3; p<0.001). EO-PE was also associated with higher odds of prolonged maternal hospitalization, beyond seven days (OR = 5.8; CI 3.9–8.4; p<0.001), and antepartum hemorrhage (OR = 5.8; CI 1.1–56.4; p<0.001). Neonates born after early onset of pre-eclampsia had increased odds of respiratory distress (OR = 17.0; CI 9.0–32.3, p<0.001) and birth asphyxia (OR: 1.9; CI 0.7–4.8; p = 0.142). Conclusions The profiles and outcomes of women with EO-PE (compared to late onset) suggest that seriousness of morbidity increases with earlier onset. To reduce adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes, it is critical to identify, manage, referral and closely follow-up pregnant women with pre-eclampsia throughout the pregnancy continuum.

https://openalex.org/W3033683581,"Clinical decision-making is a complex process influenced by clinical and non-clinical factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between provider, patient, and practice factors with clinical decision-making among dentists in Ontario, Canada’s most populated province and its largest dental care market. This was a cross-sectional, self-administered survey of a random sample of general dentists in Ontario (n = 3,201). The 46-item survey collected demographic, professional, and practice information. The outcome (treatment intensity) was measured using a set of clinical scenarios, which categorized dentists as either relatively aggressive or conservative in their treatment decisions. Associations were assessed using bivariate analysis and logistic regressions. One thousand and seventy-five dentists responded (33.6% response rate). Age (p = 0.001), place of initial training (p<0.001), number of dependents (p = 0.001), number of hygienists employed (p = 0.001), and perceptions of practice loans (p = 0.020) were associated with treatment intensity. Dentists who were <40-years old (OR = 2.06, 95% CI:1.39–3.06, p<0.001), American-trained (OR = 2.48, 95% CI:1.51–4.06, p<0.001), and perceived their practice loans as large (OR = 1.57, 95% CI:1.02–2.42, p = 0.039), were relatively more aggressive in their treatment decisions. Various non-clinical factors appear to influence the clinical decision-making of dentists in Ontario."
https://openalex.org/W3033073370,"Coelacanths are iconic fishes represented today by a single marine genus. The group was a little bit more diversified in the Mesozoic, with representatives in marine and continental environments in the Late Cretaceous. Here we describe isolated skull bones of the last know freshwater coelacanths found in several fossil sites from the Early Campanian to the Early Maastrichtian of Southern France (in the Departments of Aude, Bouches-du-Rhône, Hérault, and Var). The sample does not allow distinguishing different species, and all material is referred to Axelrodichthys megadromos Cavin, Valentin, Garcia originally described from the locality of Ventabren in Southern France. A reconstruction of the skull is proposed. Previously unrecognized features are described, including parts of the postparietal portion of the skull, of the suspensorium and of the mandible. The new data confirm the assignation of the species to the mawsoniids, and more specifically to Axelrodichthys. A cladistic analysis scoring new character states provides a similar topology than a previous analysis, i.e. A. megadromos is placed in a polytomy with Axelrodichthys araripensis and Lualabaea lerichei, two species from the Early Cretaceous of Brazil and from the Late Jurassic of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, respectively. A. megadromos appears to have been restricted to freshwater environments, to the contrary of oldest Western Gondwanan representatives of the family that were able to live in brackish and marine waters. A. megadromos is the last representative of the mawsoniids and its occurrence in Europe is probably the result of a dispersal event from Western Gondwana that happened somewhen in the Cretaceous. Based on the available data, the mawsoniids went extinct in the mid-Maastrichthian, i.e. before the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. But it is possible that the fossil record of this family, which has been only recently recognized in Late Cretaceous European deposits, will geographically and stratigraphically widen with further discoveries."
https://openalex.org/W3033215358,"Neuropeptide FF (NPFF) is well-known for its roles in the central nervous system. Despite studies demonstrating that NPFF receptor 2 (NPFFR2) mRNA is highest in placenta, nothing is known about NPFF-NPFFR2 functions in placental development. Here, we investigated the effects of NPFF-NPFFR2 on expression of syncytial [human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) β] and fusogenic [syncytin 1, syncytin 2, and glial cells missing 1 (GCM1)] genes in first trimester primary human cytotrophoblast cells. By analyzing two publicly available microarray data sets, we found that NPFF is consistently expressed throughout gestation whereas NPFFR2 increases in first trimester and is elevated in placenta samples from women with preeclampsia. Immunohistochemistry showed that NPFFR2, syncytin 1/2, and GCM1 each displayed unique patterns of expression among different trophoblast populations in first trimester placenta. Treatment of primary human cytotrophoblast cells with NPFF increased the mRNA and protein levels of hCG β, syncytin 1, syncytin 2, and GCM1; and knockdown of NPFFR2 abolished these effects. Interestingly, GCM1 mediated NPFF-induced upregulation of syncytin 1 and syncytin 2, but not hCG β, in primary human cytotrophoblasts. Our results demonstrate that NPFF acts via NPFFR2 to enhance production of hCG β and promote GCM1-dependent expression of syncytin 1 and 2 in human cytotrophoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W3033239582,"Objective To determine whether neighbourhood socioeconomic status (SES) was associated with large for gestational age (LGA) while considering key sociodemographic and clinical confounding factors. Setting and patient All singleton infants whose parents were living in the city of Marseilles, France, between 2013 and 2016. Method Population-based study based on new-born hospital birth admission charts from the French National Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set Database. LGA infants were compared to appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) infants. Multiple generalized logistic model analysis was used to examine factors associated with LGA. Results A total of 43,309 singleton infants were included, and 4,747 (11%) were born LGA. LGA infants were more likely to have metabolic and respiratory diseases and to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Multiparity, advanced maternal age, obesity and diabetes were associated with an increased risk of LGA. Lower neighbourhood SES was associated with LGA (aOR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.14; 1.36; p<0.0001) independent of age, diabetes, obesity, maternal smoking and multiparity. The strength of this association increased with maternal age, reaching an aOR of 1.50 (95% CI: 1.26; 1.78; p<0.0001) for women > 35 years old. Conclusion Neighbourhood SES could be considered an important factor for clinicians to better identify mothers at risk of having LGA births in addition to well-known risk factors such as maternal diabetes, obesity and age. The intensification of the association between SES and LGA with increasing maternal age suggests that neighbourhood disadvantage may act on LGA cumulatively over time."
https://openalex.org/W3033091354,"Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus, symbiotically associated with entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs), produce a range of antimicrobial compounds. The objective of this study is to identify Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus and their EPNs hosts, which were isolated from soil samples from Saraburi province, and study their antibacterial activity against 15 strains of drug-resistant bacteria. Fourteen isolates (6.1%), consisting of six Xenorhabdus isolates and eight Photorhabdus isolates, were obtained from 230 soil samples. Based on the BLASTN search incorporating the phylogenetic analysis of a partial recA gene, all six isolates of Xenorhabdus were found to be identical and closely related to X. stockiae. Five isolates of Photorhabdus were found to be identical and closely related to P. luminescens subsp. akhurstii. Two isolates of Photorhabdus were found to be identical and closely related to P. luminescens subsp. hainanensis. The remaining isolate of Photorhabdus was found to be identical to P. asymbiotica subsp. australis. The bacterial extracts from P. luminescens subsp. akhurstii showed strong inhibition the growth of S. aureus strain PB36 (MSRA) by disk diffusion, minimal inhibitory concentration, and minimal bactericidal concentration assay. The combination between each extract from Xenorhabdus/Photorhabdus and oxacillin or vancomycin against S. aureus strain PB36 (MRSA) exhibited no interaction on checkerboard assay. Moreover, killing curve assay of P. luminescens subsp. akhurstii extracts against S. aureus strain PB36 exhibited a steady reduction of 105 CFU/ml to 103 CFU/ml within 30 min. This study demonstrates that Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus, showed antibacterial activity. This finding may be useful for further research on antibiotic production."
https://openalex.org/W3033615442,"Background Perinatal depression (PND) can interfere with HIV care engagement and outcomes. We examined experiences of PND among women living with HIV (WLWH) in Malawi. Methods We screened 73 WLWH presenting for perinatal care in Lilongwe, Malawi using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). We conducted qualitative interviews with 24 women experiencing PND and analyzed data using inductive and deductive coding and narrative analysis. Results Women experienced a double burden of physical and mental illness, expressed as pain in one’s heart. Receiving an HIV diagnosis unexpectedly during antenatal care was a key contributor to developing PND. This development was influenced by stigmatization and social support. Conclusions These findings highlight the need to recognize the mental health implications of routine screening for HIV and to routinely screen and treat PND among WLWH. Culturally appropriate mental health interventions are needed in settings with a high HIV burden."
https://openalex.org/W3033667675,"Background Diabetes triples the risk of developing tuberculosis (TB). This study was designed to determine the prevalence of past and current TB disease and Latent TB infection (LTBI) in type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM) patients. Design This was a prospective descriptive study on all NIDDM patients attending a Diabetic clinic. Detailed history, included details of previous history of TB (Past TB)and symptoms of active TB and a thorough physical exam was also done. When clinical suspicion of TB was present, appropriate investigations were carried out to diagnose ‘Current TB’. Subsequently, 200 consecutive patients who were negative for Past and Current TB were screened for Latent TB infection (LTBI) by tuberculin skin test. Results Of 1000 NIDDM patients enrolled, 43(4.3%) had Past TB. Of remaining 957 patients, 50 were evaluated for New TB on the basis of suggestive symptoms and 10(1%) patients were confirmed to have Current TB. Risk factors for Past or Current TB ‘DM-TB’ in comparison with ‘DM Only’ group were; male sex (72% VS 57%; P = 0.033), manual laborer (28% VS 15%; P = 0.012), smoking (26% VS 14%; P = 0.015), alcohol consumption (23% VS 9%; P<0.001)& being on treatment with Insulin (40% VS 20%; P<0.001). There was a protective effect with being a home maker (17% VS 37%; P = 0.034&overweightstatus (53% VS 71%; P = 0.004). Of the 200 patient without Past or Current TB, who were screened for LTBI, 96(48%) patients were found to have LTBI. Male sex was the only significant risk factor for LTBI (72% VS 59%; P = 0.05). Conclusion Past and Current TB was substantial in patients attending a Diabetic Clinic. Active symptom screening for TB in these clinics could lead to increase in case detection and earlier diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3033226313,"Nitrogen (N) isotopic discrimination (i.e. the difference in natural 15N abundance between the animal proteins and the diet; Δ15N) is known to correlate with N use efficiency (NUE) and feed conversion efficiency (FCE) in ruminants. However, results from the literature are not always consistent across studies, likely due to isotopic discrimination pathways that may differ with the nature of diets. The objective of the present study was to assess at which level, from rumen to tissues, Δ15N originates and becomes related to NUE and FCE in fattening yearling bulls when they are fed two contrasted diets. Twenty-four Charolais yearling bulls were randomly divided into two groups and fed during 8 months, from weaning to slaughter, either 1) a high starch diet based on corn silage supplying a balanced N to energy ratio at the rumen level (starch) or 2) a high fiber diet based on grass silage supplying an excess of rumen degradable N (fiber). All animals were slaughtered and samples of different digestive pools (ruminal, duodenal, ileal and fecal contents), animal tissues (duodenum, liver and muscle), blood and urine were collected for each animal. Ruminal content was further used to isolate liquid-associated bacteria (LAB), protozoa and free ammonia, while plasma proteins were obtained from blood. All samples along with feed were analyzed for their N isotopic composition. For both diets, the digestive contribution (i.e. the N isotopic discrimination occurring before absorption) to the Δ15N observed in animal tissues accounted for 65 ± 11%, leaving only one third to the contribution of post-absorptive metabolism. Concerning the Δ15N in digestive pools, the majority of these changes occurred in the rumen (av. Δ15N = 2.12 ± 0.66‰), with only minor 15N enrichments thereafter (av. Δ15N = 2.24 ± 0.41‰), highlighting the key role of the rumen on N isotopic discrimination. A strong, significant overall relationship (n = 24) between Δ15N and FCE or NUE was found when using any post-absorptive metabolic pool (duodenum, liver, or muscle tissues, or plasma proteins; 0.52 < r < 0.73; P ≤ 0.01), probably as these pools reflect both digestive and post-absorptive metabolic phenomena. Fiber diet compared to starch diet had a lower feed efficiency and promoted higher (P ≤ 0.05) Δ15N values across all post-absorptive metabolic pools and some digestive pools (ruminal, duodenal, and ileal contents). The within-diet relationship (n = 12) between Δ15N and feed efficiency was not as strong and consistent as the overall relationship, with contrasted responses between the two diets for specific pools (diet x pool interaction; P ≤ 0.01). Our results highlight the contrasted use of N at the rumen level between the two experimental diets and suggests the need for different equations to predict FCE or NUE from Δ15N according to the type of diet. In conclusion, rumen digestion and associated microbial activity can play an important role on N isotopic discrimination so rumen effect related to diet may interfere with the relationship between Δ15N and feed efficiency in fattening yearling bulls."
https://openalex.org/W3033570190,"Introduction An acute shortage of senior mentors saw the Palliative Medicine Initiative (PMI) combine its novice mentoring program with electronic and peer mentoring to overcome insufficient mentoring support of medical students and junior doctors by senior clinicians. A three-phased evaluation was carried out to evaluate mentees’ experiences within the new CNEP mentoring program. Methods Phase 1 saw use of a Delphi process to create a content-valid questionnaire from data drawn from 9 systematic reviews of key aspects of novice mentoring. In Phase 2 Cognitive Interviews were used to evaluate the tool. The tool was then piloted amongst mentees in the CNEP program. Phase 3 compared mentee’s experiences in the CNEP program with those from the PMI’s novice mentoring program. Results Thematic analysis of open-ended responses revealed three themes–the CNEP mentoring process, its benefits and challenges that expound on the descriptive statistical analysis of specific close-ended and Likert scale responses of the survey. The results show mentee experiences in the PMI’s novice mentoring program and the CNEP program to be similar and that the addition of near peer and e-mentoring processes enhance communications and support of mentees. Conclusion CNEP mentoring is an evolved form of novice mentoring built on a consistent mentoring approach supported by an effective host organization. The host organization marshals assessment, support and oversight of the program and allows flexibility within the approach to meet the particular needs of mentees, mentors and senior mentors. Whilst near-peer mentors and e-mentoring can make up for the lack of senior mentor availability, their effectiveness hinges upon a common mentoring approach. To better support the CNEP program deeper understanding of the mentoring dynamics, policing and mentor and mentee training processes are required. The CNEP mentoring tool too needs to be validated."
https://openalex.org/W3033088085,"Background Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) has become one of the most important infectious diseases recent years. Qingdao City has suffered from serious HFMD epidemic. This study aimed to describe epidemiological characteristics and investigate spatial-temporal distribution at town level in Qingdao City. Method The surveillance data of HFMD during 2013–2018 were collected from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System. The global Moran’s I statistic was used to detect the spatial autocorrelation of HFMD cases by ArcGis 10.0 software. Purely spatial and spatial-temporal analysis was used to detect epidemic clusters by SatScanTM v9.6 software. Results The annual average incidence of HFMD cases in Qingdao City from 2013 to 2018 was 123.16 per 100000, while the incidence rate of children≤5years old was 2879.80 per 100000. The majority (88.97%) of HFMD cases were aged within 0–5 years old and the males were 60.20%. Other enterovirus (EV), enteriovirus 71(EV71), and Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) accounted for 48.75%, 30.91% and 20.34%. The seasonal peak was between May and October. HFMD had positive spatial autocorrelation at town level with global Moran’s I from 0.19 to 0.31(P<0.001). Spatial-temporal cluster analysis detected six most likely clusters and three secondary clusters from 2013 to 2018. The most likely cluster was located in urban and urban-rural fringe areas. Conclusions Urban and urban-rural fringe areas were the major locations of the clusters with other EV as the dominant pathogen between May and October. The findings suggested that the prevention and control of HFMD in Qingdao City should be focus on these high-risk periods and locations which had important public health significance for the allocation of public health resources."
https://openalex.org/W3033024045,"Leptospirosis is a worldwide emerging zoonotic disease caused by Leptospira species, that in some patients develop severe forms with high mortality. In France, Corsica is the area where the highest incidences have been reported. The present study was focused on the analysis of pathogenic Leptospira species in rodents of Corsica, as these micromammals are the main natural reservoirs of the bacteria, in order to identify the circulating species and to locate possible risk focuses of transmission, as no previous study on the presence of Leptospira species has been carried out in the island. Rattus rattus, Rattus norvegicus, Apodemus sylvaticus and Mus musculus domesticus were captured in the proximity of water sources along Corsica, the detection of pathogenic Leptospira species was carried out by amplification of the LipL32 gene. The bacteria were found in all the rodent species analyzed and widely. The general prevalence was 10.4%, reaching the maximum value in Bastia (45%). Leptospira interrogans and Leptospira borgpetersenii were identified by phylogenetic analysis, but also two sequences which corresponded to an unnamed Leptospira species, only previously found in rodents of New Caledonia. The high incidence of human leptospirosis in Corsica could be partially explained by the wide distribution of pathogenic Leptospira species identified in this study. Also, the presence of an unknown pathogenic species of Leptospira in an area with high prevalence, may be involved in the higher incidence of Leptospirosis in this island, however, the zoonotic capacity of this species remains unknown. The results obtained are interesting for public health since all positive samples were found near water sources and one of the routes of transmission of leptospirosis is contact with contaminated water. This information could help the competent entities to take preventive measures, reducing the incidence of human leptospirosis in Corsica."
https://openalex.org/W3033728358,"The literature on the global burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) contrasts a spiraling epidemic centered in low-income countries with low levels of awareness, risk factor control, infrastructure, personnel and funding. There are few data-based reports of broad and interconnected strategies to address these challenges where they hit hardest. Kisoro district in Southwest Uganda is rural, remote, over-populated and poor, the majority of its population working as subsistence farmers. This paper describes the 10-year experience of a tri-partite collaboration between Kisoro District Hospital, a New York teaching hospital, and a US-based NGO delivering hypertension services to the district. Using data from patient and pharmacy registers and a random sample of charts reviewed manually, we describe both common and often-overlooked barriers to quality care (clinic overcrowding, drug stockouts, provider shortages, visit non-adherence, and uninformative medical records) and strategies adopted to address these barriers (locally-adapted treatment guidelines, patient-clinic-pharmacy cost sharing, appointment systems, workforce development, patient-provider continuity initiatives, and ongoing data monitoring). We find that: 1) although following CVD risk-based treatment guidelines could safely allocate scarce medications to the highest-risk patients first, national guidelines emphasizing treatment at blood pressures over 140/90 mmHg ignore the reality of “stockouts” and conflict with this goal; 2) often-overlooked barriers to quality care such as poor quality medical records, clinic disorganization and local employment practices are surmountable; 3) cost-sharing initiatives partially fill the gap during stockouts of government supplied medications, but still may be insufficient for the poorest patients; 4) frequent prolonged lapses in care may be the norm for most known hypertensives in rural SSA, and 5) ongoing data monitoring can identify local barriers to quality care and provide the impetus to ameliorate them. We anticipate that our 10-year experience adapting to the complex challenges of hypertension management and a granular description of the solutions we devised will be of benefit to others managing chronic disease in similar rural African communities."
https://openalex.org/W3033883009,"In this paper, Response Surface Methodology with central composite design (RSM/CCD) was used to optimize a modified electrode for improved electron transfer rate and electrochemical performance. The modification was done on a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) with reduced graphene oxide (ERGO)/calix [4] arene (ERGOC4-SPCE). The properties of the modified electrodes were analyzed via cyclic voltammetry, Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier-Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Then, different variables were optimized, namely, the concentration of graphene oxide, GO (A), the number of scan cycles of graphene oxide (B), and the deposition time (C). The effect of the optimized variables on the reduction-oxidation peak current response of the potassium ferricyanide redox system was analyzed. By using statistical analysis, it shows a significant effect of the concentration of GO, the deposition time, and the number of scans cycles on the peak current response. The coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.9987 produced indicated a good fit of the model with experimental finding."
https://openalex.org/W3033205657,"Circulating plasma TRAIL levels are suppressed in patients with cardiovascular and diabetic diseases. To identify novel targets in vascular metabolic diseases, genome-wide transcriptome of aortic tissue from Trail-/- versus Trail+/+ mice were interrogated. We found 861 genes differentially expressed with TRAIL deletion. Gene enrichment analyses showed many of these genes were related to inflammation, cell-to-cell cytoskeletal interactions, and transcriptional modulation. We identified vascular protective and pathological gene clusters, with Ifi205 as the most significantly reduced vascular protective gene, whereas Glut1, the most significantly increased pathological gene with TRAIL deletion. We hypothesized that therapeutic targets could be devised from such integrated analysis and validated our findings from vascular tissues of diabetic mice. From the differentially expressed gene targets, enriched transcription factor (TF) and microRNA binding motifs were identified. The top two TFs were Elk1 and Sp1, with enrichment to eight gene targets common to both. miR-520d-3p and miR-377-3p were the top enriched microRNAs with TRAIL deletion; with four overlapping genes enriched for both microRNAs. Our findings offer an alternate in silico approach for therapeutic target identification and present a deeper understanding of gene signatures and pathways altered with TRAIL suppression in the vasculature."

This study included Dry Eye Workshop Study (DEWS) Grade 3-4 dry eye participants (n = 31) whose tear break-up time (TBUT) was ≤5 seconds(s). Participants were randomized to undergo treatment with either bevacizumab 0.05% eye drops (n = 19) or placebo (n = 12). The primary outcome was TBUT, and the proportion of responders (increase of ≥3s in TBUT at week 12), ocular surface disease index (OSDI) score, Schirmer test, and Oxford scheme grade were secondary outcomes. All outcomes were measured at 1-, 4- and 12 weeks. TBUT in bevacizumab group differed significantly from TBUT in placebo group within 12 weeks (P = 0.001). Moreover, the improvement of TBUT in bevacizumab group versus placebo group at 4- and 12 weeks differed significantly from that difference at baseline (P = 0.002 and P = 0.003, respectively). The proportion of participants achieving increase of 3 seconds or more of TBUT at week 12 in the bevacizumab group was significantly greater than that in the placebo group (P = 0.02). Oxford scheme grade at 1-, 4- and 12 weeks differed significantly from the values at baseline in bevacizumab group (P = 0.001, P = 0.01, and P = 0.03, respectively). OSDI scores at 1-, 4- and 12-week follow-ups were significantly lower than that at baseline in bevacizumab group (P<0.001 at each follow-up). Schirmer test were not significantly different within or between groups (the lowest P = 0.92). No adverse events occurred in this study. Patients treated with bevacizumab 0.05% eye drops showed significant improvement in tear film stability, corneal staining and symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3033442652,"The relationship between age and well-being is U-shaped. One recent explanation for this empirical pattern is related to unmet aspirations theory, pointing out that optimism bias decreases life satisfaction at younger ages, whereas pessimism bias increases it at later stages of life. This paper investigates the effects of Internet use on subjective well-being over the life cycle. Our model investigates the proposition that Internet use affects aspirations, and that this effect is relatively stronger at younger and older ages. To investigate moderation effects of Internet use on the U-shape of life, we use the Eurobarometer annual surveys for the years 2010 to 2016, which provide rich information for around 150,000 individuals in all European countries. We focus on the EU Digital Agenda policy program, and exploit exogenous variation in broadband Internet take-up across European countries to identify the causal effects of Internet on life satisfaction for different age groups. The results of 2SLS estimations for a recursive bivariate ordered probit model show that active Internet users have a different well-being pattern over the life cycle compared to less active users. Specifically, we find that Internet use makes the U-shape of life steeper. Country-level evidence on aspiration levels for different demographic and Internet user groups indicates that our empirical results are consistent with unmet aspirations theory."
https://openalex.org/W3033890711,"Loss of retinoblastoma (RB) function in the cone cells during retina development is necessary but not sufficient for retinoblastoma development. It has been reported that in the absence of RB activity, a retinoma is generated, and the onset of retina cancer occurs until the p53 pathway is altered. Unlike other types of cancer, in retinoblastoma the p53 tumour suppressor is mostly wild type, although its two primary regulators, MDMX and MDM2, are commonly dysregulated. A mutated RB form is inherited in around 35% of the cases, but normally two, somatic mutations are needed to alter the RB function. Here we investigated the mRNA levels of RB, p53, MDMX and MDM2 in peripheral blood samples of retinoblastoma patients to monitor the pathway status of p53 in somatic cells. We sought to investigate the involvement of these genes in the development of retina cancer, with the aim of identifying biomarkers for early diagnosis of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W3033077168,"Regularity of acoustic rhythms allows predicting a target embedded within a stream thereby improving detection performance and reaction times in spectral detection tasks. In two experiments we examine whether temporal regularity enhances perceptual sensitivity and reduces reaction times using a temporal shift detection task. Participants detected temporal shifts embedded at different positions within a sequence of quintet–sounds. Narrowband quintets were centered around carrier frequencies of 200 Hz, 1100 Hz, or 3100 Hz and presented at presentation rates between 1–8 Hz. We compared rhythmic sequences to control conditions where periodicity was reduced or absent and tested whether perceptual benefits depend on the presentation rate, the spectral content of the sounds, and task difficulty. We found that (1) the slowest rate (1 Hz) led to the largest behavioral effect on sensitivity. (2) This sensitivity improvement is carrier-dependent, such that the largest improvement is observed for low-frequency (200 Hz) carriers compared to 1100 Hz and 3100 Hz carriers. (3) Moreover, we show that the predictive value of a temporal cue and that of a temporal rhythm similarly affect perceptual sensitivity. That is, both the cue and the rhythm induce confident temporal expectancies in contrast to an aperiodic rhythm, and thereby allow to effectively prepare and allocate attentional resources in time. (4) Lastly, periodic stimulation reduces reaction times compared to aperiodic stimulation, both at perceptual threshold as well as above threshold. Similarly, a temporal cue allowed participants to optimally prepare and thereby respond fastest. Overall, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that periodicity leads to optimized predictions and processing of forthcoming input and thus to behavioral benefits. Predictable temporally cued sounds provide a similar perceptual benefit to periodic rhythms, despite an additional uncertainty of target position within periodic sequences. Several neural mechanisms may underlie our findings, including the entrainment of oscillatory activity of neural populations."
https://openalex.org/W3033424107,"Diabetic animal models have made significant contributions to understanding the etiology of diabetes and to the development of new medications. Our research group recently developed a novel diabetic mouse strain, the insulin hyposecretion (ihs)mouse. The strain involves neither obesity nor insulitis but exhibits notable pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, distinguishing it from other well-characterized animal models. In ihs mice, severe impairment of insulin secretion from pancreas has been elicited by glucose or potassium chloride stimulation. To clarify the genetic basis of impaired insulin secretion, beginning with identifying the causative gene, genetic linkage analysis was performed using [(C57BL/6 × ihs) F1 × ihs] backcross progeny. Genetic linkage analysis and quantitative trait loci analysis for blood glucose after oral glucose loading indicated that a recessively acting locus responsible for impaired glucose tolerance was mapped to a 14.9-Mb region of chromosome 18 between D18Mit233 and D18Mit235 (the ihs locus). To confirm the gene responsible for the ihs locus, a congenic strain harboring the ihs locus on the C57BL/6 genetic background was developed. Phenotypic analysis of B6.ihs-(D18Mit233-D18Mit235) mice showed significant glucose tolerance impairment and markedly lower plasma insulin levels during an oral glucose tolerance test. Whole-genome sequencing and Sanger sequencing analyses on the ihs genome detected two ihs-specific variants changing amino acids within the ihs locus; both variants in Slc25a46 and Tcerg1 were predicted to disrupt the protein function. Based on information regarding gene functions involving diabetes mellitus and insulin secretion, reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the relative abundance of Reep2 and Sil1 transcripts from ihs islets was significantly decreased whereas that of Syt4 transcripts were significantly increased compared with those of control C57BL/6 mice. Thus, Slc25a46, Tcerg1, Syt4, Reep2 and Sil1 are potential candidate genes for the ihs locus. This will be the focus of future studies in both mice and humans."
https://openalex.org/W3033694744,"Aim Personality Disorders (PD) often share clinical and phenomenological overlap with psychotic disorders, especially at onset. However, there is little research on comorbid PD among people experiencing first episode psychosis. We examined the prevalence of PD recording and its sociodemographic and clinical correlates in people accepted to Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) services. Methods Participants were aged 16–35, accepted into 6 EIP services for suspected psychosis, as part of the Social Epidemiology of Psychoses in East Anglia (SEPEA) study. PD was recorded by clinicians according to ICD-10. Multilevel logistic regression was performed. Results Of 798 participants, 76 people (9.5%) received a clinical diagnosis of PD, with emotionally unstable PD (75.0%, N = 57) the most common subtype. In multivariable analysis, risk factors for PD included female sex (odds ratio [OR]: 3.4; 95% CI: 2.0–5.7), absence of psychotic disorder after acceptance to EIP (OR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.6–5.5), more severe hallucinations (OR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.2–2.1), and lower parental SES (OR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1–1.8). Compared with the white British, black and minority ethnic groups were less likely to receive a PD diagnosis (OR: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1–0.7). There was no association between PD and neighbourhood-level deprivation or population-density. Conclusions Recording of a PD diagnosis was three times more common amongst participants later found not to meet threshold criteria for psychotic disorder, implying phenomenological overlap at referral which highlights difficulties encountered in accurate diagnostic assessment, treatment and onward referral. People with PD experienced more individual-level, but not neighbourhood-level social disadvantage in an already disadvantaged sample."
https://openalex.org/W3033803128,"Metabolic changes in sulfatides and other sulfated glycans have been related to various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the importance of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in sulfated lysosomal substrate metabolism and its related disorders is currently unknown. We investigated the effects of deficiency or supplementation of PUFA on the metabolism of sulfatides and sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAGs) in sulfatide-rich organs (brain and kidney) of mice. A PUFA-deficient diet for over 5 weeks significantly reduced the sulfatide expression by increasing the sulfatide degradative enzymes arylsulfatase A and galactosylceramidase in brain and kidney. This sulfatide degradation was clearly associated with the activation of autophagy and lysosomal hyperfunction, the former of which was induced by suppression of the Erk/mTOR pathway. A PUFA-deficient diet also activated the degradation of sGAGs in the brain and kidney and that of amyloid precursor proteins in the brain, indicating an involvement in general lysosomal function and the early developmental process of AD. PUFA supplementation prevented all of the above abnormalities. Taken together, a PUFA deficiency might lead to sulfatide and sGAG degradation associated with autophagy activation and general lysosomal hyperfunction and play a role in many types of disease development, suggesting a possible benefit of prophylactic PUFA supplementation."
https://openalex.org/W3033385652,"This paper employs a solution to the agent-guidance problem in an environment with obstacles, whose avoidance techniques have been extensively used in the last years. There is still a gap between the solution times required to obtain a trajectory and those demanded by real world applications. These usually face a tradeoff between the limited on-board processing performance and the high volume of computing operations demanded by those real-time applications. In this paper we propose a deferred decision-based technique that produces clusters used for obstacle avoidance as the agent moves in the environment, like a driver that, at night, enlightens the road ahead as her/his car moves along a highway. By considering the spatial and temporal relevance of each obstacle throughout the planning process and pruning areas that belong to the constrained domain, one may relieve the inherent computational burden of avoidance. This strategy reduces the number of operations required and increases it on demand, since a computationally heavier problem is tackled only if the simpler ones are not feasible. It consists in an improvement based solely on problem modeling, which, by example, may offer processing times in the same order of magnitude than the lower-bound given by the relaxed form of the problem."
https://openalex.org/W3033203506,"Different techniques have been applied in feed processing to improve ruminal degradation and nutrient utilization in ruminant. There are limited studies investigating how moist heating process impacts barley protein utilization and internal molecular structures. The objectives of this study were to investigate: 1) how moist heating affects barley protein chemical profiles and Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS) subfractions, in situ rumen degradation parameters, and predicted intestinal protein supply and feed milk value; 2) how moist heating affects protein molecular spectral features; and 3) the relationship between protein molecular structure spectral features and protein chemical profiles and metabolic characteristics. The barley variety CDC cowboy samples collected from the research farm during two consecutive years were used. Half of each sample was kept as raw and the other half underwent moist heating. The advanced molecular spectroscopy (attenuated total reflectance-fourier transform infrared, ATR-FTIR) was used to detect the barley protein molecular structure spectral features. It was found that moist heating decreased the fractions of soluble protein and increased the moderately degradable protein and ingestible protein fractions. This further resulted in the changes of in situ rumen degradation parameters and intestinal protein digestion characteristics. The protein molecular structure spectral features detected by using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy can be used as potential predictors for protein related chemical and metabolic parameters."
https://openalex.org/W3033825975,"Hop (Humulus lupulus L.) is known for its use as a bittering agent in beer and has a rich history of cultivation, beginning in Europe and now spanning the globe. There are five wild varieties worldwide, which may have been introgressed with cultivated varieties. As a dioecious species, its obligate outcrossing, non-Mendelian inheritance, and genomic structural variability have confounded directed breeding efforts. Consequently, understanding the hop genome represents a considerable challenge, requiring additional resources. In order to facilitate investigations into the transmission genetics of hop, we report here a tandem repeat discovery pipeline developed using k-mer filtering and dot plot analysis of PacBio long-read sequences from the hop cultivar Apollo. From this we identified 17 new and distinct tandem repeat sequence families, which represent candidates for FISH probe development. For two of these candidates, HuluTR120 and HuluTR225, we produced oligonucleotide FISH probes from conserved regions of and demonstrated their utility by staining meiotic chromosomes from wild hop, var. neomexicanus to address, for example, questions about hop transmission genetics. Collectively, these tandem repeat sequence families represent new resources suitable for development of additional cytogenomic tools for hop research."
https://openalex.org/W3032941732,"In the field of advertising technology, it is a key task to forecast posterior click distribution since 66% of advertising transactions depend on cost per click model. However, due to the General Data Protection Regulation, machine learning techniques to forecast posterior click distribution based on the sequences of an identified user's actions are restricted in European countries. To overcome this barrier, we introduce a contextual behavior concept for the advertising network environment and propose a new hybrid model, which we call the Long Short Term Memory-Hawkes model by combining a stochastic-based generative model and a machine learning-based predictive model. Also, to meet the computational efficiency for the heavy demand in mobile advertisement market, we define gradient exponential kernel with just three hyper parameters to minimize residuals. We have carefully tested our proposed model with production data and found that the LSTM-Hawkes model reduces the Mean Squared Error by at least 27.1% and up to 83.8% on average in comparison to the existing Hawkes Process based algorithm, Hawkes Intensity Process, as well as 39.77% on average in comparison to Multivariate Linear Regression. We have also found that our proposed model improves the forecast accuracy by about 21.2% on average."
