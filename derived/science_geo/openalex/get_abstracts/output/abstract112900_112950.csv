https://openalex.org/W1504784308,"Abstract Accumulating evidence suggests a critical role of intracellular glutathione in tumor cell resistance to alkylating agents. The present study provides evidence for the direct interaction between cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin) and glutathione (GSH) both in a cell-free system, as well as in L1210 murine leukemia cells. We have isolated the reaction product and identified it by a combination of high performance liquid chromatography and atomic absorption spectroscopy. Stoichiometric analysis showed a 2:1 molar ratio of GSH/cisplatin for the reaction. The molecular mass assessed by mass spectroscopy was 809 Da, corresponding to a GS-platinum chelate complex, bis-(glutathionato)-platinum. The GS-platinum complex was detected in L1210 leukemia cells incubated with 20 microM cisplatin. The intracellular content of the GS-platinum complex reached a maximal level after 12 h, corresponding to about 60% of the intracellular platinum content. Thus, formation of the GS-platinum complex is considered a significant part of the cellular metabolism of cisplatin. The GS-platinum was found to inhibit cell-free protein synthesis in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system using both chloramphenicol acetyltransferase mRNA and poly(A) mRNA from HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells (IC50 = 190 microM the GS-platinum complex). Elimination of the GS-platinum complex from tumor cells may represent an important mechanism which reduces the intracellular accumulation of the platinum complex. Using plasma membrane vesicles prepared from L1210 cells, the transport of the GS-platinum complex across the plasma membrane was found to be an ATP-dependent process (apparent Km values: 49 microM, ATP; 110 microM, GS-platinum complex). The ATP-dependent transport of the GS-platinum complex was inhibited by vanadate (IC50 = 35 microM) as well as by S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-glutathione, leukotriene C4, and GSSG, but not by doxorubicin, daunorubicin, or verapamil. The ATP-dependent glutathione S-conjugate export pump, GS-X pump (Ishikawa, T. (1992) Trends Biochem. Sci. 17, 463-468), is suggested to play a role in the elimination of the GS-platinum complex from tumor cells."

https://openalex.org/W1572814792,"It is generally accepted that the multiple, similar protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes are responsible for different specialized physiological processes, but evidence that directly assigns specific functions to specific isozymes is scarce. To test whether specific PKC isozymes are involved in myeloid differentiation, we have studied the effect of overexpression of PKC-alpha, -beta II, -delta, -epsilon, -zeta and -eta in 32D, a mouse myeloid progenitor cell line that does not differentiate in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). No significant morphological or phenotypic changes could be observed in unstimulated cells that overexpress any of these isozymes. However, the cell lines that overexpressed PKC-alpha or -delta had acquired the ability to become mature macrophages 2-6 h after TPA stimulation. The overexpression of PKC-beta II, -epsilon, -zeta, or -eta, in contrast, did not permit TPA-induced differentiation. These results indicate that only these two members of the PKC gene family can participate in TPA-induced myeloid differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W1516715449,"Recent investigations suggest that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha may utilize the sphingomyelin pathway for signal transduction. Signaling in this system involves hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide by action of a neutral sphingomyelinase and stimulation of a ceramide-activated protein kinase (Dressler, K. A., Mathias, S., and Kolesnick, R. N. (1992) Science 255, 1715-1718). To clarify the role of this pathway in TNF action, the present studies assessed the effect of the sphingomyelin pathway on activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), an event considered integral to the transfer of the TNF message to the cell nucleus. As shown previously, TNF (1 nM) induced a marked increase in nuclear NF-kappa B binding in human leukemia (HL-60) cells within 5 min, and elevated binding was detected for as long as 1 h. Addition of a maximally effective concentration of sphingomyelinase, 0.1 units.ml-1, induced a 50% reduction in sphingomyelin content by 5 min from a basal level of 560 pmol.10(6) cells-1 and a quantitative increase in ceramide levels from 89 pmol.10(6) cells-1. Sphingomyelinase 0.1 units.ml-1 also induced an increase in nuclear NF-kappa B binding within 5 min, an effect measurable for as long as 1 h. As little as 1 x 10(-5) units.ml-1 sphingomyelinase was effective and a maximal effect occurred with 1 x 10(-3) units.ml-1. A cell-permeable ceramide analog, C8-ceramide, which mimics biologic effects of TNF-alpha, also enhanced nuclear NF-kappa B activation within minutes. In contrast, addition of a phospholipase C or a synthetic diacylglycerol (DG) analog, 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol, failed to enhance nuclear NF-kappa B binding despite large increases in cellular DG content. Further, TNF-alpha induced elevation in ceramide content by 2 min to 185% of control but did not affect DG levels. These studies provide evidence that stimulation of the sphingomyelin pathway leads to NF-kappa B activation in HL-60 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1555572584,"Prominent features of atheromata include smooth muscle cells, cholesteryl ester-loaded macrophage foam cells, extracellular matrix, extracellularly trapped and aggregated lipoproteins, and various enzymes including lipoprotein lipase (LpL) and sphingomyelinase (SMase). The interplay of these factors was investigated in cell culture. Incubation of bovine aortic smooth muscle cells for 18 h at 37 degrees C with low density lipoprotein (LDL) in the presence of LpL and SMase led to massive aggregation of LDL on the surface of the cells as viewed by phase, fluorescence (using 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate-LDL), and electron microscopy. This aggregation required both enzymes. Studies with 125I-LDL confirmed these observations: 125I-LDL cell association in the presence of LpL plus SMase was 50-100-fold greater than in the absence of the two enzymes and was 10-fold greater than in the presence of either enzyme alone. A similar effect (68-fold enhancement) was seen with 125I-labeled lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), another atherogenic lipoprotein. In all cases, 125I-lipoprotein degradation was relatively low (< 5% of cell-associated material). LpL/SMase-mediated association of 125I-LDL with smooth muscle cells was still observed when enzymatically inactive LpL was used. The effect was markedly diminished when the smooth muscle cells were treated with a combination of chondroitin ABC lyase and heparitinase or when mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells that lack cell-surface proteoglycans were used, indicating a specific role for cellular proteoglycans. When smooth muscle cells with 125I-LDL or 125I-Lp(a) aggregates were rinsed and then coincubated with mouse peritoneal macrophages for a further 24 h, visible aggregates disappeared, and there was marked 125I-lipoprotein degradation. Electron micrographs after 24 h of co-culture showed lipid-laden, foamy macrophages situated on top of smooth muscle cells, suggesting that the macrophages phagocytosed and metabolized the smooth muscle cell-associated LDL aggregates. Last, 125I-LDL association with smooth muscle cell extracellular matrix was also synergistically enhanced by LpL and SMase, to a level that was 19-fold greater than in the absence of the two enzymes. Thus, the interaction of LDL and Lp(a) with four atheroma components, namely, smooth muscle cells, extracellular matrix, LpL, and SMase, represents a physiologically plausible mechanism for massive, focal retention and aggregation of atherogenic lipoproteins in the arterial wall with subsequent macrophage foam cell formation."

https://openalex.org/W1586229903,"The role of apolipoprotein A-II (apoA-II) in the metabolism of high density lipoproteins (HDL) is poorly understood. Previous studies of naturally occurring variations of apoA-II in mice have, however, suggested that apoA-II expression influences HDL size and concentration. We now provide definitive evidence of this using transgenic mice overexpressing mouse apoA-II. Thus, as compared with nontransgenic littermates, transgenic mice possessing 4-fold elevations of apoA-II mRNA and 2-3-fold elevations in plasma apoA-II levels exhibited more than a 2-fold increase in HDL levels as well as about a 25% increase in average HDL diameter. Overexpression of mouse apoA-II also resulted in a substantial decrease in the levels of apolipoprotein E associated with HDL, suggesting that apoA-II can displace apoE from HDL. The apoA-II transgenic mice also exhibited a 2-4-fold increase in plasma very low density and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels, suggesting novel interactions among the classes of plasma lipoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1494430869,"Stathmin is a ubiquitous, highly conserved phosphoprotein which most likely acts as a relay integrating various intracellular pathways regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and functions. At least 14 molecular forms of stathmin have been identified so far, which migrate as 2 unphosphorylated and 12 increasingly phosphorylated spots (M(r) = 19,000-23,000; pI = 6.2-5.6) on two-dimensional electrophoretic gels, and whose pattern may reflect the state of activation of cells. We found that stathmin could be phosphorylated in vitro by at least three different protein kinases: cAMP-dependent protein kinase, p34cdc2, and casein kinase II, cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalyzed the phosphorylation of stathmin on serines 16 (K-R-A-S) and 63 (R-R-K-S), whereas p34cdc2 induced phosphorylation on serines 25 (I-L-S-P-R) and 38 (P-L-S-P-P-K-K-K). Interestingly, phosphorylation by both kinases together yielded all of the phosphoforms of stathmin identified so far. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis allowed us to demonstrate that the same four sites were exclusively found to be phosphorylated in vivo, in brain tissue as well as in control or nerve growth factor-stimulated PC12 cells. In this latter case, the major site phosphorylated in response to nerve growth factor being serine 25, it is likely that a kinase such as a mitogen-activated protein kinase, known to be activated by growth factors, might directly phosphorylate stathmin. The phosphopeptide map analysis allowed further identification of the specific combinations among the four sites whose phosphorylation is responsible for the characteristic two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis migration of the resulting stathmin forms both in vitro and in vivo and revealed the existence of likely structural interactions between the sites phosphorylated. In conclusion, our results show that phosphorylation of serines 16, 25, 38, and 63 accounts for all of the major functional stathmin forms observed in vivo. The present identification of these sites will foster a better understanding of some intracellular mechanisms involved in the diverse physiological regulation of the proliferation, differentiation, and functions of cells, including the role of stathmin in these processes as a relay integrating diverse signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1508733727,"The functional significance of the large number of myosin isoforms in skeletal muscles is poorly understood. Myosin molecules that have the same heavy chain, but differ in their essential or alkali light chains, have the same actin-activated ATPase activity. Similarly, the many heavy chain isoforms that appear during the course of muscle development do not show any significant differences in enzymatic activity. By means of an in vitro motility assay, we have measured the analogue of unloaded shortening velocity for myosin isoforms in a reconstituted actomyosin system. We find that both light and heavy chain isoforms translocate actin filaments at distinct velocities. These results support the hypothesis that myosin isoforms are the primary determinant for the range of shortening velocities adopted by a muscle in response to changing functional demands."

https://openalex.org/W1751242022,"Compact cumulus cell-oocyte complexes (COCs) isolated from preovulatory mouse follicles undergo expansion in vitro when high levels of hyaluronic acid (HA) are synthesized and organized into an extracellular matrix. We studied the effects of fetal bovine serum (FBS) and of exogenous HA and HA-oligomers on the expansion process. Maximum retention of HA in the COC matrix, and hence complete COC expansion, occurs when 1% FBS is continuously present during the first 18 h of culture. Irrespective of the culture time, HA synthesized when serum is absent is primarily in the medium, whereas HA synthesized when serum is present is primarily in the cell matrix. These findings support the hypothesis that the serum factor, identified as an inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor by Chen et al. (Chen, L., Mao, S. J., and Larsen, W. J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 12380-12386), is a structural component of the matrix. Addition of exogenous HA or of HA oligomers of decasaccharide size (GlcUA-GlcNAc)5 or larger effectively displaces endogenously synthesized HA from the matrix into the medium, thereby preventing COC expansion. Addition of exogenous chondroitin sulfate affects neither matrix organization nor COC expansion, thus indicating specificity of the binding of some structural component(s) to HA. Fully expanded COCs disassemble when cultured longer than 18 h, a process which occurs also in vivo and which correlates with loss of oocyte fertilizability both in vivo and in vitro. This process involves release of macromolecular HA from the matrix into the medium, with loss of 50% of the HA in the first 8 h of incubation after full expansion. The release is not facilitated when HA oligomers, long enough to prevent matrix formation, are added to the culture medium after the COCs are fully expanded. This suggests that cooperative binding to HA of either the serum factor, an endogenously synthesized factor(s), or both is required to stabilize the fully expanded COC matrix."

https://openalex.org/W1513827803,"Rhizobia nodulation (nod) genes are involved in the synthesis of symbiotic signals, the Nod factors, which are mono-N-acylated chito-oligosaccharides. Nod factors elicit, in a specific manner, various plant responses on legume roots. In this report we address the question of the role of nodFEG genes in the synthesis of the acyl moiety of Rhizobium meliloti Nod factors. In a Nod factor-overproducing strain with the wild-type nod region, in addition to the delta 2,9-C16:2 and delta 2, 4,9-C16:3 acyl groups already described, delta 9-C16:1 was also found, together with a series of C18 to C26 (omega-1)-hydroxylated fatty acids. A deletion of nodE resulted in the absence of C16:2 and C16:3 fatty acids, which were replaced by vaccenic acid (delta 11-C18:1), but did not change the proportion of (omega-1)-hydroxylated fatty acids. A nodF deletion, non-polar with respect to nodE, resulted in the same alterations in the Nod factor N-acyl composition, showing that both nodF and nodE are required for the synthesis of the C16 polyunsaturated chains. In contrast, nodG mutations did not result in a detectable change in the Nod factor N-acyl moiety. When a plasmid carrying the nodFE genes of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae was introduced into R. meliloti nodFE- and nodFEG-deleted strains, Nod factors with polyunsaturated C18 fatty acids (C18:2, C18:3, and C18:4) could be detected. These results provide evidence that the molecular basis of allelic variation between the R. meliloti and R. leguminosarum bv. viciae host range nodFE genes lies in the fact that the two nodFE alleles specify the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acid substituents with a different carbon length."
https://openalex.org/W1522830306,"In order to determine whether sphingomyelin (SPH) affects the rate of cholesterol esterification by plasma lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), we studied the effects of its incorporation in to defined proteoliposome substrates containing phosphatidyl choline (PC), unesterified cholesterol, and apoprotein A-I, on the activity of purified LCAT. Cholesterol esterification was inhibited by up to 90% in the presence of SPH, and this inhibition was reversed by treatment with bacterial sphingomyelinase. The inhibition could be overcome by increasing the concentration of PC, but not unesterified cholesterol or apoprotein A-I, in the substrate. The effect of SPH was not related to the alterations in the size of the substrate particle and was not dependent on the type of acyl donor or apoprotein activator employed. The lysolecithin acyltransferase and phospholipase reactions carried out by LCAT were also inhibited by SPH. Kinetic studies suggested that: 1) LCAT binds better to substrate vesicles which contain SPH; 2) SPH competes with PC in binding to the active site of the enzyme; and 3) SPH is a more powerful competitive inhibitor than a diether analog of PC. The ability of various lipoproteins to act as substrates for purified LCAT varied inversely with the SPH/PC ratio. Treatment of the lipoproteins with sphingomyelinase activated the LCAT reaction, the percent activation being directly proportional to the SPH concentration in the native lipoprotein. Enrichment of high density lipoproteins with SPH inhibited cholesterol esterification in them by 50%, and this inhibition could be reversed by the degradation of SPH. These results show that SPH is a physiological inhibitor of cholesterol esterification in the plasma, by virtue of its competition with PC, the acyl donor for the reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1865863549,"Elevated expression of the c-myc oncogene is a frequent finding in tumors and cell lines derived from carcinomas of the colon and rectum. In a previous study we demonstrated that the differentiation agent sodium butyrate causes a rapid reduction in the expression of c-myc RNA in the rectal carcinoma cell line SW837. This effect was blocked by inhibitors of protein synthesis, suggesting that butyrate causes the induction of an activity that has a negative effect on c-myc expression. In the present work we demonstrate that the rapid decrease in the level of c-myc RNA, upon treatment of SW837 cells with 2 mM butyrate, is followed by a slower decrease in the level of p53 RNA and an increase in the RNA levels for fibronectin and a placental type alkaline phosphatase. Using in vitro elongation of nascent transcripts to measure transcription and actinomycin D chase experiments to measure RNA stability, we show that the reduction in expression of c-myc RNA is due to an increase in the block to transcriptional elongation, rather than a decrease in transcriptional initiation or an increase in degradation of the RNA. We conclude that sodium butyrate induces an activity that increases the transcriptional block in SW837 cells, and that regulation of transcriptional elongation is an important mechanism for regulating c-myc expression in this cell type. A shift in relative usage of the two major promoters in the c-myc gene accompanies the reduction in expression. The potential significance of this finding with respect to transcriptional elongation is discussed. Mutations in the exon 1/intron 1 boundary region of the c-myc gene cause an increase in transcriptional elongation in Burkitt lymphoma. We sequenced this region in a series of cell lines derived from colorectal carcinomas, all of which had an elevated level of c-myc expression, to determine if a similar mutational mechanism is at work in this disease. All of the lines examined had a normal c-myc DNA sequence, suggesting that the deregulation of c-myc expression in colon cancer is not due to a cis mutation in this region."
https://openalex.org/W1517098173,"The heat shock protein ClpB in Escherichia coli is a protein-activated ATPase and consists of two proteins with sizes of 93 and 79 kDa. By polymerase chain reaction-aided site-directed mutagenesis, both the proteins have been shown to be encoded by the same reading frame of the clpB gene, the 93-kDa protein (ClpB93) from the 5'-end AUG translational initiation site and the 79-kDa protein (ClpB79) from the 149th codon (an internal GUG start site). Both the purified ClpB93 and ClpB79 proteins behave as tetrameric complexes with a very similar size of about 350 kDa upon gel filtration on a Superose-6 column. Both appear to be exclusively localized to the cytosol of E. coli. Both show inherent ATPase activities and have an identical Km of 1.1 mM for ATP. The ATPase activity of ClpB93 is as markedly stimulated by proteins, including casein and insulin, as that of wild-type ClpB, but the same proteins show little or no effect on ClpB79. Because ClpB79 lacks the 148 N-terminal sequence of ClpB93 but retains the two consensus sequences for adenine nucleotide binding, the N-terminal portion appears to contain a site(s) or domain(s) responsible for protein binding. Furthermore, ClpB79 is capable of inhibiting the casein-activated ATPase activity of ClpB93 in a dose-dependent manner but without any effect on its inherent ATPase activity. In addition, ClpB93 mixed with differing amounts of ClpB79 behave as tetrameric molecules, although its protein-activated ATPase activity is gradually reduced. These results suggest that tetramer formation between ClpB93 and ClpB79 may be responsible for the inhibition of the activity."
https://openalex.org/W2167139715,"One of the central problems in protein folding is how amino acid sequences within polypeptide chains direct polypeptide chain folding and avoid off-pathway aggregation both in intracellular environments and in the test tube. The tailspike protein of phage P22 is a model system for which genetic analysis has permitted mutational dissection of the role of amino acid positions in the polypeptide chain in directing its in vivo folding. Two classes of mutations that affect intracellular folding and aggregation have been characterized; temperature-sensitive folding (tsf) mutants and second-site suppressors of tsf mutants. Here we report the effects of these mutations on the in vitro refolding and aggregation pathway of the purified proteins. The tsf mutations reduced refolding yields at high temperature and increased aggregation, while second-site suppressors enhanced refolding and inhibited aggregation in the test tube. For both types of mutations, the strength of the effects observed in vitro correlated with their in vivo phenotypes. The results confirm that the mutations act intrinsically on the folding pathway of the tailspike polypeptide and not through accessory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1587805792,"Nebulin is a family of giant muscle proteins (700-900 kDa) that interact with actin to form composite thin filaments in the skeletal muscle sarcomere. This modular protein is composed predominantly of repeating sequence modules of 31-38 residues. To understand the minimum size and number of sequence modules that are required for actin interaction, we studied the behavior of a highly soluble two-module nebulin fragment ND8 that was expressed in Escherichia coli. By fluorescence spectroscopy with pyrenyl-actin and co-sedimentation assays, we observed the following. 1) ND8 greatly accelerated actin nucleation, especially in a buffer that is suboptimal for actin nucleation. The presence of ND8 abolished the lag phase of actin polymerization and increased the net extent of steady state polymerization, thereby reducing the critical concentration of actin polymerization. 2) ND8 reduced the rate of actin depolymerization and might increase the rate of elongation. 3) Cytochalasin E, which caps both ends of actin filaments, inhibited the effect of ND8 on actin polymerization and caused the depolymerization of actin-ND8 complexes. These data suggest that ND8 interacts with actin in such a fashion that it stabilizes the actin nuclei and slows the depolymerization from the ends of actin filaments. 4) The binding stoichiometry of ND8 to F-actin, as estimated by co-sedimentation assays, is 1 to 2 mol of ND8 to 1 mol of actin with an apparent dissociation constant of 20 to 40 microM. Our data suggest that nebulin-actin interaction promotes actin nucleation and stabilizes preformed actin filaments, both of which are desirable attributes of a length-regulating template for actin filaments of the skeletal muscle. Each nebulin molecule may contain as many as 100-200 actin binding domains to form a zipper-like nebulin/actin composite filament."
https://openalex.org/W1590955040,"The 90-kDa heat shock protein, hsp90, is known to associate with steroid receptors that are in the inactive state. While the biochemical function of hsp90 is unclear, this association is believed to be significant because dissociation of hsp90 occurs when receptors are activated by hormone. Complexes between hsp90 and the progesterone receptor can be formed in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. This has been shown to be an ATP-dependent process, and dissociation of the complex occurs when progesterone is added to the system. We now show that hsp90 synthesized by in vitro translation in reticulocyte lysate can form complexes with progesterone receptor that are sensitive to hormone. This system was used to analyze several mutant forms of hsp90. A series of NH2-terminal deletions showed that amino acids 1-380 can be removed from hsp90 without substantial loss of receptor binding activity. However, several deletions in the COOH-terminal half of hsp90 resulted in a partial or complete loss of this activity. Two regions, amino acids 381-441 and 601-677, appear to be particularly important for receptor binding. These studies describe a convenient and reliable method for the initial screening of hsp90 mutants, and they provide important clues to the identification of domains on hsp90 that interact with other proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1941924385,"The recently discovered multifunctional polypeptide cyclosporin synthetase is capable of synthesizing the cyclic undecapeptide cyclosporin A in a batch reaction. Substrates are the unmethylated constitutive amino acids of cyclosporin A. Exchange of one or more of these by various amino acids gives a picture of the substrate specificity of the enzyme in vitro, which is different from the known picture obtained by in vivo studies. The uncommon amino acid butenylmethylthreonine in position 1 of the cyclosporin ring can be exchanged by an unexpected large spectrum of different amino acids, showing a great flexibility of this site. Position 2, on the other hand, which shows the greatest variability in vivo, has an only slightly lower specificity in vitro. Position 3 has a very high degree of specificity; positions 4, 6, 7, 9, and 10 have marginally less. The variability of positions 5 and 11 is moderate, whereas position 8 shows only low substrate specificity in vitro. In general, most sites of SDZ 214-103 synthetase appear to be more specific than those of cyclosporin synthetase. Site 11 has nearly identical substrate specificity compared with that of cyclosporin synthetase. The D-2-hydroxy acid position (position 8) can be occupied by a large spectrum of substrates varying from D-lactic acid to D-2-hydroxyisocaproic acid. Within the limits of the present data, the addition of further functional groups to the D-2-hydroxy acid moiety are apparently not tolerated by the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1574985307,"The Yersinia pseudotuberculosis invasin protein is a 986-amino acid protein that promotes bacterial penetration into mammalian cells by avidly binding multiple beta 1-chain integrins. A 192-amino acid carboxyl-terminal domain of invasin was previously shown to be sufficient for binding. Evidence is presented here that a 76-amino acid disulfide loop in the integrin binding domain of invasin is required for invasin-mediated cell binding and entry. Bacterial mutants that were altered at either of 2 cysteine residues in the binding domain of invasin were completely defective for entry. Purified invasin protein derivatives altered at either of these cysteines, in contrast to the wild-type invasin, did not promote either cell binding or penetration. Analysis of proteolytic products of invasin in the presence or absence of reducing agent provided evidence of an intra-chain disulfide bond near the carboxyl terminus of the protein. Alkylation of invasin derivatives with [3H]iodoacetate indicated that these 2 cysteines were normally disulfide-bonded. A treatment that resulted in the maximal reduction of the disulfide bond also resulted in maximal loss of cell attachment activity. These results indicate that the 76-amino acid disulfide loop at the carboxyl terminus of invasin is required for recognition by integrins."
https://openalex.org/W1526744579,"Abstract Bile acids, such as taurocholate, have been shown to be transported into hepatocyte smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) vesicles. This process is Na(+)-independent, electrogenic, inhibitable by 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid and taurochenodeoxycholate, with a Km of 352 microM and a Vmax of 29.6 nmol/mg protein/min. The observed transport is mediated by the bifunctional protein, microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) which can also mediate bile acid transport into hepatocytes across the sinusoidal plasma membrane (von Dippe, P., Amoui, M., Alves, C., and Levy, D. (1993) Am. J. Physiol. 264, G528-G534). mEH was isolated from SER membranes by immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibody (mAb) 25D-1 which recognizes this protein on the surface of intact hepatocytes. The SER-derived protein exhibited an apparent molecular weight, isoelectric point, N-terminal amino acid sequence, and mEH-specific activity that were indistinguishable from the plasma membrane form of the enzyme. Proteoliposome reconstitution of the SER taurocholate transport system indicated that mEH was absolutely required for the expression of transport capacity. The interaction of mAb 25D-1 with mEH on intact right-side-out SER vesicles demonstrated that the epitope found on the surface of hepatocytes was also found on the cytoplasmic surface of these vesicles (80%) and in the lumen (20%) suggesting the presence of two forms of this protein in the SER, the latter from being sorted to the cell surface. The existence of two orientations of this protein in the SER was confirmed by the sensitivity to tryptic digestion, where 75% of the mAb epitope was accessible to the enzyme. The loss of the 25D-1 epitope correlated with loss of taurocholate transport capacity. The role of mEH in the transport process and the orientation of the transporting isoform was further established by demonstrating that mAb 25A-3, which also reacts with mEH on the hepatocyte surface, was able to directly inhibit taurocholate transport in the SER vesicle system. These and previous results thus establish that isoforms of mEH can mediate taurocholate transport at the sinusoidal plasma membrane and in SER vesicles and that this bifunctional protein can exist in two orientations in the SER membrane. The association of bile acids with the SER suggests a possible role of intracellular vesicles in the transhepatocellular movement of bile acids from the sinusoidal to the canalicular compartment."
https://openalex.org/W1495820232,"Insulin stimulates the formation of p21RasGTP in Rat-1 fibroblasts overexpressing wild type (HIRc) or mutant (delta CT and Y/F2) insulin receptors. Maximal insulin effect was observed at 7 min in Y/F2 cells, at 10 min in delta CT cells, and at 15 min in HIRc cells. Mutant insulin receptors which display enhanced mitogenic signaling properties stimulated p21Ras.GTP formation to a greater extent than wild type receptors. The amount of p21Ras was not affected by insulin (Western blotting). Tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Lavendustin A (10 nM), completely prevented insulin-induced activation of p21Ras in all cell lines. Insulin did not lead to GAP phosphorylation, or a change in cellular GAP activity, but did result in marked stimulation of Ras guanine nucleotide releasing factor (GRF) activity (by 48% in HIRc, 71% in delta CT, and 120% in Y/F2 cells). These results indicated that p21Ras.GTP is an important signaling molecule in insulin's mitogenic pathway, but may not participate in metabolic signaling and that insulin's stimulatory effects on p21Ras.GTP formation are mediated through Ras GRF."
https://openalex.org/W1510096420,"Activation of the microbicidal response of phagocytes requires cytosolic ATP and is associated with extensive protein phosphorylation, suggesting the involvement of protein kinases in the signal transduction cascade. An in vitro renaturation assay was used to identify the protein kinase(s) activated by chemoattractants in human blood neutrophils. Four distinct kinases were activated by the chemotactic peptide formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenyl-alanine with molecular masses of 72, 65, 49, and 41 kDa (designated PK72, PK65, PK49, and PK41, respectively). PK72 and PK65 were activated very rapidly (5-15 s), yet transiently. By comparison, PK49 and PK41 responded in a slower, more sustained manner. Treatment of extracts of activated cells with alkaline phosphatase reverted the stimulation of the kinases, suggesting that phosphorylation is the post-translational modification that underlies activation of the kinases. Stimulation of PK72 and PK65 by chemoattractant was independent of calcium and protein kinase C. In contrast, elevation of cytosolic free calcium levels was sufficient and appeared to be necessary for full activation of PK49 and PK41. While phorbol esters can mimic the effects of formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine on PK49 and PK41, inhibition of protein kinase C by staurosporine did not prevent the receptor-mediated activation of these kinases. PK41 most likely corresponds to the Erk-1 isoform of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. Accordingly, PK41 effectively phosphorylated myelin basic protein, known to be a good substrate for Erk-1. The electrophoretic mobility of PK49 is similar to that of MAP kinase-kinase (MAP/Erk kinase). However, immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that PK49 is not MAP/Erk kinase. The identity of this and other kinases remains to be defined, but possible candidates are discussed. In addition to autophosphorylating, PK72, PK65, and PK41 were shown to effectively phosphorylate exogenous substrates. These kinases may therefore play a role in signal transduction during stimulation by chemoattractants."
https://openalex.org/W1550120913,"Heparan sulfate-N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase catalyzes both the N-deacetylation and N-sulfation reactions that initiate the modification of the oligosaccharide backbone of heparan sulfate (HS). The glycosaminoglycan polymer appears to modulate the activity of growth factors by mediating their initial binding. To understand how the biosynthesis of these binding sites is regulated, a rat liver-derived cDNA encoding the above activities was overexpressed in a COS cell mutant (CM-15) that has reduced levels of the enzyme and binds poorly to immobilized basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). This resulted in increased synthesis of sulfated blocks of decasaccharide size or longer. These blocks exhibited high affinity binding to bFGF and contained a high content of 2-O-sulfated iduronate and at least five consecutive N-sulfated disaccharides. An increase in the synthesis of these high affinity blocks was not seen in transfected wild-type COS cells even though they showed a 4-fold increase of both enzyme activities, suggesting that once sufficient levels of highly sulfated blocks of saccharides with high affinity for bFGF are attained, no further synthesis of these domains occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1599958769,"We have previously used synthetic peptides to identify a homophilic binding site between Lys-243 and Glu-252 (KYSFNYDGSE) in the third immunoglobulin-like domain of the chick neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). In this report, we show that the deletion of this decapeptide sequence from chick NCAM or the scrambling of the first 5 amino acid residues led to the abolition of the homophilic binding activity of NCAM, thus confirming the role of this sequence in NCAM-NCAM binding. To investigate the involvement of individual residues of this decapeptide in NCAM binding, competition experiments were carried out using peptide analogues with various amino acid substitutions. Substitution of both Lys-243 and Asp-249 with Ala or of the 3 aromatic residues with Ala led to a total loss of activity, highlighting the importance of these residues in NCAM binding. Site-directed mutagenesis was then employed to substitute individual amino acids within the decapeptide sequence with Ala. The homophilic binding activity of mutant NCAMs transiently expressed in COS-1 cells was determined using the NCAM-Covasphere binding assay. Substitution of the charged residues with alanine decreased NCAM binding activity, implicating electrostatic interactions in NCAM binding activity. Substitution of the aromatic residues Tyr-244 and Phe-246 with Ala abolished NCAM binding activity, suggesting that hydrophobic and/or aromatic interactions may play an important role in NCAM homophilic binding. Substitution of amino acids in the predicted beta-strand portion of the decapeptide with Pro, which would tend to disrupt beta-strand conformation, led to a substantial loss of activity. Thus, NCAM-NCAM binding may also depend on the beta-backbone structure of this site. These results are consistent with the involvement of multiple amino acids within the decapeptide sequence in NCAM homophilic interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1506771283,"SPC3 is a member of a growing family of mammalian subtilisin-like serine proteases which play a probable role in proprotein maturation. In this study we have prepared a mouse L cell line stably expressing rat SPC3 cDNA and characterized the recombinant SPC3 protein secreted into the medium. Three molecular forms of recombinant SPC3 were identified with molecular masses of 86, 75, and 64 kDa. NH2-terminal sequence analysis indicated that all three forms were cleaved following the sequence -Arg107-Arg-Lys-Arg110, indicating removal of an SPC3 prosequence. All three molecular forms showed a 3-4-kDa decrease in molecular mass following incubation with endoglycosidase F. Two SPC3 carboxyl-terminal-directed antisera recognized only the 86-kDa molecular form of recombinant SPC3, demonstrating that COOH-terminal truncation of SPC3 protein is responsible for the different molecular mass forms. Recombinant SPC3 had a pH optimum of 6.0 and was stimulated by calcium, with maximum activity at 10 mM. Recombinant SPC3 was inhibited most effectively by the thiol-reactive reagent p-hydroxymecuribenzoate and the heavy metal chelators EDTA and EGTA. Recombinant SPC3 was also inhibited by alpha 1-antitrypsin Pittsburgh as well as wild type alpha 1-antitrypsin and antithrombin III. The inhibitor specificities revealed using these high molecular mass serpins differ from those reported for other members of the subtilisin-like serine protease family and may be able to be exploited to distinguish between closely related members of this new enzyme superfamily. Studies of cleavage specificity using tri- and tetrapeptidyl coumarins that contained pairs of basic residues indicated that tetrapeptide substrates that contained an S4 Arg residue as part of an -Arg-X-Lys/Arg-Arg motif were the most effective synthetic peptide substrates. Recombinant SPC3 also cleaved human proalbumin following the Arg-Gly-Val-Phe-Arg-Arg prosequence. Circulating human proalbumin variants that contained a mutation at either of the basic amino acids adjacent to the cleavage site were not cleaved by recombinant SPC3. Recombinant SPC3 was also able to cleave after a single arginine residue in chicken proalbumin following the Arg-Asn-Leu-Gln-Arg-Phe-Ala-Arg prosequence. These results define the primary structure requirements for cleavage by recombinant SPC3 and remain consistent with a role for SPC3 in proprotein/prohormone maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1562309240,"Abstract Although G-protein- and protein kinase-mediated pathways have been reported to activate phospholipase D (PLD) following cell stimulation, the relation between these activation pathways and the mechanistic details of lipase stimulation remain unknown. We have studied activation of PLD by GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate)), and its potentiation by ATP, in a cell-free system derived from U937 human promonocytic leukocytes. ATP, in the micromolar to millimolar range, significantly augmented GTP gamma S-stimulated PLD activity (2.6-fold) and the combination resulted in a 15-fold increase in PLD activity compared to control. ATP alone did not stimulate PLD activity. Measurement of endogenous cytosolic ATP levels and nucleotide depletion with activated charcoal demonstrated that stimulation of PLD by GTP gamma S proceeds by both ATP-dependent and -independent pathways. Nucleotide specificity data suggested that the ATP-dependent pathway involves kinase activity. The tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate augmented PLD activity stimulated by GTP gamma S/ATP by 41% (p < 0.01). Conversely, the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A decreased PLD activity stimulated by GTP gamma S/ATP by 58 and 35%, respectively (p < 0.001 for each). Mixing experiments utilizing subcellular fractions from herbimycin A-treated cells suggested that the relevant tyrosine kinase activity is membrane-associated. Despite its role in ATP-induced potentiation, tyrosine kinase activity is neither necessary nor sufficient for activation of PLD in this system. Protein kinase C (PKC) is unlikely to play a role in potentiation by ATP as PKC activity is not stimulated under conditions of maximal PLD activation."
https://openalex.org/W1591471179,"Two distinct transporters for nucleobases have been characterized in LLC-PK1 cells. The first system accumulates hypoxanthine against a concentration gradient in the presence of sodium. The sodium-dependent uptake of hypoxanthine was saturable at 22 degrees C with a Km value of 0.79 +/- 0.43 microM, a Vmax of 15 +/- 4 pmol/mg protein/60 s, and a Na+:hypoxanthine coupling stoichiometry of 1.27 +/- 0.20. Uptake of hypoxanthine was inhibited by 5-fluorouracil, uracil, thymine, and guanine (Ki values 3-6 microM). Adenine and nucleosides were without effect. Using cell monolayers grown on a permeable filter support, Na(+)-dependent hypoxanthine uptake occurred preferentially from the apical surface. The second system exhibited no cation specificity and was saturable with a low affinity for hypoxanthine (Km of 124 +/- 22 microM) and a high Vmax of 275 +/- 38 pmol/mg protein/60 s. Adenine and guanine inhibited Na(+)-independent hypoxanthine uptake (Ki values 30 +/- 15 and 18 +/- 7 microM, respectively). Other nucleobases and nucleosides exhibited little or no inhibition of equilibrative hypoxanthine influx. Dipyridamole, dilazep, and phloridzin were effective inhibitors of Na(+)-dependent hypoxanthine uptake but had little effect on the Na(+)-independent flux. This study represents the first direct demonstration of a unique high affinity Na+ nucleobase co-transporter system in cultured animal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1608158053,"In antigen-antibody interactions, the high avidity of antibodies for their specific antigens can be achieved both by exploiting the high affinity of each binding site and by multivalence of antibodies. In this study, we developed artificial antibodies with multiple valency. The Fv fragments of an antibody fused with one and with two domains of the Fc-binding protein A from Staphylococcus aureus (designated Fv-P and Fv-PP, respectively) were expressed in secreted forms in Escherichia coli. Their physical characteristics were examined. The Fv portions of Fv-P and Fv-PP had virtually the same affinity for the antigen as that of the original Fv molecules, and each protein A-derived domain could be bound to IgG. When Fv-P was mixed with IgG, the complex formed was composed of two Fv-P molecules and one IgG molecule. In the case of Fv-PP, a complex composed of three Fv-PP molecules and two IgG molecules was preferentially formed. Analysis of surface plasmon resonance in a BIAcore system indicated multivalency of these complexes for antigens. There was 3.5-fold decrease in the dissociation constant of the complex between Fv-PP and the antigen upon the addition of IgG. The use of these complexes as reagents in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting gave much stronger signals than Fv, Fv-P, and Fv-PP alone."
https://openalex.org/W1605006630,"RNA polymerase II-associating proteins (RAP30 and RAP74) are subunits of the transcription factor called variously RAP30/74, TFIIF, beta gamma, and FC. This factor is required for accurate transcription by RNA polymerase II, in addition to other basal transcription factors. Using recombinant human RAP30 and RAP74, the functions of these subunits have been tested separately during the initiation and elongation phases of transcription. RAP30 is required to form a Sarkosyl-resistant complex at 0.25% Sarkosyl, so RAP30 is required for initiation. RAP74, however, stimulates transcription when added after Sarkosyl, indicating that RAP74 is dispensable for initiation. The same result is obtained using a pulse-chase protocol in which accurately initiated RNA is labeled during a short pulse, followed by a chase with excess unlabeled nucleoside triphosphates. RAP30 is required in order to label the transcript during the pulse, but RAP74 is not. RAP74 must be added during the chase, however, in order to obtain a short runoff transcript. The following conclusions can be drawn from these experiments: 1) RAP30 is an initiation factor; 2) RAP74 is not required for ATP hydrolysis in initiation, which precedes phosphodiester bond formation; 3) RAP74 is not required for template strand separation; 4) RAP74 is not required to initiate phosphodiester bond formation; and 5) RAP74 is required for very early elongation."
https://openalex.org/W1644974312,"The platelet glycoprotein Ib-IX complex (GP Ib-IX) is essential for the initial attachment of platelets to the wall of damaged arteries. In this study, an N-terminal fragment of human GP Ib alpha (residues 1-318), containing the ligand binding sites for von Willebrand factor (vWF) and thrombin, as well as the entire human GP Ib alpha were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The transfected cells secreted a 48- and a 110-kDa protein, respectively, into the supernatant. Both recombinant proteins were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. The purified proteins bound soluble vWF in the presence of botrocetin as demonstrated in solid-phase binding assays. The dissociation constant (Kd) for 125I-vWF binding to the recombinant 110-kDa protein was 1.2 +/- 0.2 nM as compared with 1.0 +/- 0.3 nM for vWF binding to purified platelet GP Ib-IX. Both recombinant proteins were also retained on thrombin-Sepharose 4B. The 48-kDa protein contained two N-linked oligosaccharide chains. A 125-kDa protein was identified in the lysate of cells transfected with the coding sequence for the entire GP Ib alpha. Trypsin treatment of this protein generated a 110-kDa fragment, whereas the secreted 110-kDa protein remained unchanged. Post-translational removal of the C-terminal transmembrane domain of recombinant GP Ib alpha might have facilitated the secretion of the soluble glycocalicin-like 110-kDa fragment. In addition, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that the expression of GP Ib alpha alone is sufficient for its incorporation into the cell surface membrane. These data indicate that two soluble fragments of human GP Ib alpha with binding activity for vWF and thrombin can be expressed in mammalian cells and that the incorporation of GP Ib alpha into the surface membrane does not depend on co-expression with GP Ib beta and/or GP IX."
https://openalex.org/W1524317861,"We have studied the effects of brefeldin A (BFA) on the polarized delivery of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor to the basolateral surface of MDCK cells. Unlike the delivery of several other basolateral membrane and secretory proteins, the delivery of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor from the trans-Golgi network to the cell surface was inhibited by BFA. The effect of BFA treatment was apparent at 1.0 microgram/ml (36% inhibition), and maximal inhibition was observed at 10 micrograms/ml (70% inhibition). The delivery of the receptor from the endoplasmic reticulum to the basolateral surface was even more sensitive to the effect of BFA; delivery was inhibited 95% in cells treated with 1 micrograms/ml BFA. The selective action of BFA on the basolateral delivery of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor suggests that there may be multiple pathways for delivery of proteins to the basolateral cell surface of MDCK cells."
https://openalex.org/W1555475990,"The initial steps in the catabolism of cell-associated heparan sulfate proteolgycans in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are similar to what has been observed in other cells, cell surface proteoglycans are internalized and the heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans are released from core proteins and cleaved to small chains by intracellular heparanases. The mechanism of the release and cleavage reactions is unclear, since only intact proteoglycans and small, cleaved heparan sulfate chains are observed in pulse-chase experiments; however, it is thought that release of the glycosaminoglycans from core proteins precedes heparanas cleavage (Yanagishita, M., and Hascall, V. C. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 9451-9454). The relationship between these two steps were examined with the proteoglycan synthesis mutant pgsE-606 (Bame, K. J., and Esko, J. D. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8059-8065), since the undersulfated heparan sulfate synthesized by the mutant is a poor substrate for heparanases. In addition to intact proteoglycans and small cleaved chains, a large glycosaminoglycan intermediate is present in pgsE-606 cells, suggesting that heparan sulfate is released from proteoglycans as large chains which are subsequently cleaved by heparanases. The catabolic intermediate in the mutant has been acted upon by heparanases, since it is smaller than the size of the heparan sulfate chains found on proteoglycans, raising the possibility that the glycosaminoglycans are first released from proteoglycans by an endoglycosidic cleavage of the chain before proteolysis of the core protein. To examine whether proteolysis of the core protein is required for endoglycosidic cleavage of the chain, heparan sulfate proteoglycans immobilized to Sepharose were incubated with CHO cell extracts in the presence of protease inhibitors. Heparan sulfate chains are released from the proteoglycans by heparanases in the cell extract, indicating that release of the glycosaminoglycans from core proteins is not a prerequisite for endoglycosidic cleavage of the chain. In addition, these studies indicate that there is a heparanase activity in CHO cells which can recognize and cleave sequences in the undersulfated heparan sulfate, but is unable to completely cleave the mutant glycosaminoglycan, suggesting that there may be multiple heparanase activities responsible for degrading the heparan sulfate chains."
https://openalex.org/W1485156902,"Low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins and GLUT4 protein were isolated in purified plasma membrane and low density microsome fractions from rat skeletal muscle. GTP-binding proteins were detected via the ability of these proteins to bind [32P]GTP subsequent to Western blotting. GLUT4 protein was detected via the anti-GLUT4 antibody F349 subsequent to Western blotting. The possible involvement of GTP-binding proteins in the regulation of GLUT4 protein movement was investigated by examining the subcellular distribution of GTP-binding proteins and GLUT4 protein under basal conditions and following stimulation by insulin or muscle contraction. Insulin stimulation caused a 111 +/- 34.8% increase in the plasma membrane content of GTP-binding proteins which was paralleled by a 74 +/- 19.1% increase in the plasma membrane content of GLUT4 protein. The insulin-stimulated increase in plasma membrane GTP-binding proteins and GLUT4 protein occurred coincident with 27 +/- 4.6 and 33 +/- 7.4% decreases, respectively, in the low density microsome content of these proteins. In addition, muscle contraction significantly increased the plasma membrane content of GTP-binding proteins (63 +/- 18.1%) and GLUT4 protein (67 +/- 22.2%). However, with muscle contraction the concentrations of GTP-binding proteins and GLUT4 protein were not altered in low density microsome fractions. The similar patterns with which the GTP-binding proteins and GLUT4 protein responded to stimulation by insulin and muscle contraction suggests a possible, but yet unidentified functional relationship between these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1526778147,"Evidence is presented showing that alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) inhibits a novel prohormone thiol protease (PTP) involved in processing the enkephalin precursor. Colocalization of ACT immunoreactivity with PTP within isolated secretory vesicles of bovine adrenal medulla and pituitary indicated that endogenous ACT could regulate PTP in vivo. The endogenous 60 kDa bovine ACT (bACT)-like protein was purified from pituitary by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, chromatofocusing, butyl-Sepharose, and Sephacryl S-200. Characterization showed that the bACT-like protein was a potent inhibitor of PTP (Ki,app value of 2.2 nM) as well as an effective inhibitor of chymotrypsin (Ki,app value of 2.3 nM). Furthermore, the bACT-like protein formed sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable complexes with chymotrypsin, which is typical of serpin protease inhibitors. Importantly, PTP formed sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable complexes with human ACT, suggesting that PTP's cleavage specificity may resemble the reactive center of ACT. PTP cleavage of enkephalin-containing peptides at the NH2-terminal side of paired basic residues (Lys-Arg, Arg-Arg, Lys-Lys), flanking the COOH terminus of (Met)enkephalin (Tyr-Gly-GLy-Phe-Met), indicates methionine at the P1 position. PTP cleavage of peptide-methylcoumarin amide and peptide-p-nitroanilide substrates demonstrated specificity for paired basic and monobasic residues, as well as a role for methionine in PTP's cleavage site. These results showing PTP's ability for processing at a methionine residue which resembles the P1 specificity of ACT are compatible with inhibition of PTP by ACT. These findings are the first demonstration of the involvement of a protease inhibitor in neuropeptide precursor processing. The known developmental regulation of ACT in brain and significant amounts of ACT in amyloid plaques of Alzheimer's disease suggest a possible role for PTP in the maturation of peptidergic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1593189296,"DNA helicases catalyze the essential process of unwinding duplex DNA to form the single-stranded DNA intermediates required for DNA metabolic processes including replication, recombination, and repair. Most cells, possibly all, encode multiple helicases that function selectively in different processes, although some helicases can complement each other in vivo. Thus, although Escherichia coli can survive mutations or deletions of either the uvrD gene (encoding Helicase II) or the rep gene (encoding Rep helicase) separately, deletion of both rep and uvrD genes is lethal (Washburn, B. K., and Kushner, S. R. (1991) J. Bacteriol. 173,2569-2575). The Rep and UvrD polypeptides share approximately 40% sequence homology, and we have previously shown that both form homodimeric species and that the Rep homodimer appears to be the functionally active helicase. We report here that these two proteins can also interact in vitro to form a heterodimer. The heterodimer appears to be energetically more stable than the Rep homodimer but less stable than the UvrD homodimer under our conditions. The observation of Rep/UvrD heterodimer formation in vitro opens up the intriguing possibility that the heterodimer may play a physiologically important role that is distinct from the role of the Rep or UvrD homodimers. Therefore, considerations of the role of either protein in DNA metabolic processes, such as replication and repair, must include a potential role for a Rep/UvrD heterodimer."

Recombinant canditropsinogen (Ctg), which was expressed as inclusion bodies in the cytosol of E. coli, was refolded by dialysis from an 8 M urea solution and purified to homogeneity using chromatographies on Sephacryl S-300 and on MonoQ columns. The purified Ctg was converted into canditropsin by either acid activation or trypsin conversion. The specificity of the resulting recombinant canditropsin toward polypeptide substrates is significantly different from other aspartic proteases. Canditropsin hydrolyzes oxidized insulin B chain between Ala-Leu and many other minor cleavage sites. Canditropsin also hydrolyzes keratin and collagen, which are components of connective tissues known to be hydrolyzed by canditropsin during Candida infections. Canditropsin was strongly inhibited by the universal aspartic protease inhibitor pepstatin (Ki = 1.75 x 10(-8) M) and inactivated by two aspartic protease inactivators, DAN and EPNP. Canditropsin is weakly inhibited by leupeptin and antipain, with an apparent Ki of 1.74 x 10(-4)M and 1.5 x 10(-5) M, respectively."

To investigate the functional role of the ATPase activity, we have analyzed the effect of mutations in each of the putative ATPase motifs. Recombinant VETF was expressed in HeLa cells using a vaccinia virus/T7 RNA polymerase system. Simultaneous expression of both subunits of VETF was required to obtain soluble protein with promoter binding, DNA-dependent ATPase, and transcription activation functions. The mutants with altered ATPase motifs retained promoter binding activity but had no detectable ATPase activity and no ability to activate transcription. The DEAH box mutant was shown to dominantly repress transcription activation by wildtype VETF. These results indicate that the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of VETF is essential for its transcription activation function."

Highly purified eIF-5 is a monomeric protein with a M(r) of about 58,000. However, in partially purified preparations, 58-kDa eIF-5 is associated with other cellular protein(s) and sediments in glycerol gradient centrifugation as a protein of M(r) approximately 160,000.

Phosphopeptide mapping revealed two major sites of phosphorylation, which are distinct from rabbit reticulocyte eIF-5 sites phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinase II.

https://openalex.org/W1523552231,"The kinetics of protein metabolism were evaluated in isolated adult feline cardiomyocytes maintained in long term cell culture. The results of these studies suggested that, rather than individual proteins entering a kinetically homogeneous pool, most newly synthesized proteins were segregated into different kinetic compartments with different probabilities of being degraded. Evidence for this conclusion was developed from two types of experiment. The first line of evidence was derived from the kinetics of labeled amino acid incorporation into protein when labeling was conducted over very short or long periods (4 h to 32 days). The observed rates of isotope incorporation over different periods did not fit the expected pattern for a homogeneous pool. A close approximation of observed rates of label incorporation over both short and long labeling intervals could, however, be fit to results predicted using a two-compartment model. When the results of long term equilibration labeling studies were also evaluated relative to short and long term labeling ratios, then it was also possible to identify a unique set of parameters for a two-compartment model which could account for label incorporation in both types of experiment. From this analysis it was estimated that the fast kinetic compartment represented a steady-state level of 10% of total cellular protein with a mean half-life of 21.9 h (ks = 75.9% d-1). The slow kinetic compartment comprised the remaining 90% of protein with a mean t1/2 equal to 15.6 days (ks = 4.4% d-1). Both the observed and predicted equilibration rate of this two compartment mixture was best fit by a single exponential function with an equilibration rate of 5.48% d-1. Based on this outcome, it was also predicted that mixing of nascent and long lived proteins could be followed using a protocol of long and short term labeling in different isotopes followed by a chase period without label. By tracking the isotope ratios in total proteins and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separated proteins, as well as in counts released into the culture medium during the chase period it was determined that nascent proteins were preferentially degraded for a period of at least 48 h following synthesis. Up to 20% of nascent proteins in both the total protein compartment as well as individual proteins, such as myosin heavy chain, were preferentially degraded prior to achieving a state of homogeneous mixing with long lived proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1547889327,"Murine erythroleukemia cells rendered deficient in cAMP-dependent protein kinase (A-kinase) activity by gene transfection are severely impaired in hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA)-induced differentiation (Pilz, R. B., Eigenthaler, M., and Boss, G. R. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 16161-16167). We now demonstrate that the A-kinase-deficient cells produce hemoglobin normally in response to exogenous hemin and that the heme precursor delta-aminolevulinate (delta-ALA) significantly increases HMBA-induced synthesis of heme and globin chains in these cells; these data suggest that impaired heme synthesis is at least partially responsible for the cells' deficient hemoglobin synthesis. HMBA-induced expression of the erythroid-specific delta-ALA synthetase, porphobilinogen deaminase, and beta-globin mRNAs was less in A-kinase-deficient cells than in parental cells and was reduced in proportion to the cells' residual A-kinase activity; relative transcription rates of these genes were reduced concordantly. Impaired expression of these three erythroid-specific genes was a feature of many independently-derived A-kinase-deficient clones, and normal expression was found in transfectants with normal A-kinase activity. The A-kinase-deficient cells did not exhibit a generalized defect in gene regulation since mRNA expression and transcription rates of H- and L-ferritin, c-myc, c-myb, and several housekeeping enzymes were similar in HMBA-treated parental and A-kinase-deficient cells. Our data suggest that A-kinase may be involved in regulating genes with erythroid-specific promoters and provide further evidence for heme as a regulator of globin chain synthesis."

We report that CCK-JMV-180 can accelerate Ca2+ influx into fura-2-loaded dispersed rat pancreatic acini and single acinar cells. Furthermore, CCK-JMV-180 accelerates Ca2+ influx into cells microinjected with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor antagonist heparin and into acini loaded with the Ca(2+)-chelating agent BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid).

They suggest that depletion of an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-independent intracellular Ca2+ storage pool and/or generation of a non-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate second messenger by CCK-JMV-180 may be a sufficient signal for acceleration of Ca2+ influx into rat pancreatic acinar cells."

Intact hemoglobin.haptoglobin complex with 3H, 14C, and 59Fe radioactivities, an 82-kDa component with 3H, 14C, and 59Fe radioactivities, a 40-kDa component with 3H and 59Fe radioactivities, a lower molecular weight component with 3H and 59Fe radioactivities, and a component with 3H and 59Fe radioactivities bound to the microsome, which are referred to as peaks A, B, C, D, and E, respectively. Using a differential centrifugation technique, most of peak B was found in the mitochondria-lysosomal fraction. Peaks C and D were in the 82,500 x g supernatant fraction, while peak D was also found in the mitochondria-lysosomal fraction. The molecular weight of peak C was approximately 40 kDa, and the 3H radioactivity of peak C was eluted at the same fraction as glutathione S-transferases using both gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. Peak E that was solubilized from the microsomes was found at the microsomal heme protein fraction on gel filtration chromatogram. Some of the 3H radioactivity in the microsomes was partially co-purified with cytochrome b5 fraction. These results indicate that there are at least four metabolites of heme moiety of hemoglobin.haptoglobin complex in rat liver cells during its catabolism and suggest that some of the heme derived from catabolized hemoglobin.haptoglobin complex binds to glutathione S-transferases in the cytosol and is incorporated into apoheme proteins in the microsomes or at least apocytochrome b5."
https://openalex.org/W1496814847,"In rat adipocytes and soleus muscles, 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (CD) was found to have a relatively small or no effect on basal or insulin-stimulated hexose uptake, but markedly enhanced hexose uptake effects of phorbol esters and/or diacylglycerol. In rat adipocytes, the CD-induced enhancement of hexose uptake during concurrent phorbol ester treatment was not associated with an increase in GLUT4 glucose transporter translocation to the plasma membrane, which was stimulated comparably by insulin and phorbol esters. Moreover, CD appeared to activate or facilitate the activation of glucose transporters subsequent to their translocation to the plasma membrane during ongoing phorbol ester treatment. In rat adipocytes, CD also enhanced the translocation of protein kinase C (PKC)-beta to the plasma membrane during the action of phorbol esters, which alone had little or no effect on this specific PKC translocation. Although it is uncertain how CD alters the function of plasma membranes to enhance the translocation of PKC-beta to, and the activation of glucose transporters within, this subcellular fraction during phorbol ester treatment, our findings provide direct support for a two-step model in the activation of glucose transport. In addition, it seems clear that, at least in some cell types, simple phorbol ester treatment does not necessarily serve as a ubiquitous activator of all activable PKC pools and all potential PKC-mediated responses."
https://openalex.org/W1595419737,"The unfolding of brain pyridoxal kinase by guanidinium HCl has been investigated at equilibrium. The overall process was reversible as judged from the complete recovery of catalytic activity after removal of guanidinium HCl. Unfolding of pyridoxal kinase was monitored by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. The steepness of the spectroscopic changes between 0.2 and 1.5 M guanidinium HCl, and the lack of any discernible plateau suggests that unfolding of the monomer is a cooperative process. A compact intermediate on the unfolding pathway of pyridoxal kinase could not be detected by the method of denaturant gel filtration. The fluorescent analogs of the substrates ATP and pyridoxal were used to assess differences in stability among the domains of the protein. Based on fluorescence and steady emission anisotropy results, it is postulated that the nucleotide domain is more stable than the pyridoxal domain of the kinase."
