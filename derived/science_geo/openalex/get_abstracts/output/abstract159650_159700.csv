https://openalex.org/W2167768159,"EphB receptor tyrosine kinases are enriched at synapses, suggesting that these receptors play a role in synapse formation or function. We find that EphrinB binding to EphB induces a direct interaction of EphB with NMDA-type glutamate receptors. This interaction occurs at the cell surface and is mediated by the extracellular regions of the two receptors, but does not require the kinase activity of EphB. The kinase activity of EphB may be important for subsequent steps in synapse formation, as perturbation of EphB tyrosine kinase activity affects the number of synaptic specializations that form in cultured neurons. These findings indicate that EphrinB activation of EphB promotes an association of EphB with NMDA receptors that may be critical for synapse development or function."

https://openalex.org/W2093262727,"Secreted morphogens such as the Drosophila TGF-β homolog Decapentaplegic (Dpp) are thought to spread through target tissues and form long-range concentration gradients providing positional information. Using a GFP-Dpp fusion, we monitored a TGF-β family member trafficking in situ throughout the target tissue and forming a long-range concentration gradient. Evidence is presented that long-range Dpp movement involves Dpp receptor and Dynamin functions. We also show that the rates of endocytic trafficking and degradation determine Dpp signaling range. We propose a model where the gradient is formed via intracellular trafficking initiated by receptor-mediated endocytosis of the ligand in receiving cells with the gradient slope controlled by endocytic sorting of Dpp toward recycling versus degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1510167055,"The molecular mechanisms regulating the amount of dietary cholesterol retained in the body, as well as the body's ability to exclude selectively other dietary sterols, are poorly understood. An average western diet will contain about 250-500 mg of dietary cholesterol and about 200-400 mg of non-cholesterol sterols. About 50-60% of the dietary cholesterol is absorbed and retained by the normal human body, but less than 1% of the non-cholesterol sterols are retained. Thus, there exists a subtle mechanism that allows the body to distinguish between cholesterol and non-cholesterol sterols. In sitosterolemia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder, affected individuals hyperabsorb not only cholesterol but also all other sterols, including plant and shellfish sterols from the intestine. The major plant sterol species is sitosterol; hence the name of the disorder. Consequently, patients with this disease have very high levels of plant sterols in the plasma and develop tendon and tuberous xanthomas, accelerated atherosclerosis, and premature coronary artery disease. We previously mapped the STSL locus to human chromosome 2p21 and further localized it to a region of less than 2 cM bounded by markers D2S2294 and D2S2291 (M.-H.L. et al., manuscript submitted). We now report that a new member of the ABC transporter family, ABCG5, is mutant in nine unrelated sitosterolemia patients."
https://openalex.org/W2168770561,Ras activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is important for survival of transformed cells. We find that PI3Kgamma is strongly and directly activated by H-Ras G12V in vivo or by GTPgammaS-loaded H-Ras in vitro. We have determined a crystal structure of a PI3Kgamma/Ras.GMPPNP complex. A critical loop in the Ras binding domain positions Ras so that it uses its switch I and switch II regions to bind PI3Kgamma. Mutagenesis shows that interactions with both regions are essential for binding PI3Kgamma. Ras also forms a direct contact with the PI3Kgamma catalytic domain. These unique Ras/PI3Kgamma interactions are likely to be shared by PI3Kalpha. The complex with Ras shows a change in the PI3K conformation that may represent an allosteric component of Ras activation.

https://openalex.org/W2113695281,"The secreted signaling protein Dpp acts as a morphogen to pattern the anterior-posterior axis of the Drosophila wing. Dpp activity is required in all cells of the developing wing imaginal disc, but the ligand gradient that supports this activity has not been characterized. Here we make use of a biologically active form of Dpp tagged with GFP to examine the ligand gradient. Dpp-GFP forms an unstable extracellular gradient that spreads rapidly in the wing disc. The activity gradient visualized by MAD phosphorylation differs in shape from the ligand gradient. The pMAD gradient adjusted to compartment size when this was experimentally altered. These observations suggest that the Dpp activity gradient may be shaped at the level of receptor activation."

https://openalex.org/W1984047231,"In epithelial and endothelial cells, tight junctions regulate the paracellular permeability of ions and proteins. Disruption of tight junctions by inflammation is often associated with tissue edema, but regulatory mechanisms are not fully understood. Using ECV304 cells as a model system, lysophosphatidic acid and histamine were found to increase the paracellular permeability of the tracer horseradish peroxidase. Cytoskeletal changes induced by these agents included stimulation of stress fiber formation and myosin light chain phosphorylation. Additionally, occludin, a tight junction protein, was a target for signaling events triggered by lysophosphatidic acid and histamine, events that resulted in its phosphorylation. A dominant-negative mutant of RhoA, RhoA T19N, or a specific inhibitor of Rho-activated kinases, Y-27632, prevented stress fiber formation, myosin light chain phosphorylation, occludin phosphorylation, and the increase in tracer flux in response to lysophosphatidic acid. In contrast, although RhoA T19N and Y-27632 blocked the cytoskeletal events induced by histamine, they had no effect on the stimulation of occludin phosphorylation or increased tracer flux, indicating that occludin phosphorylation may regulate tight junction permeability independently of cytoskeletal events. Thus, occludin is a target for receptor-initiated signaling events regulating its phosphorylation, and this phosphorylation may be a key regulator of tight junction permeability.

It serves as a paracellular barrier to restrict the movement of ions and proteins across tissue boundaries (1Schneeberger E.E. Lynch R.D. Am. J.

This barrier function is essential for the maintenance of tissue environments. Dysfunction of the TJ occurs in response to a variety of inflammatory stimuli and also during ischemia, leading to tissue edema and damage. Therefore, analysis of TJ regulation could lead to an understanding of normal physiology as well as pathology and to the identification of novel therapeutic targets. The molecular components of the TJ are being discovered and so far include ZO-1 (5Stevenson B.R. Siliciano J.D. Mooseker M.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar), ZO-2 (6Gumbiner B. Lowenkopf T. Apatira D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1003-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In addition to these peripheral membrane proteins, occludin was discovered as an integral membrane protein of the TJ having four transmembrane domains (12Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar). The carboxy tail of occludin is linked to the actin cytoskeleton via ZO-1, ZO-2 and ZO-3 (13Furuse M. Itoh M. Hirase T. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 14Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5981-5986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Recent work has also identified members of the claudin family as TJ components that have four transmembrane domains but no sequence similarity to occludin (16Furuse M. Fujita K. Hiiragi T. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar, 17Morita K. Furuse M. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has not yet been defined how these novel proteins interact with occludin or other TJ components. However, as the protein architecture of the TJ is revealed, analysis of function of the TJ on a molecular basis becomes possible. The formation and maintenance of the TJ has been considered to be regulated not only by the specific proteins of cell-cell junctions but also by the perijunctional actin cytoskeleton (19Madara J.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 143-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Botulinum C3 toxin, which ADP-ribosylates and inactivates Rho, has been shown to disrupt perijunctional actin, resulting in TJ dysfunction in epithelial cells (20Nusrat A. Giry M. Turner J.R. Colgan S.P. Parkos C.A. Carnes D. Lemichez E. Boquet P. Madara J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10629-10633Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Also, mutants of RhoA and Rac1 disrupted TJ functions (21Jou T.S. Schneeberger E.E. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 101-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Thus, signaling pathways transduced by the Ras-related small GTPase Rho family members like Rho and Rac1, which control the actin cytoskeleton, have been implicated in the regulation of the TJ (see Refs. 19Madara J.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 143-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar and 22Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5242) Google Scholar), whereas involvement of downstream signaling events of Rho in TJ function is still lacking. Recently, several downstream targets of Rho have been identified (see Refs. 22Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5242) Google Scholar and 23Narumiya S. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Among these, p160ROCK/Rho kinase (24Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 25Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar), one of the key effectors of Rho, has been shown to be a serine-threonine kinase that is involved in the regulation of actin organization, cellular morphology, and cellular transformation (26Ishizaki T. Naito M. Fujisawa K. Maekawa M. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar,27Sahai E. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Treisman R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 136-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In this study, the basis of effects of inflammatory stimuli on TJ permeability was investigated. The role of the cytoskeleton and the possibility of direct effects on occludin were explored. Using ECV304 cells as a model system, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and histamine were found to increase the paracellular permeability of the tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP). LPA is a glycerophospholipid that is secreted from activated platelets, mediating tissue regeneration and wound healing (28Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), and can induce an increase in TJ permeability in brain endothelial cells (29Schulze C. Smales C. Rubin L.L. Staddon J.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Also, histamine causes vascular leakinessin vivo, but mechanisms are not completely clear yet (see Ref. 30McDonald D.M. Thurston G. Baluk P. Microcirculation. 1999; 6: 7-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because LPA activates Rho and its targets (22Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5242) Google Scholar, 28Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), the involvement of these was studied using a dominant-negative mutant of RhoA (RhoA T19N) considered to be the inactive GDP-bound form of RhoA (31Gebbink M.F.B.G. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P.G. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 32Kranenburg O. Poland M. Gebbink M. Oomen L. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2417-2427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a specific p160ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (25Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). Evidence is provided that TJ permeability is regulated by RhoA-p160ROCK-dependent and -independent mechanisms and that occludin is a target for receptor-initiated signaling events regulating its phosphorylation. All tissue culture materials were from Life Technologies, Inc. Gel electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad. HRP was from Sigma. Cytochalasin D and 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) were from Calbiochem. Other reagents used were of the highest grade commercially available. Y-27632 (25Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar), a specific inhibitor of p160ROCK, was a generous gift from WelFide (Osaka, Japan). Pervanadate was prepared as described previously (33Staddon J.M. Herrenknecht K. Smales C. Rubin L.L. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 609-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rat monoclonal antibody (MOC37) and rabbit polyclonal antibody were both raised against a fragment of occludin fused to glutathione S-transferase (34Saitou M. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Itoh M. Furuse M. Inazawa J. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 222-231PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-ZO-1 monoclonal antibody and the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The monoclonal antibody against RhoA was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). A purified polyclonal antibody recognizing Thr18- and Ser19-phosphorylated myosin light chain (MLC) was raised against the synthetic peptide RPQRApTpSNVFAMK (where p indicates phosphorylation), as described previously (35Ratcliffe M.J. Smales C. Staddon J.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). ECV304 cells were obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Salisbury, UK) and cultured at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in DME containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. RhoA T19N, from Professor Yoshimi Takai (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan), or LacZ was placed into pAdex1CAwt under a CA promoter comprising a cytomegalovirus enhancer and a chicken β-actin promoter (36Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4626) Google Scholar) to give pAdex RhoA T19N and pAdex LacZ, respectively. A recombinant adenovirus was constructed by in vitro homologous recombination in 293 cells using pAdex RhoA T19N or pAdex LacZ and the adenovirus DNA-terminal protein complex by a method previously described (37Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). After ECV304 cells had attained confluence, they were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing either LacZ or RhoA T19N. The viruses were diluted in serum-depleted medium at a multiplicity of infection of 30 particles/cell and incubated for 60 min. The viral suspension was removed by washing twice with serum-depleted DME, and the cells were cultured with serum-depleted DME for 48 h. ECV304 cells were seeded onto 0.4-μm polycarbonate Transwell filters (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA). After attaining confluence, the cells were incubated with serum-depleted DME with or without recombinant adenoviral gene transfer for 48 h. For pretreatment with compound, vehicle or Y-27632 at a final concentration of 10 μm was added, and the incubation was continued for 60 min. Medium was then replaced with fresh serum-free DME in the presence or absence of 10 μm Y-27632 and agonists at the indicated concentrations. To the upper chambers, HRP dissolved in serum-free DME was added to give a final concentration of 0.5 μm. The upper chambers contained 200 μl of medium, and the lower chambers contained 800 μl of medium. One hour after the start of the experiment, 50 μl of medium was collected from the lower chambers. The HRP content of the samples was evaluated spectrophotometrically by assaying peroxidase activity in buffer containing 0.5 mm guaiacol, 50 mmNa2HPO4, and 0.6 mmH2O2 and measuring absorbance at 470 nm. Data from five independent experiments, each in triplicate, are shown as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance, calculated using Student's t test, was taken as p < 0.001. All procedures were performed at room temperature. Cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After fixation, the cells were rinsed and permeabilized by incubation with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. After rinsing, the cells were blocked in 1% BSA in PBS for 15 min and incubated with 100 ng/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in blocking solution for 60 min. After the final rinse, the cells were mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) and examined using a AxioskopTMfluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) fitted with 100× objectives. Photographs were taken using 400 ASA T-MAX film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The protein content of samples was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Samples were resolved by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and then electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.2 μm pore size; ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). The membrane was subjected to immunoblotting as described previously (38Hirase T. Staddon J.M. Saitou M. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Itoh M. Furuse M. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. Rubin L.L. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 0.9 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2 and then lysed with boiling-hot SDS-IP buffer (25 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 4 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 1% SDS, 1 mmNa3VO4). After the lysates had been heated at 100 °C for 3 min and cooled, a 9-fold volume of ice-cold Nonidet P-40-IP buffer (25 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) was added. Lysates were passed 10 times through a 27-gauge needle and then gently mixed for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation (10,000 × g for 30 min), the supernatant was collected. For immunoprecipitation, 4 μl of anti-occludin polyclonal antibody and a 15-μl bed volume of GammaBind Plus Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to each sample and mixed for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times with 1 ml of Nonidet P-40-IP buffer, from which immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar) for 5 min. Samples were then separated by gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. After immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of Nonidet P-40-IP buffer and three times with 1 ml of either AP buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for alkaline phosphatase treatment or LP buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for λ protein phosphatase treatment. They were then resuspended in 100 μl of AP buffer or LP buffer and incubated with or without calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., Ohtsu, Japan) or with or without λ protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA), respectively. To block phosphatase activity, a phosphatase inhibitor mixture (100 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm NaF, 4 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4) was used. After a 1-h incubation at 30 °C with occasional mixing, beads were washed three times with 1 ml of Nonidet P-40-IP buffer and boiled with Laemmli sample buffer to elute the immunoprecipitates. Confluent cultures of ECV304 cells on 9-cm diameter dishes were rinsed twice with phosphate-free M199 containing 0.5% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. The cells were then incubated in 10 ml of this medium containing 1 mCi [32P]orthophosphate (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) for 4 h under an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Vehicle or factors were then added as required, and the incubation was continued for an additional 10 min. At 4 °C, the cultures were then rapidly rinsed twice in PBS (magnesium- and calcium-free) and lysed in 1 ml of extraction buffer containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 25 mm Hepes, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, pH 7.6 (adjusted with NaOH), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 units/ml α2-macroglobulin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The extracts were collected by scraping the dish and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. After preclearing with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), occludin was immunoprecipitated using 2.5 μg of anti-occludin antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) in the presence of protein A-Sepharose. The beads were washed five times with extraction buffer, and protein was eluted into Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide), and transferred to Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). [32P]Phosphate-labeled protein was detected by autoradiography, and occludin protein was then detected by probing the filters with the anti-occludin antibody. In this manner, after quantitation of band intensity by densitometry, the relative amount of radiolabeled phosphate per occludin protein could be estimated. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed on the labeled bands according to the procedures described previously (40Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T.

For two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, immunoprecipitated occludin from [32P]orthophosphate-labeled cells was solubilized in 50 μl of buffer containing 0.5% SDS, 0.1 mdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. The eluted occludin was then freeze-dried and redissolved in 50 μl of a solution containing 9.5m urea, 4% Triton X-100, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 2% Pharmalyte® 3.5–10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.05% bromphenol blue. Isoelectric focusing (400 V for 16 h) was performed in tube gels containing 9.5 m urea, 4% Triton X-100, 1% Pharmalyte 4–6.5, 1% Pharmalyte 5–8 in polymerized 3% acrylamide, 0.15% bisacrylamide. The proteins in the tube gels were then equilibrated in Laemmli sample buffer, transferred to slab gels, and resolved by SDS-PAGE (8% polyacrylamide). After transfer to nitrocellulose, [32P]phosphate incorporated into protein was detected by autoradiography, and signal corresponding to occludin protein was then revealed by subsequent immunoblotting of the filter with anti-occludin antibody. Phosphatase treatment of radiolabeled occludin was performed essentially as described by Meisenhelder and Hunter (41Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 288-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Thus, an immune complex containing occludin from [32P]orthophosphate-labeled cells was prepared as described above. To remove interfering salts and detergents, the beads (50-μl packed volume) were washed twice with 1 ml of wash buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 m NaCl, 25 mmHepes-NaOH, pH 7.4. They were then switched to phosphatase buffer by washing twice with a solution containing 20 mm Mes-NaOH, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, pH 5.5. The beads were then incubated with 50 μl of the phosphatase buffer in the absence or presence of 0.2 units of potato acid phosphatase (Calbiochem). Phosphatase activity was blocked as described (41Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 288-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). After 1 h at 37 °C, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold wash buffer. The suspension was briefly (<10 s) centrifuged to pellet the beads. Protein was eluted into Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose as described above. [32P]Phosphate incorporated into protein was detected by autoradiography, and occludin protein was revealed by immunoblotting. The effects of LPA on the TJ permeability of ECV304 cell monolayers were investigated by measuring paracellular flux of HRP. Using cultures on Transwell filters, HRP was added to the apical chambers in the presence or absence of LPA. HRP that passed via the paracellular pathway to enter the basolateral chamber was quantified by assaying peroxidase activity spectrophotometrically. The HRP activity detected was compared with that of control cells. As shown in Fig.1 a, LPA induced a greater flux of HRP in a dose-dependent manner. The involvement of RhoA was examined by using adenovirus-mediated overexpression of RhoA T19N, a dominant-negative mutant of RhoA. LacZ overexpression, confirmed by X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside) staining (data not shown), was used as a control. In these experiments, the increase in HRP flux in response to LPA was similar in noninfected cells and LacZ-overexpressing cells. In contrast, LPA failed to stimulate an increase in HRP flux in RhoA T19N-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1 b). Next, the role of p160ROCK was investigated using the specific p160ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (25Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with 10 μm Y-27632 blocked the increase in HRP flux induced by LPA (Fig. 1 b). These data indicate that RhoA and its target p160ROCK transduce the action of LPA to increase TJ permeability in ECV304 cells. The effects of histamine on HRP flux in ECV304 cells were then examined. Like LPA, histamine increased HRP flux in a dose-dependent manner in ECV304 cells (Fig.2 a). The roles of RhoA and p160ROCK were again studied. In noninfected cells and LacZ-overexpressing cells, histamine increased HRP flux to similar levels (Fig. 2 b). However, overexpression of RhoA T19N had no significant effect on the increase in HRP flux induced by histamine (Fig. 2 b). Also, inhibition of p160ROCK using Y-27632 failed to inhibit the increase in HRP flux in response to histamine (Fig.2 b). Thus, in contrast to the response to LPA, histamine appears to stimulate an increase in TJ permeability in ECV304 cells independently of RhoA and p160ROCK. To determine whether LPA and histamine caused changes in the actin cytoskeleton in ECV304 cells, F-actin was visualized by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Fig.3). In noninfected cells and LacZ-overexpressing cells as controls, pericellular actin bundles were seen, and stress fibers were hardly detectable in the cell bodies (Fig.3, a and b), whereas subtle reorganization of pericellular actin bundles was observed in RhoA T19N-overexpressing cells and cells pretreated with 10 μm Y-27632 (Fig. 3,c and d). Noninfected cells and LacZ-overexpressing cells that were treated with 1 μm LPA showed F-actin bundles in stress fibers and some gaps between cells (Fig. 3, e and f). In contrast, in the cells overexpressing RhoA T19N, LPA failed to induce F-actin bundles (Fig.3 g). Pretreatment with 10 μm Y-27632 also prevented stress fiber formation in response to LPA (Fig.3 h). Similar to the effect of LPA, 1 μm histamine induced F-actin bundles in stress fibers in noninfected cells and LacZ-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3, i and j). Both overexpression of RhoA T19N and pretreatment with Y-27632 also blocked formation of stress fibers in response to histamine (Fig. 3,k and l). These data show that LPA and histamine induce reorganization of pericellular actin bundles and stimulation of stress fiber formation in ECV304 cells and that both events are mediated by RhoA and p160ROCK. Although LPA and histamine clearly had effects on the actin-based cytoskeleton, the possibility of direct effects on TJ proteins was also explored. The main reason for this was because the cytoskeletal effects of histamine were blocked by inhibition of RhoA-p160ROCK signaling, whereas effects on TJ permeability were unaffected. By immunocytochemistry, it was shown that the localization of occludin or ZO-1 was not altered in response to either LPA or histamine (data not shown). The possibility of effects of LPA and histamine on biochemical changes in the TJ protein occludin was then examined. Occludin immunoprecipitates from cells stimulated with either LPA or histamine were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-occludin monoclonal antibody. This revealed that the electrophoretic mobility of occludin in gels was altered within minutes in response to both LPA and histamine in a dose-dependent manner. This alteration was visualized as a retarded mobility during SDS-PAGE (Fig.4, a and b). The dose dependences were similar to those that caused an increase in HRP flux (see Figs. 1 and 2). As a control, expression levels and electrophoretic mobility of ZO-1 were not changed in response to LPA or histamine (Fig. 4, a and b). The biochemical basis of the change in electrophoretic mobility of occludin was investigated. One possibility was that this was due to changes in phosphorylation of the protein. In initial experiments, cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and phosphorylation of occludin was examined after immunoprecipitation and resolution by SDS-PAGE. In control cells, phosphate incorporation into occludin was detected. However, after stimulation with histamine or LPA, even though a band shift in occludin was observed, an increase in phosphate labeling of the protein was not detected (Fig.5 a). The intensity of labeled bands was quantitated by densitometry, and similar results were obtained in other experiments. Amino acid residues phosphorylated in occludin were then characterized and investigated to see if these changed in response to cell stimulation. Both immunological and labeling procedures were used. Occludin immunoprecipitates from cells treated with either 1 μm LPA or 1 μmhistamine were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-occludin antibody, revealing the mobility shift, and then with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies PY20 or 4G10 (Fig. 5 b). As a control, cells were treated with pervanadate, a membrane-permeable peroxide derivative of vanada"

Autosomal recessive loci account for approximately 80% of nonsyndromic genetic deafness1. Here we report the identification of a new transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS3; also known as ECHOS1) expressed in many tissues, including fetal cochlea, which is mutated in the families used to describe both the DFNB10 and DFNB8 loci. An 8-bp deletion and insertion of 18 monomeric (∼68-bp) β-satellite repeat units, normally present in tandem arrays of up to several hundred kilobases on the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes, causes congenital deafness (DFNB10). A mutation in a splice-acceptor site, resulting in a 4-bp insertion in the mRNA and a frameshift, was detected in childhood onset deafness (DFNB8). This is the first description of β-satellite insertion into an active gene resulting in a pathogenic state, and the first description of a protease involved in hearing loss."

Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Proteins that pass through the folding process but are unable to acquire their proper conformation or cannot assemble with a respective binding partner are degraded rapidly. This process is known as ER-associated degradation or simply ER degradation (2McCracken A.A. Werner E.D. Brodsky J.L. Adv. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) were found to be subject to ER degradation. As found for the mammalian proteins destined for ER degradation, removal of these proteins requires the proteasome and in most cases an intact ubiquitin conjugation system (9Hiller M.M. Finger A.

Proteasomal substrates are usually tagged by repeated attachment of ubiquitin moieties through isopeptide bonds between the carboxyl-terminal glycine of ubiquitin and ε-amino groups of lysine residues within the substrate molecules (15Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6819) Google Scholar). A sequence of enzymatic reactions is necessary to link ubiquitin to protein substrates: after activation through an E1 enzyme via an ATP-requiring step, which leads to a thiol ester intermediate, ubiquitin is transferred to a cysteine thiol group of a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2. In a third step involving a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3), ubiquitin is linked by its carboxyl terminus to an ε-amino group of the target protein, forming an isopeptide linkage (15Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6819) Google Scholar). When studying the fate of mutated, soluble vacuolar CPY* and the mutated plasma membrane protein Pdr5*, we found both proteins to be polyubiquitinated via the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc6p and Ubc7p, whereby Ubc7p appeared to be the most prominent catalyst (9Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 10Plemper R.K. Egner R. Kuchler K. Wolf D.H. J. Biol.

The ubiquitin-protein ligase E3 participating in this process has remained a mystery. Genetic screens have uncovered a variety of new gene products embedded in the ER membrane which are necessary for ubiquitination and degradation of the respective proteins (13Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 16Knop M. Finger A. Braun T. Hellmuth K. Wolf D.H.

One of these proteins, Der1p, was shown up until now to be necessary only for ER-degradation of soluble, fully translocated CPY* (16Knop M. Finger A. Braun T. Hellmuth K. Wolf D.H.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4123-4134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Cue1p, Der3/Hrd1p, and Hrd3p have more general functions in the ER degradation process. Cue1p was discovered as to be a receptor for Ubc7p in the ER membrane, activating this ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (18Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. Science. 1997; 278: 1806-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The function of Der3/Hrd1p and Hrd3p have remained unknown so far.

Cell. 1998; 9: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). We have found previously that deletion of the RING-H2 domain or exchange of a single cysteine residue at position 399 against serine in the Der3/Hrd1 protein completely abolishes degradation of CPY* and Pdr5*, indicating the essentiality of this domain (10Plemper R.K.

We have furthermore shown that Der3/Hrd1p, Hrd3p, and Sec61p interact genetically, which led us to the proposal that these proteins formed both the retrotranslocon and an E3 complex (19Plemper R.K. Bordallo J. Deak P.M. Taxis C. Hitt R. Wolf D.H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4123-4134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we examine the topology of Der3/Hrd1p in the ER membrane viaN-glycosylation scanning and fusion of a topology-sensitive reporter protein domain to carboxyl-terminally truncated versions of the Der3/Hrd1 protein. We show that the carboxyl-terminally located RING-H2 domain of Der3/Hrd1p faces the cytoplasm. Altogether, RING finger-dependent ubiquitination of CPY* in vivoas well as self-ubiquitination of Der3/Hrd1p in vitro, and RING finger-dependent binding of Ubc7p identify Der3/Hrd1p as the ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) of the ER degradation process. Genetic experiments and molecular biological methods were carried out using standard protocols (29Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 1-792PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pRS315-DER3 was generated by subcloning a 3,570-base pairBamHI/HindIII fragment from plasmid YEpDER3 (17Bordallo J. Plemper R.K. Finger A. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol.

Fragments of theDER3 gene were PCR amplified from this plasmid using the oligonucleotide 5/6R (5′-gacggccagtgaattgtaat-3′) as the upstream primer and one each of the oligonucleotides DER3-Q37 (5′-cggcggctcgagttgcaaaaaggaaacgcttgtc-3′), DER3-E78 (5′-cggcggctcgagctcaataagcctcagttcacc-3′), DER3-R103 (5′-cggcggctcgagccgttcgtggaacagtg agg-3′), DER3-Q134 (5′-cggcggctcgagctgtaataaggcctccagcc-3′), DER3-Q176 (5′-cggcggctcgagttggtttgtatatatggaggag-3′), or DER3-D345 (5′-cggcggctcgagatcatttgcagaat tttgtagc-3′) as the downstream primer (XhoI sites are underlined). The PCR products were digested with SacI/XhoI and ligated with the SacI/XhoI fragment of plasmid pR90 (31Strahl-Bolsinger S. Scheinost A. J. Biol.

The carboxyl-terminal part of DER3 starting with cysteine 208 was PCR amplified using the primers DER3-GST1 (5′-ttcctagaattctgtttgaatttctgggaattt-3′) and DER3-GST2 (5′-taagtcgacacatgcaatctagatatgctggat-3′), digested withEcoRI/SalI (sites are underlined), and inserted into the GST expression vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), yielding plasmid pGEX-DER3.

To express the Hrd3-Cub fusion protein chromosomally, the resulting plasmid was linearized using the MamI site within the carboxyl-terminal HRD3 fragment and transformed into yeast strain JD53 (32Wittke S.

Transformants growing on SD plates supplemented with histidine but lacking uracil were tested for their ability to grow on minimal medium lacking uracil and containing 6 mm histidinol instead of histidine. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3–5 days. Immunoprecipitation and deglycosylation of the Der3-His4C fusion proteins were carried out as described (31Strahl-Bolsinger S. Scheinost A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9068-9075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) using polyclonal anti-invertase antiserum (R. Kölling, Düsseldorf). Yeast strain YPD41 (see above) was transformed with plasmid pNub-Der3 and a plasmid encoding a Nub-Sed5 fusion (32Wittke S. Lewke N. Muller S. Johnsson N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2519-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Transformants were grown overnight in SD medium lacking tryptophan, diluted with water, and spotted on minimal medium containing 1 mg/ml 5-FOA and 0.4 mm uracil. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3–4 days. The GST-Der3 fusion proteins were expressed from plasmids pGEX-DER3 and pGEX-DER3C399S in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST alone was expressed from plasmid pGEX-4T-1. Culturing of the cells and preparation of the bacterial protein extracts were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracts were incubated with 100 μl (bead volume) of gluthathione Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 3 h at 4 °C. Sepharose beads were collected (5 min at 3,000 rpm), washed three times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mmKCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3), and incubated at 4 °C overnight with whole cell extracts prepared from yeast strain W303-1C, carrying the plasmid pTX146 (18Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. Science. 1997; 278: 1806-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) encoding a Myc-tagged version of Ubc7p. Sepharose beads were collected and washed for 5 min with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 500 mmNaCl. Proteins from the supernatant and the wash fraction were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and dissolved in urea buffer. Proteins bound to the Sepharose matrix were then eluted with urea buffer by incubating at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were subjected to Western blot analysis using monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (Roche). Ubiquitination reactions were performed in 25 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm ATP, and 0.5 μg/μl ubiquitin (yeast, Sigma) and contained one or more of the following components as indicated in Fig. 6: 0.5 μg of E1 (yeast, Affiniti), 1 μg of E2 (human UBCH1, Affiniti), and approximately 1 μg of GST-Der3 fusion protein (see above). Incubation of the reactions for 60 min at 30 °C was followed by dilution with phosphate-buffered saline and precipitation of GST-Der3 species with Sepharose beads (3 h at 4 °C). The beads were collected, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and eluted with urea buffer. Samples were subjected to Western blot analysis using monoclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody (Calbiochem) or polyclonal anti-Der3 antiserum (17Bordallo J. Plemper R.K. Finger A. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), respectively. For in vivo ubiquitination of CPY*, HA-tagged ubiquitin was expressed from plasmid YEp112 (33Hochstrasser M. Ellison M.J. Chau V. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) by induction with copper as indicated in Fig. 5. The experiment was performed in aDER3 wild type strain (W303-1C) and a der3deletion strain (YJB009) expressing the C399S mutant of Der3p from plasmid YCpDER3C399S (17Bordallo J. Plemper R.K. Finger A. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and detection of ubiquitinated CPY* species were done as described previously (9Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis of complete cellular protein, 3A600 units of cells were subjected to alkaline lysis, and proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in urea buffer. Protein samples were separated on 6–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subjected to immunoblotting as described before (19Plemper R.K. Bordallo J. Deak P.M. Taxis C. Hitt R. Wolf D.H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4123-4134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of Der3/Hrd1p had indicated that the protein contains a hydrophobic amino-terminal region with five putative membrane domains and a long hydrophilic carboxyl-terminal tail containing the RING-H2 motif (13Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 17Bordallo J. Plemper R.K. Finger A. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Protease protection and immunolocalization experiments had localized the carboxyl-terminal RING-H2 finger domain to the lumen of the ER. However, because the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in charge, Ubc7p, as well as the proteasome reside in the cytoplasm, it was hard to reconcile the fact that the RING-H2 domain of the protein resided in the ER lumen with a function for Der3/Hrd1p as a ubiquitin-protein ligase, unless one assumed a process by which the carboxyl terminus with the RING-H2 domain and bound substrate reached back through the translocon into the cytoplasm of the cell (19Plemper R.K. Bordallo J. Deak P.M. Taxis C. Hitt R. Wolf D.H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4123-4134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore undertook a new set of experiments to localize the carboxyl-terminal RING finger domain of Der3/Hrd1p and to uncover the membrane topology of the protein. First we undertook anN-glycosylation scanning experiment. Der3/Hrd1p contains twoN-glycosylation sites at positions 58 and 137 of its sequence (17Bordallo J. Plemper R.K. Finger A. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). However, these sites are not accessible to the glycosylation machinery because they are predicted to be located in a transmembrane span and on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane, respectively. Therefore, we introduced a new potentialN-glycosylation site between the penultimate and last amino acid of Der3/Hrd1p as done with CPY* (34Plemper R.K. Deak P.M. Otto R.T. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). When expressing this modified Der3/Hrd1 protein either in a DER3 wild type or ader3 deletion background, no shift of the molecule to higher molecular mass was visible although a similarly modified CPY* molecule was shifted to higher molecular mass due to additional glycosylation (Fig. 1). This may indicate that the carboxyl terminus of the ER-localized Der3/Hrd1 protein does not reach the lumen of the organelle where core glycosylation occurs. However, this experiment does not give final proof for cytoplasmic localization of the carboxyl terminus of Der3/Hrd1p. We set up further experiments to prove this result and to elucidate the exact membrane topology of Der3/Hrd1p. The hydropathy profile of Der3/Hrd1p predicts the existence of five or six transmembrane domains (Fig. 2 A). We created fusion constructs of Der3/Hrd1p with a truncated version of the His4 protein (His4C) containing a fragment of invertase (Suc2p) which we used as topology-sensitive reporters. His4C harbors histidinol dehydrogenase activity and is translocated through the ER membrane when fused to a signal sequence (35Deshaies R.J. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Yeast his4 mutant strains expressing a His4C fusion are able to grow on minimal medium containing histidinol when the catalytic domain is present on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane. In this case, histidinol is metabolized to histidine resulting in a His+ phenotype. When the catalytic domain is targeted to the ER lumen, histidinol cannot be converted to histidine, leading to a His− phenotype. However, when located in the ER lumen, the protein becomes extensively glycosylated because of the presence of the SUC2 sequence and thus several glycosylation sites (31Strahl-Bolsinger S. Scheinost A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9068-9075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We constructed a series of fusion proteins consisting of carboxyl-terminally truncated versions of Der3/Hrd1p and the His4C protein domain (Fig. 2 A and TableI), which allowed us to identify the orientation of the transmembrane domains of Der3/Hrd3p and, in addition, the location of the carboxyl-terminal RING-H2 finger domain. The invertase sequence contained within these constructs also introduced an epitope for immunodetection, thus making it possible to visualize the fusion proteins using anti-invertase antibodies.Table IDer3/Hrd1-His4C fusion constructsDer3/Hrd1-His4C fusionMolecular massGrowth on histidinolGlycosylationDaDer3/Hrd1Q37126,398−+Der3/Hrd1E78131,138+−Der3/Hrd1R103134,233−+Der3/Hrd1Q134138,031+−Der3/Hrd1Q176142,828−+Der3/Hrd1D345162,548+−Der3/Hrd1-His4C fusion proteins were constructed as described. The invertase and His4C portion accounts for 122,084 Da of the total molecular mass of each Der3/Hrd1 fusion protein. The constructs carry 14 potential glycosylation sites, which increase the mass by 35,000 Da when the protein becomes N-glycosylated (31Strahl-Bolsinger S. Scheinost A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9068-9075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Growth on histidinol-containing medium and lack of N-glycosylation indicate that His4C faces the cytoplasm, whereas the absence of growth on histidinol and extensive glycosylation indicate an ER luminal orientation. Open table in a new tab Der3/Hrd1-His4C fusion proteins were constructed as described.

Growth on histidinol-containing medium and lack of N-glycosylation indicate that His4C faces the cytoplasm, whereas the absence of growth on histidinol and extensive glycosylation indicate an ER luminal orientation. We first determined the orientation of the amino terminus of Der3/Hrd1p using the fusion construct Der3/Hrd1Q37 containing the first transmembrane domain (Fig. 2 A and Table I). As can be seen in Fig. 2 B, Der3/Hrd1Q37 does not support growth on histidinol. Instead, the construct is heavily glycosylated; endoglycosidase H treatment reduces the molecular mass of the fusion protein considerably, leading to its calculated value (Fig.2 C, lanes 1 and 2). These results indicate that the amino terminus of Der3/Hrd1Q37 resides on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane. However, there is still the possibility that the first transmembrane region functions as a cleavable signal sequence or that the entire construct fully translocates into the ER lumen. The latter possibility is ruled out on the basis that Der3/Hrd1Q37 is detected in the fraction corresponding to the membrane pellet when anti-invertase antibodies are used. Der3/Hrd1Q37 cannot be solubilized with urea, high salt, or carbonate. Only after treatment with Triton X-100 was Der3/Hrd1Q37 transferred into the soluble fraction (data not shown). Furthermore, we had shown previously that Der3/Hrd1p genetically interacts with another ER membrane protein necessary for ER degradation,"

In this study, we have investigated in striatal primary cultures the mechanism by which activation of the cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway leads to CREB phosphorylation via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent pathway. We have found that PKA-induced CREB phosphorylation and CREB-dependent transcription are mediated by calcium (Ca2+) release from intracellular stores and are blocked by inhibitors of the protein kinase C and ERK pathways. This mechanism appears to be mediated by the small G-protein Rap1, whose activation appears to be primed by PKA-induced Ca2+ release but not further induced by direct or indirect PKA- or protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation. These results suggest that, in striatal neurons, intracellular Ca2+ release, Rap1, and ERK pathway play a crucial role in the PKA-induced CREB phosphorylation and CREB-dependent transcription.

The ERK pathway plays a pivotal role in stimulus-dependent gene regulation in the central nervous system, because pharmacological manipulations of the ERK pathway functionality affect the synaptic plasticity mechanisms supposed to underlie learning and memory (13Kornhauser J.M. Greenberg M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The cascade responsible of the ERK pathway activation requires the stimulus-dependent recruitment of the small G protein Ras, which in turn activates the Raf and MEK kinases. Although Ca2+-dependent activation of Ras has been demonstrated in several experimental models (14Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1207-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), in the central nervous system an alternative route to ERK activation via the cAMP/PKA- or Ca2+-dependent pathway has been recently characterized. This route implies the participation of the small G protein Ras-related Rap1 and the downstream kinase B-Raf (15Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.

The importance of the Rap1/B-Raf system in the cross-talk between the cAMP/PKA- and ERK-dependent pathways has received further attention by the recent identification of two novel families of Rap1GEF activated by direct binding to Ca2+ and cAMP (17deRooji J.

However, these results were obtained mainly in platelets and PC12 cells, rather than in primary neural cells, which might display distinct signal transduction pathways. Furthermore, the exact mechanism by which the cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway induces ERK activation and the role, if any, of Rap1 in CREB phosphorylation and CRE-dependent transcription have not yet been investigated. In an attempt to address these questions, in this study we have investigated the mechanisms involved in cAMP/PKA-dependent ERK activation, CREB phosphorylation, and CREdependent gene transcription in striatal neurons.

Tissue fragments were mechanically dissociated, and the cells were plated in 60-mm diameter poly-l-lysine-coated (10 μg/ml) dishes and grown in 1:1 minimal essential medium/F-12 medium containing 2 mm glutamine, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, and 2.5% horse serum. About 48 h after plating, 10 μm cytosine-C arabinoside was added to the cultures to prevent the growth of nonneuronal cells. The cells were grown for 6 days in vitrofor intracellular Ca2+ measurement experiments (see below) or 12 days in vitro for all other experiments. The total percentage of glial cells was below 5%, as assessed by glial fibrillary acid protein staining and counterstaining with 1% cresyl violet. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were rinsed twice with Krebs buffer and then left for 20 min in Krebs buffer before stimulation with the indicated agents. In the experiments with BAPTA-AM, the cells were preincubated for the indicated time with BAPTA-AM and then incubated with stimulating agents in Krebs buffer. Experiments in which the role of excitatory amino acids was studied were performed in the presence of 1 μmtetrodoxin to block action potentials and excitatory amino acid release. The intracellular Ca2+ concentration was measured with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2/AM. Striatal cells, prepared as described above, were plated at low density into 24-well multiwell plates containing 13-mm glass coverslips previously coated with 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine. After 6 days in vitro, cells were washed twice with Krebs buffer and then incubated in the same buffer containing 5 μm fura-2/AM at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 for 30 min, followed by a postincubation period in the same buffer for 30 min. The dye-loaded cells were epi-illuminated with light from a 75-watt xenon lamp filtered through 340- and 380-nm interference filters, and the fluorescence emitted at 510 nm was revealed by a photon-counting photomultiplier. The 340/380-nm fluorescence ratio, averaged over a period of 2 s, was measured for 10 min in the Krebs buffer, and this value was taken as basal reference value. The stimulating agents were added as 10× concentrated solution, and then changes in the 340/380-nm ratio were monitored for the time indicated in Fig.9. For each experimental condition, fluorescence responses were taken in at least three fields on each coverslip. The pull-down assay for the determination of Rap1 activation was carried out as previously reported (19Seidel M.G. Klinger M. Freissmuth M. Holler C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25833-25841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly, the GST fusion protein of the minimal Rap1-binding domain of ralGDS (ral-RBD) was induced in Escherichia coli (strain BL21DE3) by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and bacterial lysates were prepared as described (19Seidel M.G. Klinger M. Freissmuth M. Holler C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25833-25841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The GST fusion protein was immobilized by incubating the bacterial lysate for 1 h at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose preequilibrated in pull-down buffer (50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Sepharose beads were washed three times to remove excess GST fusion protein. After stimulation with agonists for 10 min, the cells were rinsed twice with stimulation buffer and then chilled immediately in pull-down buffer, and then cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Approximately 5% of the total cell lysate was analyzed to normalize for the total amount of Rap1. The remaining supernatant (about 500 μg of proteins) was incubated with the GST-Sepharose beads (50 μl of a 1:1 slurry containing about 10 μg of immobilized GST fusion protein) for 2 h to allow for the association of activated Rap1 with the effector-GST fusion protein. Samples were washed twice with pull-down buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The Rap1 band was then visualized using specific antibodies in a 1:1000 dilution by immunoblot analysis (see below). Stimulated cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 400 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysate were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated for 15 h at 4 °C with primary antibodies and then with 15 μl of protein A-agarose for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and resuspended either in SDS-sample buffer for immunoblot experiments or in kinase buffer for immunocomplex protein kinase assay (see below). Western blot analysis was carried out either on 20 μg of nuclear extracts (for phosphorylated CREB, phosphorylation state-independent CREB, and p90RSK), 20 μg of total cell lysate (for phosphorylated ERK and phosphorylation state-independent ERK), or immunoprecipitates for PYK2. Proteins resolved by 12.5% (PCREB, CREB, ERK, and PERK) or 7% (PYK2 and p90RSK) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by tank blotting overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were rinsed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (composition 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20), incubated for 1 h in TBS containing 4% nonfat dry milk (TBSM), and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in TBSM. After three 15-min washes in TBS, the membranes were incubated in TBSM for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG for rabbit polyclonal primary antibodies, or with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat polyclonal anti-mouse IgG for mouse monoclonal primary antibodies. The chemiluminescent signals were detected using the Super signal kit, and the films were scanned using an Agfa T1200 scanner with Photolook software. The band intensity was quantified with NIH Image software. The same protocol was used for the detection of tyrosine-phosphorylated PYK2 using the mouse monoclonal antibody specific to phosphotyrosine PY20, except that 1% bovine serum albumin was used instead of 4% nonfat dry milk. Cells were preincubated with protein kinase inhibitors as reported in the figure legends and then stimulated with the indicated agents. In vitro PKA and PKC activities were performed as previously reported (18Paolillo M. Montecucco A. Zanassi P. Schinelli S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 1937-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Paolillo M. Feliciello A. Porcellini A. Garbi C. Bifulco M. Schinelli S. Ventra C. Stabile E. Ricciardelli G. Schettini G.

Striatal cultures were treated with appropriate stimuli for the indicated time and rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The RNA extraction reagent Trizol was added directly to each culture dish. Total RNA was extracted with a 1:10 volume of chloroform, and the upper aqueous phase was precipitated overnight at −20 °C with a 1:1 volume of isopropyl alcohol. Total RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C, washed twice with ethanol, and quantified by UV spectrophotometry at 260 nm. Total RNA (10 μg) was size-resolved on a 1.1% denaturing agarose gel containing 1 mparaformaldehyde in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 5 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA and capillary-blotted overnight in 10× SSC onto a positively charged Hybond nylon membrane. The membranes were UV-autocross-linked and then prehybridized for 1 h at 65 °C in 0.5 msodium-phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA. Hybridization was carried out for 16 h at 65 °C in 50 ml of prehybridization solution to which about 1 × 106cpm/ml of a full-length cDNA c-fos or 18 S ribosomal gene (internal loading control) cDNA random primed32P-labeled probes were added. Membranes were washed three times for 2 min in 300 ml of prewarmed (65 °C) washing solution (50 mmNa2HPO4-NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 1% SDS) and once in 100 ml of the same solution on a shaking platform for 30 min at 65 °C. The radioactivity associated with the membranes was visualized and quantified with a Cyclone storage phosphor system (Packard Instrument Co.). Results are expressed as mean ± S.E., and the significance of differences among treatments was evaluated using Student's t test for paired data or analysis of variance by Dunnett's test. The striatum is the brain area with the most abundant dopaminergic innervation, and striatal neurons in primary cultures express all of the dopaminergic receptor subtypes. We first sought to determine which receptor subtypes and signal transduction pathways are involved in CREB phosphorylation induced by the neurotransmitter dopamine in cultured striatal neurons. Dopaminergic regulation of Ser133 CREB phosphorylation was investigated by using selective agonists and antagonists specific for the D1-like and D2-like dopaminergic receptor subtypes. Dopamine-induced increase in Ser133 CREB phosphorylation (2.1 ± 0.2-fold basal level, n = 4) was mimicked by the D1-like receptor agonist SKF38393, not affected by the D2-like receptor antagonist sulpiride, and blocked by the D1-like antagonist SCH 23390 (Fig.1A). To confirm the involvement of cAMP and to rule out any possible G protein-dependent activation of cAMP-independent signal transduction pathways, CREB phosphorylation was stimulated by agents capable of increasing cAMP formation downstream of dopamine receptors. The membrane-permeable cAMP analogue 8-CPT (200 μm) and the direct activator of adenylylcyclase forskolin (20 μm) induced a significant increase (3.2 ± 0.5-fold basal level,n = 4) of CREB phosphorylation, similar to that induced by 100 μm dopamine. The recent characterization of a family of cAMP-binding proteins that directly activates the Ras-like Rap1 protein (21Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar), raises the possibility that the forskolin-induced CREB phosphorylation might be mediated by a cAMP-dependent but PKA-independent mechanism; this mechanism seems unlikely under our conditions, since forskolin-induced CREB phosphorylation was blocked by the PKA inhibitors KT5720 and H89 (Fig. 1B). In different experimental models (16Grewal S.S. Horgan A.M. York R.D. Withers G.S. Banker G.A. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3722-3728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 22Roberson E.D. English J.D. Adams J.P. Selcher J.C. Kondratick C. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4337-4348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the activation of the cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway leads to activation of the ERK pathway. To assess whether this cross-talk occurs in cultured striatal neurons, we performed a set of experiments using a phosphospecific antibody directed against the dually phosphorylated ERK isoforms ERK1 and ERK2. We found that DA and forskolin stimulated predominantly the phosphorylation of the ERK p42 isoform ERK2 (FSK: 4.5 ± 0.8-fold over basal level, n = 4; DA: 3.2 ± 0.5-fold over basal level, n = 4), and this effect was PKA-dependent, being reduced by the PKA inhibitor H89 (Fig. 2). PKA-induced activation of the ERK pathway was an intermediate step in PKA-induced CREB phosphorylation, since the ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 strongly blocked CREB phosphorylation induced by forskolin and dopamine (Fig. 3). In previous in vitrokinase assays, we found that, under our experimental conditions, the effect of PD98059 was specific for the ERK pathway and did not interfere with the activity of other kinases such as PKA and CaMKs (data not shown).Figure 3Forskolin- and dopamine-inducedCREBphosphorylation is mediated byMEK. Cells were preincubated for 30 min with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm) and then left untreated (−) or stimulated (+) for 10 min with forskolin (FSK, 20 μm) or with dopamine (DA, 100 μm). CREB phosphorylation in nuclear extracts was analyzed as described in the legend of Fig. 1. Data are reported as P-CREB/CREB immunoreactivity (IR), and the average -fold increase (mean ± S.E.) over basal level is reported in thebar graph (n = 4). *,p < 0.05 compared with the correspondent stimulus without inhibitor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since in the hippocampus the ERK pathway could be activated by PKC (22Roberson E.D. English J.D. Adams J.P. Selcher J.C. Kondratick C. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4337-4348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the role of this kinase in cAMP/PKA-induced CREB phosphorylation. The PKC inhibitor bisindoleylmaleimide I strongly reduced DA- and FSK-induced ERK2 and CREB phosphorylation (Fig.4A); the same results were obtained using two other specific PKC inhibitors, chelerythrine chloride and Gö6976 (Fig. 4B). In vitrokinase assays demonstrated that, under our experimental conditions, PKC inhibitors blocked PKC activity but did not interfere with nuclear PKA activity (Fig. 4C). To further confirm a causal relationship between PKC activation and ERK2/CREB phosphorylation, we investigated the functional consequence of short and long term treatment of striatal cells with the direct PKC activator PMA on ERK and CREB phosphorylation. When cells were stimulated for 10 min with 1 μm PMA to activate PKC, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 blocked both PMA-induced ERK2 and CREB phosphorylation (Fig.5A). Accordingly, when cells were treated for 18 h with 10 nm PMA to desensitize PKC, forskolin-induced ERK2 and CREB phosphorylation were significantly reduced, as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these experiments strongly suggest that PKA causes CREB phosphorylation via a PKC/ERK-dependent pathway.Figure 5Activation ofPKCinduces ERK2 andCREBphosphorylation.A, cells were preincubated for 30 min with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm) and then left untreated (−) or stimulated (+) for 10 min with PMA (1 μm). P-CREB and P-ERK2 phosphorylation was analyzed as described in the legends of Figs. 1 and Fig. 2, respectively. Data are reported as P-ERK2/ERK2 or P-CREB/CREB immunoreactivity (IR), and the average -fold increase (mean ± S.E.) over basal is reported in the bar graph (n = 4). *,p < 0.05 compared with the correspondent stimulus without inhibitor. B, cells were left untreated (−) or pretreated for 18 h with 10 nm PMA (desPKC) to desensitize PKC. Then cells were left untreated (−) or stimulated (+) for 10 min with forskolin (FSK, 20 μm). P-CREB and P-ERK2 phosphorylation was analyzed as described in the legends of Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. Data are reported as P-ERK2/ERK2 or P-CREB/CREB immunoreactivity (IR), and the average -fold increase (mean ± S.E.) over basal level is reported in the bar graph(n = 4). *, p < 0.05 compared with forskolin in PMA-untreated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies have shown that neuronal Ca2+ represents a link between the ERK- and PKA-dependent pathways (16Grewal S.S.

These observations prompted us to investigate the Ca2+requirement in PKA-induced CREB phosphorylation mediated by ERK in striatal neurons; a set of experiments was performed using the cell-permeable intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM. When neurons were preincubated with BAPTA-AM (50 μm) for 30 min, both ERK2 (Fig. 6A) and CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 6B) induced by forskolin were significantly reduced. Having established the requirement of Ca2+ in PKA-mediated CREB phosphorylation, we then analyzed the possible involvement of L-type Ca2+ channels and NMDA receptors in this mechanism. Both L-type Ca2+ channels and NMDA receptors have been previously shown to be involved in CREB phosphorylation and CRE-dependent gene expression (7Das S. Grunert M. Williams L. Vincent S.R. Synapse. 1997; 25: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Preincubation of striatal cells with the competitive NMDA antagonist APV or the noncompetitive NMDA antagonist MK-801 did not interfere with forskolin-induced CREB phosphorylation (Fig.7A). This finding clearly demonstrates that in striatal neurons NMDA receptors are not responsible for the intracellular Ca2+ elevation required in forskolin-induced CREB phosphorylation. In a subset of striatal neurons, PKA-induced phosphorylation of the L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel increases the peak current through these channels, thereby augmenting the amount of Ca2+ entering the cell (23Surmeier D.J. Bargas J. Hemmings H.C. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 385-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether extracellular Ca2+ was required for PKA-induced CREB phosphorylation in striatal neurons. To our surprise, we found that neither the extracellular Ca2+ chelator EGTA nor the specific L-type voltage-dep"

Human MAPK 5 (ERK5) or Big MAP kinase 1 (BMK1) is a recently cloned member of the MAPK family. To identify ERK5-related kinases, we searched the GenBank™ expressed sequence tag (EST) data base for mouse cDNAs with homology to human ERK5. A full-length mouse cDNA that was highly homologous to the human ERK5 was identified. Further analysis of ERK5 polymerase chain reaction products generated from mouse embryo cDNA yielded three mouse ERK5 cDNAs (mERK5a, mERK5b, and mERK5c). Sequence analysis showed that these cDNAs are alternative splice products of the mouse ERK5 gene. Interestingly, expressed mERK5b and mERK5c act as dominant negative inhibitors based on inhibition of mERK5a kinase activity and mERK5a-mediated MEF2C transactivation. However, the physiological significance of mERK5b and mERK5c is not fully understood. Further investigation using these mouse ERK5 splice variants and other constructed mutants identified functional roles of several regions of mERK5, which appear to be important for protein-protein interaction and intracellular localization. Specifically, we found that the long C-terminal tail, which contains a putative nuclear localization signal, is not required for activation and kinase activity but is responsible for the activation of nuclear transcription factor MEF2C due to nuclear targeting. In addition, the N-terminal domain spanning amino acids (aa) 1–77 is important for cytoplasmic targeting; the domain from aa 78 to 139 is required for association with the upstream kinase MEK5; and the domain from aa 140–406 is necessary for oligomerization. Taken together, these observations indicate that ERK5 is regulated by distinct mechanisms determined by its unique structure and presumably the presence of multiple splice variants.

MAPKs are activated by phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues in a Thr-X-Tyr (TXY) motif involving upstream dual-specificity protein kinases (MAPK kinases) and phosphatases. The TXY activation motif is used to classify the MAPK superfamily into three main groups. The TEY (Thr-Glu-Tyr) group consists of extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1/2, ERK5, and ERK7. The TPY (Thr-Pro-Tyr) family consists of JNK/SAPK (5Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). The TGY (Thr-Gly-Tyr) family includes p38 and ERK6. Each MAPK pathway generally consists of three kinase modules composed of a MAPK, a MAPK kinase (MAPKK), and a MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK) (12Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). These kinase modules are differentially activated by a variety of cellular stimuli and contribute to distinct cellular function (13Takahashi M. Berk B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2623-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The ERK1/2 module includes Raf isoforms, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, which are highly responsive to mitogenic signals such as growth factors and cytokines. In contrast, JNK/SAPK and p38 are stress-sensitive pathways activated by MEK 4/7 and MEK3/6, respectively. ERK5 is specifically activated by MEK5 (14Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J.

Human ERK5 contains 816 amino acid residues with a primary structure distinct from other MAPK members. ERK5 has a unique long C-tail and a distinct loop-12 domain. ERK5 is activated by reactive oxygen species (15Abe J. Kusuhara M. Ulevitch R.J. Berk B.C. Lee J.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Most recently, it has been shown that ERK5 is required for EGF-induced cell proliferation and progression through the cell cycle (17Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Although ERK5 has a TEY motif in its dual phosphorylation site similar to ERK1/2 and ERK7, several studies have shown that ERK5 has different upstream activators and downstream substrates compared with other MAPKs. In the present study, we report the identification of three alternatively spliced mouse ERK5 cDNAs, termed mERK5a, mERK5b, and mERK5c. The putative protein sequences deduced from these three cDNAs are identical except in their N-terminal regions. mERK5b and mERK5c lack N-terminal 69 amino acids and 139 amino acids, respectively, compared with mERK5a. It is likely that the variations in N-terminal sequences are produced by alternatively choosing different splicing donors and acceptors within a single intron. More interestingly, mERK5b and mERK5c, which are catalytically inactive, act as dominant negative kinases. Finally, by using N- or C-terminal truncated mERK5, we found that three N-terminal domains spanning aa 1–77, aa 78–139, and aa 140–406 are important for cytoplasmic targeting, association with the upstream kinase MEK5, and oligomerization, respectively. The C-terminal tail is essential for the biological activity of ERK5 in vivo by mediating nucleus translocation, which is dependent upon the NLS in the C-terminal region. These observations should help us understand the biological reasons for this diversity in ERK5 and may provide new approaches to modify ERK5 signaling. The GenBank™ expressed sequence tag (EST) data base was searched using the program BLAST with amino acid sequences corresponding to the human ERK5. Several EST fragments displayed high degrees of amino acid homology. Among them, a full-length mouse clone was obtained from Genome Systems Inc (GenBank™ accession number AA288345). A manual sequencing method with the Sequetherm Cycle sequencing kit (Epicentre Technologies Corp.) was used to sequence this clone according to the manufacturer's protocols. Several PCR fragments were found in the first-strand cDNAs of a mouse embryo (purchased from CLONTECH) and were subcloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen) for sequencing. Combining analysis of mouse ERK5 RT-PCR clones with mouse EST clones, three mouse ERK5 cDNAs were identified. To determine the mechanism for generating three mouse ERK5 isoforms, a mouse genomic DNA fragment encompassing the mouse ERK5 isoforms splicing junction was isolated by PCR amplification using oligonucleotides 5′-ACGAGTACGAGATCATCGAGACC-3′ and 5′-GGTCACCACATCAAAAGCATTAGG-3′. Clones for mouse ERK5a (nucleotides 10–2776), ERK5b (nucleotides 280–2826), and ERK5c (nucleotides 837–3196) were subcloned into the multiple cloning regions of the pcDNA3.1/His vectors (Invitrogen). All isoforms were fused in-frame with an N-terminal Xpress tag. mERK5a(-tail) (aa 1–406) was constructed by removing aa 407–806 with PstI digestion. GFP-tail and GFP-NLS were generated by ligation of the PCR-amplified C-tail (aa 407–806) and NLS fragment (aa 505–539), respectively, containing the artificial restriction sites BamHI andEcoRI to the pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH) cut with BamHI and EcoRI. mERK5a(-NLS), lacking aa 505–539, was generated by PCR with the Expand High-Fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, an antisense primer matching the DNA sequence upstream of the codon aa 505 and a sense primer downstream of the codon aa 539 were generated. PCR reaction was performed using the entire mERK5a in the PcDNA3.1/His vector as the template, and the PCR product was treated with T4 DNA polymerase to create a blunt end. Purified PCR product was further treated with polynucleotide kinase and T4 ligase and subsequently transformed into the competent bacterial DH5α. CHO-K1 were maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc) supplemented with 10% calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transiently transfected at 50–80% confluence using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and harvested 48 h after transfection. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 0.2 ml of TME lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF) containing fresh 100 μm Na3VO4, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmdithiothreitol (18Liao D.F. Monia B. Dean N. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6146-6150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared by scraping, sonication, and centrifugation. Mouse embryos (15 day) were homogenized in 2.0 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 100 μm Na3VO4, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 500 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell fractionation was performed by extraction with different buffer and sequential centrifugation. First, cells were lysed in the TME lysis buffer contain 0.1% Triton X-100, and the cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was collected as the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was then resuspended in the lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was collected as the nuclear fraction. The pellet was further resuspended in the RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was collected as the cytoskeleton fraction, and the pellet was resuspended in sample buffer as the nuclear fraction. Cell lysates, cellular fractionates, or tissue extracts were boiled in the presence of 1× sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue) and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was blocked for 1–2 h at room temperature with a commercial blocking buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.). The blot was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the primary antibody (anti-Xpress antibody from Invitrogen), followed by incubation for 1 h with secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immune complex kinase assays were performed with ectopically expressed tagged ERK5 proteins from CHO-K1 cells as previously described (19Levesque M.J. Nerem R.M. J. Biomech. Eng. 1985; 107: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), except 2 μg of MBP was used per reaction in kinase buffer. Proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose, and subjected to autoradiography. The presence of epitope-tagged proteins in immunoprecipitates was verified by Western analysis with antibody against the tag. Total RNA was prepared from multiple adult mouse tissues and mouse embryos (15 days) using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed corresponding to splicing junction sequences of three cDNAs: the sense primer 5′-ACGAGTACGAGATCATCGAGACC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GGTCACCACATCAAAAGCATTAGG-3′. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized by Superscript II reverse-transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) with antisense primer. The amplification was carried out in a 100-μl mixture containing 2 μl of the first-strand cDNA product, 10 μm each of the sense and antisense primer, and 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The PCR reaction was performed as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min and 30 cycles of amplification (denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 2 min, extension at 72 °C for 2 min), followed by a final extension step of 10 min at 72 °C. Reactions were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel. The MEF2C fusion activator vector, encoding the GAL4-binding domain fused to MEF2C activation domain (14Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), was cotransfected into CHO-K1 cells along with the GAL4-responsive reporter plasmid pG5E1bLUC, which contains five GAL4 sites cloned upstream of a minimal promoter driving a luciferase gene (14Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). For transfection, CHO-K1 cells (0.2 × 106 cells per well) were seeded into 24-well plates the day before transfection. Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of DNA in total per well using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies). After 5 h, the transfection was stopped by adding equal volume of DMEM/F-12 (10% fetal bovine serum). After 24 h, the medium was changed to a serum-free DMEM/F-12 for an additional 24 h. Then cells were collected for luciferase assay. In the cases of testing the endogenous ERK5, 10% serum was added and the cells were incubated for an additional 4 h before harvesting. A green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression vector (pEGFP-N1, from CLONTECH) was used to control for transfection efficiency. The total amount of DNA for each well was kept constant using the empty vector pcDNA3.1/His (Invitrogen). Luciferase assays were performed with a Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as instructed. Briefly, cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer at room temperature for 15 min with shaking. 50 μl of cell extracts was transferred into a 96-well microtiter plate. The fluorescence intensity of GFP was measured using a Wallace multicounter (Wallace). 50 μl of luciferase substrate were then added to the cell lysates, and the luciferase activities were determined by measuring luminescence intensity using the same Wallace multicounter. To correct for transfection efficiency, the luciferase activity was divided by the green fluorescence intensity. CHO-K1 cells, grown on LabTek II chamber slides, were cotransfected with Xpress-tagged ERK constructs in the presence of either pCDNA3 vector or MEK5(D). Following the transfection for 48 h, the cells were then fixed in 10% formalin in PBS for 15 min, washed, blocked, and incubated with anti-Xpress antibody at a 1:2000 dilution. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, the cells were washed and then incubated with fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Vector) at a 1:200 dilution. The stained cells were analyzed under an Olympus Fluoview confocal microscope. To identify mouse ERK5 cDNAs, the EST data base was searched, and several EST clones with high homology to human ERK5 were found. Among these, a full-length EST cDNA clone (AA288345) was purchased and sequenced. Comparing this sequence with the published human ERK5 sequence (8Lee J.D. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 9Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), we found that this cDNA clone contained an insert as well as an in-frame stop codon within the insert. This suggested that multiple ERK5 cDNAs might exist. To confirm the presence of diverse species of ERK5 cDNAs in the mouse, mouse embryo first-strand cDNA (fromCLONTECH) was used for PCR with primers from conserved regions of human and mouse ERK5. Sequence analysis showed that at least three different ERK5 cDNAs were present, which we will designate as mERK5a, mERK5b, and mERK5c (Fig.1 A). mERK5a is the mouse cDNA most homologous to human ERK5. mERK5b and mERK5c cDNAs contain one or two inserts compared with mERK5a, respectively. Although mERK5b has a 50-bp insert (I-1) (Fig. 1 A), mERK5c, which corresponds to the mouse EST clone mentioned above, contains both the 50-bp (I-1) insert found in mERK5b and a 91-bp (I-2) insert (Fig. 1 A). Both inserts start with consensus splice donor “gt,” and the second insert (I-2) ends with an acceptor sequence “ag,” suggesting that they are likely to be intron sequences that were not spliced out. To explore the mechanism for producing these three different mouse ERK5 cDNAs, PCR and sequencing of the mouse genomic DNA flanking the splicing region of the ERK5 gene was performed. The genomic structure of the splicing junction of mouse ERK5 gene is shown in Fig. 1 B. Sequence analysis of genomic DNA showed an additional 429-bp (I-3) insert with consensus “gt/ag” just after I-2. It is likely that the variations in N-terminal sequences are produced by alternatively choosing different splicing donors and acceptors within a single intron that is composed of I-1, I-2, and I-3. mERK5a is likely generated by use of the splicing donor D1 and the acceptor A2, whereas mERK5b is generated by use of D2 and A2 and mERK5c is generated by use of D3 and A2. The I-1 intron introduces a stop codon and causes mERK5b and mERK5c to have shorter N termini than mERK5a. mERK5a contains a putative open reading frame (ORF) from nucleotide 27 to nucleotide 2447 that encodes a protein of 806 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 88 kDa, whereas mERK5b (putative ORF: nucleotides 284–2497) contains 737 amino acid with a predicted molecular mass of 80 kDa and mERK5c (putative ORF: nucleotide 864–2867) consists of 667 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 73 kDa. The predicted N-terminal amino acid sequences for the three isoforms of ERK5 are shown in Fig.2 A. It is important to note that mERK5b and mERK5c lack the GXGXXG domain for ATP binding, which is present in mERK5a (underlined in Fig.2 A). Further characterization of the mouse ERK5 protein sequence with currently available profile data bases resulted in the identification of a proline-rich region and a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the C-terminal domain (Fig. 2 B). The proline-rich region and the NLS are located at aa 578–690 and aa 505–539, respectively. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of mouse ERK5a with human ERK5 showed 91% homology to human ERK5 (Fig.2 B). Many functional domains important for kinase activity, including the TEY phosphorylation site, are conserved between human and mouse ERK5. The major differences between human and mouse ERK5 occur in a small portion of the N terminus and the proline-rich region in the C terminus. To confirm the existence of the three forms of mouse ERK5 mRNAs, we performed RT-PCR with a different source of mouse embryo mRNA. Three bands corresponding to PCR products from the three recombinant cDNAs were detected (Fig.3 A). To determine the presence of three mouse ERK5 mRNAs in adult mouse tissues and examine tissue-specific expression, RT-PCR was performed for multiple adult mouse tissues. PCR products encoding the three mouse ERK5 mRNAs were detected in all mouse adult tissues examined (Fig.3 B). To confirm the presence of the endogenous protein products corresponding to the three splice variants, we used a polyclonal antibody against ERK5, which was made using amino acids EGHGMNPADIESLQREIQMDSPML of the human ERK5 as antigen. This human ERK5 peptide is 100% similar to the corresponding amino acids of the three mouse isoforms. Preliminary data showed that it recognized mouse and human ERK5 equally well. Immunoblotting of mouse embryonic proteins revealed three distinct bands (Fig. 3 C) with the molecular weights corresponding to mERK5a, mERK5b, and mERK5c, respectively. Relative protein levels of three splice variants are consistent with their relative mRNA levels, mERK5a > mERK5c > mERK5b. Because mERK5b and mERK5c lack the GXGXXG domain required for ATP binding, it is very likely that mERK5b and mERK5c have no kinase activity. To further explore the function of mERK5b and mERK5c, phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (MBP) was evaluated by anin vitro kinase assay. Immunoprecipitated mERK5a, isolated from the cells coexpressing constitutively active MEK5(D), rapidly phosphorylated MBP (Fig. 4). In contrast, mERK5b and mERK5c failed to phosphorylate MBP, which is similar to results using human dominant negative ERK5 (DN-hERK5) (14Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that mERK5b and mERK5c act as dominant negative isoforms, mERK5b or mERK5c were cotransfected with mERK5a and kinase assays were performed. As shown in the last two lanesof Fig. 4, mERK5b inhibited mERK5a kinase activity. mERK5c behaved in a similar manner (data not shown). Because the transactivation of the transcription factor MEF2C is stimulated by human ERK5-induced phosphorylation (14Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), we measured MEF2C activity as a means to determine the kinase activities of different ERK5 isoforms. Utilizing fusion proteins containing the transactivation domain of MEF2C fused to the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4, we were able to assess the effects of the mouse ERK5 isoforms on the activity of transcription factor MEF2C fusion protein. This was done by measuring the luciferase activity from CHO-K1 cells cotransfected with a construct containing five copies of the GAL4-binding site upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. As expected, MEF2C-dependent reporter gene expression was enhanced dramatically when mERK5a and MEK5(D) were cotransfected into CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 5 A). mERK5b and mERK5c, similar to DN-hERK5, did not stimulate MEF2C activity (Fig.5 A). The same results were observed after extracellular stimulation with 10% serum (Fig. 5 B). To further demonstrate that mERK5b and mERK5c behave as dominant negative forms, we coexpressed mERK5b, mERK5c, or DN-hERK5 with mERK5a. Introduction of mERK5b (Fig. 5 C) and mERK5c (Fig. 5 D), similar to DN-hERK5 (Fig. 5 E), inhibited mERK5a-induced MEF2C-dependent reporter gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. mERK5b and mERK5c also dose-dependently inhibited MEF2C activation by endogenous ERK5 after stimulation with 10% serum (Fig. 5 F). These results suggest that mERK5b and mERK5c may function as dominant negative inhibitors of the ERK5 signaling pathway. To determine the role of the N-terminal region, which is absent in mERK5b and mERK5c, we examined the subcellular distribution of different ERK5 isoforms by cell fractionation and Western blotting of lysates from cells expressing epitope-tagged mERK5s. In the unstimulated cells, we observed that mouse mERK5a and human hERK5 were present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus with the majority in the cytoplasm (Fig.6). However, mERK5b and mERK5c were exclusively present in the nucleus. There was no detectable mERK5a, mERK5b, and mERK5c expression in the membrane and cytoskeleton fractions (data not shown). These results suggest that the N-terminal domain spanning aa 1–77 is important for cytoplasmic targeting of mERK5a. Because the protein sequence analysis of ERK5 uncovered several interesting domains, we further investigated the roles of these regions. ERK5 has a unique 400-amino acid long C-terminal tail whose function is not known. To determine whether the C-terminal domain of ERK5 plays a role in regulating ERK5 kinase activity, an Xpress-tagged ERK5 truncated at Gln-406, termed mERK5a(-tail), was generated. When mERK5a(-tail) and ERK2 amino acid sequences are aligned, the length of mERK5a(-tail) is comparable to that of ERK2. To test whether mERK5a(-tail) was catalytically active, an in vitro kinase assay using MBP as a substrate was performed. Using MEK5(D) to activate ERK5, mERK5a(-tail) was able to phosphorylate MBP in vitrosimilar to mERK5a (Fig. 7 A,upper panel). These results suggest that the kinase activity of mERK5a(-tail) is comparable to mERK5a. Another indication of kinase activity is autophosphorylation. The anti-Xpress antibody recognized both the full-length mERK5A and the truncated mERK5a(-tail) in cell lysates from transfected CHO-K1 cells, suggesting that mERK5a(-tail) protein was stably expressed (Fig.7 A, lower panel). Upon activation by coexpression of MEK5(D), mERK5a(-tail) exhibited an electrophoretically shifted band similar to the full-length mERK5a (Fig. 7 A, lower panel), suggesting that mERK5a(-tail) was phosphorylated by MEK5. The shifted band of the full-length ERK5 is consistent with the phosphorylation of ERK5 and is general"

This third phase of activity, the first known Notch-independent activation function for Su(H) in development, depends on a cell type-specific autoregulatory enhancer that is active throughout adult life and is required for proper mechanoreception.

In particular, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), osteotropic growth factors, significantly induce OPG expression both at the mRNA and the protein level in human fetal osteoblast cells (20Hofbauer L.C.

BMPs induce de novo bone formation in postfetal life through the process of intramembranous and endochondrial ossification. BMP-2, BMP-4, and BMP-7 are the most potent growth factors that promote new cartilage and bone formation (22Schmitt J.M. Hwang K. Shelley R.W. Jeffery O.H. J. Orthop.

The BMPs initiate the cascades of transcription program for mesenchymal stem cell differentiation into osteoblasts and chondrocytes. Studies of the mechanisms of BMP-induced OPG gene transcription should provide us with a better understanding of the roles of BMPs and OPG in skeletal formation and bone remodeling. BMPs form the largest group in the TGF-β superfamily. The TGF-β signal transduction pathway has been elucidated in recent years (26Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar,27Wrana J.F. Cell. 2000; 100: 189-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Like other members of the superfamily, BMPs bind to two types of transmembrane receptors, known as type I and type II, with serine/threonine kinase activity (28Kawabata M. Inoue H. Hanyu A. Imamura T. Miyazono K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4056-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Upon binding to BMP ligands, type I receptors phosphorylate a family of conserved downstream Smad proteins. Smad1 is the downstream effector of BMP signaling (29Hoodless P.A. Haerry T. Abdollah S.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated Smad1 interacts with Smad4, which then translocates into the nucleus and regulates gene transcription by associating with a nuclear transcription factor (31Verschueren K. Remacle J.E. Collart C. Kraft H. Baker B.S. Tylzanowski P. Nelles L. Wuytens G. Su M.T. Bodmer R. Smith J.C. Huylebroeck D. J. Biol.

Nature. 1997; 388: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that Smad1 interacts with Hoxc-8, a homeodomain transcription factor, and dislodges Hoxc-8 from its DNA binding element, resulting in the induction of gene expression (33Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The interaction domains of Smad1 with Hoxc-8 have been characterized. Overexpression of these domains in osteoblast precursors stimulated osteoblast differentiation-related gene expression and led to mineralized bone matrix formation (34Yang X. Ji X. Shi X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Hox binding elements widely exist in promoters of osteoblast differentiation marker genes, especially those that rapidly respond to BMP stimulation, such as OPG (20Hofbauer L.C. Dunstan C.R. Spelsberg T.C. Riggs B.L. Khosla S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), BMP-4 (35Feng J. Chen D. Cooney A.J. Tsai M. Harris M.A. Tsai S.Y.

Martin T.J. Ng K.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It appears that the interaction between Smad1 and Hox transcription factors may represent the major initiation mechanism of osteoblast differentiation in the BMP signaling pathway. In the present study, we reported that constitutively active BMP type IA receptor ALK3 (Q233) stimulates OPG promoter activity. By characterization of the OPG promoter, we found that the two Hox binding sites are essential for OPG transcription activation induced by BMP. Most importantly, overexpression of the Smad1 linker region, which interacts with Hoxc-8, induced both OPG promoter activity and endogenous OPG protein expression in 2T3 osteoblastic cells. Finally, the medium from the cells transfected with the Smad1 linker region expression plasmids effectively inhibited OPGL-induced osteoclastogenesis. The OPG promoter from −1104 to +59 relative to the transcription start site was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from human genomic DNA and cloned into MluI and BglII sites of the pGL3-basic vector (Promega) to generate a luciferase reporter construct (OPG-1). A deletion series (OPG-2, −999 to +59; OPG-3, −937 to +59; OPG-4, −700 to +59; OPG-5, −564 to +59) was also cloned into MluI and BglII sites of the pGL3-basic vector. OPG-SV40 (−1104 to −624) reporter bearing the two Hoxc-8 binding sites was constructed using the same strategy but was put into the pGL3-control vector (Promega). The mutants, mOPG-SV40, m1OPG-SV40, and m2OPG-SV40, were generated by replacing both, the first, or the second Hox recognition core sequences TAAT with TCCT (mutated nucleotides are in boldface type), respectively, in the OPG promoter region (−1104 to −624) using polymerase chain reaction. A Smad1C mutant construct (m-Smad1C) was generated by deletion of the Hoxc-8 interaction domain (amino acids 148–191) of Smad1C (amino acids 148–278). C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal cells (5 × 104 cells/12-well plate) were transiently transfected using Tfx-50 reagent (33Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) with a total of 0.3 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid (OPG1, OPG-SV40, mOPG-SV40, m1OPG-SV40, or m2OPG-SV40) and different expression plasmids as indicated. Total DNA was kept constant by the addition of PCDNA3 plasmid. Luciferase activities were assayed 42 h post-transfection using the Dual Luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's directions. Luciferase values shown in the figures are representative of transfection experiments performed in triplicate in at least three independent experiments. A GST fusion construct of GST-Hoxc-8 was generated as described in our previous study (33Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The expression and purification of the fusion proteins were performed as described elsewhere (37Sterner J.M. Murata Y. Kim H.G. Kennett S.B. Templeton D.J. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9281-9288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For EMSA, various amounts of recombinant proteins were incubated with 5 × 104 cpm 32P-labeled probes for 15 min at room temperature in a binding buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)). The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5% TBE. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes used in the EMSA are as follows: OPG-2Hox (OPG promoter region, −1104 to −907; two consensus Hox binding sites are in boldface type), 5′-CTGGAGACATATAACTTGAACACTTGGCCCTGATGGGGAAGCAGCTCTGCAGGGACTTTTTCAGCCATCTGTAAACAATTTCAGTGGCAACCCGCGAACTGTAATCCATGAATGGGACCACACTTTACAAGTCATCAAGTCTAACTTCTAGACCAGGGAATTAATGGGGGAGACAGCGAACCCTAGAGCAAAGTGCCA-3′; OPG-Hox1 (OPG promoter region, −1013 to −994; the consensus Hox binding site is in boldface type), 5′-CCGCGAACTGTAATCCATGA-3′; OPG-mHox1 (OPG promoter region, 1103 to −994; the mutated Hox binding site is in boldface type), 5′-CCGCGAACTGTCCTCCATGA-3′; OPG-Hox2 (OPG promoter region, −956 to −932; the consensus Hox binding site is in boldface type), 5′-TAGACCAGGGAATTAATGGGGGAG-3′; fragment 5 (OPG promoter region, −956 to −932; the mutated Hox binding site is in boldface type), 5′-TAGACCAGGGAATTCCTGGGGGAGA-3′. These oligonucleotides were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase. 2T3 cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of Smad 1C-NLS, the linker region of full-length Smad1, which is identified as the Hoxc-8 interaction domain (34Yang X. Ji X. Shi X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cell lysate was collected at different times (0, 24, 33, 40, and 48 h), fractionated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were blocked at room temperature for 1 h in 3% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and then incubated for >1 h at room temperature with 1:100 anti-OPG polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). After washing, the blots were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated 1:1000 anti-goat antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The blots were washed five times and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to x-ray film. The specificity of the blot was examined by incubating 1 μg/ml excess OPG blocking peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with primary antibody. Mouse bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) were isolated from 8-week mice (C57/B1) (38Bizzarri C. Shioi A. Teitelbaum S.L. Ohara J. Harwalker V.A. Erdmann J.M. Lacey D.L. Civitelli R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13817-13824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To generate osteoclasts, BMMs were cultured in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in 24-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well) in the presence of murine recombinant M-CSF (10 ng/ml) from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and GST-OPGL (50 ng/ml) (39McHugh K.P. Hodivala-Dilke K. Zheng M.H. Namba N. Lam J. Novock D. Feng X. Ross F.P. Hynes R.O. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Culturing medium was changed every 3 days, and M-CSF and GST-OPGL were freshly added to the culture after the medium change. Osteoclasts started to form at day 4, and the cultures were stained for tartrate-resistant phosphatase (TRAP) activity using a commercial kit from Sigma at day 5. In selected wells, 25% of the culturing medium was the conditioned medium from 2T3 cells transfected with plasmid Smad1C or empty vector (PCDNA3). BMPs induce OPG gene expression (20Hofbauer L.C. Dunstan C.R. Spelsberg T.C. Riggs B.L. Khosla S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanisms of the BMP-activated OPG gene transcription, we have cloned an approximately 1-kilobase pair DNA fragment of the OPG promoter (−1104/+59). The OPG promoter was ligated into a luciferase reporter expression vector to examine its responsiveness to BMP stimulation. Transient transfection of this construct in C3H10T1/2 cells with Smad1 and a constitutively active type IA BMP receptor (ALK3) expression plasmid resulted in a significant increase in luciferase activity. We then attempted to localize the BMP response elements by promoter deletion analysis. As shown in Fig.1, a series of OPG 5′-flanking region deletion constructs were generated. These constructs were transfected in C3H10T1/2 cells and challenged with BMP stimulation. Deletion of the DNA fragment from −1104 to −938 abrogated BMP-induced transcription activity (Fig. 1). Further deletion did not significantly change luciferase activity. Analysis of the DNA sequence of this promoter fragment (−1104 to −938) revealed two putative Hox binding sites, located at −1003 to −1000 or −943 to −940, respectively. We have shown previously that Smad1 interaction with Hoxc-8 dislodges Hoxc-8 from its DNA binding element to activate osteopontin gene expression (33Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the interaction between Hoxc-8 and Smad1 is also the transcription mechanism in response to BMP stimulation. Hoxc-8 was cotransfected with Smad1 and ALK3 in C3H10T1/2 cells. As expected, Hoxc-8 significantly inhibited BMP-induced OPG transcription (Fig. 1), suggesting that Hoxc-8 mediates BMP stimulation. This result indicates that the promoter fragment bearing two Hox binding sites may be responsible for the BMP-induced transcription. To verify that the promoter region with two Hox sites function as BMP response elements, we cloned the fragment (−1104/−624) containing the two Hox binding sites into the pGL3-control luciferase reporter vector under the control of the SV40 promoter (OPG-SV40) (Fig.2 A). When this construct was cotransfected in C3H10T1/2 cells with full-length Smad1 and ALK3 (Q233D), the transcription activity was significantly stimulated (Fig.2 B). Furthermore, the core nucleotides TAAT of these two Hox binding sites were mutated to TCCT, designated as mOPG-SV40. As expected, transfection of the mutant construct completely abolished the Smad1- and ALK3-induced reporter activity and eliminated Hoxc-8 inhibition in C3H10T1/2 cells. Effects of Hoxc-8 alone on both wild type and mutant promoter constructs were also examined. Hoxc-8 significantly inhibited basal activity in the wild type promoter (Fig.2 B). Two Hox sites were also mutated individually to assess the relative contribution to the BMP stimulation (Fig. 2 A). Transfection analysis of these two Hox mutant constructs suggests that mutation of either of the Hox sites abolish Hoxc-8-mediated inhibition (Fig. 2 C). However, the OPG-Hox1 (−1003/−1000) appears to contribute more in response to BMP stimulation. These results indicate that the two Hox binding sites are essential to BMP-induced OPG promoter transcription. To examine whether Hoxc-8 binds to the two consensus Hox binding sites, we performed EMSA. Isotope 32P-labeled DNA fragments, containing either one or both of the Hox binding sites, were used in incubation with purified GST-Hoxc-8 (Fig. 3 A). When a longer fragment comprising both Hox binding sites was used, Hoxc-8 protein formed a retarded band (Fig. 3 B). Thus, Hoxc-8 protein binds to the DNA fragment. Then, two shorter fragments (−1013/−994 and −956/−932), each containing a Hox binding site, were used, respectively. As seen in Fig. 3 C, Hoxc-8 binds efficiently to both of the individual Hox binding sites (Fig.3 C, lanes 3 and 8). We have previously shown that Smad1 inhibits Hoxc-8 binding in activating gene transcription (33Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 34Yang X. Ji X. Shi X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The binding specificity of Hoxc-8 to these two Hox sites was examined by both DNA competition studies and Hox site mutation experiments. Each 50-fold unlabeled Hox site displaced the binding of Hoxc-8 to its corresponding Hox site, respectively (Fig.3 C, lanes 4 and 9). As expected, Hoxc-8 binding was abolished when mutated Hox sites were used as probes (Fig. 3 C, lanes 5 and10), in which the core sequence TAAT was mutated into TCCT for both Hox sites. Thus, these results confirm that Hoxc-8 binds to two Hox binding sites of OPG promoter specifically. We have previously established the BMP-induced gene transcription model (27Wrana J.F. Cell. 2000; 100: 189-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 40Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which Smad1 removes Hoxc-8 binding via direct interaction between these two proteins (33Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We also mapped the interaction domains for both proteins. The Smad1 linker region is one of the domains (Smad1C, Fig.4 A) that interacts with Hoxc-8 and blocks Hoxc-8 binding to its DNA element (34Yang X. Ji X. Shi X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The binding of Hoxc-8 to OPG promoter predicts that overexpression of the Smad1 linker region activates OPG promoter transcription activity. To determine whether such was the case, we cotransfected Smad1C expression plasmids in C3H10T1/2 cells with the OPG promoter construct (OPG1) or the SV40 promoter linked to the two OPG Hox sites (OPG-SV40). Smad1C dramatically stimulates transcription activity for both constructs, and Hoxc-8 inhibits Smad1C-induced transcription activity. Notably, Smad1C with deletion of Smad1 interactin domain did not have such an effect (Fig. 4 B). The construct with both mutated Hox sites (mOPG-SV40) or a single Hox site mutation (m1OPG-SV40 and m2OPG-SV40) was transfected in C3H10T1/2 cells. Fig. 4 C shows that mutation of one or both Hox sites significantly decreased Smad1C-induced OPG promoter transcription. These results establish that the interaction between Smad1 and Hoxc-8 mediates BMP signals and support our proposed model for BMP-induced gene transcription. Having characterized the BMP-induced transcription mechanism for the OPG promoter, we then examined if the OPG promoter analysis-derived transcription mechanism reflects Smad1-mediated endogenous OPG gene expression. C3H10T1/2 cells were transfected with Smad1C expression plasmids. The OPG protein expression levels were measured by Western blot from the Smad1C-transfected 2T3 cells. As seen in Fig. 5 A, a 55-kDa band was significantly induced. Another band above 79 kDa appeared later at 32 h after Smad1C transfection, indicating that a large amount of monomer and a small amount of dimer exist in cells. Simonet et al. (7Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Kelley M. Chang M.S. Luthy R. Nguyen H.Q. Wooden S. Bennett L. Boone T. Shimamoto G. DeRose M. Elliott R. Colombero A. Tan H.L. Trail G. Sullivan J. Davy E. Bucay N. Renshaw-Gegg L. Hughes T.M. Hill D. Pattison W. Campbell P. Sander S. Van G. Tarpley J. Derby P. Lee R. Boyle W.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 309-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4374) Google Scholar) demonstrated that OPG is synthesized as an ∼55-kDa monomer within the cell, and the monomers are then converted to disulfide-linked dimers of ∼110 kDa. The dimers are then secreted into the medium. The specificity of the OPG band recognized in Western blot is confirmed by completely blocking the band with excess of OPG antigen (Fig. 5 B). Finally, we examined the biological activity of secreted OPG in the medium from Smad1C-transfected cells. Osteoclasts normally differentiate from members of the monocyte-macrophage lineage when exposed to OPGL and M-CSF, but OPG inhibits osteoclast differentiation. Primary mouse BMMs were cultured (38Bizzarri C. Shioi A. Teitelbaum S.L. Ohara J. Harwalker V.A. Erdmann J.M. Lacey D.L. Civitelli R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13817-13824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of M-CSF and OPGL in combination with one-fourth of the medium from Smad1C- or vector-transfected 2T3 cells. A significant quantity of TRAP+ multinucleated osteoclasts was formed in cells treated with M-CSF and OPGL (Fig.6 A), and the addition of medium from cells transfected with the empty vector did not change TRAP+ multinucleated osteoclast formation (Fig.6 C). The addition of Smad1C-transfected medium significantly blocked TRAP+ multinucleated osteoclast differentiation (Fig. 6 D), similar to macrophages cultured without M-CSF and OPGL (Fig. 6 B). These results demonstrate that Smad1C induces secretion of functional OPG protein, which inhibits osteoclastogenesis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the transcription mechanism of BMP-induced OPG gene expression and further explore the interaction between Smad1 and Hoxc-8 as an initial cascade in BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation. We characterized BMP response elements in the OPG promoter. Promoter deletion analysis demonstrates that the OPG promoter fragment bearing two Hox binding sites responds to BMP stimulation. Deletion of the two Hox binding sites abolished BMP-induced OPG promoter activity, and further deletion of other putative Hox binding sites did not change the luciferase activity in response to BMP stimulation. This observation was validated by transfection studies with the construct containing mutations of the two Hox binding sites (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, gel shift assays demonstrate that Hoxc-8 binds to the two Hox sites specifically. There are other putative Hox binding sites identified by the core sequence TAAT in the OPG promoter. However, these Hox sites did not appear to mediate BMP signals in the osteogenic cells. The flanking regions of the “coreȁ are important in determining the specificity of Hox binding, since there are 39 members in the Hox family. It is possible that these Hox binding sites play an essential role in regulating OPG gene expression in different tissues during development. We then examined whether Smad1 interaction with Hoxc-8 mediates the BMP signals via the two Hox binding sites. We previously showed that the Smad1 linker region interacts with Hoxc-8 to induce osteopontin gene transcription. Overexpression of this interaction domain is sufficient to induce osteoblast differentiation and bone cell formation (34Yang X. Ji X. Shi X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Similar to osteopontin promoter, transfection of the Smad1 linker region significantly activated OPG promoter transcription in C3H10T1/2 cells, and the induced promoter activity is inhibited by Hoxc-8. Thus, these data suggest the interaction between Smad1 and Hoxc-8 is a general transcription mechanism in the BMP signaling pathway. The most important functional finding is that the overexpression of Smad1 linker region stimulated endogenous OPG protein expression in C3H10T1/2 cells. The induced OPG protein was secreted into medium, which effectively inhibited osteoclastogenesis. It is known that BMPs play a critical role in bone remodeling and in maintaining the structural integrity of the skeletal system, due to their ability to induce osteoblast differentiation (22Schmitt J.M.

The BMP-induced OPG transcription mechanism revealed in the current study involves Smad1 interaction with Hoxc-8, which is a quick response to BMP stimulation, since it only requires Smad1 phosphorylation. This logically explains the importance of the balance between osteoblast activity and osteoclast activity. The regulation of bone cell differentiation is a very complicated process. OPG is a potent inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption produced by osteoblast. It was recently shown that OPG mRNA expression is stimulated by many bone metabolic growth factors, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (20Hofbauer L.C. Dunstan C.R. Spelsberg T.C. Riggs B.L. Khosla S.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize the OPG transcription mechanism in osteoblastic cells, which may provide a potential anti-resorption therapeutic opportunity. BMPs initiate the entire transcription program in osteoblast differentiation. Their signals are mediated by phosphorylation of BMP receptor-regulated Smads, including Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8. Hoxc-8 has been characterized as the downstream transcription factor of Smad1 in BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation (33Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and our data also indicate that Hoxc-8 is specific for the BMP signaling pathway. Data presented in this paper provide additional evidence supporting the hypothesis that the interaction of Smad1 with Hoxc-8 represents the initiation mechanism for BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation. Smad1-Hoxc-8 interaction is the mechanism in activating OPG gene expression, another early marker gene, in response to BMP stimulation. A wide existence of putative Hox binding sites in many other early BMP-responsive genes (35Feng J. Chen D. Cooney A.J. Tsai M. Harris M.A. Tsai S.Y. Feng M. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. J. Biol.

However, since Smad1 itself is a sequence-specific transcription factor and there are other BMP-regulated Smads, such as Smad5 and Smad8, an intricate BMP-induced transcription network is anticipated. The BMP-induced transcription cascades will become clear when more BMP downstream transcription factors are identified and more transcription mechanisms are characterized from BMP-regulated genes. We are grateful to J. Wrana for kindly providing the constitutively active BMP type IA (ALK3) receptor expression vector, R. Derynck for human Smad1 cDNA clones, and H.

In rice allergy, proteins with molecular masses of 14–16, 26, 33, and 56 kDa have been demonstrated to be potentially allergenic. In this study, to identify and characterize the 33-kDa allergen, designated Glb33, this protein was first purified to homogeneity, and its cDNA clone was isolated. When expressed inEscherichia coli, the recombinant Glb33 was shown to be as reactive as the native Glb33 with mouse IgG and patients' IgE antibodies to Glb33. The Glb33 cDNA coded for a protein of 291 amino acids with two 120-amino acid residue repeats, and the amino acid sequence showed similarity to glyoxalase I from various organisms, including human, plant, yeast, and bacterium. As expected, both native Glb33 purified from rice seeds and the recombinant protein had glyoxalase I activity that catalyzes condensation of methylglyoxal and glutathione into S-lactoylglutathione. However, Glb33 had a higher sequence identity to the bacterial glyoxalase I rather than to known plant and yeast enzymes. Both the Glb33 transcript and the protein were detected not only in maturing seeds of rice but also in its stem and leaf. Taken all together, the rice allergen, Glb33, was identified to be a novel type of plant glyoxalase I that is expressed in various plant tissues, including maturing seeds.AB017042 Cereal proteins are known to cause allergic reactions such as Baker's asthma and severe atopic dermatitis to certain populations.

Adv. Cereal Sci. Technol. 1984; 6: 289-356Google Scholar). Among these cereal allergies, asthma, eczema, and dermatitis are thought to be caused mainly, or in part, by the IgE1-mediated type I allergic reaction against certain cereal proteins (1Baldo B.A. Wrigley C.W.

Asthma caused by cereal is frequently found in workers handling cereal flours in European countries and considered to be an occupational disease known as “Baker's asthma.” Using the reactivity to IgE from the asthmatic and other cereal-sensitive patients as a gauge, the potent allergenic components in cereals was identified as the 15–20-kDa proteins of the plant α-amylase/trypsin inhibitor family (3Breiteneder H.

Some other wheat proteins, glutenin and gliadin, have also been identified as IgE-reactive proteins (5Maruyama N. Ichise K. Katsube T. Kishimoto T. Kawase S. Matsumura Y. Takeuchi Y. Sawada T. Utsumi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Rice is a cereal produced and consumed in large quantity in South and East Asian countries. The association of rice seed proteins with allergic reaction was first reported in Japan for patients with histories of asthma induced by rice flour exposure and eczema exacerbated by rice ingestion (6Shibasaki M. Suzuki S. Nemoto H. Kuroume T. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1979; 64: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Several clinical studies on rice-induced allergy have been reported for asthma (7Arai T. Takaya T. Ito Y. Hayakawa K. Toshima S. Shibuya C. Nomura M. Yoshimi N. Shibayama M. Yasuda Y. Intern. Med. 1998; 37: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and severe atopic dermatitis (8Ikezawa Z. Miyakawa K. Komatsu H. Suga C. Miyakawa J. Sugiyama A. Sasaki T. Nakajima H. Hirai Y. Suzuki Y. Acta Dermato.-Venereol. Suppl. ( Stockh. ). 1992; 176: 103-107PubMed Google Scholar) in Japan. Rice seed proteins with molecular masses of about 14–16, 26, 33, and 56 kDa were shown to be reactive with IgE antibodies from patients with a suspected rice allergy (9Urisu A. Yamada K. Masuda S. Komada H. Wada E. Kondo Y. Horiba F. Tsuruta M. Yasaki T. Yamada M. Torii S. Nakamura R. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1991; 96: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A group of homologous proteins of about 14–16 kDa recognized by IgE from the majority (90–95%) of the patients in rice seeds was isolated and characterized to be α-amylase inhibitors, which were immunologically cross-reactive proteins constituting a multigene family (10Izumi H.

Matsuda T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Another allergen with a size of 26 kDa, recognized by patients' IgE less frequently, was identified as the major seed storage protein, α-globulin (13Limas G.G. Salinas M. Moneo I. Fischer S. Wittmann-Liebold B. Mendez E. Planta. 1990; 181: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the other two proteins of about 33 and 56 kDa that exhibit IgE-reactivity have not yet been identified, though these proteins showed IgE reactivity stronger than the 14–16-kDa allergens with only part of the patients allergic to cereals (9Urisu A. Yamada K. Masuda S. Komada H. Wada E. Kondo Y. Horiba F. Tsuruta M. Yasaki T. Yamada M. Torii S. Nakamura R. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1991; 96: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A trial to produce hypoallergenic rice was done by suppressing the allergenic genes in transgenic rice plants (14Tada Y. Nakase M. Adachi T. Nakamura R. Shimada H. Takahashi M. Fujimura T. Matsuda T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The expression of 14–16-kDa allergens in maturing seeds was demonstrated to be markedly reduced, without any biological side effect on the rice plants, to 10–20% of that of wild type by the introduction of specific antisense genes into rice plants. However, to develop hypoallergenic rice for therapeutic use, some other potent allergens should be decreased or eliminated by conventional breeding and/or genetic engineering. Toward the hypoallergenic rice production and for a better understanding of IgE reactivity of rice seed proteins, it would be of interest and importance to know the structure of the major allergenic proteins and their expression as well as the real function of these proteins in rice plants. The aim of the present study is isolation of the protein and cDNA for the rice 33-kDa allergen and characterization of its expression and function, to decipher any biological roles of the rice 33-kDa allergen in rice plants. The cDNA and the deduced amino acid sequences indicated that the rice 33-kDa allergen consisted of two repeated sequences, each of which showed sequence similarity to bacterial glyoxalase I enzymes and to plant enzymes, albeit with lower identity. In fact, the purified and recombinant 33-kDa proteins revealed not only reactivity with patients' IgE but also catalytic activity characteristic of glyoxalase I. This is the first report on a novel type of a plant allergen possessing glyoxalase I activity. Rice seed proteins were extracted from dehulled grains of rice (Oryza sativa L. Japonica cv. Nipponbare) and concentrated as described previously (11Nakase M. Adachi T. Urisu A. Miyashita T. Alvarez A.M. Nagasaka S. Aoki N. Nakamura R. Matsuda T. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1996; 44: 2624-2628Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were extracted with 1 m NaCl by sonication and precipitated with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation). A part of the protein precipitated with ammonium sulfate was dialyzed against buffer A, (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6) and subjected to DEAE ion-exchange chromatography (DE52, Whatman International Ltd., Maidstone, United Kingdom). After being washed with buffer A, the column was subjected to a linear gradient of NaCl, from 0 to 0.5 m in buffer A. Protein peak fractions with UV absorbance at 280 nm were individually collected, and the reactivity to patients' IgE antibodies was determined for each fraction as described below. The fractions with reactivity to the IgE antibodies were dialyzed against buffer A and subjected to HPLC (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an ion-exchange column of DEAE-5PW (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan), which had been equilibrated with buffer A. Proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 0.25 m in buffer A. To obtain amino acid sequences for Glb33, its tryptic peptides were prepared as follows. The HPLC-purified Glb33 was digested withN-α-tosyl-l-phenylalanylchloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin at the enzyme/protein ratio (w/w) of 1/100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm CaCl2 for 6 h, and the tryptic peptides were applied to a reverse phase HPLC equipped with an ODS column (Biofine PO, Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). The peptides were separated by eluting with a linear gradient of acetonitrile from 0 to 50% in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The isolated peptides were adsorbed on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and subjected to a peptide sequencer (Applied Biosystems, model 476A, Foster City, CA). For the cDNA cloning of Glb33 gene, degenerate sense oligonucleotide mixtures, 5′-AT(A/T/C)GG(G/A/T/C)AC(G/A/T/C)GA(A/G)GA(C/T)GT(G/A/T/C)TA(C/T)AT-3′, synthesized according to the determined amino acid sequences for Glb33 were end-labeled with 32P and used for the screening of a random-primed cDNA library of λgt11 (10Izumi H.

Nakamura R. Matsuda T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) derived from maturing rice seeds (O. sativa L. Japonica cv. Nipponbare). The cDNA inserts of positive phage clones were amplified by PCR and subcloned into a plasmid vector pUC118. For the extension of the 3′-end using the 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique, the first strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II, Life Technologies, Inc.) with an adopter-combined oligo(dT) primer, 5′-CAGAATTCAGCTGCAGGATCC(T)12–3′, and poly(A)+RNA, which had been purified from maturing rice seeds with Oligotex dT-30 (TaKaRa, Osaka, Japan), as the template. The DNA was then amplified by PCR using a sense primer, 5′-GCCATGTTGGGCTATGCTGA-3′ (nucleotide positions 616–635 of the sequence, GenBankTM accession number AB107042, registered in the data base), and an adapter primer as an antisense primer, 5′-CAGAATTCAGCTGCAGGATCC-3′. By using the PCR product as a template, a nested PCR was done with a sense primer, 5′-GGTGTCACAGAATATACCAAGGG-3′ (nucleotide positions 676–698), and the antisense adapter primer as above, and the PCR product was cloned into pUC118. Finally, to obtain a full-length cDNA for Glb33, PCR was done by using a sense primer, 5′-ATCCTCCCACCTCGGCTCGA-3′ (nucleotide positions 9–28), an antisense primer, 5′-CCTAGCACAGAACTTGGGCC-3′ (nucleotide positions 921–940), and the first strand cDNA as a template as described above. Nucleotide sequence was determined by a DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, model 373) with the dye terminator cycle sequencing FS Ready reaction. Plasmid DNAs from at least four independent Escherichia coli clones were sequenced. Homologous sequences were identified by searching through the BLAST program of the National Center for Biotechnology Information; the obtained sequences were compared one to another by the computer-assisted method of Higgins and Sharp (15Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 73: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (2871) Google Scholar). The Glb33 cDNA inserted in pUC118 was amplified by PCR using a sense primer, 5′-GCTCGAAGCCATGGCAAGCGGT-3′ (nucleotide positions 23–45), and an antisense primer, 5′-GAACTTGGGATATCTCTCATCT-3′ (nucleotide positions 910–931), in which NcoI and EcoRV sites were incorporated, respectively. The PCR product was first cloned into pBluescriptKS(+), amplified, and then cloned again into pET-32a(+) (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) to construct a plasmid designated as pET-33k, for Glb33 expression. The Glb33/thioredoxin fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and purified by a stepwise elution with varied imidazole concentrations in accordance with manufacturer's instruction (Novagen). The purified protein was dialyzed against the cleavage buffer, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mmNaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and digested with enterokinase (Novagen), 2 units for 50 μg of protein in 2 ml of the buffer. After analysis by SDS-PAGE, the enterokinase digest was subjected again to the column of His-bind resin to remove released thioredoxin as well as undigested fusion protein. The flow-through fraction containing recombinant Glb33 (rGlb33) was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stored at −20 °C until further use. Reactivity of rGlb33 to mouse anti-Glb33 antibodies and human IgE antibodies was also measured by ELISA (16Engvall E. Perlmann P. J. Immunol. 1972; 109: 29-35Google Scholar). ELISA plates (Nunc-ImmunoTM plate, Nalgen Nunc International, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 50 μl of purified Glb33 and rGlb33 at varied concentrations between 0.3 and 20 μg/ml in PBS at 4 °C for 16 h and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS at 37 °C for 30 min. After being washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), the plates were incubated with 50 μl of patient's serum 20 times diluted or 100 μl of mouse antiserum 5,000 times diluted, with 1% BSA in PBST at 4 °C for 16 h. The plates were finally incubated with peroxidase-labeled anti-human IgE (BIOSOURCE International, Inc., Camarillo, CA), or peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (E. Y. Laboratories Inc., San Mateo, CA) diluted appropriately with 1% BSA in PBST. The peroxidase activity was determined with o-phenylenediamine as a substrate as described previously (11Nakase M. Adachi T. Urisu A. Miyashita T. Alvarez A.M. Nagasaka S. Aoki N. Nakamura R. Matsuda T. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1996; 44: 2624-2628Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Mouse antiserum was prepared by three-time intraperitoneal injections of the purified Glb33 (50 μg of protein per mouse in 100 μl of emulsion with Freund's complete or incomplete adjuvant) to female ddY mice (Japan SLC, Inc., Hamamatsu, Japan). The human sera were collected from patients whose consents were obtained. From among patients under medical treatment for atopic dermatitis and/or bronchial asthma at the University Hospital, 36 sera with positive RAST values for rice seed proteins, and 12 sera with negative RAST values for the rice proteins were selected and used for the following experiments. Proteins were extracted from each tissue of rice plants according to the methods of Rensinket al. (17Rensink W.A. Pilon M. Weisbeek P. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and De Rocher et al. (18De Rocher E.J. Vargo-Gogola T.C. Diehn S.H. Green P.J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1445-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, each tissue sample was ground to fine pieces in a blender and suspended in 10 ml/g PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After being kept at 4 °C with gentle shaking for 14 h and treated with ultrasonication for 1 min on ice, the tissue sample was passed through a piece of gauze and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was dialyzed against distilled water and then freeze-dried. The crude extracts of each tissue of rice plant and purified Glb33 proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) according to Laemmli's method (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar); proteins in the gel were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were electrophoretically blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (20Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44843) Google Scholar). After being blocked with 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone (Mr 40,000) in PBS or 3% BSA in PBS, the membrane was incubated with the mouse anti-Glb33 antiserum 500–1,000 times diluted with 1% BSA in PBS or with the patient' serum 8 times diluted with 1% BSA in PBS, at 20 °C for 3 h. The membrane was washed with PBST and incubated with peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (E. Y. laboratories Inc.) or peroxidase-labeled anti-human IgE (BIOSOURCE International, Inc.) diluted appropriately with 1% BSA in PBS. Activity staining for peroxidase was done with either an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) or 4-chloro-1-naphthol. Total RNA was isolated from seed, stem, leaf, and seedling tissues of rice by a phenol-SDS extraction method (12Adachi T. Izumi H. Yamada T. Tanaka K. Takeuchi S. Nakamura R. Matsuda T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed using SuperScript one-step RT-PCR system (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (1 μg each) with specific primers for the full-length cDNA described above were used for RT-PCR reaction at 25 cycles. Aliquots of PCR product were separated on a 1.0% agarose gel, blotted to Hybond-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); hybridization and detection with the digoxigenin-labeled Glb33 cDNA were performed using DIG DNA labeling and detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions. Glyoxalase I was measured following a previously described method (21Inoue Y. Rhee H. Watanabe K. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1987; 102: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Briefly, the substrate solution (100 μl) containing 0–20 mm methylglyoxal and 5 mm glutathione in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, was put in both sample and reference cuvettes set at a double-beamed spectrophotometer (Hitachi, model U2001, Tokyo, Japan) and held at 25 °C. To the sample cuvette was added 10 μl of the enzyme solution containing 4 μg of protein and incubated at 25 °C for 1 min. Initial velocity of the reaction was determined by monitoring changes of absorbance of the reaction mixture at 240 nm. The UV absorbance was converted to mole quantity by using the molecular coefficient of 3,370 forS-lactoylglutathione (22Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 190: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast glyoxalase I used for comparison was from Sigma. Salt-soluble proteins extracted from rice were fractionated by an anion-exchange chromatography of DEAE-Sepharose, and fractions with a peak of UV absorbance were individually collected and subjected to SDS-PAGE and IgE binding assay. The fraction, which showed positive reaction to patients' IgE and contained the 33-kDa protein, was subjected to a further purification by HPLC. Purity of the preparation was assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining (see Fig.1 A). The purified 33-kDa protein, referred to as Glb33, was dialyzed against PBS and kept at −20 °C until use. Because no N-terminal amino acid was recovered from the purified protein on the peptide sequence analysis, the Glb33 preparation was digested with trypsin to generate internal peptides. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of two peptides isolated from the tryptic digest of Glb33 were determined to be GNAYAQVAIGTEDVY and IASFLDPDGWK, and consequently, a degenerate oligonucleotide mixture for the sequence underlined was synthesized. By screening of the rice cDNA library with the degenerate oligonucleotide probe, three positive clones were obtained, and their DNA sequences were determined. Since the chemically determined peptide sequence was present in the deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNAs, but neither stop codon nor polyadenylation signal sequence was found in the DNA sequences, the 3′-end of the cDNAs were extended by PCR using the gene-specific primer. About 500-base pair DNA fragments amplified by the PCR were cloned into plasmid and sequenced. Finally, RT-PCR was performed followed by DNA sequencing of four independent clones to obtain the precise sequence using a set of primers to amplify the open reading frame of the cDNA. The cDNA contained the 873 base pairs of open reading frame (excluding the stop codon), which encoded a 291-amino acid protein with a theoretical molecular mass of about 32.6 kDa and pI of 5.4. At 73 and 115 base pairs downstream from the stop codon (TGA) in the 3′-untranslated region, two polyadenylation signals were found. The sequences of the two tryptic peptides from purified Glb33 can be localized in the deduced amino acid sequence and start after a lysine residue, according to the tryptic proteolysis consensus site. From these sequence data and results of the expression experiments described below, this cDNA clone was concluded to encode Glb33. The deduced amino acid sequence of Glb33 revealed neither hydrophobic region, found in typical signal sequences, at the 5′-end of the coding region nor potential N-glycosylation site. Neither signal sequence nor other hydrophobic region throughout the sequence suggests that Glb33 is a cytoplasmic protein. The Glb33 was shown to have two repeat homologous sequences, each containing several conserved regions. By using the BLAST program, three hypothetical proteins (the GenBankTM accession numbers Z74962, Y10782, andZ97064 for Brassica oleracea (cabbage) (23Clugston S.L. Daub E. Honek J.F. J Mol. Evol. 1998; 47: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar),Sporobolus stapfianus (resurrection grass) (23Clugston S.L. Daub E. Honek J.F. J Mol.

Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 314Google Scholar), respectively) with unassigned function were found to be highly homologous (about 90% identity) to Glb33. Furthermore, more than 20 sequences of glyoxalase I enzymes from plants, mammals, yeast, and bacteria were also retrieved from the protein data bases, though the sequence identities were low (30–50% identity). A phylogenetic tree of these homologous sequences is shown in Fig. 2 A. Among these glyoxalase I enzymes, the overall structure, consisting of two repeat homologous sequences as was the case of Glb33, was found only in the yeast glyoxalase I sequence (25Inoue Y. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25958-25965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Such a repeat sequence was also found in the plant hypothetical proteins described above, although it is yet unknown whether or not these hypothetical proteins exhibit glyoxalase I activity. The N- and C-terminal halves, named N- and C-halves, respectively, of these proteins with the repeat sequence were individually compared with one another and to some other glyoxalase I enzymes. An alignment of these sequences, including tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) (26Espartero J. Sanchez-Aguayo I. Pardo J.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and E. coli (27Clugston S.L. Barnard J.F. Kinach R. Miedema D. Ruman R. Daub E. Honek J.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8754-8763Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) glyoxalase I enzymes, is shown in Fig. 2 B. The N- and C-halves of Glb33 highly resemble their corresponding regions in the resurrection grass (GenBankTM accession numberY10782) in which all putative binding sites for metals and glutathione were conserved. Both the N- and C-halves of Glb33 were similar to glyoxalase I of E. coli rather than that of tomato in terms of the position of sequence deletions or insertions as well as sequence identity.

Open table in a new tab The recombinant Glb33 (rGlb33) was first expressed as a fusion protein with thioredoxin and His-tag, enzymatically cut apart from thioredoxin and His-tag, and then purified by the Ni2+-affinity chromatography. The purified rGlb33 is shown to have a molecular mass of 33 kDa, which is identical to that of native Glb33 (nGlb33), by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1 A). Immunoblot analyses using the mouse anti-nGlb33 serum and pooled patients' sera revealed that rGlb33 reacted well with both the Glb33-specific mouse IgG and human IgE (Fig. 1, B andC). Immunological similarity of rGlb33 to the native one was further confirmed by ELISA using the mouse and human antibodies; the rGlb33 and the nGlb33 showed comparable reactivities (Fig.3, A and B). Because the sequence of Glb33 was homologous to several glyoxalase I enzymes even at several restricted regions, glyoxalase I activity was assayed for both nGlb33 and rGlb33 proteins. Both Glb33 proteins were found to catalyze the formation of S-lactoylglutathione from methylglyoxal and glutathione in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 A). However, the enzyme kinetics of Glb33 against methylglyoxal appeared to be different from that of yeast glyoxalase I analyzed for comparison (Fig.4 B). Based on the Hill's plot for these kinetic data, theKm values on native and recombinant Glb33 proteins were calculated to be 7.6 and 11 mm, respectively, which were four to five times higher than the value (2.0 mm) calculated for the yeast enzyme by the Lineweaver-Burk plot. TheVmax value for Glb33 per unit protein was estimated to be about one-sixth that of the yeast glyoxalase I. The catalytic ability (Vmax/Km) of Glb33 as glyoxalase I was calculated to be about 120 to 130 that of the yeast enzyme. Glb33 expression in some tissues of rice plants and in seeds at different stages of maturation was analyzed at mRNA and protein levels by RT-PCR/DNA blot and Western blot analyses, respectively (Fig.5). Total RNA and protein were prepared from rice seeds at different stages of maturation (5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, and 26 days after flowering (DAF)) and from other tissues. The RNA was used as a template for RT-PCR, and the protein was for SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis with the anti-Glb33 antibody. The Glb33 transcript was detected in seeds at all maturation stages tested and also in stem and leaf. At protein level, Glb33 was also detected in stem and leaf and in seeds harvested even at earlier stages of maturation (5–11 DAF). In the present study, both of the isolated and recombinant Glb33 proteins revealed IgE reactivity to several patients' sera as examined by Western blotting and ELISA (Figs. 1 and 3), indicating that Glb33 and its cDNA are indeed for the rice 33-kDa allergen. SomeN-linked carbohydrate chains containing xylose and fucose of plant and insect glycoproteins have been suggested to serve as an epitope recognized by a certain population of IgE antibodies from allergic patients, as well as IgG antibodies of rabbits immunized with a plant glycoprotein (28Garcia-Casado G. Sanchez-Monge R. Chrispeels M.J. Armentia A. Salcedo G. Gomez L. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that rice Glb33 has such carbohydrate epitopes of plant glycoproteins, because no potentialN-linked glycosylation site was found in the Glb33 amino acid sequence, and the molecular mass (33 kDa) of Glb33 estimated by SDS-PAGE agreed well with the size of Glb33 polypeptide (32.4 kDa) calculated from the amino acid sequence. Furthermore, rGlb33 expressed in E. coli showed molecular mass and immunological reactivity almost identical with those of nGlb33 (Figs. 1 and 3). These results also suggest that Glb33 has no antigenic N-linked sugar chain as epitope recognizable by the patients' IgE and mouse IgG. Glyoxalase I is a ubiquitous enzyme widely found in various organisms from mammals to bacterium. The enzymes of mammals, plants, and bacterial species have been reported to possess approximate molecular masses of 18–19 kDa, and only an exceptional one is that from yeast with a molecular mass of about 37 kDa (about twice as large as the others). The sequence of Glb33 was similar to that of yeast glyoxalase I in terms of the overall structural organization: two repeat homologous sequences. However, the sequence of each monomeric unit of Glb33 was similar to bacterial glyoxalase I rather than the yeast and known plant enzymes, such as Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) (29Veena Reddy V.S. Sopory S.K. Plant J. 1999; 17: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and tomato (L. esculentum) (26Espartero J. Sanchez-Aguayo I. Pardo J.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). These two plant glyoxalase I enzymes possess the same size of polypeptide (185 residues) and similar amino acid sequence (76% identity). In contrast, Glb33 is larger in size (291 residues) and shows lower similarities (30–35% identity). These structural properties suggested that Glb33 is not a rice homologue of the glyoxalase I enzymes isolated from Indian mustard and tomato. The saturation curves of Glb33 and yeast glyoxalase I for methylglyoxal suggest that the kinetic property of Glb33 is different from that of yeast glyoxalase I (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the anti-Glb33 antibody did not cross-react with yeast glyoxalase I. 2Y. Usui, and T. Matsuda, unpublished result. Therefore, Glb33 would not be a plant homologue of the yeast-type glyoxalase I either. As a consequence, we propose that Glb33 isolated from rice seeds could be a novel type of plant glyoxalase I. In conclusion, the 33-kDa protein in the salt-soluble fractions of rice seed proteins is one of the rice allergens and a novel type of plant glyoxalase I. The results presented here raise the possibility of eliminating or suppressing Glb33 by molecular genetic means (30Tavernarakis N. Wang S.L. Dorovkov M. Ryazanov A. Driscoll M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), unless the presence of this allergen is critically important in plant cells. We thank Professor R.

In the present study, the role of other fX derivatives in presenting rNAPc2 to fVIIa·TF is investigated. Catalytically active and active site blocked fXa, as well as a plasma-derived and an activation-resistant mutant of zymogen fX bound to rNAPc2 with comparable affinities (KD = 1–10 nm), and similarly supported the inhibition of fVIIa·TF (Ki* = ∼10 pm). The roles of phospholipid membrane composition in the inhibition of fVIIa·TF by rNAPc2 were investigated using TF that was either detergent-solubilized (TFS), or reconstituted into membranes, containing phosphatidylcholine (TFPC) or a mixture of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine (TFPCPS). In the absence of the fX derivative, inhibition of fVIIa·TF was similar for all three conditions (Ki∼1 μm), whereas the addition of the fX derivative increased the respective inhibition by 35-, 150-, or 100,000-fold for TFS, TFPC, and TFPCPS.

Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The serine protease factor VIIa (fVIIa)1 present in the blood specifically binds to tissue factor (TF), a transmembrane receptor glycoprotein bound to subendothelial structures or present on the surface of monocytic or other inflammatory cells, which accumulate at the site of injury (2Martin D.M.A. Wiiger T. Prydz H. Thromb. Res. 1998; 90: 1-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The exposure of TF to circulating blood is the triggering event that results in the formation of a catalytic complex (fVIIa·TF) that initiates the amplified cascade of proteolytic events leading to the formation of the serine protease thrombin (3Rapaport S.I. Rao V.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The action of thrombin coupled with the particular rheological environment found in diseased or damaged vascular beds, result in thrombi with compositions that vary from platelet-rich, a characteristic of the arterial vasculature, to fibrin-rich, platelet-poor clots, typical of the venous vasculature (4Hirsh J. Weitz J.I. Semin. Hematol. 1999; 36: 118-132PubMed Google Scholar). The pathway leading from the formation of the fVIIa·TF complex to thrombin proceeds through the serine protease factor Xa (fXa). Factor Xa is formed by the proteolytic activation of the zymogen factor X (fX) either by the fVIIa·TF complex or by the catalytic complex composed of the serine protease factor IXa and its nonenzymatic cofactor factor VIIIa assembled on an appropriate phospholipid surface (5Jenny N.S. Mann K.G. Thrombosis and Hemorrhage. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD1998: 3-27Google Scholar). Factor Xa catalyzes the formation of thrombin following assembly into a macromolecular catalytic complex (prothrombinase) with the nonenzymatic cofactor factor Va (fVa) that binds to a procoagulant phospholipid surface, such as activated platelets or inflammatory cells adhered to the site of vascular damage (6Mann K.G. Krishnaswamy S. Lawson J.H. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 213-226PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of the blood coagulation involves a variety of components, most of which act to down-regulate the proteolytic response initiated following vascular injury. The primary physiological inhibitor of the fVIIa·TF complex, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), mediates one of these crucial pathways (7Broze Jr., G.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1995; 46: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The efficient inhibition of fVIIa·TF by TFPI requires binding of the inhibitor to the active site of fXa via the second of its three Kunitz-like inhibitory domains followed by the formation of the final quaternary inhibitory complex with fVIIa·TF, in which the active site of fVIIa is occupied by the first Kunitz domain of the inhibitor (8Girard T.J. Warren L.A. Novotny W.F. Likert K.M. Brown S.G. Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. Nature. 1989; 338: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). A recent study suggested that the rate-limiting step governing the inhibition of fVIIa·TF by TFPI is the binding to fXa, which occurs while fXa is either bound to or remains in the near vicinity of the fVIIa·TF complex following zymogen cleavage of fX (9Baugh R.J. Broze Jr., G.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4378-4386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that the role of fXa in the inhibition of fVIIa·TF by TFPI is that of an “inhibitory scaffold,ȁ upon which is built the final inhibitory complex between the Kunitz-1 domain of TFPI and the active site of fVIIa. This proposed mechanism requires the ternary fVIIa·TF·fXa complex to display a limited half-life or stability. This originates, in part, from specific protein-protein interactions outside the catalytic center of fVIIa at exo-sites on fVIIa·TF, to which the substrate fX or product fXa binds (10Shobe J. Dickinson C.D. Edgington T.S. Ruf W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24171-24175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11Baugh R.J. Dickinson C.D. Ruf W. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28826-28833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Previously, we described a potent 84-amino acid, non-Kunitz-like inhibitor of the fVIIa·TF complex called nematode anticoagulant protein c2 (NAPc2) that was originally isolated from the hematophagous nematode hookworm Ancylostoma caninum (12Stanssens P. Bergum P.W. Gansemans Y. Jespers L. Laroche Y. Huang S. Maki S.L. Messens J. Lauwereys M. Cappello M. Hotez P.J. Lasters I. Vlasuk G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2149-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). An 85-amino acid recombinant form of NAPc2 (rNAPc2) was shown to significantly inhibit fVIIa·TF-mediated factor IX activation, but only in the presence of fXa, or fXa that had been irreversibly inhibited with the active-site inhibitor Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethylketone (EGR-fXa). The effectiveness of EGR-fXa as an inhibitory scaffold suggested that rNAPc2 bound to a region of fXa outside of the catalytic center. The utilization of such an exo-site by rNAPc2 distinguishes it from TFPI, which has been shown to require an unoccupied active site in fXa to allow the binding of the Kunitz 2 domain of the inhibitor (7Broze Jr., G.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1995; 46: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose that, although rNAPc2 is functionally similar to TFPI with respect to the requirement of an inhibitory scaffold to mediate its inhibition of fVIIa·TF, it is mechanistically distinct based on the specific binding interaction with fXa. In this report, we characterize the interaction of rNAPc2 with fX derivatives that support inhibition of fVIIa·TF. We demonstrate that rNAPc2 can bind with high affinity to zymogen fX, indicating that the activation status of the inhibitory scaffold is not crucial for the inhibition of fVIIa·TF by rNAPc2. The phospholipid membrane composition and the Gla-domain of the fX/fXa play critical roles in the presentation of rNAPc2 that we then show interacts directly with the active site of fVIIa via a reactive site sequence. Together, these data support a mechanism of fVIIa·TF inhibition by rNAPc2, which utilizes an exo-site of either the product of this catalytic complex, fXa, or more uniquely, the substrate zymogen fX to form the final quaternary inhibited complex. Hepes and Tris buffers, bovine serum albumin (BSA), CHAPS, Tween 20 and all other reagents, not indicated otherwise, were from Sigma. Recombinant human factor VIIa (fVIIa) was obtained from Novo Nordisc A/S (Gentofte, Denmark). Recombinant, human full-length tissue factor (TF) was produced using a baculovirus expression system as described (13Ruf W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11631-11636Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Purified human proteins factor X (fX), factor IX (fIX), glutamylglycylarginyl chloromethyl ketone (EGR-ck) modified factor Xa (EGR-fXa), and des-Gla-domain fXa, modified with EGR-ck (des-Gla-EGR-fXa) were obtained from Hematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). These proteins were further purified by immunodepletion of residual fVII. Similarly, residual fX was removed by immunodepletion from the fIX preparations. The contaminating activities of the trace fVII and fX in the fIX preparations were individually assessed in a quantitative assay for the activation of fX by fVIIa·TFPCPS and estimated at ≤0.001% and ≤0.0003%, respectively. The functional, clotting-specific activity of the purified fIX was measured as 305 units/mg in a clotting assay, using fIX deficient plasma (George King, Overland Park, KS). Each preparation of a fXa derivative contained at least 85% of the α-species. Purified human factor Xa (fXa) was prepared from fX as described previously (14Bock P.E. Craig P.A. Olson S.T. Singh P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recombinant tick anticoagulant peptide (rTAP), rNAPc2, and FLAG-rNAPc2 were expressed in the methylotropic yeast Pichia pastorisand purified to homogeneity as previously described (12Stanssens P.

The molecular mass of the recombinant proteins was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry, and protein concentrations determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. Mutagenesis, expression in transfected dihydrofolate reductase-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells, and purification of recombinant factor X (rfX) derivatives and mutants has been described elsewhere (10Shobe J.

All protein preparations were judged homogeneous (>95%), following analysis by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar). The concentration of human fX and fXa were determined using an extinction coefficient at A280( E2801%) of 11.6 (18Di Scipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Davie E.W.

The synthetic phospholipids l-α-palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine (PC) and l-α-stearoyloleoyl phosphatidylserine (PS) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Full-length TF apoprotein was reconstituted into phosholipid vesicles (PLV), consisting of 75% PC (w/w) and 25% PS (w/w) (TFPCPS), or 100% PC (TFPC) in the presence of detergent, as previously described (19Ruf W. Miles D.J. Rehemtulla A. Edgington T.S. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 209-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), followed by dialysis into 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5. The TFPC was used immediately following dialysis. The diameter of the resulting vesicles was measured by light scattering (Fine Particle Technology, Menlo Park, CA), yielding a volume-weighted Gaussian distribution centered at a mean diameter of 83 ± 20 nm (PCPS PLV) and 112 ± 20 nm (PC PLV). The concentration of phospholipids in each preparation was determined by a colorimetric assay for inorganic phosphorus, adapted from Ref. 9Baugh R.J. Broze Jr., G.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol.

The p-nitroanilide-containing chromogenic peptidyl substrate C-2081 fVIIa was synthesized as a trifluoroacetic acid salt, purified to homogeneity using HPLC, and lyophilized. The resulting molecular mass was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. The C-2081 substrate was reconstituted in deionized water just prior to use. The kinetic measurement of fVIIa·TF-mediated release of tritiated activation peptide from radiolabeled fIX ([3H]fIX) was performed as described. (12Stanssens P. Bergum P.W. Gansemans Y. Jespers L.

Briefly, a complex of fVIIa and TFPCPS was formed in 10 mmHepes, 150 mm NaCl, 15 μm BSA, 3.0 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4 (designated assay buffer), for 10 min prior to adding increasing amounts of equimolar rNAPc2 and one of the following fX derivatives: fX, recombinant fX mutants, fXa, EGR-fXa, and a complex of fXa and rTAP (rTAP-fXa), which was formed 45 min prior to adding to the fVIIa·TF complex. Following a 30-min incubation, the reaction was initiated by the addition of the [3H]fIX, and initial velocities were measured over 10 min, as described previously (12Stanssens P. Bergum P.W. Gansemans Y. Jespers L. Laroche Y. Huang S. Maki S.L. Messens J. Lauwereys M. Cappello M. Hotez P.J. Lasters I. Vlasuk G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2149-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The final concentration of reactants in a total volume of 420 μl of assay buffer was: fVIIa (50 pm), TF (2.7 nm), PCPS PLV (6.4 μm), equimolar rNAPc2 and fX derivative (0–1 nm), and [3H]fIX (200 nm, ∼5 × Km), and, when included, rTAP (10 nm). The fX derivatives (0–1 nm) in the absence of rNAPc2 had no effect on the velocity (V0). The ratio of the inhibited reaction velocity (Vi) to the respective uninhibited velocity (V0) (without rNAPc2) was determined for each concentration of fX derivative-rNAPc2 for three to six separate experiments. These data were fit by reiterative nonlinear regression to the quadratic Equation 1 for slow, tight-binding inhibitors (20Morrison J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 185: 269-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 21Morrison J.F. Trends Biochem.

Vi/Vo={(Et−It−Ki*)+[(It+Ki*−Et)2+4Ki*Et]1/2}/2EtEquation 1 All studies were performed in assay buffer at ambient temperature (23.5 ± 0.7 °C). The kinetics of hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate C-2081 by fVIIa were measured under a number of experimental conditions, prior to examining the inhibitory effects of rNAPc2 under these conditions. Reactions were initiated by the addition of uncomplexed fVIIa (10 nm) or fVIIa (2 nm) in complex with 5 nm TF (TFS, TFPC, TFPCPS) to the individual wells of a 96-well plate (Corning), containing C-2081 (0.05–3.0 mm) in a final volume of 125 μl of assay buffer. Where indicated other reagents were added to the following final concentrations: PCPS or PC PLV (6.8 μm), EGR-fXa (20 nm with free fVIIa, or 5 nm with fVIIa·TF). Factor VIIa and TF were incubated for 10 min prior to the addition to the reaction mixture. Initial reaction velocities were measured as a linear increase in the absorbance at 405 nm (A405 nm) over 10 min at 9-s intervals, using a Thermomax kinetic microplate reader. Measurements were made under steady-state conditions, where less than 5% of the substrate was consumed. The Km was derived from the nonlinear regression fit of the averaged velocities of triplicate reactionsversus the respective concentration of C-2081, using Enzfitter software (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Kinetic values were averaged from three independent kinetic determinations, generating the following Km values for each experimental condition: uncomplexed fVIIa (2.6 mm), uncomplexed fVIIa + EGR-fXa (1.8 mm), fVIIa·TF (all TF preparations) (range: 262–356 μm), fVIIa·TF (all TF preparations) + EGR-fXa (range: 272–345 μm). The effect of incubation time on the inhibition of fVIIa and fVIIa·TF amidolytic activity by rNAPc2 varied depending on the particular reaction condition used. The extent to which the inhibition for the eight tested reaction conditions was either kinetically “fastȁ or time-independent, or kinetically “slowȁ or time-dependent determined how the corresponding dissociation constant (Ki orKi* ) was determined (23Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar). The relative inhibitory potency of rNAPc2 was measured over a range of concentrations for each reaction condition by two kinetic procedures, using identical concentrations of reactants: 1) fVIIa was added to a mixture of rNAPc2 and substrate to initiate reactions (no pre-incubation between enzyme and rNAPc2), and 2) rNAPc2 was first pre-incubated with fVIIa for 30 min (inhibition in the absence of substrate), followed by addition of substrate to initiate reactions. If the apparent potency of rNAPc2, measured by each of these two procedures was equivalent, then the interaction of rNAPc2 was judged time-independent or fast. The Ki was measured in subsequent experiments, as detailed below for time-independent inhibition. In contrast, if the apparent potency of rNAPc2 measured by procedure 2 was significantly greater than that measured for procedure 1, i.e. determined to be time-dependent or slow,Ki* was subsequently measured as detailed below for time-dependent inhibition. The potency of rNAPc2 was measured over a range of substrate concentrations in the presence of increasing concentrations of rNAPc2, and when included, of equimolar EGR-fXa or des-Gla EGR-fXa. Reactions were initiated by the addition of either free fVIIa (10 nm), or preformed fVIIa·TF complex (2 nm fVIIa with 5 nm TFS, TFPSPC, or TFPC) to premixed inhibitor and substrate in the wells of microtiter plates. All reactions were performed in triplicate, and contained in 125 μl of assay buffer, containing a range of six to eight inhibitor concentrations [I] and six substrate concentrations [S]. For reactions with free fVIIa, the concentrations were 1–20 μm ([I]) and 0.1–3.0 mm ([S]), and those with fVIIa·TF complexes were 0.5–10 μm ([I]) and 0.1–2.0 mm([S]). The initial velocities measured over 10 min under steady-state conditions for three separate experiments were fit by reiterative nonlinear regression to Equation 2, describing a time-independent, classical, reversible competitive inhibitor, to derive theKi value. V=Vmax/1+(Km/[S])(1+[I]/Ki)Equation 2 Varying concentrations of rNAPc2 and equimolar EGR-fXa (0.00025–1 μm) were pre-incubated with a complex of fVIIa (2 nm) and TFS, TFPC, or TFPSPC (5 nm) for 30 min. Initial velocities were measured, following the addition of substrate (650 μm). Preliminary experiments showed that EGR-Xa in the absence of rNAPc2 had no effect on V0. Ratios of the inhibited reaction velocity (Vi) to the uninhibited velocity (V0) for each concentration of rNAPc2 were fit to the quadratic Equation 1 for slow, tight-binding inhibitors for three separate experiments to give the apparent dissociation constant (Ki*). The rate constants for inhibition of fVIIa·TF by rNAPc2 for each reconstituted TF condition were measured as previously described (25Cha S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1975; 24: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Briefly, the chromogenic substrate C-2081 (800 μm) was added to the wells of a microtiter plate, containing a range of concentrations of rNAPc2 and equimolar EGR-fXa (0–100 nm) in assay buffer. The reactions were initiated by the addition of a preformed complex of fVIIa (2 nm) and TFS, TFPC, or TFPSPC (5 nm). Progress curves generated over 60 min were analyzed using Equation 3 as described by Cha (25Cha S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1975; 24: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) and Williams (26Williams J.W. Morrison J.F.

P=Vst+(Vo−Vs)(1−e−kobst)/kobsEquation 3 The derived, apparent first-order rate constants(kobs), from three separate experiments derived using Equation 3, were fit along with the corresponding (rNAPc2·EGR-fXa) by re-iterative nonlinear regression to Equation 4, which describes a one-step mechanism for slow-binding inhibitors to give the measured constants of k1, andk−1. The derived dissociation inhibitory constant (Ki) was calculated from the ratio ofk−1/k1 . kobs=k−1+k1[I]/(1+[S]/Km)Equation 4 Binding kinetics for derivatives of fX to immunocaptured FLAG-rNAPc2 were determined by surface plasmon resonance, using a BIAcore 2000 instrument (Pharmacia Biosensor). The mAb to the FLAG epitope (Anti-FLAG M1, Eastman Kodak Co.) was immobilized on the surface of a CM5 sensor chip by amine coupling, according to manufacturer's recommendations. Recombinant FLAG-rNAPc2 (0.1 mg/ml) was injected onto the sensor chip to saturate the immobilized antibody in Hepes-buffered saline containing 1 mm CHAPS, 0.005% surfactant P20, 5 mmCaCl2, pH 7.4. The kinetics of binding of various derivatives of fX were measured, following the injection of each protein at different concentrations (3–300 nm). Between runs, the Ca2+-dependent mAb was regenerated by eluting bound FLAG-rNAPc2 with 0.1 m EDTA. The kinetic binding constants (ka,kd, and KD) were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of the data from three separate experiments using software provided by the manufacturer. The association rate constant (ka) was calculated from multiple sensorgrams, representing at least five different concentrations of ligand for each experiment. The dissociation rate constant (kd) was calculated from the initial dissociation phase of the binding curves, and the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) equaled the ratio ofkd/ka (27Kelly C.R. Dickinson C.D. Ruf W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17467-17472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The binding of FLAG-rNAPc2 to immunocaptured fX derivatives was measured by modified enzyme-linked immunoassay detection method. A murine monoclonal antibody (mAb 10) 3T. S. Edgington, unpublished data.produced against human fX, which was shown to recognize all fX derivatives equally well, was used for solid phase immobilization of the various fX-derived inhibitory scaffolds. mAb 10 was bound to microtiter plate wells following an overnight incubation in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C followed by washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v). Blocking with PBS containing 1% BSA (w/v), and 2% mannose (w/v) was followed by washing, and the addition of a saturating amount of one of the fX derivatives (final concentration 50 nm) in Hepes-buffered saline containing 15 μm BSA. Following a 1-h incubation and washing, varying concentrations of FLAG-rNAPc2 (0–100 nm) were added and incubated for 1 h followed by washing and addition of the HRP-anti-FLAG mAb M1 conjugate. Following a 1-h incubation and washing, bound peroxidase activity was visualized using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride hydrate and 1n H2SO4. The end point absorbance (A450–650 nm) was read, and the data were analyzed by fitting A450–650 nm versus [fX derivative] using reiterative nonlinear regression to the binding equation Y = Bmax* [L]/(KD + [L]), where [L] represents the concentration of fX derivative,Bmax the maximal binding, andKD the measured dissociation constant. Three separate binding experiments were performed for each fX derivative, and the reported KD value represented the mean of the three resolved KD values from each of those experiments. rNAPc2 was added to both a preformed complex of fVIIa·TFPCPS, or TFPCPS alone (control), and incubated for 0–5 h at 37 °C. The final concentration of reactants in 300 μl of 25 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, was 90 μmrNAPc2, 1.9 μm TFPCPS, 966 μmPCPS PLV, and 0.9 μm rfVIIa. At various time intervals (0–5 h), aliquots were quenched with EDTA and submitted to SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining, which demonstrated that rNAPc2 was completely cleaved by the fVIIa·TF into two distinct bands by 5 h. The control sample ran as a single band, comparable to the starting material. The remaining sample was reduced and carboxymethylated by adding dithiothreitol (10 mm) and heating at 100 °C for 2 min in denaturing buffer (final concentration 0.1 m Tris, 6m guanidine HCl, pH 8.0) followed by the addition of sodium iodoacetamide (NaIOAc) in denaturing buffer (1 mm) and an additional 30-min incubation in the dark at 23 °C. Additional NaIOAc (40 mm) and dithiothreitol (43 mm) were ad"

The resulting entry of Ca2+ through these channels is an important determinant of the cytoplasmic free Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]i)1necessary for insulin secretion. However, β-cells, like other cells, also have highly structured Ca2+ stores like the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These stores are equipped with Ca2+ pumps and Ca2+ release channels and are thus potentially able to modulate depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling in several ways (1Islam M.S. Intracellular Ca2+ Pools and Ion-Channels Involved in Signal Transduction in Insulin-secreting Cells Ph.D. thesis. Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden1994Google Scholar). They may sequester some of the Ca2+ entering through the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, or they may release additional Ca2+ into the cytoplasm. The latter may be achieved by different mechanisms, e.g. through Ca2+-mediated activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) or direct gating of the intracellular Ca2+ channels by the incoming Ca2+. The latter phenomenon, called Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR), is best known in heart muscle, where a small Ca2+entry through the L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels induces a much larger Ca2+ release through ryanodine receptor Ca2+ channels. CICR, however, is not an exclusive property of ryanodine receptors. The other family of intracellular Ca2+ channels, i.e. the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), as well as the permeability transition pore of mitochondria are also capable of mediating different forms of CICR (2Iino M.

These Ca2+ channels are located on the ER membrane that constitutes one anatomical Ca2+ pool with luminal continuity (7Islam M.S. Kindmark H. Larsson O. Berggren P.-O. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The type 3 isoform of the IP3R is the predominant IP3R in ob/ob mouse β-cells, whereas a ryanodine receptor resembling the type 2 ryanodine receptor of heart is the main ryanodine receptor in these cells (6Takasawa S.

Both of these channels can be considered to be Ca2+-gated Ca2+ channels, raising the possibility that depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling may be amplified by Ca2+ release through these channels. CICR has been considered in β-cells from indirect evidence (10Islam M.S. Rorsman P. Berggren P.-O. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); but the phenomenon has not been demonstrated in situ, and its role in amplification of Ca2+ signaling in these cells has not been explored. Here we demonstrate that β-cells possess a mechanism for amplification of depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling by Ca2+ release from the ER. The ER Ca2+ pools modulate depolarization-induced changes in [Ca2+]i by sequestering Ca2+ from the cytoplasm as well as by releasing Ca2+ into the cytoplasm, a process that is likely to involve CICR.

Cells were cultured on glass coverslips for 1–2 days in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%, v/v), penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.6 μmfura-2/AM for 35 min at 37 °C. Cells were then incubated for an additional 10 min in basal medium containing 125 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.28 mm CaCl2, 25 mm HEPES, 3 mm glucose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4). Coverslips were mounted as the bottom of a perifusion chamber on the stage of an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 35M). The superfusion chamber was designed to allow rapid exchange of fluids, and complete exchange of fluids took place in <3 s. The stage was thermostatically controlled to maintain a temperature of 37 °C in the perifusate inside the chamber. The microscope was connected to a SPEX Fluorolog-2 CM1T11I system for dual wavelength excitation fluorometry. The excitation wavelengths generated by two monochromators were directed to the cell by a dichroic mirror. The emitted light selected by a 510-nm filter was monitored by a photomultiplier. The excitation wavelengths were alternated at a frequency of 1 Hz, and the duration of data collection at each wavelength was 0.33 s. The emission at the excitation wavelength of 340 nm (F340) and that of 380 nm (F380) were used to calculate the fluorescence ratio (R340/380). Single cells or small clusters of cells, isolated optically by means of a diaphragm, were studied by using a 40× 1.3 NA oil immersion objective (Zeiss, Plan Neofluar). Background fluorescence was measured after quenching fura-2 fluorescence with manganese and was subtracted from the traces before calculation of [Ca2+]i. [Ca2+]i was calculated fromR340/380 according to Grynkiewicz et al. (11Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Maximum and minimum fluorescence ratios were determined in separate experiments using thin films of external standards containing 10 μm fura-2 and 2 msucrose in intracellular-like buffer containing 10 μmfura-2 free acid and either 2 mm Ca2+ or no Ca2+ in the presence of 2 mm EGTA. TheKd for the Ca2+·fura-2 complex was taken as 224 nm. To compensate for variations in output light intensity from the two monochromators, all experiments included a fluorescence ratio where both monochromators were set at 360 nm. For comparing the fluorescence properties of Ca2+- or Sr2+-bound fluo-3, we dissolved 1 μm fluo-3 free acid in buffer containing 145 mm KCl and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). The buffer was then divided in to two portions: to one we added SrCl2 (1 mm), and to the other CaCl2 (1 mm). Emission spectra were measured at 490 nm excitation using a SPEX Fluorolog-2 CM1T11I system. Scanning was performed in a quartz cuvette containing a 1-ml solution at 20 °C. Cells were loaded with fluo-3 by incubation with 0.5 μmfluo-3/AM for 35 min, followed by incubation in basal medium for another 10 min. Fluorescence was measured at 490 nm excitation, and emitted light filtered by a 515–565-nm band-pass filter was recorded by a photomultiplier. Voltage-gated Ca2+ currents were recorded using the whole-cell mode of the patch-clamp technique (12Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar). Pipettes were prepared from borosilicate glass capillary tubes, coated with Sylgard resin (Dow Corning) near the tips, and fire-polished and had resistances of 2–6 mega-ohms. Cells were washed with a solution composed of 138 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 1.2 mmMgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The pipette solution contained 150 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 110 mm HCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 3 mm MgATP, and 5 mmHEPES (pH 7.15). N-Methyl-d-glucamine was substituted for K+ in the pipette solution to prevent outwardly directed K+ currents. Currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). Voltage steps were generated, digitized, and stored using the program pClamp (Axon Instruments, Inc.) and Labmaster ADC (Scientific Solutions). The current responses were filtered at 2 kHz. The pulse protocol is given in the figure legends. Numerical data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was judged by Student'st test for unpaired data. β-Cells perifused with basal medium containing 3 mmglucose responded with an increase in the average [Ca2+]i upon depolarization with 30 mm KCl (Fig. 1). Consistent with our previous reports (13Islam M.S. Larsson O. Nilsson T. Berggren P.-O. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the [Ca2+]iincrease was dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+ and was abolished by nimodipine, a specific blocker of the L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. These results suggest that in cultured mouse β-cells and under our experimental conditions, depolarization-induced Ca2+ entry occurs entirely through the L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and that depolarization per se does not induce detectable Ca2+ release from internal stores. Depolarization by KCl yielded a rise in [Ca2+]i, the pattern of which varied from cell to cell. In all cells, however, [Ca2+]i increased in two phases, an initial rapid phase followed by a slower increase to the peak (Fig. 1 A). On examination of a large number of cells, three patterns of [Ca2+]i increase could be discerned (Fig. 1). The most common was one where a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i changed into a slower phase (Fig.1 A). In 6 out of 19 cells, the two phases were separated by a transient dip in [Ca2+]i after the initial rapid phase (Fig. 1 B). In two other cells, the second phase of the increase in [Ca2+]i consisted of a single Ca2+ transient on elevated [Ca2+]i. In some experiments, we used β-cells obtained from Wistar rats instead of ob/ob mice, and the results were similar. A biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i suggested the possibility that multiple sources of Ca2+ may be involved in depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling. To test whether the ER Ca2+ stores contributed to the depolarization-induced changes in [Ca2+]i, we examined [Ca2+]i responses in cells where the ER Ca2+ stores were depleted by thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of SERCA (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmicreticulum Ca2+-ATPases) (14Islam M.S. Berggren P.-O. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Incubation of cells with 250 nm thapsigargin for 35 min depleted the ER Ca2+ pools as indicated by lack of response to carbachol. The resting [Ca2+]i and membrane potential in thapsigargin-treated cells were same as in the controls (Figs. 2 C and3 A), indicating that capacitative Ca2+ entry was unlikely to confound results under these experimental conditions. In ER Ca2+ pool-depleted cells, the [Ca2+]iresponse upon depolarization differed from that in control cells with regard to several aspects. In thapsigargin-treated cells, KCl increased [Ca2+]i with a faster time course, and the decay phase around the peak was also faster (Fig. 2 C). The time courses of increases in [Ca2+]i from the basal level to the peak subsequent to depolarization in control and thapsigargin-treated cells are illustrated in Fig. 2 A. In this figure, where data are presented as semilogarithmic plots, the time course of the increase in [Ca2+]i in control cells clearly deviates from a single exponential. Most strikingly, thapsigargin treatment abolished the slower second phase of the increase in [Ca2+]i seen in the control cells (Fig. 2, A and C). [Ca2+]iincreased more rapidly in thapsigargin-treated cells than in control cells. The maximum rates of increase in [Ca2+]i, calculated as the differences between neighboring points, were 90 ± 14 and 45 ± 6 nm/s in the thapsigargin-treated and control cells, respectively (p = 0.006,n = 28). The times required for [Ca2+]i to rise from basal levels to the peaks were 19 ± 4 and 85 ± 12 s in thapsigargin-treated and control cells, respectively (p < 0.001,n = 30) (Fig. 2 B). Depolarization-induced peak [Ca2+]i was slightly higher in the thapsigargin-treated cells, although the difference was not statistically significant (485 ± 50 and 403 ± 30 nm in thapsigargin-treated and control cells, respectively;n = 26). For comparison of [Ca2+]i response in the two groups, we calculated the integral of the increment in [Ca2+]i over time (∫Δ[Ca2+]i·dt) as an estimate of the amount of Ca2+ presented to the cytoplasm during depolarization. A period of 300 s was chosen for calculating the Ca2+ integral because during sustained depolarization by KCl, [Ca2+]i returned to an elevated steady-state level in most experiments by this time. The steady-state [Ca2+]i measured at 300 s of depolarization was significantly lower in thapsigargin-treated cells (171 ± 16 and 233 ± 11 nm in thapsigargin-treated and control cells, respectively; p= 0.003, n = 26). The time integral of the [Ca2+]i increment during 300 s of stimulation by KCl was ∼30% higher in the control cells compared with that in the Ca2+ pool-depleted cells (p = 0.002, n = 26) (Fig.2 D). In some experiments, we treated cells with a lower concentration of thapsigargin (e.g. 50 nm). This concentration of thapsigargin depleted ER Ca2+ pools almost completely, but such depletion was achieved less consistently. However, a qualitatively similar, although smaller effect on [Ca2+]i response was seen also when cells were treated with 50 nm thapsigargin. In some other experiments, we treated cells with 10 μm cyclopiazonic acid, a reversible inhibitor of SERCA, for 30 min and depolarized the cells with KCl in the continued presence of the substance. The effects of treatment with cyclopiazonic acid were similar to those obtained with thapsigargin.Figure 3Altered [Ca2+]iresponse in thapsigargin-treated cells is not due to nonspecific effects of the substance. A, treatment of cells with a low concentration of thapsigargin (250 nm) for 35 min did not alter the magnitude of voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents through Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane. Cells were depolarized in 10-mV steps (100 ms) to potentials between −60 and +50 mV from a holding potential of −70 mV. The upper traces show examples of currents in the presence and absence of thapsigargin. The lower graph shows compiled data on the I-V relationship. B,neo-thapsigargin, an inactive isomer of thapsigargin, did not alter depolarization-induced [Ca2+]iresponse. Cells were incubated for 35 min in 250 nm neo-thapsigargin. Depolarization by KCl resulted in a biphasic increase in [Ca2+ ]i as in control cells. ER Ca2+ pools were not depleted byneo-thapsigargin since carbachol (CCh) released Ca2+ from the ER. Traces are representative of experiments repeated at least three times. pF, picofarads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We tested whether the reduction in depolarization-induced [Ca2+]i response in thapsigargin-treated cells could be due to inhibition of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+channels by the compound, as has been reported in other cells (15Rossier M.F. Python C.P. Burnay M.M. Schlegel W. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, depolarization-induced whole-cell Ca2+ currents measured by the patch-clamp technique in cells treated with a low concentration of thapsigargin (i.e. 250 nm) were not significantly different from those recorded in controls. To test further if some other nonspecific effects of thapsigargin could account for our results, we treated cells with an analog of the compound epimerized at C-8 (neo-thapsigargin) (16Andersen A. Christensen S.B. Acta Chem. Scand. 1994; 48: 340-346Crossref Google Scholar). When used at low concentrations, this analog of thapsigargin is virtually inactive as an inhibitor of SERCA (17Christensen S.B. Andersen A. Treiman M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B,neo-thapsigargin (250 nm for 35 min) did not deplete the ER Ca2+ pools and also did not alter the pattern of the depolarization-induced increase in [Ca2+]i (cf. Fig. 1 and Fig.2 C). It was a possibility that thapsigargin treatment and the consequent increase in [Ca2+]i caused enhancement of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase activity, thus accounting for the less pronounced [Ca2+]iresponse seen in these cells (18Becker P.L. Singer J.J. Walsh Jr., J.V. Fay F.S. Science. 1989; 244: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To test this, we increased [Ca2+]i by activating the reverse mode of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger by substituting Na+ with N-methyl-d-glucamine in the perifusion medium. This maneuver caused a modest increase in [Ca2+]i, the magnitude of which was not significantly different in thapsigargin-treated cells compared with the untreated controls (data not shown). The results described above suggest the possibility that Ca2+ entering through the L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels might act as a trigger, giving rise to further Ca2+ release from the ER. We intended to visualize the trigger Ca2+ and the released Ca2+ more directly. This could be done by using Sr2+ as a Ca2+ surrogate and by exploiting the differences in the fluorescence properties of Ca2+- and Sr2+-bound fluo-3. We compared the fluorescence spectral properties of fluo-3 in the presence of Ca2+ and Sr2+. Fig.4 A shows the emission spectra of fluo-3 between 500- and 560-nm wavelengths in the presence of saturating concentrations of Ca2+ or Sr2+. As shown, fluo-3 yielded much less fluorescence when it bound Sr2+ compared with when it bound Ca2+. In the experiments illustrated in Fig. 4 (B–D), we used fluo-3/AM instead of fura-2/AM to load the cells. In these experiments, we omitted Ca2+ from the perifusion medium and instead added 1 mm Sr2+ to the medium. Under these conditions, when the cells were depolarized by KCl, there was initially a modest increase in fluorescence presumably due to Sr2+ entry and the resulting increase in [Sr2+]i. Superimposed on this fluorescence, there was a large but transient increase in fluorescence, which was probably caused by Ca2+ release from intracellular stores (Fig. 4 B). To ascertain whether the Ca2+ transients triggered by Sr2+ were due to Ca2+ release from the ER, we depleted the ER Ca2+ stores with thapsigargin and repeated similar experiments. As shown in Fig. 4 C, in thapsigargin-treated cells, despite depolarization-induced Sr2+ entry, there was no Ca2+ spike as seen in the untreated cells. Sr2+ was unable to trigger Ca2+ release also when the common ER Ca2+ pools were depleted by carbachol prior to depolarization by KCl (Fig. 4 D). These results suggest that during sustained depolarization and in association with Ca2+ entry through the L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, there is a release of Ca2+ from the ER. Such a Ca2+ release could be mediated by several mechanisms. The first would involve activation of PI-PLC by Ca2+ entering through the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, leading to formation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and the consequent activation of IP3Rs. The second would involve direct gating of IP3Rs by Ca2+ in the presence of a basal or slightly elevated level of the trisphosphate. The third would involve activation of the ryanodine receptors by Ca2+. To determine whether activation of PI-PLC by Ca2+ was involved, we tried several inhibitors of the enzyme, e.g. neomycin, the ether lipid ET-18-OCH3 (19Powis G. Seewald M.J. Gratas C. Melder D. Riebow J. Modest E.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2835-2840PubMed Google Scholar), and 2-nitro-4-carboxyphenylN,N-diphenylcarbamate (20Walenga R. Vanderhoek J.Y. Feinstein M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6024-6027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we found that these inhibitors themselves alter [Ca2+]ihomeostasis in β-cells by nonspecific mechanisms unrelated to the inhibition of PI-PLC. Neomycin inhibited L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels as studied by the whole-cell mode of the patch-clamp technique, an observation consistent with a previous report (21Duarte C.B. Tome A.R. Forsberg E. Carvalho C.A.M. Carvalho A.P. Santos R.M. Rosario L.M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 244: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). When applied to the resting β-cells, ET-18-OCH3 and 2-nitro-4-carboxyphenyl N,N-diphenylcarbamate increased [Ca2+]i by unknown mechanisms. These substances were therefore not suitable as PI-PLC inhibitors in intact β-cells. We then tested another commonly used inhibitor of PI-PLC,U73122. This substance, despite reported nonspecific effects, appeared suitable for inhibiting PI-PLC in β-cells. We perifused β-cells with 10 μmU73122 for 300 s and then depolarized the cell by KCl in the continued presence of the inhibitor.U73122 itself did not affect [Ca2+]i in β-cells. As shown in Fig.5 A, U73122 did not inhibit the biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i during KCl depolarization (cf. Fig. 5 B). Under these conditions, U73122 inhibited PI-PLC as evidenced by lack of [Ca2+]i response to carbachol in separate experiments. These results indicate that amplification of depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling does not require concomitant activation of PI-PLC by the incoming Ca2+. To directly test if activation of IP3Rs by Ins(1,4,5)P3 or Ca2+ was involved, we intended to use xestospongin C and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, membrane-permeable agents that have been reported to inhibit IP3Rs in neuronal cells (22Gafni J. Munsch J.A. Lam T.H. Catlin M.C. Costa L.G. Molinski T.F. Pessah I.N. Neuron. 1997; 19: 723-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). However, in control experiments, we found that xestospongin C (20 μm) or 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (up to 300 μm) (23Maruyama T. Kanaji T. Nakade S. Kanno T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar) did not inhibit Ca2+ release by Ins(1,4,5)P3-forming agonists like carbachol or ADPβs in β-cells. These agents thus did not appear suitable as membrane-permeable inhibitors of IP3Rs in β-cells. To test if ryanodine receptors were involved in amplifying depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling, we used ryanodine, ruthenium red, and caffeine. We incubated cells with 100 μm ryanodine for 45 min. Such treatment is expected to lock the ryanodine receptors in a subconductance state and thus deplete the ryanodine-sensitive ER Ca2+ pools to a variable extent. The effect of ryanodine treatment on depolarization-induced Ca2+ response was small. When ryanodine-treated cells were depolarized by KCl, the second phase of the [Ca2+]i increase was diminished (Fig.6 B) as compared with that in untreated controls (Fig. 6 A). Consistent with this, the time taken for [Ca2+]i to rise from the basal level to the peak was significantly reduced in ryanodine-treated cells compared with the untreated controls (52 ± 12 and 146 ± 27 s, respectively; p < 0.05, n = 7) (Fig. 6 C). Low concentration of ruthenium red (10 μm), an inhibitor of ryanodine receptors, reduced depolarization-induced [Ca2+]i response (Fig.6 D). We then examined whether agents that sensitize ryanodine receptors can increase depolarization-induced Ca2+ response. Caffeine sensitizes ryanodine receptors to Ca2+, and from previous studies, we know that in situ activation of ryanodine receptors by caffeine requires cAMP-dependent phosphorylation (5Islam M.S. Leibiger I. Leibiger B. Rossi D. Sorrentino V. Ekström T.J. Westerblad H. Andrade F.H. Berggren P.-O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6145-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).

The organism can be transmitted from one mammal to another by Ixodesticks that require blood meals at three different stages of their life cycle (1Burgdorfer W. Barbour A.G. Hayes S.F. Benach J.L. Grunwaldt E. Davis J.P. Science. 1982; 216: 1317-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar). B. burgdorferi has a remarkable ability to adapt to life both in a mammal and an arthropod host. If not successfully treated, Lyme disease and the causative agent can persist for decades in man, demonstrating that the spirochete can effectively combat or avoid the host defense systems. At least one means of avoidance is by modification of surface proteins. Surface proteins onBorrelia are presumably directly involved in interactions with molecules of the host. These surface proteins are mostly lipoproteins and several mechanisms for regulating their expression have been described (2Schwan T.G. Hinnebusch B.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1938-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Analyses of the B. burgdorferigenome suggest that the organism has the potential of producing more than 100 different lipoproteins that could become anchored to the outer membrane (3Casjens S. Palmer N. van Vugt R. Huang W.M. Stevenson B. Rosa P. Lathigra R. Sutton G. Peterson J. Dodson R.J. Haft D. Hickey E. Gwinn M. White O. Fraser C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 490-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). One of these surface proteins, OspC,1 is immunodominant in the early stages of Lyme disease (4Wilske B. Preac-Mursic V.

OspC is a basic protein (isoelectric point ∼9.0) with a subunit molecular weight of 20 kDa. It is normally not produced while the spirochete is in the arthropod, but can be detected on the Borrelia in the gut of feeding ticks and in a mammalian host (5Montgomery R.R. Malawista S.E.

The OspC expression is carefully regulated possibly in a temperature-dependent manner (6Schwan T.G. Piesman J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 382-388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of OspC has been proposed to facilitate the migration ofB. burgdorferi from midgut to the salivary glands of ticks and thereby participates in the transmission of the spirochete from tick to the mammalian host (10Gilmore Jr., R.D. Piesman J. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These attributes make OspC an obvious candidate for vaccine development and initial studies indicate that vaccination with recombinant OspC can, in fact, protect mice against Lyme disease (11Preac-Mursic V.

Mapping of protective epitopes on OspC has suggested that these are conformation-dependent and may be located at several sites in the OspC protein (15Gilmore Jr., R.D. Mbow M.L. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5463-5469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alignment of several known OspC sequences derived from different organisms ofB. burgdorferi sensu lato suggest that conserved regions are interspersed with variable regions (17Jauris-Heipke S.

FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 124: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These conserved regions have been targeted in immunodiagnostic approaches for Lyme disease detection (19Theisen M. Frederiksen B. Lebech A.-M. Vuust J. Hansen K. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1993; 31: 2570-2576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we report the crystal structure of OspC as a prelude to structure-based development of peptide vaccines against Lyme disease. Initial experiments were conducted with a recombinant form of OspC covering the entire coding region of the mature form of OspC from B. burgdorferistrain N40 (20Stevenson B. Bockenstedt L.K. Barthold S.W. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3568-3571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The target sequence was obtained by the polymerase chain reaction using Taq DNA polymerase and ligated into a modified form of the pQE-30 expression vector (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). To enable cleavage of the N-terminal His6-tag, a thrombin (trypsin) cleavage site was introduced immediately following the histidine encoding region using the BamHI andSacI restriction sites of the vector. DNA sequence analysis confirmed that the resulting OspC nucleotide sequence was identical to that of the published sequence. The purified protein formed crystals after several months. However, analyses of the crystallized protein by N-terminal sequencing and MALDI-MS revealed that the first 13 N-terminal residues (Cys19–Asn31) had been cleaved off. A second expression construct was therefore made that lacked these residues and started at residue Ser32. The resulting construct (B.b. rOSPC) was transformed into JM101 cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which were grown at 37 °C in Luria Broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. When the cell culture reached an optical density of A600 = 0.6, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to 1 mm to induce recombinant protein expression. Two hours later, cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication and french press in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 m NaCl. The homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g, and the supernatant was applied at 4 °C to a Ni2+ charged HiTrap-chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein was eluted with an imidazole gradient, and fractions containing OspC were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mmdithiothreitol. OspC (10 mg/ml) was incubated with trypsin (2 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 2 h to cleave off the His tag before the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 0.1 mphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Subsequently, pooled OspC fractions were loaded onto a HiLoad Superdex-HR 75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Fractions containing the purified protein were pooled and concentrated to 30 mg protein/ml and used for the crystallization trials. A third protein construct was engineered to allow MAD experiments using a selenomethionine (SeMet) derivative. Because OspC does not contain any methionines, residues Leu111 and Leu119were mutated to Met. DNA sequencing of the resulting clone confirmed the correct incorporation of the methionine mutations and indicated an unintentional mutation of Asn116 to Leu. After transforming this plasmid into the methionine autotroph B843(DE3) cells (Novagen, Madison, WI), selenomethionated OspC was produced by standard methods (21Davies C. Heath R.J. White S.W. Rock C.O. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 185-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and purified using the same procedure as described for the native protein. Initial crystals were obtained using the hanging drop method in condition no. 43 of the Crystal Screen I from Hampton Research. High diffraction quality crystals were produced to a size of ∼0.6 × 0.4 × 0.1 mm in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 12% (w/v) polyethylene glycolMr 1,500 and with a protein concentration of 10–15 mg/ml. After soaking in cryoprotectant solution (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 15% polyethylene glycol Mr 400, 20% polyethylene glycol Mr 1,500) or paratone oil for 1 min, the crystals were flash cooled to 100 K. Crystals of the native protein were observed in the space groupP21212 with a = 31.9 Å, b = 46.9 Å, and c = 110.1 Å, whereas the selenomethionine derivative formed crystals of the space group P21 with a = 28 Å,b = 45 Å, and c = 102 Å. Native data were collected to 2.6 Å resolution on a MacScience image-plate-detector and using a RIGAKU rotating anode generator equipped with osmic mirrors. Initial phases were determined by MAD (22Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) using a SeMet derivative of OspC. MAD data were collected at beamline 14-BM-D at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory to 3 Å resolution on a charge-coupled device area detector (ADSC Q4) at three wavelengths near the selenium absorption edge (see Table I). All native and MAD data were processed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The program SOLVE (24Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) was used to locate the four selenium sites. Phases obtained from SOLVE (mean figure of merit 65 to 3.5 Å) were improved by solvent flattening and noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging as implemented in DM (Density Modification, Ref. 25Cowtan K. Joint CCP 4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) and CNS (Crystallographic & NMR System, Ref. 26Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

At this stage the model for one subunit was used to obtain molecular replacement solution of the native P21212 space group using CNS and data to 3.0 Å resolution. The final solution had an R-factor of 0.36 after rigid body refinement. Reflections up to 2.5 Å were included in subsequent refinement, and the structure was fit using 2‖Fo‖-‖Fc‖ϕc and composite omit electron density maps calculated with CNS. Backbone geometry of the final model did not have any residue in the disallowed regions as verified by PROCHECK (28Laskowski R.A. Mac Arthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab The OspC crystal structure was refined to 2.5 Å resolution and a final R factor of 19.6% (Rfree of 26.2%). Both the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein appear to be quite flexible in OspC as we were unable to produce crystals unless the first 13 residues were removed from the initial recombinant protein. In addition, the first eight N-terminal and the last six C-terminal residues from the truncated protein could not be located in the electron density maps. The electron density for the rest of the protein was quite well resolved in the SeMet MAD electron density maps. The final model showed excellent fit to omit electron density maps (Fig.1) and exhibited good stereochemistry with over 90% of the residues in the most favored regions and none in the generously allowed or disallowed regions. In native P21212 crystals, OspC crystallizes such that a biological dimer (70 Å × 50 Å × 30 Å) is generated by a 2-fold crystallographic axis. A single subunit of OspC is composed of five parallel α-helices and two short β-strands (Fig. 2, a and b). Two long helices, α1 (residues 43–74) and α5 (residues 169–196), from each subunit pack together to form a core four-helix bundle that extends nearly the full-length of the protein. These α-helices pack closely together such that N and C termini, which define the membrane proximal end of both subunits, are in close proximity to each other. At the membrane distal end, however, the four helices diverge. The remaining helices, α2 (residues 94–112) and α3 (residues 119–144), together with an additional short helix α4 (residues 151–157) define the outer surface-exposed region. The residues connecting the helices α1 and α2 form two short anti-parallel β-strands, β1 (residues 78–82) and β2 (residues 85–89), which reside atop the surface-exposed end of OspC (Fig. 2 b). The dimer interface of OspC buries ∼22% of the accessible surface area of each subunit. The buried surface is composed primarily of hydrophobic residues. At the proximal end, residues contributing to the subunit interactions (Ile49, Asn53, Leu57, Lys60, Glu61, Leu197) are located in the helices α1 and α5. At the membrane distal end, most of the interactions involved in dimerization are from the small β-sheet, which packs against the helices α2 and α3. Specifically, the sidechain of residue Ile81 is embedded in a hydrophobic pocket formed by residues Leu96, Leu137, Leu144, Leu149, and Tyr101 of the other subunit. In addition, Leu86interacts with Tyr101 and Ala102 of the other subunit. The alignment of several OspC sequences (Fig.3 a) reveals that most residues supporting the dimer formation are highly conserved. In addition, several surface-exposed residues from the membrane proximal end of the two long α-helices are conserved (Fig. 3 b). Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments performed at the Protein Interaction Facility, University of Utah (Salt Lake City, UT; data not shown) and preliminary NMR data (29Huang X. Link K. Koide A. Dunn J.J. Luft B.J. Koide S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 14: 283-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) confirm that recombinant OspC is able to form dimers in solution. Furthermore, Zückert et al. (30Zückert W.R. Kerentseva T.A. Lawson C.L. Barbour A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 457-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) recently reported that the recombinant and the native lipoprotein are dimeric. The surface of OspC contains several ionizable residues that impart a distinct electrostatic potential at each face as shown in Fig.3 c. Ten glutamate and aspartate residues make a highly electronegative surface on the face formed by helices α3 and α4. This region is surrounded by several lysine residues on either side. The alternating charged areas on the surface of the protein are perhaps important for orienting the OspC dimers so that they can form multimers or even lattices on the spirochetes surface. The surface adjacent to the dimer interface shows a highly negatively charged cavity (Fig. 3 c), which might be involved in protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions, although a ligand for OspC has not been identified to date. Toward the membrane proximal region, the surface is positively charged because of the presence of several conserved lysine residues in helices α1 and α5 (Fig. 3). With the exception of a small pocket formed by residues Lys92, Asp147, and Asn148, the putative membrane distal region of OspC is less polar in nature. Most of the residues lining this region of the OspC molecule are located in the variable sequence regions and thus, may not be critical for a conserved function. The overall fold of OspC is very different from that of OspA, the only other outer surface lipoprotein from Borrelia with known structure. OspA is composed almost entirely of β-strands (31Li H. Dunn J.J. Luft B.J. Lawson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3584-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This suggests that structural diversity of the outer surface antigens may contribute to the ability of Borrelia to generate variability on its surface. Whereas no structural homologs of OspC could previously be identified in the Protein Data Bank based on its primary sequence alone, using the three-dimensional structure, we identified two other surface proteins that are structurally similar to OspC. OspC shows the most resemblance to the ligand-binding domain of the Salmonella typhimurium aspartate receptor (32Yeh J.I. Biemann H.P. Prive G.G. Pandit J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 186-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), a receptor involved in signaling and chemotaxis (Fig. 2,c and d). One of the major structural differences between the two proteins is in the way they associate with the membrane; OspC anchors to the membrane by its covalently attached lipid, and the aspartate receptor has a transmembrane domain (33Chervitz S.A. Falke J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2545-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of the aspartate receptor shares only 15% sequence identity with OspC, but adopts a very similar structure consisting of a homodimer where two four-helical antiparallel bundles associate to form a quasi-four-helical bundle (Fig. 2, c and d). The two structures show a root mean square deviation of 2.4 Å upon superimposition of 86 Cα atoms of a single subunit. The residues forming the aspartate binding pocket in the aspartate receptor are located at the distal end of the two long helices and are contributed by both subunits. Whereas none of these residues are conserved in OspC, the location of the aspartate binding site is analogous to the charged cavity observed on the OspC surface. The side chains of residues Lys60, Glu63, Asp70, and Glu71 located on helix α1 of one subunit, and residues Glu61 and Lys109 of the second subunit line this charged cavity that forms near the dimer interface. All of the residues are strictly conserved in the differentBorrelia strains. It is tempting to speculate that this pocket may be responsible for recognition of a yet unknown ligand of OspC. The aspartate receptor lacks the region containing two β-strands and, consequently, the two subunits exhibit a less extensive interface. The dimer interface of the aspartate receptor buries no more than 9% of the total accessible surface area of each subunit. The weaker interaction has been proposed to facilitate the intersubunit rotation/translation upon binding of aspartate necessary for chemotactic signaling (32Yeh J.I. Biemann H.P. Prive G.G. Pandit J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 186-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In OspC, however, interactions of the β-strands with helices appear to lock the dimer into a much more rigid conformation. Another protein with a similar structure to OspC is the variant surface glycoprotein (vsg) from Trypanosoma brucei (34Blum M.L Down J.A Gurnett A.M. Carrington M. Turner M.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Interactions of the two subunits in this dimeric surface antigen is also formed by two α-helices and a small β-sheet. It is not clear whether the presence of the small β-strands has an additional functionality beyond stabilization of the dimers. OspC has significant amino acid sequence homology to variable major proteins (vmp) from the relapsing fever causing Borrelia hermsii and Borrelia turicatae (35Cadavid D. Pennington P.M. Kerentseva T.A. Bergstrom S. Barbour A.G. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3352-3360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conserved residues are primarily in the first two α-helices, including all of the amino acids that form the putative binding pocket previously described. Furthermore, circular dichroism spectra of recombinant forms of the two proteins are indistinguishable (30Zückert W.R. Kerentseva T.A. Lawson C.L. Barbour A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 457-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, it would not be surprising if the vmps share similar structures and functions. It is noteworthy that some members of the vmp family have been previously shown to resemble the trypanosomal vsg proteins (36Burman N. Bergstrom S. Restrepo B.I. Barbour A.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 10: 1715-1726Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) suggesting that the relapsing fever spirochetes adopt strategies of antigenic variation similar to what have been observed for trypanosomes. Trypanosomes move silent copies of the vsggene to the expression site, and in a similar way the spirochetes move the vmp genes. Therefore, the structural similarity observed between the OspC-vmp and vsg families, though minimal, points to possible functional and mechanistic similarities in the two pathogens. Recent reports have identified the protective epitope for OspC in different strains of B. burgdorferi sensu lato strains (15Gilmore Jr., R.D. Mbow M.L. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5463-5469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Mathiesen M.J. Holm A. Christiansen M. Blom J. Hansen K. Ostergaard S. Theisen M. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4073-4079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of B. garinii,only the C-terminal end was shown to be responsible for immunological recognition (37Mathiesen M.J. Holm A. Christiansen M. Blom J. Hansen K. Ostergaard S. Theisen M. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4073-4079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) whereas for B. burgdorferi immunological studies demonstrated that the first 7 N-terminal or last 13 C-terminal residues were essential for antibody recognition and the binding was conformational-dependent (15Gilmore Jr., R.D. Mbow M.L. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5463-5469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The adjacent location of N- and C-terminal residues in the membrane proximal region of OspC explains how the termini can be recognized by a single antibody. Because these residues are neither well ordered in the crystal structure nor show any significant propensity for a secondary structural element from predictions (data not presented), their interdependence for antibody recognition is probably because the overall fold brings the termini in close proximity to each other. Based on the structure and the aligned Borrelia sequences, most of the variable regions are found on the β-strands and the two loops connecting helices α2 with α3 and helices α3 with α4 (Fig. 3 a). These regions are located at the putative membrane distal end of the protein, far away from the identified protective epitopes. Obviously these regions would be more accessible to antibodies. However, conserved regions of the protein are also found on the highly ordered and accessible surface of the OspC structure. Helices α1 and α2 are of particular interest, based on their high degree of conservation and this aforementioned resemblance to a ligand binding cavity. Immunization experiments with synthetic peptides from these regions could contribute to the development of a Lyme disease vaccine.

https://openalex.org/W2037646515,"Apg7p/Cvt2p, a protein-activating enzyme, is essential for both the Apg12p-Apg5p conjugation system and the Apg8p membrane targeting in autophagy and cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. Similar to the ubiquitin-conjugating system, both Apg12p and Apg8p are activated by Apg7p, an E1-like enzyme. Apg12p is then transferred to Apg10p, an E2-like enzyme, and conjugated with Apg5p, whereas Apg8p is transferred to Apg3p, another E2-like enzyme, followed by conjugation with phosphatidylethanolamine. Evidence is presented here that Apg7p forms a homodimer with two active-site cysteine residues via the C-terminal region. The dimerization of Apg7p is independent of the other Apg proteins and facilitated by overexpressed Apg12p. The C-terminal 123 amino acids of Apg7p (residues 508 to 630 out of 630 amino acids) are sufficient for its dimerization, where there is neither an ATP binding domain nor an active-site cysteine essential for its E1 activity. The deletion of its carboxyl 40 amino acids (residues 591–630 out of 630 amino acids) results in several defects of not only Apg7p dimerization but also interactions with two substrates, Apg12p and Apg8p and Apg12p-Apg5p conjugation, whereas the mutant Apg7p contains both an ATP binding domain and an active-site cysteine. Furthermore, the carboxyl 40 amino acids of Apg7p are also essential for the interaction of Apg7p with Apg3p to form the E1-E2 complex for Apg8p. These results suggest that Apg7p forms a homodimer via the C-terminal region and that the C-terminal region is essential for both the activity of the E1 enzyme for Apg12p and Apg8p as well as the formation of an E1-E2 complex for Apg8p."

Recently we showed that CFTR regulates Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity in model systems (7Lee M.G. Wigley W.C. Zeng W. Noel L.E. Marino C.R. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. J. Biol.

At the resting state HCO3−-secreting cells and tissues need to salvage the HCO3−leaking to or entering the duct lumen. That is, HCO3−-secreting cells should have HCO3−-absorbing mechanisms that are active in the resting state and are inhibited in the stimulated state. There is no knowledge in acinar cells and very little is known of the molecular and functional nature of these mechanisms in duct cells of any secretory gland. Early work with the rat SMG duct identified a ductal Na+/H+ exchange activity with pharmacological characteristics of isoform 2 of the NHE family (NHE2) (9Paulais M. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Turner R.J. Am.

Physiol. 1997; 503: 583-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we used RT-PCR analysis and immunocytochemistry to show expression of NHE1 in the basolateral membrane (BLM) and NHE2 and NHE3 in the luminal membrane (LM) of the rat SMG duct (11Lee M.G. Schultheis P.J. Yan M. Shull G.E. Bookstein C. Chang E. Tse M. Donowitz M. Park K. Muallem S. J. Physiol. 1998; 513: 341-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A similar approach was used to report expression of NHE1 in the BLM and NHE3 in the LM of the rat parotid gland duct (12Park K. Olschowka J.A. Richardson L.A. Bookstein C. Chang E.B. Melvin J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G470-G478PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, based on functional assays and pharmacological characterization, we concluded that only NHE1 and NHE2 are functional in the SMG duct (11Lee M.G. Schultheis P.J. Yan M. Shull G.E. Bookstein C. Chang E. Tse M. Donowitz M. Park K. Muallem S. J. Physiol. 1998; 513: 341-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and Park et al. (12Park K. Olschowka J.A. Richardson L.A. Bookstein C. Chang E.B. Melvin J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G470-G478PubMed Google Scholar) conclude that NHE1 and NHE3 are functional in the parotid duct. In a more recent work, we used animals in which the NHE2 and theNHE3 genes were disrupted to show that NHE3 and a novel, unidentified Na+-dependent HOE 694 (HOE)- and EIPA-sensitive mechanism mediate HCO3−salvage mechanism in the pancreatic duct (13Lee M.G. Ahn W. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Seo J.T. Schultheis P.J. Shull G.E. Kim K.H. Muallem S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, these studies (13Lee M.G. Ahn W. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Seo J.T. Schultheis P.J. Shull G.E. Kim K.H. Muallem S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) did not identify the novel luminal Na+-dependent, HOE- and EIPA-sensitive mechanism and did not exclude the possibility that disruption of one gene resulted in a compensatory up-regulation of the second gene to increase luminal NHE activity back to normal, thus resulting in a lack of phenotype in ducts from NHE2−/− and/or NHE3−/− mice. H+/HCO3− transport mechanisms by acinar cells are only partially known, and their possible role in transcellular HCO3− transport is completely unknown. Salivary gland (11Lee M.G. Schultheis P.J.

Kurtz I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17689-17695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). An antibody that recognizes kNBC1 and pNBC1 was used to suggest localization of the protein in the BLM (17Marino C.R. Jeanes V. Boron W.F. Schmitt B.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G487-G494PubMed Google Scholar, 18Thevenod F. Roussa E. Schmitt B.M. Romero M.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Which NBC isoforms are expressed in salivary gland acinar and duct cells, their properties, and physiological roles are not known. In the present work, we first analyzed H+/HCO3− transport in interlobular and the microperfused main SMG ducts from WT, NHE2−/−, NHE3−/−, and NHE2−/−;NHE3−/− double knock-out mice. We found functional NHE1-like activity in the BLM, and although expressed in duct cells, neither NHE2 nor NHE3 participates in H+/HCO3− fluxes by these cells. Measurement of Na+-dependent H+/HCO3− transport showed that in the absence of HCO3− SMG acinar cells recovered from an acid load by a mechanism that was inhibited by HOE and EIPA with an IC50 of 130 and 23 nm, respectively. HCO3− activated two transporters, a DIDS-sensitive and EIPA-insensitive and a DIDS-insensitive mechanism that was inhibited by EIPA with an IC50 of about 1.3 μm. Duct cells also expressed similar mechanisms except that the mechanism with the IC50 for EIPA of 1.3 μm in the LM transported both OH− and HCO3−. RT-PCR analysis and immunolocalization showed that pNBC1 is expressed in the BLM of SMG acinar and duct cells, consistent with the presence of a DIDS-sensitive/EIPA-insensitive mechanism in these cells. Acinar and duct cells also expressed selective NBC3 splice variants. NBC3 was localized to the LM of both cell types and may account for the cell-specific DIDS-insensitive/EIPA-sensitive Na+-dependent HCO3− or OH−/HCO3− transport by acinar and duct cells, respectively. 2′7′-bis (carboxyethyl)-5-carboxyfluorescein)-AM (BCECF-AM) and H2DIDS were from Molecular Probes, and collagenase CLS4 was from Worthington, Freehold, NJ. EIPA was from Research Biochemicals International, and DIDS was from Sigma. HOE 694 was a generous gift from Dr. Hans Lang, Avertis, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Two affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies were raised against synthetic peptides derived from the N terminus of pNBC1: pNBC1a (amino acids 1–19) and pNBC1b (amino acids 51- 69, coupled to an N-terminal cysteine). The affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to kNBC1 was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 11–24, coupled to an N-terminal cysteine. The polyclonal antibody against NBC3 was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 1197–1214 of the C terminus of NCB3 (19Pushkin A. Abuladze N. Lee I. Newman D. Hwang J. Kurtz I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16569-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This sequence is almost identical to the C-terminal sequence of the known rodent NBC3 splice variants (20Choi I. Aalkjaer C. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 2000; 405: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The standard perfusion solution (solution A) contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), and 10 mm glucose. Na+-free solutions were prepared by replacing Na+ withN-methyl-d-glucamine+. HCO3−-buffered solutions were prepared by replacing 25 mm NaCl orN-methyl-d-glucamine+-Cl−with 25 mm NaHCO3 or choline-HCO3, respectively, and reducing HEPES to 5 mm. HCO3−-buffered solutions were gassed with 5% CO2, 95% O2. The osmolarity of all solutions was adjusted to 310 mosmol with the major salt. Animals were anesthetized (40 mg/kg) or killed (200–250 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital and cervical dislocation according to NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Mice with targeted disruption of the NHE2 and NHE3 genes were generated as described previously (21Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J.

Heterozygote NHE2+/−;NHE3+/− mice were mated to generate the homozygote double knock-out NHE2−/−;NHE3−/− mice. Animals were typed by tail DNA before use. Deletion of the proteins was verified by Western blot (23Shah M. Lee M.G. Schulcheis P.J. Shull G.E. Muallem S. Baum M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1141-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and immunocytochemistry (11Lee M.G. Schultheis P.J. Yan M. Shull G.E. Bookstein C. Chang E. Tse M. Donowitz M. Park K.

Physiol. 1999; 276: G470-G478PubMed Google Scholar). Animals had free access to food and water and were used at 1–2 months of age. The procedures for preparation of isolated interlobular ducts and acini and for preparation and perfusion of the main SMG duct were similar to those described before (11Lee M.G. Schultheis P.J. Yan M. Shull G.E. Bookstein C. Chang E. Tse M. Donowitz M. Park K. Muallem S. J. Physiol. 1998; 513: 341-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In brief, for preparation of a mixture of acini and interlobular ducts, the mouse SMGs were removed into solution A supplemented with 10 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.02% trypsin inhibitor, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (PSA), minced, and digested in the same solution that contained 0.5 mg/ml collagenase CLS4. The digested tissue was washed three times with PSA, and the cells were used for measurement of pHi. For perfusion of the main duct, the mice were anesthetized, and the SMGs were exposed and cleared of connective tissue around the ducts. The ducts were cut and transferred to a perfusion chamber and prepared for luminal and bath perfusion. For pHi measurement, ducts were loaded with BCECF by including the BCECF-AM in the luminal perfusate. Isolated ducts and acini were incubated with 2 μm BCECF-AM for 10 min at room temperature, washed once with PSA, and kept on ice until plating on coverslips in the perfusion chamber. Fluorescence of isolated cells or the perfused ducts was measured by photon counting using a Photon Technology International system. BCECF fluorescence was recorded at excitation wavelengths of 440 and 490 nm and an emission wavelength above 530 nm. The 490/440 fluorescence ratios were calibrated using the high potassium nigericin procedure described before (11Lee M.G. Schultheis P.J. Yan M. Shull G.E. Bookstein C. Chang E. Tse M. Donowitz M.

Chem. 1990; 265: 12806-12812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For preparation of mRNA, digested cells were placed in a Petri dish, and about 30–50 acinar clusters of 3–5 cells or small duct fragments were collected by glass micropipettes pre-soaked in solution A containing 25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. This procedure was used to avoid possible contamination of the preparations with nerve terminals and blood vessels and contamination of acinar and duct cells with each other. The cells were ejected into an mRNA extraction solution to prepare mRNA and then cDNA, as detailed before (11Lee M.G. Schultheis P.J. Yan M. Shull G.E. Bookstein C. Chang E. Tse M. Donowitz M.

The PCR primers used to detect the transcripts shown in Fig. 5 are as follows: β-actin sense, TGTTACCAACTGGGACGACA, antisense, TCTCAGCTGTGGTGGTGAAG (392 bp); pNBC1 sense, ATGTGTGTGATGAAGAAGAAGTAGAAG, antisense, GACCGAAGGTTGGATTTCTTG (622 bp); kNBC1 sense, CACTGAAAATGTGGAAGGGAAG, antisense, GACCGAAGGTTGGATTTCTTG (531 bp); NBCn1B+D sense, CTGACCCTCACTTGCTTGAA, antisense, CTATGTCTTCCTCAGGCGGAT (342 bp); NBCn1C sense, ATAGGGAAAGGCCTGTCAGCCTC, antisense, GAGAAGCCAAAATCCCTGG (389 bp); NBCn1B sense, TCCGATGCCAGTTCTATATGG, antisense, CAGGGCTATATTTTAGGGTC (473 bp); NBCn1C+D sense, AGAGCAGAAGAATGAGGAA, antisense, TCATGGAAAGTGCCTTCCAC (2.54 kilobase pairs); NBCn1D sense, CTGACCCTCACTTGCTTGAA, antisense, TCATGGAAAGTGCCTTCCAC (2.9 kilobase pairs). Except for NBCn1C+D and NBCn1D, the conditions for all PCR reactions were a hot start of 3 min at 95 °C followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 90 s at 58 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. Reactions were terminated by a 5-min incubation at 72 °C and cooling to 10 °C. For NBCn1C+D and NBCn1D, the 35 cycles were 1 min at 94 °C, 150 s at 60 °C, and 150 s at 72 °C. All short amplified PCR products were isolated and sequenced to verify their identity. Between 600–700 bases were sequenced from each end of NBCn1C+D and NBCn1D fragments and found to be 100% identical to the corresponding sequences. The NBCn1C+D primers were used to ascertain the lack of mRNA for these NBC3 splice variants in the duct. Isolated cells and tissue sections were placed on a polylysine-coated glass coverslips and allowed to attach for at least 30 min at room temperature before fixation and permeabilization with cold methanol. The staining procedure and various solutions used are listed in Refs. 11Lee M.G. Schultheis P.J. Yan M. Shull G.E. Bookstein C. Chang E. Tse M. Donowitz M. Park K. Muallem S. J.

Each of the primary antibodies was incubated with the peptide used to raise the antibodies, and the peptide-blocked antibodies were used as controls. The antibodies were used at a 1:250–1:500 dilution and detected by a fluorescein-tagged secondary donkey anti-rabbit antibodies. Images were collected by a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope. Previous work reported an EIPA- and HOE-sensitive, Na+-dependent H+efflux (or OH− influx) mechanism in isolated rat SMG acinar and duct cells (11Lee M.G. Schultheis P.J. Yan M. Shull G.E.

Fig. 1extends these findings to cells from the mouse SMG so that mice with disrupted genes can be used to study the role of the transporters of interest in cellular H+/OH−/HCO3−fluxes. Fig. 1 A shows measurement of Na+-dependent pHi increase in intralobular duct fragment isolated from the SMG of a WT mouse. The ducts were acidified by a transient exposure to a solution containing 20 mm NH4+ and incubation in a Na+-free solution. pHi increase was initiated by perfusing the ducts with a Na+-containing solution. The ducts were treated with different concentrations of the NHE inhibitor HOE 694 (HOE) to measure the sensitivity of the Na+-dependent pHi increase to HOE. Similar experiments were performed with acinar cells, and all experiments are summarized in Fig. 4 below. In the absence of HCO3−, the Na+-dependent recovery from an acid load in acinar cells is about 20-fold more sensitive to HOE than that in duct cells. Fig. 1 B shows the HOE sensitivity of the Na+-dependent H+ efflux (or OH− influx) in the BLM and LM of the perfused mouse SMG duct. Similar to findings with the rat SMG (11Lee M.G. Schultheis P.J.

Physiol. 1998; 513: 341-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the BLM activity was completely inhibited by 5 μm HOE. By contrast, 50 μm HOE were needed to inhibit the LM activity by about 86 ± 11% (n = 7).Figure 4HOE sensitivity of Na+-dependent H+/OH−transport by the SMG intralobular duct of WT and mutant mice.Results of experiments similar to those in Figs.

Schultheis P.J. Shull G.E. Kim K.H. Muallem S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), showed that the mouse SMG acinar cells express mRNA for NHE1, and the mouse SMG duct expresses mRNA for NHE1, NHE2, and NHE3 but not for NHE4 and NHE5 (not shown). Based on the sensitivity to HOE of the known NHE isoforms (25Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the results in Fig. 1 B suggest that the duct expresses functional NHE1 in the BLM and NHE2 in the LM. However, further analysis of Na+-dependent H+/OH− transport in ducts from NHE knockout mice showed that this is not the case. Fig.2 shows individual examples, and Fig. 4summarizes the results of multiple experiments performed with SMG ducts prepared from NHE2−/− and NHE3−/− mice. The Na+-dependent H+/OH−fluxes and their sensitivity to HOE were the same in SMG ducts of WT, NHE2−/−, and NHE3−/− mice. The results in Fig. 2 are different from those obtained in the kidney proximal tubule (23Shah M. Lee M.G. Schulcheis P.J. Shull G.E. Muallem S. Baum M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1141-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and the pancreatic duct (13Lee M.G. Ahn W. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Seo J.T. Schultheis P.J. Shull G.E. Kim K.H. Muallem S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), in which deletion of NHE3 reduced the rate of Na+-dependent H+/OH− fluxes across the LM by about 50%. One possibility is that deletion of NHE3 from the SMG resulted in a compensatory increase in NHE2 activity. To address this possibility, we obtained a double NHE2−/−;NHE3−/− knock-out mice and measured H+/OH− fluxes in SMG acinar and duct cells of these mice. Figs.3 A and4 show that the HOE sensitivity of Na+-dependent H+/OH−fluxes in SMG intralobular ducts of WT and NHE2−/−;NHE3−/− mice are no different. Fig. 3 B shows that in the absence of HCO3−, 2 μm HOE inhibited better than 90% (n = 3) of NHE activity in SMG acinar cells of NHE2−/−; NHE3−/− mice. Finally, Fig. 3 C shows that the properties of the BLM and the LM H+/OH− fluxes in the main SMG duct of the NHE2−/−;NHE3−/− mice are not different from those found for the SMG ducts of WT mice (Fig. 1). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis and immunolocalization led us (11Lee M.G. Schultheis P.J. Yan M. Shull G.E. Bookstein C. Chang E. Tse M. Donowitz M. Park K. Muallem S. J.

In cytochrome P450 enzymes, the heme sits deep inside the protein with its iron ligated to a cysteine thiolate group and the sixth iron coordination site occupied by a water molecule in the substrate-free state (1Cytochrome, P450: Structure.in: Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Mecha-nism, and Biochemistry. Plenum Publishing Corp, New York1995: 145-303Google Scholar). This coordination arrangement gives cytochrome P450 enzymes their unique spectral and catalytic properties. These enzymes are involved in many vital processes, including the biosynthesis of steroids and other lipophilic physiological effectors, the metabolism of drugs, and the degradation of xenobiotics. A unique feature of the cytochrome P450 enzymes is their ability to catalyze the hydroxylation of unactivated hydrocarbons under physiological conditions rather than the extreme conditions required for the reaction to occur under uncatalyzed conditions. Sequence homologies within the heme-binding region of the protein suggest that, despite the existence of numerous P450 forms with different substrate specificities, individual P450 enzymes share a common catalytic mechanism of oxygen activation.Work in this laboratory has focused on the P450 enzymes of family 4 (CYP4), especially the four known rat isoforms (CYP4A1, -4A2, -4A3, and -4A8) and the single characterized human isoform (CYP4A11) (2Dierks E.A.

The enzymes of the CYP4 family are distinguished by their unique ability to hydroxylate preferentially the thermodynamically disfavored terminal methyl group of medium and long chain fatty acids, prostaglandins, and other eicosanoids. Although other P450 enzymes hydroxylate fatty acids at internal positions of the hydrocarbon chain (6Amet Y. Berthou F. Goasduff T. Salaun J.-P. Le Breton L. Menaz J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Site-directed mutagenesis studies have begun to shed some light on the mechanism by which these enzymes achieve this specificity (4Hoch U. Zhang Z.P. Kroetz D.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12546-12558Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), but the detailed mechanism remains obscure.In this paper we report another unique and completely unexpected feature of the CYP4A class of enzymes. Liquid chromatography, SDS-gel electrophoresis with heme staining, and LC/ESI-MS provide unambiguous evidence that the prosthetic group is at least partially covalently bound to the protein in the CYP4A enzymes. Release of the modified heme by proteolysis indicates the presence of an additional hydroxyl group on the heme, suggesting cross-linking to the protein through an ester function involving an acidic residue. Indeed, analysis of heme peptides indicates that a glutamic acid residue on the I-helix is involved in heme binding. Analysis of CYP4A1 isolated from rat liver demonstrates that the modified heme is not an artifact of the heterologous E. coli expression system. Finally, experimental data obtained with the CYP4A3 Tyr-117 and Leu-129 active site mutants suggest that covalent cross-linking of the heme is required for catalytic activity. This is the first time that covalent cross-linking of the heme to the protein is observed in native or wild-type P450 enzymes and that evidence is found that this cross-linking is a prerequisite for catalytic activity.DISCUSSIONIn this paper we demonstrate that the prosthetic heme group of the CYP4A family of proteins is covalently cross-linked to different degrees to the protein. The evidence for this cross-linking is provided by three independent methods as follows: reverse phase LC, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with staining for the heme group, and ESI-MS. Furthermore, release of the covalently bound heme by Pronase digestion yields a mono-hydroxy derivative of iron protoporphyrin IX, and analysis of heme-bound peptides suggests that the heme is linked via a glutamic acid residue.Analysis of CYP4A1 isolated from rat liver establishes that the enzyme species with the cross-linked heme is not an artifact of the heterologous expression of the protein in E. coli. Indeed, the protein isolated from rat liver contained 80%of the heme-linked species in which the attached heme with absorbance at 400 nm coelutes with the protein absorbance peak at 280 nm. This is to be compared with 30%covalent binding of the heme to the protein in the E. coli expressed protein. Furthermore, on the basis of protein and heme quantitation, the CYP4A1 isolated from rat liver had the same specific activity as the recombinant protein. Despite covalent binding, all the wild-type and mutant CYP4A proteins examined in this study have the characteristic spectroscopic properties typical of P450 enzymes (Fig. 1). Covalent attachment of the heme therefore does not influence the UV-visible spectroscopic properties of the enzymes. The precise site on the heme to which the extra hydroxyl group has been added remains unknown but probably involves one of the four methyl groups, as the heme absorption spectrum is not altered in the protein bound species.The glutamic acid residue involved in heme binding is part of the highly conserved I-helix that also forms the substrate recognition site (SRS-4) in CYP4A enzymes. This glutamic acid, which is highly conserved in the CYP4A family, is glutamic acid 320, 315, 318, 319, and 321 in CYP4A1, -4A2, -4A3, -4A8, and -4A11, respectively. Fig.6 shows the position of the glutamic acid with respect to the I-helix and the distal side active site residues in a CYP4A11 model. Mutations in the CYP4A3 active site Tyr-117 and Leu-129 residues, which correspond, respectively, to Tyr-120 and Leu-132 in CYP4A11 (Fig. 6), have already been shown to change the heme binding and catalytic properties of the enzyme. Ongoing investigations now focus on the role of the glutamic acid residue and its neighbors in the catalytic site.We do not yet know how, and under what conditions, the heme is attached to the protein in the CYP4A proteins. There are precedents for two systems that result in covalent attachment of heme groups to protein frameworks under physiological (as opposed to pathological) conditions. One of these systems, typified by the assembly of the c-type cytochromes in which the heme is linked via its vinyl groups to cysteine residues (22Thony-Meyer L. Loferer H. Ritz D. Hennecke H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 23Basile G. Di Bello C. Taniuchi H. J. Biol.

Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4632-4639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), requires the intervention of proteins that catalyze the formation of the covalent cross-links. However, in these reactions the heme is bound to the two cysteines within a CXXCH heme-binding motif, a motif that is not present in the CYP4A enzymes (26Barker P.D. Ferguson S.J. Structure. 1999; 7: R290-R381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (141) Google Scholar). An even more serious shortcoming of this type of mechanism is that our observation of heme-protein cross-linking in bacterial cells requires that the entire machinery for this process be present in E. coli despite the fact that bacteria do not express CYP4A enzymes of their own.The second paradigm for the formation of covalently bound heme groups is provided by the mammalian peroxidases. The heme group has been shown to be cross-linked to the protein in lactoperoxidase (27Rae T.D. Goff H.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2103-2104Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28DePillis G.D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10533-10583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The heme prosthetic group in lactoperoxidase, the only one that has been fully characterized, is iron 1,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)-3,8-dimethyl-2,4-divinylporphyrin-6,7-dipropionic acid. The prosthetic group is covalently attached to the protein via ester bonds between the 1- and 5-hydroxymethylene groups and the carboxylic acid side chains of Glu-275 and Asp-125, respectively (34Rae T.D. Goff H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27968-27977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Proteolytic release of the heme from lactoperoxidase yields a heme species 32 atomic mass units heavier than heme itself, as expected from the presence of two additional hydroxy groups at the 1- and 5-methyl positions. In earlier work, we demonstrated that the heme is cross-linked to the protein in lactoperoxidase through an autocatalytic process in which the initial reaction with H2O2is used to form the mature, catalytically active, cross-linked protein (6Amet Y. Berthou F. Goasduff T. Salaun J.-P. Le Breton L. Menaz J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1168-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is likely that the heme is cross-linked to the protein in the other mammalian peroxidases by a similar mechanism. This precedent suggests that cross-linking of the heme to the protein in CYP4A proteins may occur through an autocatalytic process that utilizes the oxidizing species produced in the initial turnover of the protein to forge the covalent link. As reported here, proteolysis of the CYP4A enzymes releases a mono- rather than dihydroxy heme species, so that the autocatalytic process is only required to make one cross-link. Cross-linking of the heme via one of its methyl groups, as in lactoperoxidase (34Rae T.D. Goff H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27968-27977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), is a strong possibility in view of the observation that the hydroxyl group is added without significantly perturbing the spectrum of the heme in the bound or unbound state.A critical question is whether covalent attachment of the heme to the protein enhances, or enables, the catalytic function of the enzyme or is the initial step in an aging process that results in an inactive or more rapidly degraded protein. It is not yet possible to answer this question with certainty. The fact that CYP4A1 isolated from rat liver with 80%of the heme bound to the protein has similar activity to heterologously expressed CYP4A1, which only has 30%covalently bound heme, clearly shows that covalent binding does not impair activity. On the other hand, it is less clear whether the protein with the noncovalently bound heme is catalytically active. With the exception of CYP4A8, all the wild-type proteins are expressed with at least 25%of their heme already covalently bound to the protein. If heme cross-linking is an autocatalytic event, one would expect an increase in the extent of heme covalent binding during catalytic turnover. Thus, it is possible that all the measured catalytic activity is due to the covalently linked protein. It is also interesting that the CYP4A3 L129F, Y117A, Y117S, Y117F, and Y117L active site mutants, all of which are inactive, fail to bind covalently the heme even though their spectroscopic properties are those of normal P450 enzymes. However, these results do not establish that covalent binding enhances or is required for catalytic activity. A definitive answer to this question will only be possible after further experiments to determine the extent to which covalent binding increases during catalytic turnover and the effects of this binding on activity.The failure to covalently bind the heme may be associated with the highKS value for lauric acid in the case of the CYP4A3 Y117A and Y117S mutants and the lack of spectroscopically measurable binding constants for the fatty acid in the other mutants. The weak or undetectable spectroscopic change that is used to determine theKS value can be explained either by inability of the fatty acid to bind in the active site or, if bound, an inability to displace the distal water ligand from the iron. Displacement of the water ligand normally causes the spin state change that gives rise to the observed spectroscopic change. In the absence of displacement of the water molecule, catalysis is not possible, and the heme cannot be processed into a covalently bound form. In an earlier paper (4Hoch U. Zhang Z.P. Kroetz D.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) we reported that the CYP4A3_2 chimera, which derives its first 119 amino acids from CYP4A2 and the remainder from CYP4A3, retained a hydroxylation activity similar to that of the CYP4A2 parent, whereas the reciprocal CYP4A2_3 chimera was inactive even though its spectroscopic properties were those of a normal P450 enzyme. As found here for the active site mutations, the CYP4A2_3 chimera did not detectably bind lauric acid, failed to catalyze fatty acid hydroxylation, and as shown here, had less than 5%of its heme covalently attached to the protein. Thus, the evidence suggests that mutations that alter the ability of lauric acid to bind and initiate turnover also suppress covalent binding of the heme to the protein.It is unclear what advantage is provided by covalent binding of the heme in the CYP4A proteins, given that the heme is fully functional in the unbound state in other P450 enzymes. This is a similar question to that posed by covalent linking of the heme to the protein in the mammalian peroxidases, given again that the plant and fungal peroxidases function perfectly well without the covalently bound heme. In the mammalian peroxidases, cross-linking of the heme may be related to the ability of some of its members, notably myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase, to oxidize high potential substrates such as chloride ion. In a similar vein, cross-linking of the heme in the CYP4A enzymes may be related to their oxidation of the thermodynamically disfavored terminal methyl group, although alternative roles, such as stabilization of the heme-protein complex, are also possible.In summary, we have shown for the first time that CYP4A proteins have a modified, covalently attached heme prosthetic group and have identified Glu-318 as the specific site of attachment of the heme in CYP4A3. Our continuing investigation now focuses on the mechanism of its attachment and the resulting catalytic consequences. Heme1 is the essential prosthetic group of many important proteins, including the hemoglobins, catalases, peroxidases, and cytochromes. In cytochrome P450 enzymes, the heme sits deep inside the protein with its iron ligated to a cysteine thiolate group and the sixth iron coordination site occupied by a water molecule in the substrate-free state (1Cytochrome, P450: Structure.in: Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Mecha-nism, and Biochemistry. Plenum Publishing Corp, New York1995: 145-303Google Scholar). This coordination arrangement gives cytochrome P450 enzymes their unique spectral and catalytic properties. These enzymes are involved in many vital processes, including the biosynthesis of steroids and other lipophilic physiological effectors, the metabolism of drugs, and the degradation of xenobiotics. A unique feature of the cytochrome P450 enzymes is their ability to catalyze the hydroxylation of unactivated hydrocarbons under physiological conditions rather than the extreme conditions required for the reaction to occur under uncatalyzed conditions. Sequence homologies within the heme-binding region of the protein suggest that, despite the existence of numerous P450 forms with different substrate specificities, individual P450 enzymes share a common catalytic mechanism of oxygen activation. Work in this laboratory has focused on the P450 enzymes of family 4 (CYP4), especially the four known rat isoforms (CYP4A1, -4A2, -4A3, and -4A8) and the single characterized human isoform (CYP4A11) (2Dierks E.A.

A definitive answer to this question will only be possible after further experiments to determine the extent to which covalent binding increases during catalytic turnover and the effects of this binding on activity.The failure to covalently bind the heme may be associated with the highKS value for lauric acid in the case of the CYP4A3 Y117A and Y117S mutants and the lack of spectroscopically measurable binding constants for the fatty acid in the other mutants. The weak or undetectable spectroscopic change that is used to determine theKS value can be explained either by inability of the fatty acid to bind in the active site or, if bound, an inability to displace the distal water ligand from the iron. Displacement of the water ligand normally causes the spin state change that gives rise to the observed spectroscopic change. In the absence of displacement of the water molecule, catalysis is not possible, and the heme cannot be processed into a covalently bound form. In an earlier paper (4Hoch U. Zhang Z.P. Kroetz D.L.

Biophys. 2000; 373: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) we reported that the CYP4A3_2 chimera, which derives its first 119 amino acids from CYP4A2 and the remainder from CYP4A3, retained a hydroxylation activity similar to that of the CYP4A2 parent, whereas the reciprocal CYP4A2_3 chimera was inactive even though its spectroscopic properties were those of a normal P450 enzyme. As found here for the active site mutations, the CYP4A2_3 chimera did not detectably bind lauric acid, failed to catalyze fatty acid hydroxylation, and as shown here, had less than 5%of its heme covalently attached to the protein. Thus, the evidence suggests that mutations that alter the ability of lauric acid to bind and initiate turnover also suppress covalent binding of the heme to the protein.It is unclear what advantage is provided by covalent binding of the heme in the CYP4A proteins, given that the heme is fully functional in the unbound state in other P450 enzymes. This is a similar question to that posed by covalent linking of the heme to the protein in the mammalian peroxidases, given again that the plant and fungal peroxidases function perfectly well without the covalently bound heme. In the mammalian peroxidases, cross-linking of the heme may be related to the ability of some of its members, notably myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase, to oxidize high potential substrates such as chloride ion. In a similar vein, cross-linking of the heme in the CYP4A enzymes may be related to their oxidation of the thermodynamically disfavored terminal methyl group, although alternative roles, such as stabilization of the heme-protein complex, are also possible.In summary, we have shown for the first time that CYP4A proteins have a modified, covalently attached heme prosthetic group and have identified Glu-318 as the specific site of attachment of the heme in CYP4A3. Our continuing investigation now focuses on the mechanism of its attachment and the resulting catalytic consequences. In this paper we demonstrate that the prosthetic heme group of the CYP4A family of proteins is covalently cross-linked to different degrees to the protein. The evidence for this cross-linking is provided by three independent methods as follows: reverse phase LC, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with staining for the heme group, and ESI-MS. Furthermore, release of the covalently bound heme by Pronase digestion yields a mono-hydroxy derivative of iron protoporphyrin IX, and analysis of heme-bound peptides suggests that the heme is linked via a glutamic acid residue. Analysis of CYP4A1 isolated from rat liver establishes that the enzyme species with the cross-linked heme is not an artifact of the heterologous expression of the protein in E. coli. Indeed, the protein isolated from rat liver contained 80%of the heme-linked species in which the attached heme with absorbance at 400 nm coelutes with the protein absorbance peak at 280 nm. This is to be compared with 30%covalent binding of the heme to the protein in the E. coli expressed protein. Furthermore, on the basis of protein and heme quantitation, the CYP4A1 isolated from rat liver had the same specific activity as the recombinant protein. Despite covalent binding, all the wild-type and mutant CYP4A proteins examined in this study have the characteristic spectroscopic properties typical of P450 enzymes (Fig. 1). Covalent attachment of the heme therefore does not influence the UV-visible spectroscopic properties of the enzymes. The precise site on the heme to which the extra hydroxyl group has been added remains unknown but probably involves one of the four methyl groups, as the heme absorption spectrum is not altered in the protein bound species. The glutamic acid residue involved in heme binding is part of the highly conserved I-helix that also forms the substrate recognition site (SRS-4) in CYP4A enzymes. This glutamic acid, which is highly conserved in the CYP4A family, is glutamic acid 320, 315, 318, 319, and 321 in CYP4A1, -4A2, -4A3, -4A8, and -4A11, respectively. Fig.6 shows the position of the glutamic acid with respect to the I-helix and the distal side active site residues in a CYP4A11 model. Mutations in the CYP4A3 active site Tyr-117 and Leu-129 residues, which correspond, respectively, to Tyr-120 and Leu-132 in CYP4A11 (Fig. 6), have already been shown to change the heme binding and catalytic properties of the enzyme. Ongoing investigations now focus on the role of the glutamic acid residue and its neighbors in the catalytic site. We do not yet know how, and under what conditions, the heme is attached to the protein in the CYP4A proteins. There are precedents for two systems that result in covalent attachment of heme groups to protein frameworks under physiological (as opposed to pathological) conditions. One of these systems, typified by the assembly of the c-type cytochromes in which the heme is linked via its vinyl groups to cysteine residues (22Thony-Meyer L. Loferer H. Ritz D. Hennecke H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 23Basile G. Di Bello C. Taniuchi H. J. Biol.

Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4632-4639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), requires the intervention of proteins that catalyze the formation of the covalent cross-links. However, in these reactions the heme is bound to the two cysteines within a CXXCH heme-binding motif, a motif that is not present in the CYP4A enzymes (26Barker P.D. Ferguson S.J. Structure. 1999; 7: R290-R381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (141) Google Scholar). An even more serious shortcoming of this type of mechanism is that our observation of heme-protein cross-linking in bacterial cells requires that the entire machinery for this process be present in E. coli despite the fact that bacteria do not express CYP4A enzymes of their own. The second paradigm for the formation of covalently bound heme groups is provided by the mammalian peroxidases. The heme group has been shown to be cross-linked to the protein in lactoperoxidase (27Rae T.D. Goff H.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2103-2104Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28DePillis G.D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10533-10583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The heme prosthetic group in lactoperoxidase, the only one that has been fully characterized, is iron 1,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)-3,8-dimethyl-2,4-divinylporphyrin-6,7-dipropionic acid. The prosthetic group is covalently attached to the protein via ester bonds between the 1- and 5-hydroxymethylene groups and the carboxylic acid side chains of Glu-275 and Asp-125, respectively (34Rae T.D. Goff H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27968-27977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Proteolytic release of the heme from lactoperoxidase yields a heme species 32 atomic mass units heavier than heme itself, as expected from the presence of two additional hydroxy groups at the 1- and 5-methyl positions. In earlier work, we demonstrated that the heme is cross-linked to the protein in lactoperoxidase through an autocatalytic process in which the initial reaction with H2O2is used to form the mature, catalytically active, cross-linked protein (6Amet Y. Berthou F. Goasduff T. Salaun J.-P. Le Breton L. Menaz J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1168-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is likely that the heme is cross-linked to the protein in the other mammalian peroxidases by a similar mechanism. This precedent suggests that cross-linking of the heme to the protein in CYP4A proteins may occur through an autocatalytic process that utilizes the oxidizing species produced in the initial turnover of the protein to forge the covalent link. As reported here, proteolysis of the CYP4A enzymes releases a mono- rather than dihydroxy heme species, so that the autocatalytic process is only required to make one cross-link. Cross-linking of the heme via one of its methyl groups, as in lactoperoxidase (34Rae T.D. Goff H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27968-27977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), is a strong possibility in view of the observation that the hydroxyl group is added without significantly perturbing the spectrum of the heme in the bound or unbound state. A critical question is whether covalent attachment of the heme to the protein enhances, or enables, the catalytic function of the enzyme or is the initial step in an aging process that results in an inactive or more rapidly degraded protein. It is not yet possible to answer this question with certainty. The fact that CYP4A1 isolated from rat liver with 80%of the heme bound to the protein has similar activity to heterologously expressed CYP4A1, which only has 30%covalently bound heme, clearly shows that covalent binding does not impair activity. On the other hand, it is less clear whether the protein with the noncovalently bound heme is catalytically active. With the exception of CYP4A8, all the wild-type proteins are expressed with at least 25%of their heme already covalently bound to the protein. If heme cross-linking is an autocatalytic event, one would expect an increase in the extent of heme covalent binding during catalytic turnover. Thus, it is possible that all the measured catalytic activity is due to the covalently linked protein. It is also interesting that the CYP4A3 L129F, Y117A, Y117S, Y117F, and Y117L active site mutants, all of which are inactive, fail to bind covalently the heme even though their spectroscopic properties are those of normal P450 enzymes. However, these results do not establish that covalent binding enhances or is required for catalytic activity. A definitive answer to this question will only be possible after further experiments to determine the extent to which covalent binding increases during catalytic turnover and the effects of this binding on activity. The failure to covalently bind the heme may be associated with the highKS value for lauric acid in the case of the CYP4A3 Y117A and Y117S mutants and the lack of spectroscopically measurable binding constants for the fatty acid in the other mutants. The weak or undetectable spectroscopic change that is used to determine theKS value can be explained either by inability of the fatty acid to bind in the active site or, if bound, an inability to displace the distal water ligand from the iron. Displacement of the water ligand normally causes the spin state change that gives rise to the observed spectroscopic change. In the absence of displacement of the water molecule, catalysis is not possible, and the heme cannot be processed into a covalently bound form. In an earlier paper (4Hoch U. Zhang Z.P. Kroetz D.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) we reported that the CYP4A3_2 chimera, which derives its first 119 amino acids from CYP4A2 and the remainder from CYP4A3, retained a hydroxylation activity similar to that of the CYP4A2 parent, whereas the reciprocal CYP4A2_3 chimera was inactive even though its spectroscopic properties were those of a normal P450 enzyme.

Plants homozygous for intragenic null suppressor alleles ofabi1-1 exhibit higher seed dormancy and enhanced ABA sensitivity to germination inhibition and stomatal movements, suggesting that ABI1 and probably ABI2 act as negative regulators of ABA signaling (47Gosti F.

Overexpression ofabi1-1 antagonizes both up- and down-regulation of ABA-responsive promoters (46Sheen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 975-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar).

The molecular mechanisms and targets ofABI1 and lanthanum action are not known. Phospholipase C (PLC) and phospholipase D (PLD) are phosphodiesterases that hydrolyze phospholipids, producing inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol or phosphatidic acid and the head group, respectively. Phospholipases have been proposed to play a major role in mediating a wide range of cellular processes in plants such as membrane trafficking, cell proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, defense responses, differentiation, reproduction, and hormone action (49Munnik T. Irvine R.F. Musgrave A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1389: 222-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 50Wang X. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). PLC and PLD have been implicated in ABA regulation of stomatal movements (51Staxén I. Pical C. Montgomery L.T. Gray J.E. Hetherington A.M. McAinsh M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

They have also recently shown in vitrothat ABA stimulates PLD activity in plasma membrane extracts (54Richie S. Gilroy S. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). PLC and PLD genes are up-regulated by ABA (55Hirayama T. Ohto C. Mizoguchi T. Shinozaki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3903-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 56Xu L.

U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2697-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, the specificity of PLD action in secondary messenger formation and ABA-regulated gene expression is far from understood. We are interested in the cell biology of ABA signal transduction, from events at the cell surface such as ligand binding (60Desikan R. Hagenbeek D. Neill S.J. Rock C.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) through secondary messengers such as calcium, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and cyclic ADP-ribose (61Wu Y. Kuzma J. Maréchal E. Graeff R. Lee H.C. Foster R. Chua N.H. Science. 1997; 278: 2126-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) to changes in gene expression. The activities of overexpressed ABA signaling effectors are easily and rapidly assayed in rice protoplasts. This capacity allows facile analysis of pharmacological agents for interaction with ABA signaling components as well as characterization of the molecular mechanisms of such interactions. In this study, we have obtained pharmacological evidence that PLD functions in ABA-inducible reporter gene expression in rice and acts downstream of the ABA effector lanthanum. VP1 transactivation of ABA-inducible promoters is inhibited by 1-butanol, and the extent of 1-butanol inhibition is comparable to that effected by coexpression of the dominant-negative ABI1-1 protein. These results are consistent with genetic studies showing an ABA requirement for VP1 action and suggest that PLD and ABI1-1 act upstream of VP1 on a single ABA signaling pathway. Embryonic rice suspension cultures (Oryza sativa L. cv. IR-54) were kindly provided by Dr. W. M. Marcotte, Jr. (Clemson University, Clemson, SC) and propagated in MS basal medium (62Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (52758) Google Scholar). Three days after subculturing, protoplasts were prepared and transformed with various mixtures of DNA constructs using polyethylene glycol precipitation as previously described (48Hagenbeek D. Quatrano R.S. Rock C.D. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1553-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 60Desikan R. Hagenbeek D. Neill S.J. Rock C.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Aliquots of transformed protoplast samples were treated with or without pharmacological agents and ABA for 18 h in the dark in a final volume of 0.8 ml of Krens solution (7Marcotte Jr., W.R. Bayley C.C. Quatrano R.S. Nature. 1988; 335: 454-457Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar).

Bayley C.C. Quatrano R.S. Nature. 1988; 335: 454-457Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Plasmids pQS264, pLSP, and pDHN7 contain the barley (Hordeum vulgare) Hva1,Hva22, and dehydrin (Dhn7) promoters driving GUS expression, respectively (8Robertson M. Cuming A.C. Chandler P.M. Physiol.

Plasmids pBM314 and pAHC27 contain the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter (referred to below as35S) and the maize (Zea mays) Ubi(ubiquitin) promoter driving GUS expression, respectively (7Marcotte Jr., W.R. Bayley C.C. Quatrano R.S. Nature. 1988; 335: 454-457Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 63Christensen A.H. Quail P.H. Transgenic Res. 1996; 5: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Plasmid pCR559 contains the Em promoter driving a modified S65T green fluorescent protein cDNA from Aequoria victoria (60Desikan R. Hagenbeek D. Neill S.J. Rock C.D.

Biol. 1996; 6: 325-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). A construct (pDH559) containing the maize Ubi promoter driving S65T GFP was created by digesting pCR559 with XhoI and filling in the linearized product with reverse transcriptase before digesting with SphI to release the Em promoter. The resulting 3.7-kilobase pair fragment (pCR559 minus the Em promoter) was then gel-purified and ligated with the 2-kilobase pair SphI/SmaI fragment of pAHC27, encoding the maize Ubi promoter (63Christensen A.H. Quail P.H. Transgenic Res. 1996; 5: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Plasmid pCR349.13S contains the 35 S promoter driving VP1 sense cDNA (18Hill A. Nantel A. Rock C.D. Quatrano R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3366-3374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Plasmid pG2 encodes the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter-maize C4 pyruvate-orthophosphate dikinase (Ppdk35S) promoter chimera driving the coding region of the Arabidopsis thaliana abi1-1 dominant-negative G180D mutant allele (46Sheen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 975-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Plasmid pDirect2.6 contains the Ubi promoter in a reversed orientation and was used as control construct to balance the total amount of input plasmid DNA between various treatments. Plasmid pAHC18 contains the Ubi promoter driving firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase (63Christensen A.H. Quail P.H. Transgenic Res. 1996; 5: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) and was included in transformations to provide an internal reference for non-ABA-inducible transient transcription in reporter enzyme assays. 1-Butanol was obtained from Acros Organics (Geel,Belgium). 2-Butanol was from Nacalai Tesque, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). Synthetic abscisic acid ((±)-cis,trans-abscisic acid) and lanthanum chloride were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, Missouri). ABA was dissolved and stored in absolute ethanol at −20 °C as a 0.1 m stock solution. Prior to use, required dilutions of ABA were made in Krens solution, and control samples received the same volumes of solvents as in ABA treatments. Flow cytometry of live protoplasts expressing GFP was performed on a Becton-Dickinson FACS Vantage dual-beam instrument equipped with a 200-μm nozzle, Lysis II acquisition and analysis software, and an Enterprise argon-ion laser (1.3 watts) tuned to 488 nm. The sheath fluid used was Krens (7Marcotte Jr., W.R. Bayley C.C. Quatrano R.S. Nature. 1988; 335: 454-457Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). GFP emission detection was carried out with a fluorescein isothiocyanate 530/30-nm band-pass filter. For each sample, 10,000 protoplasts were gated, and the weighted GFP fluorescence per 10,000 cells was calculated as the product of the average fluorescence intensity of the population and the number of individual cells (48Hagenbeek D. Quatrano R.S. Rock C.D. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1553-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) expressing above a background threshold. After 16 h of incubation, cell viability was determined by flow cytometry of an aliquot of protoplasts treated for 5 min with 0.01% (w/v) fluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). For reporter enzyme assays, protoplasts were lysed in 250 μl of lysis buffer and spun at maximum speed for 3 min in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was retained. Luciferase substrate (Promega, Madison, WI) was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 μl of sample extract was mixed with 50 μl of substrate, and the luciferase activity was measured on a Zylux FB15 luminometer (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). GUS activities were determined by fluorometry with 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide as substrate according to Desikan et al. (60Desikan R. Hagenbeek D. Neill S.J. Rock C.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The relative reporter gene activity was represented as the ratio of GUS to luciferase activities, expressed in units of 4-methylumbelliferyl fluorescence/40 μl of extract/h and photons/10 μl of extract/min, respectively. To characterize the maximum and specific effects of pharmacological agents on ABA-inducible expression, it was considered important to perform interaction experiments with concentrations of exogenous ABA that are physiologically relevant. Therefore, an ABA dose response of Em-GUS expression was performed. The results are shown in Fig. 1 A. There was a log-linear relationship of ABA concentration to Em promoter expression up to 100 μm, with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.92. There was a significant increase (p < 0.0005) in Em-GUS transcription in response to 1 μm ABA treatment. The maximum induction ofEm-GUS (28-fold) was observed with 100 μm ABA treatment. The slight decrease in relative Em-GUS induction observed with a saturating ABA concentration (200 μm) may have been caused by a negative effect of high ABA concentrations on protoplast viability (60Desikan R. Hagenbeek D. Neill S.J. Rock C.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). PLD is competitively inhibited by 1-butanol due to its ability to transfer the phosphatidyl moiety of the substrate to 1-butanol instead of water, producing phosphatidylbutanol that can be used as a quantitative assay of PLD activity (57Munnik T. Arisz S.A. de Vrije T. Musgrave A. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 2197-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Thetrans-phosphatidylation reaction is unique to PLD, making 1-butanol a suitable pharmacological agent to study PLD-regulated processes (57Munnik T. Arisz S.A. de Vrije T. Musgrave A. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 2197-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 58Yang S.F. Freer S. Benson A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 477-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 59Cross M.J. Roberts S. Ridley A.J. Hodgkin M.N. Stewart A. Welsh L.C. Wakelam M.J.O. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 588-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the role of PLD in ABA signaling in rice embryonic tissue, we measured the effect of various concentrations of 1-butanol on ABA-inducible gene expression in protoplasts at a subsaturating concentration of ABA (1 μm). The results are shown in Fig. 1 B. 1-Butanol antagonized ABA-inducibleEm-GUS expression in a dose-dependent manner. Significant inhibition of ABA-induced Em-GUS expression was seen with 0.01% (v/v) 1-butanol (p < 0.01). The maximum inhibition of Em-GUS expression (85%) was observed with 0.2% 1-butanol treatment. There was a good linear correlation (r = 0.88) between inhibition of Em-GUS expression and 1-butanol concentration. The 1-butanol effect was specific for ABA-inducible Em promoter activity because the non-ABA-inducible promoter constructs Ubi-GUS (data not shown) and 35S-GUS (Fig. 1 B; p > 0.34) were not significantly affected. Since pharmacological agents used at high concentrations have negative effects on cell viability, it was important to rule out the trivial possibility that 1-butanol affected transcription by a general decrease in cell activity. The results of an experiment to correlate protoplast viability with 1-butanol doses are shown in TableI. Treatment of protoplasts with 0.5% 1-butanol decreased cell viability 26% in untreated control cells, whereas 0.01% 1-butanol, a concentration that antagonizedEm-GUS expression significantly (Fig. 1 B), decreased cell viability only 6% (p > 0.2). These results indicate that 1-butanol inhibition of ABA-inducible gene expression is not due to its effect on cell viability.Table I1-Butanol does not significantly affect protoplast viability1-Butanol treatmentViabilityDecrease (from control)%%Control (0%)690.01%65 1-aNo significant difference between control and treatment (p ≥ 0.2, two-sided Student's t-test, equal variance assumed).60.05%58160.1%59140.2%54220.5%5126Rice protoplasts were treated for 18 h with various concentrations of 1-butanol and then stained with 0.01% fluorescein diacetate for 5 min and measured in triplicates by flow cytometry.

The percentage of viable protoplasts was calculated from the number of cells (out of 10,000 gated) above the fluorescence threshold set for dead, EtOH-fixed cells. To provide insight into the interaction of ABA and PLD signaling, the effect of 1-butanol on the dose dependence of ABA-inducible gene expression was tested. The results are shown in Fig. 1 C. In response to increasing concentrations of ABA, the inhibition ofEm-GUS caused by 0.1% 1-butanol steadily decreased from above 50% at subsaturating ABA concentrations to 29% at a saturating concentration of ABA (100 μm) (Fig. 1 C). The linear correlation coefficient for 1-butanol inhibition ofEm-GUS expression and ABA concentration wasr = −0.92. We extended our experiments to include the ABA-inducible promotersHva1 and Hva22 (9Shen Q. Ho T.H. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 101: 653-664Crossref Google Scholar). Fig. 1 D shows the results of 1-butanol (0.1%) inhibition experiments on promoters induced by ABA. 1-Butanol significantly antagonized expression of the ABA-inducible Em-GUS, Hva1-GUS, andHva22-GUS reporter constructs (p < 0.04), albeit to different extents (Fig. 1 D). We sought further evidence for the specificity of 1-butanol effects on PLD activity by testing a non-active isomer of butanol, 2-butanol (52Jacob T. Ritchie S. Assmann S.M. Gilroy S. Proc. Natl.

We report here the isolation, purification, and characterization of a catalytically active cytosolic 10 S multienzyme complex for triacylglycerol biosynthesis from <i>Rhodotorula glutinis</i> during exponential growth. The complex was characterized and was found to contain lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, phosphatidic acid phosphatase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, acyl-acyl carrier protein synthetase, and acyl carrier protein. The 10 S triacylglycerol biosynthetic complex rapidly incorporates free fatty acids as well as fatty acyl-coenzyme A into triacylglycerol and its biosynthetic intermediates. Lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, phosphatidic acid phosphatase, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase from the complex were microsequenced. Antibodies were raised against the synthetic peptides corresponding to lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase and phosphatidic acid phosphatase sequences. Immunoprecipitation and immunolocalization studies show the presence of a cytosolic multienzyme complex for triacylglycerol biosynthesis. Chemical cross-linking studies revealed that the 10 S multienzyme complex was held together by protein-protein interactions. These results demonstrate that the cytosol is one of the sites for triacylglycerol biosynthesis in oleaginous yeast."

We investigated the effect of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) inactivation on spatiotemporal Ca2+ signals in intact sea urchin eggs. The photorelease of NAADP but not inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate or cyclic ADP-ribose resulted in self-inactivation. When NAADP was released first locally and subsequently globally, the spatial pattern of the first response shaped that of the second. Specifically, the local release of NAADP created a Ca2+ gradient that was reversed during the subsequent global release of NAADP. Neither cyclic ADP-ribose nor inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate showed a similar effect. In contrast to homogenates, NAADP inactivation was reversible in intact eggs with resensitization occurring in ∼20 min.

Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, intracellular targets can be selectively activated by Ca2+ through spatial and temporal control (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar). One way of controlling spatiotemporal Ca2+ signaling is by modulating the sensitivity of intracellular Ca2+-release channels to Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR).1 Through positive feedback, CICR results in regenerative Ca2+ release. Both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and ryanodine receptors exhibit CICR, the sensitivity of which is controlled by IP3(1Berridge M.J.

For example, we recently reported that, in contrast to all previous Ca2+ waves that propagate by CICR (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar), NAADP-mediated Ca2+ increases propagate by NAADP diffusion (15Churchill G.C. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38687-38692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We now show that NAADP desensitization-resensitization can establish a subcellular Ca2+ memory that has both spatial and temporal components. Thus, the unique properties of NAADP enables it to control spatiotemporal Ca2+ signaling in a fundamentally distinct manner from IP3 and cADPR.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSea urchin eggs of Lytechinus pictus were obtained by intracoelomic injection of 0.5 m KCl shed into artificial sea water (in mm, NaCl 435, MgCl2 40, MgSO4 15, CaCl2 11, KCl 10, NaHCO32.5, EDTA 1), dejellied by passing through 90-μm nylon mesh, and then washed twice by centrifugation. Eggs were transferred to polylysine-coated glass coverslips for microinjection and microscopy. Oregon Green 488 BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid dextran; Molecular Probes) was pressure-microinjected (Picospritzer; World Precision Instruments). The Ca2+-sensitive dye was imaged by laser-scanning confocal microscopy (Leica model TCS NT) using the 488-nm line of an argon ion laser for excitation, and the emission was long pass-filtered (515 nm) and detected with a photomultiplier tube. Caged NAADP (2′P-(1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl) NAADP; Molecular Probes) was purified further by high performance liquid chromatography to remove small amounts of contaminating free NAADP (16Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Gee K.R. Kestner T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4172-4178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Caged cADPR (P-(1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl) cADPR; Molecular Probes) and caged IP3 (4,5P-(1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl) IP3; Calbiochem) were not further purified. Caged compounds were photolyzed with ultraviolet light (351- and 364-nm lines) from an argon ion laser (Enterprise model 651; Coherent) that was directed into the scanning head by a quartz fiber optic cable. The spatial location of photolysis was controlled via a shutter that was placed in the light path of the ultraviolet laser. This resulted in a band of UV across the image with the position and width of the band being controllable. The confocal images were processed with the software NIH Image to create a self ratio by dividing the intensity (F) of each image on a pixel by pixel basis by the intensity of an image acquired before stimulation (Fo).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn sea urchin egg homogenates, Ca2+ release mediated by IP3, cADPR, and NAADP exhibit homologous desensitization, but only the NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ release system inactivates to nonreleasing concentrations of itself (2Lee H.C.

To investigate the time course for messenger desensitization in intact eggs, each second messenger was photoreleased repeatedly at different time intervals (Fig.1). In response to repeated stimulation with either IP3 or cADPR, the peak Ca2+decreased, and the resting Ca2+ between pulses increased when the pulses were separated by 20 s but were largely unaffected when the pulses were separated by either 60- or 120-s intervals (Fig.1). In contrast, in response to repeated stimulation with NAADP the peak Ca2+ decreased regardless of the time between the NAADP pulses (Fig. 1). The precise time course for NAADP inactivation in intact eggs cannot be determined accurately because of egg to egg variation and the fact that a given egg cannot be repeatedly stimulated with NAADP using different time courses.A local release of NAADP resulted in a Ca2+ increase that spread only part way across an egg, thus forming a Ca2+gradient (Fig. 2). We have demonstrated recently that NAADP-mediated Ca2+ increases spread via NAADP diffusion (15Churchill G.C. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38687-38692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), rather than via Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, which underlies all previously described Ca2+ waves (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar). When Ca2+ returned to near resting levels, a global release of NAADP resulted in a Ca2+ increase that was an inversion of the first Ca2+ gradient (Fig. 2). This second Ca2+gradient is a direct consequence of the first NAADP gradient that formed subcellular zones where the NAADP response was completely inhibited, partially inhibited, and not inhibited.Figure 2NAADP inactivation forms a spatial Ca2+ memory. NAADP was photoreleased first locally and then, after Ca2+ had returned to near resting levels, globally. In the images the pseudocolor correspond to the Oregon Green 488 BAPTA dextran self ratio (F/Fo), and the images are taken from the times indicated by the vertical tick marks above thex axis of the graphs. The traces in the graph are coded by color to the regions of interest at the positions indicated in the diagram of the egg. The shading in the diagram of the egg indicates the area of photorelease, and the labeled horizontal bars above the traces and images indicate its duration. The response is representative of that observed in eight similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In contrast to NAADP, a local release of either cADPR (Fig.3 a) or IP3 (Fig.3 b) did not affect the pattern of Ca2+ increase elicited by a later global release of messenger. These experiments illustrate a key difference between Ca2+ signals generated by IP3 and cADPR and those generated by NAADP. Namely, that NAADP responses exhibit a spatial memory of the previous response that shapes the spatial pattern of subsequent Ca2+increases.Figure 3A spatial Ca2+ memory is not formed by IP3 or cADPR. Compounds were photoreleased first locally and then, after Ca2+ had returned to near resting levels, globally.

Similarly, in intact sea urchin eggs, when either a relatively large amount of NAADP was released (e.g. photoreleasing NAADP globally at a high UV intensity for several frames) or free NAADP was injected to a final intracellular concentration of 5 nm, the inactivation persisted for at least 2 h (data not shown). To determine the reversibility of spatially localized NAADP inactivation, eggs were locally desensitized to NAADP and then given various periods of recovery before a global release of NAADP. As shown in Fig. 2, when the local and global NAADP increases were separated by about 1 min, there was localized inactivation (Fig. 4). As the recovery time between the two photoreleases of NAADP increased, the egg progressively recovered from inactivation until after about 23 min the NAADP-mediated Ca2+ increase was similar in both the regions (Fig. 4). To verify that the local region was desensitizing to NAADP, NAADP was released locally with a series of UV pulses. The amplitude of the response decreased with each additional UV pulse indicting desensitization. The subsequent response to global photorelease of NAADP (Fig. 4; 25 min) demonstrates that the recovery was genuine and not due to the lack of initial desensitization. Following the NAADP-mediated Ca2+increase, certain eggs exhibited either a Ca2+ pulse (Fig.4; 23 min, blue trace) or a small and sustained rise in Ca2+ (Fig. 4; 23 and 25 min). These secondary Ca2+ rises likely correspond to the Ca2+ oscillations induced by the photorelease of NAADP, as described previously by Aarhus et al. (9Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R.M. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).Figure 4Localized NAADP inactivation in intact eggs is reversible. NAADP was photoreleased first locally then globally as shown in the schematic diagram. Thetraces are labeled with the time between the local and global pulses of UV. The traces are examples of the responses observed in three to six similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although the mechanism for recovery of the NAADP response is currently unknown, the functional response (inhibition of NAADP-induced Ca2+ release) is relatively long-lasting in homogenates (9Aarhus R.

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11599-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) compared with intact eggs, suggesting that the sensitivity of the egg to NAADP is highly regulated in vivo. Taken together, the experiments shown in Fig. 4 demonstrate that NAADP inactivation is reversible when it is localized in intact eggs. Thus, the NAADP-mediated spatiotemporal Ca2+ memory is short term rather than permanent.Our data demonstrate that in intact sea urchin eggs, NAADP inactivation can be spatially restricted and is reversible. These unique properties enable NAADP to form a spatiotemporal memory of past Ca2+increases. Such a subcellular memory makes it ideal for controlling processes that require elevations in Ca2+ that are spatially restricted and maintain an influence for 10–20 min. Numerous extracellular messengers control a diverse array of intracellular functions through increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, intracellular targets can be selectively activated by Ca2+ through spatial and temporal control (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar). One way of controlling spatiotemporal Ca2+ signaling is by modulating the sensitivity of intracellular Ca2+-release channels to Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR).1 Through positive feedback, CICR results in regenerative Ca2+ release. Both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and ryanodine receptors exhibit CICR, the sensitivity of which is controlled by IP3(1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar) and cADPR (2Lee H.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), respectively. Thus, by altering the levels of these messengers, Ca2+ signals can be confined to subcellular regions or propagated throughout the cell (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar). The novel Ca2+-mobilizing messenger nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) was originally shown to mobilize Ca2+ in the sea urchin egg (3Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) and subsequently has been shown to be active in both mammalian (4Berg I. Potter B.V. Mayr G.W. Guse A.H.

Compared with IP3 and cADPR, NAADP has several unique characteristics in the sea urchin egg (2Lee H.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 8Galione A. Patel S. Churchill G.C. Biol. Cell. 2000; 92: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). First, the response to a maximal NAADP concentration is eliminated by pretreatment with a subthreshold concentration of NAADP (9Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R.M. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and increase the sensitivity of its receptor (12Patel S. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Third, NAADP-mediated Ca2+ release is not regulated by Ca2+ (6Bak J. White P. Timar G. Missiaen L. Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 751-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 13Chini E.N. Dousa T.P. Biochem.

The unique properties of NAADP necessitate novel mechanisms for control of spatiotemporal Ca2+ signaling. For example, we recently reported that, in contrast to all previous Ca2+ waves that propagate by CICR (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar), NAADP-mediated Ca2+ increases propagate by NAADP diffusion (15Churchill G.C. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38687-38692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We now show that NAADP desensitization-resensitization can establish a subcellular Ca2+ memory that has both spatial and temporal components. Thus, the unique properties of NAADP enables it to control spatiotemporal Ca2+ signaling in a fundamentally distinct manner from IP3 and cADPR.

To investigate the time course for messenger desensitization in intact eggs, each second messenger was photoreleased repeatedly at different time intervals (Fig.1). In response to repeated stimulation with either IP3 or cADPR, the peak Ca2+decreased, and the resting Ca2+ between pulses increased when the pulses were separated by 20 s but were largely unaffected when the pulses were separated by either 60- or 120-s intervals (Fig.1). In contrast, in response to repeated stimulation with NAADP the peak Ca2+ decreased regardless of the time between the NAADP pulses (Fig. 1). The precise time course for NAADP inactivation in intact eggs cannot be determined accurately because of egg to egg variation and the fact that a given egg cannot be repeatedly stimulated with NAADP using different time courses.A local release of NAADP resulted in a Ca2+ increase that spread only part way across an egg, thus forming a Ca2+gradient (Fig. 2). We have demonstrated recently that NAADP-mediated Ca2+ increases spread via NAADP diffusion (15Churchill G.C. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38687-38692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), rather than via Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, which underlies all previously described Ca2+ waves (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar). When Ca2+ returned to near resting levels, a global release of NAADP resulted in a Ca2+ increase that was an inversion of the first Ca2+ gradient (Fig. 2). This second Ca2+gradient is a direct consequence of the first NAADP gradient that formed subcellular zones where the NAADP response was completely inhibited, partially inhibited, and not inhibited.In contrast to NAADP, a local release of either cADPR (Fig.3 a) or IP3 (Fig.3 b) did not affect the pattern of Ca2+ increase elicited by a later global release of messenger.

Namely, that NAADP responses exhibit a spatial memory of the previous response that shapes the spatial pattern of subsequent Ca2+increases.Figure 3A spatial Ca2+ memory is not formed by IP3 or cADPR.

Similarly, in intact sea urchin eggs, when either a relatively large amount of NAADP was released (e.g. photoreleasing NAADP globally at a high UV intensity for several frames) or free NAADP was injected to a final intracellular concentration of 5 nm, the inactivation persisted for at least 2 h (data not shown). To determine the reversibility of spatially localized NAADP inactivation, eggs were locally desensitized to NAADP and then given various periods of recovery before a global release of NAADP. As shown in Fig. 2, when the local and global NAADP increases were separated by about 1 min, there was localized inactivation (Fig. 4). As the recovery time between the two photoreleases of NAADP increased, the egg progressively recovered from inactivation until after about 23 min the NAADP-mediated Ca2+ increase was similar in both the regions (Fig. 4). To verify that the local region was desensitizing to NAADP, NAADP was released locally with a series of UV pulses. The amplitude of the response decreased with each additional UV pulse indicting desensitization. The subsequent response to global photorelease of NAADP (Fig. 4; 25 min) demonstrates that the recovery was genuine and not due to the lack of initial desensitization. Following the NAADP-mediated Ca2+increase, certain eggs exhibited either a Ca2+ pulse (Fig.4; 23 min, blue trace) or a small and sustained rise in Ca2+ (Fig. 4; 23 and 25 min). These secondary Ca2+ rises likely correspond to the Ca2+ oscillations induced by the photorelease of NAADP, as described previously by Aarhus et al. (9Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R.M. Gee K.R.

Taken together, the experiments shown in Fig. 4 demonstrate that NAADP inactivation is reversible when it is localized in intact eggs. Thus, the NAADP-mediated spatiotemporal Ca2+ memory is short term rather than permanent.Our data demonstrate that in intact sea urchin eggs, NAADP inactivation can be spatially restricted and is reversible. These unique properties enable NAADP to form a spatiotemporal memory of past Ca2+increases. Such a subcellular memory makes it ideal for controlling processes that require elevations in Ca2+ that are spatially restricted and maintain an influence for 10–20 min. In sea urchin egg homogenates, Ca2+ release mediated by IP3, cADPR, and NAADP exhibit homologous desensitization, but only the NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ release system inactivates to nonreleasing concentrations of itself (2Lee H.C.

The time course of NAADP self-inactivation is both time- and concentration-dependent (2Lee H.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 9Aarhus R. Dickey D.M.

Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 9Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R.M. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11599-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To investigate the time course for messenger desensitization in intact eggs, each second messenger was photoreleased repeatedly at different time intervals (Fig.1). In response to repeated stimulation with either IP3 or cADPR, the peak Ca2+decreased, and the resting Ca2+ between pulses increased when the pulses were separated by 20 s but were largely unaffected when the pulses were separated by either 60- or 120-s intervals (Fig.1). In contrast, in response to repeated stimulation with NAADP the peak Ca2+ decreased regardless of the time between the NAADP pulses (Fig. 1). The precise time course for NAADP inactivation in intact eggs cannot be determined accurately because of egg to egg variation and the fact that a given egg cannot be repeatedly stimulated with NAADP using different time courses. A local release of NAADP resulted in a Ca2+ increase that spread only part way across an egg, thus forming a Ca2+gradient (Fig. 2). We have demonstrated recently that NAADP-mediated Ca2+ increases spread via NAADP diffusion (15Churchill G.C. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38687-38692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), rather than via Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, which underlies all previously described Ca2+ waves (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar). When Ca2+ returned to near resting levels, a global release of NAADP resulted in a Ca2+ increase that was an inversion of the first Ca2+ gradient (Fig. 2). This second Ca2+gradient is a direct consequence of the first NAADP gradient that formed subcellular zones where the NAADP response was completely inhibited, partially inhibited, and not inhibited. In contrast to NAADP, a local release of either cADPR (Fig.3 a) or IP3 (Fig.3 b) did not affect the pattern of Ca2+ increase elicited by a later global release of messenger. These experiments illustrate a key difference between Ca2+ signals generated by IP3 and cADPR and those generated by NAADP. Namely, that NAADP responses exhibit a spatial memory of the previous response that shapes the spatial pattern of subsequent Ca2+increases. In sea urchin egg homogenates, NAADP inactivation lasts at least 25 min (9Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R.M. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol.

Cells were transfected with chimeric gene constructs in which the β-globin coding region was used as a reporter and linked to either its own 3′-untranslated region, the c-fos 3′-untranslated region, or the c-fos 3′-untranslated region containing different deletions. Replacement of the endogenous β-globin 3′-untranslated region by that from c-fos caused a redistribution of the transcripts so that they were recovered in cytoskeletal-bound polysomes and seen localized in the perinuclear cytoplasm. Deletion of the AU-rich instability region did not affect transcript localization, but removal of a distinct 145-nucleotide region of the 3′-untranslated region abolished it. The prevention of transcript translation by desferrioxamine led to a marked loss of transcript localization, independent of mRNA instability. The data show that the 3′-untranslated region of c-fos mRNA, as c-myc, contains a localization signal, which targets the mRNA to the perinuclear cytoskeleton.

There is increasing evidence that many eukaryotic mRNAs have 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs)1 that contain important control sequences. These regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level through control of mRNA stability, regulation of translation efficiency, and altering the coding capacity of mRNAs. More recently, sequence elements within 3′-UTRs have been discovered that are able to localize mRNAs to particular regions of the cytoplasm (1St. Johnston D. Cell. 1995; 81: 161-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 2Hesketh J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 219-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 3Bassell G. Singer R.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In the early development of Drosophila and Xenopus, this mRNA localization is important for establishing morphological gradients, apparently leading to local protein synthesis (4Gavis E.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 485-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). mRNA localization also occurs in somatic mammalian cells such as fibroblasts where 3′-UTR sequences and the cytoskeleton have been shown to be involved in targeting mRNAs to the cell periphery and to the perinuclear cytoplasm (5Hesketh J. Campbell G. Piechaczyk M. Blanchard J.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 6Kislauskis E.H. Zhu X.C. Singer R.H. J.

Campbell G.P. Wiseman J. Blanchard J.M. Hesketh J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1185-1194PubMed Google Scholar).The c-myc mRNA has been shown to contain a localization signal within the 3′-UTR (5Hesketh J. Campbell G. Piechaczyk M. Blanchard J.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 8Veyrune J.L. Campbell G.P. Wiseman J. Blanchard J.M. Hesketh J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1185-1194PubMed Google Scholar); this directs a reporter transcript to the perinuclear cytoplasm and to polysomes bound to the cytoskeleton (5Hesketh J. Campbell G. Piechaczyk M. Blanchard J.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The perinuclear localization of c-myc mRNA and its association with the cytoskeleton has been suggested to provide local synthesis of the protein that promotes efficient import of the newly synthesized protein into the nucleus. This could be important in the case of unstable transcription factors; however, it is not clear if mRNAs coding for other transcription factors are also localized by a similar mechanism.It is well established that the c-fos proto-oncogene encodes a transcription factor that is a very unstable protein, exhibiting rapid nuclear turnover (9Muller R. Bravo R. Burckhardt J. Curran T. Nature. 1984; 312: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar) and a biphasic half-life. The equally unstable messenger RNA has been studied in some detail (10Bonnieu A. Rech J. Jeanteur P. Fort P. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 881-888PubMed Google Scholar, 11Shyu A.B. Greenberg M.E. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 60-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) and is subject to both transcriptional and post-transcriptional control. Much evidence indicates that both the coding region and the 3′-UTR contain the information required for RNA destabilization. The c-fos3′-UTR is capable of destabilizing β-globin mRNA and furthermore, AU-rich regions (ARE) within the 3′-UTR have been identified as important in instability (11Shyu A.B. Greenberg M.E. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 60-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 12Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3107) Google Scholar, 13Wilson T.

In particular, the conserved motif AUUUA has been found in a variety of unstable mRNAs coding for proto-oncogenic transcription factors and cytokines (15Caput D. Beutler B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brownshimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1670-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic lifespan of c-fos mRNA is dramatically increased by the addition of protein synthesis inhibitors, the so called “superinduction phenomenon” (9Muller R. Bravo R. Burckhardt J. Curran T. Nature. 1984; 312: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 10Bonnieu A. Rech J. Jeanteur P. Fort P. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 881-888PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wilson T. Treisman R.

Using chimeric β-globin-fos 3′-UTR gene constructs in fibroblast cell lines, reporter stability was found to increase severalfold when the translation of the reporter was decreased (17Veyrune J.L. Carillo S. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2127-2134PubMed Google Scholar, 18Winstall E. Gamache M. Raymond V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3796-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This indicated some link between translation and ARE-dependent mRNA degradation of the c-fos mRNA; however, the mechanisms require further clarification.c-fos mRNA has been shown to be enriched in cytoskeletal-bound polysomes released from the cell matrix following addition of cytochalasin D (19Bird R.C. Sells B.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 868: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Zambetti G. Wilming L. Fey E.G. Penman S. Stein J. Stein G. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 191: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), implying that c-fosmRNA is translated on cytoskeletal-bound polysomes and is associated with the cytoskeleton. However, it is not known if the c-fos mRNA is localized or if this association with the cytoskeleton involves a signal within the 3′-UTR.The aims of the present study were 3-fold: first, to determine whether the 3′-UTR of c-fos proto-oncogene contains a localization signal capable of directing a reporter construct to a distinct subcellular compartment or to the cytoskeleton; second, to study whether this localization is linked to mRNA translation/stability; and last, to determine whether the elements that regulate these aspects of mRNA fate are distinct. Cell fractionation and in situ hybridization analyses indicate that a specific 145-nt region of the c-fos 3′-UTR, distinct from the instability element, is sufficient to localize a reporter transcript. Furthermore, initiation of translation of the transcript is required for the mRNA to be localized.DISCUSSIONEndogenous c-fos mRNA has been shown to be associated with the cytoskeleton (19Bird R.C. Sells B.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 868: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Zambetti G. Wilming L. Fey E.G. Penman S. Stein J. Stein G. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 191: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The present results confirm this observation using a complementary method involving separation of cytoskeletal-bound polysomes by salt treatment of the cell matrix (23Hesketh J.E. Campbell G.P. Whitelaw P.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 607-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the data show that the c-fos 3′-UTR is also sufficient to target a chimeric reporter to cytoskeletal-bound polysomes and the perinuclear cytoplasm. This suggests that the c-fos 3′-UTR contains a perinuclear targeting signal.It was formally possible that the perinuclear distribution of the glo·fos transcript was caused by mRNA instability rather than a mRNA targeting mechanism. However, although removal of the instability element from the 3′-UTR (glo·fosΔ) produced transcripts with a significantly longer half-life it had no effect on the perinuclear localization of transcripts or association with the cytoskeleton induced by the c-fos 3′-UTR. In addition, a further deletion in the 3′-UTR (Δ4) destroyed localization without affecting mRNA stability. These data suggest that the observed localization caused by c-fos 3′-UTR sequences is due to a mRNA localization mechanism and not an effect on mRNA instability. Furthermore, they indicate that the localization signal is distinct from the ARE instability region, and that localization by the c-fos 3′-UTR is not linked to the mRNA degradation pathway.Previous studies using stable (17Veyrune J.L. Carillo S. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2127-2134PubMed Google Scholar) and transient (18Winstall E. Gamache M. Raymond V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3796-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) transfected cell lines expressing chimeric globin-fos 3′-UTR constructs containing a IRE found that prevention of the initiation of translation (by addition of an iron chelator) led to a significant increase in the half-life of the reporter mRNA. Furthermore, removal of the ARE in the glo·fosΔ construct led to a stable mRNA that was insensitive to Fe availability (10Bonnieu A. Rech J. Jeanteur P. Fort P. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 881-888PubMed Google Scholar, 17Veyrune J.L. Carillo S. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2127-2134PubMed Google Scholar, 30Fort P. Rech J. Vie A. Piechaczyk M. Bonnieu A. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5657-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These observations indicated that the stability of transcripts due to control by the ARE within thefos 3′-UTR is linked to translation. In contrast, although the present results indicate no link between localization by thefos 3′-UTR and mRNA stability, they do suggest a link between translation and localization; alterations in Fe concentration in the medium not only prevent the initiation of translation of glo·fos and glo·fosΔ transcripts (17Veyrune J.L. Carillo S. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2127-2134PubMed Google Scholar), but also affect their localization. Because desferrioxamine has no effect on degradation of the more stable glo·fosΔ mRNA (17Veyrune J.L. Carillo S. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2127-2134PubMed Google Scholar), its effect on transcript localization (Fig. 6) cannot be accounted for by altered transcript stability. Thus, the changes in glo·fosΔ distribution in response to reduced iron availability indicate that initiation of translation is required for localization and that these effects do not reflect differences in mRNA stability.Further deletion studies showed that removal of the fos3′-UTR from 647 to the poly(A) signal and from 403 to 647 had no effect on localization. However, removal of bases 260–403 led to loss of localization without any change in transcript stability, showing that this 145-nt sequence contains the localization signal required for perinuclear localization and association with the cytoskeleton. This region has not been implicated in stability, is distinct from the ARE region, but it is highly conserved between species. More detailed investigation into the region of the c-fos 3′-UTR is required to define the exact part of a 145-nt region that is responsible for localization and to determine the precise nature of the perinuclear targeting signal.The c-fos 3′-UTR is highly conserved between species, which implies that it has an important functional role. This indeed appears to be the case and overall, the present results support the view that the c-fos 3′-UTR has a multifunctional role in mediating mRNA degradation and localization, and that these in turn are linked to translation. Furthermore, it is apparent that the elements within the 3′-UTR responsible for mRNA localization and instability are distinct. The presence of the instability element is well documented (11Shyu A.B. Greenberg M.E. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 60-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 12Shaw G. Kamen R.

Biol. 1994; 14: 8471-8482Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), but the present observation of a localization function is novel.The evidence presented here suggests that 3′-UTR sequences ensure that c-fos mRNA is translated in the correct location, namely associated with the perinuclear cytoskeleton. Furthermore, perinuclear mRNA localization on the cytoskeleton promotes efficient nuclear protein import of metallothionein-1 (32Levadoux M. Mahon C. Beattie J.H. Wallace H.M. Hesketh J.E. J. Biol.

Targeting of mRNAs to the cytoskeleton may be a general mechanism to promote efficient nuclear protein import, and this may be particularly important for an unstable protein that is required to be used as efficiently as possible (33Carillo S. Pariat M. Steff A.M. Roux P. Etiennejulan M. Lorca T. Piechaczyk M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1679-1689PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, such a mechanism could be a control point; β-actin mRNA localization responds to growth factor stimulation (34Latham V.M. Kislauskis E.H. Singer R.H. Ross A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and if c-myc or c-fos mRNA localization was modulated similarly, it could provide a mechanism to regulate nuclear localization of the protein. There is increasing evidence that many eukaryotic mRNAs have 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs)1 that contain important control sequences. These regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level through control of mRNA stability, regulation of translation efficiency, and altering the coding capacity of mRNAs. More recently, sequence elements within 3′-UTRs have been discovered that are able to localize mRNAs to particular regions of the cytoplasm (1St. Johnston D. Cell. 1995; 81: 161-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 2Hesketh J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 219-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 3Bassell G. Singer R.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In the early development of Drosophila and Xenopus, this mRNA localization is important for establishing morphological gradients, apparently leading to local protein synthesis (4Gavis E.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 485-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). mRNA localization also occurs in somatic mammalian cells such as fibroblasts where 3′-UTR sequences and the cytoskeleton have been shown to be involved in targeting mRNAs to the cell periphery and to the perinuclear cytoplasm (5Hesketh J. Campbell G. Piechaczyk M. Blanchard J.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 6Kislauskis E.H. Zhu X.C. Singer R.H. J.

Campbell G.P. Wiseman J. Blanchard J.M. Hesketh J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1185-1194PubMed Google Scholar). The c-myc mRNA has been shown to contain a localization signal within the 3′-UTR (5Hesketh J. Campbell G. Piechaczyk M. Blanchard J.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 8Veyrune J.L. Campbell G.P. Wiseman J. Blanchard J.M. Hesketh J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1185-1194PubMed Google Scholar); this directs a reporter transcript to the perinuclear cytoplasm and to polysomes bound to the cytoskeleton (5Hesketh J. Campbell G. Piechaczyk M. Blanchard J.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The perinuclear localization of c-myc mRNA and its association with the cytoskeleton has been suggested to provide local synthesis of the protein that promotes efficient import of the newly synthesized protein into the nucleus. This could be important in the case of unstable transcription factors; however, it is not clear if mRNAs coding for other transcription factors are also localized by a similar mechanism. It is well established that the c-fos proto-oncogene encodes a transcription factor that is a very unstable protein, exhibiting rapid nuclear turnover (9Muller R. Bravo R. Burckhardt J. Curran T. Nature. 1984; 312: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar) and a biphasic half-life. The equally unstable messenger RNA has been studied in some detail (10Bonnieu A. Rech J. Jeanteur P. Fort P. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 881-888PubMed Google Scholar, 11Shyu A.B. Greenberg M.E. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 60-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) and is subject to both transcriptional and post-transcriptional control. Much evidence indicates that both the coding region and the 3′-UTR contain the information required for RNA destabilization. The c-fos3′-UTR is capable of destabilizing β-globin mRNA and furthermore, AU-rich regions (ARE) within the 3′-UTR have been identified as important in instability (11Shyu A.B. Greenberg M.E. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 60-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 12Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3107) Google Scholar, 13Wilson T.

In particular, the conserved motif AUUUA has been found in a variety of unstable mRNAs coding for proto-oncogenic transcription factors and cytokines (15Caput D. Beutler B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brownshimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1670-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic lifespan of c-fos mRNA is dramatically increased by the addition of protein synthesis inhibitors, the so called “superinduction phenomenon” (9Muller R. Bravo R. Burckhardt J. Curran T. Nature. 1984; 312: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 10Bonnieu A. Rech J. Jeanteur P. Fort P. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 881-888PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wilson T. Treisman R.

Using chimeric β-globin-fos 3′-UTR gene constructs in fibroblast cell lines, reporter stability was found to increase severalfold when the translation of the reporter was decreased (17Veyrune J.L. Carillo S. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2127-2134PubMed Google Scholar, 18Winstall E. Gamache M. Raymond V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3796-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This indicated some link between translation and ARE-dependent mRNA degradation of the c-fos mRNA; however, the mechanisms require further clarification. c-fos mRNA has been shown to be enriched in cytoskeletal-bound polysomes released from the cell matrix following addition of cytochalasin D (19Bird R.C. Sells B.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 868: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Zambetti G. Wilming L. Fey E.G. Penman S. Stein J. Stein G. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 191: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), implying that c-fosmRNA is translated on cytoskeletal-bound polysomes and is associated with the cytoskeleton. However, it is not known if the c-fos mRNA is localized or if this association with the cytoskeleton involves a signal within the 3′-UTR. The aims of the present study were 3-fold: first, to determine whether the 3′-UTR of c-fos proto-oncogene contains a localization signal capable of directing a reporter construct to a distinct subcellular compartment or to the cytoskeleton; second, to study whether this localization is linked to mRNA translation/stability; and last, to determine whether the elements that regulate these aspects of mRNA fate are distinct. Cell fractionation and in situ hybridization analyses indicate that a specific 145-nt region of the c-fos 3′-UTR, distinct from the instability element, is sufficient to localize a reporter transcript. Furthermore, initiation of translation of the transcript is required for the mRNA to be localized. DISCUSSIONEndogenous c-fos mRNA has been shown to be associated with the cytoskeleton (19Bird R.C. Sells B.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 868: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Zambetti G. Wilming L. Fey E.G. Penman S. Stein J. Stein G. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 191: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The present results confirm this observation using a complementary method involving separation of cytoskeletal-bound polysomes by salt treatment of the cell matrix (23Hesketh J.E. Campbell G.P. Whitelaw P.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 607-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the data show that the c-fos 3′-UTR is also sufficient to target a chimeric reporter to cytoskeletal-bound polysomes and the perinuclear cytoplasm. This suggests that the c-fos 3′-UTR contains a perinuclear targeting signal.It was formally possible that the perinuclear distribution of the glo·fos transcript was caused by mRNA instability rather than a mRNA targeting mechanism. However, although removal of the instability element from the 3′-UTR (glo·fosΔ) produced transcripts with a significantly longer half-life it had no effect on the perinuclear localization of transcripts or association with the cytoskeleton induced by the c-fos 3′-UTR. In addition, a further deletion in the 3′-UTR (Δ4) destroyed localization without affecting mRNA stability. These data suggest that the observed localization caused by c-fos 3′-UTR sequences is due to a mRNA localization mechanism and not an effect on mRNA instability. Furthermore, they indicate that the localization signal is distinct from the ARE instability region, and that localization by the c-fos 3′-UTR is not linked to the mRNA degradation pathway.Previous studies using stable (17Veyrune J.L. Carillo S. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2127-2134PubMed Google Scholar) and transient (18Winstall E. Gamache M. Raymond V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3796-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) transfected cell lines expressing chimeric globin-fos 3′-UTR constructs containing a IRE found that prevention of the initiation of translation (by addition of an iron chelator) led to a significant increase in the half-life of the reporter mRNA. Furthermore, removal of the ARE in the glo·fosΔ construct led to a stable mRNA that was insensitive to Fe availability (10Bonnieu A. Rech J. Jeanteur P. Fort P. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 881-888PubMed Google Scholar, 17Veyrune J.L. Carillo S. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2127-2134PubMed Google Scholar, 30Fort P. Rech J. Vie A. Piechaczyk M. Bonnieu A. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5657-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These observations indicated that the stability of transcripts due to control by the ARE within thefos 3′-UTR is linked to translation. In contrast, although the present results indicate no link between localization by thefos 3′-UTR and mRNA stability, they do suggest a link between translation and localization; alterations in Fe concentration in the medium not only prevent the initiation of translation of glo·fos and glo·fosΔ transcripts (17Veyrune J.L. Carillo S. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2127-2134PubMed Google Scholar), but also affect their localization. Because desferrioxamine has no effect on degradation of the more stable glo·fosΔ mRNA (17Veyrune J.L. Carillo S. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2127-2134PubMed Google Scholar), its effect on transcript localization (Fig. 6) cannot be accounted for by altered transcript stability. Thus, the changes in glo·fosΔ distribution in response to reduced iron availability indicate that initiation of translation is required for localization and that these effects do not reflect differences in mRNA stability.Further deletion studies showed that removal of the fos3′-UTR from 647 to the poly(A) signal and from 403 to 647 had no effect on localization. However, removal of bases 260–403 led to loss of localization without any change in transcript stability, showing that this 145-nt sequence contains the localization signal required for perinuclear localization and association with the cytoskeleton. This region has not been implicated in stability, is distinct from the ARE region, but it is highly conserved between species. More detailed investigation into the region of the c-fos 3′-UTR is required to define the exact part of a 145-nt region that is responsible for localization and to determine the precise nature of the perinuclear targeting signal.The c-fos 3′-UTR is highly conserved between species, which implies that it has an important functional role. This indeed appears to be the case and overall, the present results support the view that the c-fos 3′-UTR has a multifunctional role in mediating mRNA degradation and localization, and that these in turn are linked to translation. Furthermore, it is apparent that the elements within the 3′-UTR responsible for mRNA localization and instability are distinct. The presence of the instability element is well documented (11Shyu A.B.

https://openalex.org/W2022628787,"We have investigated the participation of endogenous ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) nucleotide-binding site opener (ARNO) in desensitization of the luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin (LH/CG) receptor, independent of receptor internalization, using a cell-free plasma membrane model. We recently showed that the addition of recombinant ARNO promotes binding of β-arrestin1 to the third intracellular (3i) loop of the active LH/CG receptor, thereby reducing the ability of the receptor to activate the stimulatory G protein and signal to adenylyl cyclase. In the present report we determined whether ARNO is detectable in follicular membranes and whether the catalytically inactive E156K ARNO mutant, containing a mutation in the Sec7 domain, can act in a dominant negative manner to block LH/CG receptor desensitization. Results show that ARNO is readily detected in follicular membranes and that levels of membrane-associated ARNO increase with follicular maturation. The addition of catalytically inactive E156K ARNO blocks both the release of β-arrestin1 from its membrane docking site, based on Western blot analysis, and development of LH/CG receptor desensitization. We also investigated whether a point mutation in the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of ARNO (R280D), which blocks binding of phosphoinositides like phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) but not catalytic activity, disrupts LH/CG receptor desensitization. R280D ARNO neither promotes nor inhibits LH/CG receptor desensitization, consistent with a requirement of the PH domain of ARNO for its association with the plasma membrane. LH/CG receptor activation of ARNO is not mediated by activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) or by G protein βγ subunits. Taken together, these results suggest that LH/CG receptor promotes β-arrestin1 release from its membrane docking site to bind to the 3i loop of the LH/CG receptor via activation of membrane delimited endogenous ARNO. As ARNO activation is independent of PI 3-kinase and Gβγ, our results are consistent with a role for PIP2 in receptor-stimulated ARNO activation.

Thereafter, effector activity often declines or becomes desensitized as a result of the uncoupling of the agonist-bound receptor from its cognate G protein (1Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

We have also recently shown that LH/CG receptor activation not only exposes a binding site for β-arrestin1 at the 3i loop on the receptor but also leads to the apparent activation of the small G protein ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6), resulting in the release of a pool of β-arrestin1 from its membrane docking site (6Mukherjee S.

(c) Preincubation of membranes with synthetic N-terminal ARF6 peptide, but not with the corresponding ARF1 peptide, prevents the release of β-arrestin1 from its membrane docking site and thereby prevents development of LH/CG receptor desensitization (6Mukherjee S.

A. 2000; 97: 5901-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). LH/CG receptor-dependent activation of the small G protein ARF6 is consistent with earlier studies showing that LH/CG receptor desensitization exhibits an obligatory requirement for GTP (3Ekstrom R.C.

Based on our evidence that the addition of exogenous ARNO in the presence of 1 μm GTP frees a pool of β-arrestin1 to bind to the 3i loop of the activated LH/CG receptor to block receptor interaction with Gs (6Mukherjee S. Gurevich V.V. Jones J.C.R. Casanova J.E. Frank S.R. Maizels E.T. Bader M.-F. Kahn R.A. Palczewski K. Aktories K. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5901-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that LH/CG receptor-dependent activation of ARF6 might be mediated by activation of endogenous, membrane-delimited ARNO. In the present report we therefore sought to determine whether endogenousmembrane-delimited ARNO participates in LH/CG receptor desensitization. All chemicals were from previously described sources (4Mukherjee S. Palczewski K. Gurevich V.V. Hunzicker-Dunn M. J. Biol.

A sucrose gradient-purified membrane fraction enriched in adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity was isolated from preovulatory-size porcine ovarian follicles and stored at −70 °C (6Mukherjee S. Gurevich V.V. Jones J.C.R. Casanova J.E. Frank S.R. Maizels E.T. Bader M.-F. Kahn R.A. Palczewski K. Aktories K. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12984-12989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) is summarized in the Fig. 2 legend. Supernatant and pellet fractions of porcine ovarian follicles were obtained by homogenizing tissue in 10 mm TRIS-HCl, pH 7.0, 1.0 mm EDTA with a glass-glass Dounce homogenizer (∼10 strokes) followed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min and then at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The final pellet was resuspended in 1 volume of the original homogenate, and an aliquot of the final supernatant and pellet fractions was obtained for protein determination. SDS-STOP was then added, and samples were boiled for 10 min and stored at −70 °C. Western blotting with anti-β-arrestin antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), the pan-arrestin antibody F4C1, and affinity-purified anti-ARNO antibody (7Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Cassanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) was performed as described previously (6Mukherjee S. Gurevich V.V. Jones J.C.R. Casanova J.E. Frank S.R. Maizels E.T. Bader M.-F. Kahn R.A. Palczewski K. Aktories K. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The results were analyzed using Student's t test (p < 0.05) (12Bender F.E. Douglass L.W. Kramer A. Statistical Methods for Food and Agriculture. AVI Publishing Co., Inc., Westport, CT1982Google Scholar). We first determined whether ARNO is detectable in follicular membranes enriched in AC activity. Results (Fig.1 A, lane 4) show that a band reactive with affinity purified anti-ARNO antibody (7Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Cassanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) is readily detectable in porcine ovarian follicular membranes and migrates on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis somewhat faster than His6-tagged recombinant human ARNO (lanes 5–8). Quantitation of the amount of ARNO in partially purified ovarian follicular membranes by Western blotting, using the signal generated by recombinant ARNO as the standard, yielded a concentration of ∼1.5 μg of ARNO protein (or 32 nmol)/mg of membrane protein. The basis for the ARNO doublet (see Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–3) is not known but might correspond to phosphorylated and unphosphorylated ARNO (13Santy L.C. Frank S.R. Hatfield J.C. Casanova J.E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1173-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Frank S.R. Hatfield J.C. Casanova J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3133-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We additionally determined whether the amount of ARNO present in unpurified 10,000 × g membrane and supernatant fractions is regulated by follicular maturation. Results (Fig.1 B) show that whereas ARNO levels are relatively low and unregulated in the supernatant fractions of small (1–2 mm) compared with large (8–10 mm) follicles, the levels of ARNO in the membrane fraction are higher (∼6-fold) in large preovulatory follicles enriched in LH/CG receptors compared with levels in small immature follicles that do not contain LH/CG receptors (15Channing C.P. Kammerman S. Biol. Reprod. 1974; 10: 179-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These results show that the expression of ARNO is increased with development of porcine follicles from an immature to a preovulatory phenotype and that the majority of ARNO is localized to the pellet fraction. Based on evidence that ARNO is readily detected in membranes of preovulatory-size follicles, we next sought to determine whether catalytically inactive ARNO could compete with endogenous ARNO to block agonist-dependent LH/CG receptor desensitization. The E156K mutation in the Sec7 domain of ARNO blocks the ability of ARNO to promote GTP exchange at ARF6 but does not disrupt its ability to bind phosphoinositides via its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (14Frank S.R. Hatfield J.C. Casanova J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3133-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although preincubation of membranes with 50 (not shown) or 100 nm (Fig. 2 A) E156K ARNO did not affect the extent of LH/CG receptor desensitization (hCG/hCG conditions), preincubation of membranes with 200 nm E156K ARNO significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the extent of LH/CG receptor desensitization. Thus, when membranes were preincubated with 200 (Fig. 2 A), 300, or 400 (not shown) nm E156K ARNO, hCG-stimulated AC activity measured with hCG in stage 1 (i.e. desensitization conditions) was no longer significantly different from values measured with BSA in stage 1. The capability of E156K ARNO to block LH/CG receptor desensitization was lost when E156K ARNO was boiled (Fig.2 B). The addition of E156K ARNO directly to the 5-min AC assay did not affect basal or hCG-, forskolin-, or aluminum fluoride-stimulated AC activities (Fig. 2 C). This result shows that E156K ARNO does not have a nonspecific effect on AC activity or on the ability of the LH/CG receptor or Gs to activate AC. To ascertain whether E156K ARNO indeed blocks development of LH/CG receptor desensitization by preventing ARF6 activation, we determined whether E156K ARNO blocks the release of β-arrestin1 from its membrane docking site. In the absence of LH/CG receptor activation, β-arrestin1 was readily detectable in follicular membranes (Fig.2 D, lane 4), presumably bound at a docking site distinct from the LH/CG receptor (6Mukherjee S. Gurevich V.V. Jones J.C.R. Casanova J.E. Frank S.R. Maizels E.T. Bader M.-F. Kahn R.A. Palczewski K. Aktories K. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5901-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Incubation of membranes with hCG resulted in the retention of a fraction of β-arrestin1 at the membrane (Fig. 2 D, lane 3). This fraction of β-arrestin1 was competed away with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 3i loop of the LH/CG receptor (lane 2), consistent with the premise that LH/CG receptor activation results in the binding of a fraction of β-arrestin1 to the 3i loop of the activated LH/CG receptor (4Mukherjee S. Palczewski K. Gurevich V.V. Hunzicker-Dunn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12984-12989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 6Mukherjee S. Gurevich V.V. Jones J.C.R. Casanova J.E. Frank S.R. Maizels E.T. Bader M.-F. Kahn R.A. Palczewski K. Aktories K. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5901-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, when E156K ARNO was included in the membrane incubation mix with hCG and 3i peptide, this fraction of β-arrestin1 was retained in the membrane (lane 1), presumably at its membrane docking site as it was no longer competed away by the 3i peptide. These results suggested that exogenous catalytically dead E156K ARNO effectively competes with endogenous ARNO to block the ability of the activated LH/CG receptor to promote β-arrestin1 release and consequent LH/CG receptor desensitization. Based on these results we can therefore conclude that endogenous ARNO is activated to promote GTP exchange at ARF6 in response to LH/CG receptor activation. ARNO contains a C-terminal PH domain that can bind phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), the product of PI(4,5)bisphosphatate 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), with high selectivity and affinity (Kd∼85 nm (16Venkateswarlu K. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 463-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar)). A point mutation at R280D in the PH domain of ARNO results in a mutant protein that retains its catalytic activity to promote GTP exchange on ARF6 but cannot bind phosphoinositides (14Frank S.R. Hatfield J.C. Casanova J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3133-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We have shown that, unlike catalytically active wild-type ARNO (at 25 nm), which promotes LH/CG receptor desensitization, R280D ARNO at 50 nm does not promote LH/CG receptor desensitization (6Mukherjee S. Gurevich V.V. Jones J.C.R. Casanova J.E. Frank S.R. Maizels E.T. Bader M.-F. Kahn R.A. Palczewski K. Aktories K. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5901-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This result suggests that the binding of phosphoinositides to the PH domain of ARNO is obligatory for LH/CG receptor to promote activation of ARNO. We therefore sought to determine whether R280D ARNO could function like E156K ARNO in a dominant negative manner to block development of LH/CG receptor desensitization in response to receptor activation. Preincubation of follicular membranes with 200 (Fig.3 A) or 300 nm (not shown) R280D ARNO does not affect the ability of receptor activation to promote LH/CG receptor desensitization. Consistent with this result, preincubation of membranes with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin at 100 nm does not reduce the extent of LH/CG receptor desensitization (Fig. 3 B). As some PH domains also bind the βγ subunits of activated G proteins (17Bottomley M.J. Salim K. Panayotou G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 165-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we tested whether a βγ inhibitor peptide (18Chen J. DeVivo M. Dingus J. Harry A. Li J. Sui J. Carty D.J. Blank J.L. Exton J.H. Stoffel R.H. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Logothetis D.E. Hildebrandt J.D. Iyengar R. Science. 1975; 268: 1166-1169Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar), corresponding to residues 956–982 of AC2, could block development of LH/CG receptor desensitization. The results (Fig. 3 C) show that preincubation of follicular membranes with 10 μm βγ-inhibitor peptide QEHA (QEHAQEPEROYMCHIGTMVEFAYALVGK), which blocks βγ-dependent stimulation of AC2, β-adrenergic receptor kinase, and phospholipase C (18Chen J. DeVivo M. Dingus J. Harry A. Li J. Sui J. Carty D.J. Blank J.L. Exton J.H. Stoffel R.H. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Logothetis D.E. Hildebrandt J.D. Iyengar R. Science. 1975; 268: 1166-1169Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar), does not affect LH/CG receptor desensitization. Higher concentrations of the QEHA peptide inhibited basal and hCG- and forskolin-stimulated AC activities (Fig.3 C and not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that PIP3 or βγ signaling through the PH domain of ARNO does not appear to be obligatory for the activated LH/CG receptor to promote GTP exchange at ARF. ARNO is detected in a purified membrane fraction enriched in AC activity obtained from preovulatory-size porcine ovarian follicles at a concentration of ∼32 nmol/mg of membrane protein. Moreover, the expression of ARNO appears to be regulated with follicular maturation. Higher levels of ARNO are detected in membranes of mature preovulatory (8–10 mm) porcine follicles, which express LH/CG receptors, compared with small (1–2 mm) follicles, which do not express LH/CG receptors (15Channing C.P. Kammerman S. Biol. Reprod. 1974; 10: 179-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). That increased expression of ARNO correlates with the induction of LH/CG receptors is very interesting and suggests that the same stimulus that induces LH/CG receptors, namely follicle-stimulating hormone (19Hsueh A.J.W. Adashi E.Y. Jones P.B.C. Welsh Jr., T.H. Endocr. Rev. 1984; 5: 76-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar), might also increase expression of ARNO. These results further suggest that ARNO, in an apparently inactive conformation, is constitutively associated with the plasma membrane of preovulatory ovarian follicles. The conclusion that ARNO is present in an inactive conformation and is activated upon engagement of the LH/CG receptor is based not only on results presented in Fig. 2, showing that LH/CG receptor desensitization is blocked by E156K ARNO, but also on evidence that ARF activation, measured as cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of the long form of Gαs, is negligible in the absence of LH/CG receptor activation (20Rajagopalan-Gupta R.M. Rasenick M.M. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 538-549PubMed Google Scholar). 2L. M. Salvador, S. Mukherjee, R. A. Kahn, M. L. Lamm, M.-F. Bader, H. Hamm, M. M. Rasenick, J. E. Casanova, and M. Hunzicker-Dunn, manuscript in preparation. The basis for the apparently constitutive membrane association of ARNO is not clear. However, in other cellular models there is also evidence that a large portion of total cellular ARNO can be associated constitutively with the plasma membrane in the absence of directed membrane-receptor activation both on overexpression in various cell lines (7Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Cassanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and in chromaffin cells isolated from bovine adrenal glands (21Caumont A.-S. Vitale N. Gensse M. Galas M.-C. Casanova J.E. Bader M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15637-15644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have shown with the porcine follicular membrane model that catalytically inactive E156K ARNO acts in a dominant negative manner to selectively block the development of LH/CG receptor desensitization in response to LH/CG receptor activation. Catalytically inactive E156K ARNO blocks the obligatory release of β-arrestin1 from its membrane docking site. As a result, the LH/CG receptor remains active to signal to Gs and AC despite the continued presence of saturating concentrations of receptor agonist. This result suggests that LH/CG receptor desensitization requires the activation of endogenous ARNO. However, based on the recent identification of the exchange factor for ARF6 (EFA6) (22Franco M. Peters P.J. Boretto J. van Donselaar E. neri A. D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1480-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), in which the guanine nucleotide exchange activity is also insensitive to brefeldin A, we cannot rule out the possibility that the apparent dominant negative effect of E156K ARNO is attributable to its potential ability to sequester available ARF6, thus indirectly blocking LH/CG receptor desensitization potentially mediated by EFA6. ARNO, along with GRP1 and cytohesin-1, comprise a subfamily of guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the ARFs in which the guanine nucleotide exchange activity is not inhibited by the fungal metabolite brefeldin A (7Frank S.

Each of these factors contains an N-terminal coiled-coil domain, a central Sec7 domain, that is sufficient for guanine nucleotide exchange activity on ARF (26Roth M.G. Cell. 1999; 97: 149-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and is highly homologous with the SEC7 gene in yeast which encodes a GEF required for protein secretion (reviewed in Ref. 27Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21431-21434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), a C-terminal PH domain, and an adjacent cluster of basic residues (c domain) (8Chardin P. Paris S.

The PH domain of the proteins in this subfamily appears to be necessary both for their plasma membrane association and for subsequent guanine nucleotide exchange activity toward membrane-localized ARFs (14Frank S.R.

These guanine nucleotide exchange proteins are often localized to the cytosolic fraction of unstimulated cells and have been shown to translocate to the plasma membrane in response to receptor activation by insulin or epidermal growth factor in 3T3 L1 adipocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells (16Venkateswarlu K.

Consistent with these results, transfection of cells with ARNO or cytohesin-1 containing a mutation in the PH domain disrupts the plasma membrane association of these proteins and consequent biological responses, namely cytohesin-1-dependent β2 integrin adhesion to adhesion molecule 1 in Jurkat E6 leukemia cells (23Nagel W.

The predominant ligands that have been shown to bind to the PH domains of these GEFs are phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and PIP3 (31Jackson C.L. Casanova J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 60-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Although there have been seemingly contradictory results on the affinities of the PH domains of these proteins for PIP2 or PIP3, recent evidence from the Czech laboratory (32Klarlund J. Tsiaras W.

Chem. 2000; 275: 32816-32821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) has resolved this apparent controversy by showing that ARNO, GRP1, and cytohesin-1 can exhibit either high selectivity for PIP3 or equivalent selectivity for PIP3 and PIP2 depending on whether the PH domain contains a diglycine or triglycine motif, respectively. Moreover, isoforms of each of the proteins in this subfamily appear to exist that express either the diglycine or triglycine motif even in the same tissue (7Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H.

Consistent with this result, recruitment and activation of these GEFs can depend on either PIP2 or PIP3, contingent upon whether the diglycine or triglycine motif in the PH domain is present (8Chardin P.

There is also evidence for ARNO and cytohesin-1 that the adjacent C-terminal polybasic c domain cooperates with the PH domain to bind these GEFs tightly to the membrane, possibly by binding a phospholipid with a negative charge (8Chardin P.

LH/CG receptor desensitization is not inhibited by a point mutation in the PH domain of ARNO, which blocks its binding to all phosphoinositides. One interpretation of these results is that LH/CG receptor-dependent activation of ARNO is independent of the PH domain of ARNO. If phosphoinositide binding to the PH domain is not necessary for ARNO activation, then one would predict that R280D ARNO, like wild-type recombinant ARNO, should promote LH/CG receptor desensitization, since R280D ARNO retains its GTP exchange activity (14Frank S.R. Hatfield J.C. Casanova J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3133-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Yet, R280D ARNO does not promote LH/CG receptor desensitization (Ref. 6Mukherjee S. Gurevich V.V. Jones J.C.R. Casanova J.E. Frank S.R. Maizels E.T. Bader M.-F. Kahn R.A. Palczewski K. Aktories K. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5901-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar and present report). The inability of R280D ARNO to promote LH/CG receptor desensitization might be attributable to its inability to appropriately associate with the plasma membrane because of the mutation in its PH domain. A similar argument can be made for the inability of R280D to block desensitization in a dominant negative manner. Our results showing that R280D ARNO neither stimulates nor inhibits LH/CG receptor desensitization indirectly suggest that the PH domain of ARNO is indeed necessary at least for its membrane association. However, the ineffectiveness of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin to block desensitization indicates that ARNO activation is not dependent on PIP3 generated by PI 3-kinase activation. As PIP3 does not appear to participate in the activation of ARNO leading to LH/CG receptor desensitization, it is likely that the predominant ARNO present in follicle membranes contains the triglycine motif in its PH domain, which does not selectively bind PIP3 but rather binds PIP2 with equivalent affinity (32Klarlund J.

The recombinant E156K ARNO and ARNO proteins that we have used contain the triglycine motif and are regulated by PIP2 rather than PIP3 (13Santy L.C. Frank S.R. Hatfield J.C. Casanova J.E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1173-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our results therefore suggest that membrane PIP2, either locally synthesized or unmasked, is required for LH/CG receptor to activate ARNO. LH/CG receptor activation has been shown to promote PIP2 synthesis (37Dimino M.J. Snitzer J. Noland Jr., T.A. Biol. Reprod. 1987; 36: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 38Davis J.S. Weakland L.L. Farese R.V. West L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8515-8521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is also evidence that ARF6 in a GTP- and phosphatidic acid-dependent manner can activate PI 4-phosphate 5-kinase (39Honda A. Nogami M. Yokozeki T. Yamazaki M. Nakamura H. Watanabe H.

Future studies are needed to determine how the ability of ARNO to activate ARF is regulated downstream of the LH/CG receptor. LH/CG receptor desensitization is also not inhibited by the βγ inhibitor peptide QEHA. The ineffectiveness of the βγ inhibitor peptide QEHA is supported by our earlier evidence that neither transducin βγ (at 1 μm) nor rat liver βγ (at 400 nm) stimulates LH/CG receptor desensitization and that the βγ scavenger GST-β-adrenergic receptor kinase-peptide fusion protein (at 14 μm) does not inhibit LH/CG receptor desensitization (41Rajagopalan-Gupta R.M. Mukherjee S. Zhu X. Ho Y.-K. Hamm H. Birnbaumer M. Birnbaumer L. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1612-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Gβγ binding to the PH domain of ARNO does not mediate LH/CG receptor activation of ARNO. These results, however, do not rule out the possibility that ARNO is anchored to the membrane via Gβγ proteins. In conclusion, these studies show that endogenousmembrane-delimited ARNO appears to be obligatory for the LH/CG receptor to promote β-arrestin1 release from its membrane docking site and receptor desensitization based on the ability of catalytically inactive ARNO to block both of these responses. Although ARNO activation by the LH/CG receptor is independent of PIP3 and Gβγ, ARNO activation could well be dependent on PIP2. The PH domain of ARNO also appears to be required for its membrane association, but the ligand that interacts with this domain to promote membrane binding is unlikely to be the same one that leads to its activation.

https://openalex.org/W2081015395,"Removal of Ca2+ from tobacco suspension cell medium has two immediate effects on cytosolic Ca2+ fluxes: (i) externally derived Ca2+ influx (occurring in response to cold shock or hypo-osmotic shock) is inhibited, and (ii) organellar Ca2+ release (induced by a fungally derived defense elicitor, caffeine, or hypo-osmotic shock) is elevated. We show here that the enhanced release of internal Ca2+ is likely due to increased discharge from a caffeine-sensitive store in response to a signal transduced from an extracellular Ca2+ sensor. Thus, chelation of extracellular Ca2+ in the absence of any other stimulus directly activates release of intracellular Ca2+ into the cytosol. Evidence that this chelator-activated Ca2+ flux is dependent on a signaling pathway includes its abrogation by prior treatment with caffeine, and its inhibition by protein kinase inhibitors (K252a and staurosporine) and anion channel blockers (niflumate and anthracene-9-carboxylate). An unexpected characteristic of tobacco cell adaptation to low external Ca2+ was the emergence of a new Ca2+compartment that was inaccessible to external EGTA, yet responsive to the usual stimulants of extracellular Ca2+ entry. Thus, cells that are exposed to EGTA for 20 min lose sensitivity to caffeine and defense elicitors, indicating that their intracellular Ca2+ pools have been depleted. Surprisingly, these same cells simultaneously regain their ability to respond to stimuli that usually activate extracellular Ca2+ influx even though all external Ca2+ is chelated. Because this gradual restoration of Ca2+ influx can be inhibited by the same kinase inhibitors that block EGTA-activated Ca2+ release, we propose that chelator-activated Ca2+ release from internal stores leads to deposition of this Ca2+ into a novel EGTA- and caffeine-insensitive compartment that can subsequently be activated by stimulants of extracellular Ca2+ entry.

Brownlee C. Harper J.F. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 691-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Examples of such stresses include cold shock, which stimulates an influx primarily of extracellular Ca2+ (2Knight H. Trewavas A.J. Knight M.R. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 3Knight M.R. Campbell A.K. Smith S.M. Trewavas A.J. Nature. 1991; 352: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar); pathogen infection and defense elicitor stimulation, which activate Ca2+pulses largely from internal Ca2+ pools (4Chandra S. Stennis M.J. Low P.S,. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28274-28280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 5Cessna S.G. Low P.S. Planta. in press, 2001Google Scholar, 6Xu H. Heath M.C. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar); and hypo-osmotic shock, which activates a biphasic Ca2+transient deriving first from outside and then from inside the cell (7Cessna S.G. Chandra S. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27286-27291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,8Takahashi K. Isobe M. Knight M.R. Trewavas A.J. Muto S. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that, in the case of the hypo-osmotic shock-induced Ca2+ pulses, inhibition of either of the two Ca2+ pulses generally leads to greater Ca2+entry during the uninhibited pulse (7Cessna S.G. Chandra S. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27286-27291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We have thus surmised that an internal Ca2+ store might receive information regarding the Ca2+ status of the external store and vice versa(7Cessna S.G. Chandra S. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27286-27291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this way, a deficiency in the Ca2+ content of either the intracellular or extracellular Ca2+ pool could be compensated by additional release of Ca2+ from the undepleted pool. It has already been established that animal cells can communicate the Ca2+ status of their internal compartments to the external Ca2+ pool. Thus, after stimulation of internal Ca2+ release, the resulting depletion of ER1 Ca2+ has been observed to induce a slow refilling of the ER by influx across the plasma membrane. This phenomenon has been referred to as store-operated calcium entry (9Takemura H. Hughes A.R. Thastrup O. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12266-12271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar, 11Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar). The mechanism of activation of this process is still debated (12Lewis R.S. Adv. Phosphoprotein Second Messenger Res. 1999; 33: 279-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), but there is general agreement that some ER protein must monitor luminal Ca2+ levels and signal the plasma membrane to initiate Ca2+ influx when ER levels fall. Conversely, vertebrate animal cells are also believed to communicate the availability of external Ca2+ across their cytoplasm to internal Ca2+ stores by signaling through aCa2+-sensing Receptor (CaR) (13Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A Lytton J. Herbert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar). CaR is a seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor expressed in the plasma membrane of several different cell types, most notably those involved in Ca2+ homeostasis (e.g. parathyroid) (14Yamaguchi T. Chattopadhyay N. Brown E.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 47: 209-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Riccardi D. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). CaR is activated in the presence of high levels of extracellular Ca2+ and communicates with the cell's interior by a signal transduction cascade that often involves the release of Ca2+ from the ER (16McGehee D.S. Aldersberg M. Liu K.-P. Hsuing S.-C. Heath M.J.S. Tamir H. J. Physiol. 1997; 502: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). CaR-mediated signaling pathways modulate the secretion of various Ca2+-regulating hormones that maintain Ca2+ homeostasis in distal tissues (14Yamaguchi T. Chattopadhyay N. Brown E.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 47: 209-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16McGehee D.S. Aldersberg M. Liu K.-P. Hsuing S.-C. Heath M.J.S. Tamir H. J. Physiol. 1997; 502: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that plants and vertebrates must have very different mechanisms of Ca2+ homeostasis, it is also likely that plant cells will likewise monitor both internal and external Ca2+ stores and develop some means of compensation when one of these stores becomes depleted. We report here that plant cells indeed respond to depletion of their extracellular Ca2+ reserves by activating the release of Ca2+ from internal stores. The route of communication between external and internal Ca2+ pools appears to require the function of protein kinases and anion channels. Further, after long term removal of external Ca2+ and the consequent depletion of the prominent internal store, plant cells appear to sequester their remaining Ca2+ in a caffeine-insensitive, EGTA-inaccessible compartment that can still be activated in response to stimuli that normally promote externally derived Ca2+ influx. Tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacumL. var. Wisconsin-38) were transformed with the aequorin-encoding plasmid pMAQ2 (3Knight M.R. Campbell A.K. Smith S.M. Trewavas A.J. Nature. 1991; 352: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar) by the method of Liu et al. (17Liu D. Raghothama K.G. Hasegawa P.M. Bressan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1888-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Suspension cultures were then established and maintained as previously reported (5Cessna S.G. Low P.S. Planta. in press, 2001Google Scholar) by continuous shaking in Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal growth medium (Sigma; Ref. 18Murashige T. Skoog F. Plant Physiol. 1962; 15: 473-491Crossref Scopus (53958) Google Scholar). MS medium contains the following ionic species in the given concentrations: NH 4+, 20.61 mm; K+, 20.045 mm; Ca2+; 2.99 mm; Mg2+, 1.05 mm; Na+, 0.101 mm; Mn2+, 0.1 mm; Fe2+, 0.1 mm; Zn2+, 0.029 mm; Cu2+, 0.0001 mm; Co2+, 0.0001 mm; NO 3−, 39.4 mm; Cl−, 2.99 mm; SO 42−, 1.73 mm; PO 43−, 1.25 mm; ethylenediaminetetraacetate4−, 0.1 mm; BO 3−, 0.1 mm; I−, 0.005 mm; MnO 42−, 0.001 mm, pH 5.7 (18Murashige T. Skoog F. Plant Physiol. 1962; 15: 473-491Crossref Scopus (53958) Google Scholar). Nonionic components include: sucrose (30 g/liter), enzymatic casein hydrolysate (1 mg/liter), and trace amounts of plant growth regulators, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (3 mg/liter), and kinetin (0.002 mg/liter). The osmolality of the medium was measured at 180–200 mosm with an osmometer. Three different aequorin-expressing cell lines from three different transgenic parent plants were studied. Because these different cell lines expressed varying levels of aequorin protein, yet behaved similarly in each of the experiments performed, we conclude that incorporation and expression of the aequorin transgene did not alter plant cell responses. Luminometry of aequorin-transformed suspension cultures was performed as previously described, with some minor changes (4Chandra S. Stennis M.J. Low P.S,. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28274-28280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h after subculture into fresh MS medium, cell cultures were incubated in 1 μm coelenterazine (Biosynth International, Naperville, IL) for 4–8 h. 1 ml of cell culture was then transferred to a luminometer cuvette that was placed in an LKB-Wallac Bio-Orbit luminometer chamber. Luminescence was recorded 10 times/s using Rainin Dynamax-LC software (Woburn, MA). EGTA and other treatments were added as indicated in the figure legends. A 90 mm stock solution of EGTA buffered to pH 5.7 (osmolality measured at 200 mosm) was used for all experiments. No measurable change in medium pH or osmolality occurred after EGTA additions to cell cultures up to [EGTA] = 45 mm. To quantitate the undischarged aequorin at the end of each experiment, cells were solubilized by injecting 200 μl of a solution containing 10% Nonidet P-40 and 500 mm CaCl2 into the luminometer chamber, and residual luminescence was recorded. Luminescence traces were then transformed by computer program (4Chandra S. Stennis M.J. Low P.S,. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28274-28280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) directly into [Ca2+]cyt using the equation described by Allen et al. (19Allen D.G. Blinks J.R. Prendergast F.G. Science. 1977; 195: 996-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). External Ca2+ was measured with the fluorescent Ca2+-indicating dye Oregon Green BAPTA 5N (λex = 494 nm, λem = 523 nm; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Because of its relatively low affinity for Ca2+ (Kd ∼ 20 μmCa2+, at pH = 7), Oregon Green BAPTA 5N accurately reports Ca2+ concentrations ranging from <1 μm to >400 μm. To quantitate extracellular free Ca2+, 10 μg of dye/ml was added to the fluorimeter cuvette together with cell filtrates, and fluorescence was recorded. Estimates of the free Ca2+ content of the medium after addition of EGTA (pKd EGTA-Ca = 7.39) were made using the MINTEQA2 environmental modeling software (United States Environmental Protection Agency, Center for Exposure Assessment Modeling, Athens, GA), assuming all ion concentrations listed in the Murashige and Skoog medium above, a suspension pH of 5.7, and no Ca2+ dissociation from the cell wall (20Allison J.D. Brown D.S.. Soil Sci. Am. 1995; 42: 241-252Google Scholar). We have previously shown that inhibition of external Ca2+ influx can lead to elevation of internally derived Ca2+ release (7Cessna S.G. Chandra S. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27286-27291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, as shown in Fig. 1 A, chelation of extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA not only inhibits the first phase of hypotonically stimulated Ca2+ entry (externally derived influx), but also elevates the second pulse (internally derived) of Ca2+ entry into the cytosol. Because elevation of the internally derived component was apparent whether we applied Ca2+ chelators (EGTA, EDTA, or BAPTA) or exchanged the cell medium for Ca2+-free buffers (data not shown), these reciprocal effects on the Ca2+ pulses are concluded to derive from removal of external Ca2+ rather than any Ca2+-independent effect of EGTA. The compensatory increase in discharge of intracellular Ca2+ following chelation of extracellular Ca2+implies some type of communication between the two Ca2+pools. Conceivably, a cytosolic Ca2+ sensor (i.e. a Ca2+ and/or calmodulin-regulated protein kinase; Ref. 21Harmon A.C. Gribskov M. Harper J.F. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 154-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) could detect the absence of the first (externally derived) Ca2+ transient and transmit that information to the intracellular store. Alternatively, the absence of extracellular Ca2+ could be directly detected by an extracellular sensor that signals to the intracellular store independent of any perturbation of the stimulated Ca2+ entry. To distinguish these two mechanisms, we examined the impact of external Ca2+chelators on the discharge of intracellular Ca2+ following treatment with stimuli that have no effect on external Ca2+influx. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the cytosolic Ca2+pulse stimulated by caffeine, a drug that activates the release of Ca2+ only from internal stores (7Cessna S.G. Chandra S. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27286-27291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), is elevated when initiated immediately after EGTA addition. In contrast, cold shock activates a Ca2+ pulse that derives primarily from external stores (2Knight H. Trewavas A.J. Knight M.R. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 3Knight M.R. Campbell A.K. Smith S.M. Trewavas A.J. Nature. 1991; 352: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar), and EGTA treatment potently inhibits its expression (Fig. 1 C). It would thus appear that removal of external Ca2+ has two immediate effects on Ca2+ fluxes in tobacco cells: (i) it leads to inhibition of any externally derived Ca2+ influx, and (ii) it triggers elevation of internally derived Ca2+ release. Because the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ release proceeds even in the absence of any change in entry of extracellular Ca2+, we suggest that the Ca2+ detection system involves an extracellular sensor. To further explore whether extracellular Ca2+ levels might be communicated to intracellular Ca2+ stores, EGTA was added directly to cell suspensions and cytosolic [Ca2+] was again monitored in the luminometer. As shown in Fig.2 A, chelation of external Ca2+ by addition of 9 mm EGTA results in an irregular Ca2+ transient that continues for more than 10 min. A measurable increase in cytosolic Ca2+ could even be detected after adding only 2 mm EGTA, which still leaves the extracellular concentration of free Ca2+ at roughly 1 mm (Fig. 2 B). To more quantitatively evaluate the impact of external Ca2+ removal on the magnitude of the stimulated internal Ca2+ flux, a computer-generated estimate of the external free Ca2+ at various concentrations of added EGTA is also provided (Fig. 2 B) (MINTEQA2, Ref. 20Allison J.D. Brown D.S.. Soil Sci. Am. 1995; 42: 241-252Google Scholar). This estimate takes into account the 2.99 mm Ca2+ and all other ionic species in the medium, but does not consider the Ca2+ stored in the cell wall, which, if substantial, could shift the dotted line to the right. In view of these considerations, the close reciprocal relationship between the two traces is remarkable and suggests some type of functional linkage between log[Ca2+ex]free and the amplitude of internal Ca2+ release, with half-maximal Ca2+ flux occurring when external Ca2+concentrations are reduced to ∼10−5.5m. To further demonstrate that the chelator-activated Ca2+flux arises because of removal of external Ca2+, and not because of any other effect of EGTA, we conducted analogous studies using BAPTA, an unrelated Ca2+ chelator. When BAPTA was added to suspension cultures at a concentration of 5 mm, the cells responded with a cytosolic Ca2+ flux that reached an average of 0.083 ± 0.055 μm Ca2+(n = 3). Although the magnitude of the BAPTA-induced Ca2+ flux was admittedly more variable than that measured after EGTA addition, the data still support the conclusion that removal of external Ca2+ results in a substantial cytosolic Ca2+ flux regardless of the method of Ca2+chelation. Although both EGTA and BAPTA prefer Ca2+ over many other bivalent cations, it was still conceivable that the Ca2+fluxes might have been induced by removal of other cations. To examine this possibility, tobacco cells were first activated with EGTA (until the usual chelator-induced increase in cytosolic Ca2+ was observed), and then external Ca2+ was restored by injection of enough CaCl2 to compensate for the presence of EGTA. As shown in Fig. 2 C, restoration of external Ca2+to EGTA-treated cells returns the cytosolic Ca2+ activity to its basal level. Because addition of MgCl2 does not alter the EGTA-induced Ca2+ flux (Fig. 2 C), we conclude that the chelator-activated Ca2+ flux is mediated by a Ca2+ sensor that cannot respond to Mg2+. To characterize the Ca2+ pools involved in the chelator-induced Ca2+ transients, we first depleted the internal Ca2+ stores by incubating cells in caffeine for an extended period (7Cessna S.G. Chandra S. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27286-27291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and then tested whether EGTA could still induce an increase in Ca2+ levels. As shown in Fig.3 A, caffeine-treated cells no longer respond to EGTA with a transient rise in cytosolic Ca2+, indicating that the Ca2+ pulses induced by removal of external Ca2+ derive from caffeine-sensitive internal stores. To further confirm that a caffeine-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ pool is specifically responsive to external Ca2+ removal, the ability of caffeine itself to trigger release of Ca2+ was evaluated as a function of time after EGTA addition. As seen in Fig. 3 A, caffeine-induced Ca2+ release is prominent in tobacco cells immediately prior to Ca2+ chelation, but diminishes with time following EGTA addition until its disappearance by 20 min after chelation.V. dahlia elicitor-triggered Ca2+ pulses, which also derive from a caffeine-sensitive intracellular compartment (5Cessna S.G. Low P.S. Planta. in press, 2001Google Scholar), display the same kinetics of depletion (Fig. 3 C). We, therefore, conclude that the EGTA-induced Ca2+ pulses derive from the same intracellular compartment that releases Ca2+ in response to both caffeine and Verticilium dahlia elicitor stimulation. To begin to assess the mechanism by which a change in extracellular Ca2+ might be communicated to caffeine-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores, we next examined the impact of pharmacological agents that were previously found to regulate intracellular Ca2+ fluxes in tobacco cells (5Cessna S.G. Low P.S. Planta. in press, 2001Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, cells that are treated with either the protein kinase inhibitor, K252a (Fig. 4 A), or the anion channel blocker, niflumate (Fig. 4 B), display little or no response upon subsequent stimulation with EGTA. Similar data are also obtained when another kinase inhibitor, staurosporine (4 μm), or a different class of anion channel blocker (anthracene-9-carboxylate, 200 μm) is employed (data not shown). We, therefore, suggest that the extracellular Ca2+sensor requires participation of kinases and anion fluxes to promote release of Ca2+ from an internal Ca2+ pool. Although long term exposure to EGTA leads to the gradual depletion of internal Ca2+ stores, as evidenced by our inability to elicit release of Ca2+ from these compartments (Fig. 3), the same long term depletion of extracellular Ca2+ leads surprisingly to a gradual restoration of sensitivity to stimulants of external Ca2+ entry. Thus, cytosolic Ca2+pulses activated by cold shock or hypo-osmotic shock, which are well documented to arise predominantly from external Ca2+ pools (2Knight H. Trewavas A.J. Knight M.R. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 3Knight M.R. Campbell A.K. Smith S.M. Trewavas A.J. Nature. 1991; 352: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 7Cessna S.G. Chandra S. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27286-27291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), gradually reappear following extended (∼20 min) depletion of extracellular Ca2+. As seen in Fig.5, the first phase of Ca2+influx following hypo-osmotic shock converts from almost complete inhibition immediately following EGTA addition, to nearly normal Ca2+ entry after 20 min of EGTA treatment (Fig. 5,A and B). As the concentration of chelator was increased to as much as 36 mm, the first peak continues its return to control levels, whereas the second internally derived pulse becomes dramatically diminished (Fig. 5 C). Importantly, similar results are also obtained when cold shock is assayed in place of hypo-osmotic shock (Fig. 5 D), suggesting that the recovery of responsiveness after extended exposure to an extracellular chelator may be a general characteristic of any stimulated external Ca2+ influx. Because the mobilizable internal Ca2+ stores in plants are probably vast (1Sanders D. Brownlee C. Harper J.F. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 691-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar), it was conceivable that restoration of the externally derived Ca2+ pulses following long term removal of external Ca2+ was due to the release of enough Ca2+ from internal pools to replenish the extracellular medium. To explore this possibility, we monitored Ca2+levels in the extracellular medium after addition of 9 mmEGTA. However, no significant replenishment of external Ca2+ could be detected, even following 2 h of EGTA application (data not shown). Furthermore, addition of an extra 9 mm EGTA to cells that had already been incubated in EGTA for 20 min did not prevent activation of the restored cold shock-stimulated Ca2+ peak (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the return of responsiveness to stimulants of external Ca2+ entry is not due to restoration of external Ca2+. Additionally, the revived Ca2+ influx also does not appear to derive from the previously characterized caffeine-sensitive internal Ca2+ pool. As shown in Fig.5 E, caffeine injected into the cuvette 20 min after EGTA treatment does not prevent a cold shock-stimulated Ca2+flux. Thus, it appears that long term removal of external Ca2+ results in the sequestration of Ca2+ into a third compartment that is EGTA-inaccessible and caffeine-insensitive, and which releases Ca2+ into the cytosol in response to stimuli that normally activate externally derived influx in Ca2+-bathed cells. Finally, to demonstrate that the Ca2+ released from internal stores after the depletion of external Ca2+ might be responsible for filling this new compartment, signaling modulators that were previously found to block the EGTA-activated release of intracellular Ca2+ were again tested for their abilities to prevent the filling of this EGTA-inaccessible Ca2+ store. As shown in Fig. 6, K252a (and staurosporine; data not shown) also prevents the restoration of the cold shock-activated Ca2+ pulse (Fig. 6). Importantly, these modulators do not affect the cold shock-induced Ca2+pulse either when added to Ca2+-bathed (control) cells, or when administered to Ca2+-depleted cells that have been exposed to EGTA for sufficient time to permit filling of the EGTA-inaccessible compartment (data not shown). These observations suggest that gating of Ca2+ from neither the apoplastic space nor the unidentified compartment is altered by the kinase inhibitors. Rather, it would appear that a kinase-dependent pathway must mediate some step in communicating the depletion of external Ca2+ stores to the machinery involved in filling an EGTA-inaccessible Ca2+ pool at the expense of the more prominent intracellular Ca2+ store. We have presented data to suggest that a change in the Ca2+ content of an extracellular Ca2+ store can be rapidly communicated to an intracellular compartment that responds by releasing Ca2+ into the cytosol (Fig. 2). If a stress-related signal to discharge Ca2+ is received by the internal organelle soon after removal of the external Ca2+, the magnitude of Ca2+ release is heightened (Fig.1 A). If, in contrast, the signal to discharge Ca2+ arrives after the store of organellar Ca2+has already been depleted, no further release of the cation is noted (Fig. 3 C). Thus, some type of mechanism for sensing extracellular Ca2+ appears to modulate the behavior of a major intracellular Ca2+ storage compartment. In view of previous data demonstrating communication from the intracellular Ca2+ pool to the extracellular Ca2+ store (7Cessna S.G. Chandra S. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27286-27291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we conclude that these two Ca2+ compartments are well aware of the Ca2+ status of the other. A question obviously arises regarding the function of the above communication, and more specifically, how the active release of intracellular Ca2+ upon depletion of extracellular Ca2+ might benefit the cell. Although many plausible explanations might be offered, we suggest that different Ca2+ compartments in the cell might have different signaling functions (1Sanders D. Brownlee C. Harper J.F. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 691-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 11Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar). As a consequence, uncompensated emptying of one compartment could conceivably eliminate an entire group of signaling pathways essential for plant survival. Sharing of Ca2+ reserves from a filled compartment to an empty compartment would avoid this potential dysfunction. In this scenario, the release of intracellular Ca2+ upon removal of the external Ca2+ could have evolved to allow replenishing of the depleted extracellular stores or their substitutes. Because our Ca2+ depletion studies were conducted in the presence of sufficient EGTA to prevent resupply of extracellular stores, we were unable to evaluate whether the external Ca2+ pool might normally be replenished by the above mechanism. We did observe, however, that in the presence of excess apoplastic chelating capacity, a new Ca2+ compartment was formed that could substitute for extracellular Ca2+ in transducing cold shock and hypo-osmotic stress-induced signals. This new Ca2+ pool was not in the culture medium, since it could neither be detected by Ca2+ indicator dyes nor depleted by treatment with additional EGTA. It was also not likely associated with the primary intracellular store, since it was still functional after this caffeine- and elicitor-responsive store had been emptied. Although we currently have no information on the identity of this new compartment, we hypothesize that it may reside in an internal organelle located near the signaling machinery that triggers entry of extracellular Ca2+. In this way, it could readily substitute for the depleted extracellular Ca2+ in mediating cold shock and hypo-osmotic stress signals to the nucleus. Because release of intracellular Ca2+ in response to chelation of extracellular Ca2+ is so immediate, we suspect that the putative Ca2+ sensor is extracellular. As such, it is conceivable that the sensor might be homologous to animal CaRs, which are G-protein-coupled receptors that signal in response to elevated serum [Ca2+] via phospholipase C and inositol trisphosphate (14Yamaguchi T. Chattopadhyay N. Brown E.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 47: 209-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In fact, the Arabidopsis genome contains several open reading frames with substantial homology to the animal CaRs (e.g. emb CAB63012.1). The function of these proteins in plants has, unfortunately, not yet been elucidated. However, because the EGTA-induced Ca2+ fluxes in tobacco cells are insensitive to inhibitors of phospholipase C (i.e. neomycin sulfate and U73122; data not shown), but are inhibited by modulators of anion channels and kinases (Fig. 4), it appears that the Ca2+ sensor in our studies must differ at least in its downstream effector components from the animal CaRs (14Yamaguchi T. Chattopadhyay N. Brown E.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 47: 209-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). An alternative possibility is that the plant extracellular Ca2+ sensor involves the cell wall itself. He and colleagues (22He Z.H. Fujiki M. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19789-19793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) have recently identified a family of transmembrane cell wall-integrated receptor-like protein kinases, the extracellular domains of which interact with the pectic portion of the cell wall in tobacco. Because pectin is known to bind large amounts of Ca2+ and to dramatically change conformation upon Ca2+ removal (23Tibbits W.C. MacDougal A.J. Ring S.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 310: 101-107Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Fleischer A. O'Neill M.A. Ehwald R. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), it is possible that Ca2+-regulated changes in cell wall-kinase interactions could also initiate the signaling cascade leading to release of organellar Ca2+.
