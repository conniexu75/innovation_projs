https://openalex.org/W1543967583,"Two proteins serving as substrates for ADP-ribosylation catalyzed by islet-activating protein (IAP), pertussis toxin, and binding guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) with high affinities were purified from the cholate extract of rat brain membranes. The purified proteins had the same heterotrimeric structure (alpha beta gamma) as the IAP substrates previously purified from rabbit liver and bovine brain and differed from each other in alpha only; the molecular weight of alpha was 41,000 (alpha 41 beta gamma) and 39,000 (alpha 39 beta gamma). Both were further resolved into alpha (alpha 41 or alpha 39) and beta gamma which were also purified to homogeneity to compare the activities of alpha-monomers with the original trimers. The maintenance of the rigid trimeric structure by combining alpha 41 or alpha 39 with beta gamma in the absence of Mg2+ was essential for the alpha-subunit to be ADP-ribosylated by IAP. The alpha-subunit was very stable but displayed the only partial GTP gamma S-binding activity under these conditions. Isolated alpha-monomers exhibited high GTPase activities when assayed in the presence of submicromolar Mg2+ but were very unstable at 30 degrees C and not ADP-ribosylated by IAP. The most favorable conditions for the GTP gamma S binding to alpha-subunits were achieved by combining alpha 41 or alpha 39 with beta gamma in the presence of millimolar Mg2+, probably due to the increase in stability and unmasking of the GTP-binding sites. There was no qualitative difference in these properties between alpha 41 beta gamma (alpha 41) and alpha 39 beta gamma (alpha 39). But alpha 39 beta gamma (or alpha 39) was usually more active than alpha 41 beta gamma (or alpha 41), at least partly due to its higher affinity for Mg2+ and lower affinity for beta gamma. Relation of these differences in activity between alpha 41 beta gamma and alpha 39 beta gamma to their physiological roles in signal transduction is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1494977501,"Bis(3,5-dibromosalicyl) fumarate and a number of related bifunctional reagents react preferentially with oxyhemoglobin to cross-link the beta chains within the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate-binding site. In this report we describe a new derivative cross-linked between the alpha chains which is formed specifically in the reaction with deoxyhemoglobin. X-ray crystallographic studies show that the cross-link lies between Lys-99 alpha 1 and Lys-99 alpha 2, spanning the central cavity of the tetramer. Lys-99 alpha 1 and Lys-99 alpha 2 are located within a cluster of charged residues very near the middle of the hemoglobin molecule. In oxyhemoglobin, this site is completely inaccessible to the cross-linking agent. Competition experiments with inositol hexaphosphate indicate that the compound enters the central cavity in deoxyhemoglobin through the cleft between the alpha chains. Despite the presence of the cross-link between the alpha chains, the modified hemoglobin remains highly cooperative. The Hill coefficient for HbXL99 alpha is 2.6. The oxygen affinity of the cross-linked derivative is decreased by approximately 2-fold; at pH 7.0 in the presence of 0.1 M NaCl the P50 is 13.9 mm Hg compared to 6.6 mm Hg for HbA. This difference appears to be due to relatively small changes in both KR, the association constant for binding of oxygen to the R state, and the allosteric constant L. Surprisingly, the isoelectric point of oxyHbXL99 alpha is almost identical to that of oxyHbA, whereas in the deoxy form the isoelectric point of the cross-linked derivative is decreased relative to native hemoglobin as expected due to the loss of the two positive charges of the modified amino groups. In agreement with these findings, the alkaline Bohr effect of HbXL99 alpha is decreased by more than 50%. Earlier studies argue strongly against the possibility that Lys-99 alpha is directly responsible for this large fraction of the Bohr effect in HbA. Analysis of the structure suggests that in the cross-linked derivative Glu-101 beta, which is in close proximity to Lys-99 alpha in oxyhemoglobin, becomes an acid Bohr group."
https://openalex.org/W1573008064,"12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatment of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells resulted in an increased incorporation of 32Pi and [methyl-3H]choline into choline-containing phosphoglycerides (PC). In pulse-chase experiments, TPA treatment caused an increased release of [methyl-3H]choline from the PC fraction of prelabeled cells. When cells were prelabeled with [3H]arachidonic acid and [14C]palmitic acid, TPA treatment resulted in an increased synthesis of 14C, 3H-diglycerides. Further studies were done to determine the relationship between PC breakdown and diglyceride synthesis. Cells were preincubated with ether-linked 1-O-[3H]hexadecyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine which was acylated to form 1-O-[3H]hexadecyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. Subsequent treatment of these cells with TPA resulted in an increased synthesis of 1-O-[3H]hexadecyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerol compared to cells not stimulated with TPA. These findings demonstrate that TPA stimulates PC turnover in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and provide evidence for a novel mechanism of diglyceride formation."
https://openalex.org/W1545524757,"We report the production, purification, characterization, and partial amino acid sequence of a plasminogen inhibitor (PA-I). The starting material is culture fluid from phorbol myristate 13-acetate-treated U-937 cells and the isolation steps consist of preparative isoelectric focusing followed by affinity chromatography on Cibacron Blue-Sepharose. PA-I migrates as a closely spaced doublet of 47-kDa in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and forms covalent complexes with urokinase and two-chain tissue-type plasminogen activator, displaying second order rate constants of 0.9 X 10(6) M-1 s-1 and 0.2 X 10(6) M-1 s-1, respectively. Upon treatment with 1 M NH4OH, the covalent complexes were hydrolyzed, yielding a 35-kDa inhibitor fragment. A partial amino acid sequence of PA-I showed that it belongs to the antithrombin III family of inhibitors. PA-I is immunologically related to a PA-inhibitor from human placenta. mRNA from phorbol myristate 13-acetate-treated U-937 cells directed, in a rabbit reticulocyte derived cell-free system, the biosynthesis of only one 47-kDa protein that could be immunoprecipitated with anti-PA-I IgG, indicating that the two molecular forms of PA-I are the products of post-translational processing."
https://openalex.org/W1978346008,"We describe a recessive, maternal-effect lethal mutation of Drosophila, gnu. gnu uncouples nuclear division from many cytoplasmic events of mitosis in the Drosophila embryo. Embryos from homozygous females are defective in nuclear division, but not in DNA replication, and therefore develop a small number of giant nuclei. Centrosomes divide independently of nuclear division and migrate to the surface of the syncytial blastoderm. There they nucleate microtubules into asters, which appear normal at first but become very large. Only later, when the giant nuclei begin to break down, are spindles sometimes formed. The cortical actin of these embryos develops into a characteristic network."
https://openalex.org/W1680438956,"We have previously demonstrated that plasminogen immobilized on various surfaces forms a substrate for efficient conversion to plasmin by tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) (Silverstein, R. L., Nachman, R. L., Leung, L. L. K., and Harpel, R. C. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 10346-10352). We now report the binding of human plasminogen to the extracellular matrix synthesized in vitro by cultured endothelial cell monolayers. The binding was specific, saturable at plasma plasminogen concentrations, reversible, and lysine-binding site-dependent. Functional studies demonstrated that matrix immobilized plasminogen was a much better substrate for t-PA than was fluid phase plasminogen as shown by a 100-fold decrease in Km. Activation of plasminogen by t-PA and urokinase on the matrix was equally efficient. The plasmin generated on the matrix, in marked contrast to fluid phase, was protected from its fast-acting inhibitor, alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor. Matrix-associated plasmin converted bound Glu- into Lys-plasminogen, which in turn is more rapidly activated to plasmin by t-PA. The extracellular matrix not only binds and localizes plasminogen but also improves plasminogen activation kinetics and prolongs plasmin activity in the subendothelial microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W1550046238,"Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to study protein phosphorylation in granules, membranes, and soluble fractions from human neutrophils that had been loaded with 32Pi. In resting cells, label was incorporated primarily into proteins of the membranes and the soluble supernatant; little appeared in the granules. Activation of 32P-loaded neutrophils resulted in an increase in the 32P content of a small number of membrane and soluble proteins without a change in the labeling of the granule fraction. The identity of the proteins affected by activation depended on the activating agent used; all of the activating agents, however, caused an increase in the labeling of a group of approximately 48-kDa proteins that appeared to be distributed between the membranes and the soluble supernatant. To investigate the role of phosphorylation in the activation of the respiratory burst oxidase, the incorporation of 32P into phosphoproteins was studied in neutrophils from patients with chronic granulomatous disease. When these cells were exposed to phorbol myristate acetate, one of the agents used for the activation of normal neutrophils, the 48-kDa proteins in the membranes and supernatants failed to take up additional 32P. Phosphorylation patterns in normal neutrophils activated under nitrogen were similar to the patterns seen with cells activated in air, suggesting that the differences in phosphorylation between normal and chronic granulomatous disease neutrophils did not represent secondary effects of the oxidants produced by the normal cells, but reflected primary biochemical differences between the normal and the defective phagocytes. We postulate from these results that the uptake of phosphate by the 48-kDa protein group may be involved in the activation of the respiratory burst oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1604131522,"We have isolated a cDNA clone for an interferon-induced 15-kDa protein. The cDNA clone was prepared from mRNA isolated from interferon-beta-treated human Daudi cells. The clone of 635 base pairs contains an open reading frame coding for a protein of 145 amino acids, and suggests for the mRNA a 75-base pair 5‘ untranslated and a 125-base pair 3‘ untranslated region. Approximately 85% of the amino acid sequence of the 15-kDa protein has been independently obtained from 2 nmol of material using microsequencing technology on the N terminus of the intact protein and on tryptic and chymotryptic peptides. The amino acid sequence of the isolated protein is identical to the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA. Northern blot analysis confirmed that the mRNA for the 15-kDa protein is undetectable in untreated cells, but is greatly induced following interferon treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1585071604,"Cultured human articular and costal chondrocytes were used as a model system to examine the effects of recombinant gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) on synthesis of procollagens, the steady state levels of types I and II procollagen mRNAs, and the expression of major histocompatibility complex class II (Ia-like) antigens on the cell surface. Adult articular chondrocytes synthesized mainly type II collagen during weeks 1-3 of primary culture, whereas types I and III collagens were also produced after longer incubation and predominated after the first subculture. Juvenile costal chondrocytes synthesized no detectable alpha 2(I) collagen chains until after week 1 of primary culture; type II collagen was the predominant species even after weeks of culture. The relative amounts of types I and II collagens synthesized were reflected in the levels of alpha 1(I), alpha 2(I), and alpha 1(II) procollagen mRNAs. In articular chondrocytes, the levels of alpha 1(I) procollagen mRNA were disproportionately low (alpha 1(I)/alpha 2(I) less than 1.0) compared with costal chondrocytes (alpha 1 (I)/alpha 2(I) approximately 2). Recombinant IFN-gamma (0.1-100 units/ml) inhibited synthesis of type II as well as types I and III collagens associated with suppression of the levels of alpha 1(I), alpha 2(I), and alpha 1(II) procollagen mRNAs. IFN-gamma suppressed the levels of alpha 1(I) and alpha 1(II) procollagen mRNAs to a greater extent than alpha 2(I) procollagen mRNA in articular but not in costal chondrocytes. Human leukocyte interferon (IFN-alpha) at 1000 units/ml suppressed collagen synthesis and procollagen mRNA levels to a similar extent as IFN-gamma at 1.0 unit/ml. In addition, IFN-gamma but not IFN-alpha induced the expression of HLA-DR antigens on intact cells. The lymphokine IFN-gamma could, therefore, have a role in suppressing cartilage matrix synthesis in vivo under conditions in which the chondrocytes are in proximity to T lymphocytes and their products."
https://openalex.org/W1538907743,"Abstract Monoclonal antibodies against the membrane domain of human red blood cell band 3 protein have been prepared and used in topographical studies of the arrangement of the polypeptide in the membrane. One of the antibodies binds to a site near the N terminus of the membrane domain; another binds to a site near the C terminus. The latter has been used to localize a site of intracellular trypsin digestion. The cleavage site, in human band 3, corresponds to Lys-761 in mouse band 3; the site is 168 residues from the C terminus of the protein. This is the first intracellular site in the membrane domain (other than the N terminus) that has been localized in the primary structure. The antibody that binds to the N-terminal portion of the membrane domain has been used to identify a new S-cyanylation cleavage site about 7,000 daltons from the C terminus. Proteolysis/cross-linking experiments with the stilbenedisulfonate derivative H2DIDS (4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate) reveal that one end of the H2DIDS reacts covalently with a lysine residue that is between about 70 and 168 residues from the C terminus of band 3. In addition to placing restrictions on the location of the H2DIDS-binding lysine, these studies provide direct evidence that the C-terminal 28,000-dalton papain fragment crosses the membrane at least three times. With previous data on the remainder of the membrane domain, there is now direct evidence that the band 3 polypeptide crosses the membrane at least eight times."
https://openalex.org/W1633238288,"Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) is associated with microtubule preparations and phosphorylates several endogenous proteins including microtubule-associated protein 2, tubulin, and an 80,000-dalton protein doublet (pp80). We now report that pp80 is identical to synapsin I by all criteria studied including molecular weight, isoelectric point, phosphopeptide mapping of cAMP- and calmodulin-dependent phosphorylated protein, comigration with authentic synapsin I, and sensitivity to digestion with collagenase. Synapsin I and CaM kinase II were found in association with both microtubule preparations and preparations enriched in neurofilaments. Antibodies to synapsin I specifically labeled neurofilaments prepared in vitro. Immunocytochemical studies on rat brain tissue demonstrated synapsin I immunoreactivity specifically associated with the neuronal cytoskeleton as well as synaptic vesicles. The observed synapsin I staining on cytoskeletal elements was considerably diminished or abolished by the inclusion of Triton X-100 in the staining solutions. These results indicate that synapsin I is associated with the cytoskeleton and may be an important link between cytoskeletal elements as well as between the cytoskeleton and membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1483428322,"Among the earliest responses to mitogens that have been detected in normal quiescent cells are ionic changes: we have described rapid increases in the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca]i) and in the intracellular pH (pHi) in mitogen-stimulated thymocytes and fibroblasts (Hesketh, T. R., Moore, J. P., Morris, J. D. H., Taylor, M. V., Rogers, J., Smith, G. A., and Metcalfe, J. C. (1985) Nature 313, 482-484). Here we investigate the relationship between these ionic signals and the subsequent expression of the c-fos and c-myc proto-oncogenes in murine thymocytes. We show that the plant lectin concanavalin A (ConA), the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and the Ca2+-ionophore A23187 each causes a rapid increase in both c-fos and c-myc mRNAs. The activation of both genes is completely dependent on the extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca]o) for A23187 and independent of [Ca]o for TPA. Activation of c-myc, but not c-fos, by ConA is partially dependent on [Ca]o. The pHi increases generated by ConA or TPA are not necessary for expression of mRNA from either gene in response to these mitogens. Exogenous 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (but not 8-bromo-cyclic GMP) inhibits the c-myc responses to ConA and TPA. The data also show that neither early c-fos nor c-myc expression is sufficient to commit the cells to DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1570560342,"Monophosphoryl lipid A (MLA) obtained from the lipopolysaccharides of serum-sensitive strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae was fractionated on a silicic acid column to yield the hexaacyl and pentaacyl MLAs. The dimethyl derivative of the hexaacyl MLA was analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The dimethyl esters of hexaacyl and pentaacyl MLAs were further purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and all of the peaks were analyzed by laser desorption mass spectrometry. Considerable structural information was obtained by laser desorption mass spectrometry due to three kinds of specific fragmentations of the sugar at the reducing end. Two major fractions were also analyzed by positive ion fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. High performance liquid chromatography was able to separate the dimethyl MLA according to number, nature, and position of the fatty acyl groups. Since almost no structural information is available, the mass spectra of the samples were interpreted on the basis of the established structure of a model lipid A (hexaacyl MLA derived from Salmonella minnesota). Thirteen different structures of dimethyl MLA were identified. The four prominent dimethyl MLAs found in the fractionated samples were M1 (Mr = 1463), M2 (Mr = 1479), M3 (Mr = 1661), and M4 (Mr = 1677). These MLAs appear to have a 1'----6 linked glucosamine disaccharide backbone. The most prominent hexaacyl MLA was M3. We propose that it contains hydroxylaurate at the 3- and 3'-positions in ester linkage and lauroxymyristate at the 2- and 2'-positions in amide linkage of the glucosamine disaccharide. The most abundant pentacyl MLA was M2. We propose that it contains hydroxylaurate at the 3- and 3'-positions in ester linkage, lauroxymyristate at the 2'-position in amide linkage, and hydroxymyristate at the 2-position in amide linkage of the disaccharide. The lipid A of N. gonorrhoeae appeared to differ from that of the Salmonella strains by the presence of shorter-chain fatty acids and by the normal fatty acid distribution in the reducing and distal subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1527067333,"Neutrophils loaded with the calcium indicator quin-2 and challenged with the ionophore ionomycin or the chemotactic peptide fMet-Leu-Phe were examined in the light of a theory that relates time-dependent changes in the fluorescence of the indicator to cytosolic calcium fluxes and levels. The cytosolic binding capacity was estimated from the theory to be 1.5 +/- 0.6 X 10(8) sites/cell (0.76 mM based on a cell volume of 330 micron 3, irrespective of water content and the distribution of sites), each site having an apparent average single class dissociation constant of 0.55 +/- 0.2 microM. Some 20% of the total available cytosolic calcium sites of the normal resting cell appear to be occupied when no quin-2 is present. In a calcium-free medium, the amount of calcium released by fMet-Leu-Phe from storage pool locations that are distinct from the cytosolic sites is sufficient to further raise the cytosolic site occupancy level to 50%, at which point the calcium buffering capacity of the cytosol is maximal. In a calcium-containing medium, however, simultaneous influx from the outside appears to supply enough additional calcium to saturate most of the remaining sites. The combined initial rate of storage pool calcium release plus influx through the plasma membrane was roughly twice the initial rate at which calcium was released from storage locations alone, suggesting that stimulus-induced influx from the outside may be comparable in importance to storage pool mobilization in determining physiological calcium levels in stimulated cells."
https://openalex.org/W1508608419,"Membranes of Streptococcus lactis were solubilized with 1.1% octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside in the presence of 0.37% acetone/ether-washed phospholipid from several sources. After adding excess Escherichia coli phospholipid as bath-sonicated liposomes, phosphate:sugar phosphate antiport was reconstituted in proteoliposomes by a 25-fold dilution in 0.1 M KPi (pH 7). Assays of 32Pi:Pi exchange showed that antiport was subject to an inactivation which varied in severity according to the lipid present at solubilization. Recovery of Pi-linked exchange was improved by the presence of 10-20% glycerol or other osmolyte during extraction. The osmolytes tested in this regard have included polyols (glycerol, erythritol, xylitol, sorbitol), sugars (glucose, trehalose), and two amino acids (glycine, proline). Each gave 10--20-fold increased recoveries of 32Pi:Pi antiport compared to controls using only detergent and lipid; these precautions were not required for the efficient reconstitution of F0F1-ATPase. Antiport in the artificial system was studied most carefully when glycerol was the stabilizing additive. For that case, the Kt values for Pi or 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate transport (275 and 25 microM, respectively) were the same as in native membranes. Maximal rates of Pi and 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate transport (200 and 42 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively) and the turnover number for Pi exchange (25--50/s) suggested that antiporters were recovered without loss of activity. We conclude that the quantitative aspects of bacterial anion exchange are amenable to study in an artificial system, and that the use of osmolytes as general stabilants can be a valuable adjunct to current techniques for reconstitution of integral membrane transport proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1504442241,"Murine interleukin-3 (mIL-3) is a lymphokine that stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of both pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells and their committed progeny. However, very little is known about the mechanism by which this growth factor elicits its effects on responsive cell populations. To gain insight into early events following mIL-3 receptor interaction, we initiated studies to isolate the receptor and study its properties. In this report, we demonstrate the use of a new iodinatable, cleavable, photoreactive cross-linking agent, sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(p-azidosalicylamido)-1,3'-dithiopropionate to identify the mIL-3 receptor. These studies reveal the mIL-3 receptor to be a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 67 kDa and an isoelectric point of approximately 6.2."
https://openalex.org/W1493771527,"Culture of human mammary HBL-100 cells in the presence of dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, resulted in opposite effects on the production of the two plasminogen activators (PAs): a decrease in urokinase-type PA (u-PA) and a concomitant increase in tissue-type PA (t-PA). Two PA-specific inhibitors, one related to that produced by bovine aortic endothelial cells, and the other related to that isolated from human placenta, were also produced by these cells; dexamethasone did not affect the production of either of these inhibitors. The glucocorticoid effects observed on PA enzymatic activities were associated with changes in PA mRNA levels. Experiments using inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis suggested that the glucocorticoid-induced decrease in u-PA mRNA was a secondary event, requiring synthesis of new regulatory proteins; in contrast, the increase in t-PA mRNA appeared to be a direct effect on t-PA gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1493907936,"Bacillus subtilis subtilisin is predicted to be synthesized as a preproenzyme according to the sequence analysis of its gene. We have synthesized the [35S] methionine-labeled preprosubtilisin in vitro and processed the precursor to prosubtilisin by the addition of membrane vesicles derived from vegetative cells of B. subtilis and Triton X-100. Radiosequencing of the prosubtilisin allowed the precise determination of the signal peptidase cleavage site. The preprosubtilisin was found to have a 29-amino-acid-long signal peptide with the signal peptidase cleavage sequence of AlaGln-AlaAla. Fusion of the signal peptide sequence to the mature TEM beta-lactamase structural gene allowed the production of an active and secreted form of beta-lactamase in vivo. An N-terminal sequence analysis of this product indicated that the observed in vivo signal peptidase cleavage site was exactly the same as that determined by in vitro analysis. During the development of the in vitro processing system, we demonstrated that the replacement of the subtilisin transcription regulatory sequence by a vegetative promoter allowed the vegetative expression and secretion of subtilisin. Thus, the late expression of the native subtilisin gene is mainly controlled at the transcription level and the secretion/processing systems are available for vegetative production of subtilisin."
https://openalex.org/W1551814429,"Bovine aortic endothelial cells were cultured in medium containing [3H]glucosamine and concentrations of [35S]sulfate ranging from 0.01 to 0.31 mM. While the amount of [3H]hexosamine incorporated into chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate was constant, decreasing concentrations of sulfate resulted in lower [35S]sulfate incorporation. Sulfate concentrations greater than 0.11 mM were required for maximal [35S]sulfate incorporation. Chondroitin sulfate was particularly affected so that the sulfate to hexosamine ratio in [3H]chondroitin [35S]sulfate dropped considerably more than the sulfate to hexosamine ratio in [3H] heparan [35S]sulfate. Sulfate concentration had no effect on the ratio of chondroitin 4-sulfate to chondroitin 6-sulfate. The ratios of sulfate to hexosamine in cell-associated glycosaminoglycans were essentially identical with the ratios in media glycosaminoglycans at sulfate concentrations. DEAE-cellulose chromatography confirmed that sulfation of chondroitin sulfate was particularly sensitive to low sulfate concentrations. While cells incubated in medium containing 0.31 mM sulfate produced chondroitin sulfate which eluted later than heparan sulfate, cells incubated in medium containing less than 0.04 mM sulfate produced chondroitin sulfate which eluted before heparan sulfate and near hyaluronic acid, indicating that many chains were essentially unsulfated. At intermediate concentrations of sulfate, chondroitin sulfate was found in very broad elution patterns suggesting that most did not fit an all or nothing mechanism. Heparan sulfate produced at low concentrations of sulfate eluted with narrower elution patterns than chondroitin sulfate, and there was no indication of any all or nothing sulfation."
https://openalex.org/W1509351410,"A soluble high affinity binding unit for leukotriene (LT) C4 in the high speed supernatant of rat liver homogenate was characterized at 4 degrees C as having a single type of saturable affinity site with a dissociation constant of 0.77 +/- 0.27 nM (mean +/- S.E., n = 5). The binding activity was identified as the liver cytosolic subunit 1 (Ya) of glutathione S-transferase, commonly known as ligandin, by co-purification with the catalytic activity during DEAE-cellulose column chromatography and 11,12,14,15-tetrahydro-LTC4 (LTC2)-affinity gel column chromatography; resolution into two major bands by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of Mr 23,000 and 25,000, of which only the smaller protein was labeled with [3H]LTC4 coupled via a photoaffinity cross-linking reagent; and immunodiffusion analysis with rabbit antiserum to glutathione S-transferase which showed a line of identity between the purified LTC4-binding protein and rat liver glutathione S-transferase. The affinity-purified binding protein bound 800 pmol of [3H] LTC4/mg of protein and possessed 12 mumol/min/mg of glutathione transferase activity as assayed with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as substrate. The enzyme activity of the cytosolic LTC4-binding protein was inhibited by submicromolar quantities of unlabeled LTC4, and the binding activity for [3H]LTC4 was blocked by the ligandin substrates, hematin and bilirubin. The high affinity interaction between LTC4 and glutathione S-transferase suggests that glutathione S-transferase may have a role in LTC4 disposition and that previous studies of LTC4 binding to putative receptors in nonresponsive tissues may require redefinition of the binding unit."
https://openalex.org/W1484235975,"A tritium suicide procedure was devised to facilitate the isolation of Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants defective in phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis. One mutant with a 20-50% reduction in [3H]ethanolamine incorporation was chosen for further analysis and was shown to have reduced activity of CTP: phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase. Levels of phosphatidylethanolamine and rates of its biosynthesis were compared in the mutant and parent cell lines. Despite the reduced activity of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway in the mutant, levels of phosphatidylethanolamine were the same in mutant and parent cells. Rates of phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis de novo, as measured by incorporation of 32PO4 into phosphatidylethanolamine, were also the same in mutant and parent cells, as was the rate of incorporation of [3H]serine into both phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine. After a long term labeling with [3H]serine, the specific radioactivity of phosphatidylserine was the same as that of phosphatidylethanolamine, and there was no difference in the specific radioactivities of the two lipids between mutant and parent cells. These results implicate decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine as the sole route for synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine under normal culture conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1579909161,"Parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation of the embryonic chick heart proceed non-coordinately. beta-Adrenergic agonists mediate an increase in beating rate in embryonic chick heart prior to ingrowth of the vagus nerve (Culver, N. G., and Fishman, D. A. (1977) Am. J. Physiol. 232, R116-R123) while muscarinic agonists exert relatively little effect on beating rate in hearts 2-4 days in ovo (Papanno, A. J. (1979) Pharmacol. Rev. 29, 3-33). Studies of developmental changes in the ability of muscarinic agonists to inhibit adenylate cyclase activity and their relationship to the development of a physiologic response of the embryonic chick heart to muscarinic stimulation have been inconclusive. In the current studies the ability of isoproterenol to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity did not change during development. Maximum stimulation above basal was 760 pmol of cAMP/10 min/mg of proterin with an IC50 of 1.5 X 10(-6) M for isoproterenol in homogenates of hearts 2 1/2, 3 1/2, and 10 days in ovo and 3 days posthatching. However, inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity by carbamylcholine increased from 7.6% with a IC50 for carbamylcholine of 16 +/- 5.0 microM at day 2 1/2 in ovo to 29% with an IC50 of 0.4 +/- 0.1 microM at day 10 in ovo and to 43% with a IC50 of 0.6 +/- 0.1 microM at 3 days posthatching. Since previous data had demonstrated the presence of muscarinic receptors as early as 2 1/2 days in ovo (Galper, J. B., Klein, W., and Catterall, W. A. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 8692-8699), studies of developmental changes in guanine nucleotide-coupling proteins were carried out to determine whether early in development muscarinic receptors were uncoupled from a physiologic response. Studies of pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of homogenates of embryonic chick heart with [32P]NAD demonstrated the presence of two ADP-ribosylated proteins at 39,000 and 41,000 kDa, respectively. Both ADP-ribosylation and immunoblotting of homogenates with an antibody to the 39-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding protein in bovine brain demonstrated that the 39-kDa alpha protein increased 1.8-fold between days 2 1/2 and 3 1/2 in ovo and another 1.8-fold from day 3 1/2 to 10 in ovo in parallel with the increase in the extent of muscarinic inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1608628591,"Purified recombinant human interferon-gamma, produced in Escherichia coli, was digested with trypsin under mild conditions, resulting in a preparation containing approximately 90% of a Mr = 15,800 protein and 10% of a 14,400 protein. The Mr = 15,800 protein has an intact N terminus and the Mr = 14,400 protein lacks 14 N-terminal residues. Both proteins lack C terminus of approximately 13 residues. This preparation containing the Mr = 15,800 and 14,400 proteins was identical with the intact protein with respect to conformation and dimerization, as analyzed by circular dichroism and gel filtration. However, the antiviral activity of this preparation was 1000-fold lower than that of the intact molecule. Since the majority of this preparation is the Mr = 15,800 protein, these results suggest that the C terminus does not affect the protein conformation and self-association, but greatly alters antiviral activity."
https://openalex.org/W1485271133,"Chemical modification of spinach ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase by diethyl pyrocarbonate led to the conclusion that His-298 is an essential active-site residue (Igarashi, Y., McFadden, B. A., and El-Gul, T. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 3957-3962). From the pH dependence of inactivation, the pKa of His-298 was observed to be approximately 6.8, and it was suggested that this histidine might be the essential base that initiates catalysis (Paech, C. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 3194-3199). To explore further the possible function of His-298, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to replace the corresponding residue of the Rhodospirillum rubrum carboxylase (His-291) with alanine. Assays of extracts of Escherichia coli JM107, harboring either the wild-type or mutant gene in an expression vector, revealed that the mutant protein is approximately 40% as active catalytically as the normal carboxylase. After purification to near homogeneity by immunoaffinity chromatography, the mutant protein was partially characterized with respect to subunit structure, kinetic parameters, and interaction with a transition-state analogue. The purified mutant carboxylase had a kcat of 1.5 s-1 and a kcat/Km of 1.7 X 10(4) M-1 s-1 in contrast to values of 3.6 s-1 and 6 X 10(5) M-1 s-1 for the normal enzyme. The high level of enzyme activity exhibited by the Ala-291 mutant excludes His-291 in the R. rubrum carboxylase (and by inference His-298 in the spinach carboxylase) as a catalytically essential residue."
https://openalex.org/W127240333,"We report here a procedure which results in the purification of an extracellular protease (designated Ps-1) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This enzyme cleaves fibrinogen so that the modified molecules form microcrystals and large single crystals. Precise knowledge of the Ps-1 cleavage sites is essential for the interpretation of the structural information provided by these crystals (Weisel, J. W., Stauffacher, C. V., Bullitt, E., and Cohen, C. (1985) Science 230, 1388-1391). Ps-1 is a single-chain polypeptide of Mr 30,000 which appears to function as a monomer. The pH optimum is 8-9. The activity of the protease is not decreased by inhibitors of thiol, carboxyl, or metallo proteases; the abolishment of activity by N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone and the partial inhibition obtained with serine-reactive inhibitors suggests that Ps-1 may be a serine protease with an unusual active-site conformation. Studies with synthetic peptide substrates show that Ps-1 exhibits one of the most restricted specificities known for an endoproteinase: only peptide, ester, and amide bonds containing the carbonyl group of lysine are hydrolyzed. The limited specificity of Ps-1 should make it useful for other applications requiring the selective cleavage of proteins, such as sequence analysis and the isolation of domains."
https://openalex.org/W1676679464,"Human acid beta-glucosidase (glucosylceramidase; EC 3.2.1.45) cleaves the glycosidic bonds of glucosyl ceramide and synthetic beta-glucosides. Conduritol B epoxide (CBE) and its brominated derivative are mechanism-based inhibitors which bind covalently to the catalytic site of acid beta-glucosidase. Procedures using brominetritiated CBE and monospecific anti-human placental acid beta-glucosidase IgG were developed to determine the molar concentrations of functional acid beta-glucosidase catalytic sites in pure placental enzyme preparations from normal sources; kcat values then were calculated from Vmax = [Et]kcat using glucosyl ceramide substrates with dodecanoyl (2135 +/- 45 min-1) and hexanoyl (3200 +/- 410 min-1) fatty acid acyl chains and 4-alkyl-umbelliferyl beta-glucoside substrates with methyl (2235 +/- 197 min-1), heptyl (1972 +/- 152 min-1), nonyl (2220 +/- 247 min-1), and undecyl (773 +/- 44 min-1) alkyl chains. The respective kcat values for acid beta-glucosidase in a crude normal splenic preparation were about 60% of these values. In comparison, the kcat values of the mutant splenic acid beta-glucosidase from two Type 1 Ashkenazi Jewish Gaucher disease (AJGD) patients were about 1.5-3-fold decreased and had Km values for each substrate which were similar to those for the normal acid beta-glucosidase. The interaction of the normal and Type 1 AJGD enzymes with CBE in a 1:1 stoichiometry conformed to a model with reversible EI complexes formed prior to covalent inactivation. With CBE, the equal kmax values (maximal rate of inactivation) for the normal (0.051 +/- 0.009 min-1) and Type 1 AJGD (0.058 +/- 0.016 min-1) enzymes were consistent with the minor differences in kcat. In contrast, the Ki value (dissociation constant) (839 +/- 64 microM) for the Type 1 AJGD enzymes was about 5 times the normal Ki value (166 +/- 57 microM). These results indicated that the catalytically active Type 1 AJGD acid beta-glucosidase had nearly normal hydrolytic capacity and suggested an amino acid substitution in or near the acid beta-glucosidase active site leading to an in vivo instability of the mutant enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2030701927,"Remarkable similarities in the intracellular and genetic events occur when lymphoid and hematopoietic cells are exposed to their specific growth factors. The interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor, whose cell-surface expression is an absolute requirement for the growth and differentiation of lymphoid cells, was detected on various nonlymphoid hematopoietic cell types in this study. Cell lines consisting either of granulocyte-macrophage precursors or mast cells, which are dependent on interleukin-3 (IL-3) for their growth, expressed high levels of the IL-2 receptor on their surface. Analysis of the binding characteristics of these receptors with 125I-labeled recombinant IL-2 revealed that only receptors with low affinity for IL-2 were present on these cells. Addition of purified recombinant IL-3 to these cell lines led to an increase in IL-2 receptor gene expression within 1 hour in isolated nuclei. This IL-3--induced increase in the number of IL-2 receptors on the cell surface is maximal within 24 hours. Addition of 10,000 units of IL-2 to these cells had no apparent effect on their growth or differentiation. The presence of the receptor with only low affinity for IL-2 on hematopoietic cells and the regulation by IL-3 suggest that this receptor is involved in some important metabolic event in hematopoiesis."

Bacterial strains carrying the recombinant plasmid pIP35 overproduced the regulatory protein by a factor of 200 over the wild type strain as determined by the immunoblot technique. The purified metJ gene product negatively controls the expression of the metF gene, in a cell-free system as shown by repression of beta-galactosidase synthesis under the control of the metF promoter. The metJ protein binds to a DNA fragment containing the potential operator of the metF gene with an affinity which is 10 times greater in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine than in its absence. Equilibrium dialysis experiments showed that the met aporepressor binds 2 mol of S-adenosylmethionine per mol of dimer with a dissociation constant of 200 microM."
https://openalex.org/W1549689418,"Hind leg muscles of female rats (85-99 g) were unloaded by tail cast suspension for 6 days. In the fresh-frozen unloaded soleus, the significantly greater concentration of glycogen correlated with a lower activity ratio of glycogen phosphorylase (p less than 0.02). The activity ratio of glycogen synthase also was lower (p less than 0.001), possibly due to the higher concentration of glycogen. In isolated unloaded soleus, insulin (0.1 milliunit/ml) increased the oxidation of D-[U-14C]glucose, release of lactate and pyruvate, incorporation of D-[U-14C]glucose into glycogen, and the concentration of glucose 6-phosphate more (p less than 0.05) than in the weight-bearing soleus. At physiological doses of insulin, the percent of maximal uptake of 2-deoxy-D-[1,2-3H]glucose/muscle also was greater in the unloaded soleus. Unloading of the soleus increased by 50% the concentration of insulin receptors, due to no decrease in total receptor number during muscle atrophy. This increase may account for the greater response of glucose metabolism to insulin in this muscle. The extensor digitorum longus, which generally shows little response to unloading, displayed no differential response of glucose metabolism to insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1578578152,"We have recently proposed that glucocorticoids induce cytochrome P-450p, a liver microsomal hemoprotein originally isolated from rats treated with the antiglucocorticoid pregnenolone 16 alpha-carbonitrile (PCN), through a mechanism that involves a stereospecific recognition system clearly distinguishable from the classic glucocorticoid receptor (Schuetz, E. G., Wrighton, S. A., Barwick, J. L., and Guzelian, P. S. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 1999-2012). We now report that digitoxigenin monodigitoxoside UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (DIG UDP-glucuronosyltransferase), a liver microsomal enzyme activity induced by PCN in rats, is also inducible, as is P-450p, in primary monolayer cultures of adult rat hepatocytes. DIG UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity closely resembled reported characteristics of induction of P-450p in its time course of induction, concentration-response relationships, exclusivity of induction by steroids with glucocorticoid properties, unusual rank order of potency of glucocorticoid agonists, unusually high ED50 for induction by glucocorticoids, enhanced induction rather than inhibition by anti-glucocorticoids in the presence of glucocorticoids, and finally, induction by nonsteroidal inducers of P-450p. DIG UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity was also readily detected in human liver microsomes and was elevated in two patients who had received inducers of P-450p. We conclude that the liver enzymes controlled by the postulated PCN recognition system include not only P-450p but also one or more UDP-glucuronosyltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W2025352682,"Allogeneic gene products of the major histocompatibility complex, the HLA complex in man and the H-2 complex in mice, induce T lymphocytes to exert powerful mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) and cell-mediated lympholysis (CML). In mice, the subset of T cells carrying the L3T4 surface antigen but lacking the Lyt-2 antigen responds predominantly to H-2 class II (Ia) differences whereas the L3T4- Lyt-2+ subset reacts to class I (K/D) differences. For primary responses the stimulus for MLR and CML appears to be controlled by Ia+ cells of the macrophage/dendritic cell lineages, for both L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ cells. The finding that Ia+ cells are required for responses involving Lyt-2+ cells has been taken to imply that triggering of these cells is controlled by Ia-restricted L3T4+ cells. Lyt-2+ cells have thus come to be regarded as crippled cells which are heavily dependent on 'help' from other T cells. This well-entrenched view is challenged by evidence presented here that purified Lyt-2+ cells can give high primary responses to certain Ia- tumour cells in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1529514087,"The binding of EGTA and EDTA to alpha-lactalbumin, first demonstrated by Kronman and Bratcher (Kronman, M. J., and Bratcher, S. C. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 5707-5709) and afterwards regarded as a significant source of error in estimating the binding constant of Ca2+ to the protein, has been investigated by comparison of the thermal unfolding curves of the protein in the absence and presence of the chelators and also by measuring the NMR spectra of the protein, the chelators, and the protein-chelator mixtures. The unfolding curve in the presence of a large excess of each chelator has been found to be identical to that in the absence of chelator, indicating that there is essentially no interaction between the chelators and alpha-lactalbumin. The NMR results have also supported this conclusion, and the innocuous character of these chelators as metal-ion buffers in studying the Ca2+-binding properties of alpha-lactalbumin is demonstrated. In order to re-examine the binding constant for Ca2+ of alpha-lactalbumin without the aid of chelating metal-ion buffers, the thermal unfolding curve of the protein in the presence of 0.1 mM excess Ca2+ but without chelators has been compared with the unfolding curve in the absence of Ca2+ at a constant concentration of Na+ (0.010 or 0.10 M) at pH 7.0. The binding constant of alpha-lactalbumin can be calculated from the increment of melting temperature caused by the presence of Ca2+ and from the enthalpy and heat capacity changes in the unfolding. Because Ca2+ binding to the unfolded protein can be neglected under the conditions employed, the binding constant evaluated corresponds to the binding constant to protein that has native structure. The constant obtained is 3-5 X 10(9) M-1 after corrections for binding of Na+ to the protein and for ionic strength, and this shows excellent agreement with the corresponding value previously estimated (2.9 +/- 1.0 X 10(9) M-1), although the latter value was obtained in the presence of EDTA. The apparent Ca2+-binding constant that has been discussed in most previous studies, without taking account of the folding-unfolding equilibrium associated with the binding process, also depends on the concentration of monovalent cations such as Na+, and the present results lead to values of 1.5 X 10(8) and 8.7 X 10(6) M-1 at 0.01 and 0.1 M Na+, respectively."

Glyoxysomal acyl-CoA oxidase eluted from the column like hydrophobic proteins and exhibited an Mr of 150,000. An oxidase with identical properties could be prepared in large quantities by a purification procedure starting with crude extracts from cotyledons of 4-day-old etiolated seedlings. The purification procedure included chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose and hydroxylapatite and molecular sieving. 1500-fold purification led to an enzyme of apparent homogeneity characterized by a specific activity of 27 units/mg of protein. Plant acyl-CoA oxidase is a homodimer with a subunit of Mr 72,000. Monospecific antibodies raised in rabbits were used to reveal dissimilarity to the fungal oxidase. The plant enzyme also differed markedly in molecular structure and amino acid composition from the liver peroxisomal enzyme. Glyoxysomal acyl-CoA oxidase acts selectively on fatty acyl-CoAs with 16 or 18 C atoms, cis-9-unsaturated esters with a C16 or C18 acyl moiety being converted with higher rates than saturated or polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoAs. Besides the enzymatically active organellar form of acyl-CoA oxidase, the monomeric apoprotein was detected when short-term labeling of cotyledons in vivo was performed. The apoprotein (immunoprecipitable by antibodies raised against the glyoxysomal enzyme) did not differ in size from the subunit of the glyoxysomal dimeric enzyme."

MCD was used with the high molecular weight, soluble enzyme, and EPR was used with both the purified enzyme and Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase). The results of the EPR experiments of the two types of preparations agreed with each other, as well as with the data in the literature for various types of membrane-bound preparations. The two methods gave concordant results showing the presence of one binuclear and of three tetranuclear NADH-reducible iron-sulfur clusters. Earlier studies using the cluster extrusion technique indicated a higher ratio of binuclear to tetranuclear clusters which may be explained by cluster interconversion during the extrusion process."
https://openalex.org/W1668570738,"An alternative pathway C3 convertase is formed by the equilibrium association of Factor B with cobra venom factor (CVF) followed by the activation step catalyzed by Factor D. However, the association of Factor B with CVF has only occasionally been demonstrated and has not been quantitatively analyzed. Here we show that in the absence of metals the two proteins have significant affinity for each other and reversibly associate in a one-to-one stoichiometry with a dissociation constant of 11.6 microM. Upon the addition of metal ions, the complex is stabilized only 2- to 30-fold in the order Ni2+(Kd = 6.6 microM) less than Mg2+(Kd = 1.1 microM) less than Mn2+(Kd = 0.4 microM). These results suggest that metal ions may be less important in stabilizing the CVF.B complex and more important in promoting the subsequent equilibrium association of CVF.B with Factor D. The stability of the CVF.B complex is variously dependent on temperature in the range studied (14-21 degrees C) depending on the metal ion that is present. The complex formation was demonstrated in the analytical ultracentrifuge at sedimentation equilibrium employing a combination of single- and multiple-independent variable nonlinear least squares analytical techniques. Two different numerical approaches gave very similar results."
https://openalex.org/W1550751952,"The reaction catalyzed by the activating enzyme for dinitrogenase reductase from Rhodospirillum rubrum has been studied using an ADP-ribosyl hexapeptide, obtained from proteolysis of inactive dinitrogenase reductase, and synthetic analogs such as N alpha-dansyl-N omega-ADP-ribosylarginine methyl ester. The activating enzyme catalyzed N-glycohydrolysis of the ribosyl-guanidinium linkage releasing ADP-ribose and regenerating an unmodified arginyl guanidinium group. Optimal glycohydrolysis of the low molecular weight substrates occurred at pH 6.6 and required 1 mM MnCl2, but did not require ATP. The ADP-ribosyl hexapeptide (Km 11 microM), N alpha-dansyl-N omega-ADP-ribosylarginine methyl ester (Km 12 microM), N alpha-dansyl-N omega-ADP-ribosylarginine (Km 12 microM), N alpha-dansyl-N omega-1,N6-etheno-ADP-ribosylarginine methyl ester (Km 11 microM), and N alpha-dansyl-N omega-GDP-ribosylarginine methyl ester (Km 11 microM) were comparable substrates. N omega-ADP-ribosylarginine (Km 2 mM) was a poor substrate, and the activating enzyme did not catalyze N-glycohydrolysis of N alpha-dansyl-N omega-5'-phosphoribosylarginine methyl ester or N alpha-dansyl-N omega-ribosylarginine methyl ester. 13C NMR of N alpha-tosyl-N omega-ADP-ribosylarginine methyl ester established that the activating enzyme specifically hydrolyzed the alpha-ribosyl-guanidinium linkage. The beta-linked anomer was hydrolyzed only after anomerization to the alpha configuration. We recommend [arginine(N omega-ADP-alpha-ribose)]dinitrogenase reductase N-glycohydrolase (dinitrogenase reductase activating) and dinitrogenase reductase activating glycohydrolase as the systematic and working names for the activating enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1666251412,"Ram semen was found to contain 20-hydroxyprostaglandin E1 and 20-hydroxyprostaglandin E2. The relative amounts of the two compounds were almost equal, although ram semen contained at least 10 times more prostaglandin E1 than prostaglandin E2. The accessory genital glands of the ram were analyzed for their capacity to metabolize [14C]arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. Biosynthesis of prostaglandins was only found in microsomes of the mucosa of the ampulla of vas deferens and in microsomes of the vesicular glands. Ram vesicular glands and the ampulla of vas deferens were also found to contain the two 20-hydroxylated E prostaglandins. Microsomes of ram vesicular glands and NADPH metabolized exogenous prostaglandin E2 to 20-hydroxyprostaglandin E2 albeit in low yields. Prostaglandin E2 appeared to be a better substrate than prostaglandin E1. Microsomes of human seminal vesicles and NADPH metabolized exogenous prostaglandin E2 to 19-hydroxyprostaglandin E2. The results show that 19- and 20-hydroxylation of prostaglandins occurs in human and ram seminal vesicles, respectively, and possibly also in the ampulla of vas deferens of the ram. The ram and human enzymes specifically hydroxylated the terminal and the penultimate carbon of prostaglandin E2, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1550874569,"Oligonucleotide-directed, site-specific mutagenesis has been utilized to modify the lac Y gene of Escherichia coli such that Cys148 in the lac permease is converted to Ser.

In contrast to Gly148 permease (Trumble, W.R., Viitanen, P.V., Sarkar, H.K., Poonian, M.S., and Kaback, H. R. (1984) Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Like Gly148 permease, however, transport activity is less sensitive to inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide, and galactosyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside affords no protection against inactivation. The observations provide strong support for the contention that Cys148 is obligatory for substrate protection against inactivation by sulfhydryl reagents, but does not play an essential role in lactose:H+ symport."
https://openalex.org/W1571516143,"The interaction of nucleotides with pertussis toxin (PT), and their effects on the ability of the toxin to ADP-ribosylate pure Ni, were evaluated. [32P]ATP (10 nM) bound directly to dithiothreitol-activated PT. This binding was competitively inhibited by nucleotides and anions with the following IC50 concentrations in order of decreasing potency: ATP = ATP gamma S (adenosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)) = 0.2-0.3 microM, GDP beta S (guanosine-5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate)) = 2-3 microM, GTP gamma S (guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)) = 10-15 microM, ADP = 20-25 microM, GTP = 30-40 microM, GMP-P(NH)P (guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate) = 100-150 microM, GDP = 150-200 microM, Pi = SO4(2-) = 20 mM and Cl- = acetate = 30-35 mM. Treatment of PT with ATP, AMP-P(NH)P, GTP, GDP, or GDP beta S, resulted in a stimulated state of NAD+-Ni ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. Addition of ATP, AMP-P(NH)P (adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate), GTP, GDP, and GDP beta S to the ADP-ribosylation reactions resulted in increased rates of ADP-ribosyl-Ni formation. It is concluded that these effects on the nucleotides are due to their action to stimulate the activity of PT. At concentrations of PT between 0.04 and 0.4 microgram/ml, the stimulation of ADP-ribosylation of Ni effected by nucleotides was hysteretic in nature, exhibiting an approximately 25-min long lag when GDP was used as the activating nucleotide. These lags decreased with increasing concentrations of PT, and were abolished by pretreatment of the toxin with GDP or ATP. Preliminary incubation of Ni with GDP had no effect on the lag in its ADP-ribosylation by non-nucleotide treated PT. Addition of divalent cations (Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+) inhibited formation of ADP-ribosyl-Ni, possibly by causing aggregation and denaturation of Ni. This is the first demonstration that both adenine and guanine nucleotides interact directly with PT and act to stimulate its activity to ADP-ribosylate Ni, and that guanine nucleotides do so regardless of whether they are nucleoside di- or triphosphates."

The molecular weight of the native enzyme as estimated by gel filtration and isokinetic sucrose gradients was found to be 58,000-63,000, with a subunit molecular weight of approximately 29,000, as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Mono P chromatofocusing chromatography gives rise to a major activity peak eluting from the column at a pH of 6.75 and two minor activity peaks at pH of 5.3 and 5.2. Hypoxanthine and xanthine can be recognized by the enzyme as substrates but at Km values 20 times higher than that observed with guanine. G. lamblia guanine phosphoribosyltransferase is immunologically distinct from human hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and Escherichia coli xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, and G. lamblia DNA fragments are incapable of hybridizing with mouse neuroblastoma hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase DNA or E. coli xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase DNA under relatively relaxed conditions.

https://openalex.org/W1541530238,"Several mutations were constructed in residues thought to provide ligands for a [4Fe-4S] cluster in Bacillus subtilis amidophosphoribosyltransferase using site-directed mutagenesis of cloned purF. These replacements confirm the identification of cysteinyl ligands to the Fe-S center. Of five mutant enzymes, two had no activity, two less than 25% of the wild type activity, and one was lethal and could not be studied. The Fe content of the two mutant enzymes with partial activity was similar to that of the wild type. Results of partial characterization suggest that the [4Fe-4S] cluster is not involved in allosteric regulation and does not play a specific role in the ammonia- or glutamine-dependent reactions of the enzyme. At least partial enzymatic activity is required for NH2-terminal processing. Pulse labeling experiments suggest that processing is a slow post-translational process which is dependent upon cellular factors. A relationship between Fe-S centers and NH2-terminal processing of an undecapeptide leader suggests a functional connection between these two structural elements in amidophosphoribosyltransferase."

Single chain factor V appeared as a multidomain structure with three globular domains of similar size (diameter approximately 80 A), and oriented around a somewhat larger central domain (diameter approximately 140 A). The distance between the center of the molecule and the center of each of the peripheral domains was 120 A and the maximum length of factor V was 300 A. The structure was essentially identical with that recently shown for human single chain factor V (Dahlback, B. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 1347-1349). Isolated thrombin-activated factor Va (containing fragments D and F1F2) was composed of two domains of similar size, each of which was approximately 80 A in diameter and corresponded in size and shape to the peripheral domains seen in intact factor V. The isolated activation fragment C1 appeared as an irregular structure with an approximate diameter of 140 A and corresponded in size and shape to the larger central domain in intact factor V. The activator from Russell's viper venom only cleaves the bond(s) between C1 and F1F2, which results in two fragments, a larger fragment (Mr = 220,000) bearing the D, E, and C1 region and a smaller one corresponding to the F1F2 fragment. The venom-activated factor Va in the electron microscope demonstrated a multidomain structure similar in size and shape to that obtained with intact factor V.

To determine what distinguishes and regulates these two processing methods, the proteolytic processing and secretion of apo-A-I was studied by metabolic labeling in chick hepatocytes and in Hep-G2 cells (derived from a human hepatocellular carcinoma). The proportions of intracellular and secreted pro-apo-A-I and apo-A-I were measured by sequencing NH2-terminal portions of the proteins and determining the location of radio-labeled amino acids. Chick hepatocytes cultured in the absence of hormones or fetal bovine serum secreted primarily processed apo-A-I (83%). In the presence of serum these cells secreted only pro-apo-A-I, whereas incubation with a combination of hormones (insulin, triiodothyronine, dexamethasone) resulted in secretion of a nearly equal mixture of the pro- and processed forms of the protein. In contrast, Hep-G2 cells, maintained in the absence of serum, secreted only pro-apo-A-I; when grown in the presence of serum these cells secreted a mixture of pro- and processed apo-A-I. Under conditions in which chick hepatocytes and Hep-G2 cells secreted both forms of the protein, a mixture of pro- and processed apo-A-I was also found intracellularly; when only the pro-form was secreted, the cells likewise contained only pro-apo-A-I. Under all the above conditions, the secreted apo-A-I exhibited similar isoform patterns in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. These data show that both chick hepatocytes and human hepatoma cells are capable of intracellularly processing pro-apo-A-I to apo-A-I, and that the extent of intracellular processing is controlled by the cell's hormonal environment."
https://openalex.org/W1541679067,"A DNA ligase has been purified approximately 2,100-fold, to near-homogeneity, from Drosophila melanogaster 6-12-h embryos and was shown to catalyze the formation of 3',5'-phosphodiester bonds. Polypeptides with molecular weights 83,000, 75,000, and 64,000 were observed when the purified enzyme was electrophoresed under denaturing conditions. These polypeptides were shown by partial proteolysis studies and two-dimensional gel analysis to be structurally related. The two smaller polypeptides were presumably derived from the largest, 83,000 molecular weight protein, by proteolysis during purification or in vivo. All three polypeptides formed enzyme-adenylylate complexes in the absence of DNA. Drosophila DNA ligase had a Stokes radius of 45 A, a sedimentation coefficient of 4.3 S, and a frictional ratio of 1.6, yielding a calculated molecular weight of 79,800. These studies indicate that DNA ligase from Drosophila embryos is a monomer. The purified ligase was free of detectable ATPase, nuclease, topoisomerase, and DNA polymerase activities. The enzyme exhibited an absolute requirement for ATP in the joining reaction. A divalent metal was required and N-ethylmaleimide inhibited the reaction. Formation of phosphodiester bonds by Drosophila ligase required the presence of 5'-phosphoryl and 3'-hydroxyl termini. The purified enzyme restored biological activity to endonucleolytically cleaved pBR322 DNA. The specific activity of Drosophila DNA ligase was highest in unfertilized eggs. Developing embryos had 5-10-fold more ligase activity than at any later time in development."
https://openalex.org/W2148542375,"EDTA (4 mM) blocks the oxidation of iodide to I-3 (increase of extinction at 353 nm) by H2O2 catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase, which is reversed by the addition of an equimolar concentration of Zn2+. Addition of suboptimal concentration of EDTA (2 mM) not only decreases the rate of forward reaction of I-3 formation but also causes loss of extinction of the same when I-3 is generated. The loss of extinction of I-3 is proportional to the enzyme concentration and is blocked by azide, the inhibitor of the peroxidase. EDTA also causes bleaching of nonenzymatically formed I-3 (from iodide and H2O2) only in the presence of horseradish peroxidase, and the effect is reversed by the equimolar concentration of Zn2+. Both the bleaching of I-3 by EDTA and reversal of EDTA effect by Zn2+ are sensitive to azide. The decrease of extinction of I-3 (formed by dissolving iodine in KI solution) is dependent on EDTA, H2O2, and horseradish peroxidase. Molecular iodine is also bleached but at a slower rate than I-3. Evidence is presented to show that this bleaching of I-3 is due to enzymatic conversion of I-3 to iodide in presence of EDTA and H2O2 and this involves pseudocatalatic degradation of H2O2 to O2."
https://openalex.org/W170162191,"The mutant strain of Dictyostelium discoideum, HMW-437, contains a mutation in the structural gene coding for the lysosomal enzyme alpha-mannosidase. Unlike the wild type strain, Ax3, this strain fails to proteolytically process or secrete the 140,000-dalton alpha-mannosidase precursor. The level of sulfate incorporation into the mutant precursor was significantly lower when compared to the wild type precursor. In addition, the mutant precursor was entirely sensitive to endoglycosidase H. Subcellular fractionation of HMW-437 membranes indicated that the majority of the alpha-mannosidase precursor sedimented in a region of the gradient corresponding to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This accumulation within the rough endoplasmic reticulum did not appear to result from gross conformational changes which lead to aggregation. Trypsin digestion of radioactively labeled Ax3 and HMW-437 precursors demonstrated that there were differences in susceptibility to protease cleavage between the wild type and mutant alpha-mannosidase precursor molecules, suggesting that a minor conformational change could contribute to the accumulation of the mutant precursor inside the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1549987245,"Pure 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase of Escherichia coli, a trimeric enzyme which has the unique properties of forming an abortive Schiff-base intermediate with glyoxylate (the aldehydic product/substrate) and of showing strong beta-decarboxylase activity toward oxalacetate, binds any one of its substrates (2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate, pyruvate, or glyoxylate) in a competitive manner. To determine whether the substrates bind at the same or different (juxta-positioned) sites and what degree of homology might exist between the active-site lysine peptide of this enzyme and that of other lysine-type (Class I) aldolases or beta-decarboxylases, the azomethine formed separately by this aldolase with either [14C]pyruvate or [14C]glyoxylate was reduced with CNBH3-. After each enzyme adduct was digested with trypsin, the 14C-labeled peptide was isolated, purified, and subjected to amino acid analysis and sequence determination. In each case, the same 14-amino acid lysine-peptide was isolated and found to have the following primary sequence: Glu-Phe-*Lys-Phe-Phe-Pro-Ala-Glu-Ala-Asn-Gly-Gly-Val-Lys (where * = the active-site lysine). Hence, glyoxylate competes for, and inhibits aldolase activity by reacting with, the one active-site lysine residue/subunit. This active-site lysine peptide has a high degree (65%) of homology with that of 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase of Pseudomonas putida but is not similar to that of any Class I fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase or of acetoacetate beta-decarboxylase of Clostridium acetobutylicum. Furthermore, it was found that extensive reaction of glyoxylate with the N-terminal amino group of this enzyme may well be general complicating factor in sequence studies with proteins plus glyoxylate."
https://openalex.org/W1966106267,"Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used in the study of glucose metabolism, specifically aldose reductase inhibition, in intact rabbit lenses maintained in organ culture. This technique provides an effective method of screening potential inhibitors of aldose reductase under conditions that more closely approximate in vivo conditions than do earlier methods. The aspirin substitutes acetaminophen and ibuprofen were studied as aldose reductase inhibitors and were found to be effective in reducing sorbitol accumulation in lenses exposed to high glucose stress. Results of this work with various inhibitors of aldose reductase are discussed in terms of lens metabolism and implications regarding diabetic complications such as cataract formation."
https://openalex.org/W203340632,"Immunologic probes have been used to examine the conformation of apolipoprotein B (apo-B) as it exists within native low density lipoprotein (LDL) after lipid displacement with Triton X-100 and after denaturation with guanidine hydrochloride organic solvent delipidation and reconstitution with Triton X-100. Antigenic expression was assayed in two systems: by using either Triton X-100 or bovine serum albumin to maintain protein solubility. Apo-B delipidated by lipid displacement using Triton X-100 was virtually identical to LDL-apo-B in both systems, as assayed by polyclonal antisera prepared in rabbits against either antigen. Thus the native antigenic sites are preserved, although the displacement of the lipid core of LDL drastically alters the physical properties of the particle. Apo-B delipidated by solvent extraction in guanidine was reconstituted with Triton X-100 by several methods, and the products were examined immunologically. One method yielded a product that resembled apo-B as delipidated with Triton X-100, although full reconstitution could not be achieved. Nevertheless, Triton promoted refolding of apo-B to reform partial native structure as judged immunologically. By using both physical and immunologic methods for assessing structure, it is clearly evident that the perceptions of the conformational states of reconstituted apo-B can be very different, and multiple criteria need to be used to assess lipoprotein reconstitution."
