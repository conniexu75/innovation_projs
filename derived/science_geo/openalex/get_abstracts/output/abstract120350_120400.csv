https://openalex.org/W2161996750,"The green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the Pacific Northwest jellyfish Aequorea victoria has generated intense interest as a marker for gene expression and localization of gene products. The chromophore, resulting from the spontaneous cyclization and oxidation of the sequence -Ser65 (or Thr65)-Tyr66-Gly67-, requires the native protein fold for both formation and fluorescence emission. The structure of Thr65 GFP has been determined at 1.9 angstrom resolution. The protein fold consists of an 11-stranded beta barrel with a coaxial helix, with the chromophore forming from the central helix. Directed mutagenesis of one residue adjacent to the chromophore, Thr203, to Tyr or His results in significantly red-shifted excitation and emission maxima."
https://openalex.org/W2075124527,"We have identified the yeast and human homologs of the SKP1 gene as a suppressor of cdc4 mutants and as a cyclin F-binding protein. Skp1p indirectly binds cyclin A/Cdk2 through Skp2p, and directly binds Skp2p, cyclin F, and Cdc4p through a novel structural motif called the F-box. SKP1 is required for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of Cin2p, Clb5p, and the Cdk inhibitor Sic1p, and provides a link between these molecules and the proteolysis machinery. A large number of proteins contain the F-box motif and are thereby implicated in the ubiquitin pathway. Different skp1 mutants arrest cells in either G1 or G2, suggesting a connection between regulation of proteolysis in different stages of the cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2058616210,"Pycnodysostosis, an autosomal recessive osteochondrodysplasia characterized by osteosclerosis and short stature, maps to chromosome 1q21. Cathepsin K, a cysteine protease gene that is highly expressed in osteoclasts, localized to the pycnodysostosis region. Nonsense, missense, and stop codon mutations in the gene encoding cathepsin K were identified in patients. Transient expression of complementary DNA containing the stop codon mutation resulted in messenger RNA but no immunologically detectable protein. Thus, pycnodysostosis results from gene defects in a lysosomal protease with highest expression in osteoclasts. These findings suggest that cathepsin K is a major protease in bone resorption, providing a possible rationale for the treatment of disorders such as osteoporosis and certain forms of arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W1979496428,"Two neurotrophic factors, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), are able to produce a long-lasting enhancement of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Unlike other forms of plasticity, neurotrophin-induced plasticity exhibited an immediate requirement for protein synthesis. Plasticity in rat hippocampal slices in which the synaptic neuropil was isolated from the principal cell bodies also required early protein synthesis. Thus, the neurotrophins may stimulate the synthesis of proteins in either axonal or dendritic compartments, allowing synapses to exert local control over the complement of proteins expressed at individual synaptic sites."

https://openalex.org/W1977297673,"Recent neuroimagery findings showed that the patterns of cerebral activation during the mental rehearsal of a motor act are similar to those produced by its actual execution. This concurs with the notion that part of the distributed neural activity taking place during movement involves internal simulations, but it is not yet clear what specific contribution the different brain areas involved bring to this process. Here, patients with lesions restricted to the parietal cortex were found to be impaired selectively at predicting, through mental imagery, the time necessary to perform differentiated finger movements and visually guided pointing gestures, in comparison to normal individuals and to a patient with damage to the primary motor area. These results suggest that the parietal cortex is important for the ability to generate mental movement representations."

https://openalex.org/W2003593894,"Integrin function is central to inflammation, immunity, and tumor progression. The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and integrins formed stable complexes that both inhibited native integrin adhesive function and promoted adhesion to vitronectin via a ligand binding site on uPAR. Interaction of soluble uPAR with the active conformer of integrins mimicked the inhibitory effects of membrane uPAR. Both uPAR-mediated adhesion and altered integrin function were blocked by a peptide that bound to uPAR and disrupted complexes. These data provide a paradigm for regulation of integrins in which a nonintegrin membrane receptor interacts with and modifies the function of activated integrins."

https://openalex.org/W2050016905,"The maintenance and significance of the complex populations of microbes present in the mammalian intestine are poorly understood. Comparison of conventionally housed and germ-free NMRI mice revealed that production of fucosylated glycoconjugates and an alpha1, 2-fucosyltransferase messenger RNA in the small-intestinal epithelium requires the normal microflora. Colonization of germ-free mice with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a component of this flora, restored the fucosylation program, whereas an isogenic strain carrying a transposon insertion that disrupts its ability to use L-fucose as a carbon source did not. Simplified models such as this should aid the study of open microbial ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W1972715299,"The solution structure of a human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) Rev peptide bound to stem-loop IIB of the Rev response element (RRE) RNA was solved by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The Rev peptide has an alpha-helical conformation and binds in the major groove of the RNA near a purine-rich internal loop. Several arginine side chains make base-specific contacts, and an asparagine residue contacts a G.A base pair. The phosphate backbone adjacent to a G.G base pair adopts an unusual structure that allows the peptide to access a widened major groove. The structure formed by the two purine-purine base pairs of the RRE creates a distinctive binding pocket that the peptide can use for specific recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1990286006,"The vertebrate nervous system is characterized by ensheathment of axons with myelin, a multilamellar membrane greatly enriched in the galactolipid galactocerebroside (GalC) and its sulfated derivative sulfatide. We have generated mice lacking the enzyme UDP-galactose:ceramide galactosyltransferase (CGT), which is required for GalC synthesis. CGT-deficient mice do not synthesize GalC or sulfatide but surprisingly form myelin containing glucocerebroside, a lipid not previously identified in myelin. Microscopic and morphometric analyses revealed myelin of normal ultrastructural appearance, except for slightly thinner sheaths in the ventral region of the spinal cord. Nevertheless, these mice exhibit severe generalized tremoring and mild ataxia, and electrophysiological analysis showed conduction deficits consistent with reduced insulative capacity of the myelin sheath. Moreover, with age, CGT-deficient mice develop progressive hindlimb paralysis and extensive vacuolation of the ventral region of the spinal cord. These results indicate that GalC and sulfatide play important roles in myelin function and stability."
https://openalex.org/W2164310262,"smoothened (smo) is a segment polarity gene required for correct patterning of every segment in Drosophila. The earliest defect in smo mutant embryos is loss of expression of the Hedgehog-responsive gene wingless between 1 and 2 hr after gastrulation. Since smo mutant embryos cannot respond to exogenous Hedgehog (Hh) but can respond to exogenous Wingless, the Smo product functions in Hh signaling. Smo acts downstream of or in parallel to Patched, an antagonist of the Hh signal. The smo gene encodes an integral membrane protein with characteristics of G proteinâ€“coupled receptors and shows homology to the Drosophila Frizzled protein. Based on its predicted physical characteristics and on its position in the Hh signaling pathway, we suggest that smo encodes a receptor for the Hh signal."

https://openalex.org/W1964889875,"The neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is well known to act on the central nervous system in ways that mimic stress and result in decreases in exploration, increases in sympathetic activity, decreases in parasympathetic outflow, and decreases in appetitive behavior. Urocortin, a neuropeptide related to CRF, binds with high affinity to the CRF2 receptor, is more potent than CRF in suppressing appetite, but is less potent than CRF in producing anxiety-like effects and activation. Doses as low as 10 nanograms injected intracerebroventricularly were effective in decreasing food intake in food-deprived and free-feeding rats. These results suggest that urocortin may be an endogenous CRF-like factor in the brain responsible for the effects of stress on appetite."
https://openalex.org/W1974559056,"Cdc2, the cyclin-dependent kinase that controls mitosis, is negatively regulated by phosphorylation on its threonine-14 and tyrosine-15 residues. Cdc25, the phosphatase that dephosphorylates both of these residues, undergoes activation and phosphorylation by multiple kinases at mitosis. Plx1, a kinase that associates with and phosphorylates the amino-terminal domain of Cdc25, was purified extensively from Xenopus egg extracts. Cloning of its complementary DNA revealed that Plx1 is related to the Polo family of protein kinases. Recombinant Plx1 phosphorylated Cdc25 and stimulated its activity in a purified system. Cdc25 phosphorylated by Plx1 reacted strongly with MPM-2, a monoclonal antibody to mitotic phosphoproteins. These studies indicate that Plx1 may participate in control of mitotic progression."

https://openalex.org/W2053519260,"The avidity of integrin adhesion receptors for extracellular ligands is subject to dynamic regulation by intracellular programs that have yet to be elucidated. We describe here a protein, cytohesin-1, which specifically interacts with the intracellular portion of the integrin beta 2 chain (CD18). The molecule shows homology to the yeast SEC7 gene product and bears a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Overexpression of either the full-length cytohesin-1 or the SEC7 domain induces beta 2 integrin-dependent binding of Jurkat cells to ICAM-1, whereas expression of the isolated cytohesin-1 PH domain inhibits T cell receptor-stimulated adhesion. Similar inhibition is not exhibited by PH domains taken from other proteins, showing that the interaction is specific and that individual PH domains are capable of discriminating between alternative targets."
https://openalex.org/W2075786281,"17beta-Estradiol modulates gene transcription through the estrogen receptor and the estrogen response element in DNA. The human transforming growth factor-beta3 gene was shown to be activated by the estrogen receptor in the presence of estrogen metabolites or estrogen antagonists. Activation was mediated by a polypurine sequence, termed the raloxifene response element, and did not require the DNA binding domain of the estrogen receptor. Interaction of the estrogen receptor with the raloxifene response element appears to require a cellular adapter protein. The observation that individual estrogens modulate multiple DNA response elements may explain the tissue-selective estrogen agonist or antagonist activity of compounds such as raloxifene."
https://openalex.org/W2012407846,"The hormone abscisic acid (ABA) modulates a variety of developmental processes and responses to environmental stress in higher plants. A collection of mutations, designated era, in Arabidopsis thaliana that confer an enhanced response to exogenous ABA includes mutations in the Era1 gene, which encodes the beta subunit of a protein farnesyl transferase. In yeast and mammalian systems, farnesyl transferases modify several signal transduction proteins for membrane localization. The era1 mutants suggest that a negative regulator of ABA sensitivity must be acted on by a farnesyl transferase to function."
https://openalex.org/W2081966923,"Upon contact with the eukaryotic cell, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis increased the rate of transcription of virulence genes (yop), as determined by in situ monitoring of light emission from individual bacteria expressing luciferase under the control of the yopE promoter. The microbe-host interaction triggered export of LcrQ, a negative regulator of Yop expression, via the Yop-type III secretion system. The intracellular concentration of LcrQ was thereby lowered, resulting in increased expression of Yops. These results suggest a key role for the type III secretion system of pathogenic bacteria to coordinate secretion with expression of virulence factors after physical contact with the target cell."
https://openalex.org/W2075370328,"Complementary chromatic adaptation in cyanobacteria acts through photoreceptors to control the biosynthesis of light-harvesting complexes. The mutant FdBk, which appears black, cannot chromatically adapt and may contain a lesion in the apparatus that senses light quality. The complementing gene identified here, rcaE, encodes a deduced protein in which the amino-terminal region resembles the chromophore attachment domain of phytochrome photoreceptors and regions of plant ethylene receptors; the carboxyl- terminal half is similar to the histidine kinase domain of two-component sensor kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2126207814,"The maize crinkly4 (cr4) mutation affects leaf epidermis differentiation such that cell size and morphology are altered, and surface functions are compromised, allowing graft-like fusions between organs. In the seed, loss of cr4 inhibits aleurone formation in a pattern that reflects the normal progression of differentiation over the developing endosperm surface. The cr4 gene was isolated by transposon tagging and found to encode a putative receptor kinase. The extracellular domain contains a cysteine-rich region similar to the ligand binding domain in mammalian tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs) and seven copies of a previously unknown 39-amino acid repeat. The results suggest a role for cr4 in a differentiation signal."
https://openalex.org/W2015764953,"During neurogenesis in Drosophila both neurons and nonneuronal cells are produced from a population of initially equivalent cells. The kuzbanian (kuz) gene described here is essential for the partitioning of neural and nonneuronal cells during development of both the central and peripheral nervous systems in Drosophila. Mosaic analyses indicated that kuz is required for cells to receive signals inhibiting the neural fate. These analyses further revealed that the development of a neuron requires a kuz-mediated positive signal from neighboring cells. The kuz gene encodes a metalloprotease-disintegrin protein with a highly conserved bovine homolog, raising the possibility that kuz homologs may act in similar processes during mammalian neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2005672588,"Cytoplasmic domains of members of the p24 family of putative cargo receptors were shown to bind to coatomer, the coat protein of COPI-coated transport vesicles. Domains that contained dilysine endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signals bound the alpha-, beta'-, and epsilon-COP subunits of coatomer, whereas other p24 domains bound the beta-, gamma-, and zeta-COP subunits and required a phenylalanine-containing motif. Transit of a CD8-p24 chimera from the endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi complex was slowed when the phenylalanine motif was mutated, suggesting that this motif may function as an anterograde transport signal. The either-or bimodal binding of coatomer to p24 tails suggests models for how coatomer can potentially package retrograde-directed and anterograde-directed cargo into distinct COPI-coated vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2078402042,"Subdivision of the limb primordia of Drosophila into anterior and posterior compartments triggers cell interactions that pattern the legs and wings. A comparable compartment-based mechanism is used to pattern the dorsal-ventral axis of the wing. Evidence is presented here for a mechanism based on cell interaction, rather than on compartment formation, that distinguishes dorsal from ventral in the leg. Mutual repression by Wingless and Decapentaplegic signaling systems generates a stable regulatory circuit by which each gene maintains its own expression in a spatially restricted domain. Compartment-independent patterning mechanisms may be used by other organisms during development."

https://openalex.org/W2053191459,"A chimeric oligonucleotide composed of DNA and modified RNA residues was used to direct correction of the mutation in the hemoglobin Î²S allele. After introduction of the chimeric molecule into lymphoblastoid cells homozygous for the Î²S mutation, there was a detectable level of gene conversion of the mutant allele to the normal sequence. The efficient and specific conversion directed by chimeric molecules may hold promise as a therapeutic method for the treatment of genetic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2021289499,"The eukaryotic 20S proteasome is known to associate with the IFNÎ³-inducible regulator PA28. We analyzed the kinetics of product generation by 20S proteasomes with and without PA28. In the absence of PA28, the 20S proteasome rapidly generates peptides that have been cleaved only once, while internal fragments accumulate only slowly. In the presence of PA28, products generated by two flanking cleavages appear immediately as main products while the generation of single-cleavage products is strongly reduced. Kinetic data support a PA28-induced, coordinated double-cleavage mechanism. In particular, degradation of peptides derived from mouse cytomegalovirus pp89 and JAK1 kinase in the presence of PA28 leads to strongly enhanced production of the respective major histocompatibility complex ligands and potential precursors. These results show that PA28 profoundly alters the cleavage mechanism of the proteasome and appears to optimize the generation of dominant T-cell epitopes."
https://openalex.org/W2033646526,"The budding yeast SKP1gene, identified as a dosage suppressor of a known kinetochore protein mutant, encodes an intrinsic 22.3 kDa subunit of CBF3, a multiprotein complex that binds centromere DNA in vitro. Temperature-sensitive mutations in SKP1 define two distinct phenotypic classes. skp1-4 mutants arrest predominantly as large budded cells with a G2 DNA content and short mitotic spindle, consistent with a role in kinetochore function. skp1-3 mutants, however, arrest predominantly as multiply budded cells with a G1 DNA content, suggesting an additional role during the G1/S phase. Identification of Skp1p homologs from C. elegans, A. thaliana, and H. sapiens indicates that SKP1 is evolutionarily highly conserved. Skp1p therefore represents an intrinsic kinetochore protein conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution and may be directly involved in linking kinetochore function with the cell cycle-regulatory machinery."

https://openalex.org/W2017298715,"The role of viral oncoprotein expression in the maintenance of cellular transformation was examined as a function of time through controlled expression of simian virus 40 T antigen (TAg). Expression of TAg in the submandibular gland of transgenic mice from the time of birth induced cellular transformation and extensive ductal hyperplasia by 4 months of age. The hyperplasia was reversed when TAg expression was silenced for 3 weeks. When TAg expression was silenced after 7 months, however, the hyperplasia persisted even though TAg was absent. Although the polyploidy of ductal cells could be reversed at 4 months of age, cells at 7 months of age remained polyploid even in the absence of TAg. These results support a model of time-dependent multistep tumorigenesis, in which virally transformed cells eventually lose their dependence on the viral oncoprotein for maintenance of the transformed state."

https://openalex.org/W2091819544,"When we move forward while walking or driving, what we see appears to expand. The center or focus of this expansion tells us our direction of self-motion, or heading, as long as our eyes are still. However, if our eyes move, as when tracking a nearby object on the ground, the retinal image is disrupted and the focus is shifted away from the heading. Neurons in primate dorso-medial superior temporal area responded selectively to an expansion focus in a certain part of the visual field, and this selective region shifted during tracking eye movements in a way that compensated for the retinal focus shift. Therefore, these neurons account for the effect of eye movements on what we see as we travel forward through the world."
https://openalex.org/W2086940038,"T cell development is regulated at two major control points where maturation, proliferation, and antigen receptor gene rearrangement are coordinated. Progression through these developmental control points is dependent upon the expression of different forms of the T cell receptor. Here we show that the MAP kinase cascade is a regulator of the differentiation of immature thymocytes from double-negative to double-positive cell, most probably acting as a transducer of pre-T cell receptor signaling. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the use of retrovirus-mediated gene transfer in fetal thymic organ culture in the analysis of thymic development in mutant mice, an alternative to transgenesis by oocyte injection."

https://openalex.org/W2044874270,"Partitioning continuously varying stimuli into categories is a fundamental problem of perception. One solution to this problem, categorical perception, is known primarily from human speech, but also occurs in other modalities and in some mammals and birds. Categorical perception was tested in crickets by using two paradigms of human psychophysics, labeling and habituation-dishabituation. The results show that crickets divide sound frequency categorically between attractive (<16 kilohertz) and repulsive (>16 kilohertz) sounds. There is sharp discrimination between these categories but no discrimination between different frequencies of ultrasound. This demonstration of categorical perception in an invertebrate suggests that categorical perception may be a basic and widespread feature of sensory systems, from humans to invertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W1964096332,"The induction of cascades of virulence factors after contact between bacteria and host cells was investigated. P-pili mediate the binding of uropathogenic Escherichia coli to its host cell receptor. After P-pili binding there was transcriptional activation of a sensor-regulator protein that is essential for the bacterial iron-starvation response. An insertion mutation of the sensor-regulator gene eliminated the ability of uropathogenic E. coli to produce siderophores and their iron-regulated membrane receptors, thereby abolishing their ability to grow in urine. These results suggest that P-pilus-mediated attachment may be an important part of the sensor-regulatory process involved in uropathogenic E. coli urinary tract infection."

https://openalex.org/W2163636387,"The C. elegans gene ced-4 is essential for programmed cell death. We report that ced-4 encodes two transcripts and that whereas the major transcript can cause programmed cell death, the minor transcript can act oppositely and prevent programmed cell death, thus defining a novel class of cell death inhibitors. That ced-4 has both cell-killing and cell-protective functions is consistent with previous genetic studies. Our results suggest that the dual protective and killer functions of the C. elegans bcl-2-like gene ced-9 are mediated by inhibition of the killer and protective ced-4 functions, respectively. We propose that a balance between opposing ced-4 functions influences the decision of a cell to live or to die by programmed cell death and that both ced-9 and ced-4 protective functions are required to prevent programmed cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1999859798,"A modulator of the enzymatic activity of human thrombin, designated LY254603, was identified that enhances the thrombin-catalyzed generation of the anticoagulant factor activated protein C, yet inhibits thrombin-dependent fibrinogen clotting. By means of mutant substrates, it was shown that LY254603 mediates the change in enzymatic substrate specificity through an alteration in thrombin's S3 substrate recognition site, a mechanism that appeared to be independent of allosteric changes induced by either sodium ions or by thrombomodulin. This compound may represent the prototype of a class of agents that specifically modulates the balance between thrombin's procoagulant and anticoagulant functions."

The oxygen isotopic composition of the Puente del Zacate inclusion is like chromite and phosphate inclusions in other IIIA and IIIB irons.
