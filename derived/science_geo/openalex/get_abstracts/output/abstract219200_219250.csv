https://openalex.org/W2075029650,"The electron spin resonance spectra of solutions of nitric oxide-hemoglobin and nitric oxide-methemoglobin, and whole blood treated at room temperature with nitric oxide, all exhibit resonance with a line width of 83 gauss, a g-value of 2.03, and a spin intensity corresponding to one unpaired electron spin per heme. The minimum detectable concentration of these nitric oxide complexes in solution is 10(-5)M. Solutions were stable in a nitrogen atmosphere but when exposed to air in the absence of nitric oxide the spin intensity decreased with a half-life of about 5 hours. A preliminary examination of blood of rats exposed 1 and 9 days to 10 ppm of nitric oxide in air showed no electron spin resonance."

https://openalex.org/W1976733622,"IT has recently been demonstrated that reparatively growing tissues in skin wounds in the rat produce histamine at a high rate as a result of increased activity of histidine decarboxylase1. Further, the rate of repair, as measured by the tensile strength of the healing wound in situ, can be augmented or retarded, respectively, by artificial increase or inhibition of the histamine-forming capacity of the growing tissues. In these experiments the histamine-forming capacity was increased by injections of the histamine liberator 48/80, which depletes the skin of its histamine content and concomitantly raises the skin level of histidine decarboxylase. Extracellular histamine, derived from injected ‘long-acting histamine’, had no detectable effect on growth in healing. It was concluded that only intracellularly formed ‘nascent’ histamine is active in promoting certain types of growth2."

https://openalex.org/W2052232709,"A new type of genetically homogeneous dystrophic and comparable normal mice, from an F(1) hybrid cross between 129/Re-dy and C57BL/6J-dy, is now available as a result of a special breeding program. The clinical manifestations in these F(1) hybrid dystrophics correspond closely with those observed in 129/Re-dydy mice, and they give completely comparable results on a variety of research tests. They are, however, considerably healthier than previously available dystrophics, with a growth rate closer to normal and a greatly increased life-span."
https://openalex.org/W2059606834,"THE excretion of a number of water-soluble azo dyes in rat bile, following intravenous injection, has been previously examined by us1 as a means of estimating the likely extent of uptake and metabolism of these compounds. Among the dyes examined, two phenylazopyrazolones provided highly contrasting results. Tartrazine (1a, R1= COONa, R2 = H) was virtually not excreted at all, whereas lissamine fast yellow 2G (1b, R1 = CH3, R2 = Cl) was excreted quantitatively (Table 1). We have now obtained evidence showing that the carboxyl group of tartrazine is responsible for the difference in excretion."

https://openalex.org/W1971008402,"UNSTABLE L forms of Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain B.38) induced by glycine have been described by Rubio-Huertos and Desjardins1. In the present work two strains, A.T.B. and A.T. isolated from grapes, were grown in agar plates with 4 per cent glycine, where they readily formed typical L colonies. These were transferred simultaneously at intervals of 2–3 days to new plates of agar–glycine and glucose–agar without glycine. On the fiftieth transfer no reversion to the normal bacillary form was observed even after 32 further transfers in medium without glycine. The fixed colonies, formed by spherically dense elements, have the same macroscopical appearance as the normal colonies of A. tumefaciens grown in the same medium and have lost the typical features of the L colonies."

Meralluride (6.8 mg of Hg per kilogram, subcutaneously) blocks the effect of acetazolamide on the cesium-137 excretion without any influence on the urine volume and pH of the urine. This indicates that acetazolamide increases the urinary excretion of cesium-137 by increasing its secretion through the renal tubule in the same manner as it increases the excretion of potassium and rubidium-86."

https://openalex.org/W2014236514,"DURING a recent investigation into hæmolytic and other anæmias in Papuans the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-P D) activity of erythrocytes was estimated in 45 cases. Blood was collected into heparin, and on several occasions into acid–citrate dextrose solution, and dispatched by air to Melbourne, arriving the same day. The G-6-P D activity was estimated in the Biochemistry Department of the Peter MacCallum Clinic, Melbourne, by the method described by Hsia1. By this method normal readings are 150–210 units/100 ml. The enzyme appears to be relatively stable for at least a week, provided the cells remain intact. The highest values were obtained in cases of thalassæmia major, acute hæmolytic anæmia of undetermined cause, and congenital hæmolytic ansemia of unknown cause. There was no significant difference in the results obtained, whether A.C.D. solution or heparin was used as an anti-coagulant. The twelve subjects used as controls all gave readings within the accepted range of normality."

https://openalex.org/W2000157395,The process of humming can be used as a basal vocal measurement which can be repeatedly obtained with an accuracy comparable to that of other physiological variables. Studies have shown a diurnal fluctuation of the hum frequency. Data were collected by employing automatic telephone-answering equipment.
