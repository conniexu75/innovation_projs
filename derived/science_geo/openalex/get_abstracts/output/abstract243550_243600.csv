https://openalex.org/W2100250587,"Satellite cells are situated beneath the basal lamina that surrounds each myofiber and function as myogenic precursors for muscle growth and repair. The source of satellite cell renewal is controversial and has been suggested to be a separate circulating or interstitial stem cell population. Here, we transplant single intact myofibers into radiation-ablated muscles and demonstrate that satellite cells are self-sufficient as a source of regeneration. As few as seven satellite cells associated with one transplanted myofiber can generate over 100 new myofibers containing thousands of myonuclei. Moreover, the transplanted satellite cells vigorously self-renew, expanding in number and repopulating the host muscle with new satellite cells. Following experimental injury, these cells proliferate extensively and regenerate large compact clusters of myofibers. Thus, within a normally stable tissue, the satellite cell exhibits archetypal stem cell properties and is competent to form the basal origin of adult muscle regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2150381945,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are potent inducers of oxidative damage and have been implicated in the regulation of specific cellular functions, including apoptosis. Mitochondrial ROS increase markedly after proapoptotic signals, though the biological significance and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain undetermined. P66Shc is a genetic determinant of life span in mammals, which regulates ROS metabolism and apoptosis. We report here that p66Shc is a redox enzyme that generates mitochondrial ROS (hydrogen peroxide) as signaling molecules for apoptosis. For this function, p66Shc utilizes reducing equivalents of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain through the oxidation of cytochrome c. Redox-defective mutants of p66Shc are unable to induce mitochondrial ROS generation and swelling in vitro or to mediate mitochondrial apoptosis in vivo. These data demonstrate the existence of alternative redox reactions of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain, which evolved to generate proapoptotic ROS in response to specific stress signals."
https://openalex.org/W2140864873,"Dopamine plays an important role in the etiology of schizophrenia, and D2 class dopamine receptors are the best-established target of antipsychotic drugs. Here we show that D2 class-receptor-mediated Akt regulation involves the formation of signaling complexes containing beta-arrestin 2, PP2A, and Akt. beta-arrestin 2 deficiency in mice results in reduction of dopamine-dependent behaviors, loss of Akt regulation by dopamine in the striatum, and disruption of the dopamine-dependent interaction of Akt with its negative regulator, protein phosphatase 2A. Importantly, canonical cAMP-mediated dopamine-receptor signaling is not inhibited in the absence of beta-arrestin 2. These results demonstrate that, apart from its classical function in receptor desensitization, beta-arrestin 2 also acts as a signaling intermediate through a kinase/phosphatase scaffold. Furthermore, this function of beta-arrestin 2 is important for the expression of dopamine-associated behaviors, thus implicating beta-arrestin 2 as a positive mediator of dopaminergic synaptic transmission and a potential pharmacological target for dopamine-related psychiatric disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2115183068,"It has been suggested that germline stem cells maintain oogenesis in postnatal mouse ovaries. Here we show that adult mouse ovaries rapidly generate hundreds of oocytes, despite a small premeiotic germ cell pool. In considering the possibility of an extragonadal source of germ cells, we show expression of germline markers in bone marrow (BM). Further, BM transplantation restores oocyte production in wild-type mice sterilized by chemotherapy, as well as in ataxia telangiectasia-mutated gene-deficient mice, which are otherwise incapable of making oocytes. Donor-derived oocytes are also observed in female mice following peripheral blood transplantation. Although the fertilizability and developmental competency of the BM and peripheral blood-derived oocytes remain to be established, their morphology, enclosure within follicles, and expression of germ-cell- and oocyte-specific markers collectively support that these cells are bona fide oocytes. These results identify BM as a potential source of germ cells that could sustain oocyte production in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2147289825,"The E. coli chaperonin GroEL and its cofactor GroES promote protein folding by sequestering nonnative polypeptides in a cage-like structure. Here we define the contribution of this system to protein folding across the entire E. coli proteome. Approximately 250 different proteins interact with GroEL, but most of these can utilize either GroEL or the upstream chaperones trigger factor (TF) and DnaK for folding. Obligate GroEL-dependence is limited to only approximately 85 substrates, including 13 essential proteins, and occupying more than 75% of GroEL capacity. These proteins appear to populate kinetically trapped intermediates during folding; they are stabilized by TF/DnaK against aggregation but reach native state only upon transfer to GroEL/GroES. Interestingly, substantially enriched among the GroEL substrates are proteins with (betaalpha)8 TIM-barrel domains. We suggest that the chaperonin system may have facilitated the evolution of this fold into a versatile platform for the implementation of numerous enzymatic functions."
https://openalex.org/W2171228793,"HIV-1 Tat transactivation is vital for completion of the viral life cycle and has been implicated in determining proviral latency. We present an extensive experimental/computational study of an HIV-1 model vector (LTR-GFP-IRES-Tat) and show that stochastic fluctuations in Tat influence the viral latency decision. Low GFP/Tat expression was found to generate bifurcating phenotypes with clonal populations derived from single proviral integrations simultaneously exhibiting very high and near zero GFP expression. Although phenotypic bifurcation (PheB) was correlated with distinct genomic integration patterns, neither these patterns nor other extrinsic cellular factors (cell cycle/size, aneuploidy, chromatin silencing, etc.) explained PheB. Stochastic computational modeling successfully accounted for PheB and correctly predicted the dynamics of a Tat mutant that were subsequently confirmed by experiment. Thus, Tat stochastics appear sufficient to generate PheB (and potentially proviral latency), illustrating the importance of stochastic fluctuations in gene expression in a mammalian system."
https://openalex.org/W2070874919,"The Lyme disease agent, Borrelia burgdorferi, is maintained in a tick-mouse cycle. Here we show that B. burgdorferi usurps a tick salivary protein, Salp15 (ref. 3), to facilitate the infection of mice. The level of salp15 expression was selectively enhanced by the presence of B. burgdorferi in Ixodes scapularis, first indicating that spirochaetes might use Salp15 during transmission. Salp15 was then shown to adhere to the spirochaete, both in vitro and in vivo, and specifically interacted with B. burgdorferi outer surface protein C. The binding of Salp15 protected B. burgdorferi from antibody-mediated killing in vitro and provided spirochaetes with a marked advantage when they were inoculated into naive mice or animals previously infected with B. burgdorferi. Moreover, RNA interference-mediated repression of salp15 in I. scapularis drastically reduced the capacity of tick-borne spirochaetes to infect mice. These results show the capacity of a pathogen to use a secreted arthropod protein to help it colonize the mammalian host."

https://openalex.org/W2046515122,"The open oceans comprise most of the biosphere, yet patterns and trends of species diversity there are enigmatic. Here, we derive worldwide patterns of tuna and billfish diversity over the past 50 years, revealing distinct subtropical ""hotspots"" that appeared to hold generally for other predators and zooplankton. Diversity was positively correlated with thermal fronts and dissolved oxygen and a nonlinear function of temperature (approximately 25 degrees C optimum). Diversity declined between 10 and 50% in all oceans, a trend that coincided with increased fishing pressure, superimposed on strong El Niño-Southern Oscillation-driven variability across the Pacific. We conclude that predator diversity shows a predictable yet eroding pattern signaling ecosystem-wide changes linked to climate and fishing."

https://openalex.org/W2049551663,"Erythrocyte binding antigen 175 (EBA-175) is a P. falciparum protein that binds the major glycoprotein found on human erythrocytes, glycophorin A, during invasion. Here we present the crystal structure of the erythrocyte binding domain of EBA-175, RII, which has been established as a vaccine candidate. Binding sites for the heavily sialylated receptor glycophorin A are proposed based on a complex of RII with a glycan that contains the essential components required for binding. The dimeric organization of RII displays two prominent channels that contain four of the six observed glycan binding sites. Each monomer consists of two Duffy binding-like (DBL) domains (F1 and F2). F2 more prominently lines the channels and makes the majority of the glycan contacts, underscoring its role in cytoadherence and in antigenic variation in malaria. Our studies provide insight into the mechanism of erythrocyte invasion by the malaria parasite and aid in rational drug design and vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W1986354535,T cells bearing alphabeta T cell receptors (TCRs) recognize antigens in the form of peptides bound to class I or class II major histocompatibility proteins (MHC). TCRs on mature T cells are usually very specific for both peptide and MHC class and allele. They are picked out from a precursor population in the thymus by MHC-driven positive and negative selection. Here we show that the pool of T cells initially positively selected in the thymus contains many T cells that are very crossreactive for peptide and MHC and that subsequent negative selection establishes the MHC-restriction and peptide specificity of peripheral T cells. Our results also suggest that germline-encoded TCR variable elements have an inherent predisposition to react with features shared by all MHC proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2043808419,"Nuclear receptors are a family of transcription factors with structurally conserved ligand binding domains that regulate their activity. Despite intensive efforts to identify ligands, most nuclear receptors are still “orphans.” Here, we demonstrate that the ligand binding pocket of the Drosophila nuclear receptor E75 contains a heme prosthetic group. E75 absorption spectra, resistance to denaturants, and effects of site-directed mutagenesis indicate a single, coordinately bound heme molecule. A correlation between the levels of E75 expression and the levels of available heme suggest a possible role as a heme sensor. The oxidation state of the heme iron also determines whether E75 can interact with its heterodimer partner DHR3, suggesting an additional role as a redox sensor. Further, the E75-DHR3 interaction is also regulated by the binding of NO or CO to the heme center, suggesting that E75 may also function as a diatomic gas sensor. Possible mechanisms and roles for these interactions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2035536565,"Protein arginine methylation is a common post-translational modification that has been implicated in signal transduction, RNA processing, transcriptional regulation, and DNA repair. A search of the human genome for additional members of the protein arginine N-methyltransferase (PRMT) family of enzymes has identified a gene on chromosome 12 that we have termed PRMT8. This novel enzyme is most closely related to PRMT1, although it has a distinctive N-terminal region. The unique N-terminal end harbors a myristoylation motif, and we have shown here that PRMT8 is indeed modified by the attachment of a myristate to the glycine residue after the initiator methionine. The myristoylation of PRMT8 results in its association with the plasma membrane. The second singular property of PRMT8 is its tissue-specific expression pattern; it is largely expressed in the brain. A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of PRMT8 has type I PRMT activity, catalyzing the formation of ω-NG-monomethylated and asymmetrically ω-NG,NG-dimethylated arginine residues on a recombinant glycine- and arginine-rich substrate.

In mammals, the family of protein arginine N-methyltransferases falls into two groups, type I enzymes that ω-NG-monomethylate and asymmetrically ω-NG,NG-dimethylate arginine residues (ADMA) and type II enzymes that ω-NG-monomethylate and symmetrically ω-NG,N′G-dimethylate arginine residues. PRMT1, -3, -4, and -6 are type I enzymes, and PRMT5 is a type II enzyme. The post-translational methylation of arginine residues has been shown to modify protein function by regulating protein-protein interactions, both negatively and positively (2Bedford M.T. Frankel A.

Arginine methylation is involved in a number of cellular systems, including DNA repair, RNA transcription, signal transduction, protein compartmentalization, and possibly also protein translation (5Bedford M.T. Richard S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar).The first PRMT to be identified and characterized was the yeast enzyme hnRNP methyltransferase/arginine methyltransferase 1 (6Gary J.D.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3668-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Shortly thereafter, PRMT1 was identified as the predominant mammalian type I enzyme (8Lin W.J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15034-15044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). PRMT2 was recognized because of its homology to known arginine methyltransferases (9Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Lalioti M.D. Rossier C. Silver P.A. Henry M.F. Genomics. 1998; 48: 330-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar); however, activity for this enzyme has yet to be demonstrated. PRMT3 was isolated as a PRMT1-binding partner in a yeast two-hybrid screen (10Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). CARM1 (PRMT4) was also identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as an enzyme that binds the steroid receptor coactivator GRIP1 (11Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). PRMT5 was cloned as a Jak2-binding protein (12Pollack B.P. Kotenko S.V. He W. Izotova L.S. Barnoski B.L. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31531-31542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). PRMT6 was identified by homology to other members of this enzyme family (13Frankel A. Yadav N. Lee J. Branscombe T.L. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3537-3543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). PRMT7 was isolated in a genetic screen for suppressor elements that confirm resistance to a topoisomerase II inhibitor (14Gros L. Delaporte C. Frey S. Decesse J. de Saint-Vincent B.R. Cavarec L. Dubart A. Gudkov A.V. Jacquemin-Sablon A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 164-171PubMed Google Scholar).The different PRMTs display varying degrees of substrate specificity. PRMT1, -3, -5, and -6 all methylate a glycine/arginine-rich (GAR) motif (10Tang J. Gary J.D. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16935-16945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 13Frankel A. Yadav N. Lee J. Branscombe T.L. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol.

CARM1 methylates relatively few substrates, none of which harbor a GAR motif, and currently, the CARM1 methylation motif remains ill-defined (11Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 17Lee J. Bedford M.T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). There is emerging evidence that the type I and type II enzymes can methylate some of the same substrates. This occurrence has been shown for the splicing factor SmB (18Miranda T.B. Khusial P. Cook J.R. Lee J.H. Gunderson S.I. Pestka S. Zieve G.W. Clarke S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the transcription elongation factor SPT5 (19Kwak Y.T. Guo J. Prajapati S. Park K.J. Surabhi R.M. Miller B. Gehrig P. Gaynor R.B.

Biol. 2004; 24: 9630-9645Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Thus, there are PRMT substrates that carry both symmetric ω-NG,N′G-dimethylarginine and ADMA residues at the same time, as well as substrates on which the same arginine residue can be either symmetrically or asymmetrically methylated.Here we characterized the eighth member of the PRMT family, PRMT8. This enzyme displays type I activity and is able to methylate a GAR motif from fibrillarin. The primary amino acid sequence of PRMT8 is very similar to ubiquitously expressed PRMT1, but PRMT8 is specifically expressed in the brain. Also unique to PRMT8 is an N-terminal extension that harbors a myristoylation motif and a patch of basic residues, which facilitate the membrane targeting of this enzyme.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESFull-length PRMT8 Plasmid Construction—To generate a full-length construct of PRMT8, we used the reported Hrmt1l3 (GenBank™ accession number BK001349) sequence to design primers for PCR amplification. Human “full-length” cDNA (Panomics) was used to amplify PRMT8 by PCR using the primers 5′-CTT GAA TTC ACC ATG GGC ATG AAA CAC TCC-3′ and 5′-TCA GTC GAC TGA CGC ATT TTG TAG TCA TTA-3′. The PCR product was then digested with EcoRI and SalI and used to construct both GST-PRMT8 and GFP-PRMT8 by subcloning in-frame into pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) and pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Inc.). FLAG-PRMT8 was generated by PCR with the primers 5′-CAT GAA TTC ATG GGC ATG AAA CAC TCC-3′ and 5′-TAA GTT TAA ACT TAA CGC ATT TTG TAG TCA TT-3′. The product was digested with EcoRI and PmeI and subcloned into a modified pTracer-EF vector (Invitrogen). The modified pTracer-EF vector contains a Kozak sequence, and ATG start codon, and a FLAG-tagged sequence. The site-directed mutant GFP-PRMT8(G→ A) was generated using Pfu Advantage polymerase (Clontech, Inc.) and the primers 5′-CTT GAA TTC AAG ATG GCC ATG AAA CAC TCC-3′ and 5′-TCA GTC GAC TGA CGC ATT TTG TAG TCA TTA-3′. The resulting product was digested with EcoRI and SalI and subcloned into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Inc.) and confirmed by sequencing.Northern Blot Analysis—A human poly(A)+RNA blot (Origene Technologies, Inc.) was probed with DNA corresponding to the PRMT8 open reading frame, which was liberated from the appropriate GFP fusion vector by restriction enzyme digestion. As the loading control, human β-actin DNA was used as a probe. DNA probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP using a Prime-it II® kit (Stratagene). Northern blot analysis was performed following standard procedures as previously described (13Frankel A. Yadav N. Lee J. Branscombe T.L. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3537-3543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Probed blots were exposed either 7 days (PRMT8) or 4 h (β-actin) at -80 °C.In Vitro Methylation—GST-GAR, GST-Npl3, and GST-PABPf have been described previously (13Frankel A. Yadav N. Lee J. Branscombe T.L. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3537-3543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Histones H3 and H4 were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Recombinant PRMT1 (1 μg), CARM1 (1 μg), and PRMT8 (1 μg) were incubated with GST (1 μg), GST-GAR (1 μg), GST-Npl3 (1 μg), histone H4 (1 μg), and histone H3 (1 μg) in the presence of 0.5 μCi S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (79 Ci/mmol from a 0.5 mCi/ml stock solution) (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 30 °C in a final volume of 30 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Reaction samples were boiled and separated on 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membrane. Methylated proteins were visualized by fluorography after the membrane was sprayed with Enhance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Amino Acid Analysis of Methylated GST-GAR—Methylation reactions were quenched by the addition of 60 μl of 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid to precipitate proteins in 6 × 50-mm glass vials. Precipitated proteins were centrifuged at 4000 × g for 40 min at 25 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellets were washed once with an equal volume of cold acetone (-20 °C). After an additional centrifugation for 20 min, the acetone was discarded and the pellets were allowed to dry. Acid hydrolysis was carried out on the dried pellet in a Waters Pico-Tag vapor-phase apparatus containing 200 μl of 6 n HCl for 20 h in vacuo at 110 °C. The hydrolyzed samples were resuspended in 50 μl of water mixed with 1 μmol each of ω-NG-monomethylarginine (Sigma product M7033; acetate salt) and asymmetric ω-NG,NG-dimethylarginine (Sigma product D4268; hydrochloride) as standards. Hydrolyzed amino acids and standards were loaded onto a Beckman AA-15 sulfonated polystyrene cation exchange column (0.9 diameter × 11 cm height) that was pre-equilibrated with Na+ citrate buffer (0.35 m in Na+, pH 5.27) at 55 °C and regenerated with 0.2 N NaOH. Approximately 1 ml/min column fractions were collected for analysis. 3H radioactivity was detected by adding 200 μl from each fraction to 400 μl of water, mixing with 5 ml of fluor, and counting on a scintillation counter. Unlabeled methylarginine standards were detected by analyzing 100 μl of every other fraction by a ninhydrin method previously described (21Niewmierzycka A. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 814-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).Subcellular Localization—GFP-PRMT1-(13) and GFP-PRMT8-expressing plasmids were transiently transfected into HeLa cells. After 24 h, the cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde solution in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells then were washed and stained with Texas Red®-X-phalloidin solution (Molecular Probes). Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole solution. Images were captured using a confocal microscope (Nikon), and three-dimensional reconstruction was performed with MetaMorph imaging software (Universal Imaging Corporation).In Vitro Myristoylation—HeLa cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing GFP, GFP-PRMT1, GFP-PRMT8WT, and GFP-PRMT8(G→ A). After 24 h, each plate was labeled with 50 μCi of [9,10 (n)-3H]myristic acid [51 Ci/mmol from a 1 mCi/ml stock solution] (Amersham Biosciences) for 5 h. This labeling is modified from a previously described protocol (22Perez M. Greenwald D.L. de la Torre J.C. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11443-11448Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). After labeling, the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with an anti-GFP antibody (Molecular Probes). The samples were then separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membrane. Myristoylated proteins were visualized by fluorography. Using the same membrane, a Western blot was performed with an anti-GFP antibody (Covance Research Products, Inc.) to make sure each sample had roughly the same amount of immunoprecipitation.Heterodimerization Experiment—The cloning of GFP-PRMT1, GFP-PRMT3, GFP-PRMT4, and GFP-PRMT6 expression plasmids has been described previously (13Frankel A. Yadav N. Lee J. Branscombe T.L. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3537-3543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). These plasmids were individually transiently cotransfected with FLAG-PRMT8-expressing plasmids into HeLa cells. After 24 h, the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma). The beads were washed, boiled, and separated in duplicate on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes. Western blotting was performed with either an anti-GFP antibody (Covance Research Products, Inc.) or an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma).RESULTSCharacterization of a Novel PRMT—The members of the PRMT family all harbor the set of four conserved amino acid sequence motifs (I, post-I, II, and III) common to the seven β-strand methyltransferases (21Niewmierzycka A. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 814-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 23Katz J.E. Dlakic M. Clarke S. Mol. Cell.

A search of the publicly available human genomic, cDNA, and expressed sequence tag (EST) databases revealed a novel PRMT that has not yet been characterized. This PRMT has been annotated in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) data base as hnRNP methyltransferase-like 4 (Hrmt1l4) (NM_019854) and Hrmt1l3 (BK001349). The later sequence has a slightly larger open reading frame. This enzyme shares a high degree of homology (over 80% identity) with the predominant arginine methyltransferase PRMT1 (Fig. 1A).

This N-terminal region is conserved between mouse and man (Fig. 1B), and an orthologue also exists in fish (fuguL3) (25Hung C.M. Li C. Gene. 2004; 340: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This PRMT1-like enzyme has recently been termed PRMT8 (5Bedford M.T. Richard S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 26Boisvert F.M. Chenard C.A. Richard S. Science's STKE. 2005; 271: re2Google Scholar), and we will use this nomenclature. Analysis of DNA databases generated from the human and mouse genome projects reveals that PRMT1 and PRMT8 are localized on different chromosomes. In mouse, mPRMT8 is on chromosome 6 and mPRMT1 is on chromosome 7, and in man, hPRMT8 maps to the subtelomeric region of chromosome 12 and hPRMT1 is on chromosome 19. The exon/intron boundaries of PRMT8 and PRMT1 are identical in both man and mouse, suggesting a recent duplication of an ancestral locus.PRMT8 Is Expressed in Brain Tissue—To determine the expression pattern of PRMT8, Northern analysis was performed using RNA from a number of different human tissues. PRMT8 expression was only detected in the brain as a major transcript of 2.6 kb and two minor transcripts of 2.2 and 2.9 kb (Fig. 2). This same Northern blot has been previously probed with PRMT1 (13Frankel A. Yadav N. Lee J. Branscombe T.L. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3537-3543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Although this stripped Northern blot harbored no residual PRMT1 signal, we do see a faint band at 1.4 kb that corresponds to the size of PRMT1 after probing with PRMT8 cDNA. The cross reactivity of the PRMT8 probe with PRMT1 is not surprising, as they share 81% identity over 420 bp at the RNA level. In addition, a number of ESTs were identified for mouse and human PRMT8, and almost all of these sequences were generated from brain cDNA libraries or pooled libraries that contain brain cDNA. In the case of the mouse, a few ESTs were also seen in cDNA libraries that used eye and retina as a tissue source but in no other tissue. In humans, a few PRMT8 ESTs were also identified in cDNA libraries from lung, testes, nasopharynx, and kidney origin. Furthermore, the laboratory of Austin Smith recently identified PRMT8 (Hrmt1l3) as a transcript that is selectively expressed in neuroepithelial cells (27Aubert J. Stavridis M.P. Tweedie S. O'Reilly M. Vierlinger K. Li M. Ghazal P. Pratt T. Mason J.O. Roy D. Smith A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11836-11841Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This screen made use of Sox1-GFP knock-in mice to isolate neural precursor cells from embryos by flow cytometry. These cells were then used as a source of RNA for microarray analysis, and PRMT8 was identified as one of fifteen transcripts that were selectively expressed in neural progenitor cells from mid-gestation mouse embryos. Thus three independent lines of evidence suggest that PRMT8 is largely an enzyme of the brain: 1) Northern analysis reveals PRMT8 expression in brain and not in other tissues, 2) the majority of PRMT8 ESTs are from brain libraries, and 3) fluorescence-activated cell sorter-purified neural precursor cells initiate PRMT8 expression and identified it as an early marker.FIGURE 2Northern analysis identifies PRMT8 as a brain-specific transcript. The expression level of PRMT8 in various human tissues was examined by hybridization to a multiple tissue Northern blot. The same membrane was probed with β-actin to confirm equal mRNA loading of the Northern blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PRMT8 Has Type I Protein Arginine N-Methyltransferase Activity— To date, four arginine methyltransferases have been shown to possess type I activity, which results in the generation of ω-NG-monomethylarginine and ADMA residues.

To establish whether PRMT8 is active and, if so, what type of activity it possesses, we generated a GST-PRMT8 fusion and assayed its methyltransferase activity using a panel of known arginine-methylated substrates. The substrates tested included GST-GAR, GST-Npl3, and histone H4, which are methylated by PRMT1, PRMT3, and PRMT6 (8Lin W.J. Gary J.D. Yang M.C. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

PRMT8 preferentially methylated histone H4 and the recombinant forms of GAR and Npl3, thus displaying PRMT1-like substrate specificity (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3GST-PRMT8 is a type I protein arginine N-methyltransferase.A, recombinant PRMT8 (1 μg), PRMT1 (1 μg), and CARM1 (1 μg) arginine methyltransferases were incubated with a set of potential substrates (1 μg) in the presence of 0.5 μmS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine for 30 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 30 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. The selected substrates included GST, GST-GAR, GST-Npl3, GST-PABP, and histones H3 and H4.

C, methylation reaction in B was performed on GST-PRMT8 in the absence of the GST-GAR methyl-accepting substrate. Unlabeled asymmetric ω-NG,NG-dimethylarginine and ω-NG-monomethylarginine standards reacted with ninhydrin to produce Ruheman's Purple (open circles) and radioactivity (diamonds) detected using 200 μl of fractions added to 400 μl of water and 5 ml of fluor (Safety Solve, Research Products International) three times for 3 min each.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the type of activity of PRMT8, GST-PRMT8 was assayed for methyltransferase activity using GST-GAR as a substrate. GST-PRMT8 catalyzed the formation of both ω-NG-monomethylarginine and ADMA (Fig. 3B), thus establishing that PRMT8 is a type I enzyme. No obvious automethylation activity is seen for PRMT8 (Fig. 3C). The fact that the catalytic regions of PRMT1 and PRMT8 are extremely similar (Fig. 1A) supports the findings that PRMT8 can methylate PRMT1 substrates in vitro and, similar to PRMT1, it possess Type I activity.PRMT8 Is a Plasma Membrane-associated Enzyme—Arginine methyltransferases have been localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of the cell. PRMT6 and CARM1 are primarily found in the nucleus, whereas PRMT3 and PRMT5 are mostly excluded from the nucleus (13Frankel A. Yadav N. Lee J. Branscombe T.L. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol.

To determine the subcellular localization of PRMT8, we fused it to the N-terminal end of GFP. Due to its high degree of homology to PRMT1, we expected to observe a similar pattern of fluorescence signal. However, to our surprise, GFP-PRMT8 colocalized with phalloidin (Fig. 4A), which binds F-actin, and not with GFP-PRMT1 (Fig. 4B). A different field shows the same plasma membrane-associated pattern of GFP-PRMT8 localization (Fig. 4, C-F), which can be modeled using a three-dimensional rendering program to clearly demonstrate the exclusion of GFP-PRMT8 from both the nuclear and the free cytoplasmic compartments (Fig. 4G).FIGURE 4GFP-PRMT8 localizes to the plasma membrane of the cell.

https://openalex.org/W2060424984,"The circadian clock protein Frequency (FRQ) feedback-regulates its own expression by inhibiting its transcriptional activator, White Collar Complex (WCC). We present evidence that FRQ regulates the bulk of WCC through modulation of its phosphorylation status rather than via direct complex formation. In the absence of FRQ, WCC is hypophosphorylated and transcriptionally active, while WCC is hyperphosphorylated and transcriptionally inactive when FRQ is expressed. The phosphorylation status of WCC changes rhythmically over a circadian cycle. Dephosphorylation and activation of WCC depend on protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and WCC is a substrate of PP2A in vitro. Hypophosphorylated WCC binds to the clock box of the frq promoter even in the presence of FRQ, while binding of hyperphosphorylated WCC is compromised even when FRQ is depleted. We propose that negative feedback in the circadian clock of Neurospora is mediated by FRQ, which rhythmically promotes phosphorylation of WCC, functionally equivalent to a cyclin recruiting cyclin-dependent kinase to its targets."

DNA samples from 59 humans without fatty liver and from 28 humans with NAFLD were genotyped for a single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 8 of PEMT, which leads to a V175M substitution. V175M is a loss of function mutation, as determined by transiently transfecting McArdle-RH7777 cells with constructs of wild-type PEMT open reading frame or the V175M mutant. Met/Met at residue 175 (loss of function SNP) occurred in 67.9% of the NAFLD subjects and in only 40.7% of control subjects (P<0.03). For the first time we report that a polymorphism of the human PEMT gene (V175M) is associated with diminished activity and may confer susceptibility to NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W1997205980,"Polyglutamine diseases are inherited neurodegenerative diseases characterized by misfolding and aggregation of proteins possessing expanded polyglutamine repeats. As overexpression of some heat shock protein (Hsp) suppresses polyglutamine aggregates and cell death, it is assumed that combined overexpression of Hsps will suppress that more effectively. Here, we examined the impact of active forms of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), which induces a set of Hsps, on polyglutamine inclusion formation and disease progression. We found that active HSF1 suppressed polyglutamine inclusion formation more significantly than any combination of Hsps in culture cells, possibly by regulating expression of unknown genes, as well as major Hsps. We crossed R6/2 Huntington disease mice with transgenic mice expressing an active HSF1 (HSF1Tg). Analysis of the skeletal muscle revealed that the polyglutamine inclusion formation and its weight loss were improved in R6/2/HSF1Tg mice. Unexpectedly, the life span of R6/2/HSF1Tg mice was significantly improved, although active HSF1 is not expressed in the brain. These results indicated that active HSF1 has a strong inhibitory effect on polyglutamine aggregate formation in vivo and in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2056682803,"Habit memory is acquired subconsciously and slowly, by trial-and-error. It is more easily studied in animals than in humans, because of our strong tendency to acquire information as conscious (declarative) knowledge. Yet our capacity for unconscious learning is a vital aspect of the human condition, facilitating many routine tasks. Now it can be confirmed that humans do have a robust capacity for habit learning. Two patients with large medial temporal lobe lesions and profound amnesia were asked to acquire a task that is ordinarily learned by conscious memory. They learned gradually, in the way that monkeys learn the same task, and without being aware of what was being learned. The knowledge was rigidly organized, and performance collapsed when the task format was altered. Habit memory is thought to involve slowly acquired associations between stimuli and responses and to depend on the basal ganglia1. Habit memory has been well studied in experimental animals but is poorly understood in humans because of their strong tendency to acquire information as conscious (declarative) knowledge. Here we show that humans have a robust capacity for gradual trial-and-error learning that operates outside awareness for what is learned and independently of the medial temporal lobe. We tested two patients with large medial temporal lobe lesions and no capacity for declarative memory. Both patients gradually acquired a standard eight-pair object discrimination task over many weeks but at the start of each session could not describe the task, the instructions or the objects. The acquired knowledge was rigidly organized, and performance collapsed when the task format was altered."
https://openalex.org/W2143794501,"Prostate apoptosis response 4 (Par-4) is a leucine zipper containing protein that plays a role in apoptosis. Although Par-4 is expressed in neurons, its physiological role in the nervous system is unknown. Here we identify Par-4 as a regulatory component in dopamine signaling. Par-4 directly interacts with the dopamine D2 receptor (D2DR) via the calmodulin binding motif in the third cytoplasmic loop. Calmodulin can effectively compete with Par-4 binding in a Ca2+-dependent manner, providing a route for Ca2+-mediated downregulation of D2DR efficacy. To examine the importance of the Par-4/D2DR interaction in dopamine signaling in vivo, we used a mutant mouse lacking the D2DR interaction domain of Par-4, Par-4ΔLZ. Primary neurons from Par-4ΔLZ embryos exhibit an enhanced dopamine-cAMP-CREB signaling pathway, indicating an impairment in dopamine signaling in these cells. Remarkably, Par-4ΔLZ mice display significantly increased depression-like behaviors. Collectively, these results provide evidence that Par-4 constitutes a molecular link between impaired dopamine signaling and depression."

We show that COMP/TSP5 can support chondrocyte attachment and that the RGD sequence in COMP/TSP5 and the integrin receptors α5β1 and αVβ3 on the chondrocytes are involved in mediating this attachment. The interactions of COMP/TSP5 with the integrins are dependent on COMP/TSP5 conformation.

Under this condition, a function-blocking antibody against αVβ3 did not have any effect on cell attachment. On the other hand, chondrocyte attachment to reduced COMP/TSP5 was instead sensitive to αVβ3 function-blocking antibodies, suggesting that COMP/TSP5 mediates attachment through chondrocyte αVβ3 integrin under this condition. Cell attachment to reduced COMP/TSP5 was not inhibited by β1 antibodies. These data indicate that COMP/TSP5 in different conformations can utilize different integrin receptors.

Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22346-22350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Newton G. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Lawler J. Genomics. 1994; 24: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The presence of the type 2, type 3, and the COOH-terminal domain is the hallmark of the TSPs, and there is a high degree of sequence homology, with an average sequence identity of 60% among the TSPs in their type 3 calcium-binding repeats and the COOH-terminal globular domain (21Adams J.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 22Lawler J. Chen H. Creighton T. Encyclopedia of Molecular Medicine. John Wiley & Sons, Inc, New York, NY2002: 481-484Google Scholar). Studies on TSP1 and TSP2 have shown that that they can function at the interface between the cell surface and the extracellular matrix (21Adams J.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 23Lawler J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 24Chen H. Herndon M.E. Lawler J.

J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Both TSP1 and TSP2 have been shown to be able to support cell attachment through interaction with various cellular receptors including the integrins, and their adhesive activities are subjected to regulation by the calcium binding of the proteins (27Lawler J. Weinstein R. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 28Chen H. Sottile J. O'Rourke K.M. Dixit V.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol.

The RGD sequence, located in the type 3 calcium-binding sequence of TSP1 and TSP2, is active in supporting cell attachment. In TSP1, this RGD sequence is part of a calcium-binding motif, and its accessibility for interaction with integrin is sensitive to the calcium loading as well as disulfide bonding patterns of the protein (30Kvansakul M. Adams J.C. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). There is an RGD sequence located in the type 3 calcium-binding region of COMP/TSP5 from human, bovine, and mouse, but not from rat. Therefore it is unclear if this RGD sequence is active. Although immunohistochemical data and COMP/TSP5 mutations in pseudoachondroplasia and MED/EDM1 suggest that COMP/TSP5 is important in connective tissues, its precise functional role remains unclear. Of the major components of cartilage, it has been reported that COMP/TSP5 can interact with collagen in a zinc-dependent fashion via its COOH-terminal domain (17Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P.

Although sequence homology with TSP1 and TSP2 suggest that COMP/TSP5 may interact with cell surface receptors, COMP/TSP5 has not been found to be a good adhesive substrate for chondrocytes (19Oldberg A.

Mann K. Paulsson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 927-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, these studies utilized COMP isolated from the native tissues that required either strong denaturant or EDTA for purification. According to previous studies (16Chen H. Deere M. Hecht J.T. Lawler J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26538-26544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 17Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegard D. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6083-6092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we postulate that these treatment may have rendered the purified COMP in a denatured conformation and thus may not reflect its functions. Therefore, we have decided to reassess COMP function using recombinant COMP that was expressed into a culture supernatant and purified under the native condition in the presence of calcium (16Chen H. Deere M. Hecht J.T. Lawler J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26538-26544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this paper we intend to investigate whether COMP/TSP5 has the ability to interact with chondrocyte and, if so, determine the cell surface receptors that are responsible for the interaction. Our data show that COMP/TSP5 can function to bind chondrocytes to support cellular attachment through interaction with cell surface integrins. We further show that the conformation of COMP/TSP5 influences its adhesive activity as well as the integrin receptors it recognizes. Our results suggest that COMP/TSP5 can mediate chondrocyte-extracellular matrix interaction; through this interaction COMP/TSP5 has the potential to regulate chondrocyte cellular activities as well as its phenotypic development. Protein and Reagents—Human recombinant COMP/TSP5 or its mutant MUT3 were produced using a mammalian expression system and purified as reported previously (16Chen H. Deere M. Hecht J.T. Lawler J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26538-26544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). GRGDSP and GRGESP peptides were from Peninsula Laboratories, Inc. (Belmont, CA). Mouse IgG control was from Sigma. Monoclonal antibodies against the integrin α1 or α2 subunit were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The monoclonal antibody ASC-1 against α3 subunit was from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). The monoclonal antibody against α6 (4F10) was from Biodesign (Kennebunk, ME). The monoclonal antibodies against the α5 subunit were mAb16 from BD Biosciences and P1D6 from Chemicon. The monoclonal antibodies against the β1 subunit were P4C10 from Invitrogen, B3B11 from Chemicon, and 4B4 from Coulter Corporation (Miami, FL). The monoclonal antibody JBS5 against α5β1 was from Serotec Ltd. (Oxford, UK). Antibodies that contained azide when purchased were dialyzed against HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) with 1 mm CaCl2 (HBS/C) using a Slide-A-Lyzer MINI dialysis unit (Pierce). Cells—Primary human juvenile costochondral chondrocytes were isolated and cultured as described previously (5Hecht J.T. Deere M. Putnam E. Cole W. Vertel B. Chen H. Lawler J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Immortalized human juvenile costochondral chondrocytes (T/C-28a4) were derived from the originally reported SV40-TAg-immortalized T/C-28a2 lines (35Goldring M.B. Birkhead J.R. Suen L.F. Yamin R. Mizuno S. Glowacki J. Arbiser J.L. Apperley J.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 94: 2307-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) after two additional passages through suspension culture over agarose. The T/C-28a4 chondrocyte cell line expresses type II collagen, aggrecan, and biglycan mRNAs, but low or undetectable levels of decorin and versican mRNAs (36Kokenyesi R. Tan L. Robbins J.R. Goldring M.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These cells continue to express sox9, indicating that they are chondrocytes in nature (38Finger F. Schorle C. Zien A. Gebhard P. Goldring M.B. Aigner T. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 3395-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, expression of extracellular matrix proteins decreases after continuous culture in serum-containing medium compared with normal chondrocytes in primary monolayer culture (36Kokenyesi R.

A clonal expansion of this cell line, TC1a, was used for the attachment assays described in this paper. Monolayer TC1a cells were cultured in 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell Attachment Assays—To prepare cells for attachment assays, monolayer TC1a or primary chondrocyte cells grown in 10-cm tissue culture plates were washed twice with HBS and treated with 1 ml of 0.1 mg/ml tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin in HBS (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) at 37 °C for 5 min. Trypsinization was stopped with 2 ml of 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) in HBS/C. Cells were flushed off the plate as a single cell suspension, sedimented, and washed twice with trypsin inhibitor solution followed by two more washes with HBS/C. Subsequently, cells were resuspended in HBS/C containing 1% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin at a final concentration of 2–2.5 × 105 cells/ml. Immulon II 96-well plates (Dynex, Chantilly, VA) were coated with COMP/TSP5 at various concentrations in HBS/C or HBS containing 5 mm EDTA at 4 °C overnight. The plates were then blocked with 1% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin in HBS/C or HBS containing 5 mM EDTA, respectively, for 30 min at 37 °C. Where indicated, wells coated in EDTA were reduced with 20 mm dithiothreitol in HBS containing 5 mM EDTA for 30 min at room temperature. Wells were washed four times with HBS/C before the addition of 100 μl of cells to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37°C.At the end of the incubation and after examination under phase-contrast microscopy, the plate was washed three times with HBS/C. The number of cells attached to each well was quantified using a CyQuant kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). In studies where various reagents including antibodies were used, the wells were coated with 5 μg/ml COMP/TSP5. The reagent was incubated with cells for 30 min at room temperature with mild agitation before transfer of cells to the wells. Attachment was carried out as described above. Integrin Profiling—Primary chondrocyte cell surface proteins were surface-labeled with biotin using a protein biotinylation system per the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Biosciences). The cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, with a protease inhibitor mixture for 60 min at 4 °C. Detergent insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. After preclearing with mouse IgG and protein G-Sepharose, the cell lysate was incubated with specific integrin antibodies in the presence of protein G-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitated integrins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to a piece of nitrocellulose membrane. The biotin-labeled integrins were visualized by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin incubation followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection. We first used the chondrocyte-derived cell line TC1a to test whether COMP/TSP5 is an adhesive protein for chondrocytes. Chondrocytes grown in monolayer systems were used for short-term attachment assays. For the attachment assays, cells were allowed to adhere to 96-well plates that were coated with recombinant COMP/TSP5 or MUT3 at various concentrations. Based on our previous results showing that COMP/TSP5 is a calcium-binding protein and that calcium influences the conformation of COMP/TSP5 protein (16Chen H. Deere M. Hecht J.T. Lawler J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26538-26544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the conformation of COMP/TSP5 also affected its ability to support the chondrocyte attachment. For this purpose, we coated COMP/TSP5 or MUT3 in the presence of either calcium or EDTA. All attachment assays were performed in the presence of 2 mm calcium ions regardless of the protein-coating conditions. Attached cells were quantified using CyQuant (Molecular Probes). In our preliminary studies we have shown that fluorescence readings were linearly proportional to the number of cells. Typically ∼70% of the cells initially added to the wells remained at the end of the attachment assay under our conditions unless inhibitors were used. For TC1a cells grown in monolayer, COMP/TSP5 in a calcium-replete conformation supported cell attachment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). At protein-coating concentrations of 5 μg/ml and higher the cells also spread on the protein-coated wells (Fig. 2). Treating cells 2 h before and during cell attachment assay with cycloheximide did not affect cell attachment, suggesting that in this short-term assay protein synthesis is not required for the attachment of cells to COMP/TSP5 (Fig. 3). Treating COMP/TSP5 with calcium or EDTA without reduction had no obvious effect on attachment of the TC1a cells grown in a monolayer (Fig. 1A). MUT3 also supported TC1a cell attachment, and treating MUT3 with EDTA before coating did not affect cell attachment significantly (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that the removal of calcium from wild type COMP/TSP5 (Fig. 1A) or MUT3 (Fig. 1B) does not affect the capacity to bind to chondrocytes cultured in a monolayer compared with the calcium-replete condition.FIGURE 2Morphology of TC1a attached to COMP/TSP5. TC1a cells were allowed to attach to COMP/TSP5 coated at the indicated concentrations in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 (COMP/C) or 5 mm EDTA followed by reduction (COMP/R). FN coated at 10 μg/ml (FN) or heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin (BSA) coated at the same concentration was used as control.

Reduction of TSP1 and TSP2 helps to expose the RGD sequences that are possibly cryptic inside the complex intracellular disulfide bonds within the type 3 calcium-binding repeats (28Chen H. Sottile J. O'Rourke K.M. Dixit V.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32226-32232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Sun X. Skorstengaard K. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We wished to determine whether this holds true for COMP/TSP5 because of the high degree of homology in the type 3 repeats among all TSPs and the presence of the RGD sequence in human COMP/TSP5. To test this hypothesis, we reduced the coated calcium-depleted COMP/TSP5 or MUT3 with the reducing reagent dithiothreitol before adding the cells for attachment. Indeed, reduction of either wild type COMP/TSP5 or MUT3 (protein/R in Fig. 1, A and B, respectively) after coating increased cell attachment, especially in wells coated with low concentrations, 1 μg/ml or less, of COMP/TSP5 or MUT3. Cells attached to and spread on dithiothreitol-treated COMP/TSP5 coated at 1 μg/ml (Fig. 2). In addition to immortalized chondrocytes, we have also tested whether COMP/TSP5 can support the attachment of primary chondrocytes. For this purpose, juvenile costochondral chondrocytes were used for short-term attachment assays as above, and we observed similar results (data not shown). To investigate the nature of the interaction between COMP/TSP5 and chondrocytes, sequences on COMP/TSP5 that mediate the attachment were studied. An RGD sequence is located in the type 3 calcium-binding repeats of COMP/TSP5. We assessed whether the RGD sequence is active. For this purpose, we included a peptide containing RGD in the attachment assay (GRGDSP). A peptide containing the RGE sequence (GRGESP) was used as control. COMP/TSP5 was coated either in the presence of calcium or in the presence of EDTA followed by reduction. Under both conditions, the RGD peptide was able to inhibit the attachment of primary chondrocytes to COMP/TSP5 in a RGD peptide concentration-dependent manner, whereas the RGE peptide had no significant effect (Fig. 4). These data suggest that COMP/TSP5 can support chondrocyte attachment, at least in part, via its RGD sequence. The inhibitory effect of RGD suggests that the cells interact with COMP/TSP5 via cell surface integrins. To determine the integrin receptor expression on the primary human chondrocytes used in our experiments, we performed cell surface biotin labeling followed by immunoprecipitation with specific integrin antibodies. Our results showed that primary chondrocytes expressed integrins including α3β1 and α1β1 (not shown) as well as αVβ3 and those that contain α5 and α6 subunits in smaller amounts (Fig. 5). Similarly, integrins containing the β1 subunit and those that contain the α5 and α6 subunits, as well as α3β1 and αVβ3, were also found to be expressed by the TC1a cells (data not shown). The lack of any precipitated bands with control mouse IgG indicated the stringency of our immunoprecipitation studies. The existence of more than one band in a lane indicates the presen"
https://openalex.org/W1972844374,"Germ cells must develop along distinct male or female paths to produce the sperm or eggs required for sexual reproduction. In both mouse and Drosophila, the sexual identity of germ cells is influenced by the sex of the surrounding somatic tissue (for example, refs 1, 2, reviewed in refs 3, 4); however, little is known about how the soma controls germline sex determination. Here we show that the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway provides a sex-specific signal from the soma to the germ line in Drosophila embryonic gonads. The somatic gonad expresses a JAK/STAT ligand, unpaired (upd), in a male-specific manner, and activates the JAK/STAT pathway in male germ cells at the time of gonad formation. Furthermore, the JAK/STAT pathway is necessary for male-specific germ cell behaviour during early gonad development, and is sufficient to activate aspects of male germ cell behaviour in female germ cells. Our findings provide direct evidence that the JAK/STAT pathway mediates a key signal from the somatic gonad that regulates male germline sexual development."

https://openalex.org/W2083232552,"Collagen VIII is localized in subendothelial and subepithelial extracellular matrices. It is a major component of Descemet's membrane, a thick basement membrane under the corneal endothelium, where it forms a hexagonal lattice structure; a similar structure, albeit less extensive, may be formed in other basement membranes. We have examined the function of collagen VIII in mice by targeted inactivation of the genes encoding the two polypeptide subunits, Col8a1 and Col8a2. Analysis of these mice reveals no major structural defects in most organs, but demonstrates that type VIII collagen is required for normal anterior eye development, particularly the formation of a corneal stroma with the appropriate number of fibroblastic cell layers and Descemet's membrane of appropriate thickness. Complete lack of type VIII collagen leads to dysgenesis of the anterior segment of the eye: a globoid, keratoglobus-like protrusion of the anterior chamber with a thin corneal stroma. Descemet's membrane is markedly thinned. The corneal endothelial cells are enlarged and reduced in number, and show a decreased ability to proliferate in response to different growth factors in vitro. An important function of collagen VIII may therefore be to generate a peri- or subcellular matrix environment that permits or stimulates cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2133474267,"Numerous studies support the notion that an activation of sphingomyelinases and a subsequent increase of the concentration of the bioactive lipid mediator ceramide are critical in the concert of inflammatory stimuli and to the induction of apoptosis during inflammation. Here we show that patients with severe sepsis exhibit an enhanced sphingolytic activity in comparison with controls [262 pmol/(mlxh) vs. 123.6 pmol/(mlxh), P<0.005]. During the clinical course, a further increase was paralleled by the severity of illness and by fatal outcome. Moreover, we show that oxidative stress may partially account for the increased activity through posttranslational modification of the enzyme. In a murine endotoxic shock model, administration of a low molecular weight inhibitor diminished the rise in enzymatic activity and improved the survival rate. In liver specimen, inhibition of activity correlated with a reduced rate of hepato-cellular apoptosis. Our data support the concept that activation of the plasmatic isoform of sphingomyelinase may play a critical role in the development of apoptosis and organ failure in sepsis. An inhibition of the secreted isoform of sphingomyelinase should be explored further as a potential target in the complicated puzzle of sepsis."

GITR (glucocorticoid-induced TNFR family-related gene), a costimulatory molecule for T lymphocytes, increases CD4+CD25- effector T cell activation while inhibiting suppressor activity of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory (Treg) cells. We analyzed the role of GITR in type II collagen (CII) -induced arthritis (CIA) using GITR-/- and GITR+/+ mice. Results indicate significantly less CIA induction in GITR-/- mice than in GITR+/+ mice, with marked differences in erythema, edema, neutrophil infiltration, joint injury, and bone erosion. Production of IFNgamma, IL-6, TNFalpha, MIP-1alpha, and MIP-2, inducible NOS (iNOS), COX-2, and nitrotyrosine poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) were also less in CII-treated GITR-/- mice. Although CD4+CD25+ Treg cells from GITR+/+ and GITR-/- CII-challenged mice exerted similar suppressor activity in vitro, GITR triggering abrogated GITR+/+ Treg suppressor activity and costimulated CD4+CD25- GITR+/+ effector cells. Furthermore, Treg cells from GITR-/- protected more than Treg cells from GITR+/+ mice against CIA when cotransferred with Treg-depleted splenocytes from arthritic GITR+/+ animals into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. In conclusion, GITR plays a critical role in the immunological response against CII and in the development of CIA."

Defects in COG function can cause abnormalities in glycoconjugate synthesis, intracellular protein sorting, protein secretion, and, in some cases, cell growth. In mammalian Cog1 (ldlB cells) or Cog2 (ldlC cells) null Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutants, multiple Golgi cisternae are dilated (24Ungar D. Oka T. Brittle E.E. Vasile E. Lupashin V.V. Chatterton J.E. Heuser J.E. Krieger M. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and there are pleiotropic defects in a number of medial- and trans-Golgi-associated reactions affecting virtually all N-, O-, and lipid-linked glycoconjugates (12Kingsley D.M. Kozarsky K.F. Segal M. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1576-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The pleiotropy and heterogeneity of the glycosylation defects suggested that COG influences the regulation, compartmentalization, or activity of multiple Golgi glycosylation enzymes and/or their substrate transporters without substantially disrupting secretion or endocytosis (12Kingsley D.M. Kozarsky K.F. Segal M. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1576-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 33Reddy P. Krieger M. Mol. Cell.

Because the activities of many glycosylation-related proteins depend on their proper intra-Golgi localization and appropriate intralumenal environments (7Roth J. Chem.

Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 15-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was proposed that COG might play a role directly or indirectly in resident Golgi proteins' transport to, retention at, or retrieval to appropriate sites, or that it might otherwise determine the Golgi's structure and/or lumenal environment (12Kingsley D.M. Kozarsky K.F. Segal M. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1576-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 43Oka T. Ungar D. Hughson F.M. Krieger M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2423-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This proposal was supported by the finding that a subset of Golgi type II membrane proteins, called GEARs, is mislocalized and/or abnormally rapidly degraded in Cog1- and Cog2-deficient CHO mutants (43Oka T. Ungar D. Hughson F.M. Krieger M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2423-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As expected from the analysis of the CHO cell mutants, a mutation in a gene encoding one of the human COG subunits (COG7) has been shown to be responsible for a rare form of lethal congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) (44Wu X. Steet R.A. Bohorov O. Bakker J. Newell J. Krieger M. Spaapen L. Kornfeld S. Freeze H.H. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In the mutant fibroblasts from the Cog7-deficient patients, which exhibit global glycosylation defects less severe than those in the Cog1 and Cog2 null CHO cells, trafficking of a Golgi-localized glycosylation enzyme, Galβ1, 3GalNAc α2,3-sialyltransferase, is impaired (44Wu X. Steet R.A. Bohorov O. Bakker J. Newell J. Krieger M. Spaapen L. Kornfeld S. Freeze H.H. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Abnormal Golgi-associated glycosylation also has been reported in yeast mutants with defects in COG subunits (22Whyte J.R.C. Munro S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 527-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 29Conde R. Pablo G. Cueva R. Larriba G.

FEMS Yeast Res. 2004; 4: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), as has the mislocalization of two yeast Golgi mannosyltransferases, Och1p and Mnn1p, in cog3 mutants (31Bruinsma P. Spelbrink R.G. Nothwehr S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39814-39823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition to the global glycosylation defects, yeast cog5 mutants have shown a temperature-sensitive defect in mating projection (28Bidlingmaier S. Snyder M. Funt. Integr. Genomics. 2002; 1: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting that yeast Cog5 is involved in polarized cell growth. It is, therefore, striking that loss of Cog5 function in D. melanogaster causes failure of spermatogenesis and male sterility but no other overt gross abnormal phenotypes (32Farkas R.M. Giansanti M.G. Gatti M. Fuller M.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It is clear that the COG complex plays an important role in controlling multiple aspects of intracellular function from yeast to humans, although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying COG activities have not been elucidated. Biochemical and genetic studies in yeast and mammalian systems led to the proposal that COG is composed of two lobes, each containing four distinct subunits, lobe A (Cog1–4) and lobe B (Cog5–8), (24Ungar D. Oka T. Brittle E.E. Vasile E. Lupashin V.V. Chatterton J.E. Heuser J.E. Krieger M. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 45Whyte J.R. Munro S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2627-2637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast, deletion of any one of the four lobe A subunits causes a severe growth defect, whereas disruption of the remaining genes (COG5–8) does not substantially interfere with normal cell growth (22Whyte J.R.C. Munro S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 527-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic images of the COG complex purified from bovine brain reveal a bilobed structure with two similarly sized globular domains connected by small extensions (24Ungar D. Oka T. Brittle E.E. Vasile E. Lupashin V.V. Chatterton J.E. Heuser J.E. Krieger M. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). A recent in vitro translation and co-immunoprecipitation study also supports this model of COG structure (Ref. 46Loh E. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24640-24648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, see below for further discussion). When the mammalian COG complex was initially purified and characterized and the two-lobed low resolution model of its architecture proposed (24Ungar D. Oka T. Brittle E.E. Vasile E. Lupashin V.V. Chatterton J.E. Heuser J.E. Krieger M. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), the only four antibodies available for analyzing the complex recognized Cog1, 2, 3, and 5. The subsequent generation of additional anti-COG antibodies (43Oka T. Ungar D. Hughson F.M. Krieger M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2423-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) that recognize all eight COG subunits and the identification of human Cog7-deficient CDG fibroblasts (44Wu X. Steet R.A. Bohorov O. Bakker J. Newell J. Krieger M. Spaapen L. Kornfeld S. Freeze H.H. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) provide powerful new tools for the analysis of COG structure and function. Here, we have used these reagents and generated stable Cog5-deficient human HeLa cell lines using the RNA interference technique (57Novina C.D. Sharp P.A. Nature. 2004; 430: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar) to further explore the structure and function of COG. These studies suggest that the Cog1 and Cog8 subunits play important roles in assembling Cog2–4 and Cog5–7 subcomplexes into the intact, Golgi-associated COG complex. They also emphasize the distinct structural and functional roles of the Cog5 and Cog7 subunits. Materials—Reagents and sources were: ECL Plus detection kit (Amersham Biosciences), Alexa 488-conjugated peanut lectin (Molecular Probes), Ham's F-12 (Invitrogen), RPMI1640 medium (Invitrogen), concanavalin A, wheat germ agglutinin, and phytohemagglutinin (Sigma). The following antibodies for immunoblotting and immunofluorescence experiments were used as described previously (43Oka T. Ungar D. Hughson F.M. Krieger M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2423-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar): anti-Cog1(LDLB) antibody, anti-GS15 antibody, anti-GOS-28 antibody, anti-golgin-84 antibody, anti-GM130 antibody, anti-Vit1a antibody, anti-Bet1 antibody, and anti-Sec8 antibody (BD Biosciences), anti-GPP130 antibody (Covance), anti-low density lipoprotein receptor (C7) monoclonal antibody (Maine Biotechnology Services, Inc.) Anti-CASP antiserum and anti-Cog3 antisera were gifts from Dr. S. Munro (Medical Research Council, Cambridge, UK) and Dr. V. V. Lupashin (University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences), respectively. Antibodies against Cog1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 were generated as described previously (13Podos S.D. Reddy P. Ashkenas J. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Walter D.M. Paul K.S. Waters M.G. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were carried out with the indicated antibodies at the concentrations described previously (43Oka T. Ungar D. Hughson F.M. Krieger M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2423-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Signals were detected using the ECL Plus detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gel Filtration—Cytosol fractions were prepared from CHO, ldlB, and ldlC cells and analyzed by gel filtration chromatography with a Superose 6 column. Samples in the fractions were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with anti-COG subunit antibodies. Construction of pcDNA U6-COG5—The siRNA expression vector pcDNA3.1-U6-Zeo includes the U6 promoter with the addition of an ApaI site at the transcription start site. It was digested with ApaI, blunted, and digested with EcoRI. The following oligomers were used: 5′-CTACAGTCCGGGAACTTCTTTCAAGAGAAGAAGTTCCCGGACTGTAGTTTTTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-AATTCAAAAACTACAGTCCGGGAACTTCTTCTCTTGAAAGAAGTTCCCGGACTGTAG-3′ (antisense). The annealed oligomers were cloned into the digested pcDNA3.1-U6-Zeo to construct pcDNAU6-COG5. Cell Culture—Wild type CHO, ldlB, ldlC, ldlB[COG1], and ldlC[COG2] cells were cultured as described previously (13Podos S.D. Reddy P. Ashkenas J. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Chatterton J.E. Hirsch D. Schwartz J.J. Bickel P.E. Rosenberg R.D. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Human fibroblast and the COG7 mutant (P1) cells were maintained as described (44Wu X. Steet R.A. Bohorov O. Bakker J. Newell J. Krieger M. Spaapen L. Kornfeld S. Freeze H.H. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were cultured at 37 °C in medium A (RPMI1640 supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection and Establishment of Stable Cog5 Knockdown Cells—HeLa cells were transfected with the pcDNAU6-COG5 plasmid using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and colonies were selected in medium B (medium A including 0.2–0.4 mg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen)). In two independent transfections, three individual colonies (kd-COG5#1, #2, and #3) were isolated, grown to mass culture, and used for further experiments. The relative decreases of Cog5 were determined by immunoblotting using a dilution series of cell lysates from wild type cells and the three individual colonies. Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, and stained with the indicated antibodies as described previously (24Ungar D. Oka T. Brittle E.E. Vasile E. Lupashin V.V. Chatterton J.E. Heuser J.E. Krieger M. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 43Oka T. Ungar D. Hughson F.M. Krieger M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2423-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were suspended in buffer A (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, and 125 mm magnesium acetate) supplemented with Complete™ EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), disrupted by passing 30 times through a 30-gauge needle with a 5-ml syringe, and then clarified by centrifugation (∼20,000 × g, 10min, 4 °C). The resultant supernatant was further subjected to ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C). The protein concentration of the cytosol fraction was determined using BCA protein assays (Pierce). For immunoprecipitations, 5 μg of the indicated monoclonal antibody were added to 400 μg of cytosol from either HeLa or kd-COG5#1 cells in buffer B (phosphate-buffered saline with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After further incubation with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences), the mixture was washed four times with buffer B and then once with phosphate-buffered saline. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated anti-COG subunit antibodies. Peanut Lectin Staining—Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized with 0.2% saponin. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with 1–5 μg/ml of PNA-Alexa488 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Images were collected with a Nikon Eclipse TE200 microscope and RT Spot CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). Electron Microscopy—Wild type and Cog5 knockdown HeLa cells were grown on plastic culture dishes. Cells were rapidly rinsed with Dulbecco's complete phosphate-buffered saline (containing calcium and magnesium), fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% formaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate-HCl, pH 7.2, for 60 min at 4 °C, and postfixed with 2% osmium tetraoxide for 60 min at 4 °C, followed by dehydration in graded alcohol up to 70% and en block staining with uranyl acetate in 70% alcohol for 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were then processed for epon embedding. Thin epon sections (∼400 nm) were cut with a diamond knife, poststained with uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate, and viewed with a Philips 400 electron microscope operated at 80 kV. Characterization of the COG Subunits in ldlB and ldlC Cells—Previous studies using biochemical purification, somatic cell mutants, and antibodies to the Cog1–3 and Cog5 subunits suggested that in wild type mammalian cells and tissues the COG complex is composed of eight polypeptide chains (Cog1–8) that form two lobes (lobe A (Cog1–4) and lobe B (Cog5–8)) and that a smaller subcomplex that contains Cog5, but not Cog1–3, is also present (Fig. 1D). We have extended those earlier studies using a set of antibodies that recognizes all eight COG subunits. Fig. 1 shows an immunoblotting analysis of a total cell lysate (panel A, lane 1) and size fractionation of cytosol from wild type CHO cells (panel B, left) for all eight COG subunits. The Golgi-associated protein GM130 is included in panel A as a loading control. All eight subunits co-eluted in a large complex (panel B, left, open triangle, centered in fractions 21 and 22; asterisk indicates an apparently unrelated protein that cross-reacts with the anti-Cog4 antibody). In addition, Cog5–7 and Cog8 co-eluted in what appear to be distinct, smaller complexes (solid triangle, centered in fractions 24 and 25 in CHO cells), consistent with our previous findings (24Ungar D. Oka T. Brittle E.E. Vasile E. Lupashin V.V. Chatterton J.E. Heuser J.E. Krieger M. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In light of additional findings using Cog1 (ldlB)- and Cog2 (ldlC)-deficient cells described below, we propose that the Cog5–7 subunits form a subcomplex that does not contain the Cog1–4 subunits and that some portion of this subcomplex associates with Cog8. This Cog5–7 plus Cog8 subcomplex apparently corresponds to the Cog5-containing subcomplex previously isolated from bovine brain (Refs. 24Ungar D. Oka T. Brittle E.E. Vasile E. Lupashin V.V.

It is noteworthy that in CHO, as well as ldlB and ldlC, cells a small amount of Cog7 was always found without the other COG subunits in fractions 27–29, in which proteins larger than Cog7 monomers are expected to elute (18Chatterton J.E.

This raises the possibility that Cog7 may independently form an oligomer or form a complex with other as yet unidentified proteins. We also examined the remaining COG subunits and subcomplexes in Cog1 (ldlB)- and Cog2 (ldlC)-deficient CHO cell mutants (12Kingsley D.M. Kozarsky K.F. Segal M. Krieger M. J.

A key role of their kinase activity has been confirmed by mutant kinase inactive receptors that shift the cellular response from repulsion to adhesion. Our present study aimed to investigate the role of low molecular weight protein-tyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTP) in ephrinA1/EphA2 signaling.

The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands, ephrins, constitute the largest receptor tyrosine kinase subfamily, with at least 16 receptors and 9 ligands (1Dodelet V.C. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5614-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 2Kullander K. Klein R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar) (cbweb.med.harvard.edu/eph-nomenclature). So far, several biological functions have been attributed to Eph receptors including cell positioning, vascular development, tissue border formation, branching morphogenesis, cell migration, and axon guidance (2Kullander K. Klein R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). In any case, the influence on cell behavior of ligand-induced Eph receptor activation can generally be related to repulsion of neighboring cells or of cellular processes, such as neuronal growth cone (3Wilkinson D.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) or vasculogenesis (4Holder N. Klein R. Development. 1999; 126: 2033-2044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Engagement with an ephrin induces a conformational change in the cytoplasmic portion of the Eph receptor triggered by phosphorylation of two juxtamembrane tyrosines (5Wybenga-Groot L.E. Baskin B.

Occupancy of the juxtamembrane binding sites and additional phosphorylation may further stabilize the active conformation of the Eph receptor, thereby stimulating the activity of the kinase domain.

Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar). Both Eph kinases and ephrins have been implicated in tumor growth and angiogenesis. They have been found to be overexpressed in many human tumors (8Kiyokawa E. Takai S. Tanaka M. Iwase T. Suzuki M. Xiang Y.Y. Naito Y. Yamada K. Sugimura H. Kino I.

Tech. 2002; 59: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Elevated EphA2 levels are observed in many dissimilar types of cancers, including breast, prostate, and colon carcinomas, as well as in aggressive melanomas (13Easty D.J. Herlyn M. Bennett D.C. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 60: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14Zelinski D.P. Zantek N.D. Stewart J.C. Irizarry A.R. Kinch M.S.

Prostate. 1999; 41: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In addition, ectopic overexpression of EphA2 is sufficient to grant tumorigenic and metastatic potential upon nontransformed epithelial cells (14Zelinski D.P. Zantek N.D. Stewart J.C. Irizarry A.R. Kinch M.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2301-2306PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, the presence within the same cell of kinase-inactive in concert with wild-type Eph receptors transforms its outcome to ephrins from repulsion to adhesion (16Holmberg J. Clarke D.L. Frisen J. Nature. 2000; 408: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), suggesting that net levels of Eph kinase tyrosine phosphorylation determine the response to ephrin contact. Although phosphorylation is thought to be an important event in the Eph receptor signaling process, the specific role of Eph kinase activity and of associated phosphatases remains to be elucidated. Emerging evidence suggests that protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are involved in regulating Eph-mediated responses (17Chiarugi P. Taddei M.L. Schiavone N. Papucci L. Giannoni E. Fiaschi T. Capaccioli S. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3905-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18Erdmann K.S. Eur. J.

Cell. 2002; 9: 725-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Recruitment of low molecular weight (LMW)-PTP to ephrinB1-activated EphB2 is important for endothelial capillary-like assembly and adhesion (21Stein E. Lane A.A. Cerretti D.P. Schoecklmann H.O. Schroff A.D. Van Etten R.L. Daniel T.O. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In addition, LMW-PTP is frequently overexpressed in transformed cells, and its ectopic overexpression is sufficient to confer transformation in epithelial cells (22Kikawa K.D. Vidale D.R. Van Etten R.L. Kinch M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39274-39279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), thus suggesting a role for LMW-PTP in transformation progression. Although recent data suggest that LMW-PTP in vivo is a positive regulator of both tumor onset and development and that the oncogenic potential of the phosphatase is linked to EphA2 (17Chiarugi P. Taddei M.L. Schiavone N. Papucci L. Giannoni E. Fiaschi T. Capaccioli S. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3905-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the specific role of this phosphatase in the modulation of the ephrin-mediated cellular response is still unknown. Herein we demonstrate that LMW-PTP negatively regulates the repulsive response elicited by ephrinA1 through dephosphorylation of EphA2 kinase, thereby confirming the relevance of the net level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Eph receptors. Our results identify LMW-PTP as a negative regulator of the activated EphA2 kinase, ultimately interfering with ephrin-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling through a negative feedback loop. Materials—Unless otherwise specified all reagents were obtained from Sigma. PC3 and HEK-293T cells were purchased from ATCC. Recombinant mouse Fc and ephrinA1-Fc chimera from were from R&D Systems. Anti-MAPK, antiphosphotyrosine (clone 4G10), and anti-EphA2 antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Anti-phospho-MAPK antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology, and anti-p120RasGAP was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that are wild type or null for p120RasGAP were kindly supplied by Tony Pawson (Toronto, Canada). Cell Culture and Stimulation—PC3 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium; MEFs and HEK-293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 10% fetal calf serum was added to all media, and all cells were maintained in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. For studies using soluble ephrinA1, cells in logarithmic growth phase were always stimulated with 1 μg ml-1 Fc or ephrinA1-Fc for the indicated times. Cloning of Human Eph Receptor—On the basis of the human EphA2 BLAST sequence (M59371) we synthesized the primers for reverse transcription-PCR: upstream primer, 5′-ATGGAGCTCCAGGCAGCCCG-3′; and downstream primer, 5′-TCAGATGGGGATCCCCACAGT-3′. Total RNA was isolated from PC3 cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and the amplification was performed using SuperScript One-step reverse transcription-PCR for long templates (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amplified sequence was subcloned into pLargeT vector (Promega). The double mutant EphA2 receptor was obtained using a QuikChange XL Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The original tyrosines in positions 588 and 594 have been replaced with phenylalanine. DNA Transfection—8 μg of pRcCMV-wtLMW-PTP or pEGFP-wtLMW-PTP, in which wild-type LMW-PTP has been cloned upstream of the ATG-deleted EGFP gene of the pEGFP-N1 vector (23Giannoni E. Cirri P. Paoli P. Fiaschi T. Camici G. Manao G. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 3: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), or the wild-type and mutant EphA2 kinase in pLargeT vector, were transiently transfected in PC3 or in HEK-293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection cells were recovered for analyses. Short Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfections—LMW-PTP siRNA (5′-AAGTCCGTGCTGTTTGTGTGT-3′), p120RasGAP siRNA (5′-AAACTGCCCACTTCGTTGCTT-3′), and a negative control siRNA sequence corresponding to nucleotides 695–715 of the firefly luciferase (U31240) were obtained from Qiagen. PC3 cells plated at 3 × 105/dish were transfected with siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 as described by the manufacturer. Cells were transfected with 4 μg of siRNA/60-mm dish. siRNA efficiency was tested by anti-LMW-PTP immunoblot; although at 48 h we detected an appreciable inhibition of LMW-PTP expression, the best efficiency was observed 72 h after transfection. Cell Adhesion onto EphrinA1-Fc-coated Slides—Coverslips were treated with 2% collagen in PBS for 15 min and then washed extensively with PBS and air dried. After that, the slides were coated with 1 μg/ml ephrinA1-Fc for 1 h at room temperature and then washed twice with 2% bovine serum albumin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 1.2 × 105 cells were seeded in each coverslip, and adhesion was permitted for 15 min, 30 min, and 1 h. Negative controls were performed by seeding cells onto collagen-coated and ephrinA1 noncoated coverslips. Afterward an immunohistochemistry assay was performed using phalloidin-TRITC. Clonal Cell Growth Assay—200 cells were plated in triplicate directly onto 6- or 12-well cell culture dishes in the presence of Fc or ephrinA1-Fc; media were changed every 3 days. Cellular growth was stopped after 7–10 days in culture by removing the medium and by the addition of a 0.5% crystal violet solution in 20% methanol. After staining for 5 min the fixed cells were washed with PBS and solubilized with 200 μl/well 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 4.2. The absorbance at 595 nm was evaluated using a microplate reader. In Vitro Three-dimensional Migration Assay—The in vitro motility assays were carried out with the Costar Transwell system, equipped with 8-μm pore polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filters (diameter, 13 mm). The Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was diluted (30 μg in 100 μl of H2O), added to the top chamber, allowed to gel for 1 h at 37 °C,air dried for 16 h, and the Matrigel barrier was reconstituted with 100 μlof medium for 2 h at 37°C before use. Cells were loaded to the upper compartment (5 × 104 cells in 300 μl) in serum-deprived growth medium with or without 1 μg ml-1 ephrinA1. The Matrigel invasion chambers were placed into 6-well culture dishes containing 1 ml of medium with 20% serum as chemoattractant. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, noninvading cells and the Matrigel layer were removed mechanically using cotton swabs, and the microporous membrane containing the invaded cells was fixed in 96% methanol and stained with a crystal violet. Chemotaxis was evaluated by counting the cells migrated to the lower surface of the polycarbonate filters. For each filter the number of cells in six randomly chosen fields was determined, and the counts were averaged (mean ± S.D.). Wound Healing Migration Assay—Confluent PC3 cells were serum starved for 24 h, and the dishes were scored with a sterile 200-μl micropipette tip and photographed. Thereafter cells were treated with 50 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) and 1 μg/ml of either Fc or ephrin-Fc After 24 h the wounds were photographed again to visualize incoming cells. Immunocytochemistry—After washing with PBS, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde solution in PBS for 20 min at 4 °C. Then, after extensive washes in PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and then stained with a 50 μg/ml fluorescent phalloidin conjugate solution in PBS, phalloidin-TRITC, for 1 h at room temperature. After several washes with PBS to remove unbound phalloidin conjugate, the coverslides were mounted with glycerol plasticine and then observed under a confocal fluorescence microscope. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—1 × 106 cells were lysed for 20 min. on ice in 500 μl of complete RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and immunoprecipitated for 4 h at 4°C with 1–2 μg of the specific antibodies. For anti-EphA2 immunoprecipitation we used either anti-EphA2 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnologies) or 1 μg ml-1 ephrinA1-Fc fusion protein, which precipitates all EphA kinases with similar results. Immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Immunoblots were incubated in 3% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, probed first with specific antibodies and then with secondary antibodies. Quantity-One software (Bio-Rad) was used to perform quantitative analyses. EphA2 Inhibits Cell Proliferation and Cell Migration and Induces Cell Rounding and Retraction Fiber Formation—To study the role and regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of EphA2 receptor we chose PC3 carcinoma cells, which have been reported to express mainly EphA2 kinase (24Miao H. Wei B.R. Peehl D.M. Li Q. Alexandrou T. Schelling J.R. Rhim J.S. Sedor J.R. Burnett E. Wang B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Herein we report that the stimulation of this receptor by its cognate ligand ephrinA1 elicits a growth arrest response together with inhibition of cell migration. PC3 cells were seeded onto collagen-coated dishes, and a clonal growth assay was carried out (Fig. 1A). Moreover, ephrinA1 treatment of PC3 cells inhibits their EGF-induced migration in a three-dimensional motility assay (Fig. 1B). The inhibition of ephrinA1 on cell motility was assessed further by a wound healing migration assay. Confluent PC3 cells were wounded, and their EGF-induced motility was measured in the presence of ephrinA1 (Fig. 1C). Again, ephrinA1 is able to inhibit the cell motility strongly in response to EGF as a chemoattractant. Many findings have reported that EphA2 activation leads to dramatic changes in cell morphology (3Wilkinson D.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 19Miao H. Burnett E. Kinch M. Simon E. Wang B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 25Baker R.K. Antin P.B. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 228: 128-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 26Miao H. Nickel C.H. Cantley L.G. Bruggeman L.A. Bennardo L.N. Wang B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We observed that in PC3 cells EphA2 activation inhibits the spreading and adhesion of cells onto collagen-treated dishes (Fig. 1D), suggesting a dramatic delay, after contact with the extracellular matrix, in the construction of cytoskeleton architecture, because of ephrinA1 stimulation. In addition, ephrinA1 stimulation, while inducing cell retraction from the original spread morphology, provokes the formation of actin retraction fibers (Fig. 1E), resulting from retraction of extending membranes of rounding cells. Retraction fibers have been reported to form in several circumstances in which cells need to round up, as in preparation for cell division (27Mitchison T.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1992; 22: 135-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and during neurite retraction (28Fukushima N. Weiner J.A. Kaushal D. Contos J.J. Rehen S.K. Kingsbury M.A. Kim K.Y. Chun J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2002; 20: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These fibers are not microspikes/filopodial-like projections but simple residual contact sites that have not yet been released from the substrate. As far as we know this is the first evidence that during the retraction of the cell body, EphA2 receptor activation elicits the formation of branching actin structures, similar to retraction fibers. EphA2 Receptor Is Regulated by LMW-PTP—A role of LMW-PTP in the dephosphorylation of EphA2 has already been postulated, first in vitro (22Kikawa K.D. Vidale D.R. Van Etten R.L. Kinch M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39274-39279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and in vivo (17Chiarugi P. Taddei M.L. Schiavone N. Papucci L. Giannoni E. Fiaschi T. Capaccioli S. Raugei G. Ramponi G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3905-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Our current interest was in investigating the role of LMW-PTP in ephrinA1 signaling. Immunoprecipitation analysis in PC3 cells reveals that EphA2 receptor associates with LMW-PTP and that this association is strictly ligand-dependent (Fig. 2A). To verify that LMW-PTP is able to dephosphorylate EphA2 in PC3 cells, we first used the siRNA-based silencing approach. We initially verified that 48 and 72 h after siRNA transfection the expression of LMW-PTP was almost undetectable and that the effect of siRNA-mediated LMW-PTP silencing was not affected by ephrinA1 stimulation (Fig. 2B). LMW-PTP silencing did not affect either the EphA2 expression or the overall cell morphology (data not shown). Further analysis with LMW-PTP-silenced PC3 cells revealed that the tyrosine phosphorylation level of EphA2 kinase upon ligand binding was greatly affected by LMW-PTP silencing (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that LMW-PTP retains a key role in the dephosphorylation of the receptor kinase, although other phosphatases may be involved in EphA2 signaling termination. Overexpression of wtLMW-PTP in PC3 cells confirms that LMW-PTP is able to dephosphorylate the EphA2 kinase, leading to a significant decrease in EphA2 kinase phosphorylation level (Fig. 2D). EphA2 Function Is Regulated by LMW-PTP—Recent data indicate that the presence of kinase-inactive, together with active Eph receptors within the same cell, changes its response to ligands from repulsion to adhesion (16Holmberg J. Clarke D.L. Frisen J. Nature. 2000; 408: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 29Holmberg J. Frisen J. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 239-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), indicating a key role for Eph kinase phosphorylation levels. Consequently, we hypothesize that ephrinA1 cellular responses are controlled by the activity of the associated LMW-PTP. To verify that LMW-PTP is able to contrast ephrinA1 effects in PC3 cells, we first analyzed the effect of modulation of LMW-PTP expression on ephrin-mediated migration responses. Our results showed that LMW-PTP silencing causes a dramatic increase in the effect elicited by ephrinA1 in the three-dimensional motility assay, leading to a greater inhibition of serum-induced cell migration (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, we analyzed the effect of LMW-PTP silencing on the ephrin-mediated formation of retraction fibers, observed during cell repulsion. Remarkably, both the repulsion between ephrinA1 cells and the formation of retraction fibers appear to be enhanced (at least 65%) in LMW-PTP-silenced cells (Fig. 3, B and C). In addition, to confirm the causal role of LMW-PTP in cell rounding and retraction fiber formation, we overexpressed the EGFP-fused wtLMW-PTP in PC3 cells during ephrinA1 stimulation. We checked that the overexpression of LMW-PTP had not influenced the overall cell rounding and retraction fiber formation in PC3 cells and that the fusion of LMW-PTP with EGFP had not interfered with its enzymatic activity (data not shown). Fig. 3D shows the superimposing of green fluorescence of EGFP (cells that express EGFP-wtLMW-PTP) and of red fluorescence from actin labeling. Upon stimulation with EphA1 all of the cells started to retract the cell body at 5 min. By 15 min, nearly all of the cells retracted the membrane protrusions, and the actin retraction fibers were evident. In EGFP-wtLMW-PTP-expressing cells the formation of retraction fibers was strongly inhibited, whereas in adjacent nonexpressing cells the formation of retraction filaments was normal (Fig. 3D). Fig. 3E shows a quantitative analysis of the morphological changes, namely, loss of membrane extensions and formation of retraction fibers in both wtLMW-PTP and control cells. Finally, the effect of LMW-PTP silencing was assessed in a wound-healing EGF-induced motility assay (Fig. 3F), confirming again that the inhibition of expression of LMW-PTP considerably increases the decline in cell motility induced by ephrinA1. Thus, taken together our data indicate that LMW-PTP has a dramatic effect on the overall repulsive outcome induced by ephrinA1 ligation. LMW-PTP Interferes with Ephrin-mediated MAPK Regulation—MAPKs play an essential role in a variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and development and were recently found to be linked to ephrin signaling (24Miao H. Wei B.R. Peehl D.M. Li Q. Alexandrou T. Schelling J.R. Rhim J.S. Sedor J.R. Burnett E. Wang B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 26Miao H. Nickel C.H.

Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6111-6119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although the effect of ephrins on MAPKs is still debated, in ephrinA1-stimulated PC3 cells we detected a strong and clear inhibition of this signaling pathway. The effect of ephrinA1 on the basal MAPK activation level was first analyzed and found to be mainly integrin- and cell adhesion-dependent. The results are consistent with previously reported data (24Miao H. Wei B.R. Peehl D.M. Li Q. Alexandrou T. Schelling J.R. Rhim J.S. Sedor J.R. Burnett E. Wang B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and show that ephrinA1 strongly inhibits basal MAPK activity (Fig. 4A). Next, to elicit a strong MAPK activation, we stimulated PC3 cells with EGF. Again, ephrinA1 was able to inhibit strongly the EGF-induced MAPK activation (Fig. 4B), confirming that cell repulsion is associated with the repression of MAPKs elicited by both adhesive molecules and by soluble mitogens. To investigate the role of LMW-PTP in EphA2-mediated inhibition of MAPK signaling, we either silenced LMW-PTP expression or overexpressed wtLMW-PTP, before MAPK assaying. We show that the inhibition of LMW-PTP expression induces a stronger inhibition of MAPK after ephrinA1 stimulation, likely because of EphA2 receptor hyperphosphorylation (Fig. 4C). Likewise, the overexpression of active LMW-PTP leads to the abolishment of the inhibitory effect of ephrinA1 on MAPK activation, likely because of receptor dephosphorylation (Fig. 2D). Taken together, our results validate that LMW-PTP greatly affects EphA2-dependent signaling, contrasting ephrin-dependent MAPK inhibition. LMW-PTP Inhibits p120RasGAP Binding to EphA2 Kinase—p120Ras-GAP has been indicated among SH2 domain-containing proteins that, upon ligand binding, bind to Eph kinases (33Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Gish G.D. Roth R.A. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Henkemeyer M. Yancopoulos G.D. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3877-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The recruitment to cell membrane of the Ras small GTPase GAP leads to activation of its GTPase activity and to a final down-regulation of MAPK signaling (34Bernards A. Settleman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the LMW-PTP effect on ephrinA1-mediated MAPK signaling may be caused by the elimination of a docking site (either single or multiple) for a MAPK regulator containing an SH2 domain as p120RasGAP. To verify our hypothesis we analyzed the binding of p120RasGAP to EphA2 kinase in LMW-PTP silenced cells. Our results indicate that killing of LMW-PTP enhances p120RasGAP binding to EphA2 receptor (Fig. 5A), suggesting a role for this phosphatase in the dephosphorylation of p120 binding site(s) on the activated receptor. Accordingly, in PC3 cells overexpressing wtLMW-PTP we reported a decrease in the amount of p120RasGAP bound to EphA2 kinase upon ligand stimulation (Fig. 5B). The involvement of p120RasGAP in the down-regulation of MAPK in response to Eph receptors has already been proposed (32Tong J. Elowe S. Nash P. Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6111-6119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To confirm the key role of p120RasGAP in ephrinA1 signaling, we investigated the activation level of MAPK in wild-type cells and in cells in which p120RasGAP has been silenced by RNA interfering. Stimulation of cells with ephrinA1 leads to a dramatic down-regulation of EGF-activated MAPK, whereas no change in MAPK activation was detected in p120RasGAP-silenced cells (Fig. 6A). In addition we analyzed the inhibition of MAPK by ephrinA1 in p120RasGAP-nu"

In our efforts to define the molecular basis of digitalis glycosides binding we started from the fact that a closely related enzyme, the gastric H,K-ATPase, does not bind glycosides like ouabain. Previously, we showed that a chimera of these two enzymes, in which only the M3-M4 and M5-M6 hairpins were of Na,K-ATPase, bound ouabain with high affinity (Koenderink, J. B., Hermsen, H. P. H., Swarts, H. G. P., Willems, P. H. G. M., and De Pont, J. J. H. H. M. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 97, 11209–11214). We also demonstrated that only three amino acids (Phe783, Thr797, and Asp804) present in the M5-M6 hairpin of Na,K-ATPase were sufficient to confer high affinity ouabain binding to a chimera which contained in addition the M3-M4 hairpin of Na,K-ATPase (Qiu, L. Y., Koenderink, J. B., Swarts, H. G., Willems, P. H., and De Pont, J. J. H. H. M. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 47240–47244). To further pinpoint the ouabain-binding site here we used a chimera-based loss-of-function strategy and identified four amino acids (Glu312, Val314, Ile315, Gly319), all present in M4, as being important for ouabain binding. In a final gain-of-function study we showed that a gastric H,K-ATPase that contained Glu312, Val314, Ile315, Gly319, Phe783, Thr797, and Asp804 of Na,K-ATPase bound ouabain with the same affinity as the native enzyme. Based on the E2P crystal structure of Ca2+-ATPase we constructed a homology model for the ouabain-binding site of Na,K-ATPase involving all seven amino acids as well as several earlier postulated amino acids.

Based on the E2P crystal structure of Ca2+-ATPase we constructed a homology model for the ouabain-binding site of Na,K-ATPase involving all seven amino acids as well as several earlier postulated amino acids. Cardiac glycosides, like ouabain, were already used in medicine in the 18th century. Nowadays, these drugs are mainly used in the treatment of congestive heart failure and arrhythmias. In 1953 Schatzmann (1Schatzmann H.J. Helv. Physiol. Pharmacol. Acta. 1953; 11: 346-354PubMed Google Scholar) found that these cardiac glycosides inhibit the active transport of Na+ and K+. A few years later Skou (2Skou J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 23: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar) found that this cation transport was caused by the Na,K-ATPase. This enzyme (also called the sodium pump) is an integral membrane protein found in the cells of all higher eukaryotes and is responsible for translocating sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane utilizing ATP as the energy source (3Lingrel J.B. Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19659-19662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since 1960 a large number of studies have established that ouabain inhibits Na,K-ATPase by binding to a hitherto undefined binding pocket that is accessed from the extracellular side. The sodium pump alternates between two conformational states (E1 and E2) during the catalytic cycle. Ouabain binds to the phosphorylated E2 form (E2P) of the enzyme with high affinity (4Jorgensen P.L. Andersen J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 103: 95-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Identifying the amino acid residues involved in ouabain binding is important for understanding the molecular mechanism by which this drug interacts with and inhibits the activity of Na,K-ATPase. The localization of the ouabain-binding site on Na,K-ATPase has been studied for many years, but the amino acids involved in direct binding are still unknown. Since ouabain binds to Na,K-ATPase from the extracellular side, most previous studies focused on substituting amino acids in the extracellular loops of the enzyme. Price and Lingrel (5Price E.M. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8400-8408Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 6Price E.M. Rice D.A. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6638-6641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that residues Arg111 and Asp122, which lie on the border of the first extracellular loop of the rat α-subunit, were responsible for the ouabain-resistant nature of mouse and rat enzymes. Other studies demonstrated that mutation of Cys104, Tyr108, Pro118, Asp121, Tyr124, Tyr308, Leu330, Ala331, Thr338, Cys367, Cys656, Phe786, Leu793, Thr797, Phe863, Arg880, and Phe982 had negative effects on the binding of ouabain to Na,K-ATPase (7Croyle M.L. Woo A.L. Lingrel J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 8Sweadner K.J. Donnet C. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 685-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The difficulty with most of these studies is that the observed loss of ouabain binding can equally well be the result of indirect effects. To address this problem, one can perform a gain-of-ouabain binding experiment by introducing the identified amino acids in a closely related enzyme that lacks the capacity to bind ouabain. The gastric H,K-ATPase is unable to bind ouabain but shows a high degree of homology to Na,K-ATPase. The catalytic α-subunits of these two P-type ATPase are 63% identical in amino acid composition (9Shull G.E. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16788-16791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have made chimeric enzymes between the Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase in an attempt to identify the residues that are crucial for ouabain binding. In a previous study, we demonstrated that replacement of the transmembrane hairpins M3-M4 and M5-M6 in H,K-ATPase by those of Na,K-ATPase results in the formation of a high affinity ouabain-binding site (10Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In a follow-up study we showed that a chimera, in which only the M3-M4 hairpin and three amino acids of M5-M6 (Phe783, Thr797, and Asp804) originate from Na,K-ATPase, binds ouabain with high affinity (11Qiu L.Y.

However, the M3-M4 hairpin in the latter chimera still contains 27 amino acids that are unique for Na,K-ATPase. Here we report a gastric H,K-ATPase that gained a high affinity ouabain-binding site after replacing only seven amino acids by their Na,K-ATPase counterparts. By homology modeling starting from the E2P crystal structure of Ca2+-ATPase (12Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) we constructed a model for the ouabain-binding pocket in Na,K-ATPase in which several of the amino acids, of which a role in ouabain binding has been postulated, are shown to play a crucial role in the binding of ouabain. Construction of Chimeras and Mutants—The chimeras and mutants presented in this paper were constructed from the rat Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit containing the R111Q and D122N mutations (5Price E.M.

S. A. 2000; 97: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and the rat gastric H,K-ATPase α-subunit (9Shull G.E. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16788-16791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rat Na,K-ATPase α1- and β1-subunits, the rat gastric H,K-ATPase α- and β-subunits, and the chimeras were subcloned into the pTLN vector, which is suitable for the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system (14Lorenz C. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13362-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate the mutants described in this paper. All introduced mutations were verified by sequencing. For clarity reasons we used the numbering of the pig Na,K-ATPase, also for residues in parts originating from H,K-ATPase. Expression, [3H]Ouabain Binding, and ATP Phosphorylation—Oocytes were injected with cRNAs, and after 3 days the membranes were isolated as described previously (11Qiu L.Y. Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G. Willems P.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47240-47244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, the α-subunits of H,K-ATPase and the chimeras were detected with the polyclonal antibody HKB (15Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14342-14347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]Ouabain binding and ATP phosphorylation were carried out as described previously (11Qiu L.Y. Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G. Willems P.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47240-47244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In previous studies using the baculovirus expression system we determined that the maximal ATPase activity at infinite ATP concentrations of Na,K-ATPase was 1.8 ± 0.6 μmol/mg/h and that of H,K-ATPase was 1.4 ± 0.1 μmol/mg/h (16Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11604-11610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of chimera HN34/56 was 49% of that of the wild type H,K-ATPase at 10 μm ATP, 3 mm KCl, and pH 6.0 (10Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The ouabain binding level of Na,K-ATPase (QN) was 0.40 ± 0.04 pmol/mg when 1 mm Pi was present, whereas that of HN34/56 was 0.20 ± 0.01 pmol/mg when 1 mm ATP was present (10Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The ouabain binding level of H,K-ATPase was only 0.04 ± 0.01 pmol/mg in the presence of 1 mm Pi or ATP. Molecular Modeling of Ouabain-binding ATPases—Sequence alignment of Na,K-ATPase (Swiss-Prot accession number P05023) to the newly released crystal structure of Ca2+-ATPase in the E2P state (12Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank ID code 1WPG) was obtained as described previously and shown in Fig. 7 (17Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G. Willems P.H. Krieger E. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16417-16424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The E2P state was chosen because of its higher affinity to ouabain. The homology model was built with SCWRL (18Canutescu A.A. Shelenkov A.A. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2001-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), while structurally divergent loop regions were copied from other Protein Data Bank structures with similar local sequence and geometry. Then, molecular dynamics simulations were run in explicit solvent with the Yamber2 force field and the associated protocol (19Krieger E. Darden T. Nabuurs S.B. Finkelstein A. Vriend G. Proteins. 2004; 57: 678-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar) until the WHAT IF (20Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8 (52-56): 29Google Scholar) quality indicators, Ramachandran plot, backbone conformation, and three-dimensional packing quality (21Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar), converged. During these simulations, the backbone atoms of aligned residues were kept fixed. Docking of Ouabain—The homology model of Na,K-ATPase was used for in silico docking with the FlexX program (22Kramer B. Rarey M. Lengauer T. Proteins. 1999; 37: 228-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar), Version 1.13.5 L. FlexX predicts the conformations of a set of energetically favorable molecular complexes consisting of the ligand bound to the active site of the protein. The complexes are labeled with a score that approximates binding energy. Because of the huge size of the ATPase model, placement of the ligand was restricted to the previously postulated binding pocket on the extracellular side of the membrane (11Qiu L.Y. Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G. Willems P.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47240-47244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Besides an overall pocket, a subpocket was defined to include residues known from mutation experiments to be important for ligand binding. The use of a subpocket lets FlexX place the base fragment (the first placed fragment of the ligand) near one of the residues in the subpocket. The rest of the ligand still has the freedom to completely move away from these residues as long as the ligand remains within the overall pocket. The starting structure for ouabain was obtained from the Cambridge Structural Data Base (23Allen F.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 2002; 58: 380-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (12531) Google Scholar). Hydrogens were added interactively with the Molden package (24Schaftenaar G. Noordik J.H. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2000; 14: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar). Molden was also used to assign the atom types of the Sybyl force field. This assignment was checked by visual inspection. Bond lengths and bond angles were optimized with the Sybyl force field. FlexX produced a number of protein-ligand complexes, of which the 10 best scoring ones were inspected visually. These so-called poses showed little variation in geometries. The best scoring pose was used for this work. As FlexX keeps the protein completely fixed, the amino acid side chain rotamers could not be expected to be optimal, as the homology model was built in absence of ouabain. Consequently, the best scoring pose was subjected to an additional energy minimization with the NOVA force field (25Krieger E. Koraimann G. Vriend G. Proteins. 2002; 47: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar), which resulted in improved hydrogen bonding patterns shown in Fig. 8. Calculations—Data are presented as mean values with standard error of the mean. Differences were tested for significance by means of Student's t test. Identification of Amino Acids in M3-M4 That Are Involved in Ouabain Binding—To identify the amino acids that are essential for ouabain binding in the M3-M4 region, the 27 unique amino acids were replaced with those of H,K-ATPase after which ouabain binding was measured. In first instance eight mutants (see Fig. 1) of chimera HN34/56 were generated and co-expressed with the β-subunit of H,K-ATPase in X. laevis oocytes. Western blot analysis of total membrane protein using the polyclonal antibody HKB that recognizes the loop between M4 and M5 of the gastric H,K-ATPase α-subunit (15Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14342-14347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the expression levels of the mutants and chimera HN34/56 were virtually the same (Fig. 2A). Ouabain binding experiments were carried out in the presence of 1 mm ATP and 250 nm ouabain (Fig. 2B). The [3H]ouabain binding levels of the mutants WEVI, LIG, and IN were significantly lower than that of chimera HN34/56 (p < 0.05), and not significantly different from that of non-injected oocytes (p > 0.05), indicating that these mutants had lost their ability to bind [3H]ouabain. However, the [3H]ouabain-binding capacity of the mutants EIH, LTV, VFLVS, ILSL, and ILE was rather similar to that of chimera HN34/56 (p > 0.05). From these findings it can be concluded that three to nine amino acids present in transmembrane segment M4 of Na,K-ATPase are important for ouabain binding and that residues in the M3 segment do not play a crucial role.FIGURE 2[3H]Ouabain binding of HN34/56 mutants. A, total membrane proteins from oocytes were probed with the antibody, HKB, which specifically reacts with the large intracellular loop of the H,K-ATPase α-subunit. B, [3H]ouabain binding was determined by incubating the membranes at room temperature in 5.0 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-acetic acid (pH 7.0), 1.0 mm ATP, and 250 nm [3H]ouabain. Mean values ± S.E. of three enzyme preparations are shown. *, significantly different from HN34/56 (p < 0.05). The eight mutants (EIH, LTV, VFLVS, ILSL, ILE, WEVI, LIG, and IN) are described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess which of these nine amino acids are required for high affinity ouabain binding, we generated individual mutants of chimera HN34/56, in which each of the nine amino acids was replaced by the corresponding residue from gastric H,K-ATPase. No major differences in expression levels between the mutants and chimera HN34/56 were observed (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3B shows that the [3H]ouabain binding levels of mutants G319A and N324Y were significantly lower than that of chimera HN34/56 (p < 0.05) and not different from that of non-injected oocytes (p > 0.05), indicating that these two mutants had lost their ability to bind ouabain. All mutants could be phosphorylated by ATP, except mutant N324Y (data not shown). This lack of phosphorylation is in agreement with previous reports showing the importance of this residue in determining the cation selectivity and E1/E2 conformational equilibrium (26Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 27Mense M. Dunbar L.A. Blostein R. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1749-1756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because formation of the phosphorylated intermediate is required for high affinity ouabain binding, we conclude that loss of ouabain binding by N324Y is most likely caused by its inability to become phosphorylated. The [3H]ouabain binding levels of mutants E312R, V314M, and I315V were higher than that of non-injected oocytes (p < 0.05), whereas they were lower (E312R and V314M; p < 0.05) or tended to be lower (I315V; p < 0.08) than that of chimera HN34/56. This indicates that these three mutants probably have a reduced ouabain affinity. Altogether, these findings suggest that four amino acids Glu312, Val314, Ile315, and Gly319, all present in M4 of Na,K-ATPase, are essential for ouabain binding. Ouabain Binding by a Mutated Gastric H,K-ATPase—The disadvantage of “loss-of-function” experiments is that mutation of a certain amino acid can lead to a loss of ouabain binding, by an indirect mechanism. In “gain-of-function” experiments these faulty identified amino acids will not be essential for ouabain binding and will be deleted from the amino acids identified as essential for ouabain binding. In addition, the affinity of the constructs that gained ouabain binding indicates whether the complete binding site is present. Therefore, we used a gain-of-function experiment in which we introduced the above four amino acids together with Asn324 into HN-FTD (HN-EVIGN-FTD, see TABLE ONE). The importance of Asn324 was tested by including HN-EVIG-FTD in the same experiment. HN-FTD itself contains only three amino acids (Phe783, Thr797, and Asp804) from Na,K-ATPase, of which we previously demonstrated that they were sufficient to confer high affinity ouabain binding to HN34 (11Qiu L.Y. Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G. Willems P.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47240-47244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The Western blot presented in Fig. 4A shows equal expression of HN34/56, HN-FTD, HN-EVIGN-FTD, and HN-EVIG-FTD. Ouabain bound similarly to both HN-EVIGN-FTD and HN-EVIG-FTD, indicating that Asn324 is not required for ouabain binding and confirming the importance of the other four amino acids identified in the loss-of-function analysis. Although replacement of Gly319 in HN34/56 (G319A) caused complete loss of ouabain binding (Fig. 3B), its introduction in HN-FTD (HN-G-FTD) did not result in any increase in ouabain binding (Fig. 4B). Similarly, introduction in HN-FTD of the three amino acids, which upon individual replacement in HN34/56 caused only partial reduction in ouabain binding (Fig. 3B; HN-EVI-FTD) did not confer ouabain-binding capacity to this chimera. Based on these findings it can be concluded that a combination of Gly319 and one or more of the three other amino acids (Glu312, Val314, Ile315) is required for ouabain binding. To test this idea we generated HN-VIG-FTD, HN-EIG-FTD, and HN-EVG-FTD and determined their ouabain-binding capacity (Fig. 5). All three mutants were readily expressed (Fig. 5A), but none of them showed significant ouabain binding (Fig. 5B). This result clearly demonstrates that Glu312, Val314, Ile315, and Gly319 are all four required to confer ouabain-binding capacity to HN-FTD. Taken together our work shows that replacement of only seven amino acids in gastric H,K-ATPase by their Na,K-ATPase counterparts lends ouabain sensitivity to the enzyme.TABLE ONEDescription of the used mutants All mutants used in this study have the rat gastric H,K-ATPase α-subunit as a backbone and contain the β-subunit of this enzyme.

In this assay, which was performed in the presence of 1 mm ATP and 100 mm NaCl, the apparent ouabain affinities for Na,K-ATPase (0.2 ± 0.1 μm), HN34/56 (0.5 ± 0.1 μm), and HN-EVIG-FTD (0.5 ± 0.1 μm) were not significantly different (p > 0.05), confirming that only seven amino acids of Na,K-ATPase can confer high affinity ouabain binding to gastric H,K-ATPase. Homology Model of the Ouabain-binding Site—We used two homology models of the α1-subunit of Na,K-ATPase to dock ouabain into its putative binding site using FlexX (22Kramer B. Rarey M. Lengauer T. Proteins. 1999; 37: 228-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). The first model, built from Ca2+-ATPase in the E2 conformation (Protein Data Bank ID code 1IWO), did not yield a high scoring solution, most likely because the binding cleft was too narrow. The 1IWO structure is a Ca2+-unbound form that is stabilized by the inhibitor thapsigargin (E2). The 1WPG structure is also a Ca2+-unbound form but contains Mg2+ next to a bound phosphate analogue, MgF42-, and is stabilized with thapsigargin). The structure represents the E2Pi state, just after the hydrolysis of the aspartyl phosphate but before the release of phosphate from the ATPase. The second model was based on this newly released structure of Ca2+-ATPase (Protein Data Bank ID code 1WPG) (12Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In this model, helix M4 was tilted outward leading to a widening of the binding cleft and resulting in a docked complex with a significant FlexX score of 4.053. While docking to homology models is a difficult task, the docked complex fitted well to the experimental data (Figs. 7 and 8). Five of the seven essential residues (Glu312, Val314, Ile315, Gly319, and Thr797) were in direct proximity of ouabain (closer than 5 Å) forming for example hydrogen bonds (Glu312 and Thr797) or hydrophobic contacts (Ile315). The remaining two amino acids (Phe783 and Asp804) were providing structural support. The docked complex identified a number of additional residues involved in ouabain binding: Gln111 and Asn122 between helices M1 and M2 (5Price E.M. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8400-8408Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), Thr309 at the border of M4, and Thr799 in M6. Because these amino acids are conserved between Na,K-ATPase (of ouabain-sensitive species) and gastric H,K-ATPase they did not show up in our experiments. Na,K-ATPase and gastric H,K-ATPase belong to the IIC subfamily of the cation transport (P-type) ATPases. Although their α-subunits share 63% homology in amino acid sequence both enzymes differ in ion selectivity, subcellular localization and pharmacological profile. As far as the sensitivity to drugs is concerned, Na,K-ATPase is specifically inhibited by ouabain and related cardiac glycosides. Ouabain binds from the extracellular side but the exact location of the binding site is still unknown. In previous studies, we first narrowed down this site to transmembrane hairpins M3-M4 and M5-M6 (10Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), after which we identified three residues (Phe783, Thr797, and Asp804) in M5-M6 that play a key role in ouabain binding (11Qiu L.Y. Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G. Willems P.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47240-47244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used our chimera-based loss-of-function approach to identify another four residues (Glu312, Val314, Ile315, Gly319) in the M3-M4 hairpin of Na,K-ATPase. To confirm the importance of the identified amino acids for ouabain binding, we performed a gain-of-function experiment showing that a H,K-ATPase mutant with seven residues from Na,K-ATPase binds ouabain with the same affinity as the native enzyme. Because ouabain is a highly specific inhibitor of Na,K-ATPase that binds preferentially to the phosphorylated intermediate, in our opinion it is very unlikely that a newly constructed ouabain binding site has been generated that binds ouabain with the same affinity as the parent Na,K-ATPase. Interactions between M3-M4 and the Sugar Moiety of Ouabain—In our docking model, Thr309 and Glu312, which are present in M4, form hydrogen bridges with hydroxyl groups of the sugar moiety of ouabain. Thr309 was not identified with our loss-of-function strategy because it is also present in gastric H,K-ATPase. Canessa et al. (28Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17722-17726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that Tyr308 played a critical role in ouabain binding. In our model this residue is close to, but not in direct contact with, ouabain. Our docking model is in agreement with previous work pointing to an important role for the second extracellular loop in ouabain binding. Already in 1985 Shull et al. (29Shull G.E. Schwartz A. Lingrel J.B. Nature. 1985; 316: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) reported that only this loop displayed all the requirements for ouabain binding: relatively hydrophobic, shielded from water, and close to a Trp residue (30Fortes P.A. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A few years later it was shown that the p-aminobenzyldiazonio derivative of ouabain, in which the reactive substituent was bound to the rhamnosyl residue of ouabain, labeled Trp310 (31Rossi B. Lazdunski M. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Similarly, it was shown that photosensitive 12-azido-3β-digitoxoside complexed with Trp310–Ala313 (32McParland R.A. Fullerton D.S. Becker R.R. From A.H.L. Ahmed K. Kaplan J.H. De Weer P. The Sodium Pump: Recent Developments. Rockefeller University Press, New York1991: 297-302Google Scholar), whereas antibody M45-80, which recognizes the E307YTWLE sequence, was found to enhance the rate of ouabain binding (33Satoh K. Nakao T. Nagai F. Kano I. Nakagawa A. Ushiyama K. Urayama O. Hara Y. Nakao M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 994: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 34Kano I. Satoh K. Nagai F. Ushiyama K. Nakao T. Hara Y. Kano K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 1262-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Interactions between M4 and M1-M2 and the Steroid Body of Ouabain— In our docking model, Ile315, which is present in M4, is in close proximity to the steroid body of ouabain and has a hydrophobic interaction. In contrast, Val314 is located on the wrong site of the helical wheel and can therefore not have a direct interaction with ouabain. Most probably, replacement of Val314 with its H,K-ATPase counterpart Met has a negative structural effect on the ouabain-binding pocket. The same holds true for Gly319, which also has no direct interaction with ouabain in our model. The importance of this residue is also shown by the work of Horisberger et al. (35Horisberger J.D. Kharoubi-Hess S. Guennoun S. Michielin O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29542-29550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) who found that replacement of this residue with a Cys resulted in a marked decrease in transport activity. Other amino acids present in M4 that have been implicated in ouabain binding are Leu330, Ala331, and Thr338 (7Croyle M.L. Woo A.L. Lingrel J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, these amino acids are located at the inner interface between membrane and cytosol and are therefore not in direct contact with the ouabain molecule. This part of M4 is completely conserved between Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase suggesting an important role in enzyme functioning. Thus, mutations in this part of M4 may affect ouabain binding indirectly through alterations in enzyme activity or conformational equilibrium. Numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of Gln111 and Asn122 (first extracellular loop between M1 and M2) for high affinity ouabain binding (5Price E.M. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8400-8408Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 6Price E.M. Rice D.A. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6638-6641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These residues are also present in rat gastric H,K-ATPase. In our docking complex these residues form hydrogen bridges with the hydroxyl groups on the positions 1 and 11 of the steroid body of ouabain. Our docking model is supported by previous work showing that these two residues do not bind the sugar moiety (36O'Brien W.J. Wallick E.T. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7707-7712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In helveticoside the hydroxyl groups at positions 1 and 11 are deleted. In addition the hydroxyl group at position 19 is replaced by a keto group, and the rhamnose group is replaced by a single digitoxose group. The binding affinity of this drug is ∼40 times lower than that of ouabain (37Paula S. Tabet M.R. Ball Jr., W.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 498-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), which fits with our model. In addition to Gln111 and Asn122, mutagenesis studies have implicated Cys104 (M1), which is also present in gastric H,K-ATPase, in ouabain binding (38Schultheis P.J. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 39Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Louvard D. Rossier B.C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1681-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 40Schultheis P.J. Wallick E.T. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22686-22694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with these mutagenesis studies, the digoxigenin derivative N-hydroxysuccimidyl digoxigenin-3-O-methylcarbonyl-ϵ-aminocaproate was found to form a thioester bond with this residue (41Antolovic R. Schoner W. Geering K. Canessa C. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), whereas its replacement had differential effects on the sensitivity of the enzyme to digoxin and digitoxin (42Askew G.R. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24120-24126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our docking model, however, Cys104 does not interact directly with ouabain. The same holds true for Tyr108, which is in close proximity to the steroid body of ouabain and has been shown to contribute to the ouabain affinity of the enzyme (38Schultheis P.J. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 40Schultheis P.J. Wallick E.T. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22686-22694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other amino acids in the first extracellular loop have also been implicated in ouabain binding. Glu116, Pro118, and Asp121 are located between key residues Gln111 and Asn122, and it is therefore not surprising that they were shown to influence ouabain binding (7Croyle M.L. Woo A.L. Lingrel J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 8Sweadner K.J. Donnet C. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 685-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In the ouabain-binding chimera HN-EVIG-FTD, however, Glu116 and Pro118 are not present. Recently, Crambert et al. (43Crambert G. Schaer D. Roy S. Geering K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) found that Thr114, Gln119, Ile874, and Gln898 were involved in the access and release of ouabain to and from its binding site. Our docking model is compatible with this putative role of Thr114 and Gln119 in the process of ouabain binding. Ile874 and Gln898 are located in the fourth extracellular loop between M7 and M8 that interacts with the β-subunit. Our homology model does not include a β-subunit and is therefore not suitable to predict the location of these two amino acids. Interactions between M5-M6 and the Lactone Ring of Ouabain—The carbonyl oxygen of the lactone ring forms a hydrogen bridge with the hydroxyl group of Thr799, which is present in the third extracellular loop between M5 and M6. Such a bridge is also formed between the oxygen of the lactone ring and the backbone nitrogens of residues Thr797 and Val798. In agreement with the present study, previous work demonstrated the importance of Thr797 for ouabain binding (44Burns E.L. Price E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25632-25635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Feng J. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4218-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Similarly, Leu793, which in our model is very close to ouabain, has been found to influence ouabain binding (13Burns E.L. Nicholas R.A. Price E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15879-15883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 46Palasis M. Kuntzweiler T.A. Arguello J.M. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14176-14182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Phe783 points toward ouabain but is too far away to interact directly with this molecule. Most probably its replacement with a Tyr indirectly disturbs the ouabain-binding site. As discussed in our previous paper (11Qiu L.Y. Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G. Willems P.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47240-47244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) Asp804 (M6) affects ouabain binding indirectly through its effects on cation binding. Phe786, whose replacement with an Asn or an Ile was also found to result in a decrease in ouabain affinity (46Palasis M. Kuntzweiler T.A. Arguello J.M. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14176-14182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), is located in the third extracellular loop just outside M5. However, in our docking model this residue does not interact with ouabain. Role of C-terminal Amino Acids in Ouabain Binding—Several amino acids at the C-terminal end of the α-subunit have been implicated in ouabain binding. Replacement of Phe863 with a Leu (46Palasis M. Kuntzweiler T.A. Arguello J.M. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14176-14182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), Arg880 with a Pro or Leu (38Schultheis P.J. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 40Schultheis P.J. Wallick E.T. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22686-22694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Phe982 with a Ser (7Croyle M.L. Woo A.L. Lingrel J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) all resulted in a decrease in ouabain affinity. Phe863 and Phe982 are located in M7 and M10, respectively, and according to our docking model these amino acids are far away from the actual ouabain-binding site. Although Arg880 is also not very close to the ouabain-binding site, it may interact with ouabain because the position of the fourth extracellular loop that interacts with the β-subunit is still very uncertain. Mechanism of Ouabain Inhibition—Paula et al. (37Paula S. Tabet M.R. Ball Jr., W.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 498-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) found that substitution of the five-membered lactone by a six-membered lactone caused a decrease in binding affinity and an increase in inhibitory potency, whereas removal of the sugar moiety of ouabain caused a dramatic decrease in binding affinity but had little effect on inhibitory potency (37Paula S. Tabet M.R. Ball Jr., W.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 498-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These findings are in agreement with our docking model, in which the lactone ring is buried deep inside the lipid bilayer, whereas the rhamnose is located more superficially. A plausible mechanism for Na,K-ATPase inhibition is digitalis-mediated paralysis of M5-M6 loop movement (46Palasis M. Kuntzweiler T.A. Arguello J.M. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14176-14182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). After binding of ouabain to the first extracellular loop and M4, it exerts its inhibitory activity by interacting with the M5-M6 loop that is involved in cation binding, thus restricting its flexibility. This mechanism might also be the basis for the K+-ouabain antagonism."
https://openalex.org/W2031062185,"Overexpression of protein kinase C δ (PKCδ) stimulates apoptosis in a wide variety of cell types through a mechanism that is incompletely understood. PKCδ-deficient cells are impaired in their response to DNA damage-induced apoptosis, suggesting that PKCδ is required to mount an appropriate apoptotic response under conditions of stress. The mechanism through which it does so remains elusive. In addition to effects on cell survival, PKCδ elicits pleiotropic effects on cellular proliferation. We now provide the first evidence that the ability of PKCδ to stimulate apoptosis is intimately linked to its ability to stimulate G1 phase cell cycle progression. Using an adenoviral-based expression system to express PKCα,-δ, and -ϵ in epithelial cells, we demonstrate that a modest increase in PKCδ activity selectively stimulates quiescent cells to initiate G1 phase cell cycle progression. Rather than completing the cell cycle, PKCδ-infected cells arrest in S phase, an event that triggers caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death. Apoptosis was preceded by the activation of cell cycle checkpoints, culminating in the phosphorylation of Chk-1 and p53. Strikingly, blockade of S phase entry using the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 prevented checkpoint activation and apoptosis. In contrast, inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades failed to prevent apoptosis. These findings demonstrate that the biological effects of PKCδ can be extended to include positive regulation of G1 phase cell cycle progression. Importantly, they reveal the existence of a novel, cell cycle-dependent mechanism through which PKCδ stimulates cell death.

PKC isoforms differ in their requirement for calcium and their responsiveness to the lipid second messenger diacylglycerol. The classical (calcium-dependent) and novel (calcium-independent) isoforms are responsive to diacylglycerol, whereas the atypical isoforms are diacylglycerol-insensitive (reviewed in Ref. 1Kazanietz M.G.

Most cells express multiple PKC isozymes that require distinct cofactors and exhibit unique intracellular localizations. Pharmacological inhibitors have been used to assess the roles of individual PKC isozymes. Much of what is known regarding the biological roles of PKCδ has been derived from studies using the PKCδ-selective inhibitor rottlerin, the specificity of which is in question. The isolation of cell lines overexpressing or lacking individual isozymes has been used to decipher the physiological roles of select PKC isozymes. A major limitation of this approach is that it does not readily distinguish between the effects of PKC activation versus the subsequent down-regulation of PKC expression. We opted to use adenoviruses to drive selective, modest increases in the activities of PKCα,-δ, and -ϵ, a powerful approach that has provided substantial insight into the regulation of cellular survival by PKC (2Fujii T.

The results of this analysis revealed the existence of a novel mechanism through which PKCδ stimulates apoptosis and demonstrate a tight linkage between the effects of PKCδ on cell proliferation and cell death. Reagents—The following antibodies were used: active caspase-3 (Asp-175), caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), phospho-H2AX (Ser-139) (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA), phospho-p53 (Ser-15) (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), phospho-Chk1 (Ser-345) (Cell Signaling), cyclins A (C-19), and E (M-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), cyclin B1 (Cell Signaling), nPKCδ (C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Cdk-2 (M2) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). LY294002 and SB203580 were purchased from Sigma. Q-VD-OPh (QVD) and GF109203X were from Calbiochem (EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA). SP600125 was from Alexis Biochemicals (Lausen, Switzerland), and UO126 was from Promega (Madison, WI). Cell Culture—Wistar rat thyroid cells were propagated in three hormone-containing growth medium (3H, containing thyroid-stimulating hormone, insulin, and serum) as described previously (10Kupperman E. Wofford D. Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were rendered quiescent by starvation in Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium devoid of thyroid-stimulating hormone and growth factors (basal medium) for 48–72 h.

Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 8547-8558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used. Quiescent cells were infected with adenoviruses for PKCα (2,000 or 10,000 particles (p)/cell), PKCδ (5,000 p/cell), or PKCϵ (7,000 p/cell) in basal medium for 16 h (day 1 post-infection). Virus was removed, and the cells washed twice and incubated in basal medium for the times indicated. In experiments where TPA was used, TPA (25 nm) was added at day 2 post-infection for 60 min, and the cells were washed and then incubated in basal medium for the times indicated. Inhibitors were added at the time of infection and again at day 1 post-infection. Flow Cytometry—Floating and trypsinized cells were collected and pelleted at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were fixed in ice-cold MeOH overnight and resuspended in 250 μl each RNase (200 units/ml) and propidium iodide (0.1 mg/ml in 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.037 mg/ml EDTA) in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACScan and analyzed using CellQuest™ Pro software. DNA Laddering—Floating and adherent cells were collected and resuspended in TE/Triton buffer (0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). Following incubation on ice for 10 min, an aliquot of the lysate containing total DNA was removed, and the remaining lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatant containing low molecular weight DNA was transferred to a fresh tube and treated with DNase-free RNase A (60 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37°C. SDS (0.5%) and proteinase K (150 μg/ml) were added, and the samples were incubated for 1 h at 50 °C.DNAwas precipitated by addition of 0.1 volume of 0.5 m NaCl and 1.0 volume isopropanol, followed by incubation on ice for 10 min. Following centrifugation, DNA was resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) and fractionated on 2% agarose gels. Immunostaining—DNA synthesis was assessed by BrdUrd incorporation as described in Kupperman et al. (10Kupperman E. Wofford D. Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For active caspase-3 and γ-H2AX staining, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 min, and stained with primary and secondary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Images were captured on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope fitted with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER digital camera using Axiovision 4.2 software. Western Blotting—Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS) plus protease inhibitors. Protein content in clarified lysates was assayed using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Incubations with primary antibodies were performed overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and detection via chemiluminescence. Kinase Assays—For PKC assays, infected cells were scraped in isotonic buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors, sonicated, and clarified by centrifugation. Protein concentration was determined, and samples were dispensed into 20-μl aliquots in triplicate. 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 25 μm ATP, 7.5 mm MgAc, 10 μm PKCα pseudosubstrate peptide (12Kazanietz M.G.

Reactions were terminated by spotting 25 μl of reaction mixture onto Whatman PE-81 paper. Papers were washed in 0.1 m phosphoric acid, rinsed in acetone, and air dried prior to counting. Results are presented as counts per min (CPM)/μg of protein. For Cdk-2 assays, Cdk-2 was immunoprecipitated (Cdk-2 (M2) goat, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), washed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate) containing protease inhibitors, followed by kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and in vitro kinase assays performed as described in Lewis et al.

PKCδ Induces Aberrant Cell Cycle Progression—Phorbol esters stimulate proliferation and impair differentiated function in thyroid epithelial cells. Because differentiated function is an important prognostic indicator for patients with thyroid tumors (14Sherman S.I. Lancet. 2003; 361: 501-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar), the identity of the PKC isozymes responsible for these effects is important to ascertain. To elucidate the contributions of PKCα, -δ, and -ϵ, the phorbol ester-responsive isozymes expressed in Wistar rat thyroid cells (15Fernandez N. Caloca M.J. Prendergast G.V. Meinkoth J.L. Kazanietz M.G. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), to the regulation of thyroid cell proliferation and function, we utilized adenoviruses to overexpress individual PKC isozymes. Quiescent Wistar rat thyroid cells were infected with adenoviruses expressing PKCα, -δ, or -ϵ at varying multiplicities of infection and kinase activity measured in cell lysates prepared at day 2 post-infection. Conditions were derived under which each isozyme exhibited a modest 2-fold increase over endogenous PKC activity, and could be selectively activated with a dose of TPA to which uninfected cells did not respond (2Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Bernabo J.L. Caamano J. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Li L. Yuspa S.H. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7574-7582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Western blotting indicated that the PKC isozymes were substantially overexpressed under these conditions (Fig. 1C). Immunostaining experiments conducted with PKC-selective antibodies revealed that >95% of the cells were infected under these conditions (data not shown). Flow cytometry analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells revealed that PKCδ selectively induced cell cycle entry. Expression of PKCδ decreased the proportion of G1 phase cells and significantly increased the number of S phase cells (Fig. 1A). The effects of PKCδ on S phase entry were similar in the presence and absence of TPA activation. Strikingly, the effects of PKCδ on cell cycle progression were not reproduced by PKCα or -ϵ even following expression at higher levels than PKCδ and in the presence or absence of phorbol ester treatment. At the concentration used, TPA failed to stimulate cell cycle progression in mock infected cells (Fig. 1A, lower panel). To corroborate these data, the effects of PKCδ on molecular markers of cell cycle progression were analyzed. PKCδ stimulated the expression of cyclins A and E, as well as of Cdk-2, the catalytic partner for the G1 phase cyclins (Fig. 2A). Expression was increased beginning at day 2 post-infection and sustained over 4 days. The up-regulation of cyclins and Cdk-2 was functional, as evidenced by the sustained increase in Cdk-2 activity (Fig. 2B). Intriguingly, PKCδ-infected cells did not progress into G2/M (Fig. 1A), suggesting that these cells fail to complete the cell cycle. This is most clearly seen in Fig. 3A where PKCδ stimulated a time-dependent increase in S phase cells (days 2–3) without a coordinate increase in G2 phase cells (days 2–5). This pattern was strikingly different from that observed following mitogenic (3H) treatment of quiescent cells (Fig. 3C). PKCδ-infected cells arrested with a DNA content that was greater than that of G1 phase (3H, 30 h) cells and less than that of G2/M phase (3H plus nocodazole) cells. In agreement with these data, PKCδ failed to stimulate cyclin B1 expression, a marker of G2 phase cells (Fig. 2A). Together, these results indicate that a modest increase in PKCδ activity is sufficient to induce exit from quiescence, but not to stimulate cell proliferation. Rather, PKCδ-expressing cells proceed through G1 phase and subsequently arrest in S phase. PKCδ-stimulated S Phase Arrest Is Followed by Apoptosis—The proportion of PKCδ-infected S phase cells declined over time, commensurate with an increase in the proportion of cells containing hypodiploid DNA (Figs. 3A and 4). Despite their similar activities, PKCα and -ϵ did not stimulate hypodiploid DNA content in the presence or absence of TPA activation (Fig. 4). Similar to its effects on cell cycle progression, hypodiploid DNA content induced by PKCδ did not require TPA activation. To document that the effects of PKCδ on hypodiploid DNA content reflected apoptosis, caspase-3 cleavage was examined. Western blotting using an antibody that detects pro-caspase-3 and activated (cleaved) forms of caspase-3 revealed the presence of cleaved caspase-3 in lysates prepared from detached (floating) PKCδ-infected cells (Fig. 5A). The abundance of intact pro-caspase-3 was markedly reduced in these cells. Longer exposures of the Western blot shown in Fig. 5A revealed the presence of cleaved caspase-3 in adherent cells (data not shown), indicating that cleavage was not secondary to cell detachment. Nonetheless, to confirm that apoptosis was initiated in adherent cells, we analyzed the expression of active caspase-3 using an antibody that selectively recognizes the cleaved form of caspase-3. Staining for active caspase-3 was first detected at day 3 post-infection and increased over time (Fig. 5B). The caspase-3 positive cells invariably exhibited an apoptotic nuclear morphology assessed by DAPI staining. Active caspase-3 staining was abolished following treatment with the pancaspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh (QVD) (Fig. 5B). Finally, PKCδ stimulated QVD-sensitive DNA laddering, confirming that cell death was apoptotic (Fig. 5C). PKCδ is subject to caspase-dependent cleavage, generating a C-terminal fragment containing an intact kinase domain (16Reyland M.E. Anderson S.M. Matassa A.A. Barzen K.A. Quissell D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19115-19123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). DeVries et al. (17DeVries T.A. Neville M.C. Reyland M.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6050-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) reported that overexpression of the PKCδ fragment resulted in its accumulation in the nucleus and the induction of apoptosis. Western blotting with a C-terminal-directed antibody failed to reveal the presence of significant amounts of the PKCδ fragment in apoptotic thyroid cells (data not shown), hence we do not believe PKCδ cleavage initiates apoptosis in these cells. Given that apoptosis temporally follows the accumulation of cells in S phase, we reasoned that PKCδ-infected cells die from S phase. Indeed, inhibition of apoptosis with QVD prevented the accumulation of cells with hypodiploid DNA and markedly increased the proportion of S phase cells (Fig. 3B). This result, together with the absence of cyclin B1 expression as well as of G2/M phase cells (Figs. 1 and 2), strongly suggests that expression of PKCδ stimulates S phase arrest that culminates in apoptosis. PKCδ Activates the DNA Damage Response Pathway—We set out to confirm the effects of PKCδ on S phase entry by monitoring effects on DNA synthesis. DNA synthesis was examined by incorporation of the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) into replicating DNA (10Kupperman E. Wofford D. Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Unlike mitogen-treated thyroid cells where BrdUrd labeling is uniform (13Lewis A.E. Fikaris A.J. Prendergast G.V. Meinkoth J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2321-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 18Tsygankova O.M. Saavedra A. Rebhun J.F. Quilliam L.A. Meinkoth J.L. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 5882-5891Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), BrdUrd localized to punctate foci in PKCδ-infected cells (Fig. 6A). The significance of these foci remains to be determined; however, they are reminiscent of the foci observed following stalled replication and/or DNA damage (20Sengupta S. Linke S.P. Pedeux R. Yang Q. Farnsworth J. Garfield S.H. Valerie K. Shay J.W. Ellis N.A. Wasylyk B. Harris C.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1210-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 21Dimitrova D.S. Gilbert D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 686-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate whether PKCδ activated the DNA damage response pathway. ATR-, ATM-, and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) are key mediators of the cellular response to DNA damage. These PI3K-like kinases are activated by replication stress and DNA double strand breaks. Activation of ATR/ATM results in the phosphorylation and activation of downstream substrates, notably Chk-1 and Chk-2. Stalled replication is a robust stimulator of ATR activity and culminates in the activating phosphorylation of Chk-1 on serine 345 (22Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PKCδ, but not PKCα, stimulated Chk-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 6B). Phosphorylation was maximal at day 2 post-infection, similar to the time course over which PKCδ stimulated DNA synthesis (data not shown). To confirm the activation of cell cycle checkpoints, the effects of PKCδ on p53 phosphorylation were examined. ATR and ATM phosphorylate p53 on serine 15 (23Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kacmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2534) Google Scholar). PKCδ stimulated p53 phosphorylation at this site, whereas PKCα failed to do so (Fig. 6C). Phosphorylation of p53 in PKCδ-expressing cells was maximal at day 2 post-infection with significant phosphorylation also observed at day 3. To further document checkpoint activation, we assessed the effects of PKCδ on the phosphorylation of histone H2AX (designated γ-H2AX), an indicator of DNA double strand breaks (24Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4162) Google Scholar). Immunostaining experiments revealed an increase in γ-H2AX staining as early as day 2 post-infection (Fig. 6D). Thus, γ-H2AX staining temporally coincided with BrdUrd incorporation and Chk-1 and p53 phosphorylation. In contrast, caspase-3 activation was first detected at day 3 post-infection (Fig. 5B), suggesting that it followed checkpoint activation. To eliminate the possibility that DNA cleavage itself induced checkpoint activation, the effects of PKCδ on checkpoint activity were examined in the presence of the caspase inhibitor QVD. QVD had no effect on the ability of PKCδ to stimulate Chk-1, p53, or H2AX phosphorylation (Fig. 6, B and C, and data not shown). These data support a model wherein PKCδ stimulates replication stress, leading to checkpoint activation and ultimately, apoptosis. PKCδ-stimulated Apoptosis Requires Cell Cycle Entry—PKCδ has been reported to activate JNK (25Reyland M.E. Barzen K.A. Anderson S.M. Quissell D.O. Matassa A.A. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1200-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26Mitsutake N. Namba H. Shklyaev S.S. Tsukazaki T. Ohtsuru A. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Ayabe H. Yamashita S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and to require p38 or ERK for induction of apoptosis (4Tanaka Y. Gavrielides M.V. Mitsuuchi Y. Fujii T. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33753-33762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 27Lee Y.J. Soh J.W. Dean N.M. Cho C.K. Kim T.H. Lee S.J. Lee Y.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 2002; 13: 237-246PubMed Google Scholar). Pharmacological inhibitors of JNK (SP600125), p38 (SB203580), and MEK1 (UO126) were used to determine whether PKCδ-stimulated apoptosis requires activity of these MAPK family members. None of these inhibitors impaired DNA laddering induced by PKCδ (Fig. 7A). Intriguingly, treatment with the pan-PKC inhibitor GF109203X also failed to impair DNA laddering. To further examine whether kinase activity was required for PKCδ-stimulated apoptosis, the effects of kinase-deficient PKCδ were examined. Following expression at levels similar to wild type PKCδ (data not shown), kinase-deficient PKCδ stimulated apoptosis as assessed by hypodiploid DNA content (Fig. 7B). Therefore, kinase activity is not strictly required for the effects of PKCδ on apoptosis in thyroid cells. Indeed, kinase-dependent and -independent effects of PKCδ on apoptosis have been previously reported (28Clark A.S. West K.A. Blumberg P.M. Dennis P.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 780-786PubMed Google Scholar, 29Goerke A. Sakai N. Gutjahr E. Schlapkohl W.A. Mushinski J.F. Haller H. Kolch W. Saito N. Mischak H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32054-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Given that apoptosis temporally follows a delay in S phase, we set out to determine whether inhibition of cell cycle entry would prevent apoptosis. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity is required for thyroid cell proliferation (19Cass L.A. Summers S.A. Prendergast G.V. Backer J.M. Birnbaum M.J. Meinkoth J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 5882-5891Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Therefore, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was used to investigate the consequences of cell cycle inhibition on PKCδ-stimulated apoptosis. Unlike the other inhibitors tested, LY294002 abolished DNA laddering (Fig. 7A). FACS analysis confirmed that LY294002 blocked the accumulation of cells containing hypodiploid DNA and that this inhibitor prevented S phase entry (Fig. 7C). Consistent with the latter effect, LY294002 abolished DNA synthesis in PKCδ-expressing cells (Fig. 7D). PDK-1 phosphorylates PKCδ on T505, a modification that increases kinase activity. Because PDK-1 is downstream of PI3K, we considered the possibility that LY294002 inhibited PKCδ kinase activity. Pretreatment of PKCδ-infected cells with LY294002 (data not shown), or addition of LY294002 directly to in vitro kinase assays, did not impair PKCδ kinase activity (Fig. 7E). Additionally, LY294002 had no effect on PKCδ expression (Fig. 8A). Therefore, we speculate that the inhibitory effects of LY294002 on apoptosis are mediated predominantly through its ability to block S phase entry. In agreement with this notion, the JNK, MEK1, and p38 inhibitors were less effective than LY294002 in preventing S phase entry (Fig. 7C) and DNA synthesis (Fig. 7D). The PKC inhibitor GF109203X only partially reduced PKCδ-stimulated DNA synthesis. To further establish that checkpoint activation arose as a consequence of delayed progress through S phase, the effects of LY294002 on PKCδ-stimulated Chk-1 and p53 phosphorylation were investigated. Interestingly, treatment with PI3K (LY294002), MEK1 (UO126), p38 (SB203580), or JNK (SP600125) inhibitors blocked or significantly impaired Chk-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 8A). However, these inhibitors differed in their ability to block PKCδ-induced p53 phosphorylation. Only the PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) completely inhibited p53 phosphorylation. Because LY294002 is known to inhibit ATR, ATM, and DNA-PK activity (30Izzard R.A. Jackson S.P. Smith G.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2581-2586PubMed Google Scholar, 31Rosenzweig K.E. Youmell M.B.

DNA Repair (Amst). 2004; 3: 753-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) its effects on Chk-1 phosphorylation were assessed. In contrast to its effects on PKCδ-stimulated Chk-1 phosphorylation, LY294002 failed to inhibit Chk-1 phosphorylation in response to aphidicolon (an inhibitor of replication, and positive control for ATR activation/Chk-1 phosphorylation) (Fig. 8B). Therefore, at the concentration used in these studies, LY294002 does not directly inhibit ATR activity. Cumulatively, these data suggest that replication stress in response to PKCδ expression initiates a checkpoint response that results in apoptosis (Fig. 9). Using adenoviruses to elicit a 2-fold increase in PKC activity, we compared the cellular consequences associated with selective overexpression of PKCα, -δ, and -ϵ. Remarkably, overexpression of PKCδ in quiescent thyroid epithelial cells was sufficient to stimulate G1/S phase cell cycle progression. Rather than completing the cell cycle, PKCδ-expressing cells arrested in S phase, and ultimately perished by caspase-dependent apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1991011186,"AF6 is involved in the connection of membrane-associated proteins to the actin cytoskeleton. It binds to Ras-like small GTPases and is suggested to be an effector of both Ras and Rap. Here we show that knockdown of AF6 in T cells by RNA interference enhanced Rap1-induced integrin-mediated cell adhesion, whereas overexpression of AF6 had the opposite effect. Interestingly, AF6-induced inhibition of cell adhesion correlated with an increase in RapGTP levels. Like AF6, protein KIAA1849 contains a Ras association domain and interacted with Rap1. However, KIAA1849 did not inhibit Rap1-induced cell adhesion. We concluded that AF6 is a negative regulator of Rap-induced cell adhesion. We proposed that AF6 inhibits Rap-mediated cell adhesion by sequestering RapGTP in an unproductive complex and thus prevents the interaction of Rap1 not only with effectors that mediate adhesion but also with Rap GTPase-activating proteins. Thus, AF6 may buffer RapGTP in resting T cells and maintain them in a non-adherent state. AF6 is involved in the connection of membrane-associated proteins to the actin cytoskeleton.

Interestingly, AF6-induced inhibition of cell adhesion correlated with an increase in RapGTP levels. Like AF6, protein KIAA1849 contains a Ras association domain and interacted with Rap1. However, KIAA1849 did not inhibit Rap1-induced cell adhesion. We concluded that AF6 is a negative regulator of Rap-induced cell adhesion. We proposed that AF6 inhibits Rap-mediated cell adhesion by sequestering RapGTP in an unproductive complex and thus prevents the interaction of Rap1 not only with effectors that mediate adhesion but also with Rap GTPase-activating proteins. Thus, AF6 may buffer RapGTP in resting T cells and maintain them in a non-adherent state. Rap proteins (Rap1a, -1b, -2a, and -2b) are small GTPases closely related to Ras. They are activated by a variety of extracellular signals through the regulation of specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins (GAP 2The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; RA, Ras association; RapL, regulator of adhesion and polarization enriched in lymphoid tissues; Riam, Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule; 007, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2′-O-methyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mGppNHp, 2′-/3′-O-(N′-methylanthraniloyl)-guanyl-5′-yl-imidodiphosphate; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; AF6L, AF6-like; TK, thymidine kinase.2The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; RA, Ras association; RapL, regulator of adhesion and polarization enriched in lymphoid tissues; Riam, Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule; 007, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2′-O-methyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mGppNHp, 2′-/3′-O-(N′-methylanthraniloyl)-guanyl-5′-yl-imidodiphosphate; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; AF6L, AF6-like; TK, thymidine kinase.(s)) (1Bos J.L.

Rap1 is involved in various cellular processes, most notably, the regulation of integrin-mediated cell adhesion and cadherin-mediated cell junction formation (2Knox A.L. Brown N.H.

Biol. 2005; 17: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). These effectors include RapL and Riam (6Lafuente E.M. van Puijenbroek A.A. Krause M. Carman C.V. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A.

Immunol. 2003; 4: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Both proteins interact with Rap1 through a Ras association (RA) domain and mediate Rap-induced integrin-dependent cell adhesion. RapL may function by direct binding to both Rap1 and integrins, whereas Riam may function through an interaction with the actin-regulatory proteins profilin and Ena/Vasp. Arap3 is another RA domain containing protein that interacts with Rap1. This protein is an Arf- and RhoGAP and mediates Rap1-induced inactivation of Rho (9Krugmann S. Williams R. Stephens L. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1380-1384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, not all effectors of Rap1 have a RA domain. For instance, Vav2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPase Rac, binds to Rap1 through its PH domain and mediates Rap-induced cell spreading (10Arthur W.T. Quilliam L.A. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).AF6 (also called afadin) has a N-terminal region containing two RAs, one of which interacts with Ras-like small GTPases, including Ras and Rap (11Boettner B.

This protein was first identified as the fusion partner of ALL-1 protein in human acute myeloid leukemia (14Prasad R. Gu Y. Alder H. Nakamura T. Canaani O. Saito H. Huebner K. Gale R.P. Nowell P.C. Kuriyama K. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5624-5628PubMed Google Scholar). AF6 is a multidomain actin-binding protein that serves as a scaffold protein between cell membrane-associated proteins and the actin cytoskeleton (11Boettner B. Govek E.E. Cross J. Van Aelst L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9064-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Among the proteins that interact with AF6 are the tight junction protein ZO-1, the cell-cell adherence junction molecule nectin, various Eph receptors and the actin-regulatory protein profilin (11Boettner B.

AF6 was found to be an effector for Ras in the control of cell junction formation via direct interaction with ZO-1 (15Yamamoto T. Harada N. Kano K. Taya S. Canaani E. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In addition, in Drosophila, the AF-6 homolog Canoe is an effector of Rap in the regulation of dorsal closure (18Boettner B. Harjes P. Ishimaru S. Heke M. Fan H.Q. Qin Y. Van Aelst L. Gaul U. Genetics. 2003; 165: 159-169PubMed Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that AF6 can interact with Rap GAPs, such as Rap1GAP and SpaI through its PDZ domain (19Su L. Hattori M. Moriyama M. Murata N. Harazaki M. Kaibuchi K. Minato N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15232-15238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This interaction is mediated by a conserved internal β-turn in the Rap GAPs. AF6 recruits Rap GAPs to negatively regulate the level of Rap1GTP and consequently Rap1-induced integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Because these functional studies were largely performed in overexpression systems, we addressed the question whether AF6 is involved in the control of cell adhesion induced by activation of endogenous Rap and depletion of endogenous AF6. Specific activation of endogenous Rap can be achieved using the cAMP analogue 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP (007) that specifically activates Epac (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP) (20Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Døskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Indeed we observed that activation of Rap1-induced adhesion is negatively regulated by AF6. Importantly, knockdown of AF6 in T cells results in an enhancement of Rap-mediated cell adhesion. Surprisingly, inhibition of Rap1-induced cell adhesion by AF6 correlated with an increase, rather than a decrease in RapGTP. We propose a mechanism of AF6-induced inhibition of Rap1-mediated cell adhesion that includes the sequestration of Rap1GTP in an unproductive complex with AF6 preventing the interaction of Rap1 with both Rap GAPs and effectors of Rap-induced cell adhesion. Thus, AF6 may buffer RapGTP in resting T cells and maintain them in a non-adherent state.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids and Constructs—Hemaglutamin (HA)-tagged Rap1, Rap1V12 (HA-RapV12), and Rap1GAP (HA-RapGAP I) have previously been described (21Zwartkruis F.J. Wolthuis R.M. Nabben N.M. Franke B. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5905-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). PCR fragments containing AF6 or AF6-ΔRA (residues 347–1612) flanked by a KpnI site at the 5′ and a NotI site at the 3′ were amplified from AF6 cDNA, provided by Dr. Eli Canaani (Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel) and subcloned into KpnI/NotI sites of a pGEM-T vector (Promega). Subsequently, these fragments were subcloned into KpnI/NotI-digested pcDNA3-HA, and integrities of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Myc-AF6-RA (residues 25–353) was generated by PCR amplification of a fragment flanked by a EcoRI site at the 5′ and a NotI site at the 3′ of AF6 from AF6 cDNA. This fragment was subcloned into EcoRI/NotI-digested pcDNA3-Myc vector. Full-length Myc tagged AF6 was provided by Dr. Kaibuchi Kozo (Division of Signal Transduction, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Japan). The AF6L (KIAA1849) cDNA containing the coding sequence was kindly provided by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (22Nagase T. Nakayama M. Nakajima D. Kikuno R. Ohara O. DNA Res. 2001; 8: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction fragments containing AF6L or AF6L-RA (residues 25–213) flanked by a SalI site at the 5′ and a NotI site at the 3′ were subcloned into the pGEM-T vector. These clones were subsequently used to generate HA-AF6L or HA-AF6L-RA by introducing the SalI/NotI fragment containing AF6L or AF6L-RA into SalI/NotI-digested pMT2-SM-HA.Rap1 Activation Assays and Immunoblotting—Rap1 activation was assayed as described previously (23de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and active Rap was precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose beads precoupled to a GST fusion protein of the Ras association domain of Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator. Precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and solubilized in SDS sample buffer. A portion of the cell lysate was reserved for analysis of total Rap content. HA-Rap1 was detected following Western blotting with anti-HA antibodies.GST Pull-down Assays—For HA-AF6 and HA-AF6L pull-down assays, glutathione-agarose beads were loaded with GST-Rap1. HB6 cells were transfected with HA-AF6 or HA-AF6L, followed by cell lysis in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% piridinium betain, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Cell extracts were incubated with GST-immobilized proteins for 1 h at 4°C. After 4 times washing in lysis buffer, bound proteins were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and HA-AF6 or HA-AF6L were detected by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody.Western Blotting—Western blotting of all protein samples was carried out using polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The antibodies used for protein detection are the monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5), monoclonal anti-Myc (9E10), monoclonal anti-AF6 (Transduction Laboratories), monoclonal anti-tubulin (Oncogene Science).Cell Culture, Cell Line, and Transfection—The Epac I monoclonal Jurkat T cell line (HB6) was generated by retroviral transduction of Jurkat cells with amphotropic virus encoding Epac-IRES-GFP. 3L. S. Price and J. L. Bos, manuscript in preparation. HB6 cells were grown at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated (30 min at 56 °C) fetal bovine serum and 0.05% glutamine in the presence of penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were transiently transfected by electroporation using 35 μg of plasmid DNA in total. Cells (1.2 × 107 cells/ml in 0.4 ml of complete medium) were pulsed at 250 V and 960 μF with 5 μg of TK-luciferase plasmid DNA, construct plasmid as indicated in the figure legends, and added vector plasmid to keep DNA amounts constant. Subsequently, 24 h after transfection, cells were transferred to serum-free medium and used 42 h after transfection. For RNA interference experiments, cells were transferred to serum-free medium 48 h after transfection and used 72 h after transfection.Adhesion Assay—For adhesion assays, transiently transfected Jurkat cells serum-starved overnight were harvested, washed, and resuspended in TSM buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2) at a concentration of 5×105 cells/ml. 24-Well Nunc Maxisorp plates (Corning) were coated with fibronectin (5 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C, washed, and blocked for 1 h at 37°C with 1% bovine serum albumin, TSM. After washing, 200 μl of TSM was added per well with or without the indicated stimuli. 007 (BioLog) was used at 100 μm and Mn2+ was used at 4 mm. Subsequently, 200 μl of cell suspension was added per well. Cells were allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37°C, and nonadherent cells were removed with warmed 0.5% bovine serum albumin, TSM. Adherent cells were lysed and subjected to a luciferase assay as described previously (24Medema R.H. de Laat W.L. Martin G.A. McCormick F. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3425-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Expression of transfected constructs was confirmed by immunoblotting of total cell lysates. Adherent cells were calculated, and the cell numbers were corrected for transfection efficiency and nonspecific effects of constructs by measuring luciferase activity of total input cells ((counts in cells bound/counts in total input cells) × 100%).Small Interfering RNA Preparation—To make pTER-AF6, gene-specific oligonucleotides were ligated into pTER vector that had been digested with BglII and HindIII according to described protocol (25van de Wetering M. Oving I. Muncan V. Pon Fong M.T. Brantjes H. van Leenen D. Holstege F.C. Brummelkamp T.R. Agami R. Clevers H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used are, for AF6 shRNA1, 5′-gatcccgatgatcgggaaggcagatttcaagagaatctgccttcccgatcatctttttggaaa-3′ and 5′-agcttttccaaaaagatgatcgggaaggcagattctcttgaaatctgccttcccgatcatcgg-3′ and for AF6 shRNA2, 5′-gatcccggagagagctgacgggtctttcaagagaagacccgtcagctctctcctttttggaaa-3′ and 5′-agcttttccaaaaaggagagagctgacgggtcttctcttgaaagacccgtcagctctctcc-3′.GDI Measurements—Experiments were carried out as described previously (13Linnemann T. Geyer M. Jaitner B.K. Block C. Kalbitzer H.R. Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13556-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In brief, 100 nm Rap loaded with the non-hydrolyzable, fluorescent GTP analog mGppNHp were incubated in the presence of 10 μm non-labeled nucleotide and various concentrations of the RA-domain AF6L. Fluorescence was measured with a Cary Eclipse (Varian, Australia) equipped with a temperature controlled multicuvette holder.RESULTSTo determine whether AF6 is involved in Rap1-induced cell adhesion, a Jurkat cell line stably expressing Epac (HB6 cells) was used. Cells were transfected with AF6 together with or without constitutive active Rap1V12 and analyzed for their ability to adhere to fibronectin. As shown in Fig. 1A, AF6 completely inhibited Rap1V12-induced cell adhesion. However, AF6 did not inhibit Mn2+-induced cell adhesion, where integrins are activated directly by divalent cations (26Dransfield I. Cabañas C. Craig A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Also, the stimulating effect of Rap1V12 on Mn2+-induced cell adhesion was completely inhibited by AF6. To investigate whether cell adhesion mediated by endogenous Rap1 is also inhibited by AF6, we treated HB6 cells with the Epac-specific analogue 007 to activate Epac and consequently Rap (20Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Døskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Like Rap1V12-induced adhesion, 007-induced adhesion was inhibited by the overexpression of AF6 (Fig. 1B). AF6 interacts with Rap via RA domains in its N-terminal region (11Boettner B. Govek E.E. Cross J. Van Aelst L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9064-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 13Linnemann T. Geyer M. Jaitner B.K. Block C. Kalbitzer H.R. Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13556-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the interaction of AF6 with Rap is required for its ability to inhibit adhesion, an N-terminal deletion mutant lacking the RA domains was made, namely AF6-ΔRA (deletion of residues 1–346). Pull-down experiments with immobilized Rap1 demonstrated the inability of AF6-ΔRA to interact with Rap1 (Fig. 2A). In contrast to full-length AF6, AF6-ΔRA was not able to inhibit 007-induced adhesion in HB6 cells (Fig. 2B). Conversely, the isolated RA domain of AF6 (residue 1–420) was able to inhibit 007-induced adhesion (Fig. 2C). Surprisingly, full-length AF6 was much more efficient in inhibiting 007-induced cell adhesion than the isolated RA domain. From these results we concluded that in HB6 cells, expression of AF6 inhibits Rap-induced cell adhesion. Furthermore, we concluded that although the RA domains are required for this inhibition, additional domains are required for efficient inhibition.FIGURE 2Inhibition of cell adhesion by AF6 requires the RA domains of AF6. A, AF6 and Rap interaction requires the AF6 RA domains. Purified GST-Rap1 was used to precipitate HA-AF6 and HA-AF6-ΔRA from HB6 cells transiently transfected with either HA-AF6 or HA-AF6-ΔRA. The blot was probed with anti-HA antibody. Expression of each protein was determined by immunoblotting of the straight lysates. B, deletion of the RA domain abolishes AF6-induced inhibition of cell adhesion. HB6 cells were cotransfected with TK luciferase reporter plasmid and empty vector, AF6, or AF6-ΔRA. Adhesion was measured as indicated in legends Fig. 1. In the bottom panel expression levels of transfected proteins are shown. Results are representative of three independent experiments. FN, fibronectin. C, the AF6-RA domain blocks Rap-induced adhesion less efficient than full-length AF6. HB6 cells were cotransfected with TK luciferase reporter plasmid and either AF6 or indicated amounts of AF6-RA domain and adhesion was measured as indicated in legend Fig. 1. Results are representative of three independent experiments. Bottom panel, expression levels of transfected proteins. D, AF6 efficiently increases GTP level of overexpressed Rap1. HB6 cells were cotransfected with empty vector, HA-AF6, or HA-AF6-ΔRA in combination with HA-Rap1. The upper panel shows the GTP levels of the HA-Rap proteins determined using the pull-down assay (see “Materials and Methods”), the middle panel shows the level of HA-Rap1 in the total lysates, and the lower panel shows the expression of HA-AF6 and HA-AF6-ΔRA in the total lysates. The experiment was repeated three times with reproducible results. E, AF6 increases GTP level of endogenous Rap1. HB6 cells were cotransfected with empty vector or HA-AF6. The left panel shows the GTP levels of the Rap proteins determined using the pull-down assay (see “Materials and Methods”), the right panel shows the level of endogenous Rap1 in the total lysates and the overexpression of AF6 in the total lysates. The experiment was repeated three times with reproducible results. WB, Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Previously, it was shown that AF6 binds to the RapGAP SpaI and that AF6 enhanced the SpaI-induced decrease in Rap1GTP levels (19Su L. Hattori M. Moriyama M. Murata N. Harazaki M. Kaibuchi K. Minato N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15232-15238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of AF6 expression on Rap1GTP levels, HA-Rap1 and HA-AF6 were cotransfected in HB6 cells, and the levels of Rap1GTP were determined by a pull-down assay. Surprisingly, AF6 strongly increased the level of HA-RapGTP (Fig. 2D). In contrast, AF6-ΔRA did not influence Rap1GTP levels. We further investigated the effect of AF6 expression on the change of endogenous Rap1GTP level in cells. Expression of AF6 resulted in an increase in endogenous Rap1GTP level (Fig. 2E). From these results we concluded that AF6 binds to Rap1 through its RA domains and stabilizes Rap1 in the GTP-bound state. This result further suggests that the observed inhibition of cell adhesion by AF6 may be because of sequestration of Rap1 in an unproductive complex.To investigate whether the negative effect of AF6 on cell adhesion is specific, we used shRNA to knock-down AF6. For that purpose HB6 cells were transiently transfected with two different shRNA constructs. Both resulted in a significant decrease of the endogenous AF6 levels (Fig. 3A). In these experiments the transfection efficiency was between 50 and 70% as measured by green fluorescent protein cotransfection, indicating that the two shRNA constructs function rather efficiently in knocking down the endogenous AF6. Importantly, both AF6 shRNAs resulted in an increased integrin-mediated adhesion (Fig. 3B). To investigate whether AF6 shRNA-induced cell adhesion is Rap-dependent, we introduced Rap1GAP to inhibit endogenous Rap (27Rubinfeld B. Munemitsu S. Clark R. Conroy L. Watt K. Crosier W.J. McCormick F. Polakis P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Indeed, Rap1GAP completely inhibited AF6 shRNA-induced cell adhesion (Fig. 3C). Moreover, knockdown of AF6 further enhanced 007-induced adhesion (Fig. 3D). Although overexpression of AF6 resulted in an increased level of Rap1GTP, it could well be that the increased adhesion by AF6 knockdown is caused by increased levels of Rap1GTP. We therefore tested the level of Rap1GTP in the presence of AF6 shRNA. HB6 cells were transiently transfected with AF6 shRNA and Rap1, stimulated with or without 007 and the level of RapGTP was determined by the pull-down assay. Knockdown of AF6 did not increase the level of Rap1GTP but slightly decreased particularly the basal level of Rap1GTP (Fig. 3E). From these results we concluded that endogenous AF6 is a negative regulator of Rap-induced cell adhesion.FIGURE 3AF6 depletion increases adhesion. A, AF6 shRNA decreases protein expression. HB6 cells were transfected with 30μg of indicated shRNA constructs and grown for 72 h. In control experiments using GFP we observed more than 50% transfection efficiency using this protocol. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-AF6 antibody. Anti-tubulin was used to demonstrate equal loading. WB, Western blot. B, AF6 shRNA induces cell adhesion. HB6 cells were cotransfected with TK luciferase reporter plasmid and the indicated shRNA constructs. After 72 h cells were replated and seeded in triplicate wells coated with fibronectin (FN), and after 1 h the percentage of adherent cells were measured. Results are representative of three independent experiments. C, AF6 shRNA-induced cell adhesion is Rap-dependent. HB6 cells were transfected with TK luciferase reporter plasmid, together with empty vector, Rap1GAP, AF6 shRNA2, or Rap1GAP and AF6 shRNA2. Adhesion was measured as indicated above. Results are representative of three independent experiments. In the bottom panel expression of transfected Rap1GAP is shown. D, AF6 shRNA enhances 007-induced cell adhesion. HB6 cells were transfected with TK luciferase reporter plasmid, together with either empty vector or AF6 shRNA2, and adhesion was measured in the presence of 007 (concentration of 007 as indicated in the figure) as indicated above. Results are representative of three independent experiments. E, AF6 depletion slightly decreases the Rap1GTP levels. HB6 cells were transfected with HA-Rap1 and either empty vector or AF6 shRNA2. After 72 h the level of Rap1GTP was measured by the pull-down assays. The experiment was repeated three times with reproducible results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In search for effectors of the Rap family we identified a protein (KIAA1849) in the Kazusa DNA data base with similarities to AF6 (Fig. 4A). KIAA1849 is characterized by an N-terminal RA domain and a C-terminal PDZ domain. Because of its similarity to AF6 on domain structure, we called this protein AF6-like (AF6L) (Fig. 4A). We then investigated whether the AF6L can interact with Rap1. Indeed, like AF6, AF6L can be recovered from cell lysate using GST-Rap1 (Fig. 4B). This interaction was further characterized with recombinant AF6L-RA (residues 25–213). The binding of effector proteins to small G-protein often results in a reduced exchange of nucleotide bound to the G-protein (GDI-effect) (28Herrmann C. Nassar N. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The dissociation of a fluorescently labeled nucleotide bound to Rap can be detected as a decrease of fluorescence intensity in the presence of an excess unlabeled nucleotide. Indeed, increasing concentration of AF6L-RA reduced the exchange rate of nucleotide bound to Rap1 (Fig. 4C). From this measurement an affinity for the interaction of AF6L-RA and Rap1 of 0.9 μm was determined. This is similar to the affinity of AF6-RA for Rap1 (0.25 μm) (13Linnemann T. Geyer M. Jaitner B.K.

From these results we conclude that AF6L can interact with Rap1.FIGURE 4AF6L is not a negative regulator of Rap1 in cell adhesion. A, schematic comparison of AF6 and AF6L. AF6L consists of a RA domain in the N terminus and a PDZ domain in the C terminus. B, AF6L binds to Rap1 in a pull-down assay.

https://openalex.org/W2080950043,"Both transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced expression of biglycan (BGN) and activation of p38 MAPK have been implicated in cellular adhesion and migration. Here, we analyzed the role of adhesive events and the small GTPase Rac1 in TGF-β regulation of BGN. TGF-β1 induction of BGN expression and activation of p38 was abolished or strongly reduced when cells were kept in suspension or exposed to either the actin cytoskeleton-disrupting agent cytochalasin D or a specific chemical Rac1 inhibitor. Ectopic expression of a dominant negative mutant (T17N) of Rac1 abrogated both TGF-β-induced p38 MAPK activation and BGN up-regulation but did not affect TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of Smad3 or transcriptional induction of Growth Arrest DNA Damage 45β, previously shown to be crucial for TGF-β regulation of BGN. Overexpression of wild type Rac1 greatly enhanced the TGF-β effect on BGN in adherent cells, whereas ectopic expression of constitutively active Rac1 (Q61L) activated p38 and in the presence of exogenous TGF-β was able to rescue BGN expression in nonadherent cells. Endogenous Rac1 was activated by TGF-β treatment in PANC-1 cells in an adhesion-dependent fashion. Like Rac1-T17N, the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A blocked TGF-β-induced p38 activation and BGN expression, suggesting that Rac1 exerts its effect on BGN and p38 through increasing NADPH oxidase activity and subsequent production of reactive oxygen species. These results show that the TGF-β effect on BGN is dependent on cell adhesion and that activated Rac1, presumably acting through NADPH oxidase(s), is necessary but not sufficient for TGF-β-induced BGN expression.

Lett. 2002; 82: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 3Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). The cellular activities of TGF-β are mediated by specific receptor complexes that are assembled upon ligand binding and comprise the TGF-β type II receptor and the TGF-β type I receptor/activin receptor-like kinase 5 (4Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar). The activated ligand-receptor complex then activates intracellular signal transducers from the Smad family of proteins, which translocate to the nucleus to modulate the activity of TGF-β target genes (reviewed in Ref. 3Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). Besides the Smad pathway, other signaling pathways can be activated by TGF-β independently of or downstream of Smads, including p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (4Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar). Recently, TGF-β-dependent transcriptional induction of MyD118 (encoding growth arrest DNA damage 45 β (GADD45β)) has been shown to be Smad-dependent and to mediate the (delayed) activation of p38 by TGF-β (5Takekawa M. Tatebayashi K. Itoh F. Adachi M. Imai K. Saito H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6473-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, the regulation of p38 activation by TGF-β has turned out to be more complex, since it appears to depend also on integrin ligation (6Bhowmick N.A. Zent R. Ghiassi M. McDonnell M. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46707-46713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), suggesting that p38 activation represents a point of cross-talk between TGF-β receptor/Smad and adhesion/integrin signaling. The Rho family GTPases Rac and Cdc42 are known to transmit adhesion/integrin-related signals to MAPK activation being able to stimulate the p38 MAPK (and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase) pathway (7Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). It was thus not surprising that they have been implicated in TGF-β signaling, particularly TGF-β-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transdifferentiation (8Bakin A.V. Rinehart C. Tomlinson A.K. Arteaga C.L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3139-3206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is known to be associated with p38 activation, increased migration, scattering, and mobilization of the actin cytoskeleton (9Edlund S. Landstrom M. Heldin C.H. Aspenstrom P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 902-9149Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). TGF-β can also activate p38 through reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by NAD(P)H oxidase (10Chiu C. Maddock D.A. Zhang Q. Souza K.P. Townsend A.R. Wan Y. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 8: 251-255PubMed Google Scholar), a process that in turn depends on Rac1 as a subunit of this enzyme being absolutely required for its enzymatic activity (for a review, see Ref. 11Bokoch G.M. Diebold B.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 2692-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The three best characterized members of the Rho family of small GTPases, Rho, Rac1, and Cdc42, are small (190–250-residue) proteins that consist of a GTPase domain and short N- and C-terminal extensions. They bind to GDP and GTP with high affinity and are thought to cycle between active, GTP-bound and inactive, GDP-bound states (reviewed in Ref. 12Wennerberg K. Der C.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The conformation of the GTP-bound protein results in increased binding affinity for downstream effector proteins (e.g. p21-activated kinase 1) (7Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The activities of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 are themselves regulated in the process of cell adhesion, which is initiated by the binding of integrins to their extracellular matrix ligands. These small GTPases in turn regulate cell adhesion and changes in cell morphology by triggering dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton (13Kjoller L. Hall A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Finally, Rac1 (and Rac2) regulate the membrane-associated NADPH oxidase, a multicomponent enzyme that utilizes electrons derived from intracellular NADPH to generate ROS (11Bokoch G.M. Diebold B.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 2692-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 14Bokoch G.M. Knaus U.G. Trends Biochem.

Chem. 2004; 279: 51715-51718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Consistent with the essential role of Rac1, the activity of NADPH oxidase is dependent on both cell adhesion (see Ref. 17Zhao T. Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1732-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar and references therein) and tyrosine kinase activity (18Yang S. Hardaway M. Sun G. Ries W.L. Key Jr., L.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 78: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 19Dusi S. Della Bianca V. Donini M. Nadalini K.A. Rossi F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4615-4623PubMed Google Scholar) in human neutrophils. Recently, homologs of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase have been found in a variety of tissues. These new nonphagocytic NADPH oxidases/NADPH oxidase-like enzymes produce low levels of oxidants that appear to be used as signals for a variety of cellular activities, including cell growth and transformation. Biglycan (BGN) belongs to the family of small leucine-rich proteoglycans (20Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) and is functionally involved in matrix assembly, cellular migration and adhesion, and the regulation of growth factor (e.g. TGF-β activity) (reviewed in Refs. 21Wadhwa S.

Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 2004; 14: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). BGN is markedly up-regulated in fibrotic diseases, such as diabetic nephropathy (23Schaefer L. Raslik I.

Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), consistent with the central role of TGF-β in the pathogenesis of these diseases (26Yokoyama H.

Schmidt C. Ringel J. Kluth M. Muller P. Nizze H. Jesnowski R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 550-555PubMed Google Scholar) and as a regulatory factor for BGN. TGF-β signaling to BGN has revealed an unexpected degree of complexity. The TGF-β effect on BGN is strictly dependent on activation of the Smad (29Chen W.-B. Lenschow W. Tiede K. Fischer J.W. Kalthoff H. Ungefroren H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36118-36128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and the p38 pathway (30Ungefroren H. Lenschow W. Chen W.B. Faendrich F. Kalthoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11041-11049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and intermittent transcriptional induction of GADD45β (31Ungefroren H. Groth S. Ruhnke M. Kalthoff H. Fandrich F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2644-2652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In PANC-1 cells growing on tissue culture plastic, the TGF-β1-induced increase in p38 activation and BGN expression is associated with morphological changes of cellular hypertrophy and well formed actin stress fibers, characteristic of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transdifferentiation (32Ellenrieder V. Hendler S.F. Boeck W. Seufferlein T. Menke A. Ruhland C. Adler G. Gress T.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4222-4228PubMed Google Scholar). Prompted by our original observation that the p38 and BGN responses to TGF-β were lost in cells that were denied cell adhesion, in conjunction with the known role of Rho-like proteins and BGN in cellular adhesion/migration, we hypothesized that the TGF-β control of BGN, too, may involve Rho GTPases. The close functional association between TGF-β regulation of p38 and BGN further opened the possibility that signaling intermediates crucial for TGF-β activation of p38 are likely to be important for TGF-β regulation of BGN too. In the present study, we present evidence that both the activation of p38 and the induction of BGN expression by TGF-β require activation of Rac1. We further show that Rac1 probably promotes the TGF-β effect on p38 activation and BGN expression as part of the NADPH oxidase complex. Antibodies and Reagents—TGF-β1 was purchased from R&D Systems (Wiesbaden, Germany). An antibody to Rac1 was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (Heidelberg, Germany); antibody to phospho-p38, p38, phospho-Smad2, and Myc tag (clone 9B11) was from Cell Signaling Technology (Heidelberg, Germany); antibody to Smad2 was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (Berlin, Germany); antibody to phospho-Smad3 was from BIOSOURCE (Nivelles, Belgium); antibody to Smad3 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany); and antibody to β-actin and FLAG (M2) was from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Cytochalasin D was purchased from Sigma, Y-27632 was from Alexis (Grünberg, Germany), and the Rac1 inhibitor, herbimycin A, and diphenylene iodonium chloride (DPI) were from Merck Biosciences (Darmstadt, Germany). All other reagents used were of analytical grade purity. Pharmacological inhibitors were added to cells 1 h before the addition of TGF-β, which was used at a concentration of 5 ng/ml in all experiments. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—Human pancreatic carcinoma PANC-1 and human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells were maintained as described earlier (31Ungefroren H. Groth S. Ruhnke M. Kalthoff H. Fandrich F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2644-2652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PANC-1 cells stably transduced with retroviral vectors were cultured in the presence of 2.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma), and those transfected with Rac1-Q61L in pcDNA3 or pcDNA3 alone were selected with Geneticin (700 μg/ml, active concentration; Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). In some experiments, cells were seeded in 3.5-cm well plates precoated with fibronectin and poly-d-lysine (BD Pharmingen, Heidelberg, Germany) or in 10-cm dishes or 3.5 cm-well plates with an underlayer of agarose to prevent cells from adhesion (33Lehnert L. Lerch M.M. Hirai Y. Kruse M.L. Schmiegel W. Kalthoff H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 911-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA from PANC-1 cells was isolated with peqGOLD RNAPure (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany). The general RT-PCR protocol and the PCR primer sequences for BGN and plasminogen activator-inhibitor (PAI-1) were described in detail earlier (29Chen W.-B. Lenschow W. Tiede K. Fischer J.W. Kalthoff H. Ungefroren H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36118-36128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The mRNA expression was quantified by real-time PCR on an I-Cycler (Bio-Rad, München, Germany) with I-Cycler software (Bio-Rad). SYBR green was used for detection of amplification products. Amplification of β-actin-specific transcripts was achieved as described previously (29Chen W.-B. Lenschow W. Tiede K. Fischer J.W. Kalthoff H. Ungefroren H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36118-36128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). All values for GADD45β, BGN, and PAI-1 mRNA concentrations were normalized to those for β-actin in the same sample to account for small differences in cDNA input. Construction of Vectors and Retroviral Infection—The entire open reading frame of wild type human Rac1 was amplified by RT-PCR with Turbo Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) and primers Rac1-forward 5′-accatgcaggccatcaagtgtgtgg-3′ (start codon underlined) and Rac1-reverse 5′-ttacaacagcaggcattttctcttc-3′ (stop codon underlined) and subcloned in sense orientation into the retroviral vector pBABEpuro. cDNA inserts of Myc-tagged versions of dnRac1 (T17N), and caRac1 (Q61L) (kindly provided by G. M. Bokoch) were released from pRK5 and subcloned into pBABEpuro and pcDNA3, respectively. Positive clones for Rac1 and Rac1-T17N in pBABEpuro (evaluated by PCR, restriction analysis, and sequencing of the plasmid-cDNA junctions) were co-transfected into HEK 293T producer cells along with retroviral packaging vectors as described previously (29Chen W.-B. Lenschow W. Tiede K. Fischer J.W. Kalthoff H. Ungefroren H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36118-36128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Retroviral particles released by 293T cells were used to infect PANC-1 cells. Pools and individual clones of productively infected cells were obtained after antibiotic selection. Transient and Stable Transfections—For transient transfections followed by immunoprecipitation (IP), cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 104 cells/cm2 on day 1 in 10-cm dishes, and on day 2 they were co-transfected serum-free with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions with pFLAG-p38 in combination with empty pcDNA3 vector or Myc-tagged versions of dnRac1 and caRac1 as described previously (31Ungefroren H. Groth S. Ruhnke M. Kalthoff H. Fandrich F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2644-2652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and in the legend to Fig. 4. Following removal of the transfection solution and a recovery period of 24 h in normal growth medium to allow for protein expression from transfected plasmids, cells were starved for 16 h and finally stimulated with TGF-β1 for 1 h. The transfected cells were then lysed in IP buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and processed for anti-FLAG and anti-Myc IP and immunoblotting (see below). Stable transfection of PANC-1 cells with Rac1-Q61L-pcDNA3 was achieved with Lipofectamine Plus. Rac1 Activity Assay—Rac1 activity after TGF-β stimulation was measured using the Rac1 activation kit (Stressgen/Biomol, Hamburg, Germany), which employs the p21-binding domain (PBD) of human p21-activated kinase 1, coupled to GST as a bait. Briefly, 2 × 106 cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes on plastic on day 1, treated on the next day with TGF-β1 for various times, and lysed in lysis buffer provided by the supplier. In some assays, cells were kept in suspension for 24 h prior to lysis. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and 750 μg of protein were incubated on an immobilized glutathione disc and 20 μg of GST-PAK-PBD for 2 h with gentle agitation. Following washing, bound Rac1 was eluted in boiling Laemmli buffer containing 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to SDS-PAGE and anti-Rac1 immunoblotting. For control reactions, 750 μg of each lysate were incubated with either GTPγS or GDP for 15 min at 30 °C, after which the reaction was terminated on ice with 60 mm MgCl2 and processed as above. Immunoblot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—The SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting procedure was performed as described in detail earlier (29Chen W.-B. Lenschow W. Tiede K. Fischer J.W. Kalthoff H. Ungefroren H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36118-36128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Epitope-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from cellular lysates with anti-Myc or anti-FLAG antibodies and Protein A-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) or Protein G Plus-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively, according to the protocols provided by the suppliers, and subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was calculated using the unpaired Student's t test. Data were considered significant at p < 0.05. TGF-β1-induced Activation of p38 MAPK and Up-regulation of BGN but Not Early (Smad-mediated) TGF-β Receptor Signaling Is Dependent on Cell Adhesion—To examine the role of adhesive events to modulate TGF-β-induced BGN up-regulation, the effect of TGF-β on cells stimulated under nonadherent conditions was investigated. Cells seeded on either plastic or agarose-coated wells were stimulated with TGF-β1in suspension, and the effect on BGN mRNA expression was assessed at 24 h. TGF-β evoked a 20–30-fold increase in BGN mRNA in cells grown on plastic but was unable to induce BGN expression in suspended cells (Fig. 1A, left). The inability to up-regulate BGN expression in nonadherent cells following TGF-β1 stimulation cannot be explained by loss of cell viability, because these cells are capable of reattaching and growing when replated on plastic; moreover, up-regulation of BGN expression was partially restored when cells treated with TGF-β1 were returned to an adherent state (data not shown). Anchorage-dependent TGF-β regulation was also observed in other BGN-expressing cells (e.g. osteoblastic MG-63 cells) (Fig. 1A, right). This suggested that adhesion-dependent signal(s) are required for the TGF-β effect on BGN. Given the strict dependence on intermittent activation of p38 MAPK, it was of interest to test whether activation of p38 by TGF-β also was adhesion-dependent. To this end, p38 phosphorylation, being indicative of the p38 activation state, was abolished in suspended cells (Fig. 1B, bottom). We have recently shown that BGN induction and p38 activation is induced via GADD45β, a gene transcriptionally activated by TGF-β via Smads (31Ungefroren H. Groth S. Ruhnke M. Kalthoff H. Fandrich F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2644-2652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To address the question of whether early Smad signaling events require cellular adhesion, TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of receptor-regulated Smads was examined in adherent and suspended cells. Rapid phosphorylation of Smad2 (Fig. 1B, top) and Smad3 (data not shown) was observed within 15 min of TGF-β1 stimulation of cells under both conditions. In agreement with this finding, PAI-1 expression, which is independent of p38 activation (30Ungefroren H. Lenschow W. Chen W.B. Faendrich F. Kalthoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11041-11049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), remained unaffected in suspended cells (Fig. 1C, left). Of note, expression of GADD45β was even enhanced (p < 0.05; Fig. 1C, right). To determine whether integrin binding is involved in the TGF-β effect on BGN, PANC-1 cells were plated on dishes coated with fibronectin (a ligand for β1 integrins) and on poly-d-lysine, a nonintegrin-binding polypeptide. Whereas fibronectin supported TGF-β induction of BGN to a similar extent as plastic, the TGF-β effect was decreased by 79% in cells grown on poly-d-lysine compared with the respective control cells on plastic (Fig. 1D). Collectively, the results show that loss of cell adhesion prevented activation of p38 and induction of BGN expression by TGF-β but did not interfere with the ability of TGF-β1 to bind/activate its receptor and to mediate early Smad signaling; furthermore, the transcriptional activation of well characterized Smad-dependent genes (PAI-1, GADD45β) was not reduced under nonadherent conditions. Since the transition from the adherent to the suspended state and vice versa is associated with rearrangements in the actin cytoskeleton of the cells, which, in turn, may affect some aspects of TGF-β signaling, we investigated the consequences of disrupting the cytoskeleton for TGF-β regulation of BGN. Disassembly of actin stress fibers by cytochalasin D potently and dose-dependently reduced basal and TGF-β1-stimulated BGN expression in PANC-1 cells (Fig. 1E), whereas both PAI-1 and GADD45β expression were only partially inhibited at the 10 μm concentration (data not shown). This indicates that an intact cytoskeleton is important in TGF-β1 signal transduction leading specifically to BGN expression. Dominant Negative Rac1 Blocks TGF-β Induction of BGN Expression by Interfering with Activation of p38 but Not Activation of Smad3 and GADD45β Expression—Because within the Rho-GTPase family, Rac1 is best known for its role in regulating actin assembly and adhesion/integrin-associated signaling, we determined whether Rac1 is involved in mediating the adhesion-dependent regulation of BGN by TGF-β. For this purpose, we initially employed a newly available specific chemical Rac1 inhibitor. When used at the recommended concentration of 50 μm, this agent significantly reduced the TGF-β effect on BGN but not on PAI-1 (Fig. 2A). Next, PANC-1 cells were infected with a retrovirus encoding dominant negative Rac1 (dnRac1) (Rac1-T17N) followed by puromycin selection of individual clones. Two clones expressing Rac1-T17N (Fig. 2B) were chosen for further analysis and compared with cells expressing empty retrovirus. Strikingly, these clones displayed a dramatic decrease in TGF-β induction of BGN, which was most pronounced in clone 21 displaying the highest transgene expression (Fig. 2C, left). To analyze whether Rac1-T17N also inhibited TGF-β-induced activation of p38, we determined the phosphorylation state of p38 in the same clones. As shown in Fig. 2D, dnRac1 suppressed the activation of p38 by TGF-β, and the extent of this inhibition correlated well with that of BGN (compare with Fig. 2C, left). Similar results were obtained in co-transfection experiments of PANC-1 cells with Myc-tagged Rac1-T17N along with FLAG-tagged p38 followed by anti-FLAG IP and anti-p38 immunoblotting (data not shown). We have shown previously that the first step in TGF-β signaling to BGN is activin receptor-like kinase 5-mediated activation of Smad2/3 and Smad-dependent transcriptional induction of GADD45β expression (31Ungefroren H. Groth S. Ruhnke M. Kalthoff H. Fandrich F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2644-2652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which subsequently activates the p38 MAPK pathway. Since TGF-β-induced p38 activation was suppressed as a consequence of Rac1 inhibition, we tested the possibility that dnRac1 blocked some step upstream of p38 activation. Specifically, we asked whether activated Rac1 is required for Smad2/3 activation and GADD45β induction. Since the GADD45β gene has been shown to be induced by TGF-β primarily by Smad3 rather than Smad2 (34Major M.B. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 5278-5287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we determined GADD45β expression and Smad3 activation in TGF-β-stimulated PANC-1 cells stably expressing dnRac1. Notably, TGF-β-induced expression of GADD45β was not reduced and in one clone was even enhanced (Fig. 2C, right panel). The same was true for Smad3 phosphorylation (Fig. 2E). We thus conclude that Rac1-T17N blocked induction of BGN expression by TGF-β at the level of p38 activation without interfering with activation of Smad3, or transcriptional induction of MyD118. Ectopic Expression of Wild Type Rac1 Enhances the TGF-β Effect on BGN Expression—Next, we addressed the question of whether ectopic (over)expression of Rac1 can further amplify TGF-β induction of BGN. Stable transduction of PANC-1 cells with a retrovirus encoding Rac1 increased Rac1 protein levels in these cells (Fig. 3A), and this correlated, in a “dose-dependent” fashion, with enhanced expression of BGN relative to wild type and empty vector expressing control cells following TGF-β treatment (Fig. 3B, upper panel). Ectopically expressed Rac1 did not alter TGF-β-induced PAI-1 mRNA levels (Fig. 3B, lower panel), again indicating the specificity of the Rac1 effect for BGN. These data show that the endogenous Rac1 levels in these cells are rate-limiting for the TGF-β effect on BGN.

https://openalex.org/W1989741873,"Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1), a novel Gβγ-interacting protein, selectively inhibits the activation of a subclass of Gβγ effectors such as phospholipase C β2 (PLCβ2) and adenylyl cyclase II by direct binding to Gβγ (Chen, S., Dell, E. J., Lin, F., Sai, J., and Hamm, H. E. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 17861-17868). Here we have mapped the RACK1 binding sites on Gβγ. We found that RACK1 interacts with several different Gβγ isoforms, including Gβ1γ1, Gβ1γ2, and Gβ5γ2, with similar affinities, suggesting that the conserved residues between Gβ1 and Gβ5 may be involved in their binding to RACK1. We have confirmed this hypothesis and shown that several synthetic peptides corresponding to the conserved residues can inhibit the RACK1/Gβγ interaction as monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy. Interestingly, these peptides are located at one side of Gβ1 and have little overlap with the Gα subunit binding interface. Additional experiments indicate that the Gβγ contact residues for RACK1, in particular the positively charged amino acids within residues 44-54 of Gβ1, are also involved in the interaction with PLCβ2 and play a critical role in Gβγ-mediated PLCβ2 activation. These data thus demonstrate that RACK1 can regulate the activity of a Gβγ effector by competing for its binding to the signal transfer region of Gβγ. Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1), a novel Gβγ-interacting protein, selectively inhibits the activation of a subclass of Gβγ effectors such as phospholipase C β2 (PLCβ2) and adenylyl cyclase II by direct binding to Gβγ (Chen, S., Dell, E. J., Lin, F., Sai, J., and Hamm, H. E. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 17861-17868). Here we have mapped the RACK1 binding sites on Gβγ. We found that RACK1 interacts with several different Gβγ isoforms, including Gβ1γ1, Gβ1γ2, and Gβ5γ2, with similar affinities, suggesting that the conserved residues between Gβ1 and Gβ5 may be involved in their binding to RACK1.

These data thus demonstrate that RACK1 can regulate the activity of a Gβγ effector by competing for its binding to the signal transfer region of Gβγ. Gβγ subunits liberated from heterotrimeric G proteins following the activation of G protein-coupled receptors play critical roles in many cellular processes (1Hamm H.E. J. Biol.

They regulate a variety of effector molecules ranging from enzymes such as phospholipase C β (PLCβ) 3The abbreviations used are: PLCβ, phospholipase C β; EC50, concentration of stimulators causing 50% of the maximal response; GST, glutathione S-transferase; M8, 2-(4′-maleimidylanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid, sodium salt; MBP, maltose-binding protein; RACK1, receptor for activated C kinase 1; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; ACII, adenylyl cyclase II.3The abbreviations used are: PLCβ, phospholipase C β; EC50, concentration of stimulators causing 50% of the maximal response; GST, glutathione S-transferase; M8, 2-(4′-maleimidylanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid, sodium salt; MBP, maltose-binding protein; RACK1, receptor for activated C kinase 1; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; ACII, adenylyl cyclase II. and adenylyl cyclases to ion channels. The Gβ subunit has six isoforms, Gβ1, Gβ2, Gβ3, Gβ4, and two Gβ5 splice variants, long and short (2Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Although Gβ isoforms 1-4 share more than 85% amino acid identity, Gβ5 is only about 50% identical to the other isoforms. Gβ subunits are WD40 repeat proteins whose structures are characterized by the presence of an N-terminal α helix and a C-terminal toroidal structure made up of seven-bladed β propellers with four β strands in each blade (2Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). This unique toroidal β propeller structure defines multiple surfaces including a top, bottom, and outer surface on Gβ for interactions with receptors, Gα subunits, and effectors. Mutagenesis analyses and co-crystal studies of Gβγ with interacting proteins such as phosducin and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) have identified multiple protein interaction sites on Gβγ (1Hamm H.E.

Science. 2003; 300: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). However, residues critical for activation of all known Gβγ effectors appear to cluster on a surface of Gβγ that is covered by the Gα subunit in the heterotrimer (5Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.S. Iyengar R. Miller R.J. Jan L.Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Hamm H.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). This explains why dissociation of Gβγ from Gα is required for the activation of all known effectors. In addition to the Gα contact region, other sites on Gβ also participate in effector binding and activation. These include the N-terminal coiled-coil domain and the outer surface of the β propeller structure, which may define the signaling specificity of Gβγ for different effectors (6Yoshikawa D.M.

In addition to being effectors, a number of interacting proteins can also regulate the activity of Gβγ. These include phosducin, phosducin-like proteins, and GRKs (9Schulz R. Pharmacol. Res. 2001; 43: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 10Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Touhara K. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3637-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Binding of these proteins to Gβγ results in inhibition of all known effectors as their binding sites on Gβγ are shared by the Gα subunits. Recently, we have identified a novel Gβγ-interacting protein, RACK1, that can also modulate Gβγ functions (11Dell E.J. Connor J. Chen S. Stebbins E.G. Skiba N.P. Mochly-Rosen D. Hamm H.E. J. Biol.

Cell Cardiol. 2004; 37: 399-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, unlike other Gβγ regulatory proteins, RACK1 only affects the activation of a subset of Gβγ effectors, such as PLCβ2 and ACII, but has no effect on other Gβγ functions (12Chen S. Dell E.J. Lin F. Sai J. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17861-17868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Given the fact that the Gα binding interface contains molecular determinants for all known Gβγ effectors, these findings suggest that RACK1 may bind to a domain of Gβγ outside the Gα contact region. Here we have used a combination of peptide and fluorescence spectroscopic approaches to define the RACK1 binding sites on Gβγ. Moreover, we have evaluated the contribution of the RACK1 contact residues to Gβγ-mediated PLCβ2 activation. The results of this study provide evidence that RACK1 binds to a unique region of Gβγ critical for its signal transfer function. Materials—Peptides were purchased from GL Biochem Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and purified to >95% purity by high performance liquid chromatography. [3H]Phosphatidyinositol 4,5-biphosphate (5.5 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Mouse anti-RACK1 antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories, and rabbit anti-Gβ5 from Upstate Group LLC. Rabbit anti-Gβ1 was generated by our laboratory using purified Gβ1γ1 as the immunogen. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was from Qiagen, amylose resin from New England Biolabs, and glutathione-Sepharose from Amersham Biosciences.

GST Pulldown Assays in Vitro—Binding of Gβγ and mutants to glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion RACK1, the C terminus of GRK2 (GRK2-ct), and phosducin in vitro was conducted as described previously (11Dell E.J.

Fluorescent Labeling of Gβ1γ1 and Spectrofluorometric Assays— Gβ1γ1 was labeled with 2-(4′-maleimidylanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid, sodium salt (M8) as described previously (16Phillips W.J.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7931-7941Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interaction of M8-labeled Gβ1γ1 with MBP-RACK1 or PLCβ2 was monitored using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian Australia Pty. Ltd.) with excitation at 322 nm and emission at 420 nm. To determine effects of the Gβ1-derived peptides on the RACK1/Gβγ and PLCβ2/Gβγ interactions, peptides were added to the cuvette containing M8-labeled Gβ1γ1 before the addition of MBP-RACK1 or PLCβ2. All fluorescence measurements were performed at 25 °C in HEPES buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Peptides were prepared as 10-20-mm stocks in 10 mm HEPES buffer with pH adjusted to near 8.0. Background fluorescence from peptides and MBP-RACK1 in the absence of M8-labeled Gβ1γ1 was corrected in all measurements. Measurement of PLCβ2 Activity—The Gβγ and peptide-mediated PLCβ2 activation was determined essentially as described before (12Chen S. Dell E.J. Lin F. Sai J. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17861-17868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Construction, Expression, and Purification of Gβγ Mutants—To construct Gβ1 mutants for expression in Sf9 cells, a GATEWAY cloning system (Invitrogen) was used. Briefly, bovine Gβ1 was first cloned into pENTR/SD/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pENTR/SD/D-TOPO Gβ1 using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). After the mutant Gβ1 was transferred into a donor plasmid pDEST8 by homologous recombination reactions, recombinant baculoviruses encoding the Gβ1 mutants were generated using a Bac-To-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). Expression and purification of mutant Gβ1γ2 from Sf9 cells were performed as described above. Data Analysis—Unless indicated, data are representative of at least three independent experiments. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Student's t-tests were used to determine significant differences (two-tail p <0.05). Interaction of RACK1 with Different Gβγ Isoforms—To identify RACK1 binding sites on Gβγ, we first compared the binding of GST-RACK1 to different Gβγ isoforms, including Gβ1γ1,Gβ1γ2, and Gβ5γ2. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, GST-RACK1 interacts with purified Gβ1γ1, Gβ1γ2, and Gβ5γ2 with similar affinities (∼0.3-0.5 μm). Gγ1 and Gγ2 share only 37% amino acid identity and are post-translationally modified with different lipids, with Gγ1 being farnesylated and Gγ2 geranylgeranylated. The similar binding of RACK1 to Gβ1γ1 and Gβ1γ2 suggests that Gγ is not a major determinant for the RACK1/Gβγ interaction. Consistent with this hypothesis, after forming a complex with its native partner, RGS9L, Gβ5 can bind to GST-RACK1 as well as Gβ5γ2 (data not shown). RACK1 Binds to a Unique Region of Gβ—Gβ1 and Gβ5 share only ∼50% amino acid identity. However, the conserved residues between these two Gβ isoforms are clustered in the seven blades of Gβ that are known to be involved in interactions with diverse proteins (Fig. 2A). Given the similar binding of Gβ1γ2 and Gβ5γ2 to RACK1, we hypothesized that the RACK1 contact residues on Gβ are localized in these conserved regions. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized a series of peptides corresponding to surface-exposed residues of the conserved regions and determined their effects on the RACK1/Gβγ interaction (Fig. 2B). For the purpose of synthesis, purification, and solubilization, we have kept the length of peptides at 9-20 amino acids. Except for two peptides, p86-105 and p265-275, that could not be dissolved in solution probably due to the high content of hydrophobic amino acids in the sequences, all other peptides were soluble. To be able to identify peptides that possess low binding affinities to RACK1, we have developed a sensitive and quantitative fluorescence-based assay to monitor the RACK1/Gβγ interaction in solution. In this assay, purified Gβγ was labeled with an environmentally sensitive thiol-reactive fluorescent probe, M8. Binding of purified MBP-RACK1 to M8-labeled Gβγ was monitored by changes in the intensity and emission wavelength of fluorescence. This method allows us to monitor the interaction of RACK1 with Gβγ in real time in solution and evaluate the ability of peptides to perturb the interaction. Because Gβ1γ1 interacts with RACK1 with similar affinity as other Gβγ isoforms, it was used in this study as it can be easily purified from bovine retina. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the addition of MBP-RACK1 to M8-labeled Gβ1γ1 dose-dependently increased the intensity of fluorescence but did not cause a significant shift of the peak emission wavelength (data not shown). MBP alone had little effect. The increase in fluorescence is probably caused by the enhanced hydrophobicity around the fluorescent probe on Gβγ upon RACK1 binding. The RACK1-mediated enhancement of the M8-Gβγ fluorescence was immediate, suggesting the association of these proteins was rapid, i.e. within the mixing time. The binding affinity for the RACK1/Gβ1γ1 interaction determined from this assay (EC50 ∼0.5 μm) is similar to that from GST-RACK1 pulldown assays (EC50 ∼0.3 μm), suggesting that the modification of Gβ1γ1 with M8 does not perturb its binding to RACK1. To screen for peptides that inhibit the RACK1/Gβ1γ1 interaction, we preincubated M8-Gβ1γ1 with or without peptides and then compared the fluorescence before and after the addition of MBP-RACK1. Fig. 4A shows the representative data for two synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 44-54 and 86-98 of Gβ1. Other peptides tested include p113-122 and p136-147 from blade 2 of Gβ1, p159-167 and p177-189 from blade 3, p201-209 and p219-231 from blade 4, p243-251 from blade 5, p287-296 from blade 6, p309-316 and p328-337 from blade 7. Results for some of the tested peptides are summarized in Fig. 4B. Peptides p86-105 and p265-275 were excluded from this study as they could not be dissolved in solution unless using Me2SO, which itself interferes with the fluorescence of M8-Gβ1γ1. Except for peptides p44-54, p309-316 and p328-337, p86-98 and p287-295, which showed significant inhibitory effects on the RACK1/Gβγ interaction, all other peptides had no effect. The inhibitory effects of the individual peptides on the RACK1/Gβγ interaction ranged from 10 to 70%. When used in combination, peptides p44-54 and 328-337 caused almost complete inhibition of the RACK1/Gβγ interaction, suggesting that they have additive inhibitory effects (data not shown). In addition, these peptides can also cause the dissociation of Gβγ from RACK1 when added after the formation of the Gβγ-RACK1 complex, suggesting that the peptides may perturb the RACK1/Gβγ interaction through competitive binding for RACK1 with Gβγ. Interestingly, when mapped to the crystal structure of Gβ1γ1, the corresponding residues of these inhibitory peptides are clustered at one side of Gβ1 involving blades 1, 6, and 7 (Fig. 4B, inset). Except for residues Lys-89, Ser-98, and Trp-332, which are contained in peptides p86-98 and p328-337, other Gα subunit-interacting residues do not fall within the RACK1 binding sites in Gβγ (Fig. 5A). This is in contrast to other Gβγ-interacting proteins such as GRK2 and phosducin whose binding sites on Gβγ largely overlap with the Gα binding interface (Fig. 5, B and C) (3Gaudet R. Bohm A.

To determine whether this is due to a competitive binding of RACK1 for the PLCβ2 contact residues on Gβγ, we further evaluated effects of the peptides on the PLCβ2/Gβγ interaction. Similar to RACK1, the addition of PLCβ2 caused a dose-dependent increase in the fluorescence of M8-Gβ1γ1 with an EC50 ∼1 μm (data not shown). As with the interaction of RACK1 with Gβγ, peptides p44-54, p86-98, p287-296, p309-316, and p328-337 also inhibited the PLCβ2/Gβγ interaction, with p44-54 being most effective (Fig. 6). In addition to these peptides, peptide p177-189 also inhibited the PLCβ2/Gβγ interaction, although it had no effect on the binding of RACK1 to Gβγ. This suggests that the RACK1 and PLCβ2 binding sites on Gβγ are overlapping but not identical. The Gβγ Contact Region for RACK1 Is Critical for PLCβ2 Activation— Based on the ability of Gβ-derived peptides to either perturb Gβγ-mediated PLCβ2 activation or activate PLCβ2 in the absence of Gβγ, Buck and Iyengar (18Buck E. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36014-36019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) have proposed that contact regions of Gβγ for an effector can be involved in either general binding or signal transfer functions. To determine the role of RACK1 binding sites in Gβγ-mediated PLCβ2 activation, we then evaluated effects of the Gβγ-derived peptides on the activity of PLCβ2. As shown in Fig. 7A, a majority of peptides, including those that can perturb the Gβγ/RACK1 and Gβγ/PLCβ2 interactions, did not affect either the basal or the Gβγ-mediated PLCβ2 activation. However, peptide p177-189, which inhibited the interaction of Gβγ with PLCβ2 but not RACK1, abolished Gβγ-stimulated PLCβ2 activity even better than GRK2-ct, suggesting that the corresponding residues of this peptide are involved in binding and signaling of Gβγ to PLCβ2. Interestingly, peptides p44-54 and p86-105 stimulated PLCβ2 activity even in the absence of Gβγ (Fig. 7B). These results are similar to previous reports using peptides from the same region (18Buck E. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36014-36019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 19Buck E. Li J. Chen Y. Weng G. Scarlata S. Iyengar R. Science. 1999; 283: 1332-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting that the peptides are derived from regions of Gβγ involved in signal transduction. Peptide p86-105 seems to have a more potent ability to stimulate PLCβ2 than p44-54 (Fig. 7B). However, the potency and efficacy of p86-105 could not be accurately obtained in these studies because at higher concentration it precipitated out of solution. The Charged Amino Acids within Residues 44-54 Are Critical for Efficient Gβγ/RACK1 Interaction and PLCβ2 Activation—Because p44-54 is the most effective peptide in perturbing the interaction of Gβγ with either RACK1 or PLCβ2 and it can activate PLCβ2, we further determined the critical residues mediating its activity. We initially synthesized a series of p44-54 mutant peptides with 2-3 alanine substitutions in each mutant and then determined their effects on the RACK1/Gβγ and PLCβ2/Gβγ interactions (Fig. 8A). As shown in Fig. 8B, except for the mutant A53-54, which showed a reduced inhibitory effect (50 versus 70% for the original peptide) on the interaction of Gβγ with RACK1, but not PLCβ2, all other mutant peptides have decreased abilities to inhibit both Gβγ/RACK1 and Gβγ/PLCβ2 interactions. Their inhibitory effects on the Gβγ/RACK1 and Gβγ/PLCβ2 interactions were reduced from 70 and 60% for the original peptide to 10-20% and 20-30%, respectively. The fact that substitution of residues 53-54 differentially affected the ability of p44-54 to inhibit the Gβγ/RACK1 and Gβγ/PLCβ2 interactions further supports the notion that RACK1 and PLCβ2 share overlapping but not identical contact residues on Gβγ. Next, we examined the ability of the mutant peptides to activate PLCβ2. As compared with the original peptide p44-54, the mutant peptides A44-46, A47-49 and A50-52 showed decreases in both the potency and efficacy in PLCβ2 activation (Fig. 8C). The EC50 (potency) is 585, 371, or 185 μm for A44-46, A47-49, or A50-52 versus 21 μm for the original peptide p44-54, and the efficacy (Emax) is 84, 23, or 64% of the maximal response of the original peptide for A44-46, A47-49, or A50-52. Interestingly, mutant peptide A53-54 displayed a decrease in potency (172 versus 21 μm for the original peptide) but enhanced efficacy (120% of the maximal response of the original peptide) in activating PLCβ2. This suggests that the last 2 residues, Gly-53 and His-54, play differential roles in mediating efficient interaction (potency) and maximal signal transduction (efficacy) between Gβγ and PLCβ2. Notably, peptide p44-54 contains a high content of positively charged residues (5 of 11 amino acids) (Fig. 8A). Because all the mutant peptides have 1 or 2 charged residues substituted with alanine, we questioned whether the charged residues play a role in the interactions of Gβγ with RACK1 and PLCβ2 and in PLCβ2 activation. We synthesized a peptide (5A) with all the 5 charged residues in p44-54 replaced with alanines. Unfortunately, this peptide could not be dissolved in solution, probably because of the increased hydrophobicity following the alanine substitution. Although it can be dissolved in solvent such as Me2SO, this peptide could not be used in the spectrofluorometric assays because the solvent itself interfered with the fluorescence of M8-Gβ1γ1. However, we can determine the effect of this peptide on PLCβ2 activity because a small amount of Me2SO did not affect PLCβ2 activity. As shown in Fig. 8B, peptide 5A lost the ability to activate PLCβ2, suggesting that the charged residues are critical for the signaling function of p44-54. To further characterize the overall contribution of the charged amino acids within residues 44-54 to the RACK1/Gβγ interaction and PLCβ2 activation in the context of full-length Gβ, we constructed Gβ1 mutants with residues Arg-48 and Arg-49, His-54, or all five charged residues Arg-46, Arg-48, Arg-49, Arg-52, and His-54 substituted with alanines. After these mutants were expressed together with His6-Gγ2 in Sf9 cells and purified to near homogeneity, their abilities to interact with RACK1 and to activate PLCβ2 were evaluated. As shown in Fig. 9, A and B, mutations of Arg-48 and Arg-49 or His-54 (data not shown) did not affect the binding of Gβγ to RACK1. The mutant Gβ1(5A)γ2 showed a slight decrease in affinity but not binding capacity (Bmax) for RACK1, suggesting that the 5 charged residues Arg-46, Arg-48, Arg-49, Arg-52, and His-54 contribute to the tight association of Gβγ with RACK1. To ensure that the reduced binding affinity of the mutant Gβ1(5A)γ2 to RACK1 is not secondary to global structural changes, we have also evaluated the binding of this mutant to the C terminus of GRK2 and phosducin. Based on the crystal structures of the Gβ1γ2-GRK2 and Gβ1γ1-phosducin complexes, none of the 5 residues is involved in interaction with GRK2 but Arg-42 and Arg-46 are engaged in direct contacts with the C-terminal domain of phosducin (3Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 4Lodowski D.T. Pitcher J.A. Capel W.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Tesmer J.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). As expected, the mutant Gβ1(5A)γ2 interacts with GRK2-ct as well as the wild-type Gβ1γ2 (Fig. 9C). By contrast, Gβ1(5A)γ2 showed a reduced binding to phosducin (Fig. 9D). These findings suggest that mutations of the 5 charged residues did not result in misfolding of Gβ1γ2. When evaluated in PLCβ2 activity assays, all of the Gβ1γ2 mutants, Gβ1(R48R49A)γ2, Gβ1(H54A)γ2, and Gβ1(5A)γ2, showed decreases in the maximal stimulation of PLCβ2 activity, with Emax being 50-80% of the wild-type (Fig. 10). However, they displayed different potencies in stimulating PLCβ2. Whereas the potency of Gβ1(5A)γ2 was decreased ∼2-fold (EC50 = 85 versus 40 nm for the wild-type), mutants Gβ1(R48R49A)γ2 and Gβ1(H54A)γ2 displayed ∼4-5-fold increases in potencies (EC50 = 7.7 or 8.5 nm for Gβ1(R48R49A)γ2 or Gβ1(H54A)γ2). These findings suggest that although they are equally important for maximal stimulation of PLCβ2, the 5 charged residues may play different and even antagonistic roles in the tight association of Gβγ with PLCβ2. These results are consistent with previous reports that a residue in Gβγ may play a different role in the association and signal transduction of Gβγ to effectors (18Buck E. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36014-36019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 20Buck E. Schatz P. Scarlata S. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49707-49715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In this study, we have identified the key contact region of Gβγ for RACK1. Moreover, we have shown that the Gβγ binding sites for RACK1 are shared by PLCβ2 and contribute to Gβγ-mediated PLCβ2 activation. These findings thus provide direct evidence for the ability of RACK1 to compete for a common effecter binding site on Gβγ and inhibit Gβγ-mediated effector activation. Our identification of the RACK1 binding sites on Gβγ was facilitated by the use of a combination of peptide and spectrofluorometric approaches. The use of peptides to compete for the binding of Gβγ to RACK1 allows us to screen a large surface area of Gβγ in a short period. Moreover, it avoids potential structural changes of Gβγ when mutagenesis experiments are performed on Gβγ to identify the RACK1 contact residues. The caveat of this approach, however, is that the binding affinity of the peptides to RACK1 may be significantly lower than when they reside in the native proteins. To circumvent this problem, we have developed a sensitive fluorescence competition approach. This allowed identification of peptides such as p86-98 and p309-316, which have small inhibitory effects, as little as 10%, on the RACK1/Gβγ interaction that may be neglected by using non-equilibrium approaches such as GST pulldown assays. It is noteworthy that of 13 peptides we studied, only 5 (p44-54, p86-98, p287-298, p309-316, and p328-337) significantly inhibit the Gβγ/RACK1 interaction, suggesting that the corresponding residues of these peptides are specifically involved in the binding of Gβγ to RACK1. However, it should be pointed out that we cannot completely exclude the potential contribution of other regions of Gβγ in binding RACK1, because in this study we only evaluated the conserved domain between Gβ1 and Gβ5 and it is possible that other regions also play a role in the Gβγ/RACK1 interaction. In addition, peptides with small effects on the Gβγ/RACK1 interaction that are beyond the sensitivity of our assays will not be detected. However, based on the following considerations, we believe that the region identified on Gβγ in this study is the key contact between Gβγ and RACK1. First, although the corresponding residues of the peptides p44-54, p86-98, p287-298, p309-316, and p328-337 are not contiguous in amino acid sequences, they are close in space and, particularly, clustered on a same surface of Gβγ and confined to three blades, blades 1, 6, and 7. This is consistent with the fact that, like Gβ, RACK1 is a member of WD40 repeat proteins that may form a rigid circular β propeller structure and thus its interaction with Gβγ may be mediated through limited contacts (13Chen S. Spiegelberg B.D. Lin F. Dell E.J. Hamm H.E. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2004; 37: 399-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Second, peptide p44-54 alone can inhibit up to 70% of the Gβγ/RACK1 interaction, and a combination of this peptide with p328-337 from the same blade 7 where p44-54 resides almost completely abolished the interaction, suggesting that residues 44-55 and 328-337 are the major molecular determinants of Gβγ for binding RACK1. In further support of this notion, mutations of 5 charged residues within amino acids 44-54 of Gβ1 resulted in a weaker interaction between Gβ1γ2 and RACK1. Based on the crystal structure of the heterotrimer Gαtβ1γ1 and Gαiβ1γ2, there are 16 residues from Gβ1 engaged in interaction with the Gα subunit (21Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P.

Science. 1995; 270: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The peptides tested in this study contain 13 of these residues. However, only 3 Gα-interacting residues, Lys-89, Ser-98, and Trp-332, are found to be within the RACK1 contact region of Gβγ (Fig. 5A). Because we could not clearly define the boundary of the RACK1 binding sites on Gβγ by using the peptide approach, it remains to be determined whether these residues are involved in direct interactions with RACK1. Nevertheless, these residues do not seem to be essential for the binding of Gβγ to RACK1, as peptide p86-98 that contains residues Lys-89 and Ser-98 inhibited only 10% of the RACK1/Gβγ interaction. Moreover, a Gβ1γ2 W332A mutant binds to GST-RACK1 as well as the wild-type Gβ1γ2 (data not shown). Furthermore, the Gβ1γ1 subunit can still interact with RACK1 after it forms a heterotrimeric complex with the Gαt subunit (11Dell E.J. Connor J. Chen S. Stebbins E.G. Skiba N.P. Mochly-Rosen D. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49888-49895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the Gα-interacting residues do not play an essential role in the binding of RACK1 to Gβγ. This is in contrast to GRK2 and phosducin, whose binding sites on Gβγ significantly overlap with the Gα binding interface (3Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 4Lodowski D.T. Pitcher J.A. Capel W.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Tesmer J.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Because the Gα contact residues on Gβγ are known to be involved in activation of all known Gβγ effectors, the lack of significant overlapping of the Gβγ binding sites for RACK1 with the Gα binding interface may have important implications for the physiological role of RACK1. Thus, unlike GRK2 and phosducin, whose binding to Gβγ resulted in inhibition of all known Gβγ effectors, RACK1 may regulate only a subset of Gβγ effectors whose binding sites overlap with those of RACK1. Indeed, we have found previously that overexpression of RACK1 affects Gβγ-mediated PLCβ2 and ACII activation, but not the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases nor chemotaxis of human embryonic kidney 293 cells via Gβγ, although in the last two cases the direct effectors of Gβγ are unknown (12Chen S. Dell E.J. Lin F. Sai J. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17861-17868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Residues within the RACK1 contact region of Gβγ have been implicated in the activation of a variety of effectors, including PLCβ2, ACII, and the G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels. For example, mutations of 2 (Arg-49 and Thr-50) or 4 residues (Arg-46, Arg-48, Arg-49, and Thr-50) in the outer strand of blade 7 (residues 42-52) abolished Gβγ-mediated PLCβ2 activation (8Panchenko M.P. Saxena K. Li Y. Charnecki S. Sternweis P.M. Smith T.F. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28298-28304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Substitution of Lys-89 with alanine inhibits the activation of PLCβ2, ACII, and the GIRK channels, and an S98A mutant of Gβ1γ2 displayed a reduction in the activation of ACII (5Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.S. Iyengar R. Miller R.J. Jan L.Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Hamm H.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). A C-terminal chimera mutant of Gβ1 with 4 residues, Val-327, Ala-328, Phe-335, and Asn-340 replaced with the corresponding residues of Dictyostelium Gβ was unable to stimulate PLCβ2 (24Zhang S.

Finally, mutagenesis studies of the C-terminal domains of the Gβ that either forms a hydrophobic binding pocket for the Gγ subunit prenyl group or undergoes conformational change upon the binding of Gβγ to phosducin indicate that residues in this region are very important in the activation of both PLCβ2 and ACII (25Myung C.S. Garrison J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9311-9316Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that amino acids in the RACK1 binding sites of Gβγ are critically involved in effector activation. In support of this notion, we have provided direct evidence that RACK1 and PLCβ2 share overlapping contact residues on Gβγ, because peptides that inhibited the RACK1/Gβγ interaction have the same effects on the PLCβ2/Gβγ interaction. Although the binding of PLCβ2 to Gβγ involves multiple domains of Gβγ as noted here and by other reports (5Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.S.

This is demonstrated by the fact that peptides p44-54 and p86-105 can directly activate PLCβ2. Moreover, mutations of the charged residues in the domain between amino acids 44 and 54 affect the potency and efficacy of PLCβ2 activation. These findings thus unambiguously demonstrate that by competitive binding to the region of Gβγ critical for effector interaction and activation, RACK1 can regulate the function of Gβγ."
https://openalex.org/W2086970243,"Increased levels of extracellular l-glutamate have been suggested to play a role in retinal damage in a number of blinding diseases such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. Although glutamate can cause retinal damage in part by hyperstimulating its receptors (""excitotoxicity""), the downstream events that lead to retinal damage are poorly understood. In this study, we injected kainic acid (KA), a glutamate receptor agonist that specifically hyperstimulates non-NMDA-type receptors, into the vitreous humor of CD-1 mice and have investigated the role of plasminogen activators (PAs) [tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)] in excitotoxicity-induced retinal damage. Injection of KA into the vitreous humor led to an up-regulation in tPA and an induction in uPA activity in the retina and this was associated with activation of zymogen plasminogen to active plasmin. Immunocytochemical analysis indicated that retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), constitutively express tPA and release it into the extracellular space upon KA injection. Immunocytochemical analysis also indicated an increase in uPA in the nerve fiber layer after KA injection that was absent in the control retinas. These events were associated with apoptotic death of cells initially in the ganglion cell layer and subsequently in the inner and outer nuclear layer, associated with loss of RGCs and amacrine cells. These phenomena were inhibited when recombinant plasminogen activator inhibitor (rPAI-1) or tPA-STOP were injected into the vitreous humor with KA, whereas a plasmin inhibitor, alpha-2-antiplasmin, failed to attenuate KA-induced retinal damage. Taken together, these results suggest that inhibition of plasminogen activators might attenuate retinal damage in blinding retinal diseases in which hyperstimulation of glutamate receptors is implicated as a causative factor to retinal damage."
https://openalex.org/W1969369661,"To examine the role of histamine H1 and H2 receptors in the regulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced liver injury, a combination of D-galactosamine and LPS (GalN/LPS) was administered to histamine H1 receptor knockout (H1-R KO) and H2 receptor knockout (H2-R KO) mice. The numbers of necrotic and apoptotic hepatocytes in the liver, as well as the levels of serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), were increased significantly by GalN/LPS treatment compared to the appropriate controls. Pretreatment with histamine ameliorated the GalN/LPS-induced necrotic and apoptotic changes in the hepatocytes and inhibited the elevation of serum AST and ALT levels. Histamine attenuated the GalN/LPS-induced increases in the levels of TNF-alpha, but augmented those of IL-10 both in the liver and serum. Histamine inhibited the GalN/LPS-induced caspase-3 activity in the liver. Furthermore, these effects of histamine were completely or partially attenuated in H2-R KO mice, but not in H1-R KO mice. Peritoneal macrophages from H2-R KO mice exhibited blunted changes in the effects of histamine on LPS-induced TNF-alpha and IL-10 production in vitro compared to the wild-type (WT) controls. In summary, the present findings suggest that the histamine H2-R-TNF-alpha and -IL-10 pathways play protective roles in endotoxin-induced hepatic injury."

The activity of MS in cells cultured in normal medium is enhanced by supplementation with vitamin B12, an observation that was first reported over 30 years ago (12Mangum J.H. Murray B.K. North J.A. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3496-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This regulation is exerted at the translational level and involves a B12 responsive element located at the 3′-end of the MS 5′-UTR (13Oltean S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20778-20784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). B12 supplementation shifts the equilibrium of MS mRNA from the translationally inactive ribonucleoprotein pool to the active polysomal pool and thereby increases the level of MS. The MS 5′-UTR is 394 bases in length and is predicted to be highly structured, which raises questions about how it can be efficiently translated. Translation initiation of most eukaryotic genes commences with recruitment of the initiation complex to the 5′-m7G cap structure of the mRNA. The initiation complex then scans the leader region until the initiator AUG codon is located. Leader-burdened mRNAs in eukaryotes can employ alternative mechanisms for translation initiation, i.e. ribosomal shunting or an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element (14Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Whereas there is little information on the mechanism of ribosome shunting, IRES elements are capable of recruiting ribosomal subunits in the vicinity of the initiation codon, thus bypassing the canonical cap-recognition and scanning route. Cellular IRES activities can be modulated in response to amino acid availability, hypothermia, or during apoptosis and development and afford a route for translation initiation under conditions where global cap-dependent initiation is inhibited (14Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 15Fernandez J. Yaman I. Mishra R. Merrick W.C. Snider M.D. Lamers W.H. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated whether the human MS mRNA is translated through an internal initiation mechanism. We demonstrate that the MS mRNA harbors an IRES element in its leader region, and its boundaries overlap with those of the previously described B12 response element. The IRES element is located immediately upstream of the initiator AUG, and its activity is modulated by vitamin B12. B12 does not appear to bind directly to the MS 5′-UTR and supports a model in which the cofactor regulates the IRES element via an auxiliary protein. Materials—Eagle's MEM (minimum essential medium), OHCbl, AdoCbl, MeCbl, and CNCbl were purchased from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum was from HyClone. Cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP (5000 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. HeLa S100 cell extracts were purchased from Paragon. Cell Culture Conditions—Cells were grown in Eagle's MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. B12 derived from fetal bovine serum is present at a concentration of ∼125 pm in this medium. For B12 induction studies, the cells were grown to 60–80% confluency, and fresh medium supplemented with 5 mg liter-1 OHCbl (3.6 μm final concentration) was added. For reporter studies (luciferase and CAT), cells were grown in 6-well 35-mm plates, harvested, and lysed according to the manufacturer's protocols (Promega). Reporter Constructs—Plasmids pSVCAT/ICS/LUC, pSVCAT/BIP/LUC, and pSVhpCAT/BIP/LUC were kindly provided by Dr. Maria Hatzoglou (Case Western Reserve University) and were initially developed in Dr. Peter Sarnow's laboratory (Stanford University). The pSVCAT/ICS/LUC vector contains 400 nucleotides of antisense antennapedia cDNA of Drosophila melanogaster (17Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) in the intercistronic (ICS) region and was used as a negative control for IRES-mediated translation. The plasmid pSVCAT/BIP/LUC contains the IRES of the immunoglobulin-binding protein (17Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) and was used as a positive control. The plasmid pSVhpCAT/BIP/LUC contains a stable hairpin inserted in front of the first cistron. The MS 5′-UTR (394 bases) was PCR-amplified and cloned into the SalI/NcoI sites of the pSVCAT/ICS/LUC plasmid by replacing the ICS sequence to give pSVCAT/MS1–394/LUC. Using a similar procedure, the vector pSVhpCAT/MS1–394/LUC was obtained. Deletion constructs containing the last 340, 270, 220, 140, and 71 bases, of the MS 5′-UTR were generated by PCR and subcloned into the SalI/NcoI sites of the bicistronic vector (with or without the hairpin) as described above for the full-length construct. The deletion constructs containing the last 67, 64, 61, 55, 52, 47, 42, 35, and 26 bases, respectively, of the MS 5′-UTR were generated by PCR and subcloned into the SalI/BstEII sites. Plasmid MS-pGL3-basic was constructed by cloning the MS 5′-UTR into the HindIII/NcoI sites of the pGL3-basic promoter-less vector (Promega). Mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The primers employed in this study are described in supplemental Table S1. Transient Transfection and Reporter Assays—Transfections were performed using the Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) for 293 cells or GeneJammer (Stratagene) for COS-1, HepG2, and NIH3T3 cells. Briefly, 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA was mixed with 10 μl of transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's specifications, and the mixture was added to 6-well plates. When needed, B12 was added to half of the plates 24 h after transfection. At the end of the incubation, reporter gene activity was determined according to the vendor's protocol (Promega). Bicistronic RNA Northern Analysis—Analysis was performed as previously described (13Oltean S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20778-20784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A 32P-labeled probe consisting of a DNA fragment encompassing 650 bases at the 5′-end of the luciferase gene was employed to detect the bicistronic message. In Vitro Transcription—DNA primers containing a T7 promoter sequence were designed to amplify various fragments of the MS 5′-UTR. The PCR products were used as templates for in vitro transcription using the RiboMax kit (Promega) according to the vendor's protocol. The transcripts were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, isolated and 5′ 32P-labeled as previously described (18Nahvi A. Sudarsan N. Ebert M.S. Zou X. Brown K.L. Breaker R.R. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). In-line Probing of RNA Constructs—Labeled RNA fragments were subjected to in-line probing as previously described (18Nahvi A. Sudarsan N. Ebert M.S. Zou X. Brown K.L. Breaker R.R. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼1 nm 5′ 32P-labeled RNA was incubated for ∼ 40 h at 25°Cin20mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), and 100 mm KCl in the presence or absence of ligand (i.e. 200 μm B12 derivative). The reaction mixtures were resolved on a 6–15% polyacrylamide gel (depending on the length of the RNA) and analyzed using a PhosphorImager. REMSAs—For RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays, DNA templates were generated by PCR using the following primers: Forward: TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGCCAACGGCAGGCGTCAAA and Reverse: GTTGTCGAGTCTCCTCCTT. The forward primer incorporated the T7 promoter sequence. RNA probes were synthesized by in vitro transcription with T7 polymerase (Maxiscript kit, Ambion) in the presence of [α-32P]UTP. 15,000 cpm of labeled RNA was incubated with 75 μg of HeLa S100 cell extract (Paragon) in a total volume of 15 μl at room temperature for 30 min, followed by the addition of 1 μl of RNase T1 (1 unit/μl) and incubated for an additional 10 min at room temperature. Heparin was added to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml. When indicated, different forms of cobalamin were added at a final concentration of 200 μm or cell extracts were pretreated with proteinase K (100 μg/ml) before mixing with the RNA. The ribonucleoprotein complexes were electrophoresed on a 4% native acrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. UV Cross-linking Experiments—RNA-protein complexes for UV cross-linking were prepared as described above. Before adding RNase T1, the samples were transferred into a 96-well dish and irradiated on ice with a 254-nm UV light source at 400,000 μJ/cm2. RNA-protein complexes were then resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Statistical Analysis—Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance (Microcal Origin software), and results were considered significant if the p value was <0.05. The MS 5′-UTR Contains an IRES Element—To determine whether the MS 5′-UTR is able to initiate translation internally, a series of bicistronic vectors were employed as shown in Fig. 1A. In these constructs, the first cistron (encoding CAT) is translated via a canonical cap-dependent mechanism. The second cistron (encoding LUC) is translated efficiently only if translation initiation occurs in the intercistronic region. The following vectors were tested: CAT/ICS/LUC as a negative control, CAT/BIP/LUC as a positive control (15Fernandez J. Yaman I. Mishra R. Merrick W.C. Snider M.D. Lamers W.H. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12285-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and CAT/MS 5′-UTR/LUC containing the MS 5′-UTR instead of the BIP sequence. To rule out the possibility that the observed IRES activity does not result from ribosomal read-through, vectors having stable hairpins preceding the first cistron were employed (Fig. 1A). Translation of the first but not the second cistron (Fig. 1B, upper panel) is strongly inhibited by the presence of the hairpin in the CAT/MS 5′-UTR/LUC construct and in the positive control containing the BIP-IRES (Fig. 1B, lower panel). These results provide evidence that translation of the second cistron occurs by initiation in the intercistronic region and are consistent with the presence of an IRES element in the MS 5′-UTR. As an additional control, the LUC/CAT activity was measured in 293 cells treated with rapamycin, which inhibits cap-dependent translation by promoting dephosphorylation and activation of 4E-BP1, a repressor of the cap-binding protein, 4E (19Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). A ∼10-fold increase in LUC/CAT activity was seen in the presence of rapamycin and resulted from diminished CAT activity whereas the LUC activity was unaffected (data not shown). A potential source of error in interpreting data for internal initiation of translation is the possible presence of a cryptic promoter in the test sequence, which would result in a monocistronic luciferase mRNA in addition to the bicistronic message. Cap-dependent translation of the monocistronic RNA would confound the results. We thus tested a luciferase reporter construct in which the SV40 promoter was replaced by the MS 5′-UTR. Only background levels of luciferase activity were detected demonstrating that the MS 5′-UTR does not exhibit promoter activity (Fig. 1C). A second source of error that needs to be considered is the possible presence of a splice site in the MS 5′-UTR. In this case, even if a bicistronic message is produced initially, splicing could generate a smaller fragment containing the second cistron. However, Northern analysis revealed the presence of only a single message that is long enough to accommodate both cistrons, ruling out the presence of a cryptic splice site in the MS 5′-UTR (Fig. 1D). Because optimal IRES-dependent initiation requires trans-acting factors that have a tissue-specific distribution (20Nevins T.A. Harder Z.M. Korneluk R.G. Holcik M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3572-3579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we have examined the efficiency of MS- and BIP-IRES activities in different cell lines (Fig. 1E). Efficiency of the IRES varied within a 2–5-fold range compared with the ICS-containing negative control. The pattern observed with the BIP-IRES was comparable to that reported previously in the same cell lines (20Nevins T.A. Harder Z.M. Korneluk R.G. Holcik M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3572-3579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the highest MS-IRES activity was observed in the 293 kidney cell line, in which MS activity is also reported to be highest (21Finkelstein J. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1990; 1: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Deletion Mapping of the IRES Element—To map the minimal sequence that is required for IRES activity, we generated a series of nested deletions from the 5′-end of the MS 5′-UTR and measured IRES activity in the resulting bicistronic constructs. Fig. 2 shows that the deletions modulate IRES activity, probably because of the inhibitory or stimulatory influences of different regions in the MS 5′-UTR. For instance, the first 54 bases of the MS 5′-UTR are inhibitory, and their deletion increases IRES activity. As the deletions progress toward the 3′-end, stimulatory regions are eliminated, as indicated by a decrease in IRES activity. However, the last 71 bases of the MS 5′-UTR retain ∼80% of the IRES activity versus the full-length MS 5′-UTR. To confirm that the 71-mer indeed harbors IRES activity, we have tested a plasmid containing the 71 bases inserted in the intercistronic region and a hairpin preceding the first cistron. When the hairpin is present, translation of the first cistron is inhibited, whereas translation of the second cistron is enhanced, consistent with retention of IRES activity in this sequence (data not shown). MS IRES Is Modulated by B12—The boundaries of the MS-IRES element and of the B12 responsive element reporter earlier (13Oltean S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20778-20784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) overlap, and raises the obvious question as to whether or not the IRES activity is modulated by B12.AB12-dependent increase (∼60%) in the translational efficiency of the bicistronic vector was observed, and the effect was clearly specific to the second cistron, which is under control of the MS-IRES element (Fig. 3). The fold increase in translation in the reporter construct is lower than the B12 effect on the endogenous gene (∼3.8-fold in COS-1 cells), which could result from placement of the MS 5′-UTR in an artificial context in the bicistronic vector. A similar observation has been reported for the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, which is elevated 3.5-fold upon radiation treatment but shows a 50% increase in reporter activity when its IRES element is inserted in a bicistronic vector (16Holcik M. Lefebvre C. Yeh C. Chow T. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 22Holcik M. Yeh C. Korneluk R.G. Chow T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4174-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). B12 had no effect on the LUC/CAT ratio in constructs containing the BIP IRES or the ICS sequence between the two reporter genes (not shown). It should be noted that the control cells are cultured in medium containing ∼125 pm B12 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Thus, the effect of B12 supplementation, which activates MS (13Oltean S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20778-20784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), is correlated with IRES-dependent translation of MS in this study. Secondary Structure Probing of MS-IRES—Computer modeling of the 71-mer using Mfold (24Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10148) Google Scholar) predicts the presence of a hairpin (between bases -9 and -44) with a long stem (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, this particular hairpin is retained in secondary structure models for all the deletion constructs described in Fig. 2. To test whether this hairpin exists in vivo, we probed the RNA secondary structure using the in-line probing method (18Nahvi A. Sudarsan N. Ebert M.S. Zou X. Brown K.L. Breaker R.R. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 25Soukup G.A. Breaker R.R. RNA. 1999; 5: 1308-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), which relies on degradation of RNA at room temperature and analysis of the resulting degradation pattern (Fig. 4B). Many of the regions that are predicted to be double-stranded in the stem (e.g. bases -36 to -44) are protected from degradation. In contrast, loops are more accessible to cleavage and generate strong banding patterns in the gel (e.g. bases -34, -26 and -25). We also used this method to determine whether B12 binds directly to the MS 5′-UTR. This analysis is based on the premise that binding of a ligand to RNA can cause changes to the secondary/tertiary structure and thus influences the pattern of degradation (18Nahvi A. Sudarsan N. Ebert M.S. Zou X. Brown K.L. Breaker R.R. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Fig. 4B shows the degradation pattern of a transcript spanning the last 71 bases of the MS 5′-UTR in the presence or absence of B12. None of the B12 derivatives visibly altered the degradation pattern, which suggests but does not establish that B12 does not bind directly to the MS 5′-UTR. We similarly found no evidence for modulation of degradation by B12 of the full-length MS leader or of the last 140 bases of the leader (data not shown). The degradation pattern is in generally good agreement with the predicted long hairpin secondary structure in the model for the 71-mer (Fig. 4). The stronger degradation bands are seen in the predicted loops whereas the protected regions correspond to bases in the stem. These results provide evidence for the in vivo existence of the predicted hairpin structure in the MS IRES-element. Fine Mapping of the Minimal IRES Element—The 71-mer was employed further for fine mapping analysis to probe the essential features of a minimal IRES element. To this end, 3–5 bases were deleted consecutively, starting at the 5′-end of the 71-mer. The secondary structure model predicts that the bases -9to -44 form a long hairpin (Fig. 4A) and its role in IRES activity is confirmed by the bicistronic reporter assays (see loss of activity in deletion constructs -42, -35, and -26 in Fig. 5). The integrity of the bicistronic message was established by Northern analysis (Fig. 5B). The equal intensity of mRNA in these samples is consistent with the reporter assays reflecting changes at the translational level. The deletion analysis revealed that the sequence from -47 to -43 (CACGU) is important for IRES activity. In an Mfold analysis, both the last 47 and the last 42 bases of MS 5′-UTR form a stable hairpin with the only difference being that the main stem is 9-bp long in the 47-base hairpin and 7-bp long in the 42-base hairpin. To determine whether the primary sequence or the length of the stem was important, we mutated residues -44 and -43 and introduced complementary changes at -9 and -10 so that the 9-bp stem length was retained. The IRES activity of this mutant was 100% of the activity of the wild-type IRES (not shown). In contrast, mutating residues at the base of the stem so that pairing between residues -44 and -9 and -43 and -10 were disrupted resulted in ∼50% of wild-type IRES activity (not shown). This is consistent with the length of the hairpin stem being important rather than the specific sequence at the positions that were tested. However, these results do not exclude the possibility that the mutations disrupted a tertiary interaction that modulates IRES activity. Because of the small magnitude of the B12 effect in the bicistronic construct (Fig. 3), fine mapping of the B12 effect was not pursued in this study. A B12-responsive Protein Binds to MS 5′-UTR—Whereas the structure probing data do not rule out direct B12 binding to the MS 5′-UTR (Fig. 4), they suggest that the B12 effect may be expressed via a trans factor. To test this hypothesis, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays to detect proteins that bind to the MS 5′-UTR. A labeled RNA probe encompassing the last 140 nucleotides of the MS 5′-UTR, which showed the highest B12-sensitivity in a reporter gene assay (13Oltean S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20778-20784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), was incubated with cytosolic S100 extracts from HeLa cells in the presence or absence of different forms of B12 and analyzed on native PAGE. Of the four complexes that were detected, three bind to the RNA independently of B12 (Fig. 6A). The fourth complex (with the highest molecular weight) exhibits B12 specificity, binding RNA in the order of decreasing strength in the presence of OHCbl>MeCbl≈CNCbl. Binding was not observed in the presence of AdoCbl or in the absence of cobalamins. Preincubation of the cell extract with proteinase K prior to electrophoresis abolished complex formation confirming that binding of proteins to the RNA probe retarded its mobility (Fig. 6B). UV-cross-linking of the ribonucleoprotein complexes and separation on denaturing acrylamide gels provided an estimate of ∼100 kDa for the molecular mass of the B12-responsive protein-RNA probe complex (data not shown). Our studies reveal a novel mechanism of translational regulation of human MS that is IRES-dependent and is modulated by its cofactor, B12. The MS 5′-UTR is 394 bases long in contrast to the 5′-UTRs of most cellular mRNAs that are between 25 and 70 bases in length (26Hershey J. Initiation of Protein Synthesis. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar). The presence of extensive secondary structure (with a predicted δG of > -50 kcal/mol) in the 5′-leader sequence is generally believed to inhibit ribosome scanning (26Hershey J. Initiation of Protein Synthesis. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar). Secondary structure predictions for the full-length MS 5′-UTR, estimate a δG of -175 kcal/mol for melting the multiple hairpins. Structure probing experiments of the full-length MS 5′-UTR confirm that it is indeed highly structured raising the possibility that IRES-dependent initiation could be important for this leader-burdened mRNA. Several cellular IRES elements are activated under conditions of stress (viz. amino acid starvation, irradiation, and apoptosis) during which general cap-dependent translation is inhibited (14Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 15Fernandez J. Yaman I. Mishra R. Merrick W.C. Snider M.D. Lamers W.H. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol.

IRES-dependent translation initiation confers an advantage under these conditions by bypassing general translation arrest and allowing expression of proteins essential for adaptation/survival. MS is an essential gene as revealed by the embryonic lethality of MS-null mice (28Swanson D.A. Liu M.L. Baker P.J. Garrett L. Stitzel M. Wu J. Harris M. Banerjee R. Shane B. Brody L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1058-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). IRES-dependent translation of MS could have evolved to maintain production of this enzyme under different environmental conditions. B12 is a relatively rare, albeit essential, vitamin with limited distribution and is absent in the plant kingdom. We have speculated previously that translational up-regulation of MS by B12 may represent an evolutionary adaptation to the presence of this nutrient (13Oltean S. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20778-20784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), which leads to rapid synthesis and sequestration of the vitamin by the only known B12-utilizing enzyme in the cytoplasm, MS (29Mellman I.S. Youngdahl-Turner P. Huntington F.W. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 30Kolhouse J.F. Allen R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Modulation of IRES activity by B12 as uncovered by this study is novel and affords regulation of MS translation initiation by its cofactor. Recently, a novel mechanism for gene regulation in prokaryotes by vitamins and metabolites has been described, i.e. via riboswitches. The latter afford control of transcription termination and/or translation through direct binding of small ligand molecules to RNA, thereby circumventing the need for proteins (31Winkler W.C. Breaker R.R. Chembiochem. 2003; 4: 1024-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Ligand binding can either stabilize or melt RNA secondary structures with regulatory consequences (18Nahvi A. Sudarsan N. Ebert M.S. Zou X. Brown K.L. Breaker R.R. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 32Winkler W. Nahvi A. Breaker R.R.

Biol. 2003; 10: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). A B12 riboswitch is present in the 5′-UTR of the Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium btuB transporter (18Nahvi A. Sudarsan N. Ebert M.S. Zou X. Brown K.L. Breaker R.R. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). B12 binding inhibits ribosome recruitment thus diminishing production of the transporter when the cofactor is abundant. A phylogenetic analysis reveals that a B12 riboswitch consensus sequence is wide spread in Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms (35Nahvi A. Barrick J.E. Breaker R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Although most riboswitches have been described in prokaryotes, recent reports reveal their presence in eukaryotes as well (36Sudarsan N. Barrick J.E. Breaker R.R. RNA. 2003; 9: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The negative results of the structure probing analyses do not exclude the possibility that B12 binds directly to a responsive element in the MS 5′-UTR (Fig. 4). However, in combination with the observation that the MS 5′-UTR sequence is retarded by B12 only in the presence of cell extract (Fig. 6), they support mediation of the B12 effect by a protein factor. IRES activities are modulated by a number of proteins named ITAFs (IRES trans-activating factors) such as the hnRNP I/polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (37Hellen C.U. Witherell G.W. Schmid M. Shin S.H. Pestova T.V. Gil A. Wimmer E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), the La autoantigen (38Holcik M. Korneluk R.G. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2003; 23: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Variation in the MS-IRES potency in different cell lines (Fig. 1E) suggests the involvement of tissue-specific expression of ITAFs interacting with the MS-IRES. Interestingly, factorless ribosome assembly on the IRES of cricket paralysis virus has been reported (40Jan E. Sarnow P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 889-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and it was suggested that distinct pseudoknot-like structures are important for the correct positioning of the ribosome on the mRNA, bypassing the need for initiation factors. Based on the current study, a model for regulation of MS translation is proposed (Fig. 7). According to this model, the MS IRES is translated more efficiently in the presence of B12 presumably via its interaction with an ITAF. It is potentially significant that the putative B12-dependent ITAF is insensitive toward AdoCbl, a cofactor derivative that is synthesized in the mitochondrion. In contrast, MS, which is cytoplasmic, requires MeCbl as a cofactor and can synthesize it in situ from CN- or OHCbl (41Olteanu H. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35558-35563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), to which the putative ITAF responds. Alkylcobalamins, viz. MeCbl and AdoCbl, are photosensitive, and it is likely that the form of the vitamin that is delivered to the cytoplasm is predominantly in the OHCbl or cob(II)alamin state. Another example of B12-dependent gene regulation involves the B12-binding protein, CarA, which is a transcriptional regulator in Myxococcus xanthus (42Cervantes M. Murillo F.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2215-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 43Lopez-Rubio J.J. Elias-Arnanz M. Padmanabhan S. Murillo F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7262-7270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). CarA is a repressor of the carB operon encoding carotenoid biosynthetic functions and has a DNA binding domain that is directly fused to a B12 binding domain. Binding of B12 to CarA is proposed to release the repressor from the promoter sequence. B12 has also been reported to inhibit the hepatitis C virus IRES-driven translation (44Lott W.B. Takyar S.S. Tuppen J. Crawford D.H. Harrison M. Sloots T.P. Gowans E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2002; 319: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Our studies reveal the presence of three other protein complexes that bind to the MS 5′-UTR independently of B12 (Fig. 6). These putative ITAFs may be involved in modulating IRES activity. The identities of these proteins as well as of the B12 responsive protein are currently under investigation in our laboratory. In summary, we have shown that MS, which is essential for survival, is translated via an IRES mechanism and that a protein factor appears to be involved in mediating the B12-dependent response of the IRES element. Modulation of IRES-dependent translation of MS by B12 represents a novel mode of gene regulation by a nutritional factor, which is also the cofactor for the encoded enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W1967238923,"We investigated the assembly of soluble fibronectin by lysophosphatidic acid-activated platelets adherent to fibrinogen or fibrin. More fibronectin was assembled by activated platelets spread on fibrin matrices than by platelets spread on adsorbed fibrinogen. The difference between platelets adherent to fibrinogen and fibrin occurred under both static and flow conditions. Similar differences were seen in binding of the 70-kDa N-terminal fragment of fibronectin that recognizes fibronectin assembly sites on adherent cells. Antibody and peptide blocking studies demonstrated that αIIbβ3 integrin mediates platelet adhesion to fibrinogen, whereas both αvβ3 and αIIbβ3 mediate platelet adhesion to fibrin. The hypothesis that engagement of the C-terminal QAGDV sequence of the fibrinogen γ-chain by αIIbβ3 inhibits the ability of the platelet to assemble fibronectin was tested by several experiments. Activated platelets adherent to adsorbed mutant fibrinogen lacking the QAGDV sequence (γΔ5FG) were assembly-competent, as were platelets adherent to adsorbed normal fibrinogen that had been pretreated with the 7E9 antibody to the C terminus of the γ-chain. Moreover, adsorbed normal fibrinogen but not γΔ5FG suppressed the ability of co-adsorbed fibronectin to direct assembly of soluble fibronectin by spread platelets. The suppressive effect was lost when a surface of co-adsorbed fibronectin and fibrinogen was pretreated with 7E9. These results support a model in which the engagement of αIIbβ3 by the C-terminal sequence of the fibrinogen γ-chain initiates signals that suppress subsequent fibronectin assembly by spread platelets. This interaction is less dominant when platelets adhere to fibrin, resulting in enhanced fibronectin assembly.

Platelets at sites of vascular and tissue injury are essential for the formation of a hemostatic plug and subsequent arrest of bleeding (1Ruggeri Z.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). The initial step for hemostasis and thrombosis is adhesion of platelets by interaction of platelet surface receptors with extracellular matrix components of the exposed subendothelium of injured vessels. Intravital microscopy using mice lacking various adhesive proteins demonstrates that post-adhesive events are important in stabilizing the hemostatic plug in the injured mesenteric arteriole, which has a wall shear rate of ∼1300 s-1 (2Ni H.

For instance, mesenteric arteriole thrombi detach and embolize more readily in mice lacking plasma fibronectin, suggesting that the interaction of plasma fibronectin with platelets after adhesion plays a role in the formation of stable thrombi (3Ni H. Yuen P.S. Papalia J.M. Trevithick J.E. Sakai T. Fassler R. Hynes R.O. Wagner D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2415-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Fibronectin is a glycoprotein dimer of 230–250-kDa subunits that is present in a soluble form in plasma and other body fluids and in an insoluble form in tissues (4Mosher D. Fibronectin. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989Google Scholar, 5Hynes R. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, New York, NY1990Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast to integrin-mediated adhesion of cells to the RGD-containing midpiece of insolubilized fibronectin, assembly of fibronectin into thin, aperiodic extracellular matrix fibrils is mediated by interaction of the N-terminal 70-kDa portion of fibronectin (70K) 2The abbreviations used are: 70Kthe N-terminal 70-kD portion of fibronectinLPAlysophosphatidic acid;γΔ5FG, mouse fibrinogen (FG) lacking the QAGDV sequence of the γ-chainFXIIIaactivated coagulation factor XIIIFITCfluorescein isothiocyanate. 2The abbreviations used are: 70Kthe N-terminal 70-kD portion of fibronectinLPAlysophosphatidic acid;γΔ5FG, mouse fibrinogen (FG) lacking the QAGDV sequence of the γ-chainFXIIIaactivated coagulation factor XIIIFITCfluorescein isothiocyanate. with poorly characterized cell surface molecules (6Mosher D.F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Microscopic studies from our laboratory demonstrated that soluble fibronectin is assembled into fibrillar arrays by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-stimulated spread platelets by a process that, as with fibroblasts (7McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), is blocked by the 70-kDa fragment (8Olorundare O.E. Peyruchaud O. Albrecht R.M. Mosher D.F. Blood. 2001; 98: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). During the final stage of fibrin assembly, which is catalyzed by cross-linking of the ϵ-(γ-glutamyl)-lysyl bond caused by thrombin-activated coagulation factor XIII (FXIIIa) (9Barry E.L. Mosher D.F.

Coller B.S. Woods Jr., V.L. Marguerie G.A. Ginsberg M.H. Blood. 1985; 66: 724-727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fibronectin, therefore, could stabilize platelet thrombi by several possible mechanisms, which are polymerization on the surface of adherent platelets, incorporation in fibrin clots, and participation in platelet adhesion and aggregation. the N-terminal 70-kD portion of fibronectin lysophosphatidic acid;γΔ5FG, mouse fibrinogen (FG) lacking the QAGDV sequence of the γ-chain activated coagulation factor XIII fluorescein isothiocyanate. the N-terminal 70-kD portion of fibronectin lysophosphatidic acid;γΔ5FG, mouse fibrinogen (FG) lacking the QAGDV sequence of the γ-chain activated coagulation factor XIII fluorescein isothiocyanate. Studies of adherent platelets stimulated by LPA (8Olorundare O.E. Peyruchaud O. Albrecht R.M. Mosher D.F. Blood. 2001; 98: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or of fibroblasts (14Zhang Q. Sakai T. Nowlen J. Hayashi I. Fassler R. Mosher D.F. J. Biol.

We, therefore, initiated a survey of other adhesive ligands for platelet receptors to learn which ones support assembly of soluble fibronectin. In the current studies, we were intrigued to discover that fibronectin and its 70-kDa fragment similarly deposit in fibrillar arrays on platelets spread on fibrin but not on platelets spread on adsorbed fibrinogen. The experiments described below lead us to the surprising conclusion that the inability of platelets interacting with immobilized fibrinogen to assemble fibronectin results from a suppressive effect of the interaction of αIIbβ3 with the C-terminal sequence of the fibrinogen γ-chain. Tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin, GRGDS, o-phenylenediamine, and fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from Sigma.

Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and a polyclonal antibody against fluorescein were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). A mouse monoclonal antibody against human fibrinogen or fibrin (2C2-G7) was obtained from Pharmingen (San Jose, CA). By immunoblotting, the antibody reacted with the Aα- and α-chain of fibrinogen and fibrin under reduced conditions. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, anti-rabbit IgG, anti-hamster IgG, or ChromPure Syrian hamster IgG were from Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories (West Grove, PA).

Recombinant FXIII and human α-thrombin were generously provided by Paul Bishop (Zymogenetics, Seattle, WA) and John Fenton II (New York State Department of Health, Wadsworth Center, Albany, NY), respectively. The mouse strain with fibrinogen lacking the C-terminal QAGDV sequence of the γ-chain (γΔ5FG) and rabbit antiserum against mouse fibrinogen were described previously (19Holmback K. Danton M.J. Suh T.T. Daugherty C.C. Degen J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5760-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Human plasma fibronectin, the 70-kDa fragment, vitronectin, and human and mouse fibrinogen were prepared as described previously (7McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 20Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol.

The human fibrinogen fraction used was from the first peak eluted from a DEAE-Sephadex column and contained only the γ (and not the γ′) splice variant of the γ-chain. The fibrinogens did not contain contaminating fibronectin as detected by Western blotting with rabbit anti-human fibronectin that recognizes both human and mouse fibronectin. Preparation of FITC-labeled fibronectin (FITC-fibronectin) and FITC-labeled 70-kDa fragment (FITC-70K) was described previously (7McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Washed human platelets were prepared as described in our previous report (8Olorundare O.E. Peyruchaud O. Albrecht R.M. Mosher D.F. Blood. 2001; 98: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Final suspensions of washed platelets were adjusted to 3–4 × 108 platelets/ml and supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 and 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA before plating on a 1.2-cm diameter coverslip in wells of a 24-well plate or a 3.5-cm diameter coverslip in a 6-cm-diameter Petri dish or on wells without a coverslip of a 24-well plate. Fibrillar Deposition of FITC-Fibronectin or FITC-70K Fragment by LPA-activated Platelets Spread on Various Substrates under Static Conditions—Preparation of cross-linked fibrin matrix was slightly modified from previous reports (22Corbett S.A. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20943-20948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The following components were mixed: human or mouse fibrinogen, 500 μg/ml; thrombin, 3 unit/ml; FXIII, 5 μg/ml; 2 mm CaCl2 in 0.5 ml Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl). The final mixture, 0.5 ml, was coated onto glass coverslips or wells without a coverslip overnight at 4 °C. The visible fibrin matrix left behind after aspirating all clots was observed under phase microscopy as described previously (23Corbett S.A. Wilson C.L. Schwarzbauer J.E. Blood. 1996; 88: 158-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used for cell-based assays. To determine the efficiency of FXIIIa-mediated cross-linking of human or mouse fibrin, fibrin clots were washed 3 times with Tris-buffered saline and solubilized with 50 μl of SDS lysis buffer (Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, including 6 m urea, 4% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) including 100 mm dithiothreitol at 75 °C. Solubilized clots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (a 3.3% stacking gel and an 8% separating gel) under reduced conditions. Human or mouse fibrinogen, fibronectin, or vitronectin, 10 μg/ml, was coated directly on coverslips or wells without coverslips. These surfaces were compared with surfaces to which fibrin was deposited. For co-coating experiments, coverslips or wells were coated with a mixture of fibronectin, 5 μg/ml, and either normal mouse fibrinogen or γΔ5FG, 0–10 μg/ml, overnight at 4 °C. Surfaces coated with adsorbed proteins or fibrin matrices were post-coated with 1% fatty acid-free BSA for 1 h. In some experiments, adsorbed normal fibrinogen or γΔ5FG was further treated with thrombin, 3 units/ml, for 30 min or hamster IgG or 7E9, 10 μg/ml, for 1 h. After incubation, thrombin or the IgG was removed by three washes. Platelets, 1.5–2 × 108 in 0.5 ml, were added and incubated with HEPES-Tyrode buffer including 2 mm CaCl2 and 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA for 20 min at 37 °C. After washing 3 times, adherent platelets were incubated with 30 nm FITC-fibronectin or the FITC-70K fragment in the same buffer with 1 μm LPAfor 1 h at 37°C. For microscopy, platelets on coverslips were washed, fixed, permeabilized, blocked, stained with 0.1 μg/ml rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin, and examined as described previously (8Olorundare O.E. Peyruchaud O. Albrecht R.M. Mosher D.F. Blood. 2001; 98: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In same studies of platelets binding the FITC-70K fragment, endogenous platelet fibronectin was stained with rabbit polyclonal antibody against fibronectin and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Samples were observed on an Olympus epifluorescence microscope using a 100× objective. Care was taken to image a given fluorochrome at the same settings for all experimental permutations using SPOT RT software Version 3.4 (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). For immunoblotting, platelets on wells without a coverslip were washed 3 times and lysed with 100 μl of SDS lysis buffer. Equal proteins (3 μg) of platelet lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (a 3.3% stacking gel and a 5% separating gel) under reduced conditions and immunoblotted with a polyclonal antibody against FITC (1:2000 dilution). Platelet Adhesion Assay under Static Conditions—Fibronectin, vitronectin, fibrinogen, or fibrin was coated onto wells of a 96-well plate with a black opaque wall and transparent bottom (Corning Inc.). After unadsorbed proteins or fibrin clots were removed, the wells were post-coated with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. In some experiments, 10 μg/ml hamster IgG or 7E9 was preincubated with adsorbed mouse fibrinogen or fibrin for 1 h. After 3 rinses, 1 × 107 platelets premixed with 10 μg/ml antibody against integrin or 200 or 500 μm peptide for 10 min were added in 100 μl of HEPES-Tyrode buffer including 1 μm LPA, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. After washing out non-adherent platelets, HEPES-Tyrode buffer, 100 μl, and the cell viability assay reagent, 100 μl, were added and incubated for 20 min. The reagent determines the number of viable, adherent cells based on luminescence due to ATP in cell lysates (24Crouch S.P. Kozlowski R. Slater K.J. Fletcher J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 160: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Luminescence was detected with a multifunctional GENios Pro plate reader (TECAN, Research Triangle Park, NC). Nonspecific attachment of platelets to surfaces coated with fetal bovine serum alone gave a signal of 1600 ± 250, which was subtracted from the value by the specific binding. Deposition of FITC-Fibronectin or FITC-70K Fragment by Adherent Platelets under Flow Conditions—The parallel plate flow chamber (25Brown D.C. Larson R.S. BMC Immunol. 2001; 2: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 26Li F. Palecek S.P. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 1266-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) was purchased from Glycotech (Rockville, MD). The flow deck and a silicone rubber gasket were placed on a 3.5-cm-diameter coverslip coated with fibrinogen or fibrin in a 6-cm-diameter Petri dish. A reservoir, 4 ml, in which washed platelets, 8 × 108, were prewarmed at 37 °C in a water bath and premixed with 30 nm FITC-fibronectin or FITC-70K fragment in HEPE-Tyrode buffer including 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA, and 5 μm LPA was used. A peristaltic pump connected to the inlet of the flow chamber provided constant velocity flow through the chamber. The platelet solution was recirculated through the chamber at a flow rate of 2 ml/min, resulting a shear rate of 1250 s-1, and each perfusion was done with 4 ml of separate, fresh platelet solution. The flow chamber and tubes were maintained at 37 ± 1 °C. Platelet solutions were circulated through the chamber for 30 min. For microscopy, platelets on coverslips were washed, fixed, permeabilized, blocked, stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin, and examined as described above. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay to Quantify the Amounts of Adsorbed Fibrinogen and Fibrin and Exposure of 7E9 Epitope—The wells of a 96-well plate were coated with fibrinogen or non-cross-linked or cross-linked fibrin. After unadsorbed fibrinogen or fibrin clots were removed, the wells were post-coated with 1% BSA. After 3 rinses, 10 μg/ml mouse IgG, mouse 2C2-G7 anti-human fibrinogen, hamster IgG, 7E9, normal rabbit serum, or rabbit serum against mouse fibrinogen (1:10,000 dilution) was incubated for 1 h followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000 dilution), anti-hamster IgG (1:5,000 dilution), or anti-rabbit IgG (1:20,000 dilution). After washing 3 times, 100 μl of 500 μg/ml o-phenylenediamine in a substrate buffer (25 m citric acid and 100 mm NaH2PO4, pH 5.0) mixed with 30% H2O2 stock solution (1:1000 dilution, Sigma) was added to wells and incubated for 10 min. The enzyme reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 4 m H2SO4. The absorbance was measured at 490 nm. Specific binding of antibody was calculated by subtracting the signal by nonspecific binding of hamster IgG or a normal rabbit serum from the signal by binding of 7E9 or rabbit antiserum against mouse fibrinogen to each substrate. Replication of Results and Statistical Analysis—Microscopic results were obtained from at least three separate occasions with similar results. Experiments with quantitative endpoints were pooled. Pooled data were expressed as the mean ± S.D. and statistically analyzed by analysis of variance using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.). If the analysis of variance conveyed a value of p < 0.05, Dunnett's test was performed to further assess significance. Differences were taken to be significant at p < 0.05. FITC-Fibronectin or FITC-70K Fragment Is Deposited in Fibrillar Arrays by Platelets Spread on Human Fibrin but Not by Platelets Spread on Human Fibrinogen—Correlative light and electron microscopy have demonstrated that FITC-fibronectin is assembled into <10-nm diameter fibrils by platelets spread on fibronectin much more than by platelets spread on vitronectin (8Olorundare O.E. Peyruchaud O. Albrecht R.M. Mosher D.F. Blood. 2001; 98: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As part of a survey of other ligands of platelet adhesive receptors, we investigated if platelets stimulated by LPA and spread on human fibrinogen or cross-linked fibrin assemble soluble fibronectin. On platelets adherent to cross-linked fibrin, short fibrils of FITC-fibronectin formed in association with most spread platelets (Fig. 1A). In contrast, little FITC-fibronectin was associated with platelets spread on coverslips coated with a solution of 10 μg/ml fibrinogen (Fig. 1A). Consistent with previously published results (8Olorundare O.E. Peyruchaud O. Albrecht R.M. Mosher D.F. Blood. 2001; 98: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), FITC-fibronectin was found to assemble at the periphery of platelets spread on fibronectin-coated coverslips but was not organized into fibrils by platelets spread on vitronectin-coated coverslips (Fig. 1A). A variety of experiments failed to find conditions under which adsorbed fibrinogen does support fibronectin assembly by spread platelets. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a monoclonal antibody (2C2-G7) that recognizes fibrinogen and fibrin demonstrated that the amount of fibrin left behind was similar to the amount of adsorbed fibrinogen (not shown), suggesting that the inability of fibrinogen to support fibronectin assembly by spread platelets did not result from absence of enough fibrinogen. Fibronectin was not assembled by platelets adherent to the coverslips coated with solutions of 3–500 μg/ml fibrinogen (not shown), a range of coating concentrations that has been shown to result in different conformations of adsorbed fibrinogen and different morphologies of platelets adherent to the coating (27Coller B.S.

Thus, lack of assembly occurs at a variety of densities or conformations of adsorbed fibrinogen. In addition, fibronectin assembly was absent of when platelets adherent to adsorbed fibrinogen were incubated with FITC-fibronectin for 15, 30, or 180 min (not shown). Therefore, the inability of fibrinogen to support fibronectin assembly by spread platelets is not due to delayed expression of sites for assembly. In the previous studies (8Olorundare O.E. Peyruchaud O. Albrecht R.M. Mosher D.F. Blood. 2001; 98: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), co-incubation with the 70-kDa fragment resulted in decreased deposition of FITC-fibronectin by platelets adherent to fibronectin, presumably by competing with the N-terminal region of intact fibronectin for cell surface sites that initiate fibronectin assembly. We, therefore, compared distribution of FITC-70K fragment to that of FITC-fibronectin. The FITC-70K fragment bound to spread platelets in the same patterns as FITC-fibronectin, and binding was similarly influenced by the nature of the substrate (Fig. 1A). Secreted endogenous platelet fibronectin was not detected by immunostaining of nonpermeabilized adherent platelets by a protocol that easily demonstrated assembly of endogenous fibronectin by fibroblasts (not shown). Thus, binding of the 70-kDa fragment could not be attributed to secretion and preassembly of endogenous fibronectin. These results indicate that the nature of the adhesive event governs the display of binding sites for the N-terminal region of fibronectin. The differences in fibrillar deposition of FITC-fibronectin or FITC-70K fragment by platelets spread on fibronectin or cross-linked fibrin versus vitronectin or fibrinogen were not associated with differences in platelet spreading or organization of filamentous actin cytoskeleton that correlated with ability to assemble (Fig. 1A). Corroborative experiments were performed in which FITC-fibronectin or the FITC-70K fragment bound to spread platelets was extracted and immunoblotted using equal amounts of platelets lysate proteins. Consistent with the microscopy results, band density of FITC-fibronectin or the FITC-70K fragment bound to platelets spread on fibronectin or cross-linked fibrin was greater than band density of FITC-fibronectin or FITC-70K fragment bound to platelets spread on vitronectin or fibrinogen (Fig. 1B). These differences were confirmed by densitometry of immunoblots of replicated experiments (not shown). Fibrin-coated surfaces were reported to result in increased adhesion and aggregation of platelets at a wall shear rate of 1600 s-1 as compared with fibrinogen-coated surfaces (30Jirouskova M. Dyr J.E. Suttnar J. Holada K. Trnkova B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To learn if fibronectin is assembled differently by platelets adherent to adsorbed fibrinogen or fibrin under flow conditions, platelets premixed with FITC-fibronectin or the FITC-70K fragment were circulated through the flow chamber at a shear rate of 1250 s-1. Platelets adhered and spread but did not aggregate on fibrinogen. FITC-fibronectin or FITC-70K fragment did not deposit on platelets spread on fibrinogen (Fig. 1C and not shown). Platelets adhered and aggregated more robustly on fibrin, and FITC-fibronectin or the FITC-70K fragment was incorporated into platelet aggregates that formed on fibrin (Fig. 1C and not shown). These results indicate that, as in the static condition, adherence to fibrin but not to adsorbed fibrinogen leads to binding of soluble fibronectin or its N-terminal 70-kDa fragment by adherent platelets under flow conditions. Platelets Adhere to Fibrinogen via αIIbβ3, to Fibrin or Vitronectin via Both αvβ3 and αIIbβ3, and to Fibronectin via α5β1, αvβ3, and αIIbβ3— Suppression of fibronectin assembly by fibroblasts adherent to vitronectin is dependent on the integrin expression patterns of adherent cells (14Zhang Q. Sakai T. Nowlen J. Hayashi I. Fassler R. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We, therefore, used function-blocking antibodies or peptides to determine which integrins mediate static adhesion of LPA-stimulated platelets to human fibronectin, vitronectin, fibrinogen, or cross-linked fibrin. Antibodies were tested at a single concentration of 10 μg/ml, which is 3-fold higher than the concentration of 7E3 or LM609 that saturates binding sites on 3 × 108/ml platelets (31Coller B.S. Cheresh D.A. Asch E. Seligsohn U. Blood. 1991; 77: 75-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Wagner C.L. Mascelli M.A. Neblock D.S. Weisman H.F. Coller B.S. Jordan R.E. Blood. 1996; 88: 907-914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of the platelets added, ∼2–5% adhered per well coated with proteins or cross-linked fibrin (TABLE ONE). Platelet adhesion to fibronectin, vitronectin, or fibrin was diminished significantly by anti-αvβ3 as well as by anti-β3 or anti-αIIbβ3 antibody. In contrast, only anti-β3 or anti-αIIbβ3 antibody blocked platelet adhesion to fibrinogen significantly (TABLE ONE). Anti-β1 attenuated platelet adhesion to fibronectin but not significantly to other substrates. Treatment with both anti-αvβ3 and anti-β1 antibodies inhibited platelet adhesion to fibronectin more than the individual antibodies, whereas the combination of two antibodies did not show increased inhibition of platelet adhesion to vitronectin, fibrinogen, or fibrin (TABLE ONE). Treatment with 200 μm GRGDS, an inhibitor of adhesion mediated by αIIbβ3, αvβ3, and α5β1 (33Suehiro K. Smith J.W. Plow E.F"
https://openalex.org/W2006637623,"Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) is a cell surface C-type lectin expressed on myeloid dendritic cells and certain tissue macrophages, which mediates antigen capture for processing and presentation and participates in intercellular interactions with naive T lymphocytes or endothelial cells. In their strategy to evade immunosurveillance, numerous pathogenic microorganisms, including human immunodeficiency virus and Mycobacterium, bind to DC-SIGN in order to gain access to dendritic cells. We present evidence that PU.1 dictates the basal and cell-specific activity of DC-SIGN gene-regulatory region through in vivo occupancy of two functional Ets elements, whose integrity is required for PU.1 responsiveness and for the cooperative actions of PU.1 and other transcription factors (Myb, RUNX) on the DC-SIGN gene proximal regulatory region. In addition, protein analysis and gene profiling experiments indicate that DC-SIGN and PU.1 are coordinately expressed upon classical and alternative macrophage activation and during dendritic cell maturation. Moreover, small interfering RNA-mediated reduction of PU.1 expression results in diminished DC-SIGN cellular levels. Altogether, these results indicate that PU.1 is involved in the myeloid-specific expression of DC-SIGN in myeloid cells, a contribution that can be framed within the role that PU.1 has on the acquisition of the antigen uptake molecular repertoire by dendritic cells and macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2016620251,"The homeostatic regulation of essential elements such as copper requires many proteins whose activities are often mediated and tightly coordinated through protein-protein interactions. This regulation ensures that cells receive enough copper without intracellular concentrations reaching toxic levels. To date, only a small number of proteins implicated in copper homeostasis have been identified, and little is known of the protein-protein interactions required for this process. To identify other proteins important for copper homeostasis, while also elucidating the protein-protein interactions that are integral to the process, we have utilized a known copper protein, the copper ATPase ATP7A, as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human cDNA library to search for interacting partners. One of the ATP7A-interacting proteins identified is a novel protein with a single PDZ domain. This protein was recently identified to interact with the plasma membrane calcium ATPase b-splice variants. We propose a change in name for this protein from PISP (plasma membrane calcium ATPase-interacting single-PDZ protein) to AIPP1 (ATPase-interacting PDZ protein) and suggest that it represents the protein that interacts with the class I PDZ binding motif identified at the ATP7A C terminus. The interaction in mammalian cells was confirmed and an additional splice variant of AIPP1 was identified. This study represents an essential step forward in identifying the proteins and elucidating the network of protein-protein interactions involved in maintaining copper homeostasis and validates the use of the yeast two-hybrid approach for this purpose."

Among the PRTs with complex quaternary structures and sophisticated regulation are the glutamine PRPP amidotransferase, which catalyzes the first committed step of purine biosynthesis (7Smith J.L.

Despite decades of investigation, the structural basis of this regulation, and for PRTs in general, is not well understood. ATP-PRTs constitute two distinct subfamilies with different quaternary structures but share a conserved catalytic domain that currently represents the sole member of a fourth (type IV) PRT family. The nominally hexameric “long form,” (or HisGL) enzymes (14Parsons S.M. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4119-4126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bell R.M. Parsons S.M.

Structures of the HisGL subfamily recently determined include apo and histidine-AMP complexes from Mycobacterium tuberculosis ATP-PRT (17Cho Y. Sharma V. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8333-8339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and AMP-bound and N-1-(5′-phosphoribosyl)-ATP (PR-ATP product) bound complexes of HisGL ATP-PRT from Escherichia coli (18Lohkamp B. McDermott G. Campbell S.A. Coggins J.R. Lapthorn A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The hexameric HisGL enzymes possesses a bi-lobal catalytic domain reminiscent of periplasmic binding proteins that bind sulfate, phosphate, and other small ligands (19Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 20Wang Z. Luecke H. Yao N. Quiocho F.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The second ATP-PRT subfamily (“short form”; HisGS) is defined by hetero-octameric enzymes composed of two subunit types (21Sissler M. Delorme C. Bond J. Ehrlich S.D. Renault P. Francklyn C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8985-8990Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit is denoted HisGS to reflect its relationship with HisGL (∼25% sequence identity), as well as the absence of 85–100 residues that comprise the C-terminal regulatory region in the long form (21Sissler M. Delorme C. Bond J. Ehrlich S.D. Renault P. Francklyn C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8985-8990Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 22Bond J.P. Francklyn C. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 50: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Hetero-octameric ATP-PRTs possess a second subunit type, HisZ, which is related to the catalytic domain of functional histidyl-tRNA synthetases (HisRSs), but is inactive on its own (21Sissler M. Delorme C. Bond J. Ehrlich S.D. Renault P. Francklyn C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8985-8990Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 22Bond J.P. Francklyn C. J. Mol.

The hetero-octamer is assembled from two dimers each of HisGS and HisZ (24Bovee M.L. Champagne K.S. Demeler B. Francklyn C.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11838-11846Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and both are required to reconstitute catalytic activity (21Sissler M. Delorme C. Bond J. Ehrlich S.D. Renault P. Francklyn C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8985-8990Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The recent structure of the histidine-bound ATP-PRT complex from Thermotoga maritima provided the first view of the short form variant subfamily, and confirmed predicted structural relationships between HisGS and HisGL, and between HisZ and HisRS (25Vega M.C. Zou P. Fernandez F.J. Murphy G.E. Sterner R. Popoz A. Wilmanns M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, no conclusions could be drawn about the structural basis of PRT function and its activation. Here, we present phosphate-bound and PRPP-bound structures of the hetero-octameric ATP-PRTs that represent the first illustrations of the activated state. Comparison of these structures to the apo-, histidine/AMP, and PR-ATP-bound hexameric complexes of HisGL, and the histidine-bound complex of the hetero-octameric subfamily reveals a common activation mechanism resembling those of glycosyltransferases in general. These new structures define a specific structural role of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-like subunit in the allosteric activation of the PRT reaction, and thereby illustrate how catalytic function emerged from the collaborative adaptation of two functionally distinct ancestral protein domains. Construction of Mutant Proteins—Mutant versions (E130A and Y268F/Y269F) of the HisZ-HisG ATP-PRT were derived from a Lactococcus lactis pQE30 expression construct (21Sissler M. Delorme C. Bond J. Ehrlich S.D. Renault P. Francklyn C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8985-8990Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) by use of the QuikChange® procedure (Stratagene). The double-stranded primers were 45 nucleotides in length, and the mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Overexpression and Purification of Native and Selenomethionyl HisZ-HisG ATP-PRT—The octameric ATP-PRT complex from L. lactis was purified from an E. coli overexpression strain according to a previously published protocol (24Bovee M.L. Champagne K.S. Demeler B. Francklyn C.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11838-11846Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Selenomethionyl-octameric ATP-PRT was overexpressed by inhibiting the methionine pathway (26Doublié S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), and purified in the same fashion as the wild type enzyme. Pooled fractions from the final hydroxylapatite column were concentrated to 15–17 mg/ml, dialyzed into 50 mm Na2PO4 (pH 6.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and stored at 4 °C for crystallization experiments. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of the L. lactis complex were obtained by incubation at 12 °C by the hanging drop method using 2 μl of well solution (15–25% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 400, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m MgCl2) and 2 μl of protein sample at 10–16 mg/ml and 10 mm ATP (or 10 mm N-1-methyl-ATP and 5 mm PRPP) in the drop. The growth of well ordered crystals was dependent on ATP or N-1-methyl-ATP, although the ATP molecule was not visible in the final electron density maps. Initial selenomethionyl crystals were obtained by essentially the same procedures, and then improved by microseeding. Crystals grown in the presence of ATP were derivatized with 2.5 mm sodium tungstate dihydrate (Na2WO4-2H2O). Cryoprotection was performed by addition of 17–18% glycerol before flash cooling in liquid nitrogen. All crystals grew to ∼0.4 × 0.2 × 0.03 mm3 in an orthorhombic space group (P21212) with unit cell parameters of a = 151.68 Å, b = 222.93 Å, c = 86.38 Å. There are four molecules each of HisG and HisZ per asymmetric unit, with an estimated solvent content of 57%. X-ray data were collected at 100 K on a Brandeis B1.2, ADSC Q315, or an ADSC Q4 CCD detector on beamlines X12C, X25, or X26C, respectively, at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Upton, NY). Complete selenomethionyl MAD data sets to 3.1 Å were collected for peak and remote wavelengths on X25, and another remote data set at X26C. The PO4-bound dataset served as the reference for refinement, and was collected at 1.2124 Å on beamline X26C from a tungstate-derivatized crystal that diffracted to 2.9 Å. An additional 3.2-Å dataset was collected from a crystal grown in the presence of N-1-ATP and PRPP. All datasets were processed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Subsequent rounds of refinement were performed using CNS (32Brunger A. Adams P. Clore G. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16918) Google Scholar). Simulated annealing with a 4-fold NCS restraint was alternated with manual rebuilding. TLS refinement using REFMAC within the CCP4 suite (33Collaborative Computational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19667) Google Scholar) proved valuable in reducing the free R factor. The PRPP bound model was refined using rigid body refinement followed by simulated annealing in CNS (32Brunger A. Adams P. Clore G. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16918) Google Scholar). The PRPP-bound and PO4-bound structures contained a total of 2064 and 2056 residues of 2116, respectively. In the final models all non-glycine residues fell into the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Refinement statistics are reported in TABLE ONE. Histidine Inhibition Assays—ATP phosphoribosyl transferase activity was measured by following the formation of PR-ATP at 22 °C over time (9Voll M.J. Appella E. Martin R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1760-1767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions included ATP-PRT at a concentration of 100 nm, and were initiated with PRPP. The absorbance at 290 nm was detected every 9 s for 10 min using a BioMate5 spectrophotometer. End product inhibition was examined by the inclusion of 1 mm histidine. The base-line absorbance was established by setting A290 to zero for the reaction mixture before adding PRPP. Each experiment was repeated at least five times. Overall Structure and Monomer Architecture—The 2.9-Å crystal structure of the phosphate-bound (ATP activated) L. lactis hetero-octameric ATP-PRT was solved by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction, and a PRPP-bound (N-1-methyl-ATP activated) form was refined to 3.2 Å (TABLE ONE). Because of the fact that these forms were crystallized in the presence of ATP or N-1-methyl-ATP (which sedimentation velocity experiments suggest stabilize the 10.7 S R-form of the complex (24Bovee M.L. Champagne K.S. Demeler B. Francklyn C.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11838-11846Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)), they presumably represent the active form of the complex. The overall architecture of the L. lactis complex features an X-shaped central core composed of the HisRS-like HisZ subunits, with dimers of HisGS catalytic subunits inserted into either end (Fig. 2a), and is generally similar to the histidine-bound complex from T. maritima (25Vega M.C. Zou P. Fernandez F.J. Murphy G.E. Sterner R. Popoz A. Wilmanns M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The HisGS subunits closely resemble HisGL subunits from the hexameric ATP-PRTs (17Cho Y. Sharma V. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8333-8339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 18Lohkamp B. McDermott G. Campbell S.A. Coggins J.R. Lapthorn A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but lack the C-terminal histidine binding domain (Fig. 2b). The HisGS fold consists of two α/β domains connected by a twisted β ribbon. Domain I (residues 1–90 and 178–205) folds into a six-stranded mixed β sheet flanked by five α helices, whereas domain II (residues 91–177) comprises a five-stranded β sheet with one helical crossover connection above and two below. The active site lies in the crevice between these two domains. The HisZ subunits (Fig. 2c) feature the seven-stranded antiparallel β sheet flanked by 3–4 α helices and class defining motifs found in HisRS (34Arnez J.G. Harris D.C. Mitschler A. Rees B. Francklyn C.S. Moras D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4143-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase paralogs (35Nakatsu T. Kato H. Oda J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 36Carrodeguas J.A. Theis K. Bogenhagen D.F. Kisker C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), but possess an α-helical insertion domain with a different topology. The HisGS and HisZ monomers from the PRPP-bound (L. lactis) and histidine-bound (T. maritima) complexes can be readily superimposed, but there are notable structural differences. In the phosphate-bound and PRPP-bound L. lactis complexes, residues 30–35 of HisGS form a poorly structured loop, whereas these constitute a well ordered β strand in the histidine-bound T. maritima complex (Fig. 3a, arrow) (25Vega M.C. Zou P. Fernandez F.J. Murphy G.E. Sterner R. Popoz A. Wilmanns M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Conversely, residues 142–147 comprise helix Gα6 in the phosphate-bound and PRPP-bound complexes, but lose substantial helical character in the histidine-bound complex. In the L. lactis complexes, the loop and Gα6 are critical components of the HisGS dimer interface that undergo conformational changes in response to activation. Dimeric Interactions and the HisZ-HisG Interface—The two monomers in each HisGS dimer pack in an antiparallel fashion, creating a hydrophobic interface defined by contacts between Ile-47, Phe-57, and Ile-62 from domain I with Leu-143′ and Val-147′ from domain II (Fig. 4a). Hydrogen bonds between Asn-52 and Glu-138′, and between Asp-53 and the main chain NH of Glu-138′ also strengthen the dimer. The HisZ dimer is stabilized by the symmetrical interaction of Zα1 and Zα1′ in the bottom of the interface, and extensive hydrophobic interactions from aromatic residues that lie under the antiparallel β ribbons that arch over the interface (Fig. 4b). Notably, the histidine-bound T. maritima and L. lactis PRPP-bound complexes differ with respect to the motif 2 loop. Whereas all four motif 2 loops are ordered in the T. maritima complex, only one motif 2 loop is ordered in each of the HisZ dimers in the L. lactis complexes. The four HisZ-HisG interfaces in the phosphate-bound and PRPP-bound L. lactis complexes feature the interaction of HisGS domain I (especially Gβ5 and Gα8–α9) with the insertion domain and antiparallel β sheet of HisZ (Fig. 5a). In the two HisZ subunits with ordered motif 2 loops, the loop interacts directly with helix Gα2 in the HisGS dimer interface (Fig. 5b). Principal contacts include salt bridges between Lys-118 and Arg-120 in the motif 2 loop with Glu-59 and Asp-77, which are located at the C termini of Gα2 and Gα3 in HisGS, respectively (Fig. 5b). Notably, this motif 2 loop/HisGS dimer interaction is conspicuously absent in the T. maritima histidine-bound complex (25Vega M.C. Zou P. Fernandez F.J. Murphy G.E. Sterner R. Popoz A. Wilmanns M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The PRPP- and histidine-bound complexes are also distinguished by an interstitial phosphate ion seen in the two L. lactis HisZ-HisG interfaces with ordered motif 2 loops, but not in the T. maritima complex (Fig. 5a). The position of the phosphate is fixed by Tyr-82 and Lys-189 in HisGS, and Lys-275 and Tyr-277 from HisZ. The association of the interstitial phosphate with the two HisZ subunits possessing ordered motif 2 loops, as well as the high degree of conservation of the residues serving as its ligands (supplemental materials Fig. S1a and S1b) suggests that its presence is not merely a crystallization artifact. By virtue of its location in the HisZ-HisG interface, and its absence in the T. maritima histidine-bound complex, the interstitial phosphate may work in concert with the HisZ motif 2 loop to alter the structure of the HisGS dimer interface, thereby promoting transition to the activated state. The PRPP Binding Site and Activation of PRT Function—Prior sedimentation analysis of the hetero-octameric L. lactis complex revealed that ATP stabilizes a 10.7 S activated R state, whereas histidine and AMP in combination promote transition to a 9.5 S inhibited T state (24Bovee M.L. Champagne K.S. Demeler B. Francklyn C.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11838-11846Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The phosphate-bound and PRPP-bound L. lactis complexes were crystallized in the presence of ATP and N-1-ATP, respectively. Even though no density was seen for ATP, the sedimentation analysis supports the assignment of these L. lactis complexes to the R state. In contrast, the T. maritima histidine-bound hetero-octamer represents a putative histidine-inhibited T state complex (25Vega M.C. Zou P. Fernandez F.J. Murphy G.E. Sterner R. Popoz A. Wilmanns M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Similarly, the hexameric M. tuberculosis histidine/AMP bound HisGL (17Cho Y. Sharma V. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8333-8339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and PR-ATP bound E. coli HisGL complexes (18Lohkamp B. McDermott G. Campbell S.A. Coggins J.R. Lapthorn A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) represent, respectively, inhibited and activated forms. The structural alignment of HisG monomers from all published ATP-PRT structures revealed that pairs of monomers representing the same state (i.e. “activated” or “inhibited”) exhibited lower root mean square deviations (normalized to 100 Cα) than pairs representing different states (TABLE TWO). Thus, the identity of the bound ligand was a more reliable indicator of structural similarity than whether or not the two proteins belonged to the same subclass (i.e. HisGS or HisGL). The observed structural differences between active and inhibited states are therefore not merely artifacts of comparing enzymes from different organisms.TABLE TWONormalized root mean square deviations (rmsd) calculated for pairwise superpositions of HisGS and HisGL monomers from various ATP-PRT structures Alignments were created using the Fast_force subroutine of LSQMAN from the O package (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). The runs were performed using a fragment size of 50, a step size of 25, and 100 as the minimum number of residues to match. The choice of the algorithm was dictated by the uneven number of Cα carbons in the comparison of HisGL and HisGS monomers. The values to the left of the hyphen in the parentheses represent the raw root mean square deviation in Å, which was calculated over the number Cα carbons given to the right of the hyphen. All Cα atoms from the individual HisG monomers were used as input in the search for the best alignment. The values in bold type represent root mean square deviations normalized to 100 Cα atoms for comparison, according to the formula: rmsd100=rmsd/1+lnn/100, where n is the number of amino acid residues in the raw calculation. The normalized values therefore provide a statistical basis on which to compare superpositions within and across the HisGL and HisGS families.MtHisGL, apo (1NH7)MtHisGL, inhibited His/AMP (1NH8)EcHisGL, active PR-ATP (1Q1K)EcHisGL, inhibited AMP (1H3D)TmHisGS, apo (1O64)TmHisGS, inhibited His/AMP (1USY)L1HisGS, active PO4 (1Z7M)L1HisGS, active PRPP (1Z7N)1NH71NH80.76(1.06/205)1Q1K1.201.14(1.77/251)(1.54/20"
https://openalex.org/W2066100639,"Activation of caspases represents one of the earliest biochemical indicators for apoptotic cell death. Therefore, measurement of caspase activity is a widely used and generally accepted method to determine apoptosis in a wide range of in vivo and in vitro settings. Numerous publications characterize the role of the heme-catabolizing enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in regulating apoptotic processes. Different metalloporphyrins representing inducers and inhibitors of this enzyme are often used, followed by assessment of apoptotic cell death. In the present work, we found that caspase-3-like activity, as well as activity of caspase-8 measured in either Fas (CD95) ligand-treated Jurkat T-lymphocytes or by the use of recombinant caspase-3 or -8, was inhibited by different metalloporphyrins (cobalt(III) protoporphyrin IX, tin and zinc(II) protoporphyrin-IX). Moreover, employing the mouse model of Fas-induced liver apoptosis these properties of porphyrins could also be demonstrated in vivo. The metalloporphyrins were shown to inhibit caspase-3-mediated PARP cleavage. Molecular modeling studies demonstrated that porphyrins can occupy the active site of caspase-3 in an energetically favorable manner and in a binding mode similar to that of known inhibitors. The data shown here introduce metalloporphyrins as direct inhibitors of caspase activity. This finding points to the need for careful employment of metalloporphyrins as modulators of HO-1."
https://openalex.org/W2067847244,"Recently, in vitro selection using mRNA display was used to identify a novel peptide sequence that binds with high affinity to Gαi1. The peptide was minimized to a 9-residue sequence (R6A-1) that retains high affinity and specificity for the GDP-bound state of Gαi1 and acts as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI). Here we demonstrate that the R6A-1 peptide interacts with Gα subunits representing all four G protein classes, acting as a core motif for Gα interaction. This contrasts with the consensus G protein regulatory(GPR) sequence, a 28-mer peptide GDI derived from the GoLoco (Gαi/0-Loco interaction)/GPR motif that shares no homology with R6A-1 and binds only to Gαi1-3 in this assay. Binding of R6A-1 is generally specific to the GDP-bound state of the Gα subunits and excludes association with Gβγ. R6A-Gαi1 complexes are resistant to trypsin digestion and exhibit distinct stability in the presence of Mg2+, suggesting that the R6A and GPR peptides exert their activities using different mechanisms. Studies using Gαi1/Gαs chimeras identify two regions of Gαi1 (residues 1–35 and 57–88) as determinants for strong R6A-Giα1 interaction. Residues flanking the R6A-1 peptide confer unique binding properties, indicating that the core motif could be used as a starting point for the development of peptides exhibiting novel activities and/or specificity for particular G protein subclasses or nucleotide-bound states.

Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), composed of α, β, and γ subunits, mediate signaling from transmembrane receptors (GPCRs) 3The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; GDI, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; GPR, G protein regulatory; HA, hemagglutinin; MBP, maltose-binding protein; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; EPPS, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). to a wide variety of effectors (1Gilman A.G.

In the inactive state, intracellular Gα-GDP is tightly bound to Gβγ to form a Gαβγ heterotrimer. Activation of a GPCR results in GDP exchange with GTP in the Gα subunit, concomitant dissociation of Gβγ, and subsequent signal transduction through Gα-GTP and/or Gβγ. The inherent guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity of Gα, which is accelerated by various GTPase-activating proteins, returns the protein to the GDP-bound state, resulting in reassociation with Gβγ and termination of signaling. Approximately 50% of currently marketed drugs target cell surface-accessible GPCRs (3Drews J. Science. 2000; 287: 1960-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (2250) Google Scholar, 4Howard A.D. McAllister G.

Drug discovery targeting intracellular G proteins directly is inherently difficult due to (i) the broad spectrum of signaling events mediated at the G protein level, (ii) the requirement that drugs must cross the cell membrane to reach intracellular G proteins, and (iii) the high sequence and structural similarities between G protein classes (5Höller C.

Chem. 1999; 34: 5-30Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a number of diseases have been attributed to aberrant G protein activity (7Radhika V. Dhanasekaran N. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 8Spiegel A.M. Weinstein L.S. Annu. Rev.

Selection methodologies facilitate the isolation of rare molecules with unique functions from large libraries (10Dower W.J. Mattheakis L.C. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11Lin H. Cornish V.W. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 4402-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Selections with combinatorial libraries have already been used to identify peptides that bind to various proteins in the G protein signaling cycle (9Ja W.W. Roberts R.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 318-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that mRNA display, a selection technique where peptides are covalently attached to their encoded RNA, could be used to isolate Gαi1-binding sequences (12Ja W.W. Roberts R.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9265-9275Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The dominant peptide from the selection, as well as a minimized, active 9-mer sequence (R6A-1), act as guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) and compete with Gβγ for binding to Gαi1(12Ja W.W. Roberts R.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9265-9275Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here, we examine the specificity of R6A peptides for binding to various in vitro translated Gα subunits. Surprisingly, the R6A-1 core motif interacts with Gα subunits representing all four G protein families. Binding of R6A-1 is generally specific for the GDP-bound state of each Gα subunit and appears to exclude heterotrimer formation with Gβγ. Our findings suggest that the R6A-1 core motif peptide will be useful for the molecular design of Gα ligands with unique specificities. Materials—Human cDNA clones encoding various G proteins were obtained from the UMR cDNA Resource Center (www.cdna.org) in the pcDNA3.1+ vector (Invitrogen). The Gα subunits used were i1, i2, i3, oA, q, s (short form), 12, and 15. All in vitro translated Gβ and Gγ subunits refer to Gβ1 and N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Gγ2, respectively. Rat Gαi1, bovine short form Gαs and their chimeric constructs were generously provided by Prof. N. Artemyev (University of Iowa). DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). Peptide/Protein Preparation—The C-terminal amidated peptides GPR-biotin (TMGEEDFFDL LAKSQSKRLDDQRVDLAGQLRNSYAK, K = biocytin), L19 GPR (TMGEEDFFDLLAKSQSKRLDDQRVDLAGYK), R6A-1-biotin (DQLYWWEYLQLRNSYAK), R6A-1 (DQLYWWEYL), and R6A-4 (SQTKRLDDQLYWWEYL) were synthesized and purified as described previously (12Ja W.W. Roberts R.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9265-9275Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). R6A-4 lacks an N-terminal methionine that the originally studied “full-length” R6A peptide contained. Biotinylated peptides were immobilized using streptavidin-agarose (immobilized NeutrAvidin on agarose, Pierce). Approximately 500–800 pmol of biotinylated peptide were used per 10 μlof agarose. Full-length R6A (MSQTKRLDDQLYWWEYL) was expressed as a fusion to maltose-binding protein (MBP) using an in vivo biotinylation system (13Tsao K.-L. DeBarbieri B. Michel H. Waugh D.S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 169: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cloning, expression, and purification were performed as described previously (12Ja W.W. Roberts R.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9265-9275Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). R6A-MBP or MBP was immobilized by random amine coupling on CNBr-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) as per the manufacturer's instructions at a concentration of ∼1 mg/ml hydrated matrix. N-terminal biotinylated Gαi1 (Nb-Gαi1) was expressed and purified as described previously (12Ja W.W. Roberts R.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9265-9275Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A vector for producing biotinylated Nb-Gαs (short form) was constructed analogously, except that an N-terminal His6 tag was also incorporated to facilitate a primary purification by metal chelation chromatography. In Vitro Translation—All G protein subunits were translated separately in coupled transcription/translation reactions using the TNT reticulocyte lysate system (T7 promoter, Promega, Madison, WI). Typically, 0.3–1.0 μg of plasmid DNA and 25 μCi of l-[35S]methionine (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) were used in a 25-μl reaction. Translation efficiency of Gα subunits was quantitated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation of a 2-μl aliquot of each reaction, as per the manufacturer's instructions. Gγ reactions were supplemented with 10 μm mevalonic acid lactone (Sigma) to ensure complete polyisoprenylation (14Neer E.J. Denker B.M. Thomas T.C. Schmidt C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 226-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To make Gβγ heterodimers, independently translated subunits were mixed together (3:1 by volume, Gβ:Gγ) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. To reconstitute Gαβγ heterotrimers, equal volumes of Gα and preformed Gβγ were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 30 min. For the heterotrimer immunoprecipitation assays, Gβ was translated without radioactive labeling due to possible interference in the resolution of Gα subunits by SDS-PAGE. These unlabeled reactions were supplemented with l-methionine (40 μm final). Gα Interaction Assay—Gα translation reactions were desalted and exchanged using MicroSpin G-25 columns (Amersham Biosciences) into buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH at pH 7.5, 6 mm MgCl2, 75 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μm GDP, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (Bio-Rad)). Equivalent aliquots (2–6 μl) of the desalted Gα subunits were used for the in vitro binding assays. Gα was added to 0.6 ml of binding buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH at pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 μm GDP) containing ∼10-μl matrix with or without immobilized target. After rotating at 4 °C for 1 h, samples were briefly centrifuged and the supernatant was removed. The matrix was transferred to a 0.45-μm cellulose acetate spin filter (CoStar Spin-X, Corning, Inc., Corning, NY) and washed with 3 × 0.6 ml of binding buffer at 4 °C (1500 × g, ∼40 s). The washed matrix was then removed from the spin filter for scintillation counting or analysis by SDS-PAGE. An approximation of the fraction of bound G protein was calculated (bound cpm divided by input protein counts, as determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation). Assays with aluminum fluoride were performed identically, except that the binding buffer was supplemented with 10 mm NaF and 25 μm AlCl3. Gαβγ Heterotrimer Immunoprecipitation—Equivalent aliquots (10 μl) of reconstituted Gαβγ heterotrimer were added to 0.6 ml of binding buffer containing ∼10-μl matrix or 1-μl anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Sigma, clone HA-7). After rotating at 4 °C for 1 h, ∼10 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4B Fast Flow (Sigma) was added to the monoclonal antibody-containing samples. After an additional 30 min of rotating at 4 °C, immobilization matrices were washed in 0.45-μm spin filters (3 × 0.6 ml of binding buffer) as described above. A fourth wash was performed in batch, after transferring the matrices to new tubes, to prevent contamination from the spin filter membrane. The samples were resuspended in 2× SDS-loading buffer, incubated at 90 °C for 5 min, and analyzed by Tricine SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed, dried in vacuo, and imaged by autoradiography (Storm PhosphorImager, Amersham Biosciences). Trypsin Protection Assay—Gαi1 (∼25 μm) in digest buffer (50 mm EPPS at pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 μm GDP or GTPγS) was incubated with and without 1.5-fold excess peptide (R6A-4; R6A-M1, identical to R6A-1 with the addition of two C-terminal lysines to enhance solubility; and GPR1, the first GPR motif of AGS3 (15Adhikari A.

Reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. R6A-1 Is a Core Motif for Gα Binding—Previously, in vitro selection with an mRNA display library was used to isolate novel peptide sequences that act as GDIs for Gαi1 (12Ja W.W. Roberts R.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9265-9275Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The minimal 9-mer peptide, R6A-1, retained high affinity and competed with Gβγ for binding to Gαi1. To investigate the binding specificity of the R6A-1 peptide, a pull-down assay was developed using radiolabeled, in vitro translated G protein subunits (Fig. 1A). Cell-free coupled transcription/translation offered a rapid method for screening multiple G proteins (16Garcia-Higuera I. Thomas T.C. Yi F. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 528-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17Mende U. Schmidt C.J. Yi F. Spring D.J. Neer E.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 4538-4544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). R6A-1 and L19 GPR peptides were synthesized with a C-terminal biotin-containing linker peptide derived from the constant region used in the original selection (12Ja W.W. Roberts R.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9265-9275Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The full-length R6A peptide was also expressed as an N-terminal fusion to MBP, which was subsequently immobilized by random amine coupling. [35S]methionine-labeled Gαi1 was first tested against immobilized L19 GPR and full-length R6A, demonstrating specific pull-down of full-length Gαi1, as well as a slightly higher mobility band that corresponds to an alternate translation initiation site (Fig. 1B). The R6A-1 minimal peptide exhibited strong pull-down for all Gα subunits tested (Fig. 2B). There was negligible interaction with H-Ras (a member of the monomeric or small G protein family), suggesting that the R6A-1 peptide is a core motif for binding to Gα subunits in the heterotrimeric G protein family. Conversely, the L19 GPR peptide was highly specific for Gαi1–3 and showed negligible interaction with other Gα subunits (Fig. 2A). This contrasts with previous results that show the GPR consensus exhibits significantly lower, but detectable, affinity and GDI activity for Gαo compared with Gαi subunits (19Peterson Y.K. Bernard M.L. Ma H. Hazard III, S. Graber S.G. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33193-33196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 20Peterson Y.K. Hazard III, S. Graber S.G. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6767-6770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The determined affinities of R6A-1 to Gαi1 and Gαs (KD =∼200 nm and ∼50 μm, respectively; data not shown) suggest that the sensitivity of the binding assay was sufficient to detect weak interactions. The full-length R6A peptide, compared with the minimal R6A-1 sequence, demonstrated significantly less binding to Gαo and Gαs and negligible interaction with Gα15 (Fig. 2C). It is not clear whether the differences between R6A and R6A-1 in relative binding to the various G proteins was due to the N-terminal flanking region of the full-length R6A sequence, the altered immobilization scheme (random amine coupling versus C-terminal biotinylation on the R6A-1 peptide), or steric effects from the comparatively large MBP fusion. However, assuming that the various G proteins are structurally homologous and that the R6A and R6A-1 peptides bind to Gα subunits analogously, the differences in relative binding would most likely be a direct result of the R6A flanking residues. Previously, it was shown that R6A was highly specific for the GDP state of Gαi1 and did not bind to Gαi1-GDP-AlF4- or Gαi1-GTPγS (12Ja W.W. Roberts R.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9265-9275Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To establish the nucleotide state specificity of R6A-derived peptides to various Gα subunits, radiolabeled G proteins were assayed for binding to immobilized R6A-1 and R6A-MBP in the presence and absence of aluminum fluoride. The minimal peptide was specific for the GDP state of all G proteins except for Gα12 and Gα15, where binding was observed in the presence of aluminum fluoride (Fig. 2B). Full-length R6A-MBP demonstrated strong specificity for the GDP state of all G proteins, including Gαs, confirming the weak but specific interaction (Fig. 2C). These findings suggest that residues flanking the 9-mer core motif play a strong role in modulating the binding properties of the peptide, modifying Gα class as well as nucleotide state specificity. R6A Competes with Gβγ for Binding to Gα Subunits—Previously, GPR- and R6A-derived peptides had been shown to compete with Gβγ heterodimers for binding to Gαi1 (12Ja W.W. Roberts R.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9265-9275Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21Bernard M.L. Peterson Y.K. Chung P. Jourdan J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14364-14369Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To determine whether R6A would exclude Gβγ binding for other Gα subunits, in vitro translated Gβ1 and HA-tagged Gγ2 (Fig. 3A) were reconstituted with various Gα subunits and down by pulled immobilized L19 GPR, R6A-MBP, or an anti-HA monoclonal antibody. The tested Gα subunits all appeared to couple to Gβγ heterodimers (Fig. 3B). Co-precipitation of Gγ subunits was not seen when heterotrimers were pulled down by L19 GPR or R6A-MBP (Fig. 3B), clearly indicating that binding to these motifs excludes Gβγ interaction (Fig. 3C). Results for R6A-MBP with reconstituted G12αβ1γ2 heterotrimers were similar (data not shown). R6A and GPR Peptides Exert Distinct Modes of Activity—Previous analyses of the R6A and GPR peptides suggested that their binding modes and mechanisms of action differ (12Ja W.W. Roberts R.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9265-9275Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here, additional assays suggest that R6A binds and stabilizes a GDP-bound conformation of Gαi1 unlike the conformation of the inactive Gα-GDP subunit. Mg2+ binds with high affinity and stabilizes the GTP-bound state of Gα subunits (25Higashijima T. Ferguson K.M. Sternweis P.C. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 762-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Mg2+ binds Gαi1-GDP with weak affinity (25Higashijima T. Ferguson K.M. Sternweis P.C. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 762-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurements of L19 GPR and R6A binding to Gαi1-GDP as a function of Mg2+ concentration revealed distinct trends (Fig. 4A). While R6A showed higher relative binding with increasing Mg2+ concentrations, L19 GPR exhibited the highest binding in the absence of Mg2+. The original isolation of the R6A peptide, from a doped library based on the GPR motif, most likely resulted from the presence of Mg2+ in the selection buffer (12Ja W.W. Roberts R.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9265-9275Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of a Gαi1-GDP-Mg2+ complex indicate that binding of Mg2+ induces switch I on Gαi1 to assume a conformation similar to that observed in the active Gαi1-GTPγS-Mg2+ complex (26Coleman D.E. Sprang S.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14376-14385Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Hence, the R6A peptide may stabilize a conformation of Gαi1-GDP that is similar to the structure of an active, GTP-bound subunit. Trypsin digestions were performed to further probe the peptide-bound Gαi1 complex. GTP-bound Gα is highly resistant to protease digestion, compared with the GDP-bound subunit (27Fung B.K.-K. Nash C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10503-10510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hurley J.B. Simon M.I. Teplow D.B. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. Science. 1984; 226: 860-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). R6A peptides protected Gαi1-GDP from trypsin similarly to Gαi1-GTP (Fig. 4B). Conversely, a GPR peptide-Gαi1 complex showed similar proteolysis as Gαi1-GDP (Fig. 4B). The R6A and GPR peptides did not appear to inhibit trypsin directly (data not shown). These results suggest that the R6A-bound complex is structurally analogous to Gαi1 - GTP and further support distinct binding modes and mechanisms of activity for the R6A and GPR peptides. Mapping of the R6A-Gαi1 Interaction Surface—A series of Gαi1/Gαs chimeric proteins, C1–C8 (Fig. 5A), was used to determine the binding site of the R6A-1 peptide. The chimeras were previously shown to be correctly folded and functional in GTPγS binding assays (29Natochin M. Gasimov K.G. Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Based on the binding seen for chimeras C4, C6, C7, and C8 for immobilized R6A-1, two regions of Gαi1 are required for strong interaction (Fig. 5B). Substitution of residues Gαi1-58–88 for the corresponding residues in Gαs (comparing chimeras C5 and C6) resulted in substantially reduced binding. This region, which includes the linker between the Ras-like and helical domains of Gαi1, might be involved in determining the binding specificity of the R6A peptides. The N-terminal 35 residues of Gαi1 also play an important role (comparing chimeras C2 and C5), most likely by affecting global protein stability and/or conformation. Pcp2, a protein containing a single GPR motif, exhibited binding to the G protein chimeras C4 and C7 (data not shown), agreeing with previous studies (29Natochin M. Gasimov K.G. Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast, the consensus GPR sequence appears to be highly optimized for specific interaction with Gαi as none of the chimeras showed substantial binding to the L19 GPR peptide (Fig. 5B). Previous studies of different GPR motif-containing proteins have mapped key binding interactions that promote class specificity to regions in the Gα helical domain (29Natochin M. Gasimov K.G. Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 30Kimple R.J. Kimple M.E. Betts L. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 31Mittal V. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46772-46778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The GPR consensus region itself, however, binds primarily to the Gα Ras-like domain (30Kimple R.J. Kimple M.E. Betts L. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Hence, it appears that the determinants for Gαi class specificity can be contained within the Ras-like domain, despite the high sequence and structural conservation of the GPR binding site on Gα subunits of different classes (9Ja W.W. Roberts R.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 318-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The GPR consensus peptide may be highly sensitive to the global conformation of Gα subunits rather than specific for particular amino acid contacts, perhaps making the motif easily adaptable for binding to specific Gα classes (e.g. by the addition of flanking residues, as in Pcp2 (30Kimple R.J. Kimple M.E. Betts L. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar)). We have shown that the R6A-1 peptide, previously identified by in vitro selection against Gαi1, acts as a core motif for interaction with Gα subunits and appears to compete with Gβγ for binding. It will be of interest to determine whether R6A-1 also retains its GDI activities for different Gα family members. The R6A-1 core motif may serve as a template for the molecular design of Gα ligands with unique class and/or nucleotide state specificities. Additionally, as the core motif appears to stabilize a distinct conformation of Gα-GDP, it may be possible to develop peptides with unique effects on G protein-effector interaction, GDP exchange, and GTP hydrolysis.

https://openalex.org/W2021765009,"As part of its planning process, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), a component of the National Institutes of Health, periodically evaluates how well it applies its criteria for setting research priorities. For its most recent evaluation, NCCAM compared funding levels in fiscal years 2000 and 2003 for 18 diseases with a substantial public health burden including Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, back pain, cancer, diabetes, coronary heart disease, HIV/AIDS, migraine, and stroke, with 7 measures of disease burden: 1) prevalence, 2) mortality, 3) years of life lost (YLL), 4) years lost to disability (YLD), 5) disability-adjusted life years (DALY's), 6) direct costs of illness (COI), and 7) total COI. There is an increasing relationship between NCCAM research funding and disease burden over the 4-year study period that reflects funding of specific research initiatives. The strength of the individual correlations varied among measures, with the strongest correlations seen with total COI and the weakest seen with mortality. When applied with its other criteria, measures of disease burden aid identification and matching of NCCAM priorities with levels of support."
https://openalex.org/W2124713077,"Biosynthesis of transfer RNA requires processing from longer precursors at the 5′- and 3′-ends. In eukaryotes, in archaea, and in those bacteria where the 3′-terminal CCA sequence is not encoded, 3′ processing is carried out by the endonuclease RNase Z, which cleaves after the discriminator nucleotide to generate a mature 3′-end ready for the addition of the CCA sequence. We have identified and cloned the gene coding for RNase Z in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The gene has been expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein was purified. The enzymatic activity of RNase Z from Synechocystis has been studied in vitro with a variety of substrates. The presence of C or CC after the discriminator nucleotide modifies the cleavage site of RNase Z so that it is displaced by one and two nucleotides to the 3′-side, respectively. The presence of the complete 3′-terminal CCA sequence in the precursor of the tRNA completely inhibits RNase Z activity. The inactive CCA-containing precursor binds to Synechocystis RNase Z with similar affinity than the mature tRNA. The properties of the enzyme described here could be related with the mechanism by which CCA is added in this organism, with the participation of two separate nucleotidyl transferases, one specific for the addition of C and another for the addition of A.

This work is the first characterization of RNase Z from a cyanobacterium, and the first from an organism with two separate nucleotidyl transferases. RNase Z is an endonuclease required for the processing of the 3′-end of tRNAs. RNase Z cleaves CCA-less pre-tRNAs just 3′ of the so-called discriminator nucleotide that protrudes from the aminoacyl stem. To the discriminator nucleotide the CCA sequence is added by nucleotidyl transferase. The gene coding for RNase Z has been identified (1Schiffer S. Rosch S. Marchfelder A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2769-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and the recombinant protein from several sources has been purified and characterized (1Schiffer S. Rosch S. Marchfelder A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2769-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 2Pellegrini O. Nezzar J. Marchfelder A. Putzer H. Condon C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4534-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structures of RNase Z from Bacillus subtilis (3de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nature. 2005; 433: 657-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and Thermotoga maritima (4Ishii R. Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14138-14144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) have been determined, and models for its interaction with the pre-tRNA substrate have been proposed. RNase Z belongs to a conserved group of proteins (ELAC1/ELAC2) within the metallo-β-lactamase superfamily and contains a phosphodiesterase domain. ELAC2 proteins are only present in eukaryotes, are longer, and are thought to have arisen by duplication of an ELAC1 family protein. In some cases zinc-dependent phosphodiesterase activity of RNase Z has been demonstrated (5Vogel A. Schilling O. Niecke M. Bettmer J. Meyer-Klaucke W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29078-29085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The presence of the CCA sequence in the pre-tRNA is an antideterminant of RNase Z activity for eukaryotic (6Schiffer S. Rosch S. Marchfelder A. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (7Mohan A. Whyte S. Wang X. Nashimoto M. Levinger L. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and bacterial (2Pellegrini O. Nezzar J. Marchfelder A. Putzer H. Condon C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4534-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) RNase Z. RNase Z inhibition by the CCA sequence is thought to prevent a futile cycle of CCA addition by nucleotidyl transferase and removal by RNase Z. CCA-containing pre-tRNAs must be processed by alternative pathways. For instance in Escherichia coli, where all 86 tRNA genes encode CCA, 3′-end processing is carried out by exonucleases, after an initial cleavage of longer precursors by the endonuclease RNase E (8Ow M.C. Kushner S.R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1102-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Several exonucleases, functionally redundant, have been described that are able to generate the mature 3′-end (9Deutscher M.P. Li Z. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 66: 67-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A similar exonucleolytic pathway is thought to be present in other bacteria for processing of CCA-containing pre-tRNAs like in B. subtilis, where RNase Z cannot process in vivo CCA-containing pre-tRNAs (2Pellegrini O. Nezzar J. Marchfelder A. Putzer H. Condon C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4534-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). E. coli encodes a functional RNase Z homologue, which has been identified as the previously described RNase BN (10Ezraty B. Dahlgren B. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16542-16545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); however, no obvious function can be ascribed to E. coli RNase Z, because all 86 tRNA genes encode CCA, and CCA-containing pre-tRNAs are not substrates for E. coli RNase Z (10Ezraty B. Dahlgren B. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16542-16545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 11Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15688-15697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). An exception to the CCA inhibition of RNase Z is the bacterium T. maritima where RNase Z can cleave CCA-containing pre-tRNAs (11Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15688-15697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In T. maritima CCA is encoded in all but one of the 46 tRNA genes, and RNase Z cleaves 3′ of the CCA sequence instead of 3′ of the discriminator in those CCA-containing pre-tRNAs. Although RNase Z cleavage occurs mainly after the discriminator nucleotide, there is some heterogeneity in cleavage site selection in vitro. Furthermore, cleavage site can be displaced in a sequence-dependent manner. Variant sequences in the place of CCA can induce alterations in cleavage site (11Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15688-15697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The purified plant enzyme does not recognize CCA as part of the tRNA and cleaves CCA-containing precursors after the discriminator, whereas crude extracts do not cleave CCA-containing substrates (6Schiffer S. Rosch S. Marchfelder A. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that a cofactor is required for CCA recognition in this case. Here we have studied the properties of RNase Z from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, where CCA is not encoded in tRNA genes. We have identified between two possible candidates the gene that codes for RNase Z in Synechocystis and have purified the encoded protein. The effect of the sequence present at the CCA position in the precursor on activity and cleavage site selection has been studied. We discuss the observed effect of the sequence at the CCA site in relation with the fact that Synechocystis contains two separate nucleotidyl transferases for addition of CCA, one C-specific and another A-specific (12Tomita K. Weiner A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48192-48198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Synechocystis is the first organism with two separate CCA-adding enzymes in which RNase Z is studied. Construction of Synechocystis Mutant Strains—A genomic region of 2 kb, containing the slr0050 gene, was amplified with oligonucleotides 0050F2 and 0050R2. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega). A 0.7-kb HindIII fragment, partially overlapping the coding sequence of slr0050, was replaced by a chloramphenicol or a kanamycin resistance cassette (13Elhai J. Wolk C.P. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 68: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In a similar way, a genomic region of 1 kb, containing the sll1036 gene was amplified with oligonucleotides 1036F1 and 1036R1. The unique NcoI site within the coding sequence of sll1036 was used to interrupt the coding sequence by inserting a chloramphenicol or kanamycin resistance cassette. The plasmids containing the interrupted genes were used to transform wild type Synechocystis cells. Cells were plated on chloramphenicol- or kanamycin-containing BG11 medium (14Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) and grown on the same medium for several segregation rounds. Segregation was checked by Southern blot and PCR. Pre-tRNA Substrates—The template DNAs were obtained by PCR amplification based on the published complete genome sequence (15Kaneko T. Tabata S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In all cases the 5′-primer contains a BamHI site, the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and overlaps the 5′-end of the tRNA (for 5′ mature pre-tRNAs) or the 5′ of the leader sequence (for 5′ extended pre-tRNAs). The 3′-primer overlaps the 3′-end of the tRNA and contains variable extra nucleotides and a HindIII site. TABLE ONE shows the primers used for each pre-tRNA sequence. Primer N34GLUF1 and GLU(UUA)R1 were used to generate a template for N34tRNAGluUUAN17 that contains a 5′ leader sequence of 34 nucleotides and a 3′-trailer of 17 nucleotides after the genomic encoded UUA sequence at the CCA position. Primers GLUF1 and GLU(CCA)R1, GLU(CCU)R1, GLU(CUA)R1, GLU(UCA)R1, GLU(UUU)R1, or GLU(UUA)R1 were used to generate templates for tRNAGluCCAN17, tRNAGluCCUN17, tRNAGluCUAN17, tRNAGluUCAN17, tRNAGluUUUN17, or tRNAGluUUAN17, respectively. These pre-tRNAs contain a mature 5′-end and a 3′-trailer of 17 nucleotides after the different trinucleotides sequences indicated. Primers ILEF1 and ILER1 were used to generate a template for pre-tRNAIle(GAT). Primers N10GLNF1 and GLN(UUU)R1 were used to generate a template for N10tRNAGlnUUUN17. This pre-tRNA contains a 5′-leader sequence of 10 nucleotides and a 3′-trailer of 17 nucleotides after the genomic encoded UUU sequence at the CCA position. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into pUC19. Templates for run-off transcription of the different pre-tRNAGlu or pre-tRNAGln RNAs were prepared by digesting the resulting plasmids with HindIII, which generates a precursor with a 17-nucleotide tail after the CCA sequence or its variants as indicated above. Templates for run-off transcription of pre-tRNAIle(GAT) with different 3′-tail length were prepared by digesting the resulting plasmid with HindIII (238 nucleotides tail), HincII (153 nucleotides tail), AvaII (86 nucleotides tail), and FokI (37 nucleotides tail). Other tRNA templates have been described (16Pascual A. Vioque A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).

Altman S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6327-6334Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Labeling at the 3′-end was done with [5′-32P]pCp by T4 RNA ligase as described (17Guerrier-Takada C. Altman S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6327-6334Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recombinant Protein Purification—The coding sequences of the Synechocystis proteins to be purified, deduced from the published sequence (15Kaneko T. Tabata S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), were amplified by PCR and inserted in pET28a (Novagen) in-frame with the amino-terminal hexahistidine sequence as follows: slr0050 was amplified with oligonucleotides slr0050F3 and slr0050R3. The PCR fragment was digested with NdeI and SacI and cloned into pET28a digested with the same enzymes; sll1036 was amplified with oligonucleotides sll1036F1 and sll1036R1. The PCR fragment was digested with NheI and SacI and cloned in pET28a digested with the same enzymes; sll0825 (C-specific tRNA nucleotidyl transferase, Ntase(C)) 3The abbreviations used are: Ntase(C), C specific tRNA nucleotidyl transferase; pre-tRNA, precursor of tRNA; tRNA, transfer RNA. (12Tomita K. Weiner A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48192-48198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was amplified with oligonucleotides 0825F2 and 0825R2. The PCR product was cloned in pGEM-T. The resulting plasmid was digested with SacII, treated with the exonucleolytic activity of Klenow, and then digested with SacI. The fragment containing the sll0825 open reading frame was inserted in pET28a that had been digested with NdeI, filled in with Klenow, and finally digested with SacI. The expected proteins expressed from the recombinant plasmids would contain several extra amino acids at the amino end, including a (His)6 tag. The recombinant plasmids were introduced in BL21(DE3)pLys (Novagen) by electroporation. Cells were grown at 37 °C in minimal M9 medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. When A600 was around 0.5, 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added. Cells were harvested after 3-h incubation at 37 °C. The cell extract was prepared by sonication in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer A) and clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. His-tagged proteins were purified from the soluble protein fraction by nickel affinity chromatography on 1-ml His-trap columns using an Äkta fast-protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 10 ml of 50 mm imidazole in buffer A before applying a 50-500 mm imidazole gradient in buffer A. His-tagged recombinant proteins eluted at 100-150 mm imidazole. The appropriate fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A containing 50% glycerol, and frozen at -20 °C. The proteins purified this way were free of contaminating E. coli nuclease or phosphodiesterase activities (see below). Phosphodiesterase Assay—Phosphodiesterase activity was measured as described (5Vogel A. Schilling O. Niecke M. Bettmer J. Meyer-Klaucke W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29078-29085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using the substrates bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate or thymidine-5′-monophosphate-p-nitrophenylester. Reaction mixes, containing 5 mm substrate and 5 μg of purified protein in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, were incubated at 22 °C. p-Nitrophenol production was followed spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. RNase Z Assay—For single turnover experiments, 1000-5000 cpm (0.1 nm) of labeled pre-tRNAs were incubated in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol in the presence of 3 nm of the enzyme fraction at 37 °C. To terminate the reaction, one volume of loading dye containing 10 m urea and 25 mm EDTA was added, and the reaction products were separated in polyacrylamide/7 m urea gels, and the reaction products were detected with a Cyclone Phosphor System (Packard). The data were adjusted to a single exponential equation. For the determination of Km and kcat under steady-state conditions, assays were done in the same conditions with varying concentrations of substrate (0.05-5 μm). The data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation. In competition assays, 5 nm RNase Z were incubated in the same reaction mix with 0.2 nm 32P-labeled active pre-tRNA and variable amounts of unlabeled RNAs. As an unrelated control in inhibition assays, a 90-bp RNA (pBSK RNA), obtained by T7 RNA polymerase in vitro transcription from pBluescript SK-digested with XbaI, was used. The data were adjusted to a competitive inhibition equation as described previously (18Qin H. Sosnick T.R. Pan T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11202-11210Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Nucleotidyl Transferase Assay—10 μm pre-tRNA was incubated in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ATP, and 0.05 mm [α-32P]CTP (6.25 μCi/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 40 nm purified Synechocystis Ntase(C). In coupled assays, 50 nm purified RNase Z was added also to the reaction mix together with Ntase(C). Radioactively labeled RNAs were separated by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide/7 m urea gels and detected with a Cyclone Phosphor System (Packard). Primer Extension—A preparative RNase Z assay was set up with 125 ng of unlabeled substrate and enough enzyme to obtain almost complete processing in 60 min. The reaction products were phenol-extracted and precipitated with ethanol and used as templates in primer extension. Primer extensions were performed by standard procedures with oligonucleotides GLXPE and ILEPE (TABLE ONE) labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Identification of slr0050 and sll1036—Blast searches of the Synechocystis genome identified two open reading frames (slr0050 and sll1036) with significant similarity to RNase Z from other organisms. Both proteins correspond to the short version (ElaC1) of RNase Z and contain the phosphodiesterase histidine motif (Fig. 1), although sll1036 lacks two of the conserved motifs present in the metallo-β-lactamase super-family and that are found in known RNase Z (4Ishii R. Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14138-14144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Similar proteins were identified in all the cyanobacterial sequenced genomes. They are grouped in two families (Fig. 2), one represented by Synechocystis slr0050 and the other represented by Synechocystis sll1036. All the cyanobacteria analyzed contain one single protein homologue in the slr0050 group. Of the thirteen cyanobacterial genomes analyzed, six (Gloebacter violaceus PCC7421, Prochlorococcus marinus MIT9313, P. marinus SS120, P. marinus MED4, Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942, and Synechococcus sp. WH8102) lack a representative in the sll1036 group. However, Trichodesmium erythraeum contains three, and Anabaena variabilis ATCC29413, Nostoc punctiforme PCC73102, and Nostoc sp. PCC7120 contain two proteins in this group.FIGURE 2Phylogenetic tree of RNase Z and related proteins from cyanobacteria.

Others are indicated in the legend of Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inactivation of slr0050 and sll1036—The coding sequence of slr0050 and sll1036 has been interrupted by the insertion of an antibiotic resistance cassette. The sll1036 insertion was readily fully segregated, indicating that the encoded protein is not essential for growth under normal culture conditions. No differences were observed in growth rate between the sll1036 null strain and the wild type strain under normal growth conditions. In contrast, it was not possible to obtain a strain with all the chromosomal copies of slr0050 interrupted even after many rounds of segregation at increasing antibiotic concentration, suggesting that slr0050 is an essential gene in Synechocystis. In Vitro Activities of slr0050 and sll1036—To functionally characterize slr0050 and sll1036, the corresponding genes were cloned in pET28 with a histidine tag at the amino end and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. The purified proteins were assayed for RNase Z activity with radioactively labeled tRNAGluUUAN17. Only the slr0050 protein showed significant RNase Z activity (Fig. 3). It has been shown that some RNase Z proteins have phosphodiesterase activity (5Vogel A. Schilling O. Niecke M. Bettmer J. Meyer-Klaucke W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29078-29085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) with thymi-dine-5′-monophosphate-p-nitrophenylester or bis(p-nitrophenyl)-phosphate. Both slr0050 and sll1036 showed significant phosphodiesterase activity with bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate (Fig. 4), although the specific activity of slr0050 was about 4-fold higher. None had phosphodiesterase activity with thymidine-5′-monophosphate-p-nitrophenylester (not shown).FIGURE 4Phosphodiesterase activity of slr0050 and sll1036. Time course of the phosphodiesterase activity of slr0050 (open circles) and sll1036 (black circles) on bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate. The assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” in a 1-ml reaction mix containing 120 nm purified protein. As a control of the possible presence of E. coli phosphodiesterase activity in the His-tagged purified proteins, His-tagged Synechocystis Ntase(C) (squares), which elutes at the same position than slr0050 and sll1036 in His-trap columns, was used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of 5′ and 3′ Extensions on Synechocystis RNase Z Activity—The RNase Z activity of slr0050 was further characterized. We have previously shown that 5′ extended precursors are properly processed in vivo at the 3′-end (19Tous C. Vega-Palas M.A. Vioque A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29059-29066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) suggesting that RNase Z can act before RNase P in the pre-tRNA biosynthetic pathway. We have compared the RNase Z activity of slr0050 with a substrate containing an extension of 34 nucleotides at the 5′-end (N34tRNAGluUUAN17) and the 5′ mature substrate tRNAGluUUAN17. No significant differences were observed (not shown). Similar result was obtained with N10tRNAGlnUUUN17. The effect of the length of the 3′-tail was assayed with pre-tRNAIle(GAT) with 3′-tails of different length (Fig. 5). tRNAIle(GAT) is the only pre-tRNA in Synechocystis with CC encoded after the discriminator and is transcribed from the only duplicated tRNA gene in Synechocystis, within the duplicated ribosomal operons. There were some slight differences in cleavage efficiency that do not correlate in a simple way to tail length. RNase Z Activity on Sequence Variants after the Discriminator Nucleotide—We have analyzed the effect on activity of the trinucleotide sequence after the discriminator in pre-tRNAs. For that purpose, we have compared the RNase Z activity of slr0050 with pre-tRNAGlu that contains different trinucleotides sequences at the CCA position followed by a constant tail of 17 nucleotides (tRNAGluUUAN17, tRNAGlu-CUAN17, tRNAGluCCUN17, tRNAGluUCAN17, tRNAGluUUUN17, and tRNAGluCCAN17). There was RNase Z activity with all substrates except with tRNAGluCCAN17 (Fig. 6). Activity was compared under single turnover conditions (TABLE TWO). Maximum activity was observed with tRNAGluUUAN17, which contains the genomic encoded UUA sequence. tRNAGluCUAN17 and tRNAGluCCUN17 were also active substrates, although with reduced reaction rates. Steady-state kinetics was also analyzed for tRNAGluUUAN17, tRNAGluCUAN17, and tRNAGluCCUN17. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) was reduced in tRNAGluCUAN17, and tRNAGluCCUN17 with respect to tRNAGluUUAN17. This is due mainly to reduction of kcat.TABLE TWOActivity of purified slr0050 with tRNA GluUUAN17 and its variantsSingle turnoveraReaction rates were measured under single turnover conditions with 0.1 nm of 3′-labeled pre-tRNAs in the presence of 3 nm enzyme, and the data were adjusted to a single exponential equation.Steady statebReaction rates were measured under steady-state conditions with variable concentrations (0.1-5 μm) of 3′-labeled pre-tRNAs in the presence of 3 nm enzyme, and the data were adjusted to the Michaelis-Menten equation.SubstrateKobsRelative activityKmkcatkcat/Kmmin−1%μmmin−1UUAN172.89 ± 0.251000.96 ± 0.38135.25 ± 18.28140.9UUUN171.84 ± 0.2964NDcND, not determined.NDNDUCAN172.41 ± 0.0984NDNDNDCUAN171.13 ± 0.10391.55 ± 0.3117.83 ± 1.4211.5CCUN170.46 ± 0.04160.47 ± 0.108.21 ± 0.5917.5CCAN1700NDNDNDa Reaction rates were measured under single turnover conditions with 0.1 nm of 3′-labeled pre-tRNAs in the presence of 3 nm enzyme, and the data were adjusted to a single exponential equation.b Reaction rates were measured under steady-state conditions with variable concentrations (0.1-5 μm) of 3′-labeled pre-tRNAs in the presence of 3 nm enzyme, and the data were adjusted to the Michaelis-Menten equation.c ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Identification of RNase Z Cleavage Site—The electrophoretic pattern shown in Fig. 6 suggests heterogeneity in the size of the 3′-fragment generated by RNase Z cleavage of pre-tRNAs. This could be due to heterogeneity in the 3′-end of the substrate by addition of non-template nucleotides by T7 RNA polymerase or to heterogeneity in cleavage site selection by RNase Z (see below). What is more, the size of the 3′-fragment generated by RNase Z seems to be slightly smaller in CUA and CCU-containing substrates than in the other three, which suggests a different cleavage site. The cleavage site of RNase Z was precisely determined by primer extension in three sequence variants of the pre-tRNAGlu substrate, those containing UUA, CUA, or CCU after the discriminator. The substrate with the native UUA sequence, tRNAGluUUAN17, was cleaved at the correct expected site, but also a large amount of cleavage was detected before the discriminator (Fig. 7A). In contrast, the main cleavage site in tRNAGluCUAN17 was 3′ of C. In tRNAGluCCUN17 the main cleavage site was 3′ of CC. These results clearly indicate that cleavage site selection by Synechocystis RNase Z is dependent on the sequence around the cleavage site. The presence of C or CC 3′ of the discriminator nucleotide produces a displacement of one or two nucleotides of the cleavage site, respectively. These results were confirmed with two other pre-tRNAs. tRNAIleCCUN86 was treated w"
https://openalex.org/W2142819667,"Sterols are essential components of virtually all higher eukaryotic organisms, though the exact identity of the dominating sterol varies between species, from the C-27 of cholesterol in vertebrates to the C-28 and C-29 sterols of plants and invertebrates. In addition to their role as structural components of cell membranes these sterols are also converted into a variety of biologically active hormones. This conversion generally involves modifications of the basic structure of the sterol by dealkylation, hydroxylation and/or isomerization. Recent studies have demonstrated that irreversible inactivation of both plant and insect hormones is achieved by a specific C-26 hydroxylation. The concept of sterol deactivation by 26-hydroxylation appears to be an example of an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that has persisted despite the widely varying requirements for sterols in the species where it has been detected."
