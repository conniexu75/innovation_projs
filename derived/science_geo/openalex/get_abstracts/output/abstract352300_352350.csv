https://openalex.org/W1965428318,"Much attention has focused on a small set of transcription factors that maintain human or mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells in a pluripotent state. To gain a more complete understanding of the regulatory network that maintains this state, we identified target promoters of nine transcription factors, including somatic cell reprogramming factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) and others (Nanog, Dax1, Rex1, Zpf281, and Nac1), on a global scale in mouse ES cells. We found that target genes fall into two classes: promoters bound by few factors tend to be inactive or repressed, whereas promoters bound by more than four factors are largely active in the pluripotent state and become repressed upon differentiation. Furthermore, we propose a transcriptional hierarchy for reprogramming factors and broadly distinguish targets of c-Myc versus other factors. Our data provide a resource for exploration of the complex network maintaining pluripotency."

Specifically, we hypothesized that spending money on other people may have a more positive impact on happiness than spending money on oneself. Providing converging evidence for this hypothesis, we found that spending more of one's income on others predicted greater happiness both cross-sectionally (in a nationally representative survey study) and longitudinally (in a field study of windfall spending). Finally, participants who were randomly assigned to spend money on others experienced greater happiness than those assigned to spend money on themselves."
https://openalex.org/W2166037178,"Complex organisms require tissue-specific transcriptional programs, yet little is known about how these are established. The transcription factor FoxA1 is thought to contribute to gene regulation through its ability to act as a pioneer factor binding to nucleosomal DNA. Through genome-wide positional analyses, we demonstrate that FoxA1 cell type-specific functions rely primarily on differential recruitment to chromatin predominantly at distant enhancers rather than proximal promoters. This differential recruitment leads to cell type-specific changes in chromatin structure and functional collaboration with lineage-specific transcription factors. Despite the ability of FoxA1 to bind nucleosomes, its differential binding to chromatin sites is dependent on the distribution of histone H3 lysine 4 dimethylation. Together, our results suggest that methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 is part of the epigenetic signature that defines lineage-specific FoxA1 recruitment sites in chromatin. FoxA1 translates this epigenetic signature into changes in chromatin structure thereby establishing lineage-specific transcriptional enhancers and programs."
https://openalex.org/W1977694851,"Pattern separation, the process of transforming similar representations or memories into highly dissimilar, nonoverlapping representations, is a key component of many functions ascribed to the hippocampus. Computational models have stressed the role of the hippocampus and, in particular, the dentate gyrus and its projections into the CA3 subregion in pattern separation. We used high-resolution (1.5-millimeter isotropic voxels) functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain activity during incidental memory encoding. Although activity consistent with a bias toward pattern completion was observed in CA1, the subiculum, and the entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices, activity consistent with a strong bias toward pattern separation was observed in, and limited to, the CA3/dentate gyrus. These results provide compelling evidence of a key role of the human CA3/dentate gyrus in pattern separation."
https://openalex.org/W2148242921,"Insulin/IGF-1-like signaling (IIS) is central to growth and metabolism and has a conserved role in aging. In C. elegans, reductions in IIS increase stress resistance and longevity, effects that require the IIS-inhibited FOXO protein DAF-16. The C. elegans transcription factor SKN-1 also defends against oxidative stress by mobilizing the conserved phase 2 detoxification response. Here we show that IIS not only opposes DAF-16 but also directly inhibits SKN-1 in parallel. The IIS kinases AKT-1, -2, and SGK-1 phosphorylate SKN-1, and reduced IIS leads to constitutive SKN-1 nuclear accumulation in the intestine and SKN-1 target gene activation. SKN-1 contributes to the increased stress tolerance and longevity resulting from reduced IIS and delays aging when expressed transgenically. Furthermore, SKN-1 that is constitutively active increases life span independently of DAF-16. Our findings indicate that the transcription network regulated by SKN-1 promotes longevity and is an important direct target of IIS."
https://openalex.org/W2057697660,"Iron oxides occur ubiquitously in environmental, geological, planetary, and technological settings. They exist in a rich variety of structures and hydration states. They are commonly fine-grained (nanophase) and poorly crystalline. This review summarizes recently measured thermodynamic data on their formation and surface energies. These data are essential for calculating the thermodynamic stability fields of the various iron oxide and oxyhydroxide phases and understanding their occurrence in natural and anthropogenic environments. The competition between surface enthalpy and the energetics of phase transformation leads to the general conclusion that polymorphs metastable as micrometer-sized or larger crystals can often be thermodynamically stabilized at the nanoscale. Such size-driven crossovers in stability help to explain patterns of occurrence of different iron oxides in nature."

https://openalex.org/W1978489636,"Chlorides commonly precipitate during the evaporation of surface water or groundwater and during volcanic outgassing. Spectrally distinct surface deposits consistent with chloride-bearing materials have been identified and mapped using data from the 2001 Mars Odyssey Thermal Emission Imaging System. These deposits are found throughout regions of low albedo in the southern highlands of Mars. Geomorphologic evidence from orbiting imagery reveals these deposits to be light-toned relative to their surroundings and to be polygonally fractured. The deposits are small (&lt; ∼25 km 2 ) but globally widespread, occurring in middle to late Noachian terrains with a few occurrences in early Hesperian terrains. The identification of chlorides in the ancient southern highlands suggests that near-surface water was available and widespread in early Martian history."
https://openalex.org/W1982298710,"Diffusion of atoms in a crystalline lattice is a thermally activated process that can be strongly accelerated by defects such as grain boundaries or dislocations. When carried by dislocations, this elemental mechanism is known as “pipe diffusion.” Pipe diffusion has been used to explain abnormal diffusion, Cottrell atmospheres, and dislocation-precipitate interactions during creep, although this rests more on conjecture than on direct demonstration. The motion of dislocations between silicon nanoprecipitates in an aluminum thin film was recently observed and controlled via in situ transmission electron microscopy. We observed the pipe diffusion phenomenon and measured the diffusivity along a single dislocation line. It is found that dislocations accelerate the diffusion of impurities by almost three orders of magnitude as compared with bulk diffusion."
https://openalex.org/W2019754186,"The ability to select a better option from multiple acceptable ones is important for animals to optimize their resources. The mechanisms that underlie such decision-making processes are not well understood. We found that selection of egg-laying site in Drosophila melanogaster is a suitable system to probe the neural circuit that governs simple decision-making processes. First, Drosophila females pursue active probing of the environment before depositing each egg, apparently to evaluate site quality for every egg. Second, Drosophila females can either accept or reject a sucrose-containing medium, depending on the context. Last, communication of the “acceptability” of the sucrose-containing medium as an egg-laying option to the reproductive system depends on the function of a group of insulin-like peptide 7 (ILP7)–producing neurons. These findings suggest that selection of egg-laying site involves a simple decision-making process and provide an entry point toward a systematic dissection of this process."
https://openalex.org/W2050812153,"The mutual control of the electric and magnetic properties of a solid is currently of great interest because of the possible application for novel electronic devices. We report on the low-magnetic-field (for example, B values of ±30 milliteslas) control of the polarization ( P ) vector in a hexaferrite, Ba 2 Mg 2 Fe 12 O 22 , which shows the helimagnetic spin structure with the propagation vector k 0 parallel to [001]. The B -induced transverse conical spin structure carries the P vector directing perpendicular to both B and k 0 , in accord with the recently proposed spin-current model. Then, the oscillating or multidirectionally rotating B produces the cyclic displacement current via the flexible handling of the magnetic cone axis."
https://openalex.org/W2161355984,"Telomerase is a multisubunit ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that adds telomere repeats to the ends of chromosomes. Three essential telomerase components have been identified thus far: the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), the telomerase RNA component (TERC), and the TERC-binding protein dyskerin. Few other proteins are known to be required for human telomerase function, limiting our understanding of both telomerase regulation and mechanisms of telomerase action. Here, we identify the ATPases pontin and reptin as telomerase components through affinity purification of TERT from human cells. Pontin interacts directly with both TERT and dyskerin, and the amount of TERT bound to pontin and reptin peaks in S phase, evidence for cell-cycle-dependent regulation of TERT. Depletion of pontin and reptin markedly impairs telomerase RNP accumulation, indicating an essential role in telomerase assembly. These findings reveal an unanticipated requirement for additional enzymes in telomerase biogenesis and suggest alternative approaches for inhibiting telomerase in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2079542122,"Curcumin is a natural phenolic component of yellow curry spice, which is used in some cultures for the treatment of diseases associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. Curcumin has been reported to be capable of preventing the death of neurons in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders, but its possible effects on developmental and adult neuroplasticity are unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effects of curcumin on mouse multi-potent neural progenitor cells (NPC) and adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Curcumin exerted biphasic effects on cultured NPC; low concentrations stimulated cell proliferation, whereas high concentrations were cytotoxic. Curcumin activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and p38 kinases, cellular signal transduction pathways known to be involved in the regulation of neuronal plasticity and stress responses. Inhibitors of ERKs and p38 kinases effectively blocked the mitogenic effect of curcumin in NPC. Administration of curcumin to adult mice resulted in a significant increase in the number of newly generated cells in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus, indicating that curcumin enhances adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Our findings suggest that curcumin can stimulate developmental and adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and a biological activity that may enhance neural plasticity and repair."
https://openalex.org/W2028503280,"Communication of mitochondria with the rest of the cell requires beta-barrel proteins of the outer membrane. All beta-barrel proteins are synthesized as precursors in the cytosol and imported into mitochondria by the general translocase TOM and the sorting machinery SAM. The SAM complex contains two proteins essential for cell viability, the channel-forming Sam50 and Sam35. We have identified the sorting signal of mitochondrial beta-barrel proteins that is universal in all eukaryotic kingdoms. The beta-signal initiates precursor insertion into a hydrophilic, proteinaceous membrane environment by forming a ternary complex with Sam35 and Sam50. Sam35 recognizes the beta-signal, inducing a major conductance increase of the Sam50 channel. Subsequent precursor release from SAM is coupled to integration into the lipid phase. We propose that a two-stage mechanism of signal-driven insertion into a membrane protein complex and subsequent integration into the lipid phase may represent a general mechanism for biogenesis of beta-barrel proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1982655562,"Glycoprotein B (gB) is one of the essential components for infection by herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1). Although several cellular receptors that associate with glycoprotein D (gD), such as herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) and Nectin-1, have been identified, specific molecules that mediate HSV-1 infection by associating with gB have not been elucidated. Here, we found that paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor (PILR) α associates with gB, and cells transduced with PILRα become susceptible to HSV-1 infection. Furthermore, HSV-1 infection of human primary cells expressing both HVEM and PILRα was blocked by either anti-PILRα or anti-HVEM antibody. Our results demonstrate that cellular receptors for both gB and gD are required for HSV-1 infection and that PILRα plays an important role in HSV-1 infection as a coreceptor that associates with gB. These findings uncover a crucial aspect of the mechanism underlying HSV-1 infection. Glycoprotein B (gB) is one of the essential components for infection by herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1).

Our results demonstrate that cellular receptors for both gB and gD are required for HSV-1 infection and that PILRα plays an important role in HSV-1 infection as a coreceptor that associates with gB. These findings uncover a crucial aspect of the mechanism underlying HSV-1 infection. Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) is the prototype of the diverse α-herpesvirus family, which generally causes mucocutaneous lesions but also is involved in lethal encephalitis. HSV-1 establishes latent infections in neurons of peripheral ganglia and may reactivate to cause recurrent lesions (Whitley and Roizman, 2001Whitley R.J. Roizman B. Herpes simplex virus infections.Lancet. 2001; 357: 1513-1518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Entry of HSV-1 into cells depends upon interactions between cell-surface receptors and viral proteins on the virion. Among the surface glycoproteins of HSV-1, gB, gD, gH, and gL are involved in the entry of HSV-1, and mutant viruses that lack one of these four glycoproteins cannot infect cells (Spear, 2004Spear P.G. Herpes simplex virus: receptors and ligands for cell entry.Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). gD interacts with herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), Nectin-1, and specific sites on heparan sulfate generated by certain 3-O-sulfotransferases (Montgomery et al., 1996Montgomery R.I.

Because gD is an essential glycoprotein for HSV-1 to infect a cell, interactions between gD and these cellular receptors play an important role in HSV-1 entry into cells (Spear et al., 2000Spear P.G. Eisenberg R.J. Cohen G.H. Three classes of cell surface receptors for alphaherpesvirus entry.Virology. 2000; 275: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Although gD itself is probably not a membrane fusogen, binding of gD with cellular receptors induces membrane fusion mediated by the gH/gL heterodimer and gB (Krummenacher et al., 2005Krummenacher C. Supekar V.M. Whitbeck J.C. Lazear E. Connolly S.A. Eisenberg R.J. Cohen G.H. Wiley D.C. Carfi A.

Both gB and gH have been reported to play an essential role in membrane fusion during HSV-1 infection (Cai et al., 1988Cai W.H. Gu B. Person S.

Although neither gB nor gH/gL has an obvious hydrophobic fusion peptide sequence, recent analyses suggested that gB and gH possess putative fusion peptides that may be involved in membrane fusion during HSV-1 infection (Gianni et al., 2005Gianni T. Martelli P.L. Casadio R. Campadelli-Fiume G.

Crystal structure of glycoprotein B from herpes simplex virus 1.Science. 2006; 313: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). On the other hand, gB has been suggested to associate with cell-surface heparan sulfate (Herold et al., 1994Herold B.C. Visalli R.J. Susmarski N. Brandt C.R. Spear P.G. Glycoprotein C-independent binding of herpes simplex virus to cells requires cell surface heparan sulphate and glycoprotein B.J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 1211-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar); however, cells deficient in heparan sulfate synthesis are still permissive to HSV-1 infection (Banfield et al., 1995Banfield B.W. Leduc Y. Esford L. Schubert K. Tufaro F. Sequential isolation of proteoglycan synthesis mutants by using herpes simplex virus as a selective agent: evidence for a proteoglycan-independent virus entry pathway.J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3290-3298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mutant HSV-1, from which the polylysine sequence in gB that is responsible for heparan sulfate binding is deleted, is still infectious (Laquerre et al., 1998Laquerre S. Argnani R. Anderson D.B. Zucchini S. Manservigi R. Glorioso J.C. Heparan sulfate proteoglycan binding by herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoproteins B and C, which differ in their contributions to virus attachment, penetration, and cell-to-cell spread.J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6119-6130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that a soluble form of gB binds to heparan sulfate-deficient cells and blocks HSV-1 infection of some cell lines (Bender et al., 2005Bender F.C. Whitbeck J.C. Lou H. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. Herpes simplex virus glycoprotein B binds to cell surfaces independently of heparan sulfate and blocks virus entry.J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11588-11597Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that molecules other than heparan sulfate mediate HSV-1 infection by associating with gB. It has been reported that gC also binds to heparan sulfate and is involved in the binding of HSV-1 to the cell surface, although gC-deficient virus is still infectious (Herold et al., 1991Herold B.C. WuDunn D. Soltys N. Spear P.G. Glycoprotein C of herpes simplex virus type 1 plays a principal role in the adsorption of virus to cells and in infectivity.J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, binding of gC to heparan sulfate is not essential for viral entry, similar to the binding of gB to heparan sulfate (Herold et al., 1994Herold B.C. Visalli R.J. Susmarski N. Brandt C.R. Spear P.G. Glycoprotein C-independent binding of herpes simplex virus to cells requires cell surface heparan sulphate and glycoprotein B.J. Gen.

In some cases, highly related receptors have evolved where one receptor in the family has inhibitory functions, whereas another receptor in the family mediates activating functions. Paired immunoglobulin like-type 2 receptor (PILR) is one of these “paired” receptor families (Fournier et al., 2000Fournier N. Chalus L. Durand I. Garcia E. Pin J.J. Churakova T. Patel S. Zlot C.

Med. 2004; 199: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The inhibitory PILRα has an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain and delivers inhibitory signals (Fournier et al., 2000Fournier N. Chalus L. Durand I. Garcia E. Pin J.J. Churakova T. Patel S. Zlot C. Gorman D. Zurawski S. et al.FDF03, a novel inhibitory receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is expressed by human dendritic and myeloid cells.J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). By contrast, the activating PILRβ associates with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-bearing DAP12 adaptor molecule and delivers activating signals (Shiratori et al., 2004Shiratori I. Ogasawara K. Saito T. Lanier L.L. Arase H. Activation of natural killer cells and dendritic cells upon recognition of a novel CD99-like ligand by paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor.J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because most mammals possess PILR genes, PILR likely plays an important role in the regulation of immune cells (Wilson et al., 2006Wilson M.D. Cheung J. Martindale D.W. Scherer S.W. Koop B.F. Comparative analysis of the paired immunoglobulin-like receptor (PILR) locus in six Mamm. Genomes: duplication, conversion, and the birth of new genes.Physiol. Genomics. 2006; 27: 201-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that the mouse inhibitory PILRα and activating PILRβ specifically recognize mouse CD99, and these receptors are involved in the regulation of immune responses (Shiratori et al., 2004Shiratori I. Ogasawara K. Saito T. Lanier L.L. Arase H. Activation of natural killer cells and dendritic cells upon recognition of a novel CD99-like ligand by paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor.J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Here, we found that HSV-1-infected cells express a ligand for inhibitory PILRα and that gB of HSV-1 is a ligand for PILRα. Furthermore, we determined that interactions between gB and PILRα mediate HSV-1 infection. Analyses using PILRα-transfectants, HSV-1 mutants, and primary cells expressing both HVEM and PILR indicated that cellular receptors for both gB and gD are required for HSV-1 infection. When we analyzed HSV-1-infected cells for ligands that bind human PILRα, we found that HSV-1-infected human 293T cells were specifically stained with human PILRα-Ig fusion protein (Figure 1A). PILRα-Ig bound equally to cells infected with several HSV-1 strains. Similarly, NIH 3T3 cells or Vero cells infected with HSV-1 were also recognized by human PILRα-Ig fusion protein (data not shown). This suggested that HSV-1 encodes a ligand for PILRα or that HSV-1 induces a cellular ligand for PILRα in infected cells. In order to identify the ligand for human PILRα present on HSV-1-infected cells, infected cells were lysed and the ligand for PILRα was immunoprecipitated with PILRα-Ig, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. PILRα-Ig, but not control Ig, specifically precipitated 110 kDa molecules from HSV-1-infected cells (Figure 1B). We extracted the 110 kDa protein and then analyzed the protein by using LC/MS/MS mass spectrometry. Surprisingly, 29 peptide sequences that were identical to gB were obtained by the analysis (Figure S1). In addition, 2 peptide sequences that were identical to gH were also identified. This suggested that the ligand detected on HSV-1-infected cells is likely to be gB and not a cellular ligand induced by HSV-1 infection. In order to confirm that the ligand for PILRα is gB, lysates of HSV-1-infected cells were immunoprecipitated with PILRα-Ig, followed by western blot analysis. The 110 kDa protein precipitated from HSV-1-infected cells by PILRα-Ig was confirmed to react with an anti-gB mAb but not anti-gD mAb (Figure 1C). On the other hand, Nectin1-Ig clearly precipitated gD, as well as small amounts of gB. Control Ig did not precipitate either gB or gD. This indicated that the 110 kDa protein precipitated by PILRα-Ig is mainly gB. Next, we analyzed the specificity of binding of PILRα to gB. 293T cells transfected with a full-length gB cDNA did not express significant amounts of gB on the cell surface (data not shown). Therefore, we generated a mutant gB that lacks the C-terminal 40 amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail (gBΔC), because the cytoplasmic domain of gB contains an intracellular retention signal that impairs cell-surface expression of wild-type gB (Beitia Ortiz de Zarate et al., 2004Beitia Ortiz de Zarate I. Kaelin K. Rozenberg F. Effects of mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoprotein B on intracellular transport and infectivity.J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1540-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Unlike wild-type gB, gBΔC was expressed well on the cell surface of 293T cells upon transient transfection. We cotransfected gBΔC, gD, or gH and gL together with GFP into 293T cells and analyzed binding of PILRα-Ig and Nectin-1-Ig to GFP-positive transfectants by flow cytometry (Figure 2A). Cell-surface expression of these glycoproteins was confirmed by staining with mAbs against these glycoproteins. PILRα-Ig clearly bound cells transfected with gBΔC but not gD or gH and gL. Mouse PILRα-Ig also recognized cells transfected with gBΔC, but not with gD or gH and gL (data not shown). On the other hand, Nectin-1-Ig fusion protein bound cells expressing gD, but not gB or gH and gL. These data indicated that PILRα specifically binds to gB, but not gD or gH and gL. To further confirm the specificity of the binding of PILRα to gB, we analyzed cells infected with gB-deficient HSV-1. Because gB-deficient virus does not infect cells, gB-deficient virus that possesses gB protein on the virion was produced by using gB-transfected complementing cells (Cai et al., 1988Cai W.H. Gu B. Person S. Role of glycoprotein B of herpes simplex virus type 1 in viral entry and cell fusion.J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2596-2604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the data presented in Figure 1, cells infected with wild-type HSV-1 were stained with anti-gB and anti-gD mAb, as well as PILRα-Ig (Figure 2B). Cells infected with gB-deficient HSV-1 were stained with anti-gD mAb, but not with anti-gB mAb or PILRα-Ig fusion protein. Cells infected with a revertant virus that expresses wild-type gB were recognized by both anti-gB mAb and PILRα-Ig fusion protein. These data indicated that PILRα specifically recognizes gB and suggest that the small amounts of gH detected by mass spectrometry analysis were likely a result of coprecipitation with gB. gB is a viral protein conserved in all herpesviruses and plays an important role in HSV-1 infection (Cai et al., 1988Cai W.H.

HSV-1 that lacks gB cannot infect cells (Cai et al., 1988Cai W.H. Gu B. Person S. Role of glycoprotein B of herpes simplex virus type 1 in viral entry and cell fusion.J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2596-2604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although receptors for gB have been suggested to be expressed on the cell surface (Bender et al., 2005Bender F.C. Whitbeck J.C. Lou H. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. Herpes simplex virus glycoprotein B binds to cell surfaces independently of heparan sulfate and blocks virus entry.J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11588-11597Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), specific receptors that associate with gB and mediate HSV-1 infection have not been identified. We analyzed whether the interaction between gB and PILRα is involved in HSV-1 infection. Because CHO-K1 cells express an unknown endogenous cellular ligand for PILRα, we isolated PILRα-ligand-negative CHO-K1 cells by flow cytometry and transfected human PILRα into these PILRα-ligand-negative CHO-K1 cells in order to avoid potential interactions between human PILRα and the endogenous hamster PILRα ligand. When the PILRα-ligand-negative CHO-K1 cells were transfected with human PILRα, these cells were effectively infected by HSV-1 expressing a GFP marker, whereas mock-transfected CHO-K1 cells were not infected by GFP-HSV-1 (Figures 3A and 3B). Similar results were obtained when HSV-1 infection was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 3C). These data indicated that human PILRα is involved in HSV-1 infection by associating with gB. We addressed whether a direct interaction between human PILRα and gB is involved in HSV-1 infection. For this purpose, we generated a mAb that specifically blocks the interaction between human PILRα and gB. We identified an anti-PILRα mAb (M4) that completely blocked the binding of PILRα-Ig to gB-transfected cells. As shown in Figure S2A, anti-PILRα mAb M4 specifically recognized mouse Ba/F3 cells transfected with human PILRα but not parental Ba/F3 cells. Anti-PILRα mAb M4 did not bind to HVEM- or Nectin-expressing cells (data not shown). Furthermore, when human PILRα-Ig fusion protein was preincubated with the anti-PILRα M4 mAb, the PILRα-Ig fusion protein did not bind the cells transfected with the gBΔC (Figure S2B). This indicated that the anti-PILRα M4 mAb completely blocks the interaction between human PILRα and gB. We analyzed whether the anti-PILRα mAb blocks HSV-1 infection of PILRα-transfected cells. When human PILRα transfectants were infected with HSV-1 in the presence of anti-PILRα mAb, infection was completely blocked by the anti-human PILRα mAb in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4A). By contrast, an isotype-matched mAb did not affect HSV-1 infection of PILRα transfectants. In addition, other anti-PILRα mAbs that did not block the binding of PILRα to gB also did not block HSV-1 infection of PILRα transfectants (data not shown). Because PILRα-Ig directly binds to gB of HSV-1, soluble PILRα-Ig fusion protein might block the interaction between gB and human PILRα. To test this possibility, we analyzed HSV-1 infection of PILRα-expressing cells in the presence or absence of the human PILRα-Ig fusion protein. As shown in Figure 4B, HSV-1 infection of human PILRα-transfected CHO-K1 cells was significantly blocked by PILRα-Ig fusion protein, but not by a control Ig fusion protein. These data indicated that a direct interaction between PILRα and gB mediates HSV-1 infection. gD, as well as gB, is an essential viral protein for HSV-1 infection because gD-deficient HSV-1 is noninfectious (Ligas and Johnson, 1988Ligas M.W. Johnson D.C. A herpes simplex virus mutant in which glycoprotein D sequences are replaced by β-galactosidase sequences binds to but is unable to penetrate into cells.J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1486-1494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We addressed whether gD is involved in PILRα-mediated HSV-1 infection. PILRα-transfected CHO cells were infected with a gD-deficient virus produced by normal Vero cells (gD (−)-HSV) or gD-expressing complementing Vero cells (gD (+)-HSV). gD itself has been reported to be dispensable for the production of HSV-1 virions (Ligas and Johnson, 1988Ligas M.W. Johnson D.C. A herpes simplex virus mutant in which glycoprotein D sequences are replaced by β-galactosidase sequences binds to but is unable to penetrate into cells.J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1486-1494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, equal amounts of gB were detected in these viruses by western blot analysis, suggesting that the amounts of virions were similar (Figure S3). When PILRα-transfected CHO cells were inoculated with these gD-deficient HSV-1, gD (+)-HSV was able to infect the PILRα-transfected CHO cells but not gD (−)-HSV, at least not to any significant extent (Figure 5A). This indicated that gD is required for PILRα-mediated HSV-1-infection. We then addressed whether binding of gD to certain cellular receptors are required for HSV-1 infection of PILRα-transfected CHO cells. We generated a gD-Ig fusion protein and tested the ability of this fusion protein to block HSV-1 infection of PILRα-transfected CHO. As shown in Figure 5B, HSV-1 infection of PILRα-transfected CHO cells was inhibited by the gD-Ig fusion protein in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5B). These data suggested that association of gD with certain cell surface molecules is required for PILRα-mediated HSV1 infection. In order to further examine the mechanism of PILRα-mediated HSV-1 infection, we employed a cell-fusion assay. gB, gD, gH, and gL were cotransfected with GFP into CHO cells, and PILRα was cotransfected with RFP into CHO cells. Purified GFP- or RFP-positive cells were cocultured for 8 hr, and cell fusion was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. When CHO cells cotransfected with gB, gD, gH, and gL were cocultured with PILRα-transfected CHO cells, significant numbers of CHO cells expressing both GFP and RFP were observed (Figure 6). Furthermore, cells expressing both GFP and RFP were multinucleated. CHO cells cotransfected with gB, gD, gH, and gL did not show cell fusion with mock-transfected CHO cells. CHO cells transfected with gD, gH, and gL also did not show cell fusion with PILRα-transfected CHO cells. When CHO cells transfected with gB, gH, and gL were analyzed, most cells did not show cell fusion with PILRα-transfected CHO cells. However, a very low frequency of CHO cells transfected with gB, gH, and gL, but not gD, showed cell fusion with PILRα-transfected CHO cells (Figures 6 and S4). The size of fused CHO cells transfected with gB, gH, and gL were significantly smaller compared to CHO cells transfected with gB, gD, gH, and gL. Thus, the efficiency of cell fusion induced by CHO cells transfected with only gB, gH, and gL was much lower than that by CHO cells transfected with gB, gD, gH, and gL, just as viral entry in the absence of gD was also very much reduced in efficiency (Figure 5A). These data indicated that interactions between gB and PILRα are involved in membrane fusion during HSV-1 infection. gD-deficient virus infected PILRα-transfected cells very inefficiently, if at all, and minimal cell fusion was observed by interactions between gB and PILRα in the absence of gD. Therefore, interaction of gD with certain cellular molecules is required for optimal membrane fusion even in the presence of gB and PILRα. We addressed whether PILRα is involved in the infection of primary human cells. Previously, PILRα has been reported to be expressed mainly on monocytes, granulocytes, and dendritic cells (Fournier et al., 2000Fournier N. Chalus L. Durand I. Garcia E. Pin J.J. Churakova T. Patel S. Zlot C. Gorman D. Zurawski S. et al.FDF03, a novel inhibitory receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is expressed by human dendritic and myeloid cells.J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). When amounts of PILRα transcript in various human tissues were analyzed by quantative real-time RT-PCR, significant amounts of PILRα transcripts were detected not only in PBMC but also in various tissues including the nervous system (Figure S5A). In particular, brain and cerebellum expressed relatively high amounts of PILRα transcripts. Nucleic acid sequences of PCR products amplified from whole brain and cerebellum were identical to PILRα, and similar results were obtained by using different primer sets (data not shown). When tissue sections from several tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, various types of cells including neurons were stained with anti-PILRα mAb (Figure S5B). These data suggested that PILRα is broadly expressed in various tissues, and expression of PILRα is not limited to the myeloid lineage. When expression of PILRα, HVEM, and Nectin-1 on human PBMC was analyzed by flow cytometry, all of the CD14-positive monocyte population expressed both HVEM and PILRα, but not Nectin-1 (Figure 7A). On the other hand, a CD14-negative population, which predominantly consisted of lymphocytes, expressed HVEM, but not significant amounts of PILRα or Nectin-1. Expression levels of HVEM on the CD14-negative and -positive populations were similar. Therefore, we separated PBMC into CD14-positive and -negative populations and infected these cells with HSV-1 in the presence or absence of a neutralizing anti-PILRα mAb (Figure 7B). CD14-positive monocytes, which express both PILRα and HVEM, were susceptible to HSV-1 infection. In contrast, HSV-1 did not infect the CD14-negative population, although the CD14-negative population expresses HVEM at the same level as the CD14-positive monocytes. gD-Ig fusion protein bound CD14-negative population (Figure S6A), and binding of gD-Ig fusion protein to CD14-negative population was blocked by anti-HVEM Ab (Figure S6B). This suggested that HVEM expressed on the CD14-negative population is accessible to gD, although the CD14-negative population was resistant to HSV-1 infection. Furthermore, HSV-1 infection of monocytes, which express both PILRα and HVEM, was efficiently blocked by anti-human PILRα mAb, but not by a control mAb (Figure 7B). In addition, HSV-1 infection of monocytes was also efficiently blocked by antiserum against HVEM but not by control serum (Figure 7C). Similar to PILRα-transfected CHO cells, the gD-deficient virus did not infect monocytes (Figure 7D). These data demonstrated that interactions of both gB and gD with their specific cellular receptors are required for HSV-1 infection of primary cells and that PILR functions as a coreceptor for HSV-1 infection. This also indicated that cellular receptors for either gB or gD alone are not enough to mediate HSV-1 infection. Resistance of CD14-negative PBMC that express HVEM, but not PILRα, to HSV-1 infection also suggests that cellular receptors for gD alone are not sufficient to mediate HSV-1 infection. Here, we have shown that PILRα mediates HSV-1 infection by associating with gB. We have also demonstrated that anti-PILRα or anti-HVEM Ab blocks HSV-1 infection of monocytes, which constitutively express both PILRα and HVEM. Furthermore, we have found that cellular receptors for gD are required for HSV-1 infection of PILRα-expressing cells by use of gD-deficient HSV-1 and anti-HVEM serum. These data indicated that interactions of both gB and gD with specific cellular receptors are required for HSV-1 infection. These findings also established that cellular receptors for either gB or gD alone are not enough to mediate HSV-1 infection. Resistance of CD14-negative PBMC that express HVEM, but not PILRα, to HSV-1 infection also revealed that cellular receptors for gD alone are not sufficient to mediate HSV-1 infection of primary cells. Taken together, PILRα functions as an entry coreceptor for HSV-1 infection. CHO cells transfected with cellular receptors for gD, such as HVEM or Nectin-1, become susceptible to HSV-1 infection (Montgomery et al., 1996Montgomery R.I. Warner M.S. Lum B.J. Spear P.G.

However, the regulation and function of Glut1 during erythropoiesis are not known. Here, we report that glucose transport actually decreases during human erythropoiesis despite a >3-log increase in Glut1 transcripts. In contrast, Glut1-mediated transport of L-dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), an oxidized form of ascorbic acid (AA), is dramatically enhanced. We identified stomatin, an integral erythrocyte membrane protein, as regulating the switch from glucose to DHA transport. Notably though, we found that erythrocyte Glut1 and associated DHA uptake are unique traits of humans and the few other mammals that have lost the ability to synthesize AA from glucose. Accordingly, we show that mice, a species capable of synthesizing AA, express Glut4 but not Glut1 in mature erythrocytes. Thus, erythrocyte-specific coexpression of Glut1 with stomatin constitutes a compensatory mechanism in mammals that are unable to synthesize vitamin C.

Thus, erythrocyte-specific coexpression of Glut1 with stomatin constitutes a compensatory mechanism in mammals that are unable to synthesize vitamin C. Glucose provides a key supply of energy and carbon for all living organisms and its transport is a universally conserved property. Vertebrate glucose transporters belong to the Glut family of multimembrane-spanning facilitative transporters. The first identified protein of this family, Glut1, is a type 2 integral membrane protein composed of 12 transmembrane domains that delineate six extracellular loops (Mueckler et al., 1985Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Sequence and structure of a human glucose transporter.Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Fourteen Glut isoforms have now been identified in the human genome but Glut1 is the main functional transporter of glucose in most transformed cells as well as in various hematopoietic cell lineages (Mueckler, 1994Mueckler M. Facilitative glucose transporters.Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, Mueckler et al., 1985Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I.

The Glut1 transporter is also crucial for facilitating glucose transport in the brain; a haploinsufficiency of Glut1 results in infantile seizures, delayed development, and microcephaly (Seidner et al., 1998Seidner G. Alvarez M.G. Yeh J.I. O'Driscoll K.R. Klepper J. Stump T.S. Wang D. Spinner N.B. Birnbaum M.J. De Vivo D.C. GLUT-1 deficiency syndrome caused by haploinsufficiency of the blood-brain barrier hexose carrier.Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Glut1 also transports L-dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), an oxidized intermediate of ascorbic acid (AA) (Bianchi and Rose, 1986Bianchi J. Rose R.C. Glucose-independent transport of dehydroascorbic acid in human erythrocytes.Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1986; 181: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, Rumsey et al., 1997Rumsey S.C.

Mammalian facilitative hexose transporters mediate the transport of dehydroascorbic acid.Nature. 1993; 364: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). DHA entry via Glut family transporters was initially investigated because of the structural similarities between DHA and glucose. Once transported into the cell, DHA is immediately reduced to AA allowing a recycling of ascorbate (May, 1998May J.M. Ascorbate function and metabolism in the human erythrocyte.Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: d1-d10PubMed Google Scholar). The uptake of AA into cells is mediated by a distinct class of transporters; sodium-dependent vitamin C transporters (SVCT1 and SVCT2) whose expression profiles differ from those of Glut family members (Tsukaguchi et al., 1999Tsukaguchi H. Tokui T. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Chen X.Z. Wang Y. Brubaker R.F. Hediger M.A. A family of mammalian Na+-dependent L-ascorbic acid transporters.Nature. 1999; 399: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). AA is essential for maintaining plasma and tissue reductive capacity, removing superoxide via its own oxidation into DHA. Of all cell lineages, the human erythrocyte expresses the highest level of the Glut1 transporter, harboring greater than 200,000 molecules per cell. Moreover, in the context of the red cell membrane, Glut1 accounts for 10% of the total protein mass (Helgerson and Carruthers, 1987Helgerson A.L. Carruthers A. Equilibrium ligand binding to the human erythrocyte sugar transporter. Evidence for two sugar-binding sites per carrier.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5464-5475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Mueckler, 1994Mueckler M. Facilitative glucose transporters.Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Here, we show that in erythrocytes, Glut1 preferentially transports DHA rather than glucose. The switch from glucose to DHA transport is associated with an induction of stomatin, an integral erythrocyte membrane protein. Accordingly, in a patient with overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (OHSt), a rare genetic disorder of red cell membrane permeability wherein stomatin is only present at low levels, DHA transport is decreased by 50% while glucose uptake is significantly increased. Erythrocyte-specific Glut1 expression and DHA transport are specific traits of the few vitamin C-deficient mammalian species, encompassing only higher primates, guinea pigs and fruit bats. Indeed, adult mice erythrocytes do not harbor Glut1 and do not transport DHA. Rather, Glut4 is expressed on their RBC. Thus, the concomitant induction of Glut1 and stomatin during erythroid differentiation constitutes a compensatory mechanism in mammals that are unable to synthesize the essential AA metabolite. Erythropoietin (EPO)-stimulated erythropoiesis of human CD34+ progenitors resulted in the appearance of erythroid progenitors, as monitored by cell morphology. Markers used to assess the progression of erythropoiesis included glycophorin A (GPA) and the transferrin receptor CD71 (Figure 1A). Glut1 was not detected on immature progenitors but was induced on cells of the basophilic erythroblast stage, increasing further on more mature acidophilic erythroblasts (cells with light cytoplasm in upper panel, Figure 1A). Double staining for GPA and Glut1 showed that GPA expression preceded that of Glut1 but both markers then remained elevated throughout the differentiation process (Figure 1A, bottom panel). Glut1 expression was confirmed by western blot analysis using a Glut1 specific pAb, demonstrating that surface Glut1 expression was concordant with total protein levels (Figure 1B). Indeed, Glut1 was not detected on CD34+ cells expanded in the absence of EPO. The relative mobility of Glut1 increased during erythropoiesis, consistent with a loss of glycosylation as previously reported (Mueckler, 1994Mueckler M. Facilitative glucose transporters.Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). The “smear-like” pattern of Glut1 is specific for the erythroid process as a single sharp band was detected in Jurkat cells (Figure 1B). Moreover, Glut1 mRNA, present only at the limit of detection in immature progenitors, increased by 2-logs following 5 days of EPO-induced differentiation and increased by an additional log at day 12 (Figure 1C). Thus, Glut1 expression in differentiating erythroblasts is highly regulated at the mRNA level and its expression is characteristic of progenitors that have progressed through the basophilic erythroblast stage. Given the function of Glut1 as a sugar transporter (Mueckler et al., 1985Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Sequence and structure of a human glucose transporter.Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), we first assessed whether the observed increase in Glut1 on differentiating erythroblasts was associated with enhanced glucose transport. Glucose transport kinetics were monitored using the nonhydrolyzable 2-deoxy-D[1-3H]glucose (2-DG) analog. Deoxyglucose is trapped in erythrocytes following its phosphorylation to deoxyglucose-6-phosphate whereas the nonphosphorylated deoxyglucose can be imported as well as exported via Glut1. Transport and accumulation can therefore be discriminated by performing uptake assays for extremely short periods (Vera et al., 1995Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Velasquez F.V. Zhang R.H. Concha I.I. Golde D.W. Resolution of the facilitated transport of dehydroascorbic acid from its intracellular accumulation as ascorbic acid.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23706-23712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Importantly, during time points wherein uptake at RT was in the linear range, 15–60 s, 2-DG uptake was drastically reduced between day 0 and day 8 of erythroid differentiation (Figure 2A). Moreover, upon more extended analysis of 2-DG uptake between 1 and 1200 s, the slope of 2-DG transport was significantly decreased upon erythroid differentiation (Figure 2A). Indeed, glucose uptake decreased throughout the 12 day erythroid differentiation (Figure 2B). This result was surprising and prompted us to test the transport of the second Glut1 substrate, DHA (Bianchi and Rose, 1986Bianchi J. Rose R.C. Glucose-independent transport of dehydroascorbic acid in human erythrocytes.Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1986; 181: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, Rumsey et al., 1997Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. Glucose transporter isoforms GLUT1 and GLUT3 transport dehydroascorbic acid.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18982-18989Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, Vera et al., 1993Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Fischbarg J. Golde D.W. Mammalian facilitative hexose transporters mediate the transport of dehydroascorbic acid.Nature. 1993; 364: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Importantly, DHA uptake was enhanced during erythropoiesis, as assessed in transport assays performed between 15 and 60 s (Figure 2A). This increase was significant by day 8 and was verified in extended time course assays ranging from 1 to 1200 s (Figure 2A). Indeed, changes in DHA uptake were inversely proportional to glucose uptake (Figures 2A and 2B). To address the question of whether DHA uptake is competed by glucose during erythropoiesis, we measured the effect of cold glucose on the uptake of radiolabeled DHA during the erythroid differentiation period. Prior to addition of erythropoietin, cold glucose significantly inhibited DHA uptake, as expected for a competing ligand (Figure 2C). However, by day 8 of differentiation, a time point at which Glut1 had been upregulated on the vast majority of differentiating erythroblasts (Figure 1A), DHA uptake was not inhibited by the addition of a 10-fold higher concentration of glucose (Figure 2C). Moreover, the importance of a Glut transporter in the uptake of both glucose and DHA was demonstrated by a 70%–80% transport inhibition following treatment of progenitors with cytochalasin B (CytB), a molecule that abrogates Glut1 function by directly binding to its sugar export site (Hebert and Carruthers, 1992Hebert D.N. Carruthers A. Glucose transporter oligomeric structure determines transporter function. Reversible redox-dependent interconversions of tetrameric and dimeric GLUT1.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23829-23838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure S1 available online). Therefore, the presence of Glut1 on differentiating erythrocytes results in an increased DHA transport that is not sensitive to competition by physiological levels of extracellular glucose. Our results, showing a differential uptake of glucose and DHA, were initially difficult to reconcile with previous research in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cell lines indicating that DHA and glucose competitively bind Glut1 (Rumsey et al., 1997Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. Glucose transporter isoforms GLUT1 and GLUT3 transport dehydroascorbic acid.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18982-18989Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, Vera et al., 1993Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Fischbarg J. Golde D.W.

Velasquez F.V. Zhang R.H. Concha I.I. Golde D.W. Resolution of the facilitated transport of dehydroascorbic acid from its intracellular accumulation as ascorbic acid.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23706-23712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed whether glucose competitively inhibits DHA uptake in mature erythrocytes. As expected, cold glucose competitor inhibited the uptake of the radio-labeled glucose analog in RBC (Figure 2D and Figure S2). RBC uptake of the nonmetabolizable glucose analog, 3-O-methylglucose, was also inhibited by the addition of cold glucose, under conditions of uptake extending for more than 60 s (data not shown). Additionally, as anticipated from previously published studies (Rumsey et al., 1997Rumsey S.C. Kwon O. Xu G.W. Burant C.F. Simpson I. Levine M. Glucose transporter isoforms GLUT1 and GLUT3 transport dehydroascorbic acid.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18982-18989Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, Vera et al., 1995Vera J.C. Rivas C.I.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23706-23712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), cold glucose inhibited radio-labeled DHA uptake in nonerythroid cells. In striking contrast, cold glucose did not diminish DHA transport in RBC; uptake was actually higher than that detected in its absence (Figure 2D and Figure S2). The increased uptake of DHA in the presence of glucose is likely a reflection of an increased reduction of DHA to AA, as the latter form is sequestered (May et al., 2001May J.M. Qu Z. Morrow J.D. Mechanisms of ascorbic acid recycling in human erythrocytes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1528: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Notably though, our finding that cold glucose does not inhibit DHA accumulation in mature erythrocytes, even at short 15–60 s time points wherein transport is linear (Figure 2A), indicates that glucose is not an inhibitor of the DHA transport process in mature human erythrocytes. Because glucose did not compete with DHA for transport, we next assessed whether the transports of both these solutes in RBC were mediated by a Glut-type glucose transporter. In agreement with previous reports (Helgerson and Carruthers, 1987Helgerson A.L. Carruthers A. Equilibrium ligand binding to the human erythrocyte sugar transporter. Evidence for two sugar-binding sites per carrier.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5464-5475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Mueckler, 1994Mueckler M. Facilitative glucose transporters.Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar), CytB inhibited glucose as well as DHA transport in RBC by > 90%. This CytB effect was specific as neither glucose nor DHA transport was decreased by the related non-Glut binding molecule, cytochalasin D (Figure S3). Nonetheless, as CytB can interfere with glucose transport by other Gluts, these data left open a potential role for other Glut molecules in the differential glucose/DHA uptake described here. It was therefore important to study the expression, as well as changes in the expression profiles, of all glucose-transporting Gluts during erythropoiesis. To this end, we designed primers allowing amplification of the different Glut mRNAs and monitored the levels of their transcripts during ex-vivo erythropoiesis. As presented in Figure 3A, qRT-PCR analyses of Glut1–8 and 10–14 demonstrated Glut1 to be the only mRNA to be significantly upregulated following rEPO stimulation of CD34 progenitors. These data strongly suggest a specific role for Glut1 in the differential glucose/DHA transport that we observed during human erythropoiesis as well as in mature RBC. As shown above Glut1-mediated DHA uptake in human erythrocytes is distinctive in that it is not competed by glucose. Thus, either differences in Glut1 itself and/or differences in Glut1 partners account for the specific inability of glucose to inhibit DHA uptake in erythrocytes. Notably, the N-glycosylation modification of Glut1 at Asn45 has been shown to be distinctive of erythrocytes (Mueckler, 1994Mueckler M. Facilitative glucose transporters.Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, mutation of this site did not alter either glucose or DHA transport. Moreover, mutation of a second site, Q161, known to negatively affect glucose uptake, similarly inhibited DHA uptake (Figure S4). In RBC, the only Glut1 partner that has been identified is stomatin (Zhang et al., 1999Zhang J.Z. Hayashi H. Ebina Y. Prohaska R. Ismail-Beigi F. Association of stomatin (band 7.2b) with Glut1 glucose transporter.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The latter protein is expressed at high levels with a reported 105 molecules per erythrocyte. The regulation of stomatin expression during hematopoiesis has not been extensively studied but it has been reported that CD34-differentiated erythroid progenitors become stomatin-immunopositive (Fricke et al., 2005Fricke B. Parsons S.F. Knopfle G. von During M. Stewart G.W. Stomatin is mis-trafficked in the erythrocytes of overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis, and is absent from normal primitive yolk sac-derived erythrocytes.Br. J. Haematol. 2005; 131: 265-277PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we determined that stomatin transcripts, present at only extremely low levels in nondifferentiated progenitors, increased by 10-fold following 5 days of EPO-induced erythropoiesis, a time point at which basophilic erythroblasts were detected. Upon a further 7 days of differentiation, stomatin transcripts were augmented by a 100-fold and stomatin protein, not detected in primitive progenitors, was upregulated upon erythroid differentiation (Figure 3B). These data show that stomatin expression is induced under conditions wherein DHA uptake increases and becomes insensitive to glucose competition. In this regard, it is notable that the association of Glut1 with stomatin has been reported to decrease Glut1-mediated glucose uptake by 30%–70%, at least in some cell types (Kumar et al., 2004Kumar A. Xiao Y.P. Laipis P.J. Fletcher B.S. Frost S.C. Glucose deprivation enhances targeting of GLUT1 to lipid rafts in 3T3–L1 adipocytes.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 286: E568-E576Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2001Zhang J.Z. Abbud W. Prohaska R. Ismail-Beigi F. Overexpression of stomatin depresses GLUT-1 glucose transporter activity.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C1277-C1283PubMed Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to determine whether, in contrast to its role in glucose uptake, stomatin may function to enhance Glut1-mediated DHA uptake. To this end, stomatin was introduced into A431 cells, a human cell line expressing only low levels of stomatin. As shown in Figure 4A, introduction of stomatin did not significantly alter cell surface or total Glut1 levels. Indeed, no correlation between stomatin and Glut1 levels was detected in nonerythroid cells (data not shown). Notably though, Glut1 associated with stomatin in transfected cells as demonstrated by their coimmunoprecipitation (Figure S5). Transport of both 2-DG and DHA into A431 cells were linear at time points ranging from 15 to 300 s (Figure S6). We therefore assessed concomitant glucose and DHA uptake at 30 and 300 s and determined that stomatin expression effectively decreases glucose transport to 70%–80% of control levels while enhancing DHA transport by 130%–200% (Figure 4A and data not shown). These data indicate a role for stomatin in the relative efficacy of DHA and glucose transport. To verify that the role of stomatin in DHA transport was mediated by Glut1, siRNAs directed against the Glut1 3′UTR were transfected into A431-stomatin cells. This resulted in a 50%–70% decrease in both total and cell surface Glut1 expression without modulating stomatin expression (Figure 4B). To test whether DHA and glucose transport were similarly affected by Glut1 silencing in the presence of stomatin, uptake assays were performed at 30 and 300 s. Indeed, both DHA and glucose transport were similarly decreased in siRNA-treated A431-stomatin cells, by means of 67% for 2-DG and 64% for DHA in a representative experiment (Figure 4B and data not shown). Thus, the effects of stomatin on DHA and glucose transport in these A431-transfected cell are mediated via Glut1. Stomatin expression is diminished in erythrocytes from patients with OHSt. In this rare genetic disorder of red blood cell membrane permeability, the dramatically reduced stomatin expression is an indirect consequence of a mutation that has not yet been identified (Delaunay, 2004Delaunay J. The hereditary stomatocytoses: genetic disorders of the red cell membrane permeability to monovalent cations.Semin. Hematol. 2004; 41: 165-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We found that surface and total Glut1 levels were equivalent on control and RBC from two different OHSt patients (Figure 4C). As previously reported, the reduction in stomatin expression between OHSt patients is variable, as seen in Figure 4C. Notably, glucose and DHA transport in these RBC was consistent with that observed in the stomatin-overexpressing cell line: At 10 min, glucose uptake was significantly higher in the OHSt RBC as compared to control RBC while there was a concomitant 40% reduction in DHA transport (Figure 4C). Moreover, under the same conditions, DHA uptake was also lower in OHSt RBC from a second patient as compared to an RBC sample with equivalent reticulocyte counts (sickle cell anemia; data not shown). Altogether, these observations demonstrate that stomatin inversely regulates the relative transports of glucose and DHA by Glut1. Sugar transport in RBC has been shown to be significantly higher in humans than in other species, and this is assumed to be due to a higher Glut1 density on human RBC (Lowe and Walmsley, 1986Lowe A.G. Walmsley A.R. The kinetics of glucose transport in human red blood cells.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 857: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, Glut1 was not detected in RBC from mice over 25 days of age even though expression was readily detectable in newborn murine erythrocytes (Figure 5A). As this result was very surprising, it was important to determine whether the loss of detectable Glut1 protein was due to changes in Glut1 transcription. To this end, Ter119+ splenic erythroid precursors were purified and Glut1 transcripts monitored by qRT-PCR. Glut1 mRNA levels decreased by more than 10-fold between day 2 and day 5 of life and were not detectable in adult progenitors (Figure 5B). Thus, in disparity with human erythrocytes, Glut1 is lost on murine RBC during postnatal development and this decrease is regulated at the transcriptional level. The data presented above raised the question as to the identity of the transporter responsible for glucose transport in adult murine RBC. We determined that glucose uptake in adult murine RBC is mediated via a Glut-type transporter as it was effectively abrogated by the specific inhibitor CytB but not by the related CytD molecule (Figure 5C). DHA uptake, on the other hand, was present only at the limits of detection in murine RBC and was not affected by CytB (Figure 5C). Glucose, but not DHA, transport is therefore mediated by a Glut-facilitated process in murine RBC. To determine which Glut molecule is expressed in murine erythrocytes, Ter119+ splenic precursors were purified and primers were designed to amplify distinct Glut molecules. Neither Glut2, 3, nor 5 mRNAs were detected by qRT-PCR, performed using validated primer pairs (data not shown). In contrast, Glut4 mRNA was readily detected and increased during the postnatal period (Figure 6A). We therefore compared Glut1 and Glut4 protein expression in peripheral RBC isolated from mice of different ages. Importantly, as described above, Glut1 expression in peripheral RBC decreased significantly following birth and was undetectable by 25 days of age (Figure 6B). In marked contrast, Glut4 was detected in RBC at all ages, albeit at significantly lower levels in adult as compared to neonatal mice (Figure 6B). Given the high levels of Glut4 mRNA in splenic Ter119+ precursors, it was somewhat surprising to detect lower protein levels in peripheral RBC. However, this correlated with an RBC glucose uptake that decreased with age (Figure 6C). Notably though, uptake remained CytB-sensitive (Figure 5C), in agreement with a transport mediated by Glut4. Significantly, Glut4 protein was not detected in human RBC, whether neonatal or adult (data not shown). Altogether these data demonstrate the presence of a second glucose transporter in murine RBC. The marked disparity in Glut1 expression and DHA uptake between murine and human erythrocytes raised the following question: What is the nature of the selective pressure maintaining Glut1 expression and DHA uptake in humans? We hypothesized that DHA uptake by human erythrocytes could be linked to the inability of humans to synthesize the reduced form of DHA, AA, from glucose. Of the >4000 species of mammals, it appears that only man, other higher primates, guinea pigs and fruit bats are unable to synthesize AA from glucose. Importantly, we detected Glut1 expression on human, guinea pig and fruit bat erythrocytes but not on any other mammalian RBC tested including rabbit, rat, cat, dog and chinchilla (Figure 7A). Notably, the eGFP-tagged HTLVRBD fusion protein binds Glut1 from all mammalian species tested and is specifically increased/decreased by Glut1 overexpression and siRNA transfection, respectively (Figure S7; Kinet et al., 2007Kinet S. Swainson L. Lavanya M. Mongellaz C. Montel-Hagen A. Craveiro M. Manel N. Battini J.L. Sitbon M. Taylor N.

The Ubiquitous Glucose Transporter GLUT-1 Is a Receptor for HTLV.Cell. 2003; 115: 449-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Glut1 expression was specifically associated with DHA uptake; glucose transport was equivalently efficient in murine and guinea pig RBC whereas DHA was only efficiently transported by the latter (Figure 7B). As the chinchilla is phylogenetically closer to the guinea pig (Hystricognathi suborder of the Rodentia order) than the guinea pig is to man, the common profile of the latter two species is compatible with a selection for erythrocyte Glut1 in mammals with defective AA synthesis. The relationship between erythrocyte Glut1 expression and loss of AA synthesis potential was further studied in primates. Primates belonging to the Haplorrhini suborder (including prosimian tarsiers, new world monkeys, old world monkeys, humans and apes) have lost the ability to synthesize AA whereas primates in the Strepsirrhini suborder (including lemurs) are reportedly able to produce this vitamin (Nakajima et al., 1969Nakajima Y.

Notably, Glut1 was detected on all tested erythrocytes of primates within the Haplorrhini suborder, including long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis), rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulata), baboons (Papio anubis) and magot monkeys (Macaca sylvanus) (Figure 7C).

https://openalex.org/W2158168507,"Transcription analyses reported in these studies reveal that convergent genes in S. pombe generate overlapping transcripts in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. We show that this double-strand (ds) RNA induces localized RNAi (Dicer and RITS) dependent transient heterochromatin structures including histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation marks and Swi6 association. Consequently cohesin is recruited to these chromosomal positions through interaction with Swi6. In G2, localized cohesin is further concentrated into the intergenic regions of the convergent genes tested. This results in a block to further dsRNA formation by promoting gene-proximal transcription termination between the convergent genes. Cohesin release at mitosis leads to a new G1 phase with repeated dsRNA formation, transient heterochromatin, and cohesin recruitment. Our results uncover a hitherto unanticipated role for cohesin and further suggest a widespread role for the selective formation of dsRNA, heterochromatin, and subsequent cohesin recruitment in regulated transcriptional termination."

https://openalex.org/W2146925966,"Transcription termination by bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) occurs at sequences coding for a GC-rich RNA hairpin followed by a U-rich tract. We used single-molecule techniques to investigate the mechanism by which three representative terminators (his, t500, and tR2) destabilize the elongation complex (EC). For his and tR2 terminators, loads exerted to bias translocation did not affect termination efficiency (TE). However, the force-dependent kinetics of release and the force-dependent TE of a mutant imply a forward translocation mechanism for the t500 terminator. Tension on isolated U-tracts induced transcript release in a manner consistent with RNA:DNA hybrid shearing. We deduce that different mechanisms, involving hypertranslocation or shearing, operate at terminators with different U-tracts. Tension applied to RNA at terminators suggests that closure of the final 2-3 hairpin bases destabilizes the hybrid and that competing RNA structures modulate TE. We propose a quantitative, energetic model that predicts the behavior for these terminators and mutant variants."

The impact of these flood basalt eruptions on the global atmosphere and the coeval end-Cretaceous mass extinction has been uncertain. To assess the potential gas release from this volcanism, we measured sulfur and chlorine concentrations in rare glass inclusions inside crystals and on glassy selvages preserved within lavas. Concentrations range from ∼1400 parts per million of S and 900 parts per million of Cl in inclusions down to a few hundred parts per million in the lava. These data indicate that eruptions of Deccan lavas could have released at most 0.103 weight % of S, yielding up to 5.4 teragrams of SO 2 per cubic kilometer of lava. A more conservative estimate is 0.07 weight % of S and 0.04 weight % of Cl, yielding 3.5 teragrams of SO 2 and 1 teragram of HCl for every cubic kilometer of lava erupted. The flows were very large in volume, and these results imply that huge amounts of S and Cl gases were released.

https://openalex.org/W1995126002,"Obesity increases the risk for metabolic and cardiovascular disease, and adipose tissue plays a central role in this process. Ceramide, the key intermediate of sphingolipid metabolism, also contributes to obesity-related disorders. We show that a high fat diet increased ceramide levels in the adipose tissues and plasma in C57BL/6J mice via a mechanism that involves an increase in gene expression of enzymes mediating ceramide generation through the de novo pathway (e.g. serine palmitoyltransferase) and via the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (acid sphingomyelinase and neutral sphingomyelinase). Although the induction of total ceramide in response to the high fat diet was modest, dramatic increases were observed for C16, C18, and C18:1 ceramides. Next, we investigated the relationship of ceramide to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the primary inhibitor of plasminogen activation and another key player in obesity. PAI-1 is consistently elevated in obesity and thought to contribute to increased artherothrombotic events and more recently to obesity-mediated insulin resistance. Interestingly, the changes in ceramide were attenuated in mice lacking PAI-1. Mechanistically, mice lacking PAI-1 were protected from diet-induced increase in serine palmitoyltransferase, acid sphingomyelinase, and neutral sphingomyelinase mRNA, providing a mechanistic link for decreased ceramide in PAI-1-/- mice. The decreases in plasma free fatty acids and adipose tumor necrosis factor-alpha in PAI-1-/- mice may have additionally contributed indirectly to improvements in ceramide profile in these mice. This study has identified a novel link between sphingolipid metabolism and PAI-1 and also suggests that ceramide may be an intermediary molecule linking elevated PAI-1 to insulin resistance."

We have previously shown that export of Pex5p is preceded by (and requires) monoubiquitination of a conserved cysteine residue present at its N terminus.

Peroxisomal matrix proteins are synthesized in cytosolic ribosomes and post-translationally targeted to the peroxisome. Correct targeting of these proteins to the organelle requires an intricate machinery comprising more than 10 different peroxins (1Baker A. Sparkes I.A. Curr. Opin.

In mammals and plants but not in yeasts/fungi, Pex5p is also in charge of targeting PTS2-containing proteins to the organelle matrix (4Schliebs W. Kunau W.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this case, however, the Pex5p-PTS2 interaction is not direct but rather bridged by Pex7p, the so-called PTS2 receptor (5Lazarow P.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 1599-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). According to current models, after binding cargo proteins in the cytosol, Pex5p interacts with the peroxisomal docking/translocation machinery, a multisubunit protein complex comprising mostly transmembrane proteins (1Baker A.

The interaction of the Pex5p·cargo protein complex with this machinery ultimately results in the partial insertion of Pex5p into the peroxisomal membrane with the concomitant translocation of cargo proteins into the matrix of the organelle (9Azevedo J.E.

Biol. 2005; 6: 738-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this step is ATP-independent, suggesting that the driving force for protein translocation derives from the strong protein-protein interactions that Pex5p establishes with some components of the docking/translocation apparatus (11Miyata N.

It is instead exported in an ATP-dependent way back into the cytosol to promote further rounds of protein transportation (11Miyata N. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell.

For some time, it was assumed that this energy-requiring process comprised only one step: the dislocation of Pex5p from the docking/translocation complex by the mechanoenzymes Pex1p and Pex6p, two members of the ATPases associated with various cellular activities (AAA) family of proteins (11Miyata N.

Although thiol ester bonds are at the heart of the chemistry used by the enzymes of UCC, they are, at least apparently, quite uncommon in ubiquitin-substrate conjugates (17Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6819) Google Scholar). In fact, besides Pex5p, only one other protein, a major histocompatibility complex class I molecule, was reported to be ubiquitinated in this way (18Cadwell K. Coscoy L. Science. 2005; 309: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The UCC acting on yeast Pex5p during its normal and transient passage through the peroxisomal membrane is now fairly characterized (13Platta H.W. Grunau S. Rosenkranz K. Girzalsky W. Erdmann R. Nat.

After the ATP-dependent activation of ubiquitin catalyzed by UBA1, the only ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) present in yeast (23Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2894) Google Scholar), ubiquitin is transferred to Pex4p (UBC10) (24Wiebel F.F. Kunau W.-H. Nature. 1992; 359: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 25van der Klei I.J. Hilbrands R.E. Kiel J.A. Rasmussen S.W. Cregg J.M. Veenhuis M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3608-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) is a peripheral component of the peroxisomal membrane in yeasts and probably also in plants. In the absence of Pex22p, a peroxisomal intrinsic membrane protein, Pex4p is unstable, suggesting that the two proteins form a structural/functional unit (26Koller A. Snyder W.B. Faber K.N. Wenzel T.J. Rangell L. Keller G.A. Subramani S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 146: 99-112Google Scholar, 27Zolman B.K. Monroe-Augustus M. Silva I.D. Bartel B.

The identity of the ubiquitin ligase(s) (E3) acting at the terminal step of this cascade is still unknown. It seems likely, however, that this role is played by the RING peroxin(s) of the docking/translocation machinery, as supported by the observation that yeast Pex4p interacts with Pex10p (30Eckert J.H. Johnsson N. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3623-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Much less is known regarding the UCC acting on mammalian Pex5p. Actually, the only known facts about this issue are that Pex5p is ubiquitinated at the peroxisomal membrane after the ATP-independent membrane insertion step, that this ubiquitination is a prerequisite for its export, and that ubiquitinated Pex5p is exported into the cytosol in an ATPγS-sensitive process (14Carvalho A.F. Pinto M.P. Grou C.P. Alencastre I.S. Fransen M. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31267-31272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Several factors may explain this lack of knowledge. Perhaps the most important is related to the fact that the main approach that has been used to identify mammalian peroxins (i.e. homology searches using yeasts/fungi sequences as queries) has failed in this case. Indeed, no in silico evidence for a mammalian PEX22 gene could be found in several recent studies (31Kiel J.A. Veenhuis M. van der Klei I.J. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1291-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 32Schluter A. Fourcade S. Domenech-Estevez E. Gabaldon T. Huerta-Cepas J. Berthommier G. Ripp R. Wanders R.J. Poch O. Pujol A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For Pex4p, a different problem applies. Mammals have more than 30 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (reviewed in Ref. 33Fang S. Weissman A.M. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1546-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, none of these proteins seem to display a particularly close sequence relationship to the yeast/fungi/plants Pex4p (27Zolman B.K. Monroe-Augustus M. Silva I.D. Bartel B. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 3422-3435Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Proteomic studies aiming at defining the protein repertoire of mammalian peroxisomes have been of no help in this subject either (34Islinger M. Luers G.H. Li K.W. Loos M. Volkl A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23055-23069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 35Kikuchi M. Hatano N. Yokota S. Shimozawa N. Imanaka T. Taniguchi H. J. Biol.

Proteomics. 2007; 6: 2045-2057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). No evidence for a peroxisome-associated E2 was found, and none of the novel peroxisomal proteins identified in those studies displays even a remote relationship to the yeast/plant Pex22p. Clearly, other approaches are needed to address this problem. During the last years, we have been using an in vitro system to characterize the Pex5p-mediated import pathway in mammals. Two different versions of this in vitro system have been employed. In one version, a postnuclear supernatant (PNS) from rat liver is used as the source of peroxisomes and other required components. In this version, all the steps of the Pex5p-mediated import pathway can be monitored. These include 1) the cargo-dependent but ATP-independent insertion of Pex5p into the peroxisomal docking/translocation machinery (12Oliveira M.E. Gouveia A.M. Pinto R.A. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J.

In the other version, highly purified peroxisomes from rat liver are used in the in vitro reactions. Here, cargo-dependent but ATP-independent insertion of Pex5p into the docking/translocation machinery is still possible. However, because the system lacks the required amounts of ubiquitin and/or components of the UCC, transition of stage 2 Pex5p into stage 3 Pex5p is no longer possible, and the peroxin becomes arrested at the docking/translocation machinery (12Oliveira M.E.

In this work, we have explored the properties of this incomplete version to identify the rat liver ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme(s) mediating the peroxisomal ubiquitination of the conserved cysteine residue of Pex5p. Peroxisome Preparation—Isolation of highly pure peroxisomes from rat liver by differential centrifugation and Nycodenz gradient purification was performed as described (41Gouveia A.M. Reguenga C. Oliveira M.E. Eckerskorn C. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. The SIE buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA-NaOH, pH 7.4) was supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1:500 (v/v) mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The purified peroxisomes were carefully resuspended in SEM buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA-NaOH, pH 7.4) containing 2 μg/ml N-(trans-epoxysuccinyl)-l-leucine 4-guanidinobutylamide (E-64), frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –70 °C. Cytosol Preparation, Fractionation, and Purification of E2s—Livers from male rats fasted overnight were homogenized in 5 volumes of ice-cold 0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA-NaOH, pH 7.5, supplemented with 2 μg/ml E-64. A cytosolic fraction was obtained from this homogenate after the following sequential centrifugations: 10 min at 600 × g, 20 min at 12,300 × g, and 1 h at 100,000 × g. Cytosolic Fraction I and Fraction II were obtained according to Ciechanover et al. (42Ciechanover A. Elias S. Heller H. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2537-2542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Covalent affinity chromatography was performed according to Ref. 42Ciechanover A. Elias S. Heller H. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2537-2542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar with modifications. One hundred and fifty mg of cytosolic proteins (at 30 mg/ml) were subjected to precipitation with 16% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 (added from a 50% (w/v) stock solution in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) for 20 min on ice. The pellet obtained after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min was resuspended in 5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm DTT. The clarified sample was applied at a 0.1 ml/min flow rate to a 0.8-ml ubiquitin-agarose column (10 mg/ml; BIOMOL), previously equilibrated with 5 volumes of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm DTT). The column was washed at 0.5 ml/min as follows: 3 volumes of buffer A, 6 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 3 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m KCl. Elution was performed at 0.1 ml/min flow rate with 3 volumes of a high pH/DTT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 20 mm DTT). The eluate was immediately neutralized with a 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 33 μg/ml bovine serum albumin solution. The wash and elution fractions were subjected to three cycles of concentration/dilution with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, supplemented with 0.2 mm DTT, using Vivaspin 500 columns (3,000 molecular weight cut-off polyethersulfone; Vivascience), pretreated for 30 min at room temperature with 600 μl of 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin to minimize protein loss by adsorption. In the subsequent steps, only Eppendorf® protein LoBind microcentrifuge tubes were used. Concentrated eluates (100–150 μl) were incubated with 30 μl (bed volume) of DEAE-cellulose (DE52, Whatman) for 30 min at 18 °C. The beads were washed two times for 10 s with 100 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the bound proteins were eluted twice with 50 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m KCl, for 5 min. Throughout the entire purification procedure, aliquots of all fractions were withdrawn for SDS-PAGE analysis and in vitro import experiments to test for E2 activity. With the exception of the cytosolic fraction, which was kept frozen at –70 °C for 5–10 days, the entire procedure, activity assays included, was always performed in a single day.

In vitro import experiments containing 50 μg of purified peroxisomes were performed in import buffer comprising 0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 3 mm MgCl2, 20 μm methionine, 10 μm ZnCl2, and 2 μg/ml E-64. ATP or ATPγS was used at 5 mm final concentration. Where indicated, 25 μg of GST·ubiquitin (GST·Ub (45Ferro A. Carvalho A.L. Teixeira-Castro A. Almeida C. Tome R.J. Cortes L. Rodrigues A.J.

Where specified, the reactions were supplemented with 250 ng of recombinant human E1 and 10 ng of the relevant E2. The reactions were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, and the organelles were isolated by centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Protein Identification by Mass Spectrometry—Following staining with colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, gel bands of interest were cut out and destained by alternately incubating them with 20 μl of 10 mm NH4HCO3 and 20 μl of 5 mm NH4HCO3/50% acetonitrile (v/v) for 10 min each. In-gel digestion was performed overnight at 37 °C using trypsin dissolved in 10 mm NH4HCO3 buffer (pH 7.8). The resulting peptides were extracted twice with 10 μl of acetonitrile/5% formic acid (50:50, (v/v)). Subsequently, acetonitrile was removed in vacuo, and samples were acidified by the addition of 5% formic acid to a final volume of 20 μl. Online reversed-phase nano-HPLC separations were performed using the Dionex LC Packings HPLC systems (Dionex LC Packings, Idstein, Germany) as described (47Schaefer H. Chervet J.P. Bunse C. Joppich C. Meyer H.E. Marcus K. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 2541-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Peptides were separated on a C18 nano column (C18 PepMap; Dionex) using solvent A (0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 84% acetonitrile, (v/v)) to perform a binary linear gradient of 5–30% solvent B in 34 min. Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry was performed on a Bruker Daltonics HCT ultra ion trap instrument (Bremen, Germany) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (Bruker Daltonics) as described (36Wiese S.

Data base searches were performed with tryptic specificity, allowing two missed cleavages and oxidation of methionine. Proteins were assembled on the basis of peptide identifications using the ProteinExtractor tool (version 1.0) in ProteinScape (version 1.3 S.R. 2, Bruker Daltonics) as described (36Wiese S.

The presence of each protein isoform was confirmed by the identification of at least one unique peptide. Only protein identifications up to an accumulated false discovery rate of 0% are reported. Cell Culture—Human primary skin fibroblast were grown in a standard Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. The cells were grown at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Cells at 90% confluence were harvested with a cell scraper, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in SEM buffer supplemented with E-64. The sample was homogenized using a tight-fit glass-Teflon homogenizer, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of the PNS fraction were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –70 °C. Miscellaneous—The recombinant human E1 and E2s used in the in vitro import experiments were purchased from BIOMOL and were diluted in SEM buffer with 0.1% bovine serum albumin immediately before use.

https://openalex.org/W2036294565,"Filamentous inclusions composed of the microtubule-associated protein tau are found in Alzheimer disease and other tauopathic neurodegenerative diseases, but the mechanisms underlying their formation from full-length protein monomer under physiological conditions are unclear. To address this issue, the fibrillization of recombinant full-length four-repeat human tau was examined in vitro as a function of time and submicromolar tau concentrations using electron microscopy assay methods and a small-molecule inducer of aggregation, thiazine red. Data were then fit to a simple homogeneous nucleation model with rate constant constraints established from filament dissociation rate, critical concentration, and mass-per-unit length measurements. The model was then tested by comparing the predicted time-dependent evolution of length distributions to experimental data. Results indicated that once assembly-competent conformations were attained, the rate-limiting step in the fibrillization pathway was tau dimer formation. Filament elongation then proceeded by addition of tau monomers to nascent filament ends. Filaments isolated at reaction plateau contained approximately 2 tau protomers/beta-strand spacing on the basis of mass-per-unit length measurements. The model suggests four key steps in the aggregation pathway that must be surmounted for tau filaments to form in disease."
https://openalex.org/W1988816286,"The most abundant taxon of the Neoproterozoic soft-bodied biota near Ediacara, South Australia, occurs as clusters of similarly sized individuals, which suggests synchronous aggregate growth by spatfall. Tubes of Funisia dorothea gen. et sp. nov. were anchored within the shallow, sandy sea bed and lived in dense, typically monospecific concentrations. Tubes were composed of modular, serially repeating elements. Individuals grew by adding serial elements to the tubular body and by branching of tubes. Their construction and close-packed association imply likely affinity within the Porifera or Cnidaria. These data suggest that several of the most successful marine invertebrate ecological strategies known today were in place in Earth's oldest known metazoan ecosystems before the advent of skeletonization and widespread predation."

Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans serve as essential co-receptors in Slit-Robo signaling. Previous studies have shown that the second leucinerich repeat domain of Slit, D2, binds to the N-terminal immunoglobulin-like domains of Robo, IG1-2. Here we present two crystal structures of Drosophila Robo IG1-2, one of which contains a bound heparin-derived oligosaccharide. Using structure-based mutagenesis of a Robo IG1-5 construct we identified key Slit binding residues (Thr-74, Phe-114, Arg-117) forming a conserved patch on the surface of IG1; mutation of similarly conserved residues in IG2 had no effect on Slit binding. Mutation of conserved basic residues in IG1 (Lys-69, Arg-117, Lys-122, Lys-123), but not in IG2, reduced binding of Robo IG1-5 to heparin, in full agreement with the Robo-heparin co-crystal structure. Our collective results, together with a recent crystal structure of a minimal human Slit-Robo complex (Morlot, C., Thielens, N. M., Ravelli, R. B., Hemrika, W., Romijn, R. A., Gros, P., Cusack, S., and McCarthy, A. A. (2007) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 104, 14923–14928), reveal a contiguous HS/heparin binding surface extending across the Slit-Robo interface. Based on the size of this composite binding site, we predict that at least five HS disaccharide units are required to support Slit-Robo signaling. Recognition of the secreted protein Slit by transmembrane receptors of the Robo family provides important signals in the development of the nervous system and other organs, as well as in tumor metastasis and angiogenesis. Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans serve as essential co-receptors in Slit-Robo signaling.

Based on the size of this composite binding site, we predict that at least five HS disaccharide units are required to support Slit-Robo signaling. During development, growing axons navigate through the embryo by responding to a number of attractive and repulsive signals. The key ligand-receptor systems involved in axon guidance have been highly conserved during metazoan evolution (1Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S.

A molecular understanding of the Slit-Robo interactions is thus of great fundamental and biomedical interest.Slit proteins are characterized by an N-terminal tandem of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, D1-4. Their C-terminal regions consist of multiple epidermal growth factor-like domains, a laminin G-like domain, and a cystine knot domain. Robos have an extracellular domain resembling cell adhesion molecules (five immunoglobulin-like (IG) domains followed by three fibronectin type 3-like domains), a single transmembrane helix, and a large cytosolic domain predicted to be natively unstructured. Various cytosolic binding partners have been identified that link Robo activation to the cytoskeletal rearrangements underlying growth cone repulsion (3Dickson B.J. Gilestro G.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 651-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Previous structure-function studies by us and others (12Howitt J.A. Clout N.J. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4406-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 13Liu Z. Patel K. Schmidt H. Andrews W. Pini A. Sundaresan V. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 26: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) have shown that the Slit-Robo interaction is mediated by D2 of Slit and IG1-2 of Robo. These findings were very recently confirmed and much extended by a crystal structure of a Slit D2-Robo IG1 complex (14Morlot C. Thielens N.M. Ravelli R.B. Hemrika W. Romijn R.A. Gros P. Cusack S.

HS consists of repeating disaccharide units that are modified by variable epimerization and sulfation; the HS chains are attached to core proteins to form HS proteoglycans. Heparin is a highly sulfated form of HS (19Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 20Couchman J.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 926-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). We previously identified Slit residues involved in heparin binding and demonstrated that one important function of HS/heparin is to promote the formation of a ternary Slit-Robo-HS signaling complex (21Hussain S.A. Piper M. Fukuhara N. Strochlic L. Cho G. Howitt J.A. Ahmed Y. Powell A.K. Turnbull J.E. Holt C.E. Hohenester E. J. Biol.

Here, we report two crystal structures of Drosophila Robo IG1-2, one of which contains a bound heparin-derived oligosaccharide. Using structure-based mutagenesis, we have identified Robo residues involved in Slit and heparin binding. Combined with the recent structure of a human Slit2 D2-Robo1 IG1 complex (14Morlot C. Thielens N.M. Ravelli R.B. Hemrika W. Romijn R.A. Gros P. Cusack S. McCarthy A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 14923-14928Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), our results provide new insight into how HS/heparin strengthens the Slit-Robo interaction and thereby contributes to Slit-Robo signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression Vectors—Initial constructs were made by PCR amplification from complete cDNA clones of Drosophila Slit and Robo, kindly provided by Guy Tear (King's College, London, UK). The C-terminally His-tagged Robo IG1-2 construct has been described (21Hussain S.A. Piper M. Fukuhara N. Strochlic L. Cho G. Howitt J.A. Ahmed Y. Powell A.K. Turnbull J.E. Holt C.E. Hohenester E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39693-39698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Untagged Robo IG1-2 was constructed by PCR amplification from the tagged construct and ligation into the original pCEP-Pu vector (22Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), using the NheI and XhoI restriction sites. The forward and reverse primers were, respectively, 5′-CGGAATTCGCTAGCAGGCCAGTACCAATCGCCACGTATC and 5′-AGGATCCTCGAGTCATTTGACCTGGACAATCAGCTTGGCATAGCT. The expressed protein after cleavage of the BM-40 signal peptide has the sequence APLAGQYQS... IVQVK, with the first four residues derived from the vector. The Robo IG1-5 Fc construct has been described (21Hussain S.A. Piper M. Fukuhara N. Strochlic L. Cho G. Howitt J.A. Ahmed Y. Powell A.K. Turnbull J.E. Holt C.E. Hohenester E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39693-39698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Robo IG1-5 Fc mutants were made as follows. A fragment of the wild-type construct encompassing most of the IG1-2 region was mutated by strand overlap extension PCR and cloned back into the Robo IG1-5 Fc construct, using the NheI and BstBI restriction sites. The forward primer was as for Robo IG1-2, and the reverse primer was 5′-CGCGGATCCTTCGAACGCGGGAGCTGGCGCCAAACG. Specific mutagenic primers were used to introduce the desired mutations (primer sequence available on request). For the R57A/I59A/E60A mutant, the strand overlap extension method could not be used, because the sequence to be mutated is too close to the 5′ restriction site. Therefore, the mutagenic sequence was included in the forward primer 5′-CGGAATTCGCTAGCAGGCCAGTACCAATCGCCACGTGCCATCGCG and the mutated product amplified in a single PCR reaction. The SlitD1-4 construct expressed with an N-terminal His tag has been described (12Howitt J.A. Clout N.J. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4406-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The insert sequences of all expression vectors were verified by DNA sequencing.Protein Production—All proteins were purified from the conditioned medium of episomally transfected 293-EBNA cells as described (12Howitt J.A. Clout N.J. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4406-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), transfected using FuGENE reagent (Roche Applied Science), and selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). His-tagged Robo IG1-2 was purified from serum-free conditioned medium using a 5-ml HisTrap column (GE Healthcare). Untagged Robo IG1-2 and His-tagged Slit D1-4 were purified using 5-ml HiTrap Heparin HP affinity columns (GE Healthcare). The Robo IG1-5 Fc proteins (wild-type and mutants) were purified using 1-ml HiTrap rProtein-A FF columns (GE Healthcare). SlitD1-4 and Robo IG1-5 Fc proteins were dialyzed into PBS for binding experiments. The Robo IG1-2 proteins used for crystallization were further purified on a 24-ml Superdex75 column (GE Healthcare) in TBS (His-tagged protein) or 0.02 m Na-HEPES pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl (untagged protein). All proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and quantified by measuring their absorption at 280 nm.Crystallography—His-tagged Robo IG1-2 in TBS buffer was concentrated to 19 mg/ml. Crystals were obtained by the hanging drop method at room temperature using 0.15 m KH2PO4, 12.5% PEG8000 as precipitant. Crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen in 0.15 m KH2PO4, 12.5% PEG8000, 25% glycerol. Diffraction data to 3.2 Å resolution were collected at 100 K on beamline 9.6 at the SRS Daresbury (λ = 0.87 Å). The crystals belong to space group P41212, a = b = 115.40 Å, c = 144.71 Å. There are three Robo IG1-2 molecules in the asymmetric unit, resulting in a solvent content of 63%.A Robo-heparin complex was prepared by mixing untagged Robo IG1-2 with a 1.4-molar excess of a heparin octasaccharide (Iduron, Manchester, UK). The complex was purified on a Superdex75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) in 0.02 m Na-HEPES pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and concentrated to 15 mg/ml. Crystals were obtained at room temperature in nano-crystallization drops, using a Mosquito pipetting robot (TTP LabTech, Melbourn, UK). The drops consisted of 100 nl of protein solution and 100 nl of reservoir solution (10% PEG6000, 0.1 m Na-HEPES, pH 7.5 and 5% MPD) as precipitant. Crystals were harvested directly from the nanodrops and frozen in liquid nitrogen in 10% PEG6000, 0.1 m Na-HEPES pH 7.5, 20% glycerol. Diffraction data to 3.2 Å resolution were collected at 100 K on beamline 10.1 at the SRS Daresbury (λ = 1.12 Å). The crystals belong to space group P21, a = 64.93 Å, b = 84.43 Å, c = 107.13 Å, β = 98.54°. There are four Robo IG1-2 molecules in the asymmetric unit, resulting in a solvent content of 59%.The diffraction data were processed with MOSFLM and programs of the CCP4 suite (23CCP4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19704) Google Scholar). The tetragonal structure of His-tagged Robo IG1-2 was solved by molecular replacement with PHASER (24McCoy A.J.

The monoclinic Robo IG1-2 structure was solved by molecular replacement using the partially refined structure of the tetragonal form as a search model; the IG domains had to be located individually to obtain a solution. Both structures were built with O (27Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar) and COOT (28Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22799) Google Scholar), and refined with CNS (29Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Open table in a new tab Solid-phase Protein Binding Assay—The solid-phase binding assay was carried out as described (12Howitt J.A. Clout N.J. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4406-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, Slit D1-4 (100 μg/ml) was coated onto 96-well microtiter plates (NUNC Maxisorp). Wells were blocked with TBS/casein/Tween 20 and washed with TBS. Robo IG1-5 Fc protein was added for 1 h. After four washes, bound protein was detected by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human Fc antibody (Sigma).Heparin Affinity Chromatography—300 μg of each Robo IG1-5 Fc protein (wild-type and mutants) were injected onto a 5-ml HiTrap Heparin HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient of 0-1 m NaCl over 5 column volumes at 2 ml/min.Docking Calculations—To obtain an atomic model of the Slit D2-Robo IG1-2 complex, Robo IG1 in the crystal structure of the human Slit2 D2-Robo1 IG1 complex (14Morlot C. Thielens N.M. Ravelli R.B. Hemrika W. Romijn R.A. Gros P. Cusack S. McCarthy A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gros P. Cusack S. McCarthy A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 14923-14928Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). An atomic model of a heparin decasaccharide was obtained from the crystal structure of a ternary fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-heparin complex (31Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). AutoDock 4 (32Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (8957) Google Scholar) was used to add polar hydrogens and charges to the heparin decamer and the Slit D2-Robo IG1-2 complex. The complex was covered by a 1 Å grid, and a total of 10 independent docking runs were carried out with AutoDock 4, using a Lamarckian genetic algorithm and the following set of parameters: initial population, 150; maximum number of energy evaluations, 250,000; maximum number of generations, 27,000; elitism rate, 1; mutation rate, 0.02; crossover rate, 0.8. The protocol was validated by performing similar docking runs on two different crystal structures of FGF-FGFR-heparin complexes (31Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 33Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol.

In both cases, AutoDock 4 returned the experimentally observed heparin position as the lowest energy model.RESULTSRobo IG1-2 Structure—We determined the structure of Drosophila Robo IG1-2 in two crystal forms: a tetragonal form containing the protein with a C-terminal His tag, and a monoclinic form containing the untagged protein in the presence of a heparin octasaccharide. Both crystal forms contain multiple copies in the asymmetric unit and diffracted only to modest resolution (3.2 Å). After many failed attempts, the structure of the tetragonal form was eventually solved by molecular replacement using IG2 of MuSK (26Stiegler A.L. Burden S.J. Hubbard S.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 424-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) as a search model (r.m.s. deviation of 1.0 and 1.3 Å with respect to Robo IG1 and IG2, respectively; initial R-factor of 0.48). The monoclinic form was then solved readily using a partially refined model of the tetragonal form. In both crystal forms, the Robo main chain could be built completely, except for a few residues in the loops connecting strands C and D of both IG1 and IG2. Within each form, the crystallographically independent molecules are very similar: the three copies of the tetragonal structure can be superimposed with r.m.s. deviations of 0.9-1.3 Å (180 Cα atoms), and the four copies of the monoclinic structure can be superimposed with r.m.s. deviations of 0.6-1.0 Å (180 Cα atoms). Molecule A of the monoclinic structure could be traced completely and will serve as the reference model in the following description.The IG1 and IG2 domains of Drosophila Robo belong to the I-set of the IG domain superfamily, a subclass found in many cell adhesion molecules, receptor protein tyrosine kinases, and other signaling receptors (34Harpaz Y. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). These domains adopt a typical β-sandwich fold with two antiparallel sheets packing against each other (Fig. 1A). The opposing sheets are made up of strands A/A′-B/B′-E-D and C-F-G/G′, respectively, and are connected by a disulfide bond between strands B and F. In both IG1 and IG2, there is a cis-proline in the reverse turn following strand B′ (Pro-83 and Pro-183, respectively), a feature also seen in the related IG domains of MuSK (26Stiegler A.L. Burden S.J. Hubbard S.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 424-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and axonin (35Freigang J. Proba K. Leder L. Diederichs K. Sonderegger P. Welte W. Cell. 2000; 101: 425-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Strands C and D of both IG1 and IG2 are connected by long loops, which are partially disordered in all but one of the crystallographically independent Robo IG1-2 molecules. The single exception is molecule A of the monoclinic form, where the C-D loop of IG2 is folded into an α-helix. Finally, compared with other I-set IG domains, Robo IG1 also has a relatively long loop connecting strands E and F.There is essentially no linker between the two IG domains in the Robo IG1-2 tandem. In the monoclinic form, the last β-strand of IG1 (G′) extends into domain IG2 and hydrogen bonds with a short extended segment in the A-B loop of IG2 (strand B′), resulting in an almost linear arrangement of the two IG domains. In the tetragonal form, a substantially different conformation is observed: the β-interaction in the linker is lost, resulting in a rotation by 35° of IG2 relative to IG1 (Fig. 1B). The hinge point of this rotation is at Ile-150, which in the monoclinic form is still part of the extended G′ strand.Mapping of Slit Binding Site—To identify residues involved in Slit binding, we designed a series of Robo point mutants and tested them in a Slit binding assay. Because the Slit-Robo signaling mechanism is conserved in higher eukaryotes (3Dickson B.J. Gilestro G.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 651-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) we looked for conserved residues exposed on the surface of the Robo molecule. Because the Robo binding site on Slit contains Tyr, His, and Leu residues (12Howitt J.A. Clout N.J. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4406-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we expected the Slit binding site to contain a mixture of hydrophobic and polar residues. Taking into account these characteristics, and using a combination of sequence alignment (Fig. 2), surface conservation, and electrostatics (Fig. 3), we identified three potential Slit binding patches in the Robo IG1-2 tandem: (1Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S. Science. 1996; 274: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (2674) Google Scholar) Arg-57/Ile-59/Glu-60 residing in strand A of IG1; (2Dickson B.J.

Here, we test the hypothesis that osteoclasts secrete the lymphatic growth factor, VEGF-C, to increase their resorptive activity. Osteoclasts and osteoclast precursors were generated by culturing splenocytes with macrophage colony-stimulating factor and RANKL from wild-type, NF-κBp50-/-/p52-/-, and Src-/- mice. Expression of VEGFs was measured by real time reverse transcription-PCR, Western blotting, and immunostaining. The effect of VEGF-C signaling on osteoclast function was determined by osteoclastogenesis and pit assays. RANKL increased the expression of VEGF-C but not of other VEGFs in osteoclasts and their precursors. RANKL-induced VEGF-C expression was reduced in NF-κBp50-/-/p52-/- precursors or wild-type cells treated with an NF-κB inhibitor. VEGF-C directly stimulated RANKL-mediated bone resorption, which was reduced by the VEGF-C-specific receptor blocker, VEGFR3:Fc. Osteoclasts express VEGFR3, and VEGF-C stimulated Src phosphorylation in osteoclasts. VEGF-C-mediated bone resorption was abolished in Src-/- osteoclasts or cells treated with an Src inhibitor. We conclude that RANKL stimulates osteoclasts and their precursors to release VEGF-C through an NF-κB-dependent mechanism, indicating that VEGF-C is a new RANKL target gene in osteoclasts and functions as an autocrine factor regulating osteoclast activity.

Osteoclasts are bone-resorbing cells that play important roles in normal and pathologic bone remodeling. Osteoclast formation requires the expression of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) 3The abbreviations used are: M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; OCP, osteoclast precursor; IL, interleukin; TNF-Tg, TNF transgenic; WT, wild type; dKO, double knock-out; RT, reverse transcription; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. and receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (RANK) ligand (RANKL) by accessory cells, such as osteoblasts and bone marrow stromal cells, and of RANK, a member of the TNF receptor family, by osteoclast precursors (OCPs). RANKL and RANK interaction in OCPs triggers a cascade of signal transducing events and sequentially activates the transcription factors, NF-κB, AP-1, and NFATc1, leading to differentiation of OCPs to osteoclasts (1Wada T.

Metab. 2005; 23: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrate that osteoclasts are involved in more complex processes than simply resorption of bone. Osteoclasts can be activated to secrete factors that act through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms to contribute to inflammation and autoimmunity (4Takayanagi H. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 292-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). For example, osteoclasts from patients with Paget's disease or giant cell tumors of bone produce higher levels of various cytokines and growth factors, including IL-6 and platelet-derived growth factor, than cells from normal bone (5Mills B.G. Frausto A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1997; 61: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In co-cultures, myeloma cells and osteoclasts constitutively secrete the proangiogenic factors, VEGF-A (vascular endothelial growth factor-A) and osteopontin (6Tanaka Y. Abe M. Hiasa M. Oda A.

In addition, platelet-derived growth factor-BB has been detected in the conditioned medium of the mouse macrophage/osteoclast precursor Raw 264.7 cells treated with RANKL (7Kubota K. Sakikawa C. Katsumata M. Nakamura T. Wakabayashi K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that osteoclasts also function as immunomodulators and affect the functions of other processes in addition to bone resorption (8Boyce B.F. Schwarz E.M. Xing L. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2006; 18: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 9Xing L. Schwarz E.M. Boyce B.F. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 208: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In the course of searching for new genes that osteoclasts express under pathologic conditions, we performed microarray analysis using mRNA from purified blood and bone marrow CD11b+/Gr-1-/lo OCPs from TNF transgenic (TNF-Tg) mice with established arthritis and wild-type (WT) mice. We detected significantly increased VEGF-C expression in cells from the arthritic mice (10Zhang Q. Lu Y. Proulx S. Guo R. Yao Z. Schwarz E.M. Boyce B.F. Xing L. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2007; 9: R118Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The VEGF gene family consists of VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and placental growth factor. VEGF-A, the prototype of VEGF ligands binds and activates two receptors, VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and VEGFR2 (11Tammela T. Enholm B. Alitalo K. Paavonen K. Cardiovasc.

The above studies proposed that VEGFs are released by cells other than osteoclasts, including blood vessel endothelium (13Nakagawa M. Kaneda T. Arakawa T. Morita S. Sato T. Yomada T. Hanada K. Kumegawa M. Hakeda Y. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), osteoblasts (19Deckers M.M. Karperien M. van der Bent C. Yamashita T. Papapoulos S.E. Lowik C.W.

Whether or not osteoclasts themselves produce VEGFs that could function in an autocrine manner has not been studied to date. VEGF-C has a unique role in lymphangiogenesis as a potent lymphatic endothelial cell growth factor through VEGFR3-mediated signaling. VEGF-C is highly expressed by numerous cancer cells, inflammatory macrophages, and synoviocytes (20Su J.L. Yen C.J. Chen P.S. Chuang S.E. Hong C.C. Kuo I.H. Chen H.Y. Hung M.C. Kuo M.L. Br. J.

The clinical or physiological significance of VEGF-C expression in this setting is unknown. Furthermore, little is known about the role of VEGF-C/VEGFR3 signaling in osteoclast formation and activation. Here, we used primary OCPs derived from the spleen cells of WT and NF-κB-deficient mice and demonstrate that RANKL stimulated osteoclasts and OCPs to produce significantly increased amounts of VEGF-C. VEGF-C treatment or retroviral overexpression of VEGF-C in OCPs increased osteoclastic bone-resorbing activity but had no effect on osteoclast formation or survival. Disruption of VEGFR3 signaling by a VEGFR3:Fc chimeric protein reduced RANKL-mediated osteoclastic bone resorption, whereas interruption of VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 signaling had no effect. Our findings reveal that VEGF-C is a new target gene for RANKL in osteoclasts and that it acts as an autocrine factor positively regulating osteoclast function. Animals—WT (C57Bl/6), NF-κBp50-/-/p52-/- double knock-out (dKO) (C57Bl/6 × 129), and Src-/- (C57Bl/6) mice were used. NF-κB and Src knock-out mouse colonies were maintained and genotyped, as we described previously (27Xing L. Venegas A.M. Chen A. Garrett-Beal L. Boyce B.F. Varmus H.E. Schwartzberg P.L.

Except for NF-κB dKO mice, which were used at 3-4 weeks old due to early death of these animals, all other mice used were between 6 and 10 weeks old. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Rochester University approved all studies. Reagents—Recombinant murine RANKL was purchased from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN), recombinant rat VEGF-C was from Calbiochem, fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-mouse CD11b (M1/70) was from eBioscience (San Diego, CA), rabbit antibody to VEGF-C (H-190) and c-Src (N-16) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

VEGFR1:Fc was provided by ImClone Systems Inc. (New York). A small molecular NF-κB activation inhibitor was purchased from Calbiochem (catalog number 481406). Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent, and cDNA was synthesized using a RNA PCR Core Kit (Applied Biosystems, Branchburg, NJ). Quantitative PCR amplification was performed with gene-specific primers using an iCycler multiple-color real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad), as we described previously (29Kaneki H. Guo R.

The primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table 1. For each sample, the relative levels were normalized to actin in the same sample. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed with mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Conditioned media were concentrated with centrifugal devices (Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI). Whole cell lysates (20 μg of protein) and concentrated conditioned media (80 μg of protein) were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-VEGF-C or anti-actin antibody (Sigma). Membranes were then washed and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (BioRad) and visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells were cultured on glass slides and fixed in cold methanol at -20 °C for 10 min. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated in 0.1% Triton and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin plus PBS for 30 min. The fixed cells were stained with a mixture of fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-CD11b and anti-VEGF-C antibody followed by Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG, and To-Pro-3 iodide. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extract preparation and EMSA were performed, as described previously (30Feng J.Q. Xing L. Zhang J.H. Zhao M. Horn D. Chan J. Boyce B.F. Harris S.E.

For competition assays, nuclear extracts and unlabeled oligonucleotides were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature with binding reaction buffer. The DNA-protein complex formed was then separated from free oligonucleotide on 5% native polyacrylamide gels. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—The ChIP assay was performed essentially according to the instructions in the Millipore EZ-ChIP™ kit. Briefly, Raw 264.7 cells were treated with RANKL (10 ng/ml) for 30 min and fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. The cross-linked cells were sonicated and immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-NF-κB p65 or p50 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or mouse IgG overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were then recovered with Protein G-agarose beads, washed five times with the buffers provided with the kit, and then eluted with immunoprecipitation elution buffer (50 mm NaHCO3, 1% SDS) at room temperature. The samples were decross-linked, purified using spin columns, and resolved in sterile distilled water. PCRs were performed using 1 cycle at 95 °C for 1 min and 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by further elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were visualized on a 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide staining. The primer pairs for the mouse VEGF-C promoter in the ChIP assays were 5′-GAGGGCAAAAGTTGCGAGC-3′ and 5′-GTGAGGCTGAGGTCCTCTCCT-3′, and these bind at -47 and +56 bp from the putative NF-κB binding sequence, respectively. The expected amplicon size is 103 bp. Retroviral Vector and Infection—The coding sequence of human VEGF-C was amplified from MDA-231 human breast cancer cell line by PCR using forward primer 5′-CCTTGCGGCCGCCACCATGCACT-3′ (NotI) and reverse primer 5′ AAATCTTAAGTGTTTGGTCATTG (EcoRI) according to the published cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number X94216). After confirmation of the VEGF-C sequence by DNA sequencing, VEGF-C was cloned into the EcoRI site of the pMX-IRES-GFP vector provided by Dr. Matsuo Koichi. The retrovirus vector was transfected into the Plat-E retroviral packaging cell line, and viral supernatant was collected 48 h later for infection as we described previously (31Yamashita T. Yao Z.

Osteoclastogenesis and Bone Resorption Assays—Spleens were ground on a mesh to make single splenocyte suspensions. Red blood cells were lysed with NH4Cl (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) on ice for 10 min and washed with medium twice and resuspended in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then cultured with 1:20 diluted conditioned medium containing M-CSF (from an M-CSF-producing cell line) (34Takeshita S. Kaji K. Kudo A. J. Bone Miner.

Alternatively, the cells were cultured with M-CSF for 3 days to generate OCPs, as we described previously (33Zhang Q. Badell I.R. Schwarz E.M. Boulukos K.E. Yao Z. Boyce B.F. Xing L. Arthritis Rheum. 2005; 52: 2708-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and then infected with retroviral supernatants and cultured with M-CSF and RANKL on bone slices to form mature osteoclasts. The cells were fixed and stained for tartrate-resistant acid (TRAP) activity to identify osteoclasts as TRAP+ cells containing at least three nuclei and then removed and stained with 0.5% toluidine blue to visualize resorption pits for bone resorption activity, as we described previously (31Yamashita T.

Staining of Actin Rings—Osteoclasts cultured on bone slices were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 5 min and permeabilized for 5 min in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. After three washes with cold PBS, cells on bone slices were stained using rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 30 min. Osteoclasts with actin rings were counted using a phase-contrast fluorescence microscope. Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.D. of triplicates, and all experiments were performed at least twice with similar results. Statistical analyses were performed with Statview statistical software (SAS, Cary, NC). Differences between two groups were compared using unpaired Student's t test, and more than two groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance, followed by the Bonferroni/Dunnet test. p values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. RANKL Stimulates Osteoclasts and OCPs to Produce VEGF-C—Recently, we found that OCPs from peripheral blood and bone marrow of TNF-Tg arthritic mice express high levels of VEGF-C compared with those from WT littermates (10Zhang Q. Lu Y. Proulx S. Guo R. Yao Z. Schwarz E.M. Boyce B.F. Xing L. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2007; 9: R118Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These mice also have increased expression of TNF, IL-1, and RANKL. To determine if these cytokines stimulate VEGF-C production by OCPs, we treated primary OCPs generated from WT splenocytes with RANKL, TNF, or IL-1. RANKL increased VEGF-C mRNA expression 12-fold, whereas TNF increased it only 3-4-fold (Fig. 1A). IL-1 increased VEGF-C expression to the same extent as TNF (data not shown). No effect on VEGF-A, -B, or -D expression was detected in the same samples (Fig. 1A). In conditioned media from these experiments, expression of a processed and functional form of VEGF-C protein (29 kDa) was increased at 48 h after RANKL treatment (Fig. 1B). Time and dose-response studies showed that RANKL, at the dose that is used routinely in osteoclastogenesis assays (10 ng/ml), increased VEGF-C mRNA levels, starting at 8 h (Fig. 1C). The lowest dose of RANKL that induced VEGF-C expression was 1 ng/ml (Fig. 1C), which is lower than the dose (10 ng/ml) used typically to induce maximum osteoclast formation. In preliminary experiments, we demonstrated that 1 ng/ml RANKL induced 4-fold fewer osteoclasts than 10 ng/ml RANKL on plastic culture wells. We next examined the expression pattern of VEGF-C mRNA and protein in WT cells during RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. These increased with time and peaked at 48-72 h when mature osteoclasts had formed (Fig. 1, D and E). In contrast, expression levels of VEGF-A, the predominant angiogenic VEGF family member (11Tammela T. Enholm B. Alitalo K. Paavonen K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 550-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), were unchanged during osteoclast differentiation (Fig. 1D). To examine the distribution of VEGF-C protein and its relationship with expression of CD11b, a surface marker of OCPs and macrophages, we performed double immunocytochemical staining of cells cultured on glass slides with anti-CD11b and anti-VEGF-C antibodies using a confocal microscope (Fig. 1E). As reported previously (35Lee S.K. Gardner A.E. Kalinowski J.F. Jastrzebski S.L. Lorenzo J.A. Bone. 2006; 38: 678-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), CD11b protein was expressed on the surface of OCPs, and this expression disappeared when OCPs became mature multinucleated osteoclasts. In contrast, VEGF-C protein expression increased progressively in the cytoplasm of these mononuclear cells as they differentiated into osteoclasts. Mononuclear OCPs also express VEGF-C in their cytoplasm while they have CD11b staining on the cell surface (Fig. 1E). To determine if RANKL stimulates mature osteoclasts to express VEGF-C, we cultured OCPs with RANKL and M-CSF and removed RANKL from the cultures overnight when multinucleated osteoclasts were visible under an inverted microscope. The cells were then treated with RANKL for a further 24 h. Under these conditions, RANKL-induced VEGF-C mRNA expression was increased further (Fig. 1F). NF-κB Regulates RANKL-induced Expression of VEGF-C by OCPs—To investigate the mechanisms by which RANKL induces VEGF-C expression, we focused on NF-κB signaling, because it plays an essential role in osteoclastogenesis down-stream from RANKL/RANK (3Boyce B.F. Yamashita T. Yao Z. Zhang Q. Li F. Xing L. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2005; 23: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and because the -108/-99 region of the mouse VEGF-C promoter has a putative NF-κB binding sequence (32Chilov D. Kukk E. Taira S. Jeltsch M. Kaukonen J. Palotie A. Joukov V. Alitalo K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25176-25183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). First, we searched our mRNA microarray data from RANKL-treated OCPs from NF-κB dKO mice and WT littermates and found that VEGF-C expression was reduced in NF-κB dKO cells compared with WT cells (data not shown). We then performed Western blot and EMSA assays using Raw264.7 cells and an oligonucleotide probe synthesized according to the putative NF-κB recognition sequence localized in the -108/-99 region of the mouse VEGF-C promoter. RANKL treatment stimulated nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 and p50 proteins, as anticipated (data not shown), and binding of nuclear protein to the NF-κB probe (Fig. 2A). This nuclear binding was abolished by an excess of unlabeled WT but not by an oligonucleotide in which the NF-κB binding sequence has been mutated to prevent binding (Fig. 2A). To determine if RANKL stimulates binding of NF-κB protein to the VEGF-C promoter in intact cells, we performed a ChIP assay using the same experimental conditions used in the EMSA and demonstrated that in RANKL-treated cells, NF-κB-containing proteins bound to the NF-κB binding sequence of the VEGF-C promoter (Fig. 2B). To further confirm involvement of NF-κB in RANKL-induced VEGF-C expression, splenocytes from NF-κB dKO and WT mice were cultured with M-CSF for 3 days to generate OCPs and then were treated with RANKL for 24 h. Similar to the microarray data, RANKL-induced VEGF-C expression in the dKO cells was significantly reduced compared with WT cells (Fig. 2C). We also treated WT OCPs with a recently developed nonspecific NF-κB inhibitor (31Yamashita T. Yao Z. Li F. Zhang Q. Badell I.R. Schwarz E.M. Takeshita S. Wagner E.F. Noda M. Matsuo K. Xing L.

Chem. 2003; 11: 3869-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and found that it also inhibited RANKL-induced VEGF-C expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). VEGF-C Increases the Bone Resorptive Activity of Osteoclasts—To determine if VEGF-C plays a direct role in osteoclast generation, activation, or survival, we cultured WT splenocytes on plastic dishes with RANKL and M-CSF in the presence or absence of VEGF-C. VEGF-C had no significant effect on basal or RANKL-induced osteoclast formation (data not shown). To examine if VEGF-C affects osteoclastic bone resorption on bone slices, we modified our typical culture protocol and used 10-fold lower concentrations of RANKL and M-CSF, which we determined in preliminary studies induced minimal resorption. Under these culture conditions, VEGF-C had no effect on osteoclast numbers cultured on either plastic plates (data not shown) or bone slices, but it significantly increased the osteoclast-induced resorption pit area in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). To confirm this observation, we constructed a retroviral construct, which contains the human VEGF-C cDNA followed by eGFP cDNA (pMX-hVEGF-C-IRSE-eGFP). Infection of WT OCPs with this hVEGF-C retrovirus on plastic plates induced high expression of hVEGF-C, which was confirmed by real time RT-PCR (Fig. 3B) and GFP fluorescence (Fig. 3C). Similar to the effect of exogenous VEGF-C treatment in Fig. 3A, overexpression of VEGF-C significantly increased the resorption pit area but had no effect on osteoclast numbers (Fig. 3D) or survival (supplemental Fig. 1). Furthermore, we consistently observed that TRAP-stained osteoclasts that had been generated on plastic dishes with low doses of RANKL and M-CSF in the presence of VEGF-C appeared to have thicker cell membranes than PBS-treated controls (Fig. 3E, arrow). Osteoclasts resorb bone by reorganizing their cytoskeleton to form ruffled borders and actin-rich rings on the bone surface. To examine if VEGF-C influences actin ring formation by resorbing osteoclasts, we generated osteoclasts on bone slices using suboptimal concentrations of RANKL and M-CSF with or without VEGF-C and stained them with rhoda"

Y., Chen, Y., Thai, P., Wachi, S., Huang, F., Kim, C., Harper, R. W., and Wu, R. (2004) J. Immunol. 173, 3482–3491). The molecular basis of this regulation is not known. In this study, we demonstrated a coordinated degradation of inhibitory κB(IκB)-α followed by a nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 NF-κB subunits and their binding to NF-κB sites of hBD-2 promoter region. With site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated the requirement of two proximal NF-κB binding sites (pκB1, -205 to -186; pκB2, -596 to -572) but not the distal site (dκB, -2193 to -2182) in supporting IL-17A-induced hBD-2 promoter activity. These results are consistent with the data of the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, which showed enhanced p50 binding to these pκB sites but not the dκB site in cells after IL-17A treatment. We also found that the NF-κB binding cofactor, IκB-ζ, was up-regulated by IL-17A, and the knockdown of IκB-ζ significantly diminished the IL-17A-induced hBD-2 expression. This is the first demonstration of the involvement of two proximal NF-κB sites and IκB-ζ in the regulation of hBD-2 by IL-17A, two important genes responsible for host defense.

The known function of hBD-2 in innate immunity is believed to be related to its antimicrobial activity and to its chemotactic effects on immature dendritic cells and memory T-cells (28Yang D. Biragyn A. Kwak L.W. Oppenheim J.J. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 291-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). To date, the induction of hBD-2 by lipopolysaccharide and IL-1β has been reported to be modulated by both the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and/or NF-κB pathways (29Jang B.C. Lim K.J. Paik J.H. Kwon Y.K. Shin S.W. Kim S.C. Jung T.Y. Kwon T.K. Cho J.W. Baek W.K. Kim S.P. Suh M.H. Suh S.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Immunol. 2003; 170: 4226-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), although the nature of the regulation is not completely characterized. It has been indicated that NF-κB mediates IL-1β- or TNF-α-induced hBD-2 transcription in A549 cells via p65-p50 binding to a proximal NF-κB-responsive element, the pκB1 site. Furthermore using macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells, it has been shown that the p65-p50 heterodimer could bind to this site on stimulation of the cells with lipopolysaccharide (32Tsutsumi-Ishii Y. Nagaoka I. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2002; 71: 154-162PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the p65-p65 homodimer is reported to selectively bind to the pκB1 site in gastrointestinal cell lines exposed to Helicobacter pylori or flagella filament protein from Salmonella enteritidis (33Ogushi K. Wada A. Niidome T. Mori N. Oishi K. Nagatake T. Takahashi A. Asakura H. Makino S. Hojo H. Nakahara Y. Ohsaki M. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H. Kurazono H. Moss J. Hirayama T. J. Biol.

Thus, transcriptional activation of hBD-2 gene may be regulated by a combination of NF-κB subunits in a cell type- or stimulus-specific manner. For IL-17A-induced hBD-2, the molecular basis of the stimulation has not been resolved.NF-κB has been shown to play a critical role in the mammalian immune system (35Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar, 36Bonizzi G. Karin M.

Cell. 2008; 132: 344-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3445) Google Scholar). The five members of the mammalian NF-κB family, p65 (RelA), RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52, exist in unstimulated cells as homo- or heterodimers bound to inhibitory κB(IκB) family proteins. The classical NF-κB signaling pathway could be stimulated by IL-1β and activated via the activation of the IκB kinase complex, which then phosphorylates IκB proteins and then releases NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus. The p65-p50 heterodimer is usually the most abundant form of the NF-κB family and acts as a strong transactivator. Intriguingly a recently identified IκB family member, IκB-ζ, is up-regulated by IL-1 and lipopolysaccharide. IκB-ζ was also shown to be involved in inhibiting or activating some NF-κB-regulated genes.Recently we have shown that inhibitors that affect NF-κB translocation and the DNA binding activity of its p65 NF-κB subunit could attenuate IL-17A-induced hBD-2 expression in both primary TBE and an immortalized normal bronchial epithelial cell line, HBE1 (1Kao C.Y. Chen Y. Thai P. Wachi S. Huang F. Kim C. Harper R.W. Wu R. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3482-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). These findings support an NF-κB-mediated transcriptional mechanism for IL-17A-induced hBD-2 expression. Despite this progress, very little information is available for both the cis- and trans-acting elements required in IL-17A-mediated hBD-2 transcription. In this study, we undertook the task to elucidate the molecular basis of the transcriptional regulation of hBD-2 by site-directed mutagenesis, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and DNA-protein interaction. Two proximal NF-κB binding sites at the 5′-flanking region of hBD-2 were identified as important sites for IL-17A-induced DNA-protein interaction.Given the intriguing and critical connections of hBD-2 and IL-17A in airway innate immunity, it is important to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the regulation of hBD-2 expression by IL-17A. Although little information has yet to be uncovered about this mechanism, our study revealed that IL-17A activates NF-κB in airway epithelial cells. Further studies identified functional κB response elements in the promoter of the hBD-2 gene. We then demonstrated that IL-17A stimulates hBD-2 gene transcription via NF-κB, and this study may render the detailed mechanism useful for the treatment of airway innate immunity-related disease.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Recombinant human IL-1β and -17A were purchased from R&D Systems Inc.

Huang F. Kim C. Harper R.W. Wu R. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3482-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). For the mRNA stability study, cells were pretreated with or without 20 ng/ml IL-17A for 24 h. Then 5 μg/ml actinomycin D was added to these cultures, which were harvested for RNA isolation at various hours as indicated.Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR Expression Analysis—The RNA extraction, cDNA generation, primer sequences of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, β-actin, and hBD-2 for real time PCR were described in our previous study (1Kao C.Y.

The following PCR primers were used for human IκB-ζ: forward, CATGGGAAATCCAATGAACAC; and reverse, GGCAACAGCAATATGAAGGAA.NF-κB/Nuclear Extract Binding Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—BD™ TransFactor NF-κB Family Colorimetric kit from BD Biosciences Clontech was used to quantify the NF-κB-specific binding activity of nuclear extract. The quantification was carried out according to the manufacturerŉs protocol. Briefly to each well 20 μg of nuclear extract were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Microtiter wells were then washed three times, and diluted primary antibodies against various NF-κB subunits were added (100 ml/well) and incubated further at room temperature for an hour. After extensive washing, diluted secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was added to each well and further incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After repeated washing, 100 μl of tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution were added to each well in the dark for the color development at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by 100 μl of 1 n HCl/well, and binding intensity was measured as absorbance at 450 nm using a microtiter plate reader.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HBE1 cells were plated to sterile Lab-Tek II chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY). At various times after IL-17A treatment, cells in slide chambers were fixed at 4 °C for overnight in PBS supplemented with 4% paraformaldehyde solution. The slide chambers were washed three times with PBS for 5 min each, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C, and blocked with the blocking buffer containing 2% goat serum in PBS with Tween 20 for 30 min at 37 °C. The slide chambers were then stained with mouse anti-p50 monoclonal and rabbit anti-p65 polyclonal primary antibodies (1:200 dilution in blocking buffer) for 1 h at 37 °C, washed three times with PBS with Tween 20 for 5 min each, and incubated with fluorescently labeled Alexa Fluor 488-goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 568-goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (1:500 dilution in blocking buffer) (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) for 1 h at 37 °C. Nuclei were counterstained with VECTASHIELD® mounting medium with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The staining was visualized using a Zeiss AxioSkop fluorescence microscope (×40 objective).Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear lysates from cultured HBE1 cells were harvested according to the Panomics (Redwood City, CA) nuclear extraction protocol. In brief, HBE1 cells were lysed with a lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Igepal, and protease inhibitor mixture) on ice for 10 min and harvested using a sterile scraper. The cytosolic fraction was collected from the supernatant by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in extraction buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture). After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle rocking, the nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatants were collected and stored at -80 °C.Western Blotting—HBE1 cells were treated with 20 ng/ml IL-17A and IL-1β, the positive control, at different time intervals. Cells were either harvested in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer followed by a brief sonication and centrifugation or with the Panomics Nuclear Extraction kit according to the manufacturerŉs protocol for nuclear and cytosolic protein extractions. The concentrations of the resulting total, nuclear, and cytosolic proteins were then determined by the Lowry method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Twenty micrograms of protein extracts were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blot analysis.Site-directed Mutagenesis of hBD-2 Promoter-Luciferase Reporter Plasmid and siRNA—The hBD-2-2210 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid has been described in the previous study (1Kao C.Y. Chen Y. Thai P. Wachi S. Huang F. Kim C. Harper R.W. Wu R. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3482-3491Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The three individual NF-κB sequences in the hBD-2 promoter construct, hBD-2-2210/Luc, dκB(-2193 to -2182), pκB2 (-596 to -572), and pκB1 (-205 to -186), were mutagenized by using the Transformer™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (BD Biosciences Clontech). The resulting mutated NF-κB constructs were termed dκB-mut/Luc, pκB2-mut/Luc, pκB1-mut/Luc, and dκB+pκB2+pκB1mut/Luc (mutations on all three NF-κB sites). The authenticity of these mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. siRNAs against IκB-ζ (identification number 33380) and random oligomer were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX).Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—HBE1 cells were seeded into 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. One day after plating, cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of hBD-2-2210/Luc, dκB-mut/Luc, pκB2-mut/Luc, pκB1-mut/Luc, or dκB+pκB2+pκB1mut/Luc plasmid DNA and 50 ng of Renilla luciferase expression vector pRL-TK (Promega) using the FuGENE 6-based gene transfer protocol (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturerŉs instructions. Eighteen hours after the transfection, cells were treated with 20 ng/ml IL-17A, and cell extracts were prepared for reporter gene assays 24 h after the IL-17A treatment. The reporter gene assays were carried out with the Dual-Glo™ Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturerŉs protocol. The relative hBD-2 promoter activities were expressed as relative luciferase units after normalization to the internal control, Renilla luciferase activity. The results were averaged from triplicate wells of three separate experiments. For siRNA transfection, cells were plated at 40–60% density a day before transfection. An Oligofectamine-based transfection kit (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturerŉs instruction. Sixteen hours after transfection, the siRNA transfection mixture was replaced with fresh culture medium. Two days later, cultures were depleted of hormonal supplements 24 h before IL-17A treatment. At various times after the treatment, cells were harvested for gene expression analyses.NoShift p50 and p65 Binding Assay—The NoShift transcriptional factor assay kit (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) was used to measure binding of NF-κB p50 and p65 proteins to three NF-κB binding sequences on hBD-2 promoter as described in the manual. Briefly 10 μg each of sense and antisense 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotides (dκB-sense, 5′-CTTTGGGACTTCCCCAGCTA-3′;dκB-antisense, 5′-TAGCTGGGGAAGTCCCAAAG-3′;pκB2-sense, 5′-TGGGGAGTTTCAGGGGAACTTTCAC-3′, pκB2-antisense, 5′-GTGAAAGTTCCCCTGAAACTCCCCA-3′;pκB1-sense, 5′-AGGGATTTTCTGGGGTTTCC-3′, and pκB1-antisense, 5′-GGAAACCCCAGAAAATCCCT-3′) were dissolved to a final volume of 100 μl in a mixture of 0.5 m SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl plus 0.015 m sodium citrate), 75 mm NaCl, and 7.5 mm sodium citrate (pH 7.0), heated to 100 °C (in boiling water bath) for 10 min, slowly cooled to room temperature, and then diluted to 10 pmol/μl. Nonbiotinylated oligonucleotides with the same sequence duplex that were used as competitor DNA were prepared in the same way except with a final concentration of 50 pmol/μl.For measurement of binding affinity, the reaction mixtures mainly containing 1 pmol of biotinylated target DNA duplex, 20 μg of nuclear extract, and competitive nonbiotinylated DNA complexes were incubated on ice for 30 min. The reaction mixtures were then dispensed into freshly prepared streptavidin plates and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The binding of p50 and p65 was detected by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C with 100 μl of NF-κB p50 and p65 mouse IgG diluted 1:500 in NoShift antibody dilution buffer. After repeated washing of the plate, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was added (1:1,000 dilution in NoShift antibody dilution buffer). After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, wells were washed thoroughly, and tetramethylbenzidine substrate was added. The reaction was quenched by 100 μl of 1 n HCl/well, and binding intensity was measured as absorbance at 450 nm.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Formaldehyde cross-linking and chromatin immunoprecipitation in TBE cells were performed according to standard protocols on Farnham laboratory web site. After reversing the cross-links, the DNA was purified using the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and analyzed using PCR amplification. Five microliters of DNA were used for PCR to detect the presence of specific DNA segments with the following primer pairs: dκB: forward, 5′-CATCCCCCAGTCTCTTCATCT-3′; reverse, 5′-ATGAGACCAGTGTCCAGGCTA-3′; pκB2: forward, 5′-GGTGTGAATGGAAGGAACTCA-3′, reverse, 5′-TTCAGCTCCTGGGGATGATAC-3′; and pκB1: forward, 5′-TGGCAGGTTATAGGTCCTGAG-3′; reverse, 5′-ATAAAGGTCCTGGTCCCTGGT-3′.Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. The number of repetitions for each experiment is given under “Results.” Paired comparisons were carried out by t test. Differences were considered significant for p values less than or equal to 0.05.RESULTSIL-17A Activates Nuclear Translocation of NF-κB in Airway Epithelial Cells—Our recent work has demonstrated that both helenalin, an inhibitor for the DNA binding activity of NF-κB p65 subunit (40Lyss G. Knorre A. Schmidt T.J. Pahl H.L. Merfort I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33508-33516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), and sulfasalazine, an inhibitor shown to inhibit NF-κB activation via direct inhibition of IκB kinase (41Wahl C. Liptay S. Adler G. Schmid R.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1163-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), were very effective in abrogating IL-17A-induced hBD-2 expression in primary TBE and HBE1 cells (15Chen Y. Thai P. Zhao Y.H. Ho Y.S. DeSouza M.M. Wu R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17036-17043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the NF-κB-based transcriptional mechanism has not been resolved. Initially we sought to identify which NF-κB subunit(s) is involved. Using the BD TransFactor NF-κB Family Colorimetric kit, we observed a persistent basal level of p50-specific DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts prepared prior to IL-17A treatment (Fig. 1). For other NF-κB subunits, p65, p52, c-Rel, and Rel-B, the levels of their DNA binding activities were relatively low. However, after cytokine treatment, there was an early (30–60 min), transient increase of DNA binding activity for p50 and p65 subunits but not p52, c-Rel, and Rel-B in nuclear extracts prepared from HBE1 cells treated with IL-17A. These increases are more than 2- and 20-fold for p50- and p65-specific DNA binding activity, respectively. Of note, IL-1β stimulated even stronger binding activities to p65 and p50 (data not shown) than did IL-17A, and a similar transitional increase phenomenon was observed in primary TBE cells after IL-17A treatment (data not included).Because of the low levels of DNA binding activities for p52, c-Rel, and Rel-B, we focused on nuclear translocation of the other two NF-κB subunits, p50 and p65. Using an immunofluorescence microscope, we were able to observe the nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 in HBE1 cells 30 min after IL-17A treatment (Fig. 2). For p50, there was a low level presence in the nucleus prior to the cytokine treatment consistent with the above TransFactor enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. As a control, IL-1β was more effective in promoting nuclear translocation of both p50 and p65 in treated cells (Fig. 2, lower panels). A similar nuclear translocation phenomenon was observed with primary TBE cells except that the cell morphologies were more heterogeneous compared with the cell line (data not included).FIGURE 2Nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB transcriptional factors in human HBE1 cells after IL-17A and IL-1β treatments.

https://openalex.org/W2024059771,"The acid stress chaperones HdeA and HdeB of Escherichia coli prevent the aggregation of periplasmic proteins at acidic pH. We show in this report that they also form mixed aggregates with proteins that have failed to be solubilized at acidic pH and allow their subsequent solubilization at neutral pH. HdeA, HdeB, and HdeA and HdeB together display an increasing efficiency for the solubilization of protein aggregates at pH 3. They are less efficient for the solubilization of aggregates at pH 2, whereas HdeB is the most efficient. Increasing amounts of periplasmic proteins draw increasing amounts of chaperone into pellets, suggesting that chaperones co-aggregate with their substrate proteins. We observed a decrease in the size of protein aggregates in the presence of HdeA and HdeB, from very high molecular mass aggregates to 100–5000-kDa species. Moreover, a marked decrease in the exposed hydrophobicity of aggregated proteins in the presence of HdeA and HdeB was revealed by 1,1′-bis(4-anilino)naphtalene-5,5′-disulfonic acid binding experiments. In vivo, during the recovery at neutral pH of acid stressed bacterial cells, HdeA and HdeB allow the solubilization and renaturation of protein aggregates, including those formed by the maltose receptor MalE, the oligopeptide receptor OppA, and the histidine receptor HisJ. Thus, HdeA and HdeB not only help to maintain proteins in a soluble state during acid treatment, as previously reported, but also assist, both in vitro and in vivo, in the solubilization at neutral pH of mixed protein-chaperone aggregates formed at acidic pH, by decreasing the size of protein aggregates and the exposed hydrophobicity of aggregated proteins.

In their natural habitats, bacteria are constantly under assault from a vast array of environmental stresses, including UV irradiation, heat, oxidative, osmotic, and pH stresses (1De Angelis M. Gobbetti M. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 106-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). One of the most frequently encountered is acid stress (2Foster J.W. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Enterobacteria, when traveling through the gastrointestinal tract, encounter an extremely low pH; facultative intracellular pathogens tolerate episodes of low pH within macrophage phagolysosomes, and fermentative bacteria excrete acidic fermentation products that trigger an endogeneous acid stress (1De Angelis M. Gobbetti M. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 106-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In response to acid stress, bacteria regulate their cytoplasmic pH. Many bacteria possess amino acid decarboxylase systems that consist of cytoplasmic decarboxylases and antiporters that exchange imported amino acids for the cytoplasmic amines produced (1De Angelis M. Gobbetti M. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 106-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 2Foster J.W. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 3Hersh B.M.

Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 214-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), leading to cytoplasmic and periplasmic alkalinization. Helicobacter pylori overexpresses an urease that increases the production of ammonia (5Booth I.R. Cash P. O'Byrne C. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 2002; 81: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 6Ferrero R.L. Cussac V. Courcoux P. Labigne A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4212-4217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In several bacteria, the proton-translocating F1F0 ATPase can export protons as a consequence of ATP hydrolysis (7Tucker D.L. Tucker N. Conway T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6551-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Further protection against acid stress is obtained by decreasing the permeability of the inner and outer membranes to protons and by reversing the cytoplasmic membrane potential to an inside-positive potential that slows the proton influx into the cell (2Foster J.W. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 7Tucker D.L. Tucker N. Conway T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6551-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 8Richard H. Foster J.W. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6032-6041Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Bacteria can also reorientate their metabolism toward pathways that decrease proton production or increase amine production with a consequent alkalinization (6Ferrero R.L. Cussac V. Courcoux P. Labigne A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4212-4217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yohannes E. Barnhart D.M. Slonczewski J.L. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) Moreover, several protective proteins, such as the DnaK and GroEL chaperone machines (10Lim E.M. Ehrlich S.D. Maguin E. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 2557-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and several DNA repair enzymes (11Thompson S.A. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2185-2193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), may be induced upon acid stress. The bacterial periplasm is probably more vulnerable to acid stress than the cytoplasm, because of the relative permeability of the outer membrane porins to molecules smaller than 600 Da (12Koebnik R. Locher K.P. Van Gelder P. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 13Schirmer T. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Recently, two periplasmic chaperones, HdeA and HdeB, which support acid resistance in Escherichia coli, were discovered (14Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 15Hong W. Jiao W. Hu J. Zhang J. Liu C. Fu X. Shen D. Xia B. Chang Z. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). They are transcribed from the hdeAB operon, which is localized in the acid fitness island, a cluster of 12 genes located at 78.8 min that code for several proteins involved in acid stress resistance (2Foster J.W. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). HdeA and HdeB each have a molecular mass of ∼9 kDa (after processing of their signal sequence) and prevent the acid-induced aggregation of bacterial periplasmic extracts and of several model substrate proteins (15Hong W. Jiao W. Hu J. Zhang J. Liu C. Fu X. Shen D. Xia B. Chang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27029-27034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Kern R. Malki A. Abdallah J. Richarme G. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In vitro, HdeA plays a major role in protein solubilization at pH 2, and both proteins are involved in protein solubilization at pH 3 (16Kern R. Malki A. Abdallah J. Richarme G. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In vivo, however, there seems to be a requirement for both chaperones for optimal resistance to acid stress at either pH 2 or 3. HdeA and HdeB expose hydrophobic surfaces at acidic pHs, in accordance with the appearance of their chaperone properties at these pHs. They both dissociate from dimers at neutral pH into monomers at acidic pH, but they do not appear to form heteromultimers (15Hong W. Jiao W. Hu J. Zhang J. Liu C. Fu X. Shen D. Xia B. Chang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27029-27034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Kern R. Malki A. Abdallah J. Richarme G. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). HdeA exposes more hydrophobic surfaces than HdeB at acidic pH, but, unlike HdeB, it remains partially in its inactive dimeric form at pH 3 (16Kern R. Malki A. Abdallah J. Richarme G. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These dissimilarities might explain the differences in the chaperone properties of HdeA and HdeB and the requirement for both chaperones for optimal handling of unfolded proteins. In this report, we show that HdeA and HdeB not only help to maintain proteins in a soluble state during acid treatment (14Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 15Hong W. Jiao W. Hu J. Zhang J. Liu C. Fu X. Shen D. Xia B. Chang Z. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) but also participate, both in vitro and in vivo, in the solubilization and renaturation at neutral pH of proteins that had aggregated in their presence at acidic pH. Whereas most chaperones, like DnaK (Hsp70) 3The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat shock protein; bis-ANS, 1,1′-bis(4-anilino)naphtalene-5,5′-disulfonic acid. and GroEL (Hsp60), maintain unfolded proteins in a soluble state by preventing their aggregation, other chaperones, like small Hsps, are associated with insoluble proteins during heat stress, and their function is to promote the rapid resolubilization by Hsp70 or Hsp104/Hsp70 of aggregated proteins (17Cashikar A.G.

We show in this report that HdeA and HdeB, like small Hsps, belong to the restricted set of chaperones that form mixed aggregates with their substrate proteins and assist in their disaggregation. Preparation of Bacterial Extracts and Purification of HdeA and HdeB—HdeA and HdeB were expressed from the overproducing strains BL21 (DE3) pET-21a-hdeA and BL21 (DE3) pET-21a-hdeB and purified from osmotic shock fluids on DEAE-Sephacel and hydroxyapatite columns as described previously (16Kern R.

For experiments at acidic pH, HdeA and HdeB were equilibrated in distilled water by gel permeation on a Bio-Gel P10 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in water. Periplasmic extracts from the wild-type strain and from the hdeA mutant were prepared by the osmotic shock procedure described in Ref. 16Kern R. Malki A. Abdallah J. Richarme G. J.

We performed electrophoresis according to Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1972; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207227) Google Scholar), using 16% polyacrylamide gels with Coomassie Blue staining. We used National Institutes of Health Image 1.62 software to quantify protein bands on polyacrylamide gels. Chaperone Assays and Solubilization of Protein Aggregates—The chaperone activities of HdeA and HdeB were assayed by incubating periplasmic extracts from the hdeA mutant (deficient in both HdeA and HdeB (16Kern R. Malki A. Abdallah J. Richarme G. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar)) for 60 min at 25 °C in the presence of HdeA and/or HdeB at acidic pH, and then the appearance of the proteins (analyzed by SDS-PAGE) in the 15,000 × g pellet or supernatant was monitored. To test the solubilization of protein aggregates by acid stress chaperones, we incubated periplasmic extracts from the hdeA mutant at either pH 3 or 2 for 60 min at 25 °C, either alone or with purified HdeA, HdeB, or both together, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 15,000 × g. The pH 3 or 2 pellets were resuspended and incubated in 100 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl for 60 min at 25 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g, and the pH 8 pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Sulfate (150 mm) was used as the anion to achieve efficient aggregation of substrate proteins at low pH values (15Hong W. Jiao W. Hu J. Zhang J. Liu C. Fu X. Shen D. Xia B. Chang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27029-27034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Kern R. Malki A. Abdallah J. Richarme G. J.

Size of Protein Aggregates—Periplasmic extracts form the ΔhdeA strain (20 μg) were incubated at pH 3 for various times, ranging from 5 to 90 min, either in the absence or in the presence of HdeA and HdeB (10 μg each), in a total volume of 20 μl, and the samples were loaded onto a Bio-Gel A-15m column (bed volume, 1 ml; height, 25 cm; flow rate, 10 μl/min) equilibrated with 150 mm Na2SO4 pH 4.1 (we checked that at this pH, no significant protein aggregation or aggregate solubilization occurs). The proteins were detected by the Bradford assay and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Membrane vesicles (V0), blue dextran (2 MDa), thyroglobulin (670 kDa), catalase (240 kDa), serum albumin (66 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.5 kDa) were used as molecular mass standards. bis-ANS Labeling—Periplasmic extracts from the ΔhdeA strain (20 μg) were incubated for 60 min at pH 3, either in the absence or in the presence of HdeA and HdeB; 100 μm bis-ANS was then added, and the samples were illuminated under UV light for 20 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g (20Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE; fluorescent bands were photographed on a 340-nm transilluminator, and the gel was later stained with Coomassie Blue. We used National Institutes of Health Image 1.62 software to quantify protein bands on polyacrylamide gels (quantification of fluorescent bands was done on the negative image of the gel). The ratio of fluorescence/Coomassie Blue staining reflects the exposed hydrophobicity of proteins. We checked, using different quantities of protein pellets without chaperones, that the intensity of fluorescence was proportional to that of the Coomassie Blue staining). Solubilization after Acid Stress of Periplasmic Protein Aggregates in Wild-type and ΔhdeA Cells—Cultures of E. coli wild-type and ΔhdeA mutant strains were grown in LB medium at pH 7 to the beginning of the stationary phase, centrifuged, and resuspended in LB medium pH 3 for 15 min, followed by centrifugation and resuspension in LB medium pH 7 for 0–60 min (all of the experiments were done at 37 °C under agitation, and, by plating bacteria on LB agar plates after the 15 min acid stress, we checked that it did not affect the viability of cells). Spheroplasts were formed by the lysozyme-EDTA method; 40 ml of cells was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min and resuspended into 1 ml of 30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20% sucrose, 10 mm EDTA at 20 °C. After 1 min, 200 μl of 10 mg/ml lysozyme was added at once, and the whole was incubated for 5 min at 20 °C followed by 20 min at 0 °C. For the global analysis of periplasmic proteins released by the spheroplasting procedure, periplasmic extracts (soluble and aggregated periplasmic proteins) were separated from spheroplasts by a short centrifugation for 1 min at 8,000 × g in a Beckman Microfuge, and the supernatant was then centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g. The 15,000 × g supernatants (soluble periplasmic proteins) and pellets (periplasmic protein aggregates) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. This differential centrifugation procedure was mandatory for the global analysis of periplasmic protein aggregates. It missed, however, a fraction of periplasmic protein aggregates that had already pelleted during the first centrifugation step (27Arié J.P. Miot M. Sasoon N. Betton J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). 4A. Malki, H.-T. Le, S. Milles, R. Kern, T. Caldas, J. Abdallah, and G. Richarme, unpublished results. , 5J. M. Betton, personal communication. For the analysis of MalE, OppA, HisJ, and MglB, samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g immediately after the spheroplasting procedure, and supernatants containing the periplasmic soluble proteins were withdrawn. The spheroplast pellets were washed, resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, freeze-thawed, ultrasonicated for 15 s, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were washed with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and resuspended in the same buffer (this fraction contained the cell membranes and periplasmic protein aggregates) (27Arié J.P. Miot M. Sasoon N. Betton J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Immunoblots—Proteins from the various fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were either stained with Coomassie Blue or silver stain or electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, which were incubated first with rabbit antiserum against MalE, OppA, and MglB and then with horseradish peroxidase-coupled antiserum against rabbit immunoglobulins. The immunoblots were developed with the Supersignal West Pico trial kit (Pierce). For quantitative analysis, the gels and blots were scanned and quantified with National Institutes of Health Image 1.62 software. Binding Assays of MalE, MglB, and HisJ—MalE and MglB were induced by adding 0.4% maltose and 1 mm fucose to the LB medium. The binding assays were done by filtration on nitrocellulose filters (Millipore HAWP, 0.45 μm) of a mixture containing 50 μl of a dialyzed periplasmic extract and one of the radioactive ligands (4 μm maltose, 320 mCi/mmol, 2 μm galactose, 170 mCi/mmol, 3 μm histidine, 420 mCi/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). The mixture was incubated for 5 min at 20 °C, and 500 μl of a saturated ammonium sulfate solution at 0 °C was added at once to the samples before filtration. The filters were rinsed three times with saturated ammonium sulfate at 0 °C and counted for radioactivity (28Richarme G. Kepes A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Reagents—All of the chemicals were from Sigma and were reagent grade. Co-precipitation of HdeA and HdeB with Protein Aggregates—In a previous report (16Kern R. Malki A. Abdallah J. Richarme G. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we observed that a large proportion (∼90%) of HdeA and HdeB remained in the 15,000 × g supernatants after acid treatment of periplasmic extracts, thus allowing efficient protein solubilization, but that significant amounts (up to 10%) of these chaperones were found in pellets containing aggregated proteins that had escaped solubilization. In the following experiment, we tested whether the aggregation of HdeA and HdeB is dependent on their chaperone activity by analyzing their solubility at different chaperone/substrate stoichiometric ratios. We incubated increasing amounts of periplasmic extracts from the hdeA disrupted mutant (containing neither HdeA nor HdeB (16Kern R. Malki A. Abdallah J. Richarme G. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar)), in the presence of a constant amount of either HdeA at pH 2 or HdeB at pH 3. As reported previously (14Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 15Hong W. Jiao W. Hu J. Zhang J. Liu C. Fu X. Shen D. Xia B. Chang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27029-27034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Kern R. Malki A. Abdallah J. Richarme G. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the presence of these acid stress chaperones markedly decreases the aggregation of periplasmic extracts; in the absence of any chaperones, the quantity of protein aggregates at pH 2 was 2.4-fold higher than in the presence of HdeA (mean value of the three couples of lanes shown in Fig. 1A), and the quantity of protein aggregates at pH 3 was 4.5-fold higher than in the presence of HdeB (mean value of the three couples of lanes shown in Fig. 1B). These quantities of aggregated proteins in the absence of chaperones represent up to 60% of the whole amount of periplasmic proteins (not shown), as reported previously (16Kern R. Malki A. Abdallah J. Richarme G. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HdeA and HdeB solubilize roughly the same proteins, as reported in Ref. 16Kern R. Malki A. Abdallah J. Richarme G. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar. Observation of the HdeA and HdeB bands in Fig. 1 (A and B), respectively, shows that increasing amounts of periplasmic extract draw increasing amounts of HdeA and HdeB into the pellet; whereas in the absence of periplasmic extract, less than 1% of HdeA and HdeB was found in the pellet, this amount rises to 6–8% in the presence of increasing amounts of periplasmic extracts. These amounts were quantified with National Institutes of Health 1.62 software and plotted as a function of the amount of periplasmic extract added to the incubation mixture; they increased up to 6-fold with increasing protein substrate (Fig. 1D). We compared the amounts of HdeA and HdeB drawn into the pellet by aggregated proteins with those of the aggregated proteins (we quantified the proteins shown in the second lanes in Fig. 1, A and B). HdeA and HdeB represent 8% (w/w) and 6% (w/w), respectively, of the quantities of aggregated substrate proteins. If we estimate, for these aggregated proteins, a mean molecular mass of 60 kDa, the amounts of HdeA (molecular mass, 9 kDa) and HdeB (molecular mass, 9 kDa) drawn into the pellet represent 60 and 40% (mol/mol), respectively, of the amount of aggregated substrate protein. Similar experiments were performed at pH 3 in the presence of both HdeA and HdeB, and increasing amounts of both chaperones were also drawn into the pellets by increasing amounts of aggregated periplasmic extracts (Fig. 1C). In this experiment chaperones represented 17% (w/w), i.e. 108% (mol/mol) of the quantity of aggregated substrate proteins. Thus, stoichiometric amounts of HdeA and HdeB are drawn into the pellet by unsolubilized substrate proteins, suggesting that HdeA and HdeB function as chaperones in insoluble protein complexes (see below). It can be noticed that, in vivo, HdeA and HdeB represent up to 8% (w/w) and 5%. (w/w), respectively, of total periplasmic protein (as estimated from the two-dimensional gel analysis of periplasmic extracts from stationary phase cells (not shown). Efficient HdeA- and HdeB-assisted Solublization at Neutral pH of Pellets Formed in Their Presence at pH 3—First, periplasmic extracts from the hdeA mutant (deficient in both HdeA and HdeB) were incubated at pH 3 for 60 min, either alone or in the presence of HdeA, HdeB, or both together. These extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 × g, and pH 3 pellets were resuspended and incubated in 30 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl for 60 min; the samples were then centrifuged at 15,000 × g, and pH 8 pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). In the absence of any chaperone, a large number of periplasmic proteins were found in the pH 3 pellet (lane 0), as reported previously, and 58% of these aggregated proteins remained insoluble (42% were solubilized) after the neutralization step (pH 8 pellet, lane 0). In contrast, when the acid treatment was carried out in the presence of HdeA (lanes A), HdeB (lanes B), or both together (lanes AB), not only were there fewer proteins in the pH 3 pellet (as reported previously (16Kern R. Malki A. Abdallah J. Richarme G. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar)), but also the majority (66, 64, and 92%, respectively) of the aggregated proteins could be solubilized at pH 8, and were found in the pH 8 supernatant. The combination of HdeA and HdeB together was the most efficient for this solubilization. Similar results were obtained using a pH 7 (instead of pH 8) resolubilization buffer (not shown), and no improvement in the solubilization of protein aggregates was observed in the presence of 1 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2 (not shown). We also studied the solubilization at neutral pH of pellets formed in the presence of a constant amount of periplasmic extract (25 μg) and increasing amounts of HdeA and HdeB both together (0, 4, 8, or 12 μg each). As shown in Fig. 2 (B and C), large amounts of both chaperones (10–15 μg each) are required for an efficient solubilization of protein aggregates. The necessity for such large amounts of chaperones for the solubilization of protein aggregates can be explained by the fact that the majority of these chaperones are committed to the solubilization of the proteins that remain in the pH 3 supernatant. Thus, HdeA, HdeB, and HdeA and HdeB together not only maintained proteins in a soluble form at pH 3 (by acting as soluble chaperones) but also helped in the solubilization at neutral pH of proteins that had aggregated in their presence at pH 3 (acting as chaperones in insoluble protein complexes). Inability of HdeA and HdeB to Solubilize Protein Aggregates when Added after the Aggregation Step—We checked whether HdeA and HdeB could solubilize at neutral pH protein aggregates formed in their absence at acidic pH. Several identical samples of a periplasmic extract from the hdeA mutant were incubated at pH 3 for 60 min. They were centrifuged at 15,000 × g, and the pH 3 pellets were resuspended and incubated for 60 min at pH 3, either alone or in the presence of HdeA, HdeB, or both together. The samples were centrifuged; the 15,000 × g pellets were resuspended in 100 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, incubated for 60 min at room temperature, centrifuged at 15,000 × g; and the pH 8 pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The quantities of protein remaining in the pH 8 pellets were similar independently of the presence of HdeA or/and HdeB (not shown). Similar negative results were obtained when the chaperones were added during the pH 8 resuspension step (not shown). Thus, HdeA and HdeB have to co-aggregate with their substrate proteins at acidic pH to function as chaperones for the disruption of these aggregates at neutral pH. Limited HdeA- and HdeB-assisted Solubilization at Neutral pH of Pellets Formed in Their Presence at pH 2—Similar experiments were done after treatment of periplasmic extracts at pH 2. In the absence of any chaperone, a large number of periplasmic proteins aggregated, as reported previously (15Hong W. Jiao W. Hu J. Zhang J. Liu C. Fu X. Shen D. Xia B. Chang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27029-27034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Kern R. Malki A. Abdallah J. Richarme G. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and the majority (76%) of these proteins remained insoluble (pH 8 pellet) after the neutralizaton step (Fig. 3). In the presence of HdeA or HdeA plus HdeB, fewer proteins aggregated at pH 2, as previously reported (16Kern R. Malki A. Abdallah J. Richarme G. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 603-610Crossr"
https://openalex.org/W2014716738,"Skeletal muscle plays a major role in glucose and lipid metabolism. Active hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is present in the extracellular matrix in skeletal muscle. However, the effects of HGF on glucose and lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle are completely unknown. We therefore examined the effects of HGF on deoxyglucose uptake (DOGU), glucose utilization, and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in skeletal muscle cells. HGF significantly enhanced DOGU in mouse soleus muscles in vitro. Furthermore, HGF significantly increased: (i) DOGU in a time- and dose-dependent manner; (ii) glucose utilization; and (iii) plasma membrane expression of Glut-1 and Glut-4 in the rat skeletal muscle model of L6 myotubes. HGF-mediated effect on DOGU was dependent on the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway. On the other hand, HGF markedly and significantly decreased FAO in L6 myotubes without affecting the activities of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and II. Collectively, these results indicate that HGF is a potent activator of glucose transport and metabolism and also a strong inhibitor of FAO in rodent myotubes. HGF, through its ability to stimulate glucose transport and metabolism and to impair FAO, may participate in the regulation of glucose disposal in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1988625078,"Loss-of-function mutations in the Parkin gene (PARK2) are responsible for the majority of autosomal recessive Parkinson disease. A growing body of evidence indicates that misfolding and aggregation of Parkin is a major mechanism of Parkin inactivation, accounting for the loss-of-function phenotype of various pathogenic Parkin mutants. Remarkably, wild-type Parkin is also prone to misfolding under certain cellular conditions, suggesting a more general role of Parkin in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. We now show that misfolding of Parkin can lead to two phenotypes: the formation of detergent-insoluble, aggregated Parkin, or destabilization of Parkin resulting in an accelerated proteasomal degradation. By combining two pathogenic Parkin mutations, we could demonstrate that destabilization of Parkin is dominant over the formation of detergent-insoluble Parkin aggregates. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with HHARI, an E3 ubiquitin ligase with an RBR domain highly homologous to that of Parkin, revealed that folding of Parkin is specifically dependent on the integrity of the C-terminal domain, but not on the presence of a putative PDZ-binding motif at the extreme C terminus.

Although most PD cases occur sporadically, familial variants share important features with sporadic PD, most notably the demise of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Consequently, insight into the function of PD-associated genes might promote our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms not only in familial, but also in sporadic PD. Five genes have unambiguously been linked to PD over the past decade, the genes encoding α-synuclein and LRRK2 for autosomal dominant PD, and those encoding Parkin, PINK1, and DJ-1 for autosomal recessive PD (reviewed in Refs. 1Farrer M.J.

So far, over a hundred different pathogenic mutations in the parkin gene have been identified, which account for the majority of autosomal recessive PD cases. Parkin is a member of the RBR (ring between ring fingers) protein family, characterized by the presence of two RING domains (really interesting new gene), which flank a cysteine-rich in-between RINGs (IBR) domain. Similarly to other RBR proteins, Parkin has an E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, mediating the attachment of ubiquitin to substrate proteins (4Imai Y. Soda M. Takahashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35661-35664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 5Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K. Chiba T. Tanaka K.

Parkin can obviously mediate different modes of ubiquitylation, including monoubiquitylation, multiple monoubiquitylation, and polyubiquitylation both via lysine 48 and lysine 63, depending on the experimental conditions and the putative Parkin substrate analyzed (reviewed in Refs. 7Moore D.J.

Importantly, the neuroprotective activity of Parkin seems to be associated with its ability to promote degradation-independent ubiquitylation (9Fallon L. Belanger C.M. Corera A.T. Kontogiannea M.

Different lines of evidence indicate that pathogenic parkin mutations result in a loss of Parkin function. Our initial studies revealed that misfolding and aggregation is characteristic for C-terminal deletion mutants of Parkin based on the following biochemical features specific for mutant Parkin: 1) insolubility in non-ionic and ionic detergents; 2) sedimentation in a sucrose step gradient; 3) resistance to a limited proteolytic digestion; 4) loss of membrane association; and 5) formation of scattered aggregates in cells determined by immunocytochemistry (11Henn I.H.

Remarkably, insoluble, catechol-modified Parkin could be detected in the substantia nigra of patients suffering from sporadic PD, suggesting a more general role of Parkin in the pathogenesis of PD (19LaVoie M.J.

In support of this concept, the E3 ligase activity of Parkin has been shown to be impaired by nitrosative stress, and there is indeed evidence for the presence of S-nitrosylated Parkin in the brains of PD patients (20Chung K.K.

Based on our finding that the deletion of C-terminal amino acids results in misfolding and aggregation of Parkin, we performed a comparative analysis of Parkin and HHARI, an E3 ubiquitin ligase with an highly homologous RBR domain. Although Parkin and HHARI share their propensity to misfold under severe oxidative stress, HHARI tolerates C-terminal deletions. However, the C-terminal domain of HHARI cannot rescue folding of C-terminally truncated Parkin. Instead, Parkin-HHARI fusion proteins are characterized by destabilization and rapid proteasomal degradation. This observation prompted us to analyze the two different phenotypes of Parkin misfolding, i.e. aggregation or destabilization, in more detail with a special focus on the specific role of the C terminus in Parkin folding. Expression Constructs, Cell Culture, and Transfections—The following constructs were described previously: wild-type (wt) human Parkin, the W453X (Δ453–465), and R42P Parkin mutant, HA-ubiquitin, and IKKγ-FLAG (11Henn I.H. Gostner J.M. Tatzelt J. Winklhofer K.F. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Winklhofer K.F. Henn I.H. Kay-Jackson P. Heller U. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47199-47208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Amino acid deletions and substitutions of Parkin were introduced by PCR cloning techniques: ΔFDV (Δ463–465), Parkin-D.m.CT (chimeric construct of human Parkin 1–450 and Drosophila Parkin 468–482), V465E, V465A, D464A, F463A, and R42P-W453X. All constructs were inserted into the pcDNA3.1 plasmid. The cDNA of HHARI was amplified by PCR from the RZPD clone IRATp970D0877D with the following primer pair: forward 5′-GCGGCTGAATTCGGATGGACTCGGACGAGGGCTAC-3′, reverse 5′-GGAGGCGGCCGCTCAGTCCTCAATGTACTCCCACAG-3′. The amplified fragment was digested with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and NotI and cloned into the pCMV-HA vector to obtain an N-terminally HA-tagged cDNA of HHARI. A C-terminal HHARI deletion mutant (Δ377–557) was generated using PCR cloning techniques, as well as fusion proteins of Parkin and HHARI: Parkin 1–449/HHARI 376–557 (449/376), Parkin 1–453/HHARI 379–557 (453/379), and Parkin 1–453/HHARI 395–557 (453/395). The plasmids encoding enhanced yellow fluorescent protein and cyan fluorescent protein (control protein) were purchased from Clontech. SH-SY5Y (German Resource Centre for Biological Material number ACC 209) and HEK293T (ATCC number CRL-1573) cells were cultivated and transfected with Lipofectamine/Plus (Invitrogen) as described earlier. Antibodies and Reagents—The following antibodies were used: anti-Parkin rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) hP1 (12Winklhofer K.F. Henn I.H. Kay-Jackson P. Heller U. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47199-47208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), anti-Parkin pAb #4230 (Cell Signaling), anti-Parkin mouse monoclonal antibody PRK8 (mAb, Millipore) anti-HA (mAb, Roche Applied Science), anti-active caspase-3 pAb (Promega, Madison, WI), Alexa 555-conjugated goat anti-rabbit pAb, anti-FLAG M2-HRP mAb, anti-HA-HRP mAb, anti-β-actin mAb (Sigma), anti-transferrin-receptor mAb (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mAb (Ambion), anti-LDH pAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-GFP mAb (BD Biosciences), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse, and anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Promega). Kainate was purchased from Calbiochem, and complete protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked with blocking solution containing 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with the primary antibody in blocking solution for 16 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing with TBS-T, the membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 40 min at room temperature. Following washing with TBS-T, the antigen was detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Detergent Solubility Assay—As described earlier (22Tatzelt J. Prusiner S.B. Welch W.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6363-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), transfected cells were harvested and lysed in detergent buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 or 0.5% Triton X-100/0.5% sodium deoxycholate in PBS). After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, supernatant and pellet fractions were separated. The pellet fraction was washed with lysis buffer and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer in a volume equal to the supernatant. To compare the relative distribution of the protein of interest, equal percentages of detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. Metabolic Labeling of Cellular Proteins—Cells were starved for 30 min in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and then labeled with 300 μCi/ml Pro-mix l-[35S] in vitro cell label mix (Amersham Biosciences) in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h (pulse). When indicated, the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (Calbiochem) was present during the pulse and chase periods. For the chase, labeling medium was removed, and cells were washed twice and then incubated in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h. Radiolabeled cells were lysed in detergent buffer and fractionated into detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions as described above. The supernatants were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Pierce) for 30 min, the primary antibody hP1 was added, and the samples were incubated at 4 °C for 16 h. The antigen-antibody complexes were captured by the addition of immobilized protein A and then washed three times with detergent buffer. Proteins present in the immunoprecipitates were released from the protein A-Sepharose by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer containing 1% SDS and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were impregnated with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed to film. Ubiquitylation Assay—Parkin or Parkin mutants, HA-ubiquitin, and when indicated IKKγ-FLAG were co-transfected in HEK293T cells. One day after transfection, protein lysates were prepared in denaturing lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 15 units/ml DNase I, and protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. Protein extracts were diluted 1:10 with non-denaturing lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture). Immunoprecipitation of Parkin was performed with hP1 pAb followed by an incubation with protein A beads (Pierce); immunoprecipitation of IKKγ-FLAG was performed with M2 FLAG-agarose (Sigma). Immunoprecipitated proteins and input samples were analyzed by Western blotting using the antibodies indicated. Immunocytochemistry and Fluorescence Microscopy—SH-SY5Y or HEK293T cells were grown on glass coverslips, transfected, fixed 1 day after transfection in 3% paraformaldehyde/sucrose in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Fixed cells were incubated with primary antibody (diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin and 10% goat serum) for 1 h at room temperature. After washes with PBS, the coverslips were incubated with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, cells were embedded in Mowiol mounting medium (Calbiochem). Images were obtained on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Membrane Fractionation—Transfected cells were harvested, incubated in hypo-osmotic buffer, and Dounce homogenized. After a low speed spin the homogenate was mixed with 60% iodixanol (Optiprep, Axis Shield) to obtain a final iodixanol concentration of 40%. The mixture was overlaid in a SW55 tube with 2.5 ml of 28% iodixanol diluted with TNE (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and 1 ml TNE on top. After ultracentrifugation in an MLS 50 swing-out rotor (Beckman) at 165,000 × g for 3 h, fractions were collected from top to bottom. Aliquots of these fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. Fractionation of Mouse Brain Tissue—Mouse brains were isolated from 2-month-old mice, homogenized with 10 strokes in a glass potter in hypotonic buffer (20 mm citrate, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mix). The tissue was further processed by a step of freeze-thaw using liquid nitrogen. After addition of 1% Brij-53 (Pierce), homogenates were low spin centrifuged to yield a post-nuclear supernatant. Glycerol was added to the post-nuclear supernatant to a final concentration of 5%. An ultracentrifugation step of 130,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C resulted in a cytosolic fraction and a membrane fraction. The membrane fraction was resuspended in hypotonic buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and ultracentrifuged for another 30 min. The supernatant and cytosolic fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. Apoptosis Assay—Activation of caspase-3 was determined as described previously (23Rambold A.S. Miesbauer M. Rapaport D. Bartke T. Baier M. Winklhofer K.F. Tatzelt J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3356-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, SH-SY5Y cells were grown on glass coverslips. 24 h after transfection, cells were incubated with kainate (500 μm) for 3 h. The cells were then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Fixed cells were incubated with anti-active caspase-3 antibody overnight at 4 °C, washed, and incubated with Alexa 555-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, cells were mounted onto glass slides and examined by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axioscope 2 plus microscope. To detect cells undergoing apoptosis, the number of activated caspase-3-positive cells out of at least 300 transfected cells was determined. Quantifications were based on at least three independent experiments. Stress Treatment and Proteasomal Inhibition—To induce oxidative stress, transfected cells were incubated with 10 or 20 mm H2O2 in PBS for 30 min, harvested, and lysed in detergent buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100/sodium deoxycholate in PBS. For inhibition of the proteasome, cells were treated with 5 μm MG132 (Calbiochem) for 16 h or 30 μm for 1 h during metabolic labeling. Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as means ± S.E. All transfections were performed in triplicates and repeated at least three times. Quantification of Western blots was performed with the FluoChem 8900 detection system and the Alpha Ease FC software. Statistical analysis among groups was performed using one-way analysis of variance. p values were <0.05. HHARI Is Sensitive to Stress-induced Misfolding but Tolerates C-terminal Deletions—Another E3 ubiquitin ligase harboring an RBR domain is encoded by the human homologue of Drosophila ariadne (HHARI) gene. In comparison to Parkin, HHARI contains a glycine-rich region but lacks the N-terminal UBL domain (Fig. 1A). Recently, the solution structure of HHARI RING2 was determined by NMR studies, revealing a distinct topology of RING2 from classic RINGs (24Capili A.D. Edghill E.L. Wu K. Borden K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 1117-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Based on the high sequence homology of RING2 between HHARI and Parkin, Capili and coworkers proposed a similar fold for Parkin RING2. To test whether the propensity of Parkin to misfold is a common feature of RBR proteins or a unique feature of Parkin, we generated a deletion mutant of HHARI (HHARI P378X), which was truncated behind the RBR domain, similarly to the pathogenic Parkin W453X mutant. A detergent solubility assay after expression of the mutants in HEK293T cells revealed that in comparison to wild-type (wt) HHARI there was no significant increase in the detergent-insoluble fraction when P378X was analyzed (Fig. 1B, right panel). In contrast, the Parkin W453X mutant almost quantitatively adopted an insoluble conformation under the same conditions (Fig. 1B, left panel), indicating that HHARI is significantly less sensitive to C-terminal truncations. Next we analyzed the propensity of Parkin and HHARI to misfold under severe oxidative stress. HEK293T cells transiently expressing wt Parkin or wt HHARI were subjected to hydrogen peroxide treatment and analyzed by the detergent solubility assay. As shown in Fig. 1C, high level oxidative stress induced the misfolding of both Parkin and HHARI, whereas yellow fluorescent protein was not affected under the same conditions. In conclusion, Parkin and HHARI share the sensitivity to stress-induced misfolding, which seems to be attributable to the cysteine-rich RBR domain. The arrangement of cysteines within RING domains is crucial to stabilize the native conformation, thus oxidation of critical cysteine residues will result in a collapse of the tertiary structure. However, the sensitivity to C-terminal deletions seems to be specific to Parkin. The C-terminal Portion Adjacent to RING2 of HHARI Cannot Replace That of Parkin—To better understand the role of the C terminus in Parkin folding, we addressed the question of whether the C-terminal domain distal to RING2 of HHARI can compensate for the folding defect of C-terminally truncated Parkin. The rationale of this approach was the observation that folding of non-classic RING domains extends into the adjacent C-terminal region to stabilize RING2 (24Capili A.D. Edghill E.L. Wu K. Borden K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 1117-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Because RING2 of Parkin and HHARI are supposed to share the tertiary structure, it is conceivable that the C-terminal domain of HHARI allows stabilization of Parkin RING2. To address this possibility experimentally, we generated three Parkin-HHARI chimeric constructs, differing in the length of either the Parkin or HHARI fragment (449/376, 453/379, and 453/395, Fig. 1D). HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with the chimeric constructs and analyzed by a detergent solubility assay 1 day after transfection. Surprisingly, we could not detect either of the chimeric proteins in a Western blot analysis. To test the possibility of an increased proteasomal degradation of the chimeric proteins, we performed pulse/chase experiments in 449/376-expressing cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and analyzed the chimeric protein by immunoprecipitation. Indeed, >50% of the chimeric protein was degraded during the pulse (60 min), and after a chase of 60 min the protein could only be detected in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 1E). We then repeated the Western blot analysis and incubated the transfected cells in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 for 16 h. It turned out that the chimeric proteins could be stabilized by MG132, but all of them were present in a predominantly detergent-insoluble conformation (Fig. 1F). Thus, the C-terminal domain of HHARI could not compensate for the folding defect observed for C-terminal deletion mutants of Parkin. Moreover, replacement of the C-terminal domain of Parkin next to RING2 by that of HHARI not only induced the formation of detergent-insoluble Parkin, but also led to a destabilization of the chimeric protein. These observations indicate that the C-terminal domain of Parkin exerts an essential and specific function in folding and stabilization of Parkin. Misfolding of Pathogenic Parkin Mutants Can Lead to Aggregation or Destabilization of Parkin—The destabilization of Parkin-HHARI fusion proteins reminded us of some pathogenic Parkin mutants, which are also characterized by an accelerated proteasomal degradation. We reported previously that missense mutations within the N-terminal UBL domain induce a destabilization of Parkin (11Henn I.H. Gostner J.M. Tatzelt J. Winklhofer K.F. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We now wondered whether this destabilization might be another manifestation of Parkin misfolding. To test this possibility, we expressed the R42P Parkin mutant in the absence and in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. Indeed, the larger Parkin species (52 kDa), which comprises the UBL and thus the pathogenic mutation, was only detectable in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor and predominantly occurred in the detergent-insoluble fraction (Fig. 2A). Please note that the smaller Parkin species (42 kDa) is generated due to the presence of an internal translation initiation site at codon 80, consequently, the smaller Parkin species lacks the UBL domain (11Henn I.H. Gostner J.M. Tatzelt J. Winklhofer K.F. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This experiment indicated that the R42P mutant is degraded by the proteasome, because it obviously does not adopt a native conformation, similarly to the chimeric Parkin-HHARI constructs. Given that the formation of relatively stable detergent-insoluble aggregates is also a consequence of Parkin misfolding, exemplified by C-terminal deletion mutants and various point mutants, we asked which phenotype of Parkin misfolding might be dominant over the other. To this end, we generated the R42P-W453X double Parkin mutant. To facilitate the interpretation of the results, the internal translation initiation site, i.e. methionine at position 80 was replaced by threonine, which occurs at position 80 in murine Parkin. Remarkably, the R42P-W453X double Parkin mutant could be detected only in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 in an almost exclusively detergent-insoluble conformation, indicating that destabilization of Parkin is dominant over the formation of stable aggregates (Fig. 2A). In line with the detergent solubility assay, immunofluorescence experiments performed with SH-SY5Y cells showed typical scattered aggregates of the W453X Parkin mutant, but almost no expression of the R42P-W453X double Parkin mutant under steady state conditions (Fig. 2B). The weak staining of R42P-expressing cells can be explained by the presence of the smaller Parkin species, which lacks the R42P mutation and therefore is not misfolded. We used SH-SY5Y cells for immunocytochemistry, because HEK293T cells display a disadvantageous nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio for the analysis of cytosolic proteins. To provide evidence that the misfolding phenotype of Parkin mutants is not a cell type-specific phenomenon, we performed immunofluorescence experiments also in HEK293T cells and detergent solubility assays in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 2C). The Putative PDZ-binding Motif at the C Terminus Is Dispensable for Parkin Folding—In previous studies we showed that pathogenic C-terminal truncations lead to misfolding and aggregation of Parkin (11Henn I.H. Gostner J.M. Tatzelt J. Winklhofer K.F. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Winklhofer K.F. Henn I.H. Kay-Jackson P. Heller U. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47199-47208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the deletion of three C-terminal amino acids was sufficient to drastically interfere with the native folding of Parkin, leading to the formation of detergent-insoluble, aggregated Parkin (Fig. 3A). It has been suggested that the three amino acids (FDV) at the extreme C terminus of Parkin function as a PDZ-binding motif, which can mediate an interaction with the PDZ domain-containing proteins CASK and PICK1 (25Fallon L. Moreau F. Croft B.G. Labib N. Gu W.J. Fon E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 486-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 26Joch M. Ase A.R. Chen C.X. MacDonald P.A. Kontogiannea M. Corera A.T. Brice A. Seguela P. Fon E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3105-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We therefore addressed the question of whether this motif is necessary for Parkin to obtain or stabilize its native conformation. Interestingly, whereas other functional domains of Parkin, such as the UBL, RING1, RING2, and the IBR, are highly conserved between species, the FDV motif is present only in mammalian species, but not in non-mammalian vertebrates (Gallus gallus, Fugu rubripes, and Danio rerio) or non-vertebrates (Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, and Caenorhabditis elegans, Fig. 3B). The FDV sequence of Parkin falls into the class II PDZ-binding motif Φ-X-Φ, where Φ is a hydrophobic amino acid and X is any amino acid. To destroy the putative PDZ-binding motif, we replaced valine at position 465 by glutamic acid (V465E), a mutation that has been reported previously to disrupt PDZ-dependent interactions (27Penzes P.

https://openalex.org/W2035735370,"Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) is an essential adaptor protein in the formation of a multiprotein complex that activates procaspase-1. ASC is also known as a modulator of NF-kappaB activation pathways. ASC has a bipartite domain structure, consisting of an N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD) and a C-terminal caspase-recruitment domain. The PYD of ASC (ASC_PYD) is known to interact with various PYD-containing intracellular danger signal sensors and PYD-only proteins. Using purified proteins, we characterized the in vitro interaction of ASC_PYD with PYD-only protein 1 (POP1). POP1 specifically interacts with ASC_PYD with a dissociation constant of 4.08 +/- 0.52 microm but does not interact with Cryopyrin. NMR and mutagenesis experiments show that a negative electrostatic potential surface patch (EPSP) on ASC_PYD, consisting of the first (H1) and fourth (H4) helices, is essential in the interaction with POP1. A positive EPSP on POP1, consisting of the second (H2) and third (H3) helices, is a counterpart of this interaction. The interaction between ASC_PYD and POP1 is similar to the interaction between caspase recruitment domains of Apaf-1 and procaspase-9. In addition, we present evidence that conformational changes at the long loop of ASC_PYD between the H2 and H3 helices can affect its interaction with POP1. Based on our observations, we propose that the positive EPSP of ASC_PYD, including the H2 and H3 helices, may be the binding site for Cryopyrin, and the interaction with Cryopyrin may induce the dissociation of POP1 from ASC_PYD."
https://openalex.org/W2091822266,"Dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) is critical for proper mineralization of tooth dentin, and mutations in DSPP cause inherited dentin defects. Dentin phosphoprotein (DPP) is the C-terminal cleavage product of DSPP that binds collagen and induces intrafibrillar mineralization. We isolated DPP from individual pigs and determined that its N-terminal and C-terminal domains are glycosylated and that DPP averages 155 phosphates per molecule. Porcine DPP is unstable at low pH and high temperatures, and complexing with collagen improves its stability. Surprisingly, we observed DPP size variations on SDS-PAGE for DPP isolated from individual pigs. These variations are not caused by differences in proteolytic processing or degrees of phosphorylation or glycosylation, but rather to allelic variations in Dspp. Characterization of the DPP coding region identified 4 allelic variants. Among the 4 alleles, 27 sequence variations were identified, including 16 length polymorphisms ranging from 3 to 63 nucleotides. None of the length variations shifted the reading frame, and all localized to the highly redundant region of the DPP code. The 4 alleles encode DPP domains having 551, 575, 589, or 594 amino acids and completely explain the DPP size variations. DPP length variations are polymorphic and are not associated with dentin defects."
https://openalex.org/W2083149818,"We here describe the generation of novel, green fluorescent protein-based Ca(2+) indicators targeted to the peroxisome lumen. We show that (i) the Ca(2+) concentration of peroxisomes in living cells at rest is similar to that of the cytosol; (ii) increases in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration (elicited by either Ca(2+) mobilization from stores or Ca(2+) influx through plasma membrane Ca(2+) channels) are followed by a slow rise in intraperoxisomal [Ca(2+)]; (iii) Ca(2+) influx into peroxisomes is driven neither by an ATP-dependent pump nor by membrane potential nor by a H(+)(Na(+)) gradient. The peroxisomal membrane appears to play a low pass filter role, preventing the organelle from taking up shortlasting cytosolic Ca(2+) transients but allowing equilibration of the peroxisomal luminal [Ca(2+)] with that of the cytosol during prolonged Ca(2+) increases. Thus, peroxisomes appear to be an additional cytosolic Ca(2+) buffer, but their influx and efflux mechanisms are unlike those of any other cellular organelle."
https://openalex.org/W2151058276,"In bacteria most secretory proteins are transported across the plasma membrane by the interplay of the ATPase SecA with the translocation channel formed by the SecY complex; SecA uses cycles of ATP hydrolysis to ""push"" consecutive segments of a polypeptide substrate through the channel. Here we have addressed the mechanism of this process by following the fate of stalled translocation intermediates. These were generated by using a polypeptide substrate containing a bulky disulfide-bonded loop, thus preventing the final residues from passing through the channel. Protease protection experiments showed that the intermediates were stable in the presence of ATP and could complete translocation once the block was removed. The translocation intermediate was also stable when SecA associated with ATPgammaS, a poorly hydrolyzable ATP analog, or ADP plus AlF(4), which mimics the transition state during ATP hydrolysis. In contrast, when SecA was in its ADP-bound state, the translocating polypeptide moved back into the cytosol, as indicated by the disappearance of the protected fragment. Backsliding was not significantly altered by deletion of the plug domain, a short helix in the center of the SecY channel, but it was slowed down when changes were introduced into the pore ring, the constriction of the hourglass-shaped channel. In all cases, backsliding was significantly slower than forward translocation. Together, these data suggest that SecA binds the polypeptide chain in its ATP state and releases it in the ADP state. The channel itself does not bind the polypeptide chain but provides ""friction"" that minimizes backsliding when ADP-bound SecA resets to ""grab"" the next segment of the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1965262675,"We previously reported that phospholipase C-δ1 (PLC-δ1) accumulates in the nucleus at the G1/S transition, which is largely dependent on its binding to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (Stallings, J. D., Tall, E. G., Pentyala, S., and Rebecchi, M. J. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 22060-22069 ). Here, using small interfering RNA (siRNA) that specifically targets rat PLC-δ1, we investigated whether this enzyme plays a role in cell cycle control. Inhibiting expression of PLC-δ1 significantly decreased proliferation of rat C6 glioma cells and altered S phase progression. [3H]Thymidine labeling and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis indicated that the rates of G1/S transition and DNA synthesis were enhanced. On the other hand, knockdown cultures released from the G1/S boundary were slower to reach full G2/M DNA content, consistent with a delay in S phase. The levels of cyclin E, a key regulator of the G1/S transition and DNA synthesis, were elevated in asynchronous cultures as well as those blocked at the G1/S boundary. Epifluorescence imaging showed that transient expression of human phospholipase C-δ1, resistant to these siRNA, suppressed expression of cyclin E at the G1/S boundary despite treatment of cultures with rat-specific siRNA. Although whole cell levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate were unchanged, suppression of PLC-δ1 led to a significant rise in the nuclear levels of this phospholipid at the G1/S boundary. These results support a role for PLC-δ1 and nuclear phospholipid metabolism in regulating cell cycle progression.

Cell. 1998; 9: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) is embryonic lethal. Although PLCδ1 is not essential, homozygous deletion in mice results in aberrant expression of terminal differentiation markers in several types of skin cells as well as the development of alopecia and spontaneous skin tumors (21Nakamura Y. Fukami K. Yu H. Takenaka K. Kataoka Y. Shirakata Y. Nishikawa S. Hashimoto K. Yoshida N. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2981-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These effects appear to result from increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines (22Nakamura Y. Ichinohe M. Hirata M. Matsuura H. Fujiwara T. Igarashi T. Nakahara M. Yamaguchi H. Yasugi S.

Mice that lack both PLCδ1 and PLCδ3, however, die between embryonic days 11.5 and 13.5 due to abnormal cellular proliferation and apoptosis in placental trophoblasts (23Nakamura Y. Hamada Y.

The extents to which these phenotypes are displayed depend on the genetic background of each yeast strain, suggesting that plc1-1 modulates complex multigene processes having significant redundancies. Transformation of these yeast mutants with rat PLCδ1 can rescue growth defects (26Yoko-o T. Matsui Y. Yagisawa H. Nojima H. Uno I. Toh-e A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, overexpression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, SPL1 or SPL2, rescues these same defects (27Flick J.S. Thorner J. Genetics. 1998; 148: 33-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that PLC1 is somehow linked to cell cycle regulation.Yagisawa et al. (28Yagisawa H. Sakuma K. Paterson H.F. Cheung R. Allen V.

Chem. 1998; 273: 417-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) first reported that PLCδ1 harbored both nuclear export and import sequences that contribute to its shuttling between the cytoplasm and nucleus. We have demonstrated that PLCδ1 accumulates in the nucleus at the G1/S boundary in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and C6 glioma (1Stallings J.D. Tall E.G. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22060-22069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and many of these observations have been confirmed (29Yagisawa H. J. Cell Biochem. 2006; 97: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Here we set out to determine whether this protein plays a role in the cell cycle. We find that suppression of PLCδ1 increases cyclin E levels, alters S phase progression, and inhibits cell proliferation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSynchrony, Flow Cytometry, and Cell Cycle Analysis—Rat C6 glioma cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum and 1 mm penicillin and streptomycin (all supplements from Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. To synchronize cells to the G1/S boundary, adherent glioma cells were twice blocked with 2 mm thymidine (1Stallings J.D. Tall E.G. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22060-22069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were washed with RPMI 1640 and incubated in growth medium supplemented with 2 mm thymidine for 12 h, washed three times with growth medium, and incubated for an additional 10 h without thymidine. Cultures were again blocked with 2 mm thymidine for an additional 12 h. To release them from G1/S block, cells were washed three times in RPMI 1640 and fed normal growth medium. To analyze DNA content, cells were harvested by treatment with trypsin/EDTA, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.0 mm calcium chloride and 2.0 mm magnesium chloride (PBS-CaMg), and fixed in 70% ethanol in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% fetal bovine serum at 4 °C overnight (1Stallings J.D. Tall E.G. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22060-22069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To stain DNA, ethanolfixed glia were incubated in PBS with 50 mm citrate buffer, 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, and 50 μg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C (1Stallings J.D. Tall E.G. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22060-22069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After washing with PBS, cell cycle analysis was immediately performed using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACScan; BD Biosciences). Histogram data were analyzed using the program Cychlred and the Origin 7.5 (OriginLab Corp.) peak fit module.siRNA, Expression Plasmids, and Cell Transfection—We targeted the mRNA sequence 151-172 bp (5′-ggA CCC Cag gCC gCU Cgg TT-3′) of rat PLCδ1 and designed and synthesized a corresponding duplexed siRNA (Proligo) based on previously described protocols (30Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8075) Google Scholar, 31Tuschl T. Hannon G. J RNAi: A Guide to Gene Silencing. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2003: 280-288Google Scholar). For these experiments, C6 glioma cells were plated on plastic tissue culture dishes or #1.0 borosilicate chambered glass coverslips (Nalge Nunc International) coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma). Cells were transfected with PLCδ1-specific siRNA (δ1-siRNA) or a commercially available nonspecific control C-siRNA (Ambion), ranging from 0.01 to 320 nm, using FuGene6 (Roche Applied Science) or RNAiMax (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. Three commercially available rat PLCδ1-specific siRNAs (Ambion numbers 200652, 49731, and 49541; designated here as siRNA1, siRNA2, and siRNA3, respectively) were also tested for their capacity to knock down expression, and the resulting phenotypes were also assessed. In some experiments, siRNA was delivered with human PLCδ1 fused to enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP), at ∼0.28 μg DNA/cm2, in the same FuGene6 transfection. These expression vectors have been previously described (1Stallings J.D. Tall E.G. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22060-22069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).siRNA transfection efficiency using the Fugene6 or RNAiMax reagents was found to be nearly 100% as assessed using a fluorescently labeled, short double-stranded RNA (Block-It, AlexaFluor Red; Invitrogen). On the other hand, plasmid transfection efficiency using either Fugene6 or FugeneHD (Roche Applied Science) rarely exceeded 25% whether using plasmids encoding the PLC-δ1 EGFP fusion protein or EGFP itself.Cell Proliferation and Viability Assays—To estimate the rate of growth in the presence or absence of δ1-siRNA, C6 glioma were plated at densities of 1 × 103 to 1.5 × 105 cells/2-cm2 well and allowed to grow for several days; cell numbers were determined every 24 h with a hemocytometer, and growth rate constants were estimated with the following equation, GR = (ln(nf/ni)/t), where ni = initial cell number, nf = final cell number, and t = time (h). Trypan blue (Invitrogen) was used to determine whether cell membrane integrity was compromised as a result of siRNA treatment. Viability was also assessed using XTT (Biological Industries), which is metabolized to the colored formazin product in the mitochondria (32Scudiero D.A. Shoemaker R.H. Paull K.D. Monks A. Tierney S. Nofziger T.H. Currens M.J. Seniff D. Boyd M.R. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4827-4833PubMed Google Scholar). During these procedures, C6 glioma cells were cultured in an equivalent medium lacking phenol red. XTT (1 mg/ml) was prepared in serum-free medium containing phenazine methylsulfate (1.53 mg/ml), which stimulates mitochondrial metabolism of XTT (32Scudiero D.A. Shoemaker R.H. Paull K.D. Monks A. Tierney S. Nofziger T.H. Currens M.J. Seniff D. Boyd M.R. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4827-4833PubMed Google Scholar). 100 μl of XTT/phenazine methylsulfate reagent was transferred to each well containing 400 μl of medium and incubated for 1 h. The conditioned medium from each well was then collected, and the absorbance was measured at 475 nm.SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Each 35-mm dish of monolayer cells was washed twice, with 2 ml each of warm PBS-CaMg. Soluble cellular proteins were then extracted with 0.5 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer (200 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1% mammalian anti-protease mixture (Sigma)) and incubated for 5 min at 4 °C. The cells were gently scraped up with a rubber policeman and transferred to 1.7-ml Eppendorf tubes. Using this method, the nuclei remained intact, and little of the cellular DNA was extruded. These samples were then subjected to centrifugation at 1000 × g for 4 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fluids were transferred to new tubes. A portion of each sample was removed for determination of protein concentration. Protein concentration was determined via Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. An equal volume of acetone at -20 °C was then added to the remaining samples, which were then incubated at -20 °C for at least 30 min. Following centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min, the pellets were washed once with -20 °C acetone/water (1:1, v/v) and dried under vacuum. The dried samples were dissolved in SDS sample buffer to a concentration of 1-2 μg of protein/μl. Samples containing equal concentrations of total protein were separated in an 8% or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) using a Trans Blot semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad) at 14 V for 1.5 h. The blot was then blocked with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 60 min at room temperature. The membrane was incubated in solution containing anti-PLCδ1 S-11-2 monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or anti-PLCδ1 polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-cyclin E polyclonal, anti-cyclin A monoclonal, or anti-β-tubulin polyclonal antibody (Invitrogen). The membrane was incubated with secondary antibody solution containing either goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (H + L)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad). Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus; Amersham Biosciences/GE HealthCare) was used to detect the binding of the secondary antibody following the manufacturer's protocol. The membranes were imaged using a CCD camera (Eastman Kodak Co.).[3H]Thymidine Incorporation Assay—C6 glioma cells were transfected with either 160 nm control C-siRNA or PLCδ1-specific siRNA and grown in 24-well plates. 48-72 h post-transfection, cultures were washed with PBS-CaMg and incubated in 0.5 ml of RPMI 1640 (7.5% fetal bovine serum, 1% phosphatidylserine) containing 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for 2.5 h (a measure of the number of cells synthesizing nascent DNA, (33Nebigil C.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15949-15958Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)). Alternatively, cultures were transfected and synchronized to the G1/S boundary as described above and then labeled with [3H]thymidine following their release from G1/S block (rate of thymidine incorporation). In each experiment, a portion of each culture was used to determine cell number. Incorporated [3H]thymidine was precipitated with 500 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid on ice for 20 min. The precipitate was washed twice with 500 μl of each of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Finally, pellets were dissolved with 200 μl of 0.1 n NaOH for 15 min and transferred to a vial containing 4 ml of scintillation fluid and counted in a liquid scintillation spectrometer.Epifluorescence Microscopy and Indirect Immunofluorescence—Cell monolayers were rinsed once in PBS-CaMg and then fixed with freshly prepared 3.7% (w/v) formaldehyde solution (Fisher) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were then washed three times in TBS for 5 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) in TBS for 5 min at room temperature. The detergent solution was replaced with blocking solution (TBS containing 5% goat serum (Pierce)) for 30 min at room temperature and then replaced with primary antibody solution (1:200; rabbit anti-cyclin E in TBS with 1% goat serum) overnight at 4 °C. Samples were washed three times in 1 ml of TBS for 7 min each and then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) conjugate Texas Red (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:3000 in TBS containing 1% goat serum. Each well was then washed three times in TBS for 7 min each. Indirect immunofluorescence of PLCδ1 was performed as previously described (1Stallings J.D. Tall E.G. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22060-22069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells incubated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (5 μg/ml) for 5 min to assess the percentage of nuclei that appeared apoptotic. Images were captured with an AxioCam 330mA 12-bit CCD camera (Zeiss) and viewed with Carl Zeiss Axovision 3.1 software. Alternatively, fixed cells were visualized by epifluorescence microscopy (Olympus IMT-2 inverted microscope with a 100-watt mercury arc lamp), and images were taken with a Nikon Plan Fluor ×40 oil objective (numerical aperture 1.3) and Olympix AstroCam (LSR). These images were processed and analyzed with Esprit imaging software (LSR). To assess the fraction of cells (scored positive or negative) having nicked DNA as a result of siRNA treatments, an in situ TUNEL Assay Cell Death Detection kit (Roche Applied Science) was used according to the manufacturer's directions.Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from siRNA-treated C6 cultures using an RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Following purification, 0.1-1 μg of total RNA was first heated to 70 °C in the presence of random hexanucleotide primers. The RNA was then transferred to Ready-to-Go reverse transcription-PCR beads (GE Healthcare) and incubated at 42 °C for 30 min. Following the reverse transcription step, cyclin E primers (5′-GTGAAAAGCGAGGATAGCAG-3′;5′-TGTTGTGATGCCATGTAACG-3′) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers were added, and the reactions were cDNA-amplified (18-26 cycles) in a Gene AMP PCR System 2000 thermocycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with each cycle programmed for 95 °C melting for 0.5 min, 55 °C annealing for 0.5 min, and 72 °C extension for 1 min. The reaction products were separated on a 2% agarose gel that was subsequently stained with SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Images were recorded using a Kodak Gel Imager system, and the fluorescent bands were quantified using the Kodak gel analysis software. The cyclin E mRNA levels were normalized to expression of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase amplicon in each sample.Subcellular Fractionation and Lipid Analysis—Nuclei were purified as previously described (1Stallings J.D. Tall E.G. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22060-22069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Following siRNA treatment for 24 h, cultures were synchronized to the G1/S boundary and labeled with 10 μCi/ml [3H]myoinositol for at least 24 h. In some cases, cultures were released from G1/S block for 3 h prior to lipid extraction. Labeled cultures were rinsed with ice-cold PBS-CaMg and then treated briefly with PBS containing 1 mm EDTA to release them from the plastic dishes. The released cells were then subjected to centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were promptly resuspended in 500 μl of prechilled hypotonic resuspension buffer (RSB; 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) on ice for 7 min. Swollen cells were then transferred to a Dounce homogenizer and lysed by 20 strokes of the glass pestle. Nuclei and debris were then layered onto a sucrose cushion (320 mm sucrose, 7.7 mm MgCl2, 2.1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 300 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed twice with 0.5 ml of RSB and resuspended in 750 μl of methanol, 0.1 m HCl (v/v, 1:1), placed in silicanized borosilicate glass tubes, and mixed vigorously for 30 s. The lipids were subsequently extracted as previously described (1Stallings J.D. Tall E.G. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22060-22069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Lipid extracts were applied to prescored Linear KD silica plates (Whatman) that had been pretreated with 40% methanol, 1% potassium oxalate, and 1 mm EGTA in water and heat-activated. The solvent system used was chloroform/methanol/water/concentrated ammonium hydroxide (v/v/v/v; 60:47:11.3:2) (1Stallings J.D. Tall E.G. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22060-22069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Areas corresponding to migration of phosphoinositide, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, and PI(4,5) P2 standards were scraped into vials containing 100 μl of a mixture of methanol and 10% Nonidet P-40 in water (v/v, 1:1). 4 ml of scintillation fluid (EcoLite) was added to each vial and mixed, and the vials were counted in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. Counts/min values were normalized to total lipid phase-extractable phosphorus.Statistical Analysis—All statistical analyses were preformed in GraphPad Prism. To determine the significance of the differences between mean values, one-way analysis of variance with Newman-Keul's post-test or Student's t test was used where appropriate (***, p < 0.001; **, p <0.01; *, p < 0.05). Fisher's exact test was used to analyze the frequency data obtained from indirect immunofluorescence images.RESULTSsiRNA-mediated Knockdown of PLCδ1 in Rat C6 Glioma Inhibits Proliferation—RNA interference is a sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism that suppresses synthesis of a specific protein by degrading the mRNA encoding a target protein (30Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8075) Google Scholar, 31Tuschl T. Hannon G. J RNAi: A Guide to Gene Silencing. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2003: 280-288Google Scholar, 34Huppi K. Martin S.E. Caplen N.J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We identified a candidate site within the rat PLCδ1 mRNA coding sequence (residues 152-172) and designed a specific RNA duplex (δ1-siRNA). In addition, we purchased three unique siRNA duplexes predicted to suppress expression of rat PLCδ1.Treatment of C6 glioma cultures with δ1-siRNA reduced the levels of PLCδ1 by >80% by 72 h compared with control siRNA or untreated cultures (Fig. 1A). This was associated with reduced cell numbers. Under our transfection conditions, the significant changes in the apparent growth rates (Fig. 1B, inset) were well correlated with reduced expression of PLCδ1 (see Fig. 1A (δ1-siRNA1), and see supplemental Fig. 1A). Commercially available siRNA1 and siRNA3, greatly reduced expression of rat PLCδ1, whereas siRNA2 was less effective (Fig. 1C). Suppression of cell proliferation mirrored their effects on PLCδ1 levels (Fig. 1D; see supplemental Fig. 1A), supporting the idea that slower growth is a specific effect of PLCδ1 suppression. As the knockdown experiments progressed, it became evident that siRNA3 rapidly reduced PLCδ1 levels and profoundly and rapidly reduced the fraction of cells synthesizing DNA by 48 h following treatment. In order to provide a sufficient time window for measuring the relevant cell cycle variables, we compared δ1-siRNA and siRNA1 in further studies, since these siRNAs took longer to suppress PLC-δ1 expression.To address the possibility that the apparent decrease in proliferation was due to an increased rate of cell death, we investigated the cytotoxicity of the various siRNA and whether treatment with these reagents induced apoptosis. Trypan blue staining revealed no significant differences between control and δ1-siRNA treatments up to 72 h post-transfection (Fig. 2A).

https://openalex.org/W1990532343,"Previously we have shown that THP-1 cells synthesize matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) where a fraction of the enzyme is strongly linked to a proteoglycan (PG) core protein. In the present work we show that these pro-MMP-9·PG heteromers have different biochemical properties compared with the monomeric form of pro-MMP-9. In these heteromers, the fibronectin II-like domain in the catalytic site of the enzyme is hidden, and the fibronectin II-like-mediated binding to gelatin and collagen is prevented. However, a fraction of the pro-MMP-9·PG heteromers interacted with gelatin and collagen. This interaction was not through the chondroitin sulfate (CS) part of the PG molecule but, rather, through a region in the PG core protein, a new site induced by the interaction of pro-MMP-9 and the PG core protein, or a non-CS glycosaminoglycan part of the PG molecule. The interaction between pro-MMP-9·PG heteromers and gelatin was weaker than the interaction between pro-MMP-9 and gelatin. In contrast, collagen I bound to pro-MMP-9·PG heteromers and pro-MMP-9 with approximately the same affinity. Removal of CS chains from the PG part of the heteromers did not affect the binding to gelatin and collagen. Although the identity of the PG core protein is not known, this does not have any impact on the described biochemical properties of the heteromer or its pro-MMP-9 component. It is also shown that a small fraction of the PG, which is not a part of the pro-MMP-9·PG heteromer, can bind gelatin. As for the pro-MMP-9·PG heteromers, this was independent of the CS chains. The structure that mediates the binding of free PG to gelatin is different from the corresponding structure in the pro-MMP-9·PG heteromer, because they were eluted from gelatin-Sepharose columns under totally different conditions. Although only a small amount of pro-MMP-9·PG heteromer is formed, the heteromer may have fundamental physiological importance, because only catalytic amounts of the enzyme are required to digest physiological targets."

To analyze the role of helix XII more systematically, we employed Cys-scanning mutagenesis of the Escherichia coli xanthine-specific homolog YgfO. Using a functional mutant devoid of Cys residues (C-less), each amino acid residue in sequence 419ILPASIYVLVENPICAGGLTAILLNIILPGGY450 (the putative helix XII is underlined) was replaced individually with Cys. Of the 32 single-Cys mutants, 25 accumulate xanthine to 80–130% of the steady state observed with C-less YgfO, six (P421C, S423C, I424C, Y425C, L427C, G436C) accumulate to low levels (15–40%), and I432C is inactive. Immunoblot analysis shows that P421C and I432C display low expression in the membrane. Extensive mutagenesis reveals that replacement of Ile-432 with equally or more bulky side chains abolishes active transport without affecting expression, whereas replacement with smaller side chains allows activity but impairs affinity for the analogues 1-methyl and 6-thioxanthine. Only three of the single-Cys mutants of helix XII (V426C, N430C, and N443C) are sensitive to inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide. N430C is highly sensitive, with an IC50 of 10 μm, and is completely protected against inactivation in the presence of 2-thioxanthine, a high affinity substrate analogue. Other xanthine analogues are poorly bound by N430C, whereas replacement of Asn-430 with Thr inactivates the permease.

Despite their importance as molecular gateways for the recognition and uptake of several frontline purine-related drugs, NAT/NCS2 members have not been studied systematically at the molecular level, and high resolution structures or mechanistic models are missing. More than 500 sequence entries are known, but few are functionally characterized in detail. The first NAT to be sequenced and best studied eukaryotic member to date is UapA, a high affinity uric acid/xanthine:H+ symporter from the ascomycote Aspergillus nidulans (4Diallinas G.

Recently, we have characterized the first purine-specific members of the NAT/NCS2 family from a Gram-negative bacterium, namely YgfO and YicE of Escherichia coli K-12 (10Karatza P. Frillingos S. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), as high affinity xanthine:H+ symporters that cannot use uric acid, hypoxanthine, uracil, or other nucleobases as a substrate and cannot recognize analogues substituted at positions 7 or 8 of the imidazole ring (10Karatza P.

We have also initiated a systematic series of Cys-scanning and site-directed mutagenesis studies of YgfO to elucidate structure-function relationships in a bacterial NAT (12Karatza P. Panos P.

Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 499-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) NAT-motif determinants consent, implying that few residues conserved within the members of NAT family maybe invariably critical for function. An aromatic residue in the middle of putative helix XII of the fungal UapA (Phe-528) has been suggested to act as a substrate-selectivity filter to select against non-transported purines and define stringency of the purine pathway but without participating in binding per se (9Vlanti A. Amillis S. Koukaki M. Diallinas G. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 808-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Strikingly, sequences of helix XII are poorly conserved in NAT family, but Phe-528 is always conserved in fungal purine-transporting members, and an Ile is conserved at the corresponding position of bacterial purine-transporting NATs (Fig. 1). Thus, the bacterial YgfO, which has a distinct and more robust specificity with respect to position 8 of the imidazole ring (11Goudela S. Karatza P. Koukaki M. Frillingos S. Diallinas G. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), might not need a selectivity filter of the fungal type or use a different amino acid residue(s) as a selectivity filter outside helix XII (9Vlanti A. Amillis S. Koukaki M. Diallinas G. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 808-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To initially address the role of helix XII in YgfO, we have replaced it with the corresponding segment of UapA (Fig. 1) to engineer chimera YgfO(N11)-UapA(C1) and found that the chimeric protein is expressed in the Escherichia coli membrane to decent levels but fails to catalyze active transport. This finding implies that the bacterial helix XII should also contain important determinants.FIGURE 5Expression and xanthine uptake activities of site-directed mutants at position 432.

Sahin-Tóth M. Persson B. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8074-8081Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For ligand competition experiments, uptake of [3H]xanthine (1 μm) was first assayed in the absence or presence of unlabeled analogues (1 mm), as described (12Karatza P. Panos P. Georgopoulou E. Frillingos S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39881-39890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For kinetic analysis, putative inhibitors were used in the concentration range of 0.1 μm to 1 mm, and data were fitted to the appropriate equations using Prism4. IC50 values were determined from full dose-response curves with a minimum of eight points spread over the relevant range. In all cases, the Hill coefficient was close to –1, consistent with presence of one binding site. In addition, we have examined the effect of analogues (1-methyl, 2-thio, and 8-methylxanthine) on Km and Vmax for wild-type and selected mutants and showed that Vmax remains unaltered, consistent with competitive inhibition. This evidence suggests that a simple model of competition with the binding site of the transporter is applicable, satisfying the criteria for use of the Cheng and Prusoff equation Ki = IC50/(1 + (L/Km)), where L is the permeant concentration, and Km is the value obtained for this permeant (11Goudela S. Karatza P. Koukaki M. Frillingos S. Diallinas G. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the Ki value is an affinity constant implying binding to the transporter but does not indicate whether the ligand is being transported across the membrane. Immunoblot Analysis—Membrane fractions of E. coli T184 harboring given plasmids were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE (12%) as described (10Karatza P. Frillingos S. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Proteins were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-PVDF; Pall Corp.). YgfO-BAD was probed with avidin-HRP or with a polyclonal antibody against the C terminus of E. coli LacY (17Carrasco N. Herzlinger D. Mitchell R. DeChiara S. Danho W. Gabriel T.F. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4672-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) followed by protein A-HRP. YgfO-His10 was probed with penta-His antibody-HRP. Signals were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). In Silico Analysis—Comparative sequence analysis of NAT/NCS2 homologs was based on BLAST-p search and ClustalW alignment; the most recent genome annotations were used for retrieving sequence data. Analysis of transmembrane topology was performed using program TMHMM (18Granseth E. Daley D.O. Rapp M. Melen K. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Active Xanthine Transport—Using a functional YgfO devoid of Cys residues (C-less), each amino acid residue in the sequence (Fig. 1) 419ILPASIYVLVENPICAGGLTAILLNIILPGGY450 including putative transmembrane helix XII (underlined) and flanking short segments was replaced individually with Cys. After verification of the sequence, each single-Cys mutant was transformed into E. coli T184 and assayed for its ability to catalyze active xanthine transport. As shown in Fig. 2A, of the 32 single-Cys mutants, 25 transport xanthine at rates that are between 60 and 150% of C-less permease, and 6 (P421C, S423C, I424C, Y425C, L427C, G436C) display low but significant uptake rates (10–25% of C-less). Mutant I432C displays a rate that approximates cells transformed with vector containing no ygfO insert. Steady-state levels of xanthine accumulation also show the same general picture (Fig. 2B); of the 32 single-Cys mutants, 25 accumulate xanthine to 80–130% of the steady state observed with C-less YgfO, 6 (P421C, S423C, I424C, Y425C, L427C, G436C) exhibit low levels (15–40% of C-less), and I432C is inactive. Expression in the Membrane—Immunoblot analysis of BAD-tagged single-Cys permeases shows that low activity of mutant P421C and negligible activity of mutant I432C are associated with low expression in the membrane. All other mutants are expressed to high or moderate levels (Fig. 3). Expression and Transport Analysis of Mutants in Wild-type Background—From the Cys-scanning transport analysis described above, few positions of inactive or low activity mutants were delineated. We analyzed these positions further by (a) transferring single-Cys mutations to the wild-type YgfO background and/or (b) engineering the most conservative site-directed replacement mutant to introduce an amino acid other than Cys. Thus, we constructed and assayed mutants (a) P421C(wt), S423C(wt), I424C(wt), Y425C(wt), L427C(wt), G436C(wt) and (b) P421G(wt) and I432L(wt) (Fig. 4). We found that S423C(wt), I424C(wt), G436C(wt), and P421G(wt) were highly active, L427C(wt) accumulated to 50% of wild type, and P421C(wt) and Y425C(wt) accumulated to low levels (15–30% of wild type), whereas I432L(wt) was inactive (Fig. 4B). All mutants of this set, including I432L(wt), are expressed in the membrane to high leve"

Water occupancy was assessed by using time-resolved spectroscopy to detect the perturbation of the heme visible band absorption spectrum caused by water entry after CO photodissociation ( Goldbeck, R. A., Bhaskaran, S., Ortega, C., Mendoza, J. L., Olson, J. S., Soman, J., Kliger, D. S., and Esquerra, R. M. (2006) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 103, 1254-1259 ). We found that the water occupancy observed during the time interval between ligand photolysis and diffusive recombination decreased by nearly 20% as the pH was lowered below 6. This decrease accounted for most of the concomitant increase in the observed CO bimolecular recombination rate constant, as the lower water occupancy presented a smaller kinetic barrier to CO entry into the pocket at lower pH. These results were consistent with a model in which the distal histidine, which stabilizes the water molecule within the distal pocket by accepting a hydrogen bond, tends to swing out of the pocket upon protonation and destabilize the water occupancy at low pH. Extrapolation of this model to lower pH suggests that the additional increase in ligand association rate constant observed previously in stopped-flow studies at pH 3 may also be due in part to reduced distal water occupancy concomitant with further His64 protonation and coupled protein conformational change."
https://openalex.org/W2040876899,"Chromatin structure and gene transcription regulation are intimately linked, and mosaic expression of randomly integrated transgenes into the genome is frequently observed. This variegation of transgene expression is likely due to the genomic integration site, which can affect the behavior of the integrated DNA sequence in a positive or a negative way. Insulators are a class of DNA elements that can protect genes from inappropriate signals emanating from their environment by acting as boundaries that prevent the spreading of nearby condensed chromatin that may otherwise silence expression. Here we show that transgenes escape this silencing in Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis embryos and that a stable, uniform, and heritable expression pattern is obtained when transgenes are flanked with tandem copies of the chicken beta-globin 5'HS4 insulator. Our data also indicate that the insulator confers copy-number-dependent transgene expression and can increase transgene expression from weak regulatory elements. Hence, it will be an invaluable tool for generating stable lines expressing different levels of a particular coding sequence."

https://openalex.org/W2049535779,"Atherosclerosis characterized by sustained inflammation and aberrant extracellular matrix alterations. Our previous investigation has defined major histocompatibility class II transactivator (CIITA) as a key factor in mediating these two processes in smooth muscle cells. Here, we demonstrate that CIITA and major histocompatibility class II expression are elevated in interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-treated smooth muscle cells from A2b adenosine receptor (A2bAR(-/-)) knock-out mice, as compared with wild type cells. An A2-type adenosine receptor agonist suppresses these effects of IFN-gamma in wild type cells, which can be blocked by an A2bAR-specific antagonist. We further identify that increased cellular cAMP levels are responsible for the down-regulation of CIITA expression and, hence, reduced IFN-gamma response as evidenced by the following data: 1) direct activation of adenylyl cyclase activity is both necessary and sufficient to suppress the IFN-gamma response; 2) inhibition of phosphodiesterase activity attenuates IFN-gamma induced transcription events; and 3) direct treatment with cAMP analog abrogates CIITA activation and IFN-gamma response. Therefore, our data establish possible cross-talk between the adenosine signaling through cAMP and IFN-gamma during regulation of CIITA expression."

https://openalex.org/W1986850562,"Amid growing recognition that a successful scientific career requires skills beyond scientific acumen, institutions are racing to provide management training for newly minted principal investigators. Amid growing recognition that a successful scientific career requires skills beyond scientific acumen, institutions are racing to provide management training for newly minted principal investigators. Young scientists spend years conducting complicated experiments and crunching data, but when they are finally given the keys to their own lab, they suddenly face tasks they were never trained for in graduate school. “Assistant professors are hired based on their scientific research accomplishments, but their success as faculty members is very much related to their ability to manage a small business,” says Tom Cech, President of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Most newly minted principal investigators have minimal training in business skills, yet their survival requires management abilities such as making hiring decisions, mentoring, providing performance evaluations, giving lab members appropriate feedback, budgeting, obtaining research funds, grant writing, and time management, Cech says. “A little bit of training can help people avoid the pitfalls.” HHMI was among the first to recognize the need for management training for young scientists. In 2002, HHMI joined with the Burroughs Wellcome Fund (BWF) to provide a laboratory leadership and management course at HHMI's headquarters in Chevy Chase, Maryland. The course, specifically designed for senior postdocs and new faculty members, covered everything from negotiating your first position to navigating tenure, hiring and managing lab members, teaching and mentoring, project management, and collaborations. The course was so successful—with more than 250 applicants for 100 slots in the first year—that demand threatened to outstrip the capacity to provide it. “We decided that this is not really something that [we] should take on,” says Maryrose Franko, senior program officer for graduate science education at HHMI. “If we became known for this then people would expect us to keep doing this for everybody forever and we don't think it's our responsibility,” she says. “We wanted to use our bully pulpit to encourage other institutions to do this for their own scientists,” says Franko. “Our message is—you need to be doing this but we're here to help you.” So when the course was held again in 2005, HHMI/BWF invited people from more than a dozen organizations and institutions to attend not only the course but also an additional “train the trainers” program. “Those who participated had to commit to putting on a program at their own institution and to go back and take notes on their development process,” says Franko. “We asked them, at your institution—on a shoestring budget—how would you do this? That's how the trainers course came about,” she says. Those in the “train the trainers” program participated in the lab management course just like other attendees, but their work continued into the evening. “After each day, we had a debriefing program,” says Franko. “We asked them, what worked? What didn't? What would you do differently? How would you spin this differently at your institution?” One attendee, Joan Lakoski, Assistant Vice Chancellor in the Office of Academic Career Development at the University of Pittsburgh, used her experience from the program to organize a course on scientific management and leadership at the University of Pittsburgh's Schools of the Health Sciences (Table 1). The two-day course, now in its third year, focuses on team building, ways to develop and manage a scientific research program, and tools for productivity. Since its inception, the course has increased its emphasis on interpersonal skills. “Over and over, we've had requests to increase discussion on conflict management,” says Lakoski, “so we've increased the amount of time devoted to skills related to managing interpersonal conflicts and negotiation.”Table 1Organizations Hosting Laboratory Management CoursesAmerican Society of Human Geneticshttp://www.ashg.org/meetings (held in conjunction with the annual meeting)American Physiological Societyhttp://www.the-aps.org/education/profSkills2007/index.htmAmerican Society of Plant Biologistshttp://www.aspb.org/meetings/pb-2007/labmanagement.cfmAssociation for Academic Surgeryhttp://www.aasurg.org/documents/WACSFINAL.pdfChildren's Hospital, Bostonhttp://www.childrenshospital.org/cfapps/research/data_admin/Site1002/mainpageS1002P28.htmlEMBOhttp://www.embo.org/yip/lab_mgm.htmlFASEBhttp://www.faseb.org/careers/eb2008/pages/page2a.htm (held in conjunction with FASEB meetings)Harvard Medical Schoolhttp://www.hms.harvard.edu/fa/leadership/index.htmMedical College of Wisconsinhttp://www.mcw.edu/phdsymposiumNational Postdoctoral Associationhttp://www.nationalpostdoc.orgNorthwestern Universityhttp://www.research.northwestern.edu/ord/events/NavigatingtheProfessoriate.htmStanford Universityhttp://postdocs.stanford.edu/education/Scientific_Management_2008.htmlTRAYSS PRIMEhttp://www.scanbalt.org/sw11850.aspUK GRADhttp://www.grad.ac.uk/cms/ShowPage/Home_page/p!eecddLUniversity of Arizona College of Medicinehttp://www.medicalresearch.arizona.edu/niworkshop.cfmUniversity of California-Davishttp://www.innovationaccess.ucdavis.edu/home.cfm?id=OVC,14University of California-San Franciscohttp://www.ucsf.edu/career/University of Cincinnati and Cincinnati Children's Research Foundationhttp://www.uc.edu/ucResearch/Research_Orientation.htmlUniversity of Pittsburgh School of Medicinehttp://www.oacd.health.pitt.edu/leadershipcourse/index.html Open table in a new tab The program also walks participants through strategies for navigating the university system and tenure. “Originally we had included a session on project management, but we had trouble finding someone who could address project planning in a way that clicked with scientists, so last year we substituted a session on how to talk to your department chair,” says Lakoski. “We're constantly tweaking the material. This year we're doing a session on how to identify resources beyond the NIH for research funding.” Nuria Pastor-Soler, an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, says the course helped her to identify good and bad traits in her leadership style and to better work with those whose personality types differ from her own. “The concept of fast-processing and slow-processing temperaments was very interesting to me,” she says. “I used to get very impatient when some of my colleagues would take one week to reply to what I considered a simple request for advice. I am now much more understanding of the fact that some of my colleagues may need much more time (on their own) to reflect upon all the information before giving me their opinion.” Her colleague assistant professor William Lariviere says he constantly relies on the time management skills he learned in the workshop. “There are only so many hours in the day. The course carefully outlined how one can deal with the constant barrage of information and demands that we endure daily, keeping the overall goals in sight.” Attendees like Pastor-Soler and Lariviere have responded so positively that many University of Pittsburgh senior faculty have expressed interest in a course for established principal investigators, says Lakoski. As a result, organizers are now thinking about offering a slightly different course for more senior scientists. Lakoski and others who attended the HHMI/BWF “train the trainers” program provide a valuable resource for others who are looking for ways to make this happen at their own universities. “I've had a few phone calls from other institutions,” says Lakoski. “I'm happy to serve as a resource. Anyone who wants to can come to Pittsburgh to observe our course,” she says. “We have a network of people here to help,” says HHMI's Franko. “We give out names of the partners, and people can use their modules and share strategies—things like, how are you getting your money? How are you measuring success?” Currently, HHMI is compiling a database of organizations that are using their resources and “this will provide a community where everybody can share and see who's doing what,” says Franko. The database should be completed in the next few months. Although there are no plans for another HHMI/BWF lab management course, information from the two courses and the “train the trainers” program is now available as a book, Making the Right Moves: A Practical Guide to Scientific Management for Postdocs and New Faculty (freely available at http://www.hhmi.org/resources/labmanagement). The book's 13 chapters cover negotiating a faculty position, tenure, staffing, mentoring, time management, project management, data management, funding, publishing, technology transfer, collaborations, and teaching. This book is not intended as a substitute for an actual lab management course but rather serves as a guide for postdocs and new principal investigators, and also for administrators who want to put on a course at their own institutions. Across the Atlantic, the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) has developed its own lab management program. Gerlind Wallon, who manages the EMBO Young Investigator Programme, consulted with HHMI's Franko but soon realized that the EMBO version of the course would need to be tweaked to meet the needs of European scientists. “The HHMI course covered many other things, like how to write NSF/NIH grants, that you cannot transfer to Europe,” says Wallon. The EMBO course began as a classroom-style experience, but “it didn't accomplish much more than reading a book so we've completely changed it,” she says. “We had a big discussion and debate at the beginning,” notes Wallon. “I thought it would be crucial to have instructors who had a scientific background, but I have to say that now I don't think it's crucial. Yes, it's important that trainers have a feeling for the people they're working with and one of our trainers does have a PhD in math,” she says. “But it's not necessary for them to be scientists. They need to be familiar with that environment, but they don't have to come from it.” The EMBO course now features a format that emphasizes practical learning, with break-out groups that try out key concepts using real-life scenarios and role playing. “These courses are very hands on. You're in a small group so you can't hide and you are actually testing these things out on each other—it's very focused on people management,” says Wallon. “You come out of it having tried out these things. You get hands on experience using this with your peers,” she says. Han Kiat Ho, a senior research fellow at the Institute of Medical Biology in Singapore, attended an EMBO lab management course on the advice of his advisor, EMBO member Axel Ullrich. Ho says he left with a better understanding of how to manage and mentor his lab members. Although it seemed tedious at first to coach lab members to solve their problems themselves instead of merely giving them the solutions, Ho emphasizes that “lab members will learn to solve problems independently and effectively, and interaction time with them will become productive.” Ho says that in his native Singapore, there is a growing awareness of the need for effective lab management, and some local and regional consulting companies are beginning to conduct management courses for biomedical research institutes. But for now, he says, “the EMBO lab management course remains unparalleled.” Closer to home, Eduardo Moreno, a new group leader at the Spanish National Cancer Center (CNIO) in Madrid, attended the EMBO course last January. He says the program opened his eyes to how cultural factors could influence people's work habits in the lab. “We learned that different cultures use their time differently—some cultures are sequential and others more synchronic,” he says. “In some cultures the time is more flexible and you can do several things at the same time. Other cultures like to do one thing at a time,” says Moreno. “You have to accept that different people in your lab may require different types of attention and you need to treat them individually,” he says. The EMBO course also includes a personality analysis. Participants were put into teams of two, told one another's personality type, and then forced to work together. “I tend to focus on solutions, so the more solutions I find the more confident I am that we are doing well,” says Moreno. His partner, however, was “more of a perfectionist, and when there was one solution there she was happy, but when we had two, she started to feel stressed,” he says. That experience helped Moreno understand the need to personalize approaches to management and mentoring. “What works for one person may be a stress to another,” he says. Moreno had to travel to Germany to attend his EMBO course, but this month, the EMBO course is coming to Spain. Like the HHMI/BWF program, EMBO is keen to share its know-how with others. “We have had requests from different institutes throughout Europe,” says Wallon. EMBO relies on freelance contractors to teach their lab management course, and they happily share these trainers with other institutions who request them. This month, the Institut d'Estudis Catalans (IEC), located in the heart of downtown Barcelona, will host a workshop entitled “The Art of Leadership: Fewer Conflicts, More Results–A Laboratory Management Workshop for Established and Prospective Group Leaders.” The course is open to scientists from a variety of institutes. “EMBO and the course organizers have advised us that a mix of internal and external participants creates an atmosphere more conducive to open communication,” says Sarah Sherwood of the office of Communications and External Relations at Barcelona's Institute for Research in Biomedicine. “We've fully booked the course and have people on the waiting list,” she says. The workshop was organized in collaboration with the Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria Foundation, which helped with funding, Sherwood says. The workshop will use instructors from the EMBO course and will follow their model. Likewise, Cancer Research UK (CRUK) has also turned to the EMBO model for providing management training to its scientists. “Cancer Research UK has been working in collaboration with EMBO, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, the Sanger Institute, UK Medical Research Council and the Institute of Cancer Research to explore opportunities for leadership and management skill development within our scientific community,” says Sarah Burns, CRUK's learning and development manager. “As part of this collaboration we are looking at bringing the EMBO Laboratory Management Course to the UK. This course has received excellent feedback from the Cancer Research UK scientists who have attended it in Heidelberg and by bringing it to the UK we hope to make it even more accessible to our scientists,” says Burns. CRUK plans to run a workshop called “Leadership in Science” at the next National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) conference in Birmingham this October. “The workshop will aim to explore what are the main challenges leading scientific research in the 21st century, how a balance can be struck between leading science and people and how we can prepare the leaders of the future to face these challenges.” Meanwhile, in Europe's Baltic Sea region, the not-for-profit organization ScanBalt, a meta-network of biotech companies, has teamed up with two private German consulting firms, Steinbeis Team Nordost and Prosciencia GmbH, to provide a series of management workshops, dubbed TRAYSS PRIME, for graduate students, postdocs, and junior group leaders in both industry and academia. The series of eight seminars are taking place in Hamburg, Berlin, Copenhagen, Gdansk, Krakow, and Turku through June 2008. The workshops focus on three topics—research project management, the EU research framework program application process, and commercialization and intellectual property (IP) management in biotechnology. The program aims to fill gaps in traditional scientific training, says Henner Willnow of Steinbeis Team Nordost. “The need for management of labs and work groups is fast growing,” he says. Unlike the stand-alone workshops held by HHMI and EMBO, the TRAYSS PRIME seminars are conducted at international conferences. This strategy allows for synergy among the host organizations, the conference organizers, and the TRAYSS PRIME team, says Willnow. By the end of this year, the TRAYSS PRIME program will have trained some 150 young researchers. But TRAYSS PRIME is not the only group offering management training at conferences; professional societies, such as FASEB, also offer management skills workshops at their meetings. Still, as welcome as such programs might be, the University of Pittsburgh's Lakoski argues that ultimately the task of providing management training should rest with a scientist's home institution. “The real issue is, who accepts responsibility for the success of postdocs and faculty at an institution?” says Lakoski. “I think that is an institutional responsibility.” Although she encourages young scientists to participate in workshops held at FASEB and other conferences, Lakoski says that these should supplement programs at a scientist's home institute. HHMI's Franko agrees. “I think the majority of training should come from universities—they should provide this for their postdocs and junior faculty,” she says. “It's a statement on how you treat your people, if you treat them well in the beginning, it's a good investment.” HHMI President Tom Cech points out that it is also to an institution's advantage to ensure that new hires get the help and guidance they need to successfully manage a lab. “Institutions invest so much, they may have several hundred applications for a job, and they pick the top person,” says Cech. “A department has a lot riding on the success of the new faculty member, and that person's success or failure will depend to some extent on how well they can manage their lab,” he says."
