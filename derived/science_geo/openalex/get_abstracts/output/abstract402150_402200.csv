https://openalex.org/W2073377349,Transcription activator–like effector nucleases (TALENs) are a new technology for modifying the genome at specific loci of interest. Hockemeyer et al. now demonstrate the utility of TALENs for gene targeting in human pluripotent stem cells. Targeted genetic engineering of human pluripotent cells is a prerequisite for exploiting their full potential. Such genetic manipulations can be achieved using site-specific nucleases. Here we engineered transcription activator–like effector nucleases (TALENs) for five distinct genomic loci. At all loci tested we obtained human embryonic stem cell (ESC) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) clones carrying transgenic cassettes solely at the TALEN-specified location. Our data suggest that TALENs employing the specific architectures described here mediate site-specific genome modification in human pluripotent cells with similar efficiency and precision as do zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs).

https://openalex.org/W2156757115,"There is limited regeneration of lost tissue after central nervous system injury, and the lesion is sealed with a scar. The role of the scar, which often is referred to as the glial scar because of its abundance of astrocytes, is complex and has been discussed for more than a century. Here we show that a specific pericyte subtype gives rise to scar-forming stromal cells, which outnumber astrocytes, in the injured spinal cord. Blocking the generation of progeny by this pericyte subtype results in failure to seal the injured tissue. The formation of connective tissue is common to many injuries and pathologies, and here we demonstrate a cellular origin of fibrosis."

https://openalex.org/W2022111659,"Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes allows for in-depth characterization of complex microbial communities. Although it is known that primer selection can influence the profile of a community generated by sequencing, the extent and severity of this bias on deep-sequencing methodologies is not well elucidated. We tested the hypothesis that the hypervariable region targeted for sequencing and primer degeneracy play important roles in influencing the composition of 16S pyrotag communities. Subgingival plaque from deep sites of current smokers with chronic periodontitis was analyzed using Sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing using 4 primer pairs. Greater numbers of species were detected by pyrosequencing than by Sanger sequencing. Rare taxa constituted nearly 6% of each pyrotag community and less than 1% of the Sanger sequencing community. However, the different target regions selected for pyrosequencing did not demonstrate a significant difference in the number of rare and abundant taxa detected. The genera Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Streptococcus, Granulicatella, Bacteroides, Porphyromonas and Treponema were abundant when the V1–V3 region was targeted, while Streptococcus, Treponema, Prevotella, Eubacterium, Porphyromonas, Campylobacer and Enterococcus predominated in the community generated by V4–V6 primers, and the most numerous genera in the V7–V9 community were Veillonella, Streptococcus, Eubacterium, Enterococcus, Treponema, Catonella and Selenomonas. Targeting the V4–V6 region failed to detect the genus Fusobacterium, while the taxa Selenomonas, TM7 and Mycoplasma were not detected by the V7–V9 primer pairs. The communities generated by degenerate and non-degenerate primers did not demonstrate significant differences. Averaging the community fingerprints generated by V1–V3 and V7–V9 primers providesd results similar to Sanger sequencing, while allowing a significantly greater depth of coverage than is possible with Sanger sequencing. It is therefore important to use primers targeted to these two regions of the 16S rRNA gene in all deep-sequencing efforts to obtain representational characterization of complex microbial communities."

In this study, we investigated miRNA profiling as a complementary tool to improve our understanding of breast cancer (BC) biology and to assess whether miRNA expression could predict clinical outcome of BC patients.Global miRNA expression profiling using microarray technology was conducted in 56 systemically untreated BC patients who had corresponding mRNA expression profiles available. Results were further confirmed using qRT-PCR in an independent dataset of 89 ER-positive BC patients homogeneously treated with tamoxifen only. MiR-210 functional analyses were performed in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 BC cell lines using lentiviral transduction.Estrogen receptor (ER) status, tumor grade and our previously developed gene expression grade index (GGI) were associated with distinct miRNA profiles. Several miRNAs were found to be clinically relevant, including miR-210, its expression being associated with tumor proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, miR-210 was associated with poor clinical outcome in ER-positive, tamoxifen-treated BC patients. Interestingly, the prognostic performance of miR-210 was similar to several reported multi-gene signatures, highlighting its important role in BC differentiation and tumor progression. Functional analyses in BC cell lines revealed that miR-210 is involved in cell proliferation, migration and invasion.This integrated analysis combining miRNA and mRNA expression demonstrates that miRNA expression provides additional biological information beyond mRNA expression. Expression of miR-210 is linked to tumor proliferation and appears to be a strong potential biomarker of clinical outcome in BC."
https://openalex.org/W1984209164,"Both engineering and evolution are constrained by trade-offs between efficiency and robustness, but theory that formalizes this fact is limited. For a simple two-state model of glycolysis, we explicitly derive analytic equations for hard trade-offs between robustness and efficiency with oscillations as an inevitable side effect. The model describes how the trade-offs arise from individual parameters, including the interplay of feedback control with autocatalysis of network products necessary to power and catalyze intermediate reactions. We then use control theory to prove that the essential features of these hard trade-off ""laws"" are universal and fundamental, in that they depend minimally on the details of this system and generalize to the robust efficiency of any autocatalytic network. The theory also suggests worst-case conditions that are consistent with initial experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2083757415,"Annexin A2 (AnxA2), a Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding protein, is known to associate with the plasma membrane and the endosomal system. Within the plasma membrane, AnxA2 associates in a Ca2+dependent manner with cholesterol-rich lipid raft microdomains. Here, we show that the association of AnxA2 with the lipid rafts is influenced not only by intracellular levels of Ca2+ but also by N-terminal phosphorylation at tyrosine 23. Binding of AnxA2 to the lipid rafts is followed by the transport along the endocytic pathway to be associated with the intralumenal vesicles of the multivesicular endosomes. AnxA2-containing multivesicular endosomes fuse directly with the plasma membrane resulting in the release of the intralumenal vesicles into the extracellular environment, which facilitates the exogenous transfer of AnxA2 from one cell to another. Treatment with Ca2+ ionophore triggers the association of AnxA2 with the specialized microdomains in the exosomal membrane that possess raft-like characteristics. Phosphorylation at Tyr-23 is also important for the localization of AnxA2 to the exosomal membranes. These results suggest that AnxA2 is trafficked from the plasma membrane rafts and is selectively incorporated into the lumenal membranes of the endosomes to escape the endosomal degradation pathway.

Creutz C.E. Moss S.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane-associated AnxA2 is implicated in several membrane-related events including fibrinolysis, exocytosis and endocytosis, cell-cell adhesion, and membrane-cytoskeletal interactions (2Rescher U. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2631-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). AnxA2 is a soluble protein predominantly distributed in the cytosol of the cells at resting Ca2+ levels and translocated to cellular membranes under elevated concentrations of intracellular Ca2+(3Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). In vitro studies using artificial membranes have shown that AnxA2 preferentially binds to the acidic phospholipids, which are enriched in the cytoplasmic leaflet of cellular membranes (4Lambert O. Cavusoglu N. Gallay J. Vincent M. Rigaud J.L. Henry J.P. Ayala-Sanmartin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10872-10882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). annexin A2 multivesicular endosome GFP-tagged to the C terminus of wild-type AnxA2 GFP-tagged to AnxA2Y23 phosphorylation mutants Triton-soluble fraction Triton-insoluble fraction monosialotetrahexosylganglioside NeuAcα 2,3Galβ1,4Glc-ceramide or N-acetylneuraminylgalactosylceramide cholera toxin subunit B N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-phosphatidylethanolamine detergent-resistant membranes transferrin receptor Manders's overlap coefficient methyl-β-cyclodextrin. The mechanism of cell surface translocation of AnxA2 may occur via a non-classical secretory pathway as AnxA2 lacks a signal sequence that could direct it across the classical endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi secretory pathway (5Danielsen E.M. van Deurs B. Hansen G.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14670-14676Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). One of the central questions in understanding the Ca2+-dependent plasma membrane dynamics of AnxA2 is how the protein is recruited from the intracytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane to the extracytoplasmic leaflet to be localized to the cell surface. Membrane association of AnxA2 is largely attributed to the hypervariable N-terminal domain that precedes the conserved Ca2+ binding core domain (6Ayala-Sanmartin J. Zibouche M. Illien F. Vincent M. Gallay J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 472-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Previous reports suggest that AnxA2 preferentially binds to cholesterol and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-rich domains of the membrane called lipid rafts (7Rescher U. Ruhe D. Ludwig C. Zobiack N. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3473-3480Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Although AnxA2 influences the raft dynamics and promotes the formation of lipid microdomains, the mechanisms that influence the raft association and the subsequent functions of lipid raft-associated AnxA2 are not well understood. Lipid rafts are implicated in diverse cellular processes including cell adhesion, membrane trafficking, and signal transduction events (8Helms J.B. Zurzolo C. Traffic. 2004; 5: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The highly fluid raft microdomains serve as platforms for the segregation and sorting of proteins to different cellular compartments (9Nelson W.J. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 282-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 10Füllekrug J. Simons K. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1014: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The most intriguing observation, however, is the involvement of lipid rafts in sorting of lipid and proteins in the endocytic and secretory pathways (11Gagescu R. Demaurex N. Parton R.G. Hunziker W. Huber L.A. Gruenberg J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2775-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Lipid raft endocytosis is characterized as a general mechanism for pathogen entry (12Pelkmans L. Kartenbeck J. Helenius A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar), recycling of extracellular ligands (13Benlimame N. Le P.U. Nabi I.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1773-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and cell surface trafficking of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (14Nichols B.J. Kenworthy A.K. Polishchuk R.S. Lodge R. Roberts T.H. Hirschberg K. Phair R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that lipid raft-associated proteins are trafficked through the endocytic pathway as a result of invagination of the plasma membrane rafts into the endocytic vesicles (15Sharma P. Sabharanjak S. Mayor S. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 13: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Proteins that are targeted to the endosomal pathway after internalization from the plasma membrane are progressively shuttled first to the early endosomes and later incorporated into the multivesicular endosomes (MVEs) or endosome carrier vesicles to be destined to the late endosomal pathway (16Hurley J.H. Emr S.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2006; 35: 277-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). MVEs are critical intermediates of the endocytic pathway that are formed when the limiting membrane of the early endosomes invaginates into its lumen (17Wollert T. Hurley J.H. Nature. 2010; 464: 864-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). MVEs contain secreted intralumenal components called exosomes with protein and lipid composition identical to the endosomes reflecting their endosomal origin (18Théry C. Zitvogel L. Amigorena S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 569-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3772) Google Scholar). Exosomes not only possess proteins that are necessary for their biogenesis and maintenance but also contain several plasma membrane and cytosolic proteins (19Stoorvogel W. Kleijmeer M.J. Geuze H.J. Raposo G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Exosomes are also identified to possess distinct membrane domains enriched in cholesterol and GM1 gangliosides and similar in composition to the plasma membrane rafts (20Wubbolts R. Leckie R.S. Veenhuizen P.T. Schwarzmann G. Möbius W. Hoernschemeyer J. Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Stoorvogel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10963-10972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 21de Gassart A. Geminard C. Fevrier B. Raposo G. Vidal M. Blood. 2003; 102: 4336-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The presence of raft-like domains in the exosomes suggests that exosomes participate in the sorting of raft-associated proteins. Raft-like domains are found to be present not only in the MVE intralumenal vesicles but also in the late endosomes, and they are thought to originate by the endocytosis of the plasma membrane rafts occurring via clathrin-dependent (22Abrami L. Liu S. Cosson P. Leppla S.H. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and -independent pathways (15Sharma P. Sabharanjak S. Mayor S. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 13: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the present study we questioned whether AnxA2 is trafficked from the plasma membrane lipid rafts to the intralumenal vesicles of the MVEs to be later released into the extracellular space upon fusion of the MVEs with the plasma membrane. We first sought to determine the molecular mechanisms by which AnxA2 is initially recruited to the plasma membrane lipid rafts. Upon elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ levels, AnxA2 is sorted from the plasma membrane rafts first to the exosomal membranes. Within the exosomal membrane, AnxA2 is localized to distinct regions that possess raft-like characteristics, and exosomes are also identified to serve as potential intercellular carriers of AnxA2. The data presented here provide novel insights into the membrane dynamics of AnxA2. We suggest the importance of Tyr-23 phosphorylation in the Ca2+-dependent recruitment of AnxA2 to the plasma membrane rafts. Localization of AnxA2 in the lipid rafts targets AnxA2 into the intralumenal vesicles of the MVE and its further assortment into the raft-like regions of the exosomal membrane. Upon fusion of the MVEs with the plasma membrane, the MVE intralumenal vesicles, called exosomes, are secreted into the extracellular space, and the released AnxA2 rebinds to the surface of the target cell in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-AnxA2 (BD Biosciences), mouse monoclonal anti-Na+,K+-ATPase (a6-FC) (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa), rabbit polyclonal anti-PGK (25Mayran N.

Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG were from Promega. Reagents were purchased from the following sources: Ca2+ ionophore A23187, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Sigma), filipin (Sigma), Alexa-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B (CTXB) (Invitrogen), sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce), avidin-conjugated Sepharose (Sigma), Fluo-3 AM (Invitrogen), phosphatidyl(N-sulforhodamine B sulfonyl)ethanolamine (N-Rh-PE) (Avanti Polar Lipids), brefeldin A (Sigma), Triton X-100 (Sigma), CHAPS (Sigma), BODIPY-Laccer (Avanti Polar lipids), Alexa594-conjugated transferrin (Molecular Probes). NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and MDA-MB231 cells were cultured at 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose and low glucose medium respectively (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 5% penicillin-streptomycin. A polyclonal population of LNCaP-C1 cells stably expressing GFP was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% penicillin-streptomycin. For ionophore treatment, subconfluent cultures were treated with 5 μm Ca2+ ionophore A23187 for the indicated periods of time. For transfections, cells were cultured in 100-mm dishes to 70% confluence. 20 μg of DNA was incubated with 30 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and was later added to 15 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 6 h and returned to normal growth medium. For the construction of a plasmid expressing full-length AnxA2, the cDNA of AnxA2 was cloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector. The N-terminal phosphomimetic and non-phosphomimetic mutants at Tyr-23 were generated by using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). In this report, the plasmids are referred to as AnxA2WT-GFP, AnxA2Y23E-GFP, and AnxA2Y23F-GFP. For immunocytochemistry, cells expressing AnxA2Y23E-GFP and AnxA2Y23F-GFP were treated with 5 μm Ca2+ ionophore A23187. The cells were later subjected to monosialoganglioside GM1 labeling with 8 μg/ml Alexa 555-conjugated cholera toxin B subunit. The cells were washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and subjected to immunocytochemistry. The coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Prolong Gold mounting media (Invitrogen). Confocal images were obtained using Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope equipped with a 63× Plan-Apochromat objective and HeNe1, HeNe2, and argon lasers. The weighted colocalization coefficients were calculated using the Zeiss LSM enhanced colocalization software (Zeiss), which is a measure of the sum of the number of co-localizing pixels relative to the sum of the total number of pixel intensities after background correction. Confluent cultures were washed with 0.5 mm EDTA and PBS buffer (Versene, Invitrogen) for 20 min at 37 °C, and the supernatant was designated EDTA eluate. Cell surface proteins were subjected to biotinylation with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS biotin (Pierce) and recovered with avidin-conjugated Sepharose (Sigma) as previously described with slight modifications (63Rubin D. Ismail-Beigi F. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C377-C383Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, chilled on ice for 5 min to block endocytosis, and biotinylated with 1 mg of EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were later washed twice with ice-cold PBS and subsequently incubated on ice with 50 mm glycine, PBS for 15 min to quench the biotinylation reaction. Subsequently, cells were lysed in TNE buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) containing 1% Triton X-100 plus protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Promega). The post-nuclear supernatants were incubated in 60 μl of NeutrAvidin beads (Pierce). After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, the supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed twice with each buffer A (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40), boiled in sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE Western immunoblot analysis. Alternatively, the post-nuclear supernatants were recovered and subjected to Triton X-100 extraction of the detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) as described below. Fetal bovine serum contains endogenous exosomes; to eliminate exosomes from FBS, the culture medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, and 5% penicillin-streptomycin) was centrifuged overnight at 120,000 × g. Exosomes were isolated from the culture medium by serial centrifugation as previously published (64Savina A. Furlán M. Vidal M. Colombo M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20083-20090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The culture medium was subjected to serial centrifugations at 800 × g for 10 min to remove the cells and at 12,000 × g for 30 min to remove the cell debris. The exosomes were pelleted from the supernatant by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 h, washed, resuspended, and repelleted in PBS using a SW28 rotor (Beckman). Separation of the membrane into Triton-soluble and -insoluble components was performed as published (35Zhuang L. Lin J. Lu M.L. Solomon K.R. Freeman M.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2227-2231PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in buffer A (25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5). The lysate was treated with an equal volume of the buffer A mixed with 2% Triton X-100, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 2 mm PMSF and incubated on ice for 30 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected and referred to as the Triton-soluble (TS) fraction. The insoluble pellets were resuspended with buffer B (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm Na3VO4, 60 mm β-octylglucoside, and 1 mm PMSF) for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and referred to as the Triton-insoluble (TI) fraction. Lipid raft fractions were isolated according to the previously published protocols with a few modifications (32Brown, D. A. (2002) Curr. Protoc. Immunol., Chapter 11, Unit 11.10.Google Scholar). Briefly cells were grown to near confluence, transfected, and treated in four 100-mm dishes. The cells were lysed in 500 mm Na2CO3, pH 11, with a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and the lysate was homogenized with 20 strokes in a prechilled Dounce homogenizer followed by homogenization with a Polytron homogenizer 3 times for 10 s with intervals of 10–15 s followed by sonication 3 times for 20 s with an interval of 60 s. Two ml of the homogenized sample was mixed with 2 ml of 90% sucrose in MBS (25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.0). A discontinuous sucrose gradient was generated by overlaying with 4 ml of 35% sucrose in 1× MBS and 250 mm Na2CO3 followed by overlaying with 4 ml of 5% sucrose in 1× MBS and 250 mm Na2CO3. The gradient was centrifuged at 40,000 × g in a SW40Ti rotor (Beckman). Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of the tube, and the fractions were subjected to trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation followed by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting. Exosomes collected by serial centrifugation were subjected to further purification as described previously (20Wubbolts R. Leckie R.S. Veenhuizen P.T. Schwarzmann G. Möbius W. Hoernschemeyer J. Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Stoorvogel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10963-10972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). The exosomal pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of 2.6 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, a linear sucrose gradient of (2.0–0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) was layered on the top of the exosome suspension in a SW41 tube for 16 h at 270,000 × g (Beckman), and the pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting. Lipid rafts were isolated from the exosomes as described (21de Gassart A. Geminard C. Fevrier B. Raposo G. Vidal M. Blood. 2003; 102: 4336-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated vesicles (2 mg) from the culture medium were suspended in 1.5 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.2/150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) in combination with 1% Triton X-100 or 1% CHAPS with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The suspension was mixed in 1.5 ml of 95% sucrose, overlaid with 3 ml of 35% sucrose and 3 ml of 5% sucrose, and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C. 1-ml fractions from the top were collected and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. MVEs were labeled with N-Rh-PE as described previously (30Savina A. Vidal M. Colombo M.I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2505-2515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly the ethanolic solution of the fluorescent lipid (<1% v/v) was injected by a Hamilton syringe into the medium, and after vigorous vortexing the cells were incubated in the medium for 60 min at 4 °C. The cells were later washed with PBS to remove any unbound lipids and loaded with 15 μm Fluo-3 AM (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C. After subjecting the cells to ionophore treatment, cells were washed with PBS and immediately mounted on glass coverslips and visualized under the Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope using a 40× objective. Exosomes were freshly harvested from the culture medium of MDA-MB231 cells, suspended in 1× PBS, and quantified for protein concentration by a BCA assay (Pierce). LNCaP-C1 cells were cultured on coverslips and incubated with 30 μg of exosomes collected from MDA-MB231 cells for 12 h at 37 °C. The cells were fixed and stained with anti-AnxA2 antibody (1:1000). LNCaP-C1 cells were incubated in 0.5 mm EDTA for 1 h to chelate off MDA-MB231-derived cell surface AnxA2. Quantification of secreted exosomes was performed by measuring the activity of acetylcholine esterase as previously described (27Merendino A.M. Bucchieri F. Campanella C. Marcianò V. Ribbene A. David S. Zummo G. Burgio G. Corona D.F. Conway de Macario E. Macario A.J. Cappello F. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e9247Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of the pelted exosomes was suspended in 100 μl of PBS, 37.5 μl of this PBS-diluted fraction was incubated in the presence of 1.25 mm acetylthiocholine and 0.1 mm 5′m5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and the reaction mixture was brought to a final volume of 300 μl in a 96-well plate. The incubation was carried out at 37 °C, and the change in absorbance at 412 nm was monitored every 5 min. The data presented represent the enzymatic activity 20 min after incubation. Enriched exosomal fractions were fixed for 10 min at room temperature in 2% formaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, and either adsorbed onto freshly ionized Formvar/carbon-coated grids for 20 min or filtered onto 1-cm, 0.45-mm cellulose nitrate filter paper circles. Some grids were negatively stained in 2% uranyl acetate in water. Other grids and filters were washed in PBS containing 0.01 m glycine and subsequently processed like coverslips as described. Briefly, after blocking in PBS supplemented with 10% FCS, the grids/filters were incubated in primary IgG (20 μg/ml) in 10% FCS (4 h to overnight), washed in PBS containing 0.01 m glycine and 2.5% FCS, and incubated in the secondary goat anti-rabbit 5-nm gold conjugate diluted 1:50 in 10% FCS (2 h). Filters were washed in PBS containing 5% FCS and 0.01 m glycine followed by 100 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, fixed in 1% OsO4 in 100 mm cacodylate buffer for 1 h at 4 °C, treated with1% tannic acid in 100 mm cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), and subsequently stained en bloc in 2% uranyl acetate for 2 h. The filters were then dehydrated in ethanol, embedded in Epox, and processed for routine electron microscopy. Sections were picked up onto 300 mesh nickel grids and stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate. Grids were observed in a Tecnai 12TWIN transmission electron microscope operating at 100 kV. Increase in the intracellular levels of Ca2+ is known to precede the activation of pp60c-Src, a tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates AnxA2 at Tyr-23 (26Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). We investigated the involvement of Tyr-23 phosphorylation in cell surface trafficking of AnxA2 on ionophore treatment. EDTA eluates from cells expressing AnxA2Y23E-GFP and stimulated with ionophore were immunoblotted with GFP antibody to reveal a marked increase in the cell surface levels of AnxA2Y23E-GFP as compared with the vehicle control (Fig. 1A, left panel). However, in cells expressing AnxA2Y23F-GFP, both basal and ionophore-stimulated cell surface levels of AnxA2 were markedly reduced (Fig. 1A, right panel). Ionophore treatment did not result in any significant changes in the intracellular levels of AnxA2 in cells expressing either of the constructs. PGK and Coomassie staining of the gel were used as loading controls for whole cell lysates and EDTA eluates, respectively. Immunoprecipitation of EDTA eluates from cells expressing AnxA2WT-GFP with anti-GFP (Fig. 1B) and anti-AnxA2 antibodies (supplemental Fig. 1A) revealed a marked increase in the cell surface levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated AnxA2. The role of tyrosine phosphorylation in the cell surface translocation of AnxA2 was further confirmed by pretreating the cells with sodium orthovanadate, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, before stimulation with ionophore. For recovery of cell surface proteins we used biotinylation and avidin-based affinity purification. We observed an increase in the ionophore-induced cell surface levels of AnxA2 in cells pretreated with sodium orthovanadate, indicating that augmentation of tyrosine phosphorylation increases the association of AnxA2 to the cell surface (supplemental Fig. 1B). These results demonstrate that in addition to intracellular Ca2+, phosphorylation at Tyr-23 regulates the trafficking and association of AnxA2 with the plasma membrane. To investigate the role of Tyr-23 phosphorylation in the association of AnxA2 with the lipid raft domains of the plasma membrane, we separated the plasma membrane into raft and non-raft regions based on their solubility in Triton X-100. Immunoblotting with the non-raft marker, transferrin receptor (Tfr), raft marker caveloin-1, and cytosolic PGK was performed to ascertain the purity of the TS non-raft, low density TI raft, and cytosolic fractions, respectively. Ionophore treatment resulted in increased association of AnxA2Y23E-GFP with the TI raft fractions, which is accompanied by a concomitant increase in the cell surface levels of AnxA2 compared with the cells treated with the DMSO control (Fig. 1C). An increase in the association of AnxA2Y23E-GFP with the TS non-raft fractions was also observed upon ionophore treatment. The association of AnxA2Y23F-GFP with the TI and TS fractions was markedly reduced in ionophore-stimulated cells, and a decrease in the cell surface expression of AnxA2 was also evident in both the ionophore and DMSO-treated cells (Fig. 1D). To further demonstrate the importance of Tyr-23 phosphorylation in the raft association of AnxA2, cells transfected with AnxA2Y23E-GFP or AnxA2Y23F-GFP were either unstimulated or stimulated with the ionophore. The lipid rafts were subsequently labeled with Alexa 594-conjugated CTXB, which preferentially binds to GM1 gangliosides of the raft microdomains. Immunostaining for CTXB and GFP indicated a predominant colocalization of AnxA2Y23E-GFP with the GM1-rich raft microdomains, which was markedly reduced in the cells expressing AnxA2Y23F-GFP on ionophore treatment (Fig. 2C, right panel). In cells not treated with the ionophore, the extent of lipid raft formation was moderate, and both proteins, AnxA2Y23E-GFP and AnxA2Y23F-GFP, were retained in the cytosol (Fig. 1E). Colocalization analysis was performed using WCIF_imageJ colocalization analysis tool. The extent of colocalization was measured by calculating the Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC), which is used to measure the correlation of intensity distribution between the two channels (red and green), and Manders's overlap coefficient (MOC) indicates the actual overlap of two signals. Because MOC is a true representation of colocalization, we have estimated the extent of colocalization by measuring the MOC. The MOC values for the cells expressing AnxA2Y23E-GFP and AnxA2Y23F-GFP in the presence of the ionophore was measured to be 0.82 ± 0.03 and 0.25 ± 0.05, respectively. These results suggest a significant colocalization of Tyr-23-phosphorylated AnxA2 in the raft domains compared with the non-phosphorylated AnxA2. Immunoprecipitation of TS and TI fractions from cells expressing AnxA2Y23E-GFP, AnxA2Y23F-GFP, and empty GFP vector indicated an increased recovery of AnxA2-GFP in the TI fractions of cells expressing AnxA2Y23E-GFP compared with the cells expressing AnxA2Y23F-GFP (supplemental Fig. 1C). Triton extraction of the cells expressing the empty GFP vector followed by immunoprecipitation of the TS and TI extracts from AnxA2Y23E-GFP-transfected cells with control IgG provided negative controls. We further tested if tyrosine-phosphorylated AnxA2 could be immunoprecipitated from the raft microdomains on ionophore treatment. For this purpose immunoprecipitation with GFP"

A new, rapid diagnostic method, (Cepheid) Xpert MTB/RIF Assay, is an automated sample preparation and real-time PCR instrument, which was shown to have good potential as an alternative to current reference standard sputum microscopy and culture.We performed a clinical validation study on diagnostic accuracy of the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay in a TB and HIV endemic setting. Sputum samples from 292 consecutively enrolled adults from Mbeya, Tanzania, with suspected TB were subject to analysis by the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay. The diagnostic performance of Xpert MTB/RIF Assay was compared to standard sputum smear microscopy and culture. Confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a positive culture was used as a reference standard for TB diagnosis.Xpert MTB/RIF Assay achieved 88.4% (95%CI = 78.4% to 94.9%) sensitivity among patients with a positive culture and 99% (95%CI = 94.7% to 100.0%) specificity in patients who had no TB. HIV status did not affect test performance in 172 HIV-infected patients (58.9% of all participants). Seven additional cases (9.1% of 77) were detected by Xpert MTB/RIF Assay among the group of patients with clinical TB who were culture negative. Within 45 sputum samples which grew non-tuberculous mycobacteria the assay's specificity was 97.8% (95%CI = 88.2% to 99.9%).The Xpert MTB/RIF Assay is a highly sensitive, specific and rapid method for diagnosing TB which has potential to complement the current reference standard of TB diagnostics and increase its overall sensitivity. Its usefulness in detecting sputum smear and culture negative patients needs further study. Further evaluation in high burden TB and HIV areas under programmatic health care settings to ascertain applicability, cost-effectiveness, robustness and local acceptance are required."
https://openalex.org/W2007787730,"Background Steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein related lipid transfer (START) domains are small globular modules that form a cavity where lipids and lipid hormones bind. These domains can transport ligands to facilitate lipid exchange between biological membranes, and they have been postulated to modulate the activity of other domains of the protein in response to ligand binding. More than a dozen human genes encode START domains, and several of them are implicated in a disease. Principal Findings We report crystal structures of the human STARD1, STARD5, STARD13 and STARD14 lipid transfer domains. These represent four of the six functional classes of START domains. Significance Sequence alignments based on these and previously reported crystal structures define the structural determinants of human START domains, both those related to structural framework and those involved in ligand specificity.

In particular, helium spectroscopy has played a crucial role in describing two-electron interactions, determining the fine-structure constant and extracting the size of the helium nucleus. Here we present a measurement of the doubly forbidden 1557-nanometer transition connecting the two metastable states of helium (the lowest energy triplet state 2 (3)S(1) and first excited singlet state 2 (1)S(0)), for which quantum electrodynamic and nuclear size effects are very strong. This transition is weaker by 14 orders of magnitude than the most predominantly measured transition in helium.

https://openalex.org/W2170427457,"Evolutionary adaptation affects demographic resilience to climate change but few studies have attempted to project changes in selective pressures or quantify impacts of trait responses on population dynamics and extinction risk. We used a novel individual-based model to explore potential evolutionary changes in migration timing and the consequences for population persistence in sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka in the Fraser River, Canada, under scenarios of future climate warming. Adult sockeye salmon are highly sensitive to increases in water temperature during their arduous upriver migration, raising concerns about the fate of these ecologically, culturally, and commercially important fish in a warmer future. Our results suggest that evolution of upriver migration timing could allow these salmon to avoid increasingly frequent stressful temperatures, with the odds of population persistence increasing in proportion to the trait heritability and phenotypic variance. With a simulated 2°C increase in average summer river temperatures by 2100, adult migration timing from the ocean to the river advanced by ∼10 days when the heritability was 0.5, while the risk of quasi-extinction was only 17% of that faced by populations with zero evolutionary potential (i.e., heritability fixed at zero). The rates of evolution required to maintain persistence under simulated scenarios of moderate to rapid warming are plausible based on estimated heritabilities and rates of microevolution of timing traits in salmon and related species, although further empirical work is required to assess potential genetic and ecophysiological constraints on phenological adaptation. These results highlight the benefits to salmon management of maintaining evolutionary potential within populations, in addition to conserving key habitats and minimizing additional stressors where possible, as a means to build resilience to ongoing climate change. More generally, they demonstrate the importance and feasibility of considering evolutionary processes, in addition to ecology and demography, when projecting population responses to environmental change."
https://openalex.org/W2031161781,"S-propargyl-cysteine (SPRC), an H(2)S donor, is a structural analogue of S-allycysteine (SAC). It was investigated for its potential anti-cancer effect on SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells and the possible mechanisms that may be involved.SPRC treatment significantly decreased cell viability, suppressed the proliferation and migration of SPRC-7901 gastric cancer cells, was pro-apoptotic as well as caused cell cycle arrest at the G(1)/S phase. In an in vivo study, intra-peritoneal injection of 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg of SPRC significantly reduced tumor weights and tumor volumes of gastric cancer implants in nude mice, with a tumor growth inhibition rate of 40-75%. SPRC also induced a pro-apoptotic effect in cancer tissues and elevated the expressions of p53 and Bax in tumors and cells. SPRC treatment also increased protein expression of cystathione-γ-lyase (CSE) in cells and tumors, and elevated H(2)S levels in cell culture media, plasma and tumoral CSE activity of gastric cancer-induced nude mice by 2, 2.3 and 1.4 fold, respectively. Most of the anti-cancer functions of SPRC on cells and tumors were significantly suppressed by PAG, an inhibitor of CSE activity.Taken together, the results of our study provide insights into a novel anti-cancer effect of H(2)S as well as of SPRC on gastric cancer through inducing the activity of a new target, CSE."
https://openalex.org/W2035202125,"microRNAs (miRs) modulate the expression levels of mRNAs and proteins and can thus contribute to cancer initiation and progression. In addition to their intracelluar function, miRs are released from cells and shed into the circulation. We postulated that circulating miRs could provide insight into pathways altered during cancer progression and may indicate responses to treatment. Here we focus on pancreatic cancer malignant progression. We report that changes in miR expression patterns during progression of normal tissues to invasive pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the p48-Cre/LSL-KrasG12D mouse model mirrors the miR changes observed in human pancreatic cancer tissues. miR-148a/b and miR-375 expression were found decreased whereas miR-10, miR-21, miR-100 and miR-155 were increased when comparing normal tissues, premalignant lesions and invasive carcinoma in the mouse model. Predicted target mRNAs FGFR1 (miR-10) and MLH1 (miR-155) were found downregulated. Quantitation of nine microRNAs in plasma samples from patients distinguished pancreatic cancers from other cancers as well as non-cancerous pancreatic disease. Finally, gemcitabine treatment of control animals and p48-Cre/LSL-KrasG12D animals with pancreatic cancer caused distinct and up to 60-fold changes in circulating miRs that indicate differential drug effects on normal and cancer tissues. These findings support the significance of detecting miRs in the circulation and suggests that circulating miRs could serve as indicators of drug response."
https://openalex.org/W2021723562,"A structural rationale for recent emergence of azole (imidazole and triazole) resistance associated with CYP51 mutations in the wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola is presented, attained by homology modelling of the wild type protein and 13 variant proteins. The novel molecular models of M. graminicola CYP51 are based on multiple homologues, individually identified for each variant, rather than using a single structural scaffold, providing a robust structure-function rationale for the binding of azoles, including important fungal specific regions for which no structural information is available. The wild type binding pocket reveals specific residues in close proximity to the bound azole molecules that are subject to alteration in the variants. This implicates azole ligands as important agents exerting selection on specific regions bordering the pocket, that become the focus of genetic mutation events, leading to reduced sensitivity to that group of related compounds. Collectively, the models account for several observed functional effects of specific alterations, including loss of triadimenol sensitivity in the Y137F variant, lower sensitivity to tebuconazole of I381V variants and increased resistance to prochloraz of V136A variants. Deletion of Y459 and G460, which brings about removal of that entire section of beta turn from the vicinity of the binding pocket, confers resistance to tebuconazole and epoxiconazole, but sensitivity to prochloraz in variants carrying a combination of A379G I381V ΔY459/G460. Measurements of binding pocket volume proved useful in assessment of scope for general resistance to azoles by virtue of their accommodation without bonding interaction, particularly when combined with analysis of change in positions of key amino acids. It is possible to predict the likely binding orientation of an azole molecule in any of the variant CYPs, providing potential for an in silico screening system and reliable predictive approach to assess the probability of particular variants exhibiting resistance to particular azole fungicides."
https://openalex.org/W1964946261,"The net reproductive rate measures the expected lifetime reproductive output of an individual, and plays an important role in demography, ecology, evolution, and epidemiology. Well-established methods exist to calculate it from age- or stage-classified demographic data. As an expectation, provides no information on variability; empirical measurements of lifetime reproduction universally show high levels of variability, and often positive skewness among individuals. This is often interpreted as evidence of heterogeneity, and thus of an opportunity for natural selection. However, variability provides evidence of heterogeneity only if it exceeds the level of variability to be expected in a cohort of identical individuals all experiencing the same vital rates. Such comparisons require a way to calculate the statistics of lifetime reproduction from demographic data. Here, a new approach is presented, using the theory of Markov chains with rewards, obtaining all the moments of the distribution of lifetime reproduction. The approach applies to age- or stage-classified models, to constant, periodic, or stochastic environments, and to any kind of reproductive schedule. As examples, I analyze data from six empirical studies, of a variety of animal and plant taxa (nematodes, polychaetes, humans, and several species of perennial plants)."
https://openalex.org/W2118137158,Interpreting Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) at a gene level is an important step towards understanding the molecular processes that lead to disease. In order to incorporate prior biological knowledge such as pathways and protein interactions in the analysis of GWAS data it is necessary to derive one measure of association for each gene. We compare three different methods to obtain gene-wide test statistics from Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) based association data: choosing the test statistic from the most significant SNP; the mean test statistics of all SNPs; and the mean of the top quartile of all test statistics. We demonstrate that the gene-wide test statistics can be controlled for the number of SNPs within each gene and show that all three methods perform considerably better than expected by chance at identifying genes with confirmed associations. By applying each method to GWAS data for Crohn's Disease and Type 1 Diabetes we identified new potential disease genes.
https://openalex.org/W2063986053,"Background Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer related deaths in America. Monoclonal antibodies are a viable treatment option for inhibiting cancer growth. Tumor specific drug delivery could be achieved utilizing these monoclonal antibodies as targeting agents. This type of designer therapeutic is evolving and with the use of gold nanoparticles it is a promising approach to selectively deliver chemotherapeutics to malignant cells. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are showing extreme promise in current medicinal research. GNPs have been shown to non-invasively kill tumor cells by hyperthermia using radiofrequency. They have also been implemented as early detection agents due to their unique X-ray contrast properties; success was revealed with clear delineation of blood capillaries in a preclinical model by CT (computer tomography). The fundamental parameters for intelligent design of nanoconjugates are on the forefront. The goal of this study is to define the necessary design parameters to successfully target pancreatic cancer cells. Methodology/Principal Findings The nanoconjugates described in this study were characterized with various physico-chemical techniques. We demonstrate that the number of cetuximab molecules (targeting agent) on a GNP, the hydrodynamic size of the nanoconjugates, available reactive surface area and the ability of the nanoconjugates to sequester EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), all play critical roles in effectively targeting tumor cells in vitro and in vivo in an orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer. Conclusion Our results suggest the specific targeting of tumor cells depends on a number of crucial components 1) targeting agent to nanoparticle ratio 2) availability of reactive surface area on the nanoparticle 3) ability of the nanoconjugate to bind the target and 4) hydrodynamic diameter of the nanoconjugate. We believe this study will help define the design parameters for formulating better strategies for specifically targeting tumors with nanoparticle conjugates."
https://openalex.org/W2055318935,"Background Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare devastating demyelinating disease caused by the polyomavirus JC (JCV), occurs in severely immunocompromised patients, most of whom have advanced-stage HIV infection. Despite combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), 50% of patients die within 6 months of PML onset. We conducted a multicenter, open-label pilot trial evaluating the survival benefit of a five-drug cART designed to accelerate HIV replication decay and JCV-specific immune recovery. Methods and Findings All the patients received an optimized cART with three or more drugs for 12 months, plus the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide during the first 6 months. The main endpoint was the one-year survival rate. A total of 28 patients were enrolled. At entry, median CD4+ T-cell count was 53 per microliter and 86% of patients had detectable plasma HIV RNA and CSF JCV DNA levels. Seven patients died, all before month 4. The one-year survival estimate was 0.75 (95% confidence interval, 0.61 to 0.93). At month 6, JCV DNA was undetectable in the CSF of 81% of survivors. At month 12, 81% of patients had undetectable plasma HIV RNA, and the median CD4+ T-cell increment was 105 per microliter. In univariate analysis, higher total and naive CD4+ T-cell counts and lower CSF JCV DNA level at baseline were associated with better survival. JCV-specific functional memory CD4+ T-cell responses, based on a proliferation assay, were detected in 4% of patients at baseline and 43% at M12 (P = 0.008). Conclusions The early use of five-drug cART after PML diagnosis appears to improve survival. This is associated with recovery of anti-JCV T-cell responses and JCV clearance from CSF. A low CD4+ T-cell count (particularly naive subset) and high JCV DNA copies in CSF at PML diagnosis appear to be risk factors for death. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00120367"
https://openalex.org/W2129669381,"More than 30% of all pregnancies in the UK require some form of assistance at delivery, with one of the more severe forms of assistance being an emergency Caesarean section (ECS). Previously it has been shown that the likelihood of a delivery via ECS is positively associated with the birth weight and size of the newborn and negatively with maternal height. Paternal height affects skeletal growth and mass of the fetus, and thus might also affect pregnancy outcomes. We hypothesized that the effect of newborn birth weight on the risk of ECS would decrease with increasing maternal height. Similarly, we predicted that there would be an increase in ECS risk as a function of paternal height, but that this effect would be relative to maternal height (i.e., parental height differences). We used data from the Millennium Cohort Study: a large-scale survey (N = 18,819 births) with data on babies born and their parents from the United Kingdom surveyed 9 to 12-months after birth. We found that in primiparous women, both maternal height and parental height differences interacted with birth weight and predicted the likelihood of an ECS. When carrying a heavy newborn, the risk of ECS was more than doubled for short women (46.3%) compared to tall women (21.7%), in agreement with earlier findings. For women of average height carrying a heavy newborn while having a relatively short compared to tall partner reduced the risk by 6.7%. In conclusion, the size of the baby, the height of the mother and parental height differences affect the likelihood of an ECS in primiparous women."
https://openalex.org/W2003461044,"Background and objectives There is no doubt that the dramatic worldwide increase in obesity prevalence is due to changes in environmental factors. However, twin studies suggest that genetic differences are responsible for the major part of the variation in body mass index (BMI) and other measures of body fatness within populations. Several recent studies suggest that the genetic effects on adiposity may be stronger when combined with presumed risk factors for obesity. We tested the hypothesis that a higher prevalence of obesity and overweight and a higher BMI mean is associated with a larger genetic variation in BMI. Methods The data consisted of self-reported height and weight from two Danish twin surveys in 1994 and 2002. A total of 15,017 monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs were divided into subgroups by year of birth (from 1931 through 1982) and sex. The genetic and environmental variance components of BMI were calculated for each subgroup using the classical twin design. Likewise, the prevalence of obesity, prevalence of overweight and the mean of the BMI distribution was calculated for each subgroup and tested as explanatory variables in a random effects meta-regression model with the square root of the additive genetic variance (equal to the standard deviation) as the dependent variable. Results The size of additive genetic variation was positively and significantly associated with obesity prevalence (p = 0.001) and the mean of the BMI distribution (p = 0.015). The association with prevalence of overweight was positive but not statistically significant (p = 0.177). Conclusion The results suggest that the genetic variation in BMI increases as the prevalence of obesity, prevalence of overweight and the BMI mean increases. The findings suggest that the genes related to body fatness are expressed more aggressively under the influence of an obesity-promoting environment."
https://openalex.org/W2103522217,"We have detected directly the interactions of sarcolipin (SLN) and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA) by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fusion proteins labeled with cyan fluorescent protein (donor) and yellow fluorescent protein (acceptor). SLN is a membrane protein that helps control contractility by regulating SERCA activity in fast-twitch and atrial muscle. Here we used FRET microscopy and spectroscopy with baculovirus expression in insect cells to provide direct evidence for: 1) oligomerization of SLN and 2) regulatory complex formation between SLN and the fast-twitch muscle Ca-ATPase (SERCA1a isoform). FRET experiments demonstrated that SLN monomers self-associate into dimers and higher order oligomers in the absence of SERCA, and that SLN monomers also bind to SERCA monomers in a 1:1 binary complex when the two proteins are coexpressed. FRET experiments further demonstrated that the binding affinity of SLN for itself is similar to that for SERCA. Mutating SLN residue isoleucine-17 to alanine (I17A) decreased the binding affinity of SLN self-association and converted higher order oligomers into monomers and dimers. The I17A mutation also decreased SLN binding affinity for SERCA but maintained 1:1 stoichiometry in the regulatory complex. Thus, isoleucine-17 plays dual roles in determining the distribution of SLN homo-oligomers and stabilizing the formation of SERCA-SLN heterodimers. FRET results for SLN self-association were supported by the effects of SLN expression in bacterial cells. We propose that SLN exists as multiple molecular species in muscle, including SERCA-free (monomer, dimer, oligomer) and SERCA-bound (heterodimer), with transmembrane zipper residues of SLN serving to stabilize oligomeric interactions."

In this, the first comprehensive analysis of gene expression changes in response to heat shock and MG132 (a proteasome inhibitor), both of which are known to induce heat shock proteins (Hsps), we compared the responses of normal mouse fibrosarcoma cell line, RIF-1, and its thermotolerant variant cell line, TR-RIF-1 (TR), to the two stresses. The cellular responses we examined included Hsp expressions, cell viability, total protein synthesis patterns, and accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins. We also compared the mRNA expression profiles and kinetics, in the two cell lines exposed to the two stresses, using microarray analysis. In contrast to RIF-1 cells, TR cells resist heat shock caused changes in cell viability and whole-cell protein synthesis. The patterns of total cellular protein synthesis and accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins in the two cell lines were distinct, depending on the stress and the cell line. Microarray analysis revealed that the gene expression pattern of TR cells was faster and more transient than that of RIF-1 cells, in response to heat shock, while both RIF-1 and TR cells showed similar kinetics of mRNA expression in response to MG132. We also found that 2,208 genes were up-regulated more than 2 fold and could sort them into three groups: 1) genes regulated by both heat shock and MG132, (e.g. chaperones); 2) those regulated only by heat shock (e.g. DNA binding proteins including histones); and 3) those regulated only by MG132 (e.g. innate immunity and defense related molecules). This study shows that heat shock and MG132 share some aspects of HSR signaling pathway, at the same time, inducing distinct stress response signaling pathways, triggered by distinct abnormal proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2043593745,"Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) and global genomic repair (GGR) are two pathways of nucleotide excision repair (NER). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rad26 is important but not absolutely required for TCR. Rpb4, a nonessential RNA polymerase II (Pol II) subunit that forms a subcomplex with Rpb7, and the Spt4-Spt5 complex, a transcription elongation factor, have been shown to suppress Rad26-independent TCR. The Pol II-associated factor 1 complex (Paf1C) has been shown to function in transcription elongation, 3′-processing of mRNAs, and posttranslational modification of histones. Here we show that Paf1C plays a marginal role in facilitating Rad26-dependent TCR but significantly suppresses Rad26-independent TCR. The suppression of Rad26-independent TCR is achieved by cooperating with Spt4-Spt5. We propose a model that, in the absence of Rad26, a lesion is “locked” in the active center of a Pol II elongation complex, which is stabilized by the coordinated interactions of Rpb4-Rpb7, Spt4-Spt5, and Paf1C with each other and with the core Pol II. We also found that Paf1C facilitates GGR, especially in internucleosomal linker regions. The facilitation of GGR is achieved through enabling monoubiquitination of histone H2B lysine 123 by Bre1, which in turn permits di- and trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 79 by Dot1. To our best knowledge, among the NER-modulating factors documented so far, Paf1C appears to have the most diverse functions in different NER pathways or subpathways.

The suppression of Rad26-independent TCR is achieved by cooperating with Spt4-Spt5. We propose a model that, in the absence of Rad26, a lesion is “locked” in the active center of a Pol II elongation complex, which is stabilized by the coordinated interactions of Rpb4-Rpb7, Spt4-Spt5, and Paf1C with each other and with the core Pol II. We also found that Paf1C facilitates GGR, especially in internucleosomal linker regions. The facilitation of GGR is achieved through enabling monoubiquitination of histone H2B lysine 123 by Bre1, which in turn permits di- and trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 79 by Dot1. To our best knowledge, among the NER-modulating factors documented so far, Paf1C appears to have the most diverse functions in different NER pathways or subpathways. Almost all cellular organisms are equipped with multiple DNA repair pathways to contend with constantly occurring DNA damage caused by endogenous and exogenous DNA-damaging agents (1Friedberg E.C.

NER is a multistep reaction that requires the coordinated action of over 30 proteins implicated in damage recognition, helix opening, lesion verification, dual incision of the damaged strand bracketing the lesion, removal of an oligonucleotide containing the lesion, gap-filling DNA synthesis, and ligation. Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is an NER pathway dedicated to rapid repair in the transcribed strand (TS) of actively transcribed genes. Global genomic repair (GGR) is the other NER pathway that removes lesions throughout the genome, including the nontranscribed strand (NTS) of actively transcribed genes. The two NER pathways share most of the common NER factors but differ in the damage recognition step. nucleotide excision repair cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer global genomic repair nontranscribed strand transcription-coupled repair transcribed strand histone H3 lysine 79 histone H2B lysine 123 RNA polymerase II-associated factor 1 complex RNA polymerase II C-terminal repeat. TCR is believed to be initiated by an RNA polymerase stalled at a lesion in the TS of active genes (2Hanawalt P.C. Spivak G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 958-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). However, TCR in eukaryotic cells appears to be extremely complicated, and the biochemical mechanism of the process is still largely unknown. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rad26, a DNA-stimulated ATPase that is homologous to the human CSB protein (3Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18314-18317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), plays an important role in TCR (4van Gool A.J. Verhage R. Swagemakers S.M. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Troelstra C. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5361-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, TCR is not solely dependent on Rad26 because a substantial extent of TCR still occurs in rad26Δ cells (5Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 6Li S. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Rpb9, a nonessential subunit of the 12-subunit (Rpb1–12) RNA polymerase II (Pol II), has been shown to be required for Rad26-independnet TCR (5Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Rad26-independent TCR has been shown to be suppressed by at least three proteins, namely Rpb4 (5Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), Spt4 (8Jansen L.E. den Dulk H. Brouns R.M. de Ruijter M. Brandsma J.A. Brouwer J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6498-6507Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and Spt5 (9Ding B. LeJeune D. Li S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 5317-5326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Rpb4 is another nonessential Pol II subunit that forms a subcomplex with Rpb7. The Rpb4-Rpb7 subcomplex is associated with the 10-subunit core Pol II through a “wedge” structure on Rpb7, “pushing” the clamp of the core Pol II to a closed position (10Armache K.J. Kettenberger H. Cramer P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6964-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 11Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6969-6973Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Spt4 forms a complex with Spt5, which physically interacts with Pol II (12Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). It was found recently that the role of Spt4 in suppressing Rad26-independent TCR is indirectly achieved by protecting Spt5 from degradation and by stabilizing the interaction of Spt5 with Pol II (9Ding B. LeJeune D. Li S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 5317-5326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the C-terminal repeat (CTR) domain of Spt5, which contains 15 copies of a six-amino acid sequence that can be phosphorylated by the Bur kinase, is responsible for suppressing Rad26-independent TCR (9Ding B. LeJeune D. Li S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 5317-5326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Rad7, Rad16 (13Verhage R. Zeeman A.M. de Groot N. Gleig F. Bang D.D. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6135-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and Elc1 (14Lejeune D. Chen X. Ruggiero C. Berryhill S. Ding B. Li S. DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) are specifically required for GGR in yeast. The exact roles of these proteins in GGR are not yet clear. It has been proposed that the Rad7-Rad16 complex may act as an ATP-dependent motor that translocates along the DNA in search of damage, and upon encountering a lesion, the complex is stalled, which may remodel and open damaged chromatin, thereby facilitating recruitment of other NER factors (15Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6292-6296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Elc1 has been shown to be a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase that contains Rad7 and Rad16 (16Gillette T.G. Yu S. Zhou Z. Waters R. Johnston S.A. Reed S.H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2529-2538PubMed Google Scholar). This E3 ubiquitin ligase has been shown to ubiquitinate Rad4, an essential NER factor required for both GGR and TCR. Optimal NER correlates with the ubiquitination of Rad4 but not its subsequent degradation (16Gillette T.G. Yu S. Zhou Z. Waters R. Johnston S.A. Reed S.H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2529-2538PubMed Google Scholar). Elc1 has also been suggested to be a component of another ubiquitin ligase complex, which contains Ela1, Cul3, and Roc1 but not Rad7 and Rad16, and is required for ubiquitination and degradation of Rpb1, the largest subunit of Pol II (17Ribar B. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3211-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The basic repeating component of chromatin in eukaryotic cells is the nucleosome, which is composed of 146 base pairs of DNA wrapped around a protein octamer containing two molecules of each of the four core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (18Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6927) Google Scholar). Although the packaging of DNA in chromatin can restrict the NER machinery, especially the GGR machinery, from accessing sites of DNA damage, limited pieces of evidence have emerged recently that chromatin metabolism may also play an active role in the repair process (19Waters R. Teng Y. Yu Y. Yu S. Reed S.H. DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For example, acetylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 and/or 14 by the acetyltransferase Gcn5 facilitates GGR (20Teng Y. Liu H. Gill H.W. Yu Y. Waters R. Reed S.H. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Yu Y. Teng Y. Liu H. Reed S.H. Waters R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 8650-8655Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Also, SWI/SNF, an ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex, has been shown to be recruited to chromatin upon induction of DNA damage by UV (22Gong F. Fahy D. Smerdon M.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 902-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A critical piece of evidence indicating the active engagement of chromatin in GGR is the recent discovery that methylation of histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79), catalyzed by the histone methyltransferase Dot1, is required for GGR but plays no role in TCR in yeast (23Tatum D. Li S. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 17530-17535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The Lys-79 residues of the two histone H3 molecules contained in a nucleosome are located at the top and bottom surfaces of the nucleosome disk and most likely regulate interactions with exogenous proteins (24White C.L. Suto R.K. Luger K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5207-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the methylated H3K79 may serve as a docking site for the GGR machinery on the chromatin (23Tatum D. Li S. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 17530-17535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The highly conserved Pol II-associated factor 1 complex (Paf1C), which is abundant in simple and complex eukaryotic cells, directly interacts with Pol II and chromatin at both promoter regions and throughout the coding regions of genes (for a recent review, see Ref. 25Jaehning J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1799: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In yeast, Paf1C is composed of Paf1, Rtf1, Cdc73, Leo1, and Ctr9, whereas in human cells, Paf1C also contains Ski8. Paf1C is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including transcription elongation, 3′-processing of mRNAs, and modification of chromatin. Genome-wide gene expression analyses have shown that Paf1C affects transcription of a small number of yeast genes, among which are many cell wall biosynthetic genes and a subset of cell cycle-regulated genes but no NER genes (26Chang M. French-Cornay D. Fan H.Y. Klein H. Denis C.L. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1056-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 27Porter S.E. Washburn T.M. Chang M. Jaehning J.A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 830-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although Paf1C binds to Pol II, the major functions of Paf1C may be independent of Pol II. Indeed, loss of Rtf1 or Cdc73, which results in loss of Paf1 factors from chromatin and from the Pol II complex, has little phenotypic consequence (28Mueller C.L. Porter S.E. Hoffman M.G. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Also, loss of Paf1, which results in severe phenotypes and reduced amounts of other Paf1C components, has little effect on the abundance or chromatin distribution of Pol II (28Mueller C.L. Porter S.E. Hoffman M.G. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Paf1C has been shown to be required for Bre1-catalyzed monoubiquitination of histone H2B lysine 123 (H2BK123) (29Krogan N.J. Dover J. Wood A. Schneider J. Heidt J. Boateng M.A. Dean K.

In this paper, we identified Paf1C as a new suppressor of Rad26-independent TCR. We also discovered that Paf1C plays a marginal role in facilitating Rad26-dependent TCR and enhances GGR, especially in internucleosomal linker regions. Furthermore, we present evidence that the different roles of Paf1C in the different NER pathways or subpathways are manifested through different mechanisms.

Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in YPD medium (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% glucose), and sequential 10-fold dilutions were made. The diluted samples were spotted onto YPD plates. When the spots had dried, the plates were irradiated with different doses of 254-nm UV light. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3–4 days in the dark prior to being photographed. Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in minimal media containing 2% glucose or 2% galactose (to induce a gene under the control of the GAL1 promoter) to late log phase (A600 ≈ 1.0), washed twice with ice-cold water, resuspended in ice-cold 2% glucose (for glucose cultures) or 2% galactose (for galactose cultures), and irradiated with 80 J/m2 of 254-nm UV light. One-tenth volume of a stock solution containing 10% yeast extract and 20% peptone was added to the irradiated cell suspension. The cells were incubated at 30 °C in the dark to allow them to repair their DNA, and aliquots were collected at different time points. Genomic DNA was isolated from the cells as described previously (5Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The induction and repair of CPDs at individual sites in each strand of the RPB2 gene were measured using a method we developed previously (41Li S. Waters R. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1549-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 42Li S. Waters R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 31-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 43Li S. Waters R. Smerdon M.J. Methods. 2000; 22: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼1 μg of genomic DNA was digested with DraI to release the RPB2 fragment and incised at CPDs with an excess amount of purified T4 endonuclease V (Epicenter). Two biotinylated oligonucleotides were then used to specifically “fish out” and label the TS and NTS of the RPB2 gene fragment, respectively. One pmol of one of the oligonucleotides was mixed with each of the samples. The mixtures were heated at 95 °C for 5 min to denature the DNA and then cooled to an annealing temperature of around 50 °C. One hundred μg of streptavidin magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin, Invitrogen) was added to each of the mixtures to capture the strand of the RPB2 fragment hybridized to the biotinylated oligonucleotide. The other unwanted genomic DNA fragments were washed away. The fragments captured on the magnetic beads were 3′-end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP and Sequenase Version 2 (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). The labeled fragments were resolved on sequencing gels, which were then dried and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen (Bio-Rad). The signal intensities at gel bands corresponding to CPD sites were quantified by using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The percentages of CPDs remaining at individual sites after different times of repair incubation were calculated, and the times required for repairing 50% of CPDs (t½) were obtained by either linear or second order polynomial regression. Yeast cells were cultured at 30 °C in minimal medium to late log phase and harvested. The cells harvested from a 25-ml culture were washed with and resuspended in 0.5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.4 mm Na4VO3, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors) (44Chen X. Ruggiero C. Li S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4617-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The cells were broken by vortexing with acid-washed glass beads, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Fifty μl of the lysate was saved as “input.” The remaining lysate was added with 15 μg of 8WG16 (Neoclone), which recognizes the C-terminal heptapeptide repeats of Rpb1, the largest subunit of Pol II (45Thompson N.E. Steinberg T.H. Aronson D.B. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11511-11520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight with gentle rotation. Protein A-coated agarose beads (Sigma) were added to the mixture and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h with gentle rotation. The beads were washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and twice with immunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in 50 μl of 2 × SDS-polyacrylamide gel loading buffer. ChIP was carried out as described previously with slight modifications (46Li S. Chen X. Ruggiero C. Ding B. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36643-36651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, log phase cells with or without UV irradiation were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and lysed in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and phosphatase and protease inhibitors) by vortexing with glass beads. The cell lysates were sonicated to shear the DNA to an average size of ∼300 bp by using a Bioruptor (UCD-200, Diagenode). Chromatin fragments were immunoprecipitated with antibodies recognizing mono-, di-, and trimethylated H3K79 and total histone H3 (Abcam). Cross-links were reversed by incubation at 65 °C overnight. DNA in the immunoprecipitated chromatin samples was purified by using the DNA Clean & Concentrator kit (Zymo Research). A 150-bp fragment in the RPB2 gene coding region (corresponding to nucleotides 177–327 downstream of the translation start codon ATG) was amplified by PCR using the purified DNA samples as templates. Protein samples were resolved on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Protein bands of interest were detected with primary and secondary antibodies and SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce). The blots were scanned with the ChemiDocTM XRS+ system (Bio-Rad). Band intensities were quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). To determine the role of Paf1C in TCR, we deleted genes encoding Paf1C components in rad16Δ cells, which are deficient in GGR (13Verhage R. Zeeman A.M. de Groot N. Gleig F. Bang D.D. van de Putte P.

https://openalex.org/W2129513838,"Background Listeria adhesion protein (LAP) is a housekeeping bifunctional enzyme consisting of N-terminal acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and C-terminal alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). It aids Listeria monocytogenes in crossing the epithelial barrier through a paracellular route by interacting with its host receptor, heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60). To gain insight into the binding interaction between LAP and Hsp60, LAP subdomain(s) participating in the Hsp60 interaction were investigated. Methods Using a ModBase structural model, LAP was divided into 4 putative subdomains: the ALDH region contains N1 (Met1–Pro223) and N2 (Gly224–Gly411), and the ADH region contains C1 (Gly412–Val648) and C2 (Pro649–Val866). Each subdomain was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Purified subdomains were used in ligand overlay, immunofluorescence, and bead-based epithelial cell adhesion assays to analyze each domain's affinity toward Hsp60 protein or human ileocecal epithelial HCT-8 cells. Results The N2 subdomain exhibited the greatest affinity for Hsp60 with a KD of 9.50±2.6 nM. The KD of full-length LAP (7.2±0.5 nM) to Hsp60 was comparable to the N2 value. Microspheres (1 µm diameter) coated with N2 subdomain showed significantly (P<0.05) higher binding to HCT-8 cells than beads coated with other subdomains and this binding was inhibited when HCT-8 cells were pretreated with anti-Hsp60 antibody to specifically block epithelial Hsp60. Furthermore, HCT-8 cells pretreated with purified N2 subdomain also reduced L. monocytogenes adhesion by about 4 log confirming its involvement in interaction with epithelial cells. Conclusion These data indicate that the N2 subdomain in the LAP ALDH domain is critical in initiating interaction with mammalian cell receptor Hsp60 providing insight into the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis for the development of potential anti-listerial control strategies."

Paradoxically, in breast cancer cells that have been chronically deprived of estrogen stimulation, re-introduction of the hormone can induce apoptosis. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we sought to identify signaling networks that are triggered by estradiol (E2) in isogenic MCF-7 breast cancer cells that undergo apoptosis (MCF-7:5C) versus cells that proliferate upon exposure to E2 (MCF-7). The nuclear receptor co-activator AIB1 (Amplified in Breast Cancer-1) is known to be rate-limiting for E2-induced cell survival responses in MCF-7 cells and was found here to also be required for the induction of apoptosis by E2 in the MCF-7:5C cells. Proteins that interact with AIB1 as well as complexes that contain tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation and identified by mass spectrometry (MS) at baseline and after a brief exposure to E2 for two hours. Bioinformatic network analyses of the identified protein interactions were then used to analyze E2 signaling pathways that trigger apoptosis versus survival. Comparison of MS data with a computationally-predicted AIB1 interaction network showed that 26 proteins identified in this study are within this network, and are involved in signal transduction, transcription, cell cycle regulation and protein degradation. Conclusions G-protein-coupled receptors, PI3 kinase, Wnt and Notch signaling pathways were most strongly associated with E2-induced proliferation or apoptosis and are integrated here into a global AIB1 signaling network that controls qualitatively distinct responses to estrogen."
https://openalex.org/W2023485202,"Whether anthropogenic mortality is additive or compensatory to natural mortality in animal populations has long been a question of theoretical and practical importance. Theoretically, under density-dependent conditions populations compensate for anthropogenic mortality through decreases in natural mortality and/or increases in productivity, but recent studies of large carnivores suggest that anthropogenic mortality can be fully additive to natural mortality and thereby constrain annual survival and population growth rate. Nevertheless, mechanisms underlying either compensatory or additive effects continue to be poorly understood. Using long-term data on a reintroduced population of the red wolf, we tested for evidence of additive vs. compensatory effects of anthropogenic mortality on annual survival and population growth rates, and the preservation and reproductive success of breeding pairs. We found that anthropogenic mortality had a strong additive effect on annual survival and population growth rate at low population density, though there was evidence for compensation in population growth at high density. When involving the death of a breeder, anthropogenic mortality was also additive to natural rates of breeding pair dissolution, resulting in a net decrease in the annual preservation of existing breeding pairs. However, though the disbanding of a pack following death of a breeder resulted in fewer recruits per litter relative to stable packs, there was no relationship between natural rates of pair dissolution and population growth rate at either high or low density. Thus we propose that short-term additive effects of anthropogenic mortality on population growth in the red wolf population at low density were primarily a result of direct mortality of adults rather than indirect socially-mediated effects resulting in reduced recruitment. Finally, we also demonstrate that per capita recruitment and the proportion of adults that became reproductive declined steeply with increasing population density, suggesting that there is potential for density-dependent compensation of anthropogenically-mediated population regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1986702492,"Background Breastfeeding protects against illnesses and death in hazardous environments, an effect partly mediated by improved immune function. One hypothesis suggests that factors within milk supplement the inadequate immune response of the offspring, but this has not been able to account for a series of observations showing that factors within maternally derived milk may supplement the development of the immune system through a direct effect on the primary lymphoid organs. In a previous human study we reported evidence suggesting a link between IL-7 in breast milk and the thymic output of infants. Here we report evidence in mice of direct action of maternally-derived IL-7 on T cell development in the offspring. Methods and Findings We have used recombinant IL-7 labelled with a fluorescent dye to trace the movement in live mice of IL-7 from the stomach across the gut and into the lymphoid tissues. To validate the functional ability of maternally derived IL-7 we cross fostered IL-7 knock-out mice onto normal wild type mothers. Subsets of thymocytes and populations of peripheral T cells were significantly higher than those found in knock-out mice receiving milk from IL-7 knock-out mothers. Conclusions/Significance Our study provides direct evidence that interleukin 7, a factor which is critical in the development of T lymphocytes, when maternally derived can transfer across the intestine of the offspring, increase T cell production in the thymus and support the survival of T cells in the peripheral secondary lymphoid tissue."

This G-rich gag hotspot for recombination contains three evenly spaced G-runs that stalled reverse transcriptase. Disruption of the G-runs suppressed both the associated pausing and strand transfer in vitro. Significantly, this same gag sequence was able to fold into a G-quartet monomer, dimer, and tetramer, depending on the cations employed. The pause band at the G-run (nucleotide (nt) 405–409), which was predicted to be involved in forming a G-quartet monomer, diminished with increased HIV-1 nucleocapsid (NC) protein. More NC induced stronger pauses at other G-runs (nt 363–367 and nt 382–384), a region that forms a G-quartet dimer, adhering the two RNA templates. We hypothesized that NC induces the unfolding of the monomeric G-quartet but stabilizes the dimeric interaction. We tested this by inserting a known G-quartet formation sequence, 5′-(UGGGGU)4-3′, into a relatively structure-free template from the HIV-1 pol gene. Strand transfer assays were performed with cations that either encourage (K+) or discourage (Li+) G-quartet formation with or without NC. Strikingly, a G-quartet monomer was observed without NC, whereas a G-quartet dimer was observed with NC, both only in the presence of K+. Moreover, the transfer efficiency of the dimerized template (with K+ and NC) reached about 90%, approximately 2.5-fold of that of the non-dimerized template. Evidently, template dimerization induced by NC creates a proximity effect, leading to the unique high peak of transfer at the gag recombination hotspot.

https://openalex.org/W1973032506,"There is a growing body of evidence that bacterial cell division is an intricate coordinated process of comparable complexity to that seen in eukaryotic cells. The dynamic assembly of Escherichia coli FtsZ in the presence of GTP is fundamental to its activity. FtsZ polymerization is a very attractive target for novel antibiotics given its fundamental and universal function. In this study our aim was to understand further the GTP-dependent FtsZ polymerization mechanism and our main focus is on the pH dependence of its behaviour. A key feature of this work is the use of linear dichroism (LD) to follow the polymerization of FtsZ monomers into polymeric structures. LD is the differential absorption of light polarized parallel and perpendicular to an orientation direction (in this case that provided by shear flow). It thus readily distinguishes between FtsZ polymers and monomers. It also distinguishes FtsZ polymers and less well-defined aggregates, which light scattering methodologies do not. The polymerization of FtsZ over a range of pHs was studied by right-angled light scattering to probe mass of FtsZ structures, LD to probe real-time formation of linear polymeric fibres, a specially developed phosphate release assay to relate guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis to polymer formation, and electron microscopy (EM) imaging of reaction products as a function of time and pH. We have found that lowering the pH from neutral to 6.5 does not change the nature of the FtsZ polymers in solution—it simply facilitates the polymerization so the fibres present are longer and more abundant. Conversely, lowering the pH to 6.0 has much the same effect as introducing divalent cations or the FtsZ-associated protein YgfE (a putative ZapA orthologue in E. coli)—it stablizes associations of protofilaments."
https://openalex.org/W2043712143,"Abnormal mitochondrial function is a widely reported contributor to neurodegenerative disease including Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, a mechanistic link between mitochondrial dysfunction and the initiation of neuropathology remains elusive. In AD, one of the earliest hallmark pathologies is neuropil threads comprising accumulated hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein (MAP) tau in neurites. Rod-like aggregates of actin and its associated protein cofilin (AC rods) also occur in AD. Using a series of antibodies - AT270, AT8, AT100, S214, AT180, 12E8, S396, S404 and S422 - raised against different phosphoepitopes on tau, we characterize the pattern of expression and re-distribution in neurites of these phosphoepitope labels during mitochondrial inhibition. Employing chick primary neuron cultures, we demonstrate that epitopes recognized by the monoclonal antibody 12E8, are the only species rapidly recruited into AC rods. These results were recapitulated with the actin depolymerizing drug Latrunculin B, which induces AC rods and a concomitant increase in the 12E8 signal measured on Western blot. This suggests that AC rods may be one way in which MAP redistribution and phosphorylation is influenced in neurons during mitochondrial stress and potentially in the early pathogenesis of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2024951795,"Mitochondria are indispensable in the life and death of many types of eukaryotic cells. In pancreatic beta cells, mitochondria play an essential role in the secretion of insulin, a hormone that regulates blood glucose levels. Unregulated blood glucose is a hallmark symptom of diabetes. The onset of Type 1 diabetes is preceded by autoimmune-mediated destruction of beta cells. However, the exact role of mitochondria has not been assessed in beta cell death. In this study, we examine the role of mitochondria in both Fas- and proinflammatory cytokine-mediated destruction of the human beta cell line, βLox5. IFNγ primed βLox5 cells for apoptosis by elevating cell surface Fas. Consequently, βLox5 cells were killed by caspase-dependent apoptosis by agonistic activation of Fas, but only after priming with IFNγ. This beta cell line undergoes both apoptotic and necrotic cell death after incubation with the combination of the proinflammatory cytokines IFNγ and TNFα. Additionally, both caspase-dependent and -independent mechanisms that require proper mitochondrial function are involved. Mitochondrial contributions to βLox5 cell death were analyzed using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depleted βLox5 cells, or βLox5 ρ(0) cells. βLox5 ρ(0) cells are not sensitive to IFNγ and TNFα killing, indicating a direct role for the mitochondria in cytokine-induced cell death of the parental cell line. However, βLox5 ρ(0) cells are susceptible to Fas killing, implicating caspase-dependent extrinsic apoptotic death is the mechanism by which these human beta cells die after Fas ligation. These data support the hypothesis that immune mediators kill βLox5 cells by both mitochondrial-dependent intrinsic and caspase-dependent extrinsic pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1989472917,"Mg homeostasis is critical to eukaryotic cells, but the contribution of Mg transporter activity to homeostasis is not fully understood. In yeast, Mg uptake is primarily mediated by the Alr1 transporter, which also allows low affinity uptake of other divalent cations such as Ni(2+), Mn(2+), Zn(2+) and Co(2+). Using Ni(2+) uptake to assay Alr1 activity, we observed approximately nine-fold more activity under Mg-deficient conditions. The mnr2 mutation, which is thought to block release of vacuolar Mg stores, was associated with increased Alr1 activity, suggesting Alr1 was regulated by intracellular Mg supply. Consistent with a previous report of the regulation of Alr1 expression by Mg supply, Mg deficiency and the mnr2 mutation both increased the accumulation of a carboxy-terminal epitope-tagged version of the Alr1 protein (Alr1-HA). However, Mg supply had little effect on ALR1 promoter activity or mRNA levels. In addition, while Mg deficiency caused a seven-fold increase in Alr1-HA accumulation, the N-terminally tagged and untagged Alr1 proteins increased less than two-fold. These observations argue that the Mg-dependent accumulation of the C-terminal epitope-tagged protein was primarily an artifact of its modification. Plasma membrane localization of YFP-tagged Alr1 was also unaffected by Mg supply, indicating that a change in Alr1 location did not explain the increased activity we observed. We conclude that variation in Alr1 protein accumulation or location does not make a substantial contribution to its regulation by Mg supply, suggesting Alr1 activity is directly regulated via as yet unknown mechanisms."

In the current study, the stamen carpelloid (SC) mutants, HGMS and AMS, of B. rapa and B. napus were investigated and two types of AP3 genes, B.AP3.a and B.AP3.b, were functional characterized. B.AP3.a and B.AP3.b share high similarity in amino acid sequences except for 8 residues difference located at the C-terminus. Loss of this 8 residues in B.AP3.b led to the change of PI-derived motifs. Meanwhile, B.AP3.a specified petal and stamen development, whereas B.AP3.b only specified stamen development. In B. rapa, the mutations of both genes generated the SC mutant HGMS. In B. napus that contained two B.AP3.a and two B.AP3.b, loss of the two B.AP3.a functions was the key reason for the apetalous mutation, however, the loss-of-function in all four AP3 was related to the SC mutant AMS. We inferred that the 8 residues or the PI-derived motif in AP3 gene probably relates to petal formation."

Optimization of the wild-type envelope glycoproteins to create immunogens that can elicit effective neutralizing antibodies is a high priority. Starting with ten genes encoding subtype B HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoproteins and using in vitro homologous DNA recombination, we created chimeric gp120 variants that were screened for their ability to bind neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Hundreds of variants were identified with novel antigenic phenotypes that exhibit considerable sequence diversity. Immunization of rabbits with these gp120 variants demonstrated that the majority can induce neutralizing antibodies to HIV-1. One novel variant, called ST-008, induced significantly improved neutralizing antibody responses when assayed against a large panel of primary HIV-1 isolates. Further study of various deletion constructs of ST-008 showed that the enhanced immunogenicity results from a combination of effective DNA priming, an enhanced V3-based response, and an improved response to the constant backbone sequences."

We used these two RIL populations to determine the genetic basis of seed dormancy and flowering time, which are assumed to be the main traits controlling life history variation in Arabidopsis. The analysis revealed quantitative variation for seed dormancy that is associated with allelic variation at the seed dormancy QTL DOG1 (for Delay Of Germination 1) in one population and at DOG6 in both. These DOG QTL have been previously identified using mapping populations derived from accessions collected at different sites around the world. Genetic variation within a population may enhance its ability to respond accurately to variation within and between seasons. In contrast, variation for flowering time, which also segregated within each mapping population, is mainly governed by the same QTL."

However, the mechanisms by which neuronal ensembles are generated and modified are not known. Here we show that in rat hippocampal slices associative synaptic plasticity enables ensembles of neurons to change by incorporating neurons belonging to different ensembles. Associative synaptic plasticity redistributes the composition of different ensembles recruited by distinct inputs such as to specifically increase the similarity between the ensembles. These results show that in the hippocampus, the ensemble of neurons recruited by a given afferent projection is fluid and can be rapidly and persistently modified to specifically include neurons from different ensembles. This linking of ensembles may contribute to the formation of associative memories."

In this study, we developed a computational approach to predict viral sequence hotspots for binding to host proteins based on sequences of viral and host proteins and literature-curated virus-host protein interactome data. We use a motif discovery algorithm repeatedly on collections of sequences of viral proteins and immediate binding partners of their host targets and choose only those motifs that are conserved on viral sequences and highly statistically enriched among binding partners of virus protein targeted host proteins. Our results match experimental data on binding sites of Nef to host proteins such as MAPK1, VAV1, LCK, HCK, HLA-A, CD4, FYN, and GNB2L1 with high statistical significance but is a poor predictor of Nef binding sites on highly flexible, hoop-like regions. Predicted hotspots recapture CD8 cell epitopes of HIV Nef highlighting their importance in modulating virus-host interactions. Host proteins potentially targeted or outcompeted by Nef appear crowding the T cell receptor, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, and neurotrophin signaling pathways. Scanning of HIV Nef motifs on multiple alignments of hepatitis C protein NS5A produces results consistent with literature, indicating the potential value of the hotspot discovery in advancing our understanding of virus-host crosstalk."
https://openalex.org/W1991501121,"Protein denaturation plays a crucial role in cellular processes. In this study, denaturation of HIV-1 Protease (PR) was investigated by all-atom MD simulations in explicit solvent. The PR dimer and monomer were simulated separately in 9 M acetic acid (9 M AcOH) solution and water to study the denaturation process of PR in acetic acid environment. Direct visualization of the denaturation dynamics that is readily available from such simulations has been presented. Our simulations in 9 M AcOH reveal that the PR denaturation begins by separation of dimer into intact monomers and it is only after this separation that the monomer units start denaturing. The denaturation of the monomers is flagged off by the loss of crucial interactions between the α-helix at C-terminal and surrounding β-strands. This causes the structure to transit from the equilibrium dynamics to random non-equilibrating dynamics. Residence time calculations indicate that denaturation occurs via direct interaction of the acetic acid molecules with certain regions of the protein in 9 M AcOH. All these observations have helped to decipher a picture of the early events in acetic acid denaturation of PR and have illustrated that the α-helix and the β-sheet at the C-terminus of a native and functional PR dimer should maintain both the stability and the function of the enzyme and thus present newer targets for blocking PR function."

Here we report the properties and organization of individual H2Av nucleosomes around genes and transposable elements located in Drosophila heterochromatic regions.

https://openalex.org/W2055734457,"Retinoschisin is encoded by the gene responsible for X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS), an early onset macular degeneration that results in a splitting of the inner layers of the retina and severe loss in vision. Retinoschisin is predominantly expressed and secreted from photoreceptor cells as a homo-oligomer protein; it then associates with the surface of retinal cells and maintains the retina cellular architecture. Many missense mutations in the XLRS1 gene are known to cause intracellular retention of retinoschisin, indicating that the secretion process of the protein is a critical step for its normal function in the retina. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying retinoschisin's secretion remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the role of the F-actin cytoskeleton in the secretion of retinoschisin by treating Weri-Rb1 cells, which are known to secrete retinoschisin, with cytochalasin D, jasplakinolide, Y-27632, and dibutyryl cGMP. Our results show that cytochalasin D and jasplakinolide inhibit retinoschisin secretion, whereas Y-27632 and dibutyryl cGMP enhance secretion causing F-actin alterations. We also demonstrate that high concentrations of taxol, which hyperpolymerizes microtubules, inhibit retinoschisin secretion. Our data suggest that retinoschisin secretion is regulated by the F-actin cytoskeleton, that cGMP or inhibition of ROCK alters F-actin structure enhancing the secretion, and that the microtubule cytoskeleton is also involved in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2056619282,"Background When a researcher uses a program to align two proteins and gets a score, one of her main concerns is how often the program gives a similar score to pairs that are or are not in the same fold. This issue was analysed in detail recently for the program TM-align with its associated TM-score. It was shown that because the TM-score is length independent, it allows a P-value and a hit probability to be defined depending only on the score. Also, it was found that the TM-scores of gapless alignments closely follow an Extreme Value Distribution (EVD). The program ProtDeform for structural protein alignment was developed recently and is characterised by the ability to propose different transformations of different protein regions. Our goal is to analyse its associated score to allow a researcher to have objective reasons to prefer one aligner over another, and carry out a better interpretation of the output. Results The study on the ProtDeform score reveals that it is length independent in a wider score range than TM-scores and that PD-scores of gapless (random) alignments also approximately follow an EVD. On the CASP8 predictions, PD-scores and TM-scores, with respect to native structures, are highly correlated (0.95), and show that around a fifth of the predictions have a quality as low as 99.5% of the random scores. Using the Gold Standard benchmark, ProtDeform has lower probabilities of error than TM-align both at a similar speed. The analysis is extended to homology discrimination showing that, again, ProtDeform offers higher hit probabilities than TM-align. Finally, we suggest using three different P-values according to the three different contexts: Gapless alignments, optimised alignments for fold discrimination and that for superfamily discrimination. In conclusion, PD-scores are at the very least as valuable for prediction scoring as TM-scores, and on the protein classification problem, even more reliable."
