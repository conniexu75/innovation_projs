The values of reaction time for a given sensory-motor reaction show the smallest variation when the subject is alertly expecting the sensory stimulus. Even so, there is considerable variation of reaction time between different subjects. Individual differences are of less interest, however, than the lowest value of reaction time obtainable in optimal circumstances if the minimum time of cortical integration for a sensory-motor reaction is to be studied. The time of cortical integration is obtained by subtracting the afferent and efferent conduction times from the reaction time1."

This result is in distinct contrast to that obtained with calf thymus or wheat germ desoxyribonucleic acid, which are degraded quantitatively to
mononucleotides by this procedure (1, 2)."

https://openalex.org/W1995737726,"IN the course of a study of the mechanisms involved in the solvolytic reactions of glycosides, we have investigated the position of bond fission occurring in the hydrolysis of α- and β-D-methylglucosides. The reactions were carried out in water enriched in oxygen-18, and the methanol produced was isolated by fractional distillation in an efficient column, and then pyrolysed to give carbon monoxide which was examined by a mass spectrometer. We have found that the hydrolysis of α- and β-D-methylglucosides both in 1 N acid solution and in the presence of appropriate methylglucosidases proceeds by fission of the hexose–oxygen bond:"

https://openalex.org/W2045574678,"The problem of how rubber is synthesized in the plant has been divided into two portions: (i) the nature of the monomer used and how this monomer is synthesized, and (ii) the nature of the polymerization reaction by which the monomer is transformed to rubber. With respect to the first, the monomer appears to be the 5-carbon branched-chain compound beta-methylcrotonic acid or a derivative thereof. This substance is synthesized in the plant from acetyl-coA. With respect to the second, no information is available, since polymerization of the 5-carbon monomer units to polymers has not yet been achieved outside the living plant."

https://openalex.org/W1970160953,"EVIDENCE that pyridoxal phosphate is involved in the synthesis of serine by micro-organisms has been provided by Lascelles and Woods1, who found that incorporation of pyridoxal phosphate in the medium stimulated serine synthesis by washed cells of Streptococcus faecalis R. and enabled Leuconostoc mesenteroides to grow in the presence of glycine and a CO2-rich atmosphere instead of serine. Participation of pyridoxal phosphate in serine synthesis in chickens was suggested by the observation that liver extracts from pyridoxine-deflcient chickens showed a reduced ability to incorporate [14C]formate into the β-position of serine2; but hitherto attempts to demonstrate a direct activation by pyridoxal phosphate of serine synthesis by liver extracts have been unsuccessful3."
https://openalex.org/W2092935882,"IT is well known that great difficulties are involved in counting the exact chromosome numbers from mammalian species which have a large number of chromosomes. In the past decade different results have been presented which indicate a variation in the chromosome number in different tissues even within a single mammalian species, including man1; but in many cases the variation shown is apparently a result of errors in the counting or in the technique used, for example, in making squashes, or in both as discussed by Fischberg and Beatty2 and Venge3."

Wilkins2 in England also recorded this mushroom as being antibiotic. Atkinson gave a number of characteristics of the antibiotic substance and also a list of sensitive and insensitive bacterial species, but refrained from naming the substance as a new antibiotic. Its peculiar and haphazard lability defeated attempts to concentrate and purify it, and the work was temporarily abandoned as the mushroom supply ran out."

https://openalex.org/W2079249416,"THE technique of Barker and Summerson1 for the determination of lactic acid in blood has been successfully applied to the determination of this acid in silage2,3 and in milk4. During the course of work which is being carried out jointly in these laboratories and in those of the Department of Bacteriology, Edinburgh and East of Scotland College of Agriculture, on the formation of lactic acid and volatile fatty acids in cultures of lactobacilli, it became clear that the results obtained by the above technique were unsatisfactory. For example, extremely high ‘blanks’ were given by the culture medium itself, and it was found impossible to obtain replicate results with samples of the same cultures. Various dilutions of the uninoculated medium were tried and it was found that even at high dilution substantial development of colour occurred. This was originally thought to be due to the high glucose content of the medium (5 per cent w/v) ; but, again at high dilution, this seemed unlikely. The possible answer may lie in factors involved in the yeast extract incorporated to the extent of 0.5 per cent w/v in the medium."
