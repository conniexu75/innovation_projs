https://openalex.org/W2045714098,"Tumor necrosis factor–α (TNF-α) is a major mediator of both acute and chronic inflammatory responses in many diseases. Tristetraprolin (TTP), the prototype of a class of Cys-Cys-Cys-His (CCCH) zinc finger proteins, inhibited TNF-α production from macrophages by destabilizing its messenger RNA. This effect appeared to result from direct TTP binding to the AU-rich element of the TNF-α messenger RNA. TTP is a cytosolic protein in these cells, and its biosynthesis was induced by the same agents that stimulate TNF-α production, including TNF-α itself. These findings identify TTP as a component of a negative feedback loop that interferes with TNF-α production by destabilizing its messenger RNA. This pathway represents a potential target for anti–TNF-α therapies."

https://openalex.org/W2013336992,"Acquisition of invasive/metastatic potential through protease expression is an essential event in tumor progression. High levels of components of the plasminogen activation system, including urokinase, but paradoxically also its inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1), have been correlated with a poor prognosis for some cancers. We report here that deficient PAI1 expression in host mice prevented local invasion and tumor vascularization of transplanted malignant keratinocytes. When this PAI1 deficiency was circumvented by intravenous injection of a replication-defective adenoviral vector expressing human PAI1, invasion and associated angio-genesis were restored. This experimental evidence demonstrates that host-produced PAI is essential for cancer cell invasion and angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2027045997,"Spike transmission probability between pyramidal cells and interneurons in the CA1 pyramidal layer was investigated in the behaving rat by the simultaneous recording of neuronal ensembles. Population synchrony was strongest during sharp wave (SPW) bursts. However, the increase was three times larger for pyramidal cells than for interneurons. The contribution of single pyramidal cells to the discharge of interneurons was often large (up to 0.6 probability), as assessed by the presence of significant (<3 ms) peaks in the cross-correlogram. Complex-spike bursts were more effective than single spikes. Single cell contribution was higher between SPW bursts than during SPWs or theta activity. Hence, single pyramidal cells can reliably discharge interneurons, and the probability of spike transmission is behavior dependent."

https://openalex.org/W2024352808,"Here, we show that N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) interacts directly and selectively with the intracellular C-terminal domain of the GluR2 subunit of AMPA receptors. The interaction requires all three domains of NSF but occurs between residues Lys-844 and Gln-853 of rat GluR2, with Asn-851 playing a critical role. Loading of decapeptides corresponding to the NSF-binding domain of GluR2 into rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons results in a marked, progressive decrement of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. This reduction in synaptic transmission was also observed when an anti-NSF monoclonal antibody (mAb) was loaded into CA1 neurons. These results demonstrate a previously unsuspected direct interaction in the postsynaptic neuron between two major proteins involved in synaptic transmission and suggest a rapid NSF-dependent modulation of AMPA receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W2092724390,"REVIEW The role of defects as essential entities in semiconductor materials is reviewed. Early experiments with semiconductors were hampered by the extreme sensitivity of the electronic properties to minute concentrations of impurities. Semiconductors were viewed as a family of solids with irreproducible properties. Scientific efforts overcame this idiosyncrasy and turned the art of impurity doping into today's exceedingly useful and reproducible technology that is used to control precisely electrical conductivity, composition, and minority-carrier lifetimes over wide ranges. Native defects such as vacancies and self-interstitials control basic processes, foremost self- and dopant diffusion. The structural properties of dislocations and higher dimensional defects have been studied with atomic resolution, but a thorough theoretical understanding of their electronic properties is incomplete. Reactions between defects within the host lattices are increasingly better understood and are used for gettering and electrical passivation of unwanted impurities. Metastable defects such as DX centers and the EL2-related arsenic antisite are briefly discussed. The recent development of isotopically controlled semiconductors has created new research opportunities in this field."

https://openalex.org/W2018461674,"Munc13-1, a mammalian homolog of C. elegans unc-13p, is thought to be involved in the regulation of synaptic transmission. We now demonstrate that Munc13-1 is a presynaptic high-affinity phorbol ester and diacylglycerol receptor with ligand affinities similar to those of protein kinase C. Munc13-1 associates with the plasma membrane in response to phorbol ester binding and acts as a phorbol ester-dependent enhancer of transmitter release when overexpressed presynaptically in the Xenopus neuromuscular junction. These observations establish Munc13-1 as a novel presynaptic target of the diacylglycerol second messenger pathway that acts in parallel with protein kinase C to regulate neurotransmitter secretion."

https://openalex.org/W2145668416,"The extent to which primary visual cues such as motion or luminance are segregated in different cortical areas is a subject of controversy. To address this issue, we examined cortical activation in the human occipital lobe using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while subjects performed a fixed visual task, object recognition, using three different primary visual cues: motion, texture, or luminance contrast. In the first experiment, a region located on the lateral aspect of the occipital lobe (LO complex) was preferentially activated in all 11 subjects both by luminance and motion-defined object silhouettes compared to full-field moving and stationary noise (ratios, 2.00+/-0.19 and 1.86+/-0.65, respectively). In the second experiment, all subjects showed enhanced activation in the LO complex to objects defined both by luminance and texture contrast compared to full-field texture patterns (ratios, 1.43+/-0.08 and 1.32+/-0.08, respectively). An additional smaller dorsal focus that exhibited convergence of object-related cues appeared to correspond to area V3a or a region slightly anterior to it. These results show convergence of visual cues in LO and provide strong evidence for its role in object processing."

Here, we show that mocha is a null allele of the δ subunit of the adaptor-like protein complex AP-3, which is associated with coated vesicles budding from the trans-Golgi network, and that AP-3 is missing in mocha tissues. In mocha brain, the ZnT-3 transporter is reduced, resulting in a lack of zinc-associated Timm historeactivity in hippocampal mossy fibers. Our results demonstrate that the AP-3 complex is responsible for cargo selection to lysosome-related organelles such as melanosomes and platelet dense granules as well as to neurotransmitter vesicles."

https://openalex.org/W2148156937,"In this study, we demonstrate specific interaction of the GluR2 alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptor subunit C-terminal peptide with an ATPase N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) and alpha- and beta-soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs), as well as dendritic colocalization of these proteins. The assembly of the GluR2-NSF-SNAP complex is ATP hydrolysis reversible and resembles the binding of NSF and SNAP with the SNAP receptor (SNARE) membrane fusion apparatus. We provide evidence that the molar ratio of NSF to SNAP in the GluR2-NSF-SNAP complex is similar to that of the t-SNARE syntaxin-NSF-SNAP complex. NSF is known to disassemble the SNARE protein complex in a chaperone-like interaction driven by ATP hydrolysis. We propose a model in which NSF functions as a chaperone in the molecular processing of the AMPA receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1979231658,"Whereas much is now known about the behavioral importance of the lateral nucleus of the amygdala for the storage of implicit memories of fear, little is known in molecular terms about the signal transduction pathways required for long-term potentiation (LTP) in this nucleus. Using brain slices containing the amygdala, we have studied LTP in the pathway from external capsule to the lateral nucleus, a pathway that mediates information from the auditory cortex important for fear conditioning. We found the induction of LTP is postsynaptic; it is dependent on postsynaptic depolarization, on the influx of Ca2+ into the postsynaptic cell and, at least in part, on the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The LTP is associated with a decrease of paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and is blocked by bath application but not blocked by postsynaptic injection of inhibitors of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent (cAMP-dependent) protein kinase (PKA). Consistent with the possibility that the expression might involve PKA presynaptically, the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin induced synaptic potentiation of this pathway that also was associated with a decrease of PPF, and this potentiation occluded the tetanus-induced LTP."

https://openalex.org/W2129420942,"Serotonin has been implicated in the regulation of a wide range of brain functions involving alternative behavioral states, including the control of mood, aggression, sex, and sleep. Here, we report that in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, serotonin controls a switch between two distinct, on/off states of egg-laying behavior. Through quantitative analysis of the temporal pattern of egg-laying events, we determined that egg laying can be modeled as a novel random process, in which animals fluctuate between discrete behavioral states: an active state, during which eggs are laid in clusters, and an inactive state, during which eggs are retained. Single-cell ablation experiments indicate that two pairs of motor neurons, HSNL/HSNR and VC4/VC5, can induce the active phase by releasing serotonin. These neurons also release acetylcholine, which appears to trigger individual egg-laying events within the active phase. Genetic experiments suggest that determination of the behavioral states observed for C. elegans egg laying may be mediated through protein kinase C-dependent (PKC-dependent) modulation of voltage-gated calcium channels."
https://openalex.org/W2048036743,"The timing and localization of DNA replication initiation in mammalian cells are heritable traits, but it is not known whether initiation requires specific DNA sequences. A site-specific recombination strategy was used to show that DNA sequences previously identified as replication initiation sites could initiate replication when transferred to new chromosomal locations. An 8-kilobase DNA sequence encompassing the origin of DNA replication in the human beta-globin locus initiated replication in the simian genome. Specific deletions within the globin origin did not initiate replication in these chromosomal sites. These data suggest that initiation of DNA replication in mammalian cells requires specific sequence information and extend the replicon hypothesis to higher eukaryotes."

https://openalex.org/W2097986752,"Light is a major environmental signal for the entrainment of circadian rhythms. In Drosophila melanogaster, recent experiments suggest that photic information is transduced to the clock through the timeless gene product, TIM. We provide genetic and spectral evidence supporting the relevance of TIM light responses to clock resetting. A missense mutant TIM, TIM-SL, exhibits greater sensitivity to light in both TIM protein disappearance and locomotor activity phase shifting assays. We show that the wavelength dependence of light-induced decreases in TIM levels and that of light-mediated phase shifting are virtually identical. Analysis of dose response of TIM disappearance in a variety of mutant genotypes suggests cell-autonomous light responses that are largely independent of the canonical visual transduction pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2087299393,"CAPS is a neural/endocrine-specific protein discovered as a cytosolic factor required for Ca2+-activated dense-core vesicle (DCV) exocytosis in permeable neuroendocrine cells. We report that CAPS is also a membrane-associated, peripherally bound protein in brain homogenates that localizes selectively to plasma membranes and to DCVs but not to small clear synaptic vesicles (SVs). CAPS exhibits high affinity and saturable binding to DCVs by interaction with bilayer phospholipids. Specific CAPS antibodies inhibit Ca2+-activated norepinephrine release from lysed synaptosomes that contain membrane-associated CAPS, indicating that membrane-bound CAPS is essential for neural DCV exocytosis. CAPS is a functional component of the exocytotic machinery that localizes selectively to DCVs, and it may confer distinct regulatory features on neuropeptide and biogenic amine transmitter secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1979165244,"Cyclic nucleotide–gated ion channels are composed of four pore-forming subunits. Binding of cyclic nucleotide to a site in the intracellular carboxyl terminus of each subunit leads to channel activation. Since there are four subunits, four binding events are possible. In this study, we investigate the effects of individual binding events on activation by studying channels containing one, two, three, or four functional binding sites. The binding of a single ligand significantly increases opening, although four ligands are required for full activation. The data are inconsistent with models in which the four subunits activate in a single concerted step (Monod-Wyman-Changeux model) or in four independent steps (Hodgkin-Huxley model). Instead, the four subunits may associate and activate as two independent dimers."

https://openalex.org/W2074049452,"More than 40,000 people die annually from rabies worldwide1. Most of these fatalities occur in developing countries, where rabies is endemic, public health resources are inadequate and there is limited access to preventive treatment2. Because of the high cost of vaccines derived from cell culture, many countries still use vaccines produced in sheep, goat or suckling mouse brain3. The stability and low cost for mass production of DNA vaccines would make them ideal for use in developing countries4. To investigate the potential of DNA vaccines for rabies immunization in humans, we vaccinated Macaca fascicularis (Cynomolgus) monkeys with DNA encoding the glycoprotein of the challenge virus standard rabies virus, or with a human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV). The monkeys then were challenged with a non-passaged rabies virus. DNA or HDCV vaccination elicited comparable primary and anamnestic neutralizing antibody responses. All ten vaccinated monkeys (DNA or HDCV) survived a rabies virus challenge, whereas monkeys vaccinated with only the DNA vector developed rabies. Furthermore, serum samples from DNA- or HDCV-vaccinated monkeys neutralized a global spectrum of rabies virus variants in vitro. This study shows that DNA immunization elicits protective immunity in nonhuman primates against lethal challenge with a human viral pathogen of the central nervous system. Our findings indicate that DNA vaccines may have a promising future in human rabies immunization."
https://openalex.org/W1983352835,"Using a novel approach to measure exocytosis in vitro from semi-intact synaptosomes, we establish that the Ca2+-dependent release of glutamate requires cytosolic factors for mobilization from the reserve pool. The cytosolic activity for glutamate release was not satisfied by CAPS, a soluble component required for norepinephrine (NE) release. Moreover, the CAPS-independent glutamate release from synaptic vesicles (SVs) was 200-fold less sensitive to Ca2+ than that required for dense core vesicles (DCVs). The differential regulation of exocytosis by CAPS, Ca2+, and potential novel cytosolic factor(s) suggests that the docking and fusion machinery controlling DCVs has diverged from that regulating glutamate-containing SVs."
https://openalex.org/W1970412310,"Differential localization of calcium channel subtypes in divergent regions of individual neurons strongly suggests that calcium signaling and regulation could be compartmentalized. Region-specific expression of calcium extrusion transporters would serve also to partition calcium regulation within single cells. Little is known about selective localization of the calcium extrusion transporters, nor has compartmentalized calcium regulation within single neurons been studied in detail. Sensory neurons provide an experimentally tractable preparation to investigate this functional compartmentalization. We studied calcium regulation in the outer segment (OS) and inner segment/synaptic terminal (IS/ST) regions of rods and cones. We report these areas can function as separate compartments. Moreover, ionic, pharmacological, and immunolocalization results show that a Ca-ATPase, but not the Na+/K+, Ca2+ exchanger found in the OSs, extrudes calcium from the IS/ST region. The compartmentalization of calcium regulation in the photoreceptor outer and inner segments implies that transduction and synaptic signaling can be independently controlled. Similar separation of calcium-dependent functions is likely to apply in many types of neuron."
https://openalex.org/W2042855197,"The period (per) and timeless (tim) genes are required for circadian behavioral rhythms in Drosophila. The current model for how these rhythms entrain to light is based upon the light induced decrease in timeless protein (TIM) levels. We show here that the TIM response to light correlates with the effect of light on the behavioral rhythm. To identify components of the entrainment pathway, we also assayed the TIM response in flies with mutant visual systems. Flies that lacked eyes displayed a normal response in lateral neurons. The TIM response to a light pulse was attenuated in flies that were mutant for the transient receptor potential (trp) and trp-like (trpl) genes, which are required for calcium conductance in the visual transduction cascade. The reduced TIM response was accompanied by a reduced phase shift in the behavioral rhythm, but neither response was completely eliminated, and the trpl;trp flies entrain to light-dark cycles, suggesting that these genes perturb some aspect of circadian entrainment when mutated but are not essential for it. The TIM response was also unaffected in ninaE flies that lack the rhodopsin protein (rh1). These results support the hypothesis that circadian entrainment does not rely on the visual system and likely involves a dedicated pathway for photoreception."

https://openalex.org/W2124985215,"Serotonin, a neuromodulator at the crayfish neuromuscular junction, regulates neurotransmission without changing intracellular calcium levels. However, the mechanism of this regulation remains unclear. By analysis of synaptic depression using a depletion model and measurement of vesicle recycling using the styryl dye FM1-43, we show that serotonin increases the number of vesicles available for transmitter release (total synaptic vesicle pool size). This regulation is due either to an increase in the number of vesicles at each release site or to an activation of previously nonsecreting or silent synapses. We also observed that low calcium medium rendered part of the vesicle pool unavailable for release. These results suggest a new mechanism for regulating synaptic transmission."

https://openalex.org/W1997837324,"B-cell activation depends on the intensity of B-cell receptor cross-linking. Studies of haptenated antigens1 and vesicular stomatitis virus2 (VSV) have demonstrated a correlation between antigen repetitiveness and the degree to which B-cell activation is independent of T cells. Here, we compare neutralizing antibody responses to inactivated VSV with those to two inactivated human pathogenic viruses: highly cytopathic poliovirus (PV) and poorly cytopathic measles virus (MV). The rigidly structured PV efficiently induced neutralizing IgM antibodies independent of T cells. In contrast, neutralizing antibodies to the pleomorphic MV were dependent on helper T cells. To test whether this resulted from the differences in virus structure or the capacity of MV to induce cell fusion and/or immunosuppression, we analyzed antibody responses to chimeric MV expressing VSV glycoprotein instead of MV fusion protein and hemagglutinin3. IgM antibodies were independent of T cells; in addition, we found IgC responses dependent on T-cell help that were enduring and protective against lethal VSV infection. Because chimeric MV viruses look like MV ultrastructurally, we conclude that not only structural differences in the envelope but also the ability of MV to induce immunosuppression may limit its capacity to directly activate B cells. These findings are relevant for our understanding of B-cell activation by two proto-typic human pathogenic viruses and for the design of new recombinant vaccines."
