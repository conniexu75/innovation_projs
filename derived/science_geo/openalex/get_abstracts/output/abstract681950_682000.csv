https://openalex.org/W3203364159,"A mammalian brain is composed of numerous cell types organized in an intricate manner to form functional neural circuits. Single-cell RNA sequencing allows systematic identification of cell types based on their gene expression profiles and has revealed many distinct cell populations in the brain1,2. Single-cell epigenomic profiling3,4 further provides information on gene-regulatory signatures of different cell types. Understanding how different cell types contribute to brain function, however, requires knowledge of their spatial organization and connectivity, which is not preserved in sequencing-based methods that involve cell dissociation. Here we used a single-cell transcriptome-imaging method, multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH)5, to generate a molecularly defined and spatially resolved cell atlas of the mouse primary motor cortex. We profiled approximately 300,000 cells in the mouse primary motor cortex and its adjacent areas, identified 95 neuronal and non-neuronal cell clusters, and revealed a complex spatial map in which not only excitatory but also most inhibitory neuronal clusters adopted laminar organizations. Intratelencephalic neurons formed a largely continuous gradient along the cortical depth axis, in which the gene expression of individual cells correlated with their cortical depths. Furthermore, we integrated MERFISH with retrograde labelling to probe projection targets of neurons of the mouse primary motor cortex and found that their cortical projections formed a complex network in which individual neuronal clusters project to multiple target regions and individual target regions receive inputs from multiple neuronal clusters."
https://openalex.org/W3203466092,"During mammalian development, differences in chromatin state coincide with cellular differentiation and reflect changes in the gene regulatory landscape1. In the developing brain, cell fate specification and topographic identity are important for defining cell identity2 and confer selective vulnerabilities to neurodevelopmental disorders3. Here, to identify cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility patterns in the developing human brain, we used a single-cell assay for transposase accessibility by sequencing (scATAC-seq) in primary tissue samples from the human forebrain. We applied unbiased analyses to identify genomic loci that undergo extensive cell-type- and brain-region-specific changes in accessibility during neurogenesis, and an integrative analysis to predict cell-type-specific candidate regulatory elements. We found that cerebral organoids recapitulate most putative cell-type-specific enhancer accessibility patterns but lack many cell-type-specific open chromatin regions that are found in vivo. Systematic comparison of chromatin accessibility across brain regions revealed unexpected diversity among neural progenitor cells in the cerebral cortex and implicated retinoic acid signalling in the specification of neuronal lineage identity in the prefrontal cortex. Together, our results reveal the important contribution of chromatin state to the emerging patterns of cell type diversity and cell fate specification and provide a blueprint for evaluating the fidelity and robustness of cerebral organoids as a model for cortical development."

https://openalex.org/W3203959602,"Mammalian brain cells show remarkable diversity in gene expression, anatomy and function, yet the regulatory DNA landscape underlying this extensive heterogeneity is poorly understood. Here we carry out a comprehensive assessment of the epigenomes of mouse brain cell types by applying single-nucleus DNA methylation sequencing1,2 to profile 103,982 nuclei (including 95,815 neurons and 8,167 non-neuronal cells) from 45 regions of the mouse cortex, hippocampus, striatum, pallidum and olfactory areas. We identified 161 cell clusters with distinct spatial locations and projection targets. We constructed taxonomies of these epigenetic types, annotated with signature genes, regulatory elements and transcription factors. These features indicate the potential regulatory landscape supporting the assignment of putative cell types and reveal repetitive usage of regulators in excitatory and inhibitory cells for determining subtypes. The DNA methylation landscape of excitatory neurons in the cortex and hippocampus varied continuously along spatial gradients. Using this deep dataset, we constructed an artificial neural network model that precisely predicts single neuron cell-type identity and brain area spatial location. Integration of high-resolution DNA methylomes with single-nucleus chromatin accessibility data3 enabled prediction of high-confidence enhancer-gene interactions for all identified cell types, which were subsequently validated by cell-type-specific chromatin conformation capture experiments4. By combining multi-omic datasets (DNA methylation, chromatin contacts, and open chromatin) from single nuclei and annotating the regulatory genome of hundreds of cell types in the mouse brain, our DNA methylation atlas establishes the epigenetic basis for neuronal diversity and spatial organization throughout the mouse cerebrum."

https://openalex.org/W3202031131,"Dengue virus causes approximately 96 million symptomatic infections annually, manifesting as dengue fever or occasionally as severe dengue1,2. There are no antiviral agents available to prevent or treat dengue. Here, we describe a highly potent dengue virus inhibitor (JNJ-A07) that exerts nanomolar to picomolar activity against a panel of 21 clinical isolates that represent the natural genetic diversity of known genotypes and serotypes. The molecule has a high barrier to resistance and prevents the formation of the viral replication complex by blocking the interaction between two viral proteins (NS3 and NS4B), thus revealing a previously undescribed mechanism of antiviral action. JNJ-A07 has a favourable pharmacokinetic profile that results in outstanding efficacy against dengue virus infection in mouse infection models. Delaying start of treatment until peak viraemia results in a rapid and significant reduction in viral load. An analogue is currently in further development."
https://openalex.org/W3204294504,"Understanding cellular architecture is essential for understanding biology. Electron microscopy (EM) uniquely visualizes cellular structures with nanometre resolution. However, traditional methods, such as thin-section EM or EM tomography, have limitations in that they visualize only a single slice or a relatively small volume of the cell, respectively. Focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) has demonstrated the ability to image small volumes of cellular samples with 4-nm isotropic voxels1. Owing to advances in the precision and stability of FIB milling, together with enhanced signal detection and faster SEM scanning, we have increased the volume that can be imaged with 4-nm voxels by two orders of magnitude. Here we present a volume EM atlas at such resolution comprising ten three-dimensional datasets for whole cells and tissues, including cancer cells, immune cells, mouse pancreatic islets and Drosophila neural tissues. These open access data (via OpenOrganelle2) represent the foundation of a field of high-resolution whole-cell volume EM and subsequent analyses, and we invite researchers to explore this atlas and pose questions. Open-access 3D images of whole cells and tissues with combined finer resolution and larger sample size are enabled by advances in focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W3203502883,"Humans have co-evolved with a dense community of microbial symbionts that inhabit the lower intestine. In the colon, secreted mucus creates a barrier that separates these microorganisms from the intestinal epithelium1. Some gut bacteria are able to utilize mucin glycoproteins, the main mucus component, as a nutrient source. However, it remains unclear which bacterial enzymes initiate degradation of the complex O-glycans found in mucins. In the distal colon, these glycans are heavily sulfated, but specific sulfatases that are active on colonic mucins have not been identified. Here we show that sulfatases are essential to the utilization of distal colonic mucin O-glycans by the human gut symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. We characterized the activity of 12 different sulfatases produced by this species, showing that they are collectively active on all known sulfate linkages in O-glycans. Crystal structures of three enzymes provide mechanistic insight into the molecular basis of substrate specificity. Unexpectedly, we found that a single sulfatase is essential for utilization of sulfated O-glycans in vitro and also has a major role in vivo. Our results provide insight into the mechanisms of mucin degradation by a prominent group of gut bacteria, an important process for both normal microbial gut colonization2 and diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease3."
https://openalex.org/W3201780430,"BRCA2-mutant cells are defective in homologous recombination, making them vulnerable to the inactivation of other pathways for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). This concept can be clinically exploited but is currently limited due to insufficient knowledge about how DSBs are repaired in the absence of BRCA2. We show that DNA polymerase θ (POLθ)-mediated end joining (TMEJ) repairs DSBs arising during the S phase in BRCA2-deficient cells only after the onset of the ensuing mitosis. This process is regulated by RAD52, whose loss causes the premature usage of TMEJ and the formation of chromosomal fusions. Purified RAD52 and BRCA2 proteins both block the DNA polymerase function of POLθ, suggesting a mechanism explaining their synthetic lethal relationships. We propose that the delay of TMEJ until mitosis ensures the conversion of originally one-ended DSBs into two-ended DSBs. Mitotic chromatin condensation might further serve to juxtapose correct break ends and limit chromosomal fusions. Löbrich and colleagues report that RAD52 and BRCA2 limit polymerase θ activity until the onset of mitosis to ensure double-strand breaks arising in the S phase are repaired by polymerase θ-mediated end joining in mitosis, not in S phase."
https://openalex.org/W3202229880,"Interactions between the mediodorsal thalamus and the prefrontal cortex are critical for cognition. Studies in humans indicate that these interactions may resolve uncertainty in decision-making1, but the precise mechanisms are unknown. Here we identify two distinct mediodorsal projections to the prefrontal cortex that have complementary mechanistic roles in decision-making under uncertainty. Specifically, we found that a dopamine receptor (D2)-expressing projection amplifies prefrontal signals when task inputs are sparse and a kainate receptor (GRIK4) expressing-projection suppresses prefrontal noise when task inputs are dense but conflicting. Collectively, our data suggest that there are distinct brain mechanisms for handling uncertainty due to low signals versus uncertainty due to high noise, and provide a mechanistic entry point for correcting decision-making abnormalities in disorders that have a prominent prefrontal component2-6."

https://openalex.org/W3201323846,"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has initiated an upheaval in society and has been the cause of considerable stress during this period. Healthcare professionals have been on the front line during this health crisis, particularly paramedical staff. The aim of this study was to assess the high level of stress of healthcare workers during the first wave of the pandemic. Materials and methods The COVISTRESS international study is a questionnaire disseminated online collecting demographic and stress-related data over the globe, during the pandemic. Stress levels were evaluated using non-calibrated visual analog scale, from 0 (no stress) to 100 (maximal stress). Results Among the 13,537 individuals from 44 countries who completed the survey from January to June 2020, we included 10,051 workers (including 1379 healthcare workers, 631 medical doctors and 748 paramedical staff). The stress levels during the first wave of the pandemic were 57.8 ± 33 in the whole cohort, 65.3 ± 29.1 in medical doctors, and 73.6 ± 27.7 in paramedical staff. Healthcare professionals and especially paramedical staff had the highest levels of stress (p &lt; 0.001 vs non-healthcare workers). Across all occupational categories, women had systematically significantly higher levels of work-related stress than men (p &lt; 0.001). There was a negative correlation between age and stress level (r = -0.098, p &lt; 0.001). Healthcare professionals demonstrated an increased risk of very-high stress levels (&gt;80) compared to other workers (OR = 2.13, 95% CI 1.87–2.41). Paramedical staff risk for very-high levels of stress was higher than doctors’ (1.88, 1.50–2.34). The risk of high levels of stress also increased in women (1.83, 1.61–2.09; p &lt; 0.001 vs. men) and in people aged &lt;50 (1.45, 1.26–1.66; p &lt; 0.001 vs. aged &gt;50). Conclusions The first wave of the pandemic was a major stressful event for healthcare workers, especially paramedical staff. Among individuals, women were the most at risk while age was a protective factor."

https://openalex.org/W3202727993,"The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect-a macroscopic manifestation of chiral band topology at zero magnetic field-has been experimentally realized only by the magnetic doping of topological insulators1-3 and the delicate design of moiré heterostructures4-8. However, the seemingly simple bilayer graphene without magnetic doping or moiré engineering has long been predicted to host competing ordered states with QAH effects9-11. Here we explore states in bilayer graphene with a conductance of 2 e2 h-1 (where e is the electronic charge and h is Planck's constant) that not only survive down to anomalously small magnetic fields and up to temperatures of five kelvin but also exhibit magnetic hysteresis. Together, the experimental signatures provide compelling evidence for orbital-magnetism-driven QAH behaviour that is tunable via electric and magnetic fields as well as carrier sign. The observed octet of QAH phases is distinct from previous observations owing to its peculiar ferrimagnetic and ferrielectric order that is characterized by quantized anomalous charge, spin, valley and spin-valley Hall behaviour9."
https://openalex.org/W3204169668,"Spacecraft missions have observed regolith blankets of unconsolidated subcentimetre particles on stony asteroids1–3. Telescopic data have suggested the presence of regolith blankets also on carbonaceous asteroids, including (101955) Bennu4 and (162173) Ryugu5. However, despite observations of processes that are capable of comminuting boulders into unconsolidated materials, such as meteoroid bombardment6,7 and thermal cracking8, Bennu and Ryugu lack extensive areas covered in subcentimetre particles7,9. Here we report an inverse correlation between the local abundance of subcentimetre particles and the porosity of rocks on Bennu. We interpret this finding to mean that accumulation of unconsolidated subcentimetre particles is frustrated where the rocks are highly porous, which appears to be most of the surface10. The highly porous rocks are compressed rather than fragmented by meteoroid impacts, consistent with laboratory experiments11,12, and thermal cracking proceeds more slowly than in denser rocks. We infer that regolith blankets are uncommon on carbonaceous asteroids, which are the most numerous type of asteroid13. By contrast, these terrains should be common on stony asteroids, which have less porous rocks and are the second-most populous group by composition13. The higher porosity of carbonaceous asteroid materials may have aided in their compaction and cementation to form breccias, which dominate the carbonaceous chondrite meteorites14. The absence of fine regolith on the asteroid Bennu is due to the high porosity of its rocks, which compress rather than fragment after impacts and exhibit slow thermal cracking."

https://openalex.org/W3202327157,"Face coverings are a key component of preventive health measure strategies to mitigate the spread of respiratory illnesses. In this study five groups of masks were investigated that are of particular relevance to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: re-usable, fabric two-layer and multi-layer masks, disposable procedure/surgical masks, KN95 and N95 filtering facepiece respirators. Experimental work focussed on the particle penetration through mask materials as a function of particle diameter, and the total inward leakage protection performance of the mask system. Geometric mean fabric protection factors varied from 1.78 to 144.5 for the fabric two-layer and KN95 materials, corresponding to overall filtration efficiencies of 43.8% and 99.3% using a flow rate of 17 L/min, equivalent to a breathing expiration rate for a person in a sedentary or standing position conversing with another individual. Geometric mean total inward leakage protection factors for the 2-layer, multi-layer and procedure masks were <2.3, while 6.2 was achieved for the KN95 masks. The highest values were measured for the N95 group at 165.7. Mask performance is dominated by face seal leakage. Despite the additional filtering layers added to cloth masks, and the higher filtration efficiency of the materials used in disposable procedure and KN95 masks, the total inward leakage protection factor was only marginally improved. N95 FFRs were the only mask group investigated that provided not only high filtration efficiency but high total inward leakage protection, and remain the best option to protect individuals from exposure to aerosol in high risk settings. The Mask Quality Factor and total inward leakage performance are very useful to determine the best options for masking. However, it is highly recommended that testing is undertaken on prospective products, or guidance is sought from impartial authorities, to confirm they meet any implied standards."
https://openalex.org/W3204450518,"Spatially controlled, cargo-specific endocytosis is essential for development, tissue homeostasis and cancer invasion. Unlike cargo-specific clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the clathrin- and dynamin-independent endocytic pathway (CLIC-GEEC, CG pathway) is considered a bulk internalization route for the fluid phase, glycosylated membrane proteins and lipids. While the core molecular players of CG-endocytosis have been recently defined, evidence of cargo-specific adaptors or selective uptake of proteins for the pathway are lacking. Here we identify the actin-binding protein Swiprosin-1 (Swip1, EFHD2) as a cargo-specific adaptor for CG-endocytosis. Swip1 couples active Rab21-associated integrins with key components of the CG-endocytic machinery-Arf1, IRSp53 and actin-and is critical for integrin endocytosis. Through this function, Swip1 supports integrin-dependent cancer-cell migration and invasion, and is a negative prognostic marker in breast cancer. Our results demonstrate a previously unknown cargo selectivity for the CG pathway and a role for specific adaptors in recruitment into this endocytic route."
https://openalex.org/W3203863868,"Animals can choose to act upon, or to ignore, sensory stimuli, depending on circumstance and prior knowledge. This flexibility is thought to depend on neural inhibition, through suppression of inappropriate and disinhibition of appropriate actions. Here, we identified the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN), an inhibitory prethalamic area, as a critical node for control of visually evoked defensive responses in mice. The activity of vLGN projections to the medial superior colliculus (mSC) is modulated by previous experience of threatening stimuli, tracks the perceived threat level in the environment, and is low prior to escape from a visual threat. Optogenetic stimulation of the vLGN abolishes escape responses, and suppressing its activity lowers the threshold for escape and increases risk-avoidance behavior. The vLGN most strongly affects visual threat responses, potentially via modality-specific inhibition of mSC circuits. Thus, inhibitory vLGN circuits control defensive behavior, depending on an animal's prior experience and its anticipation of danger in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W3203167280,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) created the GenomeTrakr Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) Network in 2013, as a tool to improve food safety. This study presents an analysis of Whole Genome source tracking implementation on potential food contamination and related illnesses through theoretical, empirical, and cost benefit analyses. We conduct empirical tests using data from FDA regulated food commodity outbreaks garnering FDA response from 1999 through 2019 and examine the effect of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Pathogen detection program of source tracking WGS isolates collected in the U.S. on outbreak illnesses for three pilot pathogens ( E . coli , Listeria , and Salmonella ). Empirical results are consistent with the theoretical model and suggest that each additional 1,000 WGS isolates added to the public NCBI database is associated with a reduction of approximately 6 illnesses per WGS pathogen, per year. Empirical results are connected to existing literature for a Monte Carlo analysis to estimate benefits and costs. By 2019, annual health benefits are estimated at nearly $500 million, compared to an approximately $22 million investment by public health agencies. Even under conservative assumptions, the program likely broke even in its second year of implementation and could produce increasing public health benefits as the GenomeTrakr network matures."
https://openalex.org/W3201924909,"Psychosocial stress is a common risk factor for anxiety disorders. The cellular mechanism for the anxiogenic effect of psychosocial stress is largely unclear. Here, we show that chronic social defeat (CSD) stress in mice causes mitochondrial impairment, which triggers the PINK1-Parkin mitophagy pathway selectively in the amygdala. This mitophagy elevation causes excessive mitochondrial elimination and consequent mitochondrial deficiency. Mitochondrial deficiency in the basolateral amygdalae (BLA) causes weakening of synaptic transmission in the BLA-BNST (bed nucleus of the stria terminalis) anxiolytic pathway and increased anxiety. The CSD-induced increase in anxiety-like behaviors is abolished in Pink1-/- and Park2-/- mice and alleviated by optogenetic activation of the BLA-BNST synapse. This study identifies an unsuspected role of mitophagy in psychogenetic-stress-induced anxiety elevation and reveals that mitochondrial deficiency is sufficient to increase anxiety and underlies the psychosocial-stress-induced anxiety increase. Mitochondria and mitophagy, therefore, can be potentially targeted to ameliorate anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W3138914839,"Cells respond to stress by blocking translation, rewiring metabolism and forming transient messenger ribonucleoprotein assemblies called stress granules (SGs). After stress release, re-establishing homeostasis and disassembling SGs requires ATP-consuming processes. However, the molecular mechanisms whereby cells restore ATP production and disassemble SGs after stress remain poorly understood. Here we show that upon stress, the ATP-producing enzyme Cdc19 forms inactive amyloids, and that their rapid re-solubilization is essential to restore ATP production and disassemble SGs in glucose-containing media. Cdc19 re-solubilization is initiated by the glycolytic metabolite fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, which directly binds Cdc19 amyloids, allowing Hsp104 and Ssa2 chaperone recruitment and aggregate re-solubilization. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate then promotes Cdc19 tetramerization, which boosts its activity to further enhance ATP production and SG disassembly. Together, these results describe a molecular mechanism that is critical for stress recovery and directly couples cellular metabolism with SG dynamics via the regulation of reversible Cdc19 amyloids. Cereghetti et al. report that the glycolytic metabolite fructose-1,6-bisphosphate initiates the disassembly of amyloids formed by the yeast pyruvate kinase Cdc19 to resume ATP production during stress recovery."
https://openalex.org/W3203099629,"Human genetics have defined a new neurodevelopmental syndrome caused by loss-of-function mutations in MYT1L, a transcription factor known for enabling fibroblast-to-neuron conversions. However, how MYT1L mutation causes intellectual disability, autism, ADHD, obesity, and brain anomalies is unknown. Here, we developed a Myt1l haploinsufficient mouse model that develops obesity, white-matter thinning, and microcephaly, mimicking common clinical phenotypes. During brain development we discovered disrupted gene expression, mediated in part by loss of Myt1l gene-target activation, and identified precocious neuronal differentiation as the mechanism for microcephaly. In contrast, in adults we discovered that mutation results in failure of transcriptional and chromatin maturation, echoed in disruptions in baseline physiological properties of neurons. Myt1l haploinsufficiency also results in behavioral anomalies, including hyperactivity, muscle weakness, and social alterations, with more severe phenotypes in males. Overall, our findings provide insight into the mechanistic underpinnings of this disorder and enable future preclinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W3201772056,"Atopic dermatitis is known to be common among children, but there are few studies examining the epidemiology across the life course. In particular, there is a paucity of data on atopic dermatitis among older adults.To evaluate participant characteristics, patterns of disease activity and severity, and calendar trends in older adult atopic dermatitis in comparison to other age groups in a large population-based cohort.This was a cohort study of 9,154,936 individuals aged 0-99 years registered in The Health Improvement Network, a database comprised of electronic health records from general practices in the United Kingdom between 1994 and 2013. Atopic dermatitis was defined by a previously validated algorithm using a combination of at least one recorded atopic dermatitis diagnostic code in primary care and two atopic dermatitis therapies recorded on separate days. Cross-sectional analyses of disease prevalence were conducted at each age. Logistic mixed effect regression models were used to identify predictors of prevalent disease over time among children (0-17 years), adults (18-74 years), and older adults (75-99 years).Physician-diagnosed atopic dermatitis was identified in 894,454 individuals with the following proportions in each age group: 18.3% of children, 7.7% of adults, and 11.6% of older adults. Additionally, atopic dermatitis prevalence increased across the 2-decade period (beta from linear regression test for trend in the change in proportion per year = 0.005, p = 0.044). In older adults, atopic dermatitis was 27% less common among females (adjusted OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.70-0.76) and was more likely to be active (59.7%, 95% CI 59.5-59.9%) and of higher severity (mean annual percentage with moderate and severe disease: 31.8% and 3.0%, respectively) than in other age groups.In a large population-based cohort, the prevalence of physician-diagnosed atopic dermatitis has increased throughout adulthood and was most common among males age 75 years and above. Compared to children ages 0-17 and adults ages 18-74, older adult atopic dermatitis was more active and severe. Because the prevalence of atopic dermatitis among older adults has increased over time, additional characterization of disease triggers and mechanisms and targeted treatment recommendations are needed for this population."
https://openalex.org/W3203848936,"Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family proteins are epigenetic readers that play a critical role in oncogenesis by controlling the expression of oncogenes such as c-Myc. Targeting BET family proteins has recently emerged as a promising anticancer strategy. However, the molecular mechanisms by which cancer cells respond to BET inhibition are not well understood. In this study, we found that inducing the degradation of BET proteins by the proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTAC) approach potently suppressed the growth of colorectal cancer (CRC) including patient-derived tumors. Mechanistically, BET degradation transcriptionally activates Death Receptor 5 (DR5) to trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) in CRC cells. Enhanced DR5 induction further sensitizes CRC cells with a mutation in Speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP). Furthermore, DR5 is indispensable for a striking antitumor effect of combining BET degradation and anti-PD-1 antibody, which was well tolerated in mice and almost eradicated syngeneic tumors. Our results demonstrate that BET degradation triggers DR5-mediated ICD to potently suppress CRC and potentiate immune checkpoint blockade. These results provide a rationale, mechanistic insights, and potential biomarkers for developing a precision CRC therapy by inducing BET protein degradation."
https://openalex.org/W3203483665,"Ribosome biogenesis plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis by supporting robust protein translation. We investigate the functional and molecular mechanism of Zinc finger protein 545 (ZNF545), a transcriptional repressor for ribosomal RNA (rRNA), in colorectal cancer (CRC). ZNF545 was silenced in CRC compared to adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.0001), implying a tumor-suppressive role. Colon-specific Znf545 knockout in mice accelerated CRC in ApcMin/+ and azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium-induced CRC. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that ZNF545 uses its two zinc finger clusters to bind to minimal rDNA promoter, where it assembled transcriptional repressor complex by interacting with KAP1. Znf545 deletion in mouse embryonic fibroblasts not only increased rRNA transcription rate and the nucleolar size and number but also altered the nucleolar composition and architecture with an increased number of fibrillar centers surrounded by net-like dense fibrillar components. Consequently, Znf545 deletion promoted the gene expression of translation machinery, protein translation, and cell growth. Consistent with its tumor-suppressive role, ZNF545 overexpression in CRC cells induced growth arrest and apoptosis. Finally, administration of rRNA synthesis inhibitor, CX-5461, inhibited CRC development in Znf545Δ/ΔApcMin/+ mice. In conclusion, ZNF545 suppresses CRC through repressing rRNA transcription and protein translation. Targeting rRNA biosynthesis in ZNF545-silenced tumors is a potential therapeutic strategy for CRC."

https://openalex.org/W3204425553,"Recent studies suggest that dysbiosis in chronic kidney disease (CKD) increases gut-derived uremic toxins (GDUT) generation, leads to systemic inflammation, reactive oxygen species generation, and poor prognosis. This study aimed to investigate the effect of oligofructose-enriched inulin supplementation on GDUT levels, inflammatory and antioxidant parameters, renal damage, and intestinal barrier function in adenine-induced CKD rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into control group (CTL, n = 12) fed with standard diet; and CKD group (n = 16) given adenine (200 mg/kg/day) by oral gavage for 3-weeks to induce CKD. At the 4th week, CKD rats were subdivided into prebiotic supplementation (5g/kg/day) for four consecutive weeks (CKD-Pre, n = 8). Also, the control group was subdivided into two subgroups; prebiotic supplemented (CTL-Pre, n = 6) and non-supplemented group (CTL, n = 6). Results showed that prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin supplementation did not significantly reduce serum indoxyl sulfate (IS) but did significantly reduce serum p-Cresyl sulfate (PCS) (p = 0.002) in CKD rats. Prebiotic supplementation also reduced serum urea (p = 0.008) and interleukin (IL)-6 levels (p = 0.001), ameliorated renal injury, and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (p = 0.002) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (p = 0.001) in renal tissues of CKD rats. No significant changes were observed in colonic epithelial tight junction proteins claudin-1 and occludin in the CKD-Pre group. In adenine-induced CKD rats, oligofructose-enriched inulin supplementation resulted in a reduction in serum urea and PCS levels, enhancement of the antioxidant activity in the renal tissues, and retardation of the disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W3204627271,"Reproductive health service is crucial for youth to reduce maternal and child mortality. However, many young women face unintended pregnancies and pregnancy-related complications due to insufficient knowledge of contraceptive methods and low contraceptive utilization. This study aims to assess the modern contraceptive prevalence rates among youth and identify factors influencing modern contraceptive utilization among youth. We used Myanmar Demographic and Health Survey (2015–2016) data. This study included 1,423 men and 3,677 women aged 15–24 years from all states and regions of Myanmar. We used multivariable binary logistic regression analysis and reported the results using adjusted Odds Ratios (AOR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). Data analysis was done by STATA software (version 15.1). Ever-married youth used mainly injectable contraception, followed by oral contraceptive pills. Never-married male youth mainly used oral contraceptive pills; however, almost all never-married female youth did not use contraception. The modern contraceptive prevalence rates were 14.9% among total youth, 10% among males, 16.8% among females, 1.5% among never-married males, 44.7% among ever-married males, and 54% among ever-married female youth. The knowledge on modern contraceptive methods favored the utilization. Sexually active youth utilized more contraception than sexually inactive youth. We also found geographical variation and low utilization among rural youth. The desire for more children was also a significant predictor of contraceptive utilization among married youth. The utilization of modern contraception was low among Myanmar youth. Reproductive health program needs to be emphasized on the youth population especially in the area with low utilization to have equitable access to quality reproductive health services. Moreover, the revitalization of Youth Information Corner and youth-friendly reproductive health education programs should be implemented to increase reproductive health knowledge and prevent unsafe sex, unintended pregnancies, and abortions which might help in reducing maternal and child mortality. We warranted conducting mixed method studies to explore the barriers and challenges of contraceptive utilization and male involvement in the choice of contraception among youth."
https://openalex.org/W3202547215,"The phenomenon of dreaming about the laboratory when participating in a sleep study is common. The content of such dreams draws upon episodic memory fragments of the participant's lab experience, generally, experimenters, electrodes, the lab setting, and experimental tasks. However, as common as such dreams are, they have rarely been given a thorough quantitative or qualitative treatment. Here we assessed 528 dreams (N = 343 participants) collected in a Montreal sleep lab to 1) evaluate state and trait factors related to such dreams, and 2) investigate the phenomenology of lab incorporations using a new scoring system. Lab incorporations occurred in over a third (35.8%) of all dreams and were especially likely to occur in REM sleep (44.2%) or from morning naps (48.4%). They tended to be related to higher depression scores, but not to sex, nightmare-proneness or anxiety. Common themes associated with lab incorporation were: Meta-dreaming, including lucid dreams and false awakenings (40.7%), Sensory incorporations (27%), Wayfinding to, from or within the lab (24.3%), Sleep as performance (19.6%), Friends/Family in the lab (15.9%) and Being an object of observation (12.2%). Finally, 31.7% of the lab incorporation dreams included relative projections into a near future (e.g., the experiment having been completed), but very few projections into the past (2.6%). Results clarify sleep stage and sleep timing factors associated with dreamed lab incorporations. Phenomenological findings further reveal both the typical and unique ways in which lab memory elements are incorporated de novo into dreaming. Identified themes point to frequent social and skillful dream scenarios that entail monitoring of one's current state (in the lab) and projection of the self into dream environments elaborated around local space and time. The findings have implications for understanding fundamental dream formation mechanisms but also for appreciating both the advantages and methodological pitfalls of conducting laboratory-based dream collection."

https://openalex.org/W3201823117,"Transposable Elements (TEs) are ubiquitous genetic elements with the ability to move within a genome. TEs contribute to a large fraction of the repetitive elements of a genome, and because of their nature, they are not routinely analyzed in RNA-Seq gene expression studies. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal neurodegenerative disease, and a well-accepted model for its study is the mouse harboring the human SOD1 G93A mutant. In this model, landmark stages of the disease can be recapitulated at specific time points, making possible to understand changes in gene expression across time. While there are several works reporting TE activity in ALS models, they have not explored their activity through the disease progression. Moreover, they have done it at the expense of losing their locus of expression. Depending on their genomic location, TEs can regulate genes in cis and in trans, making locus-specific analysis of TEs of importance in order to understand their role in modulating gene expression. Particularly, the locus-specific role of TEs in ALS has not been fully elucidated. In this work, we analyzed publicly available RNA-Seq datasets of the SOD1 G93A mouse model, to understand the locus-specific role of TEs. We show that TEs become up-regulated at the early stages of the disease, and via statistical associations, we speculate that they can regulate several genes, which in turn might be contributing to the genetic dysfunction observed in ALS."
https://openalex.org/W3204329488,"Five groups of lambs (n = 9 each) were used to test the effect of plant extracts rich in hydrolysable (HT) or condensed tannin (CT) on animal performance, fatty acid composition of rumen content, liver and meat. The control group (CO) received a concentrate-based diet without tannins supplementation. The other groups received the same diet as the control lambs plus 4% chestnut (CH) and tara (TA) extracts as a source of HT and mimosa (MI) and gambier (GA) extracts as a source of CT. One-way ANOVA was used to assess the overall effect of dietary treatments, tannins supplementation (CO vs. CH+TA+MI+GA) and the effect of tannin type (HT vs. CT: CH+TA vs. MI+GA) on animal performance, rumen content, liver and intramuscular FA. Dietary CH negatively affected animal performance. The rumen content of the different groups showed similar levels of 18:3 c 9 c 12 c 15, 18:2 c 9 c 12, 18:2 c 9 t 11, 18:1 t 11 and 18:0, whereas 18:1 t 10 was greater in CO. Also, 18:1 t 10 tended to be lower in the rumen of HT than CT-fed lambs. These data were partially confirmed in liver and meat, where CO showed a greater percentage of individual trans 18:1 fatty acids in comparison with tannins-fed groups. Our findings challenge some accepted generalizations on the use of tannins in ruminant diets as they were ineffective to favour the accumulation of dietary PUFA or healthy fatty acids of biohydrogenation origin in the rumen content and lamb meat, but suggest a generalized influence on BH rather than on specific steps."
https://openalex.org/W3203575022,"Introduction Testicular cancer is one of the most treatable cancers, with a 10-year survival of more than 95%. Many patients will be long-term survivors and this disease strikes men in an important phase of their lives, therefore the quality of life (QoL) among these patients is an area of particular interest. We aimed to study whether QoL in testicular cancer survivors depends on the time since cancer diagnosis. Methods Data were collected from the EPSAM (Esposizioni postnatali e salute maschile) study, a case-control study on patients with testicular cancer, diagnosed between 1997 and 2008 in the province of Turin, Northern Italy, and interviewed between 2008 and 2010 (response rate among cases 57% ). Patients were contacted through their oncologist at the San Giovanni Batista Hospital in Turin or through their general practitioner (GP) in the rest of the Province of Turin. QoL was assessed cross-sectionally using the short form 12 (SF-12) questionnaire, a generic short-form health survey that produces two summary scores, PCS (physical component score) and MCS (mental component score), to evaluate physical and mental health, respectively. Results Out of 234 study patients, 125 cases were seminomas and 109 cases were nonseminomas. The mean age at diagnosis was 34.5 years. After adjusting for age, time since diagnosis was not associated with PCS and MCS scores. Among nonseminomas, the median PCS slightly increased (adjusted OR (odds ratio) for 5+ vs &lt; 2 years since cancer diagnosis: 1.78 (1.17–2.73), p = 0.008 ) and MCS slightly decreased (adjusted OR per 1-year increase since cancer diagnosis : 0.92, 95% CI: 0.82–1.05, p = 0.23 ) with time. Similar findings of no association between time since diagnosis and PCS and MCS were found when the analyses were restricted to the subgroup of cancer patients contacted through their oncologist, whose response proportion was 82%. Conclusion In a study of testicular cancer patients interviewed cross-sectionally at 1 to more than 10 years since diagnosis, time since cancer diagnosis was not associated with QoL when we considered all germ-cell testicular cancer patients together. When stratified by histology type, we found certain evidence that nonseminoma cases report higher PCS over time since cancer diagnosis."

Extant work has shown that certain search queries reflect the attitudes of hard-to-survey populations, but we do not know if this extends to the general population. In this article, we leverage abundant data from the Covid-19 pandemic to assess whether people's worries about the pandemic match epidemiological trends as well as political preferences. We use the string 'will I die from coronavirus' on GT as the measure for people's level of distress regarding Covid-19. We also test whether concern for coronavirus is a partisan issue by contrasting GT data and 2016 election results. We find strong evidence that (1) GT search volume close matches epidemiological data and (2) significant differences exist between states that supported Clinton or Trump in 2016."
https://openalex.org/W3204046293,"Nigeria has the second highest number of people living with HIV (PLWH) globally, and evidence-based approaches are needed to achieve national goals to identify, treat, and reduce new infections. Youth between the ages of 15-24, including young men who have sex with men (YMSM), are disproportionately impacted by the Nigerian HIV epidemic. The purpose of this study was to inform adaptation of evidence-based peer navigation and mHealth approaches (social media outreach to promote HIV testing; short messaging service text message reminders to promote HIV treatment engagement) to the local context within iCARE Nigeria, a multi-phase study designed to investigate combination interventions to promote HIV testing and care engagement among youth in Nigeria.To elicit expert and community perspectives, a local group of advisors from academia, community, and governmental sectors provided feedback on intervention adaptation, which then informed a series of focus groups with stakeholders in Ibadan, Nigeria. Focus group data were collected over a period of three days in December of 2018. Participants in focus groups included YMSM and HIV-positive youth in care ages 16-24, and HIV service providers from local AIDS service organizations (ASO). Groups were stratified by HIV serostatus, gender, and stakeholder type. Focus group sessions were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide, audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using a content analysis approach.Local experts recommended intervention adaptations specific to the status of peer navigators as volunteers, peer characteristics (slightly older age, high maturity level, HIV/YMSM status), and intervention characteristics and resources (low navigator to peer ratio; flexible matching by demographic and social characteristics; social media platforms and content). Five focus group discussions with stakeholders, including 27 participants were conducted to elicit feedback on these and other potential adaptations. Youth participants (n = 21) were mean age 20 years (range = 16-24); 76% HIV-positive, 76% men and 48% MSM. Service providers (n = 6) represented both HIV prevention and care services. Participants across stratified subgroups reported largely positive perceptions and high perceived acceptability of both mHealth and peer navigation strategies, and echoed the recommendations of the advisory group for volunteer-based navigators to promote altruism, with a low navigator-peer ratio (1:5). Participants emphasized the need to incorporate minimal mobile data use strategies and popular social media platforms among YMSM (e.g., Facebook, Grindr) for widespread access and reach of the interventions.In Ibadan, Nigeria, stakeholders support the adaptation of combined mHealth and peer navigation strategies to promote HIV testing and care engagement among high-risk youth. Recommended adaptations for the local context reflect concerns about the feasibility and sustainability of the intervention and are expected to improve accessibility and acceptability."
https://openalex.org/W3204741514,"Objectives Acquired coagulopathy may be associated with bleeding risk. Approaches to restore haemostasis include administration of coagulation factor concentrates, but there are concerns regarding potential prothrombotic risk. The present study assessed the prothrombotic potential of four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) versus activated PCC (aPCC) and recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa), using three preclinical animal models. Methods The first model was a modified Wessler model of venous stasis-induced thrombosis in rabbit, focusing on dilutional coagulopathy; the second model employed the same system but focused on direct oral anticoagulant reversal (i.e. edoxaban). The third model assessed the prothrombotic impact of 4F-PCC, aPCC and rFVIIa in a rat model of ferric chloride-induced arterial thrombosis. Results In the first model, thrombi were observed at aPCC doses ≥10 IU/kg (therapeutic dose 100 IU/kg) and rFVIIa doses ≥50 μg/kg (therapeutic dose 90 μg/kg), but not 4F-PCC 50 IU/kg (therapeutic dose 50 IU/kg). The impact of 4F-PCC (up to 300 IU/kg) on thrombus formation was evident from 10 minutes post-administration, but not at 24 hours post-administration; this did not change with addition of tranexamic acid and/or fibrinogen concentrate. 4F-PCC-induced thrombus formation was lower after haemodilution versus non-haemodilution. In the second model, no prothrombotic effect was confirmed at 4F-PCC 50 IU/kg. The third model showed lower incidence of thrombus formation for 4F-PCC 50 IU/kg versus aPCC (50 U/kg) and rFVIIa (90 μg/kg). Conclusions These results suggest that 4F-PCC has a low thrombotic potential versus aPCC or rFVIIa, supporting the clinical use of 4F-PCC for the treatment of coagulopathy-mediated bleeding."
https://openalex.org/W3202486732,"As a common feature, bilateral symmetry of biological forms is ubiquitous, but in fact rarely exact. In a setting of analytic geometry, bilateral symmetry is defined with respect to a point, line or plane, and the well-known notions of fluctuating asymmetry, directional asymmetry and antisymmetry are recast. A meticulous scheme for asymmetry assessments is proposed and explicit solutions to them are derived. An investigation into observational errors of points representing the geometric structure of an object offers a baseline reference for asymmetry assessment of the object. The proposed assessments are applicable to individual, part or all point pairs at both individual and collective levels. The exact relationship between the developed treatments and the widely used Procrustes method in asymmetry assessment is examined. An application of the proposed assessments to a large collection of human skull data in the form of 3D landmark coordinates finds: (a) asymmetry of most skulls is not fluctuating, but directional if measured about a plane fitted to shared landmarks or side landmarks for balancing; (b) asymmetry becomes completely fluctuating if one side of a skull could be slightly rotated and translated with respect to the other side; (c) female skulls are more asymmetric than male skulls. The methodology developed in this study is rigorous and transparent, and lays an analytical base for investigation of structural symmetries and asymmetries in a wide range of biological and medical applications."
https://openalex.org/W3204403898,"Background Dialysis patients have an increased risk of mortality. Recently treatment with haemodiafiltration (HDF) has been reported to reduce mortality, particularly cardiovascular mortality, compared to standard high-flux haemodialysis (HD). However, why HDF may offer a survival advantage remains to be determined. So, we conducted a pilot study to explore differences in middle-molecules, inflammation and markers of vascular disease in patients treated by HD and HDF. Methods Observational cross-sectional study measuring serum β2-microglobulin (β2M), Advanced Glycosylation End Products (AGEs) by skin autofluorescence (SAF), oxidative stress with ischaemia modified albumin ratio (IMAR) and peripheral vascular disease assessment using Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI), and arterial stiffness using Cardio-Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI). Results We studied 196 patients, mean age 69.1 ± 12.4 years, 172 (87.8%) treated by HD and 24 (12.2%) by HDF. Age, body mass index, co-morbidity and dialysis vintage were not different between HD and HDF groups. Middle molecules; β 2 M (31±9.9 vs 31.2±10 ug/mL) and SAF (2.99±0.72 vs 3.0±0.84 AU), ABI (1.06±0.05 vs 1.07±0.10) and CAVI (9.34±1.55 vs 9.35±1.23) were not different, but IMAR was higher in the HD patients (38.4±14.8 vs 31.3 ± 17.4, P = 0.035) Conclusions In this pilot observational study, we found patients treated by HDF had lower oxidative stress as measured by IMAR, with no differences in middle molecules. Lower oxidative stress would be expected to have diverse protective effects on the cardiovascular system Although we found no differences in ABI and CAVI, future studies are required to determine whether reduced oxidative stress translates into clinically relevant differences over time."

https://openalex.org/W3204303758,"Alpha-Mannosidosis (AM) is an ultra-rare storage disorder caused by a deficiency of lysosomal alpha-mannosidase encoded by the MAN2B1 gene. Clinical presentation of AM includes mental retardation, recurrent infections, hearing loss, dysmorphic features, and motor dysfunctions. AM has never been reported in Tunisia. We report here the clinical and genetic study of six patients from two Tunisian families with AM. The AM diagnosis was confirmed by an enzymatic activity assay. Genetic investigation was conducted by Sanger sequencing of the mutational hotspots for the first family and by ES analysis for the second one. In the first family, a frameshift duplication p.(Ser802GlnfsTer129) was identified in the MAN2B1 gene. For the second family, ES analysis led to the identification of a missense mutation p.(Arg229Trp) in the MAN2B1 gene in four affected family members. The p.(Ser802GlnfsTer129) mutation induces a premature termination codon which may trigger RNA degradation by the NMD system. The decrease in the levels of MAN2B1 synthesis could explain the severe phenotype observed in the index case. According to the literature, the p.(Arg229Trp) missense variant does not have an impact on MAN2B1 maturation and transportation, which correlates with a moderate clinical sub-type. To explain the intra-familial variability of cognitive impairment, exome analysis allowed the identification of two likely pathogenic variants in GHR and SLC19A3 genes potentially associated to cognitive decline. The present study raises awareness about underdiagnosis of AM in the region that deprives patients from accessing adequate care. Indeed, early diagnosis is critical in order to prevent disease progression and to propose enzyme replacement therapy."

https://openalex.org/W3203506680,"Indoor air quality monitoring as it relates to the domestic setting is an integral part of human exposure monitoring and health risk assessment. Hence there is a great need for easy to use, fast and economical indoor air quality sensors to monitor the volatile organic compound composition of the air which is known to be significantly perturbed by the various source emissions from activities in the home. To meet this need, paper-based colorimetric sensor arrays were deployed as volatile organic compound detectors in a field study aiming to understand which activities elicit responses from these sensor arrays in household settings. The sensor array itself is composed of pH indicators and aniline dyes that enable molecular recognition of carboxylic acids, amines and carbonyl-containing compounds. The sensor arrays were initially deployed in different rooms in a single household having different occupant activity types and levels. Sensor responses were shown to differ for different room settings on the basis of occupancy levels and the nature of the room emission sources. Sensor responses relating to specific activities such as cooking, cleaning, office work, etc were noted in the temporal response. Subsequently, the colorimetric sensor arrays were deployed in a broader study across 9 different households and, using multivariate analysis, the sensor responses were shown to correlate strongly with household occupant activity and year of house build. Overall, this study demonstrates the significant potential for this type of simple approach to indoor air pollution monitoring in residential environments."

https://openalex.org/W3204300631,"Ionizing radiation (IR) is widely used in cancer therapy and accidental or environmental exposure is a major concern. However, little is known about the genome-wide effects IR exerts on germ cells and the relative contribution of DNA repair pathways for mending IR-induced lesions. Here, using C . elegans as a model system and using primary sequencing data from our recent high-level overview of the mutagenic consequences of 11 genotoxic agents, we investigate in detail the genome-wide mutagenic consequences of exposing wild-type and 43 DNA repair and damage response defective C . elegans strains to a Caesium (Cs-137) source, emitting γ-rays. Cs-137 radiation induced single nucleotide variants (SNVs) at a rate of ~1 base substitution per 3 Gy, affecting all nucleotides equally. In nucleotide excision repair mutants, this frequency increased 2-fold concurrently with increased dinucleotide substitutions. As observed for DNA damage induced by bulky DNA adducts, small deletions were increased in translesion polymerase mutants, while base changes decreased. Structural variants (SVs) were augmented with dose, but did not arise with significantly higher frequency in any DNA repair mutants tested. Moreover, 6% of all mutations occurred in clusters, but clustering was not significantly altered in any DNA repair mutant background. Our data is relevant for better understanding how DNA repair pathways modulate IR-induced lesions."
